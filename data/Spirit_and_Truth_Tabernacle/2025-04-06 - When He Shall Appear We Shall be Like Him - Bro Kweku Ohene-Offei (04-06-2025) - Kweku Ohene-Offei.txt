But when I think about my blessing, ain't no devil going to keep me away. I couldn't hardly wait till the church doors open. While the singing and the praying and the shouting began. I couldn't hardly wait till the minister steps forward and the Holy Spirit starts to descend. Sometimes I don't even feel like singing a song. With all of the pressures, the press in me is gone. Seems like the cares of this old world try to take my joy away. Yeah. But when I think about my blessing, ain't no devil going to keep me awake. I can't hardly wait till the church doors open. While the singing and the praying and the shouting began, I couldn't hardly wait till the minister steps forward while the Holy Spirit starts to [Music] descend.

So good to be in the house of God. Amen. Y'all can be seated just for a moment. Amen. Um, I am happy to be in church. Uh, we thank God for just keeping us over the, uh, dangerous airways. Uh, but we got back from South Carolina on yesterday morning about 10:00. So, I I had a flight that left at 5:30 in the morning. And, um, when I got home, all I did was find a pillow and and uh tried to recover a little bit. Amen. But but God is good. God is good. We had a had a wonderful time there. Had a chance to visit uh Brother Belton on Wednesday night and uh also Brother Armstrong on Friday night and um and in between had a chance to uh go to the golf tournament and I played the worst I ever played. Amen. And I I I they gave me this special trophy called the last place trophy. Uh and I say, well, Lord, this is golf is a very humbling game because you know last year I came in second place and everybody was kind of what brother Jack going to do? Well, brother Jack didn't do nothing. Uh so I said that's all right. I'll take it. I'll be back. The only place I can go from here is All right. Amen. Amen. God is good. But while I was away, I got a chance to hear uh many of the services. And last Sunday, Brother Troy uh did a a wonderful job. And we not we not got to talking about that distortion in the microphones and how Satan tries to block you from being able to hear the real voice of God. We got too many voices speaking to us nowadays. And and we need to hear the voice of God. Amen. If I don't if y'all don't recognize, but the voice of politics speaks every day. You you you get a tweet every day. And we we never had it like this before. And and and it's so much stuff going on that uh all you end up talking about for most of the day is just mess mess. I mean, it it it's it's shameful, you know, but but uh but that's why we really need to concentrate on hearing the voice of God. Uh you can't be moved by everything that everybody out there reporting. Uh there's only one report that never changes. And that is the report found in the word of the Lord. Amen. And I believe the question was asked, whose report will you believe? And the answer was given, I will believe the report of the Lord. Praise God. Amen. But we we thank God for Brother Troy. And then on Wednesday night, uh, Brother Quinton came to minister to our hearts. And, uh, I just remember a statement that he made. Uh, silence is a weapon. I said, "My God, I was sitting there listening to that. I said, man, that's that's powerful." You know, just thank God for the word as it as it was going forth to our hearts and just appreciate these brothers. Amen. And and all that they're doing for the kingdom of God. Amen. I saw brother Smiley uh there. Good to have him back in service. He had been out preaching and and uh I know he's got some more things scheduled cuz while I was in uh Carolina said, "Yeah, brother Smiley coming." I said, "Well, praise the Lord. That's that's real good." But um I know that many of them sent their greetings and they say they're looking forward to coming here in uh in July. So we we we looking forward to it. They all keep things in prayer. um a lot of movement or people trying to move to get in and out but all kind of stuff being done in our government and we just we just need God to help his people. Amen. Just be with him through uh through this time. So, uh keep that keep keep those things in mind. Um I I know I'm supposed to say something else. It'll come to me. But while I'm uh here, I I have a couple prayer requests that I want to make mention of. Um first is uh Sister Lois asked prayer for a lady that she met this week. Uh her husband is in desperate need of prayer. We want to uh take that request before the Lord. Also, um I got um a request over in Sarasota. uh brother uh Frano's uncle uh he had been diagnosed with cancer and then they gave him uh they said he was free from cancer. They gave an update and now they're saying they misdiagnosed it and and and and saying that the cancer is back and there's not much that they can do. Uh but you know, we know a God that's greater than every doctor and uh and we're just going to take our brother before the Lord uh in prayer. There was another prayer request that I had and at the Oh, brother Mason. Brother Mason um he was um taken to the hospital, but he's back home right now. He's been complaining about some issues with his stomach and uh we want to uh just remember him in prayer. The test that they did at the hospital all came back negative. We thank God for that. And uh but he's just having trouble uh sleeping and uh and I'd like to read Psalm 127 uh over our brother and uh we'll have a word of prayer for him. And the other thing I want to make mention of, um, uh, we have, uh, Sister Boyd, Amen, with us today. God bless you, Sister Boyd. So good. So good to have you. Amen. Service. And I see my cousin back there, too. Cousins. All right, Ashley. All right. Good to see you. And um uh also sister um Cynthia, she has her sister with us on today. God bless you. So good to have uh them and that with us. Praise the Lord. Uh Psalm 127 just real quick. I want to read this in um uh verse. Let me just let me just go straight to verse two. You when you open up the Bible, you start seeing things like, Lord, let me let me get out of here. Let me just read verse two and leave. Amen. Uh scripture say it is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, uh to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he giveth his beloved sleep. Amen. God wants you to be able to sleep, not up all night. And that's the devil that want to do that to you. But uh God wants you to rest at night. Amen. When it's time to rest. Amen. So we want to pray for brother Mason. Amen. Uh also this request from sister Lois and also the request there in Sarah. So let's bow our heads. Father, we come in the mighty name of Jesus. the name that is above every name. Father, we realize that when Christ went to a cross, he went for a twofold purpose. One was to bring salvation to our souls. We were lost and undone. Uh we needed a savior. And God, you brought uh the remedy for us. And we thank you for what you did when you died and you rose again. You brought the remedy. But also at the cross, you did something else. Lord, the scripture says you were wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon you. And it also told us that with your stripes, we are healed. So, Father, over these requests, we ask for healing uh even right now. Brother Mason that has been fighting, Lord, with this stomach condition, they couldn't find it, but Lord, he still feels something. So, Satan, we want to tell you, we rebuke you in the name of Jesus. If the doctors say there's nothing there, then there is nothing there. And uh we receive it right now in the name of Jesus. And we pray God that you would give Mason sleep because you say you give your beloved sleep. And I pray that you would just bless him, Father, abundantly. Give him peace in his heart and in his mind. And Lord, help him, Father, just to get through this. We also want to remember sister Lois's uh the lady that she met, the husband is in desperate need of prayer. And father, we know prayer is something that changes things no matter what the situation is. So we commit this man uh into your capable hands and pray father that you would move on the scene on his behalf if he does not know you as his savior. God, we pray that this would be used as an opportunity to draw him closer to you. Father, that's our prayer. We also want to remember our precious brother there in uh St. in in Sarasota. God, the doctors gave him a clear report and uh the man's been rejoicing in that. And now, Father, the enemies come back to attack his body and they don't know uh what to say or what to do, Lord. But uh we know that you are in complete control. And Father, we're asking that you would just move on the scene. uh in between him and his condition. We place the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and we claim our brother once again for your glory. And we ask God that you would move by your spirit. I know the devil didn't like the testimony that went out about him uh being healed. And Lord, we're praying, Father, that you give him a second testimony of being healed again. Father, we uh we we we we know that there's nothing too hard for you. and you you you told us through your prophet that if we could just get the people to believe not even cancer would stand in the way of a prayer. So father we we believe that our prayer even has power over cancer. So we ask God that you would move even right now uh for our precious brothers in the name of Jesus that we ask it. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. We want to um just prepare amen our hearts for the word uh on today. Uh brother Quu will be coming to minister for us and and and I am grateful to have all the help here in the church that we got. Uh cuz I I need it. Amen. I need it. And I remember brother Anderson uh he preached over at Brother West Coast Church one time and he he he said something. He says um when he got to uh leading the church, he said, "Lord, I can't do this all by myself. I need some help." And uh he said, "Ever since he said that to the Lord, God has always provided help." And every season, God had has help. So I said, you know, if God answered his prayer, I'm going to pray the same thing. Lord, I need some help. And God has sent us some help in this church. And I thank God for these servants of God. Amen. I appreciate them. appreciate them so much. Amen. So, we want to just raise to our feet and let's Amen. prepare to receive uh the word of the Lord as it comes through uh brother Quu. Amen. Amazing. [Music] I like I want [Music] [Music] Oh, heat, heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Music] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Let's give a clap offering to our [Applause] [Music] Lord. Praise be to the Lord. Amen. Shall we have a word of prayer? Eternal Lord, we thank you this amazing morning that you've given to us. Father, we rejoice and we are glad in this day. For this is the day that you've made for us, Father Lord, to bless us, for us to come before you and love you and worship you. Bring our apprec appreciation and what you've done for us over the years, over the week. We thank you, Father. I pray for those who travel and bringing them back. Thank you for brother Jack. Thank you for that Quinton and all the brothers and sisters, Lord. Father, even bringing us from home here is a is a miracle, Lord Jesus. We appreciate you for all that you do for us, Lord. Father, one more time, we've assembled in your presence, Father. Lord, to be about the business of the Lord, Father, we are incapable of doing the business of the Lord without you, Father. Take a hold of every heart, Lord. And you are the one who speaks the word and by your spirit you hear the words into our hearts. Father this morning Lord even the prayers have gone forward for various requests. Father Lord even those who which have not been spoken you know the desires of the heart of the people. You know the needs Lord you know the sickness. You know the conditions of the body of the spirit honor of the soul. Lord Jesus everyone gathered here and those who are listening in and those who even listen later on. Lord Jesus, may the same Holy Spirit, Father, I pray, work on their behalf, take sickness away, take Lord, misfortunes away, take sorrows and and depressions and suicidal thought and every battle and every demonic spirit Lord Jesus that the enemy tried to put upon your people. Lord, you are the consuming fire. Consume those spirit Lord Jesus and liberate us, Father, I pray and bring glory and honor to your name. We thank you, Father. We bless you. We love you. Take prance, Lord Jesus Christ, and magnify your name this morning. In that blessed name, Jesus Christ, we pray with thanksgiving. Amen. God bless you. Shall we take our seats? Amen. We have a living God and the Lord is good to us. Amen. Amen. And he's called us for this purpose. Amen. And God bless you musicians for all that you do. Our Sarah films you bring the glory of the Lord and the atmosphere of worship and blessings. We appreciate you and the Lord bless each and every one of you. Same through engineers and sound system. Every one of you, the Lord bless you. The Lord sees everything that we do for the Lord. Amen. So we want to speak on a little h subject. When he shall appear, we will be like him. Amen. And I also give a little testimony from Puerto Rico. Amen. is just an amazing I'll tell you a little bit about how this uh title or sermon title came about. It was March the 1st. I think it was Saturday. I normally get a little more rest on Saturdays cuz I don't have to work on the weekends. So, Friday night uh when I wake up, I usually like to listen to uh Arab's message or other preachers. So, I slot in a message. I think uh investment is that right? So investment was the message I was preaching Phoenix if you can go to the second slide for me please okay that's right so I was listening to this sermon and sometime I listen and I fall asleep but I hear my subconsc wake up, listen and fall asleep again. And then when I feel like really waking up and I wake up. So this time I was gone. I was sleeping and gone and I was listening to this message uh sorry investment that was preached by William Abraham 1963 January 26 Finn Arizona. Right. So there the voice didn't come from the sermon. I was just fast asleep and a striking voice hit my heart. When he shall appear we be like him. Amen. And I woke up instantly and I said, "No, this is a scripture." So I went to the scriptures and I saw this scripture in 1 John 3:2. We will go to that. So I quickly p it down and look at the time. It was around 11:23 a.m. in the morning. So that was how and I was preparing for Puerto Rico and uh I I already had a sermon I wanted to preach on the Sunday. the pastor, brother Jose asked me to preach a Sunday morning and then he asked me to take either Friday night or Saturday in the evening. So I usually this was my fourth visit to Puerto Rico and I usually take the Saturday because I travel on the Friday and sometime two days before the journey I don't get enough enough sleep sometime I don't I barely sleep so I prefer take the taking the Saturday service but this time I said you know what I can take the Friday so because you know what I I think I'll be able to take the Friday but I didn't communicate with him and I was like oh I need to let him know record a voicemail send him a text message but I was like something was I mean kind of h holding me from doing it and I was contemplating on the sermon that I wanted to preach on the uh Friday night. The sermon that was coming on my heart was what I preach here the influence and impact of a godly mother. But I was wondering is it the right sermon you know to preach for international service people from Paraguay uh Dominican Republic. So and I was battling my heart is it the right thing to preach? So a couple of days before I left I saw a voice message from brother Osbi said brother please you have to preach the Friday night because I wanted brother Mario he's a pastor from Paraguay he came with his wife and his son to Puerto Rico they were friends so he came like a week h ear earlier h was also part of the ministry in Puerto Rico so but then his mom was sick so he had to fly back to Paraguay and see his mom and his mom was actually passing he was the mom was at the hospital. So, but the Lord is wonderful, my brothers and sisters. H when you serve the Lord, it's not in vain. Amen. So, the mom had been a Catholic for years, you know, coming from South South America. And uh the mom said that, "What do you think I don't what do you what made you to think I don't believe your message?" He said, "The Lord has told me that you are blessed for raising a minister of the Lord." And so, the brother was with his mom in the last days at the hospital and the mom transitioned to the Lord. Praise God. So he flew back on the Friday about 6 8 hours back to Puerto Rico. So the pastor said brother quickly please if you can preach because brother Mario would not be in a position to preach on a on a Friday and I said brother you just confirm what the Lord has placed on my heart because I was kind of wondering is it a right sermon and when you told me about the Mario's mother has passed on then I know it's the right sermon and I know why the Lord placed on my heart. All right. So with the Sunday sermon, I had something already I wanted to preach that was on dispensational changes about h from son of god. No sorry son of son of son of man, son of god and son of David. How the lord transitioned from Adam to Jesus Christ was the rede redemption ministry. So he came as a prophet as a lamb sending a prophet killing lambs to redeem the people of the lord. Amen. And then he changed from a lamb to a crossfish when he came on Calvary. Remember Calvary after he done he said it is finished. He's finished the redemption. He's just pulling the sons from the Theophony to the earth and back to the theophony. All right. So he came from a ram to a crossfish. And the crossfish is two fishes with open open mouth. So that symbolizes the blessing of the of the older son. All right. Coming to the younger. Right? In other words, the gospel moving from Israel, the firstborn church to the gentile. And so, and then from Jesus Christ up to Sunset Mountain was the son of God ministry, the Holy Spirit ministry. Amen. Where is about from the church ages? Look at Abraham when he was here. Only believe, only believe, all things are possible. Only believe. That was the that was the Piscy ministry. And the Lord used brother Paul move on to sunset and the Lord crossed his hands again on on sunset mountain and change the scene change the dimension now from the seven church changes which was the darkness when the lord when does the h stars appear stars appear in the night so the lord was sending messages in the seven churches for over 2,000 years or around 2,000 years and the lord has now finished building the church glory from Adam to Jesus was the foundation all right and from Jesus to sunset mountain was the building itself. But then the building has to be kept cuz if you build a house without a roof, you're going to have the sunshine, the rain, and all the weather on you. So now from from um uh uh 63, Sunset Mountain till whenever will be the third ministry that is the Aquarian, the eagle ministry. That's when the fullness of the mind of God go God was given to the wife of Jesus Christ. So that was what I was planning to to preach. And then this voice came. The voice didn't tell me go preach in Puerto Rico or in West Palm, but it changed my heart from what I wanted to preach. So I went and I'll give a little testimony. The Lord just did something marvelous. I'll go into the preaching, but I want to share the testimonies first. Amen. So I went and Friday night I preached the same thing that I preach here. Influence of a godly mother h impact and influence on on the children. And so when I preach one brother who was my friend, brother Jose, brother uh Quinton and brother Jeffrey and brother Mark knows brother brother Rammon he said brother did my wife has my wife spoken to you. I said no. He said okay I'll wait. She would tell you what you were preaching was exactly things were going on and the pastor's wife said brother you don't live in Puerto Rico with us. you are not here with us but you were touching on it things exactly as we going through in the church and our families and things like that among certain family situations that were going on and so the pastor said brother what really touched me is when you said that when our childrens are asleep we should go to their bedroom don't mind let them sleep their way out don't wake them up just go to their bedroom and pray for them lay hands on them don't wait when they are adolescent or they teenagers but when they are babies as early as you can when they draw from the mother's womb if you can start praying for them and that responsibility is on both the father and the mother not only the father only or the mother only said brother that really touched me so we preach on the Friday and the Saturday morning was a minister's meeting so the pastor gave us a topic on holy ghost baptism we were about 12 14 ministers and everyone was coming from the same different angle but the same spirit so Brother Marco, he was the one who opened the the first service. He talked on spoke on how you can never get the Holy Ghost baptism within the denomination. You need a revealed word of the Lord to give you the new birth. Amen. So I went after him and as was preaching there, I already I sent my sermons to him before even I went to Puerto Rico to translate them into Spanish and to put them in in their system. So he said, I preach on same thing. I took it from Adam. Why do we even need the Holy Ghost baptism? Because Adam didn't need a Holy Ghost baptism. If didn't need the Holy Ghost baptism, why you and I need a Holy Ghost baptism? There were three people that never needed the Holy Ghost. Adam, Mrs. Adam, and Jesus Christ. They never needed a new birth. That was not their story. But the rest of mankind from from H from the next person to the last person, we need the Holy Ghost baptism, right? And that's the most important thing in your life. So I pick it from there because of the four. We got a nature. We got a soul that was permitted by God. It was a permissive will of God. It wasn't the original will of God. So that permissible God will never accept permissible. He can let permissible permissible will go on. Yes. But it has to come to an end. And so he has to usher in the perfectable of God. And that is bringing his nature, his soul, his attribute redemption into our heart. Amen. So I pre everybody had 30 minutes to preach. And when I finished, I said, "Brother, you have 10 more minutes." Marco didn't use all his time. You got the anointing was just keep going in and then we kept going and I the Lord brought something from I preach a I pick a scripture from Ezekiel chapter 37. If you want to put that scripture I just want to Ezekiel 37 verse. It wasn't part of what I'm going to preach but I just want to share the testimony. Ezekiel 37:4 to about 28. All right. And it wasn't I had that scripture but as brother Michael was ministering the Lord br something right there. So when he went and I said brother I'm seeing justification sanctification sorry 36 Ezekiel 36 not 37 justification sanctification and battles of the Holy Ghost right in these scriptures that I've never seen. All right. So when we were ministering he translate for me. He said brother you didn't include this things in the poweroint he sent to me. I said yes I didn't have it. He just dropped the Lord just dropped it right when he were ministering. He said, "For I will take from you I'll take from among from among the heathen and gather you out of your countries and will bring you into your land." So that is the Lord justifying you, taking us from the trash can, from the from the Spanish call it basura. Take you from the trash of the world. Wherever the Lord found you, wherever the Lord found me, we were trash. Why were we trash? Not because of the things that you were doing, but because you were born with a nature that was permiss permissible of God. Sin satan in your nature. Amen. And so the Lord has to consume that Satan in our nature to bring the the Christ into our nature. Amen. Amen. Six, Satan Eve cross before God could cross with the earth. Satan already cross the serpent cross before Adam could cross his wife. And God has to uncross. Amen. And then he cross you at Calvary and that brings a new birth. So God taking you from the trash is justification. Verse 20 25. Let's go. Then he sanctify you. He said then I will sprinkle clean waters upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness. From all the idols will I cleanse you. Amen. Amen. And all of us had idols. Right. Idols come is in different way. You can worship your car. You can worship yourself. You can worship money. You can worship job. You can worship profession. You can worship whatever your family. But let nothing come between you and God. Oh Israel, love the Lord thy God with all of your heart, your substance, your spirit, your soul, everything. Amen. Number one, that is your creator. So God cleanses her. Then the 26, let's go there. And said, then I'll put in you. You cannot even agree with yourself. That's right, brother. When you don't have the Holy Ghost. Amen. You get mad all the time. Amen. You get depressed, right? Even good things that is coming your way, you fight it because you can't agree with your own spirit because that spirit is not of of the Lord. And it doesn't give you peace. Amen. Amen. So the Lord has to consume that spirit and put a new spirit. He said, I a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit that I'll put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you an heart of flesh. Amen. Amen. You take away the old, the old soul, the old nature and place himself, the Lord Jesus Christ in you. Then you can agree with yourself and then you agree with the Lord. Then say, Lord, here I am. Amen. Whatever you want to do with my life, Lord, do it. Amen. Amen. And it doesn't end there. Let's go to 27. 27. Then this is the new the Holy Ghost baptism. After 26 uh 26, you still not born again. And if you want to go to future home, said you can have a nice spirit, cleanse, wash, perfect. You don't even have desire to drink anymore. You don't have the desire to do those things. But yet still you don't have the Holy Ghost baptism. Christ is under the inside. Only the cup has been cleansed. If it's not filled, you go up, go back and do the things that you didn't even used to do. You go back to drinking, smoking, cursing, and prostitution, and whatever you didn't even used to do, you go back to it. So being cleansed and justified is not enough. Amen. You need the Holy Ghost baptism. So then the Lord will put his spirit that is he himself will come and dwell in you. And then I'll cause you to walk in my statutes and it connect with what I'm going to preach. When he shall appear, we shall be like him. Not just like him, but we shall be him. Amen. Amen. Glory. And he shall keep my judgment and do them. Then 20 28. Now your promise is your blessing and you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall you shall be my people and I'll be your God. So you and Jesus Christ walking sister as you walking it's not just you. Glory but there's a being if you have Christ on the inside that works within you and even sinners can look at you and they look at you twice. There's something about this lady. That's right. There's something about this coworker. There's something about this neighbor. What is about him? There's a dimension. Amen. She or he might not understand exactly, but there's another person that is working in your flesh. Amen. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Sometime when you are even working by yourself. I don't know you. I believe some of you experience it when you get by yourself in natural environment where there's not noise and all this crazy stuff. Sometime you walk in and you see like somebody's following you. Amen. You see an aura around you. There's somebody but there's nobody following you. There's nobody around. It's a dimension in you that comes out and want to fellowship with you. Amen. Amen. Is there all along but sometime you want a fellowship outside of the as outside of the inside. Amen. I don't know if you make a sense outside of the inside. He's still inside. He does things within but sometime he want to show himself visibly to you to let you know that he loves you. Amen. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord because he's a husband. So the Lord gave us the pastor said, "Brother, keep going. Keep going a little bit." And the Lord bless us and all of us were on the same accord. Amen. And so I want to go back to the to the testimonies. The Lord gave wonderful testimonies on the word and the Lord touched like I said touch on specific situation. And this testimony number three, rainbow didn't happen. It happened before I went there. That was on the 9th of March. I went there the 14th. So, brother Marco actually he put me in in his house and he's a very good friend of mine, him and the pastor and we met first in Cancun, Mexico and said, "Brother, we were there was there was a place around his house which is wooded, beautiful flowers, awesome place." And I like to just look at the place and you could see nature, you know, God is in nature. So, he said recently the the owner of the property came around and he said he wanted to clean up the place and sell it. and said I've of I've always had an interest to possess that place because it's more or less part of my land. So I told the man that yeah I'll buy it. So the man said well if I ready you'll be the first person I'll notify. So brother Marco called his pastor. He's one of the is minister in the church. He called his pastor. He invited people to his home to have a cookout all vegans food. They do different things barbecue but it's all vegan. So they had one of these cookout. I think it was Sunday. And then uh he called a pastor to go and just step out with about six ministers and his wife seven. So they form a circle, put your arms around and they quoted I think u Deuteronomy 24:11 or 11:24 footstep is possession. If you can bring it out for me I think 2411. Let's see. And I said brother this testimony is consistent with where our church is in now. So I want you to record an audio of this testimony so that I can share with the brethren. Amen. So Deuteronomy 24:11 I believe if you can have that scripture. I should have added it. Let's try 11:24. See, try an error. Let's see if that will work. Amen. 11:24, I believe. So hopefully awesome we got now said every place Deuteronomy 11:24 every place 11 is a look at the numbers 11 is a number of perfect standing true disciples of Jesus Christ if you stand in the way of if you become a true disciple of Christ in other words let yourself go and God fill you the Holy Ghost what you you desire God will give it to you it's just like a man marrying a wife you know the desires of your wife and you want to please your wife make her happy. The Lord is greater than your husband. Amen. He want to make you happy more than your husband can ever make you happy. Amen. So he said every place where the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and Lebanon from the river and the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. Amen. So footprints is what? Possession. Whatever you desire, you believe it. It might not be physical land, but it's your desires on your heart. That's right. and imprints the pillar of fire in your heart and you believe it. Amen. And it will come to pass. Praise God. So they form a circle and prayed. And while they pray, let's go to uh the slide. There was a rainbow and there was a whirlwind that came around that was the photo I think. Okay, there you go. So the brothers form a circle together with brother Marco's wife, sister Rosalyn. And as they they saw a white horse that was tied somewhere and when the whirlwind begin to when the pastor was praying started to pray the whirlwind begin to come around them and they didn't know anything about the rainbow not knowing that some of the brothers in the house far away were taking pictures and they didn't know. So they were praying and the war winding came around and the horse who was tied came closer the horse has still got a string and then he came closer to where they were and the the horse bowed its head in prayer. And I will tell you sometime the creation or the animals are more sensitive to the spirit than us. They are more sensitive to it than the human. They don't have a soul. They only operate in the flesh and the spirit. But sometime they can sense the presence of God more than human beings that have goals can sense. Amen. Remember the the the prophet Bam, a whole prophet, but his greed for money and materialism just blinded him. And the Lord brought an angel of the Lord. There was an angel of the Lord before them. Bam didn't see the angel because he wanted to get money. It's about dollars, money, gold, and money. But the horse or the donkey was able to sense that there was an angel and the horse wouldn't move. He was whipping the horse because he wanted to be rich because the king bail wanted to enrich him by cursing Israel. Never curse the body of Christ. Amen. Amen. Do not curse your brother. Do not curse your sister. No matter what he does against you, don't curse your children. Amen. Don't use those word. Amen. Amen. So that the Lord can allow somebody close to you to hurt you so bad. Yes. Remember David? Amen. People spot on his face. Has somebody spat on your face before? I don't think so. But David, a king, a whole king, a prophet, king and priest. And the son of Saul came and spat on his face and call him Bale. Bale means you a serpent seed. That's right. You are the one because the kingdom has taken from the house of Saul to David. And that person didn't like David at all. That's right. So he sp on him and his sold just wanted to kill him said no leave him alone for the Lord asked him to do it like the sermon silence is a wonderful it's a what great weapon so sometimes it's not what you speak it's not what you act let back off and let the pill of fire take control you might be seem like a fool or why you can say something you have to react you have to take this no no no no no your action will escalate things amen Yes. Is not going to solve the problem. You're going to worship him. You're going to make things complicated and sophisticated. But let the Lord have his own way. Amen. And in the silence when you hear nothing when you seem like a fool. When you seem like defeated, the Lord is working. That's right. And the Lord will turn the ties in your favor. Amen. And the right time when you are laying in bed, the Lord will wake you up. And let you have the victory. Amen. Amen. So sometime you don't have to say nothing. Glory. Hallelujah. God. So the the brother took a picture and they saw the rainbow and the whirlwind and brother Michael said brother I believe the Lord has given to me and even if the Lord doesn't give it to me glory to his name. Amen. Amen. Glory hallelujah. Praise God. So uh let's go. And there was another we went to hiking h I think the last but one day on the 17th we went to hiking on the mountain. They call it a yuni. So we didn't go to the top of the mountain this time but we went to one of the historical areas. They have some kind of castles where their old pastor used to go and pray. I think one time he prayed and fasted for the night and the Lord did some supernatural. So they took me to the side and then we went and the whole almost the whole church the elderly women over 70 years. So this time the pastor said the elderly people are going to go ahead of us because when the young people go we run early go and leave the elderly people. So now the elderly people go in front and then the rest follow. So when they get tired we stay, we snack and we keep going. And they say over every year about 12 million uh tourists go to the place. So in the morning we went as early as I think around by 8 some of the parking place were four. You couldn't get a place to park. So we went to this forest where they have magnetic force in the forest. So we went we fellowship we prayed and whilst we were praying they have courts like stones rocks that you can take as trophy. So we were praying you put your arms on the racks and you feel the pool you feel the magnetic force. I think they they said the whole world have three places that they have that magnet magnetic forces. Bamuda triangle somewhere in Florida and that place in Puerto Rico that's where they have that forces. So we went to pray and then as we were praying brother Marco it was a still atmosphere the winds were not blowing and the palm leaves were worshiping whip. So brother took a picture I'll share on the brother's app later. God is in creation. And sometime when you get out away from the crazy life and crazy busy schedule, that's when God can deal with you. God is not far away from us. Amen. He is in us. He is with us. But we are so busy. The noise was in the politics of the day. H just talk about the we don't want to even go into it. And so many things around the world can take you off from what God want to do. But remember our economy is not American economy. Amen. Our economy is from heaven. Amen. It never runs dry. The the dollar can fail. America can fail. The global economy can fail. But Jesus Christ will not fail you. Amen. He can rain rice and beans for you if he has to. You can be walking, you don't have money to buy, and you see a sack of rice. Where's it come from? Is it for somebody? No, it's for you. Amen. For you and your family. Amen. And I I've had it before. When I was in UK, I was going to work and I had a workman. We call it workman those time and I forgot to take batteries and I was sitting in a train. I said, "Oh my." Cuz I love to listen to tape and I said, "I'm going to work for 14 hours and I don't have batteries." And some look under in the seat. I look at the seat. There were batteries. I was sitting on the batteries. Is it for somebody? It's nobody. I grab I think two or three I grabbed them, put in my workman and started listening. Amen. Amen. God is a creator. When he shall appear, we shall be like him. I've not even go to the sermon yet. Amen. Amen. But when God has appeared, you be like him. He has appeared and you are him. Amen. Don't be afraid to stand in your post of duty. What the Lord has called you to be. Amen. The world the world doesn't give the world doesn't care about you. They don't have to ask your permission to do what they do. You think about the world, the cosmos world. Everything they want to do, they do it. There's no shame. Since that were shameful in about 50 years now, it's like, how do I say it? It's like they advertise it. It's free show. Amen. So, you don't have to be ashamed. You don't have to like get permission. You don't have to be parted on on the back of the world before you do what you need to do. Be who God has made you to be. Amen. Don't be ashamed of Jesus Christ. Amen. If you are ashamed of him, he'll be ashamed of you. But accept your call. Amen. You might not be accepted by society, the way you dress. You might not be accepted by your neighbors the way you carry yourself. But be a brother. Be a sister. Be a son of God. Be a daughter of God. Be Mrs. Jesus Christ. Be Jesus Christ. [Applause] God, God has called you to be who you are. Amen. Amen. So, we had a wonderful time on the mountain. Let me see. I don't even have my notebook. Where is there? Glory to God. Just to guide me a little bit. We go to the PowerPoint. So, let's let's uh let's probably read a scripture now. Amen. If you can be on our feet and then read wherever the Lord will take us, we go. Amen. And if the Lord makes a way, we can go forward. So let's read the first scripture from 1 John 3:1-3. That is where the sermon came from. When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him. So Colossians, oh sorry, 1 John, I'm at the wrong place. 1 John chapter 3 verse 1-3. Brother Jack, would you like to read for us? Behold, what man of love hath hath what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved, we now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifith himself even as he is pure. God bless you my brother. Amen. So you may take your seat please. So when he shall this was in the apha age. Apha age was between AD33 and AD55 when the church was the day of Pentecost. This was the foundation when the Lord was building his church. So the lord move upon the heart of John to imprint this word that when he h we don't know what even we because they were stuck they don't know the building is just in construction they were just l the foundation so he said does not yet appear what we shall be but when he shall appear we shall be with him we shall be like him amen and let's read another scripture Colossians 3:1-4 quickly he said if he then be risen with Christ seek those things those things which are above where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Two, set your affections on things above, not on things on this earth. Three, for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. Four, when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory. So first John 3:1 said, "When he appears, we shall be like him and we shall see him at his seat." Because you have the revelation, the eagle revelation. So when you got a revelation of who you are, then you can manifest like him. Amen. And I remember we all remember the story, the eagle story. Abraham talk about that a mother eagle had a eggs and the farmer took one of the eggs and put them under chicken. But the eagle by election know that he has an igllet somewhere. So when the right time came for the mother to go hunt for the igllet, he went around the area, the farms. The igllet didn't know who her mother was. She was just thought her mother was the chicken. They tried to eat worms and whatever they can eat on the ground. But he didn't know no know better. But then when the mother eagle came I mean around in the sky and cry out yell out a cry. Then something on the inside he look at himself. He look at his wings he look at his beak. He look at the mother above. He said now I know my mother. The chicken wasn't my mother. That's right. That's right. Amen. She was just trying to make me believe. Amen. But the chicken is I'm not a chicken. That's right. I'm an iglet. But she's never flown before. He doesn't know how what it means to fly. He got a wings. Maybe when he was in the pen, he tried to fly. The mother, "No, no, no. We don't do this here. Just just walk around. Just clock around. We don't fly here. Don't do that. You can't go that." So he never used the the wings. He didn't know the feathers. He didn't know what it meant for. But then here is mother big igllet in the sky flopping its wings and said daughter fly up higher. He said mom how do you just set your wings and loosening yourself is in you is the law of God in your nature and this igllet lose herself and she begin to flop her wings and flew to where her mother is. When he shall appear we shall be like him and he has appeared and we are him. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And let's go to uh Hosea 6:1. Let's see how the Lord in the dimensions appeared, how he save us. We go to some scriptures and some quotes. Hosea 61-3. He said, "Come and let us return unto the Lord for he has torn and he will heal us. He has smith smitten and he will bind us up." So sometime the Lord who who tears up. It's not the devil. The devil just an action. He's just an executor. He's just acting under orders. The devil cannot attack you, attack your family without permission from the from from the Lord. So don't worry about the devil. Focus on the Lord. Amen. When you focus on the when you focus on the Lord, oh God bless you, brother Quinton, for your sermon. He said, "Don't worship your circumstances. And so then what we do is that we worship the circumstances and leave the Lord behind. Oh my, that was powerful. Amen. If you focus on the devil, the devil want you to focus on him to let you know how big he is. How he can put you down. He can depress you, make you sick. I mean, destroy your family, destroy your marriage, destroy your church, whatever, destroy your business. But when you focus on the Lord, you delete the the devil out of the equation. He's not in the equation. Amen. You know that whatever has happened, the Lord permitted it. And the Lord who allowed a trial, just like the Bible said that he smitten, he let the devil smite you so that the attribute of healing can come out of you. So that something in you can come out of you. Some divine attribute will be made manifest. If the devil didn't strike Jesus Christ, he wouldn't have known that he was a savior. Amen. Amen. So the devil has to strike Jesus Christ. When he was in the the house of h palace of pilot, he said I have the authority to resist. No, you don't have no authority over me. If the pill in me didn't allow it, you wouldn't you you have no authority over me. Amen. And that's where we should come to. Amen. That whatever comes our way, if the Lord didn't permit it, it would never have come our way. Amen. And if the Lord permitted it, he has a way of escape for you. Amen. Yeah. He's trying to do something that you didn't even know. There's a quality in you that has never manifested in your life before. And the Lord is bringing that quality out. And how can that quality out come out without a trial? Amen. Without an affliction. Amen. Of course, we don't have afflictions. Even Jesus, he was 100% human being, right? He he was 100% God and 100% 100% funny. 100% human being. Amen. So when the trial came so became so strong fierce for him he said Lord he prayed he didn't pray to God in the sky God was in him he said Lord father if be your will let this come let this suffering because he could see the demons anointed demons in people coming to what destroy his life and he cherish his life remember when I will come to that sermon but I'm going ahead of myself when he was in the temple preaching and sometime he say certain words let destroy this temple in 3 days I'll raise up and so this a blasphemy this temple was built in 40 years and you going to destroy it and build it one day they pick rocks that's right and then what the flesh it wasn't time ready yet so he dropped the f the cosmos flesh he drop it out and the theophony will be maybe in royal palm or in loxahachi or in Orlando maybe that's where he lives in Orlando and then the flesh will come back to his body. My brother, my sister, that attribute is in you. Amen. That is your rapturing faith. Amen. Everything you need is already in you. Amen. It's not coming from the skies. It's not coming from outside. The kingdom of God is within you. Amen. Amen. So Jesus cried, Lord, let this cup pass over me. And the Bible said that Moses and angels came to minister. Moses and Elijah came around that Lord, please go to Calvary. If you don't go to Calvary, we all doomed. in the whole mankind to strengthen him this almighty God. So there's nothing wrong when you cry but after you done your crying raise up as a daughter of God and speak as a theophony and speak as a redeemer and speak as the Lord Jesus Christ. Cry all you want. Jesus cried. Yes. When Lazarus died his best friend, one of his friend died. He cried. The Bible say and Jesus wept. That's right. That was the only place it looks like we saw that the Bible said Jesus wept because he was a human being. But after he wept, what did he do? He cleaned himself up, dried the tears. And I said, "There's more than crying in me. There's more than pain in me. There's more than defeat in me. There's more than sorry me. I am the pillar of fire." So now he came back into a pillar of fire. He said, "Lazarus, death, grief, cancer, stomach pains, whatever, diabetes, blood pressure, e whatever, whatever you have, menstrual problem. Amen. a a baroness infertility in the name of Jesus Christ just he didn't even have to add the name of Jesus Christ he said depart and Lazarus who was dead 4 days came from the grave amen are you dead four days you are not dead four days amen greater is in you than the the death greater is in you than the world greater is in you than your trials greater is in you than your circumstances glory hallelujah to the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Glory. So as we continue to verse two, he said after two days will he revive us. In the third day, he raises up and we shall live in his sight. Then three, then we shall then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord. If you love him and want to know more about him, his going forth is prepared as the morning. He shall come onto us as the rain as the latter and the former rain onto the earth. Amen. That was a dispensation. God first came h we grew some quotes. God comes three times. The first time he comes to redeem his wife. The second time he comes what? Take what is redeemed. And the third time he comes with his wife. It's just like you buy things from Amazon. When you buy things from online, the moment you purchase, you let your credit card, debit card, whatever you buy it, that laptop, that dress, that shoe, that suit is not doesn't belong to Amazon anymore. It doesn't belong to a third party. It belongs to you. Because your credit card has gone. Your money $100 has been taken. So now, Amazon quickly, you see that it's now going to what? Shipment. So you look at the status, it shipped. You keep monitoring, tracking, ship. Maybe sometime they ship you to some people live in a I would say the hood where when things come in front of your house, the real owner will pick it up. So if you live in the hood, you don't let things come in front of your door because the owner himself or herself will take it take it away. So you let it they send it to Walmart to Burlington to different location then you go grab your stuff. So when you order it, you have redeem it. All right. And then you go to Walmart. They ship it to Walmart. They have some curios over there. You go there and the Walmart people will give it to you. Okay. They look at your right. You go and take whatever your shoes, your dress, your whatever you ordered for and now you bring it home and now what do you do? You don't buy a shoe dress and just leave it in the wardrobe for 10 years. No. Now you have to what? Dress it. And now the shoe, the dress, the the suit has become part of you. and now you walk with it. The Lord does the same thing. The Lord's like buy from Amazon. We were on on on Amazon and the Lord ordered. No, this is my son. This is my thy daughter. Amen. By election, there are a lot of things you could have bought from Amazon. I need to redeem this person from Amazon. She cannot be on Amazon forever. She cannot be sitting in New York or Dallas for forever. She need to be shipped to West Palm Beach. So the Lord goes online from heaven and tell the preacher, "My servant Jagdav, go preach to this person, my servant e brother smiley, go preach to this person." And then you send a word quickly. There's a quickening. Now you begin to move. Amen. It's ordered. The receipt is paid. The price have been paid on Calvary. So from Calvary, Satan has no possession. Amen. Amazon has no possession over you. Amen. Satan has to release you. Just like Amazon has to ship the item to your house. Satan has to release you. And then from there you come, you begin to know yourself. Oh wow. I didn't even know I belong to Jagdav. I didn't know I belong to Sister Bur. All right. I didn't know I belong to sister V. I didn't know I belong to brother Smiley. All right. Because you belong to him. Amen. There were thousands and millions of things on Amazon. But you just buy a Bible. Yes. that by even things that we do natural is by election. You go to the store a lot of dresses different colors but you go pick a particular dress a particular shoe a particular color of toothbrush because that is by election. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory hallelujah to the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now let's go to yes let's go to uh is it Acts 8 26 to 40. Philillip when he shall appear. Now when he came in the omega sorry the alpha age the Lord begin to show himself. Remember the disciple before the Holy Ghost baptism they were doing all kind of the Lord gave them power to heal the sick to pre the gospel but they were not born again. So their behavior shows that they were not born again. They were fighting among one another who is big in the kingdom of God who want to sit on the right hand and the left hand. This woman will come Lord let my children sit on the left hand and different things. Peter will cut somebody's ears but later when they knew their position they were different. Amen. So let's go to uh Actap 8 verse 26 to 40. This about Philip Philip and Ethiopian Enoch. He said now an angel of the Lord said unto Philillip rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. Gaza is where the battle is. This is a desert place. And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian and Enoch, a court official of Candice, Queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of a treasure. He had come to Jerusalem. He was like a treasury secretary. He's got money. So he's come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning seated in his chariot. And he was reading. He was like a private jet. You know, in those time having a chariot is like having a private jet. So this man was loaded. He was well to do and he was a seed of God. Amen. But now he said reading the prophet Isaiah 29 and the spirit said unto Philillip go over and join his chariot. So Philillip ran to him ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked do you understand what you are reading? And he said how can I unless someone guides me and invited Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its sher is silent. So he opens not his mouth. 33 In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth. 34 And the uno said to Philillip about whom I ask you does the prophet say this about himself or about someone else. Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with his scripture with this scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. And as they were going along the road, they came to some water. And the unk said, "See, here is water. What prevent me from being baptized?" 38 And he commanded the chariot to stop. And they both went down into the water. And Philip and Uno, he baptized him. And when they came up out of the water, the spirit of the Lord carried Philip away. And the unk saw him no more. He went on his way rejoicing. But Philillip, this is why I want you to take a note. But Philillip found himself at Azo. And as he passed through, he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Cesaria. This is the English standard version. If you read the Kingdom version, the split raptured Philillip. Yeah. From where he baptized Ethopian Enoch in Gaza to Azatos. Right. Now, the rapturion faith is already in you. Yeah. Exactly. Glory. Hallelujah. Right. Before the foundation of the world, God has ordained you a man of God under his ministry that you get the Holy Ghost baptism. Amen. You are not here by mistake. Amen. Amen. Brother Jack Dove didn't become pastor Doc when he was 20 20 something years ago in his family. No. But as smart didn't become a pastor when he start ministering 20 something years ago. But way before the foundation of the world run through your ancestry your grandparent great grandparent to Adam before even Adam came to earth he was ordained a minister of God to feed you. Amen. Amen. And you can never receive the Holy Ghost anywhere else. You might pass through other ministry but God has ordained you where you get the Holy Ghost baptism. Amen. Amen. And you have to love your pastor, your ministers, because under his wing, you going to get Christ in you. Amen. Amen. The Tubian Enoch didn't get the Holy Ghost baptism under Peter. The Lord ordained Philillip at the right time, at the right place, at the right season. And Philip has to be there. And this man had a desire. is just been going to the temple hearing the same old same old about you know the Messiah is coming Messiah will come and the Messiah has already come and they still read the temple like he's going to come and there was something boiling in his heart because he was an igllet and the Lord said Phillip go speak to him that's right and he went to bring the gospel the good news to this man right and the quickening power began and he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do you want to receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said repent amen and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Young, young, young young sisters, young brothers. If you want the Holy Ghost baptism, old and young alike, repent and be baptized. Have your pastor baptize you in the name of the Lord. And you shall, you don't have to be 30 years before you can receive the Holy Ghost. No, there's not anything like that. You can't be 12 years and receive the Holy Ghost. It's even better when you receive it when you are 12. Amen. So that Christ will keep you from the things of the world. Amen. Amen. Amen. You don't have to wait till 30 years when you've been in jail. You've got felon. You you you've got done all kind of things and then now you receive it. Yes. God will forgive you. But Caesar will always chase you for being a felon. You can't do certain jobs. You can't do certain things because you've got felon on your record. There was a gentleman I was working with. He loved a job and they found out they got a felon. They let him go. He's no longer the person you used to be. But Caesar will always chase after you. Amen. So if you have got the grace to protect yourself even in the worldly things, please repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as your pastor preaches to you, the pill of fire will baptize you. Amen. And you begin to do the things of the Lord. Jesus wasn't he didn't start when he was 30 years. He started 70 minutes. But at the age of 12, the father, the holy ghost quicken him and begin to break bread in the temple. Amen. Amen. So the Holy Ghost when he Jesus appeared when he was on earth he said I will go but I'll come back when I I will not leave you comforters I'll be with you even in you so Jesus was in Philillip who can be raptured Jesus did the same thing Philip and Cody were with Jesus they saw Jesus rapturing himself when the Pharisees Sadducey wanted to stone him and appeared in some place appear and disappear it's just a character of us it's not a mystery amen Amen. We are only growing to understand it. Amen. Sometime people get so toned about rapture. Oh, will I meet the rapture? You are the rapture. Amen. Amen. Rapture is not an event. Amen. Rapture is a person of Jesus Christ. Resurrection is not an event that is going to be a global resurrection one day and all the churches we warm up. Hey, there's going to be resurrection. I'm going to see my grandma. I'm going to see my great grandma. I'm going to see whoever. No, it's not going to be like that. God doesn't work in public show. But the resurrection is already planted in you. Amen. The new birth is in you. Amen. Jesus Christ is in you. Amen. All the blessing that you are praying for is in you. Healing is in you. Amen. The pastor pray for you not because he's putting the healing in you. But the healing is in you. He's anointing your faith to receive the healing that you already have. Glory. Hallelujah. That's why you have to give yourself to the Lord. Amen. Amen. There used to be a time I used to listen Abraham's healing service and when he was praying especially he has to b he said there's here is a religious demon people are educated but a lot of spirit here because people are intellectual in their minds it's a good place like India just one sermon and thousands of people are healed right but in America he has to press himself he has to fight through he has to lift the people I mean encourage them lift them up until he get to a place and now said now it's milky He said if there was a time he said if you can even believe halfway you don't have to believe all the way halfway because God need your your belief your acceptance of him God doesn't force himself but he need you yourself like a woman acceptance a man cannot come and grab you from your parents hey I want to go marry you take you to the church or court and marries you no it doesn't work that way he need your acceptance even if it's unwillingly right the sisters know you need some acceptance amen so God need our acceptance And when you get even halfway, I'm not all that sure. I'm not sure about this Holy Ghost experience. I don't know how it's going to do to me, but I could see it. I feel good. Amen. I don't go to the clubhouse. I don't drink. You go to the clubhouse. You come depressed. You want to commit suicide. Because you go with few demons and you go and carry more demons. Cuz all the people in the clubhouse have got spirits. That's right. And you go dancing and think you are happy. Yes. You get excited. You dance, you come back and those demons are hunting you. You are depressed, suppressed, oppressed, and you feel suicide. I want to take your life. You don't want to live anymore. But God want to bring you and sprinkle waters of living waters and wash these demons out of your life and he the pillar of fire, the almighty God plant himself in you, my brother, my sister, and you become a new creation. You are not the old person that used to be, but everything is new. Amen. When you are walking, is Almighty God working? Amen. When you speak, it's not your word. It's Jesus Christ speaking in your heart. Amen. And that's what God is doing in our lives. You are not a mistake. Amen. [Applause] All right. You are not an accident. It doesn't matter how you were brought on this earth. That's right. It doesn't matter how you were brought on this earth. It doesn't matter how many mistakes you've made. Amenus. Your mistakes can never delete your election. [Applause] Thank you, Lord. All your sins, all your mistakes can never delete your election. It will never delete your calling to Christ. Amen. Neither your righteousness will bring election to your life. It's just fulfilling it. Look at Moses, a brother of God. His mother educated him. But Moses end up killing someone. He was a murderer. But he defeated himself. He ran away. But even in his runaway status, God was using him. He didn't. He wanted like he thought like I'm failed. God is going to use Aaron, Joshua, some of the brothers to do the job. I'm a failure. When the right time came, the pill of fire appeared. Moses. Moses. Right. Yeah. The ground you are standing is on holy ground. Amen. Right. He said, "Remove your shoes." What shoes? Not just the physical shoe, but remove your thinking. Praise God. Delete those thinking. That I'm a murderer. I cannot do this. I called you before the foundation of the world. God. Amen. God doesn't deal with legalism. God knows we are human beings. We make mistakes. We It's part of human life. But when you make David made all bunch of mistakes but never took his predestination away. Amen. Even his mistakes when he committed adultery and committed murder on top, God will show mercy unto David because David has a job on earth that nobody on this earth can do the work of David. God will not use his son Solomon to do that. No, he's not going to use Aaron to do it. He's not going to use Noah. David has to do the job. My sister, my brother, it doesn't matter how far you gone. It doesn't matter your past record. what the Lord has ordained for you. No, your mistakes cannot delete that election. God elected you to that position and you and only you can fulfill that position. And it's time to rise up and say, "Lord, here I am. Send me. I'll go." Amen. Whatever you want you to do, whatever my sister, in your home, in your neighborhood, in the ministry, whatever the Lord want you to do, my brother, you are the one who's doing the job. Amen. Amen. God never said David because you have seen enough. You have seen so much I cannot use you. No. He said you a priest, king and a prophet. Right. William Ram was a boxer. Is that right? He could have even the Lord just protected him. He could have been become a murderer. He was short-tempered person. That's right. Nobody had tempered like him. That's right. But he was a prophet of God. God used him just the same. Amen. Amen. So God is not looking at your mistakes and don't look at your mistakes and don't look at your brothers and sisters mistakes. Look at Christ in them. Amen. That God has called my sister to do this job. Amen. Cuz if you they said if you point one finger on someone, the four fingers point back to you. Amen. So you think you are so righteous. No. If God should show you your record, you were by grace. Amen. Amen. It it happened to William Abraham. He was condemning a a woman and the Lord showed him his record. He said, "Oh Lord, just forgive me." Amen. So do not point fingers on somebody. You cannot. You didn't even call yourself. Remember the Bible said the one who felt righteous went to pray. Oh Lord, you know me. I pay my tithe. I come to church every Sunday, Monday, whatever. Lord, I'm righteous. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't curse. And the Lord didn't listen to his prayer. But the one who went, Lord, he didn't even look at the sky. I said, "Lord, you know how unworthy I am. Just be merciful." And the Bible said his prayers ascended to heaven. So don't don't justify yourself and disqualify your brother or your sister. No. It is the Lord who justifies. That's right. If the Lord called you and qualifies you, do you think the Lord cannot call your brother and sister and qualifies him? Amen. Cuz you are only using your mind and some things that you know. But God is calling. It's not about you. Amen. It's about him and the person. Amen. Amen. You don't have nothing to do with it. Amen. You have to answer to your calling. Amen. And your brother and sister answer to their calling. Amen. Amen. Amen. So never speak yourself out of the calling of God. Glory to God. Hallelujah to the Lord. Sometime we don't even understand each other. The Lord look at Philillip. The Lord just started revival in our human. Phillip, you should I mean you should leave this man. You just give him the word. You should probably go with him and start a church in Ethiopia. But the Lord wanted him for that purpose. That's right. And he needed him in aos. Amen. And sometime we wonder why this sister, he was supposed to be here, but the sister is not doing this, he's doing that. Why is this brother? Why is this minister? The Lord put desire in our heart. And when you finish that calling or that service or that purpose, the Lord take it away and then put something else in your heart to do. So you might think why am I not seeing this brother doing this? Why don't I see this sister doing this? The Lord has changed the ministry. Amen. And there's a ministry called the frontier ministry. Philip had a frontier ministry. The frontier ministry is the pace setters. Wow. That was when God was ushering the Holy Ghost on earth. The true Holy Ghost baptism. Since Adam when the fall came, nobody has ever been born again. Even the prophet, they had a spirit in type. They had a I would say Old Testament Holy Ghost. But Christ coming to wash away the sin from their heart. That's why David, a man after God's own heart, could cause commit adultery, kill because the new birth wasn't there. Look at Peter. When the new birth wasn't there, he could cut somebody's ears. But when the Holy Ghost came and they arrested him, they wanted to kill him. Said, "Don't worry. I'm not going to run away. I'm ready even to to to seal my testimony with my with my blood. But I have one request. I'm not worthy like my Lord. Turn me upside down." That's right. Yeah. My god. The simpler who had a knife, he's got a pocketk knife in in his pocket. You mess with him, you're going to lose one of your ears. But this man is a different person all together that he offered himself. You could crucify me. Glory. Look at Paul when he was Saul. You don't he rather come and attack you and kill you. Yes. Because you are preaching the name of Jesus Christ. But when he was full of the Holy Ghost and even a prophet, what's the name? Agabus prophesied the Holy Ghost come on Agabus said I saw a man whose robe this man if you go to Jerusalem going to kill you say oh my I'm not discouraged I'm ready to go because he had a pill of fire in him when the pill of because he know heaven heaven is not I oh am I going to make the rapture Lord Paul he said I'm not worthy even to be called an apostle because I wasted the church of God and when they were killing is it Steven I took the clothes you know they used to wear those clothes so that the young people could stone Steven. So I'm not worthy. I'm a medra. He parttook. That's right. Aiden and Abbertan. That's right. When you commit a crime, not this, but you parttook in some way. We call it Aiden and Abbertan. Said I'm a medra. But God has made you who I am. His med didn't take his election away. He said even I work more than Peter. You walk with the Lord. You at with the Lord physically. You slept with the Lord on the beaches. You got a chance to see almighty God in flesh and blood. Yeah, I didn't get that chance. But by grace, Amen. I've worked more than what you you guys have done because Peter wasn't was a little bit legalistic. He didn't want to go to the Gentiles. Probably that's why the Lord sent Philip to go and baptize the Egypian, you know, because Peter had like, you know, these people eat they eat chicken. You know, those animals were not worthy. They eat ducks, they eat pigs, brother. To me, go touch them and baptize them. That's not holy. That was that's Peter's makeup. Yeah. So God used Philillip to do the job. God brought Paul on the scene. Paul knew how to walk with the Jews and also how to work with the Gentiles. If he has to cut his hair to be like the Jews, you do it. But he said, he told Peter, I said, Peter, you were supposed to be blamed because you are plain hypocrite. He said our fathers even couldn't carry the law. Why are you taking the law? Circumcision, don't eat chicken, washing hands. Whatever you touch, you pray about it. It's clean. You don't have to do those rituals. to wash your hands. If by faith you touch it, it's clean. Amen. Amen. If I've got faith in the time of COVID to go pray for somebody, if your faith allows you, you they have CO, they have got a germs and a virus and whatever. But if you got a faith in you, that that COVID spirit cannot touch you. Amen. You can go and pray for the person with CO and the Lord will heal him. Amen. So we walk by faith and not by sight. Amen. We don't worship circumstances. We worship the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah to the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's go a little bit further. Now, let's go to the next uh quote is Jesus. Okay, I think I've gone too far. Go to the next one. Let me see. There you go. Jesus comes three times. H this was dity of Jesus Christ. Paragraph 40. Jesus comes three times. He came the first to redeem his church. He comes the second to receive his church. He comes the third with his church. Everything in the Bible travel in trinities. But in all but all in one Christ. He remember the first time to redeem his church, the second to receive his church, the third with his church as king and queen. God reigning in you. Amen. Let's go to the next code. Okay. uh questions and answers 54 paragraph 104 Christ comes the same thing Christ comes three times the first he came to redeem his church is that right the second he comes to receive his church your Amazon product that you bought you have to when you order it you you've redeem it and then when you drop in in front of your door or in receive it go receive it and then now he brings home and use it so the third he comes with his church he comes to redeem her he comes to rapture her and be caught way in the time of place and so forth returns back for the millennium lives to the millennium. Amen. A millennium is a just time element. So God has got three steps of redemption from Adam to Jesus Christ. That was God coming to redeem his church. Blood sacrifices under Moses. I mean till Jesus died on the cross. That was the last time you could sacrifice animals. But when Jesus said it is finished, it's over. Just before Jesus said you could still sacrifice an animal and God will use that. But when Jesus said it is finished, those animal sacrifices were over. If you sacrifice a lamb, a a cow, a whatever, God hasn't accepted cuz the lamb of God has been sacrificed on Calvary. So that ministry has been done away and put in a closet. And now the second ministry to receive it, that's the Holy Ghost baptism. Under the apha church ministry, God used Peter AD 20 AD 33 to AD 53 20 year ministry. When the Holy Ghost fell, 5,000 people, 3,000, they were going through all Judea, Jerusalem and preaching the gospel and the Holy Ghost fall upon the people and people that didn't know God now they spoke in tongues. They God was manifesting in them. That was the time that God was receiving his church under seven church age messengers. But now after that on sunset mountain that ministry it doesn't mean you can't have holy ghost but the ministry of the son of man son of man is Adam to Jesus son of god Jesus to sunset mountain and then son of David god reigning in our hearts glory hallelujah let's jump quickly let's go to the next one I love these quotes oh my it's just rich this one the new birth let me see yeah the new birth is your rapture Christ in you you And when Paul said Christ in you, the hope of glory, the building is is just in in the fundamental stage is not been built yet. So they were hoping that the capstone. But we can read it differently. Christ in you expression of glory right now. Amen. It's not in future, it's now. Hallelujah. So questions and answers 95403M paragraph 106. said, "If you are filled with the Holy Ghost baptism this morning and God's power is moving in every fiber of your body, okay, your being, what good will it do for you to stand in the judgment?" That's the question. You are already jed been received, filled, and already, now he put it, he says it twice, already already translated into heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Amen. Not you will be, you are, you are now. Amen. Right now translated. Amen. Right. What is the rapture? Translation. Amen. I think one time they asked my brother a question. He said, "It's just a change." That's right. It's just a change. Amen. It's not something you imagine. Our mind can imagine so many things, but it's not imagination. It's the reality of Christ in you. If Christ need to let's say they send military to come and crush all of us, the Holy Ghost can break the flesh and all of us will be in uh Africa, in Asia, in New York. And when all of us are going to New York, remember we're just in West Palm. It's nothing difficult with the Lord. Amen. The same God that heal your body is the same God that can change your body. Amen. It's nothing strange. It's nothing we imagine. But when we're the denominational churches, the way they preach and we still preach the same rapture. I mean, as we were preaching the denominational church, no, the rapture is what? Christ in you. Amen. It's not an event coming from the sky. Resurrection is what? A person of Christ in you. Glory. Hallelujah. And if you can take it, let's go to the next quotes right quick. And that was Christ coming three times. He said future home 64 paragraph 374. Now God made three Bibles. There's a primary teaching that is bogus. That is nonsense. But there's a genuine pyramid. Notice God, God first Bible, he made three. There have to be everything in three because three is perfection. Jesus Christ come three times. Come once to redeem his bride. Next time to get his bride, next time with his bride. Amen. Now let's go to the next quotes. And that is going to talk about the Aquarius ministry, the eagle ministry that we are we are in. And we wrap it up quickly. The re the revelation of Jesus Christ 60204m 190. So when he was on earth let drink some water. Glory hallelujah. Amen. When he was on earth he was a prophet. The faithful witness. The Bible calls him later. A faithful witness is this prophet. He was a priest. He's a priest. Now, when he comes, he'll be a king. 191. If you go, if you get over, read Revelation 15:3. You can see in Revelation 15:3. Let's turn over here and see. He's going to be a king. If he's a king, if he's king when he comes. Now, we are going to Revelation 15. And they sang a song of Moses, the servant of the Lord. A song of the lamp, saying, "Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways. Thou king of saints." Yeah. So Moses was intro they were introducing another ministry in the lamb ministry. The lamb has sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh shed his blood. But now he's coming to redeem. He's coming to grab what is already redeemed and live in him. The day of Pentecost when he redeem us, he didn't leave us there but he said I'll be with you even in you. Amen. Glory. Let's go further. Amen. He said on earth same paragraph or same book on earth he was a prophet in glory. He's the priest. He said, "Where is glory?" Heaven is in your heart. That's right. Don't look at heaven in it's a dimension you don't see with his eyes. Let me quickly go to the quotes. He said he coming. He's a king. Oh, I like that. Prophet, faithful witness of the word, priest with his own blood before God. King. King of saints. Not king of the world now, but he's a king of saints. Right. Right. And I want this to sink in. We have an earthly kings over them people. But we have a king too and a kingdom. That's the reason we act different. So God is king and where's that king ministry? Son of David ministry. God and throne. Not in the White House, not in Birmingham palace, not somewhere in African kings. Amen. But it's Sarah in your heart. Sister cab in your heart. Amen. Amen. My sisters in your heart. God is enthroned in the heart. He's your king. Amen. Glory to God. He's my king. The world will not see that kingship, but you see it. Let's go on now. Revelation. Let's go to next next uh reading. Awesome. Revelation chapter 1 fulfilled on sunset mountain. And what is revelation 1? Let's just verse 7 say behold he's coming with clouds and every eye will see him even those who pierce him. All the tribes of the earth will on on an account of him even so. Amen. When it came to the three there were satellite h there were computer system that were watching him in Canada, US, Mexico. And if you go to the what's it called? Uh is it hall of fame? They have the the pillar of fire. When even Obama Barack Obama became president and they took him there he watched he looked at it and he said I want to take a picture with it. Oh wow. Earthly president. He saw that this is something supernatural. They took Barakuba took a picture with a cloud. Wow. It doesn't matter what other people will say that it was a jet plane that wasn't true. Don't go for that. Don't let those things sink in your mind. Wow. But focus on Christ. Amen. Don't worry about William Arab. Worry about Jesus Christ. Did this message transform your heart? Amen. Amen. Did it transform your heart? Yes. If this message transform your heart, why do you have to worry? So don't worry about what people say about William. Don't worry about what people say about Paul of Tasos. He was a murderer, but he was he was still the servant of God. Amen. So don't let that disturb you. An iota. But focus on Christ. Amen. So let's see. Uh what is attraction on the mountain? 65 725 725 if paragraph 147. And I love this. He said everything that shall never die. What else will never die? Everything else dies? Eternity. Amen. It's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being what? Jesus. To the picture being what? Jesus standing looking at us said brother I was not born 65 so why can how can Jesus be looking at me I wasn't born 65 either and so even those who were born in 65 they were not on sunset mountain that's right they were in West Palm Beach they were somewhere else right looking at us sister cal was looking at you sister five probably you were here sister brace but they were not on sunset mountain so how And you said be like me. Wow. You have to think a little bit. Amen. Let pause here. The Bible said we were in him before the foundation of the world. But we were just born some few years ago. So how can we be in him before that? Not this flesh. This is a dust. It's talking about the person that dwells in you. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's finish this. Said Jesus. Let me see where do I get to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us and now exactly on sunset mountain and sunset light the evening light has come vindicating himself what is it is the father God and Christ are one the white how many seen it with a white wig upon him as we talk in revelation chapter one so this is the prophet own word that revelation chapter one is a white wig just as we read that behold he comes with clouds and every I eye of revelation presented seed shall see him. Every is different from all. When you say every is a selection or is all in inclusive so in English language every is not sometime we use it interchangeably but they don't mean exactly the same. So every one of my children so it refer to children. All of you, everybody, if you say all, everybody inclusive, but everyone of the predestination predestinated shall see him is the fact they said now the supreme deity authority, no other voice, no other god, no other nothing. In him dwells the fullness of the god, godhead bodily. The angels themselves was his works. The seven angels were the ws of Jesus Christ. That is supreme authority. Let's go to the next one. your thoughts materialize into reality. The pastor in Puerto Rico gave me this quotes when I preach the Sunday service I was preaching I said sometime you don't have the time to pray not everything going to have time to go on your knees go to your class say go to brother Jack please I need this prayer the situation demand instant answer you don't have time to call your mom your dad your brother your children to pray no you don't even have time to pray at that moment so what are you going to do I'm going to cry oh lord no You speak think the thought and that's where this code the thought in your heart when you just let a the Lord wash all the rubbish out of us or the trash can and then we committed ourself to the lord your thinking is a thinking his thinking is your thought so let's look at this quote your thought materializes into materialize into reality the word became flesh Indian trip report uh 54103M paragraph 183 and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy when you empty yourself amen then you then will you be when the church in its power of resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say when the church dies but I said when the church empties himself of the things of this world will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving Amen. You see what I mean? Congratulations say sermon. Then your thoughts will become worse and your words will become material. That's when the church in its power. Amen. Amen. My brother, my sister, I don't know what else to say. Amen. That is where the Lord is leading us. Let's keep on reading this right quick. I don't want to take too much time. Par Let's keep on the same paragraph, the same message. Is that paragraph 184? I believe it's on the road. It's on the road. It means it's in action. When a car is on the road, it's in it's not station. It's on the road. That's when the church will be so wrapped up in Christ. Not wrapped up in the world, not in politics, not on YouTube, not on our jobs, not on gossip, but in what? Christ. The Holy Spirit. Mankind so away from them theirelves that they don't see themselves. They don't have no they have they but to serve God. They don't have nothing else but to serve God. And their thoughts move on. They refuse the things of the world. They just move in the spirit. Live in the spirit. Move in the spirit. Walk in the spirit. So fulfill the law of Christ. Then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost. The great wonderful church will go forth with power and dity. Amen. Dity of who? Christ. Amen. Because dity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit. Amen. Bringing to pass the thought, not the thought of God's mind, the thought of who? Their mind. And I want this one to seek in the thought of your mind. Because the mind is not Kokus's mind anymore. It's not brother Jagdal's mind anymore. It's not Ser's mind anymore. It's not S Brown's mind anymore. But it's the mind of Christ. And that mind of Christ has become your mind. But the keepers that become your mind that becomes your mind. Amen. And Satina when you think sister harmony little sister shalom that thought is no longer your teenage mind. It's not your mind but the mind of Jesus Christ has become you the little sister. And when you are walking in school, walking in the neighborhood, walking on the street, it's no longer sister shalom and sister harmony, but it's Jesus Christ on your heart, on your heart. And it doesn't matter how young you are. When you speak, your word become materialized. Amen. And that's what the Lord want to make, brother Joseph. That's what the Lord want to make you. Amen. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. And the next verse, thank you, Jesus. Victory and victory in abundance is yours. Receive the blessings of the Lordise and desires your heart be granted to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Shall we be on our feet? Amen. So we want Lord take our own mind and let the mind of Christ be in you. And I want us to go and ponder over these things that God want his mind to be your mind that when you speak is not Jesus because Jesus has become you. Amen. Shall we pray? Our heavenly father we thank you this day. Jesus, we bless you for what you've done for us. We appreciate, Father, your word is life is light.

When he shall appear, we shall be like him. Thank God for the word of the Lord as it came from uh his servant today, brother Quu. uh so much for us just to kind of process there and um I love that thought on you know your mistakes can't delete your election it can't delete your election and and and sometimes the devil reminds us of all the things that you did this you did that ain't got nothing to do with my election and uh God saw me perfect before the foundation world and I'mma walk right into that so we we thank God what a what a what What a wonderful thought. Amen. What a wonderful wonderful thought. I just loved how he said how the Lord gave him that in a in a dream and you know and it's just amazing God would just quicken a sermon like that and and um and how the Lord would just lead him just to kind of go down this this path for us today. I know we all leave here encouraged. I know we all leave here strengthened. Amen. and by the word of the Lord and um all these other voices that are out there talking, let's forget about them and only listen to what the voice of God, Amen, is speaking about us. Uh I was just sharing with some brothers over the past few days and and we were talking uh politics because there's a great voice there in politics. But we were talking and it was asked me say brother you know um people feel that um uh Camala Harris was the fulfillment of brother Random's um vision the sixth vision that he had. And I said, "Yeah, brother. I feel that way, too." You know, that she he said there would be a woman vice president or president or it would be the Catholic Church. I say she came dressed in purple, everything. She was the vice president voted in by the United States. I say and then there was a time where the president had to go in for surgery and they had to swear her in as president for the hours that he was underneath surgery. So really the prophecy was fulfilled in multiple ways. I said but there's one other prophecy and brother Brandham said the seventh pro prophecy was that we were going to see debris all over the land of the USA. And I believe there are some things that are happening that are setting that up for us to see. But however, for me, I don't want to be here. I don't want to stay here while all that's happening. I'm believing when he shall appear, I'm going to be just like him and I'll be changed in a moment, in the twinkle of an eye. Hallelujah. If God call Lot out of Sodom, God going to call us out of here. Praise God. Amen. So, we're expectation, church. Amen. There's a rapture, amen, that is taking place right now. We're part of it right now, being changed even right now by the by the word of God. And we want to continue that change until we're changed right on out of here. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother Quu. Thank you so much. Amen. For bringing food for our souls today. Glory to God. Let's have a word of prayer. Amen. As we prepare to dismiss you, Father, we thank you for your word that has come to our hearts. Lord, we just appreciate Amen. your servant just getting himself out of the way that Lord, you could use them to minister to us on today. Father, uh what an encouraging word. We we shall when you shall appear, God, we'll be just like you somehow someway. You'll transform us. You'll change us, oh God, and we'll be in your very image. We're going through the process even right now, Father. That just the the thoughts that he presented there through your prophet, Lord, you bringing to pass even the thoughts of our minds, Lord. What a powerful place to be in that you would bring those those thoughts to pass. We have to have the right thoughts. We have to have the right thinking, oh God, for you to be able to do that. So change our hearts, oh God. Change our our minds and change our beings, Lord. make us more and more like you, Father. Help us to hear your voice. Speak to us, Lord, and transform us, amen, into your image, Father. God, I pray your blessings upon the people as they leave this place, but not your presence. Father, we know every ear that, Amen, was here today and those that heard online, God, you had a special word for them. And I pray we'd walk in what was given to us, Lord, on this day. We pray, Father, that you would keep us until we're able to come back together again on uh Wednesday night. May the spirit of the Lord meet us here once more, Father, is our prayer. We're careful to give you all the honor. We're careful to give you all the glory. We're careful to give you all the praise. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Praise the Lord. Amen. You can be seated. The brothers will come. The thing that I said, I forgot to tell y'all earlier. I I remember it. The Lord brought it back to my attention. We want to thank the Lord for touching Sister Cobb and bringing her back to her instrument. Amen. God is good. Amen. We shall be like him.
