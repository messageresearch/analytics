swelling thereof Salaam there is a river of the streams where else shall make glad the City of God the holy places the Tabernacles of a Most High God is in the midst of hers she shall not be moved God shall help her and that writerly the heathen raged akeno's our ruler fee ever destroys the earth melted the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge Salah come behold the works of the

and when you get the opportunity that would tell you don't say that no no no say something that somebody might be blessed by what you got the same so a man anybody want to share alright praise the Lord hey man thank you [Music] in in my and in my life when my children were younger and this one particular lady we were talking about we had not seen this lady for like maybe 10 12 years and I was asking her I said oh she has to be dead by now because she was so old in but it was like somebody was stuff that his lady like blue but she loved my children and that was at nine nine o'clock in the morning at 11 54 I walk into one of my doctor's office I walk in say hello to everybody and I walk out and this lady sitting right in front of me and I said and she looked at me she said I see you looking at me I say you miss Valley she said yes I said oh my god and I'm screaming inside these people dogs life I said oh my godness Valley my daughter and I was just talking about you and I thought you with did she say no I'm alive and I said well thank God and I was just telling her how precious she was to me and she was to my children and she said that is so good she said let me see I was pretty big I said do you remember her she said I'll come on forget though and I was just saying God I thank you because it was just a desire of my heart to go back to her to tell her thank you but I knew she was not at that school anymore and just to know that she was still alive and she remembered my girls that was a blessing to me and I just say God I thank you for just even loving me just that much to just hear the conversation between my daughter and I and that you you fulfill the heart's desire for me and I just thank God for that and then another part of a testimony I want to give is um last tape service I came in on the end of the service and brother Jack was giving his testimony about some little boy had gotten hit across the street and he just had started praying for the little boy but by the time you know things I ended the little boy had came out of the ambulance well one morning I was walking into work and one of the girls at work she just started screaming and kind she just fell into my arms and I'm looking like okay what is the problem and she says my niece my niece um was in an accident and she's in ICU my niece and her I guess was her cousin my sister-in-law excuse me and so I was just trying to console her and it was just like a second and everybody else was just standing around and I say excuse me you guys don't know but you will know by now I believe in prayer and I said if you don't mind and if you do you won't you'll have to wait till after I finish this because she's really upset and they said no we don't mind so I just started praying for her and as I pray for her I just went into a mold just telling them what to do and I'm like Laura don't even know if I'm telling these people the right things to do I said but you need to get yourself together if you go into the hospital you know I was just doing all that and by the time I was leaving on I say now you believe and what I just pray for you but you have to believe it she said I will I will and so I told the other I'm young lady that was there I said can you just keep me updated on how everything go 15 minutes from leaving that office from leaving Jupiter on Center Street to get before I got to i-95 on Donna Rosa Road she called me and she said Michelle she don't have to go to the hospital her niece is being released I say from ICU she was in an accident that world over seven kinds off of i-95 I said so the power prayer works and I was just thanking God I was telling Sheree I was just thinking god I didn't see if I was just and then quiet and just been praying in my soul and not they would have never known the power of prayer so the next one and I went in there so the other young lady say she said you don't have prayer thing you do we gonna call you for that more often so y'all know me I say did you know that prayer thing I do I'm gonna teach you how to do that she say it works if you believe so and you know and I just thank God because they always look and say you're always so happy and I always tell them why I'm happy there's the joy that the Lord is my strength you know everything like that but then people really just need to actually see faith in action and when they saw faith in action that particular day it was a really testimony for me to let me know that my life is truly shining I feel like it is so dim and it does not just reflect anything other than me being happy me wearing a skirt or you know just me doing anything I said but God I actually get to witness and see you in action these people know that they don't have to just come to me and just say will you pray for me about this I can actually stop and say to you now let's pray right now and I'm gonna show you how to pray but you have to believe you good I could believe all I want to but you have to believe in the power prayer so I just thank God and I just really just thank God for him being my Savior so thank you so much I certainly appreciate that soon we gonna be the only Jesus that some people see they say the scriptures say that we are limping he Pistols rap by all means range so praise the Lord we certainly appreciate that sister Michelle and man all right good evening how y'all doing all right I just wanna I just want to thank first of all that my kids here tonight and it's a pleasure having them here I mean I really enjoyed it president but uh I just want to give God thanks for just the power prayers will and just you know just showing herself strong because uh last week Thursday I went to the rehearsal and then the situation happening and with my oldest daughter here so I just I went to grab passed I said uh can you come pray with me I said when you pray right now there's a situation going on and I know it's just the the hand of the enemy because God has opened so many doors for me and my family and I'm just grateful for but you know the enemy don't like seeing that so he showed up and I got past and we pray you prayed a quick prayer so then of course you know I know that sometimes things gonna get worse before they get better I mean everybody knows not go none of us had a flowery bed of ease so this soon as we prayed I went back in church thinking okay we prayed about everything all right I get another call they had to take it to the hospital so and we weren't even sure who she was gonna come back home that night so I was like oh uh Tracy xB uh could you call the kids because they're not Alyssa's not handling it will so I like hard I'll call well before the college ADA called me and he was so calm hey daddy how you doing I'm not good I hear her in the background just you know throwing a tantrum so I was like let me talk to us so then I was like I was talking to my father-in-law and I was like you know what do you need me to come up there and he was like yeah let me ask Tracy like all right so she said yes I went up there and I mean even though we didn't know what the outcome of the situation was I went up there and got both of them too and all we did is went to McDonald's I had ice cream but they calmed her down they they we started laughing joke and it changed the whole atmosphere of situation and then when they got the ice cream we talking I mean she still she's still upset and everything and we're just talking and I didn't do much talking I did most of the listening but I let them talk and you know just you know get whatever was only hard and you know just then they start talking about you know different things they were going through and all of a sudden we went from crying to laugh and enjoying each other so then not too much after I got a phone call said alright you could take them home we on our way home so they released care everybody was home I told them they were happy I just thank God that he just he's always there I mean when every situation like if you seek him first he'll make sure he make his presence known and I'm just thankful whoa ladies I appreciate that testimony Lord just spoke to me now there's a word there's a word and our English language is pronounced the same the spell different and that word is presence now that's PR d SE NTS you can you can present presence or PR es e NCE is just being present and and what uh what we what we saw expect that just demonstrated there is just the calming presence not just gifts right but the calming presence of a father and that that is immediate right so that that meant a lot a lot and and I tell you what even that spoke to me I got it I got it not just bring PR e SPMTs but I gotta be PR es es de all right [Laughter] if anybody wanna testify yes sir we got one here we got Louisville in here okay so I'll just want to give honor to the Lord Jesus and then recognize that sometimes the Lord comes on the scene when you don't really even asked him to do it but he's ever giving he's a giving God and he takes care out needs and he provides for us and I say that because I went home here recently I think it was Sunday and I came back I went home to take care of some things for my dad and we went to visit them in the hospital my brother and I my brother flew from Texas of course I flew from Florida and we met and we cleaned up some things and we met my dad at the hospital one I think it was on Tuesday the speech therapist came in while we were there and that was that my dad has speech therapy because of his stroke so his vocal cords were damaged and he had to have therapy every day for that but it was it's been a very tenuous relationship between my dad and the speech therapist he's had two different ones and that that that has been a very difficult time for him to have to come in for the therapy and you have to do exercises and she goes through these things and he was getting frustrated at some point he didn't want to even talk to her anymore and they said some things and he was and so me and my brother were trying to calm him down because he had to get ready for a test on today and in order for him to not have speech therapy anymore he has surpassed test this this bærum test that it was today and so we were trying to encourage him and telling him to practice what that she was saying and I even called her to arrange for the time for them to meet because he what she was show up and he would say I can't do it and he did it like three times so she was getting frustrated and so after after I coordinated that and I flew back on Wednesday and right when I flew back on Wednesday they called me he had a doctor's appointment with a cardiologist and he went to the appointment and the doctor saw his lake was swollen and he was having shortened a brett shortness of breath and then they rushed him to the emergency room again and so when they got there they determined he had a congestive heart failure so this was on wednesday and so they were doing what they need to do put a IV in and give it him some Daryl some lasix Durrett to reduce the liquid to bring out the liquid in his body and see what it was going through that process and I was and I knew based on what they were saying that he was maybe there for a while and so his haunt meant for the speech oh the bærum test was today and so he's in the hospital then that was going to be very challenging for him to try to make it because they won't be able to release him from the hospital so I called the nurse at the facility that he's staying at and I was like hey I'm really concerned about him not being able to make that test and I know that you probably gonna have to reschedule it and she said well let me let me and I said I was I told her about the relationship that was challenging and I think that may have stressed him too to cause him to get him because dishing that he's in with his heart and all of that is because he was very under stress with that whole situation it was very taxing on him and and so she said okay let me go and talk to the speech therapist and let me go and talk to some folks and I'll get back with you and so she called me back I think it was yesterday and she said hey I I called the hospital and asked them to ask the doctor there to put her order in so he could take the tests there at the hospital and I was like really she's like yes so I said oh great so I called the nurse and I talked to the nurse that at the hospital there she said yeah I'll put the order again but I don't know if it's gonna you know if they're gonna do it or not but I put that the order is in I said well did you tell him yet it was like no I didn't tell them yet I said she said well he's gonna have to not eat after 12:00 midnight I say well you're gonna have to tell them so because you know as you as we get older it's a challenge when we say something's going to happen in the end it doesn't happen right so that's what I was trying to manage that aspect of it too because if it didn't happened in he was like well you know I would get a phone call so so she put the order in and then she went over I mean she she went and told him and so he called me because I hate you know what they're gonna do they gonna let me take the test tomorrow I said he said I use that you really I say oh yeah yes I said yeah I know you know so you can't eat after 12:00 you say oh you know I say yeah yeah yeah yeah I talked to some people or whatever though so he was like all this idea I'll say okay great I said then you know you gotta pass this test he said yeah I know I said you want if you don't want to see that that speech therapist no more you need to pass this test you have yeah I gotta pass this test and also there's this this he's in skilled nursing right now so this this this speech therapy thing has been preventing him from going to assisted living within the visit of a facility so it kind of it was and hit that he was wanting to move as well but this thing was just holding it was like a cloud over his head like and so so after he we talked a little bit and you know say well you know get some rest and then let me know what happened so he called me today he called me today and he was like guess what I passed my test ladies what happy I just want to thank God give God the praise I mean I didn't really talk to the Lord about it so much but I did pray about it some last night but even in the short prayers God comes on his hand and answers and gives us a good desires of heart so thank you praise the Lord for that thank God for answering the prayer I like to thank God first more than anything to even being a you know in this place to even give a testimony you know so and I know I had to give a testimony especially the voice and actually know what's going on so I actually started working this week early Monday what happened prior to that what happened prior today on the same company had sending me an offer and everything and I was like I know my work I know I'm higher than that you know so I send another kind of offer and for like two weeks anything back up about no job and everything so one day call my the blue was like hey we really need you not only I'm gonna change the offer I'm gonna give you more money and so the start of it is I start with a higher pay and then within 30 days they give me another higher and then what did another 30 days it gonna go higher and higher you know so I just continued thank God and can you know thank you guys for all your prayers and everything I know no when I man's meeting and I pray and everything just not trying to stay humble guy because that's who's doing it for me anything you know so I just continue to praise him and thank him for it you know so I'm excited so just continue keep that in prayer like I said I've been there for a week right now they they they really like me and everything like that but you know and on top of that like they already know I'm a Christian already you know I mean there's like so they usually get around and everybody and everything they're looking like oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry like you know I I heard it but I understand and you know they offered me to come out to them tonight and I was like no I can't go as a Christian I shouldn't be no bar anyway you know so um but it was like yeah I wish you woulda came but I'm like yeah you guys are no more obligations and everything like that they say next time they go out and go somewhere more wholesome it's really nice and them just actually see that you know God within me as well that's one of my biggest prayers no matter where I go that someone you know can see that I'm trying to do for God and everything like that okay thing to thank the church thank you guys [Applause] what uh that's a wonderful testimony and a man we were we were in prayer and I'm gonna have to cut the testimonies there because I brother brother Jerry is gonna speak for us tonight and I want him to have the opportunity just in time but I wanted to take time just to read the scripture really quick and out of first chronicles chapter 4 verse 9 and 10 we were in prayer and I just felt led to pray this over the brothers on last last week and to see God is doing exactly what we prayed I felt it would be beneficial for me to at least read this over to church a man tonight and now and maybe during our time of collecting the offering we will pray this over the church as well but first chronicles 4 verse 9 says and jay-bez was more honorable then his brother and his mother called his name jay-bez Sam because I bear him with sorrow and jay-bez call on the God of Israel saying oh that thou would with us bless me indeed and enlarge my coasts and that thine hand might be with me and that that would escape me from evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested now you know we talked about a large and coast everybody coast is different somebody coast might be a job so everybody coast might be a touch in their body a man somebody's coast might be restoration in their family a man but no matter what it is we've asked God to enlarge the coasts right and and we were just praying over that and and just to hear these testimonies God answers prayer in y'all it meant God answers prayer and we ought to get ready for you know what whatever coast we have in our life we all get ready to forgot to enlarge a man let's uh prepare to take tonight's tizen offering and then then we'll have brother Jared come out and share from his heart we meant to our hearts and a man we just look forward to what the Lord has in store for us let's just pray and as we're praying over tonight's often I want to pray over the church a man this this prayer father we come into your mind ik residence thank you for the precious testimonies that we have heard here tonight Lord how we have been strengthened by these these words that are spoken to us and God to just think Oh roughly a week ago we were praying over this scripture you just I felt LED at the end of prayer just to just call out each brothers name and even not only brothers that were there but the brothers that weren't there we began to call their names out and then God you had me just begin the coal a man that the church out that the sisters is well and God as we just call them out where we're praying that you would enlarge their coast and somebody this is their business and somebody this is their family and somebody this is a job the Lord somebody this is health their Coast represents so many different things but Lord you know what the people stand in need of and and we acts that you would meet them all at the point of need made you God do things that go beyond our expectations that here brother Devon's testimony that they not only gave him the money that he was offering they went above and God they even made promises that don't go further than that so this is the enlargement that we're talking about and if we're faithful to you if we're doing what you called us to do them God we know that you would do greater things you do the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask a thing so what we're not going to a man complaining about her problems we gotta start praising you for the promise that you have given to us knowing that every promise that you've made the journey Amanda not one promise that you're spoken can fail so thank you for meeting every knee thank you for going beyond our expectations and thank you all for doing Amanda things that we never imagined that you would do so father as we give tonight we give cheerfully and we're playing it to bless our giving tonight and father that you're just used for the continuance of your kingdom it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you praise the Lord see increase [Music] stressful wait [Music] me too the babies I see Greece me stretch play and grateful me too tonight I'll be search me Spencer that's that's an epic song to play at that time that's um that's mine that's mine let's put it that way I'll take it that way to me and claim in that way we might have just prepare our hearts to see Jerry tomayto see with fun let's just continue to sing this song and I just want you to don't let it just be words advantage song but let it be something that ministers to their heart the plan that got with a larger coasts whatever that coast is may God and large it starting tonight no limits no boundaries Oh this which way Hey or our territory No I see [Music] I know the devil don't like us tonight every one of you here is greatest enemy you guys are threatening [Music] [Applause] let us pray dear Heavenly Father Lord I'm so grateful for this atmosphere I thank you for meeting us here tonight my god you have great plans for us Lord all the testimonies Lord God Father we thank you for them all and we know they sure still working in our midst just the same as you were before and lodging our course Lord God that's our expectation for this season well we're asking for greater things Lord things that

drill in every heart and that you'll meet every need father help us look god help me to surrender myself to you Lord that you can speak that I take myself out the way well we are so grateful father may use any spirit against yours Lord and take every spirit under control by your Holy Spirit since Jesus Christ am that I pray amen [Applause] thank you yeah that uh that song was on time very on time so I'm gonna read a very family familiar scripture and just trust that God will administer it every heart turn me to John 3:16 say man if you're ready so he says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent His Son into the world to condemn them to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son I'd also like to read in 1 Corinthians 13 it reads though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and and though I have all faith so I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice it then not in not in iniquity but rejoiceth it in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall cease whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part you may be seated may the Lord add a blessing to his reading I'll just just going to continue reading verse 7 continues and says sorry verse 10 says but when we when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought it as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity I like to use as a title God kind of switched things up on me operating and God's love and I pay attention closely to verse 13 it says that we know in the midst of everything else there remaineth 3 and that's charity hope and faith we have these three that that we know that that endures but the greatest of them all is love is charity that's that's what's the greatest and I had to ask myself why is it that love is the greatest out of them all and I realized that that love is the foundation love is is what produces hope and faith you have to have love before you can have hope in something you have to have love before you can have faith in something and I realized that in John 3:16 it was the love of God that was expressed to humanity right we see that God how to plan a purposeful plan in the beginning where he he he needed to get into communion with his people and when we look at what he did in the arm well he said in John 3:16 well we see Christ being the very manifestation of God's love and says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so Christ is the gift of God and when we're operating God's love we have to be doing the same thing that Christ did it's not enough to say I believe God but but you have to say I love God and even then when you love God do you know what the love of God is because the love of God is what passes all understanding right it here it says uh it Ephesians 3:19 I won't be long Church it says it's an oval love of Christ which passeth all understanding that you might be filled with the fullness of God so what we're looking for is the fullness of God to be in full display in all areas of our lives right the love of God produces relationship when we really love that it's no longer a ritual but a relationship it's not a matter of coming to church every Sunday but it's coming with an expectation knowing that all that you are is because of God and and it will just go ahead the love of God produces obedience right when you really love God you understand through the midst of your obedience God cannot fell when you're obedient that's what overcomes your trials your problems right your trials are no longer facing your problems don't overshadow you and your situations won't define you when you're when you're there and the perfect love of God right you you you you know just what to expect and that affect you you look forward to your trials because you know that God or he's only trying you to prove you to show that something is in you that he wants to bring out that's why the Bible tells us in John and James 1 consider all joy when you can understand the love of God you're not you're not waiting for the Joe to come the joys already there and and and and we all have to be operating in the perfect love of God every act of obedience that that we commit is drawing us closer to our blessing God cannot bless you if you're not doing the right thing I cannot bless you if you're not obeying His commandments right how did God tell us that that we that we ought to love him he says if in John 14:15 if you love me you'll keep my Commandments right and I realize that and keeping those Commandments it is actually his Commandments are keeping you right because when you're in a trial and you keeping his Commandments it is for electing you it's overshadowing your problems it's allowing you to overcome every obstacle that you're going through right so so your obedience is what's going to connect you with your blessings and if you're not obedient is delaying the process right I love what the Prophet says and God projecting his word it gives us the he gives us the expectation he says when love is projected and it comes to the end of his strength Sovereign Grace will take up from there and project the object that love has asked for right so we know love itself has attributes that's grace that's God's mercy right that that's all that he's done for us when we look at other things it produces it shows us that when we're operating in the love of God right we won't even lay our life for our own brother right what will be dia to the very end well you're operating in God's love knocking can put his confidence in you and that's what's that's that's extremely important because there's a lot of man that God has put his confidence in and it wasn't because of of their faith it wasn't because of their gifts or any mighty things they've done but it's because of their total surrender to God and Joshua is one of those that that God put his confidence in let me just go to Joshua here Joshua will start at the third verse of the first chapter every place that the sole of your foot shall threat upon that God has have given out to you as I as I said unto Moses from the wilderness in the Lebanon even unto the great river the river your fates all the land of the Hittites and until the Great Sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your coast there shall be not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with you I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of the courage for unto this people shall be divided for an inheritance the land which I swear to their fathers to give them so we see that God has had confidence in in Joshua he set the expectation and he told him that he won't fail him no he forsake him and if we understand what the love of God is we know that the God's love is on feeling right God God's love is he's not jealous God's love does not is not arrogant right it's it's accepting all that he's done its patient it's kind and it's happy with the truth right and I take note of what the love of God does produce and and what it ought to do and if we understand that we ought to get keep God's commandments then we understand that what we have need of God can meet God can I can do those things for us and in John 3:22 I'm sorry first John 3:22 it it tells us what happens if we do keep God's commandments if we do if we are operating God's love and it says and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is the this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of the son of Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment so if we can be obedient until the very end we know that God will meet us at our very need and the His commandments are not Grievous they're not difficult right and they're not they're not difficult so we we have that joy right now we have that power that strength to endure overcome our trials even right now because we understand that the love of God does not that not perish but it prevails and not having the love of God actually puts you in position to deny truth because it's that is that spirit that's in you that that that's not that's a Best contrary to Christ because for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son God gave us Christ as a gift to to us his people because he knows we needed to be redeemed and knowing that we knowing that why we were yet sinners he loved us he knows that we needed to be reconciled to him we need to we need to be needed to have fellowship with him once again and and 2 Thessalonians verse 10 it tells us that with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish will they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they shall believe a lie so so when the love of God is not in you right it's hard for you to accept truth it's hard for you to accept the message that God is sitting to you because those that God used his God puts his confidence and just like you did with mote just like they're with Moses just like you did with Joshua and we're living in a time now where we're his people God needs to be reconciled with us how fellowship with us well who did God have confidence and even right now well we understand that in Malachi tells us before the great and dreadful day he's going to send us a prophet and the ministry of this prophet shall be like I'll tell Liza so we understand that brother Branham was that fulfillment and God put his confidence in brother Branham his ministry was vindicated and for this reason we can't be deceived because we have the love of God in us where we can accept truth not be deceived by a lie that's God's confidence not only for the brothers ministry but every one of us here even right now it goes on saying and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they shall be damned who believeth not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness see we understand that the love of God cannot dwell with the with with the unrighteousness of Satan it's it's two contrary places that cannot do all that in the same atmosphere another person that that walked with God that that had fellowship with God was Joel and we understand that Joel had many trials and for someone that is facing the trials of Joe it's really hard to see God in that situation you know even in my old situation as a very quick testimony this year has been very trying for me and I've lost a lot I don't have the car I used to have for those of you who don't know I don't have the job I used to have I was working at a bank and that was stripped away so I've lost a lot and in the midst of those trials it may be hard to see God but I'm grateful for God because I've learned that I've loved God even more than I did last year or before I had the job before out the car those materialistic things are not what defines my love for Christ it's what God has already done the gift of God is Christ Christ living on the inside is what brings the joy when you're to try it when you're being tried you consider it all joy and we understand wherever God is the devil is there - God brings the trials and the devil brings the temptation it's ok to be tried but you have to recognize when the temptation comes so you can flee from when you're being tempted it is something it's a matter of the devil presenting an evil spirit something evil to you something that takes you away from his word but when when God is tempting when God is trying you the Bible says that cannot be to do it evil but he tries you when that is trying you is to prove something that you already have right something that's already in you your blessings your increase your clothes you already have God is trying you to take you to that place that's God's confidence in you [Applause] you see we fellowship our Redemption brother Branham says now God had confidence and joy he had fellowship with him and he knew that Joel could trust him so he said alright saying you go on ahead he is at your hands but you don't take his life you can't you can do anything else to him so say I'm good at his office away he goes and he kills all of jobs children now I want you to notice a little something Joel kind of had a pre thought of that I believe did you notice when his children all of them got together one day they had a great big banquet in paragraph 182 that says that's the reason Christ become human that he might know the groans of sickness that he might know the heartaches and disappointments that he that he with us might have fellowship together for he has been partaking of life like we have of disappointments and heartaches and sickness for he bore our sickness in our troubles and his own body fellowship now Joe endured a lot of trials and Satan knew his limitation and upon every upon every temptation that Satan brought it wasn't it wasn't enough to shake job's love for God because the very fact that job loved God God knew that he could trust Joe and at every trial that we face God has to know that he can trust us before he gives us what he's preparing us for and and and I really like the testimony of Joe because his own wife came and told him that you know just forget about everything God has done just leave look at what you're going through it's not worth it but joe said you speaking like a foolish woman and Satan knowing that he can't shake Joe use his wife to tell it and and and that's where the line was wrong because job had to recognize that his trial was him proving that he was still looking for God that he no matter what was going to seek God's face and his wife was used as a temptation trying to get to a point here but praise the Lord so speaking on Joe it's very fascinating to know that he no matter what he was faced with did not see his trials but he saw God and we can understand that that's what the love of God can produce in our lives when we no longer look at what we're going through but the promises that God has already made unto us and and and that's exactly what Joe did so the love of God has to dwell and every believe is hard if it took the love of God to provide an everlasting life it's going to take a love the love of God to accept it and Mille of of God is the very thing that drove the heart of God to send Christ we understand that so for us we have to be continuously dwelling and the love of God no matter what the trials are no matter what the circumstances are and that the fellowship is where God is taken it's trying to bring us to a fellowship with God to redeem us to take us back to what so all that was lost because we understand that that before God and for God sin Christ Adam was in the garden and Adam inherit the very the beginning of what God intended and now through Christ is the fulfillment of God it was God's purpose of God's greatest plan of redemption and for us now even through this Ministry of believing of the message we understand that God is taking us to a place of perfection a place of glory so like I said this year has been very trying and I've learned to love God more so than I ever have and I've learned to hold on to all that God has done rather than see for other things to satisfy my thirst or my hunger because whatever God is the devil is there also and and my trials are only meant there to take me to a greater purpose and that's that's that's the cause of it I remember brother Jack once said all that you all that you go through the Christian that God can use the most Hebrews the most and God's gonna bruise you if you really want to be used in that way and I've staff tooken at the heart ever since knowing that while God he can bruise me it'll be all for his glory see God will allow the devil to tempt you but he also gives the devil a timetable he gives a devil boundaries an expiration date he puts the step part know that this is how far you can go but all that you're doing is actually taking my son my daughter even further and and and we know we know that can be our very expectations knowing that God is taking us to a higher place continuously operating in the love of God that's why it's important that we think God for you were the little things your prayer brother Quentin that that you they pray for so long but God was right there he knew that you had a hunger and thirst of desire for that to be answered and he answered it so so we have to be sensitive when God is speaking and when God is moving because because when he's speaking to you he will eventually speak through you through somebody else god bless you you know Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I'm thankful for your love Lord operating and your love is all that we need Lord father we know that there is faith and there's hope but without love it's nothing god I pray Lord that a heart father was blessed by your words I pray that it cannot it's not one it doesn't go from one year to the other but Lord that we can understand that our foundation of who we ought to be in you is by loving you first by seeking first your kingdom father I'm thankful for you Lord even for the trials Lord it's all joy in our hearts I pray God that you'll continue to give us the blessings - over the victory through the trials Lord letting us know who we are and who the devil is bless us O Lord God may you provide mercy and grace unto us through the weekend - Jesus Christ day that we pray amen [Music] [Applause] god bless you Church I really appreciate [Music] everything that God is doing and just just trusting that God will continue enlarge our coasts take us to a higher place and really prepare us prepare us for his coming because if we don't have love and not operating in his love then we don't have anything and I've heard and read this once that the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost is to have the love of God so the love of God is what we ought to be seeking for knowing that we have such a gift and that gift is Christ and because the gift is Christ we are a gift to the world because we're still here and we're all the light of the world [Applause] [Music] let's give the Lord a hand of praise for brother Gary that scripted any brought their out of sector that's lobbyist let's just read that second Thessalonians chapter 2 in the first 10 [Music] see here [Music] with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and then that perish because they receive the love of the truth that they might be saved so salvation actually came through the truth right you can't reject the truth and then actually think you're gonna be saved right so here it goes I'm sayin and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie because I want to say that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness I say lord have mercy and I think this is more relevant for our day [Music] Paul wrote these things and we're seeing the manifestation of that but you know we have to continue to operate in the love of God understanding that it is them and love is going to cause us to obey His commandments and life is obey it but love love to actually do what God you know called us to do I remember that the story of the lady she was married to her husband and he would leave little notes around the house and say do this do this do this do this all the time from her crazy she hated seeing them notes and that husband died and she got remarried to another husband she liked thank God and got to see the notes around here no more I mean this this guy loved me more than the other guy loved me and I ain't got good notes like they just drop they was driving me crazy one day she was up in the attic cleaning out and she saw the little notes around and she said yeah I thank God this thing is gone thank God I gotta worry about that no mo and come to find out that the reason that she have to worry about the notes is because what the first husband was leaving her to do had actually become part of her and she was already doing it right so the second husband didn't have to leave any notes and when it become part of it it showed that she loved doing what she was doing right and and and when we when we get there the love of God or the word of God really in our hearts it's not Grievous a man is not something that oh I wish I didn't have to do it okay you know there used to be a time where I didn't have a love of God in me and I hated coming to church but when I got the love of God in me I couldn't wait to get through the church doors all right hey man and I want nothing coming in the way I mean if we're not when I didn't have a love of God I struggled with football on Friday Night Football game on church but when I got the love of God I ain't thinking about the football game I was ready to go to church right it's something about when you get the love of God not because somebody making you do it but because you love him everything is based off of that love I tell you that that's just that's just wonderful I couldn't help but smile as I sitting there looking at brother Jerry my mind went all the way back to when he started coming to church I mean he was in high school I think when we first met for the Jerry he was in high school and came through the citizens and everything and and you know and I remember even as a young man in high school and he used to work so much and he really couldn't be in church you know he used to work often we see him pop in maybe four you know one week might not see him for a couple weeks then we see him pop in again and and to see what the Lord has brought brother Jer from my savings god is is it's a good call my lord that that brother give the devil a black man we just appreciate that tonight brother Jer God God richly God richly bless you when you keep God's commandments is actually the commandments [Music] whoa that's all right well that's all
