[3:46] [Music]
[3:50] see amen God bless you Saints it's good
[3:53] to be in the house of the Lord another
[3:55] day I know a lot of us are very very
[3:58] tired and uh the week's been long but
[4:00] it's always good to hear a word from the
[4:03] Lord and I find that um when I was a
[4:07] younger guy I used to complain about
[4:08] coming to church on Wednesdays and then
[4:11] as I began to grow in Christ I began to
[4:14] find out that God actually answers your
[4:18] questions on times you may not expect it
[4:21] so when you're missing church on
[4:22] Wednesday you might be missing your
[4:24] answer so I've learned to be thankful uh
[4:28] that I'm able who attend church on
[4:30] Wednesday and on any other day so so we
[4:33] are going to get straight into the
[4:34] message um uh if we stand up for the
[4:37] reading of the word uh everyone can turn
[4:40] to Genesis uh
[4:42] 126 and we're going to read verses 126
[4:45] through
[4:55] 127 all
[4:58] right
[5:01] and it reads and God said let us make
[5:03] man in our image after our likeness and
[5:06] let them have dominion over the fish and
[5:08] of the over the fish of the sea and over
[5:10] the fowl of the air and over the cattle
[5:13] and over all the Earth and over every
[5:14] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[5:16] Earth so God created man in his own
[5:19] image in the image of God created he him
[5:22] male and female created he them amen uh
[5:26] let us bow our heads in word of prayer
[5:28] Lord Jesus Christ we come before for you
[5:29] Lord God we thank you oh lord for
[5:31] another another opportunity oh Lord to
[5:34] come before your throne oh Lord God to
[5:36] receive from you oh Lord Jesus Christ
[5:38] Lord we know Lord God that our
[5:41] sacrifices are not in vain oh Lord Jesus
[5:43] Christ Lord the Angels there are angels
[5:45] right there before your throne oh Lord
[5:47] God crying holy holy holy holy oh Lord
[5:50] God every second every minute every hour
[5:52] oh Lord God without fail oh Lord Jesus
[5:54] Christ so we know for a fact oh Lord God
[5:57] how much more is our sacrifice oh Lord
[5:59] God for you didn't create us to be
[6:01] Angels oh Lord God to worship to worship
[6:03] you like that but you created us to be
[6:05] Sons and Daughters to have a
[6:07] relationship with you oh Lord God
[6:09] meaning that Lord Jesus Christ oh God
[6:11] when we call upon your name oh Lord God
[6:14] there's an action that follows oh Lord
[6:16] Jesus Christ oh Lord in the beginning oh
[6:18] Lord God the relationship that you had
[6:20] with Adam oh Lord God he would speak the
[6:22] word oh Lord God and you would agree
[6:25] with it oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord
[6:27] you're trying to restore us oh Lord back
[6:30] to that position oh Lord God through the
[6:32] end time messenger that you brought to
[6:34] us oh Lord God so Lord we ask you oh
[6:36] Lord in our sacrifice oh Lord God answer
[6:39] our prayers oh Lord God answer our
[6:41] please oh Lord God there are so many
[6:43] needs that we have oh Lord Jesus Christ
[6:46] but Lord you prophesied that the needs
[6:48] would be there oh Lord God so you could
[6:51] answer them and fulfill them oh Lord God
[6:52] so he we are Lord Jesus Christ vessels
[6:55] yielded to you oh Lord God be with us oh
[6:58] Lord God bless us and help help us get
[6:59] ourselves out the way in the precious
[7:01] name of Jesus Christ
[7:03] amen amen all right you may be
[7:07] seated I know I let y'all stand for a
[7:09] long time but I got in my mind now so
[7:13] the title of the message uh that God
[7:15] gave me was um knowledge in The Godly
[7:19] pronouns all right so what's important
[7:22] in this day and age because it's it's
[7:24] during a time where the where the the
[7:26] prophet didn't have to worry about that
[7:28] Spirit of gender identity and stuff it
[7:31] wasn't as heavy as it is today with a
[7:33] lot of kids in school having to deal
[7:36] with these uh uh different identities
[7:38] and labels that people are trying to put
[7:40] on them and I have to confess that when
[7:42] I first heard about all of these
[7:44] identities and stuff I was against all
[7:46] of them I was just I just didn't believe
[7:48] any that I thought it was all of Satan
[7:50] until God kind of had to you know slow
[7:53] me down and say well hold on a second
[7:55] Satan doesn't create anything it's only
[7:57] a perversion of stuff right so that
[7:59] means if there are pronouns out there
[8:01] that are being perverted there are
[8:03] pronouns out there personal pronouns out
[8:05] there that have a Godly purpose behind
[8:07] it and so today what we want to do is go
[8:10] through and see what those are so that
[8:12] we can know where God has placed us
[8:14] because you're not you're not a he a she
[8:17] because you choose to be but it's
[8:19] because of what God made you and that
[8:21] was before the foundation of the world
[8:23] right so the uh the uh the original P
[8:27] purpose of pronouns and it's
[8:29] specifically personal pronouns was to
[8:31] show your position in a relationship or
[8:35] and how you're supposed to operate in
[8:37] that relationship right and so as and
[8:39] we'll go through the Bible to see these
[8:41] things to make sure it's scriptural
[8:42] because they've come up with different
[8:43] kind of pronouns like Z and z and Zim
[8:46] and all that stuff that has no
[8:48] scriptural backing right but there are
[8:50] three personal pronouns that we see in
[8:51] the Bible uh and those are he him she
[8:55] her they and them right and as we go
[8:58] through and uh and we're going to uh
[9:00] turn uh you can pull up verse uh uh
[9:02] Genesis uh 27 and we're going to take a
[9:04] little journey through this verse
[9:06] because it has a lot of information in
[9:08] that we want to
[9:09] unpack all right so
[9:11] um I just keep keep reading all right so
[9:14] it says here so God created man in his
[9:17] own image so this is the first place we
[9:21] see a personal pronoun which is his and
[9:24] it's God referring to himself so God
[9:26] refers to himself as a he a his
[9:29] right the masculine part that's what God
[9:32] refers to himself so that's why we when
[9:34] we call on him when we call on him we
[9:35] call on him we say him Marvin sap has a
[9:38] song that says Praise Him in Advance you
[9:41] know there's a song out there that I
[9:43] never listened to but I but I saw the
[9:44] title of it by one of the popular uh
[9:47] secular artists out there that said God
[9:49] is a woman and it's it's it's it's
[9:52] partly true and partly false and the
[9:54] prophet used to preach he would he could
[9:56] he would say that you can be you can
[9:58] have some truth right but it depends on
[10:00] where you fall on whether it's Truth Or
[10:02] Not truth right so it's partly true
[10:05] because as we read further on it says in
[10:07] the image of God in the image of God
[10:09] created he him so now we have a man
[10:12] which is an image and he's also
[10:14] referring to that man as a himm as well
[10:17] right masculine right it's a masculine
[10:20] side and then there's a semicolon and we
[10:22] take a pause then it says male and
[10:24] female created he them right so now we
[10:27] have a he and now we have of them but
[10:30] there's no she or her yet right and this
[10:33] creature is completely finished right
[10:36] God has completely finish this creature
[10:37] it's perfect we if you read further on
[10:41] uh it says that God said it was good
[10:43] after the seventh day after they created
[10:44] everything everything was perfect right
[10:46] so we see our second pronoun here which
[10:49] is them right which referred to these
[10:52] two components inside of a man which was
[10:55] a male and a female and we we love that
[10:59] uh and I'll get to it further
[11:01] because it's the reason why we have the
[11:04] victory because we're hidden behind the
[11:06] blood we're hidden behind the blood of
[11:08] Jesus Christ and we never come in our
[11:11] own name right there were some people in
[11:13] the Bible that saw Paul casting out
[11:15] devils and demons and they were doing it
[11:17] in the name of Jesus Christ and they saw
[11:19] him and they tried to imitate and the
[11:22] demons looked at them and said Paul I
[11:24] know Jesus I know Paul I know but who
[11:27] are you you see they weren't hidden
[11:29] behind the blood right in order to be
[11:31] hidden behind the blood you have to have
[11:32] your will completely surrendered to God
[11:35] so these gentlemen were living a life
[11:37] that was not completely surrendered to
[11:39] God they weren't behind the blood which
[11:41] is why when they used the name it had no
[11:44] power but this female right here which
[11:47] we know her name is Eve later on but God
[11:51] didn't give her a name because her name
[11:53] was already in this creation which was
[11:55] him Adam right and we have a name when
[11:59] we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:01] and we accept Christ in our lives we
[12:03] receive a new name as Mrs Jesus Christ
[12:06] so we no longer come in our own name we
[12:08] come in God's name and with that comes
[12:11] power
[12:12] right and so we want to we want to also
[12:15] not only just find these pronouns in the
[12:18] Bible right we also want to see the
[12:21] purpose behind them so why did God call
[12:23] himself a he and why did God call this
[12:26] creation that he created Adam a him and
[12:29] not refer to any her or she parts that
[12:32] will take us to uh 2 Genesis uh chapter
[12:39] 19 and I'll just read
[12:43] that so 2 Genesis chapter 19 yep oh yeah
[12:48] 2119 yeah 219 yep and it says and out of
[12:52] the ground the Lord God formed every
[12:54] beast of the field and every foul of the
[12:56] air and brought them unto Adam to see
[12:59] what he would call them now that's very
[13:02] very powerful and that's and that's when
[13:05] you read the scriptures you really got
[13:06] to read with a revelation because here
[13:09] is God saying he created all of these
[13:12] beasts and he's bringing them to Adam to
[13:14] see what Adam's decision on what the
[13:16] name is going to be he's not telling
[13:18] Adam what to name them he wants to see
[13:21] Adam what is your thought on this God
[13:23] had so much confidence in this creature
[13:26] that he would that he knew he would
[13:28] speak the very word that God was already
[13:30] thinking about the animals right and
[13:33] that one creature what he called him so
[13:35] it was God him God talking to another
[13:37] hymn right so what we see in this hymn
[13:40] pronoun is that there's a Dominion
[13:43] there's a a um a dominating uh not a
[13:47] dominating Spirit but a spirit that is
[13:49] in control of creation right so when
[13:51] godam when God brought Adam a creature
[13:54] he said that's a lion and God actually
[13:56] said amen right normally we say Amen to
[14:00] God but this this creature that God had
[14:02] created in his own image he had so much
[14:04] confidence inside of him he brought him
[14:06] another creature and Adam said that's a
[14:08] bear and God said you're right amen God
[14:10] brought another creature out there he
[14:12] saw the bird flying he said Adam said
[14:14] that's an eagle God said amen Adam said
[14:16] you know what I want to I want that
[14:18] mountain to move to the left God said
[14:20] amen it's done God and Adam also said I
[14:22] want this uh River to move through the
[14:24] jungle empy out into the ocean God said
[14:26] amen it is finished God has so much
[14:29] confidence in this creature which was
[14:31] identified as a he that the authority
[14:34] had on he knew for a fact that he would
[14:36] speak the word without compromising
[14:39] right so before and and I like this
[14:42] because it's a beautiful type because
[14:44] before Eve came on the scene Adam had
[14:47] everything in
[14:49] control Adam had the whole garden under
[14:51] subjection there was still a serpent in
[14:54] the garden but he wasn't causing any
[14:56] problems because go because Adam God had
[14:58] full confidence in Adam that he knew how
[15:00] to handle every situation right before
[15:02] Eve came on the scene and I love this
[15:04] because it's a beautiful type of job
[15:07] right when job was going through his
[15:09] trials God had called him the most
[15:12] righteous person in the land right
[15:14] that's what God Said from he Heaven he
[15:15] was confessing that to Satan right and
[15:18] and he allowed Satan to go and tempt job
[15:22] and so Satan went of course we know the
[15:24] story he took everything from job took
[15:26] his family took his riches and
[15:27] everything and and the thing that he
[15:29] feared most he put on which was a cancer
[15:31] I believe it was sores and cancer God
[15:33] allowed all that to happen and the Bible
[15:35] says job never never sinned against God
[15:38] never did he charge him but the prophet
[15:40] said he still needed some purging
[15:42] because job said he wish he would have
[15:44] never been born he never complained to
[15:46] God but he said he wished he would he
[15:47] would have never been been born and God
[15:50] had to come down and had to check the
[15:52] attitude of job by saying where were you
[15:55] when I formed the uhuh when I laid the
[15:57] foundations of the world you see job and
[16:00] uh and just to kind of take a break in
[16:02] this a lot of times when we say he and
[16:04] she and we and we uh we try to say male
[16:07] and female we tend to talk about
[16:09] husbands and wives but when you say you
[16:11] are a Christian when you say you are the
[16:13] bride of Christ you are taking on the
[16:15] female you're taking on the her
[16:17] representation which means you don't
[16:19] have a will which means we're all under
[16:21] subjection to God a lot of times people
[16:24] say oh yeah the husband's in charge no
[16:25] the husband is not in charge the husband
[16:28] has to be Le of God because the Bible
[16:30] says that when Adam was in the garden
[16:32] there were two trees and God said
[16:34] there's there there are two trees in
[16:36] here the tree of life and the tree of
[16:37] knowledge you can eat from one of them
[16:40] the other one you can't you can't have
[16:41] nothing to do with it and that tree of
[16:43] life represented Christ so even Adam had
[16:46] a head in the garden that he had that he
[16:48] could only communicate with to and
[16:50] that's the same way a husband is so a
[16:52] husband's not just in charge just
[16:53] because he's in charge he's being led of
[16:56] God to be in charge amen amen man all
[16:59] right and so and and so in this
[17:02] situation with God and J J began to get
[17:05] a little bit out of his personal pronoun
[17:08] by saying he wish he would have never
[17:10] been born because God was the one that
[17:12] created him God was the one that brought
[17:14] him to be right God was the one that
[17:16] brought him into that situation he had
[17:18] to come and tell job hold on a second
[17:20] now where were you when I laid the
[17:21] foundations of the world when I created
[17:24] the galaxies when he spoke the word for
[17:26] a star and it didn't appear for
[17:28] trillions of years and job's um
[17:31] circumstance lasted maybe 3 5 years God
[17:34] had to wait trillions of years in order
[17:36] for one light to come when he spoke his
[17:38] word right so he had confidence in it
[17:40] and not only that even before all of
[17:42] that God had already had a fight with
[17:45] Satan in the rebellion in heaven and had
[17:47] cast casted him down to Hell so God
[17:50] already had confidence God had already
[17:52] had everything in order before job went
[17:54] through his trial right when God gives
[17:58] you a fight God's already handled the
[18:00] hard part yes sir right God has already
[18:02] handled the hard part which is why and a
[18:04] lot of times we like to blame the
[18:06] children of Israel in the story of David
[18:08] for fearing but they knew their place
[18:11] they knew they couldn't go up against
[18:12] Goliath because it wasn't they weren't
[18:14] called to do it right they were not
[18:16] called to do it they weren't the king
[18:18] and God God had already anointed a king
[18:20] during that day and that was David and
[18:23] when David went out to face Goliath
[18:24] knowing that he was the head of Israel
[18:27] right was able to slay the Giant and
[18:30] after that a lot people may not read the
[18:32] Bible verses but that gave courage to
[18:35] the rest of the children of Israel to
[18:36] chase the Army off am right after
[18:40] following their head right making sure
[18:42] that they were following the head right
[18:44] so and that's what and that's what uh um
[18:46] job was trying and that's what God was
[18:47] trying to let job know he wasn't picking
[18:50] he wasn't picking on him by saying you
[18:51] know who were were you when I laid the
[18:53] foundation of the world he was trying to
[18:54] let job know that job I've had
[18:57] everything under control control before
[18:58] you went through anything before any
[19:00] sickness touch your body before your UH
[19:03] your wife turned against you before your
[19:04] friends turned against you before your
[19:06] kids die I had everything under control
[19:09] am everything under control right and so
[19:12] Adam in a similar situation before Eve
[19:15] came onto the field uh uh Eve came on to
[19:17] the garden and stuff Adam had everything
[19:20] under control Adam had the garden
[19:22] running smoothly the serpent would come
[19:24] to him he' tell the serpent move and
[19:26] that serpent left right
[19:28] but the problem came is when um Adam uh
[19:33] uh uh begun to uh uh Adam well God made
[19:36] the woman from Adam and we're going to
[19:38] actually pull up another verse um we're
[19:41] actually going to pull up another verse
[19:43] to uh because we're getting to our final
[19:44] pronoun which is she and her right she
[19:47] and her we're going to see how that came
[19:49] came about to be we're going to put
[19:51] we're going to uh turn to Genesis uh
[19:56] 2:21 all right and the Lord God caused a
[19:59] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[20:02] slept and took one of his ribs and
[20:05] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[20:08] the next verse and the rib which God had
[20:12] so now back in this verse just kind of
[20:14] back up now God this this this creature
[20:18] that he that God had created which was
[20:20] Adam which was a perfect creature God is
[20:24] now performing an operation on him that
[20:26] was not in the original plan all right
[20:29] so God had to close up the flesh that he
[20:32] had already C God had to open up a flesh
[20:34] and close it up on flesh that he had
[20:36] already called perfect so now God then
[20:39] he takes out a rib of a perfected
[20:41] creature right and then and in verse 22
[20:45] he says and the rib which the Lord God
[20:47] hath taken from man made he a woman and
[20:50] brought her unto the man so now we see
[20:52] the pronoun her reference referencing uh
[20:56] uh his wife Eve his wife right uh Adam's
[20:59] wife uh which is our reference of the
[21:00] bride and it kind of It kind of It kind
[21:02] of It kind of struck me when the prophet
[21:04] said that God doesn't need us and when I
[21:07] see this Bible verse I can agree with
[21:09] that right even though we are the even
[21:11] though we are the bride of Christ when
[21:13] Eve sinned right God Adam had a choice
[21:17] Adam was perfect and but Adam knew that
[21:20] if he would have not sinned with Eve
[21:22] that God would have took Eve's life so
[21:25] because of that he uh sinned with as
[21:28] well in order for uh for them both to be
[21:30] safe but we don't but God doesn't need
[21:34] us we need him we need to depend on him
[21:37] right and a lot of times it's knowledge
[21:40] which is the second part of what we're
[21:41] going to talk about that gets in the way
[21:43] of us uh um uh being uh doing what God
[21:47] needs us to do so going back up to verse
[21:50] 218 uh Genesis 2:18 now we have defined
[21:54] we've seen where all these pronouns have
[21:56] come from the Bible so we know they're
[21:58] scripture we know the definition of a he
[22:00] and a him is to be in charge is to be in
[22:03] command is to make decisions right God
[22:05] is confident when he when he places uh
[22:09] his word in a man because he knows it's
[22:11] going to speak exactly what he wants it
[22:13] to say right so now we see here in verse
[22:16] 18 it says and the Lord God said it is
[22:18] not good that a man should be alone I
[22:20] will make him a help meat right so now
[22:22] we know the definition of a she is a
[22:25] help meat for him and we can kind of see
[22:28] that in the in in the next verse When
[22:31] God had created all the Beast he created
[22:34] all the fowls and he brought them to
[22:36] Adam to see what he was going to call
[22:37] him Adam ain't try to change the animals
[22:40] they was already created Adam didn't try
[22:43] to change nothing right Adam just gave
[22:45] them a name that God already knew he was
[22:48] going to name them and that's because he
[22:50] came from him right and that's how we
[22:54] know we're Christians is because we
[22:56] speak the word that's how we know we're
[22:57] Sons and Daughters of God because we
[22:59] speak the word right so this pronoun she
[23:03] the definition of it was to be a help
[23:06] meat for him and that's our job with God
[23:09] that's all God wants us to do is help
[23:11] him not by trying to do anything because
[23:14] a lot of times God just needs us to
[23:16] believe and in that situation with job
[23:19] he didn't need job to try to go find the
[23:20] cure for cancer he didn't need job to
[23:22] try to go find a new job he didn't need
[23:24] job to go uh try to do counseling with
[23:26] his wife he didn't need job to do any of
[23:28] those things but just to believe that he
[23:31] was a redeemer and he would come and
[23:32] help him on the situation I can imagine
[23:35] when Eve came into the field uh and Adam
[23:38] had seen his helpmate and I and I bet
[23:40] you it just brought joy to his soul
[23:42] because he was lonely right he was
[23:44] lonely and so he I know maybe he brought
[23:46] some flower seeds and started to flower
[23:48] them and then he told Eve Eve go and
[23:51] water those flowers right then he got
[23:53] some apple seeds and planted some apples
[23:55] and told Eve go and uh go and water the
[23:58] uh uh the seeds are there he got some
[23:59] orange seeds and planted those and said
[24:01] e uh Eve go water those seeds right and
[24:04] then when as she watered them following
[24:06] the command of Adam right uh uh those
[24:09] seeds grew and she saw the flower and
[24:11] she loved it right she loved the flower
[24:14] so in all that toiling that Adam did it
[24:17] was for her and then he took her to the
[24:19] apple tree and she took a bite of the
[24:21] Apple she never tasted nothing like it
[24:23] right all that toiling was for her so
[24:25] all she had to do was just water the
[24:28] seed that Adam had already put she
[24:30] didn't need to change it she didn't need
[24:32] to say oh well why don't you put it over
[24:34] there why don't you put over here all
[24:35] she had to do was listen and water what
[24:38] Adam had planted and that's exactly what
[24:40] God was trying to get job to know
[24:42] because God saw a double blessing in job
[24:45] God saw a restoration of his family God
[24:48] saw a double portion of his kids God saw
[24:50] a double portion of his health right and
[24:53] all he needed job to do was water it
[24:55] with praise no matter what he was going
[24:57] through
[24:58] and it brought about a blessing for job
[25:00] God had already saw it whenever you're
[25:02] going through you might be sick right
[25:05] you might have Financial issues you
[25:06] might look at your bank account and zero
[25:09] dollars but even through that praise God
[25:11] for it right God's Got a Blessing coming
[25:14] for you if you're sick you know if
[25:16] you're sick I don't care what the
[25:17] sickness is and how sick you are praise
[25:20] God through it God's one one of the
[25:22] things is God God needs your help God
[25:25] needs your help to show he's a Healer
[25:28] and that's why we're a helpmate it's not
[25:30] our job to try to figure it out
[25:32] ourselves it's not our job to try to
[25:34] heal ourselves it's not our job to to
[25:36] deliver ourselves out the situation no
[25:38] God needs help to bring about who he is
[25:41] and he's a savior he's a Healer he's a
[25:44] provider and he needs our help to show
[25:46] that he is that that's why the king and
[25:49] Esther the uh he wanted to show the
[25:51] Queen off to show that hey this is my
[25:54] wife and when she rejected him he had to
[25:56] kick her out right because she wouldn't
[25:58] bring up bring his word to pass and God
[26:01] is looking for a wife like Esther that
[26:03] will come humbly Before the Throne and
[26:05] when the King asks of something you come
[26:07] through it without complaining like the
[26:09] children of Israel and that's why and I
[26:12] always every time I I read about the
[26:13] children of Israel I don't ever want to
[26:15] be in that mindset and it's hard to be
[26:17] in that mindset when you're going
[26:18] through something and you don't want to
[26:20] complain because if the children of
[26:22] Israel would have seen that God was the
[26:25] one that hardened the heart of pharaoh
[26:27] to come after them it wasn't him wanting
[26:29] to come out of his own will but God
[26:31] wanted to show them that he was a
[26:33] deliverer God wanted to prove to them
[26:36] that out of the in uh out of the
[26:37] impossible he could make something
[26:39] possible right God wanted all God wanted
[26:42] them to do in that situation was to
[26:43] water the word to say God you're able
[26:47] I've never come against this thing
[26:48] before but God you're able God you're
[26:51] able to bring nothing out of something
[26:53] oh Lord God Amen God wanted to show them
[26:55] and so God's looking for a help me not
[26:58] to try to figure things out or complain
[27:00] to the person but trust that God Will
[27:03] Make A Way Through the situation amen
[27:05] amen amen and that's why we're
[27:08] identified as a she that's why even uh
[27:11] uh uh even as a minister I'm not I'm not
[27:13] up here saying whatever I want to say
[27:16] I'm not as a as a uh as a brother in
[27:19] Christ I'm not just living any old kind
[27:21] of life that I want to live right we
[27:23] have to be submitting to Christ and
[27:25] whatever his idea is we say amen because
[27:28] he needs our help he needs a vessel
[27:31] that's surrendered in order to show that
[27:33] his word is true yes sir amen amen right
[27:37] so that's what the uh the definition for
[27:40] her a pronoun was it was to it was to
[27:42] reference uh um her as a help me to know
[27:46] that we're here not just doing we're not
[27:48] we're not we're here not just trying to
[27:49] do whatever we want to do but we're here
[27:51] to help the Lord bring his word to pass
[27:54] and he already has confidence in us
[27:56] because he placed the word there that's
[27:58] why God had confidence in job that's why
[28:01] God got upset with Moses when Moses
[28:04] cried to him cuz God had already placed
[28:06] the Word of Deliverance inside of him
[28:08] and he said what are you talking about I
[28:10] already seen you as a deliverer amen so
[28:14] um but now we have people in the world
[28:17] today that are trying to twist up all
[28:19] the words they're trying to twist up all
[28:20] the pronouns you got you got guys
[28:23] wanting to be girls wanting to be her
[28:25] you got girls wanting to be he and stuff
[28:27] like that but they don't understand what
[28:29] comes with that right they don't
[28:31] understand what comes with that
[28:33] placement of a pronoun amen they don't
[28:35] understand so and that's why I I would
[28:37] never call a woman a he I can't do it I
[28:41] would never call a man a she right right
[28:43] that man was made in the image of God
[28:47] Amen I it doesn't matter what the
[28:50] government says and that's why and and
[28:53] this message came out of a topic that we
[28:56] had at when are you for treat
[28:58] where brother I think it was brother
[28:59] Barry coffee was telling us like how
[29:02] will we help somebody that's struggling
[29:03] with identity issues because the thing
[29:06] about it is it's a huge problem today in
[29:09] brother brandom's time he didn't really
[29:11] worry about these things right cuz they
[29:13] were hidden but in our day we need a
[29:16] message and a word to help people that
[29:18] are struggling with their identity and
[29:20] so brother Barry had brought this
[29:22] brought this question and he said how
[29:24] would you help someone know their
[29:26] identity and a lot of people brought a
[29:29] lot of physical stuff and in my mind I'm
[29:31] thinking if people are already
[29:33] struggling with the physical identity
[29:36] you can't use anything physical to help
[29:38] them right right you can't use anything
[29:40] physical to help them because what the
[29:42] Bible says is that when God made man uh
[29:45] made a male and a female there was no
[29:48] body created it was already done in the
[29:50] spiritual World which means that the
[29:52] position and the identity and the
[29:54] pronouns were already established before
[29:57] there was a body created trth if you can
[30:00] get someone to understand that
[30:02] everything else will take place every
[30:04] other change would take place right and
[30:07] the reason why woman's wanting to be a
[30:09] man there's some pride there going on
[30:12] and that's why I won't call a woman a he
[30:14] I can't call it because then she's going
[30:16] to come at me like a he right she going
[30:18] to come at me like a he you call a you
[30:21] call a man a she he's going to come at
[30:23] you like a she I don't want none of the
[30:26] nonsense amen
[30:28] all right so we got to stick to the
[30:31] pronouns that God has given us because
[30:34] it's not just a physical thing it's
[30:36] something in our spirit and that's why
[30:39] when God placed Adam's spirit inside of
[30:41] his physical body and God asked him to
[30:44] name the animals and Adam knowing that
[30:47] he was a him and he was a he and the
[30:49] authority that he had by the word he
[30:51] could say that's a lion and God could
[30:52] say Amen right because Adam already knew
[30:56] who he was right with the Dominion that
[30:59] God had given him and I'm telling you
[31:00] right now you have to have identity when
[31:03] you're going through a trial you have to
[31:05] have identity when you're going through
[31:06] a sickness you have to have identity
[31:08] when you're going through a problem
[31:10] right because you can't come to Satan
[31:12] with a identity that's not your own and
[31:14] a lot of times we like to speak about
[31:17] the physical people and transgenders and
[31:19] stuff like that but there are some
[31:20] people in the spirit come on that's
[31:22] supposed to be a she and it's a he and
[31:25] there there people in the spirit that's
[31:26] supposed that's a she supposed to be uh
[31:28] that's he trying to be a she right at a
[31:31] spiritual standpoint that's why a lot of
[31:33] times you see women trying to get behind
[31:35] the pulpit God never ordained it God
[31:38] never created a woman to come behind a
[31:40] bullpit and preach right God created a
[31:42] woman to to help her husband which is
[31:45] it's it's it's not a lesser position or
[31:48] nothing like that it's still a part of
[31:50] God and that's why when Adam when Eve
[31:52] sinned Adam Adam said you know what I
[31:55] have to make a way for her her because
[31:58] she's a part of me because if God would
[32:00] have wiped her off the off the scene of
[32:01] the earth that was God and God can't
[32:04] wipe himself right she already had
[32:06] eternal life right so that's why we want
[32:09] to make sure uh that we know what our
[32:12] personal pronouns are and and also
[32:14] there's also the personal pronoun a lot
[32:16] of people talk about the gender fluid
[32:18] and the being agender and all that kind
[32:21] of stuff and they want to call
[32:22] themselves them and they and I didn't
[32:25] understand that one until I read the
[32:27] Bible and and in the Bible it said there
[32:29] was a semicolon there a pause it says
[32:31] male and female he created them right so
[32:34] there is a them pronoun and if anybody
[32:37] wants me to call them them I need to see
[32:40] your husband if you're a female and if
[32:42] you want me to call you they and you're
[32:44] a man I need to see your wife that's
[32:47] right praise God that's right I need to
[32:49] see those things before I give you that
[32:52] identity all right based off of the word
[32:54] I'll call you them and they all day as
[32:57] as long as I see the Fulfillment of the
[32:59] scripture praise God all right so now we
[33:03] want to dive into the topic now that
[33:05] we've kind of got a foundation and I'll
[33:07] be closing in a little bit but we'll try
[33:09] we'll get a little bit on this topic of
[33:10] knowledge because this is where the
[33:13] problem of confusion comes when
[33:15] someone's trying to be another identity
[33:17] than what they are another personal
[33:19] pronoun is what than what they are is by
[33:21] knowledge right it's always by knowledge
[33:24] so if we turn to Genesis
[33:25] 2:9
[33:30] we're going to start getting to this
[33:33] this realm of knowledge and how we have
[33:35] to be very very careful with this that
[33:37] it doesn't give us the wrong identity
[33:39] right and it says here and out of the
[33:41] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[33:44] tree that is Pleasant to the sight and
[33:46] good for food the tree of life also in
[33:49] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[33:51] knowledge of Good and Evil now I want
[33:53] you to notice something right because
[33:55] this tree of knowledge it's only
[33:58] identity is represented by knowledge but
[34:00] when you see the tree of life it's
[34:02] called the tree of life and if you would
[34:04] you know if you would turn to the um the
[34:07] pyramid that I uh that I put up
[34:10] there cuz we want to pull up the statue
[34:12] of a perfect man right we know by
[34:15] Revelation from the prophet that the
[34:18] statue of a perfect man was Jesus Christ
[34:21] and we also know by Revelation from the
[34:23] prophet that the the who the tree of
[34:25] life was in the Garden of Eden was Jesus
[34:28] Christ right so if you would look at the
[34:31] attributes of this tree of life in the
[34:33] Tree of Life knowledge already
[34:36] existed right you already have knowledge
[34:39] but you also have Temperance patience
[34:42] godliness brotherly kindness love Faith
[34:46] right that tree of good the tree of
[34:48] knowledge of Good and Evil didn't have
[34:49] any of these other attributes which is
[34:51] why God didn't want them to partake upon
[34:53] it because if they partook upon that
[34:55] tree yes they would receive knowledge
[34:58] but they wouldn't get love they wouldn't
[35:00] get patience they wouldn't get godliness
[35:02] I mean we live in a world today where
[35:04] people are I mean it's it's information
[35:06] overload right people are so focused on
[35:10] uh uh statistics and uh uh stats and
[35:13] everything no patience right getting to
[35:16] work honking their horn just ready to
[35:17] run people over all the knowledge in the
[35:20] world and no patience and that's why God
[35:22] didn't want his children partaken upon
[35:24] that tree because he saw that they
[35:27] wouldn't have faith they'd lose faith
[35:29] and that's why you have humans today
[35:31] right and it's it's sad to see it
[35:33] worried about sickness right all they're
[35:36] only focused on coid numbers kill 2,000
[35:39] kill killed 3,000 that's all they're
[35:41] looking at is the knowledge and the know
[35:43] and they have no faith to know that
[35:45] God's already overcome it all amen amen
[35:49] right so we live in this world today
[35:52] where it's all it's just a state of
[35:53] knowledge knowledge extraction and they
[35:56] say personal information and stuff is
[35:58] the new Gold Rush of the day right
[36:00] because people want to know who you are
[36:02] they want to know your habits they want
[36:04] to know your perks your your your your
[36:05] your characteristics the things that you
[36:07] like and the reason why it's called the
[36:09] tree of Good and Evil is because some
[36:11] people want to use that knowledge for
[36:13] good and some people want to use it for
[36:15] evil and you got to be careful to
[36:17] discern why uh someone is trying to get
[36:20] information from you right but I'm not
[36:23] preaching against knowledge because we
[36:24] know that it's good and I'm going to go
[36:25] through some Bible verses
[36:27] here to show that knowledge is good
[36:29] depending on where it originates from
[36:31] and I'll read through these pretty fast
[36:33] because they're pretty short so we have
[36:34] Proverbs 15:14 that says the heart of
[36:37] the man that have understanding seeketh
[36:39] knowledge but the the mouth of fools
[36:42] Feth on
[36:43] foolishness right we have Proverbs 2:6
[36:46] that says for the lord giveth wisdom out
[36:48] of the out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[36:49] and understanding we have Proverbs 1:7
[36:53] that says the fear of the Lord is the
[36:55] beginning of knowledge but for fools
[36:56] despise wisdom and instruction then we
[36:59] have over here first uh um oh Proverbs
[37:02] hold
[37:02] on let me pull it
[37:06] up then we have over here 1 Corinthians
[37:08] 12 8-10 it says for about for to one is
[37:12] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[37:14] to another the word of knowledge by The
[37:17] Same Spirit so that shows that some
[37:19] people God has given the gift of
[37:22] knowledge too so there's nothing wrong
[37:24] with knowledge the problem comes when
[37:27] one The Vessel that's using the
[37:29] knowledge and how that knowledge is is
[37:31] used it can be used to bless and it can
[37:34] used to curse it's like a double-edged
[37:35] sword you can use the sword to attack
[37:37] but if you're not careful and you pull
[37:38] back you can hurt yourself
[37:42] right and in closing we kind of want to
[37:44] look just a little bit on this knowledge
[37:46] piece uh but in the beginning when we
[37:48] look at the fall with Eve uh which is
[37:51] Genesis 3 and I just kind of read
[37:52] through it read through there and kind
[37:53] of paraphrase some things it says now
[37:55] the serpent was subtle than any beast in
[37:57] the field which means he had a lot of
[37:58] knowledge he had a lot of information
[38:01] but he didn't have any love he didn't
[38:02] have any faith he didn't have any good
[38:04] intentions right which the Lord God had
[38:07] made and he said unto the woman ye have
[38:09] God said ye shall not eat of every tree
[38:11] in the garden and the woman said unto
[38:13] the serpent this was her first mistake
[38:16] cuz when you have a head when someone's
[38:18] asking you a question go get your
[38:21] husband right when you got a question in
[38:23] your head go talk to your husband and
[38:25] that is that's a spiritual indication
[38:27] for us that whenever we Face something
[38:30] we should go and talk to Jesus we don't
[38:31] just take every job offer someone wants
[38:33] to give us like hold on a second let me
[38:35] talk to Christ about this one right oh
[38:37] you may have gotten a good job a a good
[38:40] job offer in Miami right not knowing
[38:42] that there's a lot of sin that'll pull
[38:44] you from church and when you talk to
[38:46] your husband Jesus be like no not that
[38:47] one I already see where it's going to
[38:49] lead you right so that's the first thing
[38:52] she should have done was uh go and talk
[38:54] to her husband because Adam already
[38:56] handled the serpent before the the the
[38:59] garden was in peace and Harmony right
[39:02] and she said unto the serpent we may eat
[39:04] of the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[39:05] but of the tree of the fruit which is in
[39:07] the midst of the garden God hath said ye
[39:09] shall not eat of neither ye shall touch
[39:10] it least ye die and that's good because
[39:13] she was quoting a word back and the
[39:15] serpent said unto her ye shall not
[39:17] surely die for God do know that the day
[39:20] ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[39:22] open and you shall be as Gods knowing
[39:25] Good and Evil
[39:27] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[39:28] good for food and that it was pleasant
[39:30] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[39:32] make one wise she took of the fruit and
[39:34] did eat and here's a here's the verse
[39:37] when and gave also unto her husband and
[39:39] I can imagine in that
[39:41] moment Adam Adam knew Eve Adam knew her
[39:46] characteristics and when he saw Eve come
[39:48] up there and give her fruit like take
[39:50] this fruit Adam he said hold on a second
[39:52] I have never seen you talk like that
[39:53] before I ain't never seen you act like
[39:55] that before to me something must be
[39:58] wrong right something must be wrong and
[40:00] the day that we believe that God owes us
[40:04] something the prophet said one time he
[40:06] was trying to uh heal this girl and God
[40:09] wouldn't do it and we got it in the
[40:10] brother's chat and he started
[40:12] complaining to God and why ain't you
[40:14] doing this and the prophet said God left
[40:15] him alone the day you start complaining
[40:17] God will leave you alone in your
[40:19] thoughts right getting out of place that
[40:22] that day the prophet which was a she in
[40:26] the relationship with God tried to take
[40:27] on a he say God why' you do this God
[40:30] said hold on a second I'll leave you
[40:33] alone so you can figure out who you are
[40:35] and then come back to me amen and so
[40:39] that's how Eve that's how Eve got out of
[40:43] her place Adam knew something was wrong
[40:46] because Eve never acted like that before
[40:48] Eve never acted like that before and and
[40:50] in the closing statement I want to say
[40:52] she was deceived and I was thinking
[40:55] about when she was was deceived and the
[40:57] uh the serpent has was telling her that
[40:58] she could be like God I was thinking you
[41:01] know she was already
[41:03] God she was already God God had already
[41:06] created her to be God what is God God is
[41:08] eternal life she already had eternal
[41:11] life and still has eternal life right
[41:13] and I thought well she was going to get
[41:15] knowledge she had knowledge in the tree
[41:17] of life if she wanted knowledge she
[41:19] could have gone to Jesus the tree was
[41:21] there for her to eat of as much as she
[41:23] wanted but God began to talk to me
[41:26] and he said that um the problem wasn't
[41:29] her desire for knowledge because she had
[41:31] knowledge in Christ she had knowledge in
[41:33] her husband she had knowledge in God God
[41:36] in the cool of the evening every day
[41:38] came down and talk to his children there
[41:39] was a knowledge there she had knowledge
[41:42] her problem was her desire to have
[41:44] knowledge without a headship she wanted
[41:47] to know things without her head right
[41:49] she wanted to be a big God instead of a
[41:52] little God but God didn't create her to
[41:54] be in that place amen so in closing uh
[41:59] we have to we have to recognize the
[42:02] place God has placed us because that is
[42:05] the place that gives us power because in
[42:08] my Christian walk what I'm beginning to
[42:10] learn is that it's not our job to fight
[42:13] it's not our job to fight Satan it's not
[42:15] our job to try to try to argue with him
[42:18] and try to prove if you know prove the
[42:20] word of God to him and this and that
[42:22] it's not our job to do any of those
[42:23] things it's our job to rest God Rest in
[42:27] God and let him do the work because he
[42:29] is the masculine and the thing about it
[42:31] a lot of males a lot of females I see
[42:34] they have these disagreements with God
[42:36] that they don't just understand men men
[42:38] just like to get stuff done and that's
[42:40] something that I realize I've been
[42:42] reading this book um it's kind of like
[42:44] the Men Are from Mars Women Are from
[42:46] Venus book kind of a variation of that
[42:48] and I began to realize these things and
[42:50] look at the relationship with my mom and
[42:52] my sister to realize how different we
[42:54] are a man just wants to get the solution
[42:56] solution done he just wants to get it
[42:58] done he don't want to hear nothing else
[43:01] where did he get that Spirit from he got
[43:03] it from God cuz God just wants to see
[43:06] what can he do in your life and get
[43:08] something done and just wants you to
[43:10] yield yield yourself in your being to
[43:12] him so he can accomplish it and uh bring
[43:15] about those desired fruits
[43:18] amen all right let us bow our heads um
[43:22] and go before
[43:24] God Lord Jesus Christ Christ we thank
[43:27] you oh Lord God for the word you've
[43:29] given us oh Lord God and uh um the
[43:32] fruits oh Lord God and the seeds that
[43:34] you've planted in us oh Lord God lord we
[43:37] ask oh Lord God that you give us the
[43:39] strength to water them oh Lord God to
[43:41] know oh Lord God that the battle is not
[43:43] ours oh Lord God but it's yours oh Lord
[43:46] Jesus Christ it's not our job to heal
[43:48] ourselves oh Lord God it's not our job
[43:50] to deliver ourselves oh Lord God it's
[43:53] not our job to save ourselves because we
[43:55] couldn't do it in the first place oh
[43:57] Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord God The Battle
[44:00] Belongs to you oh Lord God you are the
[44:03] mighty conqueror and the champion oh
[44:04] Lord God help us yield ourselves to you
[44:07] oh Lord God and praise you through the
[44:09] hard times through the ups and downs oh
[44:11] Lord Jesus Christ Lord help us not
[44:13] complain oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we
[44:16] know Lord God that in the worshiping in
[44:18] the waiting oh Lord Jesus Christ that
[44:21] it's we don't let the thought come to us
[44:23] oh Lord that you're not doing nothing oh
[44:25] Lord God oh lord your servant Daniel
[44:27] Lord God was praying one time and he
[44:29] needed a word from you but he was being
[44:32] delayed oh Lord because in the spiritual
[44:34] realm there was a fight going on oh Lord
[44:36] God so that means that even though we're
[44:38] waiting and suffering oh Lord God you
[44:40] still fighting to get your uh
[44:43] Deliverance to us oh Lord God you're
[44:44] still fighting you're still putting in
[44:46] effort you're exerting Force oh Lord God
[44:49] to come and help us oh Lord God Lord
[44:51] help us oh Lord to keep our eyes on that
[44:54] spiritual that Faith sight to know oh
[44:56] Lord God that your word will come and
[44:58] accomplish what it needs to do oh Lord
[45:00] God oh Lord we thank you for all that
[45:02] you're doing in the precious name of
[45:03] Jesus Christ
[45:05] amen
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:15] amen amen thank you brother God bless
[45:18] God bless amen praise the Lord that
[45:22] young man did a good job tonight amen
[45:25] amen gave us a lot of things to to think
[45:29] about
[45:30] amen
[45:32] uh make our efforts not in vain amen
[45:36] when we can come amen and hear the word
[45:39] of God Amen speak to just what we need
[45:43] just exactly what we need I hope we
[45:45] don't take these things for granted amen
[45:47] because it you know one thing he was
[45:50] saying he said about the man you know as
[45:53] being the head no we're not the head
[45:55] we're father following him and it's
[45:58] important for us as men to understand
[46:00] that if we're not following him then
[46:02] we're out of place and if we're out of
[46:05] place the woman is not obligated to
[46:06] follow a man that's out of
[46:09] place but if that man is in
[46:13] place amen amen so you know we just have
[46:17] to just it's just a continuation one of
[46:20] the things I recognize in that we know
[46:22] what kind of um uh uh Miss on the
[46:26] pastor's heart and how Sunday the
[46:29] brother came and just picked right up on
[46:31] that thought and then brother Quinton
[46:33] come in and preach this this is not a
[46:36] man right this is God speaking yes sir
[46:40] amen so you know one thing that I was
[46:43] just kind of studying uh and and from
[46:47] Colossians uh 1 chapter 16th verse says
[46:50] uh for by him were all things
[46:53] created that are in heaven
[46:56] and that are in Earth visible and
[46:59] invisible whether there be Thrones and
[47:02] dominions or principalities or Powers
[47:05] all things were created by Him and for
[47:09] him and he is before all things and by
[47:13] and by him all things were created so
[47:16] when he created the animals and
[47:17] everything and he gave gave uh uh Adam
[47:22] the responsibility of naming those each
[47:25] the name comes with the
[47:27] characteristic of that animal exactly
[47:30] right so when we got out of the place we
[47:32] lose our identity and we lose the
[47:35] characteristics of what you're being
[47:36] called so what you're being called
[47:39] identifies your character yes sir amen
[47:43] right amen it identifies your character
[47:46] and you get out of place then it's not
[47:49] perfect you lose your character you lose
[47:51] that identity he called an eagle an
[47:54] eagle and look how many many times in
[47:56] the scriptures referenced an eagle and
[47:58] how and what it means to us today yes
[48:00] sir he created the flower we called it a
[48:02] lily then Christ came as the lily of the
[48:06] valley so everything that was created
[48:08] was for by him and for him to identify
[48:12] him yes sir
[48:14] amen and when you get out of that it
[48:16] identifies something totally
[48:17] different amen you love the Lord amen
[48:21] amen listen uh they not just giving this
[48:24] stuff out that's the truth no they
[48:26] they're not just giving this kind of
[48:28] word out I'm telling you so we
[48:30] appreciate God and we count it all joy
[48:33] Amen to be sitting Amen in a place where
[48:36] we can be fed Eagle
[48:39] food in this hour to be fed Eagle food
[48:42] one not too long ago my wife showed
[48:45] me a little thing now they call it a
[48:48] church I can't call it a church but they
[48:51] have
[48:52] churches that have received the spirit
[48:55] of Satan and have allowed things to come
[48:59] in and call it a homosexual church and
[49:01] you ought to see the
[49:03] filth but they think they worshiping
[49:06] God and they feel a real
[49:10] anointing feel a real anointing and in
[49:14] there just Lord have mercy what a mess
[49:18] what
[49:18] filth but we ought to thank God that we
[49:21] are in a place where we can be edified
[49:25] that we can be taught truth our children
[49:28] can sit under the umbrella of truth yes
[49:31] sir amen that's just a wonderful thing

[49:39] uh announcements

[50:19] identified the problem and we're
[50:22] continuing to identify to make the
[50:25] experience a more pleasurable
[50:28] experience um one of the things is you
[50:31] know the the internet service that we
[50:33] were using amen was sometime glitchy but
[50:36] we think we've come up with a uh
[50:38] solution where we won't have that
[50:41] problem um any longer it's going to be
[50:43] much better once we get in our permanent
[50:45] facility much better once we get in our

[51:06] can't modify things because we're here
[51:08] in the school and we can't um adjust it
[51:11] according to our needs but once we get
[51:13] into our own facility amen we'll be able
[51:16] to do things and the beautiful thing
[51:18] about it we'll be able to leave it set
[51:21] up that's right we won't have to take it
[51:25] down
[51:26] throw it in the car come back and then
[51:29] set it up again and see in that kind of
[51:31] CAS sometime we forget to push one
[51:33] button yeah oh that's the problem but
[51:38] see when we get to our our uh permanent
[51:40] location we'll be able to leave it there
[51:44] and everything will go a lot smoother so
