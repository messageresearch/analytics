[1:11:28] we thank you we give you glory amen
[1:11:31] shall we give praise be to God shall we
[1:11:42] be seated the Lord is good
[1:11:44] amen and whenever the Lord bring us here
[1:11:47] he has something little for us amen so
[1:11:50] we just want to continue what we
[1:11:52] ministered at a time on the Good
[1:11:55] Samaritan and see what a lot of leaders
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:58] before we came to this earth we were a
[1:12:01] China in God before we ever drop here as
[1:12:05] human beings to begin this life we were
[1:12:08] some way amen
[1:12:09] just like coming from your home to this
[1:12:11] place before you came here you came from
[1:12:13] your home to the church and so before we
[1:12:16] drop in time and on earth we assisted in
[1:12:19] the mind of God amen
[1:12:21] so the book of Sam Sam chapter 91 verse
[1:12:24] 1 and 2 if you can read it
[1:12:26] just a short Scripture some 91 chapter
[1:12:34] 91 verse 1 and 2
[1:12:41] some 91 one and two
[1:12:43] he says he that dwells in the secret
[1:12:46] place of the Most High shall abide under
[1:12:49] the shadow of the Almighty
[1:12:51] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[1:12:53] and my fortress my god in him Allah
[1:12:57] trust amen
[1:12:58] shall we be seated so he who dwell in
[1:13:02] the secret place of the almighty we
[1:13:04] dwell in the secret place of the
[1:13:06] Almighty
[1:13:07] amen that was the Silesia dimension
[1:13:09] before we ever drop here and we drop
[1:13:12] here in time to begin the attribute of
[1:13:15] God amen let's go back a little bit
[1:13:17] before even God became God we have we
[1:13:20] thank all of our prophet he said that
[1:13:22] before he became God he was called
[1:13:23] Elohim he was soft assistant amen
[1:13:27] he wasn't God because God is object of
[1:13:29] adoration and worship and before he
[1:13:32] created angels and human beings and the
[1:13:34] trees and the moon and the Sun to
[1:13:35] worship Him we were in him in another
[1:13:38] dimension amen
[1:13:40] as job said when it job went through
[1:13:42] trials you know sometime when you go to
[1:13:44] try us we kind of our eyes become a
[1:13:46] little bit blurry we don't see well so
[1:13:48] job was thinking that was the end of him
[1:13:50] he forgot about where he came from and
[1:13:52] who he was so the Lord asked him Joe
[1:13:55] where were you when the sons and
[1:13:57] daughters of God sang in adoration
[1:13:58] before even the foundation of the world
[1:14:01] so sometimes God remind us of who we are
[1:14:03] events so we went in him we were
[1:14:06] assistant in him not in his flesh not in
[1:14:09] this material but we exist in him in a
[1:14:12] celestial body amen
[1:14:13] as part of Christ amen the professor
[1:14:16] that the thought of God maybe we read it
[1:14:18] in the course of time is that God has
[1:14:20] his own thoughts the thought of God God
[1:14:23] is not like my thoughts amen it's not
[1:14:25] like your thought well maybe when you
[1:14:26] what think about building a house or
[1:14:28] buying a car you have to think about it
[1:14:30] which car do I want to buy how many
[1:14:33] bedrooms do I want to have but God
[1:14:35] thought it's not like that is atena amen
[1:14:39] and the best way we can describe God's
[1:14:41] thought is like the number zero the
[1:14:43] number zero has no brick just keep going
[1:14:46] and going and going and going
[1:14:48] so in God thought you existed you were
[1:14:51] part of him not just like a human
[1:14:53] thought by you existed in the Silesia or
[1:14:56] in the through phonic form amen you were
[1:14:58] part of God's life you were just as
[1:15:00] atena
[1:15:00] as crisis amen but God we had an
[1:15:04] attributes we had certain features
[1:15:06] characters it characteristics in us to
[1:15:08] manifest so God begin to unveil Ram said
[1:15:12] that the fred sanger created was angels
[1:15:13] and then they do begin to worship him
[1:15:16] then he became God because God is
[1:15:18] something that we worship amen
[1:15:20] and so that attribute begin to manifest
[1:15:22] as an object of worship but that was in
[1:15:25] the end there was more attribute in God
[1:15:27] attribute of a king of a judge of a
[1:15:30] mother of a father of a priests of a son
[1:15:34] of a child that's why God became a child
[1:15:37] like a baby
[1:15:37] amen to be born by Mary amen
[1:15:40] so those attributes were in God way in
[1:15:43] us but then something has to happen to
[1:15:45] be manifested so God among the Angels
[1:15:48] created we know Lucifer he wasn't
[1:15:50] sitting then amen
[1:15:51] the Bible said that he was perfect when
[1:15:53] he was created but there was a put in
[1:15:55] him there was a purpose in him many a
[1:15:59] time we cry or the devil the devil that
[1:16:01] was just plain his rule
[1:16:05] he's not a creator he cannot create one
[1:16:09] little bitty thing no you cannot even
[1:16:11] create an atom he's not a creator by you
[1:16:13] and I we are creators amen because we
[1:16:16] are part of Elohim but then God has to
[1:16:18] creat the devil or Lucifer to function
[1:16:21] in a certain way so that we can bring
[1:16:23] the attribute of redemption into
[1:16:25] manifestation so we know the Bible said
[1:16:28] that he was perfect until what sin Oh a
[1:16:30] new key to was found in him that is when
[1:16:32] you begin to manifest is true callus
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:35] so he brought order we know what is
[1:16:37] going on in the world but it's all for
[1:16:38] purpose amen
[1:16:39] that was actually working for you and I
[1:16:42] because without that we cannot manifest
[1:16:45] what is in US without Satan God cannot
[1:16:49] be a redeemer
[1:16:51] amen without somebody sick at the
[1:16:53] hospital doctors nurses pharmacists who
[1:16:55] don't have what to do amen
[1:16:58] so there should be somebody sick for the
[1:17:00] doctor to go to work and work there
[1:17:02] should be a fallen man for God to come
[1:17:04] down and any time and and redeem the
[1:17:06] funny man amen so Satan is doing just
[1:17:09] exactly the lord puddi puddi nod to do
[1:17:11] he's not nothing bigger the professor
[1:17:14] and I think an invisible union that when
[1:17:15] you get to know us opposition in Christ
[1:17:17] that would be useless helpless don't
[1:17:20] nothin in our presence Amen because the
[1:17:24] creative power of God is in you by the
[1:17:26] Holy Ghost baptism by Christ in you by
[1:17:29] the pillow finding your heart you can
[1:17:31] create you don't have a beginning you
[1:17:34] only begin in this flesh but your life
[1:17:36] that you have watches the China is like
[1:17:38] a zero it's just on and on and on and on
[1:17:40] with no beginning amen
[1:17:42] so God had this or it can attribute in
[1:17:45] him they begin to create the first one
[1:17:47] we know he created Adam to be a little
[1:17:49] Redeemer a lot of God on earth amen and
[1:17:52] when you read the book of Genesis said
[1:17:53] Adam what name the things that God
[1:17:56] created what is the name did Anna did
[1:17:59] Adam use languages like a lion and a
[1:18:01] zebra and human beasts no Adam was a
[1:18:04] creator just like his maker so the Holy
[1:18:07] Ghost
[1:18:07] Adam was bringing the earthly things
[1:18:08] into manifestation glory hallelujah
[1:18:11] because God is full of love
[1:18:14] amen and as a father you don't want to
[1:18:16] have a baby bring forth a child who is
[1:18:18] going to
[1:18:19] maybe all his or her life you want a
[1:18:22] baby to walk when your baby begin to
[1:18:24] walk you are so happy oh she's taking
[1:18:25] some steps beautiful I mean oh she's
[1:18:28] walking now now she could eat babies
[1:18:30] begin to drink milk but in the course of
[1:18:32] time they look at their mother try to
[1:18:33] get some food from their mother oh now
[1:18:35] she's it is solid food oh praise God
[1:18:37] hallelujah and that attribute is in God
[1:18:39] - amen
[1:18:41] it doesn't want us to be at the hospital
[1:18:43] of redemption all the time but he want
[1:18:45] us to be sons and daughters of God
[1:18:47] walking and manifesting Jesus Christ
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:56] glory hallelujah and so all these
[1:18:59] attributes were in our Father way in us
[1:19:01] I want us to read a little codes from
[1:19:05] the Prophet message from the church age
[1:19:06] book Smith's manage a checkbook if the
[1:19:09] brothers can help me just a second
[1:19:14] please
[1:19:19] god bless you praise God hallelujah God
[1:19:25] is good anyways amen
[1:19:27] so the Lord he has those attributes the
[1:19:30] professor that before the foundation of
[1:19:32] the world we were part of him we were
[1:19:34] part of his life
[1:19:35] we were creators just like God but then
[1:19:38] God hast would give us this a monisha
[1:19:41] instead of coming by the spoken word
[1:19:43] like Jesus we didn't come by the spoken
[1:19:45] word like we know amen we came by God by
[1:19:48] the civilization of the devil which is
[1:19:50] what sex birth and so that put a
[1:19:52] limitation and blindness in our eyes we
[1:19:55] didn't even know who we were or that we
[1:19:57] know is the earthly things everybody's
[1:19:58] struggling for money
[1:19:59] popularity power and things like that
[1:20:01] but in us we're attributes of redemption
[1:20:04] I don't know if you can get is a
[1:20:06] paragraph 140 49 as position of the
[1:20:12] syringe hig Church edges the Smiths
[1:20:14] manage a checkbook paragraph 149 but
[1:20:19] let's go ahead if the Academy will
[1:20:20] continue
[1:20:21] amen god is good lessen the cost let's
[1:20:25] read our main scripture in the course of
[1:20:27] that if you can read a Luke chapter 10
[1:20:29] that is the main scripture when I use
[1:20:32] get it other way Luke chapter 10 the
[1:20:38] story of the Good Samaritan there's 32
[1:20:47] let's say 36 Luke chapter 10 32 36
[1:20:53] somebody want to read for us any other
[1:20:56] brothers brother Mike first now by
[1:21:14] chance a certain priest came down the
[1:21:16] road and when he saw him he passed by
[1:21:18] one on the other side likewise a Levite
[1:21:21] when he arrived at the place came and
[1:21:23] looked passed by on the other side but a
[1:21:26] certain Samaritan as he journeyed came
[1:21:28] where he was and when he saw him he had
[1:21:31] compassion so he went to him and
[1:21:34] bandaged his wounds pouring on oil wine
[1:21:37] and he set him on his own animal brought
[1:21:40] him to him and took care of him
[1:21:43] on the next day when he departed he took
[1:21:46] out two denarii
[1:21:48] gave them to to the innkeeper and said
[1:21:51] to him take care of him and whatever
[1:21:53] more you spend when I come again I will
[1:21:56] repay him to pay you so which of these
[1:21:59] three do you think was neighbor to him
[1:22:02] who fell among the thieves amen praise
[1:22:05] God thank you brother god bless you amen
[1:22:14] so which of this is his neighbors as we
[1:22:16] know we we talk about the Good Samaritan
[1:22:18] we know we're in a part mind of God
[1:22:21] Jerusalem means God city of peace amen
[1:22:24] Jeremy's God in the Hebrew language
[1:22:26] Shalom or Salam means peace that's why
[1:22:30] we get peace Shalom peace be unto you
[1:22:32] so we went in the city of peace
[1:22:34] comfortable didn't we know what is law
[1:22:36] what is sin what is unbelief what is
[1:22:38] ungodliness it wasn't part of that
[1:22:41] civilization amen but then we had this
[1:22:44] attribute in us to manifest
[1:22:46] we begin our journey to from Jerusalem
[1:22:48] to Jericho what is from eternity to this
[1:22:50] earth in time to manifest the eternal
[1:22:53] attribute of Christ so Jericho is the
[1:22:55] earth which is in time which we begin
[1:22:58] our journey now in the coming from
[1:23:01] Jerusalem to Jericho originally the
[1:23:03] original plan of God was to come by the
[1:23:05] spoken word of God is to come by the
[1:23:07] mouth of brother Jack but it's cooking
[1:23:09] when when he pretty wet there's a
[1:23:11] creative power there's a creative force
[1:23:13] to create sons and daughters of God just
[1:23:16] like God speak his word into creation
[1:23:18] just like God speak Adam into creation
[1:23:20] but we know we didn't come by that route
[1:23:22] because we came by that route there will
[1:23:25] be nothing to redeem so the devil
[1:23:27] Lucifer was making a way for God or for
[1:23:30] us to bring our Redemption retentive
[1:23:32] attribute in us amen so the thief the
[1:23:35] man fell among thieves
[1:23:37] on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho
[1:23:38] which beat him took his money his
[1:23:41] virtues robbing from everything that he
[1:23:44] had and this one was half dead half
[1:23:46] alive amen why was he half dead because
[1:23:49] by his own virtues he was one a sinner
[1:23:52] should a sex bed there was nothing good
[1:23:54] about us amen but at the same time there
[1:23:58] was something living in us there was a
[1:24:00] seed of God what is the City of God it's
[1:24:03] not like a mango seed but is the thought
[1:24:05] of God concerning you and I amen before
[1:24:12] your body was dropped here you were that
[1:24:15] part of God as we are talking about this
[1:24:18] flesh was just people working on this
[1:24:20] flesh your flesh my flesh amen it was
[1:24:23] also elected but it wasn't in any form
[1:24:26] it was in the form of Solomon it wasn't
[1:24:28] in my phone
[1:24:29] it was just calcium potassium aluminium
[1:24:32] chlorine cosmic light on this earth amen
[1:24:36] but at a point a time God using your mom
[1:24:39] and your dad to bring their life if you
[1:24:42] if you can notice I don't know sometime
[1:24:43] pregnant women when they are pregnant
[1:24:45] they eat something strange food food
[1:24:47] that they are not used to let me give
[1:24:49] example maybe somebody might have
[1:24:50] married for some time their wives it or
[1:24:52] I don't like perhaps I don't like
[1:24:54] seafood
[1:24:54] but now she's pregnant she's calling for
[1:24:56] seafood why the sisters know what I'm
[1:24:59] talking about
[1:25:00] why is she calling for craps why is she
[1:25:02] calling for shrimps because the body the
[1:25:05] baby of the body needs calcium in this
[1:25:07] phosphorus and potassium to be born
[1:25:09] right so the mother who is a creator who
[1:25:12] is part of God is calling for that into
[1:25:14] creation amen
[1:25:15] so that your body that is lying down
[1:25:18] through the famine through grocery
[1:25:20] through Tomatoes through potatoes
[1:25:22] through corn your body that was elected
[1:25:25] before the foundation of the world will
[1:25:27] be coming to form that you are in amen
[1:25:29] so the mother who is part of God was
[1:25:33] building this body together with God God
[1:25:35] put the first in their mother the mother
[1:25:37] say oh I want to sweetheart I want this
[1:25:38] I want chips I want a potato
[1:25:41] I want fries I want this he's creating
[1:25:44] calling the body of the son or the
[1:25:45] daughter into a form into creation into
[1:25:49] a manifestation as it was redeemed
[1:25:51] before the foundation of the world so
[1:25:52] this baby is born healthy profit normal
[1:25:55] will sustain element from the professor
[1:25:57] that when a baby is in the womb the baby
[1:25:59] doesn't have their life is just living
[1:26:01] on the muscles of the of the mother amen
[1:26:03] very comfortable now when a baby draws
[1:26:06] on earth if he's a pretty steady baby of
[1:26:08] God goddess within a life form and this
[1:26:11] life goes right into the baby then the
[1:26:13] baby begin to yell life begins for the
[1:26:15] baby
[1:26:15] amen why do baby cry when they are born
[1:26:18] so the sisters can tell me what did they
[1:26:20] cry they were in the comfortable room of
[1:26:24] the mother
[1:26:24] now they drop on the earth sometimes
[1:26:26] they have to spank them to breathe
[1:26:27] oxygen
[1:26:28] suffering begins just like a man the
[1:26:31] story of the Good Samaritan so life has
[1:26:33] began for the baby now he has to breathe
[1:26:35] oxygen not through their mother he also
[1:26:37] uses nostrils he has to begin to crawl
[1:26:40] he also begin to nest from the mother's
[1:26:42] breast so now life has begun for the
[1:26:44] baby just the same way this Samaritan
[1:26:47] was this person on the route from
[1:26:49] Jerusalem to Jericho began his life now
[1:26:52] when he was that a Bible said as we
[1:26:54] ready said the Good Samaritan poured oil
[1:26:56] and wine into his wound we are where
[1:27:00] Bruce we were tortured you were useless
[1:27:03] we were worthless
[1:27:04] we were smelling in sin my god what what
[1:27:07] is the oil the holy goose
[1:27:09] what is the wine the stimulation of the
[1:27:12] revelation
[1:27:13] when you hear the word when you hear the
[1:27:16] ego message stimulate your heart no I'm
[1:27:20] not just a human being
[1:27:22] I am part of my father I'm a daughter of
[1:27:25] the great ego among eaglets I'm not
[1:27:29] bound under chicken I'm not a Dean for
[1:27:31] denomination this is no way I belong to
[1:27:33] you now this doctrine Trinity is
[1:27:35] smelling it there's no what I'm supposed
[1:27:36] to be and you dick you to death sitting
[1:27:38] you the wine and the oil begin to
[1:27:40] stimulate you and begin toward the
[1:27:43] attribute of God of redemption we do to
[1:27:45] move you from the denomination from sin
[1:27:47] from unbelief in toward into the real
[1:27:50] you amen
[1:27:51] the ray you is what the Word made flesh
[1:27:55] it is Jesus Christ in your flesh it is
[1:27:57] the pillar of fire in you so you hear
[1:28:00] but our dad preaching you hear a brother
[1:28:02] and sister giving testimony I've never
[1:28:04] had this before I've been in church for
[1:28:06] maybe thirty years I've been in Roman
[1:28:08] Catholic Baptist Pentecostal and Namur
[1:28:11] the denomination I've never heard
[1:28:12] anything like this before and it dawns
[1:28:15] on your heart it plays deep calling for
[1:28:17] the deep amen and that is who you are
[1:28:20] amen so now this man who this person put
[1:28:24] him in an inn then in a significant
[1:28:26] significant hospital and also signified
[1:28:28] Redemption amen
[1:28:30] so God has redeemed this man but that is
[1:28:32] not the end of the story
[1:28:33] you don't go to hospital have a surgery
[1:28:36] you get world and you stare at a
[1:28:37] hospital forever no you go back to your
[1:28:39] house go back to job and do things
[1:28:41] you're supposed to do
[1:28:42] amen so God didn't redeem us just to be
[1:28:45] redeemed and just sit down God has a
[1:28:48] word for you to do
[1:28:53] the Holy Ghost has a redemptive
[1:28:55] attribute that you are also going to
[1:28:57] redeem others amen
[1:28:59] it could be your family maybe you are
[1:29:00] not supposed to preach my brother Jack
[1:29:02] you are not going to be a pastor library
[1:29:03] Jack you are no good to be but Ibraham
[1:29:05] going around the world seven times but
[1:29:07] in your own home you've got to go around
[1:29:09] your home seven times remain in your
[1:29:12] family you got to go around your family
[1:29:13] seven times all that your children your
[1:29:16] parents your uncle's your loved ones
[1:29:18] their lives has been coded into your
[1:29:21] heart
[1:29:21] amen so anti you the Lord is using you
[1:29:24] to bring them also out from from sin and
[1:29:27] unbelief to into redemption into the in
[1:29:30] into the sill of the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:29:32] entire demon you understand you but you
[1:29:34] had a redeemer just like I did
[1:29:35] understand Jesus Christ you have toward
[1:29:37] keep believing keep trusting keep
[1:29:39] praying for them keep applying the token
[1:29:42] in your heart upon your family amen and
[1:29:45] as you keep applying the creative voice
[1:29:47] of God which is in you will bring them
[1:29:49] into creation amen so this man that the
[1:29:52] Bible said that he was put on a beast
[1:29:54] what is the Beast is the power of God if
[1:29:56] you look at we have time we can read a
[1:29:58] John chapter 1 verse 10
[1:30:10] sorry John 1:12 the book of John chapter
[1:30:16] 1 verse 12 it says but as many as
[1:30:20] received him to them gave he power to
[1:30:23] become sons of God even to them that
[1:30:25] believe on his name Amen
[1:30:32] so does that receive Jesus Christ he
[1:30:35] give them power what is the power the
[1:30:38] Holy Ghost amen what is holy goose is
[1:30:40] eloheem himself what is the Elohim is a
[1:30:43] tree of life it is the true you amen
[1:30:47] it is your celestial body it is that one
[1:30:49] that has no beginning has no end
[1:30:51] this guy just like you clooth he has a
[1:30:54] beginning that's why we have birthdays
[1:30:55] right we celebrate one day we're gonna
[1:30:58] celebrate the last birthday but that is
[1:31:00] not the end of us the true bara Mike the
[1:31:03] true brother Jack is right on the inside
[1:31:05] he has no beginning he has no end he's
[1:31:08] like a zero he's just wanted to manifest
[1:31:10] and manifest and manifest amen
[1:31:12] so we are still on to Redemption we are
[1:31:15] not afraid of death we are not afraid of
[1:31:16] Hell we are not afraid of sin because we
[1:31:19] are more than that Amen we are part of
[1:31:22] Christ himself we are manifestation of
[1:31:24] Jesus Christ on earth now amen
[1:31:27] if the Lord will do something on earth
[1:31:28] is not going to bypass you is going to
[1:31:30] do it through you amen you can find a
[1:31:35] code for me praise God hallelujah the
[1:31:40] Lord is good okay let's go on let me
[1:31:45] read this code in the in the stead of
[1:31:47] that until we get it let's read I don't
[1:31:49] know if this one it's coming from it's
[1:31:55] coming from I don't know the message
[1:31:57] title but I think it's coming from the
[1:31:59] year is 1950 August 14th 15 so 50 - 0 8
[1:32:07] - 1 4e 15 it was a healing of a blind
[1:32:12] man in Camden a cancer but I can't read
[1:32:15] it from here if they if they if they get
[1:32:17] it now but Rama was talking about going
[1:32:19] through a cancer Camden
[1:32:21] and then he met came across this man who
[1:32:24] was blind he was a colored person in
[1:32:26] those time they had segregation which
[1:32:27] they called a Jim Crow law is that right
[1:32:29] so let's see what happened let's see
[1:32:31] what is behind you but the Bible said
[1:32:33] that all heaven and all eternity is
[1:32:35] behind and in you and before you amen so
[1:32:39] let's see let's read from a thank you
[1:32:42] brother
[1:32:42] that's from testimony let's read from
[1:32:47] and is that I had somebody Halloween
[1:32:50] messy messy messy okay we are right
[1:32:53] there right
[1:32:54] okay let me see the same things that may
[1:32:57] seem messy and I'm happy to turn and
[1:32:59] look standing off to himself in Arkansas
[1:33:02] they have what they call a Jim Crow law
[1:33:03] colored and white can't can be together
[1:33:06] I'm from the south but I don't think
[1:33:09] that is right so I look over and there's
[1:33:11] two that they're still an OBE for old a
[1:33:13] poor old colored man standing there a
[1:33:16] jet little rim of white hair and his
[1:33:19] hair he had his cup in his hand his wife
[1:33:22] was standing by him and he had his hands
[1:33:24] up blind as he could be saying massive
[1:33:27] mercy that she has streaming down his
[1:33:29] cheek that was the other contrast the
[1:33:32] contrast of suffering before the law
[1:33:34] before the Lord who bring Redemption is
[1:33:36] love he asked allow the devil to put us
[1:33:38] in the condition of suffering and in
[1:33:40] pain and in sin so that you can see the
[1:33:43] Magnificent love of God so this one was
[1:33:47] blind as blind could be he couldn't see
[1:33:49] the tears coming down his cheek I
[1:33:51] thought of old blind Bartimaeus standing
[1:33:53] at the gates of Jericho sometime what
[1:33:55] God is about to fulfill a scripture he
[1:33:57] put you back in the scriptures already
[1:33:59] fulfilled amen is that a blind but he
[1:34:03] was standing at the gates of Jericho
[1:34:04] looking around studying moving on the
[1:34:07] Holy Spirit said go over there where he
[1:34:09] sat I turn I turn aside they said don't
[1:34:12] go there bruh bruh I said but the Holy
[1:34:14] Spirit tells me go over there I went
[1:34:17] over there and that drawed and they draw
[1:34:19] a ring I never forget what his wife said
[1:34:21] she said they passed the person and them
[1:34:24] coming to you honey I walk over the edge
[1:34:27] where he was his old feeble hand said is
[1:34:30] that you pass on Brian
[1:34:32] I said yes a he thought my face he said
[1:34:35] you use a young man I said not to young

[1:34:45] me I said yes sir he said my old mummy
[1:34:48] had religion like you got religion said
[1:34:51] she never told me a lie in all her life
[1:34:54] said Pastor Brian she's been dead now
[1:34:57] many years said I've been blind and
[1:35:00] drawing a blind pension for about 10
[1:35:02] years said I lived about 200 miles from
[1:35:05] here I never heard of you in my life but
[1:35:08] said this morning about 3 o clock I woke
[1:35:11] up in the room and of course I can see
[1:35:14] but to look right standing before me
[1:35:16] stood my old mummy this is a man who is
[1:35:19] tone blind how come you could see its
[1:35:22] own mummy what kind of ice this ice is

[1:39:36] Luke chapter 17 verse 21 he said people
[1:39:39] were the Pharisees came to Jesus they
[1:39:41] were talking about where is the kingdom
[1:39:42] of God
[1:39:43] some said is in the north some said is
[1:39:45] in the south but he said believe he not
[1:39:47] the kingdom of God doesn't come with
[1:39:49] observation but the kingdom of God is
[1:39:51] within you
[1:39:52] amen the kingdom of God is in your
[1:39:54] brother and your sister the Holy Ghost
[1:39:56] baptism is a new that is the celestial
[1:39:59] body amen that's why I posted that when
[1:40:02] this body is broken down we have another
[1:40:04] body we have another spirit we have
[1:40:06] another ghost when this Tabernacle is
[1:40:08] destroyed this is not the end of us this
[1:40:11] lady the woman her body was maybe in a
[1:40:13] cemetery somewhere in Arkansas but the
[1:40:16] real hair was in another dimension
[1:40:18] speaking to a Sun that go and see a man
[1:40:22] called Ram to pray for you maybe
[1:40:24] somebody speaking to you go and see a
[1:40:25] pastor core pastor Jack to pray for you
[1:40:28] sometime not all the people who come
[1:40:30] here were invited maybe the Avena is
[1:40:32] that nobody was invited this person and
[1:40:34] this person walked right into the church
[1:40:36] nobody invited him how did
[1:40:38] doesn't mean leave around the area but a
[1:40:40] semi seal the holy goose the gridview
[1:40:43] funny
[1:40:44] the mother ego brought him or her to
[1:40:46] hear the word of God amen glory
[1:40:49] hallelujah the Lord is good so now this
[1:40:53] Samaritan now the Lord put him on a
[1:40:55] beast which is power the power of God
[1:40:58] and I want us to see how God works in
[1:41:00] two ways one is redeeming you and the
[1:41:03] next step is giving you his power to do
[1:41:06] what you want you to do so let's read
[1:41:08] from Numbers chapter 10 verse 1 and 2
[1:41:28] numbers chapter 10 1 & 2
[1:41:39] the Bible said and the Lord speak unto
[1:41:41] Moses saying make the two trumpets of
[1:41:45] silver and of a whole piece thou shalt
[1:41:47] make them and that may use them for the
[1:41:49] callin of the assembly and for the
[1:41:52] ginning of the camps so one piece of
[1:41:55] trumpet a sorry of sava make two
[1:41:58] trumpets one called assembly and one to
[1:42:02] Jenny in the camps
[1:42:04] what does serve a significant as
[1:42:07] signified sorry server means what
[1:42:10] Redemption
[1:42:11] it means glory means and attributes of :
[1:42:16] of blowing trumpets so silver was to
[1:42:19] call sons and daughters of God just like
[1:42:22] a man who felt on the route from
[1:42:23] Jerusalem to Jericho God through the
[1:42:25] Good Samaritan Jesus Christ call you
[1:42:28] with us of a trumpet that my son this is
[1:42:30] no way you have belong to you're not
[1:42:31] going to die in your sin you are not
[1:42:33] going to dine in your problems
[1:42:35] I am your Redeemer so he came with a
[1:42:37] word of the hour and brought you from
[1:42:39] the sick condition and cleanse him
[1:42:42] washing from sin and unbelief but then
[1:42:45] he put a power of God the Holy Ghost
[1:42:47] which is the Beast the Beast in the
[1:42:48] Bible means power horse in the Bible
[1:42:51] means power is the power of God in the
[1:42:53] church amen
[1:42:54] the power of God is not in the collapse
[1:42:55] the power of God is not in Vatican but
[1:42:58] the Pope got is a humble man and humble
[1:43:00] past about a jack is Mohammed sisters
[1:43:02] and hammer brothers that is how God
[1:43:04] manifest his power God in simplicity God
[1:43:07] is not a complicated God he's very
[1:43:09] simple he's got all the power on earth
[1:43:11] but it's very simple amen
[1:43:13] so the power of God that's what trumpet
[1:43:16] one is to redeem us bring us onto the
[1:43:19] seal of God for you to know that you are
[1:43:21] not just idly bound you are not another
[1:43:23] chicken you are 2:14 one of you is the
[1:43:26] flesh which you go back to the dust and
[1:43:28] what the body through you is that chana
[1:43:30] life in you is Jesus Christ in you and
[1:43:33] Jesus Christ in you has no limitation if
[1:43:36] you can read a little garden simplicity
[1:43:41] if you can put on up 6 508 22m sorry
[1:43:47] limbs
[1:43:47] correct yeah 6 508 22m got in simply
[1:43:52] cinema hallelujah
[1:43:56] it's talking about the creative power of
[1:43:58] God in our lives and then what we get to
[1:44:00] know who we are their mother their voice
[1:44:02] even we don't even think about the devil
[1:44:03] we don't think about demons we don't
[1:44:06] think about circumstances when there's a
[1:44:08] circumstance
[1:44:09] it means the Holy Ghost is about to do
[1:44:10] something so you don't look at your
[1:44:12] circumstance you look at Christ in you
[1:44:15] the expression of glory it's not as
[1:44:17] something we hope for but it says
[1:44:19] present that life of Jesus Christ in us
[1:44:21] so let's see let's look at that
[1:44:24] scripture it's a lot Jesus in the way of
[1:44:28] humility in a way of humbleness in the
[1:44:31] way I offer you this congregation that
[1:44:33] is on their feet I offer them to you
[1:44:35] because they have stood in response to
[1:44:38] the call how many have responded to the
[1:44:39] call of God glory hallelujah
[1:44:42] they are second deep Athens we all seek
[1:44:43] in the patterns of God they are second
[1:44:46] more life after hearing that the blood
[1:44:47] of Jesus Christ who thoroughly cleanses
[1:44:50] and there's no more nothing that a
[1:44:52] complete Word of God rests within them
[1:44:55] how many I've got the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:44:57] that is the Word of God and this Holy
[1:44:59] Ghost
[1:45:00] rest within them that a very command of
[1:45:03] the Evoque that that the very command of
[1:45:06] their own voice is creative power amen
[1:45:11] that the very common of their own voice
[1:45:13] is a creative power so your voice is no
[1:45:19] longer just your voice your voice is not
[1:45:21] a voice of vanity but is a creative
[1:45:24] voice it is Jesus Christ speaking it is
[1:45:27] data speaking it's eternity speaking
[1:45:30] glory hallelujah because in them is the
[1:45:34] holy smoly ghost and this Holy Ghost is
[1:45:37] a creator amen
[1:45:39] so Holy Ghost is what is a creator and
[1:45:41] when the Holy Ghost comes into you would
[1:45:43] you become a creator because what about
[1:45:47] you eat you become what you eat amen
[1:45:50] when the human life eat flesh tomatoes
[1:45:52] mangoes chips corn whatever bread you
[1:45:56] bought human flesh you bought cells and
[1:45:58] tissues but then when the Holy Ghost in
[1:46:01] you the cry
[1:46:01] see you the City of God the Pinot fine
[1:46:04] you feed on the Word of God you become
[1:46:06] what you become Christ according to
[1:46:08] Genesis chapter 1 if Ethan brings forth
[1:46:10] after its kind human beings bring for
[1:46:13] the human beans monkeys bring forth
[1:46:15] monkeys goods bring for goods ship will
[1:46:17] bring for sheep so one God have children
[1:46:20] or God has children God bring forward
[1:46:22] God's glory hallelujah glory hallelujah
[1:46:28] so he said and this Holy Ghost is a
[1:46:31] creator he makes things come to pass
[1:46:34] because he speak the word and the word
[1:46:37] spoken becomes God in action the well
[1:46:42] spoken becomes God in action that is
[1:46:46] where the Lord wants us to be one part
[1:46:49] of the sava trumpet is to what is to
[1:46:51] bring redemption is to call us to
[1:46:53] assembly is to bring you to come and
[1:46:55] hear the word of brother Jack but
[1:46:57] there's another part that you want to go
[1:46:59] back you go back home you are going to
[1:47:01] express that life what you received from
[1:47:03] the church what you see from the word
[1:47:05] you are going back to express that
[1:47:07] creative voice in you because you are
[1:47:09] created just like your makeup just like
[1:47:11] our Father amen
[1:47:12] just like the pillar of fire that was
[1:47:14] the pillar of fire now is it in heaven
[1:47:16] somewhere tied in some way over the moon
[1:47:19] over the Pluto no it's right in your
[1:47:21] heart it doesn't matter that treasure
[1:47:25] comes your way just look within you look
[1:47:28] at Jesus he was a humble man he wasn't a
[1:47:30] giant he wasn't anybody but the fullness
[1:47:33] of Christ the whole eternity was in him
[1:47:35] one time we went to preach with a
[1:47:38] disciples and he was prophet it was a
[1:47:40] human being under present human being
[1:47:42] and her passing God so he got I'd like
[1:47:44] you get tired maybe have some low
[1:47:46] headache tired after preaching
[1:47:47] sleeping on the boat and now the devil
[1:47:50] said oh there's a time for me to drown
[1:47:51] him and his disciples so there was a
[1:47:53] tempest there was a stone and this boat
[1:47:56] was capsizing I mean floating up and
[1:47:58] down and it is supposed by then they
[1:48:00] habla we see the Aven know who they are
[1:48:01] so they go up and down just like Old
[1:48:05] Testament Saints God give them the
[1:48:07] anointing to do things of God then the
[1:48:10] Holy Ghost comes out they became human
[1:48:11] being but our covenant is not that way
[1:48:14] so pretend
[1:48:15] disciples were wondering Lord don't you
[1:48:18] care we are perishing
[1:48:19] so they woke him up so he woke up there
[1:48:21] was the problem
[1:48:22] don't you see that the Strom don't
[1:48:23] disagree operation is a tea of little
[1:48:26] faith strong bestow an order storm begin
[1:48:30] to come down and they said with this man
[1:48:32] that even the strong or be seen amen
[1:48:37] it wasn't assistant element that he was
[1:48:38] wearing it wasn't a flesh and blood
[1:48:40] hours that Tom were obeying but it was
[1:48:43] the deity of Christ in him Amen it was a
[1:48:46] Holy Ghost in him
[1:48:47] it was Elohim Christ in him that's why
[1:48:49] it's most important to barometer that
[1:48:51] the most important thing in your life is
[1:48:53] not money and gold but is what
[1:48:55] revelation of Jesus Christ personally in
[1:48:57] your heart amen
[1:48:59] because when you live here you can t put
[1:49:02] a job to your house no he loves you by
[1:49:04] the gospel Jack I've got trials in my
[1:49:07] workplace in my school please can you go
[1:49:09] with me in case at the trash can you had
[1:49:11] a past that you visit for me no here's
[1:49:13] what is here's good enough you know he
[1:49:16] has got a church on his shoulder so you
[1:49:18] have the Holy Ghost and whatever you go
[1:49:19] back home wherever on the streets you
[1:49:22] the Holy Ghost in you is going to face a
[1:49:24] trial and overcome that triumph and
[1:49:26] bring her testimony back to the church
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:30] you don't let a trial verkami you if the
[1:49:32] trial become it then we haven't known
[1:49:34] opposition yet but we have to know the
[1:49:36] opposition that you are a son a daughter
[1:49:37] of God you are not just a human being
[1:49:40] eating bread and corn and you die away
[1:49:41] no you are a China just like the woman
[1:49:45] that pray for the son who I mean visit
[1:49:48] the blind son your life doesn't end when
[1:49:50] they put this guy on the graveyard no
[1:49:53] his sistine element was lying somewhere
[1:49:55] in Arkansas but the woman herself was an
[1:49:59] eternity and Bram said in a message
[1:50:01] Christ is revealed in his own way that
[1:50:02] eternity is that when you go to heaven
[1:50:04] we're gonna find out heaven is not
[1:50:06] somewhere in the sky somewhere it's
[1:50:08] right here it's in you isn't a dimension
[1:50:12] which is faster than this dimension this
[1:50:14] eyes can see so far but as an eye of
[1:50:17] eternity that was can see beyond what
[1:50:20] you cannot see
[1:50:21] amen the blood now could not see with
[1:50:24] his physical eyes but there's an another
[1:50:26] eye there's a high of Revelation
[1:50:29] there's an IO vision there's an eye of
[1:50:31] Dreams there's an eye of a tournament a
[1:50:33] physician of cries and when it comes
[1:50:35] into existence no demon can do nothing
[1:50:37] to you you are as patina as Athena can
[1:50:41] be you are as Christ as Christ can be
[1:50:43] you are as God as God can be you have
[1:50:46] all the eternity in you and all eternity
[1:50:49] backing you what is our problem we are
[1:50:53] human miss of course we cry we mourn we
[1:50:55] fall and rise we go into problems and
[1:50:59] issues but don't look that it should be
[1:51:01] the Eurovision amen
[1:51:04] see that that issue is for God for the
[1:51:07] glory of God find the man of God
[1:51:09] concerning your issue find a man of God
[1:51:12] concerning your problem Lord why did you

[1:51:17] sick God want to glorify himself in you
[1:51:21] amen so he want you to speak you want us
[1:51:24] to get to a point where we can just like
[1:51:26] the creative voice can come into
[1:51:28] manifestation just by the thought
[1:51:30] because about was that we're going to
[1:51:31] travel I thought amen let me give a
[1:51:34] testimony I want to give testimony Wow
[1:51:36] I'm just about to close this was in San
[1:51:38] Antonio one time I was I was in the
[1:51:40] military did well Jack and I had a dream
[1:51:42] I used to pray back from Africa I pray
[1:51:45] in the night a lot
[1:51:46] I pray sometime go and hide in the same
[1:51:48] tree so I've known demonic manifestation
[1:51:50] is nothing that ever was nothing so one
[1:51:52] time I was asleep and I saw a demon a
[1:51:54] spread coming with a top speed coming to
[1:51:56] attack me
[1:51:58] normally it happens to me when sometime
[1:51:59] when I pray I've gone to pray and I come
[1:52:01] out to bed and I speaking loudly I'm
[1:52:03] going to kill you just like I'm speaking
[1:52:05] to you and I hope you description as I
[1:52:08] see time this is the Word of God you
[1:52:10] have no power over me I've seen a time
[1:52:13] that the devil this was in Africa the
[1:52:15] Spirit was coming to attack me you know
[1:52:17] your trials the law to make you to know
[1:52:18] who you are
[1:52:19] I was asleep on my bed and I saw another
[1:52:22] beam coming out of me saying to the
[1:52:24] devil that I cannot die you cannot kill
[1:52:26] me fighting the devil this time in San
[1:52:28] Antonio it wasn't a somebody coming out
[1:52:31] of me I saw this demon coming out and I
[1:52:33] saw a ball of fire rolling out of me
[1:52:36] with a top speed moving to the spirit I
[1:52:38] didn't wake up to pray I didn't do
[1:52:40] nothing
[1:52:41] the pillow fire
[1:52:42] to do his job and that is what is in you
[1:52:45] and I and if you get to know who we are
[1:52:48] the devil is not even part of the
[1:52:49] question that the devil is creating the
[1:52:59] contrast for us to bring the other
[1:53:00] contrast amen and a lot of God's given
[1:53:03] us the balance you know jet plane jet
[1:53:05] Lena's got two balances two wings to
[1:53:07] balance it the Lord has given us two
[1:53:09] silver trumpets the Good Samaritan give
[1:53:11] two coins to the in two balances you
[1:53:15] know the Lord allowed their law laughs
[1:53:17] is is balanced by law and grease amen
[1:53:21] love is eternities or love but now a law
[1:53:25] comes in we are born in sin by law when
[1:53:27] suppose all of us we're dead incident
[1:53:29] trespasses then the grace of God came in
[1:53:32] that yes they are sinners but I've died
[1:53:34] for them my blood covers them I'm taking
[1:53:37] the place of the essen and so he was
[1:53:39] crucified for his book for Greece but
[1:53:41] now Greece bring us back - what - laughs
[1:53:44] where we were before the foundation of
[1:53:46] the world before the world began you had
[1:53:49] a very love of God before the world
[1:53:51] began you are the heart of Jesus Christ
[1:53:53] before the world began you had a very
[1:53:55] motive and objective of Jesus Christ you
[1:53:58] are the one who is speaking for eternity
[1:54:00] right now just like the mother who
[1:54:03] prayed for who who revealed himself to
[1:54:05] death to the son to the son that go and
[1:54:08] see a man Cobra ham to pray for you God
[1:54:11] can do something for you with Christ in
[1:54:14] you would IV you moving an inch amen one
[1:54:18] time in San Antonio a brother and his
[1:54:20] wife from from Congo they're very good
[1:54:22] friends of mine and I but I didn't have
[1:54:25] insurance so he said his wife was very
[1:54:26] sick and I got replaced we are getting
[1:54:28] worse and worse they don't have money
[1:54:30] they don't have insurance so they were
[1:54:32] just praying that the Lord would do
[1:54:33] something for them and the wife was
[1:54:35] getting worse and worse and worse
[1:54:36] so she said one night a wife woke up he
[1:54:38] said honey I woke up and I saw but I
[1:54:41] could pray for me and I do understand
[1:54:43] Sabra cook was praying for you then the
[1:54:45] Lord has healed you believe it and that
[1:54:48] was it
[1:54:49] the Lord healed them just like that
[1:54:51] and I didn't physically go to the house
[1:54:53] to prefer them sometime I go to the
[1:54:55] woods to pray for brothers and sisters
[1:54:56] but I don't remember physically praying
[1:54:58] for them but a lot can use that Christ
[1:55:01] in you is not limited to this meat and
[1:55:03] flesh the pricing you can go to whatever
[1:55:06] can go to our overseas can go to
[1:55:09] wherever to manifest Jesus Christ and
[1:55:12] the more we get to know who we are the
[1:55:15] magis ascribe become I mean so plain
[1:55:17] common in our life no come on in a
[1:55:20] disrespectful way but it's so common in
[1:55:22] our myths because we are the sons and
[1:55:24] manifestation of God god bless you

[1:56:42] let's give the Lord and DePriest
[1:56:49] certainly appreciate brother quake who
[1:56:52] believed that's just a a continuation of
[1:56:56] the New Year's sermon we was talking
[1:57:00] about the love of God through the law of
[1:57:02] contrasts and you know sometimes we go
[1:57:06] through so many things in this life and
[1:57:08] we're just wondering why this why that
[1:57:09] but rather than action why why don't we
[1:57:12] just start thanking God for what he's
[1:57:15] getting ready to reveal through us it's
[1:57:18] the glory that shall be revealed in us
[1:57:21] right in order for that glory to be
[1:57:23] revealed in us then we got to go through
[1:57:25] something right amen not just go to
[1:57:28] something go through something see David
[1:57:32] didn't just go to the battle no he went
[1:57:35] through the battle come on somebody
[1:57:38] the the the three Hebrew boys and just
[1:57:42] go to the fire they went through the
[1:57:44] fire see and seeing as we go through
[1:57:47] things and God's glory is declared in us
[1:57:51] and when we thank God for that we thank
[1:57:53] God for that
[1:57:54] brother Quaker was just kind of sharing
[1:57:56] how you know different the testimonies
[1:57:59] there the lady being healed before you
[1:58:04] know they didn't have they didn't have
[1:58:05] the insurance that had that he never
[1:58:07] even showed up at the house but you know
[1:58:09] she says so on and I saw that he prayed
[1:58:12] for me and and the husband owe me this
[1:58:14] except that you know whether he come lay
[1:58:16] hands on you're not your heel and start
[1:58:19] walking in that right I take these three
[1:58:22] elements these three realms that God
[1:58:24] deals in we got to be able to try to we
[1:58:26] got to be able to catch him you know
[1:58:28] when he's moving you know a man of God
[1:58:32] had got what I what I've learned about
[1:58:34] God is that he has different strategies
[1:58:36] of doing things sometimes we won't go
[1:58:38] out to do it for us the same way he did
[1:58:40] it for somebody else you might want to
[1:58:41] do a different way for you alright some
[1:58:44] of y'all might get a check in the mail
[1:58:45] and that's how he gonna provide your
[1:58:48] needs other y'all he might give you a
[1:58:49] job
[1:58:53] huh he might give some extra hours but
[1:58:57] no matter how you'll need is still being
[1:58:59] provided is that right man some yah he
[1:59:03] might touch you and I mean lay hands on
[1:59:06] you in the thing going just like that
[1:59:07] others it might be a process of time but
[1:59:10] he's still the Hitler and some might
[1:59:13] sitting they chat not get touched at all
[1:59:15] and still get healed God got different
[1:59:18] strategies I just I just appreciate a
[1:59:25] man I appreciate that you know just
[1:59:28] thinking about you know he brought out
[1:59:30] the the mother that was a theophany
[1:59:32] that's boat back to the Sun and here
[1:59:35] this man was absolutely blind but he saw
[1:59:38] his mama in this in this vision he
[1:59:40] served mama mama came to me mama
[1:59:43] beginning to talk to me you know now let
[1:59:45] me let me inspect you can get this clear
[1:59:47] if your mama has already gone on to be
[1:59:50] with the Lord we not talk about you
[1:59:52] praying for mama to come to you that's
[1:59:55] not what he did the man was believing
[1:59:58] God that somehow he was gonna get his
[2:00:00] sight restored and and the way that God
[2:00:02] used it was to bring this man's mama to
[2:00:05] and no no they say you say mama got
[2:00:08] lygian so mama got legend like you got
[2:00:13] legend see that the man could have
[2:00:16] confidence he knew how his mama live
[2:00:19] before him right you say mama got legend
[2:00:23] the way that you got legend and because
[2:00:25] of that confidence and God doctor sent
[2:00:29] somebody to meant that he could have
[2:00:30] confidence and say if this person
[2:00:32] terminates and I'm gonna go do it
[2:00:33] I'm block design on no work
[2:00:36] I've lived 200 miles away from here but
[2:00:39] I heard to come to this city now hi he
[2:00:41] knew the Prophet was gonna be there and
[2:00:45] here she shows up and say look look I
[2:00:47] want you to go down that acts for the
[2:00:48] man Brannan he prays for the sicken and
[2:00:51] not just not just go get pray for but
[2:00:54] you will you will if you do this you
[2:00:59] will come on somebody you will receive
[2:01:04] your sight that fella got down then all
[2:01:08] you can said Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy
[2:01:13] Mercy Mercy i'ma tell you something now
[2:01:15] if you want to get God's attention
[2:01:16] sometime you got to do something a
[2:01:18] little different
[2:01:18] I just come just to be a part of the
[2:01:21] meeting I can't even see what's
[2:01:22] happening in the meeting but hard sick
[2:01:25] March it March it sound a little bit
[2:01:31] like blind bartimaeus if you go back and
[2:01:33] read his story
[2:01:34] blind Bartimaeus when he begin to cry
[2:01:36] out that I mean he got he cried out so
[2:01:39] hard that the people start threatening
[2:01:41] to shut him down you know he must have
[2:01:44] been interrupting some stuff but he see
[2:01:47] it was it was it was blind bartimaeus
[2:01:49] did not know but that was the last time
[2:01:51] Jesus was going to go that way and if he
[2:01:55] didn't get in touch with him on that day
[2:01:57] he would have stayed blind the rest of
[2:01:58] his life
[2:02:00] I believe the Lord this morning has
[2:02:02] brought mercy to somebody
[2:02:04] I believe the Lord has brought mercy to
[2:02:07] somebody
[2:02:09] I I wanted to when we know brother for
[2:02:15] the Solomon told us that he is going to
[2:02:18] be going into surgery a man on this week
[2:02:22] and what I like to do before anybody
[2:02:25] goes into surgery is we like to have
[2:02:28] prayer and men over them and oftentimes
[2:02:31] the way that I want to do that is this
[2:02:33] morning we're gonna pray for further
[2:02:35] Solomon but if there's anybody else in
[2:02:38] here that's praying for some type of
[2:02:40] surgery and now we know God can't heal
[2:02:43] we don't we don't doubt then we don't
[2:02:45] doubt that there's sometimes God will
[2:02:47] prevent you from going to surgery and
[2:02:49] there's other times God will allow you
[2:02:51] to go to surgery and I'm gonna tell you
[2:02:53] he's the same God no matter which way it
[2:02:55] goes he's the same God and so but what I
[2:02:59] like to do but you know there there's
[2:03:00] been many reports of doctors leaving
[2:03:02] little things inside people's bodies and
[2:03:04] that's creating problems for them that
[2:03:06] they they never even imagined right it
[2:03:08] you know it takes faith to submit
[2:03:10] yourself to the doctor it takes faith
[2:03:14] right so you know but but before we
[2:03:17] before anybody goes on a surgery I love
[2:03:19] to pray over them a man and just just
[2:03:22] acts God just direct the doctors and the
[2:03:24] nurses and everybody because those
[2:03:25] people have problems just like you have
[2:03:27] problems
[2:03:28] they do sometimes they deal with greater
[2:03:31] issues than what to deal with so we need
[2:03:33] they minds to be centered on the patient
[2:03:36] no mistakes here right so we like to
[2:03:40] pray and if there's anybody else here
[2:03:41] that I also might be going through
[2:03:44] Amen a little surgery you want some
[2:03:45] prayer a man before the surgery we want
[2:03:48] to invite you to come amen at this time
[2:03:50] and and if you if you're not going
[2:03:53] through surgery but you got something
[2:03:54] that you want through late lord I just I
[2:03:56] just want to touch from if you want
[2:03:57] healing in your body we want to invite
[2:03:59] you to come I believe God is offering
[2:04:02] mercy to somebody
[2:04:06] but a quick whoever as you've come from
[2:04:09] underneath your loin ting and man I want
[2:04:12] you just to anoint the people of God as
[2:04:14] they would come man for prayer brother
[2:04:17] Solomon we'll start with you and there's
[2:04:20] anybody that wants to get in a man to
[2:04:22] this today we want to invite you to come

[2:22:02] done it is done
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:09] there's some things the Lord
[2:22:12] does and they're very personal and
[2:22:16] certainly we keep that between him and
[2:22:19] us there's other things that the Lord
[2:22:23] does he wants you to testify before it
[2:22:30] even happens sometimes you learn to just
[2:22:33] give God praise before it happens you
[2:22:36] don't have to wait till things happen to
[2:22:38] give them praise but you praise only for
[2:22:40] happens I believe that of Abraham called
[2:22:44] things that be not as though they were
[2:22:47] the Bible says he was strong in praise
[2:22:51] giving glory to God and that's what we
[2:22:55] have to learn the B is just strong in
[2:22:56] our praise giving glory to God right
[2:22:59] through the midst of whatever it is that
[2:23:01] we're going through
[2:23:02] Amen but I believe today some things
[2:23:04] were settled in this place I think it's
[2:23:07] done in Jesus name we serve a god a man
[2:23:15] that has already showed us that before
[2:23:18] the doctor's hand touches a body the
[2:23:21] person can be made whole we know we
[2:23:24] serve a God like that and a man even
[2:23:27] just do that in brother branham's day
[2:23:29] but he did it in our day a man's sister
[2:23:32] sister Tonya was scheduled to have a
[2:23:33] procedure done just a couple years ago
[2:23:36] amen but before the doctors hand touched
[2:23:38] the body before the procedure was Amen
[2:23:41] time God had already showed up it all
[2:23:46] happened through a simple word of Prayer
[2:23:49] hello somebody it may seem simple but
[2:23:52] it's one of the greatest weapons we have
[2:23:54] is to pray
[2:23:57] the prayer faith will save the sick and
[2:23:59] the Lord will resume oh I believe with
[2:24:03] all my heart
[2:24:04] come on let's stand and sing this song

[2:26:37] the same blood that was shed for your
[2:26:41] salvation is the same blood that was
[2:26:42] shed for your healing and what you go
[2:26:47] back and you read John 5 and there's a
[2:26:49] man at the Pool of Bethesda that was
[2:26:52] made whole of a condition that he had
[2:26:54] for 38 years and he didn't even realize
[2:26:58] who it was that had touched him and as
[2:27:01] he was carrying his cot around a man
[2:27:04] through the city and the Jews begin to
[2:27:06] ask them you know what's going on here
[2:27:08] you've been in that condition for so
[2:27:09] many years and and now you've been
[2:27:11] touched and you carrying a cart well who
[2:27:12] did he say I don't even know who did it
[2:27:13] so as he went back into of the the the
[2:27:17] area where Jesus was Jesus walked up to
[2:27:20] him and it says do you know it says the
[2:27:26] Bible said Jesus found them and the
[2:27:28] temple and said unto Him behold thou art
[2:27:29] made whole
[2:27:30] so you're made whole you're not in that
[2:27:32] condition anymore you you've been healed
[2:27:34] right but at any same sin no more right
[2:27:39] left the worst thing come unto thee and
[2:27:41] and what we want to tell you is that you
[2:27:43] don't have to be a Christian to get a
[2:27:46] healing but if you want to keep your
[2:27:49] healing you're gonna need to become a
[2:27:52] Christian
[2:27:53] amen so whatever the Lord has done for
[2:27:55] you I want you to give them praise for
[2:27:57] that but if he's been that good to you
[2:27:59] through the shedding of his blood to
[2:28:01] bring healing to you then he wants to be
[2:28:03] better to you through the saving of your
[2:28:05] song the greatest healing that a man or
[2:28:09] woman could ever experience is the
[2:28:11] healing of the song
[2:28:15] I want to tell you go and sin no more
[2:28:20] lest a worse thing come unto thee this
[2:28:25] pray father we thank you for what you
[2:28:31] have done in this place today thank you
