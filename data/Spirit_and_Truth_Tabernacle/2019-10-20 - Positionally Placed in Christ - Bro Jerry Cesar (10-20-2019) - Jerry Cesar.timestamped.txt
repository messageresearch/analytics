[51:13] song go to Solomon as he was just
[51:19] singing that we can be seated just for a
[51:21] moment as he was just singing that it
[51:23] just some little thought went through my
[51:27] head I remember being a young man and I
[51:33] was you know going to church but I was
[51:36] going through a season in my life where
[51:37] I was thinking about just leaving just
[51:40] stopping the church thing and you know
[51:42] just you know going out in the world and
[51:44] just do whatever I wanted to do and I
[51:46] was going through that that process of
[51:49] thinking through that I I was one night
[51:52] picking up brother smiley they're taking
[51:55] the church and and this night when I
[51:57] took a route that I hadn't taken ever
[52:00] really taken to go to church I thought
[52:02] it was a shortcut and we both got
[52:05] t-boned by a drunk driver and hit the
[52:09] car and brother smiley side of the car
[52:11] and turned us over and we start going
[52:13] down the street on the top of the the
[52:15] hood and you know and it was you know a
[52:19] situation where probably neither one of
[52:22] us should have made it out but by God's
[52:25] grace we both walked out of that
[52:28] situation I think I had the car that I
[52:31] just bought a had it for six days six
[52:34] days and it was you know brand new out
[52:37] off the lot and and they hadn't even
[52:39] approved my loan yet they just let me
[52:41] drive in it and when I told him that I
[52:43] was an accident my lawn got to prove
[52:45] real quick
[52:47] and you know it but it was just a thing
[52:51] where I realized that you need God in
[52:56] your life at all times and here I was
[52:59] thinking that you know that I was gonna
[53:02] do something else and I'll just let me
[53:03] know you can't walk without me you you
[53:05] can't talk with that live can't live
[53:07] with me right you you you step back from
[53:10] underneath this blood you don't know
[53:11] what's gonna happen to you right now all
[53:14] it was was a thought for me I'm just
[53:15] thinking about not serving God God let
[53:18] me see real quick

[1:04:06] oh geez
[1:04:09] Thank You lawyer
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:18] it is a grand privilege for me to be
[1:04:21] this this morning with you all I believe
[1:04:26] there's no better place to be and
[1:04:31] there's no better way to be in any place
[1:04:34] but in the name of the Jesus Christ it's
[1:04:37] always a privilege to be before the
[1:04:39] Bride of Christ and brother Jackie he as
[1:04:44] he mentioned to you guys earlier he kind
[1:04:46] of called out to me and and mentioned
[1:04:49] that this is what he had in his heart
[1:04:51] and you know God always works on both
[1:04:54] ends because God had already placed
[1:04:56] something in my heart and I you know God
[1:04:59] he when he moves you have to be
[1:05:02] sensitive to his move and I didn't know
[1:05:05] when he would have me to speak but there
[1:05:09] was a time that was the hardest it was
[1:05:11] this time because I had other things
[1:05:12] going on and and but I had to be
[1:05:15] obedient and that's exactly what I said
[1:05:18] to brother Jack so I'm trusting this
[1:05:20] morning that God would meet every hearts
[1:05:22] needs and he would speak to every heart
[1:05:25] so to not take any time we're gonna turn
[1:05:28] in to the book of Ephesians
[1:05:38] the Fijians first chapter we're going to
[1:05:47] start at a third verse for it reads
[1:05:53] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:05:57] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:06:00] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:06:02] places in Christ according as he hath
[1:06:05] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:06:08] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:06:12] without blame before him in love having
[1:06:16] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:06:19] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:06:20] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:06:23] will to the praise of the glory of His
[1:06:26] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:06:28] in the beloved and whom we have
[1:06:31] redemption through the blood of the
[1:06:33] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:35] riches of His grace wherein he has
[1:06:38] abounded toward us all wisdom and
[1:06:40] prudence having made known unto us the
[1:06:44] mystery of his will according to the
[1:06:46] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:06:49] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:06:52] fullness of times he might gather
[1:06:54] together in one all things in Christ
[1:06:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:07:00] on earth even in him and whom also we
[1:07:05] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:07:08] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:07:10] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:07:14] counsel of his will a man you may be
[1:07:17] seated
[1:07:30] may God as a blessing to his reading as
[1:07:33] a subject this morning I want to focus
[1:07:36] on holy and without blame before him and
[1:07:40] love and as a title I want to use
[1:07:45] positionally placed in Christ you see I
[1:07:50] want to start by saying something the
[1:07:52] Prophet said and the message of the
[1:07:56] position of a believer in Christ the
[1:07:59] Prophet says how many Christians are
[1:08:02] here raise up your hands and I just want
[1:08:06] to actually guys the same question all
[1:08:10] the believers raise up your hands
[1:08:13] he says everywhere that's wonderful he
[1:08:16] said I suppose that's wonderful 100
[1:08:18] percent Lux says now if you're a
[1:08:22] believer he said I believe I know the
[1:08:26] greatest curse that's on the church
[1:08:28] today it's not knowing what they are at
[1:08:34] church this morning I want to say that
[1:08:37] I'm not speaking to the world but I'm
[1:08:39] speaking to believers you see this is
[1:08:41] what I call Eagles food because the
[1:08:45] church world this is a little too hard
[1:08:48] for them to chew on further down 24th
[1:08:53] paragraph it says says now the Epistle
[1:08:56] the letter to the Ephesians was written
[1:08:57] to believers not the outside world but
[1:09:00] to believers it says now try hard
[1:09:03] Christians to understand that this day
[1:09:06] the message has been placing the
[1:09:09] believer and positionally place and
[1:09:15] book of Ephesians to focus and says you
[1:09:19] have been according that he hath chosen
[1:09:21] us in him before before what you were
[1:09:25] not only chosen of him but you were
[1:09:28] chosen in him and you were chosen in him
[1:09:32] before hope to be holy
[1:09:35] but without blame before him in love
[1:09:38] many are called Church but few are
[1:09:41] chosen
[1:09:42] and and you are the chosen this morning
[1:09:45] now he that chose you chose you in him
[1:09:49] one were you chosen you were chosen
[1:09:51] before the foundation of this world
[1:09:55] before the world was even created you
[1:09:58] were in existence and the reason I can
[1:10:01] say you had to be in existence Church is
[1:10:04] because there had to be a manifestation
[1:10:06] there had to be a manifestation of sons
[1:10:08] and daughters of God right there had to
[1:10:10] be a manifestation of deliverance there
[1:10:13] had to be a manifestation of healing
[1:10:15] there had to be a manifestation of
[1:10:16] victory there had to be a manifestation
[1:10:19] of deliverance you see leather coat I
[1:10:26] wish to share with you and
[1:10:31] the Prophet said this is in wisdom
[1:10:34] versus faith the Prophet says and then
[1:10:39] if you are a born again child of God you
[1:10:44] are and got the Holy Spirit in you you
[1:10:48] are the manifestation of God's spoken
[1:10:51] word before it was a word now I want you
[1:10:56] to catch that church you are the
[1:10:58] manifestation of God
[1:11:00] spoken word before it was word and what
[1:11:08] and uh Matthew in Matthew 24 chapter
[1:11:13] verse 35 it says it's important that we
[1:11:17] know and recognize who we are
[1:11:19] it says heaven and earth shall pass I'm
[1:11:24] just gonna turn here real quick heaven
[1:11:30] and earth shall pass but my words shall
[1:11:32] not pass and and if I could tell you
[1:11:36] church have been in earth shall pass but
[1:11:40] the manifestation of God's words shall
[1:11:43] not pass because you are the
[1:11:45] manifestation of God before he even was
[1:11:48] worried
[1:11:48] you see prophet goes on to say it had to
[1:11:52] be a thought before it could be a word a
[1:11:54] word is a spoken thought and the
[1:11:58] thoughts was in God and then we were in
[1:12:01] God in eternity and we were spoken into
[1:12:06] existence by the word so see before you
[1:12:09] came to existence
[1:12:10] you were already manifested before there
[1:12:14] was a creation you were already
[1:12:15] manifested you were manifested in the
[1:12:18] mind of God as sons and daughters of God
[1:12:24] now I believe that we're living in a
[1:12:29] world today that lacks holiness we're
[1:12:32] living in a world that lacks godliness
[1:12:34] righteousness and if there's any
[1:12:36] holiness today it's because it's a bride
[1:12:39] still on the earth if that righteousness
[1:12:41] today is because there's a bride still
[1:12:43] on the earth now this world has gone
[1:12:46] through so many changes and that's just
[1:12:49] what it keeps stalling looking towards a
[1:12:50] constant change right now I don't say
[1:12:54] they call it change but they say they
[1:12:57] call it an upgrade
[1:12:58] there's always an upgrade to something
[1:13:00] right and this happens every so often I
[1:13:03] remember one day when they came out with
[1:13:05] the first iPhone I want to say it was
[1:13:08] some 10 to 12 years ago and we're
[1:13:10] already on iPhone 11 that that's to show
[1:13:13] you that every year there's an upgrade
[1:13:15] right so that means the world can never
[1:13:18] find a contentment the world is always
[1:13:21] looking for something new now I say that
[1:13:26] church because thanks me to God that
[1:13:29] even before the world began there was
[1:13:31] born sons and daughters of God that was
[1:13:33] already in an upgraded form right now
[1:13:37] you see the pinnacle upon all upgrades
[1:13:40] is right here I'm looking at the upgrade
[1:13:41] right here right now is that right
[1:13:44] church for we should be holy and without
[1:13:47] blame before him and love now where else
[1:13:52] can we ever get this upgrade in Christ
[1:13:54] nowhere but in Christ you see when
[1:13:58] you're in him your renewed daily your
[1:14:01] faith is renewed daily your virtue is
[1:14:04] renewed daily your temperance is renewed
[1:14:07] daily
[1:14:08] your knowledge is renewed daily your
[1:14:11] your brotherly kindness is renewed daily
[1:14:13] your patience is renewed daily you see
[1:14:16] your love is renewed daily and I can
[1:14:20] keep going on now just start to your
[1:14:22] neighbor and says I'm renewed daily now
[1:14:27] there's no upgrades for believers right
[1:14:30] that is spiritually speaking because you
[1:14:34] die daily so you can live today right if
[1:14:40] you are manifested before creation
[1:14:43] what is there to upgrade to Paul says
[1:14:49] you must die daily and there's a quote I
[1:14:53] came across earlier this week and as
[1:14:58] brother Troy likes to say it I just had
[1:15:00] to have to stay on on this side of the
[1:15:03] bone a little bit you know this isn't a
[1:15:07] message desperations and I had a chance
[1:15:09] to send it out to a few believers and
[1:15:12] says desperations sign of his coming
[1:15:16] should throw every member of Christ and
[1:15:19] to desperation now about our souls about
[1:15:23] our welfare hereafter and I could just
[1:15:26] add to that our treasures are not here
[1:15:29] on earth but in heaven see we're not
[1:15:32] building an earthly tabernacle but a
[1:15:34] heavenly tabernacle one that will not be
[1:15:37] dissolved profit goes on to say what are
[1:15:41] we going to amount to we've regained the
[1:15:43] whole world what are we what are we
[1:15:45] living for what do we work for what are
[1:15:49] you eating for what are you struggling
[1:15:51] for it
[1:15:52] to live what are you living for to die
[1:15:55] and you're not fit to live until you're
[1:15:59] fit to die now I just want that a
[1:16:03] sinking church you are not fit to live
[1:16:05] until you are first fit to die and
[1:16:08] church it's going to take a dying
[1:16:11] condition for the church to be raptured
[1:16:14] out of here you see being completely
[1:16:16] dead in this corrupted and mortal body
[1:16:19] and first Corinthians chapter 15 verse
[1:16:22] 53 it says for this corruptible must put
[1:16:27] on incorruption and this mortal must put
[1:16:30] on immortality so when this corruptible
[1:16:33] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:16:35] mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:16:37] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:16:40] that it is written death is swallowed up
[1:16:43] in victory now that just makes me
[1:16:46] rejoice when I came across this you see
[1:16:49] death is swallowed up in victory you see
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:54] that makes me rejoice Church because we
[1:16:57] go through so much daily but only to be
[1:17:00] tested and to be proven right now
[1:17:04] whatever defeat is among us this morning
[1:17:06] let it be swallowed up in victory any
[1:17:09] sickness here this morning let it be
[1:17:12] swallowed up in healing any defeat any
[1:17:15] afflictions any any diseases let it be
[1:17:18] swallowed up in Christ verse 7 and whom
[1:17:23] we have verse 7 in Ephesians first
[1:17:26] chapter and whom we have redemption
[1:17:28] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:17:32] sins according to the riches of His
[1:17:34] grace see Church you're swallowed up in
[1:17:37] victory because he's paid a price he's
[1:17:41] paid a price that's without blame or
[1:17:44] blemish quote here
[1:17:48] Mesa's the position of a believer
[1:17:51] prophet says the whole room here is full
[1:17:54] of the power of God even enough to make
[1:17:58] this boy sitting here in a wheelchair
[1:18:00] walk make this woman walk make this lady
[1:18:04] in the stretcher of walk make all these
[1:18:07] people along here walk make the blind
[1:18:10] seat but the first thing you have to do
[1:18:13] is get that Holy Spirit flowing in the
[1:18:16] right category and you see I realized
[1:18:21] that the power of God is always
[1:18:23] circulating the believer but God is
[1:18:27] always moving but you must be sensitive
[1:18:30] enough to recognize his power sensitive
[1:18:34] enough to recognize his move you see
[1:18:36] brother Branham shared with us going
[1:18:39] beyond the sound barrier and whatever
[1:18:43] you in need of church there's always a
[1:18:46] barrier the sound barrier is between
[1:18:48] your faith and your unbelief you see in
[1:18:52] order to get what you're in what your
[1:18:55] need for in God you have to put down the
[1:18:58] barriers you have to recognize that the
[1:19:02] Holy Spirit is flowing and once you can
[1:19:06] get the Holy Spirit flowing in the right
[1:19:07] category right you get in Christ you
[1:19:11] just let it flow but you have to get
[1:19:15] into Christ you have to get in Christ
[1:19:17] and Christ has to be on the inside
[1:19:19] you'll never truly recognize God's power
[1:19:22] without Christ being on the inside how
[1:19:25] do you get in Christ prophet goes on to
[1:19:28] say now there's so many different ways
[1:19:31] they claim to Christ Jesus
[1:19:32] they said you join the church some save
[1:19:35] you believe and some does one thing or
[1:19:37] another some take it by baptism some
[1:19:40] take it by fellowship but first
[1:19:42] Corinthians twelve says by one spirit or
[1:19:45] we are all baptized into one body which
[1:19:49] is the body of Christ the body of
[1:19:52] believers you see it by what not by
[1:19:55] shaking hands not by one mode of baptism
[1:19:57] not by one feeling but by one spirit
[1:20:00] now one spirit all baptized
[1:20:03] to one body so I want to say you have to
[1:20:07] apply your spiritual token and your
[1:20:09] spiritual token is Christ once you have
[1:20:12] applied your spiritual token then you're
[1:20:14] fit for the journey
[1:20:16] now prophet goes on to say the token
[1:20:20] what's the token Church the token is
[1:20:22] Christ Christ is the fullness of this
[1:20:25] word and the bride is the fullness of
[1:20:29] Christ you see all that was in Christ
[1:20:34] Christ ported into the church because
[1:20:37] all that was in God God pouring into
[1:20:38] Christ and they're supposed to be
[1:20:43] changes when you apply the token me
[1:20:45] they're supposed to be changes when you
[1:20:48] accept Christ in your life now we're not
[1:20:52] talking about an emotional change we're
[1:20:54] not talking about a mental change but
[1:20:56] we're talking about a nature change our
[1:20:59] nature change that bears witness of the
[1:21:02] nature of the holy spirit now your
[1:21:06] nature has to become a witness and in a
[1:21:09] manifestation of the nature of the holy
[1:21:11] spirit you see when you come to the
[1:21:14] place when you really recognize who you
[1:21:16] are your nature of nature change there
[1:21:20] is no longer a strange thing to you
[1:21:22] right when things begin to when your
[1:21:25] desires begin to change when the things
[1:21:27] you used to do don't don't no longer
[1:21:29] interest you anymore that's not a
[1:21:31] strange thing to you right a matter of
[1:21:34] fact the Prophet says in the message
[1:21:35] you're not you're not even supposed to
[1:21:37] notice it right it just falls away right
[1:21:40] it's supposed to leave you because light
[1:21:43] and darkness cannot dwell in the same
[1:21:45] place light and darkness cannot do it in
[1:21:48] the same atmosphere now when we know who
[1:21:52] we were then we'll know who we are
[1:22:00] the Prophet says what were you and what
[1:22:05] are you very there is how you know what
[1:22:10] was you before the token was applied
[1:22:12] what are you after it's applied
[1:22:16] what was your desires before and what is
[1:22:20] your desires after you see that's
[1:22:23] supposed to produce change they're
[1:22:26] supposed to produce a life that
[1:22:28] identifies with Christ he says then you
[1:22:33] know whether the token is applied or not
[1:22:36] and these other things just
[1:22:37] automatically go with that it isn't like
[1:22:40] talking about it saying tongues is the
[1:22:42] evidence now I'll bet I'll buy a pair of
[1:22:45] shoes the tongue is at the shoe it just
[1:22:47] crumbs with the shell you see it just
[1:22:50] comes with the shooter right your your
[1:22:53] your your blessing just cards with the
[1:22:55] Holy Spirit right when you receive the
[1:22:57] Holy Spirit you're supposed to be
[1:22:59] blessed you're supposed to be in victory
[1:23:01] you're supposed to be healed now you
[1:23:07] receive these things by faith because
[1:23:10] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:23:12] God now there's a difference between
[1:23:15] hope and faith faith is being sure of
[1:23:20] what you're hoping for now
[1:23:23] prophet says faith does the job right
[1:23:27] now not later not tomorrow not next week
[1:23:32] but right now faith is the substance of
[1:23:36] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:23:38] not seen you faith is the product now we
[1:23:43] have lots of hope the Prophet says but
[1:23:46] not much faith so we want to change from
[1:23:49] hope today to positive faith and there's
[1:23:52] only one way we can get a positive faith
[1:23:54] that's by positive thinking of positive
[1:23:57] things
[1:24:00] when we can put on the form of God our
[1:24:03] faith renews now we don't live by some
[1:24:09] experience we had some time ago but our
[1:24:12] experience also is supposed to renew
[1:24:14] because when we apply to faith that is
[1:24:18] supposed to believe the Prophet says the
[1:24:22] faith that was once delivered the Saints
[1:24:26] that faith is the same faith we need
[1:24:29] today it's a dying faith a faith that
[1:24:33] sees only by Christ now prophet says
[1:24:39] according that he had chosen him and us
[1:24:43] or him choosing us in him who done the
[1:24:47] choosing God did you didn't I didn't God
[1:24:52] did you haven't chose me but I have
[1:24:55] chose you and church you didn't come
[1:24:58] here on your own but you are here this
[1:25:00] morning because God chose you
[1:25:02] God did just call you but God chose you
[1:25:04] because those he chose he justified
[1:25:08] those he justified he sanctified now
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:17] he says that uh he chose you on Christ
[1:25:23] before the foundation of the world was
[1:25:26] ever laid then if God knew that what are
[1:25:29] you scared about
[1:25:30] he said if God loo you way back before
[1:25:33] the foundation of the world to choose
[1:25:35] you in Christ what are you afraid about
[1:25:39] he says that's without blame without
[1:25:42] blemish
[1:25:43] now one spot on the church at all and
[1:25:45] this is where I want to focus on that we
[1:25:48] are wholly chosen to be holy and without
[1:25:51] blame before him in love he says now how
[1:25:55] are we ever going to get that way how
[1:25:58] are we ever going to get holy without
[1:26:00] blaming Christ he says we can't do it
[1:26:04] you're human and you're subject to all
[1:26:07] kinds of mistakes so that's one of the
[1:26:11] things the devil likes to come with us
[1:26:13] at when we make a mistake he makes us
[1:26:16] feel like we have lost our sonship well
[1:26:18] we have lost our identity but you see by
[1:26:22] revelation I believe in Romans 8 19th
[1:26:25] verse it says for the creature grown it
[1:26:28] after the manifestations of the Son of
[1:26:30] God and I'm gonna still brother Jack
[1:26:33] what he said once when time is is the
[1:26:37] matter the creature growing it for the
[1:26:39] revelation of the sons and daughters of
[1:26:42] God you see when you have a revelation
[1:26:45] of who you are it doesn't matter what
[1:26:47] mistake you've made
[1:26:48] but it's underneath the redemptive blood
[1:26:51] of Jesus Christ right you are presented
[1:26:54] with Christ holy and without blame let
[1:26:58] us turn to Hebrews the tenth chapter
[1:27:09] Hebrews chapter 10 referred to first
[1:27:12] verse it says for the law having a
[1:27:19] shadow of good things to come and not
[1:27:22] the very image of the things can never
[1:27:25] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:27:28] year by year continually make the comers
[1:27:30] thereunto perfect prophet says here just
[1:27:36] to contrast this quote it says the
[1:27:39] subject is perfection now how can mortal
[1:27:43] men ever become perfected and yet God
[1:27:47] said in his word that he chose us to be
[1:27:50] holy and perfected before the foundation
[1:27:53] of the world how are you going to do
[1:27:55] that jesus says be ye therefore perfect
[1:27:58] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:28:02] now I've got before the world ordained
[1:28:06] that we should be perfect without blame
[1:28:10] in the sight of God we are struggling
[1:28:13] murmuring prophet says and don't think
[1:28:17] God seeing all these God did not see all
[1:28:20] these things and he foreknew it and
[1:28:23] predestinated it ordained us to be so
[1:28:27] elected us before the world was ever
[1:28:29] formed now here's how he did it and
[1:28:34] Hebrews chapter 9 a 24th verse
[1:28:40] Hebrews chapter 9 24 praise the Lord
[1:28:55] praise the Lord the 24th verse it reads
[1:29:00] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[1:29:04] places made with hands which are the
[1:29:06] figures of the true but into heaven
[1:29:09] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:29:13] God for us and I'm gonna say make it
[1:29:18] personal he entered into the presence of
[1:29:21] God for you for me right now
[1:29:27] it goes on to say now yet that should
[1:29:30] that he should offer himself often as
[1:29:33] the high priest and turth and to the
[1:29:36] holy place every year with blood of
[1:29:38] others for then must he often have
[1:29:42] suffered since the foundation of the
[1:29:44] world but now once in the end of the
[1:29:47] world have he appeared to put away sin
[1:29:49] by the sacrifice of himself and it was
[1:29:55] appointed unto me unto man once to die
[1:29:58] but after this the judgment
[1:30:01] so Christ was once offered to bear the
[1:30:04] sins of many and unto them that look for
[1:30:08] him shall he appear the second time
[1:30:09] without sin unto salvation you see only
[1:30:14] once that he have to die and only once
[1:30:17] that he have to appear before God and
[1:30:21] once we accept him our mistakes all that
[1:30:26] we are our lives our past is subject to
[1:30:30] his perfection the reason we could be
[1:30:32] perfect and holy is because he is
[1:30:34] perfect and holy
[1:30:36] now the Prophet says paragraph 47 and
[1:30:44] position of a believer in Christ under
[1:30:48] the law under the shadow they entered in
[1:30:50] under the shedding of the blood of goats
[1:30:52] and bulls which we went through which
[1:30:56] could not take away sins it was the life
[1:30:59] of an animal how could the life of this
[1:31:02] hunk of the life and spirit of a dead
[1:31:04] animal coming out of the blood the cell
[1:31:07] of life breaking forth the blood that
[1:31:09] was shed I've ever ever that life
[1:31:12] returning back into an animal or to a
[1:31:15] man the life of a lamb or heifer or a
[1:31:18] goat or an animal that's been sacrificed
[1:31:21] after the blood has been broken for our
[1:31:24] sins that's why it never returns back
[1:31:27] and having anything to do with a human
[1:31:29] being it cannot but God before the
[1:31:34] foundation of the world for ordained
[1:31:36] that Jesus would come to perfect the
[1:31:39] perfect Lamb of God and to a perfect
[1:31:42] cell that God Himself created to bring
[1:31:45] blood into the world to offer that the
[1:31:47] blood that housed his life and through
[1:31:49] the tearing down of this house a blood
[1:31:51] that has the spirit that was in that
[1:31:54] blood cell which was not none other than
[1:31:58] the Holy Ghost himself after that
[1:32:00] offering of that man can come back and
[1:32:04] perfect and perfect the believer he
[1:32:06] brought eternal Redemption so you see in
[1:32:11] the Old Testament when they would go
[1:32:15] before the priest and bring forth their
[1:32:18] sacrifice they looked at their sacrifice
[1:32:21] they never looked at them as an
[1:32:23] individual but it was a sacrifice that
[1:32:25] was magnified and today we don't lean we
[1:32:31] don't depend on the the blood of goats
[1:32:33] but the blood of Christ right because as
[1:32:38] brother Branham says the life of the
[1:32:41] animal could not end
[1:32:42] sir cannot come back the spirit of the
[1:32:44] animal that is cannot come back to that
[1:32:48] to that believer to that person that
[1:32:50] offered the sacrifice but now the Christ
[1:32:54] being the sacrifice himself the spirit
[1:32:57] that was in him that resurrected him has
[1:33:01] returned to the believer let us turn to
[1:33:05] Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 Romans
[1:33:18] chapter 8 says
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] praise the Lord I'm just looking for the
[1:33:35] verse I didn't have it written down
[1:33:41] praise the Lord praise the Lord verse 11
[1:33:46] it says but if the spirit of him that
[1:33:49] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:33:52] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:33:55] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:33:58] bodies by his sins by his Spirit that
[1:34:01] dwelleth in you so that spirit now can
[1:34:05] come back to the believer to quicken
[1:34:08] your mortal bodies so that you can live
[1:34:11] a life of purity live a life of holiness
[1:34:13] live a life of godliness profit goes on
[1:34:19] to say the Holy Spirit who - believer
[1:34:24] through the blood cleansing of the soul
[1:34:26] into the fellowship into the spirit life
[1:34:28] inside with Christ shut out the world in
[1:34:32] very nature of God is in you still
[1:34:36] subject to mistakes but God can't see it
[1:34:41] because it's covered by the blood you
[1:34:44] see you still subject to mistakes but
[1:34:47] God cannot see because you are covered
[1:34:51] by the blood I want you to catch that
[1:34:54] church because when you recognize that
[1:34:57] the devil will flee in the midst of your
[1:34:59] trials the devil will flee you give him
[1:35:03] not that not just the word but the
[1:35:05] revelation of the word right the reason
[1:35:09] why Christ was able to defeat Satan is
[1:35:11] because he had a revelation of the word
[1:35:13] you see say who's just doing good study
[1:35:16] this morning saying went to him tempted
[1:35:18] him say it is written but Christ said it
[1:35:22] is also read you see now it was a matter
[1:35:25] of who had the greater revelation
[1:35:27] whether the workers you know the word is
[1:35:31] written all right we can have this
[1:35:32] discussion back and forth but what is
[1:35:35] your revelation of the word you see it
[1:35:37] is also written that's what he said and
[1:35:40] when we can understand our place our
[1:35:42] position in Christ we can say it is also
[1:35:45] really right though I am subject to
[1:35:48] mistakes but I am underneath the blood
[1:35:50] of Christ praise the Lord praise the
[1:35:55] Lord
[1:35:57] now the Prophet goes are on the same but
[1:36:03] how the greater he said I hope you get
[1:36:06] it he said that God Himself come down in
[1:36:09] the form of a lamb he says watch now
[1:36:12] look you don't have to look at the land
[1:36:15] don't look at yourself
[1:36:17] God don't look at you he looks at the
[1:36:19] land he looks at Christ and there was no
[1:36:22] fault in him and God accepted the
[1:36:25] offering you put your hand upon the lamb
[1:36:27] Christ Jesus confess your sins and as
[1:36:30] being a sinner and the lamb has died for
[1:36:33] you the spirit that comes out of the
[1:36:35] lamb comes back to the believer amen and
[1:36:39] you stand perfected because the one who
[1:36:42] died the innocent one the powerful one
[1:36:44] the overcoming one the accepted one and
[1:36:47] his own person returning the form of the
[1:36:50] Holy Ghost and brings the believer to
[1:36:53] rest it brings the believer to rest
[1:36:58] church we are swallowed up in victory
[1:37:02] we are swallowed up in Christ all that
[1:37:06] is in Christ is in us now see Romans
[1:37:10] eight the first verse says there is
[1:37:12] therefore now no condemnation to them
