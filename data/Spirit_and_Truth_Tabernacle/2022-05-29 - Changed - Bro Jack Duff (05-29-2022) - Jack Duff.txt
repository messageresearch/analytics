looking forward to it so just please keep those things in mind amen as we approach that turn with me to the book of acts a man chapter 19 and i think i want to start i'm sorry chapter nine acts chapter nine uh and we're starting at verse 19. let me just make sure i got this right yes okay verse verse 19 here says um and when he received meat he was strengthened then we saw certain days with the disciples which were at damascus it says in straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on the name on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests amen the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word we'll just have a brief word of prayer amen and we want to take our title today changed amen changed father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to come lord we are asking that you would meet us here or the only way that you can take control over every thought that is presented take control over every thought that is received and we actually god that you would just get the glory and the honor out of this service everyone that has uh come assembled in this place you have ordained us to be here none of us are here by accident by chance but god you had a purpose and a plan uh to bring us here today so god minister to each and every one of our hearts even those that are tuned in online they could be tuned in elsewhere but god you had them to lock in on the channel today on the stream today we pray that you would speak to them right where they are and god as uh may you through your word produce the change we all need it oh god and we just ask that you take control over this portion of the service it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the lord i did i also want to say thank you to those that sang the specials today my daughter sarah and jeffrey appreciate your specials on today we want to just focus on this subject amen changed um for a little bit and and i know that this is probably going to be a multi-part uh sermon that i will be ministering but it's just something that i have uh in my in my heart um uh and i want to you know just just just just deal with it just for a little bit um next week next week is a uh special day in christendom and it is called pentecost amen pentecost and it's something that i guess for me it's been somewhat troubling you know just a little bit uh to me because um when i when i just looked up pentecost you know i know from a biblical perspective what it is i know what i know what pentecost is uh but you know wikipedia uh certainly when you just put pentecost in and and when is it you know for uh uh for this year uh they got it for next sunday and it typically you know what wikipedia says it's a christian holiday of pentecost the the christian holiday of pentecost is celebrated on the 50th day from easter sunday it celebrated a man from uh the 50 on the 50th day from easter sunday and um it commemorates the descent of the holy spirit upon the apostles and other followers of jesus christ while they were in jerusalem celebrating the feast celebrating the feast of weeks as described in the acts of the apostles and you know so the thing that kind of troubles me a little bit about this is um i don't want pentecost just to become a celebration right uh just something that we look back in time we say oh this happened and we just celebrate it it just becomes a spiritual holiday oh come on somebody amen pentecost is something that we should still be experiencing right now hallelujah amen pentecost is not something that happens just one time a year where we we look at the 50 days after you know easter and we and we you know we we do all special events inside of church pentecost is is more than that and i don't want to i don't want uh wikipedia to just deduce it down to just a celebration amongst amen believers that's that's not what pentecost is amen if we would come in the right mind amen we would come in the right attitude today we can experience pentecost every time we get together in the house of god we can have pentecost oh hallelujah somebody hey man i i want it to be a fresh experience amen i don't i would love for wikipedia to update amen their their uh uh their definition pentecost was experienced at spirit and truth tabernacle 2022 pentecost happened over here pentecost happen over there glory to god pentecost is still happening everywhere glory to god pentecost is living amen pentecost is alive hallelujah we need another pentecost glory to god amen i i i just i i just like i said it just kind of troubled me because you know the other thing you know i want to just kind of make a few few statements here um the church has reduced pentecost to a good feeling or an emotion come on somebody amen the church has reduced pentecost to a good feeling oh hallelujah amen wikipedia has reduced it to an annual celebration amen but i want to give you a prophetic definition amen of of pentecost glory to god go with me to jehovah jireh part three amen here the prophet makes a statement here glory hallelujah and he says this he says um uh uh listen friends i know they say pentecost they organize pentecost he said that's wrong amen they organized pentecost that's wrong jehovah jair part three he says pentecost is an experience oh yes pentecost is an experience glory to god he says the methodist did it the baptist did it all of them did it pentecost is not organized it's an experience look at that i love this church amen it's not organized it's not just an organization amen when we're talking about this we're not just talking about the pentecostal church amen we're that's an organization but we're talking about the experience of it glory to god he says this is an experience and if you haven't had the experience of pentecost come receive it now glory remember if you believe me to be a servant as prophet remember there is a genuine baptism of the holy ghost right in the midst of all the fanaticism there is still a genuine holy ghost birth amen a genuine born of god you come believe it right now and this is this is the thing that's in my spirit we want the genuine amen baptism of the holy ghost we want what they had in the bible to be manifested among us today amen we want the original pentecost not just a feeling not just an emotion but something that changes us from the inside out amen when you really experience pentecost glory you can't act the same you can't walk the same you can't talk the same you can't live the same amen you must be changed when you really had an experience with pentecost glory we will not reduce it to a feeling we will not reduce it to an emotion pentecost will produce a [Applause] life a genuine experience with god [Applause] hallelujah i know what i'm talking about amen it's a genuine experience with god you know i'm i'ma just drop a few things off in here amen going to church is wonderful but god is calling for more [Applause] i was telling the church on wednesday night that god spoke to me this wednesday man god god i mean i was at the pantry and god spoke to me [Music] putting food up in the pantry and um and while i was while i was there i was just thinking on this this subject here and just thinking on a few things and and uh the lord just kind of told me say there is no special section in hell for top payers he said there's no special section in hell for tithe payers and what he was telling is that they're going to be time pairs going to hell and i i wouldn't want to be a top payer in hell you know i mean if we're going to go with god we have to go all the way with god we can't go part way with god amen church amen we we won't we want i mean god he didn't go part way to the cross he went he went fully to the cross and he's calling for a full life from us the full life of surrender not just part of your life see going to church is wonderful but god god has come for more i believe god wants to provide change hallelujah oh my my my mind um uh you know i get to preach and i just be forgetting everything y'all forgive me just just for one moment i i need to stop i mean just call time out just for a second um sister jessica's mother is in the hospital jemima jemima is a sister too uh sister jamin but her mother's in the hospital can we just have a word of prayer amen for her i know that this is a serious uh situation i meant to have that lined up before but and i don't want to keep preaching because i forget so let me just stop and and have a word of prayer father we just come before your presence on behalf of sister theseus lord the doctors have um they're still somewhat befuddled they're trying to figure everything out and lord our sister's going through in her body family just surrounding day day in and day out just providing support to what a a woman of god she has been lord a real staple amen in the church and god we're asking that you would get in between her condition amen what the doctors have diagnosed get in between that condition lord and bring healing to her body we send a man uh isaiah lord 53 towards her right now you were wounded for her transgressions bruised for her iniquities the chastisement of the pieces upon you and god you told us with your stripes that we are healed so we're claiming healing of our sister even right now and we command you satan lose her and let her go that she'd be able to return back home and be with her loved ones oh god and father we ask that you work a miracle even right now we don't accept any report any evil report we only believe the report of the lords and his report says we are healed so we accept it now father in the mighty name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord glory to god amen so um my thing here going to church is wonderful but god is calling for for more amen i believe god wants to be the one to provide change and the way he does that is by filling us with his spirit amen and i was just looking at a couple things here uh peter hung around the church but he wasn't changed peter fellowship with jesus but he wasn't changed walked on water but he wasn't changed come on somebody peter experienced the supernatural but he wasn't changed that same peter when the when when the test came begin to curse glory to god we got saints still in the church coming to church week after week but you still got a foul mouth it's the truth anyhow you got a foul attitude oh come on somebody amen you got all these things in you you need a change we all need a change and the holy ghost is what produces that change at the peter experienced pentecost amen he never had that foul mouth anymore amen something has got to happen to change us from the inside something's got to happen to change our attitudes [Music] oh glory to god we must have a change and it's only the holy ghost that can produce the change only the holy ghost can do it amen so i'm not preaching the holy ghost as a feeling i'm not preaching the holy ghost as an emotion i'm preaching the holy ghost as a changer you see i want to just just just just you know make it clear when the presence of god draws near yeah it will produce emotion when the president of god is here you'll get emotional amen and there's nothing wrong that if you i mean uh uh i i i i think it's very normal for people to get emotional amen when god comes by sometimes it might cause somebody to go in tears amen somebody might go into uncontrollable praise amen it's just emotion when the presence of god come near nothing wrong with that but i'ma tell you this if you can have an uncontrollable praise and you can break down in tears and still go live the same old ungodly life that you were living before amen something wrong with that amen i don't want him come just to touch me amen but i want him to live on the inside of me i want him to express himself through me praise god amen just don't stop at a touch lord i need more than that amen i can't live the right kind of life without your spirit amen [Applause] hallelujah glory amen listen uh uh uh when there's there's things that the holy ghost does when he comes amen it just don't stop at a shout out it don't stop at a jump it don't stop at a tongue amen there's other things that the holy ghost does when it comes amen some people just want the blessings of the spirit oh come on somebody amen amen amen amen we don't want to just stop at the blessings but if god had a purpose he did not send the holy ghost just to be a blessing amen but the holy ghost came so that we can continue the works of jesus you can't do the works of god without the spirit of god oh i feel jesus in the place you know i remember uh uh the two brothers when brother branham first come in contact with the with the pentecostal people a man and uh you know he got there to the meeting and and he'd never seen anything like it before while he was there one particular man would rise up and speak in tongues and then after he was speaking to us another man would start interpreting now i'm gonna tell you that's the way it used to that's the way it started off that when a tongue went forth there was an interpretation that's the way it started now we don't have it anymore amen oftentimes we don't have it and the reason we don't have it because we don't wait on it oh it's the truth anyhow but it used to be because you know the scripture tells us that you know somebody came in your midst that they would think you were barbarians if everybody's just speaking in tongues don't interpret they think you barbarians that's what the scripture tell us we're trying to get back to the bible but here this man would he would rise up he would speak in tongues and and the other would interpret and brother branham said oh wow what a wonderful manifestation of spirit see i've never seen nothing like it he said i gotta get to talk to these brothers and see what is it that they got that i don't have so as he start fellowshipping with one he says uh he's saying he he discerned this man was a real genuine christian and then he said brother you know what is that that y'all y'all gotta say brother it's the holy ghost do you have it no i don't i don't have any say brother just keep praying god will give you the holy ghost gotta get it and he can give you these gifts with the holy ghost oh my i think that's another thing some people are operating in gifts without the holy ghost [Applause] that's right it's the truth in half they operate without it amen amen but here this man you know the other man some brother brandon i'm going to talk to each other he said he's saying he just start talking to me just kind of bless him you ain't talking tongues yet you haven't spoken in tongues yet you ain't got nothing it's like wait brother i'm just trying to learn this i'm just trying to learn just wait wait give me time and then after a while he started kept talking kept talking picked up a vision showed that this man had been married he was currently married but living with another woman and had children by the other woman while he's married to the other lady and he's inside the church interpreting tongues [Applause] brother branham say no this is devil's now he said no this ain't of god this is devil so he tried to pull away from but god showed him no the rain will fall on the just and the unjust oh can i ask you something do you want to be just or do you want to be unjust now you're going to get holy ghost blessings in either category but i want to be just [Applause] i don't want to be an unjust person operating in the spirit because the end result is hell for that person [Applause] i don't care what you do in church i don't care i allowed you hallelujah if you can't live right [Applause] if you can't live according to the words then there's something wrong with your spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] the holy spirit a man should invoke any motion but the purpose of the spirit dwelling in us is much greater than the emotion [Applause] when he the holy ghost has come this is the bible now he will lead you into all truth so the holy ghost comes to bring you the truth when you stumble around in darkness the holy ghost come to leave you the truth another thing that the holy ghost does say you shall receive power oh my god amen power after the holy ghost comes upon you and what is this powerful is power to help you live right it's power to help you talk right it's power to help you walk right there is power from god you know you think about the children of israel they were just so messed up in their their their uh their that they were coming off for their their sacrifices and they repent of their sins and they come and offer sacrifice for the sin and and then they go right back out after they offer the sacrifice after they slayed their lamb after they did all these things they go right back out and live the same old kind of life and it's because they did not have access to the spirit of god but now we have full access it should produce different results there should be a change when the holy ghost comes in they're supposed to be a change [Music] oh my statement the prophet says that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the lord see we need a pentecost to keep us clean oh yes we're getting polluted i'ma say it again the the church is getting polluted [Applause] all you got to do is watch i i i have to kind of get off of social media sometime my spirit get vexed at what i see saints posted you a saint how you got music like that in your background how can you do that that you can't you there is no way the spirit of god can be pleased with that [Applause] it's the truth anyhow i mean you know the rap music is of the devil we just got all kinds of just it's not some apps we don't need as christians we don't need them i'm i'm preaching change this morning i'm preaching change there's got to be a change somewhere somehow god got to come and do something for us we used to have conviction we used to have it where is the conviction at now we don't let down the standards on everything it's time to pick the standards back up again and the only way we're gonna get it god got to come and produce change we need a pentecost [Applause] a cleansing in the church glory to god we need a cleansing in the church make you think right make you talk right think about what you posted before you posted it destroys your christian testimony [Applause] we're christians we're christians we don't do like everybody else does no matter what no matter what we we christians amen everything everything that i'm associated in life with i am a christian [Applause] amen if i'm in college i'm a christian if i got a a job amen that i go to nine to five i'm a christian just talking to a brother recently he had a job really good job really good job amy says you know i was doing this and i was doing that and but i just noticed that in order to keep that job i was going to compromise some of my christian testimony so he said you know what i decided to do i just let the job go gave up on my career because i did not want to sacrifice my christian testimony in order to keep a job we need other people with conviction like that look if god doesn't send me business i ain't got a compromise to get it oh somebody know recently i had a little situation just kind of rise up in our business we we had a couple customers and and um and and and you know they were giving us so many hours like man we're doing all right we're doing all right next thing you know we had a big blow up and and then we lost the customers gone and the very day that we lost him i'm sitting there a little

my dad and said oh my not going to tell you just yet wait till you sign no i didn't i i didn't serve your daddy i didn't serve your daddy but i'm glad they did a good job because you remember the name they're not in business but we're here and we're going to serve your family and through that they blessed us with double the amount that we lost triple the amount that we lost look when god is in it god is in it you ain't got to compromise nothing we're christians [Applause] oh come on church amen glory to god don't you be lying to get no business deal don't you be lying you got the holy ghost to say no to that don't you be lying to get nothing like [Applause] hey that holy ghost supposed to make you a christian 24 7. [Applause] hey this is not just some feeling we come and get when we come to church no no no this this is something that goes with us after we leave church it lives in us lives through us all right now let me keep on going amen look at this now i want to read something out of uh what is the holy ghost amen hallelujah hallelujah changed change look at this the prophet makes this statement now there is a vast difference now i don't got up here what time did i start so i don't preach too long but i the lord knows all things here here amen um in the message what is the holy ghost he says now there is a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost feel christian can you believe that there is a vast a big difference between somebody just saying i'm a christian and another one saying i'm a holy ghost field christian let's hover there for a little while amen even amen glory to god because christians can just dress right christians can just act a part out christians can do that amen i told you peter was hanging around the church peter was with jesus peter did all of that amen but but it was only after the holy ghost came in that it really changed peter oh hallelujah amen and people should be able to see the difference in a christian and a holy ghost feel christian i'm not talking about you seeing the difference i'm talking about people seeing the difference between a christian and a holy ghost feel christian your life is supposed to be producing something else if you claim the experience of the holy ghost [Applause] your life should i mean i offer up different sacrifices you shouldn't be responding the same way other people respond oh the holy ghost to control your mouth the holy ghost can control your tongue the holy ghost can control your responses on social media the holy ghost will tell you no don't put that out there the holy ghost is saying stop the arguing [Applause] where there is no wood the fire season and what you say out of your mouth brings wood to the situation oh i feel like preaching anyway today holy ghost is your stop praise god the holy ghost got a big stop sign no stop don't go no further the holy ghost say don't put that on don't wear that don't go out like that the holy ghost say don't dress like that yes it does and i'm gonna tell you something if we all got the same holy ghost that they had at pentecost [Applause] it should produce the same results [Applause] a difference not only just the difference vast yes [Applause] [Music] there's a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost field christian so now we're going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scripture the first place there there is a christian professed to be a christian see they might have repented of their sins and that's as far as they can go but if you actually if you if you've if you've approached it the right way if you've come according to acts 2 you repent then you're baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ and then it says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost then it says the promise is unto you and to your children that means you ain't got to compromise with your children i ain't got to compromise with my children to keep them right i don't want to lose them i can't lose them [Applause] when i know that they have been placed according to the scripture i can't lose my child [Music] well mama you did this and daddy you did that that's why i'm the way i am today i ain't got i understand i understand and i'm gonna tell you something you you may not get it yet because you ain't got no children right but one day when you get children and you have to make decisions you realize that you ain't perfect either praise god dream perfect right but i did the best that i could and and if you want me to say sorry because that's some people that's all they want you to hear that they just want to hear you say sorry it don't mean nothing more than just hearing you say sorry do you want to hear it sorry [Applause] i say sorry as many times you want me to say it ain't gonna change nothing cause i did the best that i could [Applause] and i did it according to the word of god and he told me if i was a man to repent i did that go to god be baptized i did that he said i was going to receive the gift of the holy ghost he's giving me that and now the next thing the next part he said he gonna also feel my children so i'ma just sit here and wait on god to do what god say he gonna do you can't stop the promises of god hey i'm gonna have a pentecost they're gonna have a penalty cause we're gonna have a pentecost hallelujah [Applause] [Music] the first place there's a christian professed to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in process of being a christian so when you see people that's in process you just be patient with them but i'm just not talking to the ones in process i'm talking the ones that claim a holy ghost experience all right this holy ghost experience should produce something it should be changed amen and not just something that you say you did the the people will recognize it the people will recognize it man they post are different than other people yeah they they stay that they some something different about them folks should know that you are different and i ain't talking about balancing god amen you know because we we we try to balance god i'm gonna do so much of this and then i'm gonna spend so much time in prayer and then i'm gonna do so much of this and then i'm gonna spend so much time in church don't put god on those scales when when you put god on the scale so you got god over here and the things of the world over here when i put god on my scale i ain't trying to do this i want my scale to be i want to be all gods [Applause] tip my skills [Applause] come on somebody tip my scale like like remember how we was young used to get on a see-saw brother you had to get somebody equal weight amen so you can enjoy the experience if they was too heavy for you you was in trouble you was going to be up all the time never coming down and when it comes to god i want to always be up and never coming down tip my scale tip my seesaw tip my life [Applause] but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in the process of being a christian see he has professed to believe it he's working to it but god has not yet given him this spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet reached that goal with god that god's recognized it so you've been in church for years and god still recognizes that you've come to a spot where you really want the holy ghost we say we want it but oftentimes we just want just enough for a blessing we don't want the one that go and change our our living change our conditions amen hallelujah it'll it uh it'll the holy ghost will make you turn your tv off ain't gonna get no amens there the holy ghost won't let you watch anything on tv holy ghost i mean you you won't you won't allow your kids to walk around cursing in your house but you allow that movie to just fly off all kind of words in the in the presence of your kids and everybody else it's the truth anyhow right there used to be some conviction as soon as you hear curse word you gotta turn it off i got i got scriptures here all the tables are full of vomit [Applause] all of them are full of honor ain't nothing clean right amen praise god amen but but holy ghost for the people we live different we act different we we we're not just christians we holy ghosts feel christians all right amen it goes on says uh i think i can i can i'll go because that god made a covenant with abraham after he called abraham which is a type of calling believer today he called abraham and abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land to dwell amongst strange people so you know that's just that's what just coming to church that caused you to do that right it says and that was a type of when god calls a man to stop his meanness that god has called you to stop being me lord let it soak in stop being mean [Applause] christians can be some of the meanest [Music] with the holy ghost you ought to be able to discern yeah when you walk into a situation and things just saying right say hey hey something ain't right about this like going to a restaurant you get to the restaurant and maybe the the waitress or the waiter ain't treating you right let your holy ghost discernment kick in rather than your meanness kicking right oftentimes we don't let the holy ghost kick in we let the meanness oh you can't treat me like that i thought you was a christian didn't they treat jesus like that didn't they spit on him didn't they they say things about him that weren't true then they treat him any kind of way how did he respond [Applause] father forgive them for they knew not what they do when we gonna just stop being mean it turns from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd among new types of people all right so you know this there should be a change that takes place when the holy ghost has come in amen this is again not just a celebration right it's not just a good feeling but when god when when his presence comes near we we open up and we receive what he has for us he wants to he wants to indwell god wants to live in you hallelujah god needs hands god needs feet god needs a mouth and god wants to use you as his hands his feet in his mouth and and listen he already know that uh you got a problem with your tongue he already know that so that's why he came to give you his spirit so he can so his spirit can control your tongue [Applause] but you gotta yield yourself to that and it's a dying daily all right here uh let me read this what what is the holy ghost go to paragraph 54 in this there's there's a purpose that god gave us the holy ghost amen amen amen there's a purpose you know brother branham uh he preaches the sermon and i'll i'll i'll read a quote out of that in a second um he did the series of what is the holy ghost and then what is the holy ghost giving for amen and i just kind of went back and you know sometimes you'd be looking so deep so deep so deep so deep trying to find what what what the prophet said and sometimes just one little statement this is what the holy ghost was given for no not just a feeling not just an emotion not just a a spiritual holiday no no no no this is much greater than that look at this and what is the holy ghost it says spirit of god in his church what for what did he do it for he says this is a little on tomorrow night's subject it says but what did he do it for he says why did he why did the holy spirit what did he come for what did he come in you for what did he come in me for look at here's the answer was to continue the works of god amen yes sir to continue the words of god so the holy ghost helps you to live like jesus the holy ghost uh help you to act like jesus hey you don't realize it but you become a little jesus when you are filled with the holy ghost a little messiah when you're filled with the holy ghost he says i always do that which is pleasing to my father let me just let me let me let i'm going to stop right there don't call in time out again listen jesus did not operate in any kind of way that would bring a man a disgrace to daddy jesus didn't didn't handle himself any kind of way where his daddy would be impacted by that brothers and sisters in christ when we got the holy ghost we can't live any kind of way that's going to embarrass our father people look at you and say i thought you said you was a christian you don't want that kind of life yeah i thought you said she was a christian no you want a life where they say hey it's something different about you i can see it all over you i i see light when i see you that's what you want to hear from people it's not you declaring what you got it's other folk being able to declare that i know saints that have been in the grocery store and people just start following them yeah why are you following me what's going on i just i feel a presence i see something amen you know you know and for me that's biblical because when when peter was passing by man folk was so they knew god was in this man i'm talking about the same man that was cursed but something happened on the day of pentecost where this man got a change well now when he's passing by people say just let me lay on the side of the street where the shadow will pass me and if this man shadow passes me he ain't even got to touch me if i can just get in the presence of his shadow i know i'll be major that's what the holy ghost is supposed to produce oh hallelujah god that's the holy ghost we want thank you jesus glory glory glory i always do that which is pleasing to my father i come not to do my own will but the father sent me and the father sent me uh is with me and as my father has sent me so send i you yeah right glory oh my the father sent him within him the father that sent jesus came in him worked through him the jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that spirit living in jesus christ made him do and act the way he did you'll have some general idea how it'll do when it's in you all you got to do is read the script and see how jesus handled himself because he said you know i go away but i'm sending the comforter back to you that was his spirit dwelling inside of us well if his spirit made him do certain things the same spirit will make us do the same thing you have some general idea how to do when it's in you because because that life that life that life his life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature for it is god i like that brother branham says uh the holy ghost won't misbehave itself in you and then behave itself in me the holy ghost don't do that the holy ghost behave itself in everybody and i'ma say it like this the holy ghost behave itself in everybody in everything every area of life the holy ghost is in control all right amen here let me read this out of what was the holy ghost giving for amen amen amen amen thank god for this and i don't know where i'm at with time i don't know where i'm at uh but i i will i will just i will just do all my all i can uh here what was the holy ghost given for he says this now the purpose what was god's purpose in sending the holy spirit says now mark that down john 14 beginning that 14th verse and reading through the chapter for the basis so you can go back and read that it says god's purpose we find here in sending the holy spirit was one purpose god had one purpose it says that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church i love that god himself might dwell in his church that means you don't belong to yourself you you know you don't own yourself he owns you you belong to god now when you're filled with his spirit you belong to him right it says god's purpose be found here and send the holy spirit was one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that god was in christ's continuous plans through christ out of christ into the church continues work through the church god i want to be yielded so you can continue playing through me change this word change means to to make form nature content future course of something different from what it is or what it would be if left alone so so what a change does it actually changes your direction amen because have you been left alone amen you keep doing the things that you're doing and actually it'll get worse if you're just left alone if nobody say nothing to you come on y'all ain't talking to me yet if there if god don't god don't anoint a message to come to you you'll keep doing what you're doing and you won't even feel no conviction right but what god has to do is send something to uh to to to to to to just kind of uh maybe just rough your feathers a little bit ruffle your feathers no you're going in the wrong direction now you can be a christian in church and still doing wrong [Music] as christians what we have to do we have to follow god's word in every area even in areas that we don't like following yes god is concerned about every area like he concerned he concerned how you dress you can say you know even god concerned about how your hair looks he concerned that's why he wrote certain scriptures there about your hair he concerned about how the brother's hair looks i guess we read them scriptures they're concerned about the sisters hair and the brother's hair brothers cut their hair sisters let their hair grow [Applause] that's what god said amen all right holy ghost folk holy ghost folk follow the word amen just go back and read it in the bible and don't add your own interpretation to it just accept it the way god said it and don't even try to say well that was for back in that time you think god is that simple right that god can only rob right laws that's gonna work for one period of time god knew every generation that was gonna come on the earth and he had to have a word establish that to keep everybody [Applause] man our children are being raised in a very wicked society [Applause] and there are certain spirits that are released in this day look here i'm gonna just be honest with you i would not be surprised if i we got to get out we got to get our school up and running but our kids would get attacked by a homosexual demon school they're going to get attacked it's a spirit that has been released all over the nation and they even trying to teach it in the schools tell them that it's all right they're going to be attacked our children will be attacked [Applause] and if they're attacked like that then the devil might get them out there into something [Applause] it's just the devil look look look i i said like this if uh if god has already warned us that these fears was coming into the land god had enough power in his spirit to keep our children in the midst of all of this i don't care how much sin is going on we have a remedy it is the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] put your children in environments where they can receive the spirit of god amen where they can have experience after experience i have to experience with god i know they just came from youth meeting send them to the next one trying to get them in environments where they can get something from god you don't have no problem sending them to school i try to put them into a meeting atmosphere yeah months in advance meeting meeting meeting meeting there's a certain anointing that comes from meetings happening yeah i mean they're just telling me a sister um she wanted to meet him so bad and she knew it hadn't even been and been um uh finalized anything say the sister went out and bought her tickets by faith on the weekend that she was expecting to meet his dad and you know what god did put the meetings on the weekend and she bought her tickets when people come to services like that there's a level of expectation that rises don't plan vacation when we having a meeting what amen preaching how you gonna do something like that where where is your mind what's more important to you i i like i said on wednesday night people don't believe in the coming of the lord i mean that's all you used to hear is preacher preaching about the coming of the lord the coming of the lord coming that's all you heard when you went to church amen even the songwriters wrote songs about the coming of the lord you don't hear that no more people don't believe it well it might be another 100 years might be another two i can't believe i can't accept that i see the signs all around me pointing to that this is the time and we ought to be in a hurry for god now more than ever before we too relaxed see that that's why we need change something got to change inside of us amen my thinking got to change my response has got to change amen my actions got to change and the holy ghost produces a change glory to god look at this um i was where was i reading from okay i think uh no no no here here's what i want to say uh to make the word the the word change means to make form nature content uh future courses something different from what it what it is or what it would be if left alone to transform or convert and their their their example is the witch changed the prince into a frog that's that's what their example is but i see the holy ghost changed me from amen this this this this wretched fellow amen indifferent fellow amen to a real son of god another another definition of the word change is to remove a dirty diaper from a baby oh come on i like that amen to remove a dirty diaper from a baby and to replace it with a new one you know even even a baby has a way of letting you know that they need to be changed come on somebody they can't talk they can't even talk they can't express themselves but they know when something has happened and they know that a change needs to happen some kind of way to baby make their way over to you and just begin to pull on you and pull on you and you trying to figure out what you want what you want you try to get a bottle no i don't want the bottle and they throw the bottle down they start crying and all kind of stuff because that baby realizes i need a change hey we we need some babies in christ that recognizes they need change and they will get they will do whatever they need to do to get the change after that baby get that diaper change now i can go back to doing what it was doing it feel all right till another change needs to happen oh hallelujah every time i come to church i need a change wednesday night i need a change sunday morning i need a change [Applause] hallelujah look at this the catalyst of every change begins in the heart yes you don't change from the outside but you change from the inside out see a caterpillar has a change inside the cocoon glory to god amen the change that he has to go through uh he go he goes in as a caterpillar amen into the cocoon and while he's there inside the cocoon he's just working his way through all the changes his body is going through a metamorphosis amen christians we need to go through a metamorphosis glory to god when he goes into the cocoon and amen brother branham say don't cut the cocoon now because if you cut the cocoon amen you'll mess up the process amen you got to let him get hurt in the cocoon you got to let him amen try to figure his way out mama not their daddy not there nobody there but they're caterpillar in god amen and just working through the process and while he's in the cool cocoon amen some legs are dropping off praise god some skin is dropping off and he's trying to figure out what in the world is going on with me amen but before you know it glory to god while everything dropping off there's something growing praise god some wings are coming out the color is changing don't look like a worm no more amen i've gone through my process of change and i come busting out the catcoon of the cocoon like a big beautiful butterfly hallelujah amen god needs some christians that's willing to go through the process of change [Applause] glory to god let me just turn uh to this scripture that we were reading from and i will try to find my way out but i i want to come back to this amen a little bit later now i i want you to see here in acts 9 acts 9. oh thank you lord thank you lord so so much that we want to stay here but here in acts 9 verse 19 and when he had received meat he was strengthened then we saw certain days with the disciples which were at damascus and straightway he preached acts 9 verse 19 and 20. and straight where he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god and i just i just wanted to stop there just for a second just uh this acts 9 if we were to read a little earlier in the chapter we would see that this is a man the the place where uh saul a man who later became paul but his name was saul at this time saul had an experience on the road to damascus hallelujah it's this is where he met the lord jesus and and and and while he was he had uh commissioned the letters to go down and persecute all the christians uh this was his you know he had he had signed documents that he could go down there and arrest anybody that believed in this jesus and as he was on his way down uh the lord jesus approaches in a great light and i like to say the light that paul saw was the same light that came out of god when he said let there be light there wasn't sunlight that came out of god because on the fourth day is when you saw a greater light and lesser light the sun and the moon but the first light that came out of god was this light that paul is seeing it's the light of christ [Applause] amen it's the same light that led the children of israel glory to god it was a pillar of cloud by day and a pill of fire by night it's that light that the children of israel follow amen that same light showed up on a picture in this day amen over the head of a prophet in houston in the houston coliseum amen so this is the light that paul was talking to and i want you to notice paul saw it as a great light hallelujah and not only paul saw but even the others saw the light but the light began to talk to paul why are you persecuting me paul you know it's hard for you to kick against the prick and paul spoke back to the light paul said who art thou lord oh i love this because when he uses lord now he's not sure who this is paul he said i know it's god so who art thou lord who art thou lord and then the light spoke back to him hey we got it now i am jesus the light identified who he was so that first light that came out of god was christ when he said let there be light hallelujah you realize you're always walk in darkness unless you have christ's light coming through you revealing itself to you'll always be in darkness you need light paul paul paul paul recognized that this was christ and and paul lost his eyesight and paul was told after this tremendous experience and then it says now go into the city and wait and it'll be told you what to do now i want i want you to get something i want you to catch this real quick paul had a tremendous supernatural experience but paul did not have the holy ghost after this big experience with god and many people come in church and they have supernatural experiences but they still don't have the holy ghost paul only got the holy ghost after ananias went down to his house prayed for him god said now go down into his house pray for him i want you to pray that he'll get his sight and also pray that he'll receive the holy ghost so as only after ananias went to paul that paul received the baptism of the holy ghost even though he had a nice supernatural experience same thing with peter peter had all these peter walked on what a supernatural experience but without the holy ghost so we don't want to just have supernatural experiences we want a real pentecost amen they have to go together can i can i just say it like this we want to worship in spirit and in truth they have to go together but now here's a good thing after this experience with paul i mean paul has this experience on the road to damascus has ananias come and pray for him and he receives healing amen in his eyes as well as he receives the baptism in the holy ghost now this is the this is where the scripture picks it up in verse 20 uh acts 9 19 because now uh 19 through 21 uh verse 20 says a straight way he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god and look at this but all that heard him were amazed and said now notice it's not you telling people amen i change i change i check it's other for recognizing you can say whatever you want to say but if don't nobody see it you can call yourself a orange tree all you want to but if people see apples you're not an orange tree you are an apple tree amen now go a little further you can call yourself a holy ghost field christian all you want to but if people just see christian tendencies and not holy ghost christian field tendencies you can say what you want but a tree is known by its fruit thank you lord jesus glory to god we need change lords somebody got a dirty spiritual diaper and stop walking around with that dirty diaper actually if the child don't come to you asking for a change when you begin to get a whiff of that diaper you're going to get that child and you're going to make sure they get changed hallelujah it's a true thing they have yeah and then they keep dirt and them diapers cows so they get to a certain age be like you don't want them wearing diapers no more you want to get them potty trained amen we should be growing up in god we shouldn't be at the same spot we was five years ago amen we should be growing up in god you you ought to be elevating in god amen amen here it says this verse 21 says but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem they recognized something changed by this man his message changed glory to god his his attitude changed his focus changed come on everything about this man is change because this guy this guy i say ain't this the same guy and he came hither for that intent that he might bring them down until the chief priest they might even see the letters in his pocket but this man is not operating the way he was operating before he met that great light hallelujah amen but it's even after that supernatural experience when he had his hands laid on him and he received the holy ghost something happened on the inside of paul oh we need that that's a real pentecost right there when something happens on the inside of you and other folk recognize it then you know then you know for certain that it's his spirit that's dwelling in you it's no you're no longer your own you belong to him paul had a supernatural experience on the road to damascus but he did not receive the holy ghost until ananias laid hands on him to receive his sight and the holy ghost and and and i just wanted to just put this in here i might have to stop here but i'ma come back to this go go go with me to one more scripture here ezekiel 36. amen oh we need change here in ezekiel 36 picking up verse 23 our children need it [Music] we we need we're going to need the holy ghost we're not going to make it without it and i don't want us just to be coming to church just to come to church we need we need to get closer to god and and you know i i've we've been here and we don't see some powerful services we don't experience the presence of god we don't we know that but if it ain't changing us something's wrong with it we need to go deeper deeper with this amen i i mean when i see somebody just get a big blessing like that i'm looking for the changes glory to god shouted all over the place cried all over the place jumped all over the place and still living the same old ungodly life lord i know your holy ghost can do more than that i know your holy ghost do more than that take the meanness out hey amen we we need that i remember just my own personal testimony remember going to church one time and man i was just so indifferent and the way i would come to church i would i would come in late i would be one of the last ones to get there and the first one to leave because i didn't want nobody talking to me right but i knew i had to go to church so i would just i would just do that and you know weekend and week out and and you know nobody said nothing to me but one day the pastor was preaching i can't even remember what he preached all i remember the holy ghost came into the room and when the holy ghost came in i was sitting in my little corner amen when the holy ghost come you can't stop him [Music] i don't care what your attitude is he got a way of overriding your attitude and i'm sitting on my my bad attitude i'm getting ready to leave but man the holy ghost got the moving in there and and uh you know and i'm like and see i knew enough to be sensitive and reverent to the holy ghost you don't start walking and moving all around when the holy ghost moving parents keep your kids under control when the movement of the spirit happens that ain't the time to go to the bathroom no sit there you should have went earlier amen but you sit there right now because the holy ghost is moving make your children respect the holy ghost i knew not to move because the holy ghost was there so i just sat there i ain't getting up and leaving church i'm just sat there and before you know when i'm sitting there i just happen to just all right just a little hand next thing you know when both of them hands up and lord i thank you god it brought an emotion but that emotion broke amen something that was inside of me and i had no more indifference i was not trying to leave church early after that i was around greeting everybody god bless you brother god bless you sister we used to receive the holy ghost and it calls us to apologize to one another we need that kind of holy ghost again [Applause] man i remember sister wesker just walked up to me just grinning y'all know that smile that sister was she she she ain't saying nothing just grinning she said she just grinning just shaking my hand she she knew god did it i want god to do it all over again i want god to do it all over again god break this break that i need change lord amen here you know this scripture tells us in in ezekiel 36 verse 23 and i will sanctify my great name oh i i just like the way the words speak because you know i'm gonna tell y'all israel was living such a life that they profaned god's name yes we also get to a point where we live certain type of lives that we profane god's name we're profaning i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified where in you where is it gonna do it in you before their eyes they gonna see it look at what god say here for i will take you from among the heathen

dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god the land that he gave to our fathers what he gave to them at pentecost that's the land we want to dwell in not just a feeling not just an emotion something that produces a change peter was changed paul was changed i mean there was a scripture that that brother simba read earlier i got in my notes john was changed you know before john got the holy ghost you know what he's ready to do called down fire lord they not that we saw casting out devils what you want us to do we'll call down fire like elijah did we'll destroy him god don't take the power like that and use it for that purpose so you don't even know what spiritual of john you don't realize that's not what i come to do to destroy people i come to give life when when john got the holy ghost he wrote a different he wrote something different beloved amen no beloved let us love one another for love is of god and he that loveth not is not of god amen john change the holy ghost should produce change amen you should dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleanness holy ghost to bring your kids from out of these conditions that they're in and and i'm telling you i'm i'm just letting you all know don't y'all be shocked by nothing the spirit that is in the land this they them um whatever i don't even know what it is but i saw one guy put on his his uh his profile and and linkedin him him he him that's what i am that ain't changed i don't know bathe them i'm he i'm a guy i'm he she's a girl she [Music] you understand them i'm talking about all all of them it's a whole group of people you ain't them and you one person actually you them and a bunch of spirits that's living inside of you [Applause] we got legion on the scene again [Applause] amen and y'all stopped letting people just especially your family members you know you ain't raised them like that well don't come i'm gonna call you exactly what you are what i put on your birth certificate that's what you are [Applause] animals and concern and confused about what they are uh you know you get a male aunt a dog come out you you look at this which one is male which one female how can you tell you confused you shouldn't be it's very obvious now i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you where you could get confused in in in in nature trees yeah it could be female a male right amen oh glory to god mama just gave me a lesson she had a tree that was a a a a a a female tree and this female tree was so big it was mothering the entire yard bringing all the shade the female tree but in in the tree mothering the the yard it actually uh did not allow the other trees to produce there's a sermon there in order for the other trees to produce she had to cut back the mother tree yeah i'm talking about change that did produce a change in the other trees all right now i will also save you from all your uncleanness and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall ye remember your own evil ways and you're doings that were not good some of the stuff we've been doing is not good and shall load yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel thus saith the lord in the in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded so you end up doing this for our glory we're not doing this for our own honor but god does this for his glory god wants to see people change and not just change for the day and go right back to doing the same thing tomorrow no i want to be changed from glory to glory to glory i want to i want to go cross closer and closer to god everything that i do i wanted to be for his honor i don't want to bring reproach upon his name and nothing that i do nothing nothing that i do glory to god you know it um um i think i told y'all last year we were i got tired of my wife working on sunday i i got tired of always having an ox in the ditch just got tired of it and um so you know i i know that the the feel that i'm in health care is one of those fields that it's it's 24 7. 7 it's every day and um and and people when they get into a situation where they need help they need help it don't matter what day it is they need help i mean i remember one sunday we was at church and man my um i didn't realize diabetes was acting up in my body and i come trying to have communion and i just told the church once we were doing communion i said i'm gonna need y'all to hurry up come on up here and get the communion i'm gonna have to leave here and go to the hospital it was a sunday i had to be rushed to the hospital and when i got to the hospital on sunday i was glad somebody was at work i needed it right but but i also know that you know there's got to be a balance here so so so i don't want my wife have to go to work or even some of the caregivers i don't want them to have to go to work on something so i had to i had to pray a very specific prayer i say lord i need some seven dead venice in the business [Music] and you know what god sent me you know why they don't want to work on saturdays but they have no problem working on sunday their conviction is saturday is the seventh day i'm not gonna try to change you know i look i worship on saturday i worship on sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday i worship every day i'm not limiting my worship to one day but if that's where your convictions that's all you can see praise god we can work together right sometimes you need to be specific about what you're asking god for and hold to it if chick-fil-a can be blessed and refuse to work on sundays i i i i i want to follow the pattern amen amen look church we got to be changed i don't want us to just be um going along and just we compromising with the things of the world we're doing all that no church no we christians and it's supposed to be a big difference in the way that we live as holy ghost field christians as compared to those that don't have the holy ghost and if you don't have the holy ghost you've got to start praying and seeking god until you get it amen another thing i tell you this is god's this is god's way for you to get the holy ghost repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and if you've repented and you know you've done that you've been baptized then the prophet said god is obligated and when you pray you just tell god lord you obligated to fill me with the holy ghost and i'm not gonna talk about no feeling i'm talking about change a dove cleans itself from the inside oil is produced from the inside flows to the outside and keeps it white as snow that's why we need something happening on the inside that produces itself on the outside and we we stay clean from the things world we don't want the pollution the pollution the pollution of the world we need god we need a change let's pray father lord i just released in my heart i know lord that we're living in a very difficult time and without the holy ghost we will not make it we can come to church we can jump we can shout we can scream we can do all these things but lord if that change ain't taking place on the inside god we're we're going through just emotions it's not what i want it's not what it's not what i'm asking for god lord i want that same change that paul had the same change that that peter had oh father same change that john had we can look at these different characters in scripture their nature changed after the holy ghost came in [Music] father this is this is exactly what we need our nature our desires our thoughts our actions our reactions our intentions everything it needs to change we can't keep going the same direction that we're going lord the hours late [Music] time is at hand the rapture is upon us help us to keep a balance on these things that we're involved in gone we always want you lord to rule out we want you to amen be first and foremost in everything we do all that we have is because you gave it to us and you don't give us anything that would cause us amen to draw further away from you that's not that's not how you operate but satan will certainly be there to try to lord just just just pull us in this direction pull us in that we gotta fight against it gotta fight it lord we need change [Music] lord my prayer is that the hearts of the people this is why i prayed earlier that not only taking control of the thoughts that would be spoken but take control of the thoughts that would be received let the people know that it's you trying to reach them oh god it's you that love them and you that care father and you want to draw closer to him we got to be willing to yield and give up go back to the word not our explanation or some other person's explanation lord but what does it say right here in black and white what does the bible say we want to live the scripture that's our desire father it's in jesus name [Music] that we pray [Music] hallelujah [Music] glory to your name jesus we need your lord we need your lord right now we need you lord we need
