how we appreciate the lord jesus tonight he can be seated man in his presence it's just good to be back amen in the house of the lord and we're coming off a little time of prayer even though last night had a prayer meeting here and just setting the expectations for these meetings amen this weekend with our precious brother caleb i believe it was wednesday night that it reached out to me and we

a call when you when you can brother jack i said okay sure and he called me and i called him and it gave me this grand surprise amen um it said that you're going to have some some saints from his church joining him and we're happy to have them with us amen on tonight brother with jesse and sister hadassah amen i got it right tonight sis [Applause] last night i called her sister hannah and they wouldn't let me live it down but since the hadassah should know because we have a hadassah you know but uh but they they made it and amen and we're just happy to have them in west palm beach uh fellowshiping with us amen and i just believe god got great things in store uh for us amen this weekend uh i um just want to just give a few announcements amen um for those that are just online don't

do um online um as well as we have the ability for you to mail your uh offering in if you wanted to and as i mentioned before we have been receiving uh giving from saints that i can't say that we we know personally but somehow they have been touched by the ministry blessed by the ministry and we are so grateful that you have found it in your heart just to give a offering a man to to the church sometimes as a building fund donation and uh we're just so grateful i believe especially those that are have been doing that uh when you all see us in the new building uh you will amen be a part of that you'll be a part of that so amen we just thank god for you but our giving is through paypal or through cash app uh if you use paypal we asked it to choose the option give to friend or family member and that email address that you'll use is giving at john423.orggiving at john423.org if you wanted to use cash app then you would just uh use dollar sign spearing to t and that will just go

your people a hundredfold thank you for continuing to meet the needs of this church and we also know that you meet the needs of your people so we pray god that you would bless them also god we just

through this time give us wisdom and direction lord as we just follow you through these difficult times jesus name we pray amen amen so um brother caleb is one that does not need a man an introduction um many y'all though most of us know brother caleb and we were trying to put it together i think it's been eight years amen and brother marquis that go that ate again but i think it's been eight years since brother uh caleb has been with us and um you know just the lord through this time he's been called to pastor amen a church there in tucson amazing grace tabernacle and i've had the opportunity to go out and just be in fellowship with them a couple times and we've always enjoyed the fellowship uh but uh but uh you know it just felt like the lord was just kind of keeping that home which i understand when i first started first 10 years i i went nowhere i went nowhere and uh but you know then as the lord just releases you you try to do what you can for the bride of christ uh but uh he's been having in his heart to come this way come this way come this way and we were not just able to get things sorted out and finally finally we got it worked out and on the very week that he was supposed to come the devil attacked his body and uh we were talking on the phone i'm like i don't know i might have to cancel his ticket and uh but uh but he called back and said brother jack i'll see you on thursday i'm feeling a lot better so god touched him and and he is here by the grace of god so uh amen amen so i i hope you all come tonight to pull on the word of god amen and uh i know that we're not um everybody you know that's typically your own stunt is not able to make it on services like this but that's okay i believe god got something special for each and every one of us amen i'm reminded of something that brother hugo said years ago he says you know if you had the opportunity to go to a meeting amen that brother branham was preaching or had the opportunity to have a one on one um interview with them which would you choose now see if your life ain't right you go to the meeting but if your life was right you know you're living up right before god you choose that one-on-one time with him that he could just maybe sit and share some of the secrets of your heart and just give you answers to questions that you might have uh that's what i feel like we have tonight god is coming this is gonna come in a small little group and just give us individual attention amen that we can just uh we can just rejoice in so i pray that the lord will use our brother amen in a very very special way so let's stand to our feet and let's welcome brother caleb duran a man from amazing grace tabernacle tucson arizona amen as he comes in his own special way tonight it is so easy to adore hallelujah lord i want to love you more say lord i want to love you more everybody with your hands lifted your eyes closed lord i want to love you more lord i want to love you more hallelujah than i ever had before so then i ever have before hallelujah oh you're so easy to adopt [Music] stick it one more time lord i want to love you more thank you jesus and then i ever had before oh you're so easy to adore lord i want to love you more keep your hands raised as a prayer we say lord i want to love you more hallelujah more than i ever had before hallelujah oh you're so easy to adore thank you jesus lord i want to love you more i like to sing yourself one time saying lord i want to love you more and more and [Music] and more than i ever have before my god you're so easy to adore [Music] lord i want to love you more and sometimes i like to speak in faith and i say lord i'm going to love you more you make that as a promise amen then i ever had before hallelujah you're so easy to adore lord i'm going to love you more let's give the lord a hand to praise and worship if you would amen amen amen hallelujah we can do better than that they don't got to be a lot of people we just got to praise them amen hallelujah i'm glad to be here are you glad to be here i'm glad to be here how about the rest of you i'm glad to be in the house of god amen amen amen amen so god bless you it's certainly good to be back in the house of the lord here it's spirit of truth tabernacle and it i guess i better hold on to it it uh it's been a while like you said about eight or nine years and and we were playing around earlier eight nine ten eleven twelve what the point is it's been too long and it got to that you can keep playing softly or i'll just start preaching without you but i i was saying that uh it got to the point where i thought i was never gonna come back here just not because i don't want to but just because of circumstances and so forth and i think brother jack you've been to tucson almost as many times i've been here maybe and then sister anne and my daughter my daughter's never been here sister anne has and she said to tell you all this is her home away from home and she misses you all in and uh so i told her that you know i said i'll tell him and then nadine says well tell them all i said hi and i said you don't know him she goes tell him i said hi anyway so my daughter says hi yeah and it's it's good to have brother jesse and his wife with me that's not something that happens usually it started off as a joke and then they showed up and i'm glad they're here and little winston and i call him winston the pooh when you get to see him you'll understand why but it's just good to see each and every one of you here and brother jack i couldn't help but get a little sentimental the faces have changed just a little bit you want things to stay the same and the same the fireballs the ones here are not here but god has raised up different fireballs amen amen it's all right you're not going to scare me by saying amen you you think things are always going to stay the same and then we were talking about earlier people have come and gone and and pastoring has been a has been it has been an adventure to say the least and i'll say this with all due respect anybody who wakes up one day says i think i'll be a pastor need to go see a psychiatrist or they can borrow my bible and my notes and brother smiley they can take my phone and i've had brothers say what do i need your phone for i said just give it a minute you'll see you can you can preach your first sermon and take my phone and you put up with all that nonsense and then come back and tell me if you still want to do it brother jesse's one of our preachers in the church and and he sees what i go through sometimes and i i tease him i turn around so you want to be a pastor and he goes no i'm all right you just go ahead you go see so one day he may be raised up to be one but i that's not the point the point is if you want to be one find another job there's better ways to make money brother green used to say there's got to be a better way to make a living right so in the meantime uh my my church uh greets you in the name of the lord jesus christ the amazing grace tabernacle tucson arizona and uh i didn't know that was gonna happen but at the end of an outreach that i started to do and uh for the lord the lord put on my heart actually he had put in my heart to start a church and and i ignored it anybody ever done that anybody ever ignored the lord thank you for being honest i appreciate that and then he told me to start a church and i decided i'd start an outreach that would pacify the lord you know but it didn't do the job and so then after a while when he put on my heart it's time to go i actually met with brother greene and talked to him about it and everything went smoothly smooth much more smooth than i thought it would and when we parted ways brother green told the church there and there's witnesses here at least one in the back there where he said he did not split the church he is an extension of us and don't anybody say that and then he went on and it's on tape i like saying that it's on tape he said he is the only brother that ever left this church and did it the right way so i i don't know he's had like 35 of them leave and so i thought i'm the only one who did it the right way [Music] well all right then and then he did something that surprised me when i us when i announced my resignation you know unofficially resignation whatever so i'd be leaving the next sunday would be my first service he said there's some of you here that are going to want to go with them and you have my permission and so instead of starting off with 20 i started off with 60 or 70. and it seems like every time i preach a funeral i pick up another five or ten right so it's not me it's god doing the work and um last december we had a brother come through and he preached a little at our anniversary meeting and and he said god is not through with tucson yet and we all said amen then he said god is not through with amazing grace tabernacle yet so we got excited and i think tonight i want to say god is not through with the bride of jesus christ amen we're right there we're right there so go on ahead get married have kids get jobs do what you got to do but live like he's coming any minute now amen amen do you love him with all your heart i'm glad you do it's good to be back home and it's good to see your faces so um i i don't know if this is the last trip here brother jack but i'll tell you what if i never come back to florida i'll see you in the morning because we're that close how many believes have with all your heart amen praise the lord so greetings to those online and and uh and uh let's let's just get right into it the lord will it so if you just play softly till i'm done reading if you don't mind sister rachel what's going on now you got married and you forgot how to where's brother steve at huh it's all your fault man she's all she can't wait to come sit with you see how she is just play the piano sis i'll dismiss you you know something special about sister rachel one time you remember the last one last time i was here i was speaking to her in the spirit and i you know when you're in the spirit how many brothers ever been in the spirit brother smile you don't talk about and the lord is using you and i'm trying to get her attention i couldn't remember her name for the life of me and i kept talking to her and she was ignoring it and i was staring at her i even called out her name i said sister rachel the lord is talking to you and she was just playing and playing and i sat back and looked at her and i said man that's not getting her attention and she didn't tell me to later on i finally turned around and said who else could say that god would visit them on their birthday and then she lost it because i didn't know it was her birthday they didn't tell me until afterwards god called her out and i said so what happened she goes i was sitting there and while the lord was using you to talk to me the devil was saying he's mistaken he's talking to somebody else it's not you it's not you and i said what a trick so finally birthday she goes that's me and she got her blessing so you remember that good i'm glad so don't leave until i tell you all right with all due respect my brother you too big to make upset all right do you love them with all your heart see i tell you if you've never seen me here before you can see i've been here before i just found out some of them are engaged some of them are not brother jack is like caleb brother caleb don't push it i i got to pay for this one first so we're gonna we're gonna see what we can do to help the cause of the lord amen man go ahead and get married go ahead and go ahead and get jobs but live like he's coming any minute now there's too much going on to ignore it don't ignore it don't ignore don't don't whistle through a graveyard act like you don't know you're surrounded by dead people come on come on i'm just getting warmed up you know how i do see i don't care if there's 20 30 or 40. this is all right with me we can get this on right we're just driving down the street next to a graveyard and somebody's in the car and she looked over and she said i wonder how many dead people are in there i said all of them i have a point to that don't walk around in a graveyard like you don't know everybody around you is dead in this world most people around you are dead amen but you are alive and you're well in christ jesus is that right you have the holy ghost is that right you have a light inside your heart that shines brighter than any light that this world could come up with or the sign could shine on don't act like you don't know who you are amen it's time to not only know who you are but recognize who you are and live who you are amen by god's grace amen philippians chapter 4 and then i'll dismiss you [Music] amen chapter 4 verse 8 very familiar you know it finally brethren whatsoever things whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest oh my whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things how many knows that verse really well you know it good we're going to talk about it father we ask that you add a blessing to the reading of your word bless your saints this evening father help me not to take too much time but only to live in your time and if that means we're here all night like an old-fashioned meeting that so being if that means we're here 30 minutes and so be it but lord have your way whatever you want to do get me out of the way as you've done so many times and for your honor for your glory let you be praised in everything that's said and done in jesus christ's name we pray for there is none greater amen amen god bless you may be seated you may be seated musicians thank you so much how many how many appreciates your musicians here amen amen amen so back home uh and and i always thought this would be kind of tacky and i always try not to do it and i said well i'm not going to be one of those preachers that comes you know as a pastor and says what i preach in my church is and uh you know because i was kind of thought man preached something that we ain't that no one else has ever heard you know but uh i i don't i don't i find myself in a very strange predicament because i can understand why the lord would want me to bring this wherever i go because this is the uh hour that we are being plagued with such um such atrocities as you are seen we are in the middle of uh what they call a pandemic we are not only in the middle of a pandemic but there are so many things uh that that you need to be careful what you read on the news and what you see on the news and you need to be careful what you're reading on the internet and if it's not good news and then then you know you can only read the same headline so many times just because they reward it doesn't mean it's different uh you know i don't know i can watch the news uh it's kold 13 back home and is that at 13 or cbs whatever it is uh that's one that i usually watch but they always every hour in the morning it's uh it starts at six and then seven eight nine and they have news i like to keep up on current events but i started to realize there was a certain theme any time that they that the new uh what do you call a reporter anchor or whatever it was come on they said the same thing late breaking news on this certain thing and it's late breaking to them because they were asleep the last hour right but they're saying the same thing that that chuck said and that lil said and that this one said but it's late breaking i said i've watched the same story four times it's not late breaking and but they say the word update and i pay attention so tonight i'm going to preach you an update all right i'm going to show it's the same thing you've always read but i'm going to show you an update now this is late breaking i want you to pay attention because this is the latest thing that's come out so far and what and what i'm getting excited about is that i was starting to read scripture and i told brother jack about another scripture that i'm going to read on tomorrow i said brother jack i'll be honest with you i've read the bible through a couple of times i'm not bragging but i've done it we do it at our church as a calendar it's on our calendar every day has got a certain scripture and you all do that yeah we read through it and if you're faithful you read through it the entire year and we're all reading it together and i got some of the folks that got their own little arrogant ways and they say oops i said it i'm not gonna take it back they got their own little arrogant ways and i'll say it if i was there and they'd like they do this certain thing like well i'm going to read the bible my own way with how i'm led i said that's not the point i didn't tell you not to read the bible the way you feel it i said read it with all of us and then do your own devotional on the side or vice versa i said at some point it's bound to happen all of us are going to read the same scripture at the same time and get in one mind and one accord i'm trying to set a stage to get something to happen here and it seems like people don't want you to set a stage they don't want you to create an atmosphere they don't want you to do anything that's going to get them any closer to the coming of the lord let me give you whoa i'm ready see we had brother bernie garcia he passed away and before he had passed away for some 20 odd years maybe 30 he'd made this prediction and he said before he said when the phoenix suns rise in the west and they win the championship he said the rapture will happen not too far after that's what he said so now this last uh when they call it finals what's it called the series or okay finals this last finals i'm not a basketball guy but this time i not only became a fan but i got a jersey too hey but i found out that people were telling brother bernie was telling other people he said you know they pray against us and people think i'm joking and they don't want it to happen and it never dawned on me why would anybody not want this to happen no it's not in the bible no it's not this or that but brother a lot of things that are prophesied are not directly there can you understand what i'm saying god shows you this is going to happen you won't get in that car accident the car accident is not in the bible but it doesn't change the fact that it's been prophesied and if the car accident has to happen before i go to the rapture then let the car accident happen i don't care because that's one thing that didn't that happened and now i can go on to the rapture you understand what i'm saying well they didn't win the championship no not the nation national championship but in order to get to that final round they had to win a championship and the suns did rise in the west i don't care if it sounds like i'm promoting a team like i said i'm not a basketball fan i don't care about kobe i don't care about colby and i don't care about lebron and i don't care about jordan they make money off of something that i didn't pay for and i don't care you know people are cheering for things that they they're not getting paid to advertise why are you wearing that jersey it don't matter to them right they lose one fan they got 10 million more who cares right they don't care about me but we know their stats and we know this and we know that and i'm like well what are the stats of saint paul how many times was paul beaten somebody tell me that how many stripes did paul and peter get how many knocks in the head that silas get you know all about jordan all about lebron but how many how many stripes did jesus christ take for your sins and for your healing come on somebody tell me how tall is michael jordan i don't know but how tall was brother branham right you want to talk about world series and how many bats and how many uh what they call it when they hit the ball and it goes all the way out home runs i want you to tell me how many how many home runs did brother branham have in the prayer line when he called somebody out and they were healed how many home runs did that profit have [Music] now let's get to the rookie card how many home runs have i had you know what come on brother jack how many home runs has brother jack had see you know all about i don't know baseball names griffin and whoever else i don't care but this time i paid attention and and brother jesse said now they didn't win the national champion he said but pastor he said they did win a championship and while people the western finals thank you and so people are like oh it didn't happen but i'm sitting there thinking but what if it just did you understand what i'm saying we're trying to get people to change the way they think you understand this is an update this is an upgrade i'm tired this is the same stuff that we've been reading and i told brother jack to me i've read the bible through and we have uh people you're supposed to be doing it together to get in one mind and one accord and i said to him i thought but it's something strange i read in scripture and it looks to me like i've never read it before ever happen to you was that ever even there or i'm not kidding did he just put that there when i wasn't looking because i don't remember it be the ink still looks wet to me all right i'm trying to show people something we've got to change the way we think we have been geared to look at updates we have been geared to look at your phone and brother if you're too busy on facebook and i'm not knocking what you do but if you're using social media for the wrong thing i want you to watch a program called social dilemma has anybody seen it it's from higher ups ceos telling the story of why you're so attached to your phone okay they learn your character yes they do and they know whether or not you've looked at it for a while and if you hadn't they send you an alert to get your attention and in in the in the in the show or the movie the documentary they have people on there like the fellow who invented the like button and he tells you how badly he regrets ever doing that he said if i don't know that that button would have would have appointed or led to so many suicides i would have never told them about it now you think about that for a minute but yet we let our kid we hand our kids the phone and look be honest the reason we give them a phone is because we really don't have time to pay attention because we're too busy looking at our phone be nice to hand them a bible because we're too busy reading our bible so here read one of your own amen i'ma let you sit on that a little bit let it marinate right so watch that and then you all go back and discover and you decide within yourselves whether or not you want social social media anymore that's just a free one okay as for me in my church if you're into my ministry i don't have it i've had deacons take it off i've had deacons pull it out of the house i've had deacon sit down i've had people in my in our church sit down discussing with their families and say we've watched this we've decided for our own we're not going to have any kind of social media whatsoever because it only leads to one thing and that's problems now you all might not have that issue here my brother so you do as you're led it's your church i understand but as for me and my house we're going to look at something else let me explain something to you when jesus christ comes back it's not going to be on facebook don't you think it's strange that the one of the things that we hear jesus say the most which is follow me follow me follow me is the one thing we hear all the time follow me on twitter follow me on instagram follow me on facebook everybody's saying follow me follow me follow me but the only one we should be following is the one who coined that phrase when jesus said tell all that you own and follow me come on somebody shout amen amen guys brother caleb you're all over the place you forgot what it's like to be an evangelist no i didn't that's why i'm doing it all right so we we went back and we started a little experiment and what had happened was i was sitting there and i i couldn't sleep one night you ever had that you're a pastor you sleep soundly every night don't you not not every night i don't sleep at all any night so what had happened was i got up and i said well what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna listen to a tape and i i just stumbled on the greatest battle ever fought so i put it on here look at that hum [Music] that's right that's right ooh ooh yeah ooh go back and listen to right so i listen to it and i'm listening and i hear uh brother branham say if there was he no if we all got the same mind same accord and so forth he goes there wouldn't be anybody here that wouldn't want healing that wouldn't get it and i listened i said what was that and i sat up and i kind of heard him say it again and i rewound it and i listen again and i thought to myself in my heart i promise you not out loud i said why not critical now but i said why isn't brother branham saying that and and pertaining to body change and rapture and resurrection but come on you know for the healing let's move on now i'm being respectful now and the lord speaks back to me in a voice not my heart in a voice and he says this because it wasn't time yet so i got depressed immediately put my head down i just got smacked by that pay attention boy shut up you know and i got sad about it but then out loud he said but now is the time all right so then i woke up and the very next morning was sunday and i got up what do you think i preached on greatest battle ever fought so what i did is i started an experiment and i asked my church if they would just faithfully do this for me with me if they would listen to the greatest battle ever fought every day for one every night for one month i said i don't care if you fall asleep because that teaches you to in a different way i said but i want you to get a a habit i want you to pray and if you fall asleep that's fine but you know if you hear it whatever but i want it to be played at least one time every day for a month brother jack i've got to tell you things began to change within our church right i'm glad i got a witness and then so we went on like that for so long that i went to a couple of churches in the phoenix area and and i told them what i did and three different churches in the phoenix area decided to do the same thing i said well we're coming towards the end of our month and the brother said oh you're not going to do it no more and i said well if you all are going to do it then i'll do it so we went on a second month and these churches jumped on it for an entire month and i started to get testimony back they said brother caleb it is changing the way our young people think it is changing the way our elders are thinking it is changing the way we worship the way we approach god and i said i wonder what that is it's not because i did something but it's the greatest battle ever thought and if you go back and you listen to that message word by word and dissect it and listen it begins to transform and rewire not your heart but your mind why because we have been taught by this world to fear everything especially in 2020 don't touch this don't eat this don't taste this don't they wanted a shield over your eyes a shield over your mouth gloves on your hands and if you didn't know anybody you're all walking around like this and no nobody know where they're going and if you sneeze for god's sake don't sneeze in a supermarket i sneeze and target and everybody did like this i had masks gloves and goggles and i sneezed because of the mask and everybody moved and i go i go to the house go on calm down oh you and then they're like you're profusely sweating because it's tucson i have gloves on and a mask [Applause] and they want to know why i'm sweating oh you're right i shouldn't be sweating because it's tucson it's 110 and i've got goggles on a mask on and gloves on two pair of gloves because they said one pair wasn't enough they're teaching us to fear everything they control this don't go here don't go there don't do this don't do that and if that wasn't enough they said don't even go to church because church is where everybody's getting it nobody got it in church not in our ranks anyway i found out people got it they got it in school when they were still open now we got a bunch of uneducated dummies because they didn't do their homework they sat at home for a year we got people that got lazy and fat and dumb because they didn't do what they were supposed to do and now they're behind their bills and what happened it was handed to you what happened we were being controlled we were being rewired but i'm glad that we have a god that saw that and said put it on my heart caleb have them listen to this while the rest of them are being rewired this way you'll be rewired this way stay in the word see it are you with me so far i read that scripture to point out this think on these things whatsoever be honest whatsoever be true whatsoever whatsoever but this is what we are this is how people are all right no one loves me come on don't act like nobody thinks that come on if i didn't go to church tomorrow brother jack wouldn't even care he don't need my little 20 a week that's how some come on now don't act like that now don't make me really get serious nobody needs me well if i died they'd just have the house and they wouldn't get my inheritance and that's all they want come on right if i died they just get another pastor look don't act like pastors are invincible we go through stuff too right we sit back and watch you all saying man to a preacher saying the very same thing i said last week i mean i mean i'm in your backyard now huh you know what just sitting back there man i said the same thing last week man and look at how they're getting all crazy you want to get up here and say i said that same thing last week what's the matter with y'all right we got problems too we

wife you got kids you got a little bit of money in the bank and if you didn't uncle sam gave you a bunch of it and you're not happy huh your happiness don't depend on your husband or your wife i want you to know that is that all right to meddle just a little bit your happiness does not depend on your husband or your wife your happiness depends on your affair with jesus christ if come on if you're not happy with jesus ain't nothing or nobody ever gonna make you happy i don't care if he's the most handsomest i don't care if she's the cutest brother steve and sister rachel i don't know why y'all sitting separately what happened did i cause a fight oh oh oh he's working well do your job brother's all right i just want to make sure i wasn't involved somehow you see i don't care what they look like i don't care how how well they cook i don't care what you're trying to find if you're trying to bury an unhappy state with a person it ain't going to happen you can have kids because that'll make me happy nope we can get some money because that'll make a whole that ain't going to make you happy that might make me happy that might make your pastor happy that might make your kids happy but it won't make you personally happy how many understands what i'm saying it's not going to make you happy what will make you happy is a good solid of uh uh uh uh excuse me uh relationship with the lord jesus christ come on somebody help me now that's the only thing that's going to ever make you happy you've got to be happy in christ christ brings you happiness and you have got to be settled in that state of mind but i'm not happy i've had people tell me i'm not happy in church and i'm like you're out of your mind well i used to enjoy singing but now i know well you don't no you used to enjoy singing but now you don't know because nobody claps when i sing that's what i feel like doing i don't do that but nobody claps but they all clap for her they all clap for him i'm like are you

visiting just passing through i hope you're passing through come on right i'm not happy that's your problem not mine so don't come in the church with i'm not happy trying to make everybody else unhappy because you're not happy right i am happy i'm happy one because i was a sinner but now i'm saved by grace i'm happy too because i found jesus christ i'm happy three because all my sins are under the blood i'm happy for because he not only gave me the holy ghost but he adopted me and placed me and put me in position i'm happy five because my church is following right behind me i'm happy because god has made me happy are you happy in christ and say amen hallelujah i'm depressed are you i'm depressed but you said it not me you said it you see married couples i'm depressed kids come in and i'm depressed you're nine bro what are you depressed about what's the matter your switch don't work huh you look mario kart's not working why are you looking around like you don't know what mario kart is i see you huh or you don't have a mario kart so now you're depressed look mommy and daddy didn't give me everything i wanted and that was a good thing if i wanted something they had to go out and pull weeds right brother am i wrong you didn't pull enough weeds you didn't get what you asked for that's it well i'll try again tomorrow no the deal was you pulled them all today you didn't you're not getting it and that was our childhood wasn't that yours that wasn't yours some like it all right don't make me talk about chocolates why not who knows what a chon clay is look black people know what chunks are i don't know what you call them but do they work the same my mom's like a boomerang it whooped you and it came back how many loves the lord i'm not i'm not here to make i'm not a comedian but i'm trying to lighten you up just a little bit i'm depressed you're depressed because you chose to be depressed you made the decision i don't care what you think you made the decision to be depressed you woke up one morning and you subconsciously or consciously decided i'm going to be depressed and i'm going to depress how many people i can get with me i'm going to be depressed because i want to i'm dealing with a situation like that right now not me personally but people in the church depression will leave you it will lead you to hate depression will lead you to jealousy depression will lead you to envy depression will lead you to bitterness depression will do that to you it'll become a cancer in you and if you're not careful it'll cause to cause it to be a cancer among the church then suddenly you've got a flock full of people that are depressed but you're not born to be depressed god didn't save you to be depressed god didn't get you to be oppressed god raised you up to be more than a conqueror through christ jesus who gives you strength hallelujah come on somebody say a man i'm depressed people come in my office they say i'm depressed i tell them i can fix that habit for you in two ways how i say which one you want the right or the left i've heard brother green use it and i saw how it worked they smile at him like what don't smile at me i'll get up and slap you right now do you want to get that depression thing out of you and pray for your slappy which way do you want it it's nothing but a state of mind that you have accepted [Music] i'm ugly i'm ugly well who said you were ugly i know i am well you know sometimes we just can't help ugly now can't we but i've known some ugly people that were very beautiful you couldn't tell they were ugly because the inside of them was shining so bright that you didn't matt man i know this beautiful girl what is she like don't worry about that i'm gonna show you and you can tell the brothers like oh come on man but he gets to know the girl and all of a sudden you find out you know what she's a really good i said i told you she's beautiful man well i'd say he's a really handsome guy big old guy coming there he's like what i said just talk to him you'll understand what i'm saying ugly doesn't mean that you're ugly you think you're ugly you think you're you look in the mirror and you see something that other people don't see but see i like this because when god looks at me he sees something that other people don't see this might seem like abc's but i'm just getting started so just give me a minute uh i like this in arguments for argument's sake whenever something bad happens i'm innocent i'm the victim here now that's not true and most of us know it we need to own what we do to cause problems with each other it's a whole lot easier uh meemaw i learned it's a whole lot easier to apologize for something even though i didn't do it it's a it's easier just to say look i'm sorry for my part i'm sorry for the misunderstanding can we just move on because if you don't they're going to stop keep with the blame game blame game you know what you're right i'm the pastor i should know better i shouldn't have said it like that i should and i back up so that they'll lean forward just a little bit then i'll hug him and i said are we done with his nonsense yet and we move on right brother jesse knows he's seen me do it i've had ministers in the in my church at the office while i'm dealing with certain things and when these people walk out these people when the individuals walk out the preachers look at me like why you just throw them out and i said because i can't and uh my assistant pastor says that's why you're the pastor and i'm not because i told them where to go i said that's right that is why we are what we are because jesus is not interested in kicking people out jesus is interested in who to bring into the kingdom not throw them out see our little vendettas get in the way and we start to look for how to get rid of certain people so maybe you can play the organ or you can play the piano or you can do something up here see brother jack don't know it yet but i'm the talent in this church and if you only give me a chance out loud sing out play out preach everybody if that's your attitude then you ain't got no business behind this holy desk and don't you worry you're not gonna get your chance because preachers can see that a mile away pastors can see that a mile away now i'm meddling i can feel it i'm on somebody's toes enough's enough we've got to stop thinking that everything is about us well you see because it is and it isn't it's about you if you're going to follow in the line with jesus christ but it's not about you if you're going to cause trouble right i'm sorry i didn't realize that the amazing grace tabernacle revolved around you brother sister how can i help you make it an easier time for you don't you ever feel like just getting smug like that bro you got my blessing sir he turned around so i'm sorry i didn't realize that spirit and truth was raised around just your little whatever it is you got i'm just gonna listen i'll tell you what tell me how to do it because i've been here so long i don't know how wow i don't know what you got going on here jack but i'm about to find out amen somebody amen i'm pathetic i'm poor i'll never have anything well i don't understand that look how it says i am poor i am pathetic you know there was this i am movement going around on youtube and they were saying things like i am holy spirit now there are some aspects to that that i believe and understand but then when they got to saying i am god we need to be careful because we are as gods we are sons and daughters of god that makes us a god but we're not the god how many understands that it gets a little confusing but that is the way it is you are a god in the sense of this you create your own atmosphere you can be a god you can and if you're gonna go around saying i am pathetic and i have nothing and i am poor and i'll never be anything and i am nothing guess what you are you're going to be you're going to become what you say you are but i'm going to say i am rich because my father is rich my father owns the cat on a thousand hills the golden amount in the mountains of silver mines too and i am heir to the father heir to the throne i am in the throne of god i'm not on the side i'm not in front of my back i'm in the throne of jesus christ hallelujah how many understands what i'm getting at i am depressed no you're not quit saying it i i i i'm pathetic that's one of my favorites i'm pathetic why do you say a thing like that why do you say you'll never have anything you know i started off with nothing but god gave me everything i had a little building on broadway and the lord blessed it then we ended up with the church we have now and then when i was in the when i first moved there there was a a a back house that we wanted to use as a fellowship hall and i stood there and i looked out at it and i said i need that building and the brother said how are you going to get it we barely got this i said but we did get it so i need that building so i said lord i need that building and it turned out there was somebody living there and uh and uh well he ended up not being very nice but we offered him 1500 to move on out and he didn't have much so 1500 bucks was a lot of money to him so he took that 1500 he left and i got my fellowship all right and just to make it look nice and pretty what we did was we invited him back and baptized him he became a member of the church and he is now a good brother and he didn't like us when we drove up the first time [Music] i was selling my house and nobody was buying it it was on the market for almost two years yeah ouch ouch ouch and i was preparing to move in the fellowship hall because we're about to have to give it up and didn't have this and didn't have that and suddenly somebody bought the house next door well i wanted that house but i couldn't afford to do the renovations nor buy it but somebody bought it and renovated it and i was gonna move into the fellowship hall when i walked out i'm walking out the lord said to me he said caleb you're never gonna have to live there i said well where am i gonna live then and he turned my head this way so i called the real estate agent the very next day and i told the real estate agent i said i needed owner kerry so i'm not doing it i said i need it. but see what happened was before i called them i talked to my uh one of my mortgage lenders over there called and i said i need that house so he made the call turns out the guy was his best friend i didn't know that turns out that his secretary was sister to one of the real estate agents in my church i didn't know that yet come on right and i was like and so both of them said you need to sell it to this pastor and he says no i don't so anyway he gets me on the phone i talked he said well i'm not going to do it i said well fine don't do it we end up talking and talking and talking and talking after a little bit he says well caleb how much can you give me down i said well how much do you need he said this much i said done give me two weeks i didn't have any of that money none of it brother jack i don't know why i'm going down this road but i hope it's all right i hope it's all right i didn't have any of that money but i promised this guy in two weeks that i'm gonna make a fool out of myself basically right so the next day i'm driving to the church that we're fixing it up and uh uh that's a true story i don't know why it's here but here it is and i'm in my truck and i'm i press the gas to go and all of a sudden my truck just stops and i mean it jerk my seatbelt got tight and everything and i was like what happened i thinking to myself in a split second so many things run through your mind oh great my transmission went out i don't even have money for this now i gotta fix the truck and when all that process this car went and i stopped and looked and realized what it just happened and i listened my engine is still revving i look down my foot is still on the gas i didn't stop that truck it suddenly went into gear and i just drove like this and i went off to the side the guy in front of me had his look in his face like what in the world did i just see and i wanted to get him and say what what happened i know he's gonna tell me an angel came and stopped your truck and he was gone i know he would but i was too busy crying and i i had a counseling set up and and we were gonna do some remodeling i cast all of it i went back home i stayed up to about three o'clock in the morning i finally said okay i need to talk to you you went way out of your way to tell me that you're aware of me you stop that truck and i want to know why and he begins to talk and he begins to share things with me and i say okay if you're with he said i stopped that truck so you would understand like that truck your ministry you have nothing to do with your ministry i do what i do i make you do i i i say well then lord why hasn't my house sold 10 30 that same morning it sold just like that can i go on can i go on can i go all right i still don't have the money for my house and i'm driving down the street and i and the lord tells me in my heart it says say out loud which you have need of i said i did already i know don't get mad look up moses man moses had a funny way of talking with him too i'm not saying it's okay so don't talk to god that way because you might not get away with it i guess i'm special i don't know he said say it anyway so i said out loud i need x amount of dollars there you happy i know i know the same god who saved me in the truck accident could have just smashed me like a bug right then and there but he didn't i went to the church and me and the some of the brothers are doing some work and i get a text message text message is from a family in the church and they said brother caleb we've got x amount of stock we've sold it we have x amount of dollars and i'm not making this stuff up i hope you understand that and they said we failed to give you the ties off of it all of it and i text back i said i'm not that guy you're not going to do that you just hold on to it and and i'll just as we have need of we'll ask you and so forth and my one of the brothers there was my cousin he could tell i was disturbed and he came along and he said brother he said cuz come here man because what's bothering you i said i didn't tell him how much because i'm not going to ever say how much i said this this this and this and he goes you just got through saying that people don't do that anymore that people don't believe in ministry like that no more that god doesn't move now you have somebody offering you something you need and you're saying no and i said i need a vindication so i went and i prayed and i said lord in the next 45 minutes i need it to rain that's all i said now i know rain in florida is like you know every day but in tucson it ain't like that thank you brother and so 45 minutes to the dot it began to rain was it predicted and it rained for 45 minutes so then i texted brother and i said to the family and i said i'll accept your offer thank you and he said did it rain over there and i said why and he said because we got together as a family we said lord in order for him to believe this let it rain wherever he is [Applause] we've got to change the way we think so now so now let me just give you the rest of it it was twice the amount of money that i asked for twice and i had the money for the down payment and i'm still living in that house today don't tell me that god can't do it come on somebody's saying man i know it sounds like i'm a prosperity preacher but i'm not see the problem is is the bride is already prosperous through jesus christ she can have what she speaks not what she asks for but what she speaks she can have what she speaks she can have what she speaks can you say amen all she has to do is say i need this i hate this i got that and the lord will give you what you asked for what you speak what you claim what you say by faith it's yours in the name of jesus christ hallelujah do you believe it so no wonder god bless you may be seated no wonder no wonder the bride if she says she's ugly she can be ugly no wonder if the bride says she's depressed she can be depressed listen i'm not saying it's ordained of god but it's your words that is bringing it about and if you can bring depression on yourself why not bring the anti-depression if you can speak ugly in yourself why not speak beautiful on yourself if you can speak poor on yourself or or broke down and nothing why not bring or speak something and riches and and wealth in your life if you can say that god don't know you then why don't you say god knows my name if you say that no one loves me then why don't you say god loves me god knows me god adores me and i love him too come on somebody say amen if you can say you're not happy then why not say every day i'm happy every day i've got the joy of the lord is my heart and the joy of the lord is my strength every day every day hallelujah it's time we start talking foolish bride talk and start talking wise bride talk it's time we stop talking defeated and start talking overcomer i'm more than a conqueror through christ jesus who gives me strength i'm more not just a conqueror i'm more than a conqueror more than i am more than a conqueror hallelujah can you say amen i haven't even got to the quotes yet said all right proverbs 23 verse 6 and 7. you're going to put it up or do i is that what that is yes okay proverbs 23 first six and seven i used to say i needed my old man glasses now i don't say it anymore because i don't want them anymore think about it we got to quit saying things like we're getting old brother jack i said it to you today brother jack you're getting old i didn't mean that brother brother jackie you're getting younger you're getting younger why are y'all saying man say man when i say that help the brother out man you all are wrong for that brother jack you're getting younger amen let me try that again brother jackie you're getting younger [Applause] better come on down to tucson man we'll encourage you it's all right he's with me i'm all right proverbs 23 6-7 says eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye in other words if it looks good don't partake in it neither desire thou his day to me it's in other words if it sounds good don't believe it come on for as he thinketh in his heart so is he as he thinks in his heart yeah as he thinks in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with you thank you that's it so the problem we had we started to do this every night and i started to tell the folks don't say negative things don't believe negative things don't tell each other negative things if you have to you might feel silly but look in the mirror and say you are beautiful you're more than a conqueror you are god's child you are his beloved he knows you he'll give you what you ask for start to tell yourself even if you laugh see say it anyway till it becomes so much of your makeup that you don't gotta say it anymore it's in your presentation you walk into a room and already they know you're more than a conqueror my brother said he went down to target he said i didn't even have a tie on he said i was between services i was walking down he said it must have been the anointing from the service or something he said but every employee was how can i help you do you need help finding something where is it what is it i go it is the anointing it's god the holy ghost overshadowing you and they recognize there is something different about this individual well what happened your mindset has changed now look this might sound like it's abc's but i want to ask you then why haven't we been doing it don't don't come at me like well that's the greatest battle i ever fought yeah but what do you know about greatest battle ever fought you know that's the name of a powerful sermon but have you heard it lately i mean lately like in the last two days oh it got quiet i heard it just this morning i heard it last night i heard it on the way down to west palm beach i can quote it would you like me to because i got it right here this is what i did i printed it out in big letters on big pages because i didn't want to wait for vog to send me a book so i printed it out that might be against the rules but i don't care it should be okay if you would think that wouldn't you let's just say praise the lord i'm gonna read you i'm gonna read you some bold print you know what i'm talking about i'm just going to read the bold print but i printed out the whole thing and what i did was is i took i don't know how many services it was brother but it went on for a little bit every service consecutively just preaching out of this i only used a few scriptures and i didn't i didn't get all uh you know uh what do you call it on tangents i just stayed right with it page after page line after line and after a little while you could tell people like man at first i think he got on their nerves but after a while like hey this is good stuff i said you need to listen to this because it's doing something to you i want you to listen to a couple of these things that'd be all right with you i want to make a statement that he tells you first of all he says it starts here and i had a little matter of fact i got it but maybe i'll do it tomorrow a powerpoint and i showed how the body works and the mind and everything and it says as a man thinketh in his heart because we know that the decision to be saved is in here right and brother brennan says it starts here in in the greatest battle he said then it moves up here he says you you choose god here but you make the decision here and then it goes back down to your heart and from here it goes everywhere oh so here's something interesting you need your mind to cooperate with your heart so just to just to get you all to calm down and people to relax and whoever's watching it's the heart hopefully and most likely is not the problem with the believer all right we've all been in this room i believe we've all been saved we've all accepted the lord jesus christ in our heart right the troubles not with your heart brothers sisters the trouble is in your mind when it goes up here it somehow gets in a gets in a fight here now brother branham doesn't say it like this because he says constantly it's in the mind but if you if you're if brother jack feels led to and you all decide to do what we did just to try it out as an experiment you'll hear after a while that he begins to elude that it's not just here but between the mind and the heart the trouble is the heart is fighting with the mind the heart knows what to do but the mind thinks it knows better all right because the mind was taught to out-think the heart how much time do i have because cause on my watch it's 6 30. say it again brother i'm gonna do it who is this little whippersnap get up here and preach boy no no don't move he was going to come up he'll come up wouldn't he god bless your heart look at this your heart knows what to do but your mind thinks he knows better now here's something i'm going to say out here that just kind of food for thought i wonder if we were ever supposed to talk just just think about that the angels the seraphims they don't talk they only open their mouth to praise they don't sass the lord they don't turn around saying we're going to change the tomb we've been singing holy holy for eons of time and i'm getting tired of this song here so you got to write something else he's god tell them to create a note they don't do nothing like that do they no they keep singing holy holy is the lord our god almighty holy holy is the lord and i wonder if men were ever supposed to talk now i know it sounds silly but when they and you might laugh you're going to laugh because i laughed when i thought about it when they say that they saw it when people say they see aliens they always say the same thing their brains were kind of big their mouths were really tiny and they never said a word and somehow they were communicating with each other now no okay that's all right but let's go back to the animal world you can watch a pride of lions run after a herd of of of wildebeest and it seems like it's chaotic but they all got their mind on that one no no that was too skinny the fat one no that was too big no i'm not the one that's kind of there that's the one the horns like this yeah that one and they're all look like they're doing something different but they're all working towards the same goal to get that poor unsuspect while he's suspecting now he's he's it you know that will be like man i know it's me they're coming after me i know it's me i know it is oh god it is right he then he knows and he's like you don't want me i drink coffee all the time you don't want me i don't eat you know i eat nothing but vegetables you don't want me but they all know it's that one and i'm just going to ask you we all say it's instinct is it i'm just asking a question brother i'm not trying to introduce some crazy thing but is it your dogs look at you like they understand you do they your babies can understand every word you say did you know this two weeks out of the womb they just lack the capacity to answer you back so it makes me wonder were we ever supposed to talk at all can you imagine being told when you're a little boy or a little girl no not don't use words that's rude think what you want i'll bring it don't cry like that i'll bring you a bottle answer me right and the baby goes and mommy comes over the bottom now i know you're laughing but if if that was the case and then what would our mouths be used for to do one thing and one thing only praise god there'd be now you wouldn't feel so bad when you're praising god knowing you just cussed out the pastor two days ago or or yelling at your wife or your or your husband come on come on come on calling your kid some name you shouldn't have or whatever it is or in the schoolyard cousin and then you come in you're talking about amazing grace you wouldn't feel bad because you'd never use your mouth for something it wasn't intended for it's just an idea just an idea just an idea you'd only use your mouth to speak the word and have no trouble because your mouth never spoke anything else our faith is all messed up because we're trying to do something when all we had to do is ignore the mind and let the heart do all the talking for us is that all right just food for thought and i know everybody's gonna go crazy brother caleb went to brother jackie's and he's saying we ain't gotta talk no more cell phones are getting back to that what's texting you're not talking just just think about it they're trying to carbon copy or try to make a cheap copy of what we are really supposed to be now i need to move on because i know we got we do have a time chris strain i think uh he says in that thought then if that great heavenly host he said has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the heavenly host right when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of god is upset and when one member listen when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit he said when one member gets out of order just one he said throws a whole thing out of allicator look as i would to god this morning that that we would bring this to a real healing service he said that we could keep this part group that we have gathered under the roof this morning i'll say this evening in such harmony that the holy spirit would place every member of the body that's here this morning in such harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our positions see instead of being worried about who's going to do who's going to say or who's going to read or who's going to sing how about just get in your position and if you're called upon you're called upon now no that's now that's rather petty when you think about the grand scheme of things what we're asked to do in church versus what we're asked to do in the in the body of christ is very petty we we make such an important things on little positions that we have created or we think or intelligently try to figure out what god was trying to do what he's really trying to do is just get us into position to do our heavenly duty how many understand what i'm saying i'm not making light of church duties i'm trying to make you understand something if all we're focused on is what we're going to do in church then i i worry about you because we should be focused on what we're going to do in glory in heaven or in the body of christ you may never have a job here in spirit and truth but your job may be to win people over to jesus christ and bring them here oh i see don't nobody want to be the witness i've had people want to preach but they don't want to go and win nobody they just want to preach to people who are won already i'm just saying that job's been filled go get some more bring them in somebody catch the fish i'll clean them up god will use them don't you worry but they want to be heard so you see the problem with talking too much i'm going to go on i'm going to go on all right now as i said this morning only two powers this is in paragraph 52. there's only two powers about halfway down and there's only two kingdoms listen to this two powers and two kingdoms all the rest the little i love it the little minor things getting caught up in who is president is a minor sadly they assassinated the president of haiti but that's also minor whatever china is doing is minor we're looking at the news and we're getting caught up in what they're showing us and not seeing what's going on behind the scenes when the reality is it ain't about the the virus or about the mask they're trying to figure out a way to shut you up to not have a voice you see what i'm saying about talking the government's trying to get you in a place where you don't have a voice the lord is trying to get you to a place where you have the voice come on come on follow me close because it gets a little deep two kingdoms all the rest minor things are connected with either one of these powers and those powers is god's power and satan's power that's what every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by god's power or satan's power and this is my favorite part because that's the only two powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of death now that's the only two powers watch i wrote in there negativity does not reflect god's power all right if it's negative it's not god's power it's satan's power so if you're if you're preaching these negative things to yourself or to your family or to any church you go to you're preaching satan's sermon not god's sermon i now i've started to tell people you're preaching satan's language i don't i don't say amen to that i can't hear that stuff that messes me up and satan can only paragraph 53 can only his power got is the perverted power of god watch this five words it isn't no real power i want everybody to say it isn't no real power now then why are you afraid of satan then brother branham said it isn't no real power whose power the devil's that coronavirus it isn't no real power cancer depression uh diabetes oppression whatever it is it isn't no real power [Music] death it isn't no real power come on somebody better praise god for that come on [Applause] it's a perversion of god's power everything that satan has everything he has the line before him is a perversion of god's power can i go on all right we'll skip around a little bit i wrote down satan is negative god is a positive all right so we say today we're sitting here at paragraph 54 we are here today sitting here sitting here and one or the other power is going to control us brother smiley you know that one don't you one or the other is going to control us so let's cast down the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens now look look at this i don't understand how to make this more clear if god isn't controlling you there is no in between if god is not controlling you there is no in between i want everybody to say it if god is not controlling you there is no in between if god is not controlling you satan is come on somebody say it nice and loud if god is not controlling me if god is not controlling me satan is all right we can close i'm not kidding i'm just kidding i'm not going to close y'all didn't even believe me did you gotta get a few more minutes you're going to get in trouble with the pastor you see that it's nothing but negativity and if god's not controlling your life then satan is now i know that as lukewarm believers want to think that we're still half in and half out but there ain't no half in or half out either god has got all of you or none of you god doesn't have the left foot and is waiting for the right foot god doesn't got the left hand or waiting for the right hand listen in the olympics if you watched if you watched any of them run when the when the runner was running his whole body was involved he wasn't his body was not lukewarm to the race come on somebody the body didn't say on your mark get set go and away the feet went and the rest of it said let me know how it turns out huh that would be some kind of funny race you see what i'm saying the whole body is engaged the hands are moving the nostrils are flared up open the chest is heaving they're taking an air they're letting out here the hips are moving the thighs are moving and everything else is saying man just hold on we just got 400 more feet just hold on just hold on and i'm telling the bride of christ tonight get engaged hold on hold on hold on hold on come on [Applause] get engaged i'm going to have to slow down here and close till tomorrow but listen to this i can't find it here let me see if i can find it you know you should know these quotes by now we've been in this so many years here's one in uh paragraph 68 the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made in the mind the head now they never started from some organization they didn't start that fight there see they never started from some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore the organization can never never do the work of god because the battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in your mind it's not in drugs it's not an alcohol it's not in extramarital affairs it's not in money it's not in politics it's in your mind but look we've made it about corona we've made it about mask we've made it about church affairs we've made it about drugs and we my enemy i just can't get over heroin yes you can you don't need it yes i do no you don't yes i do no you don't your mind has made you think you do but you don't need it oh yeah we always talk about the big stuff what about blood pressure pills that's a drug too huh what about a a prescribed a drug they got me on now for uh for indigestion i gotta have this because nothing else works look i'm preaching to the choir now those aren't narcotics brother caleb no they're not but they're still drugs and if i stop taking the day my body goes i need that and i'm sitting there going now how do i convince this body of mine no you don't it's in your mind they're prescribing gabapentin by the loads because it calms the nerves that tell me how is that any different than smoking a cigarette i smoke brother caleb because it calms my nerves no it doesn't jesus calms your nerves but your mind is telling you you've got to light that thing up oh it's not the same thing it's medical marijuana you must be dumb did you bump your head on the way into church or something do you realize that the thc levels in this marijuana is not the thc levels in grandpa's weed the stuff we bought i don't know if you ever smoke weed but i did i'll just be honest the stuff we bought on the corner is not the same stuff they're selling today you're talking 12 thc versus 85 thc they're turning people into insane animals and they're so addicted oh nobody gets addicted to weed you're right they don't you're addicted to the thc and you think that you need it but the reality is your mind made you think that but you don't need it i don't know who that's for but that's on somebody online that's the word is right there i don't know why i'm even talking like this but i'll tell you what the spirit of god is pulling and you all are too somebody needs to hear this today you need to get this stuff out of your mind it's time to change our way of thinking i'm telling you try this try this experiment [Music] decisions and chat and verse uh that verse paragraph 70. decisions are made in the mind with the with the mind the mind the head there's where satan meets you the decisions are because that god made a man that way see can we go on just give me a few more minutes here oh i like this paragraph 74 but the spirit it has only one sense the spirit oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sin is either dominates it's either faith or doubt now there's another one right you're either god's power or satan's power now you're either faith or you doubt there ain't no in between do you believe brother what kind of no sister do you believe god can heal you sort of well i'm trying to no no no no i need you to believe or don't believe see faith or doubt that's exactly there's only one avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept faith either one you want to work on oh i like that because in other words if you doubt you've got to work on that doubt if you have faith you got to work on that faith but if you're doubting you've got to work on that you've got to build your doubt can you imagine the irony of it can you listen it makes sense if you have to build your faith then you've got to build your doubt if your little doubt is as a faith of a cauliflower seed because i don't like cauliflower right then you can doubt that this mountain will move and it never will i've never said that before and i kind of like it huh you can doubt that god will heal you of cancer and he never will you can doubt that you are saved and you won't be you can doubt you've got the holy ghost and you can just forget coming to church but if you have faith as a mustard seed you could say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea and it shall be done and nothing i said nothing shall be impossible unto you who believes do you believe say amen [Applause] [Music] if this church right now can be put together and end together in such a way that every person would want to would be in one accord with not one shadow of doubt anywhere there would be not a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed this is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will or not it's not christian science brother brandon goes on to say he said it's not mind over matter he said it's just a matter of fixing your way of thinking let me finish up with this jeremiah 29 11. come on somebody say hey man i've got a lot more but i don't i don't have four meetings there's just enough that'll be enough for now how many loves them jeremiah 29 11. for i know so you have your thoughts you have your thoughts you've got your ideas brother smiley i feel led to speak to you right now it might look a certain way it might be a certain way and the devil's messing with your mind brother but i want to remind you that god said for i know the thoughts i have towards you everybody point your brother smiling and say towards you towards you you got that i know the thoughts i have towards you they're thoughts of say the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end how many accepts that can you say amen give me give me isaiah 55 8. i know familiar stuff but it's all right time to change the way you think time to rewire your way of thinking it's time to get reprogrammed that's why i said i got an update for you huh i heard a brother say i don't like these updated quotes and updated versions i'm like well then you ain't never had one you're still running on dial up you're still running on dial up i'm running on wireless get it wireless huh all right come on i don't know how they didn't get that you got it oh you got it all right isaiah 5 8 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts hold on a minute god hates me god don't love me god wants me to suffer i i beg to differ my thoughts my thoughts are not your thoughts he's not doing something to hurt you on the contrary you're building your doubt to hurt yourself but i for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord it may not seem like god knows what he's doing but god knows what he's doing it's time to rewire your thinking and if you go on and do this message brother branham coin's a phrase that's very popular in our church now but he says this he goes see what happened is this individual stopped just for a minute he talked about that uh he talked about a a friend of his that had been baptized and cleaned up her life and then one day she'd come banging on the door and brother bill brother bill brother bill and he let's rain what happened you have a heart attack or something said no he said then i'd like this he said i put on my robe open the door i said come on in sis come on insist well if i if any of us ever get heard of letting a sister in our house who wasn't married we'd get nailed to a cross brother jack but the prophet of god got no problem getting away with it you know what because our thoughts are somewhere else in the gutter pastors have to see people and do things that people don't understand but they want to criticize us for it but i want to ask you if you don't want me to do anything which one of you is going to go and do it i just thought i would drop that on him for a little bit all right we need to do things we need to pray for certain people anyway he lets her in the room and at the living room there and his drunk buddy was sitting there and he covered him up and said what happened she said oh i don't i didn't mean it i didn't mean it oh i i didn't i didn't say what happened what happened she said well i went by the old hangout place and some of the gang was there and they were playing music and i thought i would just i would just go and listen for him and i would just stop for a minute he said you see what happened she stopped for a minute and then he turns around and says that's what the the the prophet said to heza he said i want you to take my staff and i want you to go that way if somebody salute you don't you shoot them back if someone in other words if they say hello don't you say hello if they ask how you're doing don't say nothing if they say hey can i borrow a dollar i want to give an offering because they don't you stop for nothing you just keep going don't you stop for nothing and in my church we have a phrase there now and what we tell each other is whatever happens don't you stop for nothing you press on towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus what is it it's time to rewire your way of thinking stop using your own thoughts i say it like this back home i hope it's right stop using your own thoughts kids let's get in the mind of christ i want to think like he thinks i want to talk like he talks i want to walk the way he walks brother branham says in another place he said if you'll let the holy ghost in he'll do your walking for you and i thought you know how many places he'd have kept me out of he said he'll do you're talking for you you know how many things i would have never said and he said he'll even do your thinking for you and your thoughts if it's not important if it's not important then i want you to answer him riddle me this why did the angel lord tell brother branham tell the people to be careful how they think if it wasn't such a problem if it wasn't something to hinder your faith or hinder the move of god then why did he tell him tell the people to be careful how they think because their thoughts are louder in heaven than their words are on earth do you see how important it is to let your own thoughts escape and let the thoughts of god come in your minds musicians can i have you come let's give the lord a hand to pray [Applause] do you love him with all your heart i hope that wasn't too much or too little i think it's important brother jack we're we're in a place in life right now where we just can't afford to fool around with it anymore we've walked this trail and circled this mountain long enough and it's time to turn northward and go up to heaven he's waiting on us to get ready the bible said the bride is greater self-ready then another place that says his wife is now ready made herself that way what is it we got to get our thinking out of the way and i'll tell you all it is is watching the news is this me i don't know how that even happened all i did was put it in my pocket see what i mean they'll figure out a way to get you that's a bad phone right there i was looking at you guys what are you doing believe it or not but it's true you heard what she said believe it or not but it's true something about an elliptical that's all right the devil didn't do nothing he just tried it but it didn't work he didn't take away from nothing see if he had the wrong thoughts that have bothered you but god knows all things let's play that song again lord i want to love you more let's buy our heads for more would you stand heavenly father thank you lord for this hour that you've given us or so to speak on your truths and in your word father i pray that justice was done and the things that you wanted to say and i remember i remember happily the way you used the gift in my life that you put there and i just let it flow lord because that's what you always did but i could see lord that it was touching certain situations in certain lives and i'm not looking for some kind of recognition or glory because you receive all the glory and everything that you do but at the end of the day at the end of the day i want to think like you and i want to talk like you and i want to walk like you i want to do everything just like you so father would you bless your people tonight would you bless those that are watching around the world or in the in the country wherever it is whoever may watch this later on this week would you give them peace of mind and i mean that literally that it's just the devil telling them they're not going to make it it's just the devil telling them they're not good enough it's just the devil telling them that you don't know them because my bible here says you're aware of everything that i do and everything that i've gone through and i know your word to be true when the prophet said don't you stop for nothing help your people tonight we pray lord as the pastor comes be with us we ask and anoint us in a very special way to gay to engage in this battle that you have placed us in to put on the whole armor of god and be ready for what lies ahead in jesus christ's name lord i want to love you more [Music] oh than i ever have before [Music] you're so easy to adore [Music] love you more sing with all your heart tonight oh lord i want to love you more [Music] than i ever have before [Music] oh yes for you so easy [Music] let's take it one more time with all about i ever had before [Music] you're so easy to adore [Music] oh lord i want to love you

sitting there listening to just him just just go through philippians 4 8 and reminded just of a couple weeks ago you all know that we we came to the end of our study in ephesians chapter 3 and ephesians 3 and um when i taught this a few weeks ago i went to philippians 4 8 and uh and just brought that and now he comes and just kind of focuses on philippians 4 8 but i want to go back and just read ephesians 3 20 for you that's okay now unto him that is able is he able know he's a because paul told us that he's able now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask and tonight that brother caleb just got to tell him just you know just speak it just let it out your mouth to speak it just speak it just speak it and you know i just begin to let it all fly right i

power that worketh in us i am i'm i'm strengthened amen i'm encouraged i'm strengthened and brother caleb said i know this is simple now brother that was right just what the doctor ordered and that's what we needed tonight and you know i'm just i'll tell you i i'm looking forward to tomorrow amen i'm looking forward to the morning and and um i knew he was the right man at the right time and god sent him here for a purpose amen and i believe part of that started tonight and there's more to come there's more to come let's have a word of prayer father we just appreciate your servant getting himself out of the way and allowing you to use them to speak to us we are convinced spirit of god was here tonight speaking to every one of our needs and thank you for lord your your the scriptures

out of isaiah 55 for us your thoughts my thoughts are not like your thoughts and neither your ways like my ways but god we pray that you help us to align ourselves with your thoughts align ourselves with your ways and to realize oh god that you are in control and lord um um nothing there's nothing nothing nothing lord that we're facing nothing that we will face that we cannot overcome because you're the greater one and you're on the inside and you're working all things out for our good lord help us to receive don't don't don't don't let it just be another message god that just kind of comes and goes but help us to meditate on what we heard help us to really think about what we heard here tonight god and i trust lord as brother caleb was saying their church went through just a month of listening to the greatest battle ever fought and how it just began to change some of the people lord god let the word change us let it change its god we'll be like you we pray your blessings upon
