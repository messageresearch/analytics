time y'all you got to look at it virtually glory to god [Laughter] uh to receive the word of the lord the word that transforms us the word that changes us the word that keeps us we receive the word of

i've made yes it's all about you oh it's all about you oh i'm coming [Music] and it's back about you it's all about [Music] and it's all about you [Music] it's all about you [Music] jesus amen let's give him a clap offering amen god bless you certainly good to be in the house of the lord amen certainly good to see all of you amen let's just buy our hearts and just go let's just buy our hearts for a moment heavenly father we just consider it a privilege that you've bestowed upon us that we could be here this morning to just worship your holy name but we know to god there's no name under heaven whereby we can be saved but by the name of jesus christ the lord we're just so grateful for this opportunity that we could come and just worship your holy name may you come and speak to us may you come and meet every need exceed every expectation you know the burden behind every handed and i pray to the lord that you're just moving a mighty way may you come and anoint this place to learn may your holy spirit just saturate this entire place may touch every individual soul that's here this morning and father i pray as they lay the burdens upon your the altar father there's not one need to god that's thought of there's not one need that's spoken and whispered in a prayer that you didn't know before the foundation of the world and father we know that you'll make up for uh you'll make a way for us may you bless us now as we turn back the pages of the bible and as we look into your scripture and father i pray dear lord that your holy spirit just come and open up the word to us have your perfect will in this morning service and the bride says amen amen god bless you saints that's all the thing that i'll be doing god bless you certainly good to be in the house of the lord just bring your greetings to my family um i would have loved to bring them down here but given the circumstances and everything else so um we're kind of going back and forth and ultimately i made the decision that you know i'll just come down early this morning and be part of the services and um but they bring you their greetings and the lord's just been really good to my family and i you know i was telling brother jack you know the scripture in isaiah where the bible says you know they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and you know i look at my little blessings that the lord has given unto me um and my wife um little naomi and caleb you know there's just a renewed strength that comes when you've been patiently praying and just seeking god and finally you know you stand in a position where that prayer has been answered there's a renewed strength and um and i was telling brother jack i said you know to you know for someone else who read that very same scripture it's just another verse and that's fine but for me it's much more than a verse it becomes a revelation when that verse becomes realizing you know and i started to apply that in other parts of the scripture where you'll find where you know for me a verse might just be a verse in in and i appreciate that verse but for you that experience that you're going through that verse would become something completely different and so and that's the reason why the prophecy says we can look at this book and it becomes a new book to us for everyone else they could kind of tuck it under their arms and say i got the bible for us it's much more than that my salvation is rested upon this word my ticket to heaven is rested upon this word so um so i'm just grateful to the blessings of god and i'm also humbled because you know i was telling brother jack you know you go so many years it's one thing if you pray for something and the next day you get it you know how much of an appreciation what you have for it and but when when you wait when you waited a little while and you've been patient a little while and you've been you've been you've been fervent a little while and you've been pursuing a little while and then finally the the the the prayer has been answered your action and your behavior is far different you become that much more appreciative you become that much more delicate you now know it's like the lord answered my prayers it becomes personal to me so so i'm just i'm just very very excited and i go back to that scripture isaiah where the bible says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength so there's a boost of energy there's a there's there's a strength that's renewed and and and and no one can tell me different all right you know it may not mean much to them but that scripture means everything to me so i just thank god for for his word so we bring your greetings we just bring you love and we're just so excited amen amen what the time we've been living in amen if you wouldn't mind just stand with me and turn with me to isaiah i mean psalm 119. it's funny because um at my church i was telling them you know when we were when we got a chance to kind of assemble and we all had our face mask on and i told them we all look like ninjas in church you know amen praise the lord psalms 119 say amen if you're there verse 105. but jack i'm okay to grab this water right here right okay psalm 119 105. we'll have a couple of opening scriptures so psalm 119 verse 105 it reads thy word it is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path verse 130 of the same chapter the entrance of thy words giveth light it gives understanding unto the simple the first part of verse 133 order my steps in thy word amen may the lord have his blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated as a as a point of as a point of reference um the bible says in john 16 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and he will show you things to come so this scripture has been a source of inspiration to me because i realized the importance of the revelation of god's word and we just read what the bible says god's word is a lamp unto my feet and it's a light unto my path so which means to tell me that we're living in a dark time and the only way that we could have a sense of direction is that our path has to be illuminated and the only way that our path could be illuminated is that the word has to shed light upon the direction where we're going and so if we don't have light if we don't have a sense of where we're going then we could stumble anywhere we we could stumble we could fall we could trip we could fall into danger but i'm encouraged because the bible says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so our path is guided by god so we're living in a very dark time and the only way that we know where we're going is that our path has to be illuminated so we realize that we can't take this path by ourselves we can't walk this walk by ourselves so we need some sort of leadership all right we need someone to hold our hand and navigate us through these dark turmoil times and it's only gonna get darker but the light's going to get brighter [Music] i'm i'm trying to tell you this this is a time where there is going to be a difference and that difference is going to be noticeable and i'm okay being different because i am from a different breed i am from a different group i'm from a different tree i am from the tree of life and so there is that differentiation time and as it becomes darker the light becomes brighter so there's no more places to hide there's no more places to blend in and i'm okay looking different in the world i'm okay acting different in the world i'm okay talking different in the world i'm okay being different because god made me for who i am i'm a reflection of who he is and i'm not ashamed of that [Music] [Applause] [Music] the world is completely in chaos but god is a god of order i'm not in chaos the bible says order my steps in your word as long as i know where i am in god's word then i know that my footsteps are ordered of god the world is in confusion i am not in confusion the world doesn't know what to do i am trusting in the word of god that's been proven let me tell you saints this is not the first pandemic that god has gone through amen this is not the first pestilence praise god the same god that brought the saints in the past through whatever the world went through it's the same god that i am worshiping today [Applause] we live in a dark world that's void of god violence in every corner natural disasters that's taking place pestilence this is not an epidemic this is a pandemic before things were concentrated to a region or a location the world is beginning to feel the impact because the world has fallen away from god violence natural disasters pestilence wars the rumors of wars are you familiar with that scripture the bible says look up your redemption draw is nigh we're the only people that in the middle of sorrows that we can have a jubilee we're the only people that can walk around with smiles on our faces [Applause] [Music] people don't know what's going on they're trying to look for an answer they're running here and they're running there god is my answer amen when we see these things begin to unfold the bible says look up your redemption draweth nigh that scripture is becoming more and more of a reality our ability to get through this world is only by god's words alone amen amen no words of man can carry you through the trials this is a little bit of this is a little bit of that squeeze that we've been preaching about right yes sir yes sir this is a little bit of that now don't get all comfortable with your on your chairs but we're gonna get we're gonna go some places now i know for at least for us we hadn't had church in a little bit and the prophet did preach that one of these days the church doors will be closed so being able to assemble here right we always took that for granted we say yeah we believe the church store's gonna be closed but we always came to church that sunday we'll stay in the church that tuesday that wednesday whenever the church source was open we came to church and now we entered a predicament for a little bit where the church doors were closed and the pastor was not around the deacons was not around so people don't see you acting a christian in the days that you couldn't be in services how did you keep yourself edified in god's word how did you keep yourself enthusiastic about god's words how did you keep yourself motivated about god's words because there's no one now telling you to build a family altar there's no one telling you to read the bible i don't know about y'all but it was it was a really challenging time for me and my family all right because we had to constantly find ourselves i as the head of the house i had to constantly find myself how do i engage my family and reading the scripture daily singing songs daily creating the atmosphere constantly the only atmosphere that some people some of us know is only when we get to church and it shouldn't be that way because we leave it to the soul leader to create an atmosphere the man i'm so happy to praise god all right and then we bring and then we leave it to the minister to come and just preach us happy and we leave that atmosphere here but when the tables have been turning you don't have the luxury to sit in this place like like we are today and now you got to take it home you got to make your home a sanctuary hallelujah and when you begin to look at the state of your home they're staring things that don't belong in the home so therefore it becomes difficult to make your home a sanctuary so you got to start removing certain things so that way the holy spirit can feel very comfortable in your home i said lord you can have access to every room in my house amen y'all could say amen amen lord you can have access to every closet in my house and lord i don't want you to feel like you're a guest here's the keys to my house so this has been a little bit of a test on how we come together in the absence of one another fellowshipping because we thrive off of fellowship right when i see another brother that's our brother jack duff i haven't seen him in a while my spirit just lifted i was so excited we thrive off of fellowship we strive off of communion but when you got to take a stance by yourself and you're got to take a stance with your family every sermon that was preached on this service behind this pulpit is now for you to put into practice because it's easy in the company of others to say amen preach your brother but when you're by yourself and you have to create the same atmosphere and all you got is just the scripture that's laying before you you got to be able to read that scripture and not hear my voice but hear god's voice and still say lord i believe this word to be true amen so that way when we come back we come back with our little licks of fire already on we're already enthusiastic we're already edified to continue that spirit of worship because in the stage of loneliness people kind of resort back to their old ways they become discouraged so david himself reached a point in his life well he felt by himself and he had to encourage himself that's it sir and the lord i encourage myself and the lord right amen i appreciate your prayers i appreciate the god bless you i appreciate you know move on brother i appreciate these things but when i've got to stand by myself and there's no one around me i'm going to encourage myself in god's words can we say praise the lord so only he can light the path he gives you clarity of direction it's interesting because we have more knowledge today but we have more ignorance we have more technology but more deaths we have a lot more goods and products that sold but a lot more people die of hunger and thirst what a world we live in you know it kind of goes back to where the bible says that the earth was without form and void and that's in genesis chapter one the bible says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters all right so that's a lot to unpack so let me let me help out with this the earth was without form so something occurred where at one time perhaps the earth was in the presence of the s-u-n but it moved away from that presence and the earth was without form and the bible says it was void and darkness a a shroud of darkness covered this earth but there were seeds that were laying inside of the earth and so god could have looked down at that earth and says i'm going to start all over again but out of a dead situation because the earth was not moving the earth was without form let me bring this home to you i was a i was that earth i was without form of godliness i was void of dark i was void of god and darkness was upon this flesh amen i was born with the spirit let me tell you back in my day you wouldn't want to spend time with gene that brother gene gene because at that time i didn't view you as a brother and i didn't view you as a sister but within that same verse the bible says that the spirit of god moved in the midst of something that was dead god was alive moving action took place god moved upon his creation god didn't just cast you away he worked with that same creation so this earth that was without form didn't have any form of godliness whatsoever wouldn't even step his foot into church wouldn't even open a bible but there was this undeniable seed on the inside that could that could not deny the likeliness of the father and in that same scripture the bible says end she says by the way it's not all over yet it's not finished yet and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters so this earth that was probably out in this realm of darkness and just cold and and shallow and this shroud of darkness covered it and god said let there be light one of my favorite scriptures let there be light i wish my voice was deep enough just to kind of let that kind of come across let there be light let me say god was not asking for permission god didn't go to some angels and thomas they said what do you think about this god looked at his creation who was a part of him and he saw through the dark veil a seed that's a reflection of himself and god stepped on the scene and said let there be light yes [Music] god looked down at you when you were drinking your beer smoking your cigarettes running with the wrong crowd having a fine mouth and god said let there be light there was not a devil that could step forward and prevent that word from coming to pass god looked down at you when you were just soaking in your beers running wild with your friends thinking you had your whole future planned ahead of you and god said let there be light before you even thought about him he was thinking about you in the darkness that overshadowed the seed on the inside that others could not see others could not see because all this all was the outer shell all they saw was your attitude all this song was your behavior all they saw was your conduct but god looked right past the veil he looked right past the darkness he looked right past the the foul talking the the all these different things and he got right into where that seed was and he saw a reflection of himself and the darkness had to give way that's that's why this message is so unique because this message is not giving birth to you by accident amen it was planned by god amen hallelujah he said i have no idea why i'm sitting here god has a plan god has a purpose god has a reason virgin i don't know why we're in a pandemic god knows what he's doing amen and god said let there be light and the bible says and god saw the light that it was good and he divided the light from the darkness god now i felt i'm all over the place so bear with me turn with me to exodus chapter three this is where i'd like to spend a little bit of time exodus chapter three a very familiar scripture to all of you again we need that leadership of god because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of god and we read in that same scripture where we want the lord to order my footsteps i want him to dictate my direction you know it's so funny because i said this to the church before or by the home church i say you know we we kind of we put our plans together and we write them down which is good you know i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this i'm going to do this and i'm going to go here i'm going to go there god looks at you says that's cute god looks at us that's cute because your ways is not god's ways and god's ways is not your ways but god will watch your step every step of the way and you'll find yourself directly in the lying in the path of god you can't be lost he won't lose you he's invested too much into you in exodus chapter three verse one now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to orb so moses kept the flock of jethro and here you find that it's almost as if it's symbolic that he's leading uh this flock this herd of sheep if you will to the backside of the desert it's as if it's a a prelude a a a a a a forthcoming of what he was going to do by leading the children of israel into the wilderness and so you find the scene has been set the stage is set and so you find where moses is doing this and as he's leading them god realizes that moses can't do this by himself [Music] and moses had still been reliant on his education his learning his confidence his abilities not to say there's anything wrong with that but you can't put that before god because the bible equally says according to proverb lean not to your own understanding so here you have moses going into the back side of the desert and i i'm sure he probably had his day outlined as far as where he would bring the the flock and he also had it pictured what they would go through the path that they would go through and so as if to say god was not in all of this but god already knew the plan that moses had outlined for the day and so he brought them to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to orb and the angel of the lord appeared onto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and said and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed so you got to give some credit to moses that he was raised in the in the halls of pharaoh so he received the best education that education can offer exactly right so he had all of the great scientists at his disposal he had all the engineers and all of the mathematics he had all of the physics folks and everyone of of of great of great success that guided his education right and so when he saw this burning bush he quickly deduced that something is supernatural taking place because how is it that this bush would burn but it was not consumed especially in the middle of a hot desert and so azure as moses was going along his life journey if you will like you and i something caught his attention something supernatural not what we see every day but something different i've heard a lot of preaching i've heard of a lot of testimonies but nothing compares to this divine word that has caught my attention i needed a supernatural intervention i needed more than a psychiatrist to talk to me i needed more than someone who i needed more than a theologian i needed more than a preacher i needed god to step in the scene and do something supernatural in my life [Music] and an angel appeared unto him in the flame of fire glory god is a consuming fire amen moses was getting comfortable in the backside of the desert so god needed something to ignite moses i was getting too comfortable in the world and god needed something to ignite this soul of mine [Music] let me ask you are you still excited about god today amen are you so crazy about god today does this word still excite you oh come on saints you gotta be loud into that i want the devil to know that in the year 2020 in the middle of a pandemic i'm still excited about my god [Music] it's going to take a lot more than this day satan devil is going to take a lot more than this it's going to take a lot more than a little sickness it's going to take a lot more than my economic turmoil it's going to take a lot more than these little problems here and there it's already too late if this is if this is what you got you got to come bigger than that because my god is a big dog he's able to keep me he's able to deliver me [Music] and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush the bush burned he probably sat there and watched this bush burning and just watched and just watched and just watched and then in verse three right this is this testimony moses says i'm going to go see what's happening up there god knows how to get your attention he knows how to get your attention moses was going this way he saw that burning bush i listened to this he saw a burning bush he forgot about the path he was going that was not accidental god knows how to distract you you might be going the wrong path god knows how to put your stomping dead in your tracks and have you look directly at the promise and say i shouldn't be going there this is where i need to go praise the lord get the path of god that your path is ordered by god thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the light unto my path not accidental and moses said i will now turn aside and not even see this sight y'all gotta give god some credit i don't just be reading the bible just to read it because it's fun god's trying to tell me something there was something special about that sighting this was beyond his knowledge this was beyond his wisdom this was beyond his schooling he couldn't explain it right he says i need to see this great site and what was the site why the bush is not burnt he haven't even heard the voice yet he haven't even heard the voice he hasn't even heard the voice yet all he saw was just a burning bush and he's wondering why is it not burning soldier when i came across this message i saw some wonders but i haven't even heard the voice of the sign yet but when i heard the voice that completely changes everything moses said i will now turn aside and see this great great sight our god is a great god he does wonderful things marvelous things his ability to do beyond what you and i could ever imagine or think of it was beyond reasoning moses had to gather his entire herd this was not accident of god this is part of the lesson that god was giving him because you can't do this by yourself i got a mission he already got a mission for moses he has he has he has something he needs of him but moses can't do it by himself so he he he takes moses off his path so if you're not on the course that you were on before it's no accident oh my god order my steps in your word you can't say that scripture and not mean it i've entered into a contract i've entered into agreement when i say amen that means so be it order my steps now listen to this and when the lord saw that he turned aside because god's watching all of this unbeknownst to moses unbeknownst to him have no idea god's god is watching over this and the lord said the lord and the lord saw that he turned aside to sea god called him called on to him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses the reason why that's important is because god knows you by name god knows you you're you're not just a member of the church god knows you yes each and every one of you sitting here by name amen over 7 billion people on planet earth and god knows you by name hallelujah when adam fell god didn't just came down in the cool of the evening and say hey where you at hey where are you at god knew his boy's name he [Music] that's important saints amen because you respond to your name amen imagine if jesus went to the grave of lazarus he says hey come forward every dead saint would come forward but because god is particular god knows every individual by name he had to be specific he says lazarus come forth and lazarus came forth when you were dead in sin shaping iniquity buried in sin that was your lifestyle that was your life condition and god looked down at you and saved gene come forth he brought me back from the dead saints he brought me back from the grave i know what it means like to be resurrected because i was dead in sin so he says moses moses and moses said this and i want you to pay close attention because it's going to connect to another verse he says here m ah three words here am i moses was saying lord i'm available you know what's particular about that verse he didn't say who are you he recognized that voice you don't make yourself available to any spirit that calls you to any voice that calls you but something about that voice especially that that voice knows your name especially that voice caught your attention moses didn't dispute say well how did you know my name moses didn't get into the basis well well well who are you moses just said hear mine that's the same thing samuel said when the lord calls samuel he says hear my. make yourself available to god make yourself available for the service make yourself available for god not when you feel like it every time you hear this word preach to you lord hear my now holding that thought we'll continue reading we'll come back to that this is going to be important and he said in verse 5 and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thousands is holy ground so the place that he stood was holy ground and i could preach another message because around this because it really links to redemption we see that in the story of booth and uh uh boyas and ruth we see that in in john when john uh had to uh was when jesus was approaching john and and john looked at jesus says behold the lamb of god whose shoes i'm worthy to unloose all types in in there it's it's it's a type of redemption and so he he as he got closer he says take off your shoes and brother bram says he didn't ask him to take off his hat all right god's very specific about certain things he says take off your shoes for the place that you stand is holy ground perhaps moses have gone places that he shouldn't have gone perhaps you know he's gone to he's done things that he shouldn't have but god was getting ready to work with him so he says remove your shoes and i could only but also think that god's probably saying this is not going to be your journey this is my journey i'm using you as a vessel to get to my people can you just imagine what the experience must have been no one else around but moses and god having communion there's nothing more uplifting more refreshing than when you find yourself concentrated in prayer i'm talking about be prayer where you're uttering things to the lord that he himself only knows in you and you find that you're in communion with god and he's carrying a conversation with you and in verse six the bible says from over he said i am god i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob bo so god was trying to identify moses with his lineage yes yes the first revelation where did that come from where am i going and so god had to address that and put out the way he says i'm of the god of abraham isaac and jacob right and that was important because i realized it was much more for me as an individual to know that my my my roots doesn't go back to just my natural tree but it's like it's an experience that's deeper than that and it goes all the way back to the tree of life my branches are connected to each one of you glory because your roots go back to the tree of life amen so when god took that family portrait way back in the beginning one of you was probably standing right next to me because god took a family picture i was in that photo i was right there you know when you're like behind somebody you want to make sure you're in the you're in the picture there's no denying that i am part of god's family you don't don't deny your part you're part of god's family amen i don't care how many people goes before me there's a name there's a seat with my name written on it and that seat cannot be touched amen because i'm part of that family i'm part of adam i'm part of abraham i'm part of isaac i'm part of jacob i'm part of that you're a part of that that's the reason why this word has more meaning to it than anything else so god addresses that now listen to this in verse 7 and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows three key words you want to point out i have seen he's he's observant in the midst of your pain and your tragedy and your everything that you're going through the hurt the agony the tribulation yes sir he's talking to his servant he says i have seen the affliction of my people he said lord you say reggie i've been praying for such a long time i am i i define myself constantly on my knees just praying i'm calling upon god and god god looks to moses and says i have heard their cry we're not we're not worshiping an idol saying something tell you i'm worshiping some some some god that doesn't listen some god that doesn't see the bible says i've seen your affliction i have heard your cry you might come to church and you're happy everything is good but when you're at home and you're just shedding tears and no one has no idea god says i've heard your and he cry to moses and says i know they're sorrows and that's what that's for the people that can't even find the words to express hallelujah sometimes our heart is so deep you can't even find the words to express and god says you don't need to say anything but i know what a great physician that we worship wouldn't it be something if you can step into the doctor's office and the doctor says i know i appreciate the doctors but i only know one who's a great physician the moment i step into his practice he says i know your problem i know your situation and i got the solution for you amen he's the only physician the great physician that he can take one look at you and says i know what you're here for i know why you came to see me i know the diagnosis and i have an answer for you amen that's the god i worship moses couldn't have drawn that conclusion god had to start there with him it says i've seen the affliction it reached to heaven [Music] you know the one scripture i like is in the book of daniel daniel was praying he was praying he was praying for an answer from god he was praying for an answer from god he was praying for an answer from god i believe the bible says around 21 days later an angel come up to daniel and say daniel highly favorite of god he says i've come to answer your prayers but daniel but the angel had to get this straight he looks at daniel he says daniel let me tell you something the first day that you begin to pray god heard your prayers 21 days later you can say 21 years later [Music] my prayers i've been praying for 20 some years and when the answer came god says the first day i heard your prayers jesus think about that saints god is so mindful of you he doesn't forget oh yes now in verse 8 it says and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians because they didn't belong there i am come down man there's just so many to this a personal pronoun he is he says about he says i i am come down he set aside his glory you know the way the prophet illustrates he says when that when his when uh when when the atom race fell you know michael says i'll i'll do this god says it's not for you gabriel says i do this and god says it's not for you the bible says he could not swear by anyone greater so he swore by himself he says i gotta do this i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians they were in the grips of satan's hands and to bring them up out of to bring them up out of that land onto a good land in the large onto a land flowing with milk and honey so i am come down dot dot dot to bring them up i have come down to bring them up i come down so that way he can bring you up you don't belong here he's called you to a higher dimension he scolds you to a higher purpose that's the reason why the bible says in revelation 4 come up hither you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus he's brought you he's come down think about that how far down did he come how far down did he come the bible says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for god became flesh but how far down did he come he saw his servant's feet they were unclean so he took a bowl and he came all the way down he started to wash their feet that was your god the creator of heavens and earth of the galaxy in the universe that we gave him credit to he stooped so low and started washing your feet washed your feet but i wasn't low enough he bore your sins and my sins he went to a place called calvary the prophet says that heaven couldn't receive him because he was sinful he had the sins of the world on him and earth didn't want him so he was suspended between heaven and earth so he went further down he went down to hell that's right that's right he went to the regions where the saints were at he went even further down and took the keys of hell and death so that way he could bring you up the saints came up with them he elevated them oh my goodness saints listen to me now that's the reason why there was an injunction that was given to you and i an ego's anointing because god is saying you're not you're not supposed to be down here the first beast the lion he was grounded to the earth the second beast the ox he was grounded to the earth the third beast the man he was grounded to the earth but god said in this stage i'm going to give you an anointing of an eagle we're not grounded to the earth oh by the old testament in the new testament you ought to take flight above all types of things he's elevating you to a position elevate that's why we elevate one another we edify one another brother i'm praying for you sister i'm encouraging you we want to lift each other up because that's what we're designed to do he came down to bring them up out of that land until land that is flowing with milk and honey i reserved this for some other time but there's a reason why there's a land a land that's over abundance in milk and honey the the thought that could believe that it could be gleaned there a land that is theirs these were promises that god had told the children of israel but they had forgotten about it but god never forgot about it i'm winding down bear with me verse 9 now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have and i have also seen the oppression where the egyptians oppressed him come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh i will bring you before the very thing you fled from because what you left you left in a different state you were a different person when you fled that thing but you will confront it again but this time you're different this time you're not by yourself this time you got strength this time you got power beyond the imagination i'm gonna send you to pharaoh moses didn't that that was not according to his plan because he tried it himself the first time it did not go as planned he had to throw the playbook away it just it just it just didn't work so he drew that conclusion i gotta find somebody else clearly i'm not qualified your your criteria is not what god uses to dictate your ability to do something you might be the least spoken person in here and god sees the most virtue that needs to come from you my god each of you have a potential that god could use we say god not me i'm just gonna be happy in the backside just taking care of the sheep god's like all right you can put that that aside i need you for something bigger i will save you to pharaoh that you may bring forth my people god says i'm using you as a vessel they're my people be careful how you treat them [Music] god's always putting things in perspective he says these are my people bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt now listen to this verse 11. and we'll wrap up with this and moses said unto god who am i who now we had just read previously he says lord here i am here am i use me and now that god says here's the task he says lord who am i it's too late to back pedal now god already got you amen you've come too far for the lord for the lord to lose you now you've come all the way here god's not going to lose you now saints amen being available is one thing right thinking you're somebody is something else lord i i i'm a nobody who am i that i of all people surely you got other people that's better to go before pharaoh and that i should bring them forth he started to doubt himself let me tell you something when god makes a decision when god makes a decision about you no one can change that decision all right praise god amen it's a done deal like i illustrated too much to like my church back home i say he took a pen he dipped it in blood and he wrote your name in the lamb's book of life in blood in the lamb's blood wrote your name that's it no one no one could ever take that name from the lamb's book of life it wasn't written today it wasn't written yesterday it wasn't written 20 years ago before the foundation of the world before he created the heavens and the earth before an atom came into existence before there was a celestial ball called the sun before anything your name was dipped in blood and wrote in the lamb's book of life so moses looked to god and says i know i told you i was available but who am i when you're confronted with such the awesomeness of god and you're in in the task that's at hand you feel inadequate you feel am i worthy of such a blessing and that's the thing what satan tries to do god sends a blessing to you like am i really worthy god made you worthy he's bestowed such a blessing upon you and to give him some ease and comfort because that's who our father is that's how he operates verse 12 he looks to moses and he said certainly i this ain't about you most god's always correcting the error all right what do you want me to do i just need a vest so i got this i'm doing this i'm the one that came down to bring the people up i'm the one that's going to deliver them out of pharah's head i just need a submissive vessel you didn't hear the cry i heard the cry you didn't see the affliction i see the affliction you're back here with the jethro i know what's going on i needed a vessel i will do this all we are is just a vessel in god's hands and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee word for when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you shall serve god upon this mountain let's all stand to our feet we started the scripture thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light onto my path no matter where life brings you you need direction you need some illumination to know where you're going you know what's interesting about that the pathway is not lit behind you the pathway is not lit behind you because there's no turning back the path is only lit forward so that path is illuminated before you there's no going back you've come this far by god's grace the bible says in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you know how frequently we bat our eyes and we don't even think about it some of us done it like in the last five seconds that i said that but yet the bible says in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this mortal must put on immortality this corruptible must put on incorruption paul was so absolute about that word he was so certain he spoke with authority he says it must take place must not perhaps maybe must so the fact that paul spoke it it has to happen so that scripture has been preached it's been it's it's it's it's it's it's made its way through the ages you and i should be able to step in and say that scripture is for me and if i go by the way the grave this corruptable must put on incorruption it has to happen but until then lord illuminate my path guide my decision it's about hearts heavenly father we i just want to say thank you for your the richness of your word the purity of your word and how true it is we thank you for the path that's been illuminated before us that the the light that's been shed we have a sense of direction we know where we're going we know in whom we have confidence in the scriptures say that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of god thank you to the lord for watching my footsteps for dictating my path the lord there's a lot of things in life that we are uncertain of but there's a scripture that says be certain of god and that we have confidence in we're certain of you i'm uncertain what tomorrow will bring but i'm certain of you to god i'm uncertain what next year will bring but i'm certain of you you have never failed me you've watched over me and my family and i pray to lord that you continue to watch over every household every husband every wife every mother every father every child father may you bring this family together may you bring the church together may you keep them cemented by your holy spirit and i know through this unity the devil would like to bring some some point of division but father i pray that you just meld us closer together maybe the holy spirit that ties us glues us may there be a a fortress of your word that that's protected us round about watch us throughout life's journey we live in a chaotic world a world that's falling apart in every avenues of life to god demons all over the place and father the only confidence i have is in your word that you'll keep me and my family watch this little this little group be with us to god we commit all things into your hands have your perfect will in our lives in jesus christ and we pray amen god bless you and he knows my every thought hallelujah say he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when i call he knows my name oh he knows my name he knows my everything and he knows

tell you that was food for the soul food for the soul and just um sometimes just sitting there just breaking down just verse by verse and really reading uh what the lord is trying to speak to us i don't think i ever cope right there in the scripture i have come down to bring them up i i came down like you say just dot dot dot to bring them up and i tell you if we weren't brought up today i don't know what it's going to take to bring you up the the word has come in as an entrance into our path and and it should lift us out of whatever conditions that we're facing the word of god itself has power to change our lives i'm i'm i'm very appreciative of the word of the lord today i just saw how much my god loves me amen how much he cares me and just just the words i i i see the affliction i've seen it i've seen it i've heard their cry and i know what's going on i know all about the situations god has not forgot about your church i don't care what it is that you're going through i don't care how long you've been praying for god is here to respond to your crime i believe that appreciate brother gene amen this morning pray that the lord would just bless him and renew his strength amen and and i'll tell you what he called he said god came down and called adam and he just began to call everybody's name i just i just i just i can hear god calling my name you know and you got to respond when god speak got to respond the bible say the day that you hear his voice heard not your heart and just just to you know when he spoke to adam you know how many people were in church actually actually they was missing from church the reason they came down because it was a it was a they wanted that was a reason he called a name because they wanted in church the reason he called moses name because moses went where he was supposed to be come on somebody and he'll call your name to get you back in place where he needs you to be he's a mighty god he's almighty god he's a mighty god but i mean he he he came down there's only two people in church sometimes god want to speak in just little little groups like this i remember brother hugo made a statement years ago and i'll never forget it it says if you had the opportunity a man uh when if you were on the earth when brother branham was here and you had the opportunity to attend a meeting and go and and sit in the meeting and just enjoy the presence of the meeting or you had the opportunity to have a personal one-on-one interview with the prophet say which would you take i'm gonna tell you if you got sin in your life you go to the meeting and try to hide amongst the people but if your life is clean and you just want to maybe get to know the mind of god you'll have a one-on-one interview with the prophet and just let them answer all the questions that's in your heart hallelujah god want to come down today just one-on-one with you and just just speak to your heart hallelujah we heard from heaven this morning amen we heard from heaven and i got confidence we gonna hear again in a about another hour so amen there's so much that was said and and and different testimonies that i know that uh the word was just going right into those channels and amen and then when i when i when i just see god on the scene i can't help but yell breach that's god on the scene church hallelujah i'd be wanting people to know he jesus is here amen the way he came down in moses the same way he came down today in brother gene he's the same yesterday today in february praise the lord let's bow in a word of prayer god we thank
