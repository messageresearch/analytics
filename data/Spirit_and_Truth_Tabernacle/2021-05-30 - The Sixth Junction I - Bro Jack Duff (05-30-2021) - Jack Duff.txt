know about them uh you could be seated this morning and uh man i tell you what i forgot the song that they were singing i put them in my little pandora playlist and uh i said man man these young people i said you know what it's the way that i saw them acting i say man i could show i could show get with them my voice would probably come back my shadow probably come back it was it was not starchy in them young people is that right sometimes we try to hold the young folk down well oh folk you know we we need to go back down memory lane right are we we ain't dead right the times where we could you know shout i know i was telling the uh the the lady i'm a sales person i say you know i can't jump around like i used to but i say man my brother-in-law we sit back down we simulate we just kind of you know me and troy we be back that we be just acting like we jumping but we ain't getting off the ground we be acting like we doing something but you know what i believe amen you know if we continue to do that boy i'll tell you what don't be surprised now don't be surprised there used to be time when we used to charge the pulpit and yeah we should have a good time hey man i said that to say all this let's not let this get get common to us amen don't let it get common i feel good now go ahead sister i don't want no preacher [Music] god bless you all um at first i didn't want to give this testimony because it's a little personal and i think that that's just the devil trying to hide a testimony so i'm going to give it about three months ago um i noticed that there was um a lump in one of my breasts and um that was startling for me but i thought okay well maybe i pulled a muscle or something because that's happened before i'll pull something and it'll leave like a lump until it heals you know but a month and a half went by and it wasn't going away it was getting bigger and i was starting to hurt so i said okay i'll give it a little more time um another month went by and it was still growing and hurting more so the wednesday service when we had the prayer line that so many testimonies have come from i went for prayer for that and i was just holding on to my faith that god was going to move and heal me and the lump was not going away and it was still hurting so i decided to go to the doctor i had them do tests they did two tests they did a mammogram and then they did an ultrasound and on both of the tests they couldn't see anything so the the the ultrasound the lady with the ultrasound wand she said i can feel it um the the wand is going over the lump but i don't see anything on the ultrasound so we're all just sitting there utterly confused and they said well since it's hurting the next step would be for you to get a a biopsy so we're going to schedule you with the surgeon and that didn't sit right with me that was not okay with me um so i called my husband and i was like um you know i wonder why god is letting this go on for so long you know we've prayed over it and you know i know he can heal me so you know what's he doing and um i remember after i hung up with him i had to run some errands and i hadn't eaten that day so i went and got some food and i decided to sit in my car and eat because the place was packed and i remember my husband had said sometimes he'll turn on the lifeline radio on the the message app and he'll hear god speak to him sometimes through that so i turned on the lifeline radio as i was sitting in the car and i couldn't believe what started coming through the first thing i heard when i turned it on was this quote it says you be the judge your mind is the jury every jury has to make up its mind i'm closing the court you be the judge your mind is the jury and your actions from here after this afternoon when we lay hands on the sick that'll spell what your verdict was the way you act after you're prayed for that'll tell what your intellectual mind has made up what the jury of your mind has made up that'll tell just exactly your action from here after and then that was that was a confirmation for me not to have the biopsy and then i sat there just eating and then i heard um it was brother branham's voice but it was god speaking to me and it said a little lady sitting right here looking right at me i don't know you i'm not gonna cry i'm sorry it was just so personal to me because it was very terrifying for me it says uh you're a stranger to me you don't know me sitting right here uh looking right at me yes you you don't know me but you're suffering aren't you you kind of was a little worried about something it's a lump that's in your breast if that's right raise up your hand now you say you see you've seen a lump there is no lump shows so i see it i feel it i i can feel it there i can feel the pain but there's nothing showing anywhere on any of the tests so i'm just holding to um my testimony that god has healed me completely and the day that that lump goes away and i don't feel the pain anymore i will be right here saying amen thank you jesus because i knew you already healed me i hope this song is a blessing a blessing for you [Music] it's a blessing when i see the dark clouds partying when the rain is gone and sun is breaking through i anticipate when life will just be normal just to close my weary eyes and rest in you my heart can rest so easy when there's blue skies when the wind is gone and rain is not inside [Music] how i long to hang my sword above the mantle away from harm and distant from the fire but i wouldn't know your peace without the hard times or be thankful for relief without the pain i wouldn't love the light if it were not for darkness or appreciate the sun without the rain how could i understand forgiveness without failure or feel the warmth of love without the bitter cold how could i hold your healing hands without affliction and be blessed to see your mercies all unfold sure it's a blessing to be safe secure and warm but lord i wanna thank you for the storm [Music] [Applause] [Music] imagine as peter said in prison he may have paced the floors with chains around his feet [Music] and in his mind the devil taunted as he whispered the battles lost and this is your defeat [Music] and then his mind went back to that night in the tempest when the master spoke and winds and sees obey [Music] and he remembered that storm coming all around him and he could rest in that dark prison unafraid and say i wouldn't know your peace without the hard times or be thankful for relief without the pain i wouldn't love the light if it were not for darkness or appreciate the sun without the rain how could i understand forgiveness without failure or feel the warmth of love without the bitter cold how could i hold your healing hands without affliction and be blessed to see your mercies all unfold sure it's a blessing to be safe secure and warm lord i wanna thank you for the storm if my life were free of trials lord i'd lose my view of you [Music] they're sweet trophies that remind me of all you do sure it's a blessing to be safe secure and warm but lord i wanna thank you for the storm i'm still safe secure and warm but lord i wanna thank you for the storm [Applause] hey man how many can say that this morning lord i i thank you i'm going through some stuff but uh i thank you for the storm you know i tell you what i i thank god for scripture the bible said i'll never leave you not forsaken i i'll be with you you know we be going through through things and and sometimes we feel all alone but it's just good to know

hand of jehovah and i began to just meditate on what that meant the tender hannah jehovah and um of course sister birds was speaking on yesterday and just kind of thinking of the past and how we got to this point there was a hunger and a thirst for something real we were nothing against my baptist brothers and sisters but it just it was a deep that was calling and we were children but they were our parents and they were our our leaders at the time and god placed that hunger in them that there's got to be something more and the tender hand of jehovah sort of moved him from one place to another and just this morning brother jack and i was fellowshipping on how the courage for brother west go to go off and come back with this strange message that we've never heard and from that you have what you have here today that's in the hand of jehovah amen softly and tenderly jesus is calling calling for you and for me see on the portals he's waiting and watching watching for you and for

keep doing things like that god will bless you even more so we appreciate you brother nehemiah amen his parents are away and he's here in church so amen we thank god for that wanting to do that not not just on sunday but stay in the presence of the lord all week amen god will bless you abundantly so amen how we appreciate the lord i i'm i'm gonna uh ask you to turn to scripture with me but as you're doing that i'm i'm uh turning here to uh acts two i want to uh thank the lord for uh brother randy and sister celine being with us on today amen so good brother randy told me a while ago he say um bro i'm gonna come see you i'm gonna come see you and i saw him this morning come through to me you can't be a promising so it's so good to see him a man and um uh also um i just wanted to mention that um i don't know what has changed but whatever has changed i i like it a man uh uh brother brother brother marcus man it's good to see you with your family i know we talked about that a few weeks ago and something unchanged but man it's it's good to see it's good to see this man y'all look good [Laughter] a few weeks ago i think it was mother's day and i and i i was preaching just talking about you know um a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised and i was just going down all these characteristics of my my hero my wife a man and and and uh just talking about her and brother marcus he met me outside and said did you did my wife tell you all these things about her i said no no she said see that's what virgil's woman meets another virtuous woman they connect right so we thank god for that and we just appreciate amen them and and i have a a precious friend of mine that's with us a man for this weekend and she moved to tennessee before she left to go to tennessee her final um visit to church was here a man a spirit of truth tabernacle and and uh when she was she was been there for a little over a year and and the lord is blessed to come back and visit uh this time i should say the lord i just put in my spirit two churches to visit when i came supposed to go to church that i came from and then i was supposed to go to your church so she here and my precious friend joyce tucci amen is in the house uh a dear sister in christ uh we we met on the job and and um you can tell it was a friendship from eternity uh because even since we've left that job we've stayed in contact every time you know the lord opens up a door for me to go somewhere if i don't call and tell her where i'm going she reprimands me amen and the reason she reprimands me is because she say i want to pray for you i want to be covering you in prayer especially when you're away and and she always she always asks this one question is your wife going with you i like that now there's a reason she asks that right because she knows that there's temptations out there glory to god the devil y'all think it'd just be some vacation no the devil's waiting to trip somebody up right so we have we have to have to stay on guard all the time every hotel you're going to you got to stay on guard there's spirits there waiting to attack a minister the devil has somebody checking the hotel the very day you check in and they watching and spotting ain't nobody with them right they watch that type of stuff the devil try to set you up so i like to have my wife with me i i like to have that or go with another brother or something you know that that keep the devil at baby not no brother looking for no trouble amen but you know holiness is still right glory to god so i just i thank god and i just appreciate the lord and thank god for brother smiley last week and him uh preaching the word of god to us we certainly appreciate that and just all the lord has done amen and continues to do for us we're grateful let me let me just uh turn with me to acts 2 man and uh cuda good to see you amen god bless you uh brother simba's younger brother amen his little brother but his bigger brother you know what i'm saying amen it's good to see brother brother kuda amen brother russell uh in the house amen glory to god all right all right uh acts 2 and we're starting at verse 15 here it says uh for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy a young man shall see visions praise god and your old men shall dream dreams and uh we've been not just reading this but we've been living this as we've been in the series we've been we've been living this i think they were i told you all about the the one dream i had of brother quinton walking up to me and gave me keys to the church and saying pastor is all all done it's all settled and then he he also had a dream that he was walking the same three days apart that he he gave me keys to church said it was all done so i i took it as a confirmation i'm just waiting on the keys that's we believe in god for a new church in school so i'm just waiting on the keys and then brother smiley had a had a dream somebody told him i can show you how to overcome uh this vertigo and a dream in a dream healing's taking place uh in the midst of the junction y'all understand that that's why sister amanda had to give her testimony and and and they told me that we when we had that wednesday night service about a month or so ago and all those testimonies that came forth and we had everybody testify but nobody could hear what you were saying on the other line so i might have to set up another service just for testimonies right so uh let's just share what god is doing amen make known as deeds among men he's still moving in the midst of a pandemic he's still god in the midst of a pandemic glory to god all right so uh here verse 18 says no my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy glory to god i i love it uh also in the in the midst of this series on junctions we started our um terry service and uh the first terry service god poured out his spirit and there was prophecies going forth we're getting ready to have our second we're on the expectation that god's going to pour out his spirit again we are not reading this we're living this hey man amen and and uh brother josue was sharing a quote with me of how the prophet laid out terry services because you know people ain't never heard these things before we don't talk about it much but when he got the quote it's like oh there it is the prophet laid it out that's it so if y'all want brother josue to share the quote with you if you got questions he got a quote that he can share with you glory to god amen we we right back in the word church uh we're standing on uh spirit and truth that's that's what it is it says uh and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vape of smoke um the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood uh before that great and notable day of the lord um come now just remember i saw an article recently there's another blood moon that's about to uh unfold is that right all in the time of the junctions all right amen and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved softly and tenderly jesus is calling calling for you and for me come home come home come home god bless you appreciate those specials amen as well let's pray over the word father we thank you for the reading of the word let the holy spirit now come and and lord make the word real to us we need to hear from you we trust oh god that you just take complete control over this portion of the service just to felt your anointing through the song service and the worship just uh everything that's been done lord is drawing us closer and closer to you so speak to us now through your word god it's in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you god bless you um we are continuing our journey here with um the junctions today will be titled uh the sixth junction and i will uh probably preach this in a two-part series um and um you know we'll just see where the lord just kind of takes us from there but i um want to just maybe uh take us back amen to some of the quotes that we've been reading amen when it comes to uh this junction amen praise the lord and out of the the first quote i want to read is at a junction of time and this paragraph e-4 uh we'll read from there praise god it says my subject this morning uh if we should call it such will be the message to the church is the junction of time the junction of time and always in days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end and we hit a junction and and you know i'm using uh very um um how would i say spiritual terms when we talk about a dispensation coming to an end uh but uh as we're going through this i want you to kind of look at your own life as we started this journey uh through this this this subject um there are there are things that um that we could see in our own lives where we hit a junction right we hit a junction uh um a junction is is very simple you know i don't want to go and make this too deep but it's very simple when you leave the parking lot and you get to the stop light or when you get to a stop sign right uh any anything like that that is considered a junction glory to god uh you can't leave the parking lot and just roll out into traffic especially if it's coming in that direction it won't be a if you ignore the junction you end up in an accident oh my right if you ignore junctions you end up in an accident and spiritually you can actually be going a man uh to a junction you can be at a junction in your life and and a junction if it's a stop sign you know what it means to do it's just that simple stop right don't go any further than this because there's there there's a potential for a great accident if you go further than this and spiritually people have not been able to stop glory to god amen we're not i mean there are people listening on the line and it's one thing to listen on the line that you're not doing anything great by just listening praise god amen but if you're not obeying the word of god if you're not coming in line with the word of god the holy spirit is telling you stop stop your sinning stop this and stop that get back in line with the word of god hallelujah you're at a junction see so it says see there's there's there's uh always in the days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end we hit a junction says there's junctions on the highways they junction on the roads that we travel in this world they junction on this grand old highway that we travel to glory so so on your spiritual journey you're going to have to come to junctions and let me let me let me make it clear the decision that you make at the junction is extremely critical if you make the wrong decision at the junction you can find yourself somewhere where you never thought you would be glory to god you know sometimes when you're choosing a church you're at a junction and if you choose the wrong church you can end up worse sheep praise god than you were amen before that choice so it's very important that you understand spiritually we're all here in this spot we're at a junction we've got to make decisions eternal decisions at the junction it says in and always it takes the miraculous to speak of an omnipotence omnipotence is the all powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that teach another word is a very fine thing and it comes faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must oh hallelujah i've been reading it amen and not just reading it because now uh what i've been reading we are now experiencing we must have the miraculous amen i believe there's another statement the prophet makes that no church can thrive until the supernatural is made known in the midst of the people something that they can talk to and something that'll talk back to them i believe the uh almighty god has been talking back to us with his supernatural presence being in our midst healing after healing glory to god lives being changed supernaturally oh y'all don't get it yet but you will see i mean super i i'ma tell you just one soul coming into the kingdom causes heaven to rejoice now you understand that i never saw brother so-and-so go to the altar i never saw sister so-and-so go to the altar i want to say something about altar calls jesus never had one but lies were changed right and and what what has happened and what i found in church is that we have too many people want to see who's at the altar glory to god but what i want to see is do they have an altar in their heart that god has done something where you can take it down amen god has done something with that person in their heart and you see their lives being transformed right before your very eyes that is a miracle happening at the junction oh i thank god for this i thank god i thank god i thank god hallelujah i was you know listening recently and probably just talk about how you know it's okay to do the altar call but just know it wasn't in the bible there's a lot of things the church do that's not in the bible it's not there a lot and we've accepted it but it's not there that don't mean that i'll never have another altar call i but the article is not for you to see who's coming to the altar praise the lord it's for god to do something in a person's life and as i see god just transforming lives i just begin to thank him for what i see him doing in our midst oh glory to god hey amen amen some of the most powerful things that happen on the earth happen in quietness when the sun rises do you hear it right you don't hear the sunrise but when it rises there's no light like sunlight none whatsoever happens in quietness when the moon rises you don't hear it right it's a powerful act but if that moon wasn't there and it wasn't in the position it was in then the sea would actually embark upon the land but when the moon rise in quietness it it steadies the sea it stops the sea from coming too far into land it says boundaries the moon stops to see some of the most powerful things happen in quietness all right here in this message hear ye him let me just uh bring this one as well um and um it says here every junction of time god sends forth uh prophets uh then angels and gives a warning it says like him before the ant of the living destruction before every other time god always sends warnings first he could not put punishment on the earth without and be and be just without first sending warning i wanted to stop it right there amen so so at a junction especially a spiritual and as we're talking about these seven junctions and today we're focusing on the six a man junction every junction god sends forth prophets and angels and gives a warning so every junction we should expect prophets we should expect a man uh angels we and and and the reason a prophet comes he's giving a warning to the people now brother branham and his um uh teaching us on this message the the junctions of time uh he um uh he laid out there were seven different junctions that he saw according to scripture seven major events that happened in scripture uh that has shaped where we are right now right it shaped seven different things and and we're focusing on those seven major uh events that happened now there was a lot of other things happen in the bible but seven things that he saw that that would be considered a junction and uh and the first one that he listed was noah and the ark hallelujah that's something that shifted uh what what happened in those days the sons of god uh went after the daughters of men hallelujah i i can stay right there for a little bit the sons of god going after people that are not christians can i put it that way the sons of god having their attention on some some some young lady that is not in the church glory to god hallelujah and sometimes you have the daughters of men tricking the sons of god it's the truth anyhow it's a spirit come upon them women and if the sons of god not not careful they'll be tricked by one of these women and they find themselves married oh it's the truth anyhow married to a problem that they can't get out it gonna take the grace of god to carry you through and since this is this is the bed that you decided to lay in you're gonna have to lay in it it's the bed you made you got to lay in it but but the sons of god residents i mean like like like like uh uh uh uh sampson his parents told say why don't you get one of these sisters here from the church but he just had to have delilah he had to have i got to have a mom and dad you don't understand i got to have the life and it wasn't i mean the parents knew this boy every time you go down in the philip and amongst the philistines these women get you in trouble they are not interested in your beauty they not interested in your strength they only interested in killing you and they will they will do any they will agree to anything to get at your life hallelujah think about this we only hear about delilah but before delilah there was another woman in sampson's life come on somebody and that woman said how come you won't give me the riddle samson you know he said i mean you say you love me seven days been waiting on the real side i ain't even told my parents to riddle why would i tell you to real say i thought you loved me sampson sampson gave up the riddle that lady went and told everybody and they come out and told her and he said i'ma say it just like the bible now he said you wouldn't know my riddle if you didn't mess with my heifer is that the bible that is thus says the lord out of the scripture you got to understand what people are doing they are spirits in in philistine in the land of the philistines they they're set up there to kill you samson praise the lord glory to god but the reason that the sons of god go after these sorts of men y'all ain't gonna i'm i'm not gonna get verified i feel like i'm not going to get very far but the reason these sons of god go after the daughters of men they're not willing to wait on the lord they want to beat god to the punch it's the truth anyhow right and the same spirits that was in north day has returned again today hallelujah you get yourself all tied up with the daughter of man that's your problem now hallelujah and some good precious sisters and i'm gonna tell y'all brothers you ain't got to be looking nowhere we got good sisters right here in this church ones that you know faithful to the lord been taught right praise the lord keeping themselves not out there getting involved with everything they can hallelujah amen back i mean you know look uh in the bible days uh when mary was was approached by gabriel they was only looking for what one type of woman it's the truth any high because the bible promised a virgin would conceive so if she had been touched by somebody she wanted god she was not a part of that promise mary had to keep herself glory to god we have young ladies have to keep themselves young men that have to keep themselves come on somebody hallelujah yeah we still believe in keeping yourself living holy we believe in that glory to god all right all right but the sons of god went after the daughters of men that was a problem at the first junction it's a problem today but we know that there was a tremendous miracle of the animals coming to the ark and usually you would think that when those people saw the animals coming to the ark that should have been some sign that something is going on right i mean animals walking through their backyards on the way to the ark i saw i saw two yesterday i saw two of these uh last week i thought i just keep seeing two by two by two what is going on and they they end up over here at lord's ark hallelujah people knew something was happening oh jesus sometimes god can do something supernatural and people know god is in the midst but they're not able to shake themselves from that lifestyle what was that just last year we had the the tones go forth and then interpretation right there behind it right supernatural right here in the church people knew that was god and then walked right out of here and kept on sinning this is the days of noah no conviction no more it's the truth anyhow people don't have conviction anymore glory to god hallelujah all right amen and you know hear the sons of god going after the daughters of men but wait they saw the miracle of the animals coming to the ark that should have been enough to shake them when the rain came it was all over hallelujah another junction was moses with the children of israel moses was the prophet noah was the prophet in this day moses was the prophet in this second junction that brother branham brings to us and it says that you know we can see the miracles of the plagues falling in egypt glory the last plague of death we can see all of that and god anointed moses to call for each and every one of these plagues and the the miracle crossing the red sea and i love the the the the scripture amen that moses under inspiration spoke it said egyptians hallelujah a son of god our daughter god needs to hear that this morning the egyptians that you have seen today you will see them no more forever what a word coming out of that prophet's mouth because these egyptians are the ones that wreak havoc in their lives these are the egyptians are the ones that had them in bondage for a number of years maybe some of their their parents died at the hands of these egyptians but when they got a promise of thus saith the lord from a prophet that the egyptians that you see today you will see them no more forever hallelujah they didn't know how god was going to fulfill that promise through moses lips but what god did was allow them to pass through on dry ground and as those egyptians come through thinking that god was making a way for them hallelujah it was their burial place they walked through that red sea glory to god and the red sea drowned them as the children of israel come out of the red sea amen so so so here here it is uh a god god made a way for the children of israel but god destroyed their enemy some of us need our enemies destroyed glory to god because when they're destroyed you can't go call them no more glory to god now sometimes we want physical destruction i'm not saying that but sometimes god needs to destroy your emotional attachment all right all right glory to god he can do it my friend amen sometime my argument come up in a relationship and and and and it reaches breaking point we can't take no more and you're trying to fix it patch it put it all back together god did that for a reason to get you out of that mess and don't go trying to recreate the mess all right let me go on abraham and lot was the third junction abraham uh was the prophet because the word came to the prophet god came and visited abraham at his tent and uh and and the great miracle that happened there in abraham's day was the body change glory they received the promised son and and and abraham had to go through a lot of changes himself a lot of things where it looked like he was just doubting like crazy in the midst of it but but when when paul wrote about him he says uh he staggered not at the promises of god through unbelief hallelujah that's what god thinks about you don't don't listen to what the devil got to say about you but listen to what god thinks about you he's staggering not at the promise of god through unbelief he was strong in faith giving praises to god hallelujah so there in uh and abraham and lots day another miracle was locked coming out of sodom oh i thank god for that we got loved ones in sodom conditions today but you know what just like lot they have been exposed to the truth oh let me talk to you just a little bit they had been exposed to the truth so when it was time for destruction god went down to sodom and got lot in his family out of there hallelujah i got confidence in my god that he would do the same thing today because i got lovers that might be living in gomorrah sodom and gomorrah type conditions but they have been exposed to the truth and i got confidence that god would go and get them out supernaturally gotta bring them out hallelujah and they won't be like lost wife looking back in their hearts because somebody out there actually looking for a way out they don't know how they enter something they don't know how to get out supernaturally god can bring them out all right abraham and lot the third junction the fourth junction the prophet brought was elijah and the 450 prophets of baal uh elijah was the prophet at that junction the miracle uh a lot there was eight miracles in elijah's ministry and one of the greatest miracles that took place is when the fire fell uh when he said you know let's stop let's stop um uh uh being confused about who we're gonna serve choose you to stay who you're gonna serve you say say look the god didn't answer by fire let him be god and when god set down fire on the sacrifice prove that he was still jehovah god uh uh god god uh the supernaturals made known there in elijah's ministry the supernaturals may know god proven himself at that junction glory to god they destroyed those 450 prophets of baal elijah himself destroyed them all amen uh he didn't need no help he took took care of himself glory to god but here here we see that the fourth junction but the fifth junction is when jesus came to the earth and i love this amen because we we know that there were a couple prophets on the scene when jesus came to the earth first there was a prophet to introduce jesus now jesus himself was the prophet of all prophets right but john the baptist was a prophet there to introduce jesus at his first coming i need you to understand something glory to god if he had a prophet to introduce him at his first coming his ways does not change then at his second coming he will also have a prophet not prophets prophet to introduce the second coming all right now and there's scripture for that i don't know if i have a chance to get to it all today but there's scripture for that but here we know uh john the baptist is on the scene and and uh jesus also being the prophet of all prophets being introduced by john the baptist i'll talk to you all about the 39 miracles of jesus i didn't i didn't have time to go through all of them but in scripture they recorded 39 different miracles uh that that that was there and and we focused a lot of attention on some of the miracles that happened in capernaum glory to god the nobleman's son according to john four uh the nobleman's son uh was healed the man approached him say you know would you come and heal my son he's at the point of dying and would you come and he said you know look uh and unless you see signs and wonders you won't even believe he said sir i don't have time to argue with you about all that my son is dying air come down now please he said i'll tell you what you know go find your son hill based on your faith you're gonna find yourself healed just go and you'll see so the man left there and as he left jesus presence he was on his way home uh the next day somebody approached him and said hey your son has made men's your son is healed say he said oh yeah uh he was rejoicing but now what time did he start making men's and uh and i love this because when they told him the time the man went back and kept him said that's the same time that jesus told me to go home that i would find my son healed but the scripture said this way it wasn't just the time that jesus told him it was a time that jesus told them and the time that he believed the hallelujah we already know what he done said in this word but when are you gonna apply your face to what he said in his word that's when you will see your miracle not just when he said it but when he believed what he said that was the second miracle glory to god that the scripture recorded in jesus ministry the first being him turning the water into wine we focused a man on capernaum because it was also a capernaum that according to mark 1 glory glory there was a man that went to church with some unclean spirits and we brought this out that the man noticed where he went with his unclean spirits this man hung around church with unclean spirits and it was only when he came in contact with christ that these spirits amen had to lose this man and let him go and what i want you to see is that there are people that come to church hallelujah there's people that might even listen online but they still have unclean spirits so the holy ghost is trying to shine light in that area to get the person free from those unclean spirits spirits told you he said now we know who you are why are you coming to do this and come to us jesus say uh just pretty much hush stop talking and leave the man did not have the right to stay in that man after they come in contact with jesus i want to tell somebody the devil don't got a right to keep you in the condition that you're in the devil don't have a right but we're going to get rid of them unclean spirits glory glory glory there's still power in the word of god we also uh talked about there in capernaum there was a man uh who was uh in uh bondage he could not uh pick himself up and could not walk could not do anything but he heard that jesus was in town and and after all these different miracles was happening in capernaum you can imagine people's faith would begin to grow and this man had four friends that came and said you know what jesus is in town we're gonna take you to the service tonight the man was so excited i don't know how long he had been in his condition but the man was so excited he said i got to go to church it says now i can't get up and get myself dressed and go there but if y'all don't mind take me to where jesus is and those boys got grabbed the corner of the mat and each one carrying a corner four brothers brought them to the service and when they got there it was jam-packed my god it was standing room only and the man couldn't stand up he said he can't see me like this he can't do nothing for he don't even know i'm outside he said i got an idea glory to god say what's the idea my brother say take me up to the roof glory to god he said say what you gonna do to get up i'll tell you when we get there but just get me up to the roof they had to carry him up the stairs maybe try to squeeze between some people he said don't just stop at the stairs not take me to the roof hallelujah and when they got him to the roof he's saying now what next he's saying now uncover the roof take the stroll off the roof tear the roof off and then drop me down inside of his presence and when jesus looked up and saw the man coming down say what kind of faith is this it interrupted the service it changed the whole dynamics of everything that was going on jesus said what is this and then he shook everybody when he say your sins be forgiven [Music] this man said my sins i came here for healing know your sins be forgiven he had to say that for a reason because those religious leaders was there and they say now what kind of man is this only god can forgive sins why would he say something like that that your sins are forgiven and then jesus waited for them to to get that thought out hallelujah they didn't even have to stand in their mouth if they were thinking that he picked up the thought said he said he said i know what you think you want to know who can forgive sins only god can do it he's saying now would it be easier for the son of man to say your sons be your sins be forgiven or to say rise up and walk it say so that you know the son of man is here i say to you man rise up and walk and right there they begin to understand there was a dual atonement that was in christ the dual atonement of calvary was inside of christ he was not only wounded for our transgressions bruce weinick was the chastising of our pieces upon him with his christ with him but also at calvary we received our salvation he had to show this was in him in capernaum glory to god uh another thing is jesus was on his way there to capernaum again one day and there was a man that said look i'm not worthy that you come underneath my roof but if you would just speak the word only i know my servant will be made whole this centurion knew the power that was in omnipotence and what he was really saying is i speak omnipotence speak to my situation speak to my circumstance speak to my condition speak omnipotence jesus spoke to that spoke to the situation he found his servant healed at the very time that jesus spoke other thing i found about capernaum i didn't bring this to you but i was just as i was doing some research capernaum is where they needed taxes to be paid and jesus told peter go fishing and he would find a fish with some money in his mouth you wonder how did he hook the fish if the fish had money in his mouth fish really couldn't bite but it was a predestinated fish now i'm gonna tell you when we used to go fishing we used to have this what we call it the shiners or the sheds where they would run they don't bite but we get them we had a special hook with three prongs on it and we would drop that hook underneath amen the sheds and as they would run across our line we just jerk up and we would hook them in their stomachs glory to god they didn't have to bite we still get them hooked and i don't know how what peter's strategy was when he went fishing maybe he's out there just just jerking and all of a sudden he got something i got a bite no you can't have a bite if he got a coin in his mouth but you do got the fish that god predestinated for you to have because there was only one in there that thought he could swallow a coin and that one was there set for peter to pay taxes and you're sitting around wondering how you gonna pay taxes go fishing glory to god go fishing get that tax problem off your mind god go make a way out of nowhere there in capernaum they learned they paid taxes so many miracles but i i brought this point to you and i want to read it out of scripture matthew 11 verse 23. because this also was in capernaum some of the miracles in the fifth junction here in matthew 11 23 it says and thou capernaum which are exalted unto heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee have been done in sodom it would have remained until this day just keep that scripture there for a second i'd like to just refer back to an incident that i had you know i said that god is going to have a if he had a prophet at his first coming he's also going to have a prophet at his second coming one that with the specific uh ministry to introduce christ to the people john the baptist had that ministry glory to god and here the second coming we believe william branham has that had that ministry that god gave to introduce christ back to the back back back to his people now um you know different ones a few years ago began to pull away from the message because brother branham had prophesied in in los angeles it says uh um uh uh thou city of angels you're gonna be brought down just like capernaum it says repent los angeles and he was preaching the message to choose another bride and at the end of the sermon he he goes goes into this prophecy and he says shark shall be i mean wait no he didn't say it he say uh he says repent los angeles say you know you're going to be brought down into the sea just like capernaum so this one brother you know he approached me and it says the couple brothers they approached it now you know brother branham gave this prophecy but you know capernaum never went under the sea never i say you sure about that he said we couldn't find it never said okay give me a second or so give me just a just a day or so and i'll get back with you and i went and i found this scripture and thou capernaum which are exalted unto heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee have had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day i say brother you say that capernaum never went under check this scripture and see if it's been fulfilled yet he went and checked that i say okay you're right because if he would have told me that that scripture was not fulfilled then he would have been telling me jesus is a liar that's what you would have been saying because you're kind you're trying to call his prophet a liar now you've gone another level now you're saying jesus is a liar and i want you to see you got a spirit on you if you're calling jesus a liar hallelujah somebody right so so i say now check it when he checked it he oh yeah i found it you're exactly right capernaum did fall i said well now if you gotta accept that then you gotta accept what the prophet said he said thou city of angels you'll be just like capernaum now recently an article came out it's a fox news article that says that there are sharks multiplying in great numbers on the coastline of california it's just all in the news sharks are multiplied they say it's happening so fast why you think they're there why are you thinking the sharks there glory to god in noah's day and those day animals were brought to an ark and in this day sharks why why they not multiplying on the coast of florida why california because there's a prophecy waiting for los angeles that it will go under a prophet said it he said thus saith the lord that same prophet told us 87 years ago 87 years ago he said i see a great woman rising in power in the united states she will either be president or vice president a prophet spoken 87 years ago and when this when this happened people had no idea prophecy was actually being fulfilled and i need to let you know some your vote cannot stop a prophecy you're standing on the street corners with signs in your hand ain't gonna stop prophecy no matter how upset you get when god has spoke something it's got to come to pass and you don't realize everything was just being set up just being set up set up set up hallelujah god was a great chess player moving this and moving that and making this making the whole nation upset not just this nation nations people ain't got nothing to do with the us they mad about everything going on in the nation hallelujah god moving those chest pla on those chest pieces the tender hand of jehovah making his word come to pass and the people don't realize they are in the end time spirit i'm going further in this all right this next junction with here at that six junction brother branham say martin luther and john wesley was the junction and the last junction of seventh we will get to is the second coming of christ but today i want to deal with this this six junction now um i want to uh say something here martin luther and john wesley the prophet calls them reformers because they could not take the church back to the full word however we're going to discover that they're also identified as prophets because of the role they played in the full restoration of the church right and uh these were stars in the hands of jesus according to revelation 1. um uh i want to read here out of revelation 5. if yeah i think i got that uh revelation five uh i wanna show you that they're also um there's seven eyes on the lamb on the horns of the lamb and an eye is a seer glory to god so they had to be able to see something amen martin luther john wesley had to be able to see something uh and i will pick him up here in a little bit this is church history that we're getting into right now uh but this was a junction in church and christendom let me put it that way this was this was very something it was something very significant to get us to where we are right now if these things had not have happened we wouldn't be where we are right now like like brother troy was saying earlier you know when brother brother brother wesko went to new york and and heard this message uh it's no way that any of us would be here right now had he not done what he did i thank god he had a thirst in him him and sister wesker had a thirst to go find something greater and they found it and it has changed my life glory to god i'm grateful for amen my father in the gospel hallelujah thank god for him amen he went through much criticism [Applause] i mean people still don't understand but my life has been impacted by that decision because he brought truth back here glory to god and think think about the domino effect right but by by that impact of my life god was then later on in my life able to call me to the pastoral role and then through through this role i'm able to pack other people's lives it's a domino effect now now that you being impacted you got to go and pack somebody else's life glory to god here in in revelation 5 uh verse verse 5 and 6 says this glory glory glory glory says in one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld him low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain now brother branham tells us clearly this was not a physical lamb amen i noticed notice the the the way it's described the way john john describes a lamb as it had been slain this was christ right as i've been saying having seven horns a horns is the lamb's protection glory to god the horns are the lamb's protection and i was teaching on this this week amen and what we find out is that the horns represent the churches in the church ages we are the lamb's protection not only does the lamb protect us but we protect him because we choose to live this word in this dark hour the horns right so so here say the seven i uh uh having having seven horns and seven eyes now each horn had an eye and what an eye there is therefore is to see glory to god it's a prophetic anointing that comes upon somebody so that they can see the word and present it to the people glory to god that prophetic anointing came upon luther when he said the just shall live by faith that prophetic anointed allowed him to see certain things that was wrong in the catholic church luther says no way amen y'all can keep charging people to go to heaven there's no such thing as as purgatory and none of this he'd say these things are not in scripture luther start first declaring it from his pulpit he start preaching it but it wasn't enough in his church to just share it in his church he needed to impact the world with this so he sat down and he wrote himself 95 thesis and i love this because on october 31st in the 1500s luther went to the catholic church door with his letter in his hand signed by him 95 theses coming against the catholic church and all their false teachings he came against it praise god never to the catholic church towards say on this i stand you know luther didn't realize what he might have been doing at that time but god had anointed him get put that spirit on him to do that and it began to set the set of change and i'm going to show you something in the scripture here in a second let me just finish reading this uh the seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth the seven eyes are the seven spirits what happened is god according to revelation 1 chose seven men to come at seven different times in history to impact this world hallelujah the first one that came was paul right here on this chart the next one was iranians the next one was martin we got the years that they came right uh uh columba he came and then we see luther wesley branham hallelujah i want to show you that this was this this we're not a church just sitting here just to be here we're here we come back to the fullness of the word we're not just an alternative to some denomination i was listening to a brother break this down he say there are 45 000 different denominations underneath the name christianity how you know which one is right 45 000 and everybody say they believe christ god never intended for his word to get in that condition somebody went off somewhere this is why god had to send a prophet to bring us back to truth look at this so so here we see luther wesley and branham these were seven stars in the seven hands of jesus y'all just let me just teach for a little bit but these are seven stars that were in the hand their ministries were sent here by jesus they were anointed by jesus to do the things that they did they had the supernatural following their ministries but the supernatural was only to get the people's attention once god got their attention through the set but supernatural then god could share his word perfect word hallelujah you know and and i don't have time to get all this day but i'm gonna get a little bit of in wesley's day the bible talks about it call it the open door the age of the open door what was open the revelation of baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ was being restored to the church that's been lost over the day over the years churches today still battle oh we might as well talk about it churches battle on which way to baptize jesus said baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost that's exactly what jesus said but ten days after jesus said it hallelujah i don't know if peter was that far off peter goes ten days late and says be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church is still trying to figure this one out they say peter was wrong and god let him put it in the scripture peter was wrong and locked god let him put it in the scripture and then when we look at scripture we find nobody ever baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost but in the book of acts everybody baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ now nobody pick up your bible and show me where one person was ever baptized that way in the name of the father son and holy ghost even though jesus said it nobody ever did it what happened here why would peter 10 days after jesus say it going baptized in the name of the father son the holy ghost now i need you to understand i mean in the name of the lord jesus christ i need to understand this teaching got away from the church this teaching is still away from the church oh glory to god hallelujah but in this hour the open door of the revelation came back into the church now what happened with peter let's just finish this up peter understood something by revelation he said he said now jesus told us baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost but i'm telling these people you baptize the name of the lord jesus christ peter understood the name of the son i'm sharing that with you first peter understood the name of the son he walked with him he slept with him he talked with him amen he he cast out devils with them he did all he knew who the son was he said the son is the lord jesus christ it said now if the son is the lord jesus if the name of the son oh i hope you get that the name of the son not just in amen the name of the son is the lord jesus christ so they say well i also know who the name of the father is because he told me when we seen him we've seen the father so the name of the father is lord jesus christ the name of the son is lord jesus christ the name of the spirit that was in jesus christ said when i go away i'm going to send you the comforter my spirit that's the spirit of the lord jesus christ peter said i know his name now not just not just titles we're not baptizing in titles i'm baptizing in the name and you had to catch the revelation of his name his name is lord jesus christ why is it that we cast out devils in his name but can't be baptized in it i'm talking about when you're really going through in the name of jesus you are not using in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of you are not saying things like that you say in the name of jesus there's power in his name so you see look look look we got to understand those titles were just that's all they were peter caught the revelation of what it was like like me i'm i'm a father my mama's sitting here i'm a son my brother's sitting here i'm a brother i'm a brother-in-law right uh uh uh i mean i'm a pastor glory to god all those are titles if you go down somewhere and say my pastor sent me well who is your pastor that's the quest who's your pat my pastor there's a lot of pastors in the past in the plaza which one you gonna have to give the people oh hallelujah give them the name if you want something to get done you better call the name you can't use the title to get nothing done but you got to use the name and if we want to see something done by god we got to use his name his name is lord jesus christ that's why peter did that that's why peter said that and the church got away from using the name for years but in the in in in wesley's day the philadelphia and church age i'm gonna get to that maybe next week but in the philadelphia church that name began to be restored and i'm gonna tell you right now i'm gonna i'm just be honest with you i've only found churches that baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ those only church is really able to hold to a holiness standard there there there there there's some um some some apostolics that baptize the name of the lord jesus christ and they hold to a holiness standard now there's some other apostolics that ain't ain't doing that amen glory to god they're not holding to a whole understanding but it's usually people that's baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they still got that there's a whole there's something connected there right something connected and i need you to understand that that revelation was restored and now when we baptize and and i want to encourage if you have not been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i want to encourage you to do that we'll baptize you right away if you want to get baptized we'll baptize you right away the scripture tells you that peter gave him on on the day of pentecost he says repent that's the first thing repent tell god you're sorry for every sin that you ever committed you have a personal talk with your god lord i repent i'm sorry ask him to come into your heart and and make a difference in your life right lord i'm sorry for the sins that i've committed and i can't do this on my own i need you to come into my heart and make a difference and then he says be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then after you've done what god told you to say then you shall be filled with the gift of the holy ghost and not only that not only it won't just stop with you if you get things right he said his promise is unto you and to your children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call your children will be covered if you would get right all right let me read a little bit junction of time paragraph e46 and i want to come to a couple other scriptures here in a second this is important so important what happened here amen and uh in the ministries of lutheran the ministries of wesley so important to christendom it sets us up for where we are right now do you realize before luther nailed the 95 thesis you were either catholic or you were dead if you if you did not if you did not follow catholicism they would kill you but luther protested that's how he became protestants because he protested what the catholic church was teaching knowledge that he protested but he lived through the protests hallelujah anybody there was many others rose up during that time protests and a lot of them lost their lives but there was an anointing on luther he was a star in the hands of jesus for the fifth church age all right look at this this this quote says what happened signs and wonders took place what happened the moon began to cry the sun closed its eyes and began to weep and it went in such distress until it had convulsions and turned like dripping blood sure it did when it seen the creator of heaven and earth refused by the earth and so much sin he couldn't get into heaven and dying as a mediator between god and man stand between heavens and earth the sun the sun couldn't stand it said i will not shine no more the stars i can't look at this here nature is having a problem with our savior being on the cross it says the earth said i can't stand it and it had a nervous prostration and belch forth rocks out of the earth the the the miraculous took place so he's talking about an earthquake that took place at the time jesus you know was dying since then miraculous took place it was the end of the road sin had rained until the cross i thank god for that sin had rain until the cross this was a junction right but sin was paid for there oh my the earth shook so hard till it throw rocks out of its ground and hung it into the heels amen even shook so hard to the dead rose out of the grave talk about a nervous prostration and the sun began to have convulsions and went out miraculous took place hallelujah always does at the junction look what taken place with uh with that and that was the that was only preparing for this think about all of that now think about everything we just talked about at jesus death that was only preparing for this he says uh they went out into the dark ages now now now just just you know follow with me on this on this little chart here that i have to my right praise god paul uh in his day it was a lot of light the gospel showing that it was a lot of light the truth of the gospel going forth and they were walking and that just a little sliver of darkness first age paul was the first messenger then an iranians comes then you can see a little bit more darkness coming in false teachings right a little bit more darkness they have they're still walking in a little light but a little bit more darkness then you get the pergamus where martin is there's even some more darkness comes in right and just a little light when you get to columbus the fourth church age that actually was what was considered the dark ages notice it's very very dark in columbus just a little bit of light there that was even in history it's called the dark ages hallelujah but after at 1500 years of darkness now here comes luther and he begins to add a little bit more light the just shall live by faith and all this this stuff that y'all teaching catholic church is wrong it's against the word of god he said i'm going back to the just shall live by faith not by all these things that y'all got people doing in church hallelujah a little bit of light began to come back when luther came on the scene i want to tell you right then restoration of what was lost from the days of paul the restoration began to come back in now luther couldn't take us all the way back hallelujah was still baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost right he didn't have the full truth but then wesley comes along and that revelation of baptizing the name of the lord jesus christ is coming back into the church and they're fighting to keep that revelation and then finally we get to this age the latest in age now this is a very dark age brother brandon when he first drew this i want to tell you i'm not just teaching that and just putting that on the wall just to have something i want to tell you an experience brother branham taught this at his church taught drew up the chart like this on a white board a blackboard and uh and and taught it to his church at the end of the service when he finished talking about this agenda when not when he talked about it he did not put branham in the name up there the way i put brother devin is the one built this brother devon put branham he put malachi 4 i believe is what he put there just malachi because that's where the promise of this come but but we understand my revelations brother branham when he when he drew this out of this church do you realize at the end of him teaching this the angel of god came into the church to the back wall of the church and drew the whole thing on the back wall supernaturally now let me ask you wouldn't you want to know something about if god vindicating that way when you want to know what was in that book how many other books is the angel writing on the back wall of a church that's why we quote the church ages around here god supernaturally vindicated that this was truth now let me keep reading they went out into the dark ages 1500 years wish we had time but we're pressed i want to get out at 12 and uh says coming through there in the darkness wish we had time to go into into the time what happened in the time of wesley and luther that sixth time that there was a change come when the church was liberated from darkness and and was brought into the marvelous light of the gospel again we need the church god got people in church bound but the church needs to be liberated so that they can see the truth of the word of god oh it takes more than just a spirit side you want to worship both in spirit and in truth you got to have a revelation of why you worship see at the beginning abel had a revelation of why he worshipped cain did not have that revelation even though it was given the cain he still didn't have it look at this let me keep going signs and wonders oh god how i know men stood and divine healing and signs and wonders took place is between the sacrifice and the second coming and look what taken place then when john wesley preached the gospel he was kicked out of churches and things and people until people fell in the floor and they poured water in their face and john wesley's day the holy ghost began to slay people in the spirit john wesley's teaching go to methodist church today there is no slain in the spirit there's none of that but this happened in john what the holy ghost began to come back into the church a restoration began to happen until we got to pentecost and and a sousa street and what happened at asusa street what a wonderful wonderful restoration of the gifts of the spirit back in the church but you know they couldn't even keep it right they they got their division happening at souza street the the you had you had the church of god weren't going in one direction and um the assemblies of god church of god went one way as simply as god went the other way it's the truth anyhow divided on a line a racial line and the holy ghost don't divide on racial lines it's the truth anyhow oh my my my my my i thank god to come back to the truth i i i i i i i i i've said it before and i'll say it again this is not an ethnic church i go to a black church no you don't you go to god's church this this this church has come back to the truth god don't look at our colors like that we look at colors like that and i'm gonna tell you even kids put them on a playground little children put them on a playground together they don't look at any of that that stuff is taught to people but the holy ghost got to get that out of you praise god we recognize god and each other hey hallelujah i i've never seen it like this i've been around churches for a long time but i can i can hallelujah i just i can just go by anywhere in the world and feel at home anywhere in the world hallelujah the brother was telling me you know there are certain places that uh they would drive to years ago and you know and you know have problems the racism and stuff it's alive it's alive but there's certain places that they they would go to and the brother tell them to say now i don't want you to stay in a hotel when you come i want you to stay in my house and the reason the pastor will tell them i said because when you go to hotel they they treat you different because of your skin color he says but i want you to stay in my house and say now stay on the phone with me let me know where you at because i'm going to wait up for you to get here i'm not going to let you come to this town where i know there's problems here right i want to wait till you get here and and they say stay up one o'clock two o'clock in the morning driving i'm waiting on your brother where you at right now where you at right i'm just waiting on you they say no don't stop at that hotel now keep coming keep coming and sit there and wait and god bless you brother i'm so glad you made it welcome right to his house sent him to the pulpit to preach the gospel see this message produces that type of love it produces the love of god it's back to the original hallelujah go all over the world i've been to other countries and i and i i've seen people you know go to countries and and um you know and and and they didn't know who they was meeting i don't think i have one in in here um they didn't know who they was meeting they just go to a city and uh and they get there off the off the airplane and like lord i don't i don't even speak the language here in this car in this country i don't know i don't know uh where where i'm at i don't know what's what what i'm doing but i'm just standing at the airport and they stand at the airport and they stand there like this they just stand in the airport like that then all of a sudden somebody ease up on them god bless you brother hey hey i know who i'm supposed to meet now god bless you because they knew what that meant glory to god sometimes airport they have your name right they have your name somebody holding up a sign with you with your name and you know to go to that person but this one they had they had my name you understand i'm identified with the truth i seen my name when john saw his name everything in heaven heard him shouting and screaming when we see our name when the truth has been made known to us hallelujah changes this church anywhere in the world anywhere in the world i can go like that thank god for this truth that he's restored luther was the beginning of that let me just read a little bit about him and and i'll i'll bring this to a close today um oh my i had a scripture that i wanted to read but i first let me just tell you this the first three ages ephesus smyrna pergamos and also thiatera the four first four ages was the open door to the false vine that means open door to false revelation but in the last three ages luther wesley and william branham that was the open door to the truth being restored right and so what what happened in luther's ministry was actually the beginning of truth coming back to the church now i'll i'll have to save that scripture for next week i won't worry about it now let's read revelation 3 1-6 i'll show you where this is all of this is in in the bible i'm not just making this up but this is luther's day the church of sardis luther was the angel or the messenger to the church of sardis sorry this means aim that relax right oh no no no no no no that's ephesus i think england sardis was um oh my forget now but i know it talked about uh people that were in slavery and uh they were coming out they were coming out of that that slave slave type condition i forget i'll get that for you but uh but here it says and unto the angel of the church and sardis right this is writing to luther these things saith he that have the seven spirits of god it was the same it was the same spirit manifested seven different times upon seven different men seven angels to the seven churches seven messengers all those sevens uh makes makes it a complete work from god and the seven stars and i know thy works that thou has a name that thou livest in our dead now why do they have a name that they live but we're dead the name that they live is that they broke away from catholicism and then the lutheran now luther did not start the lutheran church it was the people that came after luther that started the lutheran church but he broke away he had an anointing to break away from catholicism when they went back into denomination that's when they died again you understand and when we go back into denominational thinking that's where we die once god sets us free from denominational thinking we want to stay free hallelujah glory to god look at this he says i know thy works that thou hast the name thou livest and are dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found our works perfect before god you got to be you got to be on your feet watch watch the devil always got something trying to trick you with so be watchful and strengthen the things that remain i if i can just get that to somebody there's something that still remains strengthen that then you come out of that condition that you're in it says remember therefore how that has received and hurt and hold fast brother brother brother brother troy told us that a few weeks ago hold fast right it says hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know that hour i will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy now those few names are people that decide to live right live holy don't get your garment spotted by the things of the world amen he says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he the hath and they let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches and i want you to notice that the sp in this in this passage of scripture revelation two and three it always ended he the half an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches god was speaking to the true church and to the false church they're both churches it started in the garden of eden abel had a true church cain had a false church and once you recognize i'm gonna tell you how easy it is for you to recognize me in the false church if it's a denomination out of the 45 000 false why why why because they won't accept the fullness of the word of god and that's why jesus said in the last church age it says i stand at the door and knock i need you to get this it wasn't just an invitation to come into your heart personally jesus is trying to say i've been kicked out of my own church y'all i don't know if we get it jesus has been kicked out of his own the church that he died for is no longer welcoming him when they leave the word they left jesus when people were i i know great ministers even in this town got up to preach at a funeral took his big old bible up there i thought for sure there's a thousand people at the funeral thousands i said man this man lord give him something to say lord i'm just praying god give him something to say lord lord please then i heard him say some things i don't know read something brother some things i just don't know i just don't know my cousin is my cousin that died say something please get the attention something i just don't know i don't know why a brown cow can eat green grass and produce white milk i just don't know close the bottle and set down [Music] thousands had his roll bone i mean he looked like he was coming to do something so please use this man lord and that's all you got to say and you got a doctor behind you in front of your name that's all you can say say lord have mercy if this is what the church is coming and think about if that's what we ate at a funeral what are people eating every sunday morning how can they have any strength how can they have strength eating like that and then and then then you know i heard some people say boy didn't he preach that's what you call preaching it's a shame where the church is today thank god we've come out let me read just these last few quotes and i'll end it here i'm in the sardisian age oh my reason age it's recorded of dr martin luther and soros history volume 3 page 406 that he was a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter and one person endowed with all nine nine gifts of the spirit luther endowed with all nine gifts of spirit there was a time that luth was preaching in the catholic church and he said i wasn't even saved i wasn't even a christian but standing behind a pulpit preacher now i want to tell you something there's many preachers standing behind the pulpit right now not even saved but luther recognized it and he came to sense with it he came to grips with it we need some other folk to come to grips with it says what stirred his heart by the holy ghost and which was the little green shoot that signified that truth was coming back to the church as it was known at pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works i recognize that dr luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth of the word and what that is the just shall live by faith and brother branham using the title of justification you need to understand if you have sin if you have walked away from the blood once you repent there is nothing against you when you repent when you repent you know what justification is is just as if you never did it once you repent preach only justification but that was his major theme is indeed it had to be for that as a basic doctrine and truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of god who revived revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we were we are to go from faith to faith his marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truths show him to be a great man in the word yet i say again as to historians god used him to bring the people god's standard against works the just shall live by faith says now as i mentioned already this age has been called by historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it was it had to be that that for that for martin luther was a reformer not a prophet now i know the history books call him a prophet but it doesn't mean that the history books is right but there's no record of martin luther qualified as a true prophet of god in the grand scriptural sense amen of that word he was a fine teacher with some of the manifestations of the spirit in his life and we praise god for that so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like apostle paul who was both apostle and prophet now he had non-spiritual gifts manifested in his life you can tell the supernatural was with luther uh i don't know too many people today that got all nine spiritual gifts manifesting in their life all nine this had to be some some man of god he was a real man of god god used his life he was a star in the hand of jesus god used his life in order to bring truth back to us it was the open door for truth to come back luther was a part of that process so we don't discredit that we thank god for it this is why the prophet said he was a part of the sixth junction luther and wesley so part one i just want to just talk i talked a little bit about luther next time i want to talk about wesley they were both a part of this junction can i just maybe leave you with a scripture oh my let me just let me let me see here i'm gonna leave this scripture with you and i won't i won't explain it i'll explain it next week but here in revelation um oh my let me see here revelation 14 verse 6 to 12. their ministries the ministry of luther the ministry of wesley the ministry of william branham found right here in the book of revelation chapter 14. verse 6 says and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach uh luther was this angel with the everlasting gospel to preach says preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation in kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the foundation and the fountains of the water brother branham clearly tells us that this was the message of justification that luther brought if if it takes a profit to write the scripture it will also take a profit to interpret the scripture a prophet told us exactly what that verse meant and where people are looking for these things to be fulfilled i'm here to tell you it's already come already happen and we're living in it right now god bless you god bless you we'll leave it right there and i'll pick it up on next week amen let's pray father lord just taken time to go through these junctions very important for us to understand why we are where we are we're not here uh by happenstance our journeys through the various churches that we've gone through in this church there are some that were catholic some that were methodists some that were baptists even brother troy made the statement earlier we're not we're not faulting people for that we were there we were there but when you open up our understanding the truth god we can't go back to those things again we're going to walk in the fullness of the word of god as it has been brought to us help us to see this this journey we can see how you have moved in generations past god we can see in scripture these are things that were uh not not there just because but lord you prophesied that they would be there and and we see it manifested we can look back and see how it was all manifested god but help us to catch now where we are that's where these junctions are leading us to is going to show us where we are even right now god we got to make decisions we got to make choices they're hard choices they're difficult choices i think about somebody like ruth who had to make a very very difficult choice she was brought to a junction in her life but she chose to go with a mother-in-law your god will be my god your people will be my people where you die i will die she chose that and and then realized that through her choice she would be a part of the lineage of the lord jesus christ it's not a mistake that we make these choices but i pray lord if there's any here that's heard the word and maybe they realize that lord they need to come to a place of true and sincere repentance i pray god right there in their heart that they would make a man a decision to want to serve you that they begin to talk to you in in a way father that only you can hear and understand lord may they know that once they have truly repented of their sins god not to man but to you once they've truly repented god they stand justified just as if they never did it i thank you lord for what you've done here today and what you'll continue to do thank you for all that has happened father in this service and i know that you're you're you're doing great things sometimes great things happen in quietness so move by your spirit god is our prayer it's in jesus name that we pray amen and amen can we give the lord jesus a hand of praise [Applause] just stand with me and we'll sing a song here turn the service back over to brother smiley full light oh come where the dew drops off mercy are bright shine all around us shine all [Music] around us by day and by oh jesus he's the light of the world hallelujah we'll walk in the light brother smiling yes we will walk [Music] our oh jesus the light of the world amen let's get a lot of hand of praise this morning amen amen amen how many how many hearts just burning i feel like the scripture did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us about a way amen i tell you what we we serve a real wonderful god this morning you know just one thing uh and and we're gonna let us uh get out of here let's remember our combined service at six o'clock in boynton beach and uh you know one thing we we when you get down to that junction you don't you don't want to ignore those things i thought that was a real profound statement hey man when you get there you you come to a place where you got to make choices you got to make not any choice you got to make sure you're making the right choice the right decisions when you get down to that spot is that right but it's not something that you can ignore it's something that i feel is important so we appreciate the lord we appreciate the pastor this morning hey manny man what a what a what a sermon you know i i'll say this and and we'll let us go we take for granted right we we take for granted a lot of times the things that uh we hear like it's just some everyday something but it's not it's not when he was talking about water baptism and and the correct understanding i i remember i always get myself in trouble i remember at a family function one time and uh we we got quite a few uh older uncles that's uh uh well pastors and preachers and things of that nature we got into a discussion it got heated it really got heated because i was trying to share with them the true understanding of water baptism one was pentecostal and one was baptist and so i kind of got labeled as being the bad guy if anybody if anybody come in contact with me see you've been hanging around gina husband you know but it's not it's not that it's it's that i thank god you know that there is a truth right matthew 28 19 in acts chapter 2 that's a real truth and i thank god that we understand the truth because i believe that god always wants us not to walk in error but in truth is that right amen amen let the uh brothers prepare themselves to dismiss this morning but we appreciate the lord just continue to keep brother jack in prayer amen and just continue to keep us both in prayer as we uh prepare at the end of the month to go to uh arkansas help me somebody amen arkansas uh to do uh a week uh almost a week long i was talking with him this morning i said man we gonna be up there five days amen so let's re we want to um uh just kind of prepare ourselves and uh i'm just asking for special prayer i've kind of uh i kind of been sitting up sitting back and sitting sitting around a little bit for the kind of reviving myself uh for the last four five months and uh i kind of i'm just kind of starting to feel a lean like it's just kind of my time to kind of start getting out so y'all just continue to keep me in prayer amen so from time to time if you don't see me on sundays it's it's i'm trying to be trying to do the work of the lord i was just thinking we got such a good team you know here amongst the brethren and i appreciate i appreciate that so y'all just really [Music] pray for me that god will direct me and continue to open up uh doors for us amen that we can go in and just express jesus christ not to be smart or anything so will you do that for me amen let's buy heads for word of prayer grace's father we just thank you and we praise you god for uh brother jack this morning and lord god for the for the word that we heard he was just ending a description in revelation chapter three uh that talks about he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church and i think that that's that's that's vital um you know because the scripture says that they have eyes to see and can't see and ears to hear and can't hear so uh blessed is our ears this morning we thank god for blessed ears and uh we thank god for the comfort that comes through the word of god we pray that you just continue to give him strength lord you gotta minister tonight at the fellowship meeting amen may you may you use him to uh start
