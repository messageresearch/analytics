down from uh orlando amen to just be in fellowship with us and we're so happy amen to have him we we really enjoyed uh the service this morning and if you didn't get a chance to listen to it i advise you to go back and and hear amen the services he was just he got to that scripture where he talked about the hittites and the uh jebusites and the perizzites and all they say well what a connection to what brother troy was talking about on last week as he began to define what they what they were that was on the mountain you know the spirits that was behind them i said what a connection god god know how to god know how to uh confirm things right and uh you know just just a real wonderful sermon there and i just i know that you'll be blessed amen by it uh i want to um uh before i give the announcements did anybody have a song that they wanted to share today amen did anybody have if not i will sing but anybody got one okay just want to make sure all right all right let's just make a few announcements here um first we want to uh extend some happy birthdays we got uh a number of birthdays coming up this week brother caleb a man wesco will be celebrating a birthday on tomorrow amen uh praise the lord amen for that uh thank god for giving him another year brother joseph a man morales he's going to be celebrating a birthday also on tomorrow and we thank god for giving him another

birthday so amen i'll be celebrating another year as well so we we thank god amen for all things um as um i was just uh mentioning amen we want to continue to do the services the way that we have been doing them i had been just praying about some changes that i wanted to make and uh just waiting on the lord and and i felt this morning the lord just gave me a piece of my spirit just keep doing things the way that we are doing it and um i believe i know that we have had a lot of things happen and i want to i want to encourage this if if you're sick it's okay to stay home if you're sick please call for prayer amen we want to pray for you if you are sick if you're around somebody that's sick amen it's okay to stay home and stream the service you know because we don't want to open uh things up here right so that's why god has been keeping us we haven't had any anything you know come amongst us and we're grateful for that we've had around us but not in us and uh and we thank god for that so so we're asking that everyone just continue to do what you're doing but please use every precaution and if you are sick please let us know because we want to keep you in prayer uh we have been seeing the mighty hand of god touching people i mean i'm talking after prayer i'm talking about after they were diagnosed with with being positive we have prayed at a distance we sent the words and we see results right so we know god answers prayer we know god answers prayer and with every i mean sometimes we give the devil just too much credit we want to stop and give god some credit god is moving in the midst of all of this right god is touching people god is healing people in the midst of all of this hallelujah amen amen amen i heard this week about a particular sister that you know that had contracted the virus and she's kind of taking care of herself uh you know and being a nurse and everything and i think she probably knows some things that maybe others don't know but she uh she she's taking care of herself and but that lady when i heard about the case i remembered some of the things that that sister did for this church even though she don't come here i remember the things that she did and i said the best thing that i could do right now is lord stand in the gap for her because you know it's some things that she did at a certain season the reason that we are even in here is some of the things that she did god remember things like that so if we have an opportunity to stand in the gap god remember what she did remember the seed that she planted god we rebuked this thing in the name of jesus right hallelujah right so we you know you you can you can stand and pray and you know and just kind of feel what they're feeling and and expect to see results hallelujah we expect that so so i'm just you know i'm just i'm just thanking god for for all things uh uh we so we'll continue to do what we have been doing a man uh now we won't have um um we won't have friday night service but i i am there is something that i want to do and i will get word out i don't want to necessarily announce it but i will get word out uh something that's specifically for our youth that i want to do so uh i will let you all know about that coming up in the month of august and uh i know that everybody got plans and you know i understand that but if uh we'll work with what we got but something that the lord just put in my heart this morning amen and we gonna do it we're gonna do it by god's grace uh i want to thank the lord for all the equipment that he provided us during this time you all saw the the new microphone system that was used last week and um also uh the new projector was installed a man uh this week and and you can see our cameras and everything are placed appropriately so uh god met the needs that we had and i'm so grateful uh for uh the lord doing next and i thank you all for your contributions to to help us get to where we are i i feel i mean

lives he lives yes i can face tomorrow [Music] is gone [Music] i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just [Music] because amen is he alive in your heart amen as they continue to play that softly let's just by our hearts heavenly father we counted a privilege that we could gather together and assemble around your word i'm reminded in your scripture where the bible says where the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered together father we come under expectation this afternoon that you would come and minister to each and every need father you know the desires of the hearts of your people and the lord i pray father that you would just honor their request may you meet those needs exceed expectation may you continue to put a a protection round about them may you be with them the lord and father i pray that you just remove any distractions from their lives that would prevent them from giving you their best from worshiping you and glorifying you and father as we turn our attention to the preaching of the word father even i myself am under expectation i yield myself as a servant unto you deliver the tool that you can use that you can be a blessing to your people to god speak to us now for we'll be careful to give you the praise and glory that you alone are worthy of and the bride says amen god bless you saints amen certainly good to be in the house of the lord if you wouldn't mind grabbing your bibles turn with me to exodus chapter 17 bring you greetings from from my family children doing very well by god's grace it's amazing how fast eight months go it's it's really amazing and um i was telling jack earlier that um one of the benefits of being able to work from home as in in my case um is just seeing kind of that growth and that development and um you know from them being an infant to where they're really you know you could keep them in one spot and they stay in one spot now you look away in just a split moment and they're not in that same spot so and they're just kind of moving around and their personalities are beginning to come through and it's just it's just uh remarkable and as i was saying previously you know there's you know there's that scripture in isaiah where the bible says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and um my wife and i we've patiently waited for these little blessings and to know that they've now come into our lives there's that renewed strength that we we we're experiencing and um it's just uh joy unspeakable and um like i was just i previously mentioned that um you know it's one thing when you pray about something and the next day you get it you know but when you've waited for a while right you know that appreciation you know um just you know you're you're much you're you're delicate in how you handle the blessings of god because you know it was through a lot of you know alone nights of prayer a lot of toils a lot of tears and and so we're just we're just appreciative of the blessings of god and we appreciate your prayers because many of you have been on the journey with us and um and just to be here it's just really awesome so we um given the circumstance we couldn't bring them i couldn't come down with them but i trust there'll be other opportunities for me to come down with them so but then nonetheless they send their greetings and um i do have some pictures after church so in case anybody's interested it's funny because i never thought i'd be kind of that father i never thought i'd be that father it it bothered my mind when like you got a lot of pictures of your kids you know the first couple of hours my kids was just like you know constantly just take so i i got tons of pictures you know it's it's it's it changes you you know and it's a it's a good feeling so we just we just thank god for that amen all right well praise the lord turn with me you're there already so exodus uh chapter 17. we'll have one we'll read one verse and then we'll go from there and then um and we'll just kind of trust the lord in all of this so exodus 17 verse 8 and it reads then came amalek and fought with israel in rephadel we read it again then came amalek and fought with israel in referendum amen may the lord have his blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated um i'll also try to draw i also read this last um the last two verses of the same chapter in exodus 17 the last two verses and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nisi which for he said because the lord has sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation so so we're by god's grace going to try to link these together but i wanted to kind of set the stage because it just seems um just out of nowhere where the scripture is is being called out then came amalek um and fought israel so that that word then is a transitional word right so something occurred then this happened right so then emalek came so we'll come back to that thought um we'll come back to that thought as we kind of build on this but i want to set the stage of where israel is at in their journey so israel had been in egypt for quite some time and god had heard the cry of israel and um had seen like i was saying before their affliction and has heard their cry and know of their sorrows and so god was acquainted with the suffrage of his people and um and and and so he looked to moses um to uh to utilize him as a vessel to go down towards egypt and bring his people out and so um as the story would go um you know moses uh uh uh you know yielded himself as a vessel to go and invade egypt as the prophet would uh explain it it was a one-man invasion now let me kind of help kind of set the stage for you this is a one-man invasion with his wife and kid and they're they're invading one of the most powerful nation on the earth at that time but prior to that moses had just come into contact with god so nothing could stand in god's way so if you happen to be a bystander as you were watching moses you know and his wife and his child on a donkey and they're going back to egypt where he left he left egypt he just came from egypt and now he's going back to egypt moses where are you going i'm going to invade egypt all right what else can you really say so moses was going down to egypt following god's strict order because he knew that god was in control of this because you know let me just kind of drop this i remember jesus said ah you know he says he says i'll see you on the other side so no matter what the storm did or what no matter what came through no matter how bad the storm was jesus said i'll see you on the other side so i don't care about the storms of life he made a promise to me and i'm holding on to that promise if he says i see you on the other side then that tells me i made it to the other side amen so here was moses going down to egypt and god was already working on the scene because moses uh pharaoh's heart hardened against what moses was trying to do and god was trying to prove his people because the prophet says that pharaoh was actually a tenderhearted man and so he was probably in a position where he was willing to let the children of israel just go but you know situation occurred in which god hardened his heart and so he held the children of israel back and there were many plagues that you know that played the nation and you know it's interesting because you know sometimes you just kind of you don't know where people's minds are at because you know when moses went down there he you know he he had to stick in his hand and you know he he says you know uh he threw his stick down and and the and and the people won't impress because when the stick turned into serpents they weren't impressed and so when and when when janice and jabras they came they they threw their stick down too and their stick turns into serpents as well so moses said swallowed them up so they're saying look the same power you have we have like all right and so god would bring a plague in egypt bring a plague in egypt would turn the water there into blood right would bring frogs in the nation genus and genbrans did the same thing they turn water into blood it's in the scripture to show that they could do that too their people's already suffering and yet they want to do the same thing to show you're not any better at the expense of their own people so you have plague after plague god's punishing the nation and the the the folks on the opposite side saying look that that's that's that's just that's just a fancy magic trick we could do the same thing you could bring frogs we bring frogs too right yeah it doesn't make sense to me you turn water into blood we could do the same thing too we'll do it yeah rather than gleaning what the lessons is from god they want to show that hey we could we can make bad happen too so things kind of build up a little bit and finally it gets to the point where um the deaf angel was getting ready to make its round and i'm kind of setting the stage to how we got here so bear with me and as the death angel was making this round moses told the children of israel put a blood on the post and lentil yes and when the death angels see that blood he says i will pass over you amen so it didn't matter how good of a preacher you were it didn't matter how good of a singer you were it didn't matter all all that she knew it didn't matter if you knew moses or not know moses it didn't matter if you knew aaron or didn't know aaron all you knew was that i had to put the blood on the pulse and lentil because the death angel is going to make its way around the country and it's not going to discriminate when i see the blood i will pass over you so i know back then believers i don't know if i was back then i would have taken that really seriously i would have made sure that the blood was visible in my door i wouldn't have left any room for guessing i don't want a bunch of death angels congregating some of some i wonder if that's a mistake i want it so that way a mile away you can see that the blood's been applied i'll be painting my door so red son go back can you see it i can see it go back a little bit further can you see it i can see it go back some more i want to make sure that there's no doubt that you know that there's a son of god there's a family of god in which the token is applied amen then the nation was brought to its knees when the death angel made its way throughout the country can you just imagine what an experience it must have been like for the children of israel cradling their kids behind closed doors and then the blood the token being applied and to hear the cries of those around you the agony and the pain they woke up the next day and pharaoh had enough because even his own son was taken he said y'all gotta go so israel was coming out of egypt but here's the thing even though you come out of the world it doesn't mean that the world will not try to influence you and so as egypt as israel left egypt pharaoh probably thought about it contemplated and he started to choose some chariots to go after israel and as they went after israel can you just imagine this i want you to i want to paint this picture you had the the world's most powerful military with the with their elite soldiers chasing after a group of believers what were they afraid of they have witnessed the power of god come on and they gather not not just uh foot soldiers but chariots i mean that's kind of like that's uh that's like that's your top military you know uh uh uh equipment that you use to go to battle to go to war and they were gonna do serious damage and so they were in hot pursuit after the children of israel and um as they were pursuing after them the children of israel realized that they were in hot pursuit so they left egypt they left the world but the influence of the world is not following them to bring them back into egypt that's the reason why a lot of young christians when they first come in they're so excited but they're still struggling with the influence of the world because saints says no i've invested too much to make you what you are and now you're leaving me i'm not going to make it that easy on you but if you're an elect of god if you're chosen of god and god's called you to where you are now there's not a thing the devil can do that god can't undo so israel is now being chased two million people is now being chased by the egyptians and they're in hot pursuit after them chariots of horses it was the bible says and he took 600 chosen chariots in chapter 14 in exodus and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them chosen chariots he chose like one brother says you know satan chooses certain demons to go after you your your fight is different than my fight your devil is different than my devil that's the reason why i could never be in a position to criticize anyone because what you may have trouble overcoming might be different than what i'm having trouble overcoming because the devil knows exactly how to kind of your weak spots so he chooses 600 chosen chariots in all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh the king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with a high hand and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried unto the lord now think about the situation that they're in the children of israel had just left egypt and now before them is the red sea how are you going to cross 2 million people over the red sea behind them is the egyptian so god's saying you can't go back you have no choice but to go forward but there's a dilemma in front of you so now what are you going to do and you can't stand still the egyptians behind them the red seas before them they can't go back and they they don't know how they're going to handle what's in front of them what a predicament when i when when i first got converted i was in i was in a pickle i know i couldn't go back i didn't know what i didn't know what later laid ahead of me there was a lot of uncertainty but the one thing i knew i trusted god because the same god that brought me out is the same god that could bring me in god doesn't go through all the trouble to bring you out and just to leave you by yourself and so the bible goes on and says and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord sometimes it's not for you to come up with a solution don't try to figure it out sometimes you just gotta reach a point in your life and say lord i'm gonna stand still and wait for you to give me an answer to my prayers what am i supposed to do i'm in a perplexed situation i'm in a stage of confusion and the thing about our god he is not the author of confusion god is a god of order and no matter how complicated the situation is there's definitely a way out of it and god told moses we're gonna press forward there's a body of water in front of us he says we're gonna move forward right no matter what lays before you the circumstances of life no matter what you're coming across whether it's family situation job situation whatever you're mentally going through spiritually going through economically going through you're going to press forward i rather deal with the uncertainty that lays ahead of me than the devil that's behind me because the bible says be ye certain of god every step that i take i'm taking it in faith i left egypt there's nothing for me there now the bible says in the lord to them to moses why cry unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward now they came across the red sea and the bible says this and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel because it was an angel that was before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them i've been in situations before brother well i thought my boys had my back and i found out i was the only one standing by myself yeah i see that two o'clock i showed up i was the only one there i figured they were late they never showed up but let me tell you something this scripture is the epitome that you never stand by yourself and that god has your back that's the reason why i'm not worried about my past i'm only only focused on what lays ahead of me he said brother gene you did this you said this and you acted this way that was all in the past it's underneath the blood if god can't see it then i can't [Music] so i press forward amen because he has my back and that's the only thing that that's the only thing that guy's required that you press forward no matter the adversity you press forward no matter the uncertainty you press forward no matter if you have the answers or not you press forward no matter what the challenge is you press forward you keep pressing forward keep pressing forward and god says there was a strong east wind that came overnight and that parted the the red sea and created a wall can you just i just sometimes i visualize myself there to really have meaning to what i'm reading this massive sea this wall that's built between like a wall of water that's built and a clear passage to cut through for two million people and because the cloud and the pillow fire was behind them the egyptian couldn't make out what was going on and god is and moses is standing there leading the people in every elect every two million every one was accounted for and those walls of judgment held back until every elect made it through you can't get there until i get there you can shout the victory once you get to the other side but you got to wait for me because i'm still part of the family we're all in this together like i was telling the church previously i said look when god took a family portrait i was right there i could show you look at my face right there you know how you when you tell when you try to take a family portrait there's a lot of people you want to make sure that your face is sewn so you can say yeah that's me right there i'm part of that family i'm part of the great family of god you're part of that family so god is taking inventory that's what the book of numbers are god is taking inventory and i've been accounted for you've been accounted for before you were born god says i've already accounted for you and the way that the way that that's been paved for the elect seat of god is only for the elect so the so the egyptians thought they were just you know they're like yeah we could cut through this too all all of the israelites they made it through and um the egyptians try to cut through they miss swimming practice and so you know they thought they'd be okay here they are walking through this in the water come crashing in with such force how dare they go down the path that's been ordained for god's elect right amen that path is for you brother brahm says if the he says the only way the devil could actually get to you he has to go he has to be baptized sealed go through the whole process and at which point he says you could call him brother [Music] but until then that path is only reserved for god's elect so the children of israel they made it to the other side and in chapter 15 verse 1 they sang moses then saying moses the children of israel this song unto the lord and they spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he had triumphed gloriously the horse in the right and his riders he has thrown into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he's become my salvation they started having a jubilee let me tell you when you've gone through a trial and you come through a sunday service and what a week it's been and no one knows what you're going through and you're singing and you're shouting you're not impressing the people around you you're giving god the glory because only you know the week that you've gone through you wouldn't be sitting here if it wasn't for god who carried you through so when i go to church i have no one to impress no one to show but to say lord i'm only here because of your grace when i lift up my hands and i close my eyes i'm not looking to impress people i may not look the best when i'm worshiping but i'm giving god the best of my worship because i know what my week has been like i know the conversations i've been a part of i know the trials i know the strife i know the challenges and for me to have made it through that week it's only by god's grace alone [Music] moses understood that his sister miriam in verse 20 miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbers and with dances and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he had triumphed gloriously gloriously his the horse and his writers hath he triumphed uh has he thrown into the sea yes they're just man what what church services it must have been they took out the tambourine they started beating the tambourine they started singing they started shouting they could care less who saw who didn't see who who was talking because the people that talk and they're the ones that should be singing and worshiping too and here's the thing while all this jubilee was happening the devil was stewing up he was mad what a victory the church of god just came out of and in the middle of the worship literally in the same verse down in the same chapter in the same chapter moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of sure and they went there three days in the wilderness and found no water so they just come out of their eyes god is good god is great praise the lord the devil comes around smack you in your face you gotta you you always gotta be on guard i say lord thank you for such a wonderful church service i need you on monday morning the devil don't like sunday services he doesn't like it when you beat him over the head he doesn't like when you slap him around he's waiting for that opportunity and those sooner when they came out of this high point this edification they're so excited they're so victorious the bible says in verse 23 and when they came tomorrow they could not drink of the waters of mary for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called was mara and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink talk about it now i can i have questions so i the lord doesn't have to bear with me because when i get over that i got tons of questions but the people saw all these things happen and you talk about a little drink of water and now you want to have an uproar god just crushed your enemy with a sea of water and you just want a little thirst and now you want to put it out on the prophet all right so this is important and so god tells moses there's a tree cut it down cast it into the water and it becomes sweet and that happens in the interest of time the people gets hungry god provides quail for them right the people gets hungry gods provide a manner for them he's taking care of his people and now in chapter 17 and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandments of the lord and pitch and referendum and there were no water and there were no there was no water for the people to drink word for the people did shied with moses and say give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why child ye with me why do you tempt the lord so they just came out of egypt they felt the sense of victory then they get into a position where they become thirsty god blesses them and gives them water they get hungry god feeds them and so you find this internal battle that's occurring within the church so things are beginning to kind of stew a little bit the devil is a strategist he don't get you today he'll get you tomorrow don't get you this week he'll look out for you next week but he's always studying that's the reason why we got to find ourselves protected by god's words shielded it gotta be much more than just words saint you got to live and breathe by this word when you get up in the morning you don't know what your day's going to look like but you got to start your day with jesus christ every waking morning i start my my day with the prayer i start my day with the verse that's what brother gene does all right i know some people for my health reasons they start their day with the daily vitamins that's fine that's what you're supposed to do that's healthy for you but i need my spiritual vitamin because i don't know what the devil is gonna throw at me but whatever he throws at me i gotta know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world it's no joke out there saints the devil is badly for your soul so i'm taking god seriously i'm taking services seriously when i come to church i say lord i need something from you i want to receive something from you i want you to talk to me i want you to speak directly to my heart because i know this is a serious affair and so you have this battle that's brewing word for the people did child with moses and they went back he says what are you tempting the lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that joshua that wherefore is this that has that thou has brought us up out of egypt the audacity to compare egypt and the taskmasters and what they came from to this is this what the message is about don't blame the message for some earthly demons that you're still working through all right don't blame god's words for little weaknesses in your life that you got to come overcome you can't compare this message to the things of the world amen to kill us in our children in our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord and say what shall i do with these people for they be almost ready to stone me things got pretty serious i mean there was internal conflict people were thirsty so the church was in a weak state and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders and thy rod words that's modest the river take in thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rocking orb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come out of it water water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and he called the name of the place masa and maraba because of the triding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not eyewitnesses to all the miracles of god and god says sorry moses is what i want you to do we're going to give the people water and while all this is happening this in turn of conflict in the weakness of where the people's at we finally come to verse 8. then came amalek and fought israel why the church was now in a weak and vulnerable state so amalek says this is an opportunity for us to take advantage of this situation it's in that weak moment brother man puts it this way in the church ages he says and he says in that unguarded moment satan planted his seed of complete ruination in that unguarded moment because as long as we're fighting ourselves then the devil could sneak in not only just amongst the church amongst families it's so important that we build a standard that we fortify ourselves behind god's words so amalek comes in and here's the thing this was an unprovoked attack just because of who they were just because of who you are the devil already don't like you people look at you it's like i don't like the way she smiles i don't like the way she's always in a good mood he seems to be always positive well how else do you expect me to be all right i know what god has done in my life i know what he's brought me through i know what i had to overcome i know what i went through and so i'm not your my happiness is not depending upon your judgment or opinion it's what god says about me unprovoked and so you find that in verse 9 and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go fight with amalek the prophet couldn't choose men but joshua being the type of the holy spirit chose those men to go to battle so he chooses a group of people to go to battle let me say when you go to war you're going forward god tells you i have not given you the spirit of fear so that way you could fear again so you find he says i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so the battle set the devil thought you know what in this week's state i'll take advantage of him only you know when your moments of weakness occurs and if you don't have an altar not in this building but i'm talking about in your house i'm somebody in your job yes i'm somebody in your car when you're by yourself how can you actually stand if you don't have an altar we're living in a time where it's going to become more and more apparent who you are what you believe what you stand for there's no hiding under a tree there's no hiding in the masses and i for if i'm with you if i if i were you i i got to be prepared to make a declaration as for me and my house we will serve the lord so amalek came and fought with israel with the intent to kill them to destroy them the battle is different for you and i because we're not talking about something physical as much as it is spiritual people could go to church just to get their religious fix on what did you do this weekend i went to church and that's not a badge of honor living that life and going to church is two different things and moses said unto joshua choose us out man and go out fight with mla tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and er went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed in every situation i am looking to enter that situation with uplifting hands i look silly in the car by myself doing this without but i don't care i got demons i gotta fight and i'm not waiting just to get the church for the preacher to preach a good message for me to have a winning victory when i have 66 books in the bible that i could read myself as well and receive the same victory i could be in my office with my hands up i'm in my house walking around giving the lord the victory it might be foolishness to the world but to me it's everything hallelujah it's very symbolic i'm learning this more and more when my baby wants me to pick him up they throw their hands up you want daddy pick you up you have to stay much that gesture i as a father know exactly what i need to do when you throw your hands up they say lord i don't have the words he already knows what to do he knows how to lift you up out of the situation that you're in lord here's my hands lift me up to god raise me out of the situation that i'm in he can lift you up he has the strength he has the means he has the will and not only that but he wants to lift you up praise god and as long as moses had his hands up there was victory in the camp sometimes it doesn't feel like it but god is still victorious there's a scripture and you probably know better than i do soldier but where there was a battle and it happened at the mountaintop at the top of the mountain and the children of israel was victorious and people was like oh it's because they were at the top of the mountain and that's the reason why and god says let's bring the battle to the valley that's right the same god that's on the mountaintop is the same god that can meet you in the valley yay though i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thyroid and thy stuff to comfort me he's just as much god in the mountaintop as his god in the valley when i'm in my lowest point in my life i still declare him to be god the hebrew children understood that the king says i'm going to sow you into the fiery furnace and they says you know what king you could throw us into the fiery furnace and we're going to believe god but even if he doesn't come on the scene they said we still will not bow down to the image the other man says i could i could preach chilling today and a thousand people die tomorrow he says i still preach healing tomorrow and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed he was observing that and moses hands were heavy now you try to keep your hands up like this for a while that's exactly right i remember when i was uh in college uh there was this speaker that was talking to us this motivational speaker this was part of our graduation and uh if i remember correctly he was trying to see who could stay like this the longest and uh so we all kind of stood in that position and uh next thing you know you start start doing exercise because you're trying to ease it up and i'm right here and it was really most of the guys were kind of sitting here because we could shoulder this by ourselves saw a couple of the ladies they started locking arms and i'm right here my arms halfway down ah and i'm watching this and i'm like are they allowed to do this and he's like so next thing you know i'm like hey come on over here so i locked arms with this guy locked on with this person next thing you know you like you felt so relieved and then a little circle started to form we started supporting one another that's all right that's all right yeah this uh this football player he was kind of by himself he wanted to prove a point meanwhile i'm all relaxed i like man come on man you can join us man you don't need to be like staying like that yeah you could just you could join us he was adamant the circle was almost done it was just it was just him i like you really want to do this he persisted he persisted but like you said gravity gravity is no joke he was turning he was just turning red and he was just kind of he was shaking i like bro you i mean your girl's right here too man you could just you could join us i mean it's okay and he reluctantly when he locked arms he was so relieved the lesson that we learned is like we're all in this together as stubborn as that person wanted to be be patient because they're still part of the group wait on them pray for them encourage them be there with them because you didn't know how one time you stood by yourself but then when you started to learn that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all the righteousness that i need my brother as much as he needs me then it changes the game and moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on an aaron and earth stayed up his hands the one on one side and the other on the other side and the hands were steady until the going down of the sun that is very symbolic because you just think for that moment's a dual meaning they kept his hands up until the setting of the sun so this bride will continue to have victory throughout the ages until the setting of the sun your victory is not you it's god's victory it's god's leadership it's god's ability to work a miracle in your life and when joshua saw that they rallied behind and the bible says in joshua discomfited amalek and in his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book we're reading it that's right and rehearse it in the years of joshua because when moses goes joshua's going to pick this up for our utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven let me go off a quick side note the reason why it's so important to read this book write it for memorial the bible says there are rose of pharaoh who knew not joseph there arose a pharaoh who knew not joseph the reason why is because before joseph uh had died he was the right hand of pharaoh and he was a blessing to his brothers because they now are under his kind of domain if you will and they're reaping the benefits and the egyptian had a ton of respect for joseph and so as they kind of as they interacted they kept on talking about joseph so when joseph died they kept on talking about him a wave of generation rose up and perhaps the name of joseph was discussed less but they still knew enough to keep their respect so another group of generation rules are both egyptians in the jews and the conversation about joseph becomes less and so apparently after generation after generation they stopped talking about joseph and the pharaoh rose up amongst them who knew not joseph they kept from keeping the name of joseph alive so that's the reason why it's important to teach your kids about jesus christ to teach your kids about the stories in the scripture to teach your kids about these experiences so that way they can teach their kids and their kids and their kids so as long as the lord tarries the name of jehovah always remains in the lips of your children keeping the name of jesus alive they may not know nothing about this bible they have no idea that there's an empty tomb but the only recollection that they have of god jesus is the way you and i live our lives and what testimony you bring forward so the bible says rehearse it and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah nisi the lord is my banner the lord is my banner i'm going to rally behind the name of jehovah because he goes into battle for me i'm going to stand with god i'm not ashamed of this gospel i am called by god i'm chosen i'm elected you're chosen you're called you're elected you're predestinated these are things that the scriptures talks about you in your family and then closing the bible says for he said because the lord has sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation your enemies become god's enemies generations after generation you pass on the name of jesus christ and god's going to continue to watch over your generation and continue to make war with the devil the devil has no place in your home no place with your family amen no place in this church no place in your job no place in your car no matter where you go the devil has no grounds no place he could go because you're a child of god everywhere the souls of your feet stand you have the right to that place and the devil has no place there you should be able to go back to your house and say boldly sing i rebuke you in the name of the lord jesus i command you to leave my house get rid of that timid spirit and say saying you know i just it'd be really nice if you could leave here he has no right to your family he has no right to your health he has no right to your job you gotta lay clap say say let me tell you something if you won't speak the word i'm gonna speak it every promise in the book is mine don't let the devil rob you of your blessings you're a child of god if bill gates cut you a check put your name on it and left it blank and says write them out you want i ain't gonna write a hundred dollars i'll tell you that right now y'all laughing because you know you wouldn't write a hundred dollars there's not enough zeros and i'm gonna tell you greater is greater than bill gates is here this afternoon

daughter write what you will let's all stand to our feet he's giving you the victory don't walk around like you're defeated don't walk around with your head hung down low you're a child of god i know who my daddy is when the devil comes before me as the devil you know who my dad is his name starts with jesus his last name is christ and i'm his son what do you got to say to me you got to have confidence in who you are where you came from where are you going every time the devil opens his mouth brother jack i know he's lying every time he whispers something you know he's lying when he says you ain't gonna make it you say well thank you devil that just tells me i've already made it when he looks at you says yo your back is all messed up but thank you devil you just told me god just healed my back when he tells you your family's gone well thank you devil that just tells me that god is bringing my family back together again when he tells you you shouldn't be sitting in this church oh praise the lord this is exactly the place i should be every time he opens up his mouth it's the opposite we don't need to run anymore we don't need to hide anymore we know who we are there's royalty that flows through this veins speak the word claim what god has given you don't let the devil rob you of the blessings that god has given unto you you hold on to everything you hold on to every promise you're a child of the king you were born into royalty know who you are y'all know the story about that one slave y'all know it why is he so different why does he act different why does he talk different yes well in his homeland his dad was a king and he might be in foreign territory but he still conducts himself like a son of a king when i interact with people i want to know that they're talking to the son of a king you believe that it's about our hearts father i feel like i struggle sometimes just to find the right words to express what you mean to us man in this finite wisdom the lord will always come short to find the words that he could truly express and father another way that we could demonstrate our love and appreciation for you is by how we worship you how we live our lives for you father we just commit ourselves to you your word is so precious and so pure your word is so true and so right keep our hands up lord help us rave our hands in victory for we

lays before us you say in the word be ye certain of god and that we are we're we're trusting you we're trusting you for monday the rest of the week the month the year whatever lays before us to god as
