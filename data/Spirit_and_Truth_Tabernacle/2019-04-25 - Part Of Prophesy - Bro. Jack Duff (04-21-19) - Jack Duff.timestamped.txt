[59:42] and she would read and then he started
[59:45] preaching read man I was to the house
[59:49] one o'clock in the morning here in
[59:52] Joshua one and I sit there under the
[59:54] presence of the Lord and I knew that God
[59:57] was speaking through them to me and if I
[1:00:00] would have denied that I would have been
[1:00:02] denying God all right and God was using
[1:00:05] them to speak to me and I left that left
[1:00:08] that house gonna days that night you
[1:00:11] know and you know and I went on and he
[1:00:14] before I left he asked me he said now
[1:00:17] when you gotta come preach what I'm like
[1:00:18] you know you know I came to fix the
[1:00:22] computer
[1:00:23] I didn't come to get no invitation to
[1:00:25] preach you know and I say I pray about
[1:00:27] it now you know when when when
[1:00:28] Christians use the words I'll pray about
[1:00:32] it that's a that's the Christian form of
[1:00:35] saying if you haven't yet Christians say
[1:00:42] I pray about it you already know where
[1:00:44] they telling you right you already know
[1:00:45] what he meant no they just don't want to
[1:00:47] say it that way sort of Hughes you know
[1:00:49] biblical terms I'll pray about it right
[1:00:51] so so you know he said he said okay I
[1:00:53] give you some time to pray by him he
[1:00:55] called me a couple weeks later say when
[1:00:56] you coming to preach when I say uh and
[1:00:59] they say I want you to come preach for
[1:01:01] me and the openness pulpit and I went
[1:01:04] and I preached and and I remember
[1:01:06] preaching the sermon you must be born
[1:01:08] again they're at their church and after
[1:01:12] I finished preach and I felt so ain't no
[1:01:15] just wait all over my shoulders I didn't
[1:01:17] know what was going on so I called him
[1:01:18] up in the same reven Dawson I don't know
[1:01:21] if I said something wrong in the pulpit
[1:01:23] or what but I just don't feel right I
[1:01:25] want to apologize he's saying you said
[1:01:26] nothing wrong you preached the word you
[1:01:28] see just a young preacher you'll get
[1:01:30] over it I say well praise the Lord and
[1:01:33] and and I realize later on what the
[1:01:36] weight was the weight was God was
[1:01:38] calling me to be a pastor and the pastor
[1:01:40] has the carry load sometime right and so
[1:01:44] I understood that and and then he called
[1:01:47] me up and say now my
[1:01:48] people say when your cousin coming back
[1:01:51] I said your people say my people want
[1:01:54] you to come back they want you to preach
[1:01:56] on Mother's Day I say what I say well

[1:02:36] some of his events and I want to say it

[1:04:13] I know for those that have been going
[1:04:14] through the this is the fourth service
[1:04:16] this weekend and some of y'all may be a
[1:04:18] little little tired and I will do our
[1:04:21] best to kind of preaching it out the way
[1:04:23] I know y'all got food at the house
[1:04:24] that's waiting on y'all and a man and
[1:04:27] things like that but uh but you know we
[1:04:29] got some food here too that's been
[1:04:32] waiting on years away oh so we just
[1:04:35] expecting God just just to feed us on
[1:04:37] today I want to just take two scriptures
[1:04:41] amen this morning and this certainly
[1:04:46] being Easter we want to try to talk
[1:04:50] about the resurrection it's a story that
[1:04:51] cannot grow old a man it can be told
[1:04:56] over and over again and still have
[1:04:58] impact and in our lives so but we'll use
[1:05:02] just a little a different angle
[1:05:04] Amen today and trust that God would get
[1:05:06] glory amen out of it but I want to read
[1:05:10] from 1st Peter chapter 1 and then I also
[1:05:13] want to read from mark 16 man first
[1:05:16] Peter chapter 1 verse 3 and then from
[1:05:21] mark 16 it says blessed be the God and
[1:05:27] father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
[1:05:32] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:05:36] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:05:42] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:05:46] the dead I want to just kind of catch
[1:05:47] that he says Peter says this
[1:05:52] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:05:58] begotten us again unto a lively hope and
[1:06:05] in the way that he came into this hope
[1:06:08] is by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] from the Dan a man and if you're here
[1:06:17] this morning without hope as we turn
[1:06:19] over to mark 16 if you hear without hope
[1:06:22] all you need to do is meet Jesus a man
[1:06:26] and he will give you the hope that you
[1:06:28] need aid me here in mark 16 verse 1
[1:06:33] through verse 8 it says and when the
[1:06:36] Sabbath was pass Mary Magdalene and Mary
[1:06:40] the mother of James and Salome II had
[1:06:44] bought sweet sprites sweet spices that
[1:06:47] they might come and anoint him and very
[1:06:50] early in the morning the first day of
[1:06:53] the week that came unto the sepulchre at
[1:06:57] the rising of the Sun and they said
[1:07:00] among themselves who shall roll us away
[1:07:05] the stone from the door of the sepulchre
[1:07:09] and when they looked they saw that the
[1:07:13] stone was rolled away for it was very
[1:07:17] great a man and entering into the
[1:07:21] sepulchre they saw a young man sitting
[1:07:24] on the right side clothed in a long
[1:07:27] white garment and they were affrighted
[1:07:30] and he saith unto them be not afraid it
[1:07:33] ye seek Jesus of Nazareth amen see there
[1:07:38] was Jesus was a common name during that
[1:07:42] time so he's being very specific about
[1:07:44] the Jesus that you're looking for right
[1:07:47] a man he says you seek Jesus of Nazareth
[1:07:52] and maybe there was another one from
[1:07:54] Nazareth
[1:07:54] but there was only one which was
[1:07:56] crucified hey man you see Jesus of
[1:08:00] Nazareth which was crucified he is risen
[1:08:05] hey man he is not here behold the place
[1:08:09] where they laid him all right and agogo
[1:08:12] says but go your way tell his disciples
[1:08:16] and Peter that he goeth before you into
[1:08:20] Galilee there shall you see him as he
[1:08:23] said unto you and they went out quickly
[1:08:27] and and fled from the sepulchre for they
[1:08:30] trembled and were amazed neither said
[1:08:33] they anything to any man but they were
[1:08:35] afraid the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:08:37] reading of his word let's just pray amen
[1:08:39] over what we've read it here father we
[1:08:41] are grateful for the reading of the word
[1:08:44] but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:46] bring clarification to the things that
[1:08:50] we are reading Lord as we go through
[1:08:53] this sermon today let me let let it not
[1:08:55] just be routine let it not just be
[1:08:57] tradition but God somebody here needs a
[1:09:01] resurrection in their own lives
[1:09:03] somebody needs hope and all the way
[1:09:06] they're gonna find that hope is to get
[1:09:07] to know you so lord help help us to
[1:09:09] present you in a way where people will
[1:09:11] realize a man who you really are
[1:09:14] to them so take control over this
[1:09:16] portion of the service as you have done
[1:09:18] the prior part of the service get glory
[1:09:20] and honor to thy name is in Jesus name
[1:09:23] that we pray amen and amen god bless you
[1:09:27] you can be seated praise the Lord we
[1:09:37] want to use for our title today part of
[1:09:42] the prophecy and also what I'm really
[1:09:45] trying to show is that you're part of
[1:09:47] the prophecy a man part of the prophecy
[1:09:50] so bear with me as we just kind of get
[1:09:53] through this on today we as a church are
[1:09:56] coming out of 21 days a fasting amen and
[1:10:01] we we did that we typically do that
[1:10:04] right before Easter and it was a
[1:10:07] time lay man that we had through this
[1:10:10] time of fasting and just you know just
[1:10:12] felt like we're getting closer to God
[1:10:13] and I just feel like the Norton has been
[1:10:16] in the services God's just been moving
[1:10:18] and I'm it's and and we're very grateful
[1:10:20] for his presence that has been here
[1:10:23] fasting is really when you when you're
[1:10:26] denying yourself God is actually
[1:10:29] feasting when you're fasting hallelujah
[1:10:33] a man and I felt like God was actually
[1:10:35] feasting with us and you know just just
[1:10:38] so much that I've got that I've seen God
[1:10:40] do just these sermons that have been
[1:10:41] coming I love the way brother Solomon
[1:10:44] put it these you know the four beasts
[1:10:47] there that you know he typed that the
[1:10:48] lion the Ox
[1:10:50] you know the man and the eagle and you
[1:10:52] know just those four different
[1:10:53] anointings you know so we thank God for
[1:10:55] that but God has God has been doing some
[1:10:57] great things through this time and we
[1:10:58] thank God for giving a strength to come
[1:11:00] through that but as we were in the fast
[1:11:01] a man and being that it was set for 21
[1:11:04] days I went back and just began to
[1:11:08] reflect on the scripture there and
[1:11:10] Daniel where Daniel had to wait for an
[1:11:13] answer from God for 21 days a man he was
[1:11:17] uh he God had showed him something and
[1:11:21] he was looking for more revelation he
[1:11:24] was looking for more understanding a man
[1:11:26] of this vision that he had and and as he
[1:11:28] prayed and he was beginning to seek God
[1:11:30] about this somehow what we find the
[1:11:35] scripture God heard the prayer soon is
[1:11:37] Daniel prayed God God heard the prayer
[1:11:40] and I want to tell you this morning that
[1:11:42] maybe you've been praying about
[1:11:43] something right and I want to know God
[1:11:46] is not hard-of-hearing
[1:11:47] gosh I heard the prayer as soon as you
[1:11:50] pray hallelujah and maybe you might find
[1:11:53] yourself even on today like I know God
[1:11:55] heard it but he ain't done nothing about
[1:11:56] it
[1:11:56] hallelujah glory to God but like brother
[1:11:59] Troy told us sometimes maybe his wife
[1:12:02] was sent him to the store to get some
[1:12:03] milk
[1:12:04] amen and he went he has every intention
[1:12:06] to go get the milk and he's going to do
[1:12:08] exactly what his wife acts to them but
[1:12:10] but when he gets there he gets him to a
[1:12:12] conversation with somebody
[1:12:14] gets held up that's not that the milk is
[1:12:16] not coming
[1:12:17] amen it might not be coming right now
[1:12:20] but imma get there with the milk I got
[1:12:22] milk and I'm bringing home I just got
[1:12:24] held up
[1:12:25] come on some not that God can't reach
[1:12:29] you but you gotta understand that when
[1:12:31] you pray somebody else hear you pray and
[1:12:34] there's a devil
[1:12:35] Amen try my block that player from
[1:12:38] reaching your destination in the midst
[1:12:42] of the devil block in the prayer you've
[1:12:44] got to have confidence and you've got to
[1:12:46] have faith that the God that you pray to
[1:12:49] it's able to to send you the answer and
[1:12:53] no matter when the answer get here it's
[1:12:55] gonna get here but in Daniels day this
[1:13:04] prayer was held up the scripture says by
[1:13:06] the Prince of Persia this is none other
[1:13:09] than the devil the devil's holding up
[1:13:10] this prayer and and sometimes things are
[1:13:13] happening in the heavenlies a man and
[1:13:16] they happened in the heavenlies but then
[1:13:17] they're coming down to this natural rim
[1:13:19] in which we live in right and there was
[1:13:21] a battle going on in the heavenlies in
[1:13:23] and and Gabriel shall have a say say
[1:13:25] Michael the Great Prince right he had to
[1:13:28] come and and when it came I was able to
[1:13:30] kind of get released from the Prince of
[1:13:31] Persia and I was able to bring this
[1:13:34] answer to you I was able to kind of
[1:13:35] start showing you some things so so I
[1:13:37] began to just think them that I said now
[1:13:38] you're not not not that we're
[1:13:40] necessarily fasting and praying that you
[1:13:42] know God will reveal something
[1:13:44] tremendous to us but but I know that
[1:13:46] there are many Saints here today that
[1:13:48] need a release hallelujah and I want to
[1:13:51] tell you even the property remained as
[1:13:53] they would say the greatest treasure
[1:13:55] that a man could find is to find release
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:02] some of us amen might need a release
[1:14:04] financially hallelujah and I'm praying
[1:14:07] amen this season that you would receive
[1:14:11] your release a man some might needle are
[1:14:14] released spiritually and I'm praying
[1:14:17] that in this season you'll receive your
[1:14:19] release whatever it is that you need I'm
[1:14:23] trusting that God could give you the
[1:14:25] release just like he gave it to Daniel
[1:14:29] we're asking God for the release of both
[1:14:32] spiritual and natural blessings hey man
[1:14:36] I I mean while I told you this scripture
[1:14:39] here in Joshua 1519 is why I say that
[1:14:43] you know this is where I get this Josh
[1:14:44] with 1519 this was Caleb a man had a
[1:14:50] daughter by the name of accent and and

[1:14:59] man and when that when Caleb gave her to
[1:15:02] opt Neil a man if when he gave it off
[1:15:05] the nail she was getting ready to go and
[1:15:08] and before she left she jumped off a
[1:15:10] horse and she she asked her daddy for
[1:15:12] something
[1:15:13] her daddy asked the question saying uh

[1:18:01] shift here a little bit you know it kind
[1:18:03] of talk about the first view of Easter
[1:18:06] the first person that actually got a
[1:18:08] view of Easter would have been Joe Joe
[1:18:13] would have got the first view of Easter
[1:18:14] Jove is the oldest book of the Bible and
[1:18:18] I want you to understand that you know
[1:18:21] when when Joel got his view of Easter
[1:18:23] amen it was because he was actually
[1:18:26] going through something
[1:18:27] Jobe had reached a point in his life a
[1:18:30] man where you know he would he had
[1:18:33] achieved so much he was a very wealthy
[1:18:35] man a very wise man I mean people come
[1:18:39] from everywhere just to sit and talk to
[1:18:41] Joe right and but my job start going
[1:18:45] through in his body job didn't realized
[1:18:47] that there was a conversation that was
[1:18:49] had in heaven right where God even
[1:18:52] challenged Satan and say have you
[1:18:55] considered Joe and the devil's answers
[1:18:58] like no I haven't considered him because
[1:19:00] you got a bit big hands around the man
[1:19:02] is too blessed for me to consider
[1:19:04] anybody too blessed to be stressed
[1:19:07] the man is too blessed for me to
[1:19:09] consider him I know since I'm even
[1:19:12] trying nothing because Joby I told them
[1:19:15] keep worshiping DC say well why do you
[1:19:17] know why don't you consider doing some
[1:19:19] say I'll take the heads from around
[1:19:21] I take all this and take all that and
[1:19:23] I'll let you try to say but he gave the
[1:19:24] devil a man what we call boundaries you
[1:19:29] say you can do this and you can do that
[1:19:31] but you can't take his life he might get
[1:19:34] real close to the brink of death but you
[1:19:35] cannot take his life and if God gave the
[1:19:40] devil boundaries concerning show is in
[1:19:54] this situation and his body is being
[1:19:57] attacked
[1:19:58] he's lost his children his lost animals
[1:20:01] he's lost a man just about everything he
[1:20:03] owns him and a good thing about Jobe is
[1:20:06] that when he when he got to the spot
[1:20:07] where he lost he meant everything what
[1:20:09] job did was by his face to the ground
[1:20:12] and begin to worship God hallelujah I
[1:20:16] love I love his attitude in the midst of
[1:20:18] his trial he began the worship God but
[1:20:20] why he was there a man in this song in
[1:20:23] this trial his wife my lord if I was
[1:20:27] gonna be recorded in the Bible if there
[1:20:29] was only gonna record one word that I
[1:20:31] said out of my mouth while I was living
[1:20:34] on the earth I wouldn't want it to be
[1:20:35] the words that jobs wife had recorded
[1:20:39] the only words she has in the Bible is
[1:20:42] to go into the husband's room and say
[1:20:44] why don't you just curse God and die
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:50] and job had to say something to say than
[1:20:53] you he didn't call her a foolish woman
[1:20:57] he didn't I knew foolish woman get out
[1:20:59] my room he didn't say that
[1:21:01] he say he say he said you speak like you
[1:21:06] talking like the foolish women jobs
[1:21:10] attitude was what was right at this time
[1:21:14] of trial and I want to just kind of just
[1:21:16] brief bring this in just a little quote
[1:21:18] here from the message I know my Redeemer
[1:21:20] liveth this being the first Eastern I
[1:21:22] want you to just kind of catch this a
[1:21:24] man says that first few of Easter I'm
[1:21:28] sorry I'll go to paragraph 39 to scroll
[1:21:30] down since that first view of Easter
[1:21:33] made a profit screen and the thunders
[1:21:36] roared and the lightning splash
[1:21:39] he's so Easter his first time when did
[1:21:42] he see it not when he had his well broom
[1:21:46] close up not not when he had his his
[1:21:51] hair comb perhaps to the top not when he
[1:21:56] was enjoying the very birth the very
[1:21:58] best of health
[1:21:59] that's not where job saw Easter look but
[1:22:04] when he was in trouble I want to say
[1:22:06] something there because a man often time
[1:22:08] folk from the church on Easter because
[1:22:11] they are in trouble
[1:22:12] hallelujah but I want you to understand
[1:22:14] that if you coming at a time a man when
[1:22:17] there's trouble your life God wants to
[1:22:19] give you a resurrection
[1:22:22] come on you part of this prophecy
[1:22:25] hallelujah amen it's one thing to
[1:22:28] celebrate what Jesus did 2,000 years ago
[1:22:30] but he is still resurrecting people from
[1:22:34] the grave of sins
[1:22:37] hallelujah look it says but when he was
[1:22:40] in trouble when he was laying in a
[1:22:42] trouble at the hour and almost up his
[1:22:44] death that's when he saw Easter that's
[1:22:49] where he saw the first resurrection now
[1:22:52] you know he says always been similar to
[1:22:54] you and I it's been when we laid at all
[1:22:57] to somewhere until we were ready to die
[1:22:59] and said Lord God do something for me it
[1:23:02] was then that God raised the curtain and
[1:23:04] we seen Easter say we see Easter not in
[1:23:08] a way of theology so much we never seen
[1:23:11] this piece as wearing new clothes we've
[1:23:13] never seen he says little rabbits and
[1:23:15] colored eggs we see Easter in the power
[1:23:19] of the Resurrection other Lord Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ
[1:23:25] that was a real Easter and when he
[1:23:28] screamed God handsome a quick-fire see
[1:23:34] when he say he pulled the curtain back
[1:23:37] cuz Joubert's not what I would call a
[1:23:40] little discouraged he was going through
[1:23:42] some things and he was a little
[1:23:43] discouraged a man at what was happening
[1:23:45] this life but but what God did a man
[1:23:48] with jobs almost even cursed in the day
[1:23:50] that he was born I wish I wouldn't even
[1:23:52] born right I mean he got a little skirts
[1:23:54] because of his trial but but by God just
[1:23:57] kind of pull the curtain back and let
[1:23:58] job look at Issa and when job looked he
[1:24:01] said I know my Redeemer liveth and that
[1:24:06] he shall stand at the latter day upon
[1:24:08] the earth and he got he got more
[1:24:11] revelations say though after my skin
[1:24:14] worms destroy this body so let the
[1:24:20] testimony said don't know the skin words
[1:24:24] might destroy this body I'm I'm going
[1:24:27] through something nothing but I'm still
[1:24:35] going through skin worms destroy this
[1:24:42] body yet in my flesh shall I see Connie
[1:24:51] Jo got a view of East alright Joe got a
[1:24:57] view of Easter and i'ma tell you if you
[1:25:00] can ever get a view of Easter it a
[1:25:02] change your perspective Easter you wanna
[1:25:07] Norman the power of his resurrection now
[1:25:10] not just the story of his resurrection
[1:25:13] but you wanna Norman the power of his
[1:25:16] resurrection cuz if he's get a lot the
[1:25:20] way we can tell he's alive because he's
[1:25:22] doing the same thing he did in Bible
[1:25:25] days
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:27] let's go in a little further job was a
[1:25:31] little discouraged and we also pick up
[1:25:35] here let me just see something here I
[1:25:39] just want to bring something to you oh
[1:25:42] yes yes yes bear with me just bear with
[1:25:44] me I'm a coastal ooh beat this is coming
[1:25:47] out of go tell my disciples I won't try
[1:25:49] to catch this look at this he says then
[1:25:51] when went along come King Jesus they've
[1:25:54] done to him what they said they would
[1:25:56] when he was born in Bethlehem he came in
[1:25:59] by the way of a stable door went out
[1:26:01] through capital punishment this is our
[1:26:03] Lord and Savior while he was here on
[1:26:05] earth he never made out this is a
[1:26:06] powerful statement
[1:26:07] he never made a 50-mile journey
[1:26:10] everything Jesus did he did within 50
[1:26:13] square miles everything was done within
[1:26:18] 50 square miles never went past a 50
[1:26:20] mile journey think about that right he
[1:26:23] says he he he never made a 50 mile
[1:26:25] journey in his life he never went
[1:26:26] anywhere around Palestine yet the
[1:26:29] message of his gospel has traveled to
[1:26:32] every crack in corner of the world he
[1:26:34] never wrote a book in his life yet the
[1:26:38] book was written of him has outsold
[1:26:41] every book in all ages the Bible he says
[1:26:45] and yet it said never went to college in
[1:26:48] his life talk about the Lord Jesus never
[1:26:50] went to college life and yet there's
[1:26:52] been more colleges erected in his heart
[1:26:55] than any other thing has been put upon
[1:26:58] the face of the earth or any other name
[1:27:00] or any other man he never went very far
[1:27:04] he lived a humble low life he was made
[1:27:06] fun of stuff laughter and he said that
[1:27:09] he had power to lay his life down and
[1:27:11] power to reason up and men and any man
[1:27:14] can make boast like that anyone can but
[1:27:17] he proved his contention when he rose
[1:27:20] only some mornings you see if I could
[1:27:25] just you can you can leave that right
[1:27:26] there I'll stop there if I can just tell
[1:27:29] you what
[1:27:30] separates Christianity from any other
[1:27:33] faith because people get involved in all
[1:27:36] kind of stuff but what separates
[1:27:38] Christianity the reason I say
[1:27:39] Christianity is right it's because our
[1:27:42] Lord and Savior proved what he said yes
[1:27:45] when Confucius died he died when Buddha
[1:27:50] died he died but when Jesus died he rose
[1:27:55] again and that separates I mean the
[1:27:58] Christian faith separated from every
[1:28:01] other faith because our leader did what
[1:28:03] he said he was going to do
[1:28:08] hallelujah now I want to just kind of
[1:28:11] share with you because you know that
[1:28:12] Easter that he rose there was still some
[1:28:16] discouragement in the land job saw his
[1:28:18] first Easter at the skirt at a time of
[1:28:20] discouragement and and and the first
[1:28:24] Easter you know that the disciples
[1:28:25] experience was was when Jesus appeared
[1:28:28] and there was discouragement in the land
[1:28:30] then I want to just you know there was
[1:28:32] two brothers one by the name of Cleophus
[1:28:34] and he had a friend the Bible calls in
[1:28:36] Luke 24 and they were on the road back
[1:28:38] to Emmaus and man they were just
[1:28:40] discouraged they were down trotting that
[1:28:41] they couldn't believe what had happened
[1:28:42] to Jesus they could believe it a man a
[1:28:45] lot of them with the skirt not just Clea
[1:28:46] puss and his friend but all the
[1:28:48] disciples were discouraged the women
[1:28:50] were discouraged every bottom of the
[1:28:51] spirit I want to tell you something
[1:28:53] a man the devil has one secret weapon
[1:28:56] and you know everybody here don't have
[1:28:59] to fight cancer everybody here don't
[1:29:02] have to fight diabetes everybody here
[1:29:04] don't have to fight high blood pressure
[1:29:06] everybody here don't have to fight you
[1:29:08] know the same diseases but there's one
[1:29:10] thing everybody real fights and it's
[1:29:14] what I like to call Satan's secret
[1:29:16] weapon right and I heard a preacher said
[1:29:19] say Saint got one weapon and he and he
[1:29:22] took a guy took one of his demons in the
[1:29:24] room and said now he had it covered up
[1:29:27] you know if you put namesake saying I'll
[1:29:29] win it when they overcome this and they
[1:29:31] overcome that I got this one right here
[1:29:33] for you saying I watched my son beneath
[1:29:36] I said I saw
[1:29:37] Gina and in due time but I got this room
[1:29:39] this is my secret weapon no matter what
[1:29:41] they overcome in like this one right
[1:29:43] here would get them they say I said now
[1:29:45] what is the d-max that that will say
[1:29:47] well what is it say you know this one
[1:29:49] right here when I pull to come on
[1:29:50] this one is called discouragement
[1:29:53] everybody go face of discouragement and
[1:29:56] when you're facing discouragement
[1:29:59] hallelujah that's when you want to see a
[1:30:01] nice time to discouragement but I mean
[1:30:09] you can Easter in your health in your
[1:30:15] finances you can have an Easter income
[1:30:18] families you can have an easy you can
[1:30:21] experience the power of Easter the
[1:30:24] resurrection in any situation in your
[1:30:26] life his brothers on the road to emmaus
[1:30:30] were going through some things they were
[1:30:33] discouraged after they begin to talk
[1:30:37] with Jesus I love the way that I would
[1:30:39] say how he was hide behind a bush and
[1:30:41] it's kind of jump site and begin to talk
[1:30:44] to her a little bit and the problem is
[1:30:47] is that they didn't recognize right it
[1:30:52] was Jesus
[1:30:52] you know folks on the church today or
[1:30:55] still don't recognize Jesus with him can
[1:31:01] I say something else they were talking
[1:31:03] about him but they did not recognize him
[1:31:08] yes sir so here is just going through
[1:31:11] you know different things now not a way
[1:31:14] that Jesus got them to recognize him the
[1:31:18] first thing he did he begin to break
[1:31:20] down Scripture hallelujah he beginning
[1:31:24] to break down enough didn't the
[1:31:26] scripture say anything didn't the script
[1:31:27] to say that and then the skipper saying
[1:31:29] and as they were listening to the
[1:31:31] scripture amen that spirit of doubt and
[1:31:33] gloom and discouragement beginning to
[1:31:35] kind of move away Oh glory to God Hey
[1:31:39] got to the poor like man this man says
[1:31:42] stuff that we never heard and then they
[1:31:44] were actually headed back to the old
[1:31:46] church they come out of before they
[1:31:48] started following Jesus so here they are
[1:31:51] they said I'm not this bad guy so so if
[1:31:54] that Sun was going down and they were
[1:31:56] getting ready to go into the room it and
[1:31:57] they they begin the bag saying I don't
[1:31:59] leave us
[1:32:00] come on into the room and stay with us
[1:32:01] tonight it was only after they got
[1:32:04] behind closed doors that Jesus did
[1:32:10] something and when he did these boys
[1:32:14] knew only Jesus can do something like
[1:32:17] that
[1:32:19] begin the break bridge they so breaking
[1:32:24] bread like that woman's there five
[1:32:26] thousand they saw breaking bread like
[1:32:29] that we need four thousand let it be me
[1:32:33] defeat true he'll break bread the same
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:43] this morning he wants to break a little
[1:32:46] bit with you glory to God man half a fee
[1:32:52] broke bread the boys the boys they lit
[1:32:54] up like but it took off running back to
[1:32:57] the city we have seen the Lord he is
[1:33:00] risen
[1:33:01] you can take the test after they had
[1:33:08] experience with the Lord Jesus after
[1:33:11] stay with me here stay with me here I
[1:33:14] have I want to go a little further I
[1:33:16] just I need to drop this drop drop drop
[1:33:17] something else off to you the infallible
[1:33:19] proof of his resurrection sometimes we
[1:33:21] don't know he's with us we don't know
[1:33:23] he's with us
[1:33:24] we like the brothers on the road to
[1:33:26] emmaus this is out of him fallible proof
[1:33:28] of the resurrection he says and how many
[1:33:31] times have you many times like those in
[1:33:34] my last reading coming from Emmaus have
[1:33:37] you walk with them and didn't know it
[1:33:39] it's the beautiful Easter morning the
[1:33:41] first one that first Easter Jesus was
[1:33:43] alive abroad in the world says I'm
[1:33:45] closing now that's that's what he said
[1:33:46] I'm not saying that I want to ask you
[1:33:50] something - that loved him walk with Him
[1:33:52] and didn't know it who got you out of
[1:33:54] that sick bed not long ago that you give
[1:33:59] over the priest to the doctor you should
[1:34:02] have shook his hand and said thank you
[1:34:04] doctor for your kindness
[1:34:06] but it was Christ who kept you from that
[1:34:12] accident you might have praised the
[1:34:15] driver no doubt with his quick mind his
[1:34:19] intellect worked swiftly to know how to
[1:34:21] swing the wheel at once that might have
[1:34:23] kept it but it was Christ
[1:34:25] it was Christ said certainly it was says
[1:34:28] who was it during the time of depression
[1:34:30] on his way back right when you had no
[1:34:33] flour in the barrel and the kiddies were
[1:34:36] needing some kind hearted neighbor come
[1:34:38] and give you something to eat you
[1:34:40] thanked him you should but it was Christ
[1:34:44] working in man you didn't realize him
[1:34:48] many times they fail to do that these
[1:34:51] men fail to see it they were lovers of
[1:34:53] Christ and they woke with a sad heart
[1:34:55] brokenhearted because they thought the
[1:34:57] Messiah that they had believed in was in
[1:35:00] vain and he was dead and go not knowing
[1:35:02] that that was him walking by them we
[1:35:05] don't realize sometimes that he's
[1:35:06] walking with us he's there keeping you
[1:35:10] he's proving that he's alive when you
[1:35:12] when you were in that accident know it
[1:35:13] all you could even have time to pray all
[1:35:15] you could say was Jesus he was right
[1:35:19] there brother brother quick who told us
[1:35:21] last night he say he was at the light
[1:35:23] and you know he didn't even realize that
[1:35:25] his car was moving and and as the car
[1:35:28] was going for he was getting ready to
[1:35:30] hit another car he thought he had
[1:35:31] stopped he was caught up in the spirit
[1:35:32] just singing and worshiping but he
[1:35:34] didn't realize he was there and and say
[1:35:35] all of a sudden he felt like a power and
[1:35:37] hit his leg and he hit the brake real
[1:35:39] hard like what in the world happened it
[1:35:40] was Christ
[1:35:41] oh he'll walk with you he'll talk to you
[1:35:48] he'll do it whatever
[1:35:51] some of y'all should have been dead a
[1:35:53] long time ago but it was Christ with
[1:35:56] somebody pulled a gun to your head
[1:35:58] it was Christ hallelujah somebody you
[1:36:01] need to know it's him all the time
[1:36:03] they're protecting you but he wants to
[1:36:06] give you a true resurrection yes I want
[1:36:08] to just read a scripture a man because
[1:36:11] there was a there was there was this
[1:36:14] discouragement hid job this
[1:36:17] discouragement hid the brothers on the
[1:36:18] road to emmaus discouragement also hid
[1:36:21] the disciples and here in Matthew 26 I
[1:36:25] just want to read a scripture because
[1:36:26] Jesus prophesied a man about his death
[1:36:30] and prophesied what would happen glory
[1:36:34] to God but I want to tell you that two
[1:36:36] part of the prophecy look at this in
[1:36:39] Matthew 26 verse 31
[1:36:41] since then staff Jesus unto them all ye
[1:36:45] so this is all to decide we always talk
[1:36:48] about Peter and how he did not Christ
[1:36:50] but this is all the disciples right
[1:36:52] hallelujah
[1:36:53] it says all ye shall be offended of me
[1:36:56] this night for it is written I will
[1:36:59] smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the
[1:37:02] flock shall be scattered abroad but
[1:37:04] after I am risen again I would go before
[1:37:07] you into Galilee now I like this because
[1:37:12] he's prophesying that you know hey
[1:37:14] there's gonna be a death there's gonna
[1:37:16] be some things that happen but imma rise
[1:37:18] again and after I'm rinsing I'm gonna
[1:37:21] meet you in Galilee that is all he says
[1:37:24] now if you go go back and when you get
[1:37:27] home and you read more of the scripture
[1:37:28] you'll see you know where Peter Conner
[1:37:31] comes in say oh no not me I hang on I'm
[1:37:33] not gonna do this and I'm not gonna do
[1:37:34] that in 2 Peter said Peter you gonna
[1:37:36] deny me three times before the the
[1:37:37] crow twice you're gonna deny me
[1:37:39] thrice he said no no not me everybody
[1:37:41] else might do but not me and and Peter
[1:37:43] did exactly what Jesus said he was gonna
[1:37:46] do and the problem is is a man when Jim
[1:37:48] went when Peter did it a man he began to
[1:37:50] weep he thought about what he did and he
[1:37:52] began to weep he got discouraged got
[1:37:55] discouraged now I want to tell you
[1:37:57] something that every
[1:37:58] body is not part of the prophecy there
[1:38:01] are other people that you know there was
[1:38:02] another man during this time that did
[1:38:05] something wrong he began to be provided
[1:38:07] to hallelujah but he could go to another
[1:38:10] room
[1:38:12] his name was shoes it was prophesied
[1:38:17] that all the disciples would forsake him
[1:38:19] it was prophesied that was gonna happen
[1:38:21] but I but when Judas prophesies I mean
[1:38:24] when Judas fulfilled his portion of the
[1:38:25] prophecy Amen I wanna Judas couldn't
[1:38:28] return the money hey man he could he
[1:38:30] couldn't do anything everything had
[1:38:31] changed to have to do this Judas did
[1:38:33] this and he can return them on that they
[1:38:34] wouldn't even take it back
[1:38:36] now empty are the Pharisees don't want
[1:38:39] you they don't work to deal with you but
[1:38:44] not II don't want you I want to say this
[1:38:47] because if the families don't want you
[1:38:50] if there is there is no possible way
[1:38:53] that you can go back to most the
[1:38:56] disciples and Peter not have a problem
[1:39:00] if Peter go take out the ear of women of
[1:39:04] service what you think he woulda did the
[1:39:06] Judas Judas had nowhere to step he
[1:39:13] couldn't go back he couldn't go forward
[1:39:16] all they could do is go off the earth
[1:39:18] that's why we didn't hung yourself
[1:39:20] because he had no where to spare
[1:39:24] don't put yourself in a position where
[1:39:26] you got nowhere just
[1:39:32] what to do watch the decisions that you
[1:39:36] make if you're gonna sell out anybody
[1:39:41] don't sell out Jesus
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:48] PETA was different
[1:39:49] Peter I thought about this and Peter
[1:39:56] wept because he had let the Lord down
[1:39:59] but it was prophesied that he would do
[1:40:01] it and he did exactly what Jesus said
[1:40:03] but but I got I just walked through this
[1:40:06] just walked through this with me I was
[1:40:07] thinking at least Peter was in a place
[1:40:09] when he got there to see you know you
[1:40:13] know what was happening to Jesus and the
[1:40:15] little mate come out and say you were
[1:40:16] one of them and people start accusing
[1:40:18] Peter before he start cursing I want to
[1:40:20] say at least Peter was ever placed to
[1:40:22] see what was going on in the palace
[1:40:23] course right he wept regarding how he
[1:40:28] failed Jesus but I want to say at least
[1:40:30] he was broken enough to realize he did
[1:40:34] feel right all the times we fail the
[1:40:39] Lord but we keep acting like nothing
[1:40:42] ever happened
[1:40:43] but at least Peter was broken enough to
[1:40:46] realize he did fail yeah I want to just
[1:40:51] keep going Jesus already told Peter he
[1:40:53] would be he would be betrayed but he
[1:40:55] would be delivered to the hands of
[1:40:57] wicked rulers and they would kill the
[1:40:58] son of son son of man but in three days
[1:41:01] he would rise again and meet them in
[1:41:03] Galilee Jesus gave them a mess say now
[1:41:06] this got happened this got happened but
[1:41:08] in three days I'll meet you in Cali
[1:41:11] I want y'all to just just just meet me
[1:41:13] there in Galilee and I thought about
[1:41:14] this I want you to follow me here
[1:41:16] amen because he told say in three days
[1:41:18] I'll meet you in Galilee and I say all
[1:41:21] right the Lord gave me this negative
[1:41:23] treatment it's only temporary cuz in
[1:41:26] three days things are gonna change the
[1:41:30] spit on us on his beard it's only
[1:41:33] temporary because in three days
[1:41:36] everything will change the mocking than
[1:41:40] the name-calling it's only temporary
[1:41:43] because in three days things about to
[1:41:45] change can I say this - it's only
[1:41:50] temporary because in three days Peter I
[1:42:05] want to taste something you're
[1:42:06] discouraged rich it's only temporary
[1:42:10] because in three days things are going
[1:42:13] to change
[1:42:14] I like I looked at that that's why the
[1:42:19] scripture means a lot to me that we were
[1:42:21] reading earlier from first Peter 1 and 3
[1:42:25] notice his words blessed be the God and
[1:42:29] father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
[1:42:33] according to his abundant mercy how can
[1:42:35] Peter write this because we're what
[1:42:38] Peter experienced
[1:42:40] that's the resurrection right and the
[1:42:44] reason I'm telling you Peter was a part
[1:42:47] of the prophecy what was the prophecy
[1:42:48] I'm gonna rise in three days and I'ma
[1:42:51] meet you right in Galilee alright you
[1:42:55] know what that means no matter what the
[1:42:57] devil did with discouragement it could
[1:43:01] not stop Peter and not just Peter but
[1:43:05] the other disciples from meeting the
[1:43:07] Lord Jesus in Galilee
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:12] see see he was a part of the prophecy
[1:43:16] hallelujah amen and then just like the
[1:43:19] devil tried to get them the devil Minh
[1:43:20] trying to get something up but in your
[1:43:22] discouragement God wants you to
[1:43:24] experience a resurrection look at this
[1:43:28] look at this Peter was a part of the
[1:43:32] positive prophecies just as well as the
[1:43:33] negative or I haven't finished reading
[1:43:35] that scripture according to his abundant
[1:43:37] mercy has begotten us again hath
[1:43:39] begotten us again unto a lively hope now
[1:43:43] it was only after the resurrection that
[1:43:45] Peter even got this new hope look I have
[1:43:48] begotten us again unto a lively hope a
[1:43:50] man by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:43:53] from the dead let me go on here Peter
[1:43:56] was a part of the positive prophecies
[1:43:58] just as well as the negative therefore
[1:44:00] when Christ rolls no matter how much
[1:44:02] Peter had failed he was still part of
[1:44:05] God's plan and how do i how can I say
[1:44:08] that because Peter was gone I don't know
[1:44:10] what he I know he was ready ready to go
[1:44:12] back fishing and do all those things
[1:44:13] Peter said man I'm a fail there's no
[1:44:15] system even going on with this I might
[1:44:17] as well just give up on this but but
[1:44:19] when Jesus rose told women go tell him
[1:44:25] out of cycles and maybe Peter felt like
[1:44:28] he wasn't a disciple not anymore he said
[1:44:31] man I I don't know what I told him that
[1:44:32] I wouldn't do this and I wouldn't do
[1:44:34] that
[1:44:34] and I did exactly what he told me I was
[1:44:36] gonna do so so Jesus put word out amen
[1:44:39] to the to the to the women he said go
[1:44:41] tell my disciples and Peter he knows
[1:44:46] exactly what Peter is going through and
[1:44:48] if you knew what Peter was going through
[1:44:50] he knows what you're going through Peter
[1:44:53] only got hope after he saw Christ
[1:44:56] resurrect
[1:44:58] and you will only receive hope after you
[1:45:01] see Christ resurrected go tell my
[1:45:08] disciples and Peter look at it says
[1:45:12] maybe I was thinking maybe Peter then
[1:45:14] feel much like in the cipher but it
[1:45:15] wasn't based on Peters feelings it was
[1:45:20] based on God's promise it wasn't based
[1:45:24] on what how Peter thought about himself
[1:45:27] right but it was based on what Jesus
[1:45:30] thoughts worth of Peter right ultimately
[1:45:33] amen I love this because there was
[1:45:36] something else that Jesus that said
[1:45:38] before all this happened right he told
[1:45:39] Peter he told Peter he asked the
[1:45:41] question who do men say I am so the
[1:45:46] disciples you know well you know giving
[1:45:47] him generalife some say thou art Elias
[1:45:49] and Jeremiah you know one of the
[1:45:51] prophets that's what they say they
[1:45:53] wanted to know where they actually
[1:45:55] influenced by what other standard did
[1:45:57] they have their own understanding as to
[1:45:59] who he was right so he asked a direct
[1:46:01] question who do you say that I the Son
[1:46:04] of Man but Peter Peter say thou art the
[1:46:14] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[1:46:17] Jesus turning to see blessed art thou
[1:46:20] simon barjona flesh and blood have not
[1:46:23] revealed this to you but my father
[1:46:26] heaven has and the blessing was the
[1:46:29] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:46:32] you upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:46:36] and the gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:46:39] it was the rock of revelation that Peter
[1:46:42] had of who Christ was just because Peter
[1:46:46] had that revelation this this this this
[1:46:48] this the spirit of discouragement that
[1:46:50] came into his life at a very critical
[1:46:52] time could not overcome him
[1:46:54] you know discouragement will lead people
[1:46:56] to commit suicide
[1:46:59] discourage me that's why I mean it's a I
[1:47:03] want to our battle with that spirit I
[1:47:05] wanna I wanna I want to put
[1:47:07] discouragement where it belongs
[1:47:08] underneath the feet look you a part of
[1:47:11] the prophecy he died for you it's not
[1:47:15] just a good story he did this for you
[1:47:17] and you'll never have hope until you
[1:47:20] come in contact with him Peter lost his
[1:47:23] hope but when he when he when when he
[1:47:25] saw the resurrection when he came in
[1:47:27] contact with the Lord Jesus he had a
[1:47:29] renewed hope that's why I say begotten
[1:47:31] us again look at this Peter was standing
[1:47:40] at the gate of depression but it could
[1:47:43] not prevail Peter was standing at the
[1:47:46] gate of discouragement but it could not
[1:47:48] prevail the devil desired the symptom
[1:47:51] that's weak
[1:47:52] but Jesus said I pray for you that your
[1:47:54] faith would not fail so this is why I
[1:47:56] love the statement go tell my disciples
[1:47:58] and Peter I'll meet him in Galilee Peter
[1:48:03] as well as the other side was that for
[1:48:06] sukham they were all a part of this
[1:48:08] prophecy now when they got to Galilee
[1:48:12] there was something else happening the
[1:48:16] Lord just didn't want to meet him in
[1:48:17] Galilee justice just to meet him in
[1:48:19] Galilee but he has some instructions for
[1:48:22] them and and and he gave them some
[1:48:25] instructions there and Galilee that that
[1:48:28] that I think is important for the church
[1:48:31] because see this was really the
[1:48:33] beginning of a man of the Christian
[1:48:36] faith this is what this is what began
[1:48:38] the faith and and let me take some the
[1:48:40] faith didn't stop when Jesus died faith
[1:48:44] actually began
[1:48:47] then the Christian faith begin and if it
[1:48:51] started there when did it in right it
[1:48:54] hasn't that's why I say the same thing
[1:48:57] that you saw him doing and Bible days
[1:48:59] you should expect him to do today yes I
[1:49:02] want to read your script you now you
[1:49:04] know people don't believe you know there
[1:49:06] was a story one time this woman she was
[1:49:09] uh the Prophet told how this woman she
[1:49:12] was sick and she had a son that was in
[1:49:15] Bible School and and and they said to
[1:49:17] him say hey man you better come home
[1:49:19] your mama dying
[1:49:20] your mama is dying you better get here
[1:49:21] as soon as you can and now he said oh I
[1:49:24] got to get home again I don't know what
[1:49:25] I'm doing didn't got another the message
[1:49:26] state don't worry about it mom was okay
[1:49:28] they say what so you have to stay in
[1:49:30] school Mama's okay now she was dying now
[1:49:32] she's okay Tucker okay so he didn't he
[1:49:35] didn't know what had happened so he came
[1:49:36] home you know for a break one time and
[1:49:38] when he got home me up he told uh they
[1:49:40] said mom and I they told me that she was
[1:49:42] dying and then they say that you okay
[1:49:44] what happened mama he said she said oh
[1:49:47] oh that little church up the hill up
[1:49:49] there he say uh you know there was some
[1:49:52] sisters in the church that came down and
[1:49:54] they come to visit me I was sick they
[1:49:56] come to visit me and they said that they
[1:49:57] had a church that believed in praying
[1:49:59] for the sick and and he say they say oh
[1:50:02] yeah they said I got the past it he came
[1:50:04] down me pray for me and i ne read the
[1:50:07] scripture the real one I'm gay get ready
[1:50:09] to read he read the scripture and when
[1:50:12] you're ready

[1:50:18] begin the reading a man mark sixteen oh
[1:50:20] how can I read it for you he was reading
[1:50:26] this him and mark 16 verse 15 because
[1:50:28] when he Sam amici and Galilee they were
[1:50:31] part of the prophecy this was not the
[1:50:33] end of Christianity
[1:50:35] this was the beginning glory to God
[1:50:37] verse 15 says and he said unto them go
[1:50:40] ye into all the world now he only went
[1:50:43] 15 miles
[1:50:45] about 50 miles but he's sitting the
[1:50:48] disciples Amen it's all the world they
[1:50:51] are part of the prophecy and he said to
[1:50:55] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:50:58] the gospel and I want you to extend
[1:51:00] preaching the gospel is not what I'm
[1:51:02] doing right now this is not preaching
[1:51:04] but Richard it's when you demonstrate
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:14] when you demonstrate that he lives with
[1:51:17] people seeing the power of his
[1:51:19] resurrection
[1:51:20] Cinda can have a nice go here to all the
[1:51:26] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:51:27] creature and he that believeth and is
[1:51:31] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:51:33] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:51:36] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:51:38] then that's eating this right
[1:51:40] amen amen them that believe in my name
[1:51:43] shall they cast out Devils hallelujah so
[1:51:49] what's his name his name is Jesus and we
[1:51:52] cast out Devils in the name of Jesus I
[1:51:54] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[1:51:57] listen he says they shall speak with new
[1:52:00] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:52:02] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:52:05] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:52:08] the sick
[1:52:10] is this Jesus words yes is it in read in
[1:52:13] your Bible they shall lay hands on the
[1:52:15] seat and then Jesus said they shall
[1:52:18] recover Peter when you pray for somebody
[1:52:21] they're gonna get healed I know you saw
[1:52:23] that in my ministry but nice time for
[1:52:25] you to exercise this in your ministry
[1:52:27] now before I go into that you know the
[1:52:31] Sun grant he read the scripts a old mama
[1:52:33] I was in Bible School you know they told
[1:52:39] us this scripture mama and what we found
[1:52:42] in in Bible School you get you know you
[1:52:44] don't understand mama what we found out
[1:52:46] in Bible schools that this is what we
[1:52:48] call the uninspired part of the Word of
[1:52:52] God
[1:52:52] this is uninspired anything Jesus Saves
[1:52:56] inspired right but they say it's the
[1:52:58] uninspired part of work so the mama when
[1:53:01] she heard her son say this is the
[1:53:03] uninspired part of the Word of God the
[1:53:05] mama say oh yeah begin the praise car
[1:53:12] and if she had a tambourine maybe should
[1:53:15] be in the kind of beat it a little bit
[1:53:16] glory to God and so successful so that
[1:53:20] the son say mama you acting like them
[1:53:23] people up on top of the hill it said
[1:53:25] mommy you need to sit down and stop that
[1:53:27] shake shake no son I just I just had a
[1:53:29] thought yeah but what you thinking mama
[1:53:31] said you just said that this was
[1:53:33] uninspired and the thought is that if
[1:53:36] God could heal me with the honest by a
[1:53:40] word then what could he do with the
[1:53:44] inspired work
[1:53:47] praise His Holy Name
[1:53:53] Laurita cards so you couldn't take our
[1:53:58] healing from she needs something that
[1:54:01] changed and they based it upon the Word
[1:54:03] of God I want to taste them whatever you
[1:54:05] face and you stand on God's words if
[1:54:07] Jesus that we shall lay had you know
[1:54:09] that did you know and I want to say
[1:54:11] another thing lay hands on the sick
[1:54:13] don't even mean pray for lay hands mean
[1:54:17] just
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:33] [Laughter]
[1:54:45] Jesus said lay hands on the sick and
[1:54:48] they shall recover see the ministry went
[1:54:57] over the ministry was just getting
[1:54:59] started
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] that's why he couldn't let
[1:55:04] discouragement keep Peter in the place
[1:55:06] that he was that's why he would use
[1:55:08] Peters name said go tell my disciples
[1:55:10] and Peter now you ain't going back
[1:55:13] fishing I'm gonna make you fishers of
[1:55:14] men gonna prove that God that Jesus was
[1:55:20] with them the prove it Peter was so
[1:55:24] anointed you read it in the book of Acts
[1:55:29] right
[1:55:30] he was so anointed acts 5:15 let's read
[1:55:34] it
[1:55:35] so anointing I could be wrong when I see
[1:55:41] this and if I am I will out glad to come
[1:55:43] up here say I'm wrong and I'll make that
[1:55:45] right
[1:55:45] but I don't remember what I'm getting
[1:55:48] ready to read I don't remember this
[1:55:49] happening in Jesus ministry I know about
[1:55:52] a woman that just to hem of His garment
[1:55:56] but I don't know about this happening in
[1:55:59] Jesus milk yeah
[1:56:01] what I'm trying to taste that it's
[1:56:03] supposed to get great greater works than
[1:56:07] these shall ye - because I go to my
[1:56:10] father but you still part of this
[1:56:12] prophecy
[1:56:14] now look at this in acts 515 in so much
[1:56:18] that they broke forth the sick into the
[1:56:21] streets and laid them on bed in and
[1:56:25] couch it's not not now now look at this
[1:56:28] just get this in your mind
[1:56:29] they got beds and they are couches in
[1:56:31] the street while the sun is shining they
[1:56:34] got it lined up hallelujah they got it
[1:56:38] lined up dancing and couches industry
[1:56:41] than at least the shadow he didn't even
[1:56:47] touch them didn't even lay handsome but
[1:56:50] at least the shadow leads the shadow
[1:56:55] apena
[1:56:56] the same man that was discouraged
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:04] join the tower he can do it because he
[1:57:08] was part
[1:57:17] least a shadow a PITA
[1:57:20] passing by might overshadow some of this
[1:57:27] man if his shadow hits you you gonna get
[1:57:30] up Jesus was saying that I beat ya and
[1:57:39] if they can say that about people Wow
[1:57:42] what should they be saying about us you
[1:57:47] parted as prophesied by his resurrection
[1:57:50] was to bring these things forth out of
[1:57:53] us
[1:57:56] see it's not bunny rabbits it's not
[1:58:01] Easter egg hunts we talk about a
[1:58:04] resurrection we stop we talk about
[1:58:07] something that got put in man before he
[1:58:11] was even born because you were made in
[1:58:13] God's image see when Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:58:17] told him now and brother brother Jerry
[1:58:20] hit it this morning how there were
[1:58:23] different people that would have risen
[1:58:24] from the dead you know and even in the
[1:58:26] Old Testament they threw a warrior on
[1:58:28] the bones of the Prophet and the warrior
[1:58:31] a man fighting in the battle and they
[1:58:33] just we're gonna just throw them throw
[1:58:35] them on the bones Tommy wouldn't even
[1:58:37] know who buried there
[1:58:38] and he ain't got no grave marker let's
[1:58:41] keep going boys and before they know
[1:58:43] anyway
[1:58:47] a man that was dead all he did was hit
[1:58:50] bones but the bones have to be anointed
[1:58:53] and the man came back to his feet ready
[1:58:56] to fight in the battle then you touch
[1:58:59] the prophet's bone I want to tell you it
[1:59:03] wasn't his bones it was the noid that
[1:59:06] was in the boat do you know if I died
[1:59:10] before Jesus return there's gonna be an
[1:59:13] anointing in my bones so we know your
[1:59:27] way up wait for me I'm coming there's
[1:59:30] gonna be an anointing
[1:59:33] praise God no the skin worms destroy
[1:59:37] this
[1:59:38] [Applause]
[1:59:55] and I'm just blessed when I think about
[1:59:58] what the Lord did this was not the what
[2:00:02] happened that Calvary was not the end it
[2:00:04] was actually the beginning and it should
[2:00:07] still be going to this day now I'm tell
