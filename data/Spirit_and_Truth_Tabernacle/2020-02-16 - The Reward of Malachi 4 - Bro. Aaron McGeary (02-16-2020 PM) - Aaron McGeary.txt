everything that happened in its life you you realize his life was supernatural from the time he was born to the time he died it was all supernatural and you can't explain the supernatural if you're gonna try to understand this message through intellect you always missing it's gonna take Revelation Jesus said upon this rock that rock was a rock of Revelation say I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will prevail and I'm telling I'm a living witness that when you have a revelation of the Word of God for your day the gates of Hell can't prevail against them folk can't come up with all kind

good to see you tonight brother god bless you bless you bank representation from from many places and now tonight we have our precious brother Aaron a man McGarry that's going to come and administer for you and we were blessed last night and I believe tonight the Lord will use him one more time he said he'd been singing so much and a man in the word they didn't lost most of his voice but we prayed that God was strengthened him we seen God do it for brother Danny before and we believe the same God lives today and he'll do it for brother Aaron and I believe if you'll pull on the word of God you'll get what you come for tonight and I believe that with all my heart so let's stand to our feet you thank God for his precious wife and his children amen the McGary family being with him as well and as we welcome my precious brother Aaron McGary to the pulpit say my god he is awesome he can't move keep me in ojai me from the rain come on say said my God is and he heals me we're not sure

turn to our Bibles I'm gonna go ahead let the musicians go and my brother already called me out on how bad I started off singing last night I know I was flat I was nervous and I never claimed I could sing my besaid make a joyful noise we can all agree it was a noise I trust you understand it was joyful and so I realized you guys aren't afraid to call somebody out if they start flat if they're in the cracks and get the wrong key so I'll just wait till maybe if we're gonna sing we'll do it at the end I mean I finished my case Matthew chapter 10 I'm gonna be reading verses 40 to 41 I would like to say what a wonderful privilege it is to be together with you and it's been it's just been a tremendous blessing we first met brother Jack in 2018 in Lima Ohio and we just were immediately impressed with his humility and certainly recognized the gift in his life whether it be in singing and then preaching and just really really admired it and felt just a quick connection with he and his wife and I purposed in my heart when I met him I want to stay in fellowship with this brother and so we've just tried to keep in touch by way of text messaging and maybe a couple phone calls and when the invitation was extended to come and minister I hope it didn't come off the wrong way but I think I just said yes immediately didn't even say I need to pray about it I just felt like I believe that's God's will and so we're really really happy to be in fellowship and it's been quite some time maybe we've been a fellowship with some of the people here but brother smiley and I I say I think we go back to another millenium because I might have met him in the late 90s or early 2000s and then just to be back in fellowship again this many years later is wonderful and if where our paths don't cross much just I want you to know we love you and I would think if that's the number one thing we try to convey when we Minister is that the word is first lift up the word of God give honor to the glory of God and just preach the word not personality or politics or opinion and but the second thing I certainly would want to come across and that is that we genuinely love you you really really do and we just didn't want to encourage you and express our thanks for you and my families enjoyed themselves this weekend and and we're probably going to sing all the way home and practice on practice on getting our voices real fat at certain times and and I love when you can worship just making a sound I like that already just it's a it's an unknown melody in your heart you just want to express praise and so I enjoy I enjoy worship like that my family loves to sing and it's really my my wife she's the real singer my daughter Eliza grace can really really sing she's got some good pipes and so maybe we'll practice so if we ever do come back that's not a pathetic attempt at an imitation but maybe we'll have our the family sing and I do I do want to send greetings to you from our church I bring greetings to you from Hickory Bible Tabernacle there in Hickory North Carolina so I'm in the South now and no longer living in Texas but we bring greetings to you especially from brother Barry Coffey to you and your wife and to brother Danny and your wife there's special greetings from brother Barry sister Becky the greetings with much love from North Carolina to you and we're so happy to be here we love you Matthew chapter 10 verse 43 to verse 42 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth the prophet and the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink until one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward let's bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father it's wonderful to be in such a precious atmosphere Lord whether it's just joy and the people's hearts and it's been wonderful to have been in these services thus far and with such a mighty move of your presence this morning it might even seem in some ways carnal just how could it even go further how can it go any higher but Lord we believe if you would have us together again you would desire to improve upon and take us deeper so lord with the release that we have on our spirits the newness that we're experiencing the washing of the water the word that we've had to these few days we pray that you could do something special for us tonight as we sit at your table once again desiring to feast is iron to see your face so I commit this time to you designed that you have the preeminence for your glory and your glory alone and for your Brides benefit and the name Lord is Christ we pray amen you may be seated I would like to express before I continue just how much I appreciated the ministry of the word of our brother Danny it was it was just tremendous and I believe it was worth every effort for myself personally to have been in these two services on Saturday morning and Sunday morning and I believe the Lord did something really really special to me for it for me and I thank God that I was in these services to sit under the preaching of the word and to hear the word preached it just really really did something special for me I believe I'm leaving here a changed man and just and I thank God for that and it's the word that does that it's in and I'm thankful for him as we read in the in the scripture you can see that Jesus is saying be speaking of things being given and received and it begins to speak about receiving a often receiving a Prophet's reward receiving a righteous man receiving a righteous man's reward and then also in giving a cup of water to a little one in the name of a disciple he says he shall no wise lose his reward and I want to minister on the reward of Malachi for the reward of Malachi form and brother branham makes this statement each message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer encouraging him to be an overcomer and thereby be rewarded of the Lord and so every age has a message and then each message to that age not only just carries with it information or or something to heed to or something to obey or to understand or to know each message actually carries with it judgment that if you don't heed what is being spoken it brings a curse it brings a judgment it's a detriment to not hear it or receive it and just by by virtue or the fact that there's a judgment or condemnation in not receiving the message it also carries with it a blessing something to be gained or benefited from it and brother Branham says each message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer so there's an incentive that comes with the message it says encouraging him to be an overcomer and in being an overcomer be rewarded of the Lord so in every age there was a reward for the elect who heard the message that was ordained unto them and received it so where there's a message there's a reward where there's something spoken of God there's a benefit in receiving it so a message of God anytime God brings a message there's a blessing in the message and an incentive it's the expectation of reward that motivates an effort or inspires your action so he says each message holds an incentive to the believer then as an incentive there's an expectation of a reward so it actually motivates your efforts or inspires your action so when brother Branham uses this language and it might seem counterproductive and it might seem well you shouldn't necessarily encourage people that way but God's not afraid to give you an incentive and it may not work in raising children just because and the basic reason is your kids get your nature and so if they have your nature and get your nurture they're not going to turn out right so but if you can nurture them with the nurture of the Lord and the admonition of the Lord then you could take that nature and preserve it to a place where they can receive a new nature and we don't necessarily give incentives to our kids if you do this I'll give you that if you do this I'll give you that then they're only motivated by the incentive and usually what you want to do is reward good behavior but God having confidence in his seed confidence in the elect he actually holds out an incentive and says if you do this I will give you this not just rewarding you but telling you beforehand that if you're faithful if you receive if you believe there's a benefit that comes so he desires to motivate you or inspire you to act and brother Bentham writes in the church age book all too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed so there's there's a lesson in this that we spend too little time laboring for the eternal rewards of God and he says because his reward his recompense is too lightly esteemed and it's amazing the number of things that people will do when there's a rewards program how did you get $10,000 into credit card debt I got a point for every dollar I spend because the rewards that are involved with it and you go to a grocery store and you shop there and you give them your number because they give you points they give you rewards and and if you do that you get so much back and people can obsess about rewards and points and and incentivizing things and gaming things like well now I'm accumulating I'm gathering and people be so strict and disciplined because the reward that comes with it and listen chase has got nothing on God's reward program people want to know what's in your wallet the capital one got nothing nothing on God's rewards program because he is faithful and we spend too little time laboring for his eternal rewards we lightly esteemed the recompense of God and this tells us we ought to not lightly esteem it but highly a statement we ought to spend more time laboring for his eternal rewards why we could just spend time in revelations chapter 2 in Chapter three looking at how there's a reward for the overcomer and if there's a reward it means it carries with it if there's a reward there must be a labor there's going to be a reward there must be an effort there must be a labor and where there's a labor there's always going to be an opposition listen you got a job to do and the devil wants to stop you from doing him so we work in we wor we got a hammer in one hand and a sword and the other and as long as we stay on task and keep working then that's a battle that we can win and so we know that there's opposition there's reproach there's going to be difficulty and so there's labour there's opposition to that labor it's difficult to do it there's a reproach that comes with it but there's a reward that comes to the overcomer reward is something that is granted after reaching a goal after you've exerted labor after you've passed a test you receive a reward I passed the test as a reward I've exerted myself there's a reward or benefit I've reached the goal there's a reward that comes with it and that's what the Scripture speaks of when there's a reward it's something that's granted after meeting the mark and kind and reaching a goal says in Hebrews chapter 12 and again just stay with me as we just build our case and add these things we're speaking about the reward of Malachi for him Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so we have a race to run and if there's a race there's a finish line and it's not so much who gets there first but it's how you Paul said labor that you may obtain so there's a way that you labor there's a way that you run it's not just he who finishes but it's he who runs correctly and he who finishes correctly so we got to run the race that is set before us each one finishing their course says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith if he started it he'll finish it God's always going to finish what he started a lot of us we tweet we write checks we can't cash we talk things and we can't back it up God's going to finish what he started he's gonna do it that's the kind of God he is he'll finish it and so here he's saying that Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith now we're looking at him how he started and how he finishes who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God so he had a race that he had to run and he says being the author and finisher this is how he ran it was for the joy that was set before him it may not have been joyous for the moment might have been not been deriving much pleasure in the moment but there was a joy that was set before him and I'd take great a great lesson from this because brother Branham says how can I prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass now there's something we've got to remember about this I want to walk this way because I think you all get left out because of all these instruments over here but when he says that we must conduct ourselves with joy in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that doesn't mean we sit back and try to figure out which ones are in his wisdom every trial he has in his wisdom allowed to come to pass so you don't have a right to sit there and go well I just don't think this one was his wisdom so I don't have to cook myself a joy every trial that he allows delet to go through it's in his wisdom that he allows you to go through it so through every single trial every single trial you must conduct yourself with joy believing that this is God's wisdom I go through it I said well it's very hard to be joyful when these things come it's very hard when there's persecution very hard when there's death it's very hard when there's loss but then you've got to think about how Jesus did it there might not have seemed to be much joy within with him at that time but it was the joy which was set before him and as a believer we have a joy that is set before us and it's that joy I'm gonna conduct myself with it may not seem good at the time it may not seem joyous now but I know as a believer in this there's good who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame so he says for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds so he's he's telling us that the joy that is before us the reward is what keeps you from fainting because the trial itself it doesn't seem to bring much it doesn't bring the benefit or blessing and the things that you're experiencing what you're going through but there's something that comes with it something that's to precede it something that God's going to bring out of it and it's the end result that gives you the courage to go through it Hebrews 11 verses 24 to 26 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season now how could someone choose to suffer affliction instead enjoy the pleasures I mean when it said it's not because Moses loved the pain he wasn't yeah I'd like to be tortured bringing he wouldn't like this hurts so good he chose to suffer affliction and eschewed and abstained from the pleasures of the world for season because verse 26 he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward he was able to endure pain not because he loved pain but because he knew there was over word that was coming he could say no to the pleasure because he knew there was a greater pleasure coming listen that's when you begin to think maturely when you're when you get to a place where you can say no to what the world has to offer you can say no to opportunities that present themselves now knowing that God has something better later and what the world calls great you call small and what you call big the world may call foolishness but you know you'll find more pleasure in the will of God than anything the world has to offer listen we ought to be of the mindset there's nothing in the will of God I fear and there's nothing out of the will of God I want there's nothing out fear in the will of God but there's nothing out of his will I want he chose to suffer affliction because he esteemed even the reproach of Christ to be a greater rich big more gracious a greater riches than the treasures in Egypt so it wasn't even put in the sense that the the greatness of Christ was greater than the greatness of Egypt the reproach was greater listen the backside of this message the worst part of this message that the hard parts the difficult parts the worst things people can drag oh I esteemed that to be greater the reproach of it misson brother Branham said things that were really really hard to take and if you want you can say well brother Branham said that because he was the misogynist brother branham said that because he was a chauvinist brother brems said that because he was racist and you could come up all sorts of isms and all sorts of things to attach to it and listen I don't care if the world can categorize it as racism chauvinism massagin ISM I believe that that is a greater the reproach is greater than what this world has to offer [Applause] because he had respect he knew that with the reproach came a rewarding he respected he endured because of the reward he did not faint he did not fail because it respected the reward that would come and so there was no shame even though there's a reproach there was no shame last night we preached I am not ashamed of the message there was no shame because of the reward the shame and the reproach even as its laid out here in the scripture it paled in comparison to the reward the hard part the shame of Christ was greater than the glory of Egypt he's not even taken to consideration the glory of it because we could all say the glory of Christ is greater than the glory of Egypt but here he sent the shame the reproach of Christ was greater than the glory of Egypt come on now the shame of this message is greater than all the glory of denominations all their beauty all their grandeur all their glitter all their all their glisten none of that none of that it can't compare even to the shame of this and what the scripture is establishing and I I'm grateful that tomorrow's a holiday I don't feel pressured to wrap it up because the kids got to go to school tomorrow oh but if you suffer there's a reward so if I make you suffer tonight you just take it I'm gonna conduct myself with joy and missing the trowel that the Lord is allowed to come to pass by letting brother air priests so long I'll just say smile Church joy comes in the moon [Applause] because this is what God is impressing upon the believer labor without strain is bonded labor without a reward is bondage if you if you worked and worked and worked and worked and then you didn't get a paycheck that's slavery that's exactly what it is I'm working for no payment I'm not working for any reward I don't have any equity in what I'm doing that's bondage to labor without a reward is bondage so when one is sowing in the field and planting what the sower does is he envisions the harvest and it's difficult in the winter to disk up your land and to move rock and to get things ready and turn it over it's difficult to begin to plant the seed it's difficult to water and to do all the labor and all the effort through months after months with no we bit reward or benefit but every effort in every step that's taken through the winter to through the spring through the summer the sower and the farmer envisions the harvest and he knows one day I'm gonna get wheat out of this one day I'm gonna get corn one day I'm gonna get a crop and I'm gonna partake in that amount a feed on it so it's actually the harvest that encourages the laborer but there was never any harvest than what's good doing what what good is there to do this and so it's motivation the the the the the the vision of the harvest is what strengthens the labor it's an incentive and brother Branham says in life story says if you only looked for today you'd be a miserable person so he says look out look to the end out there and live for that out to the end so we've got we've got to be a forward-looking people but the Branham I may be paraphrasing a little this a little bit but he said I believe a Christian ought to be the most ambitious person and so we ought to be ambitious we are we ought to be a goal focused people that we have a goal we have it we're visionary why are you doing this why do we go to church why don't we labor why do we strive why don't we raise our children the way that we do why do we apply the token we've got a goal in mind and I say this and perhaps I'm just kind of opening up the curtain a little bit about where I'm going for the last 2,000 years within these seven church ages the church experience of a genuine holy ghost filled believer was leading them to a grave that's just the reality and we've been fellowshiping on how God put the Pentecostal experience in the church and never took it away it was the one thing the devil could never take away from the individual the individual would receive every single believer in every age brother and said every age is the age of the Holy Ghost to the believer and so they had this baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth a quickening of an incorruptible seed but that leadership of the Holy Ghost and that experience led them to a grave every sermon every every prayer line every altar experience every move of God every miracle every sign every wonder every sermon every powerful move of God in genuine vindication of the Holy Spirit was leading them to a grave but listen this age is not so in this age every miracle every shine every wonder every altar call every prayer line every manifestation of the Spirit is going to lead a people to a meeting in the air there will be up people that will not go to a grave so we ought to be a goal focused people the sky not the grave is the goal we ought to believe that there's gonna be a people that will not taste death so we ought to look out to the end live for that I'm not living for a funeral that's not that's not my goal I'm not living every day thinking well what's my kids gonna say about me at my funeral I'm living for the day that I meet them in the air and we're the same age where I can look my son Elya in the eye both of us 21 years old and say son this is gonna be a good time hallelujah you know what that's gonna be in a thousand year youth camp that's why the devil fights the young people so much you look just like that group that's gonna kick him into the lake of fire hallelujah it's gonna be a bunch of people that look like teenagers let's say devil you can't handle me no no not devil I'm gonna cast it into the lake of fire that's why the devil fights young people in the beauty of holiness that's why he fights your purity your sanctity and your righteousness because you look like the people that'll destroy him [Applause] and you know that millennium that a thousand year youth care you're just pre-gaming for eternity because they're gonna be that same look in that same body that same image of youth for the rest of eternity we got to be goal focused in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is you believe that he is now that's the first part and that's a conjunction so it joins these two thoughts together it's not enough just to believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so there's something about your faith that has to believe your faith has to move you to come to God and then believing that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and I believe there's a great mystery in this I think there's something contained in this and as I'm and as I'm speaking about the reward of Malachi for I believe we should have a respect for the reward of Malachi 4 we have to highly esteem it we have to understand the reward or the incentive of this message brother Branham writes in the church age book if they are willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he's going to reward them he is not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him then why wouldn't we want to do it why wouldn't we want to please him in our decisions and the way we conduct ourselves the way we think the way we respond react to certain situations and the way that we portray ourselves the way we dress all he said why wouldn't we labor to please him knowing that he's faithful to reward us he is going to reward them he won't forget your labor of love he will always recompense reward us for our efforts to please him he sees your effort and so with that as just a little bit of a foundation let's look at verse 41 of Matthew chapter 10 man I just enjoy preaching to you all you pull so well I'm gonna I think what they should do is this ought to be a at least the initial proving ground of a ministry if a man can't preach here he can't preach you just you don't have nothing to work with but there and we tried we tried we pulled we pushed we lift it up we put man we did everything we could we just couldn't get anything out of you well I just ain't got it who knows you guys might even make a guy without a gift be able to preach you're hungry I like that Matthew chapter 10 verse 41 he that receiveth the prophet and the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now this is a very unique scripture and the way that it's written it's it's intriguing and you think well if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet what does that mean and then you shall receive a Prophet's reward and then he says the same of a righteous man and we made part of this well what does it mean I would really like to know what this means and by God's grace someone asked him the question August 23rd 1964 brother Branham if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 I would like to know what is a Prophet's reward and I might I'll just embellish this and maybe dramatize it a little bit this person says if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 because to them perhaps they thought this would be a series if brother Branham is ever going to get to part 112 it's gonna be whenever he preaches something like this if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 surely this is something that's going to take two tapes but his answer is very very simple because you're thinking wow me brother branham really let's dig deep on this what does it mean to receive a prophet and the receive a Prophet's reward I would like to know what is a Prophet's reward are you ready for this very very deep answer a Prophet's reward is to be a friend with the profit and if they want to know what a Prophet's reward is is to be a friend of the prophetsí that's a reward he's your friend says it three times so there's no ambiguity here a Prophet's reward is to be a friend of a profit that's what the reward is to be a friend of the prophetsí that's reward he's your friend now would you agree this is a very simple answer and where does God hide himself in simplicity so here's lesson number one in hide-and-seek you're going to find somebody where they're hiding and so if God hides himself in simplicity you're gonna find him in simplicity God hasn't hidden simplicity and then you go find him in complexity he's hidden simplicity so you're gonna find him in simplicity you can't try to make things complicated and difficult to understand you think you found God if it gets complicated God's not in it and so it's a very very simple answer but it was a great truth that's revealed in this answer and so it's very important number one not to get carnal because if you make this carnal well if you receive a profit in the name of a profit you shall receive a Prophet's reward and to be a friend with the pro and the reward is to be a friend that means none of us have received a Prophet's reward unless I'm missing somebody anybody here fish with brother branham I wish I could make a prophetic attempt at fishing with brother branham especially when he caught those six seven pounders 90 of them back there for the Troy and our fellowship at all we can believe that we're fell about golf we can't find a real positive quote on golf but we can find a lot of good quotes about fishing Shah I'm not saying it is but could it be that fishin is millennial well so if that was the real if we were gonna be carnal Wells to be his buddy receive a profit you become a profits buddy then none of us could be his friend none of us context time none of us could call him none of us could say we fished with him none of us could say we were friends nobody can share some of these testimonies even great men of God brother brother ed Bisco has a tremendous testimony I believe he's liking unto Timothy someone whom brother Branham dealt with and certain things came through his ministry that helps us to understand certain visions in the way God used a gift and he was a friend in that way to a prophet for our benefit but none of us have that same relationship brother fiscal does we can't be like brother McHugh's and go hunting with them we can't be like certain other brothers that had that privilege of being called a friend but we can still receive a Prophet's reward because he's not being carnal when he answers this he says if if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you shall receive a Prophet's reward and a Prophet's reward is to be a friend with the Prophet so then we must look to the scripture to find out what it means to be a friend in John chapter 15 verses 14 and 15 he says you are my friends you want to be a friend of the Prophet you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you so now we're learning I can be a friend to a prophet I can be his friend if I do what he says for me to do he says henceforth I call you not servants it's important to understand that he's talking about relationship for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends why why have you called me a friend for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you praise the Lord I can be a friend to a prophet because he has not treated me like a servant but he has whatever the Lord has told him he has told me brother branham held nothing back even though he restrained maybe in language restraining how deep he would go he did not fail to deliver to us and perfect and complete message and we don't need anybody to come and add to it the only thing that can be added is more life take it in a more powerful way but the potentials there the life is there the truth is there it's a perfect message so whatever he heard of the father he's made known and so we could have a scriptural friendship what is the scriptural fynch friendship number one he obeys you are my friends if you do what I tell you to do that's a true believer true believer obeys the Word of God and the second characteristic of this scriptural friendship is you receive secret things so why do you speak to them in parables but to us he says because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom I don't speak to them the same way I speak to you so they obey and they receive secret things but the BAM said this he said I call you friends and a friend tells his friends all things so when he said as a prophets rewards to be a friend with the Prophet there's more to it than just a buddy mark to it than just efficient power there's something deeper more special to it says in Exodus 33 11 and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend so there's things that are being communicated as something supernatural in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness which is by faith by revelation it was imputed to him for righteous and he was called the friend of God God spoke to Moses that was the characteristic of friendship Moses did what God told him to do that's the characteristic and the completeness of the friendship God spoke to Abraham that's the first part revealed secret things Abraham did what God showed him and the Bible's tells them Oh this was a friend of God Abraham was a friend of God why because he told him things and they did what he said and so you could have a friendship if you receive secret things and obey those things receive a prophet you receive a reward it's not being a buddy not being a Chum because none of us would have that but we can be a scriptural friend we can have this relationship where a God has given him things to share and give out to the people and we receive it from him and we do what we're told it says in Malachi chapter four verses five and six behold I will send you Elijah the prophet so God sins and you receive because if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you shall receive a Prophet's reward so there's a scriptural promise I will send you Elijah the prophet God sins therefore you must receive and if there's a sending and receiving there must be a reward if you receive him there has got to be a reward for this Elijah the Prophet and it begins to speak in a way to give us a clue as to what this reward is because he sends them before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the second part the heart of the children to their fathers which is what we fulfill in this hour lest I come and smite the earth with the curse because the curse is coming but before this happens he sends a ministry to turn the hearts back to the original faith and because of that it raises up a people that's gonna walk out on the ashes of the wicked and so when that scene is introduced at the beginning it tells us that ashes are coming great judgments coming but before that happens I'm gonna send you a prophet and if you receive him it's gonna do something for you he comes in for the dreadful day before the right just walk out upon the ashes of the wicked and so the ministry this this this prophet called Elijah the spirit of Elijah if we look at the Ministry of Elijah it holds the secret to our reward the Ministry of Elijah it holds this great secret of this incentive for receiving Malachi 4 and if we just look you want to start to look at the scripture in first King 17 you'll see that it's pointing to a prize we'll just start here in 1st Kings 17 reverse read verses 8 to 16 I know I know somebody's counting scriptures so I don't know if I'll have as many as I had last night but here at first Kings chapter 17 verses 8 to 16 now we're looking at the Ministry of Elijah to catch kind of what what comes at the spirit of Elijah that would tell us what our reward is and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zarephath which belongeth to Zion and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you well as a mouthful here's a prophet of God who in this time of great famine is time of the lacking and this great drought that's upon the land God could have used any means and it will look back in a moment to what he used but there came a point where God actually raised up and ordained a woman to sustain the Prophet that might seem a little backwards here's God's prophet here's God's anointed alright but yet God's going to command a widow and so this Widow I want to use her as a type of the brine this Widow is a type of the bride in the last days and brother Branham said your first husband is dead God let it die he says of you you must be dead to your first husband so we can realize that in a spiritual sense we identify with this widow whose husband was dead and now brother bear says your first husband is dead God let it die and as blue we must be dead to that first husband so there's characteristics of this woman in Zarephath that speaks to us as a bride and it says that she was the widow of Zarephath because he said get thee to Zarephath as their faith was a place of a refinery and the very word means to smelt or to refine so it was a place where metals were proven it was a place where metals were purged it was refinery it means to refine the very name is effort means to prove or to test or to prove to be true and brother man said every overcomer has to be put to the test what do you say brother by the Danube Lee was bringing that out yesterday more it was wonderful listen the world goes through mortgage trouble the world goes through sickness and all sorts of trouble you don't read the paper say my goodness they must be elect they lost everything no the bride is to be tried by the word that's your testing when you're tested by the word and this is a place a widow is in a place of testing Zarephath here we are in Satan's Eden this wicked ages to prove you're not like Eve so here we are in a place of testing in a place of refining in a place we're going to be proven to be true and we realize many are the afflictions of the righteous but all your suffering holds the promise of glory I like to say this every trial is pregnant every single one of them because God promised that I will bring forth through your suffering glory they'll bring good out of everything and so you can look at everything and say it's pregnant pain is pregnant with glory suffered is pregnant with glory this trial is pregnant with glory [Applause] so this widow type of the bride she was in a place to be tested to be proven and brother Branham said he ordained the Ravens his servants this is a speaking about Elisha blessed them Birds his servants that kept the voice of Elisha during the time of his isolation from the church so brother Rams character see what happened prior that there was servants there was Ravens that sustained Elijah's ministry during the time of his isolation from the church but now the isolation is ending so he says it's not just servants that sustain Elijah's ministry but then God commands the widow to sustain him and this may seem like well from servants to Widow that seems very odd it's spoken of a woman who may be weak and carnal eyes but now he has actually called a widowed woman to sustain the prophet to support to nourish to keep his ministry alive to keep him going so when brother Graham said he used Ravens to sustain Elijah but now he commands a widow there's a change from a servant to a woman there's a change in the language as a change in the relationship he used Ravens but Ravens could only do so much there's only so much communion there's almost only so much they could have in common the Ravens were merely bringing substance for him to feed on but now here was a woman that could give him the opportunity to express the full benefits of his ministry what could he do for a raven how could they commute house things to be expressed to that relationship he was using servants to his Ravens type to servants that kept his ministry alive until he came in contact with the woman you could just preach on that so there's going to be a change in relationship Jesus said I you're not a servant because the servant doesn't know what his master's doing but I call you friends and so a servant doesn't know the Masters will but now it changes to a woman and so brother Branham begins to use a language to help us to understand at the time that the seals are open I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it I don't want to call you church because you might misunderstand our relationship I don't want to call you just a servant I don't want to just call you friends I want to call you bride so that you can understand the dispensation we're living in I'm gonna call you bride not Church so that you'll understand that there has been a woman in this last day and listen if there's been something that's sustained Elijah's ministry it's because God commanded a widow hello it's been the bride that kept the largest ministry alive it hasn't been a man it hasn't been servants that's not a preacher in this message that can take credit for you have done it it has been the bride I don't call you church it hasn't been organizations it hasn't been denominations it hasn't it hasn't been anything of that communicant ISM none of that has done it it's been the bride she has kept this ministry alive she sustained it she nourished it let's just be honest if there's not you there's no me I'm just going to speak very honestly if we're not careful we get it backwards and we think that people are rallying around the men around the gift but listen we're only here because you're here and if you didn't show up the three of us would just go eat but they're smiling each one of us with just all us ministers we just go eat and talk but because you're here we've got a job to do and you didn't come here because of me you didn't come in for some other man you came here because of Christ and that's why we exist the ministry is a servant to the bride we need from behind we lead by example you do it because it's a labor of love and yes we're servants and yes we do our part but you the bride have sustained Elijah's ministry he said I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain day he says in verse 10 so he arose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city now we have to be very kind of keep the whole scene in mind there in the middle of a drought so there are certain characteristics of this season in this time that if we don't if don't kind of keep that in mind it's not like he was showing up at a time of Plenty in a and just the markets full and everyone's being blasting everybody everybody has money and every house everybody has potential and everything's available everything's great he's coming a time where he had to sit by a brook and be fed by Ravens and when the brook dried up there's time for God to command a woman and he says he rose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said now get let's just enter into this I pray thee that's me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink now to us that don't mean much right now if I said I wanted another bottle of water I could drink all these and then brother Jack or maybe brother truck would just go about 50 yards that way go to Dollar General and buy me more water yeah wouldn't be a problem make me thirsty you know and we don't even think twice about to pay for it but this is put yourself in this situation he asked for the most precious resource he asked for the thing that was the most scarce to them if they had water there'd be no problem but because they lacked water that's why they were going through the things they're gonna this was a drought this is a time where there was no rain coming because the word Lord came and said hey it's not gonna rain until I called for it and so now he's in this place where there's no water and there's such a little resource and this is something very scarce very precious very valuable and he asked of her the thing that would be the most scarce and the most of that most valuable go fetch me a little water and notice what happens in verse 11 and as she was going to fetch it praise the Lord woman go get me some water and she didn't say excuse me I don't know where you're from but we ain't got no water up in her I don't know where you come from mr. Alamo the big lake must have water all the time but we have a drought here and the brook gun dried up and we don't have a bunch of water in here she didn't do that she didn't even say well sir I'm very sorry but this is a drought do you want anything else I can get you some dust I got a couple sticks here you want some sticks notice what she did he said bring me some water and she immediately said I'll go get you some water there was something about that woman the Prophet knew when he asked her to do a hard thing they asked her to do something difficult it was then he knew this is the woman hallelujah that's why this message ask you to do difficult things it proves to God you're that woman yes yes that's why this message is hard that's why it's difficult that's why it's not always easy but it proves that you're that woman hey men her obedience was instinctive it was okay you want water I'll get you water oh my that was an instinctive faith now you start to see man there's there's a relationship here for man yes because he asked her something and you are my friend if you do what silver asks you to do here she's going as she was going to fetch it then he called her stops her maybe it'll get easy and I said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord God my Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake because he asked for a cake she's just being honest I don't have one I'm sorry I what I what you're asking for I don't have but I have a handful of mill and a barrel and a little all in the crews and behold now this is so you can especially your mothers your parents imagine her desperation and I'm gathering two sticks then I'm I go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die I think of how grave this situation is if a mother knows she's making her and her son her last meal their last meal this is our last meal we're gonna die after this she and her son were facing you have to catch this part of this story they're facing certain death death is in him it's a shadow hanging over them she wasn't just being flippant she just wasn't saying I'm literally going to die know that we use that word literally when we're using a figuratively my head literally exploded that means your head should have exploded I mean ingress don't even mean what it used to mean anymore and so this is definite she's going to die and she's in the state of knowing I'm making this meal we're going to eat it's gonna be a last meal for us and so now with death hanging over her lie just said unto her she's not objecting she's clarifying bring me bread she said I don't have bread I've actually gathered these sticks that I might make a fire that I might be able to prepare this meal and in prepare make a cake for us to eat and I she's just explaining their circumstances and Elijah said under fear not hardly in the face of certain death he says fear not and that's what the message says unto you fear not for you've given power to bind him the greatest and the least hallelujah I don't mean any disrespect fire but when that black mamba went down in that helicopter it only reminded me that that momma death is gonna die one day it's nothing but the truth there he was he said you've been given power to bind him the greatest and the least he says fear not go and do as thou has said keep doing what you're doing he says but make me thereof a little cake first bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son you're gonna put this first for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of milk shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fell until the day the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did she went and did according to the saint of Elijah and so this shows that she had obedience this is friendship this is relationship she received the Prophet she didn't just shake his hand she didn't say good morning but she received him and she went and did according to his signs and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of mill wasted not neither did the crucible fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by a child God backed up what Elijah said Elijah said it wouldn't waste I won't let it waste well I just said it wouldn't fill I won't let it fail God did not let the words of Elijah pertaining to that woman to fail whatever brother Branham is spoken about this pride in his santé Lord it will not fill whatever he said about you it will not fail fella been said by and through the members of the bride I'm looking at the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be fulfilled in the virgin it's not even just something collective it's something individual I [Applause] don't have to live vicariously through brother Jack I don't have to live by courtesy for the brother smiley I can do it myself I can fulfill all that was promised to God to be made manifest Oh according to which was spoke by Elijah she received the Prophet sorry she received a Prophet's reward what was it in this instance provision during a famine that was the reward of Elijah that was a Prophet's reward she received a benefit with death hanging over her she received the benefit of his ministry and Elijah's word the mill which represents the word the oil which represents this holy spirit and her receiving it it carried her and her son I just think about these images now it carried them over death it defeated death so we want now we want to recognize our full reward this is what happens in Elijah's ministry so there's something about Elijah's ministry that when it's confronted with death death has to give way in first Kings chapter 17 the widow's son dies and no doubt this is a test of her confidence in Elijah this is another test now when this happened I want you to think make this personal she gave credit to the message for keeping her son her and her son alive but then one day her son walked away from the message one day her son died now that was her opportunity to be shamed by the message that's when all her neighbors said yeah what about this ol Elijah business oh and your oil never ran out and your crews never ran out and you had all this grain and you had all this meal and you ate all these days but now look at you now that the waters come back now that everyone's thriving now your son dies and it would have been a reproach to her oh you believed Elijah you trusted Elijah in this one that kept you and your son alive now look where your son is today the widow wasn't done being tested it was another test when someone walks away when someone fell away when someone dies would she be shamed and walking away too would be she be shamed and rejecting the message no what happened in verse 22 and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah why because she didn't give up on Elijah she knew the same Elijah that could speak a word that could keep oil and me'll to be sustained and sustained during a famine if God could do that then God could raise the dead so the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of that child came into him again and he revived by whose voice the voice of Elijah and he says the spirit the soul the child came in and he was revived again you'll find that in this instance or with a resurrection it's the first time you read of a resurrection the spirit of Elijah is associated with defeating dead yes there's only three instances in the Old Testament of a resurrection and I know for a fact if I'm wrong that brother right there's gonna let me know and I can always print a retraction in the morning three instances the O in the Old Testament of the resurrection of the Dead the first one we just mentioned in first Kings 17 that was done by Elijah the other two were done by Elijah why double portion 1 by Elijah 2 by Elijah and I'm running out of time here but in second Kings chapter four we come to Elijah and in second Kings chapter four we heard a little bit of it last night about all the vessels being filled with the Holy Ghost but in verse eight it begins to talk about a shoot of my woman and she heard about the Prophet and what is she does she welcomed him into her home and provided food for him and actually gave a place for him to stay in the home and as she accepted the Prophet into the home the Prophet wanted to find a way to be a blessing to her and he found out that they had never brought forth that they had never had a child of their union so what did he do he actually spoke a word and click pronounced a blessing where a woman was dead he brought life and she was able to bring forth his son I'm just gonna I'm gonna maybe just go through this very quickly because you know the story now he was by the word of Elijah that caused a dead woman to come to life and bring forth the son and now this son that came by the word of the Prophet dies happens with Elijah comes with Elijah and this woman she's so convinced she had so received this prophet that when the son that was by his word died she didn't go oh that's it it was only good for so long I guess it was only good up until 2012 I guess it was only good up until this happened it was only good until that happened no she's thinking listen when I received him at the first I was barren and I was willing to have him in my home I was willing to give him place I was willing to plant a token I was willing to play the tapes I was willing to go to church I was willing to praise I was willing to get my home even when my moon was barren but as a reward he opened up my womb and I brought off the son and no matter what's happened to that son whether he leave this message whether he died that does not change my confidence in this ministry she kept on believing what she purposed in her heart is I want to get back to that man and you know what she wasn't just happy with the intermediary Elijah said go ahead get haze' to figure this out she said no I'm gonna get to the man of God and remember this where was he Mount Carmel that's the place of showdowns Elijah was there once now Elijah's there I want to just summarize this very quickly because you know that how the story ends this child laying dead she took him and put him in the room of that prophet yeah haze' actually took the staff and laid it on that prophet that wasn't going to do any good what had to come is that prophet had to come lay himself on it and mouth to mouth the prophet coming and that word making contact and a personal contact with the message that brought the child back to life you can't take briefcase and belt buckles and tats and everything else and bring somebody to life ain't never gonna work what are they doing the Old Testament they took a relic of the prophets ministry set it up that brazen serpent and they set up as a place of worship and it was an artifact and a relic of the prophets ministry but there was death in that what happened when they did that it closed the doors of the church better Ben even prophesied he said one day they'll set up some system that close the doors of this tabernacle and the doors are closed but he Elijah raises the son of the shunammite woman and in this it declares the mystery of the friendship because when the god Lord first inspired the sermon to me it was quicken to me just very immediately the reward of Elijah Elijah's reward power over death and I kept thinking that's a Prophet's reward power over death power for death and immediately as soon as that thought came in mind this thing said the rewards to be a friend of a prophet I was like well that's true but the reward is power over death reward is in a time of death it and it was so vivid to me and this voice said but the frit is to be a friend of a prophet and I was really struggling with it finally the Lord anointed it the sermon I've got to preach this and I thought you know what I've got to preach this but I don't want the people to think I'm taking away from the message so I'm gonna acknowledge that this is what brother Branham said and what I'm inspired to preach I'm not adding to I'm not takin away but we can see this pattern in Scripture we can see this teaching the message so it doesn't take away and it doesn't add to what brother BAM said about receiving a prophet you receive a Prophet's reward and that rewards to be a friend of a prophet and so I took this quote and I was gonna copy-paste it put it in the front of my notes to acknowledge it before the people and as I went back and read it well that wasn't my conscience talking that was God talking he was like go back and read what brother Branham said brother Branham if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 I would like to know what is a Prophet's reward all right everybody stand up shake yourself romancin if you're not wide-awake you'll miss it touch somebody say wake up raise the Lord come on bodily exercise profiteth little I could use a little profit hey man you may be seated cuz I'm just I've just hit my halfway point alright I hope you got a little bit of energy because listen I don't want this to fall flat I'm tired of preaching sermons and people say remember there and I almost ran almost that's what my ministry can produce almost running I can't wait till I sit under a preacher who brings it brings the run in he says brother man if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 I would like to know what is a Prophet's reward a Prophet's reward is to be a friend with the Prophet and if they want to know what a Prophet's reward is is to be a friend of a prophet see that's a reward he's your friend like the shunammite woman hey it might come in handy sometime he brings it right down to that relationship is to be a friend but what benefit is this friendship Oh hallelujah like the shooter my woman it might come in handy sometime it did with her watch God's service when did it come in handy for the shoot of my woman when her son was dead when a room was dead hallelujah a friendship with the Prophet comes in handy in a time of death here's the ultimate reward of malachi for her brother branham's ministries pointing to something he wasn't just let's just get through this question let's just move on to the next one he says that three times is to be his friend it's to be his friend it's to be his friend and how he gives us a prophetic clue like the shunammite woman he's saying something to his Saints listen some people may take this it means to be a friend or I can be a friend or I can be a friend but no it's much more than that like the shunammite woman it might come in handy sometime why because the word of Elijah brings life brought life to a Barren womb brought life in a time of famine and it brings a resurrection like the shooter might woman it might come in handy sometime in second Kings chapter 13 verse 21 you find this third instance of a resurrection and they were going to bury a body and the enemy came as these men were digging a grade to bury a body and they got in a hurry and they took the dead man and threw a dead man on the bones of a prophet I want a dead man touch the bones of Elijah this dead man's body came back to life and listen if the dead bones of a prophet can bring a resurrection how much more can the Living Word of God how much can fresh manna how much can feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man bring life in a resurrection how much more if the bones of Elijah can resurrect how much more can this message he had the message when there was death in the pot why because the spirit of Elijah is associated with resurrection it's associated with life which on the Baptist came of the the anointing of Elijah he introduced the resurrection and the life revelations chapter 11 verse 11 when that last time the spirit of Elijah is used what happens Elijah is resurrected every single time God uses Elijah resurrection and life is associated with it and listen the res the the Elijah Malachi 4:5 is no different his ministry is associated with power over death its associate with resurrection and rapture we must esteem the recompense of God there's a reward that's being held out to us for those of us who believe this message for this day what are these things come why do hardships come why does shame come why does reproach come because there's an ultimate objective of this message and it's not just to look good it's not to tickle our ears something make us feel special but the goal of this message is rapture and these things have got to bring it out of you so we've got to look at this and believe that there's a reward that's coming to those who hold fast brother man says he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture he said there was three the first showdown was Mount Carmel that was Elijah at Mount Carmel Elijah was found at Mount Carmel the second was with Mal was Mount Transfiguration who was on Mount Transfiguration Elijah was there at Mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion and there has to be an Elijah before there can be on Mount Zion showdown and all of us were represented there amount Transfiguration and here we are the bride that represents the Saints that will not die [Applause] it might come in handy sometime Vanna no you like to shoot on my woman it might come in handy sometime well when will this message pay off I've been receiving dividends I've been receiving payments but one day one day the final playoff will come I'm living this life to live up there I'm not living for funeral I'm living for meeting in the air I'm living to put death under my feet I want to be the one that says devil get under my feet what is this last a showdown it's the rapture of the bride it's a showdown with death that's the reward of Malachi 4:5 Hebrews 11:5 to 6 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death now think of this because this holds a great type for us and it says now because remember in the beginning when I read verse 6 I said there's a mystery here because he says by faith Enoch was translated he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so we can't just seek God we've got to believe he's a rewarder and if you want to have a faith that pleases God for a translation you have to believe there's a reward of translation if you want to believe God for power of her death you got to believe there's a reward for power over death my faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death because he had a faith he had a faith that pleased God he had a faith to believe walking with God could one day take him out of this earth so we have got to have the mindset of Enoch not that I'm just kidding through I'm just gonna barely survive but I am an overcomer and I'm not just overcoming Laodicea I'm not just overcoming temptation I'm not just overcoming dant I'm not just overcoming lust I'm not just overcoming the flesh but I will overcome SH and the world the flesh and the devil and Jeff will be put under my feet he's a rewarder you said Enoch was translated brother Baron said Enoch was translated from death by God's transforming power he says what did God do that for why he says for a type of the rapturing Church that's coming God did that for you he didn't just take Enoch off the earth because merely because his faith was so pleasing but because he saw in Enoch a pre figure of your faith and he wanted Judah know that a faith like that gives you power over death he took Enoch and Enoch and I said oh God thank you translating faith oh God I had no idea that I was so pleasing to you I had no idea that you loved me so much he said anak I do love you Enoch I do think your faith is pleasing but I did this so you could be an example because in the last days I want you to see look at that group there it's spirit and truth Tabernacles look at brother smiley they're in Okeechobee look at brother West go over there look at this brother in Boynton Beach look at that group in Miami look what all those Haitians have gone through look at all these troubles they've gone through see everything they're going through the the heartaches our grief the pain the difficult of the persecution I want them to be able to look back at you and know that their faith will one day bring them to a place where I'll take them home so I raised you up as an example yes Enoch I love you but in the I used you because I wanted my glory to be seen for you because you're holding a mystery that if a bride will walk pleasing to the Lord pleasing there's a rapture and this message has a reward of a rapture one day there will be a rapture as for type of the rapturing church that's coming and he says yeah Elijah was the same could you imagine Elijah making it a whirlwind of fire thank you lord thank you for this it's great translation there's Enoch and Elijah is just let me dramatize a little bit I'm not saying it is but listen Elijah's up there and he's saying man look at this I was translated I didn't have to die Enochs going you gonna tell him Lauren or do you want me to tell him aloud you you did good but listen the reason why he did that see those people in Boynton Beach see that brother there in West Palm see those believers there see those believers there he did it to me but the reason why he did it for me and he did it to you is because he want them to be able to stay in the last day he did it for me right maybe you don't know what it's like but I know what a slack everybody Enoch saying he did it for me he can do it for you Elijah saying he did it for me he can do it for you and the bright side he'll do it for me that's why your soul is rumbling hallelujah when the word is heard I got praises remnant wah there's a body being formed [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah I've been singing in a glorified body awaiting me why I've already strapped into eternity praise the Lord he says Elijah was the same this is the reward for the faith that's excited by the Ministry of Elijah the Elijah this hour what's the reward of malachi 4 for those who receive him this Ministry of Elijah holds the key to our reward encouraging us to press on encouraging us to despise the shame encouraging us to remain faithful brother Branham even said I was afraid of death he said I thought I would die and I'd be a cloud and I'd kind of float I think it might mention brother Neville float by wouldn't be able to hug him and he said I was afraid of death now how could you beat an enemy you were afraid of if you're afraid of that how could you ever beat it so he takes brother Brandon beyond the curtain of time why because he couldn't be afraid of death anymore and the spirit of Elijah had to encourage a bride to not be afraid of death so it takes them beyond the curtain of time he says I'm not afraid anymore why cuz he had to instill in you the confidence don't be afraid of death because you can't defeat an enemy you're afraid of it says in 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 11 his brother Branham says Elisha was the same he says it came to pass as they went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses the fire and part of them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven this was Elijah's literal reward he was swept away by passing death that's what God demonstrated not only did he bring life in his own ministry raised the dead in his own ministry but even himself he was translated when up by a whirlwind into heaven and brother BAM says this in investments and God sent in a prophet by the name of Elisha to condemn that thing and after he got old and tired he was ready to go home and he didn't even have to die listen his payoff come his reward came also his payoff come also God just sit him down a chariot and some horses and packed him on up into the heavens that was his reward then he says when he's preaching the Laodicean Church age Elijah did not have to die he was translated and was taken up into heaven a type of the church at the end of this Elijah that will come why did he do it as a type for the bride that comes after the anytime Elijah the type of that church at the end of this Elijah that will come at the end of his time the church will go on the rapture without going through the shadows of death it will be the rapture this is the bride's reward this is the reward of Malachi for want to say about Abraham he was a friend of God what happened he received strength received a young body this is to receive a prophet you receive a Prophet's reward it's become a friend of a prophet how many of you are Friends of the Prophet it's gonna come in handy it's gonna come in handy like the shooter might woman it's gonna come in handy this my son who is dead is alive again this womb that couldn't conceive life is going to come this song that fell away he's going to come back life is going to come why because I'm under a promise like the of my woman it'll come in handy sometime that's the purpose of the elijah ministry not only to restore the faith but to bring us to a rapture in faith because the restoration of Elijah is not only a restoration back to Pentecost the original Pentecost back to the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts but it's a restoration back to the Garden of Eden Christ the mystery of God revealed it's all the way back to the Garden Avene where he said there was no fear and there was no death he said you have to be raised up in the faith of this hour what are the holy Oracles of God what is the lucian of these seals what is what's containing it your rapturing faith that's the season we're living in and so I want to share with these last statements here I'm just kind of I'm winding it down here and the message inspiration it's just a very vague general statement you can't really derive much from them I heard somebody say one time ministers say I'm closing so much you start to wonder how many doors they've gotten their sermon he says someday brother when the Sun refuses to shine when the moon goes down the stars hide their faces from the earth the last sermons preached in the Bible's lane closed churches blown into bits and the rocks are convulsing and crying out I want to know him as the poet and the song said I can see Adams shake Eve and say Eve this is it honey Eve reaches over and shakes Abel and says Abel Abel shakes Seth Seth shakes Noah Noah shakes Abraham amen that time has come aren't you looking forward to that day when all of a sudden you'll shake up the sleeping from Laodicea hey wake up wake up wake up wake up mom wake up grandma wake up and they wake up and they shake up Philadelphia and they begin to shake why does a shakin goin on why because it's rapture time he says amen the time has come know him in the power of his resurrection he says no now this is where I want you to catch this message believers know that my inspiration that's been leading me has been clashed a fanatic and whatever more it's brought me to the line it's brought me to the payin off place mothers you old gray-headed mothers and daddies here he says don't worry the inspiration that's led you to Christ and come through many dangers toils and snares don't worry some morning it'll pay off it will pay off hallelu some morning it'll pay off some morning as a daddy you'll walk up there out of your porch and you look all down that dusty road and way down that dusty road you'll see your prodigal son returning home and a little lost and you may have parted on that porch but now this time you'll meet him down the road where he left shelf he may have walked away alone but you will let him come back alone you'll meet him down that dusty road and you'll lead him the rest of the way Wow your payoff will come don't worry some morning it'll pay off whatever you do don't lose respect for the reward of this message don't lose sight of the message incentive there's AG all that we're laboring for there's a reward for the overcomers brother Brent says press on Lily if it's in you they shade the mud and everything else and press toward the top why I've received a prophet in the name of a prophet and I'm gonna receive a Prophet's reward what is I'm his friend wasn't me to be his friend he tells me secret things and I obey those secret things and because I do I've got power I have favour with God and one day it's gonna pay off one day it's gonna come in handy it says if you receive a righteous man I'm not starting another sermon I'm just trying to shore this part of the verse up you see the righteous men you shall receive a righteous man's reward proverbs 11:4 riches profit not in the day of wrath what is all your riches going to do what's a rich friend gonna do for you in the day of wrath he came by this judge off he can't get an attorney good enough so the Bible says but righteousness delivers from death how do you receive a righteous man usually the reward of a righteous man righteousness delivereth from death let me say this and my final breasts to you tonight as I'm minister in this sermon don't be ashamed of the message don't be ashamed of the messenger don't be ashamed of what God has called you to be there is a reward to the overcomer hold your stand show

the first place and that song says now justified I'll ever be that means I never did it in the first place brother branham said I was supposed to die in the morning because of what I did he said a man took my place he said I don't have to die for that sin the full revelation of justification is that death got no right to you you don't have to die why not there is no sin he has no right to even that

hallelujah glory to God my God my God oh my what a benefits for believing the message it's a message that gets you prepared for this rapture I was just so taken by that quote brother Aaron was reading about just being a friend of the Prophet a man and you know you look at that and say you know we you know just just kind of being buds of chaps with the with the Prophet none of us had that opportunity so you have to go deeper than that what do you say like the Shulamite one you know and as I was just looking at that I thought about the situation where for the random was passing through Timothy was that Tennessee I believe it was and it's playing got a pool town all because of a woman that was spraying a man up prayers cause mechanical problems on a plane to pull it down and not just pull it down keep it down please stay down into her knees with cement she had a specific prayer God had a specific answer she say I'm your Shunammite she could identify herself in Scripture she say I know I'm the shunammite but where is Shirley Lysa so since she had a specific question God had to bring the specific answer and Elijah happen to be flying across I stayed at the time brought him to the airport put him in uh in a hotel room cause him to get up the next morning test to start walking down the street she's singing ah he's singing I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them didn't know which way he was headed but he say I'm just going by faith and as he's singing with the right attitude this woman say good morning parson well read him say how you know I was a parson say what God showed me in a dream that you were becoming the only thing missing is your briefcase say yeah that's back at the hotel and she just began to tell a story and there a boy was facing death he was he was saying it it's dark in here it's dark in his talking but when the spirit of Eliza passed to that room death had to back up [Applause] [Music] no longer could dare stay there even with a simple prayer death could not remain there there's a reward for believing this message I just might as well say I can't see a rapture outside is that too hard for people I can't see rapture outside of this message it's the only thing that prepares us I know forget upset when you say things like that but do you know in the days of Moses there was no deliverance from Egypt if you couldn't follow the message you know what the message was put blogs on the top of the doors on the side posts and if you can follow what the prophet Moses were saying that was coming the only way you receive life in your household was to receive the message for your day the types are all their church don't let this go over your head God's given you something precious God's giving you something he's giving you the way of escape all you got to do is take it you reject it that's on you but God has given it to you I thank God for this word I thank God for this word I thank God for the word [Applause] it's not gonna be easy you take this word and it'd be sweet to the mouth but bitter to the belly that means some folk they'll come against you but there's a reward in it you just keep pressing on you keep pressing on actually sometimes you might find yourself being the only one standing by by you standing somebody else gonna make it with you standing your family gonna make it oh y'all and get that with you standing your family gonna make it you can apply the token to your family hallelujah I already have had to do is just get them in the house and if this if this just this the Scarlet thread is thrown on the outside whoever is in the house gonna be taken care of come on somebody glory to God hallelujah just get them in Christ it'll be alright it'll be alright I thank God let's give the Lord another hand at Frazer I'm blown away I'm blown away I'm blown away then that just that just brother Aaron that was a perfect ending to this this weekend I'm just just a perfect ending and Lord I'll be happy I'll be feasting on this for quite some time man Saints I want to say again thank you so much for coming to support but these services event all the churches and it's represented as precious brothers that have come all the way from Iowa got in a car and drove 20-something miles you know it used to be a time Saints would do that to go to a meet and they here meeting they do everything they could to get there and when you came with expectation like that then God always met you right so I appreciate seeing that a man and I trusted the Lord would get them trapped in verses as they as they go back home and pray to go back refreshed and renewed and ready to battle a devil some more a man and we just appreciate them and and all the other Saints local here we appreciate you God bless you and those that are here in South Florida will be doing a man our combined service at the end of this month so don't forget that I forget exactly where is that is that hell that brother jeans or okay brother jeans church and to be the the final of Sunday of this month we'll be doing our combined service because we'll get together we'll do it again and we're looking forward to that so keep that in mind for the local church here we will be in service on Wednesday night but no service on Friday night we will have service Wednesday night but no service on Friday night so keep that in mind it meant God is good

and thank you for sharing a man a special anniversary with us and then we really really appreciate it and the Lord bless you let's have a word of Prayer amen and we will prepare to dismiss on tonight father we are so grateful for everything that has happened in this place the sermons that have been brought to a slow work definely inspired God and I believe hearts exchanged gesture the a man through through what has been shared the word is what brings the power transformation it's the spirit that comes upon that word that begins to change us from the inside God we thank you Lord for your services yielded themselves and speaking a man to our hearts Lord as we prepare to bring the meetings to a close God we just pray that we continue to fellowship around the things that we've heard and God made the people that have gone free may they remain free we know the devil will come and do all he can the scripture tells us that he would he would go out willingly from a home but God then he'll come back if he finds the place empty he'll come back with seven more demons Lord greater than he was and try to take that bat tick over that take residence again but father we praying that you would do something special in every heart that witnessed when Satan tries to come back he'll find there's somebody else living in his quarters hallelujah somebody that cannot be victims oh my father we just prayed it - it just Lord continue to work that you started when you completed thank you for all that it's been done thank you for each one Lord that has come pray blessings upon each church and God we just carefully to give you all the glory all the honor and praise keep us until we're able to meet again give traveling mercies Lord to the ministers as they go back Lord on tomorrow their families their churches Lord bless them god restore back to them all that they gave out to us father this weekend God we love you we praise you we thank you sin Jesus name we pray amen and amen let's give the Lord another hand of praise praise the Lord man I forgot to leave where I left one group out all the ushers and amen our deacon we thank God for them just everything they do to keep the order in the church and making sure your cars are protected and just everything we just we just appreciate everybody God's been good god bless you brother and god bless you god bless you can be seated [Music] [Music] his lord amen god is good god is good brother Aaron was hitting tonight about we're not we're not living to the death for a funeral preparing for a funeral and I thought that was a very fitting because leave brother Jerry was telling us on Friday night he says he believes this is a generation that's gonna see the rapture and with this being that generation the devil comes against this generation harder than any other generation but this is the generation that will overcome I believe that and I and I tell you even though I might not be one of the young people know more I believe just like Caleb incident to the promised land I can enter into a rapture I'm holding on with everything I got Amen god bless you all praise the Lord the brothers will come in dismiss you
