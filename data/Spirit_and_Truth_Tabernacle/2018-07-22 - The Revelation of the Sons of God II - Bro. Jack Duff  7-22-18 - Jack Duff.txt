yes we are raised along you may have you seen at this time of one ass brother Quinn amen he has a praise and thanksgiving to share with the people this morning okay I was going to do this last Sunday but I thought decided to wait because of the meetings last Sunday and also to give me time to have more strength to come in and talk to you I kind of wrote it down because you know things kind of get fuzzy so this has been a very character building last two weeks for me with my dad passing and having surgery Rick bottom last week I was as well but I wanted to thank the church on behalf of myself and my family for your prayers for the card that you gave me it's truly a true blessing to receive that and in the time of my my dad passing that the it was it was wonderful so thank you for your the card in the kind words I do appreciate my family it helped us help miss a lot I want to give us special thanks to our pastor sister Erica they were instrumental in helping pastor jack has been there all every step of the way so I want to give honor and glory to him truly a wonderful Shepherd to his people and I can't even begin to express the words and the love that I have for our pastor because it's it's it's a life experiencing experience as a Christian to know that your pastor is there for you and loves you and it's genuine so I want to thank him for that just to kind of give you a little flavor for some of the things as it relates to my my dad I was able to fly home because I had gotten a call and he wasn't responsive that was on the 28th of June and so they had took him taken him to the hospital so I was able to spend a week with him in fact Friday on the let's see the event 6 of July my daughter and I were able to go up there and spend time with him and he was you know having fun and she was taking videos and pictures of him and he was laughing and all that and so then on Saturday my son came in and so my son sister Erica brother Jack and brother Olivier we were up there on Saturday we spent a couple hours with him and he was laughing and you know having fun and teasing just Erica about reminding her some family members and being a teacher and and there was another brother up there who he was teasing so he was laughing and joking and stuffing so I noticed that brother Jack had went got up it because we were we had to actually find him that day in the facility he was they had taken them to play bingo view so Pingo activity and so we were running around looking for him and we go to the spot where they said he was that and and he wasn't there and so we came back up and he was kind of like in a 4-year area he wasn't in his room is it for you area and we found him and so we were out there talking with him in fellowship and with him and my brother Jack left and went down the hall then he came back and so after he came back a few minutes my dad he was in the wheelchair he was like I want to go back to my room and I was like ok and so I was lifting up his leg to put it on the embrace thing there on that on the wheelchair and I felt I mean it was like kind of cold as a body was cold and I was like I was concerned because I know previously in the hospital his temperature had dropped but before they released him from the hospital everything was it was okay normal and so I asked a nurse to come and check him out and check out the vitals and stuff so and after they came in and checked everything that blood pressure was fine heart rate was fine temperature body temperature was fine oxygen was fine everything checked out well and so after that brother the brother Jack read some prayer on me some scriptures talk to him and pray for him and I could see him because he was getting very emotional during that period of time because he was really appreciating what was going on and so in fact a that point we is gonna have to go to the service and we were telling me he was going to be was gonna leave and he was like I want to go to church and I was like Oh daddy you can't go to church today he said okay and so he was they brought his food in and he was eating as wheels leaving he was eating his food and everything and so this was about 1 o'clock and we left at that time so everything was it was fine and so once we left went to service and then came back home at service and guess about 12 16 I got a call from the facility that the nurse had it had said she had just came on a shift and she was making her rounds in about 11:35 on on that Saturday night the 7th she went his room checked them he was in his bed and he was he had passed at that time and so she also told me that that the Thursday before that Saturday he had called her and another nurse in his room and asked them to pray for him so though I didn't know so that was good to hear and so he had passed and then afterwards they had we had went up there and they took him I missed him by a few minutes or so when they was taking him out of the facility when we got there like 3 o'clock in the morning they the vehicle for Hertz was there he went up one way and they came out another way and I was really of course I was apprehensive about seeing them anyway like that so I was torn about that that was really I don't kind of usually go view ideas like that and so they had said that on they called me on Monday the funeral home called me on Monday and said they they needed somebody need a family member to come an idea and I was like oh okay Lord well I guess I have to go and so I was very hesitant and you know just dealing with a lot of emotions and so when I went up there we they talked we talked about it and then it was talked about different things and things were going to go all inside the paper and then when they they said okay let's go see your dad now I was like okay so we had to walk down the hallway so as I'm walking down the hallway I'm saying into my mom's thinking in my thoughts I'm hesitant about wanting to go see them and then the second thing is that when I walk in there when I look and see them I'm going to be able to say that's not him to say he would be somewhere else so I I went in there and I saw him and he looked exactly like himself only perfect sleep and when I saw him I was just so overwhelmed I was so surprised that that was how he looked and I was just praising God I was like Lord thank you so much that you allow him to look at peace and the joy that I feel that he lived he's looked at the way he is at peace just give you honor and praise so I just thank the Lord for what he's done and how he's done it has been with me the whole time I give him honor and praise he's faithful he's we serve a faithful that's my testimony he's so faithful and he's always they already promise you'll never leave us or forsake us and it's true so there are some other events that need to take place in terms before the interment I was like a three-month wait period because he's going to all the to National Cemetery so we're waiting for the scheduled date before we can finish finish that piece of it and then our last Thursday I say I have surgery I just gotta give you a little something to break the air but on Thursday I had surgery I went into the the post operation room and when they rolled me in there there was a gentleman on a bed over and then I noticed that the nurse came over and taped a paper on my bed at the end of my bed and it was like I was looking I was like and then she made a loud announcement she said there's I'm taping this same name alert on the bed I'm like same name alert so the gentleman on the other side on the other bed had the same last name as I did and so he had his set of the doctors and nurses and I had my set and everyone will walk in it was like really Smith Jones yeah I can understand that but this name no way and they were I heard them Fernet trying to pronounce the name and stuff and they were saying it and he was like oh yeah that's gold no and I was like okay he going through so he goes the same thing I go through and he pronounces it the same the same way I do too so in fact he reached out to me on Facebook and because that's the first time I ever knew and met him he was a user white gentleman from Mississippi actually I was like well who woulda thought so I you know you just you just kind of push you it relaxed you know you just don't know these little things these little things there are God does little things for us amen so just to say I just want to one just say that I wouldn't be where I am today without your prayers and I love you so much and I

specials portion of brother Quentin's testimony there we heard a man thank God for just bringing him through the surgery and just appreciate all that the Lord is doing in our myths there were a couple of announcements that I needed to make mention of so we have to a couple of things conflict in two areas one is we we were gonna do our our back-to-school giveaway and man we have backpacks and things that make sure everyone's a giveaway just as an outreach to the community and one of the ideas that kind of came is because of what happened there's another meeting and I posted on the board brother joel gene found in miami passes found in miami brother familles old church they have their back to school youth services on the weekend that we were planning to go to Okeechobee so we don't like to conflict a man like that we try to work together in what we're doing so we're not gonna have services but we'll still have our back-to-school giveaway and one of the other ideas that came up is that we would put on our flyer to fight the neighborhood children not only for a backpack but also we want to be able to pray over the kids before they go back to school and our children need prayer amen and our schools a day so we want to offer that to the community amen and now invite them to for the smiler church therefore to come and receive a backpack and some school supplies and also even want to anoint them amen and pray over them before they go back in school so that's gonna be part of our plan and we'll be doing that on the 10th of August so keep that in mind and the sister team is gonna start working on the 11th I'm sorry 11th of August at 10 o'clock in the morning it's just the team's gonna start working on the backpacks tomorrow they're in our home and oceania a couple sisters that we're gonna be helping out if anybody else is interested in helping and just please cease this of Tina amen in regards to them also that I believe that announce about the tenth meeting for brother Simmons and alas yesterday yesterday I should say I got an invitation to Mel brother Fred Mullins is also doing meetings on the same at the same time but Simmons is doing meetings so it'd be two meetings happening there in in South Carolina I know brother fred is having other Jason Watkins who's having a brother die me Regan and I brother Andrew Glover they'll be speaking for a man I think it starts on Thursday they have Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday services and also I know that I've brother brother Simmons will be happy but I said Brooks in a couple others and they also start on Thursday one is in Columbia and one is in Florence so the cities are you know maybe our average about to make someone like that but uh but yet the meetings will happen at the same time so I put both invitations on the board you're certainly welcome to go fellowship anybody you desire to do so just a man if you are going to go just let us know and I'm hoping that I'll get an opportunity to just kind of go up maybe for Friday night or maybe Thursday night Friday amen Saturday morning and I'll come back home on Saturday afternoon because I want to be in church on Sunday morning so I'm hoping to do that but anybody else that would like to go and be a part of some of the services I'm sure you'll be less bothered by it so we want to encourage you to do so praise the Lord a man as of so tomorrow you all keep me in prayer we have a couple things that are that are happening and just one of the precious sisters over there for the West Coast Church felt inspired to to actually pay for a vacation for four pastors and now they included me in that number they got me brother Wes Coburn smiling brother Jean and they they came up with an idea arranged for airfare arranged for a rental truck and a cabin in the mountains in North Carolina and they sending us away put us in the mountains and and you know what y'all trying to do but uh but now we just we just we're very grateful for it but then we got a flight leaving out of here six o'clock in the morning heading up to North Carolina so you all keep us in prayer we'll be away a man with with the other pastors just have an opportunity of fellowship so a man and we certainly are looking forward to it man enemy been attacking my body all week I'm going anyway and she is a snake and and I'm just I'm just believing God to give us a wonderful time there amen so praise the Lord I'm not going to take any more time thank y'all musicians appreciate you all the Lord bless you and man and there's everybody feelin fine hey man praise the Lord we've still got victory forgive me but I'm gonna press right through this today and a man the devil is still alive he's still under my feet man and I just I thank God for the victorious position so after service today a man I mentioned earlier this week after service today I'd like to have a brief meeting a man with the church so please keep that in mind a man so don't be too much in a hurry to get out but all the members of the church just remain seated I want to I want to meet with you after after service of thing amen if you always stand with me we'll go back to the scriptures that we we handled last week out of Romans a man and Romans eight and then also first John three I believe was where we read from praise the Lord [Music] romans 8 verse 19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god and man and also here over in first John 3 verse 1 and 2 will read that and have a word of Prayer and I'll let you be seated it says of a whole what man of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world North us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is a man the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bound the word of Prayer father we're grateful for the privilege and the opportunity to come and to Lord to worship but God this is a portion of the service above our singing and everything else that happens what we need to have the word because this is the word that helps us overcome the enemy so God revealed to us the things that you would have us to know today and we want to take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost help us to look beyond a man ourselves that we might enter and receive from you if there was ever a place to get something from God this is the place a man so help us Lord to reach out by faith and that we may walk in one way but leave a totally different way God let that be our testimony today may hearts be encouraged uplifted strengthened and I've got me you get all the glory all the honor and all the priests from our gatherings in Jesus name we pray amen man god bless you you can be seated a man a man turn around and tell you they was gonna be all right it's gonna be alright don't worry about it it's gonna be alright a man want to thank the Lord for brother Marcus there they come join us grandfather and the prayer meetings that we have and the brothers prayer meeting he just get in and he entered right with everybody else and say it's prayer and I appreciate that Marcus god bless you amen god richly richly bless you and I no God not here we go prayer and magog are here and answer your prayer we want to continue on our topic of the revelation of the sons of God this scripture amen again that we read out of Romans 8 praise the Lord that said Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God when we read that from the emphatic diag lot which is the original translation of the scripture into the English language and man and I believe really the original would be Aaron Aaron mix our mix and would go to the English language when they wrote it there it said indeed the earnest expectation of the creation longs for the revel a revelation of the sons of God and not just manifestation because I think once we have a revelation it will produce manifestation right and and and I think the the the you know to think that the the worst part about our walk right now is that we just don't really know who we are we got somewhat of an idea right but it hasn't really registered way down you know on the inside and I think that in what brother branham we ran through it last week but he said the reason that we we lack in these areas is because we don't feed on this enough right we don't talk about it enough and and and I think as we start to feed on it and we begin to reflect on it it it it should arise something on the inside she just began to rise like wait a minute wait a minute I'm I'm living a million miles beneath my privileges right III I for one feel like God wouldn't allow my ears to hear things of this nature if he didn't have any intention for me to walk in this place he wouldn't be first of all he wouldn't waste his time right I mean it's not wasting my time he wouldn't waste his time think about all the people that are going to church this morning that will never hear what you're hearing right that they'll never got the same Bible that you have but will never look at that scripture the same way you're looking at it right so so God is not wasting time God is trying to elevate our you know releve help people understand get a revelation of who they are in him hallelujah so that's uh let me read a little quote here a couple quotes to kind of get us going this is out of the message what think ye of Christ amen this is probably on the back sheet of that paper I just gave you a man what thinking of Christ notice this statement that the Prophet says he says and the weakness of the church today is one of the fundamental reasons that we see no more going on in the church the first thing I think is because there's not enough travail of soul hallelujah amen I believe there's a quote that went out about that amen earlier this week on the brothers chat but we need some travail of soul amen oh my god let me just talk a little bit about that right because you know Jesus you know they were asking a question saying now why can we cast that devil out what can we get the devil out now we know you gave us power we know you told us that you know what you know that we could bind things that lose things we know you told it but what can we get this devil out this guy and and Jesus had to tell them say you know first it was your unbelief that's the first problem and then he said these times do not come out except by fasting and praying however we were taught if I can use those words hey man we were taught in some instances that because the bridegroom is with us that we don't need to we don't need a fast anymore Oh hallelujah if you look back in church history and then there was always fasting and praying around the power of God moving a man and if we can see patterns set from previous days gone by then don't you think God will do the exact same thing for us if we would apply the same principles we got to come back to fasting you got to come back to bran we just got to get back to the basics uh-huh and the good thing about this as we come back to the basis it's going to produce more than we ever imagined in this season because we got a revelation of what we're doing all right look at this he say you say first thing I think is because there's not enough to relish so to bring the person in contact with his maker it says and another thing is this is the person who does find God the person who does find God doesn't realize who he is after he's found dogs right he says see if you only realize that you're sitting now with Christ Jesus that many of the people are trying to post it off to some other great age and and all healing over the millennium and so forth and all the miracles over in the millennium or say we don't realize who we are now the Bible actually told you who you are now the Bible said now are you the sons of God it does not yet appear but we know that when he shall appear we'll be just like them but we'll see him as he is that's what the Bible said right though all he says down what are we going to need miracles in the Millenium right when we're supernatural beings so so there's no sense to me preaching to you that it's going to be all right in the Millenium no it's going to be all right now things are changing now Oh hallelujah because a revelation is telling it's in our hearts of the people they realize they gotta wait to know millennium that's what the devil wants you to do is push it off to the future but what the private told us that are safe they say what we're waiting on is for the son of God to recognize this and take it back from the devil can I tell you something that that was sitting on what belong to you the devil squatting on your property huh it's time to get the devil off your property and walk in everything that God ordained for you to have Oh glory to God see what what are we gonna do what are we gonna need miracles in a millennium when we're supernatural beings see how we're gonna need those things now the Bible said now are we the sons of God now is is a present tense now are we the sons not we will be we are now we are this morning we are this very hour oh I love this you know I was standing this last week the reason that we kind of make some of the decisions that we make is because we don't we don't recognize who he is this whole thing started off with a quote for brother Branham say Paul is writing these things amen to the church in Ephesus he's trying to reach right into the two totals Anna settle in Christ not those that are wondering whether they victorious this week gonna be defeated next week I'm a son of God today because I feel like the Son of God but next week because I fail I don't feel like a son of God no more right he tried to eat trying to get that idea out of your mind and the way that you got to look at that whatever your last name is whatever your last name is you were born into that family you didn't have no choice about you didn't even get a chance to pick and choose the family you were born in or adopted into that family the bottom line no choice of your own now when you came into the family no matter what you did it could not separate you from the family Oh hallelujah your behavior could not separate you from the family your behavior might have limited certain things you could get but certain things you can do but your behavior cannot separate you from the family and when you realize that you are son of God your behavior does not change the status of who you are but when you truly recognize who you are you gonna stop acting like you LOX Oh hallelujah we got to understand who we are Church in Christ and they stand to say we are we are this morning we are this very hour now we the sons of God seated together set together heavenly places in Christ Jesus now it says right this very minute we're seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus everyman by one spirit we're all baptized into one body become members of the body by the Holy Holy Spirit baptism and now we're seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus free from judgment we can never go to the judgment how can we be judged twice you you've got a God judged Jesus Christ and he put our judgment upon Christ Christ paid our judgment at Calvary if we're in Christ be secured in Christ how do we get into Christ by one spirit we're all baptized into one body is that right now let me just also add this if you feel a little unsure about your experience you might just need a new touch right and this is why we you know it's one thing to get filled with the Holy Ghost it's another thing to get refilled and this is why you want you want to constantly go it I mean don't ever stop it just getting a feeling of the Holy Ghost like I told you you know you can you can get yourself a nice blue car take it out they give you and sometimes you can work it in a deal where they give you a full tank of gas when you walk it off the light and you drive that thing off a lot you'd be so happy that you have to put no gas in it come on somebody you'd be very happy you have to put you don't work that in the deal but if you keep driving that car eventually what's going to happen if that first thing a gas gonna run all the way down to empty and at that point in time it's your responsibility you can take it back to the dealership it becomes your responsibility where you got to put gas in it hallelujah Amen so has to be one feeling but many refilling if you want to keep using and the same thing it is in your spiritual walk you got you one filling the Holy Ghost but you got that has many refill ins every time I come here whether it's in a prayer meeting I'm looking for a refilling whether it's in service on Sunday morning I'm looking for a refilling if it any time the church doors open I'm looking for refilling hallelujah alright alright alright stay with me here today if we can alright I want to read something else out of Revelation chapter 5 because I want us to just really kind of come to some clarity here I believe my spirit was challenged a man through the meetings on last weekend just the different brothers bringing different angles on this topic of adoption and and I want to read from Revelation chapter 5 the Prophet makes some statements here because I honestly believe this we're and I'm gonna read the quote but I believe we're walking in the earnest of our adoption right now we're walking in the earnest not the fullness but the earnest in it and if we're walking in the earnest and we're actually enjoying some of the benefits of the earnest my what do we have to look forward to when the fullness comes right but but here here's the devil the devil want us to realize that we can't even enjoy the earnest that's where the devil tried it you can't even just enjoy our he wants to just come wait wait for the fullness because you ain't got no you got nothing though we are walking in the earnest right now every son and daughter of God within the sound of my voice is walking in the earnest of the adoption I'm sorry truly born again people amen hallelujah let's read this Revelation chapter 5 the Prophet makes this statement it says but now says that now that they did all those years until now now we have the earnest of our inheritance oh my what do we have we have the earnest we have the evidence that God lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God is not fasciculus that we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now Tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that cry that cries out Abba Father and there nothing can ever take that away we're anchored in Christ he also goes on to say this and says now the trees do not have it a man a nature does not have it but yet we are still groaning with them because as as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption all right but we have the earnest of it that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of God what kind of people should we be all right said Omar when we think of that think of it now we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption oh that's the key our spirit is groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it and as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption our complete salvation oh how beautiful I just love that so so as you receive the Holy Ghost it puts you in this place okay the aren't the Holy Ghost itself gives you the Ernest the Ernest amen and I don't know if I if I got that second part is but but the Prophet actually said the Ernest actually means there is more yet to come all right the Ernest means there is more yet to come now I've got to enjoy what I do have but I know that there's more coming on this Oh hallelujah you know I was just thinking that nah man i'ma stop its paragraph 108 if you find it there 61 - zero six one one paragraph 108 I want to just kind of stop there and inject this if I can when I mentioned last week you know there's a number of course of that and I have them here I can read them to you you know one of the things that we know adoption brings us that we can lay hands I mean we tweak we stop sickness we stop disease the spoken word authority there's a number of things that adoption just presents to us a lot a lot but oftentimes when we're going through trials and we're trying to stop ourselves from going through that trial hallelujah Oh glory to God this is where I think we need to kind of submit ourselves right because we want to stop every trial Oh hallelujah a man with this with this Authority we don't want no trials that's not what God was promising we realized the trials and the tension is what brings out the greatness the trials and the tension is what brings out the greatness right if you if you didn't have trials you wouldn't even see this type of power oh yeah I don't know if we get it church I mean I'm just thinking some just so simple how simple God can be you know if it was up to brother Quinton somebody would lay hands on him he wouldn't have to go through surgery now that would have been his prerogative my preference no surgery but you get all the way to surgery all the way down there before they get to take you in and they put a tag on your bed and they say same last name now not only do they have the same last name but they were having the same surgery just on two different sides and for that man to immediately leave surgery now this man Oh hallelujah stay with me here this man thought save this best thing this ain't no coincidence I need to connect with him on Facebook that doesn't man realize who he's connecting with no not just another man with your last name hey but a son of God and you're connecting with you're bumping into eternity and the only way that can happen is if brother Quinton surrendered himself to the surgery I'm looking for greater things to come from that not just a facebook connection but even for that man to reach out to say hey there's something special about this for us to have the same last name pronounce it the same way this bear sailed no no there's more to this and we ought to understand God has purpose for everything the Bible declares that all things I don't care what you're going through this morning all things are working together for good because you love God and you have them called according to his purpose God don't make no mistakes can we go a little further here in this disk quota I just we're walking and the the earnest of it right now we're walking in the earnest of it but we're waiting for the fullness of it now brother Brandon's gotta show us in this quote what the fullness is all right since we're waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we have a body like his own glorious body so the fullness of our adoption is actually a body changed that's the fullness but the earnest a man produces a lot of other things before the body changed and what I'm saying is that we ought to as sons of God recognizing who we are we ought to begin to walk in what we have right now I'm saying if you leave Church today and you face some impossible tasks the God that opened the red stipa Moses is the same guy that I open one for you you might have to speak the same way Moses spoke the Egyptians that I seen the day I ain't seeing normal family now I want you to understand something Moses could not speak those words until he came under pressure the appreciable pressure produces power right and until you get yourself under some question you're not going to even see this you you're not gonna you're not gonna even know that this is there inside of you you know uh uh when when Paul was you know uh you know on his way there I think God told me to go to Rome and as he's on the way when we don't know he got specific instructions from an angel go to Rome now I don't care what comes between him and Rome he cannot die til he get there so a storm cannot stop all right I mean here the storm come that night as an adopted son of God Paul would have wanted to stop the summer storm but Paul actually wrote through the storm in paul thompson and that everybody that stays inside this boats do they'll make it to Rome you're gonna make it to safety and all the guys trying to jump rock the boat turn against and I'm gonna stay in the boat and you'll make it a safety here day here day they finally cut the ropes and let the other boats go in and that their ship got my god just just tossed and driven him and just tore apart inside this view recliner but what happened is that when we're all said I'm going to be can swim ashore if you can't it became if you can't make it on your own get a piece of the of the floating woods hallelujah a man an umbrella let's go preach the message you can make it I'm broken pieces in case we'll just burn a hole lover of a floating piece of will and just begin to kick your legs and you'll make it to shore everybody that was ownership made it to shore they get the saw now can't you imagine this coming through this great truck Lord you just brought me through this and I get the show and all I'm trying to do it's just warm myself near a fire I'm cold maybe shivering and then I'm just gonna put my hands up here by the fire maybe even turn his hands and maybe talking to somebody and well he got his hand them about a fire up comes a sneaking back sitting in the hand and what was Paul do can I ask the question whatever you're going through this morning what should you be doing as an adopted son of God and thought of God you can but more I don't let that bother me letting us stop me honey we almost shake it up and I'm gonna keep pressing forward I'll shut that thing off and everybody around Paul say oh he gonna die man look he might have made it through that storm but God got him not Paul wasn't interested in what nobody was saying he knew God told him to go to Rome and God and I'm bringing you to this island for you to die God gonna take you to Rome Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me let me go on and read this we're waiting for this the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we're we are and will have a body like his own glorious body but we shall see him as he is and we would be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like here's a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more and these earth the Tabernacles went which we now grown in we're waiting for that earnest that for the salvation fully in its fullness to come but now in these Tabernacles are clay we have something that tells us that we have raised up so far a man what is the earnest it's the little downpayment that holds it brother Dow is too earnest now once we once when we love the things of the world once when once when we sinned and went about doing things of the world and cared not for God we were alienated from him without God without Christ in the world now God sent His Holy Spirit and through that we are lifted up from those things we have the earnest that we know that we passed from death unto life amen here as I was trying to show it show this like this here is where the ordinary center runs down here on the bottom now the Christian goes up a little higher than this he rises above all that stuff that's the earnest of his salvation Amen so as believers we're supposed to be able to get a lot higher than the things that we're going through you know brother Branham likens us to Eagles and Eagles when a storm comes the eagle has the has the ability to rise above the storm and just keep sailing this is what we're supposed to do as believers amen and and so when we talk about this earnest Amen it's the down payment is something to hold it it's also a man it means that there's more is yet to come he said divine healing is there earnest of our redeemed body so when we get sick and you know in your console trying to do whatever you can to make yourself feel better it shows that this body is not the final body God got another body a redeemed body that he wants to take you to and we are alone to go into that body a body that does not get old a body that does not get tired a body that cannot get sick we're all looking to be changed to go inside that body hallelujah since we're all we're now drawing he makes this come since we are now drawing on the earnest of our salvation so every time I if I if there's a sickness that as attack of my body and God comes back in heals me I'm drawing on the earnest of my salvation I'm drawing on what Calvary actually provided me he was wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace is upon him and with His stripes I am him so I'm healed so I'm drawing on the earnest Alleluia I'm enjoying the benefits of this thing I was uh you know we I mentioned to you last week about how mighty pray for the baby there in the you know and in the hospital room and and and the one of the things that I want I want to just try to make it clear I honestly believe that we see this type of power we see it when we're in some situations you know brother branham was in the situation where them bees were they were circling man these are killer bees ready to kill you just disrupted our environment and pretty much the reason said no we don't like that and these bleep bees got together we've taken this fella out standing outside cut this grass no shirt on these beans are ready to attack and so here he's standing there and they say all of a sudden perfect love divine love came down and he said he say he start talking to the bees Oh y'all might think that's crazy y'all talk to y'all cats and y'all dogs and y'all actually think they y'all think that they understand what you sayin he don't understand he just see that that that treat in your hand and he know what that means hallelujah my cat know exactly what to do to get food he know exactly what to do to go outside he got I said we're just just standing this spot scrape on the on the on the on the door and then that lets us know that you want to go outside right out how did he come up with that how he came up with this on his own and that's his way of communicating oh my god but they understand right they understand certain things and and also here you know brother branham sitting there and these bees are just surrounding him and and he be giving he just he say oh you know I'm sorry you know this is what God gave y'all and I interrupt a job area I'm sorry you know I took I didn't mean to do that y'all go back to y'all hive a man I didn't mean to do that I'm sorry go back to your house in the name of the Lord Jesus and then bees come around like this and went right back to the hive now most of us if that would have happened us and we see bees come around like this we going back to our hive but ringing out running bees so with this power there is a love that's associated with it hallelujah there's a certain character that that goes with this right and this is why this is why God trying to work on the character of every individual in here amen because because if you don't really have that love you can do some damage to somebody we're brother Branham saw the bull he wasn't even looking for if this this is what I mean because some of us will take this power we don't look at the problems your own when you do it that way you're absolutely wrong but recognizing that when the problem comes to you that there's something on the inside of you to put that devil in his place there's a couple of earnest situations that I could I could quickly share one I mean you all I told you all about the being at the airport and man there was we didn't know we just got to the airport trying to get on the plane we were supposed to be flying to England but we were going through Detroit and I said well we don't have to be there no three hours ahead of time I'm not sitting in an airport that long let's just get up there about hour before would be good well we said if I hour we got there four to five minutes before and we got there to the counter say no no you can't get on this plane I say huh I said I say you got to rebook your tickets I say how much that's gonna cost they said thousands I said no no no way we can't lose that and they have to pay something else and no we can't do that so this they said well sir you're not getting on this plane and me and my wife was going back and forth of these people trying to get on this plane and and and as we were as we were there I kind of pulled to the side so hearing all this pressure you know what you're gonna do you know so we don't got mistake plan and going for a week and now we can't get on the plane and you know what's gonna happen here so you know I said well I just pulled to the side and I'm sitting there waiting to try to get over there and then I heard the Holy Spirit say to me you know it was the same God that stopped a plane for the woman and men Tennessee is the same god that's able to stop this plane and I said well a man I believe that see God did share that testimony with me just to be sharing a testimony it was to come back up at a time that I needed it and I say well in the name of the Lord Jesus this planning on go no went till we get on I spoke it now nobody was there but me and God my wife didn't hear me say that nobody else that was with me heard me say that but I said and I just sat there and then I was sitting there watchin it and some of the sex was already on board on the plane and here that plane was stuck for 30 minutes on the ground and when it was stuck the lady comes to say uh sir I think we can get you on the plane say oh yeah you can get us off so you're gonna get again y'all come real quick come real quick come real quick so here they got us rushing through and we get on the plane and come to find out because some of the Saints was already on the plane come to find that they don't announce on the plane we got some international passengers that were running a little late and we didn't want to leave them here in West Palm if you all would forgive them amen they're coming so we get on a plane to everybody looking at us crazy but the reason to playing with ground is because they had mechanical problems I want to go a little further the reason the plane was grounded because the Son of God spoke to the plane so I'll take the blame that is my fault actually is not my fault but but but you put me in a position where I had to exercise in the authority that God has anointed me to operate in this is the earnest that's the earnest now I doubt now that don't mean every time I go to airport that's not wisdom right amen when you get into a situation gotta show up [Music] I was brother quitting we were talking and he had an assignment it was going somewhere and I prayed about the Lord told him to go to a certain city he went to the city he got there to the city it's a report for work and did an interview with somebody and that guy went to him through the interviewing and the counter towards the end of the interview the guys say I think I want somebody else not you anyway huh now this is put up in a shoo-in no I think I want somebody else or not you so it created an issue cause brother Quentin and tell them if God want me here God don't make a way for me to get here say well I'll call you later that's all right but if God want me here God gonna make a way for me to get here turn walk back to office way to get itself something to eat somebody called him and and the person that called them I think brother Quentin might have made a telephone call to somebody and he ended up talking to some big purse and and somebody had arranged for him to be in that job so he told him what it happened he said he said yeah I don't know what happened with the guy so he was we have somebody else in mind he said okay just stay where you at I'll call you right back call back said go back down there went back down there it's dementia I like your faith if God wants me here he gonna make her wait for you to get here the job is yours sir oh these are the earliest things that we're talking about and that something dark we got to take everything that devil give us write some things is God some things is the devil right but we ain't got to take everything the devil give us especially when we know God has given a specific instruction we can rise up and lay clay hallelujah Church glory to God if God promised you healing lay claims on your human right God God God God promised to meet your meat lay claims on you gotta just take everything that ever do I'll be Lu ya alright let me let me go on a little further see you know these are these are just earnest things these are earnest things that we are we're supposed to be enjoying not just my belief we should see supernatural things happen every week supernatural testimonies every week every week every week every week every week glory that God glory to God Amen so snail me working two or three jobs and only getting paid for one leopard in God's hands and why she sitting in church then compromise oh y'all and get done then compromise the compromises work sometime on Sunday no no compromise no come on mama no I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna take the job if that's what is the Intel's I don't want I know it's more money but no I don't want to sacrifice well I'll tell you what oh now this week don't forget to pay yourself but that other job you doing if your leave it in God's hands he will work it out Oh Church these are just earnest things that we're supposed to be enjoying there is a promise that when true sons born sons feel son speak we will have our word backed a man there's a promise that if a brother needed rain you would have the authority and the power to give him rain there's another promise that we would have checkbook authority our names are supposed to be just as good as the father's name a man on the check hallelujah and there's another promise that we would be a super church a super race as we need him I read this scripture last week and I want to bring it back around to you now first Peter chapter 2 Laurita god and verse 9 this scripture been carrying me through the last year [Music] then carry me through the last year look at this first Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light and I want to read it again keep it there on the screen because I want to read it to you from an emphatic dialect but ye but you are a chosen race not just chosen generation but chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for a purpose not just a peculiar people but a people for a purpose you were put on this earth for a purpose a people for a purpose a man that you and I don't look at this that you may declare the perfections of him that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful life so if it's you are supposed to be declaring God's perfection Oh hallelujah that diamond got to be cut and it's got to be cut a certain way because amen it has to reflect seven lights and in the cut there's three things that deal with the cut right the brightness to fire the scintillation those three things did with the cut but it brings forth seven lights oh my god my god you are supposed to declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful life so when I read that scripture I did in fact emphatic die Glocke I couldn't help but go to the pergamene church age and I have to give you a quote that goes right along with that scripture now look at this you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation of people for a purpose a man that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful night that scripture went right along with a quote that the angel the Lord told the Prophet to pick up his pen and write and when the angel told the Prophet to pick up his pen and write the angel was writing a message not to the Prophet but the angel was writing a message to you o if an angel wrote a message to me I would want to know what the angel had to say and I'm only giving you a portion of it but if you if you would go back and I mean the first time this was mentioned was in the message O Lord Jesus it slipped my mind it'll come back to me I had to come back to me the spoken word is the original seed first time it was mentioned now we pick it up in the church age book in the program in church a look at this the angel said this here's what I'm trying to say to you make it personal here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 111 and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever sea started the church will come forth and be like the original sea because it is the same seat in these last days the true bride church Christ will come to the headstone look at this and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him oh I love dams right amen because Peter said your chosen race right so a super race glory to God a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will be even in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation in the word of Living God denominations cannot produce this hallelujah denominations cannot produce this Rome see they will produce their crease in their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelized and brings forth a hybrid product when I looked at that scripture you have chosen race a royal priesthood a rosin a holy nation of people for a purpose that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light I couldn't help but go back to that quote because you you are supposed to be a super Church you're supposed to be a super race as you get closer to Christ now you know I had to I had to look at that word super cuz we use it so so casually you know we and everybody walk around with the Superman shirt and you know and now can I just I use them since I'm there the only time you see what Superman is made of is when it's impression if it ain't no pressure he's a reporter he just he just he got a different name when his the name is Clark Kent when he is not under pressure but but when pressure should come he don't talk to nobody I mean vacuum out there he used to go to a phone booth like you're making a telephone call and he come out with a cape on and and you know and everybody everybody just so so so so uh adamant about just you know I mean they're ready to show that answer on the chest huh but but even Superman has something that'll stop him Oh hallelujah that's why I'm not trying to be like Superman because as the Bride of Christ I cannot be stopped as an adopted son of God I cannot be stopped and when the pressure comes it will produce the power that is in my life these seeds have been sold and that's what's going to come forth but you have to wait for the opportunity before you actually display what is on the inside of you hallelujah Church right well not when I think about this word super what super means is surpassing others of its kind you're supposed to surpass others the NS Church is just like you they look like you they act like you they worship like you but just supposed to surpass them oh my god there's Christians that look just like you act like you but you're supposed to surpass them that's what super Church super race is all about we're supposed to surpass others of our kind God called us to be super all right let me go on a little further here this is our message Tahoma Jireh it says as we come up here to Sodom in a few minutes watch how it is how it takes place they're exactly how the promise is for the last day and what he would do he was confirming it showing that he tore the body of Jesus apart taking the spirit lifted up the body to the right hand of the throne of God and sat down the other part the party tore out the spirit upon us which is called the Holy Spirit and the very life that was in Christ is in you the very life that was in Christ is in you now and let me also just at this since we're we're already operating in the earnest of our adoption remember the statement of the Prophet me it says all that God was he poured into Jesus now we're operating in the earnest of our adoption but pressing into the fullness of it all right so so here all that God was he poured it into Jesus but he used a different verb when he talked about all that Jesus was he to say he poured it he says he's pouring so that's a continuation we're still receiving right he's pouring it into the church or the bride right so we're constantly receiving what God has for us a man I don't actually when I come and realize that I will never exhaust all that God is so I might as well just enjoy what I do have and keep expecting more hallelujah the very life that was in crisis at you that shows he's your Redeemer he's adopted you unto God and now are we sons and daughters of God with us with the Spirit of Christ a man works that I do show you do also greater than this show you do for I go into my father amen the spirit that was in him is on you eternal life he's the giver of eternal life he's a redeemer to bring back that which fell in the fall in the human race to bring back to God and the spirit that was that was in crisis in you and if the spirit of Dylan was in me I'd have God's if the spirit of an artist was in me I paint pictures if the Spirit of Christ is in you the works of Christ do Amen that's right the light that was in him is in you all right now let me just read maybe one or two more here and I'm gonna bring it to a close this revelation has got to be made real to us and my brother branham told us that the reason that a man we're lacking because we just don't feed on it enough so I just want to make sure I'm so in the right season to this church because this is my expectation and my expectation is not that we got to bring everything to the church to be prayed for by the pastor my expectations that you lay hands on the seat and you'll see them becoming a man that's that's my expectation not not you know oh ho I don't know what to do you already know what to do you know the Bible the Bible say if we lay hands on the sick you know yeah you got to do that Church and we're gonna hear the testimonies come forth from them oh look at this all right this is out of the message look away to Jesus Oh actually know before we read that believers position in Christ to believe its position in Christ let me read that they're not going to look away in - look away - Jesus don't take these things like the church you know we were in Sunday school this morning a quote that I ran into yesterday in a church age book and brother Branham talked about how the invasion of error that would come just before Jesus returns all right and and and the way it puts it like right at the time that the invasion of error comes that's the same time Jesus would be coming first church now when you catch it and you see it you know from that angle it ought to cause you to want to become a priests right where you're interceding on behalf of others because you realize just as lot had no idea destruction was on the way well I had no I we have clarity through a profit of what's getting ready to happen we see things happening he spoke that these things would happen we see it being fulfilled now we got to start standing the gap for others hallelujah right now you know we see these things in church we I mean this if there was ever a time now you know if I could just put it this way 60 years ago 50 years ago 40 years ago people have prayer-meeting feel the power of God in that place like mine God if you were to took prayer me and you were shook and everybody pressed to get to the premium that was not if that wasn't a service that you had to beg people to come to people knew they needed God's now we just take it so lightly right it's just prayer do you realize prayer is your greatest weapon do you realize that that if things are if things are gonna change it's gonna come through prayer and now you just push prayer to the side like it ain't right and and and I just just kind of bugs me you mean to tell me all your prayers but is all of them that you don't need to pray no more something wrong somewhere the church shouldn't be slacking up in this air and that the church should actually get in a hurry with God amen hallelujah glory to God and please please please don't lie to the Holy Ghost and don't lie to yourself we're a free at home don't get caught on the spot you might say a one-minute prayer at home you might say you might you might but if your schedule is anything like my schedule the devil blocked you from praying at home and we might as well be honest with ourselves uuuuu you may pray after you get a little texture and somebody pray for us essentially oh lord please heal such as such amen and you call it that prayer all right church of dads ever time to be praying now is that time and I tell you when you recognize how close this thing is and how the prophetess laid these things out we've seen it there it's feel right before their eyes it ought to cause us all to get more deeper in prayer that's what Abraham did when he knew lot was getting ready to go down he began to pray hallelujah all right let's go believers position in Christ says and they stay in Moses and Elijah appear so forth and so forth then they show him and they seem Jesus only when he looked back then God the Father after put in a robe on her son she said this is my beloved son hear him no wonder Jesus could say all the powers of heaven and earth that's given him to meet unto my hand for he was adopted by his father into the glorious kingdom of God now sitting in the majesty of the right hand above every Ark Angel and Angel every star Moon or every name that's named in heaven it's subject to the name of Jesus Christ but he was adopted by God the Father don't forget now you as the Son of God a man your words even greater than Archangels works amen we read that for you last week now sitting in the majesty of the right hand dr. Kemp's our paragraph the next paragraph now into his church you that's positionally is seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus be humble brethren someday the Holy Spirit will speak to you call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin on a hillside or in the washroom somewhere and there will anoint you for a certain service or certain thing to do it won't be the laying on of the hands of the presbytery elders it'll be the laying on the hands of God Almighty Himself to put a new ministry in you and a new robe on you and to set you out as an example and all the demons out of torment will never upset you god grant my brethren that will each one receive this blessing and it says shall we pray I want to just read one more a man to you and then we'll pray were closed off right there this is out of the message to look away to Jesus in this message look away to Jesus brother Branham makes a very striking statement that I'll read to you but he was talking about you know we're living in an hour we can expect a third pool that's what he was that he was talking about his third pool was the opening of the word amen but he he also made another comment about the third pool - that thing that we want to see here amen in this quote glory to God it says so now I'm gonna say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is that the thing that we have looked forward to for so long so we're constantly looking for we have the earnest but we are Amen still walking towards the fullness of our adoption which would be the body change it says I haven't said that all along and that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is it meant that he's referring back to the opening of the word okay it was already vindicated when God gave him the revelation of the seals nobody else ever received that nobody so so that opening of the word a man was very thats why I say you know we're not we're this is not to try to imitate brother Branham right you can't do that no one is gonna have the ministry that he had God gave that very specifically just like Paul's ministry was specific right God did that but when we talk about the power of God that was on display Jesus said these signs shall follow them that belief so we're supposed to expect those things okay so so here now he goes our senses and I remember they'll never be impersonation of that because they can't be see it cannot be now it's in existent and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it just happened so it could so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way Oh hallelujah it would not be used in a great way until this counselor begins to tighten up I want to I want to sew this one into the church it won't be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up so this don't mean you're gonna go out and start empty in the hospital rules that's not what this is all about it won't be used in a great wait until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals are so forked almost impersonally anything that can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested and the fullness of its power si si si si so what's going to push it out what's going to cause a man this of what we're talking about as far as our place in Christ what's going to push it out it's gonna be the pressure that we come under and like I was telling you all on Friday night a man a dime and gets his sparkle through the cutting through the pressure through the process that it has to go through a man before it actually you know becomes a real valuable diamond and I'll tell you what church we're gonna we got to we got to face some things we can't run from our trials glory got like like the entire army of Israel was running from Goliath but when David came on the scene the running stopped hallelujah it's gonna be some sons of God that's gone amen they probably just maybe something you ain't heard about like David had never heard about Goliath but he come into this cut look look look I can't stand this fella define the armies of the Living God hey I don't seen God deliver bear into my hand I don't sing God deliver lying into my hand and this fellas gonna be just like the lion or the bear and you know this David was speaking it out of his mouth before it actually came to pass and it was a man that was operating with no fear as the bright we're moving into a place no fear when the squeeze come what we've seen temporarily we manifested in the fullness I believe that I believe that and so it's not a season for us to get discouraged but this is a season for us to remain encouraged as what God has promised us he will bring it to pass this is the revelation that the sons of God needs in this hour let's pray father God we thank you for these promises that you've laid before us it's not a prophet that would share these things these are things that we didn't just hear in church as we were going up but God you you laid out these things and you told us God that we the reason that we don't see these things cuz we don't feed on it enough so lord help us to feed on it help us Lord to to walk in this we were already walking in the earnest stomach different things that have happened in our lives showing that we're walking in the earnest of it and these things that happening it's not something that we we try to create or make happen it happens because pressure produces it and Lord as our sons of God and daughters of God no fear no fear you've not given us a spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind so help us to operate father the way that you have called us to operate help us Lord to demonstrate a man your character and in demonstrating your character will also demonstrate your power and your authority we don't know what we'll face we don't know what we're running to even have to relieve this place today we have no idea but I do know this that you have prepared us for whatever the trial is you have prepared us you have you have already provided you have made a way and you are you are the way you are the truth you are the length life so god we just trust that you would help us a man to not uh not let this just go in one ear and out the other but help us to let it father really register the depth of our soul if there's anybody here just doubting of salvation God my prayer my prayer is that you give a revelation of who they are there's nothing they could do if they're if they were born of God children of God there's not one thing they can do that could ever separate them from the family of God that's not anything for us to take advantage of the Lord that's something I should call just to walk humbly before you to recognize that your love is your love goes beyond our false your love goes beyond my failures of your love goes beyond our mistakes what love what matchless love God we thank you for that so I pray Lord that each one will receive what you're trying to bring to them today God is in the mighty name of Jesus that we ask it amen I'm a man let's give the Lord a hand of praise go to Solomon I'll give this urgency week Amen let's all stand to our feet and man brother Slava man just leave some songs of so in and before we leave you don't mind just stand behind I do want to just have a quick meeting with
