[0:16] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[0:17] one more time
[0:19] man
[0:21] um
[0:22] I'd like to just open our service by
[0:25] reading a scripture
[0:28] um
[0:29] brother Burley
[0:31] ministered at a youth service one time
[0:34] and he read this scripture and I think
[0:36] it's something very fitting for all of
[0:39] our youth it's out of Psalm 73.
[0:43] man Psalm 73 praise the Lord
[0:47] [Music]
[0:53] amen
[0:55] um
[0:58] praise the Lord it says
[1:00] truly God is good to Israel
[1:04] even to such as art of a clean heart
[1:08] but as for me my feet were almost gone
[1:11] my steps had well not slipped
[1:15] for I was envious at the foolish when I
[1:19] saw the prosperity of the wicked but
[1:22] there are no bands in their death but
[1:24] their strength is firm
[1:26] they are not in trouble as other men
[1:29] neither are they plagued like other men
[1:31] at least that's what it looked like to
[1:33] David
[1:34] says therefore Pride can passeth them
[1:36] about as a chain
[1:38] violence covered them as a garment their
[1:41] eyes stand out with fatness they have
[1:43] more than a heart could wish
[1:46] they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[1:49] concerning oppression they speak loftily
[1:52] they set their mouth against the heavens
[1:54] and their tongue walketh through the
[1:56] Earth
[1:57] therefore as people return hither in the
[1:59] waters of a full cup or wrong out to
[2:02] them
[2:03] and they say how does God know and is
[2:06] there knowledge in the most high the
[2:08] whole these are the ungodly who prosper
[2:10] in the world they increase in the riches
[2:13] verily I have cleansed my heart in vain
[2:16] again this is David's thoughts watching
[2:19] The Wicked prosper and he's just
[2:21] wondering you know what about me says
[2:22] barely have cleansed my heart in vain
[2:24] and washed my hands in innocency for all
[2:28] the day long have I been plagued and
[2:30] chasing every morning
[2:32] if I say I will speak thus behold I
[2:34] should have finned against the
[2:35] generation of thy children when I
[2:37] thought to know this it was too painful
[2:40] for me and I like this next verse until
[2:43] I went
[2:44] into the sanctuary of God
[2:47] then understood I therein amen looked
[2:52] like everybody else just having so much
[2:54] pleasure and they're prospering they're
[2:55] doing this they're doing that but I
[2:58] sacrifice and and I can't do this I
[3:01] can't go here I can't go there but
[3:03] there's an end to those things and
[3:05] there's also into these things Amen in
[3:08] the end to these things is eternal life
[3:11] amen so we're happy to be here again
[3:13] amen for youth service and I was just
[3:16] sharing with a brother just recently you
[3:18] know a church and they have quite a few
[3:21] young people but um in that church they
[3:24] have no events for the young people none
[3:26] whatsoever even though they have a bunch
[3:28] of young people and uh you know we might
[3:30] not have a man a whole bunch of young
[3:33] people but we will have events for the
[3:36] ones that we do have amen and as they
[3:38] say build it they'll come so we want to
[3:40] be faithful to our youth we want to give
[3:42] them every opportunity to draw closer to
[3:45] the Lord amen as we can let's pray amen
[3:47] man before we open the Service tonight
[3:49] Our Father
[3:51] we give you all the glory we give you
[3:56] all the honor we give you all the praise
[3:59] for who you are to us
[4:03] Lord as we uh just look here at the
[4:06] scripture that David was writing just
[4:08] looking at the wick and it seems like
[4:10] how they Prosper we all have thoughts
[4:12] like that where we look at others and we
[4:14] thank lord they're just doing so much
[4:16] better and we have to sacrifice and we
[4:18] have to do this we have to do that but
[4:20] David he considered all that but it says
[4:22] he was a little discouraged until he
[4:25] went into the house of the Lord he
[4:27] understood therein so Lord help us to
[4:29] understand that the sacrifices that
[4:31] we're making in moments like this Lord
[4:33] will have eternal rewards so we pray
[4:36] that you would bless Lord our youth as
[4:38] they come here tonight we trust that the
[4:41] spirit of God would have preeminence in
[4:42] this service and our worship Lord and

[35:44] well let us not prolong the time we'll
[35:46] open our Bibles
[35:48] will turn our Bibles this morning to a
[35:52] few chapters uh we want to start in the
[35:54] Book of Revelation
[35:56] chapter 12.
[35:59] and the Book of Galatians
[36:02] chapter 6. Revelation 12 the third
[36:04] chapter
[36:07] and we'll just read a
[36:10] till verse 9 in Galatians chapter 6
[36:14] verse 7 through 8.
[36:19] the same man when you're there
[36:21] praise go out all right third verse that
[36:24] reads
[36:25] and there appeared
[36:28] another Wonder in heaven and behold a
[36:31] great red dragon having seven heads and
[36:34] ten horns
[36:35] and seven crowns upon his head and his
[36:39] tale who drew the third part of the
[36:42] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[36:45] Earth
[36:46] now I remember with this verse I believe
[36:48] it was our Deacon that pointed out in
[36:51] his tell Drew the third part of the
[36:53] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[36:55] Earth his tale was the lies of Satan
[36:59] right that dual meaning the the lies
[37:02] that Satan calls even in heaven to cast
[37:04] the Angels Out of Heaven
[37:06] in verse 4 from verse 4 says his his
[37:11] tale drew the third part of the stars of
[37:12] heaven and did cast them to the earth
[37:15] and the dragon stood before the woman
[37:17] which was ready to be delivered for to
[37:20] devour her child as soon as it was born
[37:24] and she brought forth a man-child who
[37:27] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[37:29] iron and her child was caught up unto
[37:32] God and to his throne and the woman fled
[37:35] Into the Wilderness where she hath a
[37:37] place prepared of God that they should
[37:40] feed her there
[37:42] 1203 score days
[37:44] verse 7 and there was war in heaven
[37:46] Michael in his angels fought against the
[37:50] dragon and the dragon fought against and
[37:52] his angels and prevailed not neither was
[37:55] their place found any more in heaven and
[37:58] there that great Dragon was cast out
[38:00] that old serpent called the devil and
[38:03] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[38:06] was cast into the Earth and his angels
[38:09] were cast out with him
[38:11] we'll go to Galatians chapter 6.
[38:15] verse 7.
[38:17] it says be not deceived
[38:20] God is Not mocked
[38:23] for whatsoever a man soweth
[38:26] that shall he also weep for he that
[38:29] soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh
[38:32] reap corruption
[38:34] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[38:36] of the spirit reap everlasting life
[38:40] you may have your seats
[38:41] may the Lord add a blessing to his
[38:43] reading
[38:45] and I'm grateful for tonight
[38:48] um you know I want to
[38:50] just take this opportunity uh you know
[38:53] to just really have a talk to the young
[38:54] people
[38:55] as if I was sitting right before you
[38:58] face to face
[39:00] not so much in a preaching way but just
[39:03] having a talk
[39:05] um and I trust that God will bless your
[39:07] heart
[39:08] but we read in Revelation there and you
[39:10] realize that before
[39:13] the Earth was even created and Heaven uh
[39:17] there was such a there was a big war
[39:19] there the scripture says Michael and his
[39:22] angels fought against that dragon
[39:24] and uh one of the things that I want to
[39:28] point the young people to today is that
[39:31] you are in a great battle in this hour
[39:35] and you have been as our pastor kind of
[39:39] went into this uh on Wednesday I thought
[39:41] it was very I thought it was a
[39:42] confirmation but you have been selected
[39:44] you have been hand-picked in this day to
[39:48] fight this battle that you are in
[39:51] uh and now in this battle now it comes
[39:54] down to one thing it comes down to your
[39:56] choosing
[39:57] and that's the title of my sermon
[39:59] tonight is your choosing you see there's
[40:01] been many choices in this life and you
[40:04] will go in this world and have many
[40:07] choices right but the choices that you
[40:10] make must reflect the person that you
[40:13] want to be of course but it has to
[40:16] reflect the person God has called you to
[40:17] be
[40:18] that's the choice you want to make you
[40:20] you want to be able to realize that the
[40:23] choice that I made today my future self
[40:25] will be satisfied we'll be happy with
[40:28] that choice right now there's a lot of
[40:32] wrong choices that are around us and in
[40:34] fact today wrong choices are Justified
[40:37] right when people make wrong choices
[40:39] they try to call them oh they have
[40:41] mental health issues right oh they'll be
[40:44] in the mental institute right and
[40:46] brother Brandon's deal with actually a
[40:48] lot of mental health institutes but uh
[40:50] nowadays there's not that much anymore
[40:52] uh and I think there should be uh you
[40:55] know but but that's the that's the
[40:57] justifying cause of of having a wrong
[41:00] making the wrong decision people not
[41:03] wanting to take accountability for
[41:05] making the wrong choice but make get
[41:08] into a place where they're like oh it's
[41:09] mental health issues you know I've
[41:11] learned saints that you cannot medicate
[41:14] sin with sin you cannot do that you
[41:17] cannot medicate sin with sin you see the
[41:20] only way you can medicate sin is by by
[41:23] bring sin unto the Judgment of God right
[41:26] you bring sin to the Judgment of God it
[41:28] will disintegrate right the prophet says
[41:31] that before you can do wrong you have to
[41:34] cast out the word of God before you can
[41:36] do something evil you have to exit
[41:39] yourself out of the presence of God you
[41:42] see
[41:43] now the the prophet says here in this
[41:46] message the choosing of a bride
[41:48] he says in many things of life we are
[41:51] given a choice
[41:53] the way of life itself is a choice we
[41:56] have a right to make our own way choose
[41:58] our own way that we want to live
[42:00] education is a choice we can choose
[42:03] whether we're going to be educated or
[42:05] whether or not we're going to be
[42:06] educated that's the choice right and
[42:09] wrong is a choice every man and every
[42:11] boy uh and girl has the choice to choose
[42:14] whether or not they're going to try to
[42:15] live right and not live right it's a
[42:17] choice and I like this here it says
[42:19] choice is a great thing
[42:22] so the choice you have is a great
[42:25] opportunity and one of the best things
[42:27] about choices is that you have the
[42:28] choice right now to better the choices
[42:30] you've made
[42:32] the very opportunity right now you have
[42:35] the choice whatever the choice you've
[42:38] made in the past you can make that
[42:40] better choice at this very moment you
[42:42] see
[42:43] now it says Uh there's an unwritten law
[42:46] among us and that is choosing and in the
[42:50] scripture Galatians 6 10 it says as we
[42:53] therefore opportunity let us do good
[42:56] unto all men especially unto them who
[43:00] are of the household of faith you see
[43:02] it's not just a matter of coming to
[43:04] church
[43:05] you we have all these ministering
[43:07] brethrens that are faithful in the Lord
[43:09] they come and they feed us the word of
[43:12] God and I just want you to consider for
[43:15] a moment that uh these uh things are not
[43:18] to be taken for granted uh our pastor
[43:21] labors he puts in a lot of commitment
[43:23] and time a sacrifice for this uh so when
[43:28] you come into the presence of God you
[43:30] want to understand that God has a
[43:32] message prepared for you
[43:34] God has something that he knows that
[43:37] you're dealing with and he wants to
[43:38] bring you to the image of perfection
[43:41] you see
[43:42] now in this great battle we understand
[43:45] that there was a beginning to it
[43:48] and that's that that battle that we are
[43:51] fighting now started with Satan
[43:54] saying in his in his In His Image
[43:57] wanting to uh be like the most high uh
[44:01] right uh deceived the third of the
[44:03] angels in heaven uh and because of that
[44:05] we are on earth finding a Heavenly
[44:07] battle
[44:08] okay now
[44:11] Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 14. this is
[44:15] just a little past about Satan it says
[44:18] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[44:21] covereth
[44:22] and I have said thee so thou was upon
[44:26] the holy mountain of God thou Hast
[44:28] walked up and down in the midst of the
[44:30] stones of fire that was perfect in thy
[44:33] ways from the day that thou was created
[44:36] till the iniquity was found in thee I
[44:39] just want you to know who is constantly
[44:42] attacking you
[44:44] in verse 16 it says by the multitude of
[44:47] thy merchandise they have filled the
[44:50] midst of thee with violence and thou has
[44:53] sinned therefore I will cast thee as
[44:55] profane out of the Mountain of God and I
[44:58] will destroy thee all covering cherub
[45:01] from the midst of the stones of fire
[45:03] thine heart was lifted up before thy
[45:06] Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by
[45:09] reason of the brightness I will cast
[45:12] thee to the ground I will lay thee
[45:14] before kings that they may be holy you
[45:17] see Satan
[45:18] could not get to a place to accept that
[45:22] the way that he was created was for
[45:24] God's glory the way that he was created
[45:27] was for God's purpose and because he
[45:30] felt to see that the mechanics that was
[45:33] in him that made him who he was he
[45:36] allowed he came to a place where he
[45:38] surrendered to those mechanics and his
[45:40] his fall began when he lifted himself in
[45:44] his heart and that's why it's so
[45:46] important that whatever you do uh
[45:49] whether it's how you look how you decide
[45:51] to dress yourself how you decide to
[45:54] speak to other people all these things
[45:56] are so important because they're either
[45:58] going to reflect Satan or they're going
[46:00] to reflect God and you want to make sure
[46:03] that the scripture even says you know
[46:05] what man of conversation have ye so your
[46:08] conversations ought to always be holy
[46:10] right and and your the way you conduct
[46:14] yourself ought to always be holy these
[46:17] are the ways that God finds p pleasing
[46:19] to you okay but we realize that when it
[46:23] comes to the beautiful things of this
[46:25] Earth those are the things that Satan
[46:27] are associated associated with
[46:29] right now in Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12
[46:33] it says how art thou fallen from Heaven
[46:36] o Lucifer son of the morning how about
[46:39] cut down to the ground which did weaken
[46:41] the Nations for thou has said in our
[46:44] heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will
[46:46] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[46:49] will also sit upon the Mount of the
[46:52] congregation in the sides of the north I
[46:55] will Ascend above the heights of the
[46:57] cloud I will be like the most high and I
[47:00] want you to know that Satan has
[47:01] fulfilled that
[47:03] the prophet preaches a message
[47:06] Satan's Eden uh he's fulfilled a
[47:09] perversion a perverted version of that
[47:11] because this we're the world you see
[47:14] today is Satan's Eden you see and that's
[47:17] why it's so important that you do not
[47:20] get confused or disappointed when you
[47:23] don't look like the world right because
[47:26] the world is Satan's Eden so when you
[47:30] see a friend looking a certain way
[47:32] talking a certain way dressed a certain
[47:34] way right that should alert you that
[47:37] that person is not walking the lifestyle
[47:40] I'm walking
[47:41] so
[47:43] always keep that in mind young people
[47:45] and the message uh
[47:48] greatest battle ever fall
[47:50] it says Prophet says in paragraph 60 so
[47:53] Army first and getting ready for a
[47:56] battle
[47:57] first there's got to be a select some
[47:59] soldiers they've got to be dressed for
[48:02] fighting they've got to be trained for
[48:05] fighting and I believe that the greatest
[48:07] battle that was ever fought is now ready
[48:11] to go in action I believe that God has
[48:14] been selecting his soldiers I believe
[48:17] he's been dressing them training them
[48:19] and the Battlefront is now set and
[48:22] getting ready to start
[48:24] and uh we'll just jump to paragraph uh
[48:27] 63
[48:29] and he says
[48:31] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[48:34] cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell
[48:37] on human beings he's talking about the
[48:39] original sin that create that was
[48:41] started in heaven then he said and then
[48:44] the battle from Angels became human
[48:46] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[48:49] creation what God had created to be for
[48:52] himself
[48:53] he had Satan come to destroy this that's
[48:57] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[49:00] and I like this because the prophet says
[49:03] God had Satan to come and destroy it
[49:05] that's what his purpose was was to
[49:08] destroy it then the battle began here on
[49:10] Eighth on Earth and beginning us and has
[49:14] been raging ever since
[49:16] and uh paragraph 68 will jump there it
[49:20] reads when this great battle started on
[49:22] Earth there had to be a mutual place
[49:24] there had to be a place selected for the
[49:27] battle to begin and for the battle to
[49:30] rage so we'll just stop right there for
[49:33] now there was a place where the battle
[49:35] began
[49:37] right when we look through the the
[49:39] church history we notice that a fee of
[49:43] the Paul started in the Church of
[49:44] Ephesus and he laid down the word that
[49:48] was our foundation we we still read that
[49:50] today from from from
[49:52] Ephesians we go to Iranians day from
[49:55] Iranians we go to Martin and up until
[49:57] Martin Luther John Wesley and there was
[50:01] a a a a a work that God was doing and
[50:05] that was God preparing his soldiers for
[50:07] battle
[50:08] all of those times God Was preparing his
[50:11] soldiers for battle but the prophet said
[50:13] that the battle began and there was a
[50:17] time for the battle to rage
[50:19] and and the prophet says the battle
[50:22] grounds begin in the human mind
[50:25] so when you when you let's say you're
[50:28] creating a super soldier
[50:30] you're creating that soldier from the
[50:31] ground up
[50:33] the body is built but now comes a place
[50:36] where the mind has to be conditioned to
[50:40] overcome the truck the battle the mind
[50:42] has to be conditioned to to defeat the
[50:45] enemy on the other side and now the
[50:49] Battleground is in the human mind today
[50:52] which means that
[50:54] the mind that that that that that we the
[50:57] day that we're living in right now where
[50:59] we have all these resources we have all
[51:02] these great things right it's become the
[51:06] biggest trial any young person can go
[51:08] through because they have to make a
[51:11] choice whether they're going to accept
[51:12] that or deny it
[51:15] you see and when you consider the mind
[51:19] the Mind deals with
[51:21] uh imaginations constants memory reasons
[51:25] and affections and those things if
[51:28] you're not careful it will lead you
[51:31] instead of you leading it
[51:33] okay you cannot be led of your emotions
[51:37] over your memory
[51:39] we could talk about memory for a little
[51:41] bit right you might have done something
[51:44] that you weren't supposed to do right
[51:46] but you have to be willing to allow God
[51:49] to start something new in you every day
[51:51] right
[51:53] so you have to forget about that memory
[51:55] you have to forget about what happened
[51:57] and reasoning right the Bible says you
[52:00] have to cast down your reasoning you see
[52:03] that part of you has to come unto
[52:06] submission of your decision to follow
[52:08] Christ
[52:09] same goes with your imaginations your
[52:12] imagination is going to lead you wild
[52:14] you're going to have all sorts of
[52:15] thoughts you see uh the scripture well
[52:18] brother random says you know you you can
[52:20] you can battle against a bird or animal
[52:23] but you have to make the choice whether
[52:25] it's going to Nest or not
[52:28] so you have the decision whether you're
[52:30] going to accept those things or deny it
[52:33] and uh and then it talks about uh of
[52:37] course you have who you are as a
[52:40] Believer and when you talk about who you
[52:44] really are it's you in the soul that's
[52:48] the nature of the the spirit is the
[52:50] nature of your soul so you have to
[52:53] recognize that
[52:55] what you do with your flesh or what you
[52:58] sow to your flesh is going to lead to
[53:00] corruption
[53:01] but what you sow to the spirit will lead
[53:04] to everlasting life
[53:06] so that's the part that you have to
[53:10] think about every day and in doing that
[53:13] realizing that that's the part that God
[53:15] created in His image
[53:17] before Adam and God before Adam and Eve
[53:20] uh was created uh In the Flesh they were
[53:24] created in the spirit
[53:27] now
[53:28] I want to encourage you this evening
[53:31] that as you have the opportunity to
[53:33] choose choose right make the right
[53:37] choice
[53:38] now we want to just go through a few
[53:40] places here
[53:42] and we'll a few places where we see
[53:45] those in the scripture that did not make
[53:48] the right choice
[53:49] right
[53:51] now we can think about the Rich Young
[53:53] Ruler he didn't make the right choices
[53:55] all right he had the opportunity to
[53:57] accept Christ but he didn't do that we
[54:00] could talk about
[54:02] uh Judas Judas didn't make the right
[54:04] choice
[54:05] uh but
[54:07] as the battle is in the mind
[54:09] I want to focus on those that God called
[54:13] for a purpose those that God called for
[54:16] himself that also failed to make the
[54:18] right choice now we can start with
[54:20] Samson right Samson was created to
[54:24] destroy the very enemy that he was
[54:26] brought up to to destroy but he started
[54:29] to Fellowship not just Fellowship but he
[54:31] had a desire in his heart
[54:34] he had a love in his heart
[54:36] forward was on the other side
[54:39] and when you understand your purpose you
[54:42] have to be able to lay aside your own
[54:44] desires you have to lay aside the things
[54:47] that you like the most the things that
[54:49] are most dearest to you so that you can
[54:51] accomplish God's purpose right
[54:54] now we can just read it here in Judges
[54:57] chapter 16 verse 4.
[55:00] it says and it came to pass afterward
[55:02] that he loved a woman in the valley of
[55:05] sorek whose name was Delilah and the
[55:08] Lords of the Philistine Came Upon her
[55:11] and said unto her entice him
[55:14] and see where in his great strength
[55:17] lieth and by what means we may prevail
[55:20] against him that we may bind him to
[55:23] afflict him and we will give thee every
[55:25] one of us Eleven Hundred of pieces of
[55:27] silver
[55:28] you see the enemy in this case has been
[55:31] studying Samson
[55:33] he he the enemy knew what Samson's
[55:35] weaknesses were
[55:37] and because of that it was an
[55:38] opportunity for them to Prevail because
[55:41] they're a game plan at this moment was
[55:43] Delilah go and tie Samson because he has
[55:47] his heart is for you
[55:49] now scripture goes on in chapter six and
[55:52] verse 6 it says Delilah said unto Samson
[55:55] tell me I pray thee wherein thy great
[55:58] strength light and wherein thou might be
[56:01] bound to afflict thee and as I read this
[56:04] I thought it was quite strange because
[56:06] Delilah didn't cut any corners
[56:09] she made it very clear to Samson that
[56:12] I'm coming to put you in bondage
[56:15] so tell me how I can do that and
[56:19] oftentimes young people
[56:21] you are working with the Enemy to
[56:24] destroy your own self
[56:25] and and that's the part where you have
[56:28] to realize that the enemy is not as
[56:30] strong as you think he is
[56:32] because you are
[56:34] the the very instrument he's using for
[56:38] defeat which means you are the same
[56:40] instrument that you can use for yourself
[56:42] for victory
[56:45] so you have to remember that
[56:49] in verse 15
[56:51] we'll jump to that
[56:53] and she said unto him eventually Samson
[56:56] didn't take heed to that but Samson did
[56:59] play along
[57:00] because it took a few times before she
[57:05] could actually deceive Samson
[57:07] but here she says how can thou say I
[57:09] love thee when thine heart is not with
[57:12] me
[57:13] thou has mocked me these three times and
[57:15] has not told me wherein thy great
[57:17] strength life and it came to pass when
[57:21] she pressed him daily with her words and
[57:24] urged him so that his soul was vexed
[57:26] unto death that he told her his whole
[57:30] heart and said unto her there hath not
[57:32] come a razor upon my head for I have
[57:34] been a Nazareth unto God for my from my
[57:37] mother's room if I be shaving then my
[57:40] strength will go away from me and I
[57:42] shall become weak and be like any other
[57:45] man
[57:46] this is when Samson made the wrong
[57:48] choice
[57:50] well he he made the wrong choice to be
[57:52] there to begin with but but but he
[57:54] sealed his choice when he eventually
[57:56] told the other enemy where what his real
[57:59] weakness was
[58:00] and you know the story that
[58:03] as they came to Prevail against Samson
[58:07] it took Samson and before I get there
[58:10] Samson actually uh
[58:12] the scripture says he tried to raise up
[58:15] like other times and then he said to
[58:17] himself I will go and raise up like I've
[58:21] done before see Samson for God that his
[58:24] strength didn't come from himself it
[58:26] came from God
[58:27] so whatever situation you find yourself
[58:29] in always remember God has you there for
[58:32] a purpose God has you there for a reason
[58:34] and it's God that's obligated to take
[58:37] you out of that
[58:41] now he he found himself in this place of
[58:44] defeat right but it took Samson
[58:47] remembering who he was remembering the
[58:50] purpose he was created for and Samson
[58:54] was so determined to fulfill that
[58:57] purpose his own life didn't even matter
[59:00] he was willing to fulfill that purpose
[59:02] at the cost of his own death and the
[59:04] scripture says he defeated killed over 3
[59:09] 000 or more Philistines than he that he
[59:11] when he was alive in his death you see
[59:14] that was a testimony that he left behind
[59:16] right
[59:18] and I and I used him as an example
[59:20] because we know that Samson uh right he
[59:24] had a confident with God he was what we
[59:27] would call today a believer
[59:29] now another person
[59:32] that uh that didn't make the right
[59:35] choice
[59:36] I actually want to read this quote the
[59:38] prophet says in the Forgotten Beatitudes
[59:41] he says God can only use what part you
[59:45] yield to him
[59:46] God can only use what part you yield to
[59:50] him
[59:51] and that's important young people
[59:53] the prophet goes on to say God can use
[59:55] what you yield like Samson Samson would
[59:57] not yield his Hearts to God he gave that
[1:00:00] to Delilah but he gave his threat to God
[1:00:03] and God could only use his strength
[1:00:05] that's all but if a fellow could only
[1:00:08] yield his complete being to God now
[1:00:11] that's if you can yield your body God
[1:00:14] will use your body if you can yield your
[1:00:17] mind God will use your mind your heart
[1:00:19] Whatever It Is God will use what you
[1:00:21] give to him
[1:00:22] uh to use with he's seeking somebody
[1:00:25] that he can find yielded like that
[1:00:28] so you see God is finding vessels that
[1:00:31] he can dwell himself in and use you for
[1:00:34] his glory
[1:00:36] in verse two I'm sorry and uh II Timothy
[1:00:39] verse chapter 2 verse 3 and 4.
[1:00:44] I want to pull that up here and just
[1:00:46] want to bring this to your attention
[1:00:48] second Timothy
[1:00:50] chapter 2 verse 3.
[1:00:57] you know people it's important to bring
[1:00:58] your Bible to church
[1:01:02] I've given you time to pull the
[1:01:04] scriptures up
[1:01:10] see you guys depending on the technology
[1:01:13] but
[1:01:15] in like the scriptures when you hear the
[1:01:18] Turning of the pages
[1:01:20] so second Timothy Chapter 2 Verse 3
[1:01:23] it says Thou therefore
[1:01:26] endure hardness
[1:01:28] as a good soldier of Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] no man that worth entangleth himself
[1:01:33] with the Affairs of this life
[1:01:36] that he may please him who hath chosen
[1:01:40] him to be a soldier
[1:01:43] see here we find that
[1:01:46] you were chosen for this battle
[1:01:50] but Paul is saying to us in Timothy
[1:01:54] as you are in the world are you as you
[1:01:56] are in this war
[1:01:58] at no time
[1:02:00] should you have time
[1:02:02] to entangle yourself with the Affairs of
[1:02:04] this life
[1:02:05] and I know we're all guilty of it I'm
[1:02:07] guilty of it
[1:02:09] but it's important to recognize that
[1:02:12] they profit nothing
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:16] it says that you may be may please him
[1:02:19] who has chosen him to be a soldier God
[1:02:23] has chosen you to fight this battle in
[1:02:25] this day
[1:02:27] and there's a way that God expects you
[1:02:29] to to conduct yourself so that you can
[1:02:33] overcome those battles
[1:02:36] now
[1:02:37] in second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1 and
[1:02:40] 2.
[1:02:41] we find
[1:02:43] a soldier
[1:02:45] that did eventually entangle himself
[1:02:47] with the affairs
[1:02:49] a soldier that entangled himself with
[1:02:51] the Affairs of this world
[1:02:54] in verse 1 in Samuel second Samuel
[1:02:56] chapter 11 we'll go ahead and read that
[1:02:59] second Samuel chapter 11.
[1:03:03] and it says and it came to pass
[1:03:06] after the year was expired at the time
[1:03:09] when kings go forth to battle
[1:03:12] that David sent joab and his servants
[1:03:15] with him in All Israel and they
[1:03:18] destroyed the children of Ammon and
[1:03:20] besage rabba
[1:03:22] but David Terry still at Jerusalem
[1:03:26] see David was supposed to be in battle
[1:03:28] with his army
[1:03:29] but he decided to stay back this day he
[1:03:31] says you know what I'm just gonna stay
[1:03:34] back they got it and they overcame
[1:03:38] verse 2 says and it came to pass an even
[1:03:40] time that David arose from his bed and
[1:03:45] walked upon the roof of his King's house
[1:03:47] and from the roof he saw a woman washing
[1:03:51] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[1:03:53] to look upon see because David decided
[1:03:57] to stay behind when his army went forth
[1:03:59] to battle he was in a place that he had
[1:04:01] no business being
[1:04:03] right and and and this is what the
[1:04:06] scripture would call a tangler himself
[1:04:09] but David decided that what what he
[1:04:12] would and I'm sure at this point David
[1:04:15] had uh some sort of idea that
[1:04:19] that this woman would be there
[1:04:22] but he went there he saw this woman and
[1:04:25] it automatically created a battle
[1:04:28] right and in this battle
[1:04:31] David began to plot on how he could make
[1:04:36] this woman his wife
[1:04:37] and verse 14
[1:04:40] and it came to pass in that morning that
[1:04:43] David wrote a letter to joab and sent it
[1:04:46] by the hand of Uriah now Uriah was the
[1:04:49] husband of this woman Bathsheba
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:53] you know I I like the the the life of
[1:04:57] Uriah because
[1:04:59] you know when Uriah came back from that
[1:05:01] battle
[1:05:02] David tried to send him home
[1:05:04] and Uriah said to David
[1:05:07] you know uh we're intense uh the the
[1:05:10] children the Israel Judah they're
[1:05:13] they're there we need to be ready for
[1:05:15] this battle
[1:05:16] so I go home and eat
[1:05:19] and you know David says you know you can
[1:05:22] remain here for a little while for two
[1:05:24] days
[1:05:25] and then this is when David decided that
[1:05:27] he was going to put Uriah in a position
[1:05:29] to take him out
[1:05:31] right the way to to to take Beth Sheba
[1:05:35] to himself was a way to take take your
[1:05:37] Uriah out
[1:05:39] so
[1:05:40] in verse uh eventually Uriah went to
[1:05:44] battle and David's commission or letter
[1:05:47] was that put Uriah in the Forefront of
[1:05:50] the hottest battle
[1:05:52] put him in a position where he would be
[1:05:54] by himself
[1:05:55] you see it it was a decision that was
[1:05:59] that was selfish it was a decision that
[1:06:02] didn't have no consideration for who
[1:06:07] would lose and and what would what would
[1:06:10] be lost you see but David
[1:06:14] when he did this in verse 26
[1:06:19] right it says that verse 26 we'll skip
[1:06:21] there and the wife and when the wife of
[1:06:24] Uriah heard that
[1:06:27] Uriah her husband was dead she mourned
[1:06:30] for her husband
[1:06:32] and when the morning was passed David
[1:06:34] sat fetched her into her house and she
[1:06:37] became his wife
[1:06:39] and bear him a son
[1:06:41] now David didn't even wait whole 24 hour
[1:06:45] the very next morning didn't think about
[1:06:47] her morning then think about that he
[1:06:50] died the very next morning
[1:06:53] my plan worked
[1:06:55] you could come out to me
[1:06:57] but the scripture says this thing that
[1:07:00] David had done displeased the Lord
[1:07:04] so you got to be careful that you might
[1:07:06] have a plan
[1:07:08] you might have an idea
[1:07:11] but is it pleasing to God
[1:07:13] is it pleasing to the Lord
[1:07:15] because this thing that David had done
[1:07:18] was not pleasing to God and we find in
[1:07:21] the second chapter in this next chapter
[1:07:22] there in verse 12 I'm sorry chapter 12
[1:07:25] verse 1. God sent Nathan to David
[1:07:30] and we'll read it together here verse
[1:07:32] one it says and the Lord sent Nathan
[1:07:34] unto David
[1:07:35] and he came unto him and said unto him
[1:07:39] there were two men in one city
[1:07:42] the one rich and the one poor the rich
[1:07:45] man had exceeding many flocks and herds
[1:07:47] but the poor man had nothing save one
[1:07:50] little Eve ulam which he had bought and
[1:07:53] nourished up and it grew up together
[1:07:55] with him and with his children it did
[1:07:59] eat of his own meat and drink of his own
[1:08:02] cup and lay in his bosom and was unto
[1:08:05] him as a daughter
[1:08:06] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[1:08:09] man and he spared to take of his own
[1:08:12] flock and of his own herd to dress for
[1:08:15] the wayfaring man that was come upon him
[1:08:17] but took the poor man's lamb and dressed
[1:08:20] it for that man that was come to him
[1:08:24] in verse 5 and Davis anger was greatly
[1:08:27] kindled against the man and he said to
[1:08:30] Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that
[1:08:32] hath done this thing shall surely die
[1:08:34] and he shall restore the land fourfold
[1:08:37] because he did this thing and because he
[1:08:39] had no pity
[1:08:41] in verse 7 Nathan said unto him Thou Art
[1:08:44] the man
[1:08:46] you see when David was pointing fingers
[1:08:48] at this man
[1:08:50] not realizing who that man was he forgot
[1:08:53] there was three fingers pointing back at
[1:08:55] him
[1:08:56] and he when when Nathan told him that
[1:08:59] you are that man
[1:09:01] you know I can imagine how David felt
[1:09:03] but I know he felt that he made the
[1:09:06] wrong choice because in Psalms 51 it
[1:09:09] says I have acknowledged my
[1:09:11] transgression before me
[1:09:13] you see
[1:09:14] but David made the wrong choice here
[1:09:16] right and
[1:09:19] this Choice meant to a lot of other
[1:09:21] wrong choices
[1:09:22] right the Lord said to him because you
[1:09:26] have done this thing I will raise up
[1:09:28] evil in thy house
[1:09:30] right that that was God's word to David
[1:09:34] but I like what God Said after that
[1:09:36] because there was a little disclaimer
[1:09:38] right and usually disclaimers are really
[1:09:41] you know not really positive things
[1:09:43] disclaimers are full of contingencies
[1:09:46] but in this case
[1:09:48] God had to reassure David
[1:09:50] in verse 12
[1:09:52] it says at verse 13 rather it says and
[1:09:55] David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[1:09:58] against the Lord and Nathan said unto
[1:10:00] David the Lord also hath put away thy
[1:10:03] sin thou shall not die
[1:10:07] you see God had to be specific with this
[1:10:09] because David had responded to Nathan
[1:10:12] that this man shall surely die
[1:10:15] and God knew that
[1:10:18] what um what a king speaks must come to
[1:10:21] pass
[1:10:23] if a king says thus it will be thus no
[1:10:26] matter the situation right but that was
[1:10:30] aching and a king had to come to
[1:10:32] surrender to the king
[1:10:34] and the King said thou shall not die
[1:10:38] whatever they whatever a king said it
[1:10:41] was overwritten by what the king said
[1:10:44] you see
[1:10:46] and uh in verse 24
[1:10:50] it says and David
[1:10:53] comforted Bathsheba his wife now the
[1:10:56] reason he was comforting his wife is
[1:10:58] because one of the first things that
[1:11:00] happened as a as a fruit of what Dave
[1:11:03] David's Choice was is his firstborn was
[1:11:06] died who died
[1:11:07] now when his firstborn died David tried
[1:11:11] to pray against it tried to fast against
[1:11:13] it try to mourn against it but God had
[1:11:17] already spoke that evil would be raised
[1:11:20] up in your home
[1:11:21] now it says David comforted his wife and
[1:11:24] went unto her and lay with her and she
[1:11:27] barely a son and he called his name
[1:11:29] Solomon and the Lord loved him
[1:11:33] he said I thought this was very
[1:11:34] interesting
[1:11:35] because the Lord was displeased with an
[1:11:38] act that David had done
[1:11:41] but here he loved the fruit that was
[1:11:43] produced by the very same Act
[1:11:46] now this is to say that you young people
[1:11:49] you will sow seeds into who you are in
[1:11:52] the flesh
[1:11:53] but you were also sow seed into who you
[1:11:57] are in the spirit
[1:11:59] and once you sow into In the Flesh will
[1:12:01] reap corruption but what you sow in the
[1:12:04] spirit will reap eternal life
[1:12:06] see God turned a crime scene into a Plan
[1:12:09] of Redemption
[1:12:11] God turned David from a murderer with a
[1:12:14] death penalty to a masterpiece in
[1:12:17] restoring his Temple
[1:12:19] now my question to you y'all people what
[1:12:21] can God do for you what can God turn you
[1:12:24] from
[1:12:25] you see
[1:12:26] God can turn it around
[1:12:28] and I've seen them do it
[1:12:33] now making the right choice
[1:12:36] requires faithfulness
[1:12:40] in Daniel
[1:12:42] will go and read a few things here
[1:12:45] but we find another man
[1:12:48] that we we see that made the right
[1:12:50] choice
[1:12:51] and no doubt we can go to various places
[1:12:54] but I thought his testimony
[1:12:57] was astonishing
[1:12:59] now in Daniel chapter 6 verse 1
[1:13:05] it says it please Darius to set over the
[1:13:08] kingdom
[1:13:09] and 120 princes
[1:13:12] we should be all over the whole Kingdom
[1:13:14] and over these three presidents of whom
[1:13:18] Daniel was first that these princes
[1:13:21] might give accounts unto them and the
[1:13:24] King should have no damage then this
[1:13:27] Daniel was preferred above the
[1:13:30] presidents and princes because an
[1:13:32] excellent Spirit was in him and the King
[1:13:35] thought to set him over the whole realm
[1:13:38] So Daniel had already found favor with
[1:13:41] this King
[1:13:42] you see now Daniel was in a position
[1:13:45] where if he went right he was blessed if
[1:13:48] he went left he was still blessed
[1:13:51] and his enemy said adversaries recognize
[1:13:55] that and in verse 4
[1:13:57] it says then the presidents and princes
[1:14:00] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[1:14:03] concerning the kingdom but they could
[1:14:06] find that
[1:14:07] occasion nor fault and I want you to
[1:14:10] realize this young people the reason
[1:14:12] they could not find any occasion the
[1:14:15] reason they could not find any fault
[1:14:17] it says here
[1:14:19] because for as much he was faithful
[1:14:23] and I thought that was very important
[1:14:26] you see in your faithfulness to God
[1:14:29] our people might say all kinds of things
[1:14:33] but when you are faithful to him he will
[1:14:36] be faithful to you
[1:14:37] see you're not just being faithful to a
[1:14:40] god you're being faithful to the god
[1:14:44] that created heavens and earth you're
[1:14:46] being faithful to the god that can
[1:14:49] create out of nothing you're being
[1:14:51] faithful to the god that can come on
[1:14:54] this scene right now and change the
[1:14:56] situation
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:59] now this was Daniel's testimony for as
[1:15:03] much as he was found faithful they could
[1:15:05] not find they could not find any
[1:15:06] occasion against him and maybe the
[1:15:09] enemy's trying to find an occasion
[1:15:10] against you tonight right but he can't
[1:15:13] find none because you're here every
[1:15:15] Wednesday you're here every Sunday
[1:15:17] you're in church Faithfully
[1:15:20] but the enemy's plan don't stop there it
[1:15:23] don't stop because he knows what you're
[1:15:26] faithful to
[1:15:27] because here in this case
[1:15:31] and we'll read it together here
[1:15:33] verse 5. then said these men we shall
[1:15:37] not find occasion against this Daniel
[1:15:40] except we find it against him concerning
[1:15:43] the law of his God
[1:15:45] you see the enemy if he can't defeat you
[1:15:48] he'll join what you're a part of
[1:15:51] and when he joins you what you're part
[1:15:53] of he tries to misrepresent this word
[1:15:57] he'll try to make you disbelief the word
[1:16:00] make you realize or see that there's
[1:16:03] something wrong with this message
[1:16:04] there's something wrong with this word
[1:16:06] oh you know this message is too strict
[1:16:08] oh I see other believers well they're
[1:16:11] doing this they're doing that but but
[1:16:13] I'm doing this and I don't see what it's
[1:16:15] doing right but it's what our pastor
[1:16:17] read earlier right the wicked could
[1:16:20] Prosper but when you come into the
[1:16:22] congregation of the Lord then you can
[1:16:24] understand there I am but also your end
[1:16:27] you see because the believer doesn't
[1:16:30] have an end
[1:16:31] so you go from Victory to Victory from
[1:16:35] eternity to Eternity you see so when you
[1:16:39] realize that young people
[1:16:43] praise the Lord
[1:16:45] praise the Lord
[1:16:49] that's all right brother
[1:16:51] so
[1:16:52] this is what they decided to do
[1:16:55] eventually right say I we will find a
[1:16:59] fault against them concerning the law of
[1:17:00] his God now we'll read verse 6 here
[1:17:04] now
[1:17:06] but I wanted to mention this as well
[1:17:08] when I came to this scripture
[1:17:10] I actually was not sure if I should call
[1:17:13] the title of this sermon you're choosing
[1:17:16] or your faithfulness
[1:17:19] and I've come to realize that your
[1:17:21] choosing must be your faithfulness your
[1:17:24] faithfulness to his word your
[1:17:26] faithfulness to God your faithfulness to
[1:17:29] what he's revealed to you through his
[1:17:31] word
[1:17:32] that has to be your choosing
[1:17:35] you see it says that uh the man that
[1:17:38] endureth until the end he shall be saved
[1:17:42] verse 6 says then these presidents and
[1:17:45] princes assembled together to the king
[1:17:47] and said thus unto him King Darius live
[1:17:51] forever all the presidents of the king
[1:17:54] the governors and the princes the
[1:17:56] counselors and the captains have
[1:17:58] consulted together to establish a royal
[1:18:01] statute and to make a firm decree that
[1:18:06] whosoever shall ask a petition of any
[1:18:09] God or man or 30 days save of thee O
[1:18:14] King he shall be cast into the Den of
[1:18:17] Lions now I just want to stop here for a
[1:18:19] moment
[1:18:20] and realize how it took all these men
[1:18:23] all these Great Men
[1:18:26] and that's what the enemy does to you
[1:18:28] he assembles himself with the armies of
[1:18:31] his kingdom to find occasion against you
[1:18:35] and how he can defeat you which means
[1:18:37] he's studying you he's studying when you
[1:18:40] wake up he's studying you in your prayer
[1:18:42] life he's studying you and how you
[1:18:44] receive the word he's studying you not
[1:18:46] when you're in church when you're
[1:18:48] outside the church
[1:18:50] that's when he's studying you
[1:18:52] to find occasion to find fault
[1:18:56] that's what these were doing to Daniel
[1:19:00] now
[1:19:02] in verse 8
[1:19:03] says narrow King establish the decree
[1:19:06] and signed a writing that it be not
[1:19:09] changed according to the law of the
[1:19:11] meetings and the Persians which alter it
[1:19:13] not so they knew once the king signed it
[1:19:16] it was sealed
[1:19:19] verse 9 wherefore King Darius
[1:19:21] signed the writing and a decree
[1:19:25] now when Daniel knew
[1:19:27] I like that when Daniel knew that the
[1:19:30] writing was signed he went into his
[1:19:32] house and his windows being open in his
[1:19:37] chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon
[1:19:40] his knees three times a day and prayed
[1:19:43] and gave thanks before his God as he did
[1:19:46] a four times
[1:19:49] you see faith is bold faithfulness knows
[1:19:52] no defeat I said faithfulness knows no
[1:19:55] defeat
[1:19:56] see Daniel how to make a mind and he had
[1:20:00] a choice even after he knew the king's
[1:20:02] decree he decided that he was going to
[1:20:05] continue his faithfulness and young
[1:20:08] people I encourage you no matter what
[1:20:10] love is past he she them
[1:20:13] faithful to God
[1:20:16] faithful to God
[1:20:19] so your choices must always reflect
[1:20:21] God's Eternal purpose for your life
[1:20:24] because he remained faithful God could
[1:20:26] reckon God could show his faithfulness
[1:20:29] to Daniel you see in our verse 11
[1:20:33] the king's decree a king's decree
[1:20:37] it says these men
[1:20:39] assembled and found Daniel praying and
[1:20:42] making supplication before his God
[1:20:45] then they came near and spanked before
[1:20:48] the king concerning the king's decree
[1:20:52] see they they were not done studying
[1:20:54] after they studied now they they started
[1:20:56] to eavesdrop on his prayer perhaps they
[1:20:59] heard Daniel asking for great things
[1:21:02] asking for healing for the nation
[1:21:04] perhaps they heard Daniel Prayed for the
[1:21:07] sick
[1:21:07] right
[1:21:09] but it goes on the same hast thou not
[1:21:13] signed a decree that every man that
[1:21:16] shall ask a petition of any God or man
[1:21:19] within 30 days save of thee O King shall
[1:21:23] be cast into the dens of line the king
[1:21:25] answered and says the thing is true
[1:21:28] according to the law of the meetings and
[1:21:30] the Persians which altereth not see
[1:21:33] despite of them knowing that Daniel was
[1:21:36] praying right it didn't affect their
[1:21:40] choice
[1:21:41] to continue to find an occasion against
[1:21:43] Daniel and verse 13 it says then answer
[1:21:45] they and said before the king
[1:21:48] that Daniel which is of the children of
[1:21:52] the Captivity of Judah regardless not
[1:21:55] Theo King nor all heard these words
[1:21:59] was so displeased with himself and set
[1:22:02] his heart on Daniel to deliver him and
[1:22:05] he labored till the going down of the
[1:22:08] sun to deliver him now
[1:22:10] Daniel had favored with this King and
[1:22:13] they knew that
[1:22:14] in verse 15
[1:22:16] it says uh
[1:22:18] I'm sorry not uh yeah verse verse 16.
[1:22:22] it says then
[1:22:26] verse 15 or see
[1:22:30] 15 okay it says then these men assembled
[1:22:34] unto the king and said unto the king no
[1:22:37] O King that the Lord the law of the
[1:22:39] medes and the Persians is that no decree
[1:22:42] no statute
[1:22:44] uh which the thus the king established
[1:22:47] may not be changed
[1:22:48] then the king commanded and they brought
[1:22:52] Daniel and cast him into the Den of
[1:22:54] Lions
[1:22:55] and now the king spake and said unto
[1:22:57] Daniel thy God whom thou service
[1:23:00] continually he will deliver thee
[1:23:04] and I like this because see the king had
[1:23:06] spoke how to decree that he already
[1:23:09] signed and sealed
[1:23:11] but now this this King decided that he
[1:23:14] was going to speak something over
[1:23:16] Daniel's life
[1:23:17] that that whom their service continually
[1:23:21] he will deliver thee you see and he
[1:23:25] spoke the word and God honored what he
[1:23:28] spoke
[1:23:29] you see
[1:23:30] now I believe that when you are going
[1:23:32] through something where you know you've
[1:23:34] been faithful faithful to what God has
[1:23:37] called you to be
[1:23:39] speak the word
[1:23:40] and when you speak the word it will
[1:23:44] allow other people to speak the word you
[1:23:46] see
[1:23:48] because of God's because of Daniel's
[1:23:50] faithfulness it created strength it
[1:23:53] created encouragement it created faith
[1:23:55] in someone that was not even a believer
[1:23:58] so who you can who can you convert by
[1:24:01] your faithfulness to God
[1:24:07] now the power of the king is greater
[1:24:10] than any ceiling of a king
[1:24:12] any ceiling of a king
[1:24:19] now I want to read this at the time is
[1:24:21] at hand
[1:24:23] the prophet says in paragraph 20
[1:24:26] says there come a time where the Hebrew
[1:24:28] children had to make a stand
[1:24:30] whether they were going to bow down to a
[1:24:32] heathen image or whether they were going
[1:24:35] to keep their faith in the true and
[1:24:37] living God
[1:24:39] but Tom came when the decision must be
[1:24:41] made
[1:24:42] and they made the right decision and God
[1:24:45] was with them
[1:24:47] the time came with a Prophet Daniel had
[1:24:49] to make a decision of whether he would
[1:24:51] fail to pray he would keep the tradition
[1:24:54] of religion of that country or whether
[1:24:56] he would go to his regular custom where
[1:24:59] he had fellowship with God raise up the
[1:25:01] windows and pray towards the Temple
[1:25:04] Daily and Daniel had to make his
[1:25:06] decision
[1:25:07] and the time finally forced him to to a
[1:25:11] place where he had to make it God when
[1:25:14] he speaks anything he forces it to the
[1:25:17] place and Daniel had to make a decision
[1:25:19] and when he went straight to the place
[1:25:21] of his worship and raised up the windows
[1:25:24] and worshiped God God protected his
[1:25:27] Prophet God will always do it
[1:25:31] do you believe that this evening
[1:25:33] see God will always protect his
[1:25:36] Believers his children
[1:25:38] when they are faithful to him
[1:25:40] faithful to his word
[1:25:41] because God is faithful to his own word
[1:25:45] now
[1:25:46] I want to read this
[1:25:50] I want to read this quote here
[1:25:57] uh let's see
[1:26:03] now we'll continue I don't think I'm
[1:26:04] gonna find it here but I'm gonna Echo
[1:26:07] what the prophet said uh we'll move
[1:26:09] forward you know he says there is a time
[1:26:13] where there's a separating line
[1:26:15] and
[1:26:18] you have to it's a dangerous time he
[1:26:21] said if you wait to the last minute to
[1:26:23] make a decision
[1:26:25] because the reason is so dangerous
[1:26:28] because you can think you've come out of
[1:26:30] something but you're still holding on to
[1:26:31] the things that you just refuse to to
[1:26:34] leave behind
[1:26:36] so he says it's a dangerous thing to
[1:26:37] wait to the last minute so I encourage
[1:26:40] you young people it's later than you
[1:26:43] think
[1:26:44] because it's letting you think you have
[1:26:46] to get to a place where you mean
[1:26:48] business where you serious enough to
[1:26:51] realize that the choices that I make
[1:26:53] Hereafter are going to reflect God
[1:26:56] and we'll go ahead and uh see another
[1:27:01] King
[1:27:02] the king
[1:27:04] that had to come to an hour of decision
[1:27:09] now
[1:27:10] in the message conferences
[1:27:13] the prophet says Jesus was brought
[1:27:15] himself to a decision
[1:27:18] and before going to Calvary
[1:27:20] the father brought his own son into
[1:27:23] conference in Gethsemane while his
[1:27:25] angels taking their positions to see
[1:27:27] what the decision would be
[1:27:29] oh it might not have been this way but
[1:27:33] let's think maybe it was
[1:27:34] I can hear him say son do you desire to
[1:27:38] go on to Calvary there's a band waiting
[1:27:41] for you there's persecution there's
[1:27:43] death murder laying in the way there's
[1:27:47] exposure of your own body they'll
[1:27:49] they'll strip the clove off of you
[1:27:51] you'll be beat into Pope they'll put a
[1:27:54] crown of thorns over your head and
[1:27:56] you'll die screaming for Mercy should
[1:27:59] you go on
[1:28:00] look at the decision and sometimes when
[1:28:03] we sitting in our seats and the Holy
[1:28:06] Spirit says You must do this or you must
[1:28:08] do that you got someone you won't speak
[1:28:11] to you won't speak to them you won't
[1:28:13] make it right
[1:28:15] and you're just ashamed to go up and say
[1:28:17] if you are in the wrong or what if
[1:28:20] you're not in the wrong to go up and say
[1:28:22] brother let's forget it and talk it over
[1:28:24] Jesus when he looked up in the face of
[1:28:27] the father he said it's not my will
[1:28:29] yours to be done what a decision
[1:28:32] that decision anchored and swept the
[1:28:35] world and still comes tonight to every
[1:28:37] penitent Soul not my will but thine be
[1:28:40] done
[1:28:42] since there was a decision also made a
[1:28:44] Pentecostal decision
[1:28:46] 120 went up to the upper room and they
[1:28:49] were waiting because their leader the
[1:28:51] Lord had ascended up into heaven to the
[1:28:54] father
[1:28:55] and he had told them he said now you
[1:28:57] wait up until the city of Jerusalem now
[1:29:01] I don't want you to go out preaching it
[1:29:03] I don't want you to have any schooling
[1:29:04] you don't need any more theology but I
[1:29:07] want you to go up there and just wait
[1:29:09] till you get in one Accord then I can
[1:29:12] send you the decision of Heaven back to
[1:29:14] you
[1:29:15] you see so wherever you are today young
[1:29:18] people
[1:29:19] I encourage you that if you're seeking
[1:29:22] after the baptism of the Holy Ghost wait
[1:29:25] until you get it and don't stop seeking
[1:29:27] after it and if you've gotten baptism of
[1:29:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:31] seek for refilling
[1:29:33] a refilling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:37] I I believe that the the the Holy Ghost
[1:29:40] is as powerful today as it was in the
[1:29:43] days of Pentecost
[1:29:46] so in the middle of your weakness the
[1:29:49] power of the Holy Ghost will prevail in
[1:29:51] your life
[1:29:53] now
[1:29:55] in closing this
[1:29:59] a scripture I came across
[1:30:01] and I will call this the king's decree
[1:30:05] we saw
[1:30:07] David's decree over his life
[1:30:11] we saw
[1:30:12] King uh Darius decree
[1:30:16] now we will see the king's decree
[1:30:20] we'll go into Deuteronomy chapter 30
[1:30:22] verse 14.
[1:30:28] now when the king speaks
[1:30:30] every word must come to pass
[1:30:34] but the word of God the Bible says it
[1:30:38] must fall under the ground so that it
[1:30:39] can bring forth a hundred hundred fold
[1:30:42] at verse 14 it says but the word is very
[1:30:45] nigh unto thee
[1:30:47] in thy mouth and in thy heart thou
[1:30:51] mayest do it
[1:30:53] means that the word is close to you the
[1:30:56] word is at your
[1:30:57] at your at your availability you have
[1:31:00] this word
[1:31:01] verse 15 it says see I have set before
[1:31:04] this day life and good and death and
[1:31:08] Evil
[1:31:09] and that I command thee this day to love
[1:31:12] the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and
[1:31:15] to keep his Commandments and his
[1:31:17] statutes and his judgments that thou
[1:31:19] mayest live and multiply and the Lord
[1:31:22] thy God shall bless thee in the land
[1:31:25] with thou goal is to possess it
[1:31:28] but if that heart turned away so that
[1:31:31] thou will not hear but shall be drawn
[1:31:33] away in worship of the Gods and serve
[1:31:35] them I denounce unto you this day that
[1:31:39] ye shall surely perish and that ye shall
[1:31:41] not prolong your days upon the land
[1:31:43] whether thou passeth over Jordan to go
[1:31:45] to possession verse 19
[1:31:48] I call Heaven and Earth to record this
[1:31:52] day against you that I have set before
[1:31:55] you life and death blessing and cursing
[1:32:00] therefore choose life
[1:32:02] that both you and thy seed may live
[1:32:06] there's the decree
[1:32:09] in your seed I have set before you life
[1:32:13] and death blessing and cursing therefore
[1:32:17] choose life that thou mayest and thy
[1:32:20] seed may live
[1:32:21] so you see you have this choice to make
[1:32:24] and here God is being being very plain
[1:32:28] he's saying to choose life
[1:32:31] right because if you choose life you'll
[1:32:34] live
[1:32:35] and I like to say
[1:32:37] the way to have an absolute is by a
[1:32:40] choosing
[1:32:41] and when you make the choice to choose
[1:32:43] life always choose life always choose
[1:32:47] Christ
[1:32:48] right now
[1:32:52] I'm gonna just share a testimony
[1:32:55] I had a few scriptures lined up here
[1:32:58] but I have a testimony I'd like to share
[1:33:02] as we read the many decisions that were
[1:33:04] made the good decisions and the bad
[1:33:08] decisions the wrong choices and the
[1:33:09] choices that led to corruption
[1:33:12] now as I came across this thought
[1:33:15] I remembered that some years ago
[1:33:20] there was a sermon preached
[1:33:22] that I didn't really take much heed to I
[1:33:25] not he but I didn't think too much of it
[1:33:28] at the time
[1:33:29] but when I thought about this thought
[1:33:31] and I went back
[1:33:32] I realized how prophetic
[1:33:35] and how life-changing that sermon was
[1:33:39] so I wish to read
[1:33:41] a quote here from the message make the
[1:33:45] right choice by Pastor Jack Duff
[1:33:47] in 2018 May 6.
[1:33:51] our Pastor said make the right choice
[1:33:55] you have the chance to make a choice but
[1:33:58] we're talking about making the right
[1:33:59] choice
[1:34:00] there are certain things that happen in
[1:34:02] life it says when parents bring us to
[1:34:05] church that is good that's good things
[1:34:07] for the parents to bring you to church
[1:34:09] but the purpose of bringing you to
[1:34:11] church
[1:34:12] into the church is to put you in an
[1:34:14] atmosphere that God can actually speak
[1:34:16] to you and you can begin to have your
[1:34:18] own personal relationship with the Lord
[1:34:20] Jesus Christ
[1:34:23] and when I remembered our pastor priest
[1:34:25] that in 2018
[1:34:27] in uh May 6 I I remember that it was a
[1:34:31] few months later I had to I was in a
[1:34:34] Crossroads I had to make a decision
[1:34:36] I had lost my job around that time it
[1:34:40] was actually around April I lost my job
[1:34:43] and
[1:34:44] it was a promising job that I had I had
[1:34:47] many I had a lot of potential there
[1:34:49] and it came a time where I reconsidered
[1:34:53] what I really wanted to do with my life
[1:34:55] and the decision that I had to make was
[1:34:57] whether or not I was going to go to the
[1:34:59] military
[1:35:00] and go into the army or if I was going
[1:35:03] to stay home and become a barber
[1:35:07] now remember it was too much later
[1:35:10] I went to Israel
[1:35:12] and that was a trip of a lifetime for me
[1:35:17] but as I was seeking the Lord for
[1:35:19] Direction
[1:35:20] trying to make the right choices there
[1:35:23] are certain things God laid in my path
[1:35:24] one of the things that I saw while I was
[1:35:26] in Israel is I saw a barber shop with my
[1:35:30] last name on it
[1:35:32] and I immediately told that to my pastor
[1:35:36] and some of the other brothers I was
[1:35:37] like you know I think
[1:35:39] God is speaking to me
[1:35:40] when I came back
[1:35:43] to the meetings we had the July meetings
[1:35:45] at brother West Coast
[1:35:46] and another brother came up to me and
[1:35:48] says hey are you a barber
[1:35:50] and I never told that brother anything
[1:35:52] that was the second confirmation
[1:35:55] and then
[1:35:56] it was towards the end of the meetings a
[1:35:58] brother preached on Moses how Moses
[1:36:02] knowing what was on the other side
[1:36:05] refuse the riches and the pleasures and
[1:36:09] he chose the heart away
[1:36:11] and you see when going to the military I
[1:36:13] knew what was before me I knew the
[1:36:15] opportunities that I would have had
[1:36:17] I didn't know what was going to happen
[1:36:19] if I became a barber
[1:36:21] so there was no doubt the hard way so I
[1:36:23] said you know that was that's the third
[1:36:24] confirmation I'm choosing the hard way
[1:36:27] and church that same year
[1:36:30] because I made that choice as God led me
[1:36:34] I I so many things happened
[1:36:37] you see so
[1:36:39] I encourage you that as you hear God
[1:36:42] speak to you choose life
[1:36:45] because God was speaking through my
[1:36:47] pastor then
[1:36:49] and it unfolded a few months
[1:36:52] and then I'm going I'm going and five
[1:36:55] years later I am where I am today
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:06] I wish to read this scripture in closing
[1:37:10] verse 16.
[1:37:12] it says verse 2 chapter 16 Proverbs 16
[1:37:15] verse 2. it says all the ways of man are
[1:37:19] clean in his own eyes
[1:37:21] but the Lord weighed the spirit
[1:37:25] so you might think you're just accepting
[1:37:27] a job offer you might think you're just
[1:37:29] making a new friend
[1:37:31] but remember the Lord weighed the spirit
[1:37:34] and in verse 3 says commit The Works
[1:37:36] unto the Lord thy works and thy thoughts
[1:37:39] shall be established
[1:37:42] and
[1:37:45] the prophet says in this message here
[1:37:48] spiritual amnesia
[1:37:50] in paragraph 89.
[1:37:54] he says notice
[1:37:56] and he is in me
[1:37:58] and I am in him
[1:38:01] every Christian that has a real genuine
[1:38:03] Christian experience when the morning
[1:38:06] Stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:38:09] shouted for Joy before there was a
[1:38:11] foundation of the world we were
[1:38:13] identified in the Mortal Realms with God
[1:38:17] 10 million years before the world was
[1:38:21] ever formed I was back there with him if
[1:38:25] I got eternal life I was there with him
[1:38:28] I was identified with him when the
[1:38:31] morning Stars sang together in the sons
[1:38:33] of God shouted for Joy now you might be
[1:38:36] asking yourself you know I've tried to
[1:38:38] make the right choice but I just can't
[1:38:40] seem to make it I'm still here
[1:38:43] but I'm I'm struggling with making the
[1:38:46] right choices
[1:38:47] well I'm going to declare tonight that
[1:38:49] you will make the right choice
[1:38:51] because you were identified with him
[1:38:54] you see Rahab had something that she
[1:38:57] that was identified in her where she
[1:39:00] could receive the spies into her home
[1:39:02] and because she made the right choice to
[1:39:05] receive the spies her opportunity was
[1:39:08] created for her so that she can receive
[1:39:10] life so that she can receive an escape
[1:39:13] so I encourage you young people tonight
[1:39:15] love God and as you love him love him
[1:39:19] with all your heart love him with all
[1:39:22] your soul and love him with all your
[1:39:25] mind
