shout out if i could play the i played a piano for jesus man whatever i can do for the lord i want to do for the lord he just he just been been too good man two goods sometimes you want to say lord that's just too good amen i was just thinking this morning just you know um i believe brother simba was uh sometime last year it testified and he was just looking for god in the details and he found god in a detail i think it was ephesians 3 20 and he typed his address you know some kind of way to to the scripture and when he read the scriptures uh said that the lord would do the exceeding the abundant above all we could ask a thing now if if we go back to that service amen and just think about what brother simba was telling us and we look at right now where you at do you know god has done the exceeding the abundance above all you could ask or think you know god did it and could nobody do it but god he has provided he has done all kinds of things blessed with promotions gave new jobs and hallelujah amen hey man people getting jobs that they didn't even apply for y'all don't even know what i'm talking about and i'm supposed to just come here and just sit and look at come on like they say that old song you hold my oh jesus jesus my god my god hallelujah let me try to move on to where i'm trying to go here because i'm i might get in concert mode on y'all yeah amen seem like i've been out of church forever [Music] y'all can't tell me streaming the same as being in the house regardless i i've been there on the other side of it i appreciate it but lord ain't nothing like coming to the house of the lord good god almighty just enjoy being here amen amen see that's another one i'm i'm not going to go there though um that's that's another good one but i i i need to i need to move on amen let me give y'all a quick update amen of um just our um i i missed this a few weeks ago because i had to go in quarantine uh but by the grace of god we made it back uh from indiana with no issue even though we were exposed to someone that had the virus they're doing a lot better there a man there's roughly i want to say 14 15 people that end up contracting the virus there but you know we only kind of came in contact with one and uh by god's grace he kept us and he watched over us and and uh and and i don't i don't want to brag or anything like that i just want to give thanks to the lord for just keeping us and everything and i want to encourage us as a church i'm gonna tell y'all one thing that i see that happened here that i don't see in a lot of the places y'all actually wear your masks in church a lot of other people don't do it and uh and when and a lot of the testimonies that are here sweeping through is that and i mean people got all kind of theories about the mass look i i'm not here to dispute with all these theories here's what i know coronavirus is here people dying people getting sick that's what i know right and uh and and so i'm not here to debate with all the theories and all that but i will encourage y'all keep doing what you're doing uh by god's grace we haven't had one incident to report and uh and i'm grateful for that i'm grateful so i was talking to somebody just yesterday so you know really when you think about it you know when you're going through something like this whether it's man-made or a pandemic or pandemic whatever it is uh you know uh as we're going through this we need wisdom because um only god can keep us at a time like this and and what i what i'm what i'm grateful for is that god has been keeping us and um you know and i want to encourage y'all keep doing what you're doing you know let's let's not give the devil no room for nothing around here so uh just keep doing what you're doing you know and and i do want to encourage as we're coming in and out of the church please make sure you have your mass as you're standing outside talking to people use your mask use your mask use your mask ain't nothing wrong with it as i was saying yesterday this guy he was telling me say you know this is a very small thing they're asking us to do wear masks that's that's it it ain't really like it's all that right i think we make more of it than it need to be and i'm gonna tell you something i don't believe we're gonna be like this always i don't believe it's gonna be like that always but it's just we here now so let's just do what we need to do and and i'm gonna tell you i was i was glad that the saints that went with us they they they were they mess they warm and and uh and they come back home [Music] [Applause] man they come back home and i mean that's what matters most to me so i'ma tell you something i don't want to see not one of y'all get sick so do everything you can you know just to abide by what has been acts of until this thing passes and i believe this too shall pass amen amen i want to just give a quick update on our building fund uh since i didn't do that at the beginning of the month um just um making mention here that last month we um that that helped them but hurt me uh that that's fine let me see here so um our goal was a 105 000 a year that we would raise pledge to that goal was sixty thousand nine dollars was pledged uh as of last month the first this month i should say we have received uh based on the pledges we've received year to date twenty two thousand six hundred and fifty three dollars nine a man that's been received towards that pledge goal of 60 000. uh uh we also received interest of 279.14 which gives us a net of 22 932.23 that has been received amen here in 2020 towards our building fund drive and i want to give god praise for these positive numbers amen we had a goal and and uh and i just want to say thank you to each and every one thank you brother uh thank you to each and every one that's helping us amen just reach our goal uh i um i i just believe god got something in store for us and uh and i'm on the expectation for uh his uh blessings and uh i'm just looking forward to what god can do we we we thank god for providing this place and letting us rent but we want to own we we prefer to own so and that's what we're striving towards and amen and and at the end of this year we will have completed our three-year pledge of drive i mean a three-year drive and uh and we're going to see what god got what doors god going to open up amen but i want to say thank you to each and every one that has helped us amen along the way i also want to say um okay you can leave well i guess i'll do that um birthdays that are coming up sister cashnetta uh be having a birthday on tuesday the 22nd so we say happy birthday to sister questionetta amen and thank the lord for giving her another year and man then we have a double a birthday amen in our family my wife will be celebrating her birthday and my niece sister rachel celebrating their birthday on the 24th uh which is thursday so we thank god for giving over them amen another year as well so we just just appreciate the lord also don't forget we'll continue to do our services wednesday and sunday our two services they will all be streamed amen on wednesday and sunday we can you can do the streaming uh but we do we have open the house of the lord for the saints to be able to come into the house of lord if you desire to amen wednesdays and sundays um also just as far as our giving amen you do have the ability to give multiple ways if you wanted to mail your giving in and put an envelope and melody and that is on the bottom of the screen there the address to the church uh if you wanted to give through paypal we ask that you choose the option give to a friend or family member and always use the email address of giving at john423.org and if you want to use cash app a man our i guess our handle in uh in cash app would be uh the dollar sign spirit and truth t so if you desire to give that way uh we do we are accepting giving that way so let's pray over our giving amen at this time and will go forward father we thank you for the privilege and opportunity we have to give thank you for every need that has been met in this church thank you for the building fund that continues to grow uh lord we just appreciate your mighty hand at work not only in the ministry here but also in the lives of the people we we thank you for doing the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask or think we pray your blessings upon your people as they give may you restore back to each and every one a hundredfold and uh god we just actually use this for the furthest of your kingdom here on earth in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord thank you musicians i appreciate you all uh thank y'all so much amen i just want to also say uh thank you to uh brother troy amen uh brother kwaku brother jerry amen for uh all of them just praise the lord just stepping in and stepping up and uh i mean i was there at just just streaming the services and just looking at them and i'm like wow you know this is this is really something and i and i'm gonna tell y'all just a little thought that i had y'all probably gonna rebuke me for this thought but i'm gonna just tell it to you anyway amen um i was just looking amen at how ministry has been conducted uh brother solomon i'd certainly appreciate you too brother as well your faithfulness uh every sunday every sunday and and you know you get a chance sometimes to look at other other churches and when you do look at other services uh sometimes you it's good to do that because sometimes we take for granted what we have here right and uh so brother solomon i want to say thank you for your faithfulness and just just coming sunday after sunday just giving of yourself and and uh you know but as i was just sitting there looking at the services just a thought crossed my my mind and i said lord if you were to call me home uh you have given me a glimpse of what spirit and truth would be if i wasn't around and uh and and for me that um says that we have accomplished that replication thing that we were talking about years ago uh the church should not be built on brother jack but the church should be built on the lord jesus christ and and i just i just i just saw a glimpse of that i was just at home and streaming i'm like wow you know the church is functioning and functioning well and i say lord i thank you for that i really do i thank you for that so uh uh thank you church everybody just doing their part you know it just it just means so much every special means something right uh the song a song leader means something the musicians mean something every ministry even you sitting and saying amen to the word means something right so uh i just i just appreciate you all and because spirit and truth is not me but spirit and truth is all of us together amen and i thank god i thank god i i i i'm happy to be worshiping in spirit and in truth amen amen praise the lord so god bless you uh so good to see a man uh everybody in the house of the lord on today um um early sister janice is that right okay we can't call you visit anymore amen it's so good to have you amen in the house lord again [Applause] amen and um uh sister niece amen good to see one of the daughters of the house amen in the house amen and speaking of that i i heard from uh ariel ariel told me to tell the church that he sent his greetings and i say well praise the lord god bless you so uh he's a wonderful brother and and we just thank god for him he just let me know he made it back home safely had a a long schedule after he left here and went to a number of places but he said i made it back safely and just wanted to send my greetings back to the church so uh we certainly thank god for them amen so i will um just try to take us a thought here today and we are um going back and picking up our series uh we have been we started the year off with step into the vision and um and i i was just saying the the greatest vision that we could all enter into is this vision that god gave the prophet and actually was more the vision was a direct word from an angel that he told the prophet pick up your pen and write and he said these things that i'm guarantee this is for the church right this is for the bride for the church and so brother branham picked up his pen and he began to write these things and he penned it and uh and i just been taking pretty much paragraph by paragraph and just trying to bring that uh bring us into a place where we can see where we are and uh and i trust that the lord will just kind of help us uh on today amen uh with this uh i'm gonna read a a a a scripture a soul and and um i just pray the lord to help us amen with uh with our journey here today i um i feel that i wanna share something here before i get started in this thought amen and you all bear with me as i just take a little extra time this morning i haven't been with you for a few weeks so just just just give me a little grace amen um earlier this year we had a brother come to visit us a man from south america his his name was um brother carlos uh he and his wife were here and i think they had a little boy and brother carlos would come up and sing sometimes for us and he's sitting in the back he couldn't unders i mean really speak too much english so brother josue would have to interpret for him um you know and and um so you know they were doing that and but brother carlos really just enjoyed you know the fellowship here while he was here went back home to south america and uh was there for a few months and then the lord gave him a dream and um and he called brother kwaku and he said brother i had this dream about the church and i didn't i didn't know what what what to say he said i was i was it says i was kind of like at the church and it says um i was given a guitar uh but as i was giving the guitar to play the song that they were singing it says i could not catch the rhythm of the song that they were singing i couldn't catch the rhythm and um and it says it says i didn't understand but i i tried but i just could not catch the rhythm and it says and and after uh i i you know i sat down and you know with uh with you know from from with the guitar set down he says uh the pastor's mother went to the piano and she began to play he says brother i don't know what this mean but this is dream that i had it at the church so we said okay well we'll just take it and we'll just pray over it and just leave it before the lord and um we were watching and uh god just began to do some things and and i told this to a particular family it's nothing that i mean i'm i i share it with but i shared this with a couple brothers and watch god had sent a family a man here to the church and uh right during the midst of this pandemic and god sent a a a family here to the church um and they were hispanic family a man and and as they came and we were just really fellowshipping and and uh and everything and and um and and and it just so happened that every service that the family come i was never preaching i was never preaching and they were coming for months and i wouldn't we had these alternate services and i always preached the alternate service and the very sunday that they came and i preached lord gave me a a sermon that just it sometime imma just tell all everybody sometimes you're going to get a sermon here that's going to cause you to put you bring your toes in you understand that that's what you know truth is going for right when when when you when you when when god is coming um if i could just use the word actually correcting you because the bible tells us that who the lord loves he actually corrects that's what the bible tells us right so you know i had to bring this sermon it was really really rough that day really hard you know i had to talk about some things that most churches don't talk about right but but i used the bible i wasn't just saying it just of my own accord but i used the bible to bring this forward and and i had a wonderful fellowship with the family afterward and i told them about this dream and and what the dream says that brother brother carlos representing hispanic uh community right brother carlos is in the dream and he says i couldn't catch the rhythm and i say what it is is that they couldn't catch the rhythm of the word you understand couldn't catch the rhythm of the word and say but sister birds don't play piano so about why sister birds in the dream if she don't play piano well if you notice after um after you know some things settled down then sister blanca came through sister burst with sister tabitha spiritual things are happening right spiritual things are happening and but and i'm i'm just telling you all this because just the birds just kind of shared me just a wonderful wonderful fellowship that she's had with sister blanc and sister tabitha and also um sister shanika who who who you all have not seen yet shanika does watch online and they've all worked together they were praying together they would you know just doing a lot of things together and since birds had a chance just to share her personal testimony as to how she came to this word and uh so sister shanika uh who who you all haven't seen sister shanika and sister blank and sister birds were all praying together and just sharing the word together and sister blanca say i'm go visit she's been coming ever since so she's not a visitor no more amen uh her and tabitha not visitors anymore you know uh but uh uh they're just part of the family amen just like sister janice just part of the family that's the way we we look at it amen but you haven't seen sister shanika yet but sister shanika is a piano player so let's pray right let's pray and um let's just uh even even you know the family that i don't just because they didn't catch the rhythm they tried and i'm gonna keep praying till they come back right but it's all spiritual oh everything that god don't do stuff just just to be doing stuff there's there's things happening here right and god would give a man in i believe honduras is where he's from a given man in honduras a dream about our church i know it's the hand of the lord i want to handle the lord so regardless of what i hear what i see i say the devil's a liar and god is at work amen god is at work so you know as i you know i i uh um as we go into things you know uh god has given us a man a message that we're preaching and um you know god sent us a prophet and we we pull from that prophet we pull inspiration amen and and not just inspiration but even how is he actually presenting scripture to us so that we can understand what the scriptures say because you can you can you can pick up your bible and and every there's so many different uh manufacturers of bibles and each manufacturer has their own set of theologians that they are behind and the theologians have different thoughts on the scriptures so sometimes you can pick up uh this bible even though it's a kjv and you pick up another vibe it's kjv they got different references it's because the different theologians got different thoughts on the different scriptures and and sometimes it's very hard to follow when you're trying to follow theologians but i tell you what if you can just ever hear a prophet you get clarity on scripture and that's just where we are we're just we're listening to a prophet and we're getting clarity from there so so i don't want you to be a man alarmed we're not some strange group of people uh we're just we're christians we love the lord we believe the bible from genesis to revelation amen we're not we're not we're not one of those churches that that don't even preach the old testament anymore because they say that's old testament well thou should not kill is in old testament i i still believe that thou should not commit adultery is in the old testament i still believe that amen so if god wrote it he wasn't just writing it for one time he was writing it for all times and every generation can actually get something out of the word so i mean if you if you start taking things out of the word of god then you just get a real messed up picture right so we want to keep it all together just believe it from genesis to revelation and like one person said from cover to cover amen stand with me as we read the word of the lord on today amen i want to read from the book of judges chapter 16 and i also want to read from matthew chapter 24. praise the lord judges chapter 16 amen in matthew chapter 24 amen amen amen uh judges chapter 16 uh very familiar passage uh that you you have many of you have read but i pray that we would make it applicable to today amen it applies both naturally and spiritually judges chapter 16 verse 15 says and she said unto him how can thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has not told me wherein thy great strength lieth and those of you that are bible readers you know this is a story of samson and delilah that we're reading we're just kind of picking up the the ending part of the story since it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death she just kept talking kept talking and i mean he just couldn't do nothing first of all he's some he wasn't supposed to be with her when he put himself in a in a bad position amen and and some of us uh and let me just put it this way brothers and sisters everybody got a delilah in their life and you need to put yourself in a position where delilah ain't getting ready to destroy you praise the lord amen amen some conversations you need to stop having all right amen some people you need to just stop hanging with all right glory to god uh verse 17 that he told her all his heart and said unto her there have not come a raise upon my head so i have been i have been a nazarite unto god from my mother's womb now all of his guards are dropped all right i i i was a christian i was i used to be nine i ain't that no more because you kept hanging around the wrong places man he told her all all his harp and said in her there have not come a raise upon my head for i have been an azerite unto god from my mother's womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man that gave up the secret and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he have showed me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came up under her philistines uh uh came under her and brought money in their hand my god wow he thought it was all about love this lady was getting paid and you think it's all about love hey man somebody getting ready to reap some benefits and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she calls him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him that i think that's something she if she afflicted him right she began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the lord was departed from him hallelujah but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and bound him with fetters of brass and he did ground in the prison house how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaving all right let's uh turn to matthew 24. brother troy actually was reading from matthew 24 on last week and and i was enjoying how he was saying as jesus was giving them these three um they were they asked him three questions he was given the answers and matthew 24 just kind of goes through what those answers are um the disciples went to him privately and began to ask questions to get a better understanding as to what he was saying and and i think that's key um don't just go to the internet to try to get answers but but but but but go to god's representative right i mean if anybody have questions on anything we preach uh please you know i'm i'm available i i mean if you want to sit down and have dinner i'll pay for it you can ask as many questions as you want i want to help people right so uh but we just just privately it's just how you get answers to things you know so if there's anything that's preached from this pulpit that you don't understand please know that we are available i'm not i i'm not one of them pastors that you know i leave here and can't be touched amen praise the lord some churches you can't talk to the pastor you got to get an appointment and all kind of stuff and amen and then they have another pastor that don't even preach to you they make him talk to you praise the lord all right but uh that's that's not this kind of church amen everybody here got access to me amen everybody got access to me amen and sometimes i might not be able to take the call right then but i don't think there's not one person i ain't got back to amen praise the lord and if i have to drive to you i'll drive to you amen all right he came back yo matthew 24 24 is where i want to read for there shall arise jesus is telling us to be careful here so there shall arise false christ that means false anointed people false people amen but notice the christ capital christ oh lord happen this is what i want you to understand is that they are anointed by the genuine holy ghost you know rain falls on both the just and the unjust so i don't want you to get confused when you see rain falling unadjusted unjust and what about them they got this they got no no no no no we we're going to get to all that amen but i want to understand according to scripture that the anointing amen is supposed to be on false christs false anointed ones right for there shall arise false christs and false prophets now wait let's stop there because people will always kind of let me let me just read uh for that show uh additional rhymes false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall receive the very lake let's pray let's pray father i just thank you for your word i thank you for what you've spoken to us i trust that the holy spirit will help us to understand what it is that the spirit is speaking god that we could apply for right now that we wouldn't miss oh god what you're saying i pray that every ear that is hearing the word of god that god they would draw closer to you through revelation and understanding he told us and all i get and get understanding so lord speak to us amen this morning so in jesus name we ask it amen amen praise the lord the scripture we'll just read it again there matthew 24 24. the scripture has been something that i have a man rested on it's a scripture that uh that brings me comfort it's a scripture that um that i can tie myself to and realize that ain't nothing gonna happen to me praise the lord amen and and and i wanna i wanna give this to you know those that are watching us online those that are new to the ministry amen this is a scripture i want you to tie yourself down to i mean absolutely tie yourself i mean there's things that that you'll hear at this church that you want here at other places amen and and that's fine that's fine you know there's a reason for all of that and and i wasn't born into this i come from a baptist background and also a little pentecostal background i had all of that in my background amen but uh but then one day god brought me to the truth god brought me to the word and and i began to understand some things you know it wasn't just about a a preacher grabbing his ear and making a shout because he could sing a little bit amen it wasn't about somebody just running around the church and just you know uh speaking in tongues and and and one living right come on somebody we know that's the truth i mean you're speaking in tongues but you ain't living right amen so something wrong with this and it was a genuine holy ghost that was on the people but you know we got we got to come to a spot where i want i want i want i want the spirit but i also want truth too i want them both amen so you know when we look at this scripture amen verse 24 matthew 24 24 this is something i want you to tie yourself to for there shall arise false christ that means false anointed ones will be on the scene amen right before jesus comes the second time hallelujah false christ will arise and notice what else he says and false prophets hallelujah i need for you to understand that yes there will be false prophets but in order to have something false or to have something fake then you must have at least one thing that's real praise god if you go amen make some fake dollars you got to make the fake dollar from a real dollar glory to god so amen often times what the devil wants to do is point out false false false but what i'm looking for is where's the real thing oh hallelujah and i'm here to tell you coke ain't it coke ain't the real thing but jesus christ is the real thing hallelujah and and the way that you got to know him is through his word all right look at this amen the bible tells us for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders there's going to be tremendous manifestations in their life but i love this part this is what i've rest my my soul on this is what i got confidence in amen it says in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and what i found out a man that assets i am elect that's my testimony i don't know about yours since i am elect i cannot be deceived and and you have to have the same confidence in the word of god for yourself you ought to say since i am elect i cannot be deceived y'all want to say that with me say it like that since i am elect i cannot be deceived so the title of the sermon is impossible deception impossible deception let me just start with this amen out of the revelation of jesus christ this little thought here coming out of the church age book um god's prophet makes a statement says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation hallelujah glory to god amen christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that and how that the antichrist spirit oh my would come into the church amen and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless oh my my my my see brother troy started working with that he read the scripture out of revelation 12 how the devil had come down out of heaven now he had a purpose and i'm going to try to read to you amen what his purpose was but he come down out of heaven and i want to tell you what began as angel warfare has now come into the earth and you are part of the war this is why the brother was saying wars and rumors of what we all looking at amen this nation and that nation but as he said you are a holy nation and the devil's coming after you oh hallelujah yo you yeah and you got to reload your weapon with what with the word of god you must understand your position with the word of god hallelujah brother i know where i stand ain't no sense no devil coming to me and and i i i i'm standing on i can't be deceived impossible for me to be deceived amen i know this says something i never heard before but i can't be deceived praise the lord amen if there was anything deceptive about this message i believe god would take me out of it if it was deceptive because i'm elect and i can't be deceived hallelujah but i'm not i wouldn't leave based on feelings and emotions and i'm gonna tell you why i believe the message the way i believe it because i can see things in scripture all right let me go on let me go on glory glory glory it says the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word so the way the devil tries to destroy is by trying to discredit the word of god hallelujah when you see somebody coming against something god wrote i didn't put that there god put that there when jesus himself said that elias has come he said they said i sent you elias has come amen and they've done to him whatever they they were supposed to do he said but i also say eli shall come and restore all things jesus spoke of this ministry coming jesus himself so now we got to find out what it what is this what does this mean it's prophecy from jesus himself don't let the word of god be discredited he says right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church hallelujah and what she is because see there's a true church and there's a false church but you got to get a revelation of the true church amen and what she is what she stands for amen for for and that she can do the greater works amen she will be an invincible army can't be defeated army amen if they get a true revelation of the and this is this is important right here if they get a true revelation of the two spirits oh hallelujah hallelujah two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand now that's the key that's that's that's critical not only do you have to get a revelation that is two spirits at work there's a spirit trying to pull you into false and there's a spirit also trying to pull you into truth hallelujah amen and you gotta be able to discern between these spirits and the only way you can discern between the spirits is you have to keep them on the word i'ma tell you something a dream ain't gonna get it come on hey man a good feeling ain't gonna get it but you're gonna have to keep you the only way you can discern them spirits is by taking them back to the word of god do you realize jesus defeated the devil with it it's written and the way you're going to defeat a devil is with it is written let me go on by god's spirit discerning withstanding antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ will send us every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now i i i'm putting this here because uh you know scripture just kind of tells us that it was impossible that the very let could be deceived impossible so we're living in an age where where folk are being deceived we're living in an age of deception now i want to just just try to give you a definition here of the word deception uh deception is an act or statement which misleads deception is an act or statement which misleads not only that deception is something that hides the truth let me just deception actually hides the truth but here i'm giving you scripture i'm not trying to hide nothing i'm trying to show something amen deception comes when somebody's trying to hide the truth we're not trying to hide anything from anybody oh hallelujah so i can tell you the spirit of deception is not at work here praise god amen amen if you're trying to discern deception here you're discerning the wrong thing we're trying to share truth not high truth look at this deceptions are act a statement which misleads deception tries to hide the truth uh uh uh just another thing i'm gonna just give you a definition deception promotes a belief or concept or an idea that is not true my god and the reason that they promote a belief a concept or idea that's not true because they're doing it for personal gain oh hallelujah all right let's keep on going i want you to understand something when he said uh discern the two spirits within the church and by god's spirit um you know you're gonna have to you gotta be able to discern it catch what what the devil's doing and and what god's doing discern those two spirits that's at work and i want you to understand something about the antichrist spirit amen brother brandon made a step and says the antichrist spirit is not the communistic spirit he says the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit religious so when we talk about discernment you have to catch it from a religious angle don't look don't look at the political angles religious religious religious religious the antichrist spirit is not the communistic spirit the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit now um as i just kind of looked at this oh my give me uh let me let me go to spoken words original seed i want to just kind of set this up before i go deeper in this this is where the angel of the lord is telling the prophet pick up his pen and write and he wrote these things out and uh and he just kind of drops dropped some things in here so i'm just kind of picking up what the what the angel was saying to us it's something that we just we're going to try to feast on here today here in this message spoken words original says spoke spoken words originally says remember moses born for the work had to wait on god for the extra gift for the job he had to go back and wait for the time appointed by god and we preached that a few weeks ago waiting for the appointed time he says a certain pharaoh had to be on the throne and the people had to be warning the bread of life before god could send him back amen oh can i let me just inject something there you know the reason that many of us are in the place that we're in today days because we got to a point in our spiritual walk where we wanted more we got to import in our spiritual where we were frustrated with what we had and the reason that you want it more it's because there was actually more [Music] come on somebody hey man you you can't long for nothing that's not dead right if if a man there was a a a a a a statement that was made amen if a man is is longing for water if a man is thirsting for water hallelujah it's a couple of things that happen either he don't have water before and he know what water can do for him amen or if he hasn't had it there's something in his body it caused him to crave for and and and if there's a deep calling out to a deep praise god there must be a deep somewhere to respond can i tell you something you don't come here by accident you don't come here by chance you come by predestination god don't make no mistakes hallelujah it's because you want it more so god has more for you and you can never exhaust god hallelujah i'm still desiring more then been holding on to this for a number of years but i'm still desiring more and there's more for me to have glory to god glory to god amen the people had to be wanting the bread of life before god could send them back it says now now with thousands of sign workers in this last day has created a generation of sign seekers that know and this is the problem they sign seekers but they know that knows no more nothing about a true move of god and his word in the last days as i said give them blood and oil and fleshly demonstrations on the platform they'll support it whether it's god's word or not listen hallelujah whether it's scriptural or not jesus have warned us of such things at the end time in matthew 24 two spirits very close to like deceived the very elect if possible but i'm telling it's impossible deception because i'm very lucky i can't be deceived i'm telling i rested when i when i just read that in the bible matthew 24 24 is something that i could just drop all my weight on god i ain't concerned god i know you love me i know you will not allow me to be intentionally deceived i know you won't do that amen because you you said that very let will not be deceived but as i look at all that scripture everybody the foster foster father well i i get it yes jesus said it's going to be false but in order for it to be false there has to be at least one truth now now point me where true true true and most of them can't point to the true true truth but they can talk about false false false but where's true true true hallelujah i said like this if this ain't that i'ma keep this until that come on y'all need to bring some pens and papers and just write things down if this ain't that i'ma keep this until that come glory to god i'm going on how can you tell them how can you how can you tell these two spirits apart how can you tell give them the word test and that's important to me that's that that that that says not your emotions test don't give it your feelings tests don't give it your dream or your vision test give it the word test hallelujah give them the word test glory how can you know it speak in the word see what they say about it just give them scriptures see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed germ in them oh i'm these are heavy quotes but it's got to be said if they can't believe the word they ain't gonna believe nothing amen hallelujah amen says uh they have no sea germ in them they are up the evil one and and deceive you if they can't receive the word they're of the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was deceived and the second bride was deceived there are deceivers of the third bride oh lord jesus i want to talk about that today the first bride was deceived amen the second bribe was deceived they are deceivers of the third bride and how do they deceive them by high breeding the word or trying to trying to hide breed a word god never placed signs ahead of his word god never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the words amen but the word is first oh hallelujah church i feel so good this morning the word has got to be first see the reason that we i i believe this prophet that god's saying is because i saw in the bible where god promised that he was going to do this amen the reason that i can believe john the baptist is who he is is because i saw in the bible where god promised it i'ma say something here show me one scripture where god promised to send paul but i believe paul but there's not one scripture in the old testament where god promised to send paul the man that wrote two-thirds of the new testament but yet i believe it god vindicated his ministry and i believe he didn't even walk with jesus he wasn't even one of the disciples of jesus but yet god used his ministry and if we got faith oh hallelujah if we got faith in somebody that god didn't even promise to sin we got faith in somebody that god didn't even promise to sin why can't we have faith in who god promised to sin according to scripture all right that god never plays signs ahead of his word right because you know it's not about the signs and wonders but god uses that to track the attention of the people right but once he has your attention then he wants to share with you his word amen praise the lord glory to god uh a a young man who and a young lady he might buy a few gifts in here but at some point time he wanted to sit down and listen to what he's trying to say amen what if he can't buy a gift you're still going to love him what what if the man lose his job hmm you're still going to love him i mean not now he can't he can't work no more and and he can't get you the things that he used to get to where what what happens to the relationship then see because if a young lady is only caught up on the gifts come on and when i talk about young lady i'm talking about the church if the church is only caught up on the gifts what about when there is no gift do you still love jesus when there is no gift in place see see the gift is just just extra hallelujah but but you got i mean a young man want to make sure that he's in a relationship and the lord jesus wants to make sure he's in a relationship with a bride with a church that'll love him in spite of gifts i came to this conclusion a long time ago if god don't do one more thing for me he's done enough for me to praise him for the rest of my days can you love him when there is no gift nothing i mean i don't see nothing i don't see this see because sometimes that's all people looking for us gifts gives gifts now don't get me wrong every gift that was promised in the bible i believe should be in the church but i don't believe everybody gonna have the same gift praise the lord even when you go buy you know gifts for your kids you get them something different you wouldn't buy if you got if you got a 14 year old and a five-year-old you're gonna buy that 14 year old something different than that five-year-old come on y'all amen i i can't give my 14 year old a gi joe oh barbie or something like that no that's not what i'm looking for i mean that 14 year old said just give me money just give me this just i mean it's a different they both getting gifts it's just a different gift and each gift is an expression of my love to each child hallelujah but i'm not gonna force the 14 year old to be a five-year-old and i'm not gonna force the five-year-old to be a fourteen-year-old but i want you to receive my love through the gifts hallelujah and and in the body of christ god is not forcing us all to be one way the way they taught it to us years ago that's not how god does things if i can't if i don't do things that way i know god is much smarter than i am look at this god never played signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first to prove it elijah said to the woman now this is before she got her miracle he said he said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen i love that statement bake me because you know this lady was in a situation let me finish reading this this says come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the holy spirit energizes now you know this this lady was looking for a miracle she needed it real bad she needed it real bad i mean they were in a famine time and um and here god sends the prophet to this lady's house and when he gets there uh to the hou god in order to say i have ordained for her to sustain you through this famine can i tell you something there's certain places that you must go oh i'm gonna say that again in certain places that you must go if you want to be sustained the prophet couldn't just go anywhere he could go to somebody else's house that you know you know they said they said go to the house where there's a lot of kids because typically there's a lot of food in a place like that that's not where god told that prophet to go he said there's a woman amen there's a woman there i mean uh no no husband at home she got one son a husband maybe passed away stuff she got one son i want you going to that widow woman's house i have ordained that the widow woman will sustain you and i want you to understand something the widow woman had nothing to sustain him with but i'm ordained for the widowed woman to sustain you and when he gets there and starts having a conversation with the widow woman he said go give me some water well you know what that's about the only thing we got around here i can get you some of that we got some water so here he goes some water for you you know i'm gonna go get that and she's on her way to go get water and he's saying also now you pushing your luck right here i mean you realize it's a famine in the land right and and and they say also if you don't mind bake me a cake first she say uh now uh i i ain't got but this much more meal and this much more of this and you know i ain't got that many agree to say and what my plan was is that i was gonna bake this for my son because he's about to die inside the house he's about to die so i'm gonna give it to him first and both of us gonna die together this was that was my plan he said he said he said he said yeah yeah i got your plan but but before you give it to your son just give me one first and then he said some famous words that every believer like hearing if you're a believer you huh you love these words right here they say they say beg me one first and thus saith the lord that changes things even god himself knew that once that lady heard those key words she would be able to sustain that prophet you bake me a cake first and i guarantee you thus saith the lord your crews will not go empty in your barrel won't run dry thus saith the lord and when she went back i i could imagine her you know some of us the way we would go back we'd go look inside and see what's in there and while you're looking like that you won't see nothing but if you just take your cup not even looking at it just put it in i guarantee when you pull it up you're gonna have something in there and that lady was sustained through that famine because she obeyed the word she saw miracles because she obeyed the word if you want to see a miracle amen you must obey the word of god jesus made a statement because they had a problem with his ministry they had a problem with his teachings they had a problem with all kind of stuff in john 5 uh 39 i won't read all of this so i'll just give you 539 um but you can and john in the book of john he just had all kind of problems with the the pharisees and sadducees and but john 5 39 jesus gave them a statement he says y'all got problems with me uh it says but search the scriptures it says for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me john 5 39 and this is what i want to tell you anytime there's a question that comes up with amen with this message i want to encourage you to do some search the scriptures hey man just don't search google hey man just don't don't stop just with google search the scriptures amen because as you search the scriptures then you'll get an answer god himself speak of certain things happening and we're watching those things unfold hallelujah glory to god let me uh let me just kind of uh give you another quick definition see in matthew 24 24 it says if it were possible they shall deceive the very lack now uh i looked i just kind of clicked on that to get the greek lexicon uh definition of that and what what what uh deceive is is to to air to go astray to seduce to wander a man to be out of the way praise the lord amen to be led astray led aside from the right way uh to roam about um they also say what deceived me is to be led away from the truth to lead into error to deceive to be led into error uh to be led aside from the path of virtue to go astray amen it's to sin it's to sever fall away from the truth of heretic uh uh heretics uh to be led away into the era and sin these are some of the definitions of of what uh deceive is and and i'm and i'm and what i'm telling you is that it's it's an impossible deception because i i guarantee there's a group of people and i believe i'm preaching to them this morning that they will not be led away into sin they will not be led away into error no matter what the devil presents to him this group of people is ordained of god never to be led away and i want to i want to i want to give you good news if you are ordained of god to never be led or astray or let away from the word of god then there's nothing the devil can do to that can upset you nothing it's because i'm ordained for this i'm called to this i was made for this i was born for this can't be led astray impossible deception that's something now i thought about just deception and scripture and and there's a number you know just a number of different incidents because this this deception is something that started way in heaven right satan started this this whole trick of deceiving and he deceived two-thirds of the angels you know and and that devil that devil that that was fruit that devil's rude i want to uh just kind of bring amen something in if i can uh very let's look at isaiah 14. this thing started way in heaven the deception amen that the devil is using glory and what you got to see is that he he brought what what was in heaven he actually brought it down to the earth and and the spears that we're fighting the battle that we're that that's raging even right now the wars and rumors of wars that brother troy was talking about just bring it from a different angle yes there'll be naturals but catch the spiritual wars right you know we got to catch these things but but but we got to see that the devil is he has an objective amen when he's deceiving a person is trying to amen have their own personal gain glory to god the devil had a personal gain by deceiving the angels amen and having and let me tell you if he can get you deceived he has a personal gain he can bring another person to hell do you know hell wasn't even created for f f f f f f for god's people the hell was created for the devil and his angels but the bible say hell hath enlarges mouth because so many people are being deceived they'll end up going to hell hallelujah the devil will deceive you and tell you that this this lifestyle that you live in unholy unrighteous lifestyle is better than living for god that's deception hallelujah i mean the devil gets you in the spot and then try to cut your life off real quick why are you sinning he trying to cut you off hallelujah but god said i come to give you life and life more abundantly amen but look at this now the devil's always deceiving watch this isaiah 14 how art thou verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which this weekend the nations hallelujah i'm at verse 13. he says for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation oh hallelujah amen the devil hallelujah it wants some worship amen it's not just the devil fighting you when you leave church it's the devil fighting you actually in the church the devil come through a preacher come on somebody the devil will use a minister a so-called minister you want to know who the first preacher to ever preach the word of god it was the devil himself when he preached the eve he began to interpret and explain scripture to eve and he fell for the deception hallelujah created all the problems that we got today this is the reason we attend funerals because of what happened in the garden of eden he fell for deception look at this so thou has said in our heart says i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the size of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high now now there's a couple things that we need to look at especially in that scripture now satan we we know that he tried to get be um he wanted to be like god he wanted to be like god and and uh but this scripture says that he would exalt himself uh exalt my throne above the stars of god i'm exalt my throne above the stars of god you know who the stars of god are i i got some good news for you do you realize you are one of god's stars satan wanted to exalt himself above you and you know why you know why he won't exalt himself above you because based on your understanding the devil has one place and that's underneath your and the devil's tired of being underneath your feet so he trying to exalt himself above you now i'ma tell you if you talking with the devil if you're having conversation with the devil that means you got to get down to his level and his levels underneath my feet you got to get to a point where you're not even having conversations with him anymore it's a waste of time now now i want to i want to read a quote here just real quick out of the message god's power to transform i want to i want you to get get this really quick because the prophet helps us to see this amen when we're reading that scripture out of isaiah 14 we can we can we can apply this it says satan's purpose satan's purpose from eden was to make his own self in eden satan's purpose from eden was to make himself amen make make his own self in eden and exalt himself above the stars of god so he said exalt himself above so the stars of god would worship him sons would worship him and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this and brought it into the church which i won't go if you listen to them tapes know about it that's exactly the hour we're living in and if satan's that that that's that's done it through educational programs this is how this is how satan got into the church i want y'all to catch what the prophet is sharing with us the devil got into the church through educational programs through educational programs better fit better this better that and not knowing all the time they're walking straight right straight into death blind leading the blind blinded leaders of the nations blinded leaders of science blind leaders of the church blind leading the blind that jesus said left them alone they will both fall in the ditch satan wanted to be worshipped satan won and and i was just reading a little something here and i won't i won't read it i'll just kind of share with you when god created uh adam and eve and before sin came into the earth um there uh god bringing the animals up to to adam and having him name all the animals and and all of this and you know just just allowing him to exercise his dominion in the garden and you know and and i mean in the cool of the evening uh after god took that rib out of adam and made made eve and in the coolest evening he would come down and have fellowship with with adam how was your day today how did this go and how did that go and they just have just real good fellowship he says uh you know and and as as uh as as these things were going on there in the uh let me just uh just something i want to catch here real quick uh i mean questions and answers law having a shadow just go there i wanna i wanna i gotta i gotta inject this i don't wanna skip over it questions and answers law having a shadow he says there stood adam and eve a beautiful woman oh my can see there adam with them dark shaggy locks hanging around his head now when the prophet is saying i can see this i actually believe through a prophetic lens he's actually seeing this now don't say that's that's that's that's unheard of how could moses write the first five books of the bible and not be there how could moses do that how can moses tell us what happened in the garden of eden and moses was not there but we believe him it's because moses was looking through a prophetic lens hallelujah so when brother branham is saying say i can see this i actually believe he's looking at it through a prophetic lens this is what he's seeing and telling us what he's seeing hallelujah that's what a prophet can do it says death stood adam and eve uh eve a beautiful one oh my i can see there adam with them dark shaggy locks around his head those bright flashy eyes look over to his little sweetheart eve and such a perfect built woman and her hair looked up and and her eyes as blue as the sky adam loved her oh how he loved her but when sin into the end their little home was broken up because an old lustful beast my the devil had got into an animal called the serpent not a reptile this gun this is going to get a little amen uh we're going to go a little deep in this because i'm going to just be like i'm going to just be honest if church can't get what happened in the garden eden right how are they going to get the rest of the bible right remember the bible doesn't say that the devil was a snake he wasn't a snake in the beginning oh i'ma break it down the snake wasn't like he is now in the beginning the curse put him where he's at the bible said not a reptile he was a beast and the most son of all beasts of the field he looked more like a man than anything you have ever had walked upright there was there was there's where the devil got it god got in him and come to eve this beautiful made woman she did what was wrong now he says this take your idea of it i got mine i'm gonna come back to that take your idea of it i got mine i'm gonna try to explain to you what his idea was let me just finish reading all right now then she brought forth the first son cain the nature after the daddy a murderer hate and so forth noticed them uh when taken place what taking place after that then when god came down to talk fellowship had been broken could you imagine adam oh and eve setting out in the garden of eden under them them great them great palm trees god would come down and say my children yes father it's all well all is well have you enjoyed the blessings of your father this day yes father we enjoyed it here come leo the lion up leo meows like a kitten adam pats him on the head he kneels himself down here comes cheetah the tiger and all them comes up lays down meows around and god's great voice roaring through the top of them trees my creation have you enjoyed what your father has given you this day yes father every day no death no sorrow there it is that's the way god said oh isn't this wonderful now i want to just catch this because uh there's a statement that is made here that i just think is just a little uh the tongue just kind of got ahead of itself he says and then michael looked over and said i could do that too he wouldn't talk about michael that's where the devil came in when he looked at how adam was naming all the animals then he looked at how all the fellowship was going inside the garden of eden no sin no sorrow no headache justice this this place of peace love and true happiness amen it all exists in the garden but when it's when satan just kind of looked he said i can do that too look at this now he says oh brother don't you get yourself contrary to god's word that's what's the matter with these churches today i can make an organization too as good as they are oh get away from it stay with god's word yes sir let god uh god was the one speaking so here's satan just desired to see the same thing and amen he won the same thing god had he want the same type of fellowship he wanted the same type of worship he wanted all these things now and i i was just kind of thinking about this satan won in worship he wanted worse that's why the scriptures say he was sitting in the size of the north going into the you know the congregation he went to sit on another side of the church to try to i want some of this hallelujah somebody amen he he said i i i see what these th these these the the stars are doing it and i want something i would like for them to worship me and i'ma tell you he's accomplished that there are people going to church every week worshiping the devil and don't even realize it hallelujah because if they're not worshiping according to truth they're worshiping satan they don't realize it some of the teachers that are going forth out of the pulpits satan has inspired some of those teachings deception is going on inside the church and people don't realize it but but as he was there you know just desiring these things amen uh uh sitting in the it says i was sitting in in the mount of the congregation devil in the church the devil in the church hallelujah the way you're going to be able to discern these spirits is by giving them the word tests hallelujah now i want you to just kind of see something i want you to see this satan saying i want to be like god i like some of that worship now when when god created the angels the angels actually brought worship so in god's mind even just won't worship that's not all god was looking for because he created the angels and they brought him worship the devil was missing it all alone god didn't just want worship oh y'all don't get it that's part of it but what god wanted was fellowship do you know the reason why adam got abroad adam was a son of god hallelujah and and god himself was lonely even though he had all this worship god himself was experiencing loneliness so that's why he even made adam now i got a son somebody i can just kind of share some of my thoughts with share some of my ideas with but when he looked he'd say now i made a male this and a female dad and male this and a female that but when he made adam he made adam both male and female hallelujah and that loneliness that was in god he can look down and see that loneliness is now inside of adam hallelujah so he says adam i see the loneliness in you every time you name an animal they're coming in pairs and you're looking at yourself and wondering where is my mate because adam was expressing what was in god god didn't want just worship god said where is my mate hallelujah i'm telling you the maid of god is here this morning you are the maid of god do you want to walk you want to know one thing that's greater than the blood i say do you want to know one thing that's greater than the blood the purchase of the blood you are why he came to calvary you are why he died you are why he rules again you are why where is my wife oh jesus adam adam see see i i it was i don't have time to get it all it was three bribes and i'm gonna try to get into the maybe i get in there a little bit later adam had a bride god had a bride jesus had a brat see what was in adam he don't realize he was just expressing these attributes that was in god when god said now you know i see i see you alone you're wondering adam what what's going on here it's two cheetahs two monkeys two cows two elephants two tigers two lions two dogs two cats two two two two two two but i'm standing here by myself and god knew what was in adam so god put adam to sleep took and put them to sleep and said now i made you male and female now do you realize at the time that god made adam uh uh now and she wasn't eve yet because eve means mother of all living i can't even get to my message y'all don't pull me right eve means mother of all living and and hallelujah let me just slow down before i get off but but but here here here here eve was in adam hallelujah and do you know while she was in adam she was co-equal she was co-equal when she was in adam it's only when sin came oh lord help us jesus it's only when sin came and sin came through eve she introduced this to adam hallelujah adam willfully fell for this because he loved us so much he willfully went into this act with eve hallelujah let's just stop and just deal with these things now i i i read the quote and brother branham said i got my idea on it you have your idea and i got my idea and i'm gonna tell you my idea is the same idea as the prophets my idea what really happened to garden of eden what happened this forbidden fruit forbidden fruit that's what churches say they ate a forbidden fruit okay what was the forbidden fruit nobody got an answer and the other thing i have why did she get pregnant after eating the fruit people need to answer the questions let's go back to the bible and answer the question why did eve get pregnant after eating this this fruit now they said in my church years ago they tell me apple then they went to apricot they went to all kinds of things my question is is if they if they ate an apple back then and got pregnant why can't people eat apples a day and get pregnant well the apple didn't get cursed i ain't read that in the bible the apple didn't get cursed the tree wasn't cursed there was three people got in trouble adam by the sweat of your brow you're gonna work now eve gonna bring four children to heart labor and and and and eve blamed it they had a blame game going eve made a statement should say i was deceived beguiled by the serpent what happened what happened the way she got beguiled is that the devil that got kicked out of heaven we read it it was ready last week he came down out of heaven went into the garden of eden got into the serpent well what did the serpent look like before he was cursed because the bible say he went on his belly the curse put him on his belly he did something before the curse i'm here to tell you this is why god sent a prophet a prophet can take us back to genesis like like moses and the prophet tells us that the the the the the serpent actually took on stood on two feet just like a man he could talk just like a man because he was talking to eve and he could have relations with a serpent and produce another serpent or have relations with a human and produce not a human but produce something and that something that was produced was king and this is why the bible says when you read your bible i say i say see i'm not trying to hide nothing i'm giving you scripture right when you read your bible you will first notice in all the genealogies in scripture cain's name is never mentioned with adam read the bible but also in the book of first john i believe chapter 3 verse 12 it says king was of that wicked one adam was not wicked adam was god's son made in his image what happened she believed a lie satan sold her on this thing you go you know if you're taking this fruit you're going to be like god she was already like god she was made in his image so he just kind of twisted the word on and deception said it and deception created all these problems i told you it was it was three brats adam had a bride his bride was lost through deception jehovah had a bribe it was the nation of israel he actually told him in the scripture i am married to you i'm married to israel and you know what when god is married to you ain't nothing you can do to get away from him now you might go into some situations like israel did they they went into all kind of stuff but they could not be lost they had to come back because he was married to him hallelujah some of y'all down went through some stuff and the reason you keep coming back because god is married to you you know you know what happened you know what happened with israel they got all messed up they and this is what happened to the church i want to just kind of talk and i i won't have time to read all the quotes but uh what happened to israel is that when they start desiring a king to be like the other nations that's when they start being deceived because other nations were serving false gods you know what used to happen in israel they were led by a prophet when israel was led by prophets nothing went wrong samuel was leading them giving them the mind of god tell them exactly what to do but when they say we want to be like other nations we want to have a king just like they have a king when they got to that that's when they were being deceived and they got pulled off into things that they never thought that they would ever be because the kings hallelujah led them into idolatry their leaders led them into idolatry can i tell you same thing that happened in church preachers have led the people into idolatry when you got father son and holy ghost as three different gods you're an idol worshiper because the lord our god is one amen that's what moses taught all right church and then paul picked it up and said it's one lord one faith one baptism so so tell me how we got these two different baptisms can i just talk to y'all today how how we get baptized in the name of the father son and the holy ghost and baptize the name of the lord jesus christ i went to church and the guy was baptizing he said i baptize you in the name of the father the son of the holy ghost and in the name of the lord jesus christ i say well what in the world just happened here and they be celebrating all the number of baptisms that they have we got this many baptized that many and they're baptizing them wrong i'm just talking can i just keep talking i mean they so so they bash on them so how do we get these things fixed because we got something you got jesus said baptized in the name of the father name of the son the name of the holy ghost say jesus said that so so we're going to follow what jesus said and then peter and i know peter wasn't the brightest i know that peter couldn't even sign his own name but ten days after peter received those instructions had a mighty experience on the day of pentecost peter tells us that somebody said man brother what should we do to be saved peter say repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the missionary sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he say the promise is unto you your children those that are false as men as the lord god shall call how did peter get it wrong in 10 days i know he wasn't that bright i'm i'm asking two questions how did peter get it wrong and why did god allowed to be put in the bible because i asked somebody that said peter had it wrong i said no maybe peter had it right and maybe we got it wrong because i'ma tell you what peter understood peter when he said baptizing peter was damned jesus said baptize them in the name of the father in the name of the son and in the name of the holy ghost peter knew that father that's a title son that's a title holy ghost that's just what it is and it's also you know human beings would be a title for us too he says but he said he said because i'm a father i'm a son i'm i'm a brother i'm a pastor i got all these titles he said but what's the name of the father what's the name of the son what's the name of the holy ghost and peter could deduce things you know and i i don't have time to read all this but it's in the bible do you know the jews the reason they crucified jesus because he said he was the son of god and by saying according to the jews by saying you are the son of god that makes you god the jews believe that it's in it's in the book of john the jews believe if you say you the son of god that actually makes you god so that's why they came against jesus so peter had the revelation when peter when you say uh uh peter who does who do men say i am some say you're elias some say you john the baptist i mean some say uh jeremiah some one of the prophets say uh i heard that now not peter who do you who you say i am peter thou are the christ the son of the living god now by peter actually using the words thou art the christ the son he was actually identifying jesus as god because the jews believed that if you identify as the son of god you're calling yourself god peter knew that jesus was god not two different gods god the father became the son and while he was on earth he said you know what i'm not gonna leave you without a confidence i'm going to give you something to dwell on the inside it cause you to be able to live the way i'm living and that's what the spirit of god comes to do inside of us it's the same god all the way through the bible he took on the flesh of jesus peter said i got that the reason i say baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because jesus is the father jesus is the son jesus is the holy ghost and we didn't know god's name until we knew jesus adam had a wife that got deceived and i only got to see if she end up pregnant before adam came to her this is what happened in the garden she was pregnant by by the serpent and the devil anointed the serpent to do what he did the devil even studied all the animals he knew what this animal could do and he used it and you said god the devil don't use animals is that right is that right why in scripture when jesus come along and them devils had that man in a graveyard the devils pray oh lord i'm all i'm back at it again i'm back at it the devil's praying and said jesus please don't send us to the abyss but let us go into the swine and do you know what jesus did gave them permission i want you to know that if a devil can ask for a prayer request and get it granted what you think about a son or daughter of god you we ought to stop having in mind battles that god ain't gonna hear our prayer if the devil had his prayer answered i know i'm gonna get mines so the devil does take over animals the devil does now i want to go further i i'm trying to get to this point god adam had a bright god had abroad god's bride was israel they got trapped in an organizationalism let's put it that way that was their problem and jesus had a bride that came out at the day of pentecost but you know what they also got trapped in denominationalism hallelujah oh my you know the denominationalism came in because the church was standing very pure but when catholic teaching start entering in this is where the church got all messed up amen that that council i can't even think of it right now nice seeing that uh that brought in a lot of confusion to the church this is where this different baptism came in baptizing the name of the father son the holy ghost a lot of the uh i mean the three gods the trinity the word trinity is not even in the bible but yet they use it anyway in church they worship in the devil and don't even realize it the devil brought what we call a uh uh a a a religion from a bottomless pit teachings from a bottomless pit revelation talks about and the reason that it's a bottomless pit is because it has no foundation in scripture they teach it hallelujah jesus had a bride now i got to read these quotes now i'm i'm here where i want to be jesus had a bride she got messed up at the day of i mean after the day of pentecost when they started allowing through the church ages when they started allowing all these false teachings to come in now let me just read something to you glory to god this is coming out of the message of a super sign i just got to read just a couple things to you and then i want to i want to hit something coming out of superson says why did she realize she was naked absolutely why did life come by that that perverted life god that the great contractor had all the bodies laid out here on the earth calcium pot pods petroleum he was going to create it and make it but she bypassed the way of god yes sir what did adam do when he come to his wife when he come to her he found her pregnant just exactly of an evil her own exception conception had received foul seed this is eve jehovah before he could marry his wife did the same thing and jesus before he could get to his bride hallelujah you could see number four eve got to adam before adam could actually you know because god gave him a commandment to reproduce multiply replenish the earth but before adam could do that he was already deceived he was already a man defiled he was already pregnant hallelujah now he's giving us a type here because this is spiritual he says before he could get this bro she had organized herself and become the roman catholic church before jesus could get to his bride she had organized herself and become the roman catholic church same thing but he will have a bride don't you worry that will be brought with his word just exactly what he told eve to stay with amen he will have a church amen that will be brought that would be bought by his word now i want to just put this in here too the bride will be a a word born virgin word born bride just the same as christ was virgin born through mary i'ma say that again the bride will be virgin word born amen just as christ was born of the virgin mary now how we get virgin work born we go back to the scripture and as we stand on the word of god we're born of this word of god amen amen i got i got i got i just want to read a couple more things to you ephesians 5 25 27 how are we becoming word born look at this ephesians 5 25-27 he says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word we're being washed by the water of the word that's what's causing us to be a virgin born word born pride listen he says he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish i'm gonna tell you the blood is making me what i need to be in god's sight i'm not even thinking about any mistakes that i made when he said that there was going to be a bribe i'm here now i got i got one other quote i want to read to you before i i just give you a little story here this is out of crisis the mystery of god revealed i want you to look at this i told you it's impossible deception impossible eve was deceived amen uh the nation of israel was deceived the first church even at the day of pentecost are deceived but we've learned from all their mistakes and we will not be deceived notice this in a statement notice making it known now he says uh making it known how am i there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice the tree of christ's body in the garden now making this mystery known to this broad tree watch redeemed by christ the second adam you believe he was amen going back home to eden with his fallen wife redeemed back home again that's christ in the church today taking his wife back he says see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church altogether to bring back the original adam and eve again this is the whole purpose of you coming to church god trying to bring you back to the original adam and eve again he says man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and same spirit and everything else it says the church is the blood of christ by the spirit my god i love these words he says the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognize only his body his flesh his word he says denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did eve know it but she failed this is something i want you to bank your solo but this one knows it and won't fall we know something that the rest of them didn't know we're looking at an open book and and since we won't fall this is impossible deception listen says she is ordained hallelujah whoa she is ordained to not fall can i can i uh can i tell you when god made eve i told you this early and i finished it god wanted more than just worship god wanted fellowship and do you know when god made eve he actually knew he knew that eve would do what she did god knew it and i'ma tell you not only god knew it god allowed it you know why because eve was the only only thing made that was made from something else she was not a part of the original creation her spirit was but her body was made from something else hallelujah right so god already knew that this thing was going to happen and and what that did this is where satan was blinded he thought god just wanted worship but what he found out is that god wanted a lot more than worship god wanted redemption god wanted restoration god wanted healing god wanted deliverance god god every attribute that you can imagine god wanted and the only way those attributes could be released in god is that he allowed the loudest thing to happen hallelujah to the lamb of god let me finish this she's ordained hallelujah who she's ordained not to fall she won't she won't fail she's predestinated to it blessed is the man who god will not impute sin you ministers know what i'm speaking of when there's a couple dozen of you sitting here blessed is the man whom god will not abuse sin that's what david said now now uh when god has made up his mind to use you god ain't looking for nobody else when god has decided that you're going to be the one he's not looking for anybody else to to try to fill your place i don't care what to do to try to get out of it amen when god chose israel no matter what israel did he kept bringing israel back can't restore them they're going bondage for so many years they i mean you look at the book of judges they they in bondage but they come out in bondage come out in bondage come on and that's many of our stories we end bondage but we come out god has his eye on you and there's no nobody can do anything about that i love that there was a man there in scripture we read about him at the beginning god had a purpose for samson samson's uh purpose was to destroy philistines god raised this man was born on the earth just to kill philistines to help his people remain free from the bondage that the philistines would always try to put on i mean oftentimes uh samson would they would at one time in his life he went down and uh they said we're coming to get him and and uh you know we tired of this guy samson and samson you know kind of uh uh uh maybe going into you know whatever they want him doing and then an anointed would come on samson my god he picked up a jawbone of of a mule picked up a jawbone and beat down a thousand men with a jawbone the jawbone should have broke the very first man that he hit but god anointed samson to to destroy them philosophy even when samson was down in the house of a harlot shouldn't have been there come on so must go places that we're not supposed to go amen but here sampson was down in the house of a harlot and and and when it gets down there the philistines coming around said we're going to get this guy now but even in his sin the anointing was still with him when he come out from that house and saw them philistines they had a gate there and sampson picked up the gates and took them to the top of the hill y'all can't get me i mean this man was anointed to destroy philistines many of these philistines saw maybe their fathers or their brothers or their other other their their sons they saw relatives die because of this man sampson so finally they come up with a plan samson has a weakness he loves philistine women let me tell you something the devil know your weakness some of us and amen brothers may have a problem with philistine women but sisters may have a problem with philistine men praise the lord everybody got a a delilah in their life and god want to see you free from your delilah praise the lord amen but here here samson's in this situation and um and and and it gets to the spot where you know now now before samson had delilah samson had another wife amongst the philistines that he should not have had but he kept going down until he situated it was problem after problem after problem but he tried to see his way through his parents even told him go back down to israel and get yourself a wife but samson just did not want one of the israelite women hallelujah here he was stuck down there oh glory to god maybe some of y'all been told just wait for god to send your husband wait for god to send your wife but no you're going to help god out you end up like samson if samson is in this situation he's down here with delilah delilah i've been told by the the leaders of israel i mean leaders of philistines say you know what if you can get this guy secret that's the way his strength is we will pay you so much money she said y'all do what yeah we'll pay you so much money delilah said i'm gonna get this secret so she went to the samson and she said samson please tell me what's the secret of your strength and as they're working through this and you know samson tell a lie first when they say just just get seven green wish that would never dry and just time together and tie me up and i'll be just like any other man and delilah goes and get the seven greens went ties him up hallelujah glory and uh and then she yells out samson the philistines be upon you like she ain't had nothing to do with it sam said the philistines be upon you and here here here when um samson woke up he pops pops free hallelujah says no i'm gonna get out of this and and he broke free now brother random say when samson and this is out of the message deceived church by the world you can go and listen to that he says when samson broke free the first time that was luther in the days of luther the church broke free from catholicism that's where the protestant reformation came in luther broke free hallelujah he says but you know what samson kept laying down even the church kept laying down in the lap of the devil praise god hallelujah kept laying down and then she said just say samson you you just you you didn't you deceived me you did i deceived you you deceived me just deception all over the place say steps you you didn't tell me where the strength was say i tell you what if you just give me some get some new ropes and you tie me the ropes that were never occupied then i'll be just like any other man and she tied him up with these new ropes yeah that samson the philistines be upon you say say you woke up broke up broke free he said that was wesley the methodist church that broke free methodist starts shouting and speaking in tongues and nowadays you can't see method is shouting and speaking in tongues but back in those days the method is actually shattered and spoken talks hallelujah they broke free but you know what they stepped they kept laying in the lap of delilah got bound again this time delilah says samson did it to me two times i i'm tired of this you know you got to stop making me look like this tell me what your strength is samson this time tells the third time he says if you weave the seven locks in my head with a web then i'd be just like any other man and now he was getting closer and closer to where his strength was hallelujah and this time when he says this just weave the seven locks in my head say i mean delilah weave them seven locks and she yelled out again samson the philistines be upon you samson woke up like he did the first two times broke free from these philistines and they said now brother branham say this was where pentecost came in because pentecost looked so close to the truth and and and samson got so close to the truth the way his strength was they broke free three times for the fourth time he couldn't break free and when pentecost went into organization they have not broken free i'm walking through the history of the church in the story of samson hallelujah glory to god they didn't break free this time samson finally told her if you just cut my hair i'm a nazarite i've been a nazirite all my days and if you just cut my hair i'm going to be just like any other man and this time she she called the man in and told the philistines he done gave me all his heart now we're gonna cut his hair and we're gonna let y'all go take him away sam saying the philistines be playing he woke up like he was gonna do it just like the last three times this time he didn't realize the anointing was already gone i want to tell you something brother branham said it like this god will use you until you go flirting with the world but when you stop flirting then god can use you again this time when he woke up there was no breaking free and this time it got worse because they took out his eyes they they they made sport of them they they they had him in bondage glory to god the church looked like it was defeated when it went back into organization in the days of pentecost hallelujah if i i don't have time to go into all this history but i'm i'm just trying to summarize and give you a little but the church i mean through luther they broke free through wesley they broke free through pentecost those great moves of god that god used but it wasn't the they wasn't the the final move samson why he was bound and i can say why we were i was in pentecost i was in baptist some of y'all have come from methodist some of you all have come from catholic hallelujah oh my god it said we come from these different different you know the delilah would have represented the catholic church oh yeah delilah would have represented the catholic church that was binding them an organization that's what delilah represented and so luther broke free but went right back into it wesley broke free but went right back into the pentecostals also broke free but they're right back into it the pentecost is where the callers just like the catholics see we we we see these stories in scripture but it has a much deeper meaning but i want to tell you something the script we read it while samson was bound it was making sport the scripture said there was something that happened while he was bound and while the church has been bound the devil making sport like they ain't got the power no more that i mean god ain't doing what he used to do no more in the church the church i mean just been made fun of by the devil there was one thing happening to samson while he was in bondage his hair began to grow back and them devils didn't know what that meant that his hair was going back his glory was coming back come on somebody hey man that that hair represented his glory his glory was coming back his strength was coming back without them realizing it i might not have my eyes or cc some people can't see scripture the way they need to see scripture they don't have eyes to see they don't have ears to hear but when god anoints them and gives them the ears to hear the eyes see i pray that they'll go free finally sampson's hair start growing back now samson knew that that anointing was coming the back of god has come back to the church the word of god has been restored back to the church god promised that he would do these things before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord as as the power began to come back samson reached over and it's about three or four thousand philistines gathered a man at this this event where they're making sports look at him he used to do this to us and now look at what we're doing to him look at where he's at and say all of a sudden samson uh he could feel the strength come back he knew them all he did just reach back and say that the seven locks are back grow back hallelujah and sam samson say little lad i now i've seen this this this colosseum before i maybe defeated some devils here before he says but he says now there's a there's some pillars amen and little lad if you don't mind just take me into the two pillars just place me right there in between the two i can't see my way so i'm depending on you and maybe he told a little lad now when you get me to wear them two pillars at least go home son get out of here as fast as you can just take me to the pillow son and once you get there just go ahead and leave now samson's standing there between them two pillars hallelujah this is where the church has been for for some years i'm talking about the bride because he gonna have a bride that will not fall lord she's ordained not to fall glory to god i'm part of that brat so just lead me to the pillars and samson stood there and they prayed the prayer and said lord i i failed you i messed up god but i'm just actually i feel the seven locks and i get i shouldn't have been down here with this delilah i shouldn't have been down here amongst these philistines you you you ordained me to destroy philistines god i'm sorry i failed you says but god just one more time say once more lord he said not now this time this time when when when when when when when when you're known to come upon me god i'ma just push these pillars and he said this time when the north are coming from what i want to access to do let me die with these philistines and samson when he pushed them pillars down samson also died but he killed more philistines in his death than he did while he was alive i'm gonna tell you when you willing to die to yourself when you're willing to die you're thinking when you're willing to die to how you were taught when you're willing to die to that you'll see god come alive inside of you but i'm gonna tell you bake me a cake first die to the word first watch god come alive i want to give you some good news you it's impossible for you to be deceived impossible this final quote i want to read to you deceive church by the world prophecy so revival in our day how can we have it when the the regular revival giver is bound by the world god won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that you associate with the world it's all of it when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world then you're finished but when you're cut loose from every feather from the world and come to god god will use you until you go to flirting again here's the only hope that i have this morning to wind up this message is this while samson was bound a new shock of hair growed out he says god send us another church just before the end time that the power of the holy ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit and mark 16 can follow the church acts 2 4 acts 2 38 all of it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompanied the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompany them while we're in prison surely god's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill may it be you my christian friend here this morning may it be your strength has been has begun to grow i pray that this message this morning and out into the land to where this will go i trust that this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow a spiritual power back into your life again so let us bow our heads and pray and that's what we want to do let's bow our heads and pray father what a consolation we can have in reading the scripture it'd be false christ false anointed ones false prophets that would rise but we know that there would be at least one truth because there couldn't be a false unless there was a truth father my prayers uh that you would help us oh god to to be who you've called us to be to help us lord to be able to see things from the scriptures perspective we look through the story of samson and just see how the church lord throughout the uh the history christ brought how they were just so messed up the gods you promised that they would be one without spot or wrinkle you promised lord that uh god that you would have a bride that was ordained not to fall one that has learned the lessons from the previous uh people that have walked to earth lord i believe i'm preaching to that group of people here today i pray lord that the word that has been spoken would sink into the depths of our soul that we would understand what we're called to this not by accident it's not by chance lord but we're that little group that's representing the shock of hair that's grown back in samson that would destroy more philistines lord as a and are going oh god that's uh we know that there's a rapture weight in this church and we'll destroy more philistines that are going that's what's that that's going to be the proof that we were that we were following the truth the rapture is only for the bride father i pray that the people would just stay focused in this hour the angel of the lord when he told the angel pick up your pen and write he gave us warning that many would just be looking for signs wonders and miracles lord but they'd be disobeying the word and and god we don't want to put the word second we want to put the word of god first help us lord to follow with everything we have [Music] it's in the name of jesus that we pray amen amen amen amen amen impossible deception i i want to amen i want you to just leave with a consolation in your heart god does not do things just to be doing but he he he it's impossible you are his elect you will not be deceived you ordained not to fall in this hour you won't be like eve you won't be like the children of israel who's 10 lost their way you won't be like that you're going to make it church you're going to make it because god ordained for you to make it i believe that i believe that amen brother solomon you can come and amen just close us out amen the song says god will make a way where there seems to be no way hallelujah oh he works in ways we cannot see and he will make a way for me and he will be my guide he'll draw me closely to his side hallelujah with love and strength for each new day he will make a way he will make a way everybody say god will make a way
