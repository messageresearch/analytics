[28:51] West Palm Beach for a long time even
[28:53] before we came from South Carolina this
[28:55] was the place that we wanted to come
[28:59] but the Lord didn't provide a job here
[29:02] he provided a job near my hometown so
[29:04] that's where we moved but we've always
[29:06] wanted to come here
[29:08] so back in may we decided to put our
[29:10] house on the market
[29:12] and the real estate agent he came by the
[29:15] house and he was there
[29:17] and um
[29:19] we signed the papers and he said you
[29:21] know I have a client that's supposed to
[29:23] close tomorrow but I want to call them
[29:25] so he called them and uh they wanted to
[29:29] to come by and see the house they came
[29:31] by that night
[29:33] and that morning we went on a contract
[29:36] strange thing is after a few weeks
[29:39] things didn't go the way that they
[29:41] needed it to go so they had to pull out
[29:43] of the contract so we put our house on
[29:46] the market on the market
[29:47] and we had somebody else go on the
[29:49] contract
[29:50] but they seem to want everything fixed
[29:53] they they had shopped around in every
[29:55] house that they liked they said we need
[29:57] this fix and the people said no we're
[29:59] not going to fix it we're not going to
[30:00] fix it so with us they said we need this
[30:03] fix we say we'll do it because we want
[30:05] to give them the best we don't want to
[30:07] give them something bad it's going to be
[30:08] their home so we agree we'll fix this
[30:11] okay will you fix this we'll fix this
[30:13] what about this we'll give you credit
[30:16] towards that you can get a new uh
[30:18] dishwasher
[30:21] they pulled out a contract
[30:24] so we come to the third time and uh
[30:27] but actually
[30:29] as we were preparing the house
[30:32] we were going to get the roof fixed so
[30:34] the roofer that came by his name was
[30:36] Paul he was a very very nice man so Paul
[30:39] he set it up where we had this
[30:42] this way we can pay it off real quick
[30:44] quickly so
[30:45] and we spoke with Paul and then
[30:48] um we got the house inspected so when
[30:51] the inspector came by his name was Paul
[30:54] it's like this is this is strange didn't
[30:56] think nothing of it not too much but
[30:59] then when we had to get someone to look
[31:01] at the air conditioner two guys came out
[31:03] it was a Matt Matthew and a Paul
[31:06] so we were speaking to the real estate
[31:09] agent and Nell was like man that's three
[31:11] paws
[31:12] I know about Paul where's my Elijah
[31:17] so
[31:19] um they pulled out they actually pulled
[31:21] out the date of the meetings that Friday
[31:23] of the meetings so we came to church had
[31:26] a great weekend

[31:57] then we have another buyer he's actually
[31:59] a FHA buyer so there may be some
[32:04] problems but this is his offer
[32:06] he said you know I did some research on
[32:08] the company they're a legitimate company
[32:10] and I did some research
[32:12] on a this buyer so right before I go
[32:16] there
[32:17] Sunday
[32:19] Naomi was out out talking about speaking
[32:21] with two of the sisters from London and
[32:24] as they were talking they almost telling
[32:26] them about the open house and everything
[32:27] and she was just speaking with him and
[32:29] the sisters both turned at the same time
[32:31] and said I give it to you in the name of
[32:34] the Lord Jesus they looked at one
[32:36] another and started laughing because
[32:37] they they said it both at the same time
[32:40] so when he began to tell us about
[32:43] this buyer with the FHA loan said his
[32:47] name is Eli
[32:49] that's what I said wait man isn't Eli
[32:52] short for Elijah
[32:54] yeah
[32:56] that's all about it
[32:59] praise the Lord
[33:02] so different things are going on
[33:04] everything just seemed to just keep
[33:06] rolling keep rolling we had our
[33:08] appraisal come up I asked the brothers
[33:10] to pray and sister name Naomi I guess
[33:12] she had the sisters to pray so when the
[33:15] appraiser came out he came out and he
[33:17] was an hour late he came in the house
[33:20] and
[33:22] he was there four minutes and he was
[33:24] gone
[33:25] and then that night was it the same
[33:28] night that very night
[33:30] we got results back that it appraised
[33:33] for more than what we thought it would
[33:37] so the real estate agent said hey uh

[50:10] there was
[50:12] uh the devotion
[50:16] for tomorrow

[50:21] has promised to be greater than the
[50:23] former house
[50:25] the children of Israel experienced that
[50:28] but God's promises can be applied in all
[50:30] generations
[50:32] therefore I am under expectation and I
[50:37] am claiming this for our first church
[50:41] building the glory of owning

[50:50] greater than renting

[53:21] just blessings to the Saints at s.a.t
[53:24] Tabernacle uh thank you for the warm and
[53:27] Open Hearts that Embrace US during our

[53:32] with the sudden loss of barrel which is
[53:35] Sister wasting was made more uh bearable
[53:39] because of your love support and

[53:48] may He Who rewards openly those things
[53:52] done in secret pour you out uh
[53:56] pour you out blessing that you won't be
[54:00] able to contain
[54:02] amen I'm receiving that
[54:07] amen
[54:11] amen it says love
[54:15] um always this is from uh brother
[54:18] Rupert's Sister video and brother Glenn
[54:20] Roy a man who came to visit with us and
[54:23] uh they were just really really uh
[54:26] blessed uh just with their time here so
[54:28] we thank God that we're able to host
[54:30] them and certainly look forward to them
[54:31] returning again
[54:34] amen amen amen amen uh he probably
[54:39] wouldn't want me to say this but you
[54:41] know before he left he just said he had
[54:43] to be a blessing here to the church and
[54:45] it gave us very very substantial
[54:48] um uh offering to our church and we just
[54:52] we just really appreciate that we like I
[54:55] tell people we don't do things in order
[54:56] to try to get uh but uh but you know the
[55:00] Lord puts it in people's heart to give
[55:03] so we we receive and and don't be so uh
[55:09] uh surprise
[55:11] that you can't receive right because
[55:14] what happens when you receive you
[55:16] actually open up the channels of
[55:18] blessing for the person that's giving
[55:20] right so so anytime somebody's trying to
[55:22] give you something you know just thank
[55:24] you amen appreciate it praise the Lord
[55:26] amen now I don't need it yeah I might
[55:29] not need it but I thank you for it
[55:32] all right Church
[55:34] all right but that's the way we want to
[55:36] be but we we really really thank God for
[55:39] them just having that in their heart to
[55:40] do that amen uh um oh the other thing I
[55:43] want to mention here really quick I know
[55:45] that we we talk about uh our giving and
[55:49] um for some reason and I've been using
[55:51] PayPal for a long time but some reason
[55:53] PayPal has kind of changed something and
[55:56] what PayPal is doing is they
[55:58] automatically assigning it as a good or
[56:02] service
[56:03] rather than allowing you to send to a
[56:05] friend a family member and since you
[56:08] have it as a good of service they
[56:10] automatically take a certain money
[56:11] amount of money out and that's that's my
[56:15] tithing that I'm paying God
[56:18] and I ain't paying that to PayPal I'm
[56:20] paying God
[56:22] right I give God my tithing right so so
[56:25] so uh I want to encourage y'all if
[56:28] PayPal can't get this fixed use some of
[56:30] the other means sale or cash app amen
[56:35] use use one of them because we ain't
[56:37] giving it the PayPal
[56:39] amen PayPal be need to give it to us
[56:43] right but uh but but I want to just
[56:46] encourage you you know to do that if you
[56:48] can because uh they they just and I went
[56:50] through trying to do all kind of things
[56:52] how come this thing won't let me change
[56:53] this and I went men multiple times but I
[56:56] noticed they just keep taking it keep
[56:57] taking say okay I got it I gotta I gotta
[57:00] fix for you
[57:01] his name is Zale
[57:02] [Music]
[57:06] God is good all right so keep that in
[57:08] mind musicians thank y'all so much I
[57:10] sure appreciate y'all amen
[57:16] amen
[57:20] so on today Brothers uh want to just ask
[57:24] that you all would just help us and
[57:27] today we have to do something a little
[57:29] different than we had to do since we've
[57:31] been here today we actually have to take
[57:33] everything out of the room and not just
[57:36] across the hall but we have to use our
[57:38] storage that the that we've been using
[57:40] we gotta unload uh put it all on the
[57:43] back of the trucks and and and and out
[57:47] and uh we got to bring it back so
[57:49] Wednesday night we got to bring certain
[57:50] things back and this is why we what I'm
[57:52] trying to do is kind of
[57:54] um yeah simplify things that's why you
[57:57] see me using this and I like using this
[57:59] because this is something my daddy made
[58:02] right so it's special to me amen my
[58:05] daddy designed this sometimes he would
[58:07] like to get to working with wood and and
[58:09] he left something behind
[58:11] uh for all of us to be able to enjoy so
[58:14] so I like working with this a little
[58:16] different a little different but
[58:18] nonetheless it's it's uh it's precious
[58:20] to me so uh we're trying to simplify
[58:23] some of the things that we're doing uh
[58:25] so that it's not as much to do but but
[58:28] yes we do have to break everything down
[58:30] and Fridays and I mean uh Wednesdays and
[58:32] Fridays we'll be doing you know a little
[58:34] setup and breakdown and all that and to
[58:36] the Lord and I'ma just be honest it's
[58:39] frustrating to me uh to have to and I
[58:43] know other churches do it all the time
[58:44] but I prayed a long time and Lord I just
[58:47] don't want to be in a situate just give
[58:49] us a place we ain't got the breakdown to
[58:50] set up and and God has always honored
[58:53] that prayer and it seemed like it's I
[58:55] just feel like it's the devil right and
[58:58] uh so so uh but it it's you know it's
[59:01] just it's one of those things and I even
[59:02] took off this week I said I got to find
[59:04] us another place I got to find us
[59:06] something you know but then the Lord was
[59:08] kind of telling me say um you got to
[59:10] stay with your confession
[59:12] amen you believing for the church in
[59:14] school just stay right there with your
[59:16] confession just be patient just wait
[59:18] wait I got this thing under control you
[59:22] just I I I I I I went to listen uh to a
[59:27] old sermon
[59:28] um I think it was the title of the
[59:30] sermon was the sixth sense went to work
[59:34] The Sixth Sense went the word
[59:37] and God was rebuking me with my own
[59:40] servant
[59:42] I sat there I say Lord yes Lord yeah but
[59:46] the Sixth Sense meant the word and and
[59:48] there the Lord just saying how we don't
[59:50] we don't put the Sixth Sense out of work
[59:53] he he he got uh put off his job he he
[59:56] not he's not able to even work anymore
[59:58] but God give a situation so the Sixth
[1:00:01] Sense can go to work and that's a sense
[1:00:03] of Faith right amen believe God for the
[1:00:06] impossible so we in one of them
[1:00:07] situations where our sixth sense is at
[1:00:09] work
[1:00:10] amen so I had to take my medicine I said
[1:00:13] Lord I'm sorry forgive me help me to
[1:00:15] only believe amen I only believe and and
[1:00:19] I'm thanking God for for for what he's
[1:00:21] already done amen well I I I'm gonna
[1:00:26] read a scripture today and and I'm going
[1:00:29] to uh um um uh give you the title of
[1:00:33] this sermon
[1:00:34] um we're going to preach today on there
[1:00:36] is power in our Praises amen there is
[1:00:40] power in our Praises amen and if you
[1:00:44] would just stand with me I want to read
[1:00:45] from acts 16
[1:00:49] um verse 6 through 9.
[1:00:53] and as I read the scripture you're going
[1:00:55] to be like where is brother Jack getting
[1:00:57] this title from these verses don't worry
[1:00:59] just hang with me amen it'll all come
[1:01:02] together amen Oh Glory to God all right
[1:01:07] here in Acts 16 Verse 6 it says now when
[1:01:10] they had gone throughout phrygia
[1:01:13] uh and the region of galatia and we're
[1:01:16] forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach
[1:01:18] the word in Asia
[1:01:20] after they were come to Meijer they
[1:01:25] assayed to go into
[1:01:27] bithynia but the spirit suffered them
[1:01:32] not and as we're reading this I want you
[1:01:35] to uh be sensitive
[1:01:38] to the spirit of God we have to learn to
[1:01:40] be sensitive to the spirit of God
[1:01:42] sometimes God will forbid us to do
[1:01:45] certain things amen we might try
[1:01:48] something else and God will say no don't
[1:01:49] do that right and we have to learn to be
[1:01:52] sensitive to the spirit of God all right
[1:01:55] and here uh verse verse 9 says and a
[1:01:59] vision appeared to Paul in the night
[1:02:01] there stood a man of Macedonia and
[1:02:05] prayed him saying come over into
[1:02:07] Macedonia and help us
[1:02:10] and after he had seen the vision
[1:02:13] immediately we endeavored to go into
[1:02:16] Macedonia
[1:02:18] assuredly Gathering that the Lord had
[1:02:21] called us for to preach the gospel unto
[1:02:23] them therefore loosing from trois we
[1:02:27] came with a straight course to some
[1:02:30] samatra Shia and the next day to
[1:02:34] neapolis amen let's pray over the word
[1:02:36] of God father we uh thank you for this
[1:02:40] opportunity to read the scripture but
[1:02:42] Lord we know it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:02:44] make known what it is that we have read
[1:02:48] and God we also know takes the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost to Quicken it and make it alive
[1:02:52] for the the day and time in which we
[1:02:54] live the Lord let your word be quickened
[1:02:57] and as we come farther into the house of
[1:02:59] God gathered here to hear from you speak
[1:03:02] we take every Spirit that's against the
[1:03:04] spirit of God underneath the control of
[1:03:05] the Holy Ghost and God may you get all
[1:03:08] the glory all the honor and all the
[1:03:10] praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:03:14] praise the Lord you can be seated amen
[1:03:18] um again our title for uh today is there
[1:03:22] is power in our Praises amen there is
[1:03:27] power in our Praises
[1:03:30] um
[1:03:31] I uh the
[1:03:34] know the scripture tells us in
[1:03:37] Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing
[1:03:40] but in everything by prayer and
[1:03:44] supplication
[1:03:45] Hallelujah with Thanksgiving
[1:03:48] amen let your requests be made known
[1:03:51] unto God and uh here so there's one
[1:03:55] thing to pray about something uh but
[1:03:58] it's another thing to add Thanksgiving
[1:04:00] with your prayer
[1:04:02] praise God and what the scripture is
[1:04:04] really telling us is that Thanksgiving
[1:04:06] actually occurs before the answer
[1:04:10] before the manifestation amen you need
[1:04:13] to exercise Thanksgiving
[1:04:15] that God has already heard your prayer
[1:04:18] oh hallelujah hallelujah amen so so we
[1:04:22] we uh we we want to operate like this
[1:04:26] and this is why I said when I read that
[1:04:28] little uh uh a devotion for for tomorrow
[1:04:31] amen that I'm already thanking God that
[1:04:34] the the uh uh I said it's gonna be a
[1:04:37] greater blessing to be an owner than to
[1:04:39] be a renter
[1:04:41] amen and I'm already expecting God gonna
[1:04:43] make us owners we've been renters for a
[1:04:46] long time but God is going to make us
[1:04:48] owners and what I'm doing is not just
[1:04:51] praying over that I'm thanking God for
[1:04:53] becoming an owner
[1:04:55] A Hallelujah somebody I'm thanking God
[1:04:57] that he's already made a way
[1:04:59] hey I thank God for supplying the need
[1:05:02] that I have I I thank God in advance for
[1:05:05] what he amen for what he's going to do
[1:05:08] Oh Glory to God Amen there's power in
[1:05:12] our Praises amen I want to read a little
[1:05:14] statement here from uh this message this
[1:05:17] day this scripture is fulfilled uh here
[1:05:19] you know brother Brandon makes a
[1:05:21] statement here says the Pentecostal
[1:05:23] Pentecostal church is in a laodicea and
[1:05:26] condition
[1:05:27] it says oh they still jump and holler
[1:05:31] and carry on when the music is beating
[1:05:34] my but when the music stops beating or
[1:05:38] the beatniks uh beatnik music some of
[1:05:41] them play and call it Christianity and
[1:05:43] whenever that stops all the glory is
[1:05:46] gone see I like this statement if it's a
[1:05:50] real praise
[1:05:53] Hallelujah somebody if it's a real
[1:05:56] praise of God amen there isn't enough
[1:06:00] whistles and enough power in the world
[1:06:03] to stop it
[1:06:04] I I I I'm I believe this I I believe our
[1:06:08] praise don't just stop when we come in
[1:06:10] here on Sunday morning or Wednesday
[1:06:12] night our praise will follow us home
[1:06:15] Oh Glory to some glory to God you know
[1:06:17] I've been in situations sometimes where
[1:06:20] you know you're going through this and
[1:06:22] your mind bombarded with this and
[1:06:24] bombarded with that and and you just I
[1:06:26] mean the devil just just just just just
[1:06:27] just rough shot I mean running rough
[1:06:30] shot in your life but all of a sudden
[1:06:31] God will inspire you with a song
[1:06:34] amen and and when you begin to praise
[1:06:38] God in the midst of that song all of a
[1:06:41] sudden your attitude changes your shift
[1:06:44] begins to focus
[1:06:46] Hallelujah you feel like you got power
[1:06:48] over the devil your praise has released
[1:06:52] an anointing
[1:06:54] come on somebody amen there is power in
[1:06:57] your praise
[1:06:59] and you ain't even said a word of prayer
[1:07:01] you ain't even bound the devil Amen in
[1:07:04] the name of Jesus but you just begin to
[1:07:07] worship
[1:07:09] and when it's a real sincere word set
[1:07:13] ain't nothing can stop it
[1:07:15] when you're not feeling good in your
[1:07:18] body you begin to praise
[1:07:20] hey when the bills are passed do you
[1:07:23] begin to praise because you know God is
[1:07:26] gonna make a way if he'd get It Before
[1:07:30] He'll Do It Again there is power in my
[1:07:34] praise
[1:07:38] glory to God it's got to be a real
[1:07:40] praise
[1:07:43] Hallelujah
[1:07:45] amen if it's a real praise of God
[1:07:48] there isn't enough whistles enough power
[1:07:51] in the world to stop it
[1:07:53] when it really comes from God it don't
[1:07:56] take music
[1:07:58] to be beat up
[1:08:01] I'm telling when it's a real praise that
[1:08:03] you already got the music on the inside
[1:08:05] of you
[1:08:06] you already got your own beat in the
[1:08:08] inside of you
[1:08:10] Hallelujah
[1:08:11] amen and don't take music to beat it up
[1:08:14] it takes the spirit of God to come down
[1:08:17] on it and that's what does it
[1:08:20] he said they long forgot it because
[1:08:23] they've classed the gift of the Holy
[1:08:25] Ghost initial evidence of speaking in
[1:08:27] tongues and I heard devils and witches
[1:08:29] speak in tongues says the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:32] the word of God in you
[1:08:34] that identifies Itself by accepting that
[1:08:38] word outside of that it can't be the
[1:08:41] Holy Ghost
[1:08:42] if it says it's the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:44] denies one word of the Bible it cannot
[1:08:48] be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence
[1:08:49] whether you believe or not
[1:08:52] Hallelujah so real praise would be
[1:08:54] anointed by the spirit it'll Quicken the
[1:08:57] word that's already in you and that that
[1:08:59] that there just begins to change
[1:09:01] situations and circumstances that you're
[1:09:03] going through I I um I was reminded of
[1:09:07] uh a couple times or once once a couple
[1:09:10] of instances where we just Just Praise
[1:09:13] change atmospheres
[1:09:15] and one time we were at Pinnacle palms
[1:09:17] and uh we were there just worshiping and
[1:09:19] you know and and we didn't even have
[1:09:21] music sometimes you know we would have
[1:09:23] it but as as the years uh developed a
[1:09:26] man uh musicians just wanted to go and
[1:09:28] not have to worry about playing that's
[1:09:30] fine amen but uh but we were saying in
[1:09:33] our in the melody and and you know just
[1:09:35] just just the worshiping song If it was
[1:09:38] create an atmosphere and I remember
[1:09:40] there was a lady walked up to the
[1:09:42] mailbox she didn't even know he was in
[1:09:44] there but you know usually they would
[1:09:46] use that room to play uh games and all
[1:09:48] kind of things like that but she walked
[1:09:49] up to the mailbox and outside the door
[1:09:52] she just hear amen the the the the
[1:09:55] singing of the songs and feel the
[1:09:57] presence of God should say I got to go
[1:09:59] in there and something pulled that lady
[1:10:01] from the outside hallelujah amen right
[1:10:04] into the inside it was the praise that
[1:10:08] created the atmosphere
[1:10:11] do you realize when we created an
[1:10:13] atmosphere and here with our Praises
[1:10:15] this is this is an opportunity for the
[1:10:17] shackles to be broken
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:21] you people coming here in shackles
[1:10:23] people come in here in bondage but when
[1:10:26] we get into when we begin to praise God
[1:10:29] I'm talking about a real Prince it's an
[1:10:31] opportunity for the shackles to be
[1:10:34] broken
[1:10:36] they don't have to leave here the same
[1:10:38] way they came praise can change any
[1:10:41] situation
[1:10:43] remember we were just at the old church
[1:10:45] and and and we here we down in a corner
[1:10:48] having a service and a lady was in in
[1:10:50] Dollar General and somehow she heard it
[1:10:53] all the way down in Dollar General and
[1:10:56] just hearing the worship because of to
[1:10:58] come and open up the door and she sat
[1:11:00] down inside the presence of the Lord and
[1:11:02] just really got a got got what she
[1:11:04] needed from God Amen praise this changes
[1:11:08] people's atmospheres
[1:11:10] oh Hallelujah glory to God hear this
[1:11:14] message show us the father and it will
[1:11:16] satisfy us brother Brandon makes a
[1:11:19] statement here

[1:14:08] thanks to God for giving it to you it'll
[1:14:11] grow into a tree or whatever the seed
[1:14:13] represents healing salvation whatever is
[1:14:17] for that tree will blossom
[1:14:21] through your praises
[1:14:23] but you've got to drink you got to water
[1:14:26] it feed it let it grow amen and the more
[1:14:30] you trust in God if you're in a
[1:14:32] wheelchair and in the hospital and
[1:14:35] you're so paralyzed you can't even move
[1:14:37] but one finger just keep moving that one
[1:14:40] finger to the glory of God

[1:14:45] hand
[1:14:47] the next day you'll move your arm praise
[1:14:51] God and you'll be moving on pretty soon
[1:14:52] if you'll just keep watering it pushing
[1:14:56] out growing getting bigger and bigger
[1:14:58] take God's word it's a seed certainly
[1:15:01] it's a seed look at this says God gave
[1:15:04] Abraham a promise as we've been studying
[1:15:07] Abraham let that seed get into his heart
[1:15:09] the promise and kept wording it with
[1:15:12] praises and Thanksgiving to God for the
[1:15:15] child and waited 25 years but the tree
[1:15:17] came forth just the same because he
[1:15:19] watered it with faith
[1:15:21] I like that let's just uh catch this
[1:15:24] over here in Romans 4 when he makes a
[1:15:27] statement about Abraham Romans 4 17 is
[1:15:31] where this is being a a pull from
[1:15:36] and and I like this you know no longer
[1:15:38] how no matter how long we have to wait
[1:15:42] we just keep watering it
[1:15:44] and you know just uh I was thinking uh I
[1:15:47] believe I saw sister Naomi uh post
[1:15:50] something there on social media about uh
[1:15:53] uh every eight years
[1:15:55] there's a new beginning and I believe
[1:15:58] that they were uh they got the house
[1:16:01] there in um in Palm Bay Area eight years
[1:16:04] ago
[1:16:05] and how uh how perfect God is that in
[1:16:09] the eighth month
[1:16:11] of the eighth year
[1:16:14] that they would get a closing
[1:16:17] because it's time for a new beginning
[1:16:21] that's the God we serve but while we
[1:16:23] waiting we got to learn the praise
[1:16:26] and this is a rebuke to me because I'm
[1:16:30] not looking for other things that we got
[1:16:31] that we got to find something this is
[1:16:32] not our home I feel like we got to get
[1:16:34] out of here soon
[1:16:36] amen and I'm I'm ready for God to open
[1:16:39] up that next channel that church and
[1:16:41] that school
[1:16:42] because the glory of owning gonna be
[1:16:44] greater than renting we don't want to
[1:16:46] rent again we want our own Lord
[1:16:50] hey I'm I'm under the 40-day prophecy
[1:16:56] I'm on to the 40-day prophecy and I've
[1:16:59] been watching God do things here amen
[1:17:02] and in this 40 days and uh uh there's a
[1:17:05] number of saints got blessed with cars
[1:17:08] right amen how's this being a soul
[1:17:12] glory to God uh uh brother and and
[1:17:15] sister Robles uh just about seven years
[1:17:18] almost seven years had the opportunity
[1:17:20] to return back here
[1:17:22] all this happened and they have been
[1:17:24] waiting a long time to get that house so
[1:17:26] and God sent a doctor
[1:17:29] amen that not just by the house but I'ma
[1:17:32] buy you a car
[1:17:35] and it forced them to have to buy a new
[1:17:37] car
[1:17:38] God know how to do things
[1:17:40] these are some of the blessings that

[1:19:53] thank you for the new church and for the
[1:19:55] school
[1:19:56] glory to God
[1:20:02] I just began to think on all these
[1:20:04] things that the Lord's been doing and
[1:20:05] say you know we and we don't want to
[1:20:07] miss this God is moving in this season
[1:20:10] and I just want to be involved with
[1:20:12] everything God's doing I'm in on this 40
[1:20:14] days
[1:20:16] I think we got to go to September 3rd
[1:20:18] expect anything
[1:20:21] expect anything before September 3rd
[1:20:26] Hallelujah
[1:20:28] glory to God
[1:20:30] let me read this amen this he said this
[1:20:32] uh God gave Abraham a promise
[1:20:36] and Abraham let that sea uh get into his
[1:20:39] heart and kept watering with praises and
[1:20:41] Thanksgiving to God for the child and
[1:20:43] waited 25 years but the tree came forth
[1:20:45] just the same because he wore it with
[1:20:46] faith and this is out of Romans 4 17 as
[1:20:50] it is written I have made thee father of
[1:20:52] many nations and this man had no
[1:20:54] children
[1:20:55] but I've made thee God is already
[1:20:57] looking at what he's already made you
[1:20:58] don't look at what you are what you got
[1:21:00] right now hey look at what God has
[1:21:02] already done for you
[1:21:03] as a reason I have made your father many
[1:21:06] nations before him who hath uh whom he
[1:21:09] believed even God who quickeneth the
[1:21:11] dead and calleth those things which be
[1:21:14] not a glory to God as though they were
[1:21:19] look who against hope
[1:21:22] uh I Feel Jesus
[1:21:26] it's against hope
[1:21:27] oh my God
[1:21:29] hey
[1:21:31] oh God I'm so glad that we got
[1:21:35] testimonies already in our midst
[1:21:37] amen you know and God God
[1:21:40] um when I told y'all a few weeks ago
[1:21:42] that people say well somebody else
[1:21:43] already put a cash offer in and and and
[1:21:46] I say well so they said that I just
[1:21:48] thought about sister Nelly and brother
[1:21:50] Calvin I said they had the same
[1:21:52] situation and God manifested himself
[1:21:56] I said God you got to do it for us and I
[1:21:59] said even when you're against hope look
[1:22:01] at what Abraham did and to see to
[1:22:03] Abraham does the same thing we they say
[1:22:06] who would give so believed in Hope
[1:22:08] all right that he might become the
[1:22:10] father of many nations look at this
[1:22:12] according to that which was spoken so
[1:22:15] shall thy seed be all right and being
[1:22:18] not weak in faith
[1:22:21] he consented not his own body now dead
[1:22:25] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:22:27] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:22:29] now this this this is uh again a very
[1:22:33] challenging statement if you read your
[1:22:35] Bible and you read the story of Abraham
[1:22:38] you can see this man was very weak in
[1:22:42] faith
[1:22:43] and what I would consider Faith this man
[1:22:47] was giving up his wife twice
[1:22:51] and you're gonna and but this this is
[1:22:53] what I like about it hey Hallelujah
[1:22:57] you can't look at yourself the way you
[1:23:02] see yourself
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:05] you have to look at yourself the way God
[1:23:09] sees you and what God wrote about
[1:23:11] Abraham is that he was not weak in faith
[1:23:17] he consider not his own body amen now
[1:23:21] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:23:22] old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:23:24] womb he staggered not
[1:23:28] the man gave his wife up twice but God
[1:23:31] said about Abraham he staggered not
[1:23:35] A Hallelujah at the promises of God
[1:23:38] through unbelief and was but was strong
[1:23:41] and faith-giving glory to God and this
[1:23:44] is the part that I think we need to
[1:23:46] catch in in in in our faith now let's
[1:23:49] just add to our faith some praises
[1:23:51] that's it it's a matter of reasons some
[1:23:54] thank you Jesus
[1:23:56] amen amen thanking them for what's
[1:23:59] already been done
[1:24:02] every promise he made is yeah and amen
[1:24:04] not one gonna fail
[1:24:05] amen y'all get ready get ready I'm
[1:24:07] giving y'all a new address soon
[1:24:09] I'm gonna give you a new address soon
[1:24:11] don't miss it I'ma update the Church
[1:24:14] website with a new address soon
[1:24:18] yeah Hallelujah
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:24] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:24:27] had promised he was able also to perform
[1:24:31] now I might not be able to get it done
[1:24:33] but God can
[1:24:35] the Earth is the Lord and the fullness
[1:24:37] thereof the world and they that's
[1:24:39] weather in
[1:24:41] glory to God and therefore was imputed
[1:24:43] to him for righteousness so here we see
[1:24:46] how Abraham responded in the midst of
[1:24:49] him waiting praise God the Bible says
[1:24:52] stagger not at the promise of God
[1:24:54] through unbelief but he was strong in
[1:24:55] faith giving glory to God he was
[1:24:56] praising God Amen as he was making
[1:24:59] preparation he was praising God that's
[1:25:02] the way we want to be I was just moved
[1:25:05] by this uh this word praise it just
[1:25:08] really just just just begin to stand out
[1:25:11] to me and I went to my some Bible
[1:25:14] software I got called aluminum and I
[1:25:16] just put in it got different definitions
[1:25:18] for the word praise and and they uh they
[1:25:21] said praise
[1:25:23] is giving thanks to God for who he is
[1:25:29] oh my praise is giving thanks to God for
[1:25:34] who he is and I love this it says praise
[1:25:37] is saying thank you for each aspect of
[1:25:40] his divine nature
[1:25:42] our inward attitude becomes an outward
[1:25:45] expression
[1:25:46] when we praise God we help ourself by
[1:25:51] expanding our awareness of who he is
[1:25:56] right I mean so so I like like sometimes
[1:25:58] you can start praising them for what
[1:26:00] he's done for you in the past God you
[1:26:03] touched me before
[1:26:04] and I know that you're the same
[1:26:06] yesterday today and forever if you hear
[1:26:08] me before then I know you can hear me
[1:26:10] again
[1:26:10] and here's another thing it's not only I
[1:26:13] know you can I I need to change my
[1:26:16] vocabulary not that I know you can heal
[1:26:19] me again I know you will heal me again
[1:26:25] Lord help me change my vocabulary
[1:26:30] no if you did it before you will do it
[1:26:33] again because you can't fail
[1:26:38] glory to God Amen it's helped expand our
[1:26:42] awareness of who he is
[1:26:44] my God my God they said in each Psalm
[1:26:47] you read look for an attribute or
[1:26:50] characteristic of God for which you can
[1:26:52] thank him
[1:26:54] so when you start reading through the
[1:26:56] book of Psalms and we're gonna we're
[1:26:57] gonna pull some scriptures in a second
[1:26:59] out of the book of Psalms hallelujah
[1:27:01] amen we begin to thank him for who he is
[1:27:05] amen another thing you know I just I
[1:27:07] just kind of uh
[1:27:09] uh uh I I I put this amen this next
[1:27:12] little statement that they said praise
[1:27:14] is a spiritual offering
[1:27:17] praise what is praise praise is a
[1:27:19] spiritual offering oh and I just love
[1:27:22] this amen I love this there was a
[1:27:25] scripture that came uh to me uh while I
[1:27:28] was just looking at this in this Psalm
[1:27:30] 34 verse 1 through 3. amen it says uh oh
[1:27:34] magnify the Lord with me
[1:27:37] let us exalt his name together
[1:27:41] hallelujah amen uh and and what's the uh
[1:27:45] uh start at verse one I'm sorry go back
[1:27:49] to verse one on that uh I will bless the
[1:27:52] Lord at all times
[1:27:53] look at that his praise
[1:27:56] shall continually be in my mouth when I
[1:28:00] ain't feeling good his praise gonna be
[1:28:02] in my mouth when I am feeling good his
[1:28:05] praise still gonna be in my mouth it
[1:28:07] don't matter what I'm going through his
[1:28:08] praise gonna be in my mouth amen uh the
[1:28:11] next verse says uh glory to God it says
[1:28:14] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[1:28:16] The Humble share hear theof and be glad
[1:28:19] and here in verse 3 says o magnify the
[1:28:22] Lord with me let us exalt his name
[1:28:23] together
[1:28:24] now I I thought about that because uh
[1:28:27] the the little uh story of the Belgian
[1:28:30] horses came back to me and they talked
[1:28:33] about the Belgian horses how these are
[1:28:35] really big strong animals and they they
[1:28:37] use them to pull concrete especially in
[1:28:39] in in in in the War uh one of the wars
[1:28:42] they would use them to build the the
[1:28:43] walls and things like that they were
[1:28:44] they were pulling concrete and I said
[1:28:46] one horse could pull up to 8 000 pounds
[1:28:49] by himself
[1:28:50] amen strong horse and then they would
[1:28:53] try to put two horses together he says
[1:28:55] now when two horses were working
[1:28:57] together as a team
[1:29:00] glory to God you would think that these
[1:29:03] two horses working together as a team
[1:29:04] would pull 16 000 pounds but when
[1:29:08] they're working together as a team they
[1:29:10] do three times their strength
[1:29:13] amen they pulled twenty four thousand
[1:29:15] pounds
[1:29:16] glory to God it keeps magnifying as
[1:29:19] another horse is at it amen and this is
[1:29:21] what this is what I'm saying I can
[1:29:23] praise them by myself
[1:29:25] but when I can get you to join with me
[1:29:28] when we could come here together we'll
[1:29:30] put more demos on the Run than we
[1:29:32] thought just through our praise
[1:29:38] pray sometimes there's a spiritual
[1:29:40] offering
[1:29:43] it's not easy always to praise God
[1:29:46] I think about job and it wasn't easy for
[1:29:48] job to praise God
[1:29:50] there he was you know they told him
[1:29:52] about his oxen and his donkeys his sheep
[1:29:55] his camels and eventually his children
[1:29:57] had a storm came and destroyed of a
[1:30:00] house where his children were living and
[1:30:02] even took his children
[1:30:03] amen job I love his response because
[1:30:06] it's something that I believe all of us
[1:30:08] amen ought to learn how to do we ought
[1:30:10] to get get get get get strength from
[1:30:12] what job did job in Job 1 verse 20 and
[1:30:16] up through 22 it says then jobber Rose
[1:30:18] after he got all the bad news rent his
[1:30:21] mantle saved his head fell down upon the
[1:30:25] ground and the Bible says this and
[1:30:28] worshiped
[1:30:29] in the midst of everything he was going
[1:30:31] through he began to worship he began to
[1:30:33] praise God and he said naked came out of
[1:30:36] my mother's womb and naked shall I
[1:30:38] return this look at this in verse 22.
[1:30:41] it's I'm in verse verse 21 the lord gave
[1:30:44] and the Lord have taken away blessed be
[1:30:45] the name of the Lord that was his praise
[1:30:48] no matter what I'm going through amen
[1:30:51] I'm still going to worship God
[1:30:54] I'm a praise God
[1:30:57] here this other statement that they made
[1:30:59] in Illumina said praise is focusing our
[1:31:02] heart
[1:31:03] on God
[1:31:05] praise is focusing our heart on God now
[1:31:09] now they they uh they took an example
[1:31:11] from the last five Psalms Psalm 4 146
[1:31:15] 147 148 149 and 150. and I want to just
[1:31:20] take a few scriptures you know out of
[1:31:21] that here's uh here's some of the
[1:31:23] statements that they made said praise
[1:31:26] um uh the last five Psalms of filled
[1:31:28] with praise each begins and ends with
[1:31:32] praise the Lord
[1:31:34] so maybe we should try to do some of
[1:31:36] that start the day with a praise the
[1:31:38] Lord
[1:31:39] end the day with another praise the Lord
[1:31:42] wake up in the morning with another
[1:31:43] praise the Lord
[1:31:46] just because I got out my pants
[1:31:49] praise the Lord I got strength in my
[1:31:52] feet
[1:31:53] praise the Lord I can still lift my
[1:31:55] hands praise the Lord I got a voice that
[1:31:58] I can raise praise the Lord I got a car
[1:32:01] that I can get into praise the Lord I
[1:32:04] got a house I got a roof over my head
[1:32:06] praise the Lord my bills are paid
[1:32:09] come on somebody we got so much to
[1:32:12] praise God for
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:17] start with a praise the Lord end with a
[1:32:20] praise the Lord
[1:32:23] so they show us where why and how to
[1:32:26] praise God these Psalms show us where
[1:32:29] why and how to praise God
[1:32:31] what what does praise do the question it
[1:32:34] says praise takes our minds of our
[1:32:37] problems and shortcomings and focuses
[1:32:40] them on God
[1:32:42] praise leads us from Individual
[1:32:45] meditation to corporate worship
[1:32:51] see I mean just when I just begin oh the
[1:32:54] song say when I think
[1:32:55] of the goodness of Jesus
[1:32:58] and all he's done for me my soul Cries
[1:33:01] Out Hallelujah
[1:33:03] and I'ma tell you when I begin to praise
[1:33:06] it gets contagious next thing you know
[1:33:09] you begin to praise and we end up in
[1:33:11] corporate worship and we driving Devils
[1:33:14] out with our praise
[1:33:21] another thing they say praise causes us
[1:33:23] to consider and appreciate God's
[1:33:26] character
[1:33:27] and I love this praise lifts our
[1:33:30] perspective from the Earthly to the
[1:33:32] heavenly
[1:33:35] let's read a couple of these uh verses
[1:33:37] here out of out of Psalms 146 147 148
[1:33:41] 149.
[1:33:43] amen I I was trying to cut some of it
[1:33:45] down but someone I got to read all of it
[1:33:48] because it's just it's just that good
[1:33:51] all right hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:33:56] here in Psalms 146 just a couple verses
[1:33:59] um uh David says praise ye the Lord
[1:34:04] praise the Lord oh my soul
[1:34:07] amen that not just on your flesh but
[1:34:10] your soul
[1:34:11] right says while I live
[1:34:14] will I praise the Lord while I sit I
[1:34:18] will sing praises unto my God while I
[1:34:21] have any being
[1:34:24] I'm gonna stop there because that just
[1:34:26] just this week a precious brother sent
[1:34:29] out a text
[1:34:30] and um
[1:34:32] while I'm thinking about that if I
[1:34:34] forget to do this there was another
[1:34:35] sister they've been asking prayer for
[1:34:37] she just had a baby up there in Virginia
[1:34:39] and uh after the baby
[1:34:42] um had some major complications and they
[1:34:44] were talking about taking her life and
[1:34:46] all of that they just didn't know what
[1:34:47] to do but right now I think she is
[1:34:49] breathing again on her own but they
[1:34:51] still have some uh
[1:34:54] they have a ways to go
[1:34:59] yep you know what let's let's let me
[1:35:02] stop and pray
[1:35:04] amen father we come before your presence
[1:35:07] for sister Solis uh they they requested
[1:35:09] prayer and God we want to thank you for
[1:35:11] touching our sister
[1:35:13] oh God we know that you are the Healer
[1:35:16] amen and even as I was reading a little
[1:35:18] early brother Branham said that even if
[1:35:20] they have to set this and set that or
[1:35:22] whatever you still the one that heals
[1:35:24] and God we're asking that you would just
[1:35:25] intervene we've seen your hand thus far

[1:35:31] to be here to raise a child and a
[1:35:33] husband standing there by by her side I
[1:35:35] pray that you would touch it even right
[1:35:37] now we send your word because you said
[1:35:39] you sent your word to heal so we send
[1:35:40] your word to Virginia claiming that you
[1:35:42] were wounded for transgressions Bruce
[1:35:44] for her iniquities and chastisement of
[1:35:46] her peace is upon you with your stripes
[1:35:47] we declare healing so in between her and
[1:35:49] her condition we place the blood of the
[1:35:51] Lord Jesus amen and we pray in the
[1:35:54] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:57] amen
[1:36:00] the glory to God
[1:36:03] Hallelujah one time I did that at a
[1:36:06] service I don't remember where it was
[1:36:08] but I was we were in a service and right
[1:36:10] in the middle of the sermon I stopped
[1:36:11] and I prayed for somebody like that that
[1:36:13] was away uh some other city and I
[1:36:16] stopped and pray that person reached out
[1:36:18] to me uh late uh a few months ago and
[1:36:21] said you know when you did that I won't
[1:36:22] let you know that my daughter's uh well
[1:36:25] now she's doing much better
[1:36:27] much better God God does these things
[1:36:30] last I got a testimony last week while I
[1:36:34] was there in um in Ohio I was there last
[1:36:36] last year and I preached and there was a
[1:36:38] young lady that had a really really bad
[1:36:39] condition like I don't even remember all
[1:36:41] the things that she had uh but uh but
[1:36:44] she uh very young lady and she came to
[1:36:46] me this time she said brother Jack I
[1:36:47] don't know if you remember me but uh
[1:36:49] last time you came and you prayed for me

[1:36:53] medication and they could understand how
[1:36:55] did I get better after stop taking the
[1:36:57] medication but I'm I'm perfectly well
[1:36:59] and this is the results of my past that
[1:37:01] shows that I'm well
[1:37:03] God is answering prayer
[1:37:06] I'm trying to get somewhere
[1:37:08] I'm trying to get somewhere but I know
[1:37:11] God is moving while I was in Ohio this
[1:37:14] time praise God I got a call from a
[1:37:17] sister and I and I and I when I got the
[1:37:19] car said oh my I wonder what she needs
[1:37:21] and I told my wife I got to call this
[1:37:22] sister back you know because she needs
[1:37:24] something and uh so the sister called me
[1:37:26] and she says uh brother Jack
[1:37:28] um I just wanted to let you know I
[1:37:30] didn't get a chance to make it to the
[1:37:31] meetings you know that you all had they
[1:37:33] were brother brother Gwen and the Saints
[1:37:34] from uh London I didn't get a chance to
[1:37:37] make the meetings she says uh but
[1:37:40] um uh I was uh
[1:37:42] I was listening to the sermons and I was
[1:37:45] listening to the services and I was just
[1:37:46] really blessed just listening to them
[1:37:48] streaming them you know well actually
[1:37:49] she went back and and caught the the
[1:37:51] recordings so I was listening to him and
[1:37:54] and our brother Gwen and began to talk
[1:37:55] about a uh a sister that had been prayed
[1:38:00] for by a brother from Zimbabwe they
[1:38:02] called a brother from Zimbabwe and this
[1:38:04] sister had cancer and uh and and brother
[1:38:06] Gwen began to tell how to how the
[1:38:08] brother prayed and how God delivered
[1:38:10] that sister from cancer she said brother
[1:38:12] Jack the reason that struck me is
[1:38:15] because I went and I was uh told by the
[1:38:18] doctor that they seen something abnormal
[1:38:20] and and what happened is that they began
[1:38:22] to make all kind of arrangements for me
[1:38:25] to do this to do that and do and I had
[1:38:27] never even agreed to any of these things
[1:38:28] I told him and said she said I told him
[1:38:31] I respect what you do as a doctor I
[1:38:33] understand say but I am a Christian and
[1:38:35] I know God is able to heal
[1:38:38] so so just give me a little time just to
[1:38:41] kind of process this and as she was
[1:38:43] talking to say well you know and as as
[1:38:44] she was saying I remember Sister Tanya's
[1:38:47] testimony I began to share about sister
[1:38:48] times testimony and as I'm sharing that
[1:38:50] last weekend since it's Tanya's standing
[1:38:52] here sharing her testimony
[1:38:55] all right I mean so so I was just
[1:38:57] telling the sister and encourage us that
[1:38:58] we've seen God do it you know she wanted
[1:39:00] to wait till after she was prayed for
[1:39:03] before she would go on with anything the
[1:39:05] doctor I'd say our sister did the same
[1:39:07] thing my sister-in-law she did the same
[1:39:09] thing and God manifested himself I know
[1:39:11] he's the same yesterday that damn family
[1:39:14] I say so she said she'll say what I'm
[1:39:16] calling you for brother Jack is because
[1:39:17] I felt that maybe it just it just struck
[1:39:20] My Heart by four o'clock and once you
[1:39:22] said if I can just call Brother Jack
[1:39:23] maybe he can call the call brother
[1:39:26] gwinner and maybe he can get the number
[1:39:27] to the brother and and uh in in Africa
[1:39:30] and maybe that brother can pray for me
[1:39:32] she said I want to exhaust every one of
[1:39:34] my resources
[1:39:39] before before I let them touch me like
[1:39:42] that
[1:39:42] so so I you know I was going through the
[1:39:45] week going through the week and I and I
[1:39:46] got Brothers grim and he gave me the
[1:39:49] number and I got in touch with brother

[1:55:52] somebody picked up on the organ so what
[1:55:54] I did when I you'll see on the video I
[1:55:56] turned to look back and say who in the
[1:55:58] world is playing that okay it was
[1:56:00] brother Kenny over there said Lord have
[1:56:01] mercy man and man and man and they just
[1:56:04] you know then the whole congregation
[1:56:05] just kind of got into it just began to
[1:56:07] enter into that little that little time
[1:56:08] of worship and and um and and the Lord
[1:56:11] just kind of inspired on the spot said
[1:56:12] maybe the reason we haven't seen
[1:56:14] victories in our life is because we're
[1:56:16] the ones still fighting
[1:56:18] foreign
[1:56:19] but the scriptures say The Battle
[1:56:21] Belongs to the Lord
[1:56:22] [Applause]
[1:56:24] so rather than fight
[1:56:26] praise
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:32] praise it's already done
[1:56:34] it's already worked out he already
