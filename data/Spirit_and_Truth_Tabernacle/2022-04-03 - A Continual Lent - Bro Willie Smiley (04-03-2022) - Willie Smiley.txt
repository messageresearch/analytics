is that all right amen i cannot be the best anything nor have the best of everything sometimes i think that i'm least of all [Music] i am happy just to know that i'm his child amen amen turn me down just a little bit amen let's just get our bibles out this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord it's good to be home uh this morning amen last week we were way up in milton florida man it's almost all day drive it's good to have our visitors with us also this morning and we had a real wonderful time and the saints up there bring says their greetings and let's remember brother jack and the saints brother troy told me uh he preaching the house down we're going to be looking in the book of matthew chapter 16 in second timothy chapter 3. so let's remember him in prayer this morning just continue to pray for the service this morning and we just want to trust that the holy spirit helped me to get out of the way i was kind of undecided on what i wanted to preach this morning i had something that i thought i would preach but you know you just want to follow the leading of the spirit uh saint matthew chapter 16 we want to read the 24th and maybe the 25th verse it says then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it and let us go to second timothy chapter three um we want to start at the first verse it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captives silly women laden with sins led away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth let us just buy his gracious father we just thank you this morning for just allowing us to be here once again and uh we report for duty and uh we just trust that you open our mouths to the things that you desire to be said and to the things that you don't want to be said lord we don't want to say it lord my brother jack was saying the other night it was things that he thought about saying and he felt checked so uh we we're just here to just try to be uh a blessing and and help the people to come to this place of maturity that uh brother jack's been preaching on in his series so we're just trusting and depending on you that's when it's all said and done you can get the glory and the honor for what in jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh this morning i i just like to use as a little title to i thought um a continual lent and uh maybe as a context uh religious versus true christianity we we realized that we we're in in the season of uh of lent uh which is from march the second up until about april the 14th and um i'm i'm kind of going to just lay a foundation and kind of move forward and then kind of have to backtrack because of some things that i kind of want to uh just get out nothing just something just to help us i think as as christians um um we don't we one of the things that we don't want to be and i'm not a traditionalist i don't i don't do tradition you know growing up in church and around church you know we saw a lot of tradition even when jesus came on the scene uh he rebuked the people because it was so much tradition going on and not so much word and and and uh we we we don't want to be religious this this is the date according to uh uh ii timothy the spirit of the day is this where people are headed high-minded and just all of these other types of spirits but the the most important thing is that people have a form of godliness but but they they denying the power uh thereof that people people in in this age that we're living in they're turning away from actual scriptures and and what we find is that they're bringing in their their own perspectives in their own opinions and things of that nature and and what what we we find um in going back to genesis which we know uh genesis is the seed chapter of the bible can i get a witness this morning genesis is the seed chapter of the bible and the prophet he makes the statement in his teaching he said he he talked about the things that that started out way back then he said you could find the spirit of these things all the way back to genesis is that right because when we look back to genesis i like to work from genesis brother branham he talked about he go from genesis to revelation and keep going but but we we find uh the true perspective of god when you go back to genesis god's first and perfect act the first uh first and perfect church we can see the divine order and all of those different things when we go back to genesis right uh then we we see fallacy we see all of these things when they come in said right after the fall from the start initially we see perfection i love perfection church i love i love perfection we're gonna go somewhere this morning i hope y'all come to have church this morning i hope y'all didn't come to just look at me instead man and get scared relax everybody take a deep breath this morning y'all look a little tight y'all make me nervous lord have mercy i was telling brother choi man i i used to didn't be afraid to preach but folks started to make me nervous about preaching you get you get to talking and people get offended and we we get all of that it make me just want to see that back cone over there and let the rest of the brothers let the rest of the brothers have it but cause i'm different y'all ought to know that by now i've been here a year and i just i just like to say what's on my heart and sometimes it hurt my feelings but but i think if if it's medicine and it don't taste good it'll do us good say right because i don't know about you you know i i grew up a certain way i grew up i grew up going to the baptist church i i grew up going to pentecostal church and and when i study scripture even when we go back to the new testament church in in at the book of acts right we didn't have all of this all we had was one lord one faith and one baptism is that right but but but something's definitely got to be wrong because we got about 900 a thousand different denominations a lot of different names and i think brother jack alluded to this the other day he was saying what happens is this person get mad at the pastor's preaching y'all don't talk to me i guess i'm gonna have to pull y'all we this one get mad and then he decides well i'm gonna go stop me something over here because if if it's true the bible said blessing is he that's not offended in me so so you cannot be offended at the word if you're a true believer as a true believer you can only say amen to the word of god so be it glory to his wonderful name so when we look at genesis what we we we find we find truth we we find the mind of god on display we find the perfect the perfect church and a oneness and harmony but then but then watch this uh uh satan comes in in the church here here's where the problem started right the church stopped and opened up the wound of their mind to uh accept seed that was not originally given by god right what was given by god was that day you eat there of that day you die we're gonna go somewhere y'all keep praying for him right that was the original uh thought of god right back in genesis but then the serpent right begow e he said well you know they was having conversation listen i'll tell you something you'll never win a reasoning battle with the devil that's right right but we do it we try to reason things and reason this and reason that see one of the things and we might read it i might quote it and keep going see the the devil chose the head the intellect god chose the heart right you we can never out think the devil as far as as far as reasoning is concerned it's it takes god to quicken the revelation of the word of god to us if it's not quick and you do not get it right right you can study study study study study study study study study study study study study study you won't get it until god reveal it i was thinking all week because i wanted to preach on something else and i was just thinking about when we look at scripture scriptures is like an onion right it's it's just so many layers so many layers and sometimes i think that you know uh we need to keep peeling back and peeling back so that we can get the true fullness amen of this plan of redemption is that right but but we cannot approach it from an intellectual standpoint because the devil the devil chose the head the prophet he makes a statement in a little message uh called um all the days of our lives 1959. he he starts to talk about and this is where i want to start from before i kind of move a little forward to lay a foundation because you know for me i'm different right uh in the way you you start looking at things and you listen to people and you'll be like man it's so far away from god and then anything we thank god that we had a messenger to bring us back to the bible maybe y'all ain't with me this morning god we we needed somebody to bring us back to the bible because because with through traditions and things of that nature we error it won't produce faith for rapture creeds and see we needed see when jesus came on the scene you know what jesus did he just ripped down stuff he just was constantly in in his understanding of of scripture and prophecy it was constantly tearing down and and and men through denominations and creeds pharisees and sadducees that was all the time upset with christ right because his ministry was just so contrary to the things that they were doing it was word mixed with man's opinions we don't want that we don't we don't we don't you don't you don't want word mixed with brother smileys or brother jack's opinion you want pure word we want to be feeding on pure words right thank god pure word has come down in the evening time so right so that we we don't want part word part man's opinions you know part man's feelings and things of that nature cause we'll be all jacked up especially in the day that we're living in where it's crazy you you start thinking about yourself thinking about the world and and and you know all of this i these identity crisis and where where where people just don't know who they are and and what they supposed to be you know it's crazy sometimes when you listen to this this type of stuff it's it's well who are you i'm him him heard they v what i'm baffled what are you they don't they don't they they want to be man woman boy girl and all of this it's like wait a minute i know i know if you're you're a boy you start out as a kid and but but you don't somewhere your your birth as a boy and then somewhere you say god made a mistake no you just got a spirit on you that's all that is right and and and look our crazy governor i used to kind of like him man one more i'm just kind of baffled now because you can't even say uh gay now that's hate speech but we knew that it was coming right why because of the asian hour that that we that we're living in we we we're back in bible times we back in the days of noah is that right glory to god so see these things are so important for us you say wow how is that important because we still raising up children see i don't have those types of issues because i know who i am right now but but right one day i'm gonna have some grandchildren and i got nieces and nephews coming up and they're being indoctrinated by all these different perspectives y'all come on talk to me they're being indoctrinated they're being influenced by by these right since the tina's a teacher and i'm quite sure she see this type of stuff all the time and here these things and and because of outlets right these things is coming right in our our homes and everything around us where where our youth is feeding on these things and becoming what they're feeding on so so it's important for us to give the people truth right see it's easy just to put preach some religious something that makes us feel i know how to make you feel good is that right but but what happens when when when we just preach uh uh really a religious thought go back to adam adam had a religious thought after the fall he put a lot of work in the fig leaves man he oh god could you imagine picking up them leaves and putting them together and and all of that that was something he did within himself and then when when he did all of that at the end of the day when god come down and was calling for him he realized wow this ain't working that's right it it see creeds and religions is not sustainable amen say that again cause y'all missed that creeds and religion is not sustainable come on preach with me brother i preached with brother troy that's my brother over there y'all uh you and see if we don't preach the baptism of the holy ghost if we don't amen from the foundation bring the people all the way up amen to be capped then they won't be sustainable see this is why people in and out this is why people up and down this is why people ain't see you can't even be in a revival without the world it'll just be an emotional something and i don't know about you we all try on beings we all emotional but at times we don't feel like shocking in church [Music] right glory to god but amen as believers we feel like coming to church because of the baptism by the holy ghost we can't wait we can't hardly wait and when we get here we might be down in our body but amen there's a jumping going on in our soul but but it's a jumping because of the world is that right oh hallelujah you know it's it's it's uh stimulation by revelation see i like singing right i like the clapping of a hand but give me the word let let something strike in my soul brother ain't gonna make me tear up a place man a message dropped down in my heart the other day and i had to pull over to the side of the road that was wednesday night too i was pulling over writing i ain't preaching i don't know when i'll preach it right and i was like that's the thing that stirs me see that's the thing keeps me amen when emotionally i'm a wreck emotionally i'm a wreck i've been on the wall with the devil and emotionally i don't know whether i'm coming to go but but it's it's the word it's it's true right we used to sing a song back in the day something deep inside of me y'all don't know about that telling me go ahead something deep inside of me [Music] well i think we got a few old times up in here something deep inside of me [Music] go ahead it's the word deep inside of me i'm feeling good now [Applause] see it it's got to be see you know when i started studying the word of god i realized man because he come down according to revelation 10 right with an open book right to give us truth to give us a godly to produce see this thing came to produce christians that's right if we go back to the book of acts see they didn't call them baptist methodists pentecostals they didn't call them branham night they call them none of these names that we got attached to us they saw the life of christ on display and said these people are christians is that right why because they realize that these people were influenced by christ and they see that same kind of nature same kind of life manifested last week um i met a pastor from tennessee and he got up and closed and he said you know what it's not my job to to defend the message it's my job to become the message when we become the message right it shuts the critic's mouth right see because the problem of god makes a statement he said we shouldn't jump no higher than we can live we can tear up a church but how how what's your life like is your life worthy of the gospel [Applause] well praise the lord i'm gonna preach to the lights let me stop a second i'm not saying this to be offensive or anything we're not trying to uh hurt anybody's feelings but if if if we have a perspective that's contrary to scripture then we have got to get get rid of that perspective is that right because that perspective will not bring or produce a change is that right it it will not and see the prophet he he he talks about he says in in the garden of eden uh god and the devil chose their parts of the man right the devil took his head god took his heart the devil tries to show him with mental powers some great thing he can do right this is this is a lot of of of our problems all of our problems right come on preach glory to god look at watch this now come on i'm gonna preach the bible now watch the problem that they had in the days of jesus it was mental powers yes they was intellectually yes uh uh uh following jesus and and because his ministry right was just so contrary yeah right it just it just produced a fight right it produced a struggle so much so that they said you know what give us give us barabbas they would they would rather take a murderer and and destroy the revealed work come on right right look at when when jesus's ministry culminated right after three and a half years they were so frustrated that amen they said give us barabbas they was willing to take a murderer over the reveal over life david they was willing to take a murderer and rejected life rejected light on the world amen we got to be careful right come on of what what we're willing to accept see i'm not willing to accept anything that's so contrary to the world come on spirits does not die right this is what uh william branham is alluding to right going all the way back to genesis and and picking it up right and bringing it all the way down to 2022. spirits do not die people die but spirits don't die did he say it or he did did he not say that right we understand that right every spirit from that time amen has been a amen brought all the way down through seven church ages and is here in this age we had a real war church right it's worse for these children it's worse for these children than it was for me amen in my day i thought it was bad in the 1980s when i supposedly had i graduated but it's 10 times worse probably 20 times worse for these kids right because they're fighting against stuff we have no cell phones i ain't walking around with a devil in my pocket all day every day y'all don't talk to me somebody huh virginia we still had that thing on the wall that you used to have to y'all don't know nothing about that you got to at least be my age come on bro capers preach with me you know you and you had to wait for it to spin back and then we thought we were something when we got a little push button oh glory to god huh see if you like young like what in the world is he talking about yeah we used to have that little round down and you you wanted a six you put your hand in and you spin it and it had to spin back you had to wait on in a second or two and then you get your other numbers then boy oh boy when we start since the time when we got them cordless y'all all know what i'm talking about brother troy probably had his hat probably had his cordless talking to sister tanya when they was in the stages yes i just can't hardly wait huh and then they brought peoples and we thought we were something but we still had to run and find a paper a pay phone and then when and then then when they got cell phone we like we didn't arrived boy help me preach but but i'm not against the cell phone cause i ain't going nowhere without mine because there's so much access right but but it's it's the web that's on there and you need the baptism of the holy ghost i'm gonna say this and it's gonna be tightened y'all young people don't stone me when y'all get outside but y'all don't even need internet on your phones they need a phone well just give him a phone whatever because see you know you get when you get all this exposure parents can't monitor i'm teaching this morning they can't monitor because you can't be with your children all day every day but you got to try to to the best of your ability to limit the exposure [Music] but praise the lord i'm still moving how much time i got i'm still moving right sometimes you know you just got to drop these things we we got a lot of babies coming up in the church young folks having babies and and all of that you know they ain't gonna be babies always right my was babies and i thought we'd have been gone in the rapture we're still here and my youngest just turned 18. praise the lord but when justin was born we didn't have all of that stuff but now the kids they have access and and and the worst mistake that my mom made she said well you know i grew up a certain way and and and i just didn't want y'all to grow up that way so she gave us a lot of leeway don't do it i'ma give you i'm gonna give you a little bit of rope you mess that up i'm taking that little bit back you got to earn it well i'm going on somebody tell me going on i see i i am who i am you know i'ma get where i supposed to go i if not then you know it'll be another whenever we get up here we'll finish right but but it's these you know what church these things matter a lot because we we wonder why our kids are so so messed up in their mind it's it's a lot of times that little thing that they carry around in their pocket praise the lord amen but so he says uh the devil took his head great something he can do he only wants to see with his eyes what he can can see see man trying to out teach god right and god is the source of all true knowledge and wisdom right god come in his heart makes him believe the things that he can't see that's real faith for faith and successive things hope whatever this is things not yet seen he just believes it because god said it right he said because god said he don't have to do nothing or no his sister the body has to cut declared it he just believes it in his soul where god lives right he said but the devil took his head watched this statement this statement i want to get to makes him smart figure himself out a religion and a way impossible it's impossible how can we figure figure out ourselves a religion in a way apart from god who has the perspective right see this that was the problem that adam had when he tried he the prophet makes a statement he said adam couldn't wait after he had failed he couldn't wait he tried to do something within himself but he failed in it why because it took god to lead it takes god to leave do we believe that amen you cannot you cannot lead yourself right i was i was talking to brother price last weekend and and you know he he made a statement that i thought was really profound uh we we we're basically leading ourselves most often we're leading ourselves it's not god's leading i don't you know i don't have problems with a lot of things education and all of these types of things i really don't have a problem because you don't want to be illiterate we know it takes education but most often people don't try to find out what's god's leading right i'm not talking about the outside world i'm talking about people in church around church do we pray for god's will to be done in our lives or it's it's our own intellectual uh thinking our own way right and we try to make god's way and god's will coincide and it don't work it does not work it doesn't work like that right see we there's a there's a worldly caudal perspective right and and there's a perspective given to us by god there's a leading that amen because god wants to lead the problem that adam and eve had they shifted for themselves yeah right amen right see you know what when e when when the revelation came to eve why you couldn't you probably could have told eating nothing probably thought well i'm smart i got something that adam does not have i could have saw her head swell up when she brought that thing back to adam adam probably put it did one of these numbers lord have mercy what you gonna do do you like do you realize what you actually done right yeah stand it studied it started to quotes out right because because the serpent was subtle brother branham said he was a more probably handsomer guy and all of that probably made it sound good but it was dead right because it was hybriding the word with the intelligence amen of the serpent which the intelligence was coming from amen the devil right and see when you hybrid something it'll produce a bigger better crop it'll produce a bigger see sometimes we look at these big churches right and like be like my and see you know and sometimes they'll look at a little small church like this brother solomon and y'all show god with y'all y'all got 50 and we got 50 000 but you got 50 000 of what what do you have right do you have 50 000 christians on the word right from the baptism of the holy ghost to the right amen uh baptisms all the way up right right uh or do you have just religion a little covering something that that you know on sunday you don't feel so condemned for laying up in the bed just you know sleeping see we do not want to be religious right we don't want that that's what we do not want i hope it's all right if it's not y'all blame the pastor he told me to do it right but we do not want to be go back to all the days of our lives 1959 and read it we do not want to be religious right we want to be christians we do not want tradition everybody gearing up well y'all probably already got y'all easter suits ready easter dresses if you ain't got it you've been thinking about it well praise the lord somebody there's nothing wrong with that i'm just you know but that's not it right because see there'll be people brother solomon they'll go to church right and you might want to say merry christmas uh what's the next one mother's day happy mother's day right that suit polly or that dress probably won't be worn again to next year right so so we do not want to be be religious i'm i'm getting there i'm i ain't gonna hold y'all along this morning hey man we do not want to be religious right we we we do not see he said god wants to lead him in the path of worship and that's what it takes because when we look back to genesis it was god god coming down in the cool of the evening right and so adam quickly sowed fig leaves together not waiting on god think that's where we've made our mistake all along people don't wait on god if that was wrong in the beginning it's wrong now it will forever be wrong if god depends wholly upon complete surrender right to be led by the spirit at the beginning that's the way it'll have to be forever what okay let's stop a minute what's leading us just a question don't have to answer think about it when you when when you when you go home when you leave the service this morning what's leading us is it the spirit of god now i passed it 23 years i ain't just start doing this now right i ain't even intimidated this morning i just mess around sometime but i ain't intimidated i ain't i ain't even really afraid to hurt y'all feelings neither sister virginia know me very well but kevin knew they sat under me but i'm not trying to do that but i'm trying to get us a man in the hour that we're living in is it him leading or or is is it us leading us is it something that maybe brother jack said when you know and you know that we didn't like and then we started you know right we stopped following the guy come on right because soon as the pastor say something that's contrary to our leading we stop following man he ain't no man of god six weeks ago my pastor when he said when when he preached on from here to there oh we almost told this building down well i'm a total bill to die y'all don't preach with me up in here when he would breathe from it or die oh no we were we were spinning huh but the moment something said that's that's contrary to our ideology and our feeling and our intelligence and our thought bro jack boy i tell you boy bro troy and don't get me started on that brother smiling if it's the truth watch what brother jack's been preaching for weeks right the fivefold ministry has been given for the perfecting right see watch something here i'ma drop something right because because we we we we grow up a certain environments right certain cultures and and there's an ideology that's associated right you know we talked about growing up in the hood there there's concepts there's spirits things that's contrary to bible that's that's mindsets right and and and when we talk to our foes there's this things that they inject that we feed upon that's contrary to bible that's why you shouldn't talk to everybody about your problems because there's a lot of times people aren't going to give you a biblical response i want to talk to you what what god girl if i was you if i was you i'd run because they are not going to give you something amen that's biblically sound is that right come on it takes a spiritual insight into the word of god amen see there's many things that i can look back to that i still to this day got to fight because i grew up in what they call not a rock huh i grew up all over west palm beach and riviera beach if i didn't grow up i hung out but there was concepts and mentalities that i still have to amen push down right come on come on and and through you know maybe sometimes what we go through and what we fight right you it's it's a battle to stay with truth right hey man y'all know what i'm talking about let your husband and wife get into an argument then you'll find out what i'm talking about oh glory to god right because if you don't have truth you just got religion you're gonna have some problems some real problems because it's gonna take it's gonna take amen truth in the midst of a marriage to keep two people together come on amen you're gonna take biblical truth in the midst of a marriage because the devil fights marriages well i'm in the message all right all right you better get a better perspective than that the message better be in you come on right because normally opposites attract i'm different than my wife i ain't gonna go there cause y'all gonna get nervous lord have mercy i already felt that i already felt that i'm gonna leave that alone y'all think i'm crazy don't y'all huh i preach i preach in general right but the devil fights the devil fights all marriages no matter how long you've been married right glory to god glory to god and it takes a man truth to keep a man some peace in the valley because she they have she has her opinions her thoughts you have your opinions as a male right come on come on yeah we do yeah we do yeah as a male we figure got to go this way gotta go that way and she look like a little sub buster and don't let them be bringing in no coins well praise the louder they're loud don't let her be making more money than you a little bit more education let me tell you something i ain't intimidated by how smart folks are no time right because you can be intellectually smart and not worldly smart that's right that's right and that might be good to help you to keep your your bank books balanced but that that might not help you amen to navigate a man through through life and pick up certain things i thank god amen you know for my experiences and the word though the word that's right i'm weird because i look at most everything by the word right when people rejoice in having a big time smelling out things i'd be pondering it i don't know about that one right and everybody jumping around about this and now you'll be like okay maybe lord i need you to help me on that one but i i learned to keep my mouth closed about a lot of things though come on y'all all right i ain't got about 10 15 more minutes right this ain't going away i i preached it last week different right but but it's a lot it's a lot for us to chew on right uh i was i was talking i was talking to brother jack about something a couple of weeks ago and um i was saying how surface how surface i feel that we are around christendom and and there's a there's a lot that that needs to be that needs to be taught outside of certain or our favorite doctrines because because you know we you you start looking at you start looking at the young generation right uh and you just kind of have to ask yourself the question where do young where do young people yeah where where the family's at right and what what i find is happening we get caught up and we've been caught up for the last i've been a christian since 1988 and and trying to prove this and trying to prove that and there's so much lacking when when i got married man i mean it's it's it's on the job training but uh there's got to be still things that you know uh on our foundation that that we need to know i was sharing and brother jack was saying we need to bring the marriage seminars to this area right because you you finding uh because of a lack of truth yeah we got excitement we dancing right but our foundation is shaky then we we're limited in so many areas right when we got married we didn't know we didn't know nothing right we just you know saw somebody and felt like this was our wife and man we went to our dad trembling and shaking we went to the pastor and we got it worked out and we got down the island when we got in and after the honeymoon see brother that's not much of nothing i mean that is something you got to go that route but that's just the beginning stage is nice white boy i'm gonna tell you something i was clean on my wedding day what my wife was looking good we was in all white while my groom went right troy woo what yeah we all smaller we all slim i might have been brother t size back then man look at me now i'm ready for the defensive linemen or something people look at me and now say boy you playing football i said no i wasn't this big back then i played basketball back in the days when i was telling troy today i said man we were young well we we thought you was fat or whatever but bad you were slim compared to them days but you know we we grinned and we laughed and we had a good time but but then but then when we come back out for the honeymoon and we start trying to make a life all right right we did not have the information that's right come here y'all don't talk to him now we did not have the information and and and when when problems come people do not have the information right that's right and it's our job in ministry to be informative come on we have we have first got to be equipped in order to equip them for the challenges that they will face i don't care if you're a preacher deacon all the pastor the preacher what that means they get fought the most huh you have got to have the information you've got to have truth that's why amen we got to peel back the layers [Music] and make this thing holistic not just one perspective not just god sending a prophet but showing us how to be men showing how to be women somebody said uh i heard somebody saying this the average young lady don't even know how to cook 40 years old that's a shame 40 you can't cook what i remember when i got married my wife was educated but she couldn't cook i hope that don't get me in trouble but it's the truth in the house well she knows that the first the first four and a half years i cook i'm a little rusty now i've been i've been lately she go out of town i still got my two young fellas there at home and i started feeling sorry for them cause my wife treated us pretty good and i had to go in there and try to have to bring it back sister virginia i still got some skills now don't get me twisted while i was out of time well i couldn't really put me a whole baked chicken in the oven some collard greens and some yellow rice oh i still got a little skills now i have to i have to rehearse it in my mind boy what you put in this oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah huh come on sometimes as men we need to learn how to do something besides you know sit back you ain't cooked yet sometimes you know and i'm guilty praise the lord forgive me jesus i need to be able to say honey don't worry about it i got you tonight i got you tonight even ain't never the egg sandwich bring out your best you can't do nothing but i got that cat or two to fit baby i got to the diet give you some tuna fish we need some bread and lettuce and tomatoes and you know y'all why boy i grew up on stuff like that with you some some cucumbers and tomatoes on the side with a little vinegar and some sugar on it oh y'all don't know nothing about that i'm a country boy too old glory come on brother solomon huh amen sometimes we gotta learn how to take the pressure off take the pressure off [Music] huh take we got to learn these things cause the devil the devil will fight you in these areas see we look at you like i'm tired too i gotta go to work too when you don't mind yeah and then you meet what the prophet said and that's exactly what you're gonna get and he said my place supposed to be at home and i'm out here struggling too well praise the lord likes see look what the devil has done to the family i'm gonna go cause i ain't getting to where i'm gonna go i'm just a preacher i just let him yeah let him use me huh a lot of times we a lot of times because the the view and the legs ain't been we're religious it takes everything for us to get up and come to church right but there's so much that we're lacking right because when i was coming up i saw all there was a bunch of fighting over doctrine who right and who this group right and that group ain't right but but it's it's we were suffering manu mounis malnourished see creeds wasn't sustainable you go to a convention and you excited and you crying and a week later you depressed you're depressed a week later yes because you had religion you had you had creed go back to all the days of our life i i'm gonna put this up i got five minutes right when we need something that's holistic something that deals with the whole man the whole the whole woman [Applause] right because it's a lot man it'll help us it'll help us through the hard times that will come because the guns of the devil is aimed at us right this is not a picnic right amen you you want everything to see victory in homes see if we got victories in homes we'll have a victorious church but but when we got young couples struggling the church gonna struggle because because we what's happening is we got no balance and so we got to try to manufacture something i know what i'm talking about church the bible said because a house divided against itself can't stand that's right right you gotta see because we gotta come back to a oneness yes right oh loud i'll tell you what this is the day you know where people rather we'll we'll rather have religion right and and live kind of like we won't do what we want right but you won't make it into heaven like that right we we got ministry got we got the gospel so watered down it's no life right people man when i was growing up you you just didn't live any kind of life right we we know the pentecostal church was was the highest form of restoration after the word had fallen and now i see her right and god started reforming through luther that's true and then wesley and pentecost has had the restoration of the gifts with a great revival with a great revival but they still lack the word the fullness the full perspective of god oh yeah bodies was getting healed right people people were profit line and everything else but uh manufacturing gifts producing creeds and doctrines off right right and no fellowship listen let me say something that's really profound to me if the water has risen why is our attitude the way that it is because when the water rises the duck's supposed to get out and be able to fellowship right amen but but a lot of times just just look at us and our attitudes well we're in the message and they did they that that that really go back and study what brother branham tried to teach he did not try to produce amen another denomination he was bringing us back to amen the original word the original not denomination but the original experiences the original pentecost right trying to get us in position to go back to eden back to eternal life with eternal bodies right this one this is why we had to do away from just religion in this hour that we're living in i don't want to be religious i don't i don't want to approach this thing religiously i'm in the message nah nah it's got to be deeper than that this thing has got to be alive in me right because man should not live by bread alone let the musicians make their way up but by every word that proceeded out of the mouthful god it's got church has got to be every word as much as i i enjoy excitement like this morning they were feeling good i thought brother troy was gonna lift off up in here huh but i realized i you know what i might lift off for a minute but i got to come back down and when i come back down uh what i fed upon is it is it enough to sustain me yes yes let me change some church i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for truth amen [Applause] i'll say that again i would not be here this morning standing in this pulpit if it wasn't for truth huh come on cause cause in the flesh my flesh told me long time ago quick go back this day i still have to fight my flesh today tell me buddy you're a liar it's too late to go back go back to what the bridge has been burnt i'm gonna get crossed huh see this is sustainable boy i ain't getting the way i wanted to go i just had a lot this is sustainable this keeps me when i can't even keep myself this keeps me this keeps my mind in perfect peace [Music] it keeps me safe when people are losing their mind and blowing their brains out this keep my mind in perfect peace this is the thing that helps me to lay down at night and go to sleep [Music] [Applause] with my money looking funny this will keep you huh when the bills is tight and you don't know how y'all don't know nothing about that y'all got plenty of money y'all just look like y'all got plenty of money up in here huh well when it get tight huh you ever lost your job you never lost your job you're real the thing you was banking on huh it ain't there and the bills that you racked up huh y'all y'all hear brother jack's stories huh glory to god but god proves to us that this thing that you're feeding upon is sustainable it'll it'll keep you right because we we we're prone to rely i'm telling y'all something rely on god trusting god i know y'all some smart folk huh nothing wrong with that huh but there may come a time right hey man the thing that you was relying on i remember a long time ago brother jack and i think he's told that here he was working for the county boy 401k and he like he was waking up in the morning and he was just watching his full cages evaporate right huh you ever been there i ain't never been there i ain't never had no 401k i'm a construction worker they barely want to pay you huh but but i've learned i've learned god god has god has shown me some things just even in the last year pastor in the church man i knew every week brother cable was gonna have to he was gonna walk out there or leave it on my desk in the office whether i worked or didn't work i always knew god had me huh things different i'm gonna i'll be 60 years old this summer huh and and and still still got to grind things are different now but you know what i just trust in him [Applause] my bills get paid food on the table my car payment get paid ill it's sustainable i i think sometimes you know you you i look at my situation and i realize i say lord you know what the bible say all things work together for the good to them to love you to call according to your purpose right amen and and you know god allows things to happen to prove to you that i'm more than able i'm more than able to keep you i'm more than able to sustain you i'm more than able to provide for you i've never seen the righteous forsaken of seed begging bread what see that's what we gotta hold on to that ain't just a good scripture [Music] that ain't just a good scripture that's something that come on brother solomon y'all make your way somebody whoever's gonna take this this what you hold on to when you're walking through life i've never seen the righteous forsaken lord see begging bread okay right let's get a lot of hannah praise this morning let us let us stand and we'll have a word of prayer and uh y'all forgive me uh sermon didn't go to quite the way that i wanted to go it's a lot of information i got but i don't really worry about that heavenly father we just thank him we praise your god this morning we we trusted just something was was said in in our kind of scattered thoughts that that we could we could look at lord because you know i realize in this season and what you're revealing to me in this season there's there's so much that you know we have in the scriptures that we could we could look at and help to transform our lives [Music] lord i'm grateful that this word is sustainable it has the power of infallibility it's able to do everything that you said that it would do we just pray for the saints here and we just want to continue to keep it for you the things that we're looking for and brother jack and what he's testifying of the church and all of that lord uh we we we just you know just looking to the scriptures and and just holding to that in spite of what it looks like folk might be going through but you're more than able to do the exceedingly abundantly i'm a living witness to that this morning continue to open up doors continue to lead and guide your people father we'd be so careful to give you praise in jesus name amen amen [Applause] [Music] amen all the way i'm going all the way i'm going all the way single all the way i'm going all
