It's at the bottom of the screen there. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, Father, we come to you our great God and King because of who you are, Lord, and everything that you mean to us. Father, we can humbly bow our hearts and our heads before you, Lord, knowing that you are worthy, Lord. Great you are. Father, we pray for our brothers and sisters, Lord, that cannot make it to service this morning. You know the needs that they have, Lord. You know what they're going through. And if they're in church somewhere else, bless them where they are, Lord Jesus. and may the Holy Ghost fall. And Father, we have many saints that'll be traveling to Australia, Lord God. Father, you promise to be with them, even in them, no, no matter where they go, Father God. So, we trust, Father, that you'll give them traveling mercies, but we want to ask for it, Lord. That you'll keep them safe and out of harm's way, Lord. May they have no issues, no rough turbulence, Lord Jesus. Nothing to block them from meeting their next plane, Lord Jesus. May everything run smooth for them, Lord. And when the services take place, may you show up, Lord Jesus, and do what you do. You are the supernatural God, Father. And we just ask that you move mightily amongst your people. We're so grateful for your love and for your presence this morning, Lord. We ask that you would move in our midst, Lord. That you would bless our pastor, Lord, as he prepares to bring the message this morning, Lord. May you speak to him and through him to us, Lord Jesus, that we all may hear and believe, Father, that you may transform our lives. Father, we pray over our giving, Lord Jesus. Father, your people, Lord, have given according to your word. You said to bring into your storehouse. You will open the windows of heaven pour out a blessing. There wouldn't be room enough to receive it. Father, you said that you would rebuke the devourer for our sake. You said, "Give and it shall be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over men given to your bosom." Father, that's your word and we believe it, Father. Father, we're we're tired of living below our God-given privileges, Lord. Father, we're not supposed to live, Lord, as poppers here upon the earth, Lord. That's not what we're called to do. You told us, Lord, the poor would be with us always. You never said that we would be poor. So, Father, we refuse to receive these things that Satan would try to put on your believing children. Father, there should not be a person in here that lacks anything because you are the giver of all things. You will withhold no good thing from your children, Lord. So, we believe, Father, you'll meet every need that your people have both spiritually, physically, financially, domestically, materially. Everything you can bless your people with, Lord, we ask that you would shower them with it. Oh, Father, for great are your windows, Lord. how you flooded the earth with blessing with with the rain. Flower your pe shower your people with blessings. Father is our sincere prayer. Anoint our pastor, Lord God. We love you, Father. We praise you and thank you for your amazing grace. It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Your faithfulness remains. I believe that I will see the goodness of the Lord and I'm confident as seasons change your faithful ness remains. Come on, let's sing it again. Come on, stand to your feet. I believe that I will see the goodness of the Lord. And I'm confident. I'm confident. As seasons change, your faithfulness remains. Say, "God of my presence, God of my future, you write my stories. You hold it all. God of my presence, God of my future, you write my story. You hold it all. You are the alpha, my omega. You're in the middle. You hold it all. You are the alpha. You're the omega. You're in the middle. You hold it all. I believe that I will see the goodness of the Lord.

Um as you just get your Bibles, we'll read a scripture. And um just wanted to mention a couple things. those that are watching us online and and uh you know that um this is uh our borrowed home and uh so they wanted to do appreciation for the pastor and they like to decorate uh you see the picture the pastor there uh but they like to decorate for him and I say well praise the Lord that's what they do so amen uh and um we're just happy to be here. So just pray for us if you see that don't only thinking things about spirit and truth but just pray for us. Amen. That we are in a borrowed home. Amen. Pray for our new home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray. Pray and thank God in advance for our new home. Amen. Also, uh on Wednesday night, we did um find out that our sister Amanda uh lost her father uh last week. Uh and we want to remember her and her family in prayer as well as uh we do have a card uh that is there and the it's going to be on the um the the desk as you're going out the door. Please make sure you stop by and sign that card uh for her family and uh please make sure you keep them in prayer. It's not easy uh losing a loved one and uh you know we just pray that God would just give them strength during this time. Amen. Yesterday I had the opportunity to go and be there at the funeral service for Sister Anderson and they had a a wonderful uh homegoing service there um you know for her and and it was just a it was just good to be able to go represent and uh just just show brother Anderson and his family and church that we're concerned, we care. Amen. And we're uh praying for you as you go through this season. Amen. And so remember them in your prayers as well. Praise the Lord. Um so I was um at last week I was preaching a sermon on uh u miracles happen in the boat and at the very first quote start off saying uh brother Brandham saying I got all these different thoughts you know that I want to present so I have to you got to settle on one and I had a a bunch of different thoughts last week and I still got some. And um uh but there was something the Lord just kind of brought back to me in prayer. It was a sermon that I preached some years ago and I wanted to uh return to that sermon. Some of you have never heard it before. So it's going to be brand new to you. Uh but others, amen, have heard it, but you might have forgot it. So it'll still be fresh to you as well. And and uh but I want to go back. And when I got there on Friday night at uh I didn't even know they were having service at brother Anderson church, but I happened to go and the brother was preaching and my god, he walked right into some of the notes I had. So I said, "Well, that's my confirmation." And uh we'll go forward with that. So I want to ask you turn with me to the book of Joshua. Amen. Chapter 15. Praise the Lord. And um we want to uh catch verse 13 uh here out of chapter 15. Praise the Lord. Our title, amen, is um who will take the book? Amen. Who will take the book? Uh verse 13 says, "And unto Caleb, the son of Jeffa, he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, even the city of Arba, the father of Anch, which city is a Hebron." Now, uh um as we go deeper into this, you know, everything has significance in scripture. And um now what we're what we're dealing with here is Joshua dividing the land. And uh he's getting um uh Caleb is actually getting a part of the land that belongs to the tribe of Judah. All right. Caleb is getting a part of the land that belongs to the tribe of Judah. And we know that, you know, Christ uh came from that that tribe of Judah. He is the lion of the tribe of Judah. Right? So uh let's just kind of follow this in and verse 14 says and and Caleb drove then the three sons of Anoche and Ahimam tal the children of Anoch uh and these were these were giants. Now the children of Anoch were giants. These were the ones they were afraid of. They came back with a bad report. giants in the land and Caleb. Caleb, you know, we more than able, bro. We need some Calebs. Not looking at circumstances and situations. We more than able to drive these devils out. &gt;&gt; Amen. My God. And verse 15 says, he went up then to the inhabitants of Deir, and the name of Deir before was Kjath Sephir. And Caleb said, "He that smiteth Kurjath Cifir, and taketh it, to him will I give Axa, my daughter, to wife." And Ameiel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it, and he gave him Axa, his daughter, to wife. And it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field. Amen. Just ask daddy. Amen. Ask of her. Ask of her father a field. And she lighted off her ass. Now notice now you you can't ask daddy for a field if daddy ain't got no field. You can only ask people for something that you know they already got. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, your daddy got it. &gt;&gt; You just simply need to ask him for it. &gt;&gt; Ask and it shall be &gt;&gt; given. Yeah. Ask and it shall be given. Seek and ye shall find. Knock &gt;&gt; and the door will be open. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daddy got it. &gt;&gt; Uh it says um um and and she lighted off her ass. And Caleb said unto her, "What wouldest thou?" Who answered, "Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a south land. Uh give me also springs of water." And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray over the word. Father, we thank you for the ability to read the word. But we trust that the Holy Spirit would now take control over what has been read. And may you, God, just begin to minister to our hearts through this. May it be fresh revelation, God, to our hearts. And God, we ask that you would inspire us through your word, encourage us, correct us, whatever we have need of, Lord, do it uh today. And we trust, Lord Jesus, that you would just take we take control over every spirit that's against your spirit even right now. Take control of our thoughts, those that are being presented, those that are being received. God, get glory out of this portion of the service. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated in the presence of the Lord. who will take the book. Amen. Praise the Lord. I I I I I uh was just in prayer and and the Lord just kind of triggered this back into my spirit. I've preached this um a little bit ago, but the Lord brought it back to me and I said, "Well, I'll just uh touch that again." And uh the other thing is um I know I got a couple services that I'm scheduled to preach when I get to Australia, but even when I get back from Australia, um my schedule kind of picked up here at the end of the year, I got a um I'll be ministering for brother Tim Puit. Amen. Uh there in Louisiana at his church for their harvest um festival. So that'll be coming up in a few weeks in November. and then um uh have to take a trip to Ghana uh over Christmas time. So uh I got a few things and you know and you're always looking for Lord what do you want me to say because uh you know there's a lot to say. I mean there's a lot to say but it's trying to figure out what to say at that specific time. Amen. So um you know so we're just just trusting the Lord to help us and maybe this sermon will uh go to one of those places but we'll we'll see. Amen. Um so you know I I one of the things I wanted to start off by saying here is that uh the very purpose of God creating uh man is so that he could have fellowship. And um the the when he created Adam, he made a statement that it wasn't good for Adam to be alone. Praise the Lord. God himself didn't even want to be alone. But it was not good for the man to be alone. And and and what we see is that there is always amen here even the reward for who is going to take this city of Kerjath Cifa the reward the greatest reward that could be given that Caleb could think about I'm going to give my daughter. Amen. as your wife, &gt;&gt; right? And and and and and you know, and and it's something about this guy, Arthur, is like he saw that as a great prize. &gt;&gt; What? And he was willing to he was willing to go fight. Didn't matter what giants was in the way, this man was willing to go fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh you know, and so I just I I think you know what we're going to find, I'm going to read a couple quotes here, but um you know, it's always been God's uh objective for Amen. for for a man to have a wife. Amen. Especially, you know, if he was a single man, it was it was God's objective for him to have a wife because, you know, it was not good for him to be dwelling alone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's that's God's thoughts &gt;&gt; very from the very beginning. That is God's thoughts that he would have a wife. And notice now, it wasn't just that Adam would have a wife. He was speaking about himself &gt;&gt; because he was going to also have a wife. And I'm telling you, his wife hath made herself ready. She's been dressed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so it's always been in God's mind that there would be a union, you know. So, let's look at let's look at this. Amen. In um a a a sermon here. Uh God's only provided place of worship. Let me just see something. I got to make sure. Wait a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I I'll come to that. uh God's God's only provided place of worship. Uh the prophet says um the pyramid being those foundations up into the king's chamber. He says, "And just before you hit the seventh wall, it says there is a little introduction plank there where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king." And and and I like this. This brother read this quote on Friday night and and it was connecting to another quote that I wanted to read out of feast of the trumpets but but I got I took his and I wanted to bring it. Uh he says um um there there's a little introduction plank there where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king. The messenger John the Baptist that introduced to the king. Amen. But the headstone was rejected and they don't know the stone of scone or whatever it is. They don't know where uh where it's at because it's a rejected stone. But that's the stone that caps the whole thing that makes it the pyramid through the complete seven church ages. Add grace. Add this. Uh he says add this. There's seven ads. The last one is Christ which is charity. Says add this to your charity. Add grace to your grace and add something else and something else till it gets up to Christ is the headstone and I am the door. So, brother Random's kind of sharing this about this the pyramid and how they designed it. &gt;&gt; And uh and in designing it, there was seven steps to get you to the top. Hallelujah. And when you got to the the top, he said there was a a messenger that was there at the top to introduce you. Amen. Uh uh to to to I mean to introduce you to the king, to Christ, right? And uh so so when we look at this message that we have, we have come through seven steps. We come from Ephesus all the way to Leia. &gt;&gt; And when you get to the seventh step, there has to be a messenger, a prophet. Praise God. At the seventh step, and when the prophet is there, his job is to introduce you to the king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It was it was uh uh in Abraham's day, he had a he had a a a messenger. Praise God. the Eleaza. He was the messenger that went to find Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He went to find something very important for Isaac. He went to find a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let us go on a little further here. &gt;&gt; The feast of the trumpets. Brother Brandon makes a statement here. Go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps. Now, where is it at? In the prophet's chamber. Watch them seven steps. Where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king? At the top of the steps was in the seventh step. There shows that we've got to come again with the same spirit that was on John. He introduced the Messiah. He was greater than all the prophets. He introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the Messiah. Now, that's a very important quote, &gt;&gt; you know, because uh uh I think the scripture even said that, you know, there was none like John. No, no ministry like his, you know, and and brother Brandham had to break it down. He says he says until that time, &gt;&gt; right? There was none like John until that time. And the reason because because John's ministry was to introduce Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was Messiah at his first coming. But there was coming another ministry, another Elijah that would come to introduce Messiah. And he introduces Messiah on the seventh step in the Leodysian churches. He introduces Messiah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We know what we're standing on here, church. All right. He says, um, "And how will the Messiah, the people that's believeing, uh, believe in him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know that he is?" Daniel said, "The wise shall know, but the the the foolish and the unwise wouldn't know. They shall know their God." Now, it says, "Now, how shall now he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband. He's to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will the bride will know her husband and who is her husband. He says know her mate the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Your your husband your mate is the revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you're going to know him. You're going to know exactly how he thinks. You're going to know exactly how he feels by listening and reading the revealed word for your day. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He says this. He says that's why this has to happen. It wasn't in the reformers. Wasn't in Luther Wesley and the Pentecostals and them. Scripture says it wasn't, but it will come. That is his promise for this age. We're living in the age that is coming will be in. She must be identified in him. Any woman must be identified with her husband for the 2011. And how is the woman identified with her husband? She takes on his name. Her name changes to his name. So she's identified with him when she takes on his name. And we have taken on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. It says any woman must be identified with her husband for the 2011. And Christ's bride has to be identified with him for the 2011. And he is the word, not the denomination, the word. We are to be children of the light. And the light is the word which is made light for this age. How do we know light except it come from the word? All right. The word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it. Amen. And the Bible said so. All right. I'm just laying my foundation here. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. And I I I'm I'm glad that we have been introduced to the king. &gt;&gt; We've been introduced, amen, to uh the word, right? And he had and he and this word has complete rulership in our lives. Complete control. We do things because we see it in the word. The way I dress is because the word tell me to dress that way. Amen. The way I conduct myself is because the word tells me to conduct myself that way. Hallelujah. Amen. We we've been introduced to something. We thank God for it. Now, I I'm I'm um you know, certainly uh uh uh uh uh um you know, just kind of driving this point home of you know, God wanting a br a bride. And the same thing, he wants men to have that. He want He wants men to have that too, you know. So, and and when you when you get one, don't mess it up. &gt;&gt; Don't mess it up. When God give you one, don't mess it up. do everything you can to keep it because you know brother brother Brandham say the greatest thing outside of salvation. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Some of us think the greatest thing outside of salvation is our car, &gt;&gt; our house, &gt;&gt; our career. No. The greatest thing outside of salvation that God could give a man is to give him a wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, that's something. That's a powerful statement. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so I tell you, it's it's important when we get this this, you know, this thing, you know, we see that even God himself wanted to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Even God wanted to have a bride. I'm getting ready to read you something here. Even God wanted to have a bride. It's It's not normal for a man not to want to be married. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? It's not normal for a man not to want to be married. &gt;&gt; Even God himself wanted to have a bride. That attribute that was in God should be in every man. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. All right. Look at this. Now look at what brother Random says in spoken words original seed. It says, "Now Jehovah had a bride. Jehovah had a bride once. Adam had a bride. Jesus had a bride." Right? Uh he says um Jehovah had a bride. You know that he had to put her away. She become a Right? So he put her away and look at now watch this because this ties into Wednesday night. Watch it now. It says that's exactly what he said. She become a a prostitute. What caused her to do that? I wish we had time to read it. I may get to I may get to some of it after a while. It was in the time of Samuel. When did his bride become a It was in God's bride became a and he had to put her away. He said because it was during the time of Samuel. said when Israel had a king, &gt;&gt; that's when he had to put her away. That's when she walked out on him. &gt;&gt; But he always wanted a bride. &gt;&gt; But his bride walked out on him. &gt;&gt; My God. Even when God gave uh Eve to Adam, she walked out on him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. My my my my. We thank God that, you know, Adam had something on the inside that he stay with her because God could have killed her &gt;&gt; in the condition that she was in. And unless Adam did what he did, uh God would have killed God would have killed Eve and maybe got another rib out of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Look at this now. It says um I wish we had time to read it. I I may get to some of it after a while. It was in the time of Samuel when when Israel had a king of God and she was a virgin. She was going to produce something. Uh and what happened? She began to look around and see other nations and kings. So she wanted to be like the rest of them. You backwash Pentecost. That's exactly what you done. And brother Brandham said, I mean now they wanted a a a man to be a leader. They wanted this uh this ruler to be embodied in a human being. Now, that desire was actually the right desire. It was perfectly in line with what God already had in his mind. He was going to humanize the leadership. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't going to be in a in a Saul. It was going to be in Jesus. &gt;&gt; He was going to they was going to they was going to get a they was going to get God as a spirit embodied in a man to be their king. He was going to come down and dwell in their midst. But they got ahead of God just like Eve got ahead of it. &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. All right. Let's keep on going. It says the old this old preacher sitting here nearly 100 years old today when Pentecost broke through back there. You couldn't tell them nothing about no organization. They wouldn't listen to that. They call that they call the thing of the devil. And them men were right. But what did you do? You had to act like the rest of the churches. You had to organize it. Then as uh as he said, you draw fences between you. Amen. Went to teaching mustn't teach this. Glory to God. Hallelujah. This way. And jump up and down and speak in tongues and put him in as a member. Uh he's got her. He's not baptized right. Neither with the water nor with the spirit. He's wrong and his fruits proved it. Now, what he's saying is that, praise the Lord, you know, in Pentecost, they just put anybody up and and and and and that's the same thing, you know, here, you got to have a life. You can't be you can't be doing one thing out there and then coming up here ministering. &gt;&gt; If you don't have no life, you have to sit down. &gt;&gt; It it must be a life, right? We're not just giving out uh uh uh positions just to have people in positions. No, you got to have a life, &gt;&gt; right? And and and brother man saying back way back way back in this day, they just kind of put anybody in there. They baptiz the people and and there's no I mean there's really no true repentance. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Y'all forgive me for for saying these things. I mean, you know, I I the first time president, you know, our president became president, I think 45 or 46, I don't know what it was, they tried to tell us that he was a Christian. because he went to church and held the Bible up &gt;&gt; and and and &gt;&gt; he a Christian. &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Come on. Come on. We We We We We We minimizing what Christianity is really all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You can't sell that to me and tell me that this man's a Christian. And let me tell you, there's a lot of other people out there. They trying to tell you Christians. No. Christians don't act like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. I mean, we got we got to uphold the standards of Christianity. Oh, Lord, let me let me go a little further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go. And they they try to get you to justify sinful lifestyles &gt;&gt; and and try to tie it into a race of people &gt;&gt; because they were actually held back. And now these people in this go ungodly lifestyle, they've been held. Don't you try to equate that. That's right. &gt;&gt; No, we were born this way, God. Yeah, we really were born this way. &gt;&gt; No, you made a choice to be that way. &gt;&gt; And God ain't pleased with it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen, church. But but don't don't get caught up in all this nonsense. We We got to be Christians. &gt;&gt; We got to follow the scripture. We not following nothing else but the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us go a little further, please. &gt;&gt; Let us go just a little further. &gt;&gt; Now, watch. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going I'm I'm bringing this. We're going to we're going to get to who will take the book in a second. I got I got to make a turn. Let me just finish reading this. He says this. He says, "You had to organize." Then he said, "You draw fences between you went to teach and lesson teach that." Glory to God. Hallelujah. This way. And jump up and down and speak with tongues and put a man put him in as a member. He's got her. I'm sorry. put put him in a member. He's got her. He's not baptized, right? Neither with the water nor with the spirit. The man ain't baptized in no way at all. He says he's he's wrong and his fruits prove it. He's got the wrong kind of seed grow uh grow uh to grow on. Bless God, brother. We'll lay hands on you here and make you an elder. He just got to church yesterday. How he going to be an elder? Elder is a seasons a seasoned person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. just like and then look, you get people that get saved and want to go preaching immediately. &gt;&gt; Why don't you sit down and listen to something &gt;&gt; before you go to preaching? Just sit down and listen. Praise God. We don't we don't do things like that. I mean, I had so so many people just kind of come and and and how can we get connected with your ministry? We want to come and do this. I uh you don't even know anything about my ministry. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, we want we got this. We got this plan. We got that. said, "Well, uh, my brother, you know what the scripture actually say? The Bible say this. It says, "Know them &gt;&gt; that labor among you." &gt;&gt; I said, "So, let us get to know you." &gt;&gt; Oh, good God almighty. &gt;&gt; He He had a He had a He wanted to He had a rap ministry. He wanted to come and rap. I said, "Brother God, deliver me from that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God took that away from me. And I ain't going to try to dress it up and make it Christian. &gt;&gt; That beat is still a really bad beat. &gt;&gt; And it make your body do things it's not supposed to do. &gt;&gt; We dance different in the church. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let me go a little look this type of dance. I mean, if the if the if the music make you want to get on the ground and spin and and all kind of stuff, you know something wrong with that. Come on, church. All right. Now, all right. Let me just keep going. Amen. It says um uh lay hands on on you here and make you an elder. It says we're going to build this organization here till it's going to be so uh to be bigger than the assemblies. That's just the way it's went. Read read the Pentecostal history and see if it wasn't if that isn't so of any other church. Baptist wants to outdo the Methodist. Methodist wants to outdo the Lutheran. Lutheran want to outdo the Catholic. everyone uh to outdo outdo. That's the spirit of the organization. &gt;&gt; We not trying to outdo nobody. &gt;&gt; We just trying to follow the word of the Lord. I need to make a shift here. We're talking about who will take the book. Let us turn amen to um uh my Lord. Let us turn over here to um Revelation 5. Revelation 5. Let us read amen uh from this and we'll we kind of catch something. Thank you Jesus. Now Revelation 5 uh God's prophets said this is the most sublime scripture in the Bible when we look at what what is happening here. And um says, "And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside it was sealed with seven seals." Now the first thing that we need to understand is that this is uh God is the one that sits on the throne and the Bible actually tells us that God is a spirit and it says that they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. This is what the Bible says. So based on what the Bible says, we know when the scripture says I saw in the right hand, this is not God having a right hand like you and I. That's not what the Bible's saying here. But what we're seeing is that this is a place of authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a position of authority. So I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne. He's the one that's in control. Amen. A book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. right now. Um, we happen to be living in a day &gt;&gt; where the seals have been torn off of that book &gt;&gt; and now we can see what's on the inside of the book. Back here it was a mystery. But we live in a day, hallelujah, where God promised that these mysteries would be revealed. According to Revelation 10, God promised that the mysteries will be revealed. When the seventh angel, Hallelujah, the one on the seventh plank, on the seventh step, when he begins to introduce you to the king, you will begin to see these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let's go on a little further. It says, "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" And and and look at this now. John as John is in this vision uh on the aisle of Patmas and he sees all this and he says and no man in heaven he heard the angel cry who's worthy to take this book and say no man in heaven nor in earth my God neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there. Do we get that? Amen. When when John looked, he said, "No, man." I I can imagine him look at Noah and say, "Noah's not worthy." He looked at Jeremiah and say, "Jeremiah's not worthy." Looked at Isaiah and said that Isaiah was not worthy. Looked at Adam, Adam is not worth. Not one man able to take this book. Praise God. I mean, he maybe maybe he looked at some of the other disciples. Peter is not worthy. My Paul is not worthy. I mean Matthew is not worthy. Mark is not worth. Nobody worthy. This was a very sad situation. Can I bring it even a little for forward? &gt;&gt; Amen. He looked at you. &gt;&gt; You were not worthy. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was not worthy. No man worthy to take this book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at it now. It says John, this John speaking, "And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look their own." It goes a little further says, "And and one of the others said unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root, amen, of David, had prevailed to open the book and and to lose the seven sisters of And I like this. Amen. I yesterday at the at the at the at the homegoing service, Brother Lonnie um uh Jackson was speaking and uh and he made a statement. He says, you know, um he was talking about how um uh Brother Brandon was having a conversation with his with his his sister. their mother had just passed and her sister was very discouraged by mama mama dime and um and and brother Brandham says you know said Dolores I want you to go out and look out the window. He says when you look out the window said I want you to look to the left and and and I want you to look at and tell me what you see. She say I see a big tree big old big oak tree. Says okay. He say um you know what does the tree look like right now? You say, she say, "I see uh I see leaves that are green and and brown and and red." She he said, "Now, there's other times in the springtime where that that le that tree is just all green." And he actually said, "Now, which season is the tree the most pretties." &gt;&gt; She said he she said, "Well, it's during this season of fall time when you got all these different colors in the leaves. It's not only green, but it's it's it's red and it's brown and it's green. We get all these color." She said, "This is when it's the most pretty." He's saying, "Right, this is a time where the life is actually going out of the tree, but yet it's the most prettiest when the life is going out." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said he said he and he say said a lot those those leaves are going to fall off. He says, "But the life that was in the leaves, it goes right back down the the bark of that tree and it gets into the the root of the tree." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And it stays there until the winter time is over. And then it comes back up in the springtime and those leaves will live again. &gt;&gt; He says, "But notice now, Amen. The le the the the life goes down into the root." And he says, "Now notice, but by going into the root, the life is in the root of David, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, the life is in the root. That's why you will spring again." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here it is. The Bible, the Bible says, Amen. the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals of Christ is loosening these seals. He says, "And I beheld." And lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four uh beasts, and in the midst of the the uh elders stood a lamb. Now he says, he says the lion of the tribe of Judah. But when John turns, Amen. he sees a lamb. Hallelujah. Because this lion and this lamb is the same person. Amen. The lion of the tribe of Judas Christ. And this lamb, this bleeding bloody lamb, he was the lamb of God that took away all of our sins. Look at this. Look at this. It says, "And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the uh of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes." Those are seers, those are prophets, the eyes of of a prophet to be able to see and give direction for amen. for for that age. &gt;&gt; Look, he says uh uh the scripture says uh uh uh now and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four uh four beasts. In the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Now, now these seven spirits of God that was sent through the earth and this ex this happened according to Revelation 2 and three there were seven messengers, seven angels that the scripture scripture describes that came at different times in history. Paul was the first one to come. &gt;&gt; My God. But the last one to come in our day happened to be William, Mary, and Brandon. &gt;&gt; But God God specifically would send different ones at different times in order to keep the people lined up with the word. is not to worship that man. We don't worship Paul sir. &gt;&gt; We don't worship brother Brandham. But we will follow them as they follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; watch this now. Amen. It goes on. It says uh and and and he came and took the book. This is Christ took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the saints. It says, "And they sung a new song, saying, thou art worthy to take the book." And the open seal, that mean the song was inspired right there. When they saw this thing happen, they got inspired to start singing a new song. I'm telling you, when you when you when when when when when this thing begins to open up to you. &gt;&gt; It will inspire you and cause you to sing some new songs. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They sung a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Verse 11 says, "And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and and uh and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands." A lot of folk here &gt;&gt; and John heard it. Verse 12, saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb." Amen. that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. Now John is hearing all this. John is hearing everybody worship when they they saw the lamb or the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the lamb of God take that book out of amen out of the the the one who had ownership of the book. It was God himself that owned this book. This book is a book of redemption. Hallelujah. Not just any kind of book, but this is a book of redemption. This is the those that will be redeemed on the earth. Those that will come to truth on the earth. God already knew before the foundation of the world that you all would come to truth. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "You will know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth will make you free." God already had your name written inside of a book. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; It was in the blood section of the book of life. He knew that you would come to truth. &gt;&gt; He knew that once you heard it, you would not reject it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus went and died for these people that he knew was inside that section of the book of life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Look at this. This is a book of redemption. And and John knew if nobody's worthy to take that book, all creation was lost. So when he saw Christ, amen, step forth the lamb. They said the the elders said, "Behold the lion of the tribe of Judah." He said, "But he saw he turned and he saw a lamb." He knew it was Christ that came and that was worthy to take that book out of the hand of him that owned it. He brought redemption to his church. Now, now John heard all these people worshiping. said he said the verse uh verse verse 11 he says uh and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne the beasts the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thou I mean John this is a lot of folk &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; I hear angels worshiping I I hear the beasts I hear the elders I mean look look and let me tell you something when when Uh when you get a real revelation, it ought to cause you to worship, too. &gt;&gt; I mean, and and and in this scene, nobody was just standing around, &gt;&gt; brother. People were involved in worship. &gt;&gt; When they realized what had happened because all everything would have been lost had not this lamb stepped forth. But when they saw him step forth, they said, "My God." I mean, it invoked praise and worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let us go forward here. Verse 12 again. Say with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. Glory to God. I tell you the truth, this just blesses my heart. This blessed my heart. Let me just stop at verse 12 just for a second. Uh, I want to catch a quote out of uh um the breach between the seven church agents and seven seals. And I think I might have put he is not an animal. Just just bring that up really really quick. It says notice he is not an animal. So this lion of the tribe of Judah Judah as well as this when John looked he saw a lamb. This is not an animal. This is this is Christ, right? He's not an animal. He he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Who was it? The owner, the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand. And no angel. See, angel couldn't die for you. A angel a a angel is a ministering spirit that comes and gives you, you know, different messages and things like that. But the angel can die. God had to take on flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. In order to die for your sins. Can I go a little I mean I I I always like to try to share this. It wasn't God just sending his son. &gt;&gt; That's that's that we only got part of the picture. &gt;&gt; When God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. You realize how God had to have a son, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, he had to overshadow Mary &gt;&gt; and and and and we know how children are born. It's through the husband and the wife coming together and you know and and you know and and through that act a child can be born. But but this wasn't God coming together through a sexual act. God, Amen. was was the life that was created inside of Mary. All he did was bar her womb so he could be begott a son. &gt;&gt; But it was God making himself a body. Can I put it that way? God made himself his own body and he borrowed Mary's womb to make that body. &gt;&gt; My God, he borrowed a grave to be buried in because he wouldn't need it for long. &gt;&gt; And and I think I read a quote last week that when God borrow something from he borrowed a boat from Peter &gt;&gt; the preacher. When God borrow something, he always pay you back. He borrowed this womb from Mary, but it was God creating a body that he could dwell in. He can go from spirit form to a body form. So, it's not just God sending his son. It's God becoming the son. &gt;&gt; Just think about it. Think about it. If you got children and you set up a rule, say now so and so, um, anybody go across this line is going to die. And here I come along and you love me so much and I cross the line and you done made this rule that anybody cross the line and die. Well, brother Jack got to die. But you say, "Well, I love Brother Jack too much." Um, come here, Junior. I want you to die in the place of Brother Jack. Now, if I was Junior, &gt;&gt; I I heard you make that rule. &gt;&gt; You the one say if anybody cross that line, they got to die. Since I heard you say, I stayed on this side of the line. I didn't want to die. &gt;&gt; And now you're going to make me die for Jack. &gt;&gt; Who is Jack? &gt;&gt; Me die for him. No. No. No. No. No. If you want to be just, &gt;&gt; you don't make me die for his sin. If you made that rule and you feel so sorry for Jack, &gt;&gt; the the best way to settle this &gt;&gt; is you need to die for Jack. &gt;&gt; Not don't send me to die for Jack. You need to die for Jack. And that's exactly what happened. God became flesh so that he could die &gt;&gt; for every sin that we ever ever committed. God became flesh so that he could die. It wasn't just God sending the son. It's God becoming the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at this. The owner, the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel, no angelic being, nothing else could take take the place. And this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand. Now, he wasn't an animal. It wasn't an animal. This was all symbolic. When you're reading the book of Revelation, you got to see all the symbols. But this was Christ. The Bible says that he was he was slain before the foundation of the world. Look at this. It says in and this bloody lamb walked out and and took the book out of his hand. What was it, brother? This is the most sublime thing in the scripture. A act that not an angel, not nothing could do it. And the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. What is it now? It belongs to the lamb. Amen. Now, yeah, let me just pause. I I'll come back to verse 13 in a second, but let me go back now because we we read there in uh the book of Joshua chapter 15 and the the the I think I need to just bring it up because I want you to catch all of this. I'll refer to it. I I I know where I'm going, but you don't know where I'm going. Let's go back to Joshua 15. This is our our our scripture. Now, I told you at the beginning, notice this is the land of Judah. Uh verse 13, this is the the the tribe of Judah that is receiving their inheritance. This whole story happens with the tribe of Judah. And I just read for you that it was the lion of the tribe of Judah that was able and the only one able to take the book out of the original owner. So look at this story how these intertwine what happens in Revelation connected here to the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; My God. And here they were in dividing the land. Uh Judah is getting their their their inheritance. uh Caleb I mean Joshua was divided and given an inheritance and then it says in verse verse 13 and unto Caleb the son of Jeffa he gave a part among the children of Judah according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua even the city of Arba the father of Anoch which city uh which city is he now that's a that was a very important city uh I know that uh uh Abraham was buried there uh Sarah was buried there. Uh uh Joseph's bones was there at Hebron. And this was important because during the resurrection when Jesus first rose again, the saints rose from the grave. Those that were buried in this area, they are the ones that rose from the grave. It was important to be buried at Hebron, &gt;&gt; right? They didn't they didn't know that. But uh but it it it it really it was very significant in God's economy, right? Verse verse 14. And Caleb drove Vince uh the the sons of Anoch, Shish, Shishi, and uh Aiman and Tam um uh Town, the children of Anoch. And he went up then to the inhabitants of Deir. Praise God. Uh and the name of Deir before was Kurj Sephir. Now why would the scripture say the name before was Kurjaf Sephir? Because names have a meaning &gt;&gt; and you know the name Kjaf Cifir actually means city of the book. &gt;&gt; So when he says who will take Kjaf Sephir he's actually asking who will take the book. Let's go a little further. &gt;&gt; It says, "And Caleb said, he that smiteth Kerjaf Sephir and taketh it to him will I give Axa my daughter to wife." So now if you take the book then the reward is that you get his daughter as a wife &gt;&gt; and and not not just not just not just his daughter but my daughter Axa. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many other kids Caleb had but my daughter Axa your name is important. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because her name actually meant adorned. &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready. She's adorned. Right. It meant adorn and also meant the bring the the bursting of the veil. &gt;&gt; Let us read a little quote right here for you. Uh so I can just kind of tie these together. This out of the breach and um let's see here. Um I don't know if if I got the seals was broke or in the last church age to reveal the truth. Something like that you might find. Okay, that's where I'm going. Now look at this because John saw in Revelation five the lamb or the lion of the tribe of Jud. He turned and saw a lamb and the lamb took the book and he tore off the seals. But in tearing off the seals, what is he getting? He's getting the bride. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He knew your name was in that book, &gt;&gt; that book of redemption. And by revealing his word to you, he's actually calling his bride to him. Look at what the prophet says here in the breach between the seven church agents and the seven seals. He says the seals was broke. He says why in the last church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom, his bride. By revealing the seals, he's collecting his subjects. Look at that. Not just the seals, but every every mystery that God had tied up in him. All those mysteries have now been made known to the church and we can fellowship around the full word of God from Genesis to Revelation. We don't have to be afraid to preach it because it has been revealed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of churches nowadays, they won't even touch the book of Revelation and they ain't got nothing to say but just he'll wipe my tears from my eyes. That's all it is. It's so much more in here. &gt;&gt; But now we have understanding of these things because God sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the prophet's job to reveal the word of God to the people. And not only God sent you a prophet, he sent you a prophet with a seventh grade education. &gt;&gt; To make it real easy for you, &gt;&gt; he says, "Look, the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom, his bride. See, oh my, he wants to bring his subjects to him." Now, what is it? Out of the dust of the earth, out of the bottom of the sea, out of the pits, out of everywhere in every place, out of the regions of the dark, out of the par out of paradise, wherever they may be, he will call. They'll answer. Amen. He will call and they will answer. How does he call? He calls through his word. You see, many of us are sitting here in this church today because we were wherever we were. We might have went to a service. I remember brother Smiley's testimony. He was just working in the church and he listening to them brothers talk. All they was doing fellowship. And these weren't even the preachers in the church. These were just brothers in the church talking. Sometimes people can be around our sisters and they'd be like, "You must be a preacher." No, I'm not. But I just got a revelation of the word, &gt;&gt; right? And and because we have an understanding of the word, we sound so different from everybody. It's because we're feasting off of an open book. &gt;&gt; What we heard this word and when we heard the word, it struck something on the inside and we saying that ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; When I heard about what happened in the Garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; they first told me it was an apple. She ate an apple. She ate an apple and something to me mean like that don't I mean I'm a lad and that didn't make sense. She ate an apple. We got in all this trouble. &gt;&gt; People start dying and from eating an apple. No, this don't sound right. This don't sound right. But then I heard that no, it wasn't apple. It was adultery that happened in the Garden of Eden. because that's how she had a child. You don't eat apples and have children. &gt;&gt; You know that. You don't eat apricots and have children. It's through a sexual act that you have children. &gt;&gt; So, it had to if if it's a sexual act today, it had to be a sexual act back then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when I was adultery, I mean, and and and so then we had to understand, well, who was this serpent? &gt;&gt; Because the way we think of a serpent is just something on the ground like this. But before he got to the ground, he stood on two feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was cursed in the in the book of Genesis and he lost his ability to stand on them two feet. That's when he went down on the ground. &gt;&gt; But before that, he stood on two feet and he was half man, half animal &gt;&gt; without a soul. Right? &gt;&gt; And Satan was able to use that animal to commit a sexual act with Eve that she introduced to Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. Eve was &gt;&gt; But you know that was all for a purpose. God don't do nothing without no purpose. &gt;&gt; Even when he created Eve from Adam, she was the only thing that was not a part of the original creation. She was made from something that was already created. &gt;&gt; God knew that she would have a weakness. But in that weakness, he'd be able to express every attribute that he ever had locked up in him. &gt;&gt; This is how we get know him as a savior. &gt;&gt; This is how we know him as a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Oh, you you know what? You will learn things about God in your weaknesses. I say you're going to learn things about God &gt;&gt; in your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Not when you strong, it's when you get weak. That's when you begin to understand who he is. &gt;&gt; Your relationship goes so much deeper &gt;&gt; in your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. I gota I gota I gotta make some turns here. Let me keep reading. Uh see he come to get his subjects. He revealed his secrets and they saw it. And time is no more at that time. Time has run out. It is finished. Now that's Revelation 10 that's being quoted right there. You know, because when um uh when the seventh angel reveals all the mysteries, time should be no more. And we're living in that time period right now on earth. We're living in a time God has sent one of his seven spirits, one of his messengers into the earth. He's already come, given his message, and he's gone. Just like Paul came, and he's gone. But we're still abiding by the things that Paul spoke. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we're abiding by the things that God's prophet spoke. But notice the things that God's prophet spoke are the same things Paul spoke &gt;&gt; because if he said anything different he has to be a curse. &gt;&gt; All right. Let us let us let us keep moving. He says he leaves the throne to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message. He's not a mediator. Remember the Old Testament teacher. Now, as we hurry, when the blood went off the mercy seat, what was it? Judgment seat. And when the lamb uh when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his and took his rights, it was a judgment seat. Then he become not a lamb, but a lion king. And he calls for his queen to come and stand by his side. Know ye not that the saints shall judge the earth. Now, um, when we go back here to Joshua, uh, Caleb says there in, uh, what verse did I stop at? Uh, verse 16. Caleb said, "He that smiteth Kath Sephir, and taketh it, to him will I give Axa, my daughter to wife." Now, Axa, her name meant bursting of the veil. Her name also meant adorn. And the name Kjaf Sea meant city of the book. So who's gonna take the book or the city of the book? Who's going to take this city? Notice who steps up. Verse um 17. And the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it and he gave him axe his daughter to wife. Everything in the scripture has significance. Who? Aiel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb. This means it's his nephew, &gt;&gt; which simply means this is a kinsman &gt;&gt; redeemer. &gt;&gt; It took a kinsman redeemer to bring us back to our place. So here in the scripture we see often the L is represented as the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my. Even when they was being born and given these names, they had no idea what their names would mean for people all the way down 4,000 years later. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; 3,000 whatever it is. God is perfect, y'all. When Christ took the book and he revealed the seals, he was also getting his bride. When Anneil took Kerjaf Sephir, he was also getting his bride. Let's go on a little further. Oh my. Let me see here. I got something. I think I Oh, yes. Yes. I need to I need to read this because as as ail again um getting the bride the seals being open to us in this day it was a book that was closed the seals were seals had it locked up but in Revelation 10 let me read that revelation 10 and 7 let me read that real quick um this is where we know that we're living in a time where we we no longer have a closed book we have an open book because The Bible says it in Revelation 10:7, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin the sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets." Brother Brandon before he preached the seven seals uh back in 1963 uh supernaturally God visited him with seven angels. those angels formed a cloud in the sky and uh it was seven angels and you know even I think it was Life magazine that recorded you know this these angelic beings that were there and and um the way that the cloud came down in Life magazine the picture they had uh they couldn't tell what it was but a prophet and notice the prophet never went to the magazine the prophet went to the church &gt;&gt; because this was not for the the Thank you sis uh the the prophet, you know, it it came down there on the left side that way and they and they just had no idea what was going on. So, Brother Brandham went to the church and say, "Now, turn the picture to the right." &gt;&gt; Only the church, only the bride will have this understand. Turn the picture to the right. And when it turned to the right, what they saw was the silhouette of Christ &gt;&gt; with his white wigged hair. According to Revelation 1, he's supposed to have a white white wig. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God took this picture in 1963 in the skies &gt;&gt; after this happened. He was commissioned by these angels go back to the east and begin to preach the seven seals. So now we have the revelation of the seven seals. What the white horse rider was, what the red horse rider was, what the black horse rider was, what the pale horse rider. And people don't and people don't even realize today pale like gray like no no no no. A prophet helped us see is the white horse, the red horse, the black horse, all combined making pale. &gt;&gt; He helped us see these things. Now we have clarity. I can preach to you out of Revelation 6. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And be certain about what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; My God. Not just Revelation 6. Anything in the book, I can preach to you. &gt;&gt; But these are the things we know that we're standing on truth. Look at this. Let me go a little further. Let me go a little further. Um here in this in this in the breach between the seven church ages and seven seals. This is a sermon he preaches right before he preaches the seven seals. And um I think it's a book a mysterious book. Book a mysterious book. Put that in. It says now it is a myster. It's a book a mysterious book. It's a book of redemption. We'll get into that in a little while. And now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood. It's probed at through six church ages. But at the end on that seventh plank, at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery, he winds up all those loose ends and these fellas that these fellas probed at. And the mysteries, look at this, look at this. The mysteries comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God. Then the Godhead and everything else is settled. All the mystery, serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed. I I love that. There's another little thing that I I I want to just mention to you here. Um I'm I'm going to questions and answers and then I'm I'm I'm I'm winding down. You know these mysteries coming down from God. Lord, these mysteries coming down from God. They're coming down as the word of God. And by coming as the word of God is it's drawing us closer to Christ. Now, I stopped at Revelation um 8. I stopped No, Revelation 5. Uh I stopped at verse 13. I'm going to go back and I'm I'mma read that and then I'm going to come to this quote and um questions and answers on the seals. Now I I I said before that John heard the voice of many man. He I mean he he heard angels. Verse 11 it says I beh I beheld Revelation 5:11. And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne. And this was after the lamb took the book. Right? It says uh I heard uh the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousand thousand saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. And now look at this. Something changed. All these people that he hear now every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea. In in the sea he says and all that are in them. What heard? I mean, wait a minute. He all these people would have been drowning join John out. How now the whole thing changed where they can hear John worshiping. &gt;&gt; Look at this. Heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever. and and ever. And the four beasts said, "Amen." And the four and 20 elders fell down and and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever. Now, now here John is hearing all them worship, but then all of a sudden John say they heard me worship. How is it that we all everybody can hear everybody else worshiping? How is it that we can hear these things? It's because I realize you got the same revelation that I got. &gt;&gt; God is giving you the same understanding I got. him. We join together in worship. I I I think I think even David said, "Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together." &gt;&gt; Now, what was it that caused John to go into this condition? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us it's because John saw his name &gt;&gt; in the book. That's it. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just read this quote of how you see your name in the book. &gt;&gt; That's why I got to set this up. &gt;&gt; The question is now, Brother Brandham, is it true that every Jew born since Christ came will be saved? And who are 144,000? Are they predestined ones to be sealed with the Holy Ghost? And what is their mission? They got all kind of questions. He said there's about three questions in one there. says first one is um uh is it true that every Jew born since Christ that came into the world is to be saved? No. Nothing will be saved. Only those names who were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, Jew or Gentile. So see this book had those names in it and those are the only ones that he came to die for. No, let me just be honest with you. For God so loved that he God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Which world did he love? &gt;&gt; You know, all of us are sitting here, but we all live in different worlds. &gt;&gt; And what kind of causes our worlds to unite is when we come underneath &gt;&gt; this roof and we worship together, but we all got different worlds. Look, the the man the the bum on the street is living in a different world than what you're living in. Uh there are some people in other nations, they call them third world nations. They live in different conditions to what you live in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, you boy, you let you you let you be done paid your bill and FPL done turned off your lights. You got rights. &gt;&gt; You going to go and get somebody on the phone and and you going to show them your receipt. I did this. You don't you don't you you won't take no for an answer. &gt;&gt; But you go to Zimbabwe. Hallelujah. And half half the day you might have lights and the other half day no lights. They notify you when your lights going to be on even if you paid your bill. &gt;&gt; But that's the way they live. And and you better not go over there and complain. I mean we got over there water going to run at this time. Well, what about I want to take a shower now. No, you don't take a shower at that time. You better put some uh water in a bucket at that time. But the water going to be run at the house at this time. And it's very common for the people to live like that. &gt;&gt; I went to Ghana one time and and I knew, you know, things are different. I went there and Lord, let me I'm winding down. But when um I got there and I saw a big old five gallon bucket in in in in the in the uh my room, me and my wife said, "Well, we're only going to be here for a few days, dear. Just we know what to do with the bucket. That's how you flush the toilet. And that's how you take a take a a wash up with this bucket. And we just going through and going through and and we ain't say nothing. Three or four days go by. Pastor say, "How how everything going?" I say, "Everything going?" Said, "We just need that bucket refilled in our room." He said, "Bucket?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "Oh, they forgot to turn the water on in your room." I said, "I didn't know they were supposed to turn the water on in. I just thought this the way it was." Sometimes it be that way, you see. And and but we all living in different worlds. And I can tell you the world that Jesus died for was the ones that he knew were in that book. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even give my life for people that I know weren't going to receive it. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You wouldn't do it either. God is a lot smarter than us. &gt;&gt; He didn't just give his life for people that weren't going to receive it. He The world that he talk about is the ones that was in that book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me I got to I got to finish this. Um it says this, nothing will be received. Only those names who were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation world, Jew or Gentile. See, that's all the book holds that mystery. And the book is only unfolding it now. It says not each one's name. So it it don't have Jackie Edwin Duff or whatever your full name is, your government name. It don't have that in the book. &gt;&gt; Let's go on a little further. Not each one's name, but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names. So you find you understand that now. See, he says the book doesn't say now Lee Vale is to be saved in the time of this church age or or Neville or whatever. No, it don't say that. It just shows the mystery, unfolds the mystery of what the thing is. But we ourselves by faith believe it. And when we by faith believe it, we hear and we see our name in the book. Yes, sir. It's because you can identify with the mystery of that book. You see your name in the book &gt;&gt; and that's how your name is called. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's called by revelation. &gt;&gt; Let me go back to um Joshua. Finish up just this last little verse here. Joshua 15. And then I got one more quote and I'll be done. Now verse 17 says, "And Athen the son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it and he gave him Oxa his daughter to wife." And remember Oxa actually means adorned. And um let me catch this. and she was a type of the bride. Uh but here we see uh Oxa being a type of the bride. Verse 18, and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And now she know what that what her daddy got. Aan, now I know you got I know I I know I'm the reward, but it's more to this. Ask my daddy. Ask my daddy. Not just I mean cuz he's telling you what he going to give you. But now you need to ask him for something cuz you done went out there and you done defeated you know these giants. So you need to ask that right now he is in a giving mood. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oxa understood that you got to know your seasons &gt;&gt; here. It says in Caleb as she as she came to him she said that she moved him to ask her father a field and she lighted off her ass and Caleb said to her what is thou now and she was moving quick. She ain't want this time to get by too fast. Don't wait till tomorrow. You better move now and get this. It's like the angel trouble in the water now. Jump in now. &gt;&gt; Right. Look at this. Now watch what happened. It says, "What what wouldest thou who answered, give me a blessing, for thou has given me a south land, and daddy, I'm grateful for that, but give me also springs of water." And I like this. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. You see the upper springs represent the blessings that come from above. He sent down these revelations to us. And brother Brandham say if revelations beyond you look up and ask God for it. So revelation comes down from God to the people of God. These are blessings that are coming from the upper springs. When the Holy Spirit is falling all over the church, these are blessings coming from the upper springs. We thank God for blessings from the upper springs. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't live without blessings from the upper springs. &gt;&gt; But you can live a million miles beneath your privileges if you don't ask for these blessings in the Nether Springs. And the blessings in the Nether Springs are the blessings that we receive while we live here on earth. We ask for revelation of all God's mysteries because the church lives off revelation. It's with true revelation in our lives that the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over them. But also, we want these blessings. Amen. My God, from these nether springs. Let me let me let me let me read this. This is coming out of here ye him. And musicians, y'all can prepare yourselves to come on back. I'mma read this and I will depart. Brother Random says this, "Don't never be afraid." Now, now why he use the word afraid? You know what? Some of us even doubt what we asking God for. Like he can't do it. &gt;&gt; Do he have it or not? If daddy got it, ask him. &gt;&gt; I I I I I I remember one time I told him, "I need $10,000, Lord. I need it. I need $10,000 and I needed it. And I didn't know where I was going where the money was coming from. I had no idea where I need $10,000. And somebody happened to call me and say, you know, uh you got some money sitting right here and you didn't even know you had money over there. I'm like I said, how much is it? Uh, you got money on this policy, on this policy, on this polic. I said, "How much do I have?" They add it all up. It was just about $10,000. I think a little over. I didn't even know I had it. God got money for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. I'm I'm I'm stepping into some things. But look, I I I I know a brother recently. I was listening to some videos. The brother said he told the Lord, "I need cash." That mean he had his bills paid. All that. That's good. But Lord, I need just some cash. I need a little extra money just to kind of sit on. &gt;&gt; Anybody need a little of that? &gt;&gt; Ju just to kind of sit on. Father, I And he he he prayed a very specific say, "Lord, I need cash." When I heard him say that he told the Lord he need cash and God provided the cash for him. You know what I said? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not ashamed, Lord. I need cash. &gt;&gt; I thank you for meeting my needs, but I need cash. I need some extra cash that I can have in my account. I'm not talking about tens and 20s and 30s. I'm talking about thousands. Thousands. I need cash. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say you provided 10,000 for me before, you can give me 50,000 now. &gt;&gt; I need cash. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you got to know when to ask. &gt;&gt; I mean, hey, ask a new you and ask her ask her ask &gt;&gt; ask. &gt;&gt; It's in her name. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ask. &gt;&gt; Y'all better ask God. &gt;&gt; Ask it shall be given. God, I need cash. I don't know how you're going to get it to me, but I need cash. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I need business. I need this. I need that. God, I need it. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. That's it, sis. &gt;&gt; Man, I'mma tell you, um, sometime I I get to asking and I I be asking too little. That's right. &gt;&gt; I I be asking to it's just just enough to get by here. No, no, no, no. Like brother Jean said, I don't just need enough gas money to get the church. &gt;&gt; I need to get back home. I need to go to work next week. You already thought all that out. Lord, I need all that met. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. All right. It's telling me that I got to uh shut down. Okay. This last quote. He says, "Don't never be afraid to ask big things." God wants you to ask big things. He don't want you to be little, petty, and juvenile. He wants you ask big things that your joys may be full. $50,000 will make my joys full, God. &gt;&gt; Not that my bank account will be full, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a little fish about that big way out yonder in the Atlantic Ocean say, "I better drink just a little bit of this water. I might run out." That's nonsense. Could you imagine a little mouse about that big down there in the great garden of Eden saying, "I just better eat two grains a day cuz I might run out before summertime again." That's nonsense. If they had 1000,000 rats that size, they'd never eat it up. And they had billions times billions of tons of them fish, they'd never drink the water up. How many times we could multiply? You could never I'm talking about the needs that you have right now and the needs you're going to have next year and the needs you're going to have the year after that. You could never exhaust God &gt;&gt; in his powers and his mercies to his children. He is inexhaustible. &gt;&gt; He's the inexhaustible fountain of life. Just drink and drink and drink &gt;&gt; and drink. I drunk last year, but I'm back again. &gt;&gt; And I might be back next year. &gt;&gt; The reason I'm coming cuz I know you got it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You better get off your animal real quick. &gt;&gt; Ask daddy cuz look man, this man is taking taking her away. Go into his own house. He's married. He's taking his wife away. And she's like, "No, no, no, no. Before I go. &gt;&gt; I mean, I know you excited, but I want some blessings. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I want some blessing. &gt;&gt; I want me a blessing." And and and and now and you say, "You gave me some soft land, but I need some springs. Now, she didn't even request what springs, but Caleb gave her. &gt;&gt; I'mma give you the nether spring and the upper spring. &gt;&gt; She got double. &gt;&gt; She got overflow. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; I'm asking big things &gt;&gt; cuz I got I serve a big God &gt;&gt; and he can do it. I know he can. I ain't got I ain't got no doubt about it in my mind. I know he can. So, I'm thanking him in advance &gt;&gt; for my cash. I'm thanking him in advance for the church in the school. I'm thanking in advance for every blessing that I need. I'm thinking in advance for my business being blessed. I'm thanking God in advance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Who will take the book? It's Christ that took the book. and he represented the whole thing in the story of Aanil and Axa and Caleb. God is amazing. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. Thank you for your truth that has been given to us. How grateful we are, Lord. And Lord, we come with our faith elevated to ask you, Father, for we ask you for the impossible, things that may look impossible, may seem impossible, but with our God, there is nothing too hard. We ask you for healing in our bodies. We ask you for deliverance in our families. We ask you, Lord, for every need that we have financially being met and that you would do the exceeding, the abundant above all we can ask or think. We ask you for cash, Lord. We ask you because we know you got it. And Father, we just trust, Lord Jesus, that uh Lord, these words won't just be something that goes in one ear and out the other, but Lord, it'll become a manifestation in our lives. Thank you, Lord, that you could reveal your truth. And as these mysteries are coming down, you're calling your bride. Thank you, Lord, that you would call us, that you would have enough confidence in us that you'd know that we'd respond to your truth, you would speak, and we would say, "Amen." May we stand like John who Lord, when he saw his name, God had caused him to join in the worship and the adoration uh to the lamb who who who was slain and took the book. And he's worthy to be praised. and we recognize Lord who we are. I trust oh God that Lord as we prepare just to leave uh on this journey Lord to uh Australia we've been given this opportunity Lord to preach the gospel and you told us in your word go into all the world and to preach the gospel. You said these signs shall follow them that believe. Lord may you go before and may you bless Lord the journey all the saints that are be going. We bind the hands of the enemy that would try to come against us in any way and hinder our trip Lord. Whether it's through a sickness, whether it's through an accident, whether it's through uh something with the planes, we bind the devil right now in the name of Jesus. And we ask Lord that you would make our trip prosperous. And while we are away, may you watch over Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Lord, bless the saints, Lord, the ministers that'll be coming forth uh during this time while we're away. Lord, bless each one, Father, in their uh respective places. Give them, Father, the words to speak to your people. Anoint them aresh, oh God, is our prayer. And Lord, we're just careful to give you all the honor and all the glory and all the praise because you deserve it. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Brother Solomon, I'll turn the service over uh to you. The Lord bless you, church. Amen. God bless you. And he hears me when I call. I have a maker. He formed my heart. Before even time began, my life was in his hands. Come on, will you stand with me? He knows my name. Oh, he knows my every thought. And he sees He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. I'll say it again. Say, "He knows. He knows my name." Yes, he does. He knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that's false and he hears me well. I call. Come on, one more time. Say, he knows. And he knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. And he hears me when I call. He and he hears me when I call. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we bow before you, our God and our King. Lord, we're grateful for the word that you have delivered to us, Lord. Father, we're so grateful that our ears can hear these things and our hearts can believe it. Father, thank you, Lord, for blessing our pastor and giving us this message, Lord. As he was preaching, I was thinking on the things that you've preached before, Lord, revealing to us that this is a time of restoration, Lord, and that we are supposed to be living in overflow. But you gave us a word, Lord Jesus. Not a word just to me or not a word just to Brother Jack, but to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Open your mouths wide and I'll fill it. Father, sometimes we don't ask, Lord, because we we believe that you you won't supply it, Father. That's not the attitude of believers. when we know that you have what we have need of, Lord Jesus. Father, we ought to believe you for big things. Father, you're not just a God that just gives. You give more than enough, Lord Jesus. Father, you took two fish and five loaves and fed thousands. Lord, that was more than enough, Lord. They had leftovers, Father. That's what we need, Lord. We need overflow, Lord. Father, we're not just asking that you give to us, Lord. that we may put money in our bank account. Lord, we want to be a conduit, Lord, where money comes in and goes out to others and money comes in and goes out to others, Lord. We have brothers and sisters, Lord, that may not have the faith, Lord, to ask. May not have the faith that'll believe you, Lord, for the things that they have need of, Lord, but you can answer through us, Lord. Father, we want to be be blessed so that we can be a blessing. Father, I'm not just asking for thousands. make me a millionaire, Lord. Father, when the saints come from other countries, Lord, their needs should be met, Lord. We should have the ability to provide for them, Lord. Father, we have a building down the street, Lord, that we're looking at, Lord Jesus. We want that building, Lord, without debt. We don't want to owe a thing on it, Lord Jesus. We want it completely taken care of. Father, we're asking you because we know that you can give it. So, Father, we believe we receive what we ask for. Bless these people, Lord. Give us the wisdom to know how to manage what you give us, Lord. Father, that we can retain it, Lord, and not that our blessings may come to an end. Bless your people in a special way with wisdom and knowledge, Lord. Money management skills, Lord, that we may do the right thing with what you give us. You have molded us throughout the years, Lord. You have worked it on our character that we can handle the blessings. Now use us, Father, is our prayer. Father, again, be with the saints as they travel to and from Australia. Lord, bless their time there. Bless the saints here that remain, Lord, as we stay at our post of duty, Lord. Father, we want to be faithful in all things. Bless us as we leave this place, Lord Jesus. And may we walk into the prosperity that you have prepared for us. This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You may have your seats and our brothers will come at this time to dismiss you. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
