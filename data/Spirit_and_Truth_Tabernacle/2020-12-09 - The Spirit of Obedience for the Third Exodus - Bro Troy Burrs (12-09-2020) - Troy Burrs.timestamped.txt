[2:42] what the lord has laid upon my heart
[2:44] amen
[2:46] as we um begin to get into the word
[2:50] kind of picking up from
[2:54] where i was at last week and just going
[2:57] a little further in that
[3:02] um
[3:04] i like to title this
[3:08] if i may this spirit
[3:11] of obedience
[3:14] for the third exodus spirit
[3:18] of obedience for the third exodus
[3:23] amen if we grab our bibles we'll go
[3:26] straight to the word
[3:28] i'd like to read amen a passage of
[3:32] scripture here starting
[3:35] with joel chapter 2.
[3:39] man joel chapter 2 will begin
[3:42] reading from the uh 25th
[3:47] the 25th verse
[3:52] amen
[3:57] and we'll kind of go over
[4:00] um
[4:01] [Music]
[4:04] into revelation 4
[4:07] amen and then uh we'll just go from
[4:11] there
[4:12] amen beginning that joel chapter 2
[4:15] 25 it says uh and i will restore to you
[4:20] the years
[4:21] that the locusts hath eaten and the
[4:24] cankerworm
[4:25] and the caterpillar and the palmer worm
[4:29] my great army which i sent among you
[4:33] and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[4:36] satisfied
[4:37] and praise the name of the lord your god
[4:40] and he hath dealt wondrously with you
[4:42] and my people shall never
[4:46] be ashamed so god is here saying that
[4:50] he is going to restore
[4:54] amen the years amen
[4:57] that the locust
[5:01] has eaten the cankle worm the cattle
[5:04] pill and the palmer worm
[5:06] and we understand that these
[5:11] this insect
[5:14] is just described as the same
[5:18] insect amen
[5:21] revealing itself in four different
[5:23] stages
[5:25] amen let us go to
[5:28] revelation four
[5:31] and the seventh the seventh
[5:34] chapter i'm sorry the uh the fourth
[5:37] chapter in the seventh verse
[5:41] revelation the fourth chapter and the
[5:44] seventh
[5:47] the seventh verse
[5:56] hey man
[6:15] i'm in the fourth chapter in the seventh
[6:17] verse and it says
[6:19] and the first beast was like a lion
[6:23] and the second beast was like a calf
[6:27] and the third beast had the face of a
[6:30] man
[6:31] and the fourth beast was like
[6:34] a flying eagle now we see that these
[6:38] four this four stage insect
[6:41] here and that he's talking about that
[6:44] that
[6:44] that uh god said he will restore the
[6:47] years that it has
[6:48] eaten amen and then we see here in
[6:52] in revelation that these um
[6:55] uh uh what they are are anointings
[6:59] the first beast was like a lion the
[7:01] second beast
[7:03] like a calf and uh the third beast
[7:06] has that the face of a man and that's
[7:09] very significant
[7:11] and the fourth beast was like a
[7:14] flying eagle these are the
[7:18] anointings for each age or for that time
[7:22] that god has to combat
[7:25] the spirit amen of
[7:29] these insects amen
[7:32] so in other words these anointing
[7:36] amen that is that is released upon the
[7:39] earth and needs
[7:40] in these four beasts amen is
[7:44] is is sort of this insect my my father
[7:48] was a a a one a great gardener
[7:52] and and and we know that gardeners
[7:54] sometimes the
[7:56] uh uh they they use insecticide now my
[7:59] father
[8:00] got away from insecticide and he learned
[8:02] certain tricks and different things to
[8:04] keep bugs and things
[8:06] off of his uh uh uh uh what he's planted
[8:10] by what he plant next to it amen
[8:14] so uh but but but but but but these
[8:17] anointings
[8:18] amen is it sort of works as an
[8:22] insecticide
[8:23] amen to these uh uh
[8:27] uh this insect amen as is it is it is
[8:30] released in the land
[8:32] amen to combat amen what god is doing
[8:36] amen last week i kind of likened this
[8:39] the the building of a temple amen taking
[8:42] this
[8:42] taking the with the word from from as
[8:45] solomon
[8:46] built the temple dedicated it was it was
[8:50] it was a temple but the in in the old
[8:54] testament as a natural type but the
[8:57] spiritual type was that the temple was a
[9:01] body read in hebrews he said that a body
[9:05] thou shalt prepare so the temple
[9:08] amen this tree amen that that that is
[9:12] speaking of that these locusts is eaten
[9:14] at
[9:15] these locusts is trying to destroy is
[9:19] a man the the kingdom of god
[9:22] amen uh we we understand that this
[9:26] that that when we when we speak of these
[9:28] things we speak of these things
[9:30] a man uh in in in a
[9:34] uh in a broad matter let me explain what
[9:37] i'm saying
[9:39] we know that in genesis is the seed
[9:42] chapter
[9:44] so we understand that revelation is the
[9:47] harvest
[9:48] so that what happened in in in genesis
[9:52] it is just multiplied in revelation
[9:56] it is the the the revelation is
[10:00] genesis in symbol form multiplied
[10:04] amen so we see in in genesis that
[10:07] that that there was a woman by the name
[10:10] of eve that was deceived
[10:13] and then when we come over into genesis
[10:15] into revelation here we see that there
[10:18] is a woman amen that it will be deceived
[10:23] amen once again amen but this is not
[10:26] just a one woman it's meaning
[10:28] amen that makes up a a a
[10:32] a body it makes up an entity the church
[10:35] amen amen so we'll we don't want to go
[10:38] too far to that we're going to get into
[10:39] that a little later
[10:41] amen so but revelation here these four
[10:44] beasts these different natures released
[10:46] as an anointing on the people of god to
[10:50] overcome the enemy of their
[10:53] age so this flying eagle
[10:57] is the anointing that has been released
[11:01] upon the elect
[11:03] in this age that enables us
[11:06] amen to fly above the thinking and the
[11:10] understanding of the
[11:14] false church in this age
[11:17] amen that enables us
[11:20] to to to to rise above
[11:23] amen that level of thinking
[11:26] amen through a prophetic vision
[11:30] we understand that in the scripture a
[11:33] prophet
[11:34] amen is always likened unto an eagle
[11:38] a prophet amen another word is
[11:42] a seer amen and
[11:45] up under a prophetic anointing
[11:48] which is an eagle anointing amen
[11:52] you're able to rise above
[11:56] a little higher and able to see afar
[12:00] off amen you're able to the higher you
[12:03] go i
[12:04] leave sunday uh brother kwaku sort of
[12:06] hit this
[12:07] he uh the the higher you go
[12:10] amen the eagle has a unique ability that
[12:15] his
[12:15] vision amen is he's old he's an ordained
[12:19] bird he's a special built
[12:21] bird amen by god that the higher he goes
[12:25] the keener his vision gets
[12:28] amen if you notice sometimes when you go
[12:30] up higher
[12:31] amen the higher you go the greater your
[12:33] perspective
[12:35] amen there's an old saying that
[12:37] sometimes you can't see the forest
[12:39] for the trees why because you're
[12:42] you're right there among them but if you
[12:44] can ever get lifted up
[12:46] amen and above the entire thing
[12:50] you can see oh wow now i got a better
[12:53] perspective
[12:54] of what's really happening amen and
[12:56] that's what that eagle anointing does
[12:59] it gives us a man the right perspective
[13:04] amen that we can see amen
[13:07] what the tricks of the enemy we can
[13:10] see amen what the devil is doing
[13:14] amen we can see amen what god is doing
[13:19] amen so revelation
[13:22] 3 amen uh
[13:25] 18 amen
[13:29] revelation 3 18 says i
[13:32] counseled thee to buy of me
[13:38] gold tried in the fire
[13:42] now now it's cold outside but it ain't
[13:47] all that cold in here i'm gonna have to
[13:48] take this jacket off
[13:53] hey man i counseled the dubai of me
[13:56] now now now who counsels i counsel
[14:01] so the the council the one doing the
[14:04] counseling here
[14:06] amen is the lord
[14:09] he is the one doing the council amen and
[14:12] he is the one that you
[14:14] must buy of him gold that is tried
[14:18] in the fire that thou mayest be
[14:22] rich in white raiment
[14:26] that thou mayest be clothed
[14:29] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[14:35] and anoint thine eyes with an
[14:39] eye so that thou mayest
[14:43] see again here we see the emphasis
[14:48] is on this age of the importance of
[14:51] being able to see
[14:55] the bible teaches us that uh
[14:58] uh uh this seeing and
[15:01] and we'll we'll we'll kind of back that
[15:03] up by the scripture
[15:05] to see amen
[15:09] is a revelation it means
[15:13] to understand to have
[15:17] an understanding now now now now if
[15:20] if a person a man was was
[15:24] literally naturally blind amen
[15:28] uh uh they have a a a
[15:32] a diminished level of understanding
[15:35] of where they may be or
[15:38] what's in front of them amen or
[15:42] what's going on around them amen because
[15:45] they really can't
[15:46] see amen but
[15:49] so so so so so being able to
[15:53] see a man like i said give you a
[15:56] perspective of what is happening
[16:00] around you so we take this this uh
[16:03] natural ability and we magnify it into
[16:07] the spirit world
[16:10] into a spirit realm to be
[16:13] able to see amen
[16:17] what uh what what the satan is doing in
[16:21] this
[16:21] hour that he has been doing to
[16:24] understand the tricks over thousands of
[16:28] years
[16:29] and even thousands of years ahead amen
[16:35] we see that
[16:38] amen that this is what
[16:41] jesus said i'll build my church on
[16:45] a revelation and the gates of hell shall
[16:48] not amen prevail against it
[16:52] so the counsel given by god
[16:55] is here that our spiritual eyesight
[16:58] must be sharp and clear
[17:02] in this age and so
[17:06] we realize that this is the most
[17:07] deceitful age deceitful
[17:11] i say we realize it but i i imagine some
[17:14] people just really don't realize it
[17:16] amen uh it is the most
[17:20] deceiving age
[17:24] the serpent beguiled eve
[17:29] the word beguiled means that he
[17:32] tricked her or seduced her
[17:37] into his thinking
[17:41] by how false teaching
[17:46] and when this happened amen
[17:50] a seed was planted
[17:53] into the womb of her mind into her
[17:57] thinking that caused her
[18:00] to disobey the word of god
[18:04] we're going to get into that a little
[18:05] further later let me stay with my notes
[18:07] i don't want to get ahead of myself
[18:10] so we see that the eyesight of this age
[18:14] by sending us to isaf
[18:17] in the form of the teaching of the word
[18:20] by a end-time vindicated prophet
[18:25] is that eagle anointing
[18:30] spoke about there in revelation
[18:34] amen so we see
[18:39] this while we must supply this
[18:44] ointment of the revealed word of the
[18:48] message of the owl to our eyesight
[18:50] of our standing or we will be walking
[18:54] around
[18:54] blind in this age
[18:58] like everyone else amen
[19:03] so we see in genesis
[19:08] you have one woman eve who was deceived
[19:13] in revelation you have a whole world who
[19:16] is deceived
[19:18] by the same thing but in a multiplied
[19:21] form
[19:22] as i said earlier genesis is the seed
[19:24] form
[19:25] of the same thing in revelation in a
[19:28] harvest form
[19:30] amen
[19:34] so we see here
[19:40] that the reason i'm sorry
[19:44] in 1963 let's go to 1963-0322
[19:49] the fifth seal i like to read from that
[19:52] 63 03 22 the fifth
[19:55] seal
[19:58] now while she's getting that the church
[20:01] goes up
[20:03] in a sense that is
[20:06] actually the start of the rapture i made
[20:09] a statement last week that we are
[20:11] potentially
[20:14] in the resurrection
[20:17] a resurrection is
[20:21] someone coming back from the dead
[20:26] a resurrection is something that
[20:30] uh uh is being raised from
[20:34] from the dead we see that the
[20:37] resurrection the most notable
[20:39] christ being resurrected amen
[20:43] after amen calvary
[20:46] amen there was another resurrection
[20:49] amen where he called lazarus
[20:52] from the grave lazarus
[20:57] was resurrected from the grave amen
[21:01] another form of resurrection
[21:05] amen is when
[21:08] you who are dead in sin
[21:12] and trespasses amen dad
[21:16] amen in your sins
[21:20] amen resurrected to
[21:23] a newness of life amen by the revelation
[21:28] of the word by an acceptance amen
[21:31] of calvary amen
[21:36] if this same spirit
[21:39] the bible says that raise christ from
[21:42] the dead
[21:43] dwells in you it will also
[21:47] quicken your mortal body quicken your
[21:50] mortal body
[21:52] amen so we we we realize that our
[21:56] bodies have to be quickened
[21:59] amen quicken means that it has
[22:04] has has to be ignited amen
[22:08] amen by the revelation of the word to
[22:11] receive
[22:12] a body change what quickens
[22:15] the holy spirit we're going to get a
[22:18] little deeper into that but
[22:20] what actually does it amen
[22:23] is the revealed truth that eagle
[22:26] anointing
[22:27] amen that is giving us a greater
[22:30] understanding of
[22:31] truth in this hour amen that takes
[22:34] us to a higher level in christ jesus
[22:39] who are seated with him in heavenly
[22:42] places
[22:43] amen as he is resurrected we become our
[22:47] level of thinking our level of
[22:50] understanding
[22:51] has risen from old dead denominational
[22:56] creeds
[22:57] amen to a understanding a revelation of
[23:01] who we
[23:01] are in this hour amen exactly where
[23:04] we're at in this hour what's going on in
[23:06] this hour
[23:07] amen a revelation of who we are
[23:12] amen that very words
[23:15] amen that very understanding that
[23:17] revelation is the actual that gives us
[23:19] that quickening power
[23:22] amen that literally begins to change
[23:27] amen we are being changed
[23:30] right now from glory to glory
[23:33] a lot of people are misunderstood amen
[23:36] by uh
[23:40] a lack of understanding
[23:43] that is that that that we will be uh
[23:46] uh uh uh we will receive a
[23:49] body change amen but before
[23:53] there's going to be a literal body
[23:55] change
[23:56] there must be a change amen in our
[24:00] thinking there must be a change
[24:05] in our attitude there must be a
[24:08] change amen in our walk
[24:13] we'll get into that a little bit what is
[24:15] our
[24:17] and then walk bible says that how can
[24:20] two
[24:20] walk except they agree
[24:23] amen to be in agreement
[24:27] amen with some one is to be in
[24:31] fellowship
[24:34] to be in fellowship amen
[24:38] let us move on so
[24:42] we see here if you have the quote that
[24:46] in the fifth seal 87 paragraph 87 i'm
[24:49] sorry
[24:50] but the reason that he reveals the
[24:53] reason that he reveals it
[24:56] he says as i understand it
[24:59] that it is because the mystery
[25:04] of the book of redemption
[25:07] as far as the antichrist being revealed
[25:12] and at the time the church is gone
[25:17] and these things don't even happen
[25:21] in the church age at all
[25:24] that's right they're away from
[25:28] the church age the church
[25:32] absolutely is raptured
[25:35] at this time talking about
[25:38] uh uh thank you my brother it's talking
[25:42] about here between revelation 4
[25:48] and revelation 19.
[25:54] amen
[25:57] church absolutely raptured at this time
[25:58] the church goes up in the
[26:00] fourth chapter of revelation and does
[26:04] not return
[26:06] till it comes back with its king
[26:10] in the 19th chapter this is the fifth
[26:12] seal now
[26:15] but these seals here
[26:21] are revealing
[26:24] what has been
[26:27] what is and what
[26:31] will be see
[26:35] and now what was to be
[26:38] for the church this age was
[26:41] revealed by these seals
[26:46] now watch what takes it
[26:50] so in a sense as i said
[26:54] the church is actually
[26:58] in the rapture because
[27:01] this is what has began to elevate her
[27:04] level of thinking
[27:07] amen to have
[27:11] the faith let me let me move on let me
[27:13] let me read them
[27:18] the voice of the message of the owl
[27:23] in other words you must first be caught
[27:25] up
[27:26] into the revelation of the word
[27:30] that will mature you
[27:34] into rapturing faith
[27:38] it will mature you into rapturing
[27:43] faith before you can
[27:46] physically change and
[27:49] caught up in a physical rapture
[27:52] at the last trump that is why the
[27:56] shout is the first part of the rapture
[28:00] it is to get your attention
[28:03] process because without the message
[28:07] there can be no faith released
[28:12] for a rapture to take place
[28:17] amen remember
[28:20] noah was in preparation
[28:24] for a hundred and twenty years
[28:27] before he physically
[28:30] taken up above
[28:33] judgment in the ship
[28:37] just as we have also been in preparation
[28:41] under a prophet's message for many years
[28:45] so if so so so so if we
[28:50] are caught up in the fourth chapter of
[28:54] revelation
[28:54] and return don't return until the 19th
[28:57] chapter
[28:59] then everything between the fourth
[29:01] chapter and the 19th chapter is a
[29:03] revelation being revealed to the bride
[29:06] right now
[29:08] amen what has been happening
[29:12] since we have been gathered
[29:15] up higher into this eagle message
[29:21] i made a statement last week
[29:27] that it's gathering time
[29:31] we are to begin matthew the 24th chapter
[29:35] the 18th first
[29:39] matthew the 24th chapter
[29:46] and the 18th verse
[29:53] says amen
[29:57] i'm sorry 24 28.
[30:09] the 28th
[30:16] amen it says
[30:20] for wheresoever the carcass is
[30:25] there will the eagles
[30:28] be gathered together now see
[30:32] we're talking about here an eagle
[30:33] anointing
[30:35] amen and and and and if you're up under
[30:39] the anointing of that
[30:41] eagle that eagle
[30:44] amen at feeding time they gathered
[30:50] together
[30:51] one of the things that i noticed amen
[30:54] that in this time
[30:56] we talking about those four
[31:00] stage insects and i made the statement
[31:03] about
[31:04] how that insect
[31:07] eats away at
[31:11] the bride tree what is it
[31:14] god said in joel that he's going to
[31:16] restore it
[31:18] but at the time of the harvest here
[31:21] comes
[31:22] an invasion of locusts
[31:26] to eat away at what god has been
[31:30] restoring
[31:32] what god has been restoring so we see in
[31:35] this
[31:36] hour that
[31:39] there's a great spirit that is being
[31:42] released
[31:44] amen upon the earth
[31:48] that it uh uh uh upon the people
[31:51] to cause a man a separation
[31:56] amen to cause turmoil we see that
[31:59] they're threatening
[32:02] to close the churches we see
[32:05] that amen
[32:09] as as a result of what we have right now
[32:14] this is that locust that is trying to
[32:18] break the fellowship by
[32:22] this chewing locust that is eating the
[32:25] leaves of the tree
[32:29] the leaves of the tree is the fellowship
[32:35] of the people now i'm not talking about
[32:38] just getting together and lollygagging
[32:41] i'm talking about the bride of jesus
[32:44] christ
[32:44] coming together to worship
[32:50] amen we talking about amen
[32:53] the the rustling in the mulberry tree
[32:58] that when the when the when the wind
[33:00] begins to blow through the leaves or the
[33:02] marbles you say what's that that's the
[33:04] people worshiping god the tree is in a
[33:08] revival
[33:12] so what is that that's a spirit released
[33:15] in this time
[33:17] amen in abundance to divide i said
[33:21] last week dividing families dividing
[33:24] co-workers friends don't even speak to
[33:27] each other no more
[33:30] i hear so many uh uh uh say
[33:34] well now you know what you're who your
[33:36] real friends are because of her
[33:38] politics that is the locust
[33:43] being released from the bottomless pit
[33:47] upon the people in this hour
[33:52] amen
[33:56] yes luke 17
[34:02] luke 17 first
[34:06] chapter um i have here
[34:17] and i was hoping to get through this
[34:18] today
[34:32] amen
[34:38] amen i think i might have nope
[34:41] i'm sorry 1737.
[34:50] luke 17 37.
[34:53] i was going to really go into that a
[34:54] little deeper but for the sake of time i
[34:56] won't but i want to read this scripture
[34:57] here
[34:58] and they answered and said unto him
[35:02] where lord and he said unto them
[35:07] wheresoever the body is tither
[35:11] with the eagles be gathered
[35:15] together amen
[35:18] the eagles will be gathered together so
[35:21] we see
[35:22] again here at this last day there is a
[35:26] gathering
[35:28] there is a gathering amen
[35:31] and not just a physical gathering
[35:36] amen but there is a fellowship
[35:39] of common thinking
[35:43] there is a a union a binding
[35:47] a man of of of of
[35:53] a binding of love around the scripture
[35:57] amos 3 3 says how can two walk together
[36:01] except they agree
[36:04] walking together has to do with
[36:07] fellowship
[36:09] amen as you walk with god
[36:14] and i walk with god
[36:18] we're both walking with god
[36:21] we are in fellowship with him
[36:26] so what does that do for us that binds
[36:29] us even closer together
[36:32] amen understanding that we are a
[36:36] bride making herself ready for a husband
[36:40] there is a invisible union going on
[36:44] a union a man with
[36:47] jesus christ and a union
[36:51] of a body amen of believers
[36:55] amen for a rapture there is a gathering
[36:59] there is a binding going on amen
[37:03] but we see the spirit of this time
[37:06] is trying to come against that
[37:12] but we will get into that a little bit
[37:15] more
[37:15] as we go along please go to the
[37:19] uh well i'll just read this because
[37:20] it'll probably be a little bit tough
[37:22] to go to the lady'll see in church age 3
[37:26] 27. now this messenger of malachi 4
[37:32] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[37:34] things
[37:35] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[37:38] hearts of the children
[37:39] to the fathers 1 2
[37:42] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[37:45] seven thunders in revelation 10
[37:48] which are the revelations contained
[37:51] in the seven seals
[37:55] it will be divinely revealed these
[37:58] divinely revealed mystery truths
[38:02] that will literally turn the
[38:06] hearts of the children to the
[38:08] pentecostal fathers
[38:10] exactly so so
[38:13] in order for the bride to go up in the
[38:15] rapture
[38:16] at the last trump she must first
[38:20] be part of the shout and the voice
[38:26] as the process of the rapture
[38:29] we must first be taken up higher
[38:33] so that we can be shown things that we
[38:35] have
[38:36] never seen before
[38:39] so that we can be shown amen
[38:43] uh and that is now
[38:46] that things that are to come
[38:50] and so from revelation 4 to revelation
[38:52] 19 that is what's being shown
[38:54] to us now at this time under this
[38:57] message
[38:59] so if you are sitting
[39:02] in a church
[39:06] that the only preaching
[39:09] is a good denominational
[39:13] living standards
[39:17] then that is not going to prepare you
[39:20] to receive faith because it is the
[39:24] mystery truths revealed
[39:27] to you that will literally do it
[39:32] we should teach good
[39:36] living standards i am not saying
[39:40] that you don't preach good wholesome
[39:44] living standards
[39:47] but that will come with the baptism of
[39:50] the holy ghost
[39:55] that will come with the baptism of the
[39:59] holy ghost
[40:04] but good living is
[40:08] just good living
[40:13] the rich young ruler lived good
[40:18] he he was he live had good moral
[40:22] standards
[40:24] but he didn't follow jesus in other
[40:28] words he wasn't obedient to the word
[40:33] the bible in matthew talks about
[40:37] those ten virgins five having oil in
[40:40] their lamps
[40:42] all had lamps but five had all in their
[40:45] lamps and
[40:47] the other five didn't
[40:50] so good moral living standards
[40:55] is just having the lamp
[41:00] it's just having the lamp
[41:03] because see when you get the oil in your
[41:06] lamp
[41:06] what does it do it will light
[41:09] a path in the darkness that you can see
[41:14] see the holy ghost in you
[41:18] would do what it would lead you
[41:22] and guide you into all truth
[41:29] you can't have the holy ghost
[41:32] and bug the word of god
[41:37] now you can have a good feeling
[41:41] because the rain falls on the just as
[41:43] well as the unjust
[41:46] you can speak in tongues and have dreams
[41:50] and
[41:51] visions and shout and go to church and
[41:53] have a wonderful time
[41:56] and fee and and fear and i mean
[41:59] just have a ball just
[42:02] worshiping the rain rain is coming down
[42:06] everybody is just worshiping
[42:13] but what is it quickening
[42:17] what is it quickening on the inside
[42:21] is the word life growing
[42:24] in you
[42:28] are you hungering that little lily is
[42:31] hungering for life
[42:33] it is pressing up through all of the
[42:36] darkness
[42:38] reaching to the sun
[42:42] amen it comes it shoots up
[42:46] a little spurt and maybe one or two
[42:48] little leaves
[42:51] amen but it's getting it's
[42:54] it's it's it's raised from the sun
[42:57] and the rain falls on it and as it just
[43:00] wants
[43:01] more and more and more
[43:06] but the weed does the same thing
[43:13] but what is it is it are you producing
[43:17] fruit
[43:19] are you growing and producing
[43:24] fruit
[43:31] amen the seed that was planted
[43:37] amen there is there's let me put it this
[43:39] way there's only one form of eternal
[43:42] life
[43:44] amen and that seed amen
[43:48] is was was was was
[43:52] god himself zoe his own life
[43:56] that is the spirit that must be in you
[44:00] and that seed amen would do what lead
[44:03] you and guide you into all truth
[44:06] let me go on because we're gonna we're
[44:09] gonna we're gonna break into
[44:10] a little bit more of this time is
[44:13] getting away from me already
[44:15] exodus 19.
[44:19] you have seen what i did unto the
[44:22] egyptians
[44:23] 1904 exodus 19 4.
[44:29] ye have seen what i did unto the
[44:31] egyptians
[44:33] and how i bear you on eagle's wings
[44:39] and brought you into
[44:43] myself so we see this eagle anointing
[44:47] was even back there
[44:48] amen with moses
[44:53] he told i beared you up on eagles wings
[44:57] and brought you out of what dead
[44:59] conditions of
[45:00] bondage out of egypt where
[45:04] into the light of a new land
[45:09] amen that's what's going on today
[45:14] amen let's see here i want to skip down
[45:17] a little bit
[45:18] for the sake of time and they heard a
[45:20] voice of god
[45:22] read from genesis uh 3 8 and they heard
[45:26] the voice of god lord
[45:28] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[45:30] evening in the cool of the day and adam
[45:32] and his wife hid themselves from the
[45:35] presence of the lord god
[45:37] amongst the trees of the garden
[45:42] we see that
[45:46] eve amen
[45:50] saw that the tree was good for food and
[45:52] it was pleasant to the eye
[45:55] there we go again pleasant to the eye
[45:58] and the tree uh was to be desired to
[46:01] make one wise
[46:02] so what did eve do eve took education
[46:07] and man's thinking over the word of god
[46:12] so when when this happens what did it do
[46:16] we see that it broke fellowship with god
[46:21] it broke fellowship with god in the
[46:23] beginning man
[46:24] and a woman and woman listened to each
[46:27] other
[46:28] to and uh uh uh there was there was
[46:31] there was a union
[46:33] there was an order a man
[46:36] in the garden there was no strife
[46:40] there was no arguing there was no
[46:41] bickering there was it was
[46:43] it was it was peaceful
[46:47] but we see what happened is she began to
[46:49] listen
[46:50] to another voice apart from the word of
[46:54] god
[46:55] they hearkened to a voice that conveyed
[46:58] an idea
[46:59] that actually sounded quite reasonable
[47:04] quite reasonable
[47:08] the problem was the idea was contrary to
[47:11] god's word
[47:14] this is why we had to have
[47:19] in this age a restoration
[47:23] this is why we had to have
[47:27] a man an eagle anointed in this age that
[47:31] would
[47:31] take us and raise us above
[47:36] amen the nonsense
[47:39] amen that is being brother brother
[47:41] brother precious brother quaker
[47:44] said sunday that we must be in tune
[47:48] now when when when tuning a radio we all
[47:51] know
[47:52] if you're looking for a specific station
[47:58] and you may not know the call
[48:01] numbers or whatever you go up and down
[48:04] up and down the dial you're turning the
[48:06] dial
[48:08] and you hear all kinds of voices
[48:14] one may sound real good
[48:17] and you it may catch your attention
[48:20] and you stop just for a little bit
[48:24] nine times out of ten if you stop for a
[48:26] little while and begin to listen you're
[48:28] gonna leave it there
[48:30] that's what eve did
[48:34] she stopped and she listened
[48:37] just for a little while and it began to
[48:40] sound good to her
[48:45] now it began to sound good to her she
[48:47] began to
[48:49] receive a man the anointing
[48:53] that it was projecting the spirit that
[48:56] it was projecting
[48:58] and what did it do it planted a seed
[49:00] that altered her thinking
[49:07] contrary to god's word
[49:12] and by this my brothers and sisters what
[49:15] did it do
[49:17] we see this was the beginning of the
[49:19] fall amen
[49:21] that caused them to break fellowship
[49:25] to lose fellowship with god
[49:30] notice carefully here eve had received
[49:33] what seemed to be a higher education
[49:39] to that of the word education is all
[49:43] right
[49:45] science is all right
[49:49] but you can't put it above the word of
[49:56] god
[49:58] that is that tree of knowledge
[50:01] and good and evil
[50:06] i read earlier eve took
[50:09] of that tree
[50:13] by her receiving into her
[50:17] thinking her mind
[50:21] and then there was a seed
[50:24] of discrepancy to the word planted
[50:29] that caused her to go contrary
[50:35] and the ultimate end was what
[50:39] they began to realize the shame
[50:43] of their nakedness
[50:48] the shame of their nakedness
[50:53] see before then they had a veil
[50:57] that they didn't they didn't see it
[50:58] because there was no shame in it
[51:02] there was no shame so they didn't even
[51:06] realize
[51:12] revelation 3
[51:20] amen
[51:23] 17 because thou says that i am rich and
[51:27] increase with goods and have need of
[51:30] nothing
[51:31] and know it's not that thou
[51:35] art wretched and miserable
[51:39] and poor now look at this
[51:43] and blind and naked
[51:48] this is
[51:52] this lady of seeing church age this
[51:55] is not the bride why because the
[51:58] bride of jesus christ has received
[52:03] man what has taken place amen
[52:06] and this is she is she is she is up
[52:09] under
[52:09] an eagle anointing so up under that
[52:13] eagle anointing
[52:14] what is happening under that eagle
[52:16] there's a counseling going on
[52:21] revelation 3 18 he says i
[52:24] counsel thee to buy of me
[52:28] gold tried in the fire
[52:31] that thou mayest be rich now see
[52:34] in revelation seeing they they
[52:38] they're rich with what rich with goods
[52:42] and have need of nothing but you see
[52:45] here there's another group that he's
[52:47] talking about here in revelation
[52:49] in in the 18th verse
[52:52] that is being counseled amen by me gold
[52:56] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[52:59] rich
[53:00] and white raymond oh my
[53:04] it's a whole different kind of rich
[53:07] that thou mayest be closed
[53:11] no longer really like that that cloth
[53:14] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[53:17] not appear
[53:22] and anoint thine eyes with i said
[53:27] that thou mayest may see
[53:32] amen so the anointing
[53:35] of the assad is what that eagle
[53:38] anointing
[53:41] being under that eagle anointing
[53:44] which is what a special teaching
[53:49] to do what to produce a rapturing
[53:54] faith
[53:57] but we see that when that happens
[54:01] that rapturing faith that that that that
[54:05] caucus that food amen at this time has
[54:08] been put out and the eagles
[54:11] amen are hungry thirsty
[54:14] amen commanded to eat
[54:18] and be full eat amen because
[54:21] these literal truths is what's going to
[54:24] literally change your body
[54:30] but what's happening there's an invasion
[54:33] of locusts
[54:37] to divide the people
[54:41] to separate them to interrupt
[54:46] what god is doing but he can't
[54:51] because of the teaching
[54:55] of the message
[55:00] we're not blind to his tricks anymore
[55:05] why because we have an eagle anointing
[55:09] we are under a prophetic anointing
[55:15] amen we know that people
[55:22] sometimes can disagree with one another
[55:26] just like i was talking about sometimes
[55:28] when people disagree with one another
[55:29] what does it do it breaks their
[55:30] fellowship
[55:32] it breaks their association
[55:35] they can no longer walk together
[55:39] because to truly be in fellowship and in
[55:43] oneness
[55:44] with someone who have been
[55:48] first you must first be in a union in an
[55:51] agreement an agreement is a spiritual
[55:55] thing
[55:56] of your thoughts and someone else's
[55:59] thoughts being in the same way of
[56:01] thinking and reasoning
[56:03] amen one of the hardest things in this
[56:06] world is for people to agree
[56:09] on anything everybody has an opinion
[56:15] but we have an absolute
[56:19] there is an absolute
[56:25] you don't know what it is love the lord
[56:28] with all your heart
[56:33] says lean not into your own
[56:35] understanding
[56:36] don't fall out with people
[56:40] that's the locust
[56:44] we're supposed to be producing fruit
[56:48] love joy peace patience
[56:52] long suffering kindness
[56:57] in spite of what the locusts are doing
[56:59] why because they can't touch the bride
[57:01] we'll get into that
[57:05] it's in revelation 9.
[57:09] as i said before amos 3 3 how can two
[57:11] walk together except they agree
[57:15] walking together is symbolic of being in
[57:18] agreement
[57:22] genesis 5 22
[57:27] enoch walked with god
[57:32] after he begot methuselah 300 years
[57:36] and begot sons and daughters and
[57:39] all the days of enoch was 365 years
[57:45] and enoch walked with god
[57:49] and he was not for god took
[57:52] him
[57:57] walking with god
[58:01] translates you from
[58:04] mortal to immortality
[58:08] i'm gonna say that again when you walk
[58:12] with
[58:12] god it changes you
[58:19] when you walk with god it
[58:22] elevates you
[58:26] the more you walk with god the more you
[58:29] rise above the thinking
[58:33] of this world
[58:36] the more you walk with god you rise
[58:40] above the thinking
[58:42] of denominational creeds and dogmas
[58:51] because you're in fellowship
[58:55] with the very life
[58:59] of god zoe
[59:03] you're in fellowship
[59:07] enoch is a type of us
[59:10] in this age remember
[59:14] he said i read there in the lady of sin
[59:16] and said uh
[59:17] uh uh that the bride will go up before
[59:21] any tribulation but what's happening
[59:24] here is
[59:25] there's a revelation going on
[59:28] amen of of what has has happened
[59:32] what is happening and what's to come
[59:36] see to do what produce a rapturing
[59:40] faith that's what these seals is
[59:42] literally turning our hearts
[59:44] amen so enoch typed but that before
[59:48] noah and the judgment of the flood
[59:53] enoch walked with god and received the
[59:57] body chain
[1:00:09] when eve agreed with the serpent
[1:00:15] and disagree with the word of god
[1:00:18] then that is what broke fellowship
[1:00:22] between god and man at the beginning
[1:00:26] so it would have to take man
[1:00:30] to come back into full
[1:00:33] agreement with the thought
[1:00:37] and mind of god in order to restore
[1:00:42] fellowship of what man lost
[1:00:46] in the garden
[1:00:51] a perfect oneness
[1:00:54] turn to the message if you will
[1:00:57] god's perfecting church 1954
[1:01:03] december 4. preach december 4.
[1:01:11] in 1954
[1:01:16] paragraph 24
[1:01:20] this is all about relationship of man
[1:01:24] being restored back with god again by
[1:01:27] the means
[1:01:28] of being restored to the correct
[1:01:30] thinking
[1:01:33] of the word this is that eagle anointing
[1:01:38] to rise above that's lifting us
[1:01:42] up into heavenly places
[1:01:46] amen notice you have
[1:01:50] those four beasts the eagle being
[1:01:55] the ark the lion the ox the man
[1:01:59] and the eagle notice the eagle is the
[1:02:02] only one
[1:02:04] of those that is able to take flight
[1:02:08] all the other three are all earthbound
[1:02:12] that eagle is the only one that is able
[1:02:14] to
[1:02:15] to to fly above amen
[1:02:18] and see far amen
[1:02:25] it says here 24th chapter
[1:02:34] amen now notice here
[1:02:37] just a little farther as he went on
[1:02:41] god making himself known through
[1:02:43] fatherhood
[1:02:44] through sonship and through the holy
[1:02:47] spirit
[1:02:50] now see he brought into himself a blood
[1:02:53] cell
[1:02:56] wrapped himself into
[1:03:00] this broke forth a blood
[1:03:04] at calvary throwed out his blood
[1:03:09] that he might bring through this blood
[1:03:13] cleansing by the same
[1:03:16] atonement taking
[1:03:19] every sinner and cleanse
[1:03:22] him bring him into
[1:03:26] a fellowship that he can
[1:03:29] talk with man
[1:03:33] walk with man
[1:03:36] like he did in the garden of eden
[1:03:40] before sin ever come on the earth
[1:03:46] and our relationship is restored to
[1:03:50] jehovah through the offering of his son
[1:03:54] the lord jesus
[1:03:58] this is all about relationship of man
[1:04:00] being restored back to god
[1:04:03] as i said sunday i made the statement
[1:04:07] and i had this already in my notes
[1:04:11] the three things that man lost
[1:04:14] when he left eden
[1:04:18] he lost eternal life
[1:04:22] that had to be purchased
[1:04:25] lost fellowship with god
[1:04:29] that had to be restored and he
[1:04:32] lost dominion over the earth
[1:04:35] so we see the cleansing restored
[1:04:42] partial fellowship
[1:04:46] it was god it was emmanuel
[1:04:50] god with man when christ
[1:04:54] amen took that blood cell wrapped
[1:04:56] himself
[1:04:58] in a blood cell created a body amen he
[1:05:01] was able to walk
[1:05:03] once again with man with
[1:05:06] man but it wasn't until
[1:05:11] amen calvary
[1:05:15] and the resurrection and then those 120
[1:05:20] receiving the holy ghost that he became
[1:05:22] god in man so what now
[1:05:25] it was that seed being planted into that
[1:05:28] earth again
[1:05:30] to produce what that tree
[1:05:34] to begin amen uh-oh that tree began to
[1:05:37] sprout
[1:05:38] new wings no new life once again
[1:05:45] so that at the harvest time amen
[1:05:49] it's no longer just adam it's no longer
[1:05:52] just
[1:05:52] eve but it's a gathered church
[1:05:56] and a many member body amen
[1:05:59] all producing fruit what is in fruit
[1:06:05] seed to reproduce
[1:06:09] the word again
[1:06:12] in that fruit is seed
[1:06:16] so what does that mean that in you
[1:06:23] with the baptism motor go holy ghost you
[1:06:26] have dominion the potential
[1:06:29] the power lies within you
[1:06:33] to produce
[1:06:36] once again
[1:06:40] the the the power amen lies within you
[1:06:44] amen to be amateur gods upon the earth
[1:06:49] god in man
[1:06:54] amen these things
[1:06:58] this level of thinking
[1:07:02] comes by a prophetic anointing
[1:07:09] so when within uh you
[1:07:13] so when within you you disbelieve
[1:07:16] god's word
[1:07:20] the very core of what you are
[1:07:25] as a spirit and soul
[1:07:28] is separated from god and fellowship
[1:07:39] by you and god being different
[1:07:42] in your spirit of agreement
[1:07:47] and everything that disagrees with god
[1:07:51] becomes separated in fellowship from god
[1:07:55] and anything that's separated
[1:07:58] dies
[1:08:01] dominion over the earth that was what
[1:08:04] adam and eve
[1:08:08] to have full control over the earth
[1:08:12] over all nature over bird over the
[1:08:14] animal life
[1:08:15] over the fish life over the body life
[1:08:18] over the wind
[1:08:19] over the weather there was no
[1:08:22] death anywhere
[1:08:25] genesis 1 28 god blessed them
[1:08:29] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[1:08:31] multiply and replenish the earth
[1:08:34] and subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:08:36] fish to see over the files of the air
[1:08:39] and over every living thing
[1:08:42] that moveth upon the earth
[1:08:46] amen so back to revelation
[1:08:51] three eighteen i counsel thee to buy me
[1:08:53] gold tried in the fire and that may be
[1:08:55] rich and white raiment
[1:08:57] that thou mayest be closed
[1:09:01] they became naked in genesis
[1:09:05] but here the lord is telling us how to
[1:09:08] be clothed
[1:09:10] again and that the shame of thy
[1:09:14] nakedness do not appear
[1:09:17] and anoint thine eyes what i sat so that
[1:09:20] we can see
[1:09:23] in genesis eve eyes of understanding
[1:09:26] will open
[1:09:28] by obedience to a false
[1:09:32] word of the serpent
[1:09:36] her eyes was open to a
[1:09:39] false word which caused what
[1:09:44] for her to realize that she was
[1:09:47] naked there was a shame attached to her
[1:09:50] nakedness
[1:09:53] cause here to become naked
[1:09:57] but is how in revelation 3 we find that
[1:09:59] the church eyes are being
[1:10:01] opened being body atonement
[1:10:07] and that is what closes her again
[1:10:11] we want to look at how we are to have
[1:10:14] the right
[1:10:14] spirit within us
[1:10:17] in this hour we can be obedient to the
[1:10:22] word
[1:10:23] of god because there is a great power
[1:10:26] that is released by god when a person
[1:10:29] comes in full
[1:10:30] obedience to the word of god
[1:10:36] in the message blind bartimaeus
[1:10:42] 1954-0402
[1:10:48] 1954.04202.0402
[1:10:54] while she's finding that i want to move
[1:10:55] on it says
[1:10:57] but to continue in obedience
[1:11:01] to the word requires a spirit
[1:11:06] of obedience to first
[1:11:11] be in the person there must
[1:11:14] first be a spirit of obedience
[1:11:17] there is a spirit associated with
[1:11:21] obedience to god's word just as there is
[1:11:25] a
[1:11:25] spirit that causes a person
[1:11:28] to obey what the devil wants them to
[1:11:34] there is a spirit associated with
[1:11:37] disobedience just as there is a
[1:11:41] spirit associated with obedience
[1:11:46] either way depending on what spirit is
[1:11:49] in you
[1:11:50] you will be obedient to something
[1:11:55] eve obeyed the serpent because
[1:11:58] something that changed within her spirit
[1:12:04] you are going to listen to somebody
[1:12:11] people so often says well why do you
[1:12:14] listen
[1:12:14] why do you do everybody
[1:12:18] is listening to somebody
[1:12:26] it's just you have to be in tune with
[1:12:28] the right voice
[1:12:30] but what's the right voice that's the
[1:12:34] question
[1:12:37] to be obedient with the wrong voice
[1:12:42] in this hour will cause you some trouble
[1:12:48] but you must be in obedience
[1:12:51] to the voice of god to the word of god
[1:12:56] there is your absolute god's word
[1:13:04] let me continue
[1:13:07] i'm not going to be before you much
[1:13:08] longer
[1:13:11] where when in ephesians 2 2 says wherein
[1:13:14] in time past ye walked according to the
[1:13:17] course of this
[1:13:18] world according to the prince and the
[1:13:20] powers of the
[1:13:21] air the first
[1:13:25] the i'm sorry according to the prince of
[1:13:27] power
[1:13:28] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:13:30] children of disobedience
[1:13:33] see the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:13:37] children
[1:13:38] of disobedience there is where the
[1:13:41] spirit
[1:13:42] in the people that cause them to be
[1:13:45] disobedient to god's word
[1:13:51] and so there must be a spirit in this
[1:13:54] hour in the believer
[1:13:58] that causes him or her to come
[1:14:01] back into the obedience of the word
[1:14:04] again
[1:14:08] if this same spirit
[1:14:12] that raised christ from the dead dwells
[1:14:15] in you
[1:14:18] it will quicken your mortal bodies as
[1:14:21] enoch walked with god in fellowship with
[1:14:25] god
[1:14:25] he was changed there was a change going
[1:14:30] taking place
[1:14:30] as he was walking in the right spirit
[1:14:35] as he was walking in obedience to god
[1:14:40] and he was he received a body change
[1:14:44] he was no more so today
[1:14:49] as we're walking in the reveal light of
[1:14:53] the gospel
[1:14:55] of this time of this age
[1:15:01] amen we're being changed
[1:15:05] amen as we as we fellowship
[1:15:10] with god as we fellowship
[1:15:14] amen the word of god
[1:15:18] is returning us back into a complete
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:22] fellowship
[1:15:24] so that we are literally being changed
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:28] as the word of god amen is changing us
[1:15:32] as we walk in complete fellowship with
[1:15:35] god
[1:15:37] it's not going to just happen all of a
[1:15:39] sudden because you want it to
[1:15:43] there must be a sacrifice
[1:15:47] there must be a dying out
[1:15:51] there must be a calvary
[1:15:54] there must be a a calvary of your old
[1:15:58] denominational thinking there must be a
[1:16:01] calvary amen of your own will
[1:16:07] not my will lord but thy will be done
[1:16:13] there must be a dying out to your own
[1:16:17] intellectual thinking amen
[1:16:21] and you must submit yourself amen to the
[1:16:25] holy spirit
[1:16:26] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:16:33] there is where the change is going to
[1:16:35] take place
[1:16:38] in this hour it takes
[1:16:42] an eagle anointing
[1:16:45] not a man anointing not an oxidanting
[1:16:50] not a lion anointing it's going to take
[1:16:53] an eagle anointing
[1:16:55] a prophetic anointing
[1:17:01] to produce the faith
[1:17:05] that it's going to take in this hour
[1:17:08] but we see in contrast
[1:17:13] everything that god is doing everything
[1:17:16] that he's promised
[1:17:18] in this hour there at this time
[1:17:23] an invasion from the bottomless pit
[1:17:27] these demon powers
[1:17:30] that is coming against the bride
[1:17:36] where everything is saying that she
[1:17:37] should be gathering together around the
[1:17:39] caucus
[1:17:41] gathering together in worship around the
[1:17:43] world
[1:17:44] coming together in fellowship with one
[1:17:47] another
[1:17:47] and in a perfect union without god
[1:17:52] we see that these demon powers are
[1:17:54] dividing
[1:17:56] tearing down everything that he's doing
[1:17:59] but joe said he said i will restore
[1:18:04] i will restore
[1:18:07] i want to read this last in closing i
[1:18:09] won't be able to get through this
[1:18:12] not even close i'm sorry
[1:18:16] it's first samuel 15
[1:18:20] 17 chapter
[1:18:23] i'm sorry let me do this first romans
[1:18:28] romans 5 19
[1:18:31] then after that go to first samuel 15.
[1:18:36] start at the 17th verse romans 5 19
[1:18:40] says for as by one man's
[1:18:44] disobedience many were made
[1:18:47] sinners so by the obedience of
[1:18:51] one shall many be made righteous
[1:18:56] look at how powerful obedience
[1:19:00] to the word of god is
[1:19:05] also look at how powerful disobedience
[1:19:08] can be
[1:19:08] by one man's disobedience many were made
[1:19:12] sinners
[1:19:14] so by obedience of one
[1:19:17] shall many be made righteous
[1:19:23] obedience to the word
[1:19:29] what did the serpent offer
[1:19:33] creed dogmas
[1:19:37] it it it offered
[1:19:41] good things it it it offered
[1:19:50] soup supples and
[1:19:53] women's day men's day
[1:20:01] family and friends no i got no problem
[1:20:04] with all of these things
[1:20:06] if you're coming together
[1:20:10] around the revealed truth but what
[1:20:13] happened is we had to come up with all
[1:20:15] of these
[1:20:16] gimmicks and different things because
[1:20:19] the world don't excite the people no
[1:20:21] more
[1:20:24] just the word of god don't excite the
[1:20:26] people don't know why don't the word
[1:20:28] tell why the word don't excite the
[1:20:30] people no more
[1:20:34] because it's not an eagle anointing
[1:20:39] where the caucus is the eagles will be
[1:20:41] gathered together
[1:20:44] now i'm not saying that you don't feel
[1:20:45] rain like i said before
[1:20:49] they off we all the the the the weed the
[1:20:53] wheat
[1:20:54] everything feels the rain
[1:21:00] but there has to be a prophetic
[1:21:01] anointing for you to be able to
[1:21:03] see your eye of understanding is
[1:21:06] open that will literally give you a
[1:21:09] faith
[1:21:09] for what is taking place in this album
[1:21:14] samuel the first 15th chapter samuel
[1:21:16] said
[1:21:17] when thou was a little in thine own
[1:21:20] sight
[1:21:20] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:21:23] of israel
[1:21:24] and the lord anointed the king over
[1:21:26] israel and the lord
[1:21:28] sent thee on a journey and said go and
[1:21:31] utterly destroy the sinners
[1:21:35] the amalekites and fight against them
[1:21:37] until
[1:21:38] they were until they be consumed
[1:21:42] before then did its thou not
[1:21:45] wherefore then did it thou not obey
[1:21:49] the voice of the lord but did his
[1:21:52] fly upon the spoils and did its
[1:21:56] evil in the sight of the lord and saul
[1:21:59] said to samuel yea i have
[1:22:02] obeyed the voice
[1:22:06] of the lord
[1:22:11] and have gone the way
[1:22:14] which the lord has sent me
[1:22:17] and have brought a guy the king
[1:22:20] of a malachi and have utterly destroyed
[1:22:24] the amalekites but the people took
[1:22:28] of the spoils sheep oxen
[1:22:32] the chief of the things which should
[1:22:35] have been
[1:22:36] utterly destroyed to sacrifice
[1:22:40] unto the lord thy god in gilgal
[1:22:45] and samuel said
[1:22:48] hath the lord as great
[1:22:52] delight in burnt offerings
[1:22:56] and sacrifices as
[1:22:59] in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:23:04] the lord has great delight
[1:23:08] in a burnt offering and sacrifices
[1:23:13] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:23:18] behold it is better
[1:23:24] to obey is better than a sacrifice
[1:23:28] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:23:33] for rebellion is as the sin
[1:23:37] of witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:23:39] iniquity and idolatry
[1:23:42] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:23:45] the lord
[1:23:46] he has also rejected thee
[1:23:49] from being king amen
[1:23:55] and you know we are considered as kings
[1:23:57] and priests
[1:24:00] and saul said unto samuel i have sinned
[1:24:05] for i have transgressed the commandment
[1:24:09] of the lord
[1:24:11] and thy words because i feared
[1:24:16] the people and obeyed
[1:24:19] their voice
[1:24:23] and disobeyed the voice of god
[1:24:30] last quote in closing
[1:24:34] go to the token 1963
[1:24:42] 0901
[1:24:46] no 901 uh paragraph 338
[1:24:50] then i want you to go to the token again
[1:24:53] preached in 1964
[1:24:57] or 0208 you see when you choose to obey
[1:25:00] the word of god
[1:25:03] when you choose to obey the word of god
[1:25:07] then that is what brings the spirit
[1:25:10] of the word into you when you
[1:25:14] choose to obey the word of god that is
[1:25:17] what brings the spirit of the word
[1:25:20] into you and then that causes you to
[1:25:23] continue
[1:25:25] in obedience the token preached

[1:25:38] has been made and been accepted
[1:25:43] it the purchase have been made
[1:25:47] and accepted
[1:25:50] now you can't get the token from the
[1:25:53] railroad fare until you pay the price
[1:25:57] now the price has been paid for us
[1:26:02] and the only way you're going to
[1:26:06] pay the price is paid
[1:26:11] amen that's right
[1:26:15] he says
[1:26:21] believe it
[1:26:25] accept it
[1:26:29] full obedience to the word of god will
[1:26:33] entitle you
[1:26:34] to the token
[1:26:38] full obedience not part
[1:26:43] as it at not part of it
[1:26:46] as far as your denomination goes but
[1:26:49] all of it full obedience to the word
[1:26:52] which is christ which is christ
[1:26:57] brings you into christ
[1:27:01] full obedience to the word of god
[1:27:04] will entitle you to the token

[1:27:13] the word
[1:27:15] which is christ brings you
[1:27:19] into christ
[1:27:22] amen the token preached again in 1964
[1:27:28] february 8th
[1:27:32] on this wise full obedience to the word
[1:27:36] brings god the word eternal
[1:27:40] in you and that is the token
[1:27:44] when the word is in you
[1:27:48] it's christ in
[1:27:51] you full obedience
[1:27:56] amen to the word
[1:28:00] is christ in you amen
[1:28:05] i have a few more here but i'm not going
[1:28:08] to go in
[1:28:08] go on any further amen our time has
[1:28:11] gotten away from us
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:21] so we see in closing
[1:28:24] that
[1:28:27] amen we we we we're trying to show you
[1:28:31] that the obedience
[1:28:35] to the word in this hour
[1:28:39] amen is the very thing
[1:28:42] amen that's going to bring revelation
[1:28:46] 3 18 into manifestation
[1:28:50] to anoint thine eyes
[1:28:53] with isil
[1:28:58] talking earlier about those 10 virgins
[1:29:02] they go out to meet the bridegroom what
[1:29:05] is this
[1:29:07] this is the rapture so
[1:29:11] five have their their lamps and their
[1:29:14] lamps
