[46:21] a single man before we got married
[46:26] we were on the way to church one friday
[46:28] night
[46:30] and as we were driving to church
[46:34] i took a different route don't know why
[46:36] i did it but i just did it
[46:38] and we ended up in an accident where a
[46:41] car was
[46:42] turned over on its um on the top and we
[46:45] were sliding down the street and
[46:47] um by the grace of god we both made it
[46:50] out with just scratches
[46:52] and man uh one i think i had one on one
[46:55] hand he had
[46:56] had a scratch on the other hand and uh
[46:59] but
[46:59] you know way back then i believe satan
[47:02] uh
[47:02] must have had a little glimpse of the
[47:04] future
[47:06] and uh he signed his demons to try to
[47:09] wipe us
[47:09] out before we could get started and uh
[47:13] you know but the the hand of god stayed
[47:15] the
[47:16] enemy and i'm grateful for that tonight
[47:21] and for years we have uh done ministry
[47:24] together
[47:25] for years uh but the lord has

[50:29] brother troy said something uh the other
[50:32] night he say you know it's like
[50:34] it's just two fishes and uh that's all
[50:37] it is tonight
[50:38] uh it's the same two fishes right but
[50:41] you know what made the difference
[50:43] jesus broke it blessed it
[50:47] he gave it to the disciples and and the
[50:50] folks
[50:51] and the disciples gave it see now if
[50:54] jesus don't break it and give it to me
[50:55] then i ain't got nothing to give you
[50:58] but but as long as he's constantly
[51:00] breaking it
[51:01] you know and giving it to the disciples
[51:03] we can constantly feed you and here's
[51:06] here's the thing too uh
[51:08] uh uh when it was all said and done they
[51:10] was able to take up baskets
[51:13] so so we we we pray that we could fool
[51:16] you up tonight
[51:17] and that y'all could take some stuff
[51:19] home with you

[51:28] see everybody

[51:58] brother jack
[52:00] we want to look at our revelations
[52:01] philippians chapter 2
[52:03] and revelation revelations chapter one
[52:08] uh philippians
[52:12] chapter two i thought it had this way i
[52:15] wouldn't have to
[52:17] uh if they could pull it up for me i
[52:20] don't have to flip to this bible
[52:25] uh we want to start at the fifth
[52:30] verse
[52:33] it says let let this mind be in you
[52:35] which was also in christ
[52:36] jesus who being in the form of god
[52:41] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[52:43] god
[52:43] keep going we're going to the 11th verse
[52:46] but made himself of no reputation and
[52:48] took upon him the form of a servant
[52:50] and was made in the likeness of men
[52:54] and being found in fashion as a man he
[52:57] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[53:00] the death
[53:00] even the death of the cross
[53:04] wherefore god also has highly exalted
[53:06] him and given him a name
[53:08] which is above every name that at the
[53:12] name of jesus every knee should bow
[53:15] of the things in heaven and the things
[53:17] in earth and the things
[53:18] under the earth one more and that
[53:21] every tongue shall confess jesus christ
[53:24] is lord
[53:25] to the glory of god the father now let
[53:28] us look at revelations chapter 1.
[53:34] revelation 1 17 and 18 everybody have it
[53:39] it says and when i saw him i fell at his
[53:41] feet as dead
[53:42] and he laid his right hand upon me
[53:45] saying unto me fear not
[53:47] i'm the first and the last um he that
[53:50] liveth and was
[53:51] dead and behold i'm alive forevermore

[56:39] brother jack
[56:40] mentioned this uh these services to me
[56:42] um
[56:43] maybe a few weeks ago this little
[56:44] thought just kind of uh
[56:46] just dropped down in my heart and it's
[56:48] just kind of been a
[56:50] little minute uh we we realized there's
[56:53] this
[56:53] there's so many ways and directions you
[56:57] can go
[56:58] amen on um on easter
[57:02] and and preach different subjects and
[57:05] things of that nature one thing i'm
[57:06] grateful for
[57:08] is is a a revelation my mother-in-law
[57:10] mentioned it uh
[57:12] we we thank god that we've we surpassed
[57:16] uh easter eggs and bunny rabbits and
[57:19] things of that nature
[57:21] i was listening to a friend of mine and
[57:23] i kind of understand but
[57:26] it it's like you you you don't see the
[57:28] real
[57:29] picture uh easter had nothing to do with
[57:32] if you think about it uh a bunny rabbit
[57:35] come on
[57:36] come on come on you know it we we're
[57:39] talking about a lamb
[57:41] and blood it was bloody it wasn't
[57:43] nothing nice
[57:45] it wasn't it wasn't nothing purity
[57:48] and things of that nature you know
[57:51] uh you go back to genesis i think
[57:53] brother
[57:54] quick who us made that reference last
[57:57] night
[57:57] see chapter when when um
[58:00] um those two brothers uh uh
[58:04] were brought to a place where they had
[58:06] to bring up their sacrifices to
[58:08] god you know one one brother right
[58:11] he he brought the fruits in the field
[58:13] and
[58:14] and and the flowers and and all of that
[58:17] and god said ah
[58:18] right that's not it that's not what it's
[58:22] going to be all about
[58:23] it's it's not going to be anything that
[58:25] that that that
[58:26] man could look back and say that he did
[58:29] within himself
[58:30] it's not going to be anything beautiful
[58:33] that
[58:33] that will not be the revelation that
[58:35] moves down
[58:36] through the history of the scriptures
[58:39] right
[58:40] but but a lamb was slain according to
[58:42] the bible before the foundation of the
[58:44] world right
[58:45] that that was the thing that was in the
[58:47] mind of god
[58:48] hallelujah is that right a lamb
[58:52] and and us being identified with blood
[58:55] so we're grateful this this evening
[58:58] right
[58:58] that is that we have the revelation of
[59:00] blood amen
[59:02] sister dixon used to sing this song it's
[59:04] dripping with blood
[59:05] yes glory and we talk about a bleeding
[59:09] bloody word tonight
[59:10] all right amen amen eagles eager
[59:14] something about an eagle they want
[59:15] something bloody something that's fresh
[59:19] killed and all of that amen uh
[59:22] we want to maybe get started and try not
[59:24] to hold us too long
[59:26] thank god brother jack uh started the
[59:28] service early so i got at least about
[59:30] two hours though
[59:31] [Laughter]
[59:34] praise the lord but um one of the things
[59:37] we we
[59:38] find um and uh we maybe
[59:41] i want to maybe start out and and read a
[59:44] couple of things and we'll pick up
[59:46] some statements just see how god leads
[59:48] us from there
[59:50] right uh he says you know uh in the
[59:53] message
[59:54] uh the great and mighty conqueror and
[59:56] this is kind of where we're gonna
[59:58] base our thought from all the way
[1:00:00] through
[1:00:01] uh uh verse five he says there has been
[1:00:04] man
[1:00:05] in our days right
[1:00:08] uh uh and in the days gone by
[1:00:12] and in great in the great history of the
[1:00:14] world
[1:00:16] in his great broad fields of battle
[1:00:19] there has been many great conquerors
[1:00:22] many great things that have been done
[1:00:25] for the human race now y'all keep that
[1:00:28] y'all keep that point in mind
[1:00:31] because uh it helps us to really
[1:00:35] understand uh what christ is coming was
[1:00:38] all about and what calvary was all about
[1:00:40] it was about the human race right
[1:00:44] right every everything that g that jesus
[1:00:47] did
[1:00:47] it was for you and i i'm grateful for
[1:00:50] that
[1:00:51] he had no selfish motives no selfish
[1:00:55] intentions and things of that nature it
[1:00:57] wasn't that
[1:00:58] because one of the things we got to
[1:01:00] realize he had to be perfect
[1:01:02] he had to be the the right kind of
[1:01:06] sacrifice is that right amen one of the
[1:01:10] things we realized amen
[1:01:12] jesus had a real big job right that's
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:15] and and one of the things i realized is
[1:01:18] studying jesus
[1:01:19] did things that was going to do things
[1:01:22] and has done things that
[1:01:24] you know what humanity couldn't do amen
[1:01:27] right and and it's all of its ability
[1:01:31] uh there's things that jesus christ
[1:01:34] has accomplished force like trust say
[1:01:38] we we gotta we gotta start thinking
[1:01:40] different as christians yes
[1:01:43] glory right right amen we gotta be able
[1:01:46] to see
[1:01:47] what he has already done for
[1:01:50] us not gonna do i like the statement
[1:01:54] that the prophet of god makes he says
[1:01:56] you know what
[1:01:57] jesus can't do no more for us
[1:02:01] tonight than what he's already
[1:02:05] but y'all gonna make me preach tonight
[1:02:08] it's already done
[1:02:11] hallelujah the victory is already won
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:17] i'm getting ahead of myself the battle
[1:02:19] is already over
[1:02:22] glory and it's in this and
[1:02:26] i'm gonna just say this i'm gone and and
[1:02:28] i know people might not like this but it
[1:02:30] ain't

[1:05:00] or in better the human way of living
[1:05:06] and i and i thought that you know what
[1:05:08] um
[1:05:09] um i'm glad that he he had us in his
[1:05:12] mind
[1:05:13] right right um uh everything that
[1:05:17] christ did amen was so that
[1:05:20] we could have a better way of
[1:05:23] living right because
[1:05:27] because if he had not a cup
[1:05:30] if he had not went to calvary if he had
[1:05:33] not
[1:05:34] died and rose
[1:05:37] right wasn't enough for him to come on
[1:05:39] the scene
[1:05:41] but he had to die right he had to go
[1:05:44] take some keys and he had to come back
[1:05:47] all right
[1:05:48] but have you ever thought about what
[1:05:50] kind of world this would be
[1:05:53] if if jesus couldn't have conquered
[1:05:58] come on church i i had a little
[1:06:01] i think we all have i i mean we we've
[1:06:04] all lived
[1:06:04] some form and sin i mean i might have
[1:06:06] been a little further down in it than
[1:06:09] most of y'all
[1:06:10] you know in the depths but could you
[1:06:12] imagine what life would be
[1:06:15] hallelujah right if it wasn't for
[1:06:18] calvary
[1:06:20] if if if it wasn't for the great and
[1:06:22] mighty conqueror
[1:06:24] glory to god amen man when i when i read
[1:06:28] when i read that
[1:06:29] you know i just kind of highlighted it
[1:06:31] and put it put a little note in it
[1:06:35] this has been the best
[1:06:39] life that i could have lived
[1:06:43] as a human being right right
[1:06:47] people people you know people struggle
[1:06:51] right people people struggle with with
[1:06:54] the
[1:06:55] thought of living for god and making
[1:06:58] this sacrifice
[1:06:59] and and and this vow and this this
[1:07:02] marriage to the word and what we might
[1:07:06] have to give up preach
[1:07:10] wow this is
[1:07:13] a much better life
[1:07:18] right i couldn't i couldn't have lived
[1:07:21] the life
[1:07:21] any better on my own amen
[1:07:24] when i think of well now let's think
[1:07:27] about something i don't know how far
[1:07:28] we're going to just go to
[1:07:30] i can't go no more right but but let's
[1:07:33] let's think about in the flesh you know
[1:07:36] uh family inheritances and
[1:07:40] and all of the things and all the
[1:07:42] obstacles and all the things that
[1:07:44] and then then you know the the the
[1:07:48] contest
[1:07:49] the the battle there's no way we could
[1:07:52] even begin to speak of victory
[1:07:56] come on church look you could take
[1:07:59] victory off your tongue apart from jesus
[1:08:02] christ

[1:09:14] family and things of that nature

[1:09:55] right now
[1:09:56] right man i didn't know what it was like
[1:09:58] to live life without
[1:10:00] puffing on a cigarette a a bottle of
[1:10:03] liquor a joint or
[1:10:04] this or something didn't know
[1:10:07] right amen
[1:10:11] but jesus come down for the betterment
[1:10:16] if it weren't for nobody else he come
[1:10:19] down from me
[1:10:20] he did it for me huh
[1:10:24] he he knew the road that amen i'd be
[1:10:27] traveling
[1:10:28] on he said boy
[1:10:31] i want to give him a better life oh
[1:10:33] jesus i love to preach with you thank
[1:10:35] you

[1:10:39] you know that's a difficult thing right
[1:10:42] that's a that's a that's a real
[1:10:43] difficult thing
[1:10:45] for a lot of folk trying to show them a
[1:10:48] better way
[1:10:49] a better life in christ wow
[1:10:53] right wow that's that's really
[1:10:56] the preacher can scream and howl and
[1:10:58] everything else
[1:10:59] as parents you could talk like to you
[1:11:02] blue in the face i don't know what
[1:11:03] that's like
[1:11:05] huh and uh unless it's quickened to them
[1:11:08] they'll never comprehend
[1:11:10] amen then all you're trying to do is
[1:11:12] give
[1:11:13] a show them a better way of living
[1:11:17] right great great great men
[1:11:20] think about that right many great
[1:11:23] conquerors we've had in this world what
[1:11:26] great things that they've done what
[1:11:30] this now this on the humanistic side
[1:11:32] that they've done to further
[1:11:34] and better the human way of living i
[1:11:37] thought
[1:11:37] my that's powerful great great men
[1:11:41] and what what they've tried to do and
[1:11:43] what they've tried to accomplish right
[1:11:46] he says i was thinking of this great uh
[1:11:48] napoleon back in the day
[1:11:50] yeah and how he was uh he wasn't exactly
[1:11:54] a frenchman but
[1:11:55] he had something in his mind
[1:11:58] right uh and he just he said he despised
[1:12:01] friends i'm just trying to get to some
[1:12:03] a point here uh he he did not
[1:12:06] he said didn't like him he come from the
[1:12:09] owls
[1:12:09] but he had an idea in his mind that
[1:12:12] someday that he would conquer
[1:12:15] and the reason that he had these
[1:12:18] in his mind he had to have
[1:12:22] something to work on right that's that's
[1:12:25] true if you're gonna accomplish
[1:12:26] anything you gotta have something right
[1:12:28] there that
[1:12:29] that you're trying to uh right achieve
[1:12:32] or you won't be able to be persistent
[1:12:34] right or persevere right right right
[1:12:38] amen uh he says and to every man
[1:12:41] before you can do a job you have to have
[1:12:45] some motive come
[1:12:47] on right let's see
[1:12:50] you know and having the right motive
[1:12:52] right some alternative
[1:12:54] right something that you are working on
[1:12:59] for a a working purpose something to
[1:13:03] work
[1:13:03] by see jesus didn't just come just to
[1:13:07] come all right the statement of the
[1:13:10] prophet he makes say he just didn't come
[1:13:12] just hoping somebody would feel sad not
[1:13:16] that wasn't it he he had a purpose
[1:13:19] in coming yeah there was something
[1:13:22] behind
[1:13:23] everything that jesus actually done
[1:13:26] right and i'm gonna say this i'ma get to
[1:13:28] this say this before i get to it
[1:13:30] if he hadn't done it
[1:13:34] what he done we'd be in trouble
[1:13:39] we'd be in trouble boy i'd be trying to
[1:13:41] find a cave somewhere
[1:13:45] and hide in it especially especially
[1:13:48] when when we see that that we're living
[1:13:51] in an age where where
[1:13:53] uh uh people's hearts is failing for
[1:13:56] fear
[1:13:56] and and we back in genesis
[1:14:00] right amen we back in genesis
[1:14:03] where the very imagination of man is
[1:14:06] evil continuously that's right right
[1:14:10] but i thank god that we're covered by
[1:14:12] the blood
[1:14:16] think about the age where the prophet of
[1:14:18] god he makes a statement
[1:14:19] he he talks to he talks about uh uh uh
[1:14:23] uh insanity that's right people
[1:14:26] are insane that's right
[1:14:29] that's right right people are insane
[1:14:33] absolutely right people are insane
[1:14:37] but thank god for the blood
[1:14:40] that that covers us so that we can walk
[1:14:43] out our house and
[1:14:45] go about our occupations and things of
[1:14:47] that nature
[1:14:48] without fearing glory
[1:14:51] without fear amen he did it for me
[1:14:55] amen i'm i'm i'm moving
[1:14:58] i'm moving he says
[1:15:01] i'm i'm just trying to you know just
[1:15:03] drop these three things in here i'm
[1:15:04] gonna pick up a little speed in a minute
[1:15:07] and we're gonna get out of here but but
[1:15:10] it's something that i want to bring out
[1:15:13] right because this this napoleon
[1:15:16] you know he had something that he wanted
[1:15:18] to achieve i'll skip some of it
[1:15:21] right and and he actually achieved some
[1:15:25] some of it right but look at
[1:15:28] look at the individual after he was
[1:15:31] able to achieve these things
[1:15:34] he he he dot look it look at look at his
[1:15:37] end
[1:15:39] with the great achievements and all of
[1:15:42] the
[1:15:43] accolades and things of that nature
[1:15:45] watch something here
[1:15:46] he couldn't hold himself
[1:15:49] he couldn't hold his position right
[1:15:52] right come on preach with somebody that
[1:15:55] that status that he had
[1:15:58] it actually drove him crazy
[1:16:02] and as i was reading some of the
[1:16:05] statements i thought you know what
[1:16:06] and that's nothing but the truth god
[1:16:09] allows
[1:16:09] men listen you don't become great on
[1:16:12] your own in the economy of god
[1:16:14] right right i mean we we we give people
[1:16:17] too much
[1:16:18] of what they don't deserve i mean
[1:16:21] the ministry should be honored and
[1:16:24] things of that nature but i think we
[1:16:26] we push man more than we push god all
[1:16:29] right
[1:16:31] even with all of this truth we do
[1:16:33] something that the man who brought it
[1:16:35] never done
[1:16:36] he never pushed himself he was never
[1:16:38] trying to point people to himself
[1:16:40] he was always only trying to point
[1:16:43] people
[1:16:44] back to the word back to the bible back
[1:16:47] to right
[1:16:49] it wasn't about a man it was about
[1:16:52] christ
[1:16:53] because look we we look over in
[1:16:56] revelation 5
[1:16:57] man wasn't able to take the book
[1:17:00] no man john started crying that's right
[1:17:04] so how could a prophet come on the scene
[1:17:07] amen and point us to a man
[1:17:10] point us to himself that wasn't even
[1:17:13] scripture
[1:17:14] his ministry was only to reveal the son
[1:17:18] of man
[1:17:19] luke 17 30. yes make
[1:17:22] christ known amen not
[1:17:26] himself but to make
[1:17:29] christ known that's right reveal christ
[1:17:33] come on church i believe we can all say
[1:17:35] amen to that
[1:17:38] it wasn't about a man but what what we
[1:17:41] find
[1:17:41] is is is that you know god blesses men
[1:17:45] and blesses men in ministry
[1:17:47] and and here's the thing people from a
[1:17:50] humanistic standpoint going to be
[1:17:52] people right
[1:17:56] people going be people especially when
[1:17:59] they lack spiritual understanding
[1:18:01] they're gonna do
[1:18:02] things in the flesh and and you know
[1:18:05] somebody ain't
[1:18:06] ain't ain't wrong because i mean you're
[1:18:08] supposed to try to encourage and do
[1:18:10] different things but
[1:18:12] i think it's the job of the minister
[1:18:17] right to hold his position by the
[1:18:21] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:24] to hold his place to not
[1:18:28] amen get lifted up but but we see it all
[1:18:31] the time
[1:18:33] a man a man could be a small god blesses
[1:18:36] his ministry he start
[1:18:37] traveling or his church blow up or
[1:18:40] something of that nature
[1:18:42] and the next thing you know boy all you
[1:18:44] need is a glass of water you drowning
[1:18:48] oh y'all oughta talk to me that's all it
[1:18:50] will take it won't even take a bathtub
[1:18:52] fool
[1:18:53] one glass cause his head be so high
[1:18:56] that's right
[1:18:57] can't hardly shake hands i've seen this
[1:19:00] right i've i've seen this and this
[1:19:04] this has been to the detriment right
[1:19:06] right now
[1:19:07] right of of ministers of people
[1:19:10] right look at look at napoleon right
[1:19:13] he he did all of this conquer but he
[1:19:16] could not sustain himself
[1:19:20] right he couldn't hold himself he
[1:19:23] couldn't hold his position
[1:19:25] he couldn't handle all of the praise and
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:29] all of the brag it got too much he
[1:19:32] look at his end he died a drunk
[1:19:37] right amen he could conquer
[1:19:40] he could conquer and one fold and then
[1:19:44] the next thing amen because of the
[1:19:47] the humanistic realm in the realm of the
[1:19:49] spirit
[1:19:50] it just wiped them out it was it was
[1:19:53] just
[1:19:54] absolutely amen too much for him is that
[1:19:57] right
[1:19:57] glory to his wonderful name to be to be
[1:20:00] able to stand in that position
[1:20:03] amen as i'm preaching this tonight to be
[1:20:06] able to stand in that position
[1:20:08] as as a conqueror but
[1:20:11] but yet amen he was overwhelmed
[1:20:16] right see what's something there's
[1:20:18] things that we can accomplish in the
[1:20:20] natural
[1:20:22] right amen but it takes
[1:20:25] the baptism of the holy ghost it takes
[1:20:28] like my brother was talking about last
[1:20:29] night
[1:20:30] the resurrection to take place down on
[1:20:33] the inside of us
[1:20:35] to hold us positionally
[1:20:38] amen come on now to hold us positionally
[1:20:42] after we we do great things everybody
[1:20:45] can't take
[1:20:46] being pat on the back praise the lord
[1:20:48] brother smiley
[1:20:50] praise the lord brother
[1:20:56] boy did not preach
[1:21:00] praise god you see
[1:21:04] hey man come on church yeah
[1:21:07] look look at watch this now we we're
[1:21:10] working tonight
[1:21:11] right he was able to accomplish
[1:21:14] something
[1:21:15] right the thing that was on his mind he
[1:21:17] accomplished that
[1:21:19] and and then you know once he got to
[1:21:21] this
[1:21:22] place without the mighty conqueror
[1:21:25] he fell apart come on now
[1:21:29] let's let's show us something look at
[1:21:32] look at look at
[1:21:33] uh noah right
[1:21:36] let's bring it to the scripture look at
[1:21:38] look at noah
[1:21:40] look at look at what noah was able to do
[1:21:43] y'all think that was easy come on now
[1:21:47] the preacher a preacher message that
[1:21:50] nobody never heard
[1:21:52] it's gonna and to just keep saying it
[1:21:56] right right it's going to rain
[1:22:00] it's going to rain to preach a judgment
[1:22:03] message to a group of people that never
[1:22:06] seem
[1:22:07] rain didn't know rain
[1:22:11] god had turned the corner right
[1:22:14] right glory to god god had turned a
[1:22:17] corner
[1:22:19] man smart men smart people
[1:22:22] educated people people could prove man
[1:22:25] please
[1:22:27] no such thing a man
[1:22:30] a man that operated in faith
[1:22:34] right come on right amen something that
[1:22:37] was revealed to him
[1:22:38] personally all right see that's why the
[1:22:41] baptism
[1:22:42] and this way a lot of people fail right
[1:22:44] because you get caught up in emotions
[1:22:47] and sensations
[1:22:48] right but the the your experience
[1:22:52] ain't a revelation to you one thing
[1:22:54] about it nobody can't take away from me
[1:22:56] what god has done for me
[1:22:58] is that right glory to god glory to god
[1:23:01] you've got to be able to look back to
[1:23:03] the time
[1:23:04] when god brought about a change i don't
[1:23:07] care how much you scream on this altar
[1:23:11] crying all of that roll around
