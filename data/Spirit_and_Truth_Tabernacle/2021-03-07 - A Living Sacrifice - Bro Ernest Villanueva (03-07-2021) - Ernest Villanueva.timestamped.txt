[54:57] amen a sanctuary on today
[55:01] um i heard the prayer requests for
[55:04] sister
[55:06] vernon's nephew and i just wanted to
[55:08] read a scripture
[55:11] i felt that this would be a teachable
[55:14] moment
[55:16] anytime you hear of someone
[55:20] having a nosebleed
[55:23] the prophet gave us very specific
[55:25] instructions
[55:26] on how to deal with them and he said
[55:30] read ezekiel 16 and verse 6 so you need
[55:34] to write that in your bible or
[55:36] somewhere and put a note in your phone
[55:38] anytime you hear
[55:40] somebody has a nosebleed
[55:44] you read ezekiel 16 and verse six
[55:48] and the instructions from the prophet is
[55:50] read it three times
[55:52] i did this uh one time my daughter had a
[55:55] really bad nosebleed we were
[55:57] about to take her to the hospital my
[56:00] wife was
[56:01] uh up at night with her and she'd come
[56:03] and um she got me out of bed and said
[56:05] you know
[56:06] zandy's bleeding and you know we don't
[56:08] know just keeps coming
[56:09] so uh i say well we're gonna use
[56:13] what the prophet told us we're gonna use
[56:14] this scripture and say now if she
[56:16] keep bleeding after this then we're
[56:18] going to take him to the hospital
[56:20] so uh i read the scripture three times
[56:23] and prayed the prayer of faith and
[56:25] and after that no more bleeding amen so
[56:28] i believe god's word
[56:30] if god gave us instruction through a
[56:31] prophet that's what we're going to do
[56:32] and
[56:33] even though we're not in the hospital
[56:34] room we're sending this scripture to the
[56:36] hospital room
[56:38] where this young man is and just
[56:39] believing that god's going to do
[56:41] what he said he would do the bible says
[56:43] and when i
[56:44] pass by thee and saw thee polluted in
[56:47] thine own blood i said unto thee when
[56:49] thou was
[56:50] in thy blood live yeah i said unto thee
[56:54] when thou
[56:55] was in thy blood live he said read it
[56:58] three times the second time and when i
[57:00] passed by thee and saw thee polluted in
[57:02] thine own blood i said unto thee when
[57:04] thy
[57:04] when thou was in thy blood live yea i
[57:07] said
[57:07] unto thee when thou was in thy blood
[57:09] live
[57:11] the third time and when i passed by thee
[57:13] and saw thee polluted in thine own blood
[57:15] i said
[57:16] unto thee when thou was in thy blood
[57:18] live
[57:19] yea i said unto thee when thou was in
[57:22] thy blood
[57:23] live we send that scripture to that
[57:25] young man right now in the name of jesus
[57:27] we command him to live
[57:29] in jesus name satan loose him and let
[57:33] him go
[57:34] we've come according to what the prophet
[57:36] has told us to to come and follow over
[57:38] this condition we plead the blood of
[57:40] jesus
[57:41] believing that he's healed by your
[57:44] stripes god he is healed it's in jesus

[58:31] first friday of every month we try to
[58:32] have a tape that we listen to
[58:34] from the prophet and uh sometimes from
[58:37] before kobe we were coming together at
[58:38] the church and we were doing it but
[58:40] since that uh we we've been having
[58:42] everybody just listen to it in their

[1:00:05] the the the uh business meeting
[1:00:09] that fifth tuesday night is going to be

[1:00:12] those that have gifts in our assembly if
[1:00:15] you have the gift of tongues the gift of
[1:00:17] interpretation
[1:00:18] uh someone would share with me how often
[1:00:20] times they get in prayer and god just
[1:00:22] begins to kind of show visions to them
[1:00:24] while they're in prayer
[1:00:25] if you got a gift please talk to me
[1:00:27] about it we want you to come on that
[1:00:28] fifth tuesday brother branham told us
[1:00:30] just sit and wait on the lord and as
[1:00:33] brother smiley was preaching a few weeks
[1:00:35] ago he
[1:00:36] hid a scripture out of acts 2 and it
[1:00:38] says they were all in one accord
[1:00:41] and they were just waiting on the lord
[1:00:44] right
[1:00:44] and as he read that it just spoke it
[1:00:46] spoke to my spirit so we got to put
[1:00:47] ourselves back in the word of god with
[1:00:49] everything that we do right
[1:00:50] so the brother branham said just wait on
[1:00:52] the lord we don't manufacture it don't

[1:01:01] amen but we want to just do things amen
[1:01:03] the way that the prophet laid it out for
[1:01:05] us so we're asking those that are gifted
[1:01:07] like that god has given you gift just
[1:01:09] come and just sit and wait on the lord
[1:01:11] uh and uh we're gonna do that on the

[1:08:56] for
[1:08:56] your prayers it's wonderful to be here

[1:09:02] little bit of a different service today

[1:09:05] you're going to have two preachers
[1:09:07] you're going to have myself

[1:10:19] your your leading and you're guiding and
[1:10:21] directing
[1:10:22] and to giving us that that revelation

[1:10:28] that leaves us in a state of
[1:10:30] intoxication

[1:10:42] the service to you

[1:10:53] for we ask it in your precious name
[1:10:56] of our lord jesus christ amen
[1:10:59] i'll read this first scripture brother
[1:11:01] jack
[1:11:02] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:11:04] mercies of god
[1:11:06] that ye present your body a living
[1:11:09] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god
[1:11:13] and i like this next little passage it
[1:11:15] says which
[1:11:16] is your reasonable service
[1:11:19] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:11:22] be transformed
[1:11:23] by the renewing of your mind that ye may
[1:11:26] prove what is that good
[1:11:28] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:11:31] amen god bless you and you can have your
[1:11:33] seats
[1:11:35] and to start i would like to turn over
[1:11:38] to
[1:11:39] leviticus in chapter 2
[1:11:44] and brother jack if you could just start
[1:11:46] reading
[1:11:48] in leviticus 2.
[1:11:56] in verse 1 and when any
[1:12:00] will offer a meat offering unto the lord
[1:12:04] his offering shall be a fine flower and
[1:12:06] he shall pour oil upon it
[1:12:08] and put frankincense thereon
[1:12:12] and he shall bring it to aaron's sons
[1:12:14] the priests
[1:12:15] and he shall take thereof there out his
[1:12:19] handful of flower thereof
[1:12:21] and of the oil thereof with all the
[1:12:23] frequencies thereof
[1:12:25] and the priest shall burn the memorial
[1:12:27] of it upon the altar to be an offer made
[1:12:29] by fire
[1:12:30] of a sweet savior unto the lord
[1:12:33] and the remnant of the meat offering
[1:12:36] shall be aarons
[1:12:37] and his sons it is a thing most holy
[1:12:40] of the offerings of the lord made by
[1:12:42] fire amen i'd like to just comment on
[1:12:44] that
[1:12:45] the the elements that go into this meat
[1:12:48] offering
[1:12:49] are first of all you've got to have the
[1:12:51] fine flour
[1:12:52] and brother branham talked about a a
[1:12:55] device they had back in those days it
[1:12:57] was called a burr
[1:12:59] and he mentioned it 28 times and this
[1:13:02] burr was something that they would take
[1:13:03] and they would grind the corn or the
[1:13:05] meal
[1:13:06] and every piece came out exactly
[1:13:09] the same size and so this is a type and
[1:13:12] brother branham said
[1:13:13] i am a typologist and any man who truly
[1:13:17] knows the bible will be a typologist
[1:13:21] and so we know that this bible it blends
[1:13:24] together all the way from
[1:13:26] genesis the seed chapter revelation is
[1:13:29] the harvest chapter
[1:13:30] and so the first element had to be that
[1:13:33] fine flower
[1:13:34] and then there had to be oil put on
[1:13:37] there and
[1:13:38] and and then there was frankincense and
[1:13:40] frankincense
[1:13:41] was the most costly and the most
[1:13:44] precious
[1:13:45] and the sweetest fragrance that there
[1:13:47] was in that time
[1:13:49] so you can continue brother jack
[1:13:54] and if thou bring an oblation of a meat
[1:13:57] offering
[1:13:58] baked in the oven it shall be unleavened
[1:14:00] cakes of fine flour
[1:14:02] mingle with oil or unleavened wafers
[1:14:04] anointed with oil
[1:14:06] and if thy oblation be a meat offering
[1:14:10] baked in a pan it shall be a fine flour
[1:14:13] unleavened
[1:14:14] mingle with oil thou shall part
[1:14:17] it in pieces and pour ore thereon it
[1:14:21] is a meat offering and if thy oblation
[1:14:24] be a meat offering baked in the frying
[1:14:26] pan
[1:14:26] it shall be made of fine flour with oil
[1:14:30] and thou shalt bring the meat offering
[1:14:32] that is made of these things unto the
[1:14:34] lord
[1:14:35] and when it is presented unto the priest
[1:14:37] he shall bring it
[1:14:38] unto the altar amen now there's there's
[1:14:42] three elements that i want to bring to
[1:14:44] your attention
[1:14:45] one of them is the this meat offering
[1:14:49] could be bacon in the oven
[1:14:52] or it could be bacon in the pan or it
[1:14:55] could be bacon
[1:14:56] in the frying pan three different ways
[1:14:59] for this to be to be baked and brother
[1:15:02] jack if you could just pick that up at
[1:15:03] verse 11.
[1:15:05] the lord no meat
[1:15:08] offering which ye shall bring unto the
[1:15:11] lord shall be made with
[1:15:12] leaven for ye shall burn no leaven
[1:15:16] nor any honey in any offering of the
[1:15:18] lord made by fire
[1:15:21] as for the oblation of the first fruits
[1:15:23] ye shall offer them unto the lord but
[1:15:25] they shall
[1:15:25] not be burnt on the altar for a sweet
[1:15:28] savor
[1:15:29] and every oblation of thy meat offering
[1:15:32] shalt thou
[1:15:32] seize them with salt neither shalt thou
[1:15:35] suffer the salt of the covenant of thy
[1:15:37] god to be lacking
[1:15:38] from thy meat offering with all thine
[1:15:41] offerings thou shalt offer
[1:15:43] salt now these are very specific
[1:15:45] ingredients we talked about the fine
[1:15:48] flour and the oil and the frankincense
[1:15:52] now we're instructed don't put any
[1:15:54] leaven
[1:15:55] in there and don't put any honey in
[1:15:58] there
[1:15:59] because when you heat honey it has a
[1:16:01] tendency to sour
[1:16:02] ferment and sour and the last element
[1:16:05] was the salt because the salt this was a
[1:16:09] preservative
[1:16:10] and you see these are wonderful types
[1:16:12] that that are laid out
[1:16:13] that will come to light further on in
[1:16:16] the service
[1:16:17] now if we go to first kings
[1:16:21] chapter 16 and verse
[1:16:24] 23 through 26.
[1:16:34] in the 30th and first year of assa
[1:16:38] king of judah began omri to reign over
[1:16:41] israel 12 years
[1:16:45] 12 years six years reigned he in terza
[1:16:49] and he bought the hill samaria of
[1:16:52] shimmer
[1:16:52] for two talents of silver and built on
[1:16:55] the hill
[1:16:56] and called the name of the city which he
[1:16:58] built after
[1:16:59] the name of shimmer owner of the hill
[1:17:02] samaria
[1:17:03] but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the
[1:17:05] lord and did
[1:17:06] worse than all that were before him for
[1:17:09] he walked
[1:17:10] in all the way of jeroboam think about
[1:17:13] that
[1:17:13] this man the bible says he did worse
[1:17:16] than
[1:17:16] all that were before him and whenever
[1:17:19] you see that word
[1:17:20] all it means all because it's the word
[1:17:23] so this was a bad man yes sir praise god
[1:17:26] okay continue for he walked in all the
[1:17:30] ways
[1:17:30] all the way of jeroboam the son of nabat
[1:17:33] and in
[1:17:34] his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
[1:17:37] to provoke the lord god of israel to
[1:17:38] anger with their
[1:17:40] vanities amen and now we'll we'll read
[1:17:43] at verse 28 brother jack so
[1:17:46] amri slept with his fathers and was
[1:17:48] buried
[1:17:49] in samaria and ahab his son reigned in
[1:17:52] his stand
[1:17:53] and in the 30th and eighth year of assa
[1:17:56] king of judah began ahab the son of omri
[1:17:58] to reign over israel
[1:18:00] and ahab the son of armory reigned over
[1:18:02] israel and samaria 22 years
[1:18:05] and ahab the son of omri did evil in the
[1:18:08] sight of the lord
[1:18:09] above all that were before him so his
[1:18:12] evil
[1:18:13] bypass even his father's evil so it
[1:18:16] doesn't get better
[1:18:17] it's getting worse and worse continue
[1:18:20] brother jack
[1:18:23] and it came to pass as if he had as if
[1:18:26] it had been a life
[1:18:27] a light thing for him to walk
[1:18:31] in the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat
[1:18:34] that he took to wife
[1:18:36] jezebel a pagan a heathen
[1:18:40] come on brother the daughter of ethbaugh
[1:18:42] king of zidonians
[1:18:44] and went and served baal and worshiped
[1:18:47] him
[1:18:48] and he reared up an altar for belle in
[1:18:51] the house of baal
[1:18:52] which he had built in samaria and ahab
[1:18:55] made a grove
[1:18:56] and ahab did more to provoke the lord
[1:18:59] god of israel to anger
[1:19:00] than all the kings of israel that were
[1:19:03] before him
[1:19:05] so these are this is supposed to be the
[1:19:06] king of israel
[1:19:08] leading god's people and he winds up
[1:19:10] marrying
[1:19:11] jezebel and jezebel the more i read
[1:19:14] about jezebel
[1:19:15] and the history of jezebel she was a
[1:19:18] wicked
[1:19:19] woman and served baal and cause
[1:19:22] all of israel to fall into that worship
[1:19:25] of baal
[1:19:26] so in other words his israel for the
[1:19:28] most part they became a
[1:19:30] worshiper of a pagan god now
[1:19:33] god is not going to let this stand for
[1:19:36] long so
[1:19:37] in chapter 17 we'll start reading at
[1:19:39] verse 1 brother jack
[1:19:42] and elijah the tishbite who was of the
[1:19:45] inhabitants of gilead
[1:19:46] said unto ahab as the lord god of
[1:19:50] israel liveth before whom i stand there
[1:19:53] shall not be dew nor
[1:19:54] rain these years but according to my
[1:19:57] word
[1:19:58] now you can imagine ahab he's probably
[1:20:00] looking down and maybe jezebel with them
[1:20:02] saying who is this fool
[1:20:05] how in the world did this fool ever even
[1:20:07] get into the palace
[1:20:09] to get into my presence and and to have
[1:20:12] the nerve to say
[1:20:13] that it's not going to rain until he
[1:20:16] calls for
[1:20:19] they probably didn't pay it not one lick
[1:20:21] of attention
[1:20:23] laughed ridiculed the fool
[1:20:28] in verse two
[1:20:32] the word of the lord came unto him
[1:20:34] saying
[1:20:35] get the hands and turn thee eastward and
[1:20:38] hide thyself by the brook cherith
[1:20:40] that is before jordan
[1:20:45] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[1:20:48] the brook
[1:20:50] and i have commanded the ravens to feed
[1:20:53] thee
[1:20:53] them now you've got to be a supernatural
[1:20:56] being
[1:20:57] you know a message believer is a
[1:21:00] supernatural being
[1:21:01] with a divine purpose in your life
[1:21:05] and for you to believe that god had
[1:21:08] ravens
[1:21:09] come and they had bread and flesh in the
[1:21:12] morning
[1:21:12] bread and flesh in the evening it was
[1:21:16] room service brother branham said that
[1:21:19] god wanted
[1:21:20] three and a half years of constant
[1:21:22] fellowship
[1:21:23] with his prophet and he took him to the
[1:21:26] brook cherith
[1:21:27] which brother branham said was the
[1:21:29] driest place
[1:21:30] in the land but yet that brook it just
[1:21:33] flowed
[1:21:34] for that whole three and a half year
[1:21:36] period
[1:21:38] start at verse verse seven brother jack
[1:21:41] and it came to pass
[1:21:42] after a while that the brook dried up
[1:21:45] because there had been no rain in the
[1:21:47] land
[1:21:49] and the word of the lord came unto him
[1:21:51] saying
[1:21:52] arise get thee to zarephath which
[1:21:55] belongeth to zydon
[1:21:57] and dwell there behold i have commanded
[1:22:01] a widow woman there to sustain thee now
[1:22:04] think about that this widow woman had no
[1:22:06] idea of her destiny she had no idea that
[1:22:10] she was walking into
[1:22:11] a supernatural future but yet god had
[1:22:14] ordained for her to be there
[1:22:17] and so we continue that brother jack
[1:22:22] so he arose and went to zarephath
[1:22:25] and when he came to the gate of the city
[1:22:27] behold the widow woman was there
[1:22:29] gathering of sticks the same woman that
[1:22:32] he saw in the vision
[1:22:33] he's walking down there maybe he come to
[1:22:35] the picket fence and he looked over
[1:22:37] there and there's that woman
[1:22:39] and she's out there and she's picking up
[1:22:41] sticks
[1:22:43] and he called to her and said fetch me i
[1:22:46] pray thee a little water in a vessel
[1:22:48] that i may drink
[1:22:50] and as she was going to fetch it i think
[1:22:52] about that the first part of the message
[1:22:55] she had no problem with it even though
[1:22:58] even though they are in the midst of a
[1:23:02] famine
[1:23:04] there's no water water is the most
[1:23:07] precious commodity that there
[1:23:08] is and yet when this stranger comes
[1:23:11] walking up
[1:23:12] and says fetch me a drink
[1:23:16] so she's ready to go and get the drink
[1:23:20] continue brother jack
[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:30] and as she was going to fetch it
[1:23:34] he called to her and said bring me
[1:23:37] i pray the immorsa bread in thine hand
[1:23:41] that stiffened her up that stopped her
[1:23:43] right in her tracks
[1:23:47] continue your brother jack and she said
[1:23:50] as the lord thy god
[1:23:51] liveth i have not a cake but a handful
[1:23:55] of meal in a barrel and a little oil and
[1:23:57] a cruise
[1:23:58] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[1:24:00] that i may go in and i just wanna
[1:24:02] she's gathering two sticks not three
[1:24:04] sticks or four sticks
[1:24:06] she's gathering two sticks
[1:24:10] that i may go in and dress it for me and
[1:24:12] my son
[1:24:13] that we may eat it and die she's in
[1:24:16] desperation
[1:24:18] she knows this is the last meal that
[1:24:20] she's got
[1:24:21] for her and her little son
[1:24:25] continue brother and elijah said unto
[1:24:27] her fear not
[1:24:29] go and do as thou has said but
[1:24:32] make me thereof a little cake first and
[1:24:34] bring it unto me
[1:24:36] and after make for thee and for thy son
[1:24:40] for for thus saith the lord god of
[1:24:43] israel
[1:24:44] the barrel of meals shall not waste
[1:24:47] neither shall the crews of oil fail
[1:24:50] until the day that the lord sendeth
[1:24:52] reign upon
[1:24:53] the earth and she went and did according
[1:24:57] to the saying of elijah
[1:24:59] and she and he and her house
[1:25:03] did eat many days
[1:25:06] and the barrel of meal wasted not
[1:25:09] neither did the cruise of oil fail
[1:25:11] according to the word of the lord which
[1:25:13] he spake
[1:25:14] by elijah now brother branham love to
[1:25:17] speak
[1:25:18] about elijah and about this widow woman
[1:25:21] and her conditions
[1:25:22] and you won't find this all in one
[1:25:25] chapter or one passage
[1:25:26] but brother branham talked about the
[1:25:28] widow woman
[1:25:30] she said she was the poorest of the poor
[1:25:34] she had to be a virtuous woman or god
[1:25:37] would not have sent his prophet
[1:25:39] to her he says she was weary
[1:25:43] unable to sleep all night she was tossed
[1:25:46] about
[1:25:47] because of this great tragedy big tears
[1:25:50] dripping from her eyes
[1:25:52] for many weeks she'd had only
[1:25:55] one meal every three or four days
[1:25:59] her husband had been lost in the battle
[1:26:01] for the lord he trusted god and gave his
[1:26:04] life for the cause of
[1:26:05] israel now listen to this
[1:26:08] detail you know if if a submarine's
[1:26:11] under the water
[1:26:12] and the commander wants to know what's
[1:26:14] going on he had a
[1:26:15] a periscope and that would go up and it
[1:26:19] could tell him any land
[1:26:20] any other ships but god in this day
[1:26:23] he has given us a prophet scope and
[1:26:26] god could take that prophet scope and he
[1:26:28] could turn him back to genesis
[1:26:30] he could take him all the way through
[1:26:32] revelation he could come down and show
[1:26:34] us
[1:26:35] fine details here's one of the fine
[1:26:38] details
[1:26:40] her ragged nightgown was just about
[1:26:43] gone her sleeves were all ragged
[1:26:47] and her arms sticking out of them she
[1:26:50] lived decent and honorable and met
[1:26:52] all of god's requirements but still
[1:26:55] the lord remained silent her shoulders
[1:26:59] were stooped
[1:27:00] as she sat in her rocking chair shedding
[1:27:03] big
[1:27:04] tears and looking at her starving baby
[1:27:07] her cheekbones sticking out her arms
[1:27:10] frail
[1:27:12] and she sat ringing her bony hands
[1:27:15] her bones were dwindling away as the
[1:27:18] flesh
[1:27:19] goes from them this this was not just
[1:27:23] a man thinking or trying to describe
[1:27:26] what he thought might have been going on
[1:27:28] this was precision revelation that god
[1:27:31] gave to the
[1:27:32] prophet and he gave it to us
[1:27:35] he said she knew that only a handful of
[1:27:38] meal
[1:27:38] stood between her and death and then he
[1:27:42] says later on
[1:27:43] she wasn't going to eat of the cake she
[1:27:45] was going to make
[1:27:46] she was going to feed her little boy
[1:27:49] and put him in her arms and die
[1:27:56] then about the little boy he said the
[1:27:57] little boy was
[1:27:59] three or four years old he was unable to
[1:28:02] sleep over 20 minutes at a time
[1:28:04] because of his hunger he had on a ragged
[1:28:08] night shirt
[1:28:09] he had sinking cheeks his eyes were
[1:28:12] turning yellow
[1:28:13] and he was holding his stomach as he
[1:28:15] asked his mother
[1:28:17] if she was ready to cook the little cake
[1:28:20] now you'll be able to find all these
[1:28:22] things verbatim just as i've read them
[1:28:25] and again you'll have to search because
[1:28:27] it's in one message and then another
[1:28:29] message
[1:28:30] and then he says of the conditions in
[1:28:32] the land because of the drought and the
[1:28:33] famine
[1:28:34] the whole nation was starving and in a
[1:28:37] terrible condition
[1:28:39] the people in the city of zarepath were
[1:28:41] starving to death
[1:28:43] screaming for water it was a reflection
[1:28:45] of sin
[1:28:46] and immorality as the woman looked down
[1:28:49] the street
[1:28:50] she heard the people cursing and
[1:28:52] carrying on
[1:28:54] so now we read in leviticus that in this
[1:28:56] this this meal offering
[1:28:58] there had to be fine flour and and the
[1:29:01] oil
[1:29:02] and the woman she is on on a little bit
[1:29:05] further in the bible
[1:29:06] she's out there and she's got a little
[1:29:09] bit of meal
[1:29:10] and a little bit of oil and she's out
[1:29:12] gathering
[1:29:13] two sticks and she's gonna put the meal
[1:29:16] and the oil on the two sticks
[1:29:18] and gonna cook it and she thought she
[1:29:20] was going to die
[1:29:23] she was like a skeleton walking around
[1:29:28] but jehovah god sent elijah to him
[1:29:32] and elijah said thus saith the lord
[1:29:35] because you were willing because you
[1:29:37] were willing
[1:29:38] to sacrifice and give everything you had
[1:29:42] your meals never gonna run out your
[1:29:44] oil's never gonna run out
[1:29:46] and she and he and her house did eat and
[1:29:49] the oil and the meal
[1:29:50] never ran out now if we can turn over to
[1:29:53] luke
[1:29:54] chapter four
[1:30:02] now those of you that are that are
[1:30:03] familiar with
[1:30:05] luke chapter four we know at the at
[1:30:08] at the beginning it's uh it's jesus and
[1:30:11] he's going into the
[1:30:13] wilderness to be to be tempted
[1:30:17] and for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:30:21] he has no food and no water
[1:30:25] and he did this as a man and in the
[1:30:27] desert it is
[1:30:28] hot in the daytime and cold
[1:30:32] in the evening time and the devil was
[1:30:34] there
[1:30:35] trying to trip him up at every step
[1:30:39] and then we see in in verse
[1:30:42] 12 and jesus answering the devil said
[1:30:45] unto him
[1:30:46] if it is said thou shalt not tempt the
[1:30:49] lord thy god
[1:30:50] and when the devil had ended
[1:30:53] all the temptations he departed from him
[1:30:57] for a season didn't leave him
[1:31:00] permanently but he departed
[1:31:02] for a season and brother jack can you
[1:31:04] pick up the reading there in verse 14.
[1:31:07] and jesus returned in the power of the
[1:31:10] spirit
[1:31:11] into galilee and there went out a fame
[1:31:14] of him through
[1:31:15] all the region round about and he taught
[1:31:18] in their synagogues being glorified
[1:31:20] of all there's that word all again he
[1:31:22] taught in the synagogues went from
[1:31:25] synagogue to synagogue and all that hurt
[1:31:27] him
[1:31:28] they glorified him all of them that hurt
[1:31:31] him
[1:31:32] continue brother jack and he came to
[1:31:34] nazareth
[1:31:35] where he had been brought up in other
[1:31:37] words local boy comes home
[1:31:39] local boys made good we've heard about
[1:31:42] him
[1:31:42] sometimes you hear about a sports star
[1:31:44] comes from a local community
[1:31:46] yeah that's he comes from my hometown
[1:31:48] maybe a footballer
[1:31:49] baseball basketball player or a
[1:31:52] politician or a comedian or
[1:31:54] or or actor yeah yeah he's from my
[1:31:56] hometown
[1:31:57] so now jesus comes to his hometown where
[1:32:00] he'd been brought up
[1:32:03] and as his custom was
[1:32:06] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:32:08] sabbath day and he stood up for
[1:32:11] to read and there was delivered unto him
[1:32:14] the book of the prophet
[1:32:16] isaiah now jesus didn't ask for him to
[1:32:18] give him the book of isaiah
[1:32:20] it was predestinated that that minister
[1:32:23] hand jesus
[1:32:24] the book of isaiah and when he had
[1:32:27] opened the book
[1:32:28] he found the place where it was written
[1:32:31] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:32:33] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:32:35] the gospel
[1:32:36] to the poor he have sent me to heal the
[1:32:38] brokenhearted to preach
[1:32:40] deliverance to the captives and
[1:32:42] recovering of sight to the blind
[1:32:44] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:32:47] to preach the acceptable year
[1:32:49] of the lord think about that he read
[1:32:51] that scripture
[1:32:52] and he sat down continued brother jack
[1:32:56] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:32:58] again to the minister
[1:33:00] and sat down and the eyes of all them
[1:33:03] is all there's that word all again the
[1:33:05] eyes of all of them they're looking
[1:33:07] they're fastened on him waiting to find
[1:33:10] out what's next
[1:33:12] he just read it and he sat down
[1:33:16] and the eyes of all of them that were in
[1:33:17] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[1:33:19] he began to say unto them
[1:33:22] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:33:26] in your ears that was radical for a man
[1:33:29] to stand up
[1:33:30] and read isaiah and said this day this
[1:33:34] scripture
[1:33:35] is fulfilled right now in your ears
[1:33:39] okay and all
[1:33:42] bear him witness and wandered at the
[1:33:45] gracious words which proceeded out of
[1:33:48] his mouth
[1:33:49] and they said is not this joseph's son
[1:33:52] the answer is no it was not joseph's son
[1:33:58] that was god's son it was joseph's
[1:34:01] stepson
[1:34:02] but it wasn't joseph's son but they
[1:34:04] thought
[1:34:05] yes who does he think he is this
[1:34:08] i mean he grew up here we know him this
[1:34:11] is joseph's son
[1:34:12] and now he's saying that he's fulfilling
[1:34:14] this prophecy
[1:34:15] in isaiah continue brother jack
[1:34:19] and he said unto them ye will surely say
[1:34:22] unto me this proverb
[1:34:24] physician heal thyself whatsoever we
[1:34:27] have heard
[1:34:28] done in capernaum do also here in thy
[1:34:30] country we've heard all the miracles
[1:34:32] you've done we've heard about the blind
[1:34:34] eyes the deaf ears the leper
[1:34:36] we've heard all about that so do a
[1:34:38] miracle
[1:34:39] we want to see a miracle too don't hold
[1:34:44] back
[1:34:47] and he said verily i say unto you no
[1:34:49] prophet is accepted
[1:34:51] in his own country think about that no
[1:34:54] prophet is accepted in his
[1:34:57] own country and you wonder why there's
[1:35:01] not more
[1:35:02] message believers in america like there
[1:35:05] is in
[1:35:05] africa with ten thousand fifteen
[1:35:08] thousand
[1:35:09] they have conventions have twenty twenty
[1:35:11] five thousand
[1:35:13] you won't see that in america continue
[1:35:16] brother jack
[1:35:19] and he said verily i say unto you no
[1:35:21] prophet is except in his own country but
[1:35:23] i tell you of a truth
[1:35:24] many widows were in israel in the days
[1:35:27] of elijah
[1:35:28] many widows were there when the heaven
[1:35:30] was
[1:35:31] was shut up three years and six months
[1:35:34] when great famine was throughout all the
[1:35:37] land
[1:35:38] but unto none of them was elijah's sent
[1:35:42] save unto serepta of
[1:35:45] a city of sidon until a woman that was a
[1:35:48] widow
[1:35:50] and many lepers were in israel at the
[1:35:52] time of elisha the prophet and none of
[1:35:54] them was cleansed saving
[1:35:56] naaman the syrian now buckle your seat
[1:35:59] belt for the next couple of verses here
[1:36:02] and all they in the synagogue
[1:36:06] when they heard these things were filled
[1:36:09] with wrath wrath anger
[1:36:12] who is who is this god who dares to
[1:36:15] stand up in our temple
[1:36:17] and read this book and say it's me
[1:36:21] you have just had this prophecy
[1:36:24] fulfilled
[1:36:25] in your ears and they had all that wrath
[1:36:29] continued brother jack and rose up and
[1:36:32] thrust him out of the city and led him
[1:36:35] unto the brow of the hill where on this
[1:36:38] where in the city their city was built
[1:36:41] that they might
[1:36:42] cast him down headline deadlong
[1:36:45] they were not just going to push him
[1:36:46] over they wanted to send them down
[1:36:48] headlong
[1:36:51] there's no there's no anger like
[1:36:53] perverted
[1:36:54] religious anger friends i have seen that
[1:36:58] take place
[1:36:59] i have seen the manifestation of devils
[1:37:01] come out of religious people
[1:37:03] like i've never seen come out of just
[1:37:05] plain worldly people
[1:37:08] last verse brother jack
[1:37:11] but he passing through the midst of them
[1:37:14] went his way amen so
[1:37:18] so now jesus is beginning his ministry
[1:37:21] and let's turn over now to matthew
[1:37:23] chapter 27.
[1:37:28] remember all these types that we're
[1:37:29] talking about in the beginning in
[1:37:31] leviticus
[1:37:32] they're about to become manifest in
[1:37:35] matthew 27 verse 1.
[1:37:40] when the morning was come all the chief
[1:37:44] priests
[1:37:44] all the chief priests and elders
[1:37:48] of the people took counsel against jesus
[1:37:50] to put him to death
[1:37:51] all this is the sanhedrin council the
[1:37:54] supreme court
[1:37:56] they are going to get this man who is
[1:37:58] making
[1:37:59] uh what they think is a blasphemy in
[1:38:02] their town and their city
[1:38:04] and they are that they're getting
[1:38:05] together to commune
[1:38:07] how we're going to get rid of this guy
[1:38:11] when they had bound him they led him
[1:38:14] away
[1:38:14] and delivered him to pontius pilate the
[1:38:16] governor okay now
[1:38:18] in verse uh
[1:38:23] verse 11 he stands before the governor
[1:38:26] and then
[1:38:26] they present the the premise of barabbas
[1:38:30] and they give the people the opportunity
[1:38:33] do you want jesus
[1:38:34] or do you want barabbas and in unison
[1:38:37] they all screamed out
[1:38:39] give us barabbas he said what shall i do
[1:38:42] with jesus they said
[1:38:43] crucify him in verse 27
[1:38:48] actually verse 26 brother jack sorry
[1:38:52] then released he barabbas unto them
[1:38:55] and when he had scourged jesus he
[1:38:57] delivered him to be crucified
[1:39:00] then the soldiers of the governor took
[1:39:02] jesus into the common hall and gathered
[1:39:04] unto him the whole band of soldiers now
[1:39:06] listen listen to that
[1:39:07] they gathered unto him the whole
[1:39:11] band of soldiers so it wasn't just a
[1:39:14] couple of soldiers
[1:39:16] that were going to torture jesus these
[1:39:19] roman
[1:39:20] soldiers they were masters of torture
[1:39:22] they
[1:39:23] loved to do it they were saddest
[1:39:26] say this whatever way you want to say it
[1:39:29] and they took
[1:39:30] glee in doing it and they took jesus
[1:39:33] and they began to beat him and spit upon
[1:39:36] him
[1:39:36] and kick him and punch him and mock him
[1:39:39] and put a rag around his head
[1:39:41] and walked around and just sucker
[1:39:43] punched him took turns hitting them you
[1:39:45] imagine you're there
[1:39:46] and and you've already been scourged
[1:39:48] you've already got 39 lashes
[1:39:50] and now you've got this whole band of
[1:39:52] soldiers
[1:39:54] and they're beaten on you
[1:39:58] okay continue brother jack and they
[1:40:01] stripped him and put
[1:40:02] on him a scarlet robe and when they had
[1:40:05] planted
[1:40:06] a crown of thorns they put it upon his
[1:40:08] head
[1:40:09] and a reed in his right hand and they
[1:40:12] bowed the knee before him
[1:40:13] and mocked him saying hell king of the
[1:40:16] jews
[1:40:17] and they spit upon him and took the reed
[1:40:20] and smote him on the head and after that
[1:40:23] after they had mocked him they took the
[1:40:26] robe off
[1:40:27] from him and put his own raiment on him
[1:40:30] and led him away
[1:40:31] to crucify him and as they came out
[1:40:35] they found a man of cyrene simon by
[1:40:38] name him they compelled to bear
[1:40:42] his cross now when these roman soldiers
[1:40:46] crucifixion was the most horrible
[1:40:50] method of execution in the roman empire
[1:40:54] and these soldiers it was a common task
[1:40:57] for them
[1:40:58] to crucify murderers robbers
[1:41:01] all kind of of criminals and
[1:41:04] and so when somebody was going to be
[1:41:07] crucified
[1:41:08] as they were being led up to the place
[1:41:10] where the cross was
[1:41:12] no doubt they were screaming and
[1:41:14] swearing
[1:41:15] and pleading and begging for their life
[1:41:18] and how brother branham said a demon
[1:41:20] possessed a man
[1:41:21] sometimes they have four or five times
[1:41:23] the power
[1:41:24] of a natural man and so these roman
[1:41:27] soldiers they were used to
[1:41:29] all kind of scenes as they were going to
[1:41:32] crucify
[1:41:32] and they always outnumbered the one that
[1:41:34] was going to be crucified
[1:41:36] maybe they had a couple of guys hold
[1:41:38] down the hand a couple of guys hold down
[1:41:40] the feet
[1:41:42] then in verse 45 brother jack
[1:41:46] 30 35 i'm sorry and they crucified him
[1:41:50] and parted his garments casting lots
[1:41:53] that it might be fulfilled
[1:41:55] which was spoken by the prophet they
[1:41:58] parted my garments among them
[1:42:00] and upon my vesture did they cast
[1:42:03] locks and sitting down
[1:42:06] they watched him there and set up over
[1:42:09] his head
[1:42:10] his uh set up over his head his
[1:42:12] accusation written
[1:42:13] this is jesus the king of the jews now
[1:42:16] no doubt he was a spectacle
[1:42:18] no doubt all the jewish leaders that
[1:42:20] were responsible
[1:42:22] for this plot to get him killed they
[1:42:24] were all there
[1:42:25] and a great big crowd of people that had
[1:42:27] heard all about jesus and his ministry
[1:42:30] and the miracle worker and so his
[1:42:32] crucifixion
[1:42:33] caused a lot of people to come and
[1:42:36] gather and no doubt
[1:42:37] some were just you know cursing and
[1:42:40] all kind you can just imagine this this
[1:42:43] mob scene
[1:42:44] we've seen some mob scenes in the last
[1:42:46] summer time that we've gone through
[1:42:48] so you can imagine what this mob scene
[1:42:50] was like continued brother jack
[1:42:52] then were there two thieves crucified
[1:42:55] with him
[1:42:56] one on the right hand and another on the
[1:42:58] left now some people think there was a
[1:43:00] good thief and a bad thief
[1:43:02] they were both thieves and they were
[1:43:05] both
[1:43:05] casting insults and cursing at jesus
[1:43:08] but the thief on the right something
[1:43:10] happened to him
[1:43:13] i believe he was one of the first ones
[1:43:15] to experience the third pull
[1:43:18] something happened to him and he said
[1:43:20] lord
[1:43:21] remember me when you come into your
[1:43:23] kingdom and jesus said
[1:43:25] this day you will be with me in paradise
[1:43:30] continue brother jack and they
[1:43:33] that passed by reviled him wagging their
[1:43:36] heads
[1:43:37] and saying thou that destroys the temple
[1:43:39] and builders it in three days
[1:43:41] save thyself if thou be the son of god
[1:43:44] come down from the cross
[1:43:46] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[1:43:48] him with the scribes and elders said
[1:43:51] he saved others himself he cannot save
[1:43:54] if he be the king of israel let him now
[1:43:57] come down from the cross
[1:43:59] and we will believe him imagine this
[1:44:01] cynicism
[1:44:02] and sarcasm that is spewing from these
[1:44:05] chief priests
[1:44:06] and the scribes and the pharisees and
[1:44:08] all of them go ahead brother jack
[1:44:10] he trusted in god let him deliver him
[1:44:14] now
[1:44:14] if he will have him for he said i am the
[1:44:18] son of god
[1:44:19] the thieves also which were crucified
[1:44:21] with him cast the same
[1:44:23] in his teeth now from the sixth hour
[1:44:26] there was darkness over all the land
[1:44:28] unto the ninth hour it was early
[1:44:30] for the sixth hour to come and there be
[1:44:32] darkness on the land
[1:44:33] yeah and about the ninth hour
[1:44:36] jesus christ with a loud voice saying
[1:44:38] eli eli
[1:44:40] lama sabachthani that is to say my god
[1:44:43] my god
[1:44:44] why hast thou forsaken me continue
[1:44:47] brother jack some of them that stood
[1:44:49] there
[1:44:49] when they heard that and this man uh
[1:44:52] said this man called for elijah
[1:44:55] and straightway one of them ran and took
[1:44:57] a sponge and filled it with vinegar and
[1:44:59] put it on a
[1:45:00] on a reed uh and gave him to drink
[1:45:03] the rest said let be let us see where
[1:45:06] the elijah would come to save him
[1:45:08] jesus when he had cried again with the
[1:45:11] loud voice yielded up the ghosts
[1:45:13] he yielded up the ghost if he had not
[1:45:16] yielded up the ghost
[1:45:17] he could have been on that cross
[1:45:18] indefinitely he yielded up his life
[1:45:23] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:45:25] written twain
[1:45:26] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[1:45:29] did quake
[1:45:30] and the rocks rim and the gra and the
[1:45:32] graves were open and many bodies of the
[1:45:35] saints which slept the rose
[1:45:37] and came out of the graves after his
[1:45:39] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:45:41] and appeared unto many now you'll never
[1:45:43] have
[1:45:43] any denominational bible teacher or
[1:45:46] seminarian
[1:45:47] give you an accurate description and a
[1:45:50] revelation
[1:45:51] of what happened here they came out of
[1:45:54] the graves
[1:45:55] after his resurrection and went into the
[1:45:59] city
[1:45:59] and appeared unto many right
[1:46:03] like brother branham said abraham and
[1:46:05] sarah they said lord
[1:46:06] would it be okay if we took kind of a
[1:46:08] whistle-stop tour
[1:46:10] around jerusalem and jesus yeah we're
[1:46:12] going to be here for a while
[1:46:14] and so they went and then they saw they
[1:46:16] were going to be recognized
[1:46:18] and they disappeared so they could
[1:46:21] appear
[1:46:21] and disappear right now going back to
[1:46:24] leviticus
[1:46:25] the fine flour and the oil
[1:46:30] and the frankincense no leaven
[1:46:34] no honey and salt
[1:46:37] so the widow woman she picked up a
[1:46:39] portion of that
[1:46:40] but then jesus came he was the bread of
[1:46:43] life
[1:46:44] that came down from heaven anointed
[1:46:48] with the oil of the holy ghost
[1:46:51] no leaven no honey he was not a honey
[1:46:55] christian
[1:46:56] he was a real man
[1:47:00] and he had salt there was a preservative
[1:47:04] he said he that endureth until the end
[1:47:07] the same
[1:47:08] shall be saved and
[1:47:13] when jesus was on the earth he carried
[1:47:17] many burdens
[1:47:18] and many burdens he carried inside
[1:47:22] maybe like the oven experience
[1:47:26] but then when the pressure started
[1:47:27] coming then it turned into
[1:47:30] a a pan and people could see the
[1:47:33] pressure
[1:47:34] and they could see the persecution
[1:47:37] coming
[1:47:38] but then on the cross
[1:47:41] it turned into a frying pan right
[1:47:45] the whole world could look at him and
[1:47:47] they could see what he was going through
[1:47:51] and in the greatest trial
[1:47:55] in the greatest suffering the most
[1:47:59] precious
[1:48:00] fragrance that frankincense
[1:48:04] was released upon the world
[1:48:08] the grace jesus knew that the cross
[1:48:12] that was the crowning portion of his
[1:48:15] ministry
[1:48:17] while the world thought he was an abject
[1:48:19] failure
[1:48:21] capital punishment
[1:48:25] at the cross was his greatest
[1:48:28] crowning achievement
[1:48:33] and now i'm going to sit down for a
[1:48:35] minute where you folks are sitting down
[1:48:39] because now i want to talk about
[1:48:43] you and me
[1:48:46] because right here this this flesh
[1:48:50] this is our meal and this
[1:48:53] meal needs to be anointed with oil
[1:48:57] with the holy ghost amen and then the
[1:49:01] leavens gotta go
[1:49:04] and no honey
[1:49:09] excuse me just a moment
[1:49:26] it's not
[1:49:43] so we're not
[1:49:46] not to be a honey christian all right
[1:49:48] that's right
[1:49:54] and like the woman had those
[1:49:58] two sticks finally
[1:50:01] we have to get on the cross
[1:50:06] and lay down like jesus did
[1:50:09] and wait for the nails to come
[1:50:12] and your trial it may be
[1:50:16] a oven experience maybe you're the
[1:50:20] you'll be the only one that knows about
[1:50:22] it
[1:50:31] or maybe just you and your family
[1:50:35] and the pastor knows about
[1:50:41] well then sometimes that trial goes to
[1:50:44] be
[1:50:46] a pen experience and more people know
[1:50:49] about it
[1:50:50] and maybe something happens in your
[1:50:52] family maybe has nothing to do with you
[1:50:54] but it brings shame
[1:50:56] on your family and everybody knows about
[1:50:59] it
[1:51:00] and people start to gossip and they talk
[1:51:04] gossip is a dainty morsel eaten with
[1:51:07] great relish
[1:51:09] brother branham said when you begin to
[1:51:10] gossip just mark it down
[1:51:13] the holy ghost has just left you
[1:51:16] he said he can't stand that kind of a
[1:51:18] spirit he said now he's not gone far
[1:51:21] away
[1:51:22] he said how do you get him to come back
[1:51:25] just become
[1:51:26] a lamb again
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:29] or maybe your trial it becomes a frying
[1:51:33] pan trial
[1:51:34] maybe you backslid or something horrible
[1:51:37] happens
[1:51:38] in your family and the whole church and
[1:51:42] everybody knows and they're talking
[1:51:46] and they're looking and they're thinking
[1:51:49] about
[1:51:50] what's happened to you
[1:51:53] but like jesus when he went through his
[1:51:56] greatest trial
[1:51:58] on the cross waited for the nails to
[1:52:01] come
[1:52:02] and when they lifted him up and all the
[1:52:05] people came about wagging their finger
[1:52:08] at him
[1:52:09] and mocking him oh you think you're from
[1:52:12] god
[1:52:12] you think you've got god inside of you
[1:52:15] and they just
[1:52:16] laugh and they ridicule and they mark
[1:52:18] and the
[1:52:19] sarcasm and the skepticism comes
[1:52:23] and you wonder lord how can i how can i
[1:52:26] stand this
[1:52:27] how can i handle this how can i ever
[1:52:29] come back from this
[1:52:31] and you know many people they are in
[1:52:33] that state right now
[1:52:35] they are in a backslidden condition
[1:52:38] and many of those people they would like
[1:52:41] to come back
[1:52:44] but pride holds them back
[1:52:48] and they say what what are people going
[1:52:51] to think
[1:52:52] they know what i've done they know
[1:52:54] what's happened
[1:52:55] i i just can't stand it to go and think
[1:52:58] that they have to sit in the church and
[1:53:00] face all those people knowing what
[1:53:02] they're thinking
[1:53:07] you know what we've got to be like the
[1:53:10] father
[1:53:10] of the prodigal son waiting for somebody
[1:53:15] to come back
[1:53:16] looking for them to come back and when
[1:53:18] they come back
[1:53:19] run run to meet them run to welcome them
[1:53:24] let them know how thankful you are that
[1:53:26] they're home
[1:53:27] that they're back that they're back in
[1:53:30] the arms of god
[1:53:32] brother jack if you read first
[1:53:34] thessalonians chapter 4
[1:53:36] and verse 13.
[1:53:42] remember when jesus was on the cross
[1:53:44] when he gave up the ghost
[1:53:46] then the bodies of the saints which
[1:53:49] slept
[1:53:50] arose and came out of the graves and
[1:53:53] appeared unto
[1:53:54] many brothers jack would you read that
[1:53:57] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[1:53:59] brethren concerning them which
[1:54:01] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:54:04] others which have no hope
[1:54:13] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:54:16] rose again
[1:54:17] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:54:20] will god bring with him
[1:54:23] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:54:25] the lord
[1:54:26] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:54:30] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:54:32] them
[1:54:32] which are asleep
[1:54:36] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:54:39] heaven
[1:54:40] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:54:42] archangel
[1:54:44] and with the trump of god and the dead
[1:54:46] and christ shall rise
[1:54:48] first
[1:54:51] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:54:54] be caught up together with them
[1:54:56] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[1:54:58] air
[1:54:59] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:55:04] wherefore comfort one another
[1:55:07] with these words now friends that the
[1:55:10] types are perfect
[1:55:12] from leviticus the meal the oil
[1:55:16] the frankincense no honey no leaven
[1:55:19] and salt then the winter woman comes and
[1:55:21] she picks up
[1:55:23] she's got the meal she's got the oil
[1:55:25] she's got the two sticks
[1:55:26] then jesus comes he is the bread of life
[1:55:29] that come down from heaven
[1:55:30] anointed with the holy ghost no honey
[1:55:33] no leaven and salt to preserve him and
[1:55:36] on the cross
[1:55:38] in his greatest trial in that
[1:55:41] frying pan experience the frankincense
[1:55:44] is released
[1:55:46] now we are the the life of god
[1:55:49] we are god we are messiahs walking in
[1:55:52] this human body
[1:55:55] and when the bride brother branham said
[1:55:58] fully
[1:55:59] recognizes who she is then
[1:56:03] the rapture will take place so the only
[1:56:06] thing
[1:56:06] holding the rapture back now is for the
[1:56:09] rest of the bride
[1:56:11] to fully recognize who she is
[1:56:14] and get on the cross and become
[1:56:17] that living sacrifice holy acceptable
[1:56:21] unto god
[1:56:22] which is our reasonable service
[1:56:25] god bless your saints let's stand
[1:56:30] amen
[1:56:34] which is our reasonable
[1:56:37] service and you say well brother you
[1:56:39] don't know what i've been through
[1:56:41] you don't know the trials that i'm going
[1:56:43] through

[1:56:47] paul
[1:56:50] five times he got 39 lashes 195 lashes
[1:56:55] three times beaten with rods
[1:56:58] once they stoned him left them for dead
[1:57:00] he'd brushed himself off
[1:57:02] picked himself up and went to the next
[1:57:04] meeting
[1:57:07] and then later on he said this
[1:57:10] light affliction worketh for us a far
[1:57:15] greater rewarding glory let's bow our
[1:57:18] heads

[2:05:51] thank you jesus my god
[2:05:56] well i don't know if i actually got the
[2:06:00] title to the sermon but what i can
[2:06:03] tell you is that it was a continuation
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:07] [Applause]
[2:06:11] from what the lord spoke to us on last
[2:06:13] week and
[2:06:15] and i feel like he brothers brother
[2:06:17] ernie just kept
[2:06:19] emphasizing the word oh oh oh
[2:06:22] and as they start walking through the
[2:06:24] scripture i think all
[2:06:26] recognize that it was god speaking to us
[2:06:29] i mean only god could do things like
[2:06:31] this
[2:06:32] this is what make church real right this
[2:06:35] is what makes it sincere when you can
[2:06:38] come into the house of god and know that
[2:06:40] you've heard directly from god
[2:06:42] no way brother ernie comes all the way
[2:06:44] from the state of washington
[2:06:47] other side of the united states and
[2:06:50] starts walking right through the sermon
[2:06:51] last week i say only god can do
[2:06:54] something like that
[2:06:55] that was all right even using word for
[2:06:58] word
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:05] the enemy was fighting him in order to
[2:07:08] stop him from bringing forth that
[2:07:10] and uh and one thing i do want to say uh
[2:07:13] uh
[2:07:14] i felt that the holy spirit just uh
[2:07:17] emphasized this through the sermon and
[2:07:20] just talked about how we go through
[2:07:24] different trials and some of our trials
[2:07:26] are just in the oven
[2:07:29] don't nobody know about it but us and
[2:07:32] maybe a few people that's about it and
[2:07:34] then sometimes it
[2:07:36] it's a pan experience a few other people
[2:07:39] know about what you've gone through
[2:07:41] you know and and uh and maybe it's just
[2:07:43] shared amongst them just
[2:07:44] inside the panhandle but then they
[2:07:46] become a frying pan
[2:07:49] and when you hear the frying pan it's
[2:07:51] like everybody knows like your stuff all
[2:07:53] over
[2:07:54] social media right
[2:07:57] and you just ain't nothing you can do it
[2:07:59] and all you can do is bear
[2:08:01] the reproach of what you've done but
[2:08:04] what i can tell you is that god got
[2:08:06] grace
[2:08:08] and i'm gonna tell you his grace is big
[2:08:10] grace
[2:08:13] great grace
[2:08:16] grace that is greater than all our sins
[2:08:19] and if you would just receive the word
[2:08:21] of the lord god will
[2:08:22] cleanse you from whatever it is that
[2:08:24] you've done wrong there's nothing you
