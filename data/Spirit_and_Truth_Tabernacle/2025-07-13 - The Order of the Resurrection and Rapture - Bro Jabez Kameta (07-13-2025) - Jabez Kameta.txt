Um, so we have um service this Wednesday and as uh I mentioned we have a brother Gideon uh from Nigeria that will be with us on uh on on Wednesday. So let's look forward to that. Uh also our uh streaming will continue. I know this morning we're having a little issue I believe with our streaming on our church website. um and uh trying to get that sorted out. But uh streaming will continue on Facebook and and and our church website uh john423.org. Facebook is SAT Tabernacle Sisters will be having virtual prayer uh on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. Uh Friday, July 18th, the musicians here at our church will be coming for a rehearsal uh here at uh the at from 7 to 9 on Friday. So keep that in mind. Um as we are approaching the meetings, there won't be any service on Wednesday, July 23rd. And as I mentioned, uh we will be um needing all hands on deck on um July 24th. We have to go and get some equipment out of storage organ and um some other things there that we need to take up to the um the location to set up on Thursday. Uh so please keep that in mind on uh that'll be July 24th. All the brothers that can help out be greatly appreciated. Um, we mentioned a few weeks ago that we uh have been given the opportunity to transition to another location and we'll be having our new our first service there will be on a Wednesday night. It'll be the Wednesday night following the meetings uh on July 30th at 7:30 p.m. and the u the the location is 2922 Jog Road. It is pretty much the corner of Jock Road and 10th Avenue. And if you're leaving here going towards 10th Avenue, there's a road called Constitution Way, I believe. You make a left on Constitution Way, you'll see a big old sign say church right in the corner of the plaza. That's where it will be. The name of the church is called Eagles Rest. Uh Eagles Rest. Uh so 2922 Jock Road. And as brother Troy was saying, our services uh the time will change for our Sunday morning service, Sunday school will change. Um and we'll start presenting those times to everybody too, so that they'll know uh what time to be there, but we have to start like an hour earlier. Uh all right. So the um um the the choir has one more rehearsal on July 25th. That's at 400 p.m. And that is um right before we have the night of worship which starts at 7:30 uh p.m. All right. Uh our meetings I will restore saying the Lord uh July 25th through 27th at Palm Beach Gardens High School. And um I believe the times for the services, Friday night at 7:30, Saturday morning, 10:30. Saturday night at 6:00 p.m. Sunday morning at 10:30. Sunday night at 6:00 p.m. All right. And also some upcoming meetings there in in Columbia, South Carolina. Labor Day meetings. Pastor Henry Sim Simmons will be having meetings there in um Columbia, South Carolina. All right. Our giving is uh multiple ways. Those that are inside the sanctuary, we do have a box in the back that you can use for your giving. Uh those that are online, we have Zale, PayPal, and Cash App. Preferred method is Zale because they do not take fees. But uh um if you have to use Zel or PayPal, it's giving at john423.org. And cash app is dollar sign spirit t. And we have a mailing address, too, if you want to mail uh your giving in. Amen. Let's have a word of prayer over our giving. Amen. Father, we thank you for uh the opportunity to be able to give back to you as you have given to us. And we trust Lord Jesus that um you would use this for the furtherance of your kingdom. We also God want to just ask that you would as we give that you would manifest your word on behalf of your people because you said that if we brought our tithing and our offering uh into the house of the Lord. You gave us a promise that you would rebuke the devour for our sake. Not only would you do that, you said that you would open up the windows of heaven. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And that you would pour out a blessing &gt;&gt; where we have room, not enough to receive. And and God, I know that as we're approaching the meetings, um many are being attacked in their finances. So, Father, this morning, we're asking for that release as you promised it in your word. And we know uh we know that you don't fail. Not in your word. every promise you made, the prophet told us that you would bankrupt heaven &gt;&gt; uh before your word would fall to the ground. So Lord, we ask and we know that it's nothing but the enemy that is trying to block the people from their blessings. So Father, this morning we come with the authority of the word of the Lord. We rebuke the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you say what we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. So we loose the flow of finances. Even right now in the name of Jesus, we loose it in every home. We loose it in everyone that desires to come to these meetings. We loose it right now in the name of Jesus. And God, we're expecting to see and hear great things in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Couple things I just need to make mention of. Um on Tuesday night, brothers were in prayer and um I believe brother Maris had mentioned he says you know I just have this strong burden to pray for brother Jean obvious you all know brother Jean had a stroke tends there at rapture faith um tabernacle and he had a stroke and a few of us brothers went to visit him um in the hospital a few I guess a few months ago and um so brother Maris said I just I haven't heard about what's going on with him. We just I just feel led that we should pray for him. I said, "Okay, brother." So, we put him on the prayer list that night and we prayed. And I want to say two days later, I got a telephone call from Brother Jean. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And Brother Jean told me to tell the church, "Thank you for praying." Uh he says he's been totally healed. [Music] Oh, won't he do it? &gt;&gt; And um so he just wanted the church to know that he's doing much better. Uh his I could hear him very clearly. His speech was not slurred in any way. And uh but he said God had totally healed him and he's doing doing very well. So he's back home. He's no longer in the hospital. He's back home and and just uh getting getting about with life. So, we thank God for touching brother J. We certainly thank God for touching him. So, good to have uh Brother Steven and Sister Rachel in there with us on today. Praise the Lord. Amen. And and I have a a thank you. Um thank you very much that I want to read to you all. Um, it says to my SAT family, thank you for your prayers and continued support. Uh, every prayer was deeply felt and appreciated. It's comforting to know that we have a team of prayer warriors to help us through some of the the hardest moments of our lives. Uh, your requests have met God's ears and has and he has answered them. We are excited to soon introduce you all to Baby Thunderberg. [Applause] Heat [Applause] up here. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] the uh man brothers was just sharing with me that he uh he sat down there in the chair this morning and Uh, he just wrote on an envelope. He He showed it to me. See, he wrote it on an envelope. Sister Rachel's going to have a baby. They didn't even know. [Music] It says, "Thank you for being on this faith journey with us. Looking forward to celebrating this new life with you soon. Love the funies." Um, I was um reminded of a um a dream that one of the brothers had here and he shared with me could have been a couple years ago. I I don't we have to go back and get the date now. But he had told me uh there was two things in this dream that that that happened. He said we were the first thing I remember he says we weren't at this church. We were somewhere else. We were we were in in a service but we weren't here. We were somewhere else. And he said I turned and I looked and he said I and I saw Sister Rachel with a bump. &gt;&gt; That's that's what he told me. So it's uh I think it's nothing but the uh plan of God &gt;&gt; because he in the dream there were two things happened. We had moved &gt;&gt; and Sister Rachel had a bump. &gt;&gt; So y'all see over the bump and y'all know we got to move. &gt;&gt; So it's it's this is nothing but God. Nothing but God. Right. and uh we we celebrate with brother Steven and sister Rachel. Uh I believe this is year seven for their marriage. Um and we have all been on this journey together. Um I know last year we went to London and when we went there um had a prayer line for especially for those that were not conceiving and um and God has answered. Uh God has answered. So ask that you continue to keep uh them in your prayers that everything will go well. But with this confirmation this morning from brother Capers, not even knowing, &gt;&gt; right? Uh we know everything going to be all right. &gt;&gt; We know everything going to be all right. We know everything going to be all right. So praise God. &gt;&gt; Ain't God good? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just saw you shout. [Music] &gt;&gt; I saw you. &gt;&gt; Now I know what's inside you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know what's inside you. [Music] &gt;&gt; God is good. all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um this morning I have a dear friend of mine coming to minister for us and uh brother JZ and I go back a long way. Um the um we used to fellowship together in the meetings and Pen Harris um and uh um you know just since that time uh we've all taken some different paths but somehow uh through taking these different paths God allowed us to reconnect. And I was in Jamaica a few years ago and and he and I preached some meetings together in Jamaica. And then um he and I ended up in Ghana together preaching some meetings and he reminded me of one of the sermons that I preached there in Ghana. And um uh but just he could tell that we were both kind of on this same journey together and uh uh so just grateful he's got I got a very kindred spirit with him and so happy that he is able to be here with us this morning. Uh brother JZ Kmeta. Amen. coming to us from uh Nigeria. Amen. And I just believe God's going to use him in a very very special way for our church. Amen. Let's stand to our feet.

A million reign with Christ a thousand years on the earth. &gt;&gt; That is why we sing that Satan will be bound a thousand years &gt;&gt; and that we have no tempter then. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are testifying about that. &gt;&gt; We are holding to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was saying also in the seals trying to uh make us understand because it is very important that we know uh the hour and uh we are living in and what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he was sitting in the seventh seal. He said, "Did you notice?" He's telling the church now, the bride said, "Did you notice at the last angel message, which is Malachi 4, the trumpet sounds?" &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you are following what he's saying? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; He said the first angel's message, a trumpet sound. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The second angel sound the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And when he sent out say notice when the seals were announced in our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were all in one great divine thing.

Believe it how this &gt;&gt; believe this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So say now what will happen now? The trumpet of God, this is what he said. The trumpet of God, Amen. Uh shall sound. The last trump, Amen. that Paul spoke of. Amen. So the last trump will blast the same time that this last angel is given his message. And that last seal is open. &gt;&gt; Right, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So under your seal, there's a blast of a trumpet. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the redeemer comes forth to take his redeemed possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His church, the blood watch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in broken system, he was not saying there. It was thanking God that those who slept in a lot in message and in this age he say well don't worry just having a short nap. Amen. &gt;&gt; He say it's just a short nap you're having. &gt;&gt; So he was saying and I said then they which were alive and remained remain shall not hinder those which are as are sleeping. So for the trump of God and I said that last trump. Amen. And I say the sixth one had just sounded. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The sixth one had just sounded and of course you know the sixth trumpet sound under the fifth seal. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And where one where the Jews 6 million Jews was massacred. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. By it &gt;&gt; amening the rest of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said and 2 million demon were released under that trumpet say supernatural devils 2 million devils chargers was sent forth on the Jews on the natural standpoint. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And under the same seal this same 2 million devils he sent forth against the bride on a super aical standpoint. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You understand? Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I need to call out the loose end." &gt;&gt; Otherwise, don't be panic when you see people denying the message, rejecting the message, putting out of the message, attacking the prophet. Amen. 2 million devils are just called them out. &gt;&gt; Are you for him? &gt;&gt; Just as the prophet said in the feast of the trumpet, he said to call out all those loose hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. That just hanging in the message. &gt;&gt; Are you for him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And it will be loose on the under that for seal. Amen. This same 2 million devils will be under that first seal will be on the foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; We haunt them like dogs. &gt;&gt; Do you get a church? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he now said the sixth one have sounded. Amen. And the last trumpet say and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Amen. Amen. Just just rest till that time. Speaking to the bride, the church. Amen. So six said, "What is a trumpet?" We got to understand what a trumpet is. He said, "What is a trumpet?" Said trumpet was declaring a war. &gt;&gt; And the trumpet sound, it declare a war. While the seal reveal a mystery. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Like the sixth trumpet, what it do? It declare a war. &gt;&gt; The fifth trumpet declare war. And of course you understand Abraham said the fifth trumpet was was in the first world war. Amen. The plague that was sent forth under that trumpet was a fla that came upon the earth. Are you following? On first world war. And then the six trumpet sounded. What do we see? We can see the plague on the earth. Amen. Upon the they say the the the foolish I mean the Jews 6 million Jews being slaughtered. And you see the plague that came upon the earth. All this demon like HIV. All this demon like a cancer. or all kind of devils on earth now. &gt;&gt; Pigs upon the world, not the bride to touch them not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said we come come across those my believers, my sons and daughters that have the oil and wine see that thou hot them not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you get a church? Amen. So it was said the trumpet was to declare is declaring a war, &gt;&gt; right? He said the trumpet always denote war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The messenger the age the angel come to the earth uh the messenger of the hour like Luther like the uh any of the messengers that uh we talk of space see what does it do? He arrives on earth arrive and a seal open. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me? &gt;&gt; Revealed. Are you following? Revealed. Then a trumpet sound. &gt;&gt; Right. war. &gt;&gt; Are you for him? &gt;&gt; War declared, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And away they go. &gt;&gt; And then the messenger die and he seal away his group &gt;&gt; the believers and put in there put in a plague fall upon those who reject the message. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; praise God. But you know, man is always like that. They always thank God for what God will do in future but they fail to see what God is doing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. They thank God what God will do in the past and look forward in the future but the what is going on now they failed to see it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They get a church. So now I believe we are here. We're here now because we believe that there's going to be a rapture of the bride. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we're sitting here. &gt;&gt; That's how we come to church. That's why we sing and dance and preach because we believe there's going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the bride. See, Apostle Paul said in first chapter 4, he said that the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Is that right? So at this last trumpet, we shall be changed in a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. Just as in just in the twinkle of my eye, these immortal bodies shall put on immortality. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and we're looking for this great coming event. Are you looking for it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God promised it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that Paul in his uh in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, he said, I show you a mystery. That's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; He said, we all shall not sleep, otherwise we that are alive here will not prevent those that have slept. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, but we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to stop it. All right. &gt;&gt; Your body change, Amen. is compulsory. &gt;&gt; A is absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. You shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How? I don't know. But God said so. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but he did not reveal the mystery. Paul did not reveal the mystery of the translation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, but revealed the mystery of this rapture to you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he said, "Three things happened as the Lord descend out of heaven." Are you following? He said, "A shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God, and the Lord does all three of them as he is descending." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you get it? &gt;&gt; He does all three of them as descending. &gt;&gt; In rapture say, three things happen. &gt;&gt; A shout, a voice, a trump &gt;&gt; has to happen before the Lord appear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you get it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now a shout. Jesus does all three of them. &gt;&gt; When he is descending, &gt;&gt; are you following? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As he's coming down, a shout went forth. &gt;&gt; He descended voice went out descending. Then the trump of God. Don't forget that he's not stepping his feet on the earth. It is you and I is going to meet him in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are going up to meet him in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he said a shout. What is a shout? It's a message. Now, the prophet telling us what it is. It's a message going forth. Amen. First, the living bread of life bringing forth the bride. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A shout, a message getting the people ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you get that? So, you see, uh, where we are right now, we are believers of this end time message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can stand for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. that will believe the message. Are you getting me? And this message, you know what it is? It called us out because Abraham said that we are taken into the mystery of the seven seal &gt;&gt; which is the mystery of the going away. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet William is the messenger to the seven seal. Did you get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the seven seal called us out. Are you following? And with as a shout message and then where we are, we are in the rapture express. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me? &gt;&gt; Because the rapture is a process. &gt;&gt; Are you following? And the first process of the rapture is what has called you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you hear your name. &gt;&gt; Your name is the last book of life. &gt;&gt; And the word called you out &gt;&gt; and you respond to your name and now you are united in marriage &gt;&gt; with the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not married but you are married already. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; because the word have united with you. Right. &gt;&gt; You already in a marriage now. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only going for the wedding supper in the sky. &gt;&gt; But the marriage is here right now. &gt;&gt; Truth, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Abraham said that right in your hand you're wearing a wedding bound &gt;&gt; of predestination. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; And the amazing grace of God. &gt;&gt; The devil can't touch that. &gt;&gt; The enemy can't touch that. &gt;&gt; Corruption know his own. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see get not ready. Then the second is the voice of the resurrection. Do you get that? Second, the voice of the resurrection. Now he said the same voice the loud voice. Amen. That in St. John chapter 11:38. Amen. To 40 44. Amen. That that call that called Lazarus from the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you get you all know I called Lazarus from the grave? I went on a went went on a trip, mission trip. Praise God. And he told the disciples that our friend Lazarus sleep. Amen. Then they said that, "Well, if you sleep, you do well." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they don't understand what he's talking about. They said, "Well, let me speak to their language." They said, "Well, our friend Lazarus, Amen, is dead, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And they said, "Then let us go and die with him. Let's go and die with him." Right. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Let us go and wake him up." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they went back and it was a 4-day trip. Amen. And when they get get into the city, here come master matter how he came. As she came in and said, "Uh, master, uh, if you have been here, your friend Lazarus would have died." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't forget, we are his friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are Jesus friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. He said your friend Lazarus will have died. Said but even now Lord whatever you ask the father he will give it to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus Jesus said your my friend Lazarus shall live again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall live again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Matthew say yes I believe that they shall live again at the resurrection of the dead. You see he postponed the promise and but Jesus said I am the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I am the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Let us go and wake him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I get to that place there. You see that the condition of Lazarus that is why you see that's the same condition of the church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Lazarus was already burned in grave clothes and then sealed up in the tomb. They cut him out of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Seal the tomb says it's hopeless on Lazarus. &gt;&gt; He can't make it again. Praise God. You know sometimes the devil can try to get you know our family, our children, wife, husband, all kind of things around us, put circumstances around us and make it like as if impossible situation. But let me tell you the devil is only playing &gt;&gt; with time. Are you following? But at the appointed time, the devil can stop that. &gt;&gt; No matter what it is, &gt;&gt; your loved one will be there. &gt;&gt; That is the promise that God gave. He said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; Thee and thy house." &gt;&gt; Did you say that? &gt;&gt; Did he say that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I said, and they and their offsprings shall be dead. &gt;&gt; He said that. &gt;&gt; So your sons and daughters, your wife cannot miss it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; many of times we think that well no they can they cannot be they cannot make it. After the sister came to meet Abraham he said brother Bill he said my husband is not a seed of God. Abraham said why do you say that? He said you know I've been praying for my husband. I've witness to her to him but he just wouldn't believe. There's nothing in him to believe. He said I I have prayed and prayed and there's nothing nothing happening. Uh my husband I think that he's a serpent seed. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Abraham said okay wait let me let me take a look. Amen. And this is how sat down. Abraham say hey sister said look at it. Can you see? He said there there you are. You and your husband h in a million. Look at how you are holding hand in hand in a million. You and your husband holy hand in hand in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. As a sister, you go home. Amen. She shall be there. &gt;&gt; It shall be there. Your wife shall be there. Your husband shall be there. Your sons and daughters shall be there. &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to stop there. &gt;&gt; No matter what. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The hand of God are not shorten that they cannot save. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Say roll take off the tomb. Roll the tombs. Take it off. The stone. Roll that stone away. Praise God. And mother say, "Oh master, behold his stink. Behold his stinker. The situation is too bad. Taking the stone off it just the whole place will be disaster. Said behold stink. We shouldn't do that." Amen. And Jesus said, "Take off that tomb off &gt;&gt; because I need fellowship now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have cut Lazarus off for 4 days out of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Say, "I need a fellowship now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Roll that stone. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And they rolled the stone. Amen. You can see Jesus stand there and he look at the grave. And Abraham said if Jesus did not mention the name of Lazarus, he said all the dead in that place will have raised up &gt;&gt; because he's the resurrectional life. &gt;&gt; He said Lazarus Glory. &gt;&gt; And Lazarus who have been fellowship, Amen, right in eternity with them, Abraham and the rest of them, he heard his name. &gt;&gt; And it was a friend that is calling. Amen. It was a familiar voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, if you're not familiar with the voice of the archangel, &gt;&gt; with the voice of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; you cannot answer your name. &gt;&gt; It must be a familiar voice, &gt;&gt; with a familiar message, &gt;&gt; with a familiar word. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That is why Abraham said, "How can a bride, Amen, identify her mate?" &gt;&gt; How can she identify a mate? Except he's constantly on the word. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get a church. Amen. You must be familiar with that voice, the word, the voice word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Lazarus was familiar with that voice &gt;&gt; and he answer his name. He cut off the service and he came back. And we see that the Bible said a man that has been wrapped with grape clothes wrapped around lie on the grave that must stood up. Praise God. And a power pick him up to the door of the grave. &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said lose him and let him go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say lose him and let him go. And I'm saying this morning, whatever that ab bound you, whatever situation you find yourself, I speak to you in the name of the Lord, Satan, loose them and let them go. Loose them and let them go. Let them go in the name of Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me see there. &gt;&gt; God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said the voice of the archangel, the voice of the resurrection raise the dead sea to be caught up with him. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; So he was not telling us in question and answer &gt;&gt; as we move on question and answer is the first thing happen when we are resurrected.

Do you see that? In the rapturing grace of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then we will all get together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the resurrected sent. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when they begin to get together said then we which are alive &gt;&gt; and remain shall be changed &gt;&gt; when the resurrection come. &gt;&gt; Then we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; But just of a sudden said change these matters will not see death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See but just of a sudden there will be like a sweeping over us. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; See the promise &gt;&gt; say from place to place just overnight.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; I know Abraham called that &gt;&gt; Abraham called that redemption by power. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me church?

Amen. &gt;&gt; He found himself in Aats preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; A thought was he traveled like a with a thought &gt;&gt; and God have displayed that before. So it wasn't strange for Philip to believe that because no example like Enoch like Enoch walked with God. The Bible say it wasn't found. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had a testimony they please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember you remember Elijah Elijah on Mount Car camel. Praise God. When Elijah went before Ahab and tired of all the behavior of all these Israelites and so forth, you know, Elijah was be was tired of it because Jezebel has went out with scholarship and he has awarded the young people scholarship for sending to the Bible school and they have overrun the city and convert the whole Israel to Edenism &gt;&gt; until Elijah thought that he was the only one left. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the only one alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. And you see Elijah he was tired of the system and he went to meet Ahab met Ahab there. Amen. I said Ahab said well I'm in here for a business as a son of God. I said okay what do you want? Said let me tell you. &gt;&gt; So as I'm standing here there will be no doom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There will be no rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until I Elijah call for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they took the key of binding like the Bible said whatever you bind on earth. Even as you are sitting here, you can bind. &gt;&gt; Whatever you lose on, it shall be loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah got a hold of that key of binding &gt;&gt; and he lock up the heavens and put the key in his pocket. &gt;&gt; And Elijah went away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same authority is you have the same power. &gt;&gt; You having the same anointing because this Elijah's message. &gt;&gt; You are Elijah's believer. You see, you have the key, the same key that Elijah used. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amenise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah walked his way down. &gt;&gt; And we found out there was no rain. There was no due was looking for rain and looking for due and you know and called the Bon Bon you got to pray because God need to give us rain. You can't imagine them praying for three and a half years. No rain and no due. We are seeking the face of the Lord. You know God have to answer them. So I don't understand why you are praying for rain. I asking me to give you rain. I don't I I don't hold the rain. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that hold the rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say it's Elijah that hold the rain. &gt;&gt; If you look for Elijah, &gt;&gt; that is why Ahab was looking for Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet have said the Elijah hold the key of heaven. &gt;&gt; So you look for Elijah. &gt;&gt; Then you can have rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say Elijah came came down there and then called them for I man and then with this this message we bring the bride and the world council of churches to a manion showdown. &gt;&gt; You see that &gt;&gt; it will be a showdown between the bride and the big system. &gt;&gt; They cannot say that to watch the third then when the press come down watch that then &gt;&gt; do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they took Elijah down. Elijah have the children called the fire down. Of course, you know the story. And he said, Ahab said, "Come on now, you run, guide up thyself. Rain bid not for I hear a sound of abundant of rain." &gt;&gt; And Ahab enter into the charot and begin to drown in speed while Elijah was on Mount Camel. Are you getting it church? &gt;&gt; It was on Mount Camel with an acrobatic prayers. Praise God. At the end of the prayer as El as Ahab ran down to the gate of Jezrael, Elijah was standing at the gate of Jezrael &gt;&gt; waiting for Ahab. &gt;&gt; Elijah that he left on man camel. &gt;&gt; And there he was there standing at the gate of Jezrael. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Something must have happened. &gt;&gt; Elijah was translated &gt;&gt; from up from camel down to the gate of Jezrael. &gt;&gt; That same anointing is upon your life now. Not shall be, not will be. I said now. Now faith is &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now faith is &gt;&gt; a substance of things so far. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You think that in this rapture God is looking at you? &gt;&gt; God is not looking at you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; God looking at his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham told us in the message, I will certainly return to thee according to time of life. He told us what happened there. Amen. He said when when when when Sarah was waiting for that promise just like you're waiting for the promise of the rapture now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. To receive that son. He said but Sarah was you know was all filled with with wrinkles of unbelief all kind of ideas and you know she was so depressed with all kind of thought &gt;&gt; because of the circumstance of his body of her body. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I &gt;&gt; say all said all that s look was a look at the caravans that were coming from Egypt and they're going to Sodom and they was Mrs. Lot caravan fashion and fashion and so forth materials that are going forth and and Sarah will look at them when I hit Abraham say can you see it again can you see the caravan going now this is a new set of heat that is going now in Todd you see it Mrs. slot caravan. Can you see it? We cannot be sustained on this mountain like that. Have I been established or what's happening to me? Abra, can't you see that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, was brooding daily until he missed the visiting of angels. When the angels came down, three angels came down. You see, Lot did not receive three angels coming to them. &gt;&gt; But Abraham and Sarah received three angels &gt;&gt; that came down to Abraham. And Abraham, Amen, could see because he had the vision. Yes, &gt;&gt; Pastor Abraham. Praise God. He's a preacher. We shall be raptured. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah, we shall be changed. Sarah, &gt;&gt; we have a son. Sarah, &gt;&gt; praise God. I said, when will that end? Every service we shall have a son. We shall be raptured. Every service. When will the rapture take place? This about 20 years now. We be talking. We shall have a rapture. &gt;&gt; 25 years now. Abraham, 25 years now. &gt;&gt; Abra said, "Honey, don't worry. We shall have we shall have that son. We shall be raptured." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So Rabam said she was brooding. Sarah was brooding until he missed the angel sitting down there. He looked them like ordinary men. Are you getting me church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was in a tent after preparing their meal. And and these men were having conversation with with Abraham. And Abraham said, "Where is your wife Sarah?" Amen. Elohim said, "Where's your wife Sarah?" Abraham, "Where's your wife?" He said, "Oh, she's behind the tent. She's in our place." They said, "Oh, uh, I will come to you and Sarah, your wife shall have a son." Amen. I said, "I had it right in a tent." And the Bible say, she laughed. She smiled in her sleeve. What did she say? Said, "Can I of a shorty have a son at this old age? Look at my condition. How can I look at what I am faced? Look at all my circumstance. Look at what I'm facing in life. All this difficulties and so forth. Did God really love me? &gt;&gt; Praise God. If God love me, why should this thing be happening this way happen? &gt;&gt; How can I how will I have pleasure with my husband and my husband being old also? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Actually, naturally they are pastbearing time. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; She has a reason to doubt that. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And Elohim called Sarah said, "Come up Sarah." &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "Why did your wife Sarah laugh?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I said I jumped out. He said, "Who laughed?" Uh, who laughed? Said, "Abraham, you were there. You You are here. Do you hear me laugh?" And actually Abraham never heard her laugh. &gt;&gt; The Bible say she laughs. She smile. Honey, do you have me laugh? I never laugh. And Elohim say, "You laugh." I said, I said, "No, I never laugh." Elo said, "No, you laugh." You can see the conversation &gt;&gt; an unbelief conversation. &gt;&gt; Can you see that church? &gt;&gt; Now Abraham said God could have kissed Sarah instantly &gt;&gt; because Sarah was making God a liar. &gt;&gt; Are you following church? But God bypassed Sarah's circumstance. He said that is how God bypassed the church. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; He said if God will ever send his power to the church is it will not be on their merit. &gt;&gt; It will be by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say because Isaiah prophesied, he say, "Oh, the way finished over said, but yet he said Jerusalem was guilty of sin." Are you getting me church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, but God has wiped away our weakness. &gt;&gt; So, the same God is taking the message of William and is dealing with the faithful. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me church? &gt;&gt; He's dealing with the faithful. those who believe &gt;&gt; who really believe in him like Abraham are you getting me like Sarah &gt;&gt; are you following so he's not counting the circumstance at which is find herself he look at Abraham he said are we certain double sure return unto thee according to the time of life &gt;&gt; and Sarah shall have a son &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; nothing could stop that &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; because the next day Amen the last 20 uh uh 28 days you find that Elohim returned back not in the form of a man &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; not an angel coming back not a return ministry of some man &gt;&gt; are you getting me church &gt;&gt; but it was the spirit dynamics of God &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; that came down upon Sarah &gt;&gt; and change Sarah's body &gt;&gt; change Abraham's body &gt;&gt; look at that church &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I know some patients are waiting for Will Abraham come in again too? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I don't understand why the confusion go there because there are many quote there. He say I will write this one more time. Yes. It also said we will ride this one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then on the wings of his wife say and she will turn west. &gt;&gt; She &gt;&gt; she &gt;&gt; praise God. They say I we and they say and she &gt;&gt; why why would they take coming back? What about we? &gt;&gt; What about she the bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They should take all quotes together not take one and run away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when he said what you see me do now this thought put temporarily say you will see it done in the fullness of his power &gt;&gt; when the world counc. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So do you see that church right? &gt;&gt; So the bride had a ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's not a press play ministry. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now God did not send mechanical device to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; He sent men to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Fivefold ministry. There is Abraham said that it's a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So man still remain God's agency. Abraham said after a while we travel like a thought and you will see those then those who are already resurrected. You see that? He say what an hour. What an hour in the image of Christ. And now this is the order of the resurrection. We which are alive, remain shall not prevent them that are asleep. It said, "But the trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first. We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them." Now here is the order. He said, "Meet one another." Do you get it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said we will meet one another &gt;&gt; before we will meet him &gt;&gt; in the sky. &gt;&gt; We are going to meet one another first. &gt;&gt; Before we meet him, it say be caught up together with him with him to meet the Lord in the all together.

Amen. When he rose up and all the saints of God, Amen. rose up with him. Amen. And they went into the holy city and they were in fellowship. Amen. Abraham said that was talking about the resurrection ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. You see that they were in fellowship for 40 days. Amen.

Yet they said, "I will not believe." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Unless I say, &gt;&gt; Thomas is in the message. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's Thomases in our children. &gt;&gt; Praise God.

And he begin to release quote to quote &gt;&gt; what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This prophet said, &gt;&gt; this prophet said from Moses, the Psalms was expounding the scriptures and their heart was burning with them. This one is this is fireworks. &gt;&gt; Praise God. This preacher is so pious. &gt;&gt; He's so scriptural. &gt;&gt; Not from of all these unscriptural preachers. &gt;&gt; That cannot stay the bride. &gt;&gt; When you preach interpretation can stay the bride. &gt;&gt; It take the word to stir up the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is the bride food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And stir up the heart of these disciples.

Now Abraham said Jesus have a way of breaking his bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when he break his bread, he break his bread in a special way.

And Peter must have scratched and said, "This another voice again. This this this not the kind of a voice that told me that time that well we I should cast my cast my net." And I doubted and then my net broke. I cannot suffer loss because this net eh is on credit. It's on credit. &gt;&gt; The other one that broke is my net &gt;&gt; so I could enjoy it. &gt;&gt; But this one is somebody's net. I've not even pay for it. &gt;&gt; So if it break, I'll be in trouble. I have no fish to pay. They said, "Well, let me cast this net because I can't suffer loss." And he sent for the net.

Andraham said that if you come to church with a problem, with a need, &gt;&gt; with a desire, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; and then you go home the same way you come. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said you have insulted God. &gt;&gt; For you to go home the way you come, &gt;&gt; you said God is not able to do it. Oh my. &gt;&gt; You just insult God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now look at this uh demon of Gadra that Jesus crossed over this cl and they went to Gadra and that brother was bound with legion. He was in the tomb and the Bible said no man could tame him. Are you getting me? But when Jesus stepped in the coast, amen on that coast that day, you know the man look he said legion legion demons has invested their life in that brother. But despite the situation the brand make an advance &gt;&gt; and came to meet to came to meet to Jesus come to Jesus. But our problem is that we don't make any advance at all. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We don't make an attempt to step out to meet Jesus. &gt;&gt; All right. with that with our situation. &gt;&gt; You got to come to God's level. &gt;&gt; And then he met Jesus and Jesus speak with him. He said, "What is your name?" He say, "I am Legion." Demon speaking said because we are many. We are in charge. We are in control. We are many. And uh he said but have you come to destroy us before our time? Said please. Now this demon have to write a prayer request. &gt;&gt; Are you getting me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. They write they wrote a prayer request. &gt;&gt; He said I pray you don't just cast us away. &gt;&gt; Do you see those swine &gt;&gt; that is that pray investment? That man has invested so much in that swine. said, "But you know he doesn't pay his tithe." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He doesn't pay his tight. &gt;&gt; And he said he will send the devor and we are the devorh. Oh, he said we send the devil and he will devour him. Said then we pray you please just let us go there and devour that man finish his business. Enter that swine and send it to the sleep. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And demons demons are miserious. But I would ask the question, did Jesus answer his prayer? &gt;&gt; Did Jesus answer the demon's prayer? &gt;&gt; When he prayed, did did Jesus answer his prayer? &gt;&gt; Then if Jesus could answer a demon prayer, what about your prayers? &gt;&gt; What about your requests? What about your needs? So right now, I challenge you now. Whatever you desire now, don't insult God. Stand your feet. Say, "Lord, I come to take over. I come to take over. It is mine. It is mine. Today is my day. This is my time. I'm taking over. I'm taking possession. I'm taking possession." Oh God, if you can answer a demon prayer, what about my prayers now? &gt;&gt; I say speak to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak right this morning. Speak. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Speak. &gt;&gt; Present your request right now. &gt;&gt; Speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's here to meet your need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here to set a captive free. &gt;&gt; He's here to give you heart desire. &gt;&gt; He's here to meet your need. &gt;&gt; You're not going home the same. &gt;&gt; Not the same way you came.
