I uh &gt;&gt; certainly uh thank God for the specials and uh brother Solomon song leading the musicians. Appreciate each one in their respective places. Uh we'll go back to scripture reading uh for this morning out of Jeremiah 29. Amen. My my my my thank you Jesus. Um we last uh spoke on this um topic of inspiration during the restoration and I want to just kind of go forward uh in this. Jeremiah 29 is a one of those life For a lot of Christians, they turn to this chapter, especially when they get to verse um 11. And you know, it's kind of like Romans 8:28 kind of falls in that same category. Uh Jeremiah 29:11 is one of those life verses. And so many people uh you know, refer to it, which you know, I have used it, I will continue to use it as a life verse for me. But uh we must understand that there's greater meaning amen behind this. And uh I want to start at verse 10 because we get the greater meaning as we start at verse 10. says, "For thus sayeth the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place. Uh, for I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me, and find me when ye shall search me with all your heart. Uh, and I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you, sayeth the Lord, and I will bring you again into the place I cause you to be carried away captive. Uh, because you have said, "The Lord hath raised up prophets in Babylon." Amen. The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon. Amen. And Babylon is a place of confusion. So the very need for a prophet is to kind of establish you uh to bring you out of that place of confusion. It's very important that we listen to prophets. Amen. Very important. So uh let us have a word of prayer. Uh father we just thank you for this uh privilege to read the word. We know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us to uh understand what is being spoken to us in the word. So God we ask that you would just take control of our thoughts, those that are being presented, those that have been received and may you get all the glory from this portion of the service. Thank you for all that has happened thus far and I pray your continued blessings upon our gathering. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. Uh before I get started in this, I I I wanted to uh apologize to sister Sana. We forgot her birthday last week. Amen. We didn't announce it, but she had a birthday on last Monday. Amen. Happy birthday to Sister Sana. So, I believe her and Sister Nelly share birthdays. Is that right? Cuz Sister Nelly had a birthday Monday, too. So we thank God for giving them both another year. Amen. Amen. All right. So we we want to um um continue forward in this thought and you know they they they they were singing the song sister Tina you know song of song I don't mind waiting and then uh brother Solomon uh decided to follow it up with uh God ain't in no hurry. and uh you know and I didn't I didn't connect the dots until I was kind of you know meditating on what I was getting ready to say but this quote that I read for you all uh at the opening of this um this sermon the last time we preached I want to reread it again and you'll see how both of those songs connect right to this quote and uh it's out of the the sermon possessing the enemy's gates amen brother Brandham uh tells us there Um it says it was only a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shook up as is so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen uh the way that it's supposed to be. It's the very first one there um uh in the way that it's supposed to be. God makes it that way. God brings tensions into the church. He says, "And every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested." Amen. God brings tension into the church. Hallelujah. Because every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested. God knows that ain't that ain't nothing but the truth. He says he let sickness strike you. He lets disease come on you to test uh you and prove you. It's that it's the very first quote on the on the page says uh and uh to he says to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; My God. So I go through all this so God can show the world that I really am who I say I am. &gt;&gt; That I'm truly the seed of Abraham. And and when when we when we think about Abraham, you know, when we we sing the song, God in in a hurry, that man was uh the epitome of uh of demonstrating that God was not in a hurry. &gt;&gt; I mean, he had a promise and had to wait 25 years for the promise to be fulfilled. Now, here's the thing about Abraham. Good God almighty, the Bible does not say that Abraham complained while he waited. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but the scripture says that he was strong in faith and he was giving glory to God. Amen. He was he was all he was like praising God in advance for what was getting ready to happen. &gt;&gt; And church, rather than us complaining about our trials and complaining about our test, let us start worshiping God in advance for what he's getting ready to do. &gt;&gt; How do we know he's getting ready to do something? Because he said his word, I know &gt;&gt; the plans that I have for you. Prayers to prosper you. &gt;&gt; Prayers to give you hope and a future. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT WHAT GOD IS SAYING. I KNOW YOU AIN'T GOING TO STAY IN THE PLACE you in. Amen. Forever. YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT of this &gt;&gt; somehow someway. YOU'RE COMING OUT OF THIS PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SO, so we got to learn how to just worship God because God is getting glory in the midst of everything we're going through. If Abraham had not gone through the things he he went through, we would never have we would never be able to get strength from the the stories that that that are told about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. But here in this in this quote, it says this um he says uh he he God makes it that way. God brings tensions into the church. For every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested. He lets sickness strike you. He lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the seed of Abraham. He permits it by his own will. He permits disasters. He permits the friends to turn against you. He permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you. And he'll do all but take your life. He could throw you on a bed of affliction. He could turn your neighbors against you. He could turn the church against you. He can do almost anything. And it's God's will for him to do it. We are taught that it is more precious than gold to us. I I believe that. I thank God. And I have to be encouraged by my own son. God ain't in no hurry. &gt;&gt; God ain't in no hurry. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I He going to bring us through. &gt;&gt; Amen. He gonna bring us through. &gt;&gt; We'll come out in a wealthy place. &gt;&gt; My God. Let us see. Let's um as we were just you know um re rehearsing some of the things that we mentioned again people go back to Jeremiah 29:11 where it says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you. Uh sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. as I was uh just looking at AI, I mean actually Google searching just saying what are some of the things people what's a devotion around this because there's so many devotions written on this and and uh when you're looking at Jeremiah 29:11 some of the things it said in that is you got to be able to trust God's timing. Um I don't mind waiting. So you got to be able to trust God's timing. Uh God's timing is different from our timing. And and I'll be honest, I'll be the first one to admit my time and I want things to be done. &gt;&gt; I guess some of y'all in the same boat that that I'm in. You we be wanting things to happen right now, &gt;&gt; brother. Wait for how long, bro? I I I couldn't even wait at McDonald's. I mean, it's it's fast food. It need to be ready. I And I done been I had to repent sometime. I mean, you know, y'all ain't got I went one time, they didn't have no ice cream. How can you not have ice cream at McDonald's? You know, people come in here for ice cream. I was I was hot. &gt;&gt; And then you get there, you have to wait on something. Wait. I mean, we don't we don't you know what happens IS THAT WITH THIS FAST FOOD INDUSTRY and everything that happens so instantly, we we don't want to wait on nothing. &gt;&gt; And and it actually affects us as Christians. &gt;&gt; It really impacts us as Christians because if we can't wait on just little things, then how we going to be able to wait on God? That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but but we got to BE ABLE TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING and we have to endure through suffering. &gt;&gt; The other thing says we got to be able to surrender control. And and and and I love that because after we administered on that, brother brother uh Nathan comes right in and says that uh the power of committ. &gt;&gt; Lord knows that message was from me. &gt;&gt; Being able to just commit something to God and just let leave it alone. Don't even worry about it no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't don't look out once you put that seed in the ground. Don't go look to see the thing growing. It is growing, but you got to let it do it what what the way it does it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just keep watering it with praises. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be able to trust God's time and and do it through suffering and surrender control. All right. But when we look at this and as I and I started reading there a little early, I started reading at verse 10 because um this was this this scripture that that Jeremiah uh 29:11 is following. Verse 10 goes before it and it's talking about them going into uh uh Babylon for 70 years. That was a prophecy that Jeremiah gave them. But Jeremiah also bought property in Israel because he knew at after 70 years God was going to bring them back. &gt;&gt; God Jeremiah had complete confidence that God was going to bring Israel back. It was a time of restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After the 70 years was up, it was a time of restoration. And the other thing that that Jeremiah said in verse uh verse 15 says because ye have said the Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon. I think this is important. This is important that God has raised up us raised US UP PROPHETS IN BABYLON. THE THE THING OF THE thing about uh God using a prophet is because brother Random teaches the word of the Lord comes to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Right. AND AND WHEN GOD IS TRYING TO REESTABLISH SOMETHING, he has to, you know, he has to give it to a prophet. I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT uh just even the the the church world and today, my God, hallelujah, you ain't got to look too far. &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT THE CHURCH world and WHERE WE ARE TODAY. GOD HAS TO USE A PROPHET TO ESTABLISH WHERE THE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO BE IN GOD. &gt;&gt; THE THINGS THAT THEY REALLY SHOULD BE CHASING AFTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WAY THAT THE THE THE THE POSITION THAT THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, GOD USES A PROPHET TO REESTABLISH THOSE THINGS. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE JUST GOING ALONG WITH THE FLOW. &gt;&gt; My God. LIKE, LIKE BROTHER SMILEY SAY, JUST EVERYBODY GET IN CHURCH AND THE big thing NOW IS JUST JUMP WHILE YOU'RE IN THE PULL PIT. WHY? WHY WE GOT TO DO ALL OF THAT? &gt;&gt; NOW, I DON'T MIND A little dance here and there, BUT BUT EVERY SERVICE IS A JUMP. SOMETHING AND AND WHERE'S IT GOING TO MOVE TO FROM THERE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We got TO GO TO CHURCH AND WE NEED LIGHTS TO TRY TO GET THE PEOPLE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE IN A CLUB. &gt;&gt; MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; NO, THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAS TO USE A PROPHET TO ESTABLISH THEM PRINCIPLES ALL OVER AGAIN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, now when we look at, you know, some of this today, we're going to see that, you know, uh I don't think even in in in in in my time of study and uh I don't think I ever really kind of put these these these these uh things together because um uh one of the prophets that was that was raised up during this time while they were in exile, one of the prophets was the prophet Malachi. very important prophet &gt;&gt; and and you know there were there was other prophets we got Ezra and Nehemiah and Hagi and Zechariah ALL THEM BUT MALACHI IS ALSO A PROPHET THAT IS USED during this time. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and and you know we going to we're going to you know get get there uh at some point in time. There's a few things I want to talk about but uh but Malachi Amen. We being being message believers, we understand Malachi EVEN PROPHESIED ABOUT WHERE WE'RE LIVING AT TODAY. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND AND GOD RAISED UP THIS MAN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF HELP THE PEOPLE COME BACK TO CERTAIN TRUTHS THAT THEY HAD FORGOT ABOUT. OH MY GOD. MY GOD. GOD ALWAYS USES A PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO TRUTH. OH YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THAT'S THE VERY PURPOSE OF A PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO TRUTH. REESTABLISH WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, you want TO KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAY? BECAUSE GOD VINDICATES what a prophet say. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now you know I I I I read this out of my Thomas Thomas Nelson Bible. um the uh uh the the setting of the book of Ezra. And because there this Jeremiah kind of connects to Ezra and um you know, we're going to kind of look at that a little bit. I want to go to maybe Ezra chapter five in a little bit. Uh and we'll yeah, we'll we'll we'll read that. But this study, Amen. here in um in Ezra, and I'll just start reading from verse one because I want to pick up some things here. But this historical setting in the book of Ezra, the setting of Ezra is the post exilelic era is what they're saying. And it says um when the faithful Israelites were were returning from Babylon to Judah so they could reestablish the temple worship, the temple and the temple worship are vital subjects in all the books written during the post exilelic period which is after exile after they were in Babylon for 70 years. That's post exile. A after the exile he says um 1 and 2 Coronicles was written there. Ezra, the book of Ezra, the book of book of Nehemiah, book of Hagi, book of Zechariah and Malachi. All these were uh books written, Amen. in the post exile exileic period. It says the people who returned to the land of promise were publicly acknowledging that they believe God would reestablish the nation and usher in a a time of kingdom blessing. They believe that God would reestablish the nation and ush in a time of kingdom blessing. Now, now we we're looking at this, but you you realize Amen. I believe it was 1948, if that's right, uh where um you know, Israel was reestablished as a nation, &gt;&gt; right? And it was also AT THE SAME TIME THAT God was raising up a prophet here in US AND SENDING HIM OUT. HE WAS BEING VISITED BY AN ANGEL WHILE ISRAEL IS BEING REESTABLISHED AS A NATION. LOOK AT HOW ALL THIS CONNECTS. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AND WHY WAS GOD RAISING UP THIS PROPHET HERE IN THE US? AMEN. IS ORDER TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE RESTORATION IS ALL ABOUT. WHEN WE SAY GET BACK IN STEP, WE TALKING ABOUT GET BACK IN STEP WITH THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. AND GOD HAS TO USE A PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK IN STEP &gt;&gt; with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. There was three returns from Babylon just like there were three deportations to Babylon. Amen. God God is perfected in threes. And uh so the first return was led by Zerubbabel also. uh that was the rebuilding of the temple which was vital for that group. The second return was under Ezra, Ezra's leadership. And uh in 458 BC, the people needed reforming. They needed to return to their covenant obligations. Now, now listen, listen at that statement. The people needed reforming. So, and they needed to return to their covenant obligations. And we're going to get into something in a little bit. covenant obligations. The people needed reforming and they needed to return to their covenant obligations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now, now I'm I'm going just go ahead and say this a little ahead of time. Malachi helped the people to reform and also help the people to come back to a covenant obligation. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS MALACHI TALKED ABOUT that I want to get into. One of them, amen, is a very obvious one. Tithing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BUT ALSO MALACHI dealt with marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MALACHI, AMEN, TOLD THEM HOW GOD HATED DIVORCE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO, THEY NEEDED TO RETURN TO COVENANT OBLIGATIONS. WE WE AS A PEOPLE ALSO NEED TO RETURN TO COVENANT OBLIGATIONS. WE NEED TO HONOR GOD AND HONOR HIS WORD IN ALL OF OUR DECISIONS. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people needed reform and under Ezra, Ezra's return when he's leading the people back in that second uh return to to to to Judah says the people needed reform and they needed to return to their covenant obligations. The third return was led by Nehemiah. Now, let's go and pick up Ezra uh chapter five. Hallelujah. and we'll just read uh here. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I tell you the truth, this is uh um a real blessing to me. I I I thank God for it. I thank God for it. Ezra chapter 5 and uh starting at verse one. Let me just catch something here. So Ezra is leading the people back to uh you know Judah and as they're you know we're going to see some some various things. You know we talked about how God allows tension and we're going to see some tension rise up uh kind of here in um in this. But the other thing I want you to kind of catch is, you know, just just these different prophets that God is using that he's speaking through uh during this time of post exile. So the very def says it says then the prophets Haggi the prophet and Zachchariah the son of uh the son of Ido prophesied unto uh the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel and unto them even unto them. Then rose up Zerubbabel, the son of uh Shaltiel, and Juhua, the son of um Joedc, and began to build the house of God, which is at Jerusalem. And with them were the prophets of God, helping them. I I I like this because of, you know, the these these leaders, these prophets, they were involved in the building, you know, of the temple, right? And the reestablishing, not just reestablish it, but just with their words and what was coming their mouth. But they they picking up bricks, too. Uh they putting some mortar on the building, too. They they were they were they were all in, if I can just put it that way. They were all in. Hallelujah. It says um it says at the same time came to them Tatana governor on this side of the river and Sheth uh Shethar Bernay and their companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall. Now here's the tension that is starting to come in &gt;&gt; now. Who who who y'all to start doing this? Who who who who gave y'all this authority, right? Hallelujah. It says, "Then we said unto them after this manner, uh uh what are the names of the men that make this building?" Now, this just this just the enemy that's coming in against them. Who they want to get who who responsible for this? Now, you got sometimes you got to know how to how to answer the devil. &gt;&gt; Look at this. He says, "But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews that they could not cause them to cease to the matter came to Darius." And then they returned answer by letter concerning this concerning this matter. the copy of the letters that Tatnai governor on this side of the river and um Shethar Bonsni and his companions and uh a farite my God that's a good one aarites all right praise God which um which were on this side the river sent unto Darius a king they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto Darius the king. All peace be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is buildth with great stones and timbers laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prosperth in their hands once they got started. God just began to bless it &gt;&gt; and even the enemy recognized that they were being blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this now. Glory to God. And now what they're doing is they're trying to actually stop the work. This this tension that they're that they're bringing against the the Jews, they're trying to stop the work. But let me let me help you to understand something. When God has prophesied that there would be a restoration, there's no enemy that can stop it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know if we get that. I &gt;&gt; if if IF THERE IF GOD HAS PROMISED TO RESTORE YOUR FAMILY, THERE IS NO ENEMY THAT CAN STOP THAT, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. THEY CAN TRY TO DELAY THIS AND THEY CAN TRY TO DELAY THAT. IT DOES NOT MATTER. HALLELUJAH. GOD GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS. HIS WORD MUST BE FULFILLED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Ver verse 8 says, "Being known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is builded with great stones and timbers laid in the walls and and this work goeth fast on and prosperth in their hands." Then ask me those elders and said unto unto them, "Thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up THESE WALLS?" WHO COMMANDED YOU to do that? He says, he said, 'We asked their names also to certify them that we might write their na write the names of the men that were the chief of them. AND THUS they returned uh a us an answer, saying, WE ARE THE SERVANTS OF the God of heaven and earth, AND BUILD THE HOUSE THAT WAS BUILD it these many years ago, which a great king of Israel build it, and set up. Notice they did not give them their names. Hallelujah. Because their name REALLY DIDN'T MATTER. THEY WERE ACTUALLY JUST A PART OF A A A PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; They were there to fulfill a prophecy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell YOU, YOU ALSO HERE TO FULFILL A PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON THIS EARTH THAT WOULD BE A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY HE COULD SAY IN MALACHI, &gt;&gt; "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU." HEY, &gt;&gt; ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE DAY OF THE LORD. HE DIDN'T PUT MY NAME THERE, BUT I KNOW I'M IDENTIFIED RIGHT THERE IN THAT SCRIPTURE. MALACHI SPOKE OF ME. &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; Verse verse uh uh uh uh verse 12. But after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldim, who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon. So now before we go further because I I'll read a little bit more but before we go further in that I want to just kind of bring in now now just in that that verse right there Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon that lets us know a couple other people were involved in this in scripture during this time period. Daniel will be one of the ones that was involved in this time period. Oh Lord help us right here. Uh another is the three Hebrew boys. And when we talk about tension, &gt;&gt; both Daniel and the Hebrew boys had tension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God wasn't in no hurry. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW JUST WHEN to move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND IF GOD WOULD BRING DANIEL OUT AND GOD WOULD BRING THEM HEBREW BOYS OUT, GOD IS AL ALSO GOING TO BRING YOU OUT. &gt;&gt; BE ENCOURAGED, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL BRING YOU OUT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me just kind of uh pick up uh something here. Amen. A couple quotes that I'd like to read. My God. Hallelujah. Uh Christ is Christ is revealed in his own word. And and one of the things that we'll catch here is because in in uh in the days of Nebuchadnezzar there there was a lot that happened but one one particular incident was uh Nebuchadnezzar they they they decided to have a a a little get together little party and not only did they they they they went a little further than where they should have gone. Hallelujah. As they got to drinking, they decided to bring the sacred cups of God out &gt;&gt; and began to drink from the sacred cups of God. Let me also tell you that you shouldn't even be drinking. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew made a comment on on on on Wednesday night and and I meant to I meant to come back up and say something about it, but it slipped my mind. But I'mma say it now. &gt;&gt; Brother brother, HE HE QUOTED A QUOTE WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "A EVIL SPIRIT OF DRINKING HE SAID AN EVIL SPIRIT OF DRINKING. SO ANYBODY GET CONNECTED TO SPIRITS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, IT'S A EVIL SPIRIT THAT FOLLOWS THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO THE LAMB OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT ONLY WERE PROPHETS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DRINKING IN THE BOTTLE, WE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS EITHER. NOT AS BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T SMOKE. WE DON'T DRINK. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN EVIL SPIRIT THAT FOLLOWS THAT. &gt;&gt; I I was shocked. Somebody told me recently say, uh, my wife went to get herself a little something. Went to a wedding. She went to get herself a, you know, she saw what was out there and she said, "Now that that's that that that's a clear drink, but it I don't know what it is, but it ain't it ain't Sprite." &gt;&gt; She say, "I better not get that." Then she said herself, "I'm not going to even get Sprite because I don't want nobody to mistake my Sprite for that drink right there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I and I I I appreciate that. But but I Somebody was coming up talking to I said, "Yeah, she over there getting herself a a Selza water and and uh and uh some um cranberry juice." So I say, "Oh, she getting something clean." I say, &gt;&gt; "You getting she getting something clean?" And then say, "I don't want nothing clean tonight." &gt;&gt; And you going to go to church tomorrow &gt;&gt; and say, "You believe this?" No. No. This message produces a difference. WE DON'T DO THIS TYPE OF STUFF as believers. &gt;&gt; AND AS MY WIFE WAS SITTING THERE TALKING TO THE BARTENDER, GETTING HER A LITTLE DRINK, THE MAN SAY, "Do you?" He said, "I can make you whatever you want. I can do you this. I can say, "No, I don't do that. I don't do that. Just give me Selza water and uh cranberry juice." So, you don't drink a little bit? No. Just on special occasions? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Say you at weddings? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; She say, "I don't drink. I don't drink at all." He said, "Now, I know this may sound strange. &gt;&gt; He say, "I'm a bartender, BUT I DON'T DRINK EITHER." &gt;&gt; WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHAT A REBUKE TO THE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; THE VERY MAN IN HERE SERVING THE DRINKS, DON'T EVEN DRINK, AND NOT EVEN A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; WHAT A REBUKE TO THE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; I might as well say these things &gt;&gt; that I I Lord have mercy. If you plan on doing all that drinking at your wedding, don't invite me. Don't don't invite me. &gt;&gt; Please don't invite me. &gt;&gt; When when my daughter got married, we actually paid extra &gt;&gt; so that they would not serve drinks. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; We paid extra so they would not serve drinks. Didn't even want to tempt the saints. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me get back to my subject. But we got to, you know, you just got to know where you stand at in this message cuz people people got all kind of things and they justify No, no, no, no. I I don't care how you just I ain't drinking. &gt;&gt; I I No, no, no. &gt;&gt; I ain't drinking beer. I ain't drinking wine. &gt;&gt; I ain't drinking hard liquor. I ain't drinking &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah to the Lamb. &gt;&gt; Where am I? All right. Um, I was I was talking about uh Okay. Okay. Um, in Babylon, they they went out and got them cups of the Lord, the uh uh dedicated cups to God, uh, sacred cups, and they began to drink, you know, from these cups. And before you know it, judgment had come into Nebuchadnezzar's house and and God had wrote with his own finger right on the wall. Hallelujah. And um and was pretty much letting them know that your time is your time is up. You've been found uh waiting uh you're you're wanting in the balance. You're in the balance and you're found wanting. So you're pretty much your time is up. And really at the very time that these uh that this f handwriting on the wall, there's an army sneaking in getting ready to take over Babylon. Brother Brandham says something here in Christ is revealed in his own word. He says, "Now we know God chose by predestination his church, his place, his prophets and all about it. But by fornowledge he predestinated his prophet and when the age arrived he had his prophet arrive at the same time and inspired him as he wrote the Bible by him. Now God wrote the Bible only using the prophet because that's that's his way of doing it. So see it's not the it's not it's it's it's not the see it's the word of God and not the word of man. God is a person. Look at this. God can speak. God can talk. &gt;&gt; God can write. &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you that's that I I like that. God can write. He didn't have to do it that way. But that's the way he chose to do it. He didn't have to do it that way, but he chose to do it that way. Now, you say God wrote with his finger, his own majestic finger, the Ten Commandments. So God could write itself if he wanted to, but he chose to write it through prophets. If God wanted to write it, he could. But the way he chose to get his word to us is through prophets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Write it through prophets. SEE, BECAUSE IT WAS HIS ATTRIBUTES, his word. He expressed through them, making all a part of him. Amen. He says, see, he could write with his finger. He also took his finger and wrote on the walls of Babylon, "THOU ART WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AND FOUND WANTING." He wrote with his own finger. Now, uh I want to pick up another quote out of questions and answers part one. Brother Brandon was referring to to this and uh what happened here in um um uh in Babylon uh with Nebuchadnezzar. And again, just kind of referring back here to Ezra 5 and 12, where it says, "But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the children who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon." Now, some other things happened in Babylon in confusion and uh we have uh dealt with this. Amen. Even brother Andrew hit it again on Wednesday night. He made a statement that was very profound to me. We have a group of young people growing up in the message that will have never experienced what it is like to go to church. what it's like to go to church and actually hear a minister preach &gt;&gt; because they doing tapes in their houses and they don't realize the tapes that they're playing came from somebody in the church preaching from a pullpit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I I mean I just I was listening to a tape this week and brother Brandham said God never used &gt;&gt; a mechanical device to preach the gospel. God never did that. He's always used men. &gt;&gt; Now, how can you hear that on tape and not get up and go to church? &gt;&gt; It's because you're selectively hearing what you want to hear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But brother Brandham didn't teach these things. &gt;&gt; Uh folk come up with this kind of stuff. But brother Brandham didn't teach that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now hearing questions answer. Now, I need you to I need you to kind of catch something. Uh it's very important because as it was amen there in Babylon with the confusion that they were in uh we'll see that confusion come back again in the earth and it's here right now. This is why we got all these different uh uh things going on in the message because it's it's just a spirit of confusion. The way that you settle yourself is look at things according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. Look, let's look at look look at something here in this message questions and answers. He says, and notice I could state something here that would shock. Now, he said, I can say something that could shock us. Watch it now. He says, listen now. Watch now, Babylon. What taken place at Babylon when the force was brought on to the true worshippers. Remember just a little handful, Shadrach, Meach, and Abednego, and Daniel of the true worshippers went down into captivity. When God called them to really show their colors what they what they were, they were forced into worship of an idol. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were forced into the worship of an idol. Is that right? Idolatry. They was forced into worship of an idol. They had to bow before an idol. And if they didn't do it, they were persecuted. Now, when brother Brandham says that I could say something here that was shock, but he doesn't say it. Hallelujah. I can tell you, Amen. Because I know other quotes where he've where he did say it. This idol that they were trying to force them to worship WAS AN IDOL OF DANIEL. &gt;&gt; The the Hebrew BOYS, THEIR THEIR GOOD FRIEND, DANIEL. AMEN. WHO WHO HELPED GET THEM OUT OF SOME SITUATIONS AND GET THEM PROMOTED INTO AMEN INTO THAT GENTILE KINGDOM. THEY WERE FORCED TO TRY TO WORSHIP DANIEL, &gt;&gt; AN IMAGE OF DANIEL. HALLELUJAH. AND THEM BOYS HAD TO STAND AGAINST THE WORSHIP OF THEIR OWN FRIEND. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. WE MIGHT AS WELL GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE BROTHER BRANDHAM AN IDOL &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO WORSHIP BROTHER BRANDON. WE HERE TO WORSHIP GOD. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T SAVE YOU. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T DELIVER YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T HEAL YOU. IT'S JESUS THAT DOES ALL THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And here here's the problem. People have lifted up brother Brandham. Amen. Too high. I told y'all a long time ago, God told me when I went to the grave of the prophet, I was standing there at at his grave and just just like, "Wow, man. This is this is what a blessing to be here. And the Holy Spirit came down and told me say, "Don't you lift him too high." &gt;&gt; I said, "What?" And then he came back and said, "And don't you put him too low either." &gt;&gt; So I I've always tried to walk right in the middle of the road &gt;&gt; with where we put Brother Brandon. That's why I said we don't sing songs here &gt;&gt; that glorify the prophet &gt;&gt; cuz the prophet told us that this whole thing is supposed to be about the principal theme of the entire Bible &gt;&gt; is Christ. &gt;&gt; So we sing that glorify Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I done I done heard him get in there singing song like what is this? What song is this? &gt;&gt; Where y'all get this from? Jesus ain't nowhere in the song. all about brother Brandon and y'all want us to segment it that who we worshiping in here &gt;&gt; and some don't see nothing wrong with it but you let them go on and do whatever they going to do &gt;&gt; but it was only few in in the Hebrew boys days only few that could withstand &gt;&gt; I wonder how many others when they start piping the music &gt;&gt; and telling them now if you don't bow and sing this song we're gonna have to throw you into the lion's den I wonder what music they were Man, &gt;&gt; I wonder what the song was. &gt;&gt; Cuz their their God that they were worshiping was Daniel. &gt;&gt; Did they write songs about Daniel? &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; let's just go a little further. &gt;&gt; Idolatry. We not We not We not We not doing that, church. &gt;&gt; Idolatry. Idolatry. Idolatry. All over the place. Idolatry. Uh it says, "Oh, what a picture you can pull out of Daniel." Revelations tie those together and show by the scripture that the church is coming into the same type of persecution before she's called out. That's the way the gentile church was brought in. And that's the way the gentile church will be taken out. As she come in, so shall she go. So, at a time of a rapture, we're going to see things like this rise up. And and and you got to be so rooted and grounded in the word that these things can't move you. &gt;&gt; It don't matter who doing it. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your name is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz you know, brother Brandon, brother Brandon even made a statement. He says, he says, "I don't know what happened to Brandon Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; They don't even have church there anymore. &gt;&gt; It's closed. I think that and and and and because they it's too many people to go to church &gt;&gt; and uh and and and and it won't fit all the people that's there in that area that want to go go to that church. So they they built a gymnasium for the people to go to. &gt;&gt; But because people died from COVID, they stopped going to church and now everything is at home playing the tape. But the scripture says, "Forsake not &gt;&gt; to assemble yourselves together as you see that day approaching." That's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all better know y'all Bible. &gt;&gt; Look, I'm going to go to church. &gt;&gt; I do listen to tapes, but I'm going to church &gt;&gt; and I'm listening to a preacher &gt;&gt; because he gave &gt;&gt; WHO IS HE? GOD GAVE SOME APOSTLES, SOME PASTORS, SOME TEACHERS, SOME EVANGELISTS, SOME PROPHETS. GOD GAVE ALL OF THAT &gt;&gt; FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS, FOR THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY, FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; GOD DID THAT. &gt;&gt; And we still in God's program. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going a little further. Hallelujah. He says this says and look how he saw that saw the image and now remember the image now this is home place. Now look I believe that image that that king Nebuchad Nebuchadnezzar made was was of Daniel a holy man. If you'll notice, King Nebuchadnezzar already had called Daniel uh called him Beltichazar says which was his idol and he made an image and no one after Daniel had been thrown in the uh thrown in the lion's den and so forth and he said no one should ever serve any other gods my God and so forth but Daniel's God it was probably the image of a holy man great statue and everybody was bowing down bow down to this but the church Shadrach and Meak and Abednego Daniel being the leader as Christ being the leader of the church and they was to bow before this image and do worship to the image notice and you notice in those times Daniel was silent Daniel didn't say nothing but because they had to prove their own revelation &gt;&gt; hallelujah they and according to the the law God said I will have no other gods before me. So them brothers had to stand on their own revelation EVEN THOUGH DANIEL'S SILENT, NOT SAYING NOTHING ABOUT IT. THEY HAD TO STAND on their own revelation and God vindicated their revelation. &gt;&gt; Look at it now. It says uh uh and it says and it says and you notice in those times Daniel was silent and amen and oh I hope you get this. Daniel was silent letting they had to make their own choice. &gt;&gt; Says in the day in the going out of the gentile dispensation he's talking about right now &gt;&gt; in the going out of the gentile dispensation there'll be an image and everybody will have to bow before the image and do worship. Now now I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I got to say these things. I got young people that at some point in time y'all going to enter into courtship. somebody gonna express an interest in you and you're gonna be thinking about, you know, courtship, but there's questions you need to be asking &gt;&gt; just just before just because somebody, well, I'm interested in you. Well, okay. Who's your pastor? &gt;&gt; And let them know my pastor would like to talk with your pastor. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, &gt;&gt; I GOT QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CHARACTER THIS YOUNG MAN IS. Did he just come to church yesterday &gt;&gt; or has he really been in church and gone through some tests and trials? I'm going to EVEN ASK THAT PASTOR, IS HE A FAITHFUL TITHE PAYER? &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SAY, WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT? THAT'S SO PERSONAL, BROTHER JACK. WHY WE ASK THAT? BECAUSE I I KNOW IF YOUR HOUSE GOING TO BE BLESSED OR CURSED. &gt;&gt; I CAN TELL WHETHER Y'ALL GOING TO HAVE FINANCIAL STRUGGLES OR NOT. AND EVERYBODY GOING TO HAVE FINANCIAL STRUGGLES, BUT YOU AIN'T GOT NO PROMISE TO BRING YOU OUT. &gt;&gt; I NEED TO KNOW &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT ARE you hooking her up into. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. LET ME ASK HIM. IF I RUN HIM OFF, HE MIGHT HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RUN OFF. &gt;&gt; BUT IF HE CHECK ALL THE BOXES, THEN PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on, sisters.

He all yours. &gt;&gt; And when when when when the trouble go down, &gt;&gt; you didn't call me before. Now all of a sudden, pastor, &gt;&gt; let me let me just put it like this. I'm have to be plain with you. You can't bring a lemon and expect me to make lemonade. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Now, look, we got to do some checks and balances before things get down too far down the path. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and let me tell y'all something. I got your best interest in mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, I I would just have to let the brother know she doing better single. &gt;&gt; I mean, you supposed to be you SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSET.

Give them give them your pastor number. Talk to my pastor. He going to have some questions for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you get too deep in that. &gt;&gt; Too committed. &gt;&gt; Don't get your feelings all connected. And now now I'm trying to unt untangle all this spaghetti. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. All right. &gt;&gt; Look. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And parents, y'all, y'all know that stuff be going on too. Now, if y'all see them sneaking, talking on the phone, now no, no, no, no. If they ain't talk to you, &gt;&gt; come on now. You ought to be involved in that. You ought to know what's going on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometime the parents already going to work this thing out and we're going to take it to the pastor. We're going to do it just like this and we're going to get we're going to say just like I don't know y'all done put that plan together. Hello, somebody. I'm It's This is for your good. &gt;&gt; You talk about years of life. &gt;&gt; Years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because I I'm I'm going to read to you out of Malachi where God hates divorce. &gt;&gt; So when you when you when you approaching marriage, you cannot have divorce as an option. If it don't work out, we just get divorced. You cannot do that as a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't do that. You can't approach marriage like that. &gt;&gt; This is until death do you part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And and you look at others that might have been divorced. I come from a household my my mom was divorced and met my dad and I'm I'm glad that things worked out the way they did. But but she didn't have all this truth. &gt;&gt; Mama didn't have all of this. &gt;&gt; You look at other people, they didn't have all the truth that you have. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and but but but what happens is that y'all y'all over go over the truth &gt;&gt; and you want to do it your way. &gt;&gt; You're going to suffer the consequences. &gt;&gt; Don't don't do that. Look, it's better to be single than to be married and miserable. And if you marry an unbeliever, you marry an unbeliever, you will be miserable. &gt;&gt; Let me finish reading. I I I got something I really want to say. In the day in the going out of the Gentiles of sization, there there will be an image and everybody will have to bow down before this image and do worship. Though it be holy as ever, you're not to worship an image. Image worship. Now notice, oh my, right at the end, Daniel steps in again. How marvelous that right before the great feast of the concubines and so forth there come a handwriting on the wall meani mean teoarf across the wall and the interpretation nobody could give it was wrote in unknown tongues nobody could interpret they went got their best scholars that said we don't know and they went and got all the soussayers and astrologers we don't know we don't know nothing about it we never seen such a language never heard such in our life but there was a man. God had his man. Daniel was there. Said, "Go get him." Said, "For the spirit of the gods lives in him." It says, "So Daniel come up there, began to read and interpret that language on the wall. And he gave what was the interpretation? Not not, oh bless be thou, O king forever, but a raw, burly, flat rejection and said, you are weighed in the balance and found wanting." A prophet don't always bring good prophecies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime he got to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. To get you to straighten up from your sin. Let me keep reading here in Ezra chapter 5. We stopped at verse 12. I'll go to verse 13. says, "But in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Babylon, the same uh King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God, and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those that Cyrus the the king, take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was uh Chespazar, whom he had made governor." Now, now again, they're looking uh to try to uh certify, hey, who told these people to start building rebuilding this and who gave them this authority? And we want to know who your names are. They wouldn't never give the names, but they said, search back in the records and see. And when they went back to look, they saw Cyrus had given them uh the authority to go back and rebuild Jerusalem. But not only Cyrus, you know, you can see Cyrus even in the scripture, he's restoring even the sacred vessels. Restoration's all over here, right? He's restoring the sacred vessels. And the other thing that we I read to you last time, and I won't read it again, but in the next chapter, you'll see that Cyrus also provided money out of his own pocket for the restoration to occur. Oh boy, I just love that. And that's why I said, "God, thank you for my Cyrus &gt;&gt; and thank you for making me a Cyrus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz brother, we we sometime you need a Cyrus &gt;&gt; and God will give you a Cyrus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking. Look look look. Can I just be honest with y'all? This one chump change. Right. &gt;&gt; Cyrus wasn't giving $20. &gt;&gt; No, this was this was multi-million probably project here. This was this was major money. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CYRUS THAT GOT IT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CYRUS THAT GOT IT SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR CYRUS, LORD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR GIVING US FAVOR WITH CYRUS. HAVE MERCY. Listen to a testimony. Brother brother brother testified how he went to his pastor needed just a loan. I think he said he needed 200,000 in a loan and pastor gave it to him and he lost the lost it in a business transaction. lost 200,000. Now, let me just help you understand something. &gt;&gt; If one of the saints came to me to ask me for 200,000, I would love to be in a position &gt;&gt; to be able to give them 200,000. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you another thing. As a pastor, I have to think it might be multiple saints asking for 200,000. And I got to have enough &gt;&gt; that I could be able to give everybody &gt;&gt; that. And if I lost it, I can still keep functioning. &gt;&gt; So in order to be able to give 200,000 &gt;&gt; and not feel it, &gt;&gt; oh my, &gt;&gt; make me a Cyrus. &gt;&gt; This what I'm talking about. Jesus. Let me keep on reading. &gt;&gt; We got to We I'm talking about our numbers got to get bigger. &gt;&gt; We got to thank bigger. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Lord. What verse was our own? Um okay. Verse 15. and said to him, "Take these vessels, go carry them into the temple uh that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in his place." Then came the same Shespazar, and laid the foundation of the house of God, which is in Jerusalem, since that since that time, even until now hath it been in building. Uh, and yet it is not finished. Now therefore, if it seemed good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is which is there at Babylon, whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. All right. So here they're going through all of this um all kind of tension even in trying to rebuild. Uh but God was making a way. Things were recorded and they knew the reason they had to search it search to see what a king said because whatever king said was final. &gt;&gt; When a king spoke it, it could not be altered. &gt;&gt; It could not be changed. And when God has given you a promise There is nothing or nobody that can alter it or change it. &gt;&gt; I'm standing on it. &gt;&gt; Sometime I have to speak to my business. &gt;&gt; I tell my business that what he told me that what &gt;&gt; whatever these hands touch &gt;&gt; whatever these hands touch you going he it's going to prosper. and it's going to bring forth seed uh fruit in its season. &gt;&gt; Whatever I do supposed to prosper. &gt;&gt; I ain't accepting nothing less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me let me slip over here. I got to get to Malachi. Malachi was a prophet that raised up during this time. And let's let's look look at a couple things Malachi said first. Malachi 2 verse 15-1 17. He brought inspiration during this restoration. Now, uh, I want y'all to remember now that people are coming out of 70 years of bondage. And in 70 years of bondage, I think sometimes you might lose your way. You might lose some of the truths that that you used to stand on you. In Babylon, you got to live the way these people living. And I mean, what temple could they go to in Babylon? There was a there was actually even a scripture. I forgot to bring it to you, but it's in the book of Psalms. They would they would ask them to sing songs and and and and they they they said, "How can we sing &gt;&gt; when we're in a strange land, &gt;&gt; right? How can how can we HOW CAN WE EVEN GIVE some of the Lord's song in the stream? It's it's hard to do what we used to do when we're in Babylon, &gt;&gt; God has restored a condition so they can get back into a place where they can worship God freely." I I believe God is restoring a condition so we can get back in a place where we can WORSHIP GOD FREELY. I GOT TO READ. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me let me let me quickly. Uh Malachi 2 verse 15-17 says, "And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit, and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. For the Lord the God of Israel said that he hateth putting away. What is that hateth putting away? He hateth divorce. Now, so there was probably issues that they were having. Amen. During this time, but it's like I mean here a prophet has to kind of reestablish marriage. Brother Brandham did the exact same thing when he preached the marriage um preach the sermon marriage AND DIVORCE. HE'S REESTABLISHING THE TRUTH OF MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; MALACHI IS REESTABLISHING THIS TRUTH BEHIND MARRIAGE. SAY GOD HATE PUTTING AWAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He says uh for the Lord the God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one coverth violence with his garment sayith the Lord of hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit that you do not treacherously. Ye have wearied the Lord with your words yet you say wherein have we rided him? When you say everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord and he delightth in them or where is the God of judgment? We see here that the the the marriage and divorce is being restored. We also pick up Malachi chapter 3 verse 7-2. Tithing had to be restored. Tithing had to be restored. Um when you when you you know I I don't think I found like when we read this I don't I don't think I found like an exact match of of a scripture where where this was kind of repeated before. But when they come out of captivity, Malachi raises up because again, where were they going to take their tithing to? In in Babylon, where do they go with it? What do they do? They don't they can't go to the temple. There is no temple in Babylon. &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so when you get to a spot where the people don't have it, they they begin to get away from these principles. Oh my. And God has to come back and restore the principle. So, let me let let's just kind of look at this. Amen. And and and I and here's the other thing I'm I'mma show you. Amen. Malachi actually God used these prophets to restore. But not only did Malachi restore this, but also Nehemiah restored it. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Because both OF THESE WERE PROPHETS THAT WAS USED DURING THE POST EXILEIC PERIOD. NOW WATCH Malachi 3:7. It says, "Even from the days of your fathers, &gt;&gt; you're gone away from mine ordinances." See, you have to come back to these ordinances. It says, "And and and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, sayith the Lord of hosts. BUT YE SAID, WHEREIN SHALL we return?" Hallelujah. Will a man rob God? Yet ye now, now that's a that's I mean, look, People go around and they might hold up this person and try to hold up that person, but you'll never think about trying to rob God. Nobody got that. That's not that won't cross nobody's mind to try TO ROB GOD. RIGHT? HE SAID, "BUT WILL A MAN ROB GOD?" YET YE HAVE ROBBED ME. BUT YOU SAY, "WHEREIN HAVE WE ROBBED THEE?" He says, "In tithes &gt;&gt; and offering." Them 70 years that you obey, you robbing God in tithes and offering. Now, now notice it's tithes &gt;&gt; and offering. &gt;&gt; Not just tithes, but tithes &gt;&gt; and offering. Lord, let me let me now, now before I go further. Amen. In this this verse, there was a reference to verse verse 8 and uh Nehemiah 13:11. So, let's uh let's let's pick that up. I'm going to start at verse 10, though. Nehemiah 13:10. Nehemiah is also dealing with this. Hallelujah. Malachi is dealing with it. And all this comes during a time of restoration, post exileic period. Now watch this. Nehemiah 13, I'm starting in verse 10. It says, "And I perceived this Nehemiah. I perceived that a portion uh that that the portions of the Levites had not been given them. For the Levites and the singers that did the work were fled everyone to his field." IT SAYS, "THEN CONTENDED I with the rulers and said, why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place. Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasures uh treasuries." It says, "And I made treasures over the treasuries the priest and Zadok the scribe and of the Levites uh uh Padayiah. And next to them was Hannim uh the son of Zakur the son of Mataniah. But they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. It says, "Remember me, oh my God, concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for the offices thereof." So here Nehemiah saying, "Now I notice that the the the the Levites ain't been taken care of. They are they out working in the field. They not actually doing the service in the house of God because they out working in the field. Something wrong somewhere. SO HE HAD TO GET IN START BRINGING THE TITHE back into the treasuries in the house. Now this is Nehemiah restoring that. &gt;&gt; AND MALACHI IS ALSO RESTORING THE SAME THING. LOOK AT WHAT MALACHI SAYS. WE'LL GO BACK TO Malachi 3 verse verse 8 again. WILL A MAN ROB GOD? YET YE HAVE ROBBED ME BUT YE SAY WHEREIN HAVE WE ROBBED THEE? and tithes and offering. Verse nine says, "You're cursed with a curse. For ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. &gt;&gt; BRING YE ALL THE TITHES INTO THE STOREHOUSE, THAT THERE MAY be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, sayith the Lord OF HOSTS, IF I WILL NOT OPEN YOU the windows of heaven, AND POUR YOU OUT A BLESSING THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE room enough to receive it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something about when we get back to the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't be room enough to receive. IT SAYS, "AND I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOUR &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SAKES. AND HE SHALL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF YOUR GROUND, NEITHER SHALL YOUR VINE CAST HER FRUIT BEFORE THE TIME IN THE FIELD, SAYETH THE LORD OF HOSTS, &gt;&gt; and all nations shall call you blessed. &gt;&gt; For ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts." Tithing and offering had to be restored. Tithing was to give 10% of your earnings back to the Lord. Tithing belong to God. &gt;&gt; Tithing belong to God. &gt;&gt; That's the first thing we need to understand because people tell you all kind of stuff. You just giving that money to your preacher. No, no, no, no. I gave it TO GOD. &gt;&gt; And whoever God gives it to, that's up to him. But I ain't going to be fighting with God. &gt;&gt; Tithing belongs to God. Uh Tithing is a uh something that was established way back. Amen. Abraham paid tithes uh to MelzDC in the book of Genesis. Hallelujah. Levi received tithes but also paid tithe in the laws of Abraham. You find that in Hebrews 7:9, right? But tithing has been a principle of the scripture since the very beginning and it still exists today. And &gt;&gt; let me just also mention this cuz there's some people with this new revelation. &gt;&gt; They say Jesus never spoke of tithing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're lying. &gt;&gt; Because there's two particular scriptures where Jesus spoke of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The first one that I found where he spoke of it was in Luke 18. He told the parable of the Pharisee WHO GAVE HIS TITHES OF ALL HE POSSESSED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Now the problem is is that when the MAN GAVE HIS TITHES on all these bless he was he was sitting there uh there was a a Pharisee and and another guy there a publican praying and the publican SAY LORD I AIN'T REALLY GOT MUCH BUT LORD I'M A SINNER AND I JUST I'M REPENTING BEFORE YOU BUT THE MAN SAID I PAID MY TITHE AND I'M NOT LIKE THIS PUBLICAN &gt;&gt; HE HAD A VERY HALTY SPIRIT EVEN THOUGH HE PAID HIS TITHE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. NOW JESUS DID NOT TAKE TITHING AWAY. HE SAID, HE SAID THE PROBLEM WAS IT'S THE SPIRIT THAT THE MAN, BUT NOT THAT HE PAID HIS TITHES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAID HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT DOING THAT, BUT HE NEEDED TO DO IT IN A BETTER SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; NOW, let me let me let me just let you in on a couple SECRETS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN GO TO CHURCH &gt;&gt; AND THEY STILL PAY THEIR TITHES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, GOD WANT MORE THAN JUST YOUR TITHES. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IF HE CAN HAVE YOU, YOU'LL BRING THEM YOUR TITHES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So you sometimes you got people that think they JUST COVERED UNDERNEATH A PROMISE because that's what I do. I pay my time. No, no. You just want the financial blessings. GOD, GOD GOT SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER YOU, &gt;&gt; not just the financial part, &gt;&gt; right? But but but then we got other people that need this restored in their life. &gt;&gt; This is why Malachi had to deal with these things. It was a restoration. AND THEY HAD LOST THESE PRINCIPLES after their bondage FOR 70 YEARS. THEY THEY FORGOT ABOUT WHERE THEIR BLESSINGS CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; Also another uh uh uh you found it in Matthew 23:23 where Jesus had told the Pharisee uh he told the Pharisees said, "Y'all pay tithes." Amen. But y'all leave the waiting matters of the law undone. And then he told them like this said he they were encouraged to have good judgment to have mercy to have faith and to still pay their tithes. &gt;&gt; So Jesus deal did deal did Jesus did deal with the situation. Tithing is something that all believers do. &gt;&gt; Let me just give y'all a few things. I'm I'm coming home right in here. This is where I wanted to get to. I I want to just coast just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. because uh in in Leviticus 27 and30, let's read that. Leviticus 27:30 and 31, tithing belong to God. And and God God established this this Levitical law that we're supposed to follow even to this day. I want to just say like this. We don't sell chicken dinners. &gt;&gt; We don't wash cars to support the church. &gt;&gt; We simply pay our tithes and our offering &gt;&gt; and God takes care of the rest. And God been doing it that way for 23 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're gonna keep going &gt;&gt; cuz it worked. &gt;&gt; Look at this in Leviticus 27. This is a this is a principle that was established in scripture. Jesus never took it out. Leviticus 27 and 30. We have that. &gt;&gt; It says and all the t of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's. It belong to God is the Lord's. It is holy unto the Lord. Now, here's a uh the next verse though gives us something here about tithing because God is so serious about his tithing. It belong to God. You're not supposed to take your tithing and use it to do other things with it. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I see somebody on the side of the road that look like they need it more than I needed. They needed more than God needed. and you going to give it. No, that ain't what God told you to do. Or some some sister that that's that's behind and a bill and you going to take God's tithe money and give it to her to pay. No, no, no, no, no. God said, "Bring bring the tithes to the storehouse." &gt;&gt; And here's the way you want to get that person to take care of. Let the deacons know about that need. &gt;&gt; Let the trustees know about that need and they can decide how they want to handle that need. But don't take God's money and go handle the need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you now. If you take God's money &gt;&gt; and you go handle other needs or your own personal needs, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; look at, let me just try to break this down. It says this. If a man will at all redeem all of his tithes, he shall add there to the fifth part thereof. That means if you take a part of your tithe &gt;&gt; and keep it back, &gt;&gt; then the part that you kept back, you got to pay that part PLUS 20% OF THAT part &gt;&gt; back to God. &gt;&gt; Now that's that's some interest. &gt;&gt; That's some serious interest. You don't want to get in trouble with God where now you got to catch up and paying 20% interest. HE ALL ALL HE ASKED YOU ALL HE ASKED YOU FOR WAS 10%. NOW YOU DONE GOT UP TO 30%. &gt;&gt; Don't play with God's money. &gt;&gt; WILL A MAN ROB GOD. &gt;&gt; YEP. IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS. TITHING IS 10% OF YOUR INCOME. OFFERING IS WHATEVER you want to give God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me SAY IT AGAIN. TITHING IS 10% OF YOUR INCOME. But offering is whatever you want to give God outside of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you, God is good. &gt;&gt; Let me give y'all a little bit more here. Uh, God being misunderstood. Brother Brandon makes some statements here. I love how Malachi had to reestablish this for the people. God had already told them these things in in Leviticus, but somehow they got away from these truths. But here, brother Brandham makes a statement and God being misunderstood. The question is asked to brother Brandham. Can a Christian go to heaven if he or she does not pay tithe? Look at this question. Look at this answer and God being misunderstood. He says, now that's one that I could not answer scripturally. I can't tell you scriptures whether you're going to go to heaven or not if you don't pay tithe. Says, "Now this father, son, and the holy spirit, if the ministry is sincere, just let us know." You see, we'll be glad. Brother Neville, myself, or brother Biller, brother Collins, or any of these ministers who are ordained to the ministry and so forth can do so. He says, "Now, but now does a Christian not get to heaven because they do not pay tithe." Do not pay tithe. This is where he says, "I could not say yes or no to that." He says, "But I do believe that every Christian is obligated to pay tiths." He says, "I do believe that every Christian is obligated to pay tithes because it is a commandment of the Lord." He says, "And blessed are they that do all his commandments that they might have right to enter into the life, the tree of life." Now, I do I I do believe that tithe paying is essential to a Christian experience for I'll uh I'll get to that in another question a few minutes. I know there's another one in here pertaining to that. All right. He um uh is going to skip down here to another uh question in the same message. And he the question is um just put this is don't you feel that everyone don't you feel that everyone put that in just like that. Don't you feel that everyone who claims to be a Christian should pay tithes, pay their tithes into the storehouse of the Lord? And they said, please give us scripture to this question. So, brother Brandon was dealing with it in the same message, God being misunderstood. He says, all right. He says, if you will, that is right. That the Bible said in Malachi the fourth chapter. Now, it wasn't the fourth chapter. It was the third chapter. We just read it. It's Malachi the third chapter. If you just put in, don't you feel that everyone uh it says that is that is right that that the Bible said in Malachi the 4th chapter will a man rob God and you say where have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings? Bring all your tithe and offerings into my storehouse and prove me sayith the Lord if I will not open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there'll not be room enough to receive. He says that's a challenge to any individual. He said that's a challenge to any individual. And if I only had the time and would not get to this little scripture that I wish to get to about the next 10 minutes, I would like to give you a personal testimony how that I was even hungry and my mother and them hungry and my daddy sick, but I took my tithes, Amen, out first and give it to God. And you ought to see what happened. I have never seen in my life that any man or a woman that if you only make $1 a week will bring the 10 cents of that money and put it into your storehouse, your church where you come. If if God don't bless that, call me a hypocrite. Yes, sir. That's a challenge to anybody. And every Christian that goes to this go that goes to this other question. Every Christian should pay tithes. That's right. It should be done. You know, Brother Brandham said if he had time, he would just share testimonies of how God has blessed um in paying tithes. And and and I'm one that I can share my own testimonies because I I pay ti. I pay ti. I've been paying them all my life. And um and I have seen God bless. The biggest blessing that I saw in my own life is when uh I lost my job and um uh I mean I had a job 14 years had been working here at this place and here they come and and just fire me. You're done. You're you're done. It's over with. And I got I got I got no income. Uh and um and you know here I am. you know, I still got house payment. I got all this and I don't know, you know, how are we going to get this thing worked out and we got behind trying to, you know, uh, sort out the bills. I think I was out of work for a number of months and we got way behind trying to sort out the bills. And the biggest bill that we got behind on was our house note. And anybody know when you get behind on a house note, uh, if you ain't pay for the house in cash, uh, and kept the taxes up, other people own your house. bank on the house. So the bank, you know, sent um was sending letters. I'm like, Lord, ain't nothing I can do here. Oh my. But here come God. Uh the policeman come early one morning knocking on the door, baming on my door. I'm like, I know I ain't done nothing wrong. Why the police at my house? What's going on? My wife wake me up. The police out there. I don't know what's going on. Police step outside. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Say, I'm just here to serve you these papers. Open up the papers. Thanks. So they coming to get the house. It's Lord Jesus. Well, I said the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Ain't nothing I can do right now. Nothing I can do but just leave this thing in God's hand. But before the bank come to take the house, God actually orchestrated where uh the salary that I I got a job, but my salary was less than what I was making before. So when I got this new job, the less salary. The bank decided that they would uh reconstruct the loan or redo the loan to actually lower the payments down to something I could afford with my new job. That was God rebuking &gt;&gt; the devourer for my sake. &gt;&gt; When God changed everything into my favor, that and I'm telling you, look, look, I'm here to tell you right now, God knows the plans &gt;&gt; that he has for you.
