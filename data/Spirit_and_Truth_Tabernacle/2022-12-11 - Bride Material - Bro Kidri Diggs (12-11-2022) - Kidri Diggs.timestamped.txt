[2:24] there come forth the Revival of the
[2:26] justice and a great power come among the
[2:28] church just before it's going it's not
[2:31] hard to pray that because you promised
[2:33] it and we're looking Lord for that third
[2:36] pool that we know that will do great
[2:38] things for us

[40:32] we enjoyed our cell phone uh Friday
[40:35] night my brother Diggs just
[40:38] um just blessed our hearts purging
[40:41] season and uh you know you have to
[40:44] encourage yourself when you're going
[40:46] through Seasons like that
[40:50] sometime and the church get purged
[40:53] sometimes in life
[40:55] things that you might be going through
[40:57] in a job there's a purging that comes
[40:59] sometimes to be a family there's a
[41:01] purging that comes but the purging
[41:04] process always brings something greater
[41:07] amen it never you never decrease in the
[41:10] purging process it's all to be
[41:13] beneficial to you and uh so we we learn
[41:16] to thank God in the midst of the purging
[41:18] process and brother Diggs was just
[41:20] saying how well he had another thought
[41:22] in his mind I seen him do it and I'm
[41:25] just glad he gave that little
[41:26] inspiration because it just took me
[41:28] right back down the memory lane and you
[41:31] know God God has done some Supernatural
[41:33] things for us and another dig start
[41:36] wiping his feet up yes and just I
[41:38] remember me and my daddy going into that
[41:40] place and and you know we we they
[41:45] um they just would not turn the music
[41:46] down and we just trying to ask certain
[41:48] like everywhere we go people just
[41:50] blasting aside with music until we came
[41:52] here right but uh but but but they were
[41:55] blasting that music and they wouldn't
[41:56] turn it down and say look I said I said
[41:58] Iglesia Iglesia Iglesia and because I
[42:02] know they didn't speak English I said
[42:04] church next door man see we ain't got no
[42:06] reaction the man was a woman they ain't
[42:09] got nothing to do with that we gonna do
[42:11] what we doing right over here
[42:12] I mean that lady would not listen and
[42:14] the two guys that was with us that was
[42:16] with her they were trying to get to just
[42:18] just let them have church no no no no no
[42:21] no we over here doing our thing they
[42:22] over there doing that saying my God
[42:24] rough spirit so I said well nothing I
[42:28] can do and as I was walking out the door
[42:30] me and my dad we walked out got to the
[42:33] carpet of the door and I just remember
[42:35] the scripture sometimes God just
[42:37] quickened the word to you and I just
[42:39] remember the scripture if they won't
[42:40] receive you in a certain city just wipe
[42:42] your feet as you're leaving that city so
[42:45] we just wiped out I wiped my feet on the
[42:48] mat and I walked out the door and I
[42:50] didn't know that my daddy saw what I did
[42:52] so my daddy did the same thing
[42:55] walked out the door the very next week
[42:58] that place was shut down
[43:04] would be seen again
[43:06] see so we don't see them do it we know
[43:09] what God is able to do he's a
[43:11] supernatural God and he's our God
[43:16] amen so sometimes we just gotta wait on
[43:19] them you know and amen the sunrise say I
[43:22] don't mind waiting
[43:24] don't mind waiting on the Lords amen I I
[43:29] just appreciate the Lord so I'm excited
[43:32] about what God got for us today let me
[43:33] just read these announcements amen and
[43:36] um

[45:11] and then the other thing is just make
[45:13] sure everybody have a change some change
[45:14] of clothes because some of the
[45:16] activities that they will be doing uh
[45:19] will it could cause you to get a little
[45:21] dirty so we don't want you to mess up
[45:23] your church clothes y'all know it used
[45:25] to be a time that uh people had
[45:29] oh
[45:30] [Music]
[45:30] [Applause]
[45:31] y'all don't know nothing about that
[45:34] yeah I don't know nothing about that
[45:36] they they had church clothes they had
[45:39] school clothes and they had
[45:42] play clothes they even don't get them
[45:45] mixed up don't don't do that in your
[45:48] church clothes and don't do that in your
[45:51] school clothes you put on your play
[45:54] clothes
[45:55] all right uh
[45:59] but that Fellowship ain't gonna be
[46:01] taking place amen at 2 30 so keep that
[46:04] in mind on this Tuesday night Brothers
[46:06] will be in Virtual prayer meeting and
[46:08] man we invite all the brothers to be a
[46:10] part of that and um we have our box in
[46:13] the back for our Christmas giving and
[46:16] just want to just make mention of this
[46:18] uh years ago
[46:21] um when we were going to Pinnacle palms
[46:24] and right before covet we saw changes
[46:26] begin to happen and we were just not
[46:29] allowed to kind of go into that door
[46:31] anymore and when covet came it was it
[46:34] just shut it down could not go back to
[46:36] Pinnacle Palms so at that point in time
[46:39] we began to pray especially as brothers
[46:42] we would get on the prayer line and we'd
[46:44] just start praying and asking God to
[46:46] open up the next door for our Outreach
[46:50] opportunity and the Lord opened the door
[46:54] for the pantry
[46:57] that is a Outreach opportunity
[47:02] I actually have a prayer request from
[47:04] one of the ladies that comes to the
[47:05] pantry
[47:07] um and and we're going to pray for her
[47:09] today but we have an opportunity to kind
[47:11] of share Christ and just just Express
[47:15] you know concern and care for people
[47:17] there and you know so
[47:21] um a few years ago as we were doing a
[47:23] business meeting I was telling everyone
[47:24] we're not looking for a whole bunch of
[47:27] opportunity to try to get our hands in
[47:29] let's take what we got and be efficient
[47:33] with what we have right make a
[47:36] difference with the ones that we have
[47:38] right and uh so one of the things that
[47:40] we that we did is uh we've been doing
[47:42] the turkeys for the last couple years
[47:45] since we haven't had something that the
[47:46] church would take on and uh and and that
[47:49] has spread people would just start
[47:51] telling their friends but these people
[47:52] get turkeys these people get turkeys I
[47:55] like that testimony because uh what
[47:59] happens is that if somebody knew that
[48:01] has never come before they get a chance
[48:03] to be touched by something that we do
[48:06] they get that opportunity it's an
[48:08] Outreach opportunity we never want to
[48:11] forget that and
[48:14] um
[48:14] so this time around what I felt led is
[48:18] we used to take the cards out and we
[48:21] would you know the gift cards for
[48:23] Christmas we just give them out we gave
[48:24] them to the school last year and we
[48:26] would go out and walk the neighborhood
[48:27] and give but we got people that come
[48:29] right to that pantry every week that
[48:34] would be blessed by those gift cards so
[48:38] my my plan is again be efficient with
[48:41] what we already got we don't have to
[48:43] spread ourselves thin let's be efficient
[48:46] with what we got and let's make a
[48:48] difference right there so what we're
[48:51] doing is we're going to give those gift
[48:53] cards to needy families right there at
[48:56] the at the pantry and uh but but I want
[48:59] to invite our young people to come out
[49:00] and be a part of that I think we're
[49:03] going to do it during a time where ain't
[49:04] no school amen the school will be out so
[49:09] our youth a man will be able to kind of
[49:11] come if the parents can just get them
[49:12] there we'll coordinate them you just be
[49:14] there and we want you to be the ones
[49:16] merry Christmas
[49:18] happy New Year Jesus Loves You amen we
[49:23] want our young people to be able to do
[49:24] that so we're gonna we're gonna be doing
[49:26] it the the the the giveaway is going to
[49:29] be on December 22nd I believe is a date
[49:32] so the last day to bring your cards will
[49:35] be next Sunday December 18th so bring
[49:38] your gift cards just drop them in that
[49:40] box in the back amen I think it's a gold
[49:42] box but just put fill out the little uh
[49:46] a card we want you to write a little
[49:47] note to the person that you're giving it
[49:49] to you don't know who whose hands is
[49:50] going to end up in so let the Lord lead
[49:52] you and what to write Amen to them so we
[49:55] want you to do that and so next Sunday
[49:58] would be the last sentence we'll give
[49:59] we'll have the box out but on December
[50:02] 22nd will be the date that we'll be
[50:03] giving it out at the pantry at the
[50:06] pantry so keep that keep that in mind

[1:03:29] second Peter chapter one
[1:03:34] let's start at verse four
[1:03:37] the Bible says whereby
[1:03:40] are giving unto us exceeding
[1:03:43] great and precious promises that by
[1:03:46] these ye might be partakers of the

[1:04:17] in you and abound they make you that ye
[1:04:20] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:04:23] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:27] Christ amen may the Lord blessed reading
[1:04:29] of his word you can have your seats
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:33] you know by the by the grace of God I
[1:04:36] want to speak of something that we're
[1:04:37] Familiar of or just a slogan that we're
[1:04:41] familiar but we kind of want to look
[1:04:42] into it a little bit you know and today
[1:04:44] I want to use for a subject bride
[1:04:46] material
[1:04:47] hey man Brad material we hear that all
[1:04:50] the time you know I'm bright material
[1:04:53] but you have to you you ask the question
[1:04:56] what makes you bright material you know
[1:04:58] when you say well uh I know God sent the
[1:05:01] prophet there's a lot of other people
[1:05:03] that believe in that same material
[1:05:05] there's a lot of other people that have
[1:05:07] been in this Services a lot of the
[1:05:08] people that got the books and tapes so
[1:05:11] they'll say I got the same material you
[1:05:13] got so what makes you different than
[1:05:16] them Hallelujah and you take bride
[1:05:19] material there has to be something that
[1:05:22] makes you worthy of being called a bride
[1:05:25] amen before man uh marries a woman the
[1:05:29] thing that that that that locks it in
[1:05:32] he's looking for a certain
[1:05:34] characteristics Hallelujah and that's
[1:05:37] what that's that's the meat of the
[1:05:39] message this morning the bride is known
[1:05:42] by our characteristics
[1:05:43] there's something that she will be
[1:05:46] identified by Hallelujah and no doubt
[1:05:49] when I think about material these these
[1:05:52] material that we're looking at they're
[1:05:54] not only in you
[1:05:57] Hallelujah they're not only in you but
[1:06:00] it's the makeup of all these materials
[1:06:03] that makes you ride because you know if
[1:06:06] you if you take my jacket and you take
[1:06:08] my pants both of them have some of the
[1:06:10] same materials in it but they're used
[1:06:13] for different things Hallelujah if you
[1:06:15] take my time even my jacket in my pants
[1:06:17] my time may have some of the same
[1:06:19] material amen but I don't wear my tie on
[1:06:22] my sleeve I wear my tie around my neck
[1:06:25] so the material in this was made for a
[1:06:27] special purpose
[1:06:29] Hallelujah the material in my jacket was
[1:06:31] made for a special purpose the materials
[1:06:34] in my shoes was made for a special
[1:06:36] purpose so I'm saying to you that the
[1:06:38] material God made in you that God put in
[1:06:41] you was made for a special purpose
[1:06:44] church if we look at the characteristics
[1:06:47] of something Hallelujah the
[1:06:48] characteristics identifies what it
[1:06:51] really is hallelujah and you know we got
[1:06:54] churches all over the world churches all
[1:06:57] over the place and some of these
[1:06:58] churches got some of the same works you
[1:07:00] got in it then Jesus he said if you if
[1:07:04] you can't believe me by my words Believe
[1:07:06] Me by the very works that I do
[1:07:08] Hallelujah so he wanted to say look at
[1:07:11] the material of my whole makeup and
[1:07:14] that's what we're looking at in this end
[1:07:15] time we're looking at the whole makeup
[1:07:18] of the believer not just you being able
[1:07:20] to pay tithes Hallelujah the Pentecostal
[1:07:23] church is doing better than you
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:28] think you look better than we do they
[1:07:31] don't mind seeing a pastor in a Bentley
[1:07:36] foreign
[1:07:44] seeing them in a nice seeing some nice
[1:07:47] clothing Hallelujah they give willfully
[1:07:50] in that area Hallelujah they're made of
[1:07:52] the material to give Hallelujah in
[1:07:56] church they give and they give
[1:07:58] abundantly Hallelujah but you know with
[1:08:00] us we'll find scriptures to back up on
[1:08:03] together
[1:08:06] so you can't just say I'm right because
[1:08:08] you pay tithes
[1:08:14] they pray just as much as you pray
[1:08:17] and God
[1:08:19] pray
[1:08:21] that's right you say well Brothers I'm
[1:08:24] faithful Hallelujah Jehovah Witness got
[1:08:26] us beat
[1:08:29] every morning they are dead in the
[1:08:31] trenches knocking on the doors with dogs
[1:08:34] getting slammed in their face but they
[1:08:36] still go to the next house
[1:08:40] sure
[1:08:45] it's what they believe in
[1:08:47] what they believe in they give their
[1:08:49] whole heart and soul to it even if it's
[1:08:53] wrong and we got truth
[1:08:58] and we're not as dedicated
[1:09:01] soon as somebody don't say what we like
[1:09:04] we gone we pick everything up and we're
[1:09:06] going to another spot
[1:09:09] oh my you got Hallelujah you say well
[1:09:13] brother Jesus I I'm just tired I can't I
[1:09:16] can't go to this meeting and you know I
[1:09:18] don't feel like traveling the moment's
[1:09:20] got you beat
[1:09:22] Hallelujah when the young brothers are
[1:09:24] being trained they put them on a bicycle
[1:09:26] they tell them to go in this area and I
[1:09:29] want you to witness what makes you Pride
[1:09:31] material
[1:09:38] these boys get on the bike and they ride
[1:09:40] through the neighborhood witnessing what
[1:09:43] they believe Church well about us
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:49] so what's the material of the Bride
[1:09:52] cause we can see and and I'm and I'm
[1:09:55] being honest I'm talking about myself I
[1:09:56] can look at denominations and see areas
[1:09:58] that where they weigh more they got way
[1:10:01] more Christianity than I do
[1:10:05] Hallelujah I know I remember I was
[1:10:07] working on a job and it was a hole in
[1:10:09] his brother who worked with me and you
[1:10:11] know the boss man will say uh I need you
[1:10:13] to go do this and go do that after I'm
[1:10:15] finished I'll be like man please
[1:10:18] I didn't did my job most people know I'm
[1:10:21] a Son of God I speak things into
[1:10:23] existence and can't follow a simple
[1:10:26] instruction
[1:10:27] oh
[1:10:28] and the wholeness man he said okay all
[1:10:30] right I'm going let's go do it made me
[1:10:32] feel this big Hallelujah Church what is
[1:10:35] it about us hallelujah that even though
[1:10:37] we got so much truth there's a little
[1:10:40] bit of arrogacy in US
[1:10:42] there's a little bit of laziness in us
[1:10:44] there's a little bit there's a little
[1:10:47] bit of something in us that doesn't
[1:10:49] reflect God
[1:10:50] but we say we're Pride material holy can
[1:10:54] you love like Jesus loves when you know
[1:10:56] something is wrong
[1:11:00] thank you
[1:11:02] Jesus Hallelujah woman was brought to
[1:11:05] him and caught in adultery
[1:11:10] seen the material
[1:11:12] honey the evidence was placed right
[1:11:14] before him what did he do earlier he
[1:11:17] could look past what she did Hallelujah
[1:11:19] and speaking to her future
[1:11:21] that's bright material
[1:11:24] Hallelujah
[1:11:26] but when we see something wrong the
[1:11:28] first thing we do is we judge it by the
[1:11:30] trial Hallelujah if we judge it by the
[1:11:33] trial amen we can't receive the life of
[1:11:36] job because job went through a trial
[1:11:38] with no explanation Joe went through a
[1:11:41] trial he did nothing wrong but he was
[1:11:43] accused of his brother in Hallelujah not
[1:11:46] by his characteristics but by what he
[1:11:48] was going through
[1:11:50] wow
[1:11:51] amen
[1:11:54] says I'm here let me hit this right
[1:11:56] quick
[1:11:57] oh my
[1:11:58] the prophet of God says
[1:12:01] he says you see a man's character is
[1:12:04] made known by his works whatever you are
[1:12:08] your Works prove that you are no matter
[1:12:12] how much you testify
[1:12:15] you know some people testify because
[1:12:17] they want to be seen
[1:12:19] but let's move on
[1:12:20] whatever you say Pro or con you know
[1:12:25] some people have a special because they
[1:12:27] won't be people to know how good their
[1:12:28] voice are
[1:12:31] some people get up and play their
[1:12:32] instruments and have specials and things
[1:12:34] because they write songs and have no
[1:12:36] anointing
[1:12:42] and then the song leader after you get
[1:12:44] up and sing your special with with no
[1:12:46] anointing just because you wrote it and
[1:12:49] all these things mess up the whole
[1:12:50] service and the song leader has to get
[1:12:52] up and get the anointing back flowing
[1:12:54] again because he's being graceful unto
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:57] the Bible says be skillful in all things
[1:13:05] things you know I thank God for the
[1:13:06] people who say well brother I just can't
[1:13:08] seem
[1:13:09] they know their position
[1:13:13] they're gonna try to create an anointing
[1:13:16] Hallelujah an anointing comes with a
[1:13:18] gift
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:22] now I ain't telling nobody not to sing
[1:13:25] Hallelujah but what I'm saying watch
[1:13:28] motive and objective watch out motive
[1:13:30] and objective cause you're projecting
[1:13:32] something amen there's a certain
[1:13:34] characteristic behind everything we do
[1:13:37] earlier there's the characteristics
[1:13:39] behind me preaching this word this
[1:13:41] morning what is it I'm trying to get you
[1:13:43] closer to God
[1:13:44] holy why because I don't have a church I
[1:13:47] don't have any place to bring any of you
[1:13:49] so what's my purpose here hallelujah to
[1:13:52] make your life better
[1:13:55] Hallelujah he says no matter how much
[1:13:57] you testify whether you say a pro a con
[1:14:00] that has nothing to do with it your
[1:14:02] words tell what you are tells what you
[1:14:06] are inside every job that you do
[1:14:09] manifests is what you are every job that
[1:14:12] you do Hallelujah in the church or out
[1:14:15] the church whatever you do you should do
[1:14:18] it unto the law because it's supposed to
[1:14:21] project the characteristics of Pride
[1:14:23] materials
[1:14:25] appreciate you Pride material is
[1:14:29] supposed to be able to endure suffering
[1:14:32] Pride material is supposed to endure
[1:14:35] Hallelujah being able to have patience
[1:14:38] and wait on God
[1:14:40] amen listen
[1:14:45] church if we think about character
[1:14:47] just uh just a uh uh the definition of
[1:14:51] character
[1:14:52] it says can be character can be defined
[1:14:56] listen to this as a collection of
[1:15:00] personality traits within our Behavior
[1:15:04] she's so character speaks of ingredients
[1:15:10] just one thing because one thing we
[1:15:13] might be good of but what are you
[1:15:15] collectively
[1:15:17] Hallelujah you might be good getting to
[1:15:20] church on time
[1:15:22] but that doesn't make up your character
[1:15:24] Hallelujah you might be good at praying
[1:15:27] but it has to be collectively other
[1:15:29] things that go in line with your prayer
[1:15:32] Hallelujah see church amen as Christians
[1:15:35] and people of God there's a supernatural
[1:15:38] material we're made of and it has
[1:15:41] nothing to do with the skin
[1:15:43] Hallelujah
[1:15:48] because if I'm gone and you can't see me
[1:15:51] Hallelujah what's the reality of who I
[1:15:54] am
[1:15:55] what you think about me
[1:16:00] when I'm going and the preaching is over
[1:16:02] with and my name come up hallelujah what
[1:16:06] you gonna speak about me is the
[1:16:07] characteristics that you believe and
[1:16:09] seen in me
[1:16:11] you say man that man is a good preacher
[1:16:13] but that's not the whole collection of
[1:16:15] who I am
[1:16:20] and as Believers amen amen the
[1:16:24] church-aged book amen is is is not all
[1:16:28] Who We Are
[1:16:29] the seven seal book is not all who we
[1:16:32] are being able to say God said the
[1:16:34] prophet is not all who we are because
[1:16:37] this message is a collective Hallelujah
[1:16:40] of things that God has brought back to
[1:16:43] the believer and as we receive this
[1:16:46] message we receive the character of God
[1:16:50] Hallelujah
[1:16:52] but the message is not a man
[1:16:57] exactly right are you with me Church
[1:17:01] see broad material what makes us bright
[1:17:04] because everybody believed they going to
[1:17:05] heaven
[1:17:06] we got loved ones who then died and we
[1:17:08] went to the free to to the funeral and
[1:17:10] the preacher preached him in heaven and
[1:17:12] you knew their life didn't reflect the
[1:17:14] place they was gone
[1:17:18] to your life right now Hallelujah the
[1:17:21] life you're living right now in and out
[1:17:24] the church speaks of your journey
[1:17:27] in or out the church speaks where you're
[1:17:30] going and if you would happen to Holy
[1:17:32] eyes closed and your spirit leave your
[1:17:35] body the characteristics that you've
[1:17:37] been projecting up until now tells your
[1:17:39] destiny
[1:17:41] because remember remember the prophet of
[1:17:43] God said death does not change who you
[1:17:46] are Hallelujah it only changes your
[1:17:49] Dwelling Place
[1:17:50] so let me ask you church are you
[1:17:52] dwelling in heaven
[1:17:54] you're supposed to be in heaven right
[1:17:57] now I'm not waiting on Hallelujah for my
[1:17:59] for my for my for my death sentence I'm
[1:18:02] not waiting Hallelujah for the skies to
[1:18:04] crack I'm already in heaven Hallelujah
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:09] oh my
[1:18:11] God but what we have to believe about
[1:18:13] ourselves that there is a pit of
[1:18:16] potential in us hallelujah to be the
[1:18:18] wife of Christ
[1:18:20] no matter what you might look at no
[1:18:22] matter what you might think about me God
[1:18:25] put something in me to meet his
[1:18:27] requirements
[1:18:28] and what I have to do is live a life
[1:18:31] worthy Hallelujah of being called
[1:18:34] Hollywood the bride of Christ because a
[1:18:37] man ain't just going to take a woman off
[1:18:38] the street and say I'm ready to marry
[1:18:39] you no there's a certain criteria she
[1:18:41] got me
[1:18:43] amen you can say what you wanted man
[1:18:46] some some brothers like eyes Hallelujah
[1:18:48] some brothers like hair some brothers
[1:18:50] like skin tone different thing Holly and
[1:18:52] some brothers like personality
[1:18:59] just because hallelujah amen I might
[1:19:03] like hair that doesn't mean that doesn't
[1:19:05] like personality
[1:19:09] her skin tone amen her personality is a
[1:19:13] collection of the character I'm looking
[1:19:15] for
[1:19:18] because when you think of a woman
[1:19:19] hallelujah amen that had character amen
[1:19:22] you know you could say Ruth yeah Ruth
[1:19:25] was Ruth Ruth was a woman of character
[1:19:27] amen she was a woman who came from a
[1:19:29] certain place and her character but her
[1:19:32] character was moved it
[1:19:34] holy character listen to this one other
[1:19:38] thing about character we must if we must
[1:19:40] identify with your character can also be
[1:19:43] molded by influence in your life
[1:19:47] because because Ruth's character was
[1:19:51] molded by the influence of Naomi
[1:19:56] that's why the Bible says yet the
[1:19:58] younger teach the older teach the y'all
[1:20:01] and you sisters are eight you owe the
[1:20:03] sisters I put in position to help mow
[1:20:06] the character of these younger
[1:20:08] are you bright material
[1:20:17] because this is what a real wife does a
[1:20:20] real a real wife she teaches the girls
[1:20:23] up under her Shadow how to be a real
[1:20:25] wife
[1:20:27] amen amen amen
[1:20:31] praise the Lord
[1:20:33] but when we
[1:20:35] when we think about the characteristics
[1:20:37] of something
[1:20:38] we think about that the root word
[1:20:39] character everybody all right
[1:20:42] character can be identified by the
[1:20:44] collection of personality traits it's
[1:20:46] traits
[1:20:48] it's things that are already there
[1:20:53] see a trait is something that you don't
[1:20:56] add it's already there
[1:20:58] see I got treats on my father in me
[1:21:00] whether I like it or not because
[1:21:03] sometimes I do something and my mama say
[1:21:05] you ain't nothing like you just like
[1:21:07] that Gene Diggs
[1:21:11] trace of my father honey whether I ever
[1:21:14] seen him do it or not she can look at me
[1:21:17] and say I've seen this before
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:23] Hallelujah and if your bride material we
[1:21:26] should be able to see the traits of
[1:21:28] Jesus in his absence in you
[1:21:32] because when you go to acts the fourth
[1:21:35] chapter Hallelujah when the disciples
[1:21:37] came the people the Bible say they took
[1:21:39] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:21:41] with Jesus why because they seen the
[1:21:44] same traits
[1:21:45] Hallelujah they asked John the Baptist
[1:21:48] are you the Messiah why because they
[1:21:51] seen the traits of God inside of them
[1:21:54] we should see the same thing in us in
[1:21:57] our churches in our families Hallelujah
[1:22:00] we should see the collection of the
[1:22:02] tastes of Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] it is not something that you put on it's
[1:22:07] not something that you make up it's
[1:22:09] something that just oozes out of you
[1:22:12] some of y'all
[1:22:19] Glory when something ooze it just comes
[1:22:23] out you can't stop it
[1:22:25] she will not make it on herself bride
[1:22:28] we're just bearing the fruits
[1:22:30] of broad material
[1:22:33] because a sheep he doesn't ask for wool
[1:22:37] he just Bears it no matter what the
[1:22:41] weather's like
[1:22:42] no matter what kind of condition he's
[1:22:44] under
[1:22:45] what's in him it automatically begins to
[1:22:48] develop
[1:22:49] ment amen oh my why because the the

[1:27:09] characteristics in it
[1:27:11] let's keep going a little bit
[1:27:13] it says this is seen in our integrity
[1:27:17] so your integrity makes up a collection
[1:27:19] a part of the collection of your
[1:27:21] character
[1:27:22] Hallelujah where is the Integrity in the
[1:27:26] church
[1:27:28] think about it Church
[1:27:30] when I think of Integrity I think of a
[1:27:33] man that tooks Abraham's wife
[1:27:36] the king who who was actually being
[1:27:38] tricked
[1:27:40] he he he was being tricked what he was
[1:27:43] doing he was following his heart he saw
[1:27:46] something he wanted and he went to get
[1:27:48] it Hallelujah but he didn't realize he
[1:27:50] was messing with bride material
[1:27:53] oh my God whoa and sometimes things will
[1:27:57] happen to you but you got to hold your
[1:28:00] integrity
[1:28:01] don't cut down on a kind of level amen
[1:28:04] keep your integrity no matter what they
[1:28:07] say about this message hold on to your
[1:28:09] integrity
[1:28:11] amen because I don't witness this
[1:28:13] message by what brother Branham did I
[1:28:15] witnessed this message by what God did
[1:28:17] in my life
[1:28:18] hey guys
[1:28:20] Hallelujah
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:24] see the message is not a book and a tape
[1:28:28] the message is a person
[1:28:30] yeah go away and you know people say ah
[1:28:34] brother D's you just said you know I
[1:28:36] didn't ask I didn't have somebody uh
[1:28:37] email me and say I'll be trying to
[1:28:39] excite the people
[1:28:40] and I'll be like duh
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:46] why would you want to listen to somebody
[1:28:48] who don't believe in what they preaching
[1:28:50] to you
[1:28:51] why would you want to listen to somebody
[1:28:52] who's not confident in what they telling
[1:28:55] you you can experience the same thing
[1:28:57] why would you want to listen to somebody
[1:28:59] who's telling you about the experience
[1:29:00] Hallelujah and they're not overwhelmed
[1:29:03] by it
[1:29:04] telling the testimony of it church I can
[1:29:07] tell y'all some things God has done for
[1:29:09] me Hallelujah and it gets me to shaking
[1:29:11] Hallelujah it gets me to a place brother
[1:29:13] Jack where I can say I seen him do it
[1:29:17] Hallelujah I walked in the hospital
[1:29:18] Hollywood where they say you got
[1:29:20] diabetes and walked out saying you ain't
[1:29:22] got it the doctor said I ain't got it
[1:29:25] not just my testimony their testimony
[1:29:29] Hallelujah
[1:29:34] I went to one hospital by the time it
[1:29:36] was over with
[1:29:38] the doctor was asking me how come this
[1:29:40] test negative and this test positive I
[1:29:42] said I don't know all I know is I'm
[1:29:43] Healed
[1:29:46] see when you're confident in the things
[1:29:48] of God the characteristics will make
[1:29:50] other people see what you see
[1:29:53] Hallelujah
[1:29:54] but church we as people of God like I
[1:29:56] say is when I think about integrity it
[1:29:59] brings me to this man of abimelech
[1:30:01] earlier and church she says he he he was
[1:30:06] like hey why went to Abraham was like
[1:30:07] man why did you lie to me
[1:30:09] why'd you tell me that like I said last
[1:30:12] night one of the key things we have to
[1:30:14] get out the church to identify the
[1:30:16] character of God is fear
[1:30:19] all right
[1:30:20] there's too much fear in the church we
[1:30:24] get rid of that fear we'll see some
[1:30:25] Supernatural things look at the
[1:30:28] Believers when there was no fear earlier
[1:30:30] and sometimes when you're afraid that's
[1:30:32] when God comes Hallelujah to show you
[1:30:34] who you really are look at amen look at
[1:30:37] Gideon's greatest accomplishment it was
[1:30:40] in times when he was afraid and God came
[1:30:43] on the scene he's there hiding behind
[1:30:45] the wine press and God comes and speaks
[1:30:47] into his life and tells him who he
[1:30:49] really are he's telling Gideon your
[1:30:51] bride material he says get in Hallelujah
[1:30:54] you're a mighty man of Allah and he's
[1:30:57] behind the wine press hide
[1:31:04] some of us are hiding because of fear
[1:31:06] and you know there's a word I'm so sick
[1:31:09] of hearing since Virginia Hallelujah
[1:31:11] there's a word that we've let integrate
[1:31:13] in our churches and we're trying to make
[1:31:15] it normal my anxiety
[1:31:20] wow it's gotten so common that we're in
[1:31:23] Fighting Fear in our life because it
[1:31:26] sounds intellectual my anxiety anxiety
[1:31:29] is no more than fear
[1:31:32] stop claiming that stuff over yourself
[1:31:36] have no anxiety
[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:38] I believe in God
[1:31:40] I heard preachers say my anxiety touch
[1:31:43] me with my anxiety you're saying my
[1:31:45] fears I'm claiming my fears and the
[1:31:48] Bible says the thing you fear will come
[1:31:50] upon you
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:51] it's not a characteristics of bride
[1:31:54] material
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:59] my anxiety hold your butter
[1:32:04] Lord help me
[1:32:09] my church
[1:32:10] the Integrity of something will speak of
[1:32:13] his character
[1:32:14] you know it's it's like a person going
[1:32:17] through something
[1:32:18] and you don't know why they're going
[1:32:19] through it but they holy peace
[1:32:21] and they stay faithful to God they keep
[1:32:24] coming to church and all y'all can see
[1:32:26] what they're going through see Integrity
[1:32:28] Integrity will push past eyes being on
[1:32:31] them
[1:32:35] Joe's wife said how long
[1:32:38] how long will you hold on to your
[1:32:40] integrity
[1:32:42] wow will you try to keep believing in
[1:32:44] this thing
[1:32:46] and the more the trial persists
[1:32:49] the more Revelation came out of job
[1:32:52] say woman you speak as the foolish woman
[1:32:55] you expect now these words shock me
[1:32:58] you'll remember the first time already
[1:32:59] he said you expect to receive all good
[1:33:01] and no evil
[1:33:03] at the hand of the Lord
[1:33:08] so some things you think you say oh God
[1:33:11] I messed up God allows you to mess up
[1:33:13] God wanted you to mess up
[1:33:16] because it was going to give him a
[1:33:18] pathway to show you one of his
[1:33:20] characteristics his characteristics as a
[1:33:22] deliverer
[1:33:24] Hallelujah
[1:33:25] so God would allow things to happen why
[1:33:27] just to demonstrate who he is
[1:33:31] there's things in our life that brings
[1:33:33] out his traits
[1:33:35] Hallelujah
[1:33:37] oh my
[1:33:39] god listen Church
[1:33:40] when we think about character and the
[1:33:43] characteristics of something now that
[1:33:46] that little baby lion hallelujah what it
[1:33:49] is everything that's in it is already in
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:53] all it has to do is sit back and be
[1:33:56] patient
[1:33:58] see the mama and the daddy Ain't Gonna
[1:34:01] Take It on a hunt
[1:34:03] It Ain't Gonna Take It On the Hunt
[1:34:04] because they know it's not ready yet so
[1:34:08] what they'll do they'll put it in a
[1:34:10] place of protection and say wait God
[1:34:12] come back
[1:34:14] but in the waiting process that doesn't
[1:34:17] stop it from being who it is
[1:34:19] Hallelujah that doesn't stop it from
[1:34:22] being king of the jungle that doesn't
[1:34:24] stop a church look at this look at that
[1:34:26] meow and that raw Hallelujah church that
[1:34:30] that that little Roy that we heard has
[1:34:32] the potential to go five miles
[1:34:41] it's already in it
[1:34:44] but as it grows Hallelujah its vocals
[1:34:48] get stronger and stronger Hallelujah
[1:34:50] whether it knows it's happening or not
[1:34:52] it's going through a transformation as
[1:34:55] it grows
[1:34:57] there's something happening on the
[1:34:58] inside of the church while we're growing
[1:35:01] there's something happening inside of
[1:35:04] the Bride while we're waiting to walk
[1:35:06] down the altar
[1:35:07] yes
[1:35:10] you know a woman Hallelujah will she
[1:35:12] know her wedding date she falls deeper
[1:35:14] and deeper in love with the ceremony
[1:35:21] so y'all brothers ain't laughing cause
[1:35:22] you got to pay for it
[1:35:26] preach
[1:35:28] 1010 one of my close friends
[1:35:30] when she was getting married
[1:35:33] I could just see the look on her husband
[1:35:34] face
[1:35:35] her husband to be
[1:35:37] and he was like oh my God he looked like
[1:35:40] he was so drained
[1:35:42] like he was so worried about this and
[1:35:43] that inducing that and she'd been
[1:35:45] waiting for years to get married
[1:35:47] and he was like why am we spending money
[1:35:49] on this we're spending money on that so
[1:35:50] I pulled him aside and I said bro
[1:35:53] let her have this moment
[1:35:56] I said bro let her have this moment
[1:35:58] because she's been waiting a very very
[1:36:00] long time money can be replaced but this
[1:36:03] moment gonna live with her forever
[1:36:06] Hallelujah all the different bridesmaids
[1:36:08] that she call all the groomsmen
[1:36:10] Hallelujah to play the venue the food
[1:36:12] all the stuff he gonna live with her
[1:36:14] Hallelujah forever for the rest of her
[1:36:17] life
[1:36:18] Hallelujah it gonna be something that
[1:36:20] she take with her Hallelujah everywhere
[1:36:23] she go when she see you she gonna
[1:36:25] remember the ceremony
[1:36:32] and right now we're in the ceremony
[1:36:36] and some of y'all don't know who you're
[1:36:37] marrying
[1:36:40] Hallelujah
[1:36:42] you sitting around giving him mannequin
[1:36:44] worship
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:56] you change clothes but you're still in
[1:36:58] the same position
[1:37:00] Hallelujah church you can dress a
[1:37:03] mannequin up make it look real nice but
[1:37:05] it'll never speak back it'll never move
[1:37:08] it'll never talk to you why because
[1:37:09] there's no life inside
[1:37:13] Hallelujah and the real bride of Christ
[1:37:15] she will always speak back when the word
[1:37:18] is being preached because there's
[1:37:20] something inside of her that's being
[1:37:22] identified
[1:37:23] Hallelujah that's why when when
[1:37:26] Michelangelo Hallelujah created a statue
[1:37:29] of Moses everything that was in his mind
[1:37:32] was standing before him he saw the
[1:37:34] characteristics of everything that was
[1:37:36] up here until it was so real to him he
[1:37:38] said talk to me
[1:37:40] speak and when the characteristics of
[1:37:43] God hallelujah goes out of his mind into
[1:37:46] you where he becomes a real reflection
[1:37:48] God said it's not whatever I say is
[1:37:51] whatsoever you say
[1:37:57] see we see we got we got so much stuff
[1:37:58] on tape we don't even realize God is
[1:38:01] developing character in us remember the
[1:38:03] story of John Ryan
[1:38:05] holy that's not just for healing
[1:38:10] I noticed every time Jack gets up and he
[1:38:13] said we thank the Lord for the new
[1:38:14] church
[1:38:17] is that not the same thing we saw in
[1:38:19] John Ryan
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:22] thank the Lord for the new church
[1:38:24] thank the Lord for the new parking lot
[1:38:27] thank the Lord for a building we don't
[1:38:29] have to let nobody open up for us
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] and God I'm believing you Hallelujah to
[1:38:37] do this very quickly
[1:38:39] Hallelujah words on Ryan said Hallelujah
[1:38:42] we think it's all about healing no the
[1:38:44] spoken word is for whatever you may need
[1:38:47] those characteristics of the spoken word
[1:38:50] is in you whether it be for a church or
[1:38:52] whether it be for healing in your body
[1:38:54] whether it be for your finances amen
[1:38:56] speak over your situation
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:04] but the thing about it Hallelujah ain't
[1:39:06] enough of us speaking
[1:39:11] a a wedding ceremony yeah the main two
[1:39:15] parts are the bride in the Grooms but
[1:39:19] everybody else in there make up the
[1:39:20] wedding
[1:39:27] but the thing about a powerful wedding
[1:39:29] it can be online and you'll be like man
[1:39:32] that way that went boy that went was off
[1:39:33] the hook
[1:39:35] sometimes you you you when something is
[1:39:38] so great it's so powerful you you you
[1:39:40] lose words you mean that thing was on
[1:39:42] the hizzy
[1:39:45] oh no for real on my chiller
[1:39:54] am I in the book words cannot express
[1:39:58] what God means to us
[1:40:01] and the Bible says hallelujah sometimes
[1:40:04] there's moaning and groaning that goes
[1:40:06] out they were stinking Hallelujah when
[1:40:07] you can't find the words that needs to
[1:40:09] be uttered
[1:40:11] because you think about that ceremony
[1:40:12] amen the thing about it you can look at
[1:40:15] it and watch it on a film or get a tape
[1:40:17] whatever you'll be like man that was
[1:40:18] powerful I mean he was he was it looked
[1:40:20] like it was so nice but if you was in
[1:40:23] the wedding
[1:40:26] I can tell to that person who say hey
[1:40:28] hey did you know I've seen you had on
[1:40:30] this I see you it looked like it was
[1:40:31] nice it was it was good I said you know
[1:40:33] what I was there
[1:40:36] so what you talking about I was a part
[1:40:39] of
[1:40:40] Holly I heard the tone in her voice when
[1:40:42] she said I do Hallelujah I heard the
[1:40:46] confidence in his voice when he said I
[1:40:48] will
[1:40:49] I was there and there's things about God
[1:40:53] Church Hallelujah that we can say I was
[1:40:55] there the prophet of God said when he
[1:40:58] went down Hallelujah cross he said I was
[1:41:00] there I was in him he's talking about
[1:41:02] George Washington and all the different
[1:41:04] stuff as an American I was there that's
[1:41:07] all right but I don't want to be too
[1:41:08] much identified with America
[1:41:13] because of his characteristics
[1:41:21] my mama
[1:41:23] but
[1:41:24] the experience of something
[1:41:27] brings it on a whole other level
[1:41:29] when you experience something you know
[1:41:32] what there's people
[1:41:33] watching us right now
[1:41:36] and they're sitting at home
[1:41:38] on their couches
[1:41:40] so I'm on my in the bed
[1:41:42] pillow
[1:41:47] and they watching us let me tell you
[1:41:49] something you ain't in church
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:58] if you're going through the motions
[1:42:01] I know church is on so let me do my due
[1:42:04] diligence and cut it on and watch it
[1:42:06] just in case somebody asks me what the
[1:42:09] preacher talk about but let me tell you
[1:42:10] something you ain't here so you can't
[1:42:13] feel this anointing we feel
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:18] oh let me let me stop because you know
[1:42:20] one thing about Hallelujah watching me
[1:42:22] on on online you can pause me
[1:42:27] honey we gonna come back to this
[1:42:31] better yet let's fast forward him
[1:42:34] you can make me say things I ain't ready
[1:42:36] to say that
[1:42:41] you know what's made streaming so
[1:42:44] popular fear
[1:42:48] oh yeah fear has made people willing to
[1:42:52] stay home instead of being in church
[1:42:56] the fear of covering the fear of
[1:42:58] catching germs Hallelujah well let me
[1:43:00] tell you something Church there's a
[1:43:02] characteristics in our life that will
[1:43:04] always fight every germ every day every
[1:43:07] hour and it's called by his stripes
[1:43:11] we are healed
[1:43:16] so I'd rather not live in fear
[1:43:19] but I'd rather live in faith the Bible
[1:43:22] says hallelujah if these things be in
[1:43:24] you and abound you will never be buried
[1:43:30] in this scripture Hallelujah what's the
[1:43:33] base of where he preached the statue of
[1:43:34] a perfect man
[1:43:38] but if I can y'all know I'm about to
[1:43:40] close don't get nervous
[1:43:43] Church
[1:43:44] if you know this Hallelujah
[1:43:46] when you think about the
[1:43:48] the attributes of sin and fear and
[1:43:52] sickness and all these things what if I
[1:43:54] could prove to you that sickness ain't
[1:43:56] even real wow that's right
[1:44:02] I'm gonna tell you right now diabetes
[1:44:05] ain't even real
[1:44:08] cancer ain't even real
[1:44:11] yeah Hallelujah depression ain't even
[1:44:14] real
[1:44:16] ity heartache and pain ain't even real
[1:44:19] and you might be sitting right here and
[1:44:21] you say I don't know about that but I
[1:44:24] know somebody who died of cancer
[1:44:26] well let me ask you a question can
[1:44:28] somebody leave this earth before it's
[1:44:30] God's time
[1:44:32] so did they die of cancer or they die
[1:44:35] because God was ready for them to go
[1:44:38] let's put it in a proper perspective
[1:44:40] and let's go a little bit deeper in
[1:44:42] Hallelujah the prophet of God said sin
[1:44:45] is not a creation Hallelujah so if
[1:44:48] cancer is not a creation is it real
[1:44:51] if diabetes is not a creation is it real
[1:44:56] if it wasn't created that means it's a
[1:44:59] perversion
[1:45:04] Hallelujah and I want you to look at
[1:45:07] your sickness and you speak to that
[1:45:08] perversion and say I command you to go
[1:45:11] back into the original condition
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:14] what's the original condition Hallelujah
[1:45:16] of sadness Joy
[1:45:19] because Joy came from what the creation
[1:45:22] of God
[1:45:27] Hallelujah
[1:45:30] so Church we're believing in things that
[1:45:32] are not even real cancer comes from
[1:45:35] wounded cells
[1:45:37] it's not a creation in your body it's a
[1:45:40] perversion in your body
[1:45:43] so what gives it life your fear
[1:45:47] the characteristics of fear will produce
[1:45:50] sickness
[1:45:54] what is fear false evidences appearing
[1:45:57] real
[1:46:01] life but you give me a man or a woman
[1:46:02] with no fear in their life they'll
[1:46:05] operate Hallelujah under the under the
[1:46:08] potential God created them with life
[1:46:11] even though Peter
[1:46:13] was a liar
[1:46:16] cussing like a sailor
[1:46:19] ready to fight
[1:46:21] cutting off ears aiming for next
[1:46:25] y'all can say what you want I don't
[1:46:26] believe he was aiming for ear
[1:46:30] cut your hair off
[1:46:33] not in them days

[1:46:38] to use

[1:52:43] circumstances
[1:52:46] his love is reckless
[1:52:49] calling it but a good Reckless
[1:52:52] Hallelujah a reckless meeting
[1:52:55] Unstoppable
[1:52:57] a reckless meaning unquenchable
[1:53:00] a reckless meaning irreversible once God
[1:53:04] made his mind up about you he couldn't
[1:53:05] change it
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:14] but if we look at the characteristics or
[1:53:15] something
[1:53:17] the characteristics of a thing tells
[1:53:19] what it is
[1:53:20] I want to read you something before I
[1:53:22] get out your way
[1:53:23] listen this is in the message um
[1:53:27] uh God identified by him by his
[1:53:30] characteristics
[1:53:32] this is in a 64 320. and I'm gonna start
[1:53:36] at paragraph 14.
[1:53:38] but I want you to catch something
[1:53:40] because we're talking about bride
[1:53:41] material
[1:53:43] but I'm saying that look Church
[1:53:46] we got a lot of people and and we're not
[1:53:49] here to
[1:53:50] to put our eyes on people to try to be
[1:53:52] the judge
[1:53:53] no the only thing we want to look at is
[1:53:55] ourselves
[1:53:57] okay I I don't want to put my eyes on
[1:53:59] Jack and what Jack doing not between him
[1:54:01] and God my job is to still love him like
[1:54:04] a brother no matter what my eyes may see
[1:54:07] that's when we miss the characteristics
[1:54:09] of God when we see somebody going
[1:54:11] through something we trying to find
[1:54:13] reasons why they're going to it but I
[1:54:15] say hallelujah amen and I didn't told
[1:54:17] y'all this before the best Ministry God
[1:54:20] has ever put on the face of the Earth
[1:54:21] Hallelujah is to shut your mouth
[1:54:24] Ministry
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:27] [Applause]
[1:54:29] and I'm still practicing that to this
[1:54:32] day
[1:54:34] cause I got one more girl
[1:54:37] [Applause]
[1:54:40] and she at the age where she got
[1:54:43] questions
[1:54:44] that she will fight you with the word
[1:54:49] the prophet said this and the prophet
[1:54:51] said that Hallelujah and if it's correct
[1:54:53] what you gonna do as a father you got to
[1:54:56] say okay
[1:54:59] no matter how you might feel
[1:55:02] Hallelujah
[1:55:04] you have to shut your mouth
[1:55:06] and let God deal with
[1:55:08] it see that's the hardest part brother
[1:55:10] Solomon you looking at it you saying if
[1:55:12] I don't give I don't hit the Venus then
[1:55:14] go this way this way or that way God
[1:55:16] might want it to go that way
[1:55:18] so he can deal with them
[1:55:20] and then they can see they went the
[1:55:21] wrong way and then they can come back
[1:55:23] there's always room to come back
[1:55:26] hallelujah what you have to realize as a
[1:55:29] parent Hallelujah if you dedicated your
[1:55:32] child to God they belong to him
[1:55:35] but the problem is too many of us try to
[1:55:37] take them back
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:48] he said well you was raised up in church
[1:55:49] you was just using that look they know
[1:55:51] that
[1:55:53] you know you you just don't know how
[1:55:55] hard it is for them out
[1:55:57] especially kids that grew up in church
[1:56:00] the prophet of God he was talking about
[1:56:01] Billy Paul he said for Billy to go in
[1:56:04] the world he has to walk over my life
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:08] yo kids my kids if we live the life
[1:56:11] before them well they can see the
[1:56:13] characteristics of God before they smoke
[1:56:15] before they drink before they dance
[1:56:17] before they party whatever they thinking
[1:56:19] they want to do they have to think about
[1:56:21] me first
[1:56:26] [Applause]
[1:56:28] because they were raised up under a
[1:56:31] certain character amen
[1:56:38] oh my yeah and we got a promise it said
[1:56:42] raise them up in the way that you're
[1:56:44] going when they get older it won't
[1:56:45] depart from
[1:56:46] man so if you don't raise them up the
[1:56:47] entire 18 20 whatever they is and they
[1:56:50] may I'm gonna flash back on y'all use
[1:56:52] some owl words they may be out there
[1:56:54] going Buck Wow
[1:56:58] see y'all young people don't know
[1:56:59] nothing about that one
[1:57:08] that's one of the hours
[1:57:11] all right that means losing a mind
[1:57:15] because you think about a bucket
[1:57:18] going crazy
[1:57:21] because somebody on his back and he want
[1:57:23] it all and young kids go out there in
[1:57:26] the world don't realize it's the devil
[1:57:28] on their back
[1:57:29] and the other thing
[1:57:32] they go cause everybody
[1:57:34] trying to get the devil off they back
[1:57:36] but the only way you can get them off is
[1:57:38] to come back to God
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:45] cause you take a wild horse how do you
[1:57:47] tame it by love
[1:57:50] sir you can get it you can get it you
[1:57:52] can get the greatest Cowboy ever he'll
[1:57:54] jump on there and he'll get bucked too
[1:57:57] but it ain't that horse gonna only stop
[1:57:59] bucking till he feel like his life is
[1:58:01] not in danger
[1:58:04] Hallelujah
[1:58:07] okay what time more time
[1:58:12] okay
[1:58:13] listen
[1:58:15] uh paragraph 14.
[1:58:17] let's look at the characteristics of
[1:58:18] something right now
[1:58:20] he's talking about
[1:58:22] animal life
[1:58:24] and his first time a reason to talk
[1:58:25] about
[1:58:26] a sheep and a deer
[1:58:28] they look similar and they got some of
[1:58:31] the same characteristics
[1:58:32] but we're gonna pull some things out of
[1:58:34] here for broad material
[1:58:36] all right listen he says now if you
[1:58:38] didn't know the difference when you was
[1:58:41] tracking a sheep or a deer now he's
[1:58:44] talking about hunting and he's and he's
[1:58:46] hunting for something he said you didn't
[1:58:48] know the difference in tracking a sheep
[1:58:49] or a deer you couldn't tell the
[1:58:51] difference less you was a shrewd Hunter
[1:58:55] see well again what I'm gonna deal with
[1:58:57] tonight what separates the hunter
[1:58:59] experience
[1:59:02] why
[1:59:03] he said because they make the same kind
[1:59:06] of tracks
[1:59:09] there are churches got the same tracks
[1:59:12] you got right
[1:59:14] they listening to the same message you
[1:59:16] listening to they praying to the same
[1:59:18] God you praying
[1:59:20] amen got some of the same tracks
[1:59:24] they bow when they run away
[1:59:28] and and then you see one standing at a
[1:59:32] distance with his head head why you
[1:59:36] would hardly know the difference
[1:59:38] they operate under some of the same
[1:59:41] humility
[1:59:42] you do
[1:59:44] come on looks like the same bow
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:48] look you ever seen somebody in the store
[1:59:51] uh a sister that dressed got a long
[1:59:54] skirt you can immediately identify that
[1:59:56] some kind of Christ somewhere in there
[1:59:59] right because of how she's dressed
[2:00:04] and you have a little confidence in
[2:00:06] approaching a Why by what you see
[2:00:11] oh my
[2:00:12] God but that ain't it remember it's a
[2:00:14] collective of things
[2:00:16] listen
[2:00:17] he says
[2:00:19] they're about the same size
[2:00:21] across the wrong part
[2:00:24] it's white just like the deer it'll be
[2:00:27] very hard to tell them listen to this
[2:00:29] but his horns identify as
[2:00:32] characteristics
[2:00:34] and horns type out the pouring of the
[2:00:37] anointing
[2:00:40] and it's the horns of a sheep and a deer
[2:00:43] that tells what is what
[2:00:46] now if you go in the word you look in
[2:00:48] the Bible Hallelujah Saul and David had
[2:00:51] the same Horn of oil poured on them by
[2:00:55] the same prophet
[2:00:57] so what made Saul any different from
[2:01:00] David or David any different from Saul
[2:01:04] being able to commit to the anointing in
[2:01:07] their life
[2:01:11] Saul was just as anointed as David was
[2:01:16] but what Saul can do Saul couldn't
[2:01:19] self-reflect under that anointing
[2:01:22] but David could
[2:01:24] when Saul made mistake it was the people
[2:01:28] it was just it was the witchy Angel he
[2:01:30] was just he was dead it was everything
[2:01:31] it was everybody else but Saul
[2:01:34] right when God said go down there kill
[2:01:36] hey gag kill all the Hamlet guys so I
[2:01:39] heard the word went out to do it and got
[2:01:42] distracted
[2:01:44] see the real anointing of God the
[2:01:46] prophet God said what is the anointing
[2:01:48] supreme power under control
[2:01:51] knowing how and what
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:55] so it's the anointing in your life that
[2:01:59] separates you Hallelujah from any other
[2:02:02] kind of church
[2:02:04] you being able to surrender under that
[2:02:06] anointing and I'm not talking about just
[2:02:08] good singing
[2:02:10] amen because they'll blowout doors off
[2:02:14] everybody
[2:02:22] but they were getting down
[2:02:25] and one of my favorite songs they saying
[2:02:27] turn it around turn turn Taffy little
[2:02:30] Taylor out her turn it around and they'd
[2:02:33] be saying that song but
[2:02:36] but what separates different singing it
[2:02:39] and me singing it Hallelujah is that me
[2:02:42] Hallelujah I'm not singing it under a
[2:02:44] homosexual anointing
[2:02:46] [Applause]
[2:02:51] y'all don't have a homosexual leading to
[2:02:53] worship
[2:02:54] you got a man of God
[2:02:56] you got a man who knows who he is
[2:02:59] so when he's saying that song there's a
[2:03:01] certain characteristic following it or
[2:03:03] characteristics of Deliverance
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:11] yeah I'll sing their song but I'll sing
[2:03:14] it under a different anointing
[2:03:17] not the same anointing
[2:03:22] and you know them people I heard that
[2:03:23] song writing in the blue book and this
[2:03:25] and that man please this light like that
[2:03:28] like they said this 20 20.
[2:03:31] got time to be arguing with you about
[2:03:33] who wrote the song
[2:03:35] whoever wrote it I'm singing it now
[2:03:38] and I'm singing it under the anointing
[2:03:40] of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:44] [Applause]
[2:03:45] no Shadow you won't light up
[2:03:49] Hallelujah
[2:03:53] what is that anointing and God tells him
[2:03:56] specifically what to do he's hearing
[2:03:59] directly from a prophet and he knew that
[2:04:01] Prophet had the voice of God coming
[2:04:04] through
[2:04:05] Saul could hear it and not respect it
[2:04:11] and you know we're in that day well I
[2:04:13] don't think brother Brown meant that I
[2:04:15] don't think brother Brown I mean I don't
[2:04:16] think but what about what your spirits
[2:04:18] say inside
[2:04:20] the Holy Ghost Inside will agree with
[2:04:23] truth
[2:04:24] bring that praise God hallelujah and if
[2:04:28] it's God hallelujah it won't pull you
[2:04:30] into a sinful characteristic
[2:04:33] oh the Bible say when you're being drawn
[2:04:35] away you're being drawn away by your own
[2:04:38] lust

[2:06:26] side at when you walk through the door
[2:06:30] where you been at
[2:06:32] oh you're back in church now
[2:06:37] you've been out the country

[2:06:43] as you can see ain't no covet in here
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:47] only thing in here is Jesus
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:52] people still using that iron Cove at
[2:06:55] this and I just got to be aware protect
[2:06:57] yourself I thought it was the blood
[2:06:59] protecting us
[2:07:00] [Applause]
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:07] but look so everybody all right
[2:07:13] so
[2:07:15] he wouldn't allow himself to
[2:07:17] self-reflect under that anointing
[2:07:20] but when David did wrong
[2:07:22] and things happen in David life
[2:07:24] like we were saying the other night
[2:07:26] about Bathsheba and what David did and
[2:07:28] God allowed all that to rise up if David
[2:07:31] had premeditated murder inside of him
[2:07:33] that wasn't a part of God
[2:07:35] characteristics so what God began to do
[2:07:37] was beat that goal
[2:07:39] wow God began to beat that goal David
[2:07:42] had lying inside him God started to beat
[2:07:44] that goal David had sneaky things inside
[2:07:46] God began to beat that goal all that
[2:07:49] came out of one trial
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:54] and he was a King David
[2:07:58] let's let's take let's go in a little
[2:08:00] bit deeper with it the Bible says he was
[2:08:03] a man after God's very own heart
[2:08:07] he thought like God thought he felt what
[2:08:10] God felt
[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:13] oh
[2:08:17] but he had to go through something to
[2:08:20] get the real characteristics of God to
[2:08:22] be pure so God let him go through
[2:08:25] something to get all that filth out of
[2:08:27] him Hallelujah all that lying
[2:08:29] premeditated murder cheating and
[2:08:31] scheming and all that stuff get it all
[2:08:33] out
[2:08:34] and then God hallelujah you know one
[2:08:36] thing about self-reflection what helps
[2:08:38] you to self-reflect the hearing of the
[2:08:41] word
[2:08:44] because Saul heard the word from a
[2:08:47] prophet and couldn't self-reflect But
[2:08:49] Here Comes The Prophet Hallelujah
[2:08:51] talking to David the same one who poured
[2:08:54] the oil the same anointing
[2:08:57] and now David Hallelujah Nathan is
[2:08:59] telling me say look because there was a
[2:09:01] man who had one Sheba the other one had
[2:09:03] a hundred and this and that on and on
[2:09:04] y'all know the story
[2:09:06] and what I love about it Hallelujah God
[2:09:08] by the time he finish with David he said
[2:09:10] hey you you know how we operate if you
[2:09:13] wanted another one all you had to do was
[2:09:15] ask
[2:09:16] you don't have to be Shady you don't
[2:09:18] have to be hating on the next brother or
[2:09:20] sister because God blessing Hallelujah
[2:09:22] all you got to do is ask
[2:09:25] tell y'all don't hate on me when y'all
[2:09:27] see me riding around in my Maserati
[2:09:29] [Applause]
[2:09:34] well he ain't a manager he's well I
[2:09:37] ain't supposed to be blessed
[2:09:40] your faith might be on the Corolla level
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:45] ain't nothing wrong with that if that's
[2:09:47] where your faith that you operate in it
[2:09:49] Hallelujah but my Faith's gonna turn
[2:09:51] heads
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:53] [Applause]
[2:09:59] Hallelujah
[2:10:00] hooray
[2:10:02] our faith should change the world
[2:10:06] but look when Nathan comes he says all
[2:10:07] this stuff David says I'ma kill him
[2:10:10] whoever he is I'm gonna kill him
[2:10:13] and like yeah David you need to
[2:10:14] kill yourself
[2:10:16] because I'm talking about you
[2:10:18] and David didn't even recognize what he
[2:10:20] was doing to the word beginning to show
[2:10:23] him
[2:10:24] what was happening
[2:10:27] and then he could self-reflect and David
[2:10:29] the first thing David said Lord I have
[2:10:31] seen
[2:10:32] he didn't blame it on he didn't even
[2:10:34] blame it on Bathsheba
[2:10:37] when the prophet said she knew he'd come
[2:10:39] out there a certain time and she come
[2:10:41] out there and do it on purpose
[2:10:46] what
[2:10:48] Oh my he didn't blame it on best she we
[2:10:50] didn't blame it on nobody he said Lord I
[2:10:52] have seen
[2:10:53] I did this
[2:10:55] and right then and then he received
[2:10:57] Mercy when you confess your sins the
[2:10:59] next thing for you to receive is Mercy
[2:11:02] Hallelujah
[2:11:03] amen because there's always a warning
[2:11:05] before judgment
[2:11:07] and now David receives Mercy why because
[2:11:09] he was able to self-reflect under the
[2:11:11] anointing
[2:11:12] that's bright material
[2:11:16] he says but the horns identify the
[2:11:19] characteristics but them by them horns
[2:11:22] the anointing the Sheep has the horns
[2:11:25] that's round Hallelujah see Church the
[2:11:28] anointing in this bride Hallelujah is
[2:11:31] well-rounded
[2:11:32] amen I mean one time Jack preached a
[2:11:35] message he was preaching about being
[2:11:36] sober Christians
[2:11:38] let's be sober don't be joking about all
[2:11:40] the Miracles and all let's be sober
[2:11:43] all right let's understand what we have
[2:11:45] and do not have
[2:11:47] right let's be sober Hallelujah see he
[2:11:50] says his Horn's around he said and a
[2:11:53] deer has prongs that run out see they
[2:11:55] run out here I am I want to be seen look
[2:11:58] at my anointing
[2:12:00] it's time for me to sing a special
[2:12:04] I'm the same expression giving us more
[2:12:07] than what we want
[2:12:15] and other things a deer wouldn't go
[2:12:18] quite that high to feed
[2:12:21] you hear that a deer won't go that high
[2:12:25] to feed but a sheep will go to the
[2:12:28] highest Heist to feed on their words
[2:12:32] deer be like I'm good as long as I'm
[2:12:34] able to make it to church on time I'm
[2:12:35] good I don't you know I don't want to
[2:12:37] get emotional I ain't no need to say
[2:12:39] hallelujah I believe we got the word
[2:12:42] foreign
[2:12:46] okay let's keep going
[2:12:48] he said and then the goat
[2:12:51] walking also there is a characteristics
[2:12:54] in a goat and a sheep see it went from
[2:12:56] sheep to Deer now to sheep to Gold it
[2:13:00] went from Deer Hallelujah which is a
[2:13:03] make-believer
[2:13:05] now it's going to Goat which is a
[2:13:07] unbeliever but they're both being
[2:13:09] compared to a sheep which is a True
[2:13:13] Believer
[2:13:14] but you can see some of the same
[2:13:17] characteristics in that sheep that's in
[2:13:19] that deer and in that gold
[2:13:23] some of the same material
[2:13:25] but listen
[2:13:26] he says
[2:13:28] and then the goat walking also there is
[2:13:30] a characteristic goat and a sheep that
[2:13:33] you would have to know the difference in
[2:13:35] them when you are up high
[2:13:39] so I don't know about you but Jack bro
[2:13:41] smiley but you can tell when people got
[2:13:43] spirits on them when the anointing fall
[2:13:46] down and God started to deliver and did
[2:13:49] and deal with people and and want to
[2:13:51] bring them into something High they're
[2:13:52] gonna take a water break
[2:13:55] time to go feed the baby
[2:13:58] got to get out of that presence
[2:14:00] well he said you identify you tell the
[2:14:03] difference how by its walk right
[2:14:11] but it's like by its walk right now
[2:14:14] Hallelujah the characteristics of this
[2:14:16] bride is showing her walk I don't know
[2:14:19] about you amen I can go to the beach but
[2:14:21] I can't go naked
[2:14:23] what's up
[2:14:25] my walk won't allow me to do it
[2:14:28] I can go to a restaurant with a bar
[2:14:30] Hallelujah but I can't drink why because
[2:14:33] that ain't a part of my walk
[2:14:35] my walk is different you know some
[2:14:38] people say well ain't nothing but a
[2:14:39] little casual wine High Castle you got
[2:14:41] to get
[2:14:46] it cause when we was younger we had a
[2:14:48] wine called MD
[2:14:53] and drinking that way I will make you
[2:14:56] lose your mind
[2:15:00] praise God
[2:15:02] Mad Dog
[2:15:06] think about the church why would you
[2:15:07] drink something called Mad Dog
[2:15:11] it's telling you what it's gonna do to
[2:15:14] you
[2:15:15] the person who made it they were
[2:15:17] inspired by the name they call it Mad
[2:15:20] Dog
[2:15:21] and as they get drunk over that wine
[2:15:23] they turn into a Mad Dog
[2:15:25] ready to fight everything ready to cuss
[2:15:28] everything ready to do all that while it
[2:15:30] was the walk that identified it he said
[2:15:33] but hurry the Sheep came to go can't go
[2:15:36] as high as the Sheep he said because
[2:15:37] they both dwell in high mountains he
[2:15:40] said you know the difference but if you
[2:15:42] notice a goat stumbles himself as he
[2:15:45] walks
[2:15:47] all right
[2:15:50] look at the look at it look at the
[2:15:52] wording good
[2:15:53] dumbled himself
[2:15:57] it's something he's doing
[2:16:01] he wasn't tricked it's something he's
[2:16:05] doing stumbles himself by the things he
[2:16:09] desires
[2:16:16] and normally when somebody stumbles they
[2:16:18] get back up
[2:16:20] stumble and get back up
[2:16:22] stumble and get back up but that sheep
[2:16:25] hallelujah look at it
[2:16:28] he said he stumbles himself as he walks
[2:16:30] where a sheep
[2:16:31] sets his feet down like this as he walks
[2:16:35] so what that sheep does he pays
[2:16:37] attention to where he's stepping
[2:16:41] he sets himself Hallelujah before he
[2:16:44] goes and makes a step Hallelujah because
[2:16:46] he doesn't want to stumble himself
[2:16:50] right
[2:16:52] right yes you see the characteristics
[2:16:54] see the characteristics that makes up a
[2:16:56] bride Hallelujah before they do anything
[2:16:58] they pray about it
[2:17:00] because they don't want to stumble
[2:17:02] themselves they don't just follow their
[2:17:04] hearts
[2:17:06] you got people say well I'm following my
[2:17:08] heart the Bible say the heart is wicked
[2:17:10] and deceitful Above All Things who can
[2:17:12] trust it
[2:17:13] you just follow your heart you go
[2:17:16] stumble yourself
[2:17:17] [Applause]
[2:17:20] that's exactly right but that's sheep
[2:17:22] Hallelujah he sets his feet he prays
[2:17:25] about it he gets under Hallelujah a
[2:17:27] channel where you can hear from God and
[2:17:29] when he makes a step he steps in
[2:17:31] confidence amen
[2:17:34] those are the characteristics
[2:17:37] of bright material
[2:17:39] let's keep going
[2:17:42] he said he sets his feet down like this
[2:17:44] and he walks the characteristics the way
[2:17:47] he makes his tracks
[2:17:49] even the way he steps hardly as he steps
[2:17:52] and steps and steps the holy the tracker
[2:17:55] can look and say that's a sheep
[2:17:59] by the trail he's leaving behind
[2:18:02] and your testimony honey the life you
[2:18:05] live will tell us whether you're a
[2:18:07] Believer or Not by the tracks you make
[2:18:12] yeah
[2:18:14] think about it
[2:18:16] yeah I'm just being honest I know some
[2:18:19] people who consider to be Believers and
[2:18:21] I've asked you know do you know
[2:18:22] so-and-so like that man please
[2:18:26] [Music]
[2:18:31] because of the tracks they've made
[2:18:34] the life they live
[2:18:36] I want all of us to examine Hallelujah
[2:18:39] our name our our characteristics who we
[2:18:43] are when we're not in one another's
[2:18:45] presence what they'll say about you

[2:22:24] and like I told him I said one thing
[2:22:26] about Gino Gino gonna bring you back to
[2:22:28] the to the scriptures and you're gonna
[2:22:30] say the Bible says the Bible says that
[2:22:31] the Bible says that but at the same time
[2:22:33] he doesn't have the understanding we
[2:22:35] have
[2:22:37] but I can appreciate him for the for
[2:22:39] what he's trying to do Hallelujah get
[2:22:41] people to Christ but then again what I'm
[2:22:44] gonna talk about tonight there's another
[2:22:46] level
[2:22:50] there's another level than being able to
[2:22:52] compare verse with verse
[2:22:55] Hallelujah it takes the problem the the
[2:22:58] property the church he's saying it takes
[2:23:00] a special person
[2:23:03] we're not just comparing verse to verse
[2:23:05] for the sake of an argument
[2:23:07] exactly hallelujah what he feeds and
[2:23:10] everything it identifies Itself by the
[2:23:12] characteristics and this is what I love
[2:23:14] he's saying and then you jump one
[2:23:20] you know what he's saying you put a deer
[2:23:23] I mean you put a goat and you put a
[2:23:25] sheep you got both of them standing
[2:23:27] there you walk up on them
[2:23:29] you jump at one
[2:23:31] and the characteristics that tell you
[2:23:33] what it is
[2:23:34] that sheep just gonna stand there and
[2:23:36] look at you
[2:23:38] but that goat gonna put his head down
[2:23:40] and he gonna charge you
[2:23:49] Hallelujah
[2:23:51] why because he know he got something on
[2:23:52] his head
[2:23:55] he got something on his head that could
[2:23:57] hurt you
[2:23:58] we're not using the revelation of this
[2:24:00] hour to hurt people
[2:24:02] that's not the characteristics of a
[2:24:04] sheep
[2:24:04] [Applause]
[2:24:06] I'd like to see but I just stand there
[2:24:08] and look at you how you doing crazy
[2:24:10] stuff
[2:24:13] hallelujah
[2:24:14] hallelujah but that goal even people who
[2:24:18] got ghosts as pets
[2:24:20] they trying to go on YouTube they turn
[2:24:22] around and they be like stop stop you
[2:24:25] back on up
[2:24:30] they'd be like Julie don't do it Judy
[2:24:33] don't Judy
[2:24:39] hey let me tell you something he don't
[2:24:41] be playing
[2:24:42] is in his nature of the book
[2:24:48] and he didn't mutant fan and you didn't
[2:24:50] gave it food you didn't put it in a nice
[2:24:52] house a barn put a put a shelter over
[2:24:54] his head and it'll still turn his back
[2:24:57] on you
[2:24:58] that's like people come into church Jack
[2:25:00] you feed them you give them good word
[2:25:02] good atmosphere we worship and saying
[2:25:05] and when something happened they still
[2:25:07] talk bad about spirit and Truth
[2:25:09] all right all right all right
[2:25:11] wow a bunch of goats
[2:25:15] yeah
[2:25:18] and let me say this I ain't no better
[2:25:20] than nobody
[2:25:22] I got my own issues I go through I'm
[2:25:24] preaching by experience
[2:25:27] Hallelujah and you know sometimes you go
[2:25:30] through things you think you gotta write
[2:25:33] to do what you're doing
[2:25:34] I don't feel like I don't feel like
[2:25:37] singing I don't feel like worse I don't
[2:25:38] feel like nothing
[2:25:40] I remember one time I was going through
[2:25:41] something I was getting depressed and
[2:25:43] you know what happened I stopped
[2:25:44] dressing up coming to church start
[2:25:46] wearing jeans and Jordans
[2:25:48] sitting in the back of the church
[2:25:50] and a brother
[2:25:51] he started noticing me
[2:25:54] he went on vacation he was on vacation
[2:25:55] he called me he said give me a call when
[2:25:58] you uh you get this message and I can
[2:26:01] honestly say me and him we don't call
[2:26:03] each other and talk all the time we go
[2:26:04] to the same church we respect each other
[2:26:06] this and that praise God this and that
[2:26:07] but we not always on the phone hollering
[2:26:09] and talking to each other but he started
[2:26:11] to see something
[2:26:13] Hallelujah and out of love how do he
[2:26:15] call me hey I know you you might be
[2:26:18] going through something he said but you
[2:26:19] know ain't my business Ain't Nobody
[2:26:20] Business he said but let me tell you
[2:26:22] something though he said I saw you
[2:26:24] sitting in the back of the church and I
[2:26:25] thought to myself that is not brother
[2:26:26] Diggs
[2:26:30] and the next thing that came out of his
[2:26:31] mouth he said hey don't let the devil
[2:26:33] steal your joy
[2:26:39] that's right that's what happened
[2:26:41] Hallelujah people leave God leave church
[2:26:44] because they lose their Joy David said
[2:26:47] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[2:26:50] in the midst of his child
[2:26:54] because once you lose the joy of a thing
[2:26:57] it's easy to step away from it
[2:27:04] a preacher can't preach if there ain't
[2:27:06] no joy in it
[2:27:09] a singer can't sing if it ain't no joy
[2:27:12] in it
[2:27:13] there has to be some Joy
[2:27:17] and you know when he said that it was
[2:27:19] like
[2:27:21] a check yeah you know it's like the
[2:27:24] green light came on
[2:27:25] you're like hold up bro
[2:27:29] all them clothes you got and you wearing
[2:27:31] jeans to church
[2:27:32] you enjoy the church
[2:27:35] that next service
[2:27:36] yo I put on a three piece
[2:27:41] come on brother I put on a three-piece
[2:27:43] hat that hanky had the cufflinks had to
[2:27:46] tie everything and I boss up in there
[2:27:47] like a son of God
[2:27:49] [Applause]
[2:27:53] I found somebody like a Son of God I was
[2:27:56] walking but it was looking like I was
[2:27:57] doing the moonwalk and I walk up in
[2:27:59] there
[2:28:01] let the devil know I'm back in position
[2:28:05] and I sing and worship like I never sang
[2:28:08] and worship before holy cake is a word
[2:28:12] to restore
[2:28:14] and bring out those characteristics
[2:28:16] that's already there
[2:28:19] Hallelujah yeah we get discouraged
[2:28:22] sometimes yeah we get upset we get angry
[2:28:24] but can you self-reflect
[2:28:27] those are the characteristics of the
[2:28:29] Bride
[2:28:30] can you self-reflect
[2:28:33] he said indeed you jump one and watch
[2:28:35] what happens you can tell the way they
[2:28:37] go you can tell by the characteristics
[2:28:40] of different animals
[2:28:44] so Church
[2:28:49] there's more things we can say but I
[2:28:50] think you get it
[2:28:53] when we're talking about bride's
[2:28:54] material
[2:28:55] remember there's a collection of things
[2:28:58] that make up Who You Are
[2:29:01] so just make sure you got your ducks in
[2:29:03] a row
[2:29:04] and and I ain't talking about your own
[2:29:07] checklist
[2:29:08] I'm talking about your self-reflection
[2:29:12] y'all know what I do there's times where
[2:29:13] I get along with God and I begin to
[2:29:16] inquire of him what he have for me
[2:29:19] not what I have what he have for me
[2:29:23] and I begin to inquire of him and I lay
[2:29:25] before him and I wait until it's made
[2:29:27] clear
[2:29:28] right now I don't know about y'all but
[2:29:29] I've seen him do it I've been in service

[2:43:14] [Music]
[2:43:24] you know I was just thinking to myself
[2:43:27] as he was preaching the same man he is
[2:43:29] one of a kind
[2:43:31] [Music]
[2:43:32] of a Kind a ain't nobody like brother
[2:43:36] Diggs just uh just the way God made him
[2:43:39] and I love just the maturity there he
[2:43:42] was talking about how somebody uh
[2:43:44] criticized them for exciting the people
[2:43:48] you know and and I have to say this it's
[2:43:50] evident that whoever wrote that didn't
[2:43:53] know brother Diggs and what I mean by
[2:43:56] that they don't know his story
[2:43:59] amen and see when you don't know my
[2:44:02] story you don't understand why I act the
[2:44:04] way I act and why I do the things I do
[2:44:07] you don't know my story
[2:44:10] right and and I mean a man that was uh
[2:44:14] uh pretty much on his deathbed you know
[2:44:18] and having to go through a cancer
[2:44:20] surgery at a very very young age
[2:44:22] God bring him out of that you know and
[2:44:25] um
[2:44:26] I mean you got something to be excited
[2:44:29] about I'm a man that's been chained from
[2:44:32] Death to life right and you know and
[2:44:34] other things that you know we have seen
[2:44:37] just throughout the years I remember
[2:44:39] brother Diggs coming here a blind man
[2:44:44] came to Okeechobee to preach it was a
[2:44:46] blind preacher coming Okeechobee and uh
[2:44:50] when he came you know he could not see
[2:44:53] uh the only time his eyes was open is
[2:44:56] when he'd open up his Bible and he read
[2:44:59] his text and he start preaching but soon
[2:45:01] as he closed the Bible the eyes would
[2:45:02] close again and uh he went to Golden
[2:45:05] Corral
[2:45:07] praise the Lord and he need a little
[2:45:09] help to get some food and bro smiling I
[2:45:13] just told him to say look man if you
[2:45:14] want some food you have to go go up
[2:45:15] there and get it yourself because I
[2:45:17] ain't got time to be feeding myself then
[2:45:19] trying to feed you to your grown man you
[2:45:21] have to get up and go eat get it
[2:45:23] yourself brother dick say okay if that's
[2:45:25] the way it is I'm going to get it myself
[2:45:27] and from that day God healed them
[2:45:30] and he's never been the same sex
[2:45:34] and you're gonna tell this man not to
[2:45:36] get excited
[2:45:38] [Music]
[2:45:39] when God do something like that for you
[2:45:42] I guarantee you'll get excited too
[2:45:44] praise the Lord
[2:45:46] amen
[2:45:49] but the maturity to be able to respond
[2:45:51] to a person like that and say look uh
[2:45:53] you know who would want just a dead man
[2:45:55] talking to him
[2:45:58] oh yes of course I I need to have some
[2:46:01] excitement and and some join what I'm
[2:46:03] doing then I can present that to the
[2:46:04] people and they get excited about it you
[2:46:07] know uh I I look at the church today and
[2:46:10] I got my little my little niece here and
[2:46:13] and I when I when I announced and told
[2:46:16] them that brother Duke's going to be
[2:46:17] here how old are you Kennedy
[2:46:20] nine nine years old and um mama told us
[2:46:25] and the brother D's going to be there in
[2:46:26] a certain such a weekend and my niece
[2:46:29] has to kind of coordinate her schedule a
[2:46:33] certain way so she can be in church and
[2:46:37] she went and coordinated all the
[2:46:39] different people she I'm I'm talking
[2:46:41] about a lot of coordination and I ain't
[2:46:44] gonna be able to be here this weekend I
[2:46:46] can't do this at nine years old she got
[2:46:48] this thing all mapped up Church on
[2:46:50] Friday night church on on Sunday morning
[2:46:52] I need to be there and I know you know
[2:46:55] Saint Saints I want to come and you know
[2:46:57] hear the word of God and we appreciate
[2:46:58] that but like he told us today streaming
[2:47:01] is different
[2:47:04] I don't stream but I know what I'm
[2:47:06] talking about and for me I mean when
[2:47:08] I've been I've actually tested positive
[2:47:12] for covet I did
[2:47:14] amen I tested positive and I did the
[2:47:17] right thing by not coming to get
[2:47:18] everybody sick I did the right thing see
[2:47:20] but when I was home streaming I was
[2:47:22] having a very hard time
[2:47:25] I can't wait to get back into the house
[2:47:28] of God and if you're a streamer you
[2:47:31] ought to feel the same way I can't wait
[2:47:32] to get in the house of God it's
[2:47:34] something about people telling you about
[2:47:36] what happened then you experiencing
[2:47:38] yourself I don't want you to tell me
[2:47:40] what happened I want to be there to
[2:47:42] experience it myself
[2:47:44] so I tell you come on down the church
[2:47:46] doors are open
[2:47:48] amen the doors of the church
[2:47:52] are open come on to the house of God and
[2:47:56] like I say streaming got popular through
[2:47:59] fear
[2:48:01] fear did it we don't want to be
[2:48:04] operating like that and then I'm not
[2:48:06] saying I'm gonna be the covet is real
[2:48:09] covet is real
[2:48:11] that's something I think people don't
[2:48:13] create it
[2:48:14] but it's real people get sick from it
[2:48:16] they do they do but I tell you what God
[2:48:19] is still a Healer
[2:48:21] he's a deliverer
[2:48:22] and uh you don't have to be afraid of it
[2:48:25] don't don't be walking around being in
[2:48:27] fear don't God and gave you the spirit
[2:48:29] of fear so much it was saying here today
[2:48:31] even though and don't use words like my
[2:48:34] anxiety
[2:48:38] I I've been I've been waiting on the
[2:48:40] Lord for a sermon and I'm going to
[2:48:42] preach on that because it just seems to
[2:48:44] be so
[2:48:45] accepted but I want y'all to watch
[2:48:47] something just something that I've been
[2:48:49] watching
[2:48:50] um the generation that came in unto us
[2:48:53] that generation is going through a lot
[2:48:56] of anxiety and and mental issues they're
[2:49:00] they're they're and and they many of
[2:49:03] them talk about going through these
[2:49:04] mental things and uh it's a spirit don't
[2:49:06] forget that every sickness is a spirit
[2:49:09] no matter what medicine they can give
[2:49:12] you to try to help you steal a spirit if
[2:49:14] diabetes is a spirit cancer is a spirit
[2:49:17] right high blood pressure a spirit all
[2:49:20] these things are spirits and brother
[2:49:22] Brandon went to a deeper level at these
[2:49:24] things not just through science and
[2:49:25] medicine but he found he went to the
[2:49:27] root of it the spirit right and uh you
[2:49:29] know so a lot of a lot of a lot of young
[2:49:31] people you know and and really realize
[2:49:34] now the scripture actually say that we
[2:49:36] would be weaker
[2:49:38] foreign
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:49] that seems to be going through a lot of
[2:49:51] the uh
[2:49:54] depression and uh just a lot of mental
[2:49:57] things that they go through it's a real
[2:49:59] thing I'm not trying to belittle it in
[2:50:01] any way it's a real thing
[2:50:03] watch the Next Generation that's coming
[2:50:05] behind them
[2:50:06] and if you know if you don't notice in
[2:50:09] the Next Generation coming home we have
[2:50:10] a lot of children in the Next Generation
[2:50:12] that are fighting autism
[2:50:15] that's another spirit
[2:50:18] and now if that generation lives and has
[2:50:21] children what will they with what will
[2:50:24] their children be fighting
[2:50:26] we got to break this Spirit now and one
[2:50:29] of them is that not not claiming things
