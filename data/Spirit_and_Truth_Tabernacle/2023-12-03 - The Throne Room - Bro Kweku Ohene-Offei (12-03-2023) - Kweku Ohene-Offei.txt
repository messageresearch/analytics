Port St Lucy and my brother Smiley did a wonderful job amen there um with the [Applause] Saints and uh I I didn't realize that the service was starting at 6:30 but I knew knew that we had to come and and get um this Sanctuary set up uh before we could go and and um I said I'm going be late but you know I'm going to press my way uh anyway there and and by the time we got there uh come to find out that a lot of people got lost and uh so they I don't know if they started late but they didn't the preacher wasn't preaching yet so I made it in time so you know we were we were happy to be there and just be support of Amen of brother Smiley and uh just a wonderful wonderful uh thought he just kind of carried from last Sunday amen and um you know walking undisturbed and uh you know he talked about the storms and everything that come and I mean right after the mighty Revival then all of a sudden this big storm comes and hits you but you have to learn how to walk undisturbed amen so you know I was just I was just appreciative to that of that and then yesterday morning we went to to uh Sarasota for the services there and uh you know brother Jonathan Martin preaching on rapturing Grace amen it was a wonderful wonderful sermon wonderful uh Fellowship amen afterwards and we just we just had a wonderful time there uh with the Believers Amen in in Sarasota and they all sent their greetings amen back to you uh so uh we we thank the Lord for that but we back here this morning amen for one more round amen we we thank the Lord we thank the Lord for brother Mark on Wednesday night amen just did a excellent job Amen on yielding resting uh just uh thought it was just a wonderful sermon so many nuggets that you can just draw from there uh we were all strengthened and encouraged by uh the word of the Lord amen um a couple things that I I want to make mention of to you really quickly uh I think I need to do the announcements but um two things um as a church y'all saw brother Gwenna come here um couple weeks ago and uh we just have this kind of uh relationship where uh you know uh if he's passing through the states like he was and if he just happen to be anywhere in Florida we're going to have to pull on him to get him amen and uh but anytime he comes then the door starts swinging open on the other side and uh so he mentioned to me that brother Jack we'd love to have you all for Easter Amen in 2024 so uh we as a church have been invited Amen to go to London for Easter uh next year amen so uh if you desire to go um you know we'll all have to just kind of discuss and see you know what what's the the proper plan uh but uh we'll get it all worked out amen because you know some will still be here here for service but some others may want to go so uh we want to try to work um together make sure that we don't create a burden for the ministry over there so let's let's work together on that if you desire to go um other thing I just need to mention uh to you um this morning uh I got a telephone call and um we have been hit with a a wind amen uh our sister Sharda has G on to be with the Lord amen and just something that just happened so unexpectedly and um uh

Siana up in casmi and uh I'll be going to just visit with the family and everything but we want to pray amen for them a tremendous tremendous shock amen a wi but we have to learn how to walk undisturbed amen undisturbed so um uh but we want to pray for uh this family so let's just bow uh our head father we come in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus um God just to hear this about our sister Lord it it's quite shocking uh and but we know that you are the master of the wind and the master of the waves and Lord everything that comes you already know about it so we are trusting that you would give strength to this family a husband some uh two daughters some grandchildren God and Lord even as she has taking in sister Melissa and uh and her children Lord just to try to be a strength to them through some of the Lord just knowing that they needed uh somebody like her father they are all Lord just really dealing with a lot right now and I I pray your comfort I pray your strength I pray Lord that you would just help them Father through this time certainly this is a time we look down in the the foot Prince on the sands of time and we only see that one set of Prince but God we realize amen that this is the time that you carry carry them carry us oh God you know all what we feel and what Lord what this means to us but God we know that you'll bring us through we seen you do it before we know you'll do it again so Lord we ask that you would en en engage and Lord that you would help this family at this moment we uh commit them into your hands it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord amen when when when when they call me um I I I prayed and I asked God to bring her back amen I said if this is the devil if this is the devil we going to call for

with the PowerPoint slides the Lord is good so let's go to um let's go to act 8: 26-40 act 8 26-40 if you can be on our feet to read the word of the Lord that will be pleasant the book of Acts chapter 8 verse 26- 40 26 and the angel of the Lord's speak unto philli saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem onto Gaza which is Desert and he arose and went and beheld a man of Ethiopia and unoch of great Authority and Candis Queen of the Ethiopians who had a who had a charge of all her treas treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his Chariot reading ASAS the prophet which is Isaiah the prophet then the spirit of the then the spirit said unto Phillip go near and join thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran thether to him and heard him read the prophet ASAS and said understanded thou what thou readest 31 and he said how can I except some man should guide me always there needs of a guide and the guide is the ministry the Lord has provided and he desired Philip that he will come up and sit with him him the place of the scripture where which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamp damped before his Sherer so openeth he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the unoch asked Phillip and and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or of some other men then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preach unto him Jesus amen what we have to preach is Jesus though he was reading the book of Isaiah he didn't preach Isaiah to him he preached Jesus Christ though we read William Brown message We Don't Preach William Braham but we preach Jesus Christ to the heart of your people 36 and as they went on their way they came onto a certain water and the unoch asked see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart that's a pray requisite you don't have to be nothing but if you can believe with all of your heart you don't have to be a righteous person you can be a sinner but if you can believe the Lord Jesus Christ with all of your heart you can be baptized amen and baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is baptism in the nature of Jesus Christ name is a nature it's not just the name Jes Jus all right but said that I have a lot of Hispanic friend who called Jesus Jesus so the name Jesus people are called Jesus but there's a nature in that particular name Jesus that's the nature of omnipotent right so he said and Philip said if thou believe if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and unoch and he baptized him and when they were come out of the water the spirit of the Lord called away Philip that the Enoch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing but Philip was found in aatos and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to cesaria God bless you may take our seat glory to the Lord in the highest of Heaven amen hallu so the first slide we want to look at the throne room and how it pertains to our our lives so we want to kind of give a picture of what is a throne right so Throne is in certain dictionaries said it's a chamber usually containing a throne second slide please used by Sovereign Sovereign for audience the location of actual power or authority as in the particular government or business organization another definition says impressive a throne is an impressive setting for a monarch to precise side in Majesty over official ceremonies to hold Council to Grant audience to receive homage to award High Hest and offices and to perform other official functions so that is a throne but then we are not looking at monarchs and government but we want to look at another Throne which is established in the heart of men right and we just only want to use a natural Throne to set a foundation for what we want to talk about right us has a uh the the president has Air Force One I think we all know about Air Force One Air Force One is termed as a moving over office flying over office the president can do many things is so equipped president has got high speed internet he can have conferences in fact they have a live Kitchen in Air Force One they don't store frozen food but they have H chefs and Cooks who cook life two big kitchens and they cook live meal and one thing I learn about Air Force One is that Air Force One is not Air Force One until the president sit in fos one if politicians have this Revelation that fos one is not regardless of its sophistication and Splendor is not really EOS one but the moment the president set in the Eos one then it becomes EOS one how about you and I your heart is a throne but your throne is not a throne unto the Lord Jesus Christ sit in the heart of your throne Glory hallelujah amen amen the Lord is good glory praise the Lord amen the Lord is good so that is efor one and that is God we've got a better efor one amen you are the OS one you are the moving mobile feet of the Lord Jesus Christ amen OS one has got limitation is God is so powerful they said they can fuel it even in midair I don't know how they do it and it was I read one document said that when President um what's the name Kennedy was assassinated Lyndon Johnson I think the vice president was swanning in Air Force One when they were taking the body of Kennedy to I think Dallas in front of his wife jacn Kennedy so even EOS one can swear in a new president in emergency situation in your heart when there's an emergency sometime you don't have to pray come on because the throne is in Your Heart Right the King of Kings is your heart Hallelujah greater than the president of United States is in your heart and your thought is not your thought it's the thought of om poent Glory Hallelujah Glory let's go to uh the next slide a throne room in the house or in the Kingdom we want to lay a background in the Old Testament how they talk about Throne the Lord promis a throne so we want to read Samuel 2 Samuel verse 7 and 13 He Shall build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever talking about David and the lord always used natural things to type the scure Luke 1: 32- 33 he said he'll be great and he'll be called the son of the most high the Lord God will give him the Throne of his father David and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever his kingdom will never end the kingdom of natural David ended but the Lord was using it to type something and when you talk about types and Shadow when the Lord is doing something right now is a present word of God but tomorrow when he begins to do another thing it becomes a type let me use a scripture to explain in the Bible it said out of Israel I have called my son it's one scripture when the Lord was calling the son of children of Israel from Egypt to the promised land and we know Jacob was C from Sons of Jacob were C from Egypt to Israel and also we know the Lord Jesus Christ when he was born and is Herod wanted to kill him they have to take Mary and Joseph take him to Africa Egypt is in Africa to hide him over there which is the South and then the Lord call Jesus Christ to start his ministry and the same scripture has been fulfilled twice but now the Lord is calling us from Egypt onto into the promised land it's not a country Egypt in Africa but Egypt is a condition of the world is the cosmos world is the nature of your heart right it is the wrong King sitting in your heart right and the Lord is trying to take that King out of your heart amen and establish the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart yes sir the promised land amen so God want to establish a kingdom which last eternally because the Holy Spirit doesn't die amen even if the flesh dissolve as I think Paul said in second 2 Corinthians chapter 5 he said when this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolve we have another Tabernacle not made with hands but Eternal in the heaven and that is eternal amen so when the Holy Ghost is established in your heart it's forever and ever nothing can take the holy ghost out of your heart amen they can they can skin you alive they can boil you in in in oil they can behead you but the pill of fire in you cannot be beheaded amen so that is the kingdom we talking about let's go to the next scripture and let's see how this uh Kingdom the throne begin to be established in the heart of men you want to read act chapter 8 1 acts 1 18-4 he said but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and onto the utmost part of the earth and I want us to analyze this scripture so the kingdom of God began in the East which is Jerusalem Israel the Lord started calling it calling Peter James John and so on disciples Mary Martha to establish a kingdom and now he said this gospel that began in Jerusalem is not going to end here but it's going to go to the atos the the the the fs the Fest you can think about that's right so I I'm not a person that look at scripture historically the history is just a background so what is the uttermost part of the earth west P Beach Florida US Africa Asia Europe and we can put names on it jdda h Solomon Johnson Sister Sister Johnson that is the uttermost part of the earth that you are part of the earth that was taken you are the tiniest part of the Earth but God is establishing his Kingdom in you the gospel is in your heart a so the gospel moved from H Peter when the day of Pentecost came to you my sister to you my brother glory amen and nothing could stop it amen nothing could stop what God determines to do Hallelujah so let's look at act 2:1-4 let me read verse 9 and verse 9 sorry act chapter 1 18-14 let me read the N verse and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and Cloud receive him out of their sight so that was the kingdom of God which was taken to the Celestia when Jesus came to finish one dispensation that is dispensation of son of man he completed it on Calvary and then the thean the Eternal being the flesh went back to the cosmos the flesh didn't go to Glory you not taking nothing of this flesh to the Celestia the Celestia can dwell in this flesh but the second dimension cannot go to the Celestia so Jesus has to drop his flesh and then the Celestia King of Kings the thean the Lord Almighty kedc sit on Sat on his throne but then he promised that he will come back and establish his throne in the hearts of men whilst he was on Earth he said that the son of man does not have a place to lay his head but bears and and foxes have got hes and nest what is he talking about he was sleeping in house he was sleeping in Joseph's house Peter's house but the house he was talking about is the throne room of your heart cuz until that time since the the fall of Adam even among the prophet none of them were born again all right and God cannot completely use a vessel that is not born again amen that's why in the Old Testament some of them did what they did right David was a man after God's Own heart but the Holy Ghost could anoint David and use him to prophesy to sing to do inspiral things but because the King of Kings didn't live eternally in him David could still do what he do he could go and take somebody's wife and kill the person on top of it but when the Holy Ghost come into you the New Testament Covenant which is the greater than the Old Testament the Holy Ghost In Your Heart the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart will not let you uh commit adultery with someone and kill the husband on top of it because there's greater than David in your heart Glory hallelujah amen because you got a control tower the King of Kings is in your house and the king of King in your house will not permit you to do certain things Glory Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so act CH 2:s 1-4 he said and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting three and there and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like like as of fire and it sat upon each each of them it was not a physical tongue but is a pill of fire dividing himself among his disciples and verse four and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance when the Holy Ghost comes into your heart your language becomes Heavenly it doesn't matter how much you cast and and fight the nature changes the Holy Spirit changes your nature because your heart has become the throne room of the Lord Jesus Christ and your word your language has changed not the English language not Spanish but the language is the Heavenly language it's the deity of Jesus Christ it's your nature it's your outlook in life it's how you perceive things it's your goals and Ambitions and your aims everything in you and around you changes in fact you become a new Creator when you are born again that's why the Bible said ye must be born again though you could see the same the same brother Mark the same brother Solomon but the holy spirit in you has recreated your body even the atoms of your body is changed the person can look at the same old sister the same old brother but the Lord Almighty sees you as a new person because he himself is living in you glory to the Lord of Lord blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to the next slide which I think I've read already let's go to the next Throne the throne in the throne in your room which is Christ in your heart so the throne as we talking about political Thrones uh monarchs like Queen of England King Charles those Thrones are temporal Thrones those Thrones began and they end but there's another Throne another kingdom which has no beginning and has no end and that kingdom is the holy spirit baptism is the kingdom of eternal life that you have no beginning and you have no end though your flesh began in your your father's laws and your mother's womb but the SE Gem of Life the eternal life in you is eternal it just keep on rolling through time and through eternity and when you talk about Time and Eternity sometime we look at it as opposite however time is part of eternity amen God allowed time time is slowing a slow version of Eternity if I should put it so cuz the Lord want to manifest there's Eternal things around here there are angels around here there are lot of celestial beings around here but this eyes cannot see them because they are moving in a higher frequency way higher than your little eyes can detect so how does the Lord do the Lord slows down eternity into time to manifest eternal life in our midst to manifest love to manifest Pati to manifest Faith to manifest H brotherly kindness to manifest all the attribute to manifest the spoken word in your life to manifest healing in your life so Time and Eternity time is expression of Eternity amen yes if the Lord like I use electricity for example if we have I don't know the the high voltage power 10,000 volt if you plug yourself phone plug your stove plug your whatever charger you're going to be blown to Pieces so now they say same 10,000 vote could be slowed down steep down into 120 220 or whatever amount so that you can use it comfortably without getting hurt the Lord can appear in a form that every one of us will die that's right he can appear in a form that you collapse right but knowing that you can't take that form he breaks himself down in ministries amen he breaks himself down in the form of the holy spirit in your heart that you can pray and he can hear you from your own heart if you can manifest in the celestial form as an angel of the Lord before you you might run away you might think it's going to harm you God but he can stay in your heart and he can listen to your prayers protect you when you are sleeping prevent you from vehical accident protect your family without you dying without you being getting hurt so he knows your form and your makeup and he deals with you according to the way he has called and moed you glory to the Living God so let's read act 2: 36- 37 therefore let all the house of Israel and you are the house of Israel don't look up 2000 years ago you are the house of Israel you are a modern day Israel am let me take brother Braham when the SE were open he said Jerusalem was I think was Jeffersonville or Phoenix one of them and Jericho was H which is Tuan right he switch and one some of the brothers were saying that they went to with Abraham and he said look at the mountains in Arizona said look at the Rocks said the same rock that you see is the same rock that Moses saw how can you take rocks from Israel and plant them in Arizona a Son of God a daughter of God has got a supernatural power if you can let ourself go and let God take control the same spoken word is in you you can change situation you can speak cancer out of existence you can speak healing into existence you can speak your wayward children back into eternal life you can speak situation out of which is out of control under your control because the King of Kings is living in your heart you can bring Israel you are the real Israel Israel now fighting over Gaza is a just a natural type but the true Israel is you with the Holy Ghost baptism Amen in the natural they are they are sons of Abraham but the supernatural they don't have the F of Abraham you are the one who has the F of Abraham God didn't establish Israel on basis of tribes he established Israel on basis of his calling and the response all right all right that's why is Abra Abraham end the title a Hebrew a Hebrew means a called out one has the Lord called you out am from the kingdom of darkness onto the Kingdom of Light so you are the true Hebrew walking on Earth sometime we don't know who we are all right sister gave a testimony said brother one time I was working I saw a Jew Jewish woman and because she was Jewish you know we love them and he said Shalom of course they know Shalom and he started talking about the word he said she was like lost she didn't know what I was talking about I said sister we don't know who we are you are the real Israel you are taking your power to them they don't even know there after they are money right and their power and and and their land but you we are not fighting over this land no the land that God fought over is your flesh he doesn't care about all the big I don't know how many acres of land in West Palm Beach in us God doesn't care about it but the little land called sister Tina all right sister C sister B that is the land that is talking about that's the land he elected out of all the big land and that the land said you can take all the land give me brother Johnson give me Brother D that is what I want amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord I don't want to go go ahead of my but but let me explain this talk about I read that quote he said God want your heart God is not selfish he want to Jo he want to share you with with himself right is that you can take all the parts of your body just give him your heart take it this way let's say a little child let's say brother Joe want to drive and his father knowing that no he is's going to cause himself a wreck but no that I want to be part of you know the vehicle okay Jo take the front seat take the the back seat three you can sleep in the back seat and just give me the steering wheel when you get the steering wheel you are in control when God gets your heart is's going to throw off every being of you that's why he's not asking for your head your intellect keep your intellect by your heart not your organ biological heart but your faith this is the center of you and if you give the center of you he's in charge of all your life he will turn what is in your mind he will just delete them away all the trash in the mind your selfish motives it will dissipate and he will take control by your own flesh that's why he said give me your heart my heart unto you God doesn't want your money he doesn't want your strength give him your heart gory and when he takes over your heart he's taking over you and the whole body become Christ Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so I think I was in act CH 2 verse he said now therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made the same Jesus whom you crucify both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you receive the gift of the holy spirit for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call you were not even born when this promise was made this was made more than th years ago but God knew you that he had some seed in West Palm Beach he had some seed in the United States he had some seed wherever you were born and God at the right time he send the preacher man to preach the word of the Lord to you Glory Hallelujah to the Lord and let let me stand here a little bit you don't know how important the word that is preaching to you this is your destiny your job is not your destiny am your business is not your destiny amen your home is not your destiny amen one hurricane can destroy all the homes in Florida that's right one fire can burn we know what happened in Hawaii Wildfire can just take everything you have worked for so that is not your destiny but the word of the Lord is your destiny that's why the Lord give you brother Jack da the Lord the ministers are the local Prophet the pastor he's the local the Lord ordain him here R West page for you to feed you and it's not a pastor only to Spirit and true Tabernacle but to the whole community and the Lord give even more Pastor brother brother brother Smiley to you to pre the word of the Lord to you God give you brother brother h brother Troy [Applause] hallelujah amen glory god bless you God give you but Troy Glory Hallelujah we thank the Lord but Troy to pre to you he gave you brother brother Quint J brother Mark and all those ministers you know and so many ministers that come along to preach some will come the Lord will move them from maybe North Carolina maybe Indiana maybe New York even out of country England just to come and preach one sermon one Sunday and out of that one sermon one particular context is for [Music] you and when the preacher preaches maybe you might not even get a chance to shake hands with the preacher he's gone or the best is go God bless you you might not get a chance to invite him for dinner go to the restaurant with him but what he preaches will stay with you forever and ever he might go but what he give to you is eternal portion of the word of the Lord for you and depends on how you receive it it will impact your life if you receive with your heart yes sir it will impact your life sir if you receive it here with this one year and it flips through the other year it has no impact in your life and you have missed that portion of Eternity for you in particular that's right that's what philli was called the Holy Spirit told Philip to go because God knew he has a city in Ethiopia the Ethiopian un he was reading the book of Isaiah but he was like a denomination thinker he knew the father is God he knew this one is God he didn't have the Revelation but there was something burning in his heart because he was the seed of God look at how much God loves you that he will send somebody in your way just for you particularly in those time they didn't have many churches like we have now come on brother unlike you have a pastor you have ministers you have Deens you have mothers you have sisters so the Lord called Phillip say hey Phillip this man was rich he didn't have money with problem he didn't have problem with money he was in charge of the treasury those time they were not using dollar bills dollar bills doesn't have a value if you take $1 I think it values at 6 60 wow so it does not even value the $1 but they had gold and diamonds and rubies and and treasures very important minerals but this man there was something Laing in his heart the king of kings was not sitting in his heart and he goes to Jerusalem to worship but he wasn't satisfied wow so the Lord sent Philip in his way go speak the word to him wow and Philip went specifically said you do you understand he was sitting in his Chariot take it like somebody sitting in his limine or mercedesbenz and Laz reading his Bible with all his Entourage around him and this man Philip didn't have a car he just went like just a wayward person he wasn't maybe nicely dressed he was in his robe and say budy do you understand what you're reading said no I don't understand how can I understand when unless somebody teach me unless a Preacher Man all right unless someone sitting around a throne Glory there's one throne but the Lord has got 24 seats 12 seats Matthew James John Judah Simon Joseph the thr guys they were the immediate they have the access to the Throne all right all right and they are the one that can give you tell you about the throne amen so God called you remember Philip he didn't even understand the throne himself he said Lord show us the father and that will suffice us he didn't understand it and the Lord said Philip I've been here with you and you still don't know who I am if you see me you have seen the father amen and the Lord want you to be the same that if you see me sister so and so you've seen my father that lives in me it is not farfetch to say that if you have Christ on the inside of you remember the policeman in England when the press in US wanted to find out the Wast Revival they saw him and they said we want to we are here we are from America we want to find out what is this Wast Revival he so you have arrived amen I am the W Revival he didn't say John Wesley he said I am it didn't say Wesley say I am it didn't say Jesus Christ I am the Wy revival can you say that I am the Revival of Jesus Christ thank you Jesus you are the Revival amen that is going on in West Palm Beach you are the Revival in your home you are the Revival in your work you are the Lord Jesus Christ to your family you are the Lord Jesus Christ to your church to your neighbors to all all around you the Lord put you in a particular place just to show his glory maybe in your workplace you are there to work for money take care of your family but there's a seed of God there that the Lord connect you to that person that he sees Christ in you amen Glory Hallelujah and the Lord can bring anybody across your way just to show you the way of the Lord and when they finish they gone the Lord moved them to their next station but the word the word that he preach will stay with you forever more one time a brother asked me do you know this Minister I said yes he preached I think two sermons my pastor invited him to preach and one of the sermons stuck with me he used Moses the pattern of the Heavenly Throne how Moses to build a house Tabernacle do the same thing and he tap it with a new birth and I said that someone would never I'll never forget that someon amen there's a brother that that used to talk about his wife his wife was and brother per Green in Arizona and the brother he I mean openly said he said my wife character is not like me his character is not up to par but his wife is a woman of character so my wife is a virtuous woman she was trained she was she grew up under perin Ministry and always you tell the brothers I never heard his wife talking about herself but her character her husband will even confess that yes my character is not up to standard but my wife has got a character because where she listened to what perine taught her perine is pass and gone but the character that she receive is still with her she moved to another state under her marriage but her character is being portrayed where you are you might be training brother Jack's Ministry but maybe you might be move somewhere that's right to K to college somewhere to to for job will move you somewhere marriage will move you somewhere ministry will move you somewhere but what you learn under the ministry glory you might not be in this Tabernacle you might not be in West pal Beach but the word of the Lord the of Jesus Christ will stay with you my sister my brother the rest of your life so when you come to the word house of the Lord make sure you capture everything that being preached to you because that is molding your character that is changing your nature amen amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so let's go to uh the next slide we want to read about how this Earthly kingdom was typed when Isaiah saw this heavenly Kingdom and so that you understand what kind of kingdom is is in your heart or what kind of Kingdom you should desire in your heart Isaiah 6: 1-9 verse one in the year that King uzia died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne so the New Testament the throne didn't begin the New Testament way in the Old Testament they had throne but let's see high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood The Sims each one had six wings with twin he covered his face with twin we covered his feet with twin he did fly three and one cried onto another and said holy holy is the Lord the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke the smoke was the glory of the Lord then said I whoo is me when you come before the throne you see how incompetent you are you are not competent you are not qualified you see who you are for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the Sims who are The Sims the preacher men then flew one of the Sims unto me having a life coal in his hand which had which he had taken with the tongues of the altar how did they get the tong is the word that the lord gave to the preachers to give it to you recently sister Tatiana said I sent brother Jack's message he said brotheru this a Now message it's a life call it's not a dead call it's not a it's not a call doesn't have fire but he could see fire he said this is a Now message the Lord send he doesn't send you a bygone message no byone message will not help you but he send you a present day message that has got a quickening power in your life amen GL and he laid it upon my mouth and he said Lo this has touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is pitched also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then s then said I here I am send me amen so before you can do anything for the Lord you got to be perched you got to have a live coal of fire you have to have the word coming from the Lord through the ministry through the Min the pastor to you to purge your heart to give you the Holy Ghost baptism to give you the new birth then you become a vessel worthy to work for the Lord then the Lord can send you to work for him to magnify his glory amen so that was the the the the pattern that was laid in heaven but in the Old Testament they had a type of the new birth because the lamp hadn't died they had lamps they have goats they had cows Turtle does but they were all typing one man the Lord Jesus Christ who come to this Earth To Die For You amen so when he came on Cav and died then the life the fullness of Christ came upon the church what is the church not this concrete building you are the Church of the Living God came in your heart that is a life code the word of the Lord touching the map the lips of Isaiah is a type of the word of the Lord changing your heart consuming the old person and then the new person Christ Jesus is Born Into Your Heart let's go to uh the next slide 1 Peter 3 1:4 likewise he wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be warn by the conversation of the wives while while they beheld your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward ading of plating of the hair of wearing of gold or of putting of on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of heart of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price amen and we are all women we all we all married to Jesus Christ right how many is married to how many Miss Jesus Christ are here so we are all women in that sense not only the sisters we are all female version the Lord is the male amen all right and the Lord doesn't want our outward appearance to be like gold and diamonds and the suit we wear they are good the dresses the the whatever you can call it yes sir those are good but that doesn't show the glory of the man the hidden man the glory of the Hidden man is the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's why when the children are coming up we should Tau them to receive the Holy Spirit we shouldn't teach them to to do nails first no that become an idol in their lives what are they doing their nails for to go get boyfriend to go get a new husband all right so when we have to watch out spread that we put upon our children cuz if a young lady is coming up and you start rewarding her with nails the N is go and on and on and on because her mom has done her nails she has done her nails what else the mom has got a husband she need to get a boyfriend oh oh if if a young boy and he's got about he spent all the money on a on a on a a brand clothing H what's the name H Niki what's Nike Nike Nike Adidas puma and which one else help me out all the brand that you can talk about right that's right you don't play if you play basketball and you've got about let's say 20 Nike is Nike Nike Nike okay that's okay but don't play basketball you're not a professional basketball you've got about 20 30 n Nik lineup in your in your wardrobe and at least each each of them cost about $150 and you get broke somewhere in your life and you wonder why you are poor and you blame somebody else for being po poor while some people are learn teaching their children how to uh do stocks and buy uh buy buy buy houses buy homes and rent out and do Airbnb you are we are teaching our children how to buy all their brand cloth but we don't teach them how to make wealth am and we grow we grow poor broke we don't have money and we blame the government and we blame everybody else beside ourselves but when in the ha days when you had money you were throwing that money into something you are making a Nike is multi-billion company you are throwing your money into Nike into into what have you into nail polish I don't know how many times you go to and do your nails if you you pay $50 to for your daughter to do the nails every two weeks put that money in an investment in a college fund if your daughter is L say 12 years old the time she get to 20 at least she go 5,000 and if it's interest it will yield interest she can buy her first house when she's maybe 20 25 rent it out she doesn't have to leave dad and mom stay in your father's home until you get married but you are making wealth you are cutting the poverty out of your way you are moving into the wealthy area God is not angry when you are rich if you use it for the things of the Lord if you use it for ungodliness then that's an Abomination but if the Lord give you 1 billion one trillion and you want to use it for the things of the Lord Glory Hallelujah to the Lord amen so God is not against you getting rich God is not against you being wealthy God is not against you buying houses God is not against you having business but what you do with it is what is is what makes a difference so we need to teach our children how to build wealth instead of throwing the money away because maybe now you have some job that is paying tomorrow that job may not be there you can lose your house maybe you have three houses but then if you invest in your children when they start college they have some money amen so let's do that instead of putting their money and let's teach them how to have the holy spirit amen instead of teaching them how to do nail polish and how to do sophisticated stuff because the spirit you put on your child that spirit will manifest in her amen the spirit you put on your son that spirit will manifest in your son so watch the spirit you put on your child rather teach them how to listen to the still silent voice of the Lord Jesus Christ how to build a throne ask them if they have the Holy Ghost ask them if they desire to have the Holy Ghost ask them about the sermon that brother Jack preach ask them about the about the about the tips that you listen right ask them Bible question don't spend all the time on computer games and and video games cuz those things get them insane that's right it makes them hyperactive and they are not stable and Al Al All Too Soon you're going to start giving them medication for depression and things like that I have a a neighbor daughter was put on 13 years old put on depr uh medication for depression and then she BEC suicidal so now the doctor said take all the knives and spoons and all the ceries out of your house wow so now it moved from one thing to another and you have big farmer will throw all the medication on you if you want because that's where the money comes from that's right brother I work in hospital one person takes 22 medication and they wanted to even add more medication to that person so if you want big farmer you want your money and if let him he throw medication on you that's right so watch what you eat watch your your your lifestyle am and exercise a little bit it will take away some medication out of your life or even prevent you from taking medication to begin with amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord that's just for our benefit Glory Hallelujah to the Lord the Lord want us to be healthy walking is one of a very good exercise all right some of our elderly they can't run but you can walk in your home just keep the blood flowing it will take away a lot of a a lot of worry and Stress and Anxiety cuz those are the things that the enemy used to build cancer cells and things like that and certain food that we eat some of them are not healthy of course all the food is polluted I mean but at least you can get a more healthy version don't eat meat every seven days a week it's not good especially chicken when I stud about antibiotics I I got I was afraid even to touch chicken they put hormones antibiotics vitamins for the for the chicken or fou to grow within 3 weeks one month and they work like they are so big if you chase them they're going to die and when you eat that chicken what do you think that's to your body those chemicals it become resid chemicals in your body and all too soon the body begin to react to those chemicals it create cancer cells it creates our blood pressure our diabetes and all those sicknesses that we we we we get so if you modify your lifestyle don't eat at least at most eat meat four times a day not more than four times a day and the rest sorry four times yeah four times a day in the week and the rest of eat go something like mushroom if you like mushroom go other sorts of protein beans and and and and legum and things like that it will help your health cuz if you put in too much meat the kidney have to stress to break down those meat deliver overwork to break down those meat and once you are young you might not see the effect but when you get to certain age the organs are tired so now that you can do something about it do something about it God bless [Applause] you amen amen glory to God Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next slide glory amen so the new the new birth changes the heart into the throne room and the control tower and we want to just read a little quote the unity of one God in one Church 58122 21e paragraph 72 say how can how can he work with you when your nature when the nature of your of your spirit is of the devil is in there and every every man born on this Earth is born in sin Satan in your nature that's what sin is shap in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's right so in that kinda adamic nature how can a man how can a man achieve anything only by through his int intellectuals that's impossible let's go to the next slide but when he comes to be a new Creator an old man has passed out passed out mean he's died he's consumed he's taken out of existence and the new man Christ takes his throne in the heart in the human heart then life looks different then he start on a new road from his own selfish motives to the big ideas to make himself something big or he start right towards Calvary to recognize God then then his all his objective his motive his achievement and all all that he is lays in the glory of the Cross where Christ paid the price for the human life Christ is our life amen let's go to the next Slide the throne room of Heaven now God used the throne room of Heaven in the celestial and then build exactly the same thing on earth so Revelation 44 to11 I think I read just two two verses and round about The Throne where four and 20 seats and upon the seat I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white garment rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings Thunders thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirit of God Amen God one Throne the Lord Jesus Christ 24 Elders 24 Elders before you can understand the gospel you have to read Mark Matthew James Luke and then the book the letters of Paul those are the people that are around the throne the eldest and God has made you one of the elders around the throne you are wearing a white garment what's the white garment the Holy Spirit baptism purity of Christ and you have got a crown of gold what's the crown of gold not a physical gold but the glory of the Lord is seen in you that is the crown of gold God has put upon your head amen we are not going to wear natural gold the glory of God is more than the gold of s Africa or the god of anywhere but the God is talking about the natural language type the supernatural things the Lord is doing amen I remember Brother Joseph asked me a question one day when I came first and she was he was asking me said how did you know when you saw my mom at PBA how did you know the glory of the Lord was on her I said it's not something physical that I saw but it's supernatural right that the Lord led me to know that she's my sister right that's right so the glory of the Lord will shine on you even Sinners can identify the glory of the Lord in you sometime you don't have to talk but they can look at you and they can see that this sister is different this lady is different there's something Supernatural in and around you that is a cry the control tower the throne room in your heart Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next slide he said this sh this this sign shall follow the believer not negative thinkers not intellectual church members but born again believers who has come from the intellectual to the heart where God takes throne in his control room to control your emotions to control your faith to control your character God wants to fill you why does he want to fill you what does he want to fill you with he want to fill you with himself the holy spirit filled with with the Holy Spirit and then if you read the 91 going Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come let's go to I think the last slide if I have it 15 slide and let's see how the Holy Ghost changes your character let's see if I have it here and I think I don't have that one here I missed that one yeah but that was Abraham he had a vision in the vision some people I think were they did something in his house so in the vision the young man was he pushed by Braham and he pushed him again okay you think you li [Music] somewhere yes thank you so much thank you brother Jack for catching it for me so this is the quote so this is a vision maybe I'm not going to read everything I want to paraphrase this and the person said the person got hostile and Sh him backwards that's the way you preaches so the person to begin with didn't like preachers so when he he saw brother Braham he pushed him and remember Braham was an old boxer the skills were not gone he said that there were certain things that when you get a new bir the Holy Ghost doesn't take it away from you brother brother Smiley strength is not taken away from you because he's the hly he's got the Holy Ghost because he's a preacher his strength is still there so God doesn't take everything from you because you got the Holy Ghost he still got the power prowess in your hands you can do certain things right but there's a control tower in you soah said I said okay I'm just going to tell him tell him that it doesn't know what he's talking about other words he's going to you know I mean Revenge you know because he push him a couple times and then a voice said do not do don't do that you are a minister and I said very well so because you a minister certain things you can do people can take advantage of you they can abuse you verbally even physically you've got a prowess you can push them down in a second but ra said that the power is not the size of the person but the power in him but there's something in you that will tell that no you a minister you Minister sons of Zion to my people you can't fight on the streets that is not you right amen and you're going to hold your peace amen sister somebody can abuse you on the job she can even smack you in the face and you can put this lady down within seconds but you are married to the Lord Jesus Christ and tell no don't Revenge leave her alone I'll take care of her that is the control tower because you are a minister of the Lord you can do certain things that is who you are and whatever you do that you do with anger doesn't please the Lord even brother B was was correcting his son and he was angry but watch him and said Billy you were mad when you were beating Paul he said yes said that didn't please his Angel even your children if you do with anger because your child did something if you are angry just stay away contain yourself pray and clear your heart because the whole thing is about correcting the son not slapping him and smacking him here and there so whatever you do with anger the moment you see your anger rising up back off back off some go pray even in marriage your spouse maybe your spouse says something very nasty your temper Rises don't respond go pray go outside the house go sing Go sing go pray for her go pray for him and then when the sweetness of Christ comes back then you can deal with the situation because because you're a minister you a minist you are sister minist unto the Lord you Minister unto the Lord the Lord has made you somebody special see how this Ethiopian you know and the Lord sent Phillip to go minister to to to him you are somebody in your job you might be a sister but your testimony is revealing Jesus Christ to the people how you going to fight with the same people you are ministering to they might abuse you your managers whoever they might gos about you but because you a minister of the Lord the Lord said do not do it do not seek revenge Revenge Belongs to the Lord pray for them you don't want even evil to to come upon them but you want the Lord to forgive them and transform them that's where they will know that oh you are very special you think they don't know what they did to you they know but they know they God is watching you God put you there to be abused to be harassed to be embarrassed sometime you don't have to say sorry because you are wrong Hallelujah you say sorry because you're a peacemaker because you want you don't want to be out of character am cuz the person has got a spirit on him or her and he trying to contaminate you that Spirit right so so I'm sorry bro I'm sorry sist you just let the peace of God take over because you Minister unto the Lord and when you get your heart contaminated now you're going to spend time to repent to pray because said the Holy Ghost is what is like a dve when you do something your heart your own heart will judge you he or she's a sinner he doesn't know what he's doing but you are the one who is the Minister of the Lord so if you go you revenge or you you do what he's doing then you're going to feel condemn in your heart and you're going to have to spend time to repent but if you show maturity of Christ that know I'm a minister I don't I'm not going to do this this is not me I have Christ I'm married to Mr Jesus Christ I don't want to disgrace my husband yes you can do it but your husband for your husband's sake not you but for the sake of Jesus Christ I'm not going to fight I'm not going to use certain words I'll just I'm sorry though you are right but say sorry peace you leave the place and pray for them let the Lord take control of that amen amen amen let's go back to I think uh the 10th slide yeah I think we finished that one right let's go to the next one we finish that one let's go to the next one okay yeah he said you see the little part compartment in a man's heart God made it there for himself that's his control tower he set there to control you that is his place that's where he sent his message from the control room that's why ministers wait on the Lord they pray they fast they wait on the Lord they steady so the Lord speak into their heart and then they can speak to the church they can't speak their mind they can't speak their intellect they have to to speak what the control tower the King on the control tower want them to speak amen that's why you need to pray for your ministers the next verse and now the reason that the little compartment that was in your heart God molded you that way that was for a purpose the little place in your heart all the rest of your body belong to to you he was about to say to him but he said to you right but that heart belongs to God he say God want to share your body with you take all the all the body just give him your heart when you give him your heart you've given him everything amen he could set in the control tower that he could guide you blessed be His holy name oh if you will let him be the pilot and the Holy Ghost the co-pilot you'll be gued over the sea of life it is control tower when sit situations arise don't like certain things don't use your human power don't use your prowess you've got the prowess you've got the intellect you can tell him your mind you can even your own life your health don't think about think about Christ why am I going through this situation there's a purpose for it go to prayer first before you go to the doctor before you speak to the doctor before you take medication pray first and when you pray the Lord will tell you what to do next so always put him first in everything before you buy a house before you move before you take a job whatever you do before you marry make sure the control tower is speaking to you amen amen because if you intertwine yourself in relationship marriage or whatever with the wrong person marriage you have the Christ on your control tower he or she has the Antichrist on his control tower do you think who suffers who's going to suffer is you right your wife can punch you make you a punching bag you cannot punch it your husband can make you a punching bag you don't even match his strength wow if he doesn't have the if you don't have the control tower that's why I said make sure whomever you intertwine in marriage he or she has got Christ on the seat of his or her heart else you are in for trouble amen that Antichrist it could be sweet in the beginning but Antichrist will come you just wait in the right time maybe he doesn't she doesn't even know she's not born again not because he attend a mage Church no come on brother not because he's a preacher no but you have to make sure that he or she has got the Lord Jesus Christ on his heart don't let M CH deceive you there are many people in the message they don't have Christ on their heart there are many people preaching the gospel they don't have Christ on their heart so you have to know what the control tower is you have to know whether President Biden is in F for one before you call it f for one cuz if you call f one and is not there it's not fos one the title Christian is everywhere everybody can call himself Christian you don't pay tax by calling yourself Christian you don't pay bills by calling yourself believer all right government will not exact tax from you but it's the person as God you don't pay tax by saying that I'm in the message but is the message in you amen am that's the L most test the L test is not being a m believer or being a Christian or being a har Krishna or being whoever the L more test is make sure that he or she has got Christ on the inside if you got Christ in Christ is heaven it's going to be like this is like heaven to me praise God this is like heaven to me we've cross over Jordan to canaan's Fair land and this is like heaven to me whatever problem that because heaven and Heaven are together is easy heaven will take care of the problems amen amen amen where am I now I think I'm in the last slide right okay I
