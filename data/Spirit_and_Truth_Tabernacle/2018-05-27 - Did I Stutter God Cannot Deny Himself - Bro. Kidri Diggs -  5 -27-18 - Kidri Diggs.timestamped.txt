[1:03:08] come out somebody's trying to say
[1:03:10] something and it's not coming it's not
[1:03:12] flowing right but when we think of God
[1:03:16] God does not stop God knows exactly what
[1:03:21] he wants to sing and he will say it amen
[1:03:24] you know and when right here when I was
[1:03:26] reading the scripture when we think
[1:03:28] about Abraham and Sarah God told Abraham
[1:03:31] first he said you're gonna have a son
[1:03:34] and the son is gonna be by Sarah and
[1:03:37] Abraham laughs in chapter 17 amen
[1:03:40] Abraham laughs first you know so God
[1:03:43] comes back around and he says the same
[1:03:46] thing to Abraham says the same thing to
[1:03:49] Sarah so what was God saying God was
[1:03:52] saying when I said that see the first
[1:03:54] time running stone what I said I meant a
[1:03:58] man and judge we need to take God at His
[1:04:00] Word God is not in the business of
[1:04:03] repeating himself when he said it the
[1:04:06] first time he's done stands alone
[1:04:07] hallelujah so what we ought to do is go
[1:04:10] in the scriptures and take Godhead his
[1:04:13] water if he said it before he make it
[1:04:16] and let's realize this God cannot change
[1:04:19] her lujah he's always the same if he was
[1:04:23] God that did he's got now hi Elia such
[1:04:26] if we were if we will just take God but
[1:04:29] whatever he said we live up in the devil
[1:04:50] God created God has this memory man that
[1:04:54] knows everything about him holy there's
[1:04:57] nothing the devil can do that will make
[1:04:59] gosh you know if somebody's fellows
[1:05:05] normally they come of God for the oh-ho
[1:05:08] or they're surprised there's nothing
[1:05:10] Satan can do the catch God by surprise
[1:05:13] there's no failure there's no father's
[1:05:16] don't see that you can commit that will
[1:05:18] make gosh oh yeah
[1:05:23] church his path of death hundred his
[1:05:26] confident in his word but not only that
[1:05:28] he's confident in you hallelujah
[1:05:32] he's confident in your life hallelujah
[1:05:35] but we know when when we welcome trials
[1:05:38] and tribulation you know things happen
[1:05:40] sometimes we we start our honey but when
[1:05:47] it comes to the reality of realizing who
[1:05:51] you serve your words become playing my
[1:05:55] god is awesome my god is real my god is
[1:06:01] a deliverer hallelujah
[1:06:03] hell yeah he has no rivals oh yeah he
[1:06:06] has
[1:06:07] equals a man there's nothing holy that
[1:06:10] can even challenge God oh yeah that will
[1:06:13] make God stutter but when we look at the
[1:06:17] word we need to go back around and look
[1:06:20] at how God dealt with people that
[1:06:23] stuttered when he told them something
[1:06:25] God told Moses I have called you to go
[1:06:31] and bring the people out and Moses
[1:06:33] taught stuttering I hope you don't know
[1:06:45] your book now Moses time saying little
[1:06:48] alone I can't act kkkk I can't talk no
[1:06:51] this digit of the God where you can
[1:06:54] receive me there tell Moses Moses leave
[1:06:57] AJ mouth so basically God will tell him
[1:07:01] Moses I'm gonna talks are you a man the
[1:07:04] Bible said unto us what'd you do I got a
[1:07:18] church in here this morning
[1:07:19] oh I gotta turn to you this morning who
[1:07:23] knows what God is back to them so I've
[1:07:28] been sick I've been down and out but the
[1:07:31] Word of God always shows itself to be
[1:07:34] strong honey
[1:07:35] God always shows himself to be an on
[1:07:38] time dog when doctors say that there is
[1:07:41] no way huh hurry God says I am the way
[1:07:44] funnier would it look like the skies are
[1:07:47] cloudy God says I am the light I am The
[1:07:51] Sun I am the keeper
[1:07:53] I am the maker
[1:07:54] that I am let's realize who we serve but
[1:08:01] when we when I think about this this is
[1:08:03] this original this original topic I was
[1:08:05] think about God denying himself just
[1:08:09] look at if God ever made a promise he
[1:08:12] has to be obligated to his word now God
[1:08:15] told that told Adam and Eve he said hey
[1:08:19] you give or take of every tree in the
[1:08:21] garden just don't just this one the day
[1:08:24] you eat up you should surely die now we
[1:08:26] know what took place but let's look at
[1:08:29] title you being a part of God how many
[1:08:32] of you in here today believe that you're
[1:08:34] a part of God I don't know about you but
[1:08:36] I say to myself Satan has no hold over
[1:08:39] me that's the way I talk honey I don't
[1:08:43] walk around saying oh the devil beat me
[1:08:45] up and all the devil's us to deal with
[1:08:47] that the devil can't do nothing but what
[1:08:49] God Allah the devil can't do nothing in
[1:08:53] your life but what you accept in your
[1:08:56] life the mind is the battleground the
[1:08:59] mind is a place where you become
[1:09:01] straight even right now you haven't
[1:09:06] touched in your mind and you thinking
[1:09:08] about you nothing is sure but if you
[1:09:12] begin to think in yourself God is
[1:09:14] talking to me I guarantee the
[1:09:17] supernatural will start coming your way
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:22] we waste too much time entertaining
[1:09:25] stuff that I'm not eternal
[1:09:29] Gazza eternal God hallelujah he he knows
[1:09:33] exactly how to get our attention and you
[1:09:36] know Church about think about this I
[1:09:38] said you know God told him in school he
[1:09:40] said the day you eat up I'm a king he
[1:09:44] meant that he didn't stop but I want to
[1:09:48] show you something so powerful when it
[1:09:50] comes to God Amen he totally taught me
[1:09:53] he said the day you eat on Mikey he he
[1:09:57] didn't leave any reason he didn't even
[1:09:59] start honey he didn't leave a way out
[1:10:02] you eat you die
[1:10:06] didn't stop you seeing you got you don't
[1:10:11] believe you got that's what God said but
[1:10:14] I wanna show you something new more
[1:10:15] powerful than what God seen oh my god
[1:10:22] let me let me say like the Pentecostal
[1:10:25] preacher yeah oh don't hit me
[1:10:27] I ain't got no chart up in here so God
[1:10:35] said God said oh we got to learn how to
[1:10:38] get God's attention in there God said
[1:10:41] then you eat up I'm a kid
[1:10:43] amen you don't really die man and you
[1:10:45] know I didn't see at that time he was
[1:10:48] talking about their flesh because there
[1:10:51] wasn't flesh they were spirit hallelujah
[1:10:54] adamandeva spirit beings higher yeah
[1:10:57] and God said the day you eat up you
[1:10:59] shall surely die we thought that today
[1:11:01] we spoke that in spirit he created a
[1:11:03] body good body but let's go into chips
[1:11:07] from there amen
[1:11:08] he's the serpent stop talking to us
[1:11:10] start talking to her / darden already
[1:11:14] talked to the spirit now the devil come
[1:11:17] he talked to her flesh her Leah did you
[1:11:20] did you did you did that God sing stop
[1:11:24] listening to the devil he can't even get
[1:11:29] his words together don't you know I've
[1:11:31] said it before don't we know as
[1:11:33] believers that the devil Satan Lucifer
[1:11:35] himself he doesn't even have his own
[1:11:37] vocabulary everything he says is a
[1:11:41] perversion of what God has already said
[1:11:43] he comes to him didn't God say honey why
[1:11:49] did he come and say I see on g-good he
[1:11:53] ain't got my words of his own you you
[1:11:56] look at your life you watch your life
[1:11:57] you watch even right now what he's doing
[1:11:59] to you in your mind he's trying to get
[1:12:01] you not to accept what I'm saying
[1:12:04] he's trying to twist around I'm saying
[1:12:07] your blessing you come and say but what
[1:12:10] about this what um what about that
[1:12:15] earlier though my search they get to the
[1:12:20] place where each she begins to be
[1:12:22] entertained by the enemy she entertained
[1:12:25] by the enemy and from there hallelujah
[1:12:28] she starts to enter into another place
[1:12:30] she starts to back in denial and the
[1:12:34] worst thing you can do is walk in denial
[1:12:36] when you know you're not living
[1:12:38] according to what God wants you to live
[1:12:40] a man you know and you know why I'm here
[1:12:43] I'm I just go south I begin to think
[1:12:45] about you know the way the world is set
[1:12:48] up and you know I used to be in the
[1:12:49] world but you don't realize how do you
[1:12:52] sometimes will you put eight things you
[1:12:55] don't realize what's really going on
[1:12:56] you know they got they got different
[1:12:59] musicians and singers and all these
[1:13:01] things and you know a lot of times
[1:13:03] entertainment is not about the voice for
[1:13:06] the music entertainment is about the
[1:13:08] movement let me let me come home a
[1:13:13] little bit honey hey man let me come
[1:13:17] home a little bit
[1:13:18] Beyonce ain't the greatest singer in the
[1:13:20] world she's one of the greatest dancers
[1:13:24] earlier and see her dancing is what gets
[1:13:27] everybody's attention
[1:13:28] I am oh she can see now you watch the
[1:13:30] next group of women coming up oh yeah
[1:13:32] cardi B was a stripper a dancer ho yeah
[1:13:38] and now she's one of the most popular
[1:13:40] women it is that's walking her face on
[1:13:42] the earth how does she get her clean
[1:13:43] your fame the pole and you watch out you
[1:13:48] watch out at singles Oh what babe
[1:13:51] Michael Jackson so popular
[1:13:57] never meant to same but it was all about
[1:14:00] the movement attention what made Elvis
[1:14:03] so breathtaking it was the dancing the
[1:14:08] movement hungry let me Sanchez it is a
[1:14:12] perversion because dancing is a sign of
[1:14:15] fake to me
[1:14:15] and what Satan has come he's tried to
[1:14:18] take the dancing out of the church who's
[1:14:21] trying to steal a victory that's what
[1:14:24] the popular dog says a dancing is a kind
[1:14:27] of victory and Satan is coming you tried
[1:14:32] to give that to the world it don't
[1:14:34] belong but I show you honey from their
[1:14:46] point of view it's of curse because
[1:14:48] there's a spirit behind it in me if you
[1:14:50] want I love you watch in the Bible
[1:14:53] remember who wrote his daughter and then
[1:14:56] she went before the king is she and she
[1:15:03] dances she whipped it up she broke it
[1:15:06] down she Nene's kkj days she did it all
[1:15:11] she wobbled she bobbled honey she
[1:15:15] Electric Slide she did it all honey and
[1:15:17] she got the Kings attention and once you
[1:15:20] paralyzed the Kings mind by his eyes it
[1:15:25] was amazing it was what he saw but we're
[1:15:33] going down here today we've got some
[1:15:35] dancers and you got some people looking
[1:15:37] in the mirror and bringing it down
[1:15:40] hallelujah
[1:15:42] you be careful there's a spirit behind
[1:15:44] your movement it makes you going
[1:15:47] somewhere hungry and you love to be
[1:15:49] entertained you like you show me who
[1:15:50] like to see the women drop it like it's
[1:15:52] hot there's a spirit
[1:15:54] that you better deny that spirit honey
[1:16:00] but you know she did and she dares me
[1:16:03] she got the Kings attention in the key
[1:16:05] like hello
[1:16:06] like oh you have without a it won't
[1:16:12] because she danced it wasn't a voice it
[1:16:15] was it was her dancing honey than what
[1:16:17] they call a queen bee she can have
[1:16:19] whatever she want
[1:16:24] okay sir I got pretty riders coming I
[1:16:27] got cleaning I can say to you buy this
[1:16:29] honey you look at some of the most
[1:16:31] powerful superstars what they call
[1:16:33] superstar their dances uh sure
[1:16:37] Chris Brown I'm going on and on honey
[1:16:45] but you know you don't see she she
[1:16:51] begins to dance and she did all these
[1:16:53] things earlier so what was behind the
[1:16:55] movement what was behind the movement at
[1:16:59] that time of her dance was death because
[1:17:03] the request was okay how my dance before
[1:17:06] you won she hypnotized the king the King
[1:17:08] under her spell of Dance
[1:17:10] he said you can have whatever you go how
[1:17:12] you and she didn't want the phone she
[1:17:14] didn't want the money she wants to stop
[1:17:16] them 19 she wanted to stop the anointing
[1:17:21] that was in the place at that time and
[1:17:23] the anointing was on John the Baptist
[1:17:25] hurry up and she said hi
[1:17:29] turn in a charter you know take one
[1:17:34] dance for that honey so I wonder if that
[1:17:39] spirit rules back then is it still the
[1:17:42] same spirit how still the same spirit
[1:17:53] that's moving a man but you know just
[1:17:55] from there hallelujah you know we look
[1:17:58] at Adam and Eve and God told them you
[1:18:00] know don't don't don't partake of the
[1:18:02] don't even whatever and he was real
[1:18:04] confident at that time she's like hey he
[1:18:06] said don't eat it don't even touch it
[1:18:07] she was so she was so into what God said
[1:18:10] she added some things II you know
[1:18:13] sometimes we good when we got under
[1:18:15] pressure but when pressure come the real
[1:18:17] you go come on honey
[1:18:19] the real heart if we want to say where
[1:18:22] it ends will come out with a hurricane
[1:18:24] coming the real citizens of Florida will
[1:18:31] show themselves when a hurricane come on

[1:18:42] weren't born and raised
[1:18:44] seeing the spellemann' I always take no
[1:18:45] offence on anything but you know how
[1:18:50] people will change location but that's
[1:18:53] not who they really are they're living
[1:18:55] in denial huh and you know Church they

[1:20:23] that there's some good things that can
[1:20:26] come out of a stall if in many of years

[1:20:31] things came out of the existence of a
[1:20:34] hurricane and now we're we were eating

[1:37:35] real simple I just gonna let him know I
[1:37:38] know I know who you are why you care no
[1:37:44] time to be something else yet in denial
[1:37:46] I know what I was looking at you
[1:37:49] couldn't fool me I wasn't stuttering oh
[1:37:52] yeah so what I did was he got he gave me
[1:37:56] all my stuff and he put his head on the
[1:37:58] hip
[1:37:58] gave me attitude or what I was once I
[1:38:00] got all my stuff got my bag cuz I
[1:38:03] appreciate your breath
[1:38:46] you didn't need no way I'm doing y'all
[1:38:56] y'all complete probably one behind me
[1:39:01] but it was too late I had my stuff and I
[1:39:04] was dull I go below y'all know I love
[1:39:11] the enjoy a church I don't believe in
[1:39:14] all this religious cold dead stuff
[1:39:16] I believe in joint celebrating God
[1:39:20] hallelujah
[1:39:22] look we know the story Eve she listens
[1:39:29] to the devil she put takes up the fruit
[1:39:30] that God said you do it on Mikey but I
[1:39:33] want to show you how powerful holy life
[1:39:36] is God can say something
[1:39:38] hallelujah but life can be even more
[1:39:42] powerful with God see that's what I say
[1:39:47] I rather you not preach me a sermon but
[1:39:51] live me why because sometimes people can
[1:39:54] say things like the amount but they life
[1:39:56] is doing something different honey so
[1:39:58] eat in the end in the midst of all that
[1:40:01] honey
[1:40:02] Eve honey she for takes of the fruit and
[1:40:06] she said this is good and I'm gonna give
[1:40:08] some mother now Adam wouldn't deceive
[1:40:11] having knew full well what he was doing
[1:40:13] you know what he was doing he was
[1:40:15] stepping into the role of a redeemer
[1:40:20] because I want you to understand Adam
[1:40:22] was a god he had the mind of God so he
[1:40:26] knew what God was gonna do before he did
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:33] the Bible say he was created in the
[1:40:35] image and likeness of God he was a God
[1:40:39] for you so he knew the thoughts of God
[1:40:41] he knew God was on his way to kill his
[1:40:44] wife
[1:40:45] so Adams say I can't let him kill her so
[1:40:48] I'm gonna protect her this food because
[1:40:49] God can't kill himself
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:56] so Adam injected the seat of God in his
[1:41:00] wife which was able and if God would
[1:41:04] have killed Abel in a bit like hunting
[1:41:06] if you to kill Eve it'll be like God
[1:41:09] killing himself and he cannot deny
[1:41:12] himself hallelujah that's a powerful
[1:41:16] life here's a man when you get the Holy
[1:41:18] Spirit in you becoming team with God God
[1:41:21] cannot deny you he has to give you what
[1:41:24] he would give himself and God wants to
[1:41:28] bless him
[1:41:29] God wants to celebrate him amen
[1:41:32] that's what you need to tell say today
[1:41:34] man I come from God that's why when
[1:41:38] Sarah left haruya seven land God oh yeah
[1:41:42] the probably God say he should have
[1:41:43] killed her right there but if he would
[1:41:46] have killed her he would have been
[1:41:48] killing himself because he said honey
[1:41:51] bye sorry you're gonna have a child
[1:41:53] hurry up
[1:41:54] and if God would have killed Sarah here
[1:41:57] have been killing his promise so you
[1:42:02] know what you need to do when you're
[1:42:03] going through you need to start
[1:42:05] rehearsing the Word of God because God
[1:42:07] cannot deny his words a man he has to
[1:42:11] hardly respond to that word he cannot
[1:42:13] cheat on her because he's saying amen
[1:42:16] and you know from daring man Sarah and
[1:42:19] Abraham they go there living a life hit
[1:42:21] on a man and God told him to do this and
[1:42:23] do that you know II get it get all the
[1:42:25] way two years
[1:42:27] nothing happened and one day serve got
[1:42:30] taken earlier but God couldn't let it
[1:42:34] happen like that because it wasn't just
[1:42:39] the fact of Serbian Sarah and Abraham
[1:42:41] Abraham God was protecting his word
[1:42:45] because he didn't stop he said you don't
[1:42:48] have a son but sir funny
[1:42:51] so when Sarah got taken by dremel a God
[1:42:53] had to show up and straighten out
[1:42:55] because life was just as powerful as
[1:42:58] what he spoke that's what I want you to
[1:43:03] understand church no matter what the
[1:43:05] devil is doing if you're living the
[1:43:07] right kind of life God has to respond in
[1:43:09] your face
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] I'm glad a couple y'all know where I met
[1:43:18] her he has to respond to himself we have
[1:43:24] to believe that we are a part of God
[1:43:26] yeah my mama's soon or my daddy is James
[1:43:29] but really I'm a part of God because God
[1:43:32] put those two together just to produce
[1:43:34] me because he knew I was gonna be
[1:43:36] finally a part of him earlier some God
[1:43:39] had to put them he couldn't deny
[1:43:41] them to because to bring for me and
[1:43:45] there are some things in your family
[1:43:46] you're letting them eat this record I
[1:43:49] mean this is as simple as I can say it
[1:43:53] I'm gonna beat you much longer
[1:43:54] that's simply y'all know I'm about to
[1:43:55] close so you know
[1:43:59] hallelujah you know just just you can
[1:44:02] see God in nature and then you take a
[1:44:06] tree a tree cannot deny his roots
[1:44:17] that's why we have family reunions we
[1:44:20] have ancestors and all the stuff uglier
[1:44:23] because what does it do is fix of your
[1:44:25] roots and you can't no matter how dark
[1:44:28] you mean maybe I liked you maybe you
[1:44:30] cannot deny your room we had we had a
[1:44:34] man uh who was governor whatever he was
[1:44:38] in Carolina and you know what he was aa
[1:44:42] bigoted me do you know the meaning yeah
[1:44:44] he had his own ways hey they did his
[1:44:47] issue you know he's kind of racist they
[1:44:48] did his ancestry and all that come to
[1:44:50] find out he had some black in no matter
[1:44:57] how mad he died he couldn't change where
[1:45:00] he came from
[1:45:02] oh yeah that's one thing about Satan he
[1:45:07] cannot change the route he cannot change
[1:45:11] where you come from and if we would just
[1:45:14] be the home where we come from weird box
[1:45:17] the devil out of the church we come from
[1:45:25] God you can treat your night the night
[1:45:27] his route did you come from alabaster
[1:45:32] huh huh I come from God Africa is a
[1:45:41] place that's gone parish I come from a
[1:45:43] place that's eternal oh my brother comes
[1:45:50] the motherland know I come from heaven
[1:45:57] you know so people can't give that
[1:45:59] because I got these images in the amount
[1:46:01] of black history Pookie have amazing huh
[1:46:07] stole it that ain't my roots are not the
[1:46:20] Civil War my roots

[1:46:27] it was oh hey you got a little Bob
[1:46:30] what's going on there is down thankful
[1:46:35] for what we have accomplished in it but
[1:46:37] there's a bigger picture there's a
[1:46:41] bigger picture huh with certain positive
[1:46:44] America will let me in then I go to my
[1:46:47] real roots and I play God open doors
[1:46:50] that will come that's not a day for me
[1:46:58] that's what I'm talking about when you
[1:47:00] know where you come from
[1:47:07] stop living in denial can you imagine

[1:47:12] don't feed your Konya so me thought you

[1:47:30] here to say to them today you need to
[1:47:32] let the devil know you got rights you

[1:47:37] your children that's what your old ones
[1:47:40] hey man you got a right the gutter guard
[1:47:42] impaired

[1:47:51] get used we get used to losing
[1:47:54] we accept the ballot don't work out with
[1:47:56] yeah I guess what my God's will how you
[1:48:00] know that we need to be like Joshua
[1:48:04] Joshua didn't live in denial he will
[1:48:09] shoot God told him we're able to solo
[1:48:12] your feasts are trained I'm given to you
[1:48:13] for position searching he would never
[1:48:16] against a lie hallelujah and the people
[1:48:18] start stirring they lost the battle and
[1:48:19] jostle didn't stir one means a hold of
[1:48:23] something everybody this passion free
[1:48:26] the other side I was going on I know my
[1:48:29] God told me God spoke to me talk and he
[1:48:32] didn't stop so Joshua we got in plans
[1:48:35] found out that they were saying in the
[1:48:37] camp he's okay we're gonna deal with the
[1:48:40] Synod after we deal with it we won't go
[1:48:41] back and fight the same people that beat
[1:48:43] us up I know what God said to me
[1:48:48] hallelujah if you didn't mess up
[1:48:50] something get it right and I guarantee
[1:48:52] you the promise of God and still they're
[1:48:54] waiting on you still there waiting on
[1:48:57] you because God don't start a hurry oh
[1:48:59] god don't live in denial when he said a
[1:49:02] lot of times the problem is us Joshua
[1:49:08] was so sure what God said he was in the
[1:49:11] middle of a battle he's looking at the
[1:49:14] enemy fighting and then he had a salt
[1:49:16] he had a thought saying the Sun go down
[1:49:19] they're gonna regroup and you're gonna
[1:49:21] lose the battle but then he had another
[1:49:23] thought that's against what I told you I
[1:49:26] told you that you wherever you go you
[1:49:29] will win so Solomon I mean I mean Josh
[1:49:32] will begin to think what can I do to
[1:49:34] make sure honey this work of the past
[1:49:37] like God say so he's looking at the
[1:49:40] battle honey
[1:49:41] listening to the promise hungry looking
[1:49:43] at the enemy hurry up
[1:49:45] so some way in the middle of that hurry
[1:49:47] Leah something came to him in his heart
[1:49:50] that said God seen God saying honey
[1:49:56] giving it to you for possession so in
[1:49:59] the middle of that battle Joshua did
[1:50:02] something that he didn't know he was
[1:50:03] capable of denial will stop you from
[1:50:06] moving into things that you've never
[1:50:08] done before
[1:50:09] just take God at His Word so Joshua in
[1:50:12] the middle of a lady says thanks fun
