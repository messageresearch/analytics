God hey man y'all be seated in this presence just for a moment amen just want to make sure I go through proper protocol and everything that they so good to be back in the presence of the Lord amen in the house of God but David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord a man and we're just so happy so good to have my brother clean mustardy the family a man with us

good to us I bring you all greetings a man from Washington DC a man and we had a wonderful time and the services they're on last weekend and just really really just thank the Lord and men for his justice presence there in the services and many of you all heard a man that while we were there a man I just believe it must have been you know just just God's time and just the way things worked out but while we were there precious brother Quentin his father a man went home to be with the Lord a man and it wasn't easy but we actual contain a key for the Quentin and his family in prayer a man and one of the one of the beautiful things that's coming out of this is that his father would be laid to rest in Arlington a man Arlington National Cemetery that's des length and honor right and so we were very grateful you know that he served his country and he gets the honor a man to be to be laid there and so just continue to keep the family in prayer and a man they weren't there was certainly needed and I'm just just so so many things we saw the handle Lord and so we know that he's he's in control and many's at he's in complete control so we just appreciate the Lord so one more service at night as we go amen back to the close things off we've had some really precious times amen there in the services jocosely just blessed my heart a man last night I see oh my god I left I left Church look defensible well wise man that's a preaching [Music] [Applause] [Music] when Lazarus you know went and when Jesus went to baking and he called Lazarus and say Lazarus come forth Lazarus got up and he was wrapped up so we couldn't move so you just start and he saying sorry y'all meet the hop out of your situation hop to you get to somewhere where somebody can help you get out of it I say lord have mercy there was that was some good preacher we we just we just appreciate that and you know just just just a real real real good atmosphere them saints from Australia now I'm gonna tell y'all I have to step up a little bit with sisters on fine sit down look at me if you won't that's alright when the sisters in the church doing that well I tell you what make the brothers go to another level right man this is this is my kind of worship you know and there's I mean typically you go to Africa you see stuff like that but but in Australia mercy I'll tell you what if you ever get a chance to go up wrong and I'm the thing I love about them is that they don't care where they at they carry the same spirit this high worship at home I'm a worship the same way right here cuz I am at home alright but that's the way that they they handle things that you know they're just I'm just I'm just blown away you know I'm blown away Laurie they go so I'm certainly on the expectation for tonight or just looking for God to it meant complete what he has started a man this weekend praise the Lord I'm not gonna sing I'm gonna just try to go right into our fall for today [Music] thank you all for the specials they were such a blessing a man certainly appreciate each one I wanna today we're we're kind of kind of stay within a man this theme of the manifestation of the sons of God on Wednesday night we opened the service therefore the West goes with the thought the power to give and just something that I have preached here you know a little little ways back and you know just showing how brother Branham had that where he told Hattie right you know just because you said the right thing the Holy Spirit told me to tell you that whatever you asked for I can give it to you I can give it to you well whatever you asked for tonight now now now notice the Prophet could not do that and to the Holy Spirit said he could so these things are controlled by motive and objective a man not not by anything you know else but but the fact of the matter is he did it right he did it and the Holy Spirit also told him tell the little fishy I give you your life what what this what we're trying to say is that God wants to borrow somebody's lips God needs a body that he can work in and through and and and and and since you know everybody that we have read about in Scripture has come and gone there's only a few of us left so we might as well do what God has called us to do all right so you know we you know we want to just kind of stay within in this channel you know today and I want to read just a couple scriptures one of them amen we've already read and it's been read pretty much all weekend but that's Romans 8:19 you all just stand with me to read that and then also want to read out of first John Romans 8:19 praise the Lord it reads as follows my god for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God I also turn with me over to the first John chapter 3 a man let's just look at this oh really God a man here in verse 1 it says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God the world North us not because it knew him not now that's that's kind of important you know because some of the things that we're expecting to change the world that that's probably not going to happen right because Obama tells us the world knoweth us not because it knew him not right amen but there are things that we should expect to change with it right we're not you know the world will not be safe right and and I know the Bible said God so loved the world but didn't like one brother asks what world which world are you talking about right you know so so so really we know salvation was really for us you know not not necessarily for everybody else a man but but here says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is let's just buy a word of Prayer amen as we before we enter our thought here today father we just thank you for the privilege to be able to come and read the word of the Lord God our desires that the Holy Spirit would give us understanding of what we are reading there's many that pick up this Bible mainly going to church this morning and there they're quoting from the Bible they're doing all these things but got no true understanding of what it is and as we just step into a thought God take control of the thought we felt your anointing thus far and the service and God we just want you to take take part of this take control of this part of the service then may you receive all the glory all the honor Highness all behind the cross that we might not be seen but may Christ be on display today and Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord God bless you receive [Music] so I read the scripture on Wednesday night there the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God and when we read that same scripture out of the emphatic diet Glatt a man it actually speaks something a little different and the emphatic diag lot is actually the original translation of the scripture into the English language all right this is the emphatic dog line and in the original translation it says indeed the earnest expectation of the creation longs for the revelation of the sons of God all right so not just the manifestation but this word is actually translated as the revelation of the sons of God so we want to use for our title today the revelation of the sons of God amen the revelation of the sons of God so just bear with me as we just kind of take our time to get through this I want to set it up with a couple quotes and then we'll just let the Holy Spirit amen pray to the oldest beer to give us a wave that we can just coast hey man I want to start with this saw a quote out of adoption part three and then after I read that quote I'm gonna read a man from speak to this mountain so here the Prophet makes this statement we've been hearing this all weekend he says I'm sorry that should be 35 a man on that one adoption part three it should be 35 amen I'll come to that 85 later on but here in paragraph 35 says watch this master teacher Paul says the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away not if this is critical you know when we start talking about adoption we talk about talk about you know being manifest that sons of God actually you have to get to a point in your thinking right where you ask they know who you are right there there is no no question about a my predestinated or am I not predestinated hey glory to God your predestination is not based on some of your actions like your your birthday I mean like like brother Israel brought it real good you say say you predestination has a lot to do with your birth right so whatever your last name is you did not choose to be part of that family oh praise the Lord if he was either born into it or you were adopted into it like we heard last night how do you got into the family it was not your choice it was God's choice to put you in that family right so so when you know what who your mama is and who your daddy is there is nobody to come tell you anything different so when you realize that God is your father the devil cannot tell you anything different not based on your actions because that's the devil's job soon as you do something wrong you not predestinated no no no no I'm not receiving that Satan you got predestinated but I am I'm a son of God I recognize Who I am right so so so so so when you come to recognition of who you are then you act different oh my god you know the reason that you make some of the decisions that you make is because you don't know where you are you don't have any you don't have any clue who you are can I just talk a little bit you know remember the lady that was sick as I don't know what she was sick and and not only it was sick but um you know she uh well you know she she was sick and they come down to try to find out hey do you have any children you know yeah yeah I got a son he lives over and you know foreign land well why don't you tell them about your singing I don't want to bother I don't want to bother I don't I don't wanna you know get upset and have to leave his working on and I you know I don't want to do that to him and and they say well well does he ever write anything yeah he write me all the time he you know and any and he sends me these pretty pictures pretty pictures see and just through the conversation they begin to put pieces together pictures well could you show me some of these she thought she know these are live pictures thank God she saved the big ships right because cuz comes with some powder that had more more on this peg came at your life they reveal the revelation came for huh they reveal these are not pictures not only are they not but lady you are not you are wealthy woman and even Realty she was they were not they were money orders many orders and the lady was wealthy but had no clue she was making decisions of things because she didn't have an understanding and the reason we do some of the things we do I say some of things we say it because we don't have understanding what can I say we don't have revelation when revelation strikes it makes you a new person how do you somebody so we're trying to knock out I'm gonna backslide tomorrow you know I'm gonna be up for a year and I'm gonna go right back down what are you talking about something missing somewhere with your understanding here we got to get this revelation into the people come on somebody let me keep them to keep going a man and she found the pictures in her Bible so when you go back and start looking at the words you realize who you are all right can we go further look the Prophet goes on to say this says the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away knock out all the idea of ever being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm going can I just make this statement God don't have time to waste so what I mean by that if God could see fit to allow you to come to a church that would preach these things to you God is not wasting his time otherwise he would have sent you somewhere else but when you come even in your sin cuz i'ma tell you the reason the way you gonna stop sinners when you recognize who you are it's a different conduct that goes with it hallelujah the reason we do these things because we don't know who we are right but let me say SEPA God I got got ain't got time to waste like that so he's not he's not playing games if he allowed you to come into it to hear it he has purpose for that all right stay with me here I want to go further hey man listen listen says I'm gone and the next day God condemned me and the next day I'm back again so that's nonsense that's what the prophets said that is nonsense so if somebody start complaining I don't know if I'm hearing I don't know if I'm Danna that's nonsense that's what the Prophet says that's nonsense it says now this this book is not addressed evangelistic teaching evangelist sermons we don't touch this on the fields I bring this to the church for Paul addressed it to the Saints those that are called and preserved in our field and I set aside an hour in the Holy Spirit already in King this land he's trying to tell them the first thing get it out of your mind that you're gonna get lost and you're gonna do this up and you're scared it is when the brother talked about that last night God have not yet see some people think fear is something that's normal no fear is a spirit and God has not given you the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind all right let's go on a little further get out of your mind that you're gonna be lost that's you're gonna get lost you got to do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of nothing things trying to tell you where you're at who you are how you standing let me go right onto this next one here this is speak to this mountain speak to this mountain hallelujah thank you Jesus we're trying to bring a revelation to the sons of God a man here the the prophet makes this statement the Word of God is so infallible says that not one jot or tittle can ever fail and just on that much scripture we could base an eternity knowing that it would never fail all right and because it is a part of God God is in his word and we are noticed that how that it always happens no matter how strange it may seem but in God's own good time he makes every word testify Jesus when he was on I was here on earth the Scriptures cannot be broken iiiiii I got a I got a I got a just inject something there you know because when we talk about adoption I'm getting way ahead of myself but I'm gonna just repeat myself when I get to those know somebody just repeat it again all right but but when we talk about adoption we understand and and and I love the way that brother Ferguson brought the quote about the earnest of our adoption and the fullness all right there's a quote on that about the earnest and the fullness of adoption actually brings you to a body change that's the fullness of it okay but the earnest of it a man allows you to enjoy some of the benefits right now okay and and and and one of the things that that I know that the earnest is supposed to give me is I'm supposed to be able to a man stop sickness the earnest actually gives me that then I that's what the Prophet told me right as an adopted son I can stop sickness but not that quote that I just read a man said that on the Scriptures cannot be broken I was meditating on this because if I'm supposed as a as an adopted son of God be able to stop sickness every time I run into a sick person you know what I'm trying to do stop sickness but then I look at it saying that the sickness did stop does that mean I'm not adopted because the sickness didn't stop I'm supposed to stop sickness but that you know since the sicknesses since my word was not backed does that mean I'm not adopted sort of social artists begin to kind of deal with me a man on this and I begin to take we know Christ himself was adopted right brother branham brings it out Mount Transfiguration experience Christ Himself was adopted but Christ himself also had to go to the cross and when he went to the cross there was a time where Christ himself felt that the father had forsaken him while he's adopted he felt forsaken Oh I began to think about well why is it that when I pray for every sick person they're not heal because I'm as an adopted son I'm supposed to stop shake this what God just begin to show me I cannot break my own work and what anybody should say when I told Adam that day you eat thereof that day you will die then that's exactly what I meant and I cannot break my word sin brought death so so there's going to be times even in our placing there's going to be times where we don't see situations and we got to realize it's the will of God and it's the Word of God it does not mean that changes who we are with steel adopted sons and daughters of God oh my god let me just keep reading so I can go on amen Oh hallelujah scripture cannot be broken a man and see and see this is this is the thing of maturity that God is bringing us to because we will realize that when we're asking thing has got to be in the wheel and when I'm ain't got to be in the word you can't actually things outside the word even when Jesus even when Jesus you know begin to pray said by now he knew he knew father you know dude do I really have to drink in his cup this can pass you can change the situation hey new guy I mean he knew that that was possible but but he also knew that that they had to come to the place where it's like stop asking for a change in that situation because have there been no Calvary there would be no redemption for mankind can I can I say it this way had there been no Calvary we wouldn't be able to talk about adoption right so he realized that prayer changed from asking God to change to help change it and said Lord nevertheless not my will but your will be done that takes a surrender and then sometimes in our Christian walk God can require that of us it does not change who you are in Christ and I want to make it make it very clear we talk about adoption we're talking about a place in Christ I'm not talking a place in church there everybody you know and you know I I'm gonna just make it plain and couldn't even try to put it in brother branham even said it this way but I don't think he was leaving it there we try to put it on fivefold ministry the adoption is you know pastor evangelist teacher you know past I mean a hostile prophet well that just eliminated all the sisters all of them when if you put adoption they're placing there you just eliminated every sister it can't be there now that might be part of it but it's not ending there oh my god it came in there it's a place in Christ and I'm trying to get I'm trying to get there when a sister recognizes her place in Christ and why don't--why don't want to get one of your places I can tell you this right now sisters at one of your places is these signs shall follow them then that belief so them includes him and her these signs shall follow them let me give you another one they they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Oh hallelujah and get off my notes nah this is the Bible right so so so so so so sister has the right ain't man to pray for somebody oh no yo no it's all about place it's all about where you act I know I know particular sister and then she felt the ministry she was sick with a certain sickness and I went I hear the a certain connection that other people that had the same sickness she wanted to go pray for so she went to husband would you go to the hospital with me so we can pray for these people nothing wrong with that my aunt T one time was in a hospital room there was a sister get ready to give birth to a baby and don't carry the baby nine months and at the time of birth that umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck they she did not have time to call the pastor she called on that name and right there on the spot she began to pray and rebuked that temple and and somehow Amen someway that baby was freed from that situation and came out okay she found her place in Christ and her place in Christ allows her to rebuke a devil to cast out Devils and when she prayed God backed up her prayer oh that's not the only time it happened you know remember one time in the meeting brother branham he's get ready to come out of how to play line and there's a sister sitting on the front row you only heard this quote the sisters sit down in the front row and now she saw a mother coming cuz all these people just crowding then she saw a mother with a baby the baby would start crying and and she's like something like I just feel led to give that lady my seat but but really the Holy Spirit was dealing with her pray for the baby hey she said she said no I'm not gonna pray for the baby because brother branham's gonna free for the baby I see the momma got a prayer card the baby gonna get into the prayer line brother Brandon on break so I'm not gonna touch the baby hallelujah and then he says so so she say ma'am do you mind me you know you want to have my seat yes yes yes sir I don't mind you know thank you I really appreciate that so she she she's witnessed it up and just wouldn't let it go that press that press was on say now pray for the baby I didn't tell you to give your seat to the baby pray for the baby pray for the baby pray for she could not get away from it woman a hard time she had to be that's not what God ordained how to do don't just give up your seat pray for the baby she said ma'am I'm so sorry I've just got this thing on me and I don't know if it's a spirit of what I don't know what it is but I just feel late to pray for your baby do you mind me praying for the baby I don't know I know brother branham gonna pray for it I'm not you know trying to take anything from the Prophet you know what I'm saying I'm just adding to it a little bit I'm not trying to take anything from the Prophet right but I just feel led to pray for your baby ma'am I don't mind come on I would love for you to pray for the baby she pray for the baby and she once she prays she just got out of there went all the way up to the balcony brother Branham comes out preaches a sermon and after he preaches his sermon this baby come through and brother Branham said oh the baby's already healed yeah the baby's already here oh and what happened was there was a sister that was sitting here and she gave you a seat and oh she's sitting up there in the balcony and she prayed for the baby when she prayed for the baby the baby got healed and here's what the Prophet said the Prophet said had that lady not pray for the baby the same God that called her out to bless her it's the same God that would have called her out to rebuke her why didn't you pray for the baby right so so so so so so I mean that lady might not have realized but she was finding her place as a believer in Christ she had the authority to lay hands on the sick and they would recover brother branham operate exercise that too often times when he would pray for people in the north of against would get great he would actually tell people lay hands on your neighbor and there he would quote the scripture why because it was his job to turn the hearts of the people back to the water he was not trying to pull people to himself but he was trying to show us our place in the world oh my god all right let me go on a little further I got to finish reading this quote Jesus seen when he was here on earth the Scriptures cannot be broken and he said you destroy this body I'll raise it up in three days because it was based upon the scripture but David the prophet has said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul and help he knew that stripped to pertain to him for the scripture was to the Messiah the Holy One and he knew his position and his standing in the kingdom see this is what we need to know the revelations got to break forth to us he knew his position and is standing in the kingdom that he was that person I know I know I got a lot of scriptures that pertain to me one of them the spirit and the bride say come and what the Prophet says that the spirit the brought the spirit the prophet and the bride would be saying the same thing oh my god let me go on I got to move on I got to it says he knew his position and his standing in the kingdom that he was that person so knowing that the Scriptures cannot be broken therefore he knew that within 72 hours his body would have to raise again but the scripture cannot be broken many people wander he said that the three days and nights if you'll take it says within three days and nights he died on Friday afternoon was up on Sunday morning because not one cell of that precious body could cover up because the Word of God said it would not corrupt and he knew before corruption set in that he would raise from the earth that's putting confidence and what the word saying right you say if I knew there was a scripture that pertained to me like that I believe I could have the same thing but the Baron says well my beloved friends for divine promise in the Bible belongs to you and it's just as essential to you as it was to him you find one promise here that God has made and all the heavens and earth will pass away before that promise would ever fail to act in your stead oh I love this because it's to the believer who so ever will may come in partake of these blessings let me go a little further now I think that the one main thing that causes us to miss the blessings and remember faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God and the reason we missed it is because we don't feed on it enough you know there you go it's on the tapes it's in the boots it's also Oh help us let me be careful when I say this you gotta know who feeding you you gotta know who's feeding you right because if they not feeding you this you're never developed into this if the attention is solely put on the Prophet and no attention on the bride we have to understand the prophets role by scripture you can understand it the Prophet was Elysa he went to find a Rebecca Rebecca was in the world and she heard it oh my god you know I mean Indian armor I got now imma imma just let me just make one little comment here before I go into the head Rebecca was Rebecca's in the world a man right and she heard from Eliezer Rebecca could have been in the church and she heard from Ellie's hallelujah and what went out what brother brand I'm saying I can't find it right here it's what I just I just have to quote it off memory I think I might have it wrong but it's something like this he said the word and you connect it with the word right so so when you heard the word you connected with the word no matter where you were you could have been in the world but when you hurt the word you connected with the world you could have been a denominational churches when you heard the word you want you connect it with the word how I mean up right in the word is still speaking today calling people out of situations and circumstances calling them into life when we record hurts like not now wait a minute this man prayed what prayed that you know that the woman that would come and offer acts for water that she's not only give me water but give water to my camels and when she heard that's like none that just struck something else now who is your master y'all evidently have a praying house if the servant is out praying like evidently supernatural things that happen in your house and I can just imagine maybe Eliezer neither what the scripture don't say this but I'm thinking that while he was there at the house maybe he getting up and begin to break in on some things said Abraham and Sarah could not have a son and God just so happened to bless him in their old age he he renewed their youth he changed the inside and all of a sudden Isaac came forth and this Isaac was considered the promised son waited 25 years from and in Rebekah saying I don't know how long I've been waiting for Isaac but this sounds like the man that I want to marry I ain't never seen him before but his testimony she fell in love with the testimony so we ought to be fun in love with the testimonies of our Lord and saviors doing in our niche hallelujah we've never laid eyes on him but I fell in love with the testimonies and every time the profit was shared testimony it caused me to go deeper and deeper in love he did what oh that sounds like my that's sound like my Savior that sound like my Jesus oh I want to know him he what brother Branham was the LEDs that introduced us to the Lord Jesus Christ so the emphasis is on Christ always on Christ always I put the emphasis there praise the Lord I can't put it in anywhere else it's got to be on Christ hallelujah oh thank you Jesus all right all right let me uh so we don't feed on it enough the reason that we're missing some of these things is that we don't feed on enough the reason that we're not experiencing some of the things that we should be experiencing because we don't feed on enough now I'm gonna tell you something you know you start the sermons like this start coming forth or meeting like this come forth and and the people get to start talking about it more and more I'm gonna tell you the presence of God will start drawing near that you know how Hattie Wright got what she acts for because they were talking about things oh my god they were talking about the right things amen and and if we start talking about him a little bit more his presence would draw near and what we're doing with coming to a revelation and understanding of who we are as sons and daughters of God there's not many people that can even go out and have the conversations that y'all have they can't even quote the things that sell quote can't even do that I mean you start talking to them about it they like where you from where you get that from where you heard that right they have no idea and here you hear you you hear you sitting in the restaurant right ready to shout right ready to chop I mean and they seem like these people have lost a man no no no yeah well we did we lost our mind but we gain the mind of Christ and we know we're not citizens of this kingdom we're from another kingdom pilgrims passing through Oh hallelujah amen so let me just count on let me talk about this just uh let me finish this quote and I got it I got it I got a dis leave a couple things here this so we don't feed on enough that's what says we don't feel enough Jesus that man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God man should have his daily bread by the Word of God but we try to make it more or less some far-off promise way away in some other age but the Bible says now are we the sons of God not we will be amen we are now right and God has not made it complicated and many people try to think it's that way that is complicated therefore they miss the real blessing of the word by trying to make it some hard thing and my purpose in these next 10 or 15 minutes is to reveal to you the best that I can by his blessed word that God is not complicated in any way the believer makes it complicated God makes it simple now you know I was I was talking about you know this the the earnest of our adoption and the fullness for of our adoption little earlier and their their statements you know and it women when we understand that we're walking in the earnest of our adoption we can actually decay declare of that and you have to be careful with this let me let me be very careful let me be giving very careful with this I love the way brother to Cosi brought around last night when we talk about being adopted right he said that it's a public show right it's something that that God does himself in the image and it becomes a public show and and he actually I don't know how many caught up a brother to Cocoa she actually made the same statement that I made on Wednesday night right and what he said is he started talking about how job do things publicly and he said even your critics for your enemies will recognize what God has done for you right and I have shared this on the always night Elijah let me let me let me read something just turn on your second first Kings 18 I want to make sure I get this just right first Kings 18 let me let me let me oh god I can I could take off but I can't take off I can but I can't I feel constrained Oh glory to God this is I think its first oh I'm in 1st Samuel I need to be in first Kings I want to make sure I clench this so I got a preach and teach alright this this is important follow me here in 1st Kings 18 and let's look at verse 36 this is after Elijah challenged the the false prophets the prophets of bale each are challenged in now let's let's watch something and and I'm leading it I want to lead in with this statement we understand that not one of us would have the same Ministry of brother branham we understand that we won't understand why let's read this right here in the scripture so first Kings 18 verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice but Elijah the Prophet came near said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word key verse right here hear me o Lord now notice his prayer you got to watch what a person is saying in the prayer alright hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again Elijah says this in his prayer so Elijah had a responsibility to turn the hearts of the people back to God there was Elijah the first prophets huh hey Leah enero and when the fourth anointing of Elijah comes the same anointing according to maritime four is the turn the hearts of the people of a top of Barnabas [Applause] so that's why we know nobody will ever have that ministry because that ministry turns our hearts are the people back so god nobody can do that but him but but even though he had that responsibility Eli sure looked at it and said I'm not trying to turn about a heart back that's not what I'm here to do you already did that I respect that but the same God that was moving in your life and in any life jaar yes Eli shut up what will you have for me before I go what will you have me to do he said well you you you you ask now i'ma tell you i'ma take say I want a double portion of your spirit and he lied to look at it it's not even expecting an answer he said you have asked the hard thing you actually whole thing I don't know how are we gonna do this he said but nevertheless and let me taste them Eli shall receive this promise because he was willing to stay with the word if he lied to his private discussion but because Elijah I'm gonna follow you to Bethel i'ma following the Guildhall I'm a father you know Jordan where do you go ama keep my eyes on you and because he's day with the while he received a double portion and notice this when he got the double portion how many people even start come here what feeling what emotion was there what cry what's here what what jumper sure what happened nothing happened but the situation presented itself and he walked down the Troy and said I can't walk across it and I saw how he later came across and I'm gonna take the same mantle when he got the manatees he looked at the roller took the mantle where is the Lord Donna me lamb chop and when he spoke it God the waters parted Riley and his critics were there it was a public testimony his critics were there he is not the claim is adoption the great said when they saw the water back up 50 of them the spirit of Elijah death rest on a Lysa [Applause] when the critics can say that then you know you don't accomplish something but then you still stay humble before God because they know where to go when you look at these lashes ministry they know exactly where to go something happen they go to you Liza you know your testimony as soon as something happened God has done too much in our church was not to be sharing testimonies but as soon as something happened the reason people are asking you to pray first let me say it to two things is good that you bring the prayer requests but I'm looking for one day the praise report let me make it clear the praise report is before apps up not just I takes it my church we pray for you no no no you know what let's pray about that right now you take the responsibility you pray and have them testify to you like they did with sister Michele right I mean she stopped and prayed and they say the lady went to the hospital was released just like that and they come telling her how her prayer changed things when you find your place in Christ you can do them things so rather than a play a prayer request let it be a praise report we stopped we prayed and and that's what happened we just want to give God the glory I'm not trying to make myself nothing and and let me tell you when you give it a test run it don't don't even say well I'm not trying to make my suddenly we already know that we already know that you ain't nothing anyway ain't none of us nothing we were 80% [Music] [Applause] but it's fine in our place in price and realizing that we have this authority as sons and daughters of God we're carrying on the ministry brother branham's not here we've heard the testimonies they should awaken something in us if you get into the Colorado storm and God tell you to turn around and go back we'll go speak to it now the Prophet was also running to he was running from the killable he was looking for his gun huh so so he tells us just as a just human nature was kicking in when that brother saw Cheryl talk about how they coming to them a nest of bees oh and he told son just don't fear I said no no no no brother I heard that testimony folk it once stayed exactly the same where you said it but I heard that before that tell me that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today about see this is what we mean by the earnest the earnest of of our adoption we are we're walking in that now we might not go around and tell anybody I'm adopted but we are walking in the earnest of it right we're walking in earnest and like I said with witness the public on public display your critics will testify for you when there's a situation they can't deal with it a church do you know how to deal with brother Branham one man that can't figure out what's wrong you need to go go see brother Branham you heard first they tried to take him in this church couldn't get it next Church it you need to go see brother Branham it ought to be the same way now because the Spirit of God is moving so great you know that look searching the cone I go visit them I'm just telling you you know they took they share with me some testimony I'm just telling you I go visit them if I was you we're waiting on the on this and and you got to know what the same just cut somebody walk up in here I'm gonna be free okay alright top with him first tell me a little bit about your life tell me how had it had it how did this happen you know yeah what's this huh do you know Jesus now I'm gonna tell you some will pray for you and you do not have to be a Christian to get friend ain't that so beautiful you don't have to be a Christian to get prayer no God loves you he loves you he died for your sins and even even have to be a Christian to get prayer you know you only have to be a Christian again to get healed but if you wanna keep if you want to keep your healing now we're talking something different you want to know why things come back on your body because you want serving God that we use for the surgery Oh God uses our sickness sometime to drive us into his presence oh that didn't i brother say that last night you know your worst situation is Gerren I beat your best so listen the earnest of adoption brother Brown say the earnest is is the down payment it's something to hold it all right he said divine healing is the earnest of the redemption of our eyes okay and it says he says another statement says we are now drawing on their earnest of our salvation now in his day he gave an example of evil one to buy a car and you all you had was the earnest money to down payment say now you can hold the car and his day in his day you could give if the car cost three thousand you went and gave the man five hundred he will hold the car till you pay the rest of it off and then you take the car wing but it's a new day it's a new day right back then they didn't have no debt problems like that you either had it you didn't have it but not because of credit because of credit you can actually give a down payment and they still only come but they give you the benefits of driving the vehicle and showing the beat and they don't even give you no limitations you can go as far as you want to go long as you make the payment the day you stop making the payment is the day they come get that cop but as long as you making the payment till you pay it off you can enjoy full benefits and what I'm saying is until we get our body change I won't take enjoy full benefits of adoption another statement that profit makes you say the earnest means more is yet to come I'm looking for more see you know and and I mean I'm just giving you just a little statement see me we're promised that true stars feel some born sons will speak and have our word back I'm looking for that we're promised that if a brother needed rain for his crops that we could give him rain I'm looking for that we're promised that we will stop sickness and disease is saying that's the power to bind and loose guess what I'm looking for that we promise to have checkbook authority our names are supposed to be as good as the father's name on the check now you want to know why your name is as good as the father's name because everything in heaven and everything in the earth is named what if your name has changed oh my then your name is as good as the father's name because you've actually taken on the father's name and here's another one here we're supposed to be a super Church a super race as we near him can I just drop off something here and I'm gonna have to let this go I got more here but I'm gonna let it go oh my I hit that I hit that two or two or three more pulses and I'm gonna let it go y'all up there with me adoption part for this is paragraph 76 I want to read this adoption part for now this mean this may just choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are a mature garden men that are sons of God are not will be are are a mature God's says how many ever know that now you know can you imagine a prophet sitting there preaching this and they like I never heard preaching like that in my life men that are sons of God are amateur God's how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said so the Bible the Bible Jesus said did not your law say itself that you are God's and if you call them gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were cows because they were had full domain over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but look at this but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again now that's why I said not just let up said my say the revelation of son of God because when the revelation finally strike us we don't stop letting the devil do everything that he's doing right when the revelations frankerz we don't go back and take it the devil give this to you we're gonna have to take it from the table you've been holding on my property a little bit too long yeah that's that's mine that's mine that's that's mine it does not belong that it's all my god Jesus died to give me that I mean if you knew if you knew so I'm gonna get family passing left me a million dollars maybe be fighting with everything you had to get the money that was left of you you wanna be sitting back well we're little Lord we little Lord I don't know what the will of the Lord it the will of the Lord is that's my money and they're gonna give up my money if I have to get the police and no police I'm gonna get what's mine lawyer no lawyer I'm coming to get it and that's the way you gotta feel about your god-given privileges stop letting the devil a man strip you of what God gave you we're waiting we're waiting for the sons of God to get an attitude and go and take it back take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the fool sums of got will be manifested when the power got we'll walk out and hallelujah will take every power that sentence got away from him yes sir it belongs to him sorry by the manifested son of God all right let me go and I got another one here Oh glory you know there was one here I got to find it because I I was listening to the tape and brother branham said this and I said no I got to read that for the church oh I got a couple of that I need to read but y'all just bear with me I feel yes this one adoption part 385 this is that's the one I want now adoption correct part three part I mean the quote number 85 adoption placing positionally where they at show me where they're at God calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it so you're apt to say nothing about it but your critics would know it right they don't have to say one word about it you see something's happened positionally placing placing his son getting him and to order just exactly what the same things and he's just as in much authority his word it's just as good as an arc angel oh yeah I don't know who y'all are your words AXA for money say just as good as an archangel then he says better that means your words are greater than the arc angels words you realize how much power you have inside of you that's so much power that you can create your own world and go live on it your words are more greater than an archangel the son was adopted put on a place set out there changes rule changes colors the father had a ceremony this is my son ferments fourth he's governor he's the ruler he's over all my heritage all I got to belong all I got belongs to him that's right okay now let me oh my I'm just there's one other little statement I think imma have to just I'm gonna have to cut it and bring it back I got so much more here to read y'all just bet let me give you this one last one a man and then I'm a lord have mercy lord have mercy thank you brother Jeff this read me up mother cuz I got just I just need to show you a couple things right alright here here here's our out of Patmos vision because you know and let me just kind of set this one up when we when we put a lot of emphasis on the Prophet and not on the on both the prophet and the bride cuz its period in the bride right spirit prophet in the bride they're gonna say the same thing and we're not going to say anything outside of what the Prophet said but but when we just put it all in a prophet not get give you know credit where you know hey y'all got something to do with this - right so when we do that we kind of miss some things here and and and they're you know like like like there's a statement that was made brother Brandon was told when he went to the other side oh that you love and all that ever love you I have given to you and people say well that was to the Prophet I understand you God did said to the Prophet but when he said it through the Prophet to me the secret things belong to Lord our God but once they're revealed then they belong to me so I take that same promise hallelujah right if I got a love when I mix back I wondered I love I'm expected in the be on the other side see the Prophet God allowed me to look into another realm to see certain things he could come back and three of things that he's thought because we believe our hearts can be comforted now let me just give you this cold out of Patmos vision couple more listening this comfort this comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only discomfort I'm just reading you what the profits in this discomfort is not for the seven church age lesson just only every true believer is in the hands of God and can draw oh my god the artist of our of our adoption we can drop right from his love not just his love and power so even when evil not even I just gave him a little down payment on the car I'm still enjoying the benefits I'm driving today every day I'm making payments on it but I'm driving and going wherever I want to go in that car that's not mine listen listen sake sake sake take control from the southern power and receive the full benefit oh I just feel there look I'm not a part-time worker part-time workers do not get benefits when I join I came full time when I go patient I'm expecting the still get pain because I'm a full-time worker I'm expecting the 401 K I'm expecting full benefits kids get sick I can take them to the doctor because I got full-time benefits [Music] if your job can you do that what you think about so God giving you that I believe them that we're missing it because we don't feed on it we can draw from his level of power see the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example [Music] [Applause] is an example no just to some of y'all to say for everybody this no this is this is only for one or two people no you ain't reading the same message that I'm reading you're not listening to the same tape that I miss them too if that's what you're getting out of it it's an example to all believers of His goodness and care too and he put it capitals yeah the Prophet is trying to bring attention to this when it's our brotherly leaving not that part capitalized to all members of his body amen this is this is why we're trying to bring the revelation of the sons of God right because when we get when we start feeding on it and then the revelation become real to us we act different we talk different we walk different we live different our expectations are different you know for me I just want to sit around and just meditate on this it's something that I'm missing in my life God and I'm supposed to you know it's not just gonna be a Sunday morning come here message and hear a few quotes and say hey man and you know leave no no no no no no no no no no there's a situation that I'm about to walk out into and I need this to be quickened to me I need I need I need this to rise up in me that that I don't run from the devil but I can be like David Haye I don't run from trouble you started the trouble I'm running to you who are you who is this uncircumcised philistine that's challenging the armies of God what if this sickness come from I've been do nothing to get this sickness I want to know where it came from well where it came from is going back to where it came from it's time for us to speak in our word is that please God somebody we'd ever know who we are it's time for the revelation of the sons of God we must recognize who we are let the devil on the run stop running from the devil [Applause] [Music] hallelujah Church we're not supposed to be the feeling about this don't let these folks just kind of just be quotes right sometime I think we miss it even sometimes the minister they put the emphasis in the wrong places what are we doing do we see what the Prophet gave us here oh my god this what he said if we just take time and just read it right I mean you know here I can I get you know like I said I could've just kind of because when it started Gators but I said no let me slow down read it because it was supposed to people see it oh it illuminates what he said all the members that means me that means you so if he can speak to a storm if I'm in a situation now don't get me wrong don't be running out here trying to empty out all the hospitals right don't run out there trying to go in then put up a that's not what we talked about that's not what Jesus did he went he went down here to this Pool of Bethesda there's one man all these sick people everybody see and one man we'd be may hope he got he said well I would you know but so you got me and i'ma tell you God not even interested like that let me put it this way God not interested in your excuses [Music] [Applause] amen all right easy success I say say yeah but every time I try to do something somebody always getting in front of me say look I'm not even action two more questions rise up take up your cot walk go home he didn't even then just didn't say nothing didn't tell him his name I want to leave my business cart with you so you know who just prayed for you led by the spirit go pray and just move on and Jesus prayed and moved on and the man was so dumbfounded as they make the igloo see the critics knew something that happened Cadiz carried his on the Sabbath day whoa we got two problems you carried on the Sabbath day and you heal who healed you the man had no idea he didn't even know the name of the person who healed me say I don't know God just told me to take up my car and I just took it up and I and I'm healed so after he left him he found his way back through the crowd and jesus walks up to him and has another cut now the reason he could tell us Jesus because he knew divorce and you knew the face he didn't know the name when he got here say he said now go and sin no more the less the worst thing coming pain who is it that's Jesus oh I know who healed me jesus healed me but he had no idea who he was this is why we stay humble with this we know who we are in Christ this revelation is breaking fortress we're understanding this more and more hallelujah I got a I'm gonna leave y'all with a scripture and I'm not gonna even touch it I come back and hit it later on i'ma hit it later on this out of first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 therefore me a scripture but I want to read it two ways then I'm a leaf to better set us up my part to look at this but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light now leave it right there and I want y'all to stay keep reading in your Bible but I'm gonna read it from the emphatic dialog you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for a purpose that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful life let's pray father this revelation of the sons of God is something that we know the Holy Spirit is trying to bring to us trying to bring clarity and understanding prophet said that uh oftentimes we get our are our pipes clogged up with domestic affair things that happen on the job things that happen in school things that just happen in life we get our club our pipes all clogged up but it takes the Word of God to come in this manner and to unclog the piping that the Spirit of the Lord might flow freely in our lives and in our situations God you're calling us to higher heights deeper depths greater things and we ever even imagine you're calling us there and we know that you're not wasting your time you wouldn't have a sitting and sit in a place like this to hear such words if you didn't mean for us to come to this so God our prayer in our desire is that you would have the Liberty the freedom amen in our hearts and in our lives to bring us to this perfect place in you we don't have to accept everything that the devil does we are true sons we're born sons with fill sons our word is supposed to be backed my God if we only realize that our words are even greater than an
