11th Hour uh on the 11th day uh in the 11th month amen so they called it Armistice Day and uh I think in 1954 it was changed from Armistice Day uh to Veterans Day and uh with that I just want to read this little statement from uh God's Prophet Amen in honor of our veterans um because um I believe we all have uh benefited from this service but we also amen benefit from a another Armistice Day amen uh here he says to us as I come in the door I heard brother beer offering prayer and was thinking of him being a veteran and this being Armistice Day and of course we all glad that there was an Armistice Day and there can be there can also be uh an Armistice Day here in the church uh that when people who have been at war with themselves against God can sign the AR this today and have peace with God through Jesus Christ I believe Romans 5:1 said therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen we thank God for the natural Armistice Day amen but

Mark Lord Brother Quinton Jr Lord Brother Solomon and our brothers and sister that minister in different ways father Lord Jesus Christ everyone is a minister in the house of the Lord father mothers Lord fathers Lord parents Lord they do minister to their children Lord and when we go out we step outside this building father Our Lives Minister father to the people outside in the word Lord Jesus the Lord help us the Lord the ministration will not only be in this Tabernacle but Lord it will be wherever we may be Lord among our neighbors Lord in the workplace Lord among our family father I pray

Christ's name we pray amen God bless you may take your seat glory to the Lord our lord is good amen and we want to just Minister a little word restoration trying to Pig it uh Pig it back from brother brother Jack what he preach and the ministers what he been preaching so my topic is not going to be different it's going to be rest Restoration in completeness amen that when the Lord start a good works he brings it to an expected end yes sir when the Lord restores he restores completely am he restores your family he restores the number one restoration is eternal life what you had before the foundation of the world but because we were born wrong we B it but it's always in US amen and then the time comes that the Lord restore that life am that has no beginning has no end into your heart that's right and when you get that life to begin with every restoration is possible L amen amen so the biggest greatest Resurrection is restore eternal life to the church amen and when I talk about the church don't look at this building look at the people in the building look at Sons and Daughters of God here and outside here amen amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord and I just want to share a little H just give you a little um report on the Pu Puerto Rico trip we went I think a couple of month ago with um a couple of Brothers brother Jos Abigail Linda brother Quintin Senor brother Mark and brother Jeffrey and it was a wonderful trip H we had brother Mark to minister to the Brethren the Friday that we arrive I think we arrive on Friday right that was probably his first Ministry outside the US it was such a blessing to the Brethren and the brothers asked brother Jeffrey to give a testimony of how he received a message so we had brother Jeffrey for the first time ministering in brother Marco house one of the brother's house and the whole congregation were around and he ministered read a Bible give a testimony of how he came to the message and then ministered the word of the Lord to the people it was a blessing so the the Lord is wonderful sister Abigail gave a song to the church and they enjoyed the song from sister abigil and sistera it was just an awesome time the brothers were happy and they said extend the invitation to every one of you H if you want to go to Puerto Rico they receive you with open arms so the Lord is good so let's come back to a restoration incompleteness like I said brother Jack has just been just gone through so much amen and I just want to just just piggy back from it so with your permission just to take a little from the restoration so I want to go to what is is restoration just go to the fundamentals of restoration when you said restore what does it mean restore is bringing something back to the original position like so here additionally said restoration means the action of returning something to the former owner right let's say oh don't don't worry my computer is used to falling so I will take it when I need it my computer myself they fall like I don't know million times a day myell phone the cameras are all gone because of it falls like 10 times a day thank you God bless you thank you so restoration means action of returning something to the former owner something that you have already let's say I have this book and somehow it got misplaced it got missing and then I look for it I find this book and bring it back I'm the original owner I repossess my book and then place it where it's supposed to be amen and Resurrection is the same thing you belong to the Lord Jesus Christ you were never the devil's property you never belong to the devil but you just got we got missing on this Earth we lost our way who we were am what we meant for this for this day amen but the Lord our father was always looking for us and he knew exactly where we were that's right it didn't matter where where you are Glory it didn't matter where how far you went yes in the in the economy of God you were always in the palms of his hands hallelujah amen you might look at somebody and you say this person is all messed up there's no mercy for him you might not even give him grace and mercy you might write him off you might call him a serpent seed you might call him a vagabond you might just describe him whatever adjective or adverbs that you want to describe but in the economy of God when you see this son of God messed up all of I mean from from head to toe all his or her life God knows him or her as my son my daughter God doesn't see him as a vagabond as a thief as a prostitute as a criminal he sees him as a Son of God because before the foundation of the world Christ Jesus was the lamp of God that was slain before the foundation of the world for that son and daughter of God amen amen and God has already redeemed him is just a matter of time and so Redemption is bringing you back to the or owner the place condition or the original estate amen where you supposed to be right you were meant to be a Son of God a daughter of God and Sons and Daughters of God what did they do if you bring forth a child yes you give him food as a baby giving breast milk right and all too too long you start teaching the the child how to talk all right because human being talk you might teach him English Swahili French Creo whatever language amen that you you speak you teach your your child to speak the same language you even go further to teach him other languages because you want your daughter to no more because you're a human being you teach your son your daughter how to eat how to take care of thems how to wear clothes how to put their shed the socks and things on when they get to S you teach them how to drive because human being you drive so that attribute you impart it to your daughter and your son and the Lord Jesus Christ does the same thing he speak into creation amen he speak out of creation amen he speak blessings healing eternal life into creation amen and he speak diseases sickness sorrow negatives out of creation so the Lord tries you put you in fire put you in Trials to bring the attribute that is already in you how to speak into creation not only speaking but how to think into creation amen there are certain things you don't have to speak you have to pray but you just have to think it from your heart and it comes to your thinking and as you project the thinking it becomes manifestation that is the god that you you that God that you are amen because you are an amateur God on this Earth so restoration is to bring you to the original position as a Son of God and as a daughter of godl and I think when we say Sons and Daughters of God we don't go deep enough we just take it shallowly oh I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm supposed to live holy to dress good to those are good but that doesn't make you a Son of God a daughter of God is the one that has got the attribute the nature the spirit of Jesus Christ in their heart amen amen so the first restoration if you want to go into scriptures is act chapter 2 verse 38 praise God repent amen amen in other words transform all right get away from where you've been lost in your lost estate and come to the original estate amen where God your father meant you to be where Elohim elsh your father and your mother meant you to be to be a Son of God because without the spirit you can manifest certain things but you are still not where you're supposed to be that's right you might have the gift which the Lord give it to you without even repenting but you are not in the image of the Son of God so want to give you his spirit amen by the new birth amen and this hour I want you to go into your heart your heart is going to be the pulpit amen not the wooden wooden wooden uh structure here so put your heart as a Pulpit and ask yourself do I have the Holy Spirit baptism in my heart you have to question yourself and answer to yourself right do I have Christ on the inside of me Hallelujah yeah and if I do have Christ on the inside of me does Christ manifest on the inside of me because there's no two ways if Christ is on the inside he's going to manifest himself on the outside there's no way that you have a g to produce black hair right and you're going to produce gray hair or Grizzly hair or what is other other hairs that give me some of the hair types come in curly curly hair right if you don't have curly hair is not going to be kellly but if you you have the G to have to grow kellly hair you definitely going to bring kellly hair if you have the Gin to bring bring H all the attributes is going to come out of you so if Christ is on the inside you can't tell me Christ on the inside and Christ is not expressed on the outside so you have to make Assurance doubly and triply sure that Christ Jesus is on the inside of me quu amen Christ Jesus is on the inside of you amen amen so the first thing that Jesus begin to tell the people when he came on the day of Pentecost that repent amen it wasn't Peter speaking it was Jesus Christ speaking through the lips of Peter repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you the rest is not your part the first part is you repenting right seeking get married to him in the form of baptism all right take away your name amen I'm not taking about your Earthly name name is a nature do away with your nature and then let the nature of Christ take preeminence in your life amen that is repentance that is restoration and when do you do that the rest is going to bring a new life Glory that is the life of Jesus Christ in you that's right the Heavenly life that you had before the foundation of the world that you were robbed because of the sex birth sex means Satan and if cross Satan means sin in nature yeah but Christ want to take away the crisis because a life without Christ is the life full of Crisis Christ want to take that crisis out of your life where you can't even get along with your own self you can't get along even with your pets you can't get along with nothing nobody you can't hold a job you can't keep a marriage you can't keep your family you can't keep nothing because you can't get along with yourself how are you going to get along with others all you have a temper like a jet flight oh you can't get along so Christ has to consume Glory that nature and bring his nature in your heart Hallelujah then you begin to manifest as a daughter of the living Christ that that nature is consumed and is no longer in You by the nature of Jesus Christ God patience love joy Temperance forgiveness faith it just come automatically you don't have to Crown it you don't have to cram it you don't have to stress it out that's right but God on the inside manifest himself in your Tabernacle glory to the living Christ let's go let's go go ahead with the definitions right that is resoration let's go to definition of completeness completeness is the state or condition of having all the oh let me go completeness means as an entirety totality right of something the quality or state of being without restriction no condition can tell you not to do that wow because youve got Christ on the inside without restriction exception and qualification amen the world doesn't restrict you Satan doesn't qualifies you nothing tells you how much you can go in Christ you can go as much as Christ will let you go because you you are an eagle you don't have restriction you can't tell the E that you can't fly above 2 kilom or 2T above the skies no an e will fly as long as the attribute in him as an e will let him fly you can't tell a child of God that Divine Healing is not for you no you can't tell the child of God that blessings is not for your family no you w accept that the whole Redemption the whole restoration and all the attribute is for you and your family and also redemption or sorry restoration has got parts right Resurrection has to have a source An Origin right Resurrection doesn't just draw from the sky Bo there resoration amen it has to come from a source everything has a source and where is the source of restoration the source is coming from eternity the source is coming from Christ Jesus the source is coming from your father and your mother Elohim himself that is how you get your restoration amen and then restoration has got two main components it's got the tertial components and it's got the celestial components right let me take it from from bottom up the celestial component is who you meant to be before this before the foundation of the world but you never had even even known you just live your life the way you knew but a day comes when the mother eego speaks to you that you are not a drunker amen you are not meant for the battles right brother you are meant to drink the wine of the Holy Spirit you are not meant to be a presstitute glory you are not meant to be a street girl you are not meant to be a dancer you are not meant to go to clubs you are not meant to be in sickness you are not meant to be a thief you are not meant to be a criminal you are not meant to be an American meant to be a ghanian but you are meant to be a Heavenly son and daughter of God Glory Hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah amen my my my that's all right brother amen and those attribut begin to come out of you yes sir because that is who you are amen amen you are meant to be a Heavenly being right that is a Celestial being that you can create you have the gift to Pardon sin God has authorize you to forgive sin that's right amen that's right somebody can sin against you somebody can do something terrible and you've got a power to speed them out of creation you've got a power to put sickness on them you've got the power to put blindness on them you've got the power to hold grudges against them but you've got a better attribute a higher attribute a Celestial attribute called forgiveness and you forgive them from your heart with no restriction amen you forgive them and bless them amen you don't forgive today and then bring the grudge back tomorrow no you forgive and you forgive completely and you pray for them and you lift them up that Lord he doesn't know what he's doing remember your father Jesus Christ on the cross that's right nobody has died terribly like he died nobody has suffered like that in his death like Jesus Christ that he couldn't even he he didn't even look like a human being anymore the Visage wasn't like a human being his body was was was I don't know the word to use but the body was just he was tormented he went through Agony he went through suffering he went through brutality that no human being has suffered like that in his life but he did that for you amen and what did he do said father he spoke to the father in his heart they P of fire in Him Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing and that attribute in you regardless of what somebody does against you Jesus you have the power and authority of Jesus Christ to forgive them and even the more difficult is the person that is closest to you your brother your sister your wife your husband your children your father your your church members different things and God will permit it to bring the attribute so that you can forgive and put your hands around your brother or your sister and say brother I love you let's don't even worry about this I don't even care about what happened let's put it behind and let's Press On In Christ amen amen and you go all your way to help the brother or sister because you've got the attribute of restoration in your life you have been completely restored amen and restoration when you come to the it's got another comp the Earthly component I'll come to it but if you take it as H individual restoration the church and the Earth amen God is dealing with these three elements and let's the individual restoration where God restores you don't look at the church don't look at the Earth but look yourself amen because God is speaking to you yes sir amen he's speaking to this earth he's speaking to this family Johnson qu brother brother Joseph that is the restoration God is dealing with so look at yourself what restoration do I need in this very hour God look at your own circumstance Lord what can I be restored to your family your children your parents your brothers and sisters your ministry what can be restored in your life that's right among your family that's right among your church among the ministry that fits you what can be restored amen and when you pray God will make you like Gideon amen and the church God restored the Church all that the church lost in the after chch God planted the seed that's exactly right of eternal life right of blessing amen and all the night gift in the church amen Jesus Christ put in the church that's right and Peter and Paul manifested this in ad33 to ad55 then the Antichrist came in amen and Jack has done it so I'm just going to paraphrase it in the form of the caner worm P Locust and begin to chop everything out of the church took love Brotherly Love kindness and just rip everything apart amen so the church became chaos that's right but God said I will rest says the Lord Almighty and I would like to read Joel 1 verse 24 is it 2 4 verse four let's go to joel4 okay is said that which joel4 that which the Palma worm has left the Locust the Locust eat eating and that which the Locust had left the canm eating and that which the Canam had left the caterpillar eating so nothing was left but the life is in the sea amen you can eat the leaf eat the branches eat the stem and say Glory Hallelujah the devil everything is eaten I've just eaten all that belongs to Christ I'm the ruler of this Earth but the life itself is in the earth so is the life etner is in christory amen and the right time one is a number of singleness four is a number of redemption wow Abraham the Lord told Abraham started a masterpiece of redemption through our Father Abraham Abraham is father of Faith Isaac is a father of Love or son of love and Jacob is or Israel Grace and then Joseph Perfection so four means there's a hope for you regardless of how you see yourself there's Redemption even the time that the devil thought he has flooded you taking you from your track there is Redemption for you and God is working right time when everything has chopped off your virtues your faith your Temperance your love your families in disarray Redemption is going on right there Resurrection is going on right there and if you come to Joel 2:25 2 is what multiplication amen the former and the latter reain God restores and bring new things in your life and if I Resurrection is even new thing amen this book was stolen from you you couldn't find it and when it's brought back you are rejoicing because new blessing has come into your life and that is the former reain but God didn't end with a former rain that's just a coma it's not a period but it's a latter rain coming in your life new blessings that you've never envisaged new blessing that you have never experienced is All For You amen is part of your restoration Glory Hallelujah to the Lord amen so to his multiplication amen so the Lord Joel 2:25 let's read from 25 to 28 and I'll restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm the caterpillar and the P worm my great Army which I send among you and he shall eat in plenty in abundance and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord and when God restores you do not forgot the Lord amen return thanks unto the Lord in your life in your family in every way that you live amen and that ye shall and you shall and the name of the Lord that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and bra did the job already 27 and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and when I look at Israel don't look at don't look at Israel in the natural they are just a type Israel is you GL you are the supernatural Israel so make it personalize it to yourself the Lord is in the midst of me put your name there and tell yourself the Lord is in the midst of Amen don't look at your condition going to come there and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I'm the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed said twice yes sir not be ashamed 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions which is happening amen amen Hallelujah just a couple of weeks ago amen the Lord just fulfilled the scripture right when his servant was preaching on on on Pentecost on the restoration of the gift bringing was it Luther Wesley Braham William S and all the gifts and the Lord restored right in the church amen because before the foundation of the world the lord has ordained that day that it doesn't matter the school room all right it doesn't matter the the school chairs it doesn't matter the board it doesn't matter the the building God will do restoration where you are amen and as ja was preaching I heard have not they said in in time of William S as Resurrection I hear they were meeting sometimes in a building that was abandoned that's right it wasn't a fanciful building right and the Lord restored a gift right there for them so don't even wait I want to go to the new building to receive restoration the former rain is going to happen right now [Music] Hallelujah and in the new building the latter rain is going to come so don't despise the former rain receive the latter rain receive the former rain and the latter rain whatever the Lord give it to you say Lord here I am I receive it Hallelujah I am merry Lord let it be unto me according to Thy word don't be like don't say Lord this is not for me it is for you whether big or small the Lord is restoring praise God and don't despise the years of little things receive and embrace the little things and the big things will unfold in your lives amen if you see the cloud the size of a rain the size of a hand of a hand know that rain is going to pour amen [Applause] hallelujah God Amen if you see Tong speaking interpretation of Tong and gift Visions going in the church know that God is going to do more than even you have envisaged am don't Bel little what is going on is Christ in action Glory Hallelujah is the same Jesus Christ who does the little things and does the greater things amen amen and things that we read from the Bible and we imagine is like wow this is amazing it just happened like it happened right here Jesus yes sir they didn't have Pharaoh sitting in the church wow they didn't have the high priest they didn't have millions of people in Auditorium right it was just some where Abraham's backyard that's when Elohim came to Abraham Abraham was not in the palace he was the president in in that country Oh Glory he was just in a little ranch a little tent little two pieces house with a servant but Elohim came M came down to him and I remember one day Jack asked me to close the service and I pray that God can service in the school room Hallelujah there's nothing God cannot do do not look at your condition do not look at your family's condition but look at the blessings of restoration Jesus look at Restoration in completeness glory look at the power of Resurrection look at what Resurrection can do for you and your family Glory Hallelujah to the Lord thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ glory glory the lord is good glory amen hallelujah praise be to the Lord now let's look at the key statement Resurrection has an origin a sours two components celes intertial components in your life you need Resurrection in your family in your own life personal life among your family the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and I want us to read uh I think Judges chapter 7 if I'm right brother someone can you help me praise the Lord hallelujah praise God glory to the Lord and the midianites and amalekites and all the children of the East lay along in the valley lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number and the Sand by as the Sand by the seaside for multitude and when Gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold I Dreamed A dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the midst of Midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it and that the tent lay along and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of the Lord sword of Gideon the son of joash a man of Israel for his for into his hand hath God deliver Midian and all the host and it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshiped and returned to the host of Israel and said arise for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian and he divided 300 men into three companies and he put a trumpet in in every man's hand with empty pictures and lamps within the pictures and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when I come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as I do so shall ye do when I blow with the trumpet I and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also to every side of all the camp and say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon all right amen thank you brother Solomon God bless you the sword of the Lord and of Gideon sir why the Lord and of Gideon right you might say it should be the sword of the Lord Gideon doesn't have a sword absolutely but the Lord put the sword in the heart of Gideon amen let's look at Gideon his name all right what is Gideon means one who cuts down fell and heer of trees great warrior oh my God even his name testifies of his predestination the nature of Christ in you testify of who you are so Gideon is a fell a heer in the Hebrew words great warrior and one who cuts down Gideon will tear you down regardless of you are that's right and his family name is called jobal jbal means Contender with with bail or Bal opposer to the rule of materialism and so if you put Gideon and jobal together destroyer of evil anything that is evil that is enemy to God if you come in the way of Gideon Gideon will consume you and that is who you are amen regardless of your trial the Lord permited trial the Lord allowed in in the in the the tri in the way of Gideon and before God will restore God has to do certain things he has to take fear out of you because with fear we are not going nowhere he has to take division out of us because with division we are not going nowhere when the church is divided there can be restoration but when the church comes together with one Accord one mind like in the D of the upper room when the Lord when they were in the basement they had divisions among themselves one who said Lord in the Kingdom let I think one of the parents I forgot the disciples let my children be on your right hand side and the other disciples were mad how you want to be on the right hand side not us so they were fighting among themselves in fight in a family but God the Lord took away all the infight and then took away all the fear and brought them to the upper room and that's where the Lord has pleased you today the infight the backbiting rejections but then we come to together with one Accord one Spirit one heart one baptism One Faith one Christ one leadership one Bible one everything and then the spirit of the Lord will come into manifestation Hallelujah so the Lord has to deal with Gideon Gideon was a cow just like any one of us and if you watch the reading he said the multitude remember the word I saw like grasshoppers for multitude and what at the the the the the attribute is a grasshopper the Locust so these people were coming the midianites and the amales they were the grasshoppers that were eating the the the the the the bread and the corn and the wine that Israel had and what grasshopper do you have in your life today am what locers do you have in your life today Hallelujah it might seem so great in your mind but if you can just reject that mind and look at Christ amen take away your fear yes and let the Courage the fet of Christ comes into you you've already won the battle amen am the sword of the Lord and of Gideon amen why the Lord and Gideon because God is in Gideon manifesting God is God of heaven and his son Adam is God of the earth and God want you to root the Earth God has made you an element God has four element of the Earth the fire the Earth the water the air but it's a Fifth Element what's the Fifth Element is eternity eternity controls all the Four Element sir without eternity the sea will come all the way into the cities and drown the houses but there's a controller who controls the Four Element and he control that the sea you can come so far the ocean can come so far get back to the ocean amen amen the wind can blow so far right stop right here hurricanes can come so far right but God will said don't go this way I've got my angels Around My People in West Palm Beach in certain counties and you can do so far you can blow so far amen amen amen and God will protect his people amen so that is the God we serve let's read H one quotes let's go to 48304 the angel of the Lord verse paragraph two said I know the next thing to happen is the resurrection of the gift to the church and it's the hardest thing I've had to do in this pioneering work is to do this as to is to see the people that God cannot give back the gift to the church as long as his church is divided wow wow wow when the when there's division the devil breaks and Rule and it's a tactic politicians use politicians see a certain message to breing the people they fight among themselves and they sit at the top and Ru you that's right and that's where did they get from from the Devil and the devil use in the church as well the devil cannot bring qu bring fraus bring chaos and you fight each other and you'll be sitting there watching you guys fighting each other and he control you control your hearts but then if you can let God consume that division consume the chaos and then he like a glue bring us together then there's going to be a restoration amen so God has to we away the divisions the B biting I don't want to deal with this brother I don't want to deal with this brother I don't want to do deal with this sister but you can wrap yourself around your sister your brother that is my brother regardless of what amen separate Sin from The Sinner separate a man's or a woman's mistake from the person the brother is your brother his mistake yes as long as we in the flesh we're going to have frictions it's just normal amen sisters fight among themselves Brothers fight among themselves but that shouldn't bring division amen you should be able to let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart and let swe it away amen amen and the best way is to pray for one another amen you can never hit somebody you pray for amen you can never rob somebody you love and you pray for if you pray for somebody you can't hear them but if you don't pray for them the devil can put hatred because of what your brother or your sister did to you that's right when you pray the Lord the Holy Spirit the spirit of the of the of the of not the E the the the dve will take away the head feeling take away the bruces it's like an oil to take away the bruces out of your life amen let's go to the next quotes amen 5941 98 show us the father and it will satisfy us brother Jack will you help me yes sir my voice is I don't want to praise the Lord amen says God can't use anything that's afraid you know Gideon had to send them all back was scared and if you're afraid to testify of your healing before it comes God can't use you uh if you're afraid to tell the people you receive the Holy Ghost don't worry I doubt whether you ever got whether you ever get it or not see God wants Heroes he wants something that's Brave God wants something that will stand up and talk that's not a scared to tell your boss or anyone else Jesus Christ the son of God has saved me from a life of sin so I seen The Bravery in the eagle and I thought well now what makes him Brave and I looked at him and he said I

swallow the squ the eego but he didn't even get bed and took his gun and tried to kind of aim at the eagle and the eagle knows he's got that intelligence that was going to shoot him it didn't bother him a bit abah said what makes the eagle so different he wasn't afraid though I point a g at him right though you've got Grass Grass Hoppers all around you that's right but igle has got something in

back to the original condition amen of what Adam and Eve had before the fall so uh just just wonderful wonderful thoughts that was presented to us and you know even as he he talked about the sword of
