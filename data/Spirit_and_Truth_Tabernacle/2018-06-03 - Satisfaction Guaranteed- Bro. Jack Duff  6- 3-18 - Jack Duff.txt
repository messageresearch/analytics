Christ's name we ask these things amen amen let's give the Lord a hand [Music] there's no one there's my jeans yes No there's no praise the Lord praise Allah Halima me [Music] praise hello there was a old song called victory in Jesus that it's been on my heart and I like to try to sing that with this way I heard an old war story I was now finally please Lord you may have your seats sister Tina will you come this morning praise the Lord [Music] [Music] god bless you I didn't expect to sing that even though I was on the list you know I really have a couple of songs in my heart and I just you know everybody's going through something and you know just hold on to the promises that God has given you doesn't matter how hard it may seem but God has given all of us a promise and with those promises it's up to us to hold on to them when you see people walk away your family your friends you know just know that God said it's you in your household and you just hold on to that and even when you feel like your faith is is is losing its grip on that promise just reach your other hand up and grab hold of that promise even more it's so just going to sing this song God is my everything y'all gotta help me say it because they don't remember how to play it God is God is my everything buddy God is my everything he's my my turn Oh [Music] he's mine too [Music] [Music] [Music] aha [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you plays over praising god bless you sister Tina here's I everything raise little Josue will you make your way up you amen Holly move my mama [Music] Wow amen to that god bless she sings love the Lord I have a brief testimony to give you guys but actually my testimony is a little different because usually you have a testimony and you want to just say something that you wanted or something that God did for you and like the whole from the beginning to the end I don't have the end but to me that in between it's been bigger than I think cotton when I get today to that you know and I yesterday I was during the day and something told me Cole brother Jack and tell him that you have a testimony and I didn't have like really because the devil's been trying to keep me quiet and I've seen how a lot of you have been giving your testimonies what God has been doing with jobs and and things and the other day we were at the boy in church and the sister just went up there and she just told how the what she was deciding in her heart God just gave her one two three everything in sake how she she wanted so God put that in my heart oh brother Jack I said brother Jack I have a testimonial I really did him but I do you know so basically there's a couple scriptures that I kind of just came across and they've been holding on to and somewhat more pretty familiar and one of them is seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all the things will be added on today well that's that that falls in really really strong with me I mean many of you I don't know some of you know and some of you don't but I no longer work at the restaurant as a pizza maker because my profession I'm a horse shoe fairy I shoe horses I put shoes on the horses and that's what I went to school for that's what I did for 10 years and life took me another way and I was doing something else well God gave me a promise that he said you that's what you do that's what I made you to do and you're gonna do that and he's been making a way there's so many things that he been happening that it's just been precise like the timing how one thing ends and another stars but basically it's been not easy it's been really really hard and a lot of times I see how things go a little bit couple steps forward and then 10 steps back and that's just like in the natural because spiritually I've been standing so so strong and another thing is like the way I've been approaching it is I think that when God gives us a divine promise we need to concentrate warn him then actually what is it that he's gonna give you because sometimes maybe the every soul is just what he promised you but he has some work to do with you through the process and that builds us and then it just kind of just confers to this gives him lets him know the confidence that he can have in us you know and and you have to delight in that this is the psalm 37 it says delight in the that delight in the in the Lord and he shall give you the desires of your heart and it says commit thyself unto the Lord and on trust also trust in him so I've been holding on to some of those Christians and basically there's there's been a way the open many ways have been opening in in and and I've been kind of getting in there I'm over it I've been I spent so much money building what I need to be able to do that thousands and thousands and thousands of dollar have a trailer that I built and I've been putting so much money on it and I don't I don't really see none of that money coming back and I've been just like really really calm about it like sometimes it's been about almost two years and and I don't see like the actual result but I'm holding on to what God has told me and basically I just been praying and and I can stay right here and tell you guys and break everything down for hours but I just want to make one point is that through the the journey that God gives you always just be faithful to him and he'll give you the patience to withstand whatever it is and I just ask God and I said god I know that you're gonna bring me through I haven't even worried about it even the person that I that I actually work with he's just always like you just so calm about it you know and he's been trying and we've been trying to get into some places and stuff and it just really doesn't happen I just keep telling him you know what is God has a guy is a perfect time he has perfect time and if it's not right now then he'll open another door and I've been kind of sticking with that but I just I was praying and I just want to let you guys know that God will give you the desires of your heart and sometimes are what we are at least for me sometimes what I ask God is so simple and so little even like when I was explaining to my coworker what I what I asked for Houston a meal a really and that that feels you but I said God I know that you're what you promised I know where I'm gonna be yeah and I don't know when that's gonna happen but I just want a little taste like I just let me just see what it's gonna be like and and this is not I truly believe and I'm in my heart that it's not like I was outing what he's gonna do just I just wanted that Lord let me see a little bit you know so I just been kind of praying that in my heart and he did just that he did like something's open up and some days that I've been getting up on my own and people have been calling me and customers been coming along and I've been having some days where I got up in the morning and I don't have to go work with somebody or help somebody that I've actually been making my own schedule and waking up and going to my certain clientele and be able to make a choice and be like you don't have to go here but you know what I have to do this for like kind of that freedom that's what God gave me he said you're gonna have your business you're gonna have the kind of things that you want and you're gonna be able to make up your own schedule so that way you can my my my thing is I like to be available for others I like to be able to help others and the brothers have been calling me to when they need and I have not been able to like actually be there and when I do I have to actually drop some of mine things my family and things so I should be doing that I actually been doing it but God gave me a little bit a little taste like that so basically like I just want to tell you guys that when you are trying to reach somewhere don't concentrate so much on what God is gonna take you what he's gonna do is for you but enjoy the the way because it says they live in my waist and if his ways are what he's making you go through because the scripture says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord so if he's ordering all those steps delight and enjoy the the journey that God is giving you and when you get there then you rejoice about that but you don't have to wait to get that thing to actually have some joy and to actually enjoy you can enjoy the whole way there and it's not and like brother Jack said yesterday he was like we're kings and priests so the king you never see when the king is going through something the king is always standing up hi Sally and he might be so many things but you always see the king when he's going in in that car he's going through the thing whatever he's going through you don't see because he's standing like that and he's just waving so that's how we gotta be it yeah we're gonna be feeling down yeah but just always keep your head up and enjoy and accept what God is doing for you whether you like it or not if you believe the scripture and the scripture says they the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by him then he's ordering that and you gotta accept that and that's all I want to say and God bless you know what I'm actually feeling so good right now and I see I'm not saying God can do anything anything anything my god can do anything yesterday and the day before the same I hear do you believe that praise the Lord heart is my everything [Music] God is my all in all

I'm stuck my hair but a couple of things that I need to just make mention of real quickly this is first Sunday so I always try to give you all a quick update [Music] praise the Lord just since its first time I want to give you all a quick update on our Building Fund project and had all my all my notes and numbers not a lot of misplaced it so just hit that light switch for me real quick just I know if I'm not mistaken last last month there was a roughly a little over four thousand dollars that was received a man not building fund I want to thank God for them we have our goal of a hundred and five thousand for this year we have pledges a man forty seven thousand three hundred twenty five and near to date and man we have received 13400 $13.73 give God praise for that [Music] and the remember early in the year talk to y'all about a transfer that we did a four hundred dollars to pay our expenses amen and so I left here today this 13,000 $13.73 I wanted to just quickly mention you can turn that light on for me thank you quickly mentioned don't forget our what we pledged a man if you haven't had a chance to fill out on a pledge form and you want to please fill that out and I'll turn it in and you get to start joining us in men on this journey also we talked about at that meeting about offering a man and how I think 35 people given $33 a man a week would allow us to take care of our Spitzer's and we'll never see that transfer happen again if we all do that a man and that's that's what we were aiming for as well as we were in Fame and for putting some of the money back that we took out last year so I want to encourage you continue to do what you have been doing and and I want to say this because every church no matter what church no matter what size and every church for some reason during the summertime amen the giving slacks off a man things just I mean just goes south and summer but I'm believing that that it won't be that way here a man I just want to just ask

night certainly thank God for the service event there and and Hollywood and you know they um they were we were we were there and I know there was a lot of conflicting events that was going on and they asked anybody here from spirit of truth Tabernacle a few Saints raise a hand didn't know was a set up and they said uh anybody got a song from Spirit of Truth have an angle and so I'm looking right I

easy on the date amen but we had a we had a wonderful time there and the services and just just looking forward to all that God has in store we have us so there CIL's that's gonna be coming up here for South Florida choir put the put something out there on Instagram and just letting the church know all that all of our young people we love for you to be a part of it amen long as you live in a

are we those rehearsals they've been coming up and we'll keep that before you as well so just keep that in mind it would be a couple rehearsals in and June and I think one and that's a lie that we'll have as well fella let's go is going to be doing a concert during those meetings is going to start on a Wednesday night and idea wins a night concert so in the meet the start will also be a part of most of the services there a man enough so just keep those things in mind certainly want to thank the Lord for the Thunderbirds being back amen I've got to have them back I beg God for them a man also know that the the the Kings were away as well so we thank God for them being back safely as well well he's no lower a man and I saw like I said just please keep us in prayer as we prepare to leave on tomorrow amen and we're under a tremendous expectation just a little bit more inspiration you know the Lord has blessed us think it's going to be about 38 of us that's going over a man to Israel and we're just were just expecting God just minister to all of our hearts we need it we need it so just great you know that often times what you hear in the media a man is not really what's happened so don't be too moved by that you know anytime you're going to Israel Israel is a land that it will always be people always coming against it you know people just don't like the Israelites right it has always been that way the Philistines could not stop coming against them but every time they come against the weather god dude defeat them Philistines right so we got different Phyllis tiles to date right but God still takes care of that land there's too much prophecy that must be fulfilled in that land for anything to happen you understand man so your summer safely is running we are right here man little bit ago but God is doing a man and so we just forget me just to solicit your prayers a man for us as we as we travel I know there is one other announcement that I need to make but I'd rather make that at the end of the service and and there's something else I think I have but I don't I don't know it that's why I write things down so I'll write them down but I have no idea what happened but God is good they already announced that right okay yeah I don't want to you know yeah yeah yeah okay they said my it is my daughter's birthday and I'm very happy amen God has given another year but you understand sister Michelle I just you know I know niche already narrows I saw one go you know I'm just gonna go to protocol right hey man see this right doggy your wife you see that she knew exactly weather good look law right thank you and you know everything I had on here I melt boy god is good one thing one thing I miss one thing this would be so thank God for the acquire the fire amen tent meetings we I'm still still blessed by that and we I'm sorry light the fire light the fire but uh but uh we're it was in my heart as we were just praying praying about this the brothers were all in the room praying a man and and you know about I told them what was my desire and brother Stephen said but we need a date just give us a date they say okay and right put me on the spot so we put a date down and everybody start working towards it and it was very successful and you know after that we felt to try to just continue our efforts there in Okeechobee rather than moving at in around all over the place let's try to continue what we've done there so we want to try to in my heart i was like lord if we can get the ten of three times this year that would be a blessing and so we were looking at another date here in the near future and as i was been talking about it with different people in the idea came up a man to do a back-to-school outreach all right where we would provide you know backpacks and school supplies and things like that to so many kids in that area but we would not only just do the baggage through outreach but we'll put maybe the tent around the outreach right so we'll invite on the service again and invite him for some hotdogs and then fighting for some school supplies and we just gonna do all we can to try to coverage right so the date that we're looking at is August 11th I think 10th to the 11th somewhere around there and I just want to kind of get that out before working towards that as we get back and while we were there the tent brothers steamin also mentioned about bringing the tent over to Sarasota so busting my heart is possibly doing that had November and Sarasota doing that in November so we'll try if we don't get the tent up pay man and August will still have some services out there in Okeechobee but it would be nice and we would do to ten and you know the gentleman that came and helped with the Bible's he was so blown away by sister Tonya's testimony that he say this got to be told everywhere it's got to be told of we got to take the ten everywhere I say where brother kill you all dance you know but he told me he called me up and I said oh he said I'd be willing to help fund yeah so I say well praise the Lord you know and so with them having a desire to want to do that then we're going to try to do all we can to keep things moving in that direction so the next the next date that we're looking at doing something is August 10th and 11th so keep that in mind I believe that start let's see the August 10th 11th August 11th and 12th something like that right foot 10 to the 11th okay Friday and Saturday so keep that in mind we'll give him more details as we approach them and man so praise the Lord god bless you and think that's all that I need to mention musicians think I so much appreciate you all got richly bless you we got the best musicians and the message we got the best song label and the message we got the best chair in an essence praise the Lord amen I think God not believe God I just I just got to announce it just in case y'all do not know that was still alive [Music] man he's still alive we got a victory Church oh no way that God thank you Jesus there's not an option is that which all here let's undo well reading is not an option we're given up that's not in the cards more hos or no came from that he'd have been two kids in development since all for me to turn back now a man a man a man the privacy what happened then I understand it give up turn back run live in a stay and that's what we're gonna do this thang attack this women attack that one I'm still standing I'll be a pair of Sunday morning there's a guy down the street somebody a man we standing together a man a man a man my god you just won't want to go in attack all right you see the demo you gotta always be taking blame sometime give the devil blow spring back you know they made you buy please go church all right that's not my son in the day but I'll just let the church say Amen all right y'all stand with now I want to read a scripture here on this morning and my thoughts are kind of jumbled at least that's the way I feel but I know sometimes God allows you to get into a state like this so he can speak and then I was I think brother Homer Brown told brother Danny's demon turn with me to Psalm 63 he told brother Dan this demon he says when you get up there and you preach and you actually feel like man I really did a good job with that sermon they say then God didn't speak it says but when you get up there feel like I don't know what I did I don't messed all this up so that's when God spoke so we want God to speak today hey man Psalm 63 I want to just read here and I did like I said I don't figure don't don't let me forget up doing have something else anything else to you but after I mean after the sermon and man will do that hopefully I won't forget but Psalm 63 let's let's read this a man says O God thou art my god only will I seek thee my soul thirsteth of a V my flesh longeth for thee and a dry and thirsty land when the water is to see that power and that glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because I loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee Wow I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember the upon my bed and meditate on the in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore the shadow that Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the smooth they shall be a portion for foxes but the king a man last night we found out that we were Kings amen but the Kings shall rejoice in God and everyone that swears by him shall glory but the mouths of them that speak lies shall be stopped a man the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer there God we are trusting that you would take control over our thought today may the Holy Spirit God speak to every heart to every knee to every person get glory and honor out of our gathering here today we trust that the Spirit of God would be pleased with all things thank you for everything that has happened thus far in this service and I've God we we just we just want you amen to have your way even now some Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated a man sold David writes these words here in Psalm 63 and he and he talked about and verse 5 says my show my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness a man and and as far as his soul being satisfied it was first thirsty a man and longing for God say manage says my soul thirsteth eat my flesh long with a V and a drive verse Atlanta when the water is and David comes you know later on he tells us that his soul was satisfied right after after finding God and I just wanted to take for our topic today satisfaction guaranteed a man satisfaction guaranteed and and and and and just to make it clear there is no satisfaction outside of Jesus Christ amen you will never be satisfied you'll never have enough amen until you can come in and enter a relationship personal relationship with him and and you know as I you notice there's many thoughts that kind of go through my head as we as we approach this and I'll just you know how we'll just go out and Lourdes leaves us but there was a man Jesus had a time in his ministry where he went to Samaria and the Bible tells us that he had me to go by Samaria and and the way that he was going the the true destination where he was trying to go this was not a shortcut this was actually taking him out the way a man to get to where he was going amen and actually when it added more miles if I could put it that way it added more if I could use these words and all of you put more stress to the situation oftentimes when we look at that on a John fuller a man there there are things a man that that occur in our life that you know sometimes God might have to go a particular direction in order to get your attention a man sometimes they might have the ministry go in a particular direction just to give you attention we could we could have a particular destination this is what we're trying to get to but we're going to have to have to stop and have me to go by a particular way in order to pick this person up along the road a man I hope you with me and I want you to notice that when Jesus said he had me and told her disciples that need to go by Samaria and Jesus mine he knew in Samaria that be one woman a man that he would have a conversation with at the you know at the at the well and you know he began to you know just kind of talk with her and we'll we'll read a little bit of this amen out of junk food he began to talk with her and you know just kind of breaking some things down and just kind of filling her spirit and all of that and as he began to talk with her there's a statement that he made that I want to just read to you here out of John fuller verse verse 12 is that not 13 13 because he asked the lady for a drink of water when he got there and you know and and she was uh you know she just began to talk about water water representing life and things that need to should we going to talk about it and and he began to kind of tell her some things about you know if you know if you knew the gift of God and who you were talking to you say even had Smith the water right you would ask me the words right he'll she like that now you ain't even got nothing wrong with how you how you gonna get water out the will so he answers the question here and away a man that I want us to just kind of see here verse 13 says jesus answered and said in the home who's trying to drinketh of this water so thirst again and when we will meet when I want us to look at that statement this water my god because water represents life and their water represents life and all of you to live if you gonna need some water right you're going to need some water but also I'm going to understand that I want to kind of catch this from a different angle today you know if some people if they water is their career right is some people their water is their profession and that is so people their water is their family their life is bound up in those things I want you to realize that if your life is Belva and natural things you will never find satisfaction in that hey maybe you only gonna find satisfaction in Christ glory to God right so he goes on to make another statement here a man in verse 14 says but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life so again he he only Christ can satisfy the truth thirst now I want us to go in their favor here a man in this in this thought glory to God and I was looking at this woman right why why would Jesus have need to go by Samaria and talk to this woman well I want me to do that you know because it's just kind of here and say the reason that he will talk with this one woman and sometime the reason why God had changed amen that the service again person because this one woman had the ability to turn a whole city upside down her testimony to change many people my God my god and you wanna make my god came up to you because your testimony can turn a whole city upside down that's why he came after you right that's why that's why you had need to get a world by rectly to you and then the seasoning man he has he asked me to get his word to certain people just to kind of get them on the right track and I want I want us to just kind of catch this here today I want to read a little quote out of God's provided a postive up to divine fellowship glory to God just bear with me today a man a man he had purposely had a need for going in that direction glory to God we're trying to find satisfaction a lot of things you know amen some found it in careers some find their satisfaction and in their profession some find their satisfaction in their families some fondant and relationships that but but i'ma tell you none of those things provide true satisfaction your satisfaction can only be found in Christ amen look at this there's a list fake that that's been made here little testifier and poppers given says today on the plane this is coming from Louisville down here taking me two and a half hours of flying and take me all day to make it delayed flames and maybe God had a hand in it now now you know we see stuff go on my life we think the devil the devil the devil no maybe God had a hand in it hey man it ain't always the devil fault God our God orchestrating things putting you and a place to talk to somebody hey Ben serenity it frustrated and and and flustered and all that once you start praying God why you delete me why do I have this flat tire Lord you know who is it that you want me to talk to God Amen right this is the way we should approach that he says it's that taking me two and a half thousand flying and take me all day to make it delete planes and maybe God had a hand in when I got owned Louisville there was a young lady got on the plane sat down by me she said do you mind if I sit here I said not at all and as we went home they were serving lunch on the plane and I prayed and she said are you a medicine I said yes ma'am I am and she said I'm a believer too and she told me of her a certain denomination I said that's nice and I noticed we had a little package of cigarettes on the plane and I watched to see what she would do about it so as soon as the dinner was over she began undoing that package of cigarettes and she fumbled run a little bit and she stuck it towards the mouth and she took it down again and after a while she living up she said you don't mind if I smoke I said you don't mind if I tell you I do I said I do because she said why I said I can't understand why nice little lady with a personality that you got would have to do a thing like that she said oh I get satisfaction out of it and I said that's only substitutionary satisfaction if you would just take what I tell you and we'll turn your life completely to God and then then then I mean there's something that you're missing and you're trying to make cigarettes fill up that logo that's in your heart give you a first satisfaction oh my see so what's in this in that case is a cigarette given her false satisfaction and so people is big career full satisfaction based a profession first satisfaction their family first satisfaction you can either find satisfaction when you surrender completely to God listen they give you a full satisfaction with I mean which will soon give you a cancer under Granger body and you'll be going and I said God made a person the first the first after him and then if they do not except that then the debtor gives them a false conception of pleasure and they try to satisfy with the things on the world she made about two little drawings in a cigarette and she said I'm 22 years old she said my engaged boyfriend is 32 see saying he told me I've been overseas for three months he begged me to smoke no more and she said this is the first time I have smoked missing the plane and she said sir I take this promise now and she put the cigarette out and and that was it to it right so all of the lays that brother Brandon went through it was so he can get in touch with this one look up see he don't need to go through the delays just like Jesus had need to go about some man he had need to go through this to get this one look gonna bring conviction to so she can stop smoking she was trying to find satisfaction in the cigarette now you know what she's not the only one to do that there's many of people today that try to find satisfaction and everything else except Christ and I'm here to tell you you will never find it I don't care how long you go in life you will realize one thing you cannot find satisfaction outside of Jesus Christ hallelujah temporary happiness right smoking cigarettes would produce a temporary satisfaction to come was nerves right and as a promise a evinces that you keep smoking cigarettes is going to create cancer you're gonna end up down an ugly death right healthy can be an addictive as well just buy cigarettes and and coffee can produce a temporary satisfaction right a lot of people find satisfaction ago from Party to party to party let me tell you something you came party forever all right at some point in the party comes to an end and then you're good feelings will come to an end and then go hi are your hangover amen and to feed it you must seek another party I've never hire another tree but because that is temporary satisfaction and I was kind of hit this today money does not provide complete satisfaction they all do it America you know that's why we changed careers that's why we change somebody says money is not going to give you complete satisfaction and you don't believe me that's extra Cholula money will not only Jesus Christ can do that if you drink of this water you'll never thirst thirst again if the water that Jesus provides Jesus Christ a loaf of us satisfaction guaranteed let me a girl to a cool down this message life amen the Prophet tells us this is just now but God in this great economy for mankind has made man in the way that he wanted man to be now a made man to thirst did you notice David said here my soul thirsteth for thee oh I love that as in a dry land where there's no water just imagine that my soul is so thirsty god I'm thirsty for you just like I was in a land where there was no water he must find water or perish my soul is thirsting for thee amen and I'm gonna tell you if I think we all that's when we will get something from God when we get to the point where our soul is actually longing for him put that there put that down for just a second you know David writes in another another passage I believe is on psalm 42 he talks about how the deer a man thirst if the longer for the water Brooks right he longer for now the reason that the deer is longing for water is the deer it's actually being hunted and as he's being hunted a man he get struck maybe in his hindquarters and and maybe they get they turn a little dog elusive him and that duck slaps him and strikes a man and now he's bleeding and that deer realizes he has an instinct he has something on the inside that tells him that if I do not get to water that I'm gonna die right here so that they're beginning alone they may have for water and what's what you'll see the dealer stick up his nose that start sniffing and when he snaps he trying to find where's the closest book and indeed gets to the water that don't you forget about honey and what we try to do is get people to the world let a man sustain it might get them to the whooping a trick that the devil will not baby do does it again sir so you don't thought what when we leave here that ever going to be striking at us he gonna be doing this she going to be doing that but then we got all kind of tricks up this up his sleeve and let me tell you something you cannot outsmart the devil you can't do it I don't care how long you've been around how long you been the message you can outsmart the devil he got something for you amen so you know here the thing of it is we're trying to get people get to the water to drink only Christ can provide that for you only Christ can give you that type of satisfaction let's go a little further here in this cool he says he says God my soul especially now say now God made a man with her first that's a part of a human being is his thirst but God made him a man the thirst is a man of thirst foot to thirst for God and the devil has perverted it and make it thirst for his kingdom for the world do you get it the first and man is godly for God made the man the first first for God and how dare some of you would be so little as to try to quit that blessed thing of first by trying to satisfy that with drinking and smoking and television and running and carrying on and reveling around trying to satisfy that God the thing that God putting you to first for him you are polluting the fountain that God has placed in you to receive your spirit and your it's running it with the things of the world and do not satisfy they never will satisfy and so that's the reason you put a pistol to your brains to blow them out is because that things go the way they do and the words on a great suicide on a perversion and homosexual and the crime that's in the land the way it is because you're perverting the very thing that God gave you and trying to satisfy it with the evil of the world take that blast Holy Spirit of God waste the first thing your soul to come for come for and you satisfied with the nightclub somewhere no wonder you got a headache the next morning then you take a case of beer and you go to the house and sit down and drink it trying to satisfy that God offense that God putting in your soul to thirst after him and take the devil's lot and try to satisfy the first SEC guy put of you is in you to thirst after him how did you receive anything but eternal separation from the presence of Almighty God when he made you to thirst after him David surrendered himself or sent my soul is thirsting like I was in a dry land where those but where there's the water I first reveal God there you are David said I seen the indistinct wearing and my soul first without but for that power well there you are that's the difference and it goes on to make this other statement that's what makes things different is the thirst that God give you if you satisfy it with with with the water come up to me only that's first you come and drink from the thousands of life freely without money without price there's a fountain open in the house of God the City of David there's the fountain let your thirst before certainly it is don't try to prevent it by trying to say I'm satisfied by drinking I'm satisfied by having a date with this girl I'll slip out a little on my husband and I'll go out a little oh my wife you're only heaping judgment you say I'm not satisfied brother branham no wonder there's God dealing with you God trying to bring you to something and you take the devil suggestion and go up with it and that's the way style comes that's how there comes that and that light is not life oh I like that statement that life is not life but the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life amen to them that will receive it now you know when we when we look at this I'm reminded of just a statement that the Prophet made when we've gone through life but I wanna I want to say this amen to just everybody Church you know we've worked with coming through a season we're seeing the blessings of God just flow hey man two different ones the blessing of God just just moving and see I'm when you start hearing testimony our God is blessing in it ignites your faith and you're like oh if God can do that for soda and got them do something me amen and India and I think that's quite all right to do that but I want to warn the church I want to warn the church three things that that actually give a minister of track and not just a minister but church people it's three things that still get you on track Oh glory to God amen your satisfaction has got to be found in Christ can I say it this way don't be compromising with the devil as God blesses you I'm gonna say that again don't start compromising with the devil as God blesses you amen right when god bless me I try to give him more not less and when I will soon oh that's a blessing god I want to give you this more time more effort more in I want to give God more don't compromise Oh hallelujah we need some chick beliefs we need some chick believes in the house you know chick-fil-a will not compromise only something no matter I mean they can they can they can they can produce that to show how much money you can make on Sunday chick-fil-a say the dough gonna be close walking through that land and for all the restaurants open and you looked at everything dark at chick-fil-a if you want the chick-fil-a you don't know about Sunday and God has blessed them for this day my god I mean even even let the the owner or the guidance car that he's passed away but they still hold them to that stance thank God for church we need we need we need people with God bless you and your business be like chick-fil-a oh I'm a sinner see the sex offense section it's not in the money the satisfactions not an achievement the satisfaction is in Christ and if you can't keep that balance the devil come throw up 34 loop all right hallelujah see I mean it's this is this is in every area if you don't keep it balanced even in your family satisfaction I mean I love my daughters I love them I showed up to but they not my satisfaction my satisfaction is in Christ I love my wife shall not do but she's not my satisfaction is in crisis oh I'm saying some things right I mean you know if you know your satisfaction you got to be so locked in Christ that if your family decide to do something different then it don't affect you I'm still gonna do what I'm doing because my satisfaction is in Christ now y'all can come with me or not but I ain't changing see it's a personal relationship it's what God has done for me I know where I came from I know where God brought me from so ain't no sense in trying to do anything else with me I'm just you know they they have some needs to say I'm locked up tied up tangled up in this praise the Lord and if since I'm locked up tied up hanging up don't try to take my bad side I like it this way glory to God women money popularity that's what get a minister now now now now so if we just when you say a minister it would be women moment money in popularity now when we take it as as a whole for the church it's not just women right it's relationships that use a man for a sister never use a man against you right for a man I hear use a woman against a man but a woman here use a man against the woman right and you gotta watch that because that's a trick of the enemy and you will not find satisfaction in that relationship your relationship I mean your relationship with Christ is the only place you're gonna find satisfaction now let's just look at this brother Brandon brings it out in a message I am the resurrection of the life I want to just read this glory to God a couple things I just need to read don't just bear with me here it says this now this afternoon while we're here brother backs us and we'll my brother Brandon for missionary now I could I if I had the time if I had if I had to come time for me to take up an offering for the Lord I could do it but I couldn't do it for myself since but here not long ago there was a great sum of money many of you heard about it was given to me and I refused to look at I want we got a stopping process this great sum of money was given to the Prophet but he refused to look at yeah now you know we you know because we've not heard the blessing plan so much all of us looking for the great sum of money now look I'm not I'm not here to tell you that God came bless you with the money but I am here to tell you that the devil also try to beat God to the blessing how can you tell when it's the devil how do you have no witness to devil I can tell you real quick you start missing church that's the devil right as soon as that thing start start getting in between you and church you know this ain't God brother Jack they say it please don't you know when the devil off your stomach Oh Lord God help me you don't use this thing I mean like little uns okay this quote says I have 1.5 million that's what the quote doesn't say I'm gonna read the rest of the singing the quotes say 1.5 million this is what was offered to the Prophet now if this was you in your business summer I was offering you 1.5 million but they said now you gonna have to do this you have to do that I'm not talking about you know there's some things that you know like like I know and I believe it's a blessing the Johnsons are being blessed to travel and you can't get the church when you're traveling like that right I understand that I understand but I'm saying if every time something come up and you have to miss Church in order to get it and there's a this is a 1.5 million deal and you know and you want to make sure you tell the pastor this is 1.5 million and pastor I'm talking I'm talking think about the church pastor I am think about the ties pastor think about the tithes in the church pastor that's that's what we want you think about I'm gonna tell you something if I sold my soul out for that type of stuff then I wouldn't be thinking about your soul and if God want us to have it he's not gonna have us compromising to get it your satisfaction has got to be found in Christ you know I just this week I was reading scripture just bless my heart I was looking at the Hebrew boys and dumb Hebrew boys you'll notice they're in and Daniel they had to take a stand that they would not bow right they wouldn't bound they wouldn't bow to the image that the king had put there before him and and and the thing that I loved about it and to come to the end of that into that chapter it said after they went through the fiery furnace after God delivered them after they took they stayed after all that if they got promoted them I said wait most people begin a promotion they compromise in order to get the money they compromise but God gave it a promotion after they still if God gave em a promotion after they stood what would God do for you after you stand be a chick-fil-a let's go and keep on reading I've just just thought it's like a warning for everybody I'm expecting blessings I'm expecting it but I'm expecting us to keep it balanced that's what I'm expecting a man that you're gonna be not not willfully missing pastor you know I would come but you know tonight or or the day that it's the only day they can do it this the only day is it the only day is that one you want to be chick-fil-a oh yeah I might as well say it since I'm here you know sometime you gonna have to say no yeah actually God gonna test you to see if you're gonna say no all right and if after you say no and you're gonna be like oh after you say no you know what God don't do and and if you if you if you don't have the wrong attitude your satisfaction is in Christ you find your fire God say okay you said no for me there I'm gonna bless you over here with one that's gonna be a much bigger much greater because you took a stand for me that's gonna be the testimony not that you know well the money no see it's women money and popularity that's what the devil gonna use I'm saying these as a warning now this is a warning sermon here tonight today let me just keep going let me keep going and we always apply it to just the ministry I want to warn everybody watch this watch this because the devil gonna use it I don't get me I don't believe that we should be a poor Church I believe we should be wealthy the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the righteous right I believe we should be wealthy don't don't get me wrong in there but at what cost okay let me go off I've already prayed that God would enlarge y'all coasts I prayed the prayer of Jabez over every business in here all right but enlarging your Coast I don't want you compromising with the devil all right can I go a little further all right listen to this he said that couldn't go for myself but here not long ago there was a great sum of money many of you heard about it was given to me and I refused to look at it I don't know if I were refused to look at it but I'm just being honest but thank God we had a prophet that taught us how to be Christians I refuse to look at it I could have made all of you happy I'm good I could have made all of you happy just pick through now $1,500,000 see and I even refused to look at it see they packed an article of it in the paper that I didn't want it isn't money a man that gets his mom no money popularity and things like that he's surely only outside there's three things I've noticed in reading history that wrecks a minister's life from the start one of them is money the love of it the next is popularity now notice I said that because that's the Bible it's not it's not the money is the root of all evil stop quoting it like that thing what the Bible thing money is the root of all evil no the love of money is the root of all evil because the Bible also save money answereth all things and you don't believe that XF PL x2 City West poem actually a mortgage company you'll cop amen money answer with all things money keep them off your back so you need money but the love of money is something different because the love of money causes you to compromise and and as you compromise you realize that I mean you're chasing the wrong thing what regard the love of money a man is the root of all evil all right listen to what he says he says we can answer directly ministers like from the start one of them is money love of it the next is popularity when he thinks he's something when he's nothing anyhow and the next is women that's right now some of these things the next is popularity the next is popularity do you know you can become popular you realize that I mean look at this fella you have you might saw him gonna need my the man was just saving a baby's life it was instinct he just climbing to trying to save a baby from falling and in one act of kindness conscious man just went and went viral one act of kindness will fire and the man got his citizenship the man became a fireman didn't even apply for the chop all in all in one act of kindness you can become popular like that now that man's life is change if you don't handle it right oh Lord he's gonna be trying to skill a lot more fearless social media makes us popular and so so even when we are when we're drawing on social media what's the intent or the heart of your posts what are you really trying to see what you're trying to do is it to encourage what are you really doing what what's the heart of it because God knows it God knows it and oftentimes we do it because we want to become popular we would love for something that we did to go viral and everybody talked about us that will change your life and it changed your life you know why not oh my god why don't you know oh there's so many things that we could we can say in there but watch that spirit not only does the minister have to watch it but the church also has to watch it listen I'm going on in this quote and I got I got another thing to read here and I'm gonna try to get into something else but not but there's a that he says this Rex administers life from the start one of them is money love of it the Nexus popularity and when he thinks he's something when he's nothing anyhow and the next is women that's right man takes money women popularity that's been the three major things that God had trouble with his children many of the other things that goes along with it too but the main thing is when God begins to bless a brother and give him something a little more than a something another to help the people then the man begins to thank you see Who I am right there he's on his road down you want me you want me to tell you how to get up get down Oh y'all I'm in Kenton that went right right right over your head you want to know how to get elevated get down the way up is go down how are your knees right amen said the way up is there doubt he that humbles himself God will exalt is that right he that exalts himself will be made a base so church you know these scriptures scriptural principles are still accurate I want to read this other quote here because this is going to be something I read this recently and it just blessed my heart the brother branham just turned down a 1.5 million dollars we just read that a man he's now back in that time you realized what 1.5 million dollars was even a date do you realize what 1.5 million dollars is is a blessing it's a real blessing but he turned it down right he had something on the inside because the status on the inside him in satisfaction was not in the money his satisfaction was in serving price now here's another one that I caught something here let's just read this testimony this is out of the message conferences he said the president of the for Rose whiskey was over to our place here's some time ago and she brought her daughter and she said oh the little girl wanted to be healed and she said she had heard about it and she's gonna have an operation and so she said now notice she's the president of four rolls whiskey okay bringing her daughter for healing that you know even even people with top positions on big companies they still need God so when you come in contact with them can I say when you come in contact with them realize that human beings that meet God not just your services they need the God that you have amen God I mean see see Jesus had need to go find Samaria every time you get the call it's somebody that need what you got and you got to realize what you got because Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give on TV not just your services the god that's only inside of you is what they need can I go further listen said let me just leave it there was a time of my life where I looked in the mirror I was forget what I was making at that time but I looked in the mirror I said man I'm a $50,000 that year man I deserve to make $50,000 a year and I said it because I believed it and I've looked I've talked to myself in that mirror and it took me about two or three years and moved to a job and and it was a lab removed to the job but you know and I'm thinking I was getting a setback but actually it was set up for a blessing right and when I when I got the job I ended up getting by two or three promotions in a matter of two or three years and every time I got a promotion it was a 10% race and as I got the temperance that raised it took me over them over the $50,000 MARSOC man I hate it I didn't have my degree or nothing at that time but I said I'm still worth $50,000 and when I hit it when I hit the hit the target then I say well okay now where do I go from here I had no idea where to go I didn't know what to do I'm like okay I knew all the thing I could do it just go just keep going up and the Lord blessed me a man where I finally got to a job and I got so many promotions where I doubled my $50,000 I did that I was so grateful but you know what I found that still what enough right I couldn't find satisfaction in the career right that that's what that's not that's not where my satisfaction was my satisfaction was actually found in Christ and I remember somebody told me so now when you work for the Lord you don't make a lot less okay maybe subtle but I still got satisfaction and here's the other thing that I found this the other thing about it's not about how much I make it's all my knees being men you know that's different when you got satisfaction guarantee that ain't think about how much money but I all my knees bent can I pay my mortgage is my hat is my condo up that's all I need God and if you just do that muck the funk I be okay unless you want to pay it off in advance but I'm gonna tell you why healing paying off in advance sometime because the pressure make you pray if you ain't had no pressure can I also say some if you had a whole bunch of extra money what would you do if you had a whole bunch of extra money now you know the first thing we say oh I would do this for the church you always trying to put God at the 5th everybody everybody else Chuck put God at the top oh I why don't you stop doing that right now that's why I got to see all three you can't make no deal with God your satisfactions gotta be found in him alright let me go on a little friend I got to read this could this bless me so here this decide he said she heard about it she was gonna have an operation so he said oh she wanted to come over here she didn't want to be operated on when else she run in while I was speaking won't to be prayed for right then so she's interrupting the service had to be right then well now she couldn't stay her mother was after her so mother comes in the back of the room set down with an arrogant look so then we come up right for a little girl and went back well a couple days after that the doctor said alright it's a bunch of foolishness I said but she said no I feel fine no appendicitis with me I'm fine and dandy so they went on for five days after a while you see at just as I explained it after about 72 hours the symptom reoccurs again if you really got he'll see healing I'm not talking about miracles so healing and miracles are different right since so healing sissie it's the after if you really got he'll see healing I'm not talking about miracles and it reoccurs that's a powerful thing right healing and miracles are different miracles is when that thing just is banished just like that but healing is a process of time and the same God that does healing is the same guy that does miracles so sometimes someone's going to go through a healing and we got to understand the healing takes time can I go a little further even if you have to go through emotional healing it takes time glory to God it all happened overnight it takes time and you have to give God his time let's go home says after about 70 rounds of septum reoccurs again if you really got healed healing I'm sorry I'm not talking about miracles and reoccurred because the appendix begin as well and the doctor said Oh Lord Jesus if we can catch that spiritually you know if you have you've been healed of an emotional scar something that somebody said is something that somebody did you know you didn't get healed of that scar but you know what somebody else can come along later on and do the same thing and you know that touches that scar again and you have to go through a healing process all over again oh I hope you're kept in that all right I'm going on I'm going on it says every reoccur because the appendix begin to swell and the doctor said now you see now you better go get that whole array of Holy Roller preacher again so then he wouldn't he wouldn't operate but course when there was about $1500 involved he could do it he said he wouldn't but he'd been it right it happened to be a friend of mine on that staff that when they remove open the girl up to take the appendix out there was nothing wrong see they operate it for nothing they just left the appendix there cuz it wasn't even affected in no way and the doctor come told me about it a render man on that staff that helped me up that helped operate now you see what it was she was all excited and then knows just how to hold on to that pain see and there we don't get a chance to explain that then that made my doctor friend told my mother said the appendix is still there they said she needed that appendix and it wasn't infected it was nothing to it at all just perfectly normal pink just oh like it should be now this is the part I want you to catch remember this mama is the is like the leader of an organization the four rose whiskey now notice and the mother became a believer and then she says to me what needs to be done is your ministry is not sit down in the corner with a bunch of just ordinary people no I ain't you see don't you see the devil set you up you don't need to be with it just a bunch of ordinary people it should be flashed across the country here everywhere should be on billboards now look at this statement now that's just what the devil wants that's right see but no I don't I don't want it like that now remember popularity is the thing that would get people and what the devil actually wants us to do is the blasted now don't get me wrong we have to advertise but how will we have a time right how are we doing here this later stage you know brother branham we want and like my mom's cause they even when they come to ministry for him when he would advertise they say they say you see that the the the evangelists a big picture of the evangelists and you can see a little note in us in the small corner say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and family what it does is that we put the attention on ourselves and we've taken it off of Christ how can we bless God and what we do how can we I mean how can we actually give God more glory and what we do that's a question for all of us right how can we actually make sure God is on display and not just us how can we ensure that that that God is being elevated or lifted up and not just us praise the Lord I mean it you know I tell you what rather than me go viral while it's something I do for the Lord go viral all right all right now I want to read this man I want to I want to go to Matthew 19 okay because this is I told you money is not the answer a man for satisfaction holy Christ can provide that the answer for satisfaction if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again that's that's the water that Christ has to offer now here in Matthew 19 there's a story here and brother Branham just kind of brought this out to us as we were listening to the sermon amen come follow me on Friday night and I just want to kind of follow up with that here Matthew 19 let's read this about the rich young ruler it says verse verse 16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what think what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life I said to him why call us down be good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments now brother Branham made a statement about this man saying that when he tells him there's none good but God said this rich young ruler was actually identifying that Christ was gods he had a revelation that this that you Jesus you are God that's why I'm calling you good master right so he goes on verse 18 it says he's telling him which jesus said my First Gentleman if you want to enter to life but if that will enter into life keep the commandments he said unto Him which Jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou should not steal thou should not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself all right said the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet now here's the problem amen here's the problem because uh you know let's go a little further says Sheila said to him if thy will be perfect no one said that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions they said Jesus of this Recycles barely any of you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I said to you it is easier for a camel to go throughout the the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God I want you to catch something that the Prophet tells us here about this young man he was keeping all the commandments he was doing everything that the Word of God told him now so at the time that he approached in Jesus he looks like I mean this is a real good Christian boy great boy this is not some renegade this is a nice boy I mean and oftentimes we don't realize it we can start out real nice but over time lose our focus like this young man lost his focus and we're not keeping the commandments no more oh it happened in his life now I'm taking coz here's what happened notice the last person and last statement in verse bactine thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself Jesus gives us the story of this this rich young ruler and what happened was him before he left this life he went through where he was blessed he turned Christ down he got blessed as Barnes just expanded he had to build new barns and in order to store all the goods that he had I mean this man got blessed after he turned down Christ God blessed right but the problem was is that he died and the Bible say in hell he lifted up his eyes now now our brother branham say when he got to hell there was a conversation that he had with Abraham and there was a chasm there or a great gulf that was in hell and he began to talk wit up wit with Abraham and he saw Lazarus a beggar that was at his gate tied around the same time he thought he saw the man inhale but in Abraham's bosom which we call also paradise but this great gap chasm that he saw he's talkin say let him go just just dip his fingers of water and just come and just just touch he said no no we can't do that we can't do that you know he said uh they said it's great Gulf won't even allow us to cross over they could sit and talkin everything else you said but they say he said what happened with this young man the reason he ended up in that condition is yes when he faced Jesus he was keeping Commandments but at the end of his life before he died he got away from the commandments and the way you can see that he got away from the commandments is because Lazarus was laying at his gate full of sores however Jesus told him he was full to love his neighbor as itself how did he get away from it how'd it get he was keeping he had a testimony I was keeping it but over time we got away from it I'm telling you I'm telling you this right man there's many people that get blessed and get away from it don't let your blessings take you away from what you used to do but don't do that no one knew what you missed it that one God if the blessings begin to move you away from what you used to do something way roll somewhere that the blessings should bring you closer to God not moving farther away from God I mean I was I was just sharing I remember this being as a young man we came out of high school I'm not talking about one of us practically our almost our whole youth group half of us graduated high school and was working that brat with me we had good jobs ha ha no college high school high school working at Pratt Whitney we saw we saw the hand of God because we we we held on to the Lord right we were faithful when we was at when we was at Publix we paid ties at Publix and when we came out I asked who God blessed us with good chops and everybody left Pratt Whitney ended up with something better right what I'm here to tell you that if you keep God first your satisfaction has got to be found in Christ nothing else don't let nothing else take your attention off of Christ if this guard hinder you from being faithful to God it's not worth it can I can I'm a cop I want to make a plan if your family is gonna hinder you from from keeping God first you're gonna have to make a decision and then Jesus say Who that he that won't forsake father mother of this earth that is not worthy to follow me Church don't let nothing come in between you and your God don't let your business come between you and your God don't let your career come between you and your God don't let you don't let your education come between you and your God don't let nothing come between you and your God amen yeah we got it you know all glory to God I just I feel like it's necessary that we say these things like Jesus had needed to go by Samaria I have need to come and say these things amen let me let me let me just read a couple statements that brother branham said about this this young man and come follow me he made the statement system it don't always have to be money right that pull you away from things is they can be other things see anything that we hold dear dearer than we do that call see it becomes like a money to us right it not always has to be money it can be other things see anything that we hold dear err then we do that call see it becomes like a money to us it becomes something that corrupts us let me also he said this says he didn't listen to the to the voice of Christ when this boy was given an opportunity to come follow Christ he didn't listen to the voice of Christ he said he went with this friends I want to say I want to say something he says we're true kids you're all fine kids that you bought your bound to have friends but watch what kind of friends you have if that friend is following Christ go with that friend follow Christ - but if it don't don't do it so there's a statement that I heard last Sunday that my share this with the young people friends are like buttons in an elevator they can either take you up or they can take you down watch your friends the proper girls on the state is it says they're late a man at the gate oh my god that's not just for the young people you know what doesn't everybody you gotta watch who you let come up in your house there are some saints that can take you up or take you down so if you if you find yourself surrounded by people that take you down you got to get out their presence and this is all you got to do you know cuz you know you might not be strong enough to just kick of my pit you get up at my house I know you're gonna do like that right so just all you do excuse me during your room and lock the door and that's it and let them be out there talking to their self I'm just telling you want to keep yourself in is I mean you want to keep your spirit you got to do some things different praise well especially oh man some stuff we invited to our life and some stuff we need to just uninvite hey man Church right but but here here the thing of it is if you when you got people if you if you're not surrounded with people that can keep you strengthened and encouraged you got to get rid of that the dead weight amen all right all right friends are like buttons in the elevator you push it either go up or you push it to come down watch your friends watch those who you flew you're still sheet with praise God anyhow all right let me go on a little further he says it says it says there laid a man at the gate by the name of Lazarus begging for food and Bailey he would have eat the crumbs that swept off not even to the beggar but to the dogs and was full of sores but the man had been so polished in society this is a statement that this I mention in paragraph 77 on that yeah that's good the man had been so polished in society that he had no more feeling Oh God the man had been so polished in society that means he's thinking about what he thinks about right you know you there are certain scriptures you won't post under your name under your identity you got to come up with a love identity to post Scripture but under your name you ain't put no script right there no quotes I'm not identified with the Prophet right it's it but by the man hat they've so polished in society then he had no more feeling look at this he become numb because he rejected that offer of Christ man I'm praying Church don't become numb don't become so polished by society and so worried about what the world thinks of you that you forget about what God thinks of you look at this this is another statement I mean I don't even know where I'm at on this I'm is somewhere in between keep going down now he was in hell he was in hell at this point in time this rich young ruler he said you noticed what he said father Abraham now he still remembered in hell he remembered that Abraham was the father of the Jews he said father Abraham send that beggar Lazarus down here with a little water on his fingers to put on my lips these flames are tormenting he said listen and Abraham saying it is it's I can't do that in so many words and besides all this you see you had your opportunity in life when did he have it when Jesus said follow me but he turned it down he went the way that he could make money oh my and that's all right nothing wrong with making money the Prophet saying that ain't nothing wrong with making money nothing wrong make money but follow Jesus why are you doing it follow Jesus why you're making money right you say follow Jesus right into it and see when he had went the other way with the crowd you find out he said and Abraham said besides all this there is a gulf fixed between you and and he that no man has ever crossed over never will them that are the them that are there cannot come here and these here cannot go there it says it's been pig still managed cost or will cross man look at this then listen at him this is inhale inhale listen animal he wants to be an evangelist then in a folk will turn down they God given Collins all y'all got called us everybody in here got call to do something and folk would give up the god-given Collins to pursue money and I want to tell you the love of money is the root of all evil when you give it up your God give it : like I said all y'all got some EBL so y'all coming and saying your song brings a certain anointing into the sanctuary right your your song does something for the people of God and when you gonna give up your god-given calling you might find yourself like this fella here look at this and then he's inhale and now he wants to be an evangelist too late my brother but 17 that's what happened when God put a calling on your life I don't care what you do that call thing normal where now you can use it for God or you can use it for the demo listen Adam he wants to be evangelists in the call that Jesus had given him to follow him had and to be a soul winner that was his real purpose that's the reason God put him in contact with the people that he came in contact with to be a soul winner listen it says as a young man returned oh my just just bless me to follow him had to be a soul winner and as a young man returned to him again and I wonder further emcee the calling that God that Jesus gave him as a young man and he forsook it it came back to him in Hell Oh Lord Jesus I wouldn't want that to happen to me are you saying nah what's the use of singing like like the light like David say how can I sing in a strange land I'm gonna sing while I got opportunity give glory to God here I'm gonna worship while I got an opportunity give God worship here my satisfaction is found in Christ not in nothing else listen he remembered it that he had five brothers back on earth and he didn't want them in that place and he said sin Lazarus then back to tell my brother's not to come this way in other words accept the call of follow me see but I said if they won't do it you say yes if what were raised from the dead like Lazarus and go back and tell us you see it shows that after we die you're still conscious he remembered Abraham said son remember in your days you see he remember see you still remember you don't lose your memory you remember oh god I tell you I was blessed by a testimony that I heard recently and I don't know if brother dig shared this last week he was telling to me I want to tell you your satisfaction is found in Christ there's telling me a testimony of a man a very wealthy man from Russia and he he was going to a they were going to live meetings of conventions and things of that nature and just business conventions and there was a wealthy man from Canada that would come to the meetings and as they would come and they would meet at these meetings this Russian man began to notice the man from Canada quite often they would come to the meeting and all these billionaires we get together go out drinking but this man from Canada would never go out with him never drink never do nothing so the man notice it time and time again so finally he stopped in one night he said hey how come you never go out with a a I don't live that kind of life that's nothing like from that that's not what I do and he says okay all right all right so he says you know what I got a little issue going on I'm kind of concerned about my son and and and I would like for my son to come and live with you for for the summer just for the summer he says ok yeah he can come you say but now here's the only thing here's here's the only thing if your son company would be you got to do everything I do so can you say that what I mean by that is I go to church and your son gonna have to come to church with me for the summer all right no problem just a summer you can go to church with you well you know the man say ok so he took that he took the man's our son in brought him to his house and took care of him and everything took him to church and before the sermon was over that boy became a Christian and when he went back home his mom and daddy there were certain things that the mom and daddy wanted to do with the boy said no I'll do that no more what to me well I became a Christian I don't want to do that no more and that boys test he actually calls his parents to change look I'm talking about billionaires right I mean they had the money so you know it wasn't that thing for Christ to get money got all in the gains of the money and not it could be a blessing to the church and pramana standing that same brother that got converted is the same brother that one day stole some property and blessed brother G where the house is involved way he made uh he sold some property and made so much money on it he say I'm a paid tithes are on this property so he say the first preacher that come here to Russia I'm gonna give him this time and y'all heard the story about the little bag of candy that brother G thought he had his caring through the airports well that little bag of candy happen to be three hundred thousand dollars cash but the man never forsook his God to go get it but God is not you know God can give you the money but he want to know that you know that you're gonna keep him first your satisfaction is not in the career your satisfaction is not in amen the money that you make your satisfaction is not in your family your satisfaction is in Christ as everybody here put Christ first and and I'm already warning y'all some of y'all gonna have to say no the Prophet had to tear a check actually one of them he told this would then Iran today certain contracts I can't look at it this I can't look at it I can't look at it but God first watch what God do for you and cinnamon that's that's the blessing that I'm expecting after people have put God first watch the overflowed in everybody that they post a duty in not passive you pass it you know yeah passive you know uh if you stop talking fast and all kind of stuff you know and uh yeah don't stop don't stop how do you I mean with you with your hand then you want stutter those fellow not you was faithful you have nothing you remain faithful you remain faithful when you ain't got enough and when God bless you still you know I'm still a a man amen you know I've watched people sometimes God give him a car they was riding a bus walking all this other stuff and then God gave him a car can't find him in church baby well me and my friends what were your friends doing but what y'all doing on Sunday we are what you what oh man man even when you go on vacation you gotta be thanking my church I go to certain places I'm what's the closest Church here I think well how can I get into service how can I get in to uh service I got a preach I just want to go to church right I mean that that God has done too much for us to be kind of thinking like that right oh I couldn't oh I've needed up you need a break from church really really where your treasures are your heart gonna be all songs it's just a warning message to the church I'm expecting blesses I but I'm expecting I'm expecting people not to lose focus in the mystery blesses a man that you know that that you know you don't apply for that new job that new job gonna have you out of missing service you already know that ain't no one god bless you in a madness that just bet this I'm sorry to me I'm just sayin to me y'all might think different but to me is not a testimony it's not a testimony when you got a Miss Church that's not a testimony that is not that income from God that came from the devil and I know some time we hear somebody give a testimony that oh praise God not me freezing gone for nothing that I see right now ain't ain't praising God for that that don't sound right that don't sound like something I gotta do I know how to double act but that know something know how to do amen my satisfaction is found in Christ he's the only thing that offers satisfaction guaranteed a man church well praise the Lord I just one thing oh I did have one more quote y'all just bear with me I'm gonna read this number let this go that man walked away from his calling that day that he had the opportunity to follow Christ and I looked at what brother Branham says here in this message my last quote I think Asylum God commissioned a Moses God commissioning Moses he said this I was read of this and I happen to think about it you should have power after Holy Ghost comes upon you that's what God commissioned his disciples and then when he commissioned Moses said why what is in thy hand let's drop our thoughts back tonight to the god commissioner Moses the Prophet he had done wrong he got away from God he has slain a man he back on the backside of the desert and married a woman back there by the names of pora and Ethiopian and he had two children born to him by her and he was hurting Jethro his father-in-law sheep way back on the back side of desert running from God just like a man running from his calling taking up the material things you know what you ought to remind folks they call him Ramana what they call him you running from your calling taking up material things you know what I mean you know how people have been blessed underneath this inspiration of this word they've written songs they have God has anointed them and some of the songs that have been written the songs that could have went top of the charts everybody got out there but they get away from this anointing and there's nothing that happens in they life nothing you ought to remind people of their calling the gift that God gave them amen let me go a little further it says there's probably a man sitting here tonight that if he just dumped what God told them a long time ago he'd be preaching the gospel somewhere do something don't just stand still if you're not a preacher testify do something somewhere don't stand still if you're washing the dishes why testify to the neighbor get out past and past tracts do something don't stand still once again get doing something and whatever is that your hand use it and I can see Moses that he was going along hurt hurting some sheep one morning probably thinking about the days he was about 80 years 80 years then some people say well I'm too old Moses wasn't when he was 80 so he'd been 40 years got child training impacted on the backside of desert and they get getting him ready preparing him for the surface of the Lord and then there was a burning bush and Moses stepped up to the burning bush to look at it I don't believe I don't believe to criticize it it was a lot of fire burned and carrying on he thought he just walked us out to see what why wasn't consumed and while he was while he was walking up close to it the Lord said take off your shoes here on holy ground here Moses as brother branham was telling us a man was a man running from his colleague taking up the material things and I want to tell you how a man don't be chasing material things make sure you keep your calling and care take something else if you're gonna give all all of what you got to some of these things that God is giving you why can't we get all of that in church some of y'all got gives y'all signal now we give God our natural stuff though I'm talking to spiritual don't sit on your gift round here use what you get for the glory of God amen Church we gotta find a balance with everything we do and I just I just got to say these things I got it I got a latest out because I don't want us to get it mixed up don't get it twisted we don't we don't pray for people a mentor for their coast to be enlarged and I'm expecting God to do that but I'm not expecting for you to lose your focus on God no no don't don't do that don't do that don't do that that n of God all right let's pray and I do have a after this don't musicians generally have to come up and we'll stop the recordings after this after our prayer okay now father we just thank you for this time Lord just a little warning that you put in my spirit that we would just need to share and if it's only for one person then it's worth it but God I know that the enemy is certainly looking to do everything he can to disrupt the body of believers I know that he'll try whatever he can and I know God his job is to steal kill and destroy our job is to watch them to warn the people and just to make sure that we keep ourselves and check in and focus so that we don't miss what you're doing in this hour it's a real definite we're fine we can't put nothing before God we can't put our jobs before God we can't put our careers before God we can't put our family before God there is nothing that we can put before you but you're the only one that provides true satisfaction we turn to anything else like many have turned to drugs and drinking and alcohol and this one girl on the right on the airplane wanted to have a cigarette but God that she could find satisfaction and maybe those things help us to realize a man true satisfaction comes and serving you to the fullest I have just part of ourselves but let us give all of ourselves to your service help us God to surrender amen our talents surrender our ideas surrender our thoughts surrender all of them to Christ the Bible access the question what does it profit a man to gain the whole world in the lose his soul so help us to keep these things balanced God is our prayer Jesus name we pray amen
