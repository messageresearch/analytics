[15:08] um i'm not gonna waste any of your time
[15:11] let's just get straight into the word
[15:13] whilst you're standing i don't know
[15:15] whether they've got my slides ready but
[15:17] i want to just
[15:18] yeah wonderful
[15:20] in the book of hebrews um we we're gonna
[15:23] look
[15:24] um
[15:24] starting from verse 13.
[15:27] the bible says for when god made promise
[15:29] to abraham because he could swear by no
[15:32] greater he swear by himself
[15:36] saying surely blessing our bless thee
[15:38] and multiplying or multiply thee
[15:41] and so after he had patiently endured
[15:44] you obtained the promise
[15:46] for men verily swear by the greater and
[15:49] an oath for confirmation is to them and
[15:52] end of all strife wherein god willing
[15:56] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[15:58] of promise the immutability of his
[16:00] council confirmed it by an oath
[16:04] that by two immutable things in which it
[16:06] was impossible for god to lie we might
[16:09] have a strong consolation who have fled
[16:13] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[16:16] before us
[16:18] which hope we have
[16:20] as an anchor of the soul
[16:22] both sure and steadfast and which
[16:25] entereth into that within the veil
[16:29] appreciate the lord for the word
[16:32] father this is your word we ask you that
[16:34] you can now grant us a context in jesus
[16:37] christ's name amen we may be seated
[16:41] um just want to take a title and for a
[16:44] title i want to speak on
[16:46] anchored by a sworn promise
[16:49] amen anchored by a sworn promise
[16:52] and for an objective i want to be
[16:54] looking at
[16:55] possessing your enemy's gate
[16:59] amen i don't know what your enemy is
[17:01] tonight
[17:02] i don't know what satan has robbed you
[17:04] off
[17:05] i don't know what you desire before god
[17:08] is
[17:08] but i'm one person that believes that
[17:10] when i come to church i must command
[17:13] expectation
[17:15] i can't come to church and expect to go
[17:17] out the same
[17:18] there's got to be a change
[17:20] nobody ever met the lord jesus christ
[17:23] and remained the same
[17:25] if he came across a sick somebody they
[17:27] go healed
[17:28] if he came across a dead person they
[17:30] resurrected
[17:31] whatever the situation was when god
[17:34] stepped into it there had to be a change
[17:36] and i believe coming to church is coming
[17:38] to an encounter with your god so when
[17:41] you come for an encounter with your god
[17:43] there's got to be a change
[17:45] so i want to believe tonight that if
[17:46] you're under expectation there's going
[17:48] to be a change in your life so i don't
[17:51] know what it is that you came for
[17:53] we sing the song i don't know what you
[17:55] came for
[17:56] amen but i came to possess
[17:59] i came to take what god wants me to have
[18:02] can you say amen
[18:04] praise the lord let me just start by
[18:07] reading what the prophet of god says in
[18:09] this story and the message the
[18:11] infallible word of god he said i said
[18:13] wait there was a king one time that had
[18:15] a great kingdom and he made all the
[18:18] rules and laws he was a just man a man
[18:20] of honor and he made rules and penalties
[18:23] of punishment and so forth and one day a
[18:25] slave committed a crime he was brought
[18:27] up before the king and the king said my
[18:30] law reads here that you must die for
[18:32] this penalty i have to take your head
[18:35] and the poor fellow began shaking and he
[18:37] said what can i do for you before i have
[18:40] your head taken and he said a glass of
[18:43] water
[18:45] so they give the slave the water and he
[18:47] was shaking so hard he couldn't hold the
[18:50] water he said now before i take your
[18:52] life you drink the water or i won't take
[18:56] your life until you drink the water and
[18:58] the slave threw the water on the ground
[19:01] i said now what is the man going to do
[19:05] his law says that the man must die but
[19:08] his word said that he is not going to
[19:11] take the man's life before he drinks the
[19:13] water
[19:14] and he can't drink the water
[19:17] now what
[19:19] all right
[19:20] let's pack that and we will come back to
[19:22] it
[19:23] amen
[19:25] praise the lord i believe on a wednesday
[19:27] it's normally a bible study right
[19:30] so we're just going to have a little
[19:31] bible study and then just a bit of a
[19:34] little preaching
[19:35] amen so hebrews chapter 6
[19:38] the scripture says for when god made
[19:41] promise to abraham
[19:43] because he could sway by no greater
[19:46] he swear by himself
[19:48] for men verily swear by the greater and
[19:51] an oath for confirmation is to them an
[19:54] end of all strife
[19:56] now here in verse 13 we find that paul
[20:00] brings the aspect of god swearing yes
[20:03] and he says god saw by himself now this
[20:06] swearing that paul is referring to here
[20:09] the full statement it actually means
[20:12] swearing an oath all right
[20:16] yeah yes to say he swore is just a
[20:19] shortcut
[20:20] all right but the full statement is
[20:22] actually swearing an oath and this is
[20:25] what paul says when you look at um
[20:28] your head just
[20:29] just step back yeah
[20:31] this is what paul says in verse 16. in
[20:34] verse 16 here he says
[20:36] and an oath
[20:38] yeah
[20:40] let me just be sure that this is working
[20:42] right
[20:43] praise the lord so he says and an oath
[20:46] for confirmation
[20:48] yeah so
[20:50] he's talking about swearing someone
[20:52] swears by a greta but he says for men
[20:55] very this way by the greater and an
[20:57] ought for confirmation
[20:59] so the swearing is actually the swearing
[21:02] of an oath
[21:03] now this is very
[21:05] common at law
[21:07] and in this country i think the most
[21:09] common application of this is when your
[21:11] senators take office or when the
[21:13] president takes office that they've got
[21:16] to
[21:17] take the the out of office isn't it
[21:19] they've got to swear the oath of office
[21:22] yeah now when they're taking office
[21:24] they've got the option of either
[21:26] swearing the author of office or they
[21:28] can affirm the oath of office now the
[21:31] difference between swearing and an
[21:33] affirmation swearing is known as
[21:36] swearing an oath
[21:38] that's the full statement an oath is a
[21:41] form of words spoken by a person to
[21:43] promise that they are telling the truth
[21:46] an auth refers to the god
[21:49] recognized by the religion of the person
[21:52] swearing the oath
[21:55] on the other hand an affirmation
[21:57] has the same legal effect as an oath but
[22:00] it does not refer to god
[22:04] now this is the difference between an
[22:06] affirmation and a swearing
[22:09] when you are swearing you are referring
[22:11] this back to the god of the religion
[22:14] that the person who is swearing
[22:16] if it's an affirmation it does not refer
[22:19] to any god
[22:20] all right now and the reason why they
[22:22] bring this to god in in this respect it
[22:24] is because you are saying the
[22:26] consequences of me not telling the truth
[22:29] let it go to god and let god deal with
[22:31] me
[22:33] and that's the reason why they actually
[22:35] swear
[22:36] and you also find the prophet many times
[22:38] he sways an oath as he's preaching
[22:41] you hear him say in in jesus christ the
[22:43] same yesterday today and forever he says
[22:46] you remember it's not me i say with my
[22:49] hand on my bible over my heart
[22:51] it is not me
[22:53] what the prophet is actually saying in
[22:55] this statement is i'm swearing an oath
[22:59] it is not me
[23:00] with my hand on the bible over my heart
[23:03] it is not me that that's actually
[23:05] swearing in earth
[23:08] and what he's saying by by doing that
[23:10] he's saying what i'm saying now is the
[23:12] absolute truth
[23:14] and if this is not true then let the god
[23:17] of my religion
[23:19] take responsibility over this statement
[23:22] if
[23:23] it means i die let me die right on the
[23:25] spot if it is not true
[23:28] then let me die and be utterly lost
[23:30] through eternity never to be found again
[23:34] that's what it actually means to swear
[23:36] an earth
[23:38] and that's why paul then comes and he
[23:40] says that
[23:41] this is the end of all strife
[23:46] hebrews chapter 6 he says for men verily
[23:49] swear by the greater and an oath for
[23:51] confirmation is to them an end of all
[23:54] strife
[23:55] why because if they respect their
[23:58] religion then they would never get to a
[24:01] place where they will swear and say let
[24:03] god deal with me when they know their
[24:05] god is real
[24:08] they can only lie if they know their god
[24:10] is not real
[24:12] but when you know your god is real and
[24:14] you are saying i'm taking this to my god
[24:17] and i'm saying this before god
[24:20] so i'm swearing this before god and
[24:22] that's why paul says when you swear an
[24:26] earth it should end all strife
[24:29] so as christians when we come to a place
[24:31] where we are now saying i'm holding my
[24:33] bible and this is the truth before my
[24:36] god if you're a true christian what
[24:38] you're actually saying is this must end
[24:40] all strife
[24:42] if you want to know whether i'm saying
[24:43] the truth or not when i come to my god i
[24:46] mean exactly what i say
[24:50] glory
[24:52] allow me to get rid of this
[24:55] praise the lord
[24:57] and that's why he says now
[24:59] it's an end of all strife
[25:01] but paul also says right here that men
[25:04] verily swear i'm still on that one
[25:07] verily swear by the greater
[25:10] so when men are swearing we swear by
[25:13] somebody that is greater yes
[25:16] and in reality what you're actually
[25:18] saying when you're swearing by one that
[25:20] is greater you are saying i'm passing
[25:22] the responsibility of my statement to
[25:25] that one that is greater
[25:27] and that is why you have to sway by one
[25:30] that is greater you are saying the one
[25:32] that i'm swearing by is the guarantor of
[25:35] my statements
[25:39] amen
[25:40] hallelujah
[25:42] so the finality of the guarantors of
[25:45] statements is got to be god
[25:49] so when when man is swearing they swirl
[25:52] by somebody that is they swear by
[25:53] somebody that is greater but when it
[25:55] comes to the finality of it then it
[25:57] comes to god and when men swear now by
[26:00] god he's the greatest
[26:02] now but paul says here when god made
[26:05] promise to abraham because he could
[26:07] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[26:11] amen
[26:12] so paul is now telling us that when it
[26:15] came to god god wanted to swear but when
[26:18] god wanted to swear he looked on his
[26:20] left
[26:21] and there was no greater
[26:23] he looked on his right and there was no
[26:25] greater he looked in front of him and
[26:28] there was no greater he looked behind
[26:30] him there was no greater he looked above
[26:32] and there was nobody he looked
[26:34] underneath and there was no greater and
[26:36] then god finally says because i can't
[26:39] find nobody greater i can only tend to
[26:42] myself so then he swore by himself
[26:46] and this is why you find in the book of
[26:47] isaiah 46 he says i am god and there is
[26:51] none besides me i am god and there is
[26:54] none else
[26:55] in other words i've got no one that is
[26:57] greater when i swear i can't transfer
[27:00] the liability of my statement to anyone
[27:02] else because i'm the ultimate
[27:06] so he then tend to himself and he swore
[27:09] by himself
[27:11] glory
[27:13] then paul goes ahead to tell us why god
[27:16] saw
[27:17] here
[27:18] why was god swearing amen now in god's
[27:22] swearing the bible tells us he wanted in
[27:26] verse 17 he wanted wearing god willing
[27:29] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[27:31] of the promise the immutability of his
[27:34] cancer
[27:35] so the reason why god then swore
[27:38] according to paul is he wanted to show
[27:40] us the immutability of his cancer
[27:45] then he confirmed it by an oath
[27:48] now this word immutable
[27:51] it means the state of not changing
[27:55] or being unable to be changed
[28:00] so when god wanted to show us the
[28:02] immutability of his counsel
[28:05] what he was actually saying is that i
[28:08] want to show you the state that this
[28:11] cannot be changed
[28:14] immutable is the state of not changing
[28:16] or being unable to be changed
[28:19] now it is one thing
[28:21] for something to be for for one not to
[28:25] change
[28:26] but it's another
[28:28] for that one not to be changed by an
[28:30] external force all right
[28:33] all right
[28:34] now immutable is the state of not
[28:36] changing
[28:37] but it is also the state of not being
[28:40] able to be changed
[28:44] and that's why in the book of malachi
[28:47] chapter 3 6 the bible says i am the lord
[28:50] and i change not
[28:52] in other words i fulfill that part the
[28:54] first part
[28:56] but in isaiah 46 10 then he says my
[28:59] counsel will stand
[29:01] and i shall do all my pleasure
[29:04] in other words when you read that
[29:06] scripture he says i am god and there is
[29:08] none besides me i'm god and there is no
[29:11] one else then he says declaring the end
[29:13] of a thing from its beginning
[29:16] and from ancient times the things that
[29:18] shall be
[29:20] saying my counsel shall stand and i'll
[29:22] do all my pleasure in other words what
[29:25] god was saying is i'm gonna tell you the
[29:27] end from today
[29:29] and i'll give you six thousand years
[29:31] satan
[29:32] go do whatever you want to do run as
[29:35] fast as you want jump as high as you
[29:37] want go wherever you're gonna go but
[29:40] you're not gonna be able to change
[29:42] because my statement cannot be changed
[29:45] it is immutable
[29:47] i can't change it
[29:49] he can't change it no devil can change
[29:52] it that's immutable
[29:54] so when god speaks praise be to god
[29:57] what is speaking amen it gets into the
[30:00] realm of immutability in other words no
[30:03] devil nothing can come around and can
[30:06] change what god has already done
[30:09] so god wanted to show the immutability
[30:13] the unchanging nature
[30:15] praise the lord
[30:17] of what he had said
[30:18] so he swore by himself
[30:22] amen
[30:23] and paul tells us
[30:25] when exactly that god swore
[30:28] when did god swear
[30:29] he was swearing let's read hebrews
[30:32] chapter 6 verse 13 he says for when god
[30:35] made promise to abraham because he could
[30:37] swear by no greater his word by himself
[30:41] so this is when god was making a promise
[30:44] to abraham
[30:46] amen
[30:48] so he swore when he made a promise to
[30:50] abraham
[30:52] amen
[30:53] now paul takes here an aspect of what
[30:56] god says to abraham in verse 14 and he
[30:59] says surely in blessing i'll bless thee
[31:03] and multiplying our multiply thee and
[31:06] paul then leaves it there and it doesn't
[31:07] give us the full context of what god
[31:10] said in genesis
[31:11] so if we want to get the full context
[31:13] then we go to the book of genesis
[31:16] in the book of genesis chapter 22 then
[31:18] we read the full statement praise god
[31:20] and the angel of the lord called unto
[31:22] abram out of heaven the second time and
[31:26] said by myself have i sworn
[31:31] sayest the lord for because thou has
[31:33] done this thing and has not withheld thy
[31:35] son thine only son that in blessing i'll
[31:37] bless thee and in multiplying i'll
[31:39] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[31:41] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[31:44] sea show and thy seed shall possess the
[31:46] gate of his enemies
[31:48] so watch church he
[31:50] he he swore when he was making this
[31:53] promise to abraham
[31:55] and watch i highlight this was when he
[31:57] was dealing with abraham when he was
[32:00] giving a promise to abraham but i want
[32:02] you to watch something here though the
[32:04] reason for his swearing was speaking to
[32:08] abraham but i want you to watch
[32:09] something very interesting here
[32:13] though the swearing was addressing
[32:15] abraham
[32:16] but yet
[32:18] the target of it was not abraham
[32:22] well i love the word
[32:24] he is speaking to abraham
[32:27] but the target is not abraham what do
[32:30] you mean preach i mean verse 17 he says
[32:33] wherein god willing more abundantly
[32:37] to show unto the airs of promise
[32:42] so he is speaking to abraham
[32:44] but the ones that he wants to show the
[32:46] immutability of his counsel is not
[32:49] abraham
[32:51] he is now looking at the heirs
[32:54] of the promise oh praise the lord
[32:57] so though he's speaking to abraham but
[32:59] the target hallelujah that's where he
[33:02] wants to show they meet a bullet of his
[33:04] counsel it is not abraham
[33:06] he was looking now at the seed of
[33:08] abraham and we are the seed of abraham
[33:12] through jesus we become the seed of
[33:14] abraham so he was looking at you and i
[33:17] so when god saw to abraham the target
[33:20] was not abraham the target was not in
[33:23] that year but the target was in 2022 he
[33:26] was looking at somebody that is in
[33:28] spirit and truth tabernacle he was
[33:31] looking at somebody that is in florida
[33:33] here and he was saying i'm giving you
[33:35] this
[33:37] as the confirmation of the immutability
[33:40] of my counsel amen
[33:43] glory
[33:44] glory
[33:46] amen
[33:48] praise the lord
[33:50] amen
[33:51] hallelujah
[33:53] so
[33:54] it's not targeted to abraham
[33:56] but god wanted to show it to the seed of
[33:59] abraham
[34:01] amen and then the target being the seed
[34:03] of abraham and we we are the seed of
[34:06] abraham so we are the heirs to this
[34:10] praise the lord
[34:11] now
[34:12] when god did this
[34:14] he then turns to two things
[34:18] as the scripture says that by two
[34:20] immutable things
[34:22] in which it is impossible for god to lie
[34:27] amen the word is so sweet
[34:30] now the scripture says
[34:32] that by two immutable things
[34:35] in which it was impossible for god to
[34:37] lie
[34:39] now where are the two things
[34:42] because when i read the scripture
[34:44] it tells me that god saw by himself
[34:49] but when paul says it he says there are
[34:51] two immutable things
[34:54] so where are the two
[34:57] because the scripture only says god
[34:59] swore
[35:01] now to understand where the two are
[35:03] coming from we go back to what swearing
[35:06] is all about
[35:07] now when one is swearing there are two
[35:10] things that are happening
[35:12] there
[35:13] is a statement
[35:15] which is the words
[35:18] that you are saying this is the truth
[35:22] and then after you have said the words
[35:24] or somebody has read the words whatever
[35:26] it is then there is the swearing part
[35:29] which is when you lift up your hands
[35:31] and when they are taking an oath of
[35:33] office then they put one hand on the
[35:34] bible
[35:36] and they lift up the other hand that is
[35:38] the swearing
[35:40] amen
[35:41] but the swearing does not come on its
[35:43] own
[35:44] the swearing comes first with words that
[35:47] are spoken
[35:50] so in swearing there is two things
[35:53] already
[35:54] there is the statement glory to god
[35:57] which is the wording that you are saying
[35:59] this is the truth and then there is the
[36:01] action
[36:02] which is the actual swearing
[36:04] so two things happen when you are
[36:06] swearing
[36:07] so god hallelujah wanting to show the
[36:10] immediate bullet of his counsel he
[36:12] turned to these two things what was the
[36:14] first thing in swearing there is the
[36:16] word so which means god was take turning
[36:19] to his word first
[36:22] and then after his word then he turns to
[36:24] the actual action
[36:27] i don't know what god did on that day
[36:30] glory
[36:31] but if we would see a vision i believe
[36:33] glory to god god showed a sign
[36:37] hallelujah to say i am swearing now
[36:41] after i've made a statement
[36:43] and then paul says in the two things
[36:46] that it is impossible for god to lie
[36:49] what is the first thing in which is
[36:51] impossible for god to lie god cannot lie
[36:53] about his word
[36:56] praise the lord and god once he swears
[36:59] he cannot alter what he has sworn
[37:03] so the two immutable things in which is
[37:05] it impossible for god to lie so the
[37:07] first one being his word when god has
[37:10] spoken his word barricades him
[37:14] now i'm back to the first thing that i
[37:16] read
[37:17] the story of that king
[37:19] when that king had given his word to
[37:22] this slave and he said to this slave you
[37:25] drink this water or else i will not be
[37:27] able to kill you
[37:29] and then now the slave because it's
[37:31] shaking he throws the water and the
[37:32] glass on the floor and there is no more
[37:34] water to drink and the question now is
[37:37] asked what is this king going to do
[37:40] the king has already said i cannot kill
[37:43] you
[37:45] that is the word of the king
[37:48] what is higher praise the lord the laws
[37:51] of the land or the word of the king what
[37:54] is the king going to do now
[37:57] so the king had to let the man go why
[38:00] because the king cannot lie
[38:02] his word cannot be reversed
[38:05] so is it the same church tonight with
[38:07] the king of glory when the king of glory
[38:10] gives his word he cannot reverse on his
[38:13] word he cannot backslide on his word he
[38:16] cannot change his word once he gives it
[38:20] it has already gone it can only return
[38:22] unto him after it is accomplished that
[38:26] which it purposes before it accomplishes
[38:29] it cannot return
[38:31] oh glory to god
[38:34] amen so when god speaks
[38:38] he's barricaded
[38:40] by the words that he has spoken
[38:42] and god is not a man
[38:44] that he should change his mind god is
[38:47] not a man that he should lie about his
[38:50] word
[38:50] and brother sister when god speaks it is
[38:53] impossible for him to lie
[38:56] it is enough just to have his word
[38:59] oh praise the lord
[39:01] but though it is enough for us to have
[39:03] his word on that day to abraham god then
[39:07] turned to the second thing
[39:09] then he lifted up his hands i can almost
[39:12] see him
[39:13] praise the lord
[39:15] now swearing
[39:16] that by myself
[39:18] i am now swearing
[39:20] that this that i have said praise the
[39:23] lord it is going to happen
[39:26] and the target as i said
[39:28] was actually the heirs of the promise
[39:31] hebrews chapter 6 he says he swore by
[39:34] himself why
[39:37] that by two immutable things in which it
[39:40] was impossible for god to lie we might
[39:43] have a strong consolation who have fled
[39:46] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[39:51] before us
[39:52] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[39:55] soul
[39:56] but sure and steadfast
[39:59] and which enter it into that within the
[40:02] veil
[40:03] so why is god swearing that by two
[40:07] immutable things
[40:09] we might layer hold
[40:12] hallelujah and then when we lay hold we
[40:15] will then be anchored
[40:22] so we can layer hold praise the lord
[40:26] we can take hold on that which god has
[40:29] already said
[40:31] so i can finish right here
[40:33] god tend to these two immutable things
[40:37] and the target of what he was doing was
[40:39] not abraham he was dealing with you and
[40:42] i and why is god turning to this too so
[40:45] that we when we now hear what god spoke
[40:48] on that day we can lay a hold on that
[40:51] and we can have a strong consolation and
[40:54] we can be anchored
[40:57] praise the lord
[40:59] we can find our anchor
[41:01] and we can say if god say this it is his
[41:04] word number one if god swore on this
[41:08] then this is a finnish thing
[41:12] we can be anchored church
[41:14] when a ship is anchored
[41:17] it cannot go anywhere when a ship is
[41:20] anchored it does not mean that it is now
[41:22] out of stormy waters it does not mean
[41:24] that the waves are no longer coming out
[41:26] the waves might still be there but when
[41:29] the ship is got an anchor let the storms
[41:31] arise
[41:32] let the belows rise let whatever come
[41:36] but the ship is got an anchor it is
[41:38] going nowhere
[41:40] oh glory to god
[41:42] those forces might be there but the
[41:44] sheep is got an anchor when a believer a
[41:47] true child of god when they found their
[41:50] anchor it don't matter what they're
[41:52] going through in life it don't matter
[41:54] what is happening in their life it don't
[41:56] matter what the situation is you can say
[41:59] come rain come sunshine i'll be in the
[42:02] message come next year come whatever
[42:05] come he believe the sign and whatever
[42:07] i'll be in the message why because i
[42:10] found my anchor
[42:12] i'm anchored in the world
[42:14] i found my refuge i'm anchored in the
[42:17] world
[42:20] i'm not in there i'm not a believer
[42:23] because i have not seen a certain trial
[42:26] but no matter what the storm is going to
[42:27] be no matter what the trial is going to
[42:30] be i found my anchor and i'm resting
[42:33] solid praise be to god
[42:36] in jesus christ i got an income
[42:40] when a seed of abraham is anchored
[42:42] brother they are unmovable
[42:45] now god turned to two immutable things
[42:48] to show the immutability of his counsel
[42:52] so god turned to his word first
[42:56] right
[42:57] god tend to his word first which is what
[42:59] he would say to abraham
[43:01] that's the first thing that he turned to
[43:03] now what do we know about the word of
[43:05] god
[43:06] peter writing he says unto your faith at
[43:08] virtue
[43:09] unto your virtue ed knowledge
[43:13] amen
[43:15] and what is that knowledge the prophet
[43:17] of god in the stature of a perfect man
[43:19] he says you judge whether the word is
[43:22] right or wrong
[43:26] and if you can lay aside all your creeds
[43:28] and all your unbelief everything that
[43:30] you claim you have done then you have
[43:32] knowledge to believe that god cannot lie
[43:37] let every man's word be a lie but mind
[43:40] be true see now you are getting
[43:43] knowledge that's supreme knowledge
[43:47] what is supreme knowledge it is when you
[43:49] get a level where you know that god
[43:52] cannot lie
[43:54] it is when you get to a level when you
[43:56] know that if i read a scripture this
[43:58] scripture is a reality
[44:00] it is when you get to a level that when
[44:02] you hear the prophet speak praise be to
[44:05] god you can rest your soul upon it
[44:08] oh come on church what we need is a
[44:10] supreme knowledge
[44:12] that one statement is enough for god
[44:15] hallelujah god don't need to tell me
[44:18] twice about the thing that i'm looking
[44:20] for if i find one caught
[44:23] that should be enough
[44:24] if i find one scripture that should be
[44:27] enough
[44:28] god cannot lie
[44:31] or glory to god
[44:33] then you can be anchored on what god has
[44:35] said praise god in the highest
[44:38] you can rest your soul on just that one
[44:41] statement i like what the prophet of god
[44:43] says he says talking of the lord jesus
[44:46] christ that the reason why he say
[44:48] destroy this temple and i'll raise it up
[44:50] in three days
[44:51] he says he was resting on just one
[44:53] promise
[44:54] and what was that one promise i will not
[44:57] suffer i will not leave my my son in
[44:59] hell
[45:00] or suffer my holy one to see corruption
[45:03] he says that's all
[45:05] that jesus was resting on
[45:07] he did not have anything else
[45:09] he knew that god said he would not leave
[45:12] his son in hell or suffer his holy one
[45:15] to see corruption that was enough
[45:18] now brother sister we don't have one
[45:20] scripture
[45:22] we've got scripture upon scripture we
[45:24] got caught upon quota we got taped up on
[45:27] paper how much more
[45:29] or we do find the perfect anchor in what
[45:32] god has already said to us
[45:35] oh glory to god
[45:37] now god he swore by himself
[45:40] but i want you to look when god swore
[45:42] this was very specific
[45:45] amen
[45:46] he was dealing with a specific thing
[45:48] genesis chapter 22 the bible says and he
[45:52] said by myself have i sworn
[45:56] says the lord for because thou has done
[45:58] this thing and has not withheld thy sign
[46:01] then only son that in blessing i'll
[46:04] bless thee and in multiplying i'll
[46:06] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[46:08] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[46:10] sea i want you to watch this first part
[46:13] god is dealing with abraham
[46:16] he's speaking to abraham
[46:18] but when he now comes to the second part
[46:22] thy seed
[46:23] shall possess the gate
[46:26] of his enemies now he's no longer
[46:29] dealing with abraham
[46:30] he is finished with abraham
[46:32] i'm going to bless you and i'm going to
[46:34] multiply your sin there shall be as the
[46:37] the stars of the heaven this is your
[46:39] part abraham but now i'm dealing with
[46:42] those that are coming in 2022.
[46:44] i'm dealing with those that are gonna be
[46:46] reading this word in 2022 and what is my
[46:48] word to those praise the lord
[46:51] thy seed
[46:52] which is these people here
[46:55] shall possess
[46:57] the gate
[46:59] of his enemy
[47:00] and this is what god turned to two
[47:03] immutable things in which it was
[47:05] impossible for him to lie
[47:08] glory to god so when god wanted to show
[47:11] us the immutability of this promise what
[47:14] promise that you shall possess the gate
[47:17] of your enemy he turned to two things in
[47:20] which it was impossible for him to lie
[47:22] he turned to his word and he says i've
[47:24] given you my word of promise i'm
[47:26] barricaded by my own word this cannot
[47:29] change
[47:30] then he swore and he says thy seed shall
[47:33] possess the gate of his enemy
[47:36] therefore let me say to you tonight
[47:39] possessing the gate of your enemy is not
[47:42] an if
[47:48] it's a wind
[47:52] did you get what i said
[47:54] possessing your enemy's gate
[47:57] is not an if
[47:59] if you possess no it's not an if
[48:02] it is a win
[48:04] because as for it happening
[48:06] god swore by himself and god cannot lie
[48:10] god tends to do things in which it is
[48:13] impossible for him to lie this is
[48:15] immutable glory to god he says now what
[48:19] i am saying here it shall happen
[48:22] therefore let me say to you tonight
[48:24] possessing the case of your enemy it is
[48:27] going to happen
[48:28] i don't care how long you have suffered
[48:31] i don't care how long you have waited i
[48:33] don't care how high the mountain is i
[48:35] don't care how much it looks impossible
[48:38] but i want to tell you if god turned to
[48:41] two things in which it is impossible for
[48:43] him to lie he's not gonna start lying
[48:46] with you
[48:47] he's not going to start lying with your
[48:48] situation
[48:50] therefore tonight i can tell you you
[48:52] shall possess the gate of your enemy
[48:55] i don't know what you came to church for
[48:57] but you can possess the gate of your
[48:58] enemy i don't know what your challenge
[49:00] in your life is but you can possess the
[49:02] gate of your enemy pray spirit of god in
[49:05] the highest when the seed of abraham
[49:08] recognizes
[49:10] that when it comes to possessing the
[49:12] gate of my enemy this is a sworn promise
[49:16] you can be anchored in that
[49:18] you can anchor your soul you can say you
[49:21] know what i can afford to be reckless in
[49:24] faith
[49:26] what do you mean preacher man the
[49:29] prophet of god says now joshua in all
[49:32] this knowing that the command was great
[49:34] but having the assurance he could be
[49:37] fearless
[49:38] he could be as we call it reckless
[49:41] as long as he was pointed in the right
[49:43] way he might break up against a hill
[49:45] that would knock him backwards but he
[49:47] was carried the right way
[49:49] so can the church of the living god be
[49:52] reckless and fearless
[49:54] in faith if we are pointed the right way
[49:58] i want to say we are pointed the right
[50:00] way
[50:01] because god tends to two things
[50:03] in which it is impossible for him to lie
[50:06] we have the word of promise and we have
[50:08] his sworn statement praise the lord oh
[50:11] hallelujah
[50:13] if a president of united states of
[50:15] america can swear and out of office and
[50:17] can hold to that office what more of the
[50:19] king of glory
[50:21] when he swore and he says your seed
[50:25] shall possess the gate of his enemy
[50:27] brother sister you can afford to be
[50:29] reckless on that
[50:30] you can afford to go all the way on that
[50:33] you can face every enemy believing amen
[50:36] that it is gonna be done oh come on
[50:39] church of the living god
[50:40] come on church of the living god you can
[50:43] afford to be reckless with faith
[50:46] hallelujah
[50:48] when we can look at the seed of abraham
[50:50] that we find in the bible we can now
[50:52] begin to understand those that
[50:54] understood that god swore
[50:57] god gave his word they could afford to
[51:00] be reckless
[51:01] now i can understand my brother caleb
[51:04] together with his friend joshua
[51:07] that when they went to spy the land when
[51:09] the others came back and they were
[51:11] shaking and they were quivering because
[51:13] of the giants that they had seen let me
[51:15] tell you it's not like there were no
[51:17] giants
[51:18] the giants were there
[51:20] the walls were there
[51:22] with chariots running on top of the
[51:24] walls it was a fearful spectacle
[51:27] but brother sister caleb hallelujah he
[51:30] said i'm not looking at the giants up
[51:33] i'm looking at a sworn promise i can
[51:35] anchor my soul upon what god said i'm
[51:39] not looking at how high the walls are
[51:42] i'm not looking at how big the giants
[51:44] are i'm looking at how big the god that
[51:47] make the promise is
[51:49] oh come on church of the living god
[51:51] tonight don't look at how big your
[51:54] problem is
[51:55] that sister that is going for a
[51:56] procedure don't look at how big the
[51:58] problem is you can only look hallelujah
[52:01] at the promise of the living god i'll
[52:04] never leave you no forsake you but i'll
[52:07] be with you right through to the end of
[52:09] the world don't look at your challenge
[52:11] look at the god that is with you look at
[52:14] the promise that is standing with you
[52:16] let every man's word be a liar but my
[52:19] word be the truth
[52:20] praise the lord so caleb could say the
[52:24] giants be there my way to hinder but god
[52:27] will surely give me the victory
[52:29] oh hallelujah i might be 85 years old
[52:33] but i still have strength within me but
[52:35] to go in and to come out
[52:37] now joshua give me my mountain
[52:41] i want my mountain i wish somebody
[52:44] tonight can recognize that this is
[52:46] mountain taking time this is possessing
[52:49] gates time you can also say to joshua
[52:52] the holy ghost tonight i won my mountain
[52:56] huh i'm not gonna let the service call
[52:58] before i receive my mountain i'm telling
[53:01] you giants get off my land
[53:04] oh you can give that devil a notice
[53:06] right now
[53:07] you can give that devil a notice right
[53:09] now
[53:10] he's been sitting on your mountain for
[53:12] too long but enough is enough
[53:15] things that gotta turn around
[53:17] things that gotta change at a certain
[53:18] point it can't always be this way
[53:21] there's gotta come a time when there
[53:23] will be a change in life and i'm here to
[53:25] announce i believe in spiritual food
[53:28] that comes in juice season tonight is
[53:31] someone's season

[53:40] be someone's season
[53:42] amen
[53:44] you can be reckless when you know that
[53:46] god swore
[53:48] i can understand my brother david praise
[53:51] the lord in the eyes but when he gets to
[53:54] the valley and he sees oh israel is
[53:56] shaking because there is a giant that is
[53:58] standing somewhere and everyone is
[54:00] afraid because of the size
[54:03] they are looking at this man and they
[54:04] are saying how big he is but david
[54:07] looked at the man and he says oh i can
[54:10] see what the whole all of them are
[54:12] seeing but i can also see something else
[54:14] that they are not seeing
[54:16] i can see the promise of my god
[54:19] i can see god say that we can possess
[54:22] the gates of our enemies who is this
[54:24] uncircumcised philistine that is defying
[54:27] the armies of the living god he looked
[54:30] at that giant the giant came and he says
[54:33] i'm gonna feed you to the beds
[54:36] and david says you liar
[54:39] your head is coming off
[54:42] you liar

[55:18] and by being circumcised he was saying
[55:20] i'm a seed of abraham and by saying i'm
[55:23] a seed of abraham he was saying god
[55:25] swore to father abraham all glory to god
[55:29] that the seed of abraham shall possess
[55:32] the gate of the enemy they tried to say
[55:35] oh this man he has been trained right
[55:37] from these youth and you are only just
[55:39] but a young man he says yes i might not
[55:42] be trained in the weapons of this
[55:43] warfare which are these kind of weapons
[55:46] but i'm trained in the word of the lord
[55:49] or tonight church of the living god we

[1:07:36] swore by himself
[1:07:38] and and you know and all we have is just
[1:07:40] our imagination as to what we do here in
[1:07:43] the u.s we lift our hand and you know
[1:07:45] and put a hand up and i think his right
[1:07:47] hand on the bible right and then the
[1:07:49] left hand up in the air can you imagine
[1:07:51] god doing something like that but he
[1:07:53] don't have a bible like this
[1:07:55] but he has his word that he releases out
[1:07:57] of his mouth
[1:07:59] and that word is just as amen just as
[1:08:02] real is what you see on the pages of the
[1:08:04] bible
[1:08:05] oh my
[1:08:07] god swears by himself i'm going to bring
[1:08:09] it to pass

[1:08:13] hate to say it like this but one time i
[1:08:15] got in trouble but your doubt can't even
[1:08:16] stop god
[1:08:20] your doubt can't even stop god god did
[1:08:23] not include your doubt in this

[1:08:28] knew that we would stumble sometime at
[1:08:30] the promise but he swore by himself
[1:08:32] anyway
[1:08:33] and he's gonna bring it to pass your
[1:08:36] doubt might delay it but it can't stop
[1:08:38] it
