God is good all the time all the time all the time praise the Lord amen am hey [Music] sorry all I know is the devil's attacking everywhere yeah that's all right that's there's certain things that happen in church and it become viral you know there there there there I know that there was one chair that I saw and I uh when I was here setting up on on um Friday me and brother Quinton uh one of them was a little uh wobbly so I tried to move it out of here so it didn't end up and I want to just tell uh the other brothers uh when you're setting up notice all the little details don't just throw a chair down right but think I could sit in this chair and you know I don't want no mistakes so just notice every little detail uh we want everybody to be safe you know here and and one day we we'll have our our chance the ones that we bought right but we we uh we looking we looking forward to that uh I um I want to say thank the Lord for bringing us all back safely uh from our journey and as you can see the change of weather over there was very um cold it was rainy uh it was uh it was a lot different from being in Florida and uh so many the the the Saints uh are fighting with everything they got to to stay well and uh we thank the Lord for them pressing their way out the church and and I don't want you to fear uh I know brother Quinton he's not here today and he he he went and got tested and and um they they say you got covid and they said no you don't have covid you got three viruses and like what in the world is this three viruses so I say brother this ain't nothing but the devil and uh we just going to keep claiming the victory over every cough over every sneeze over every pain uh every every time you cough just say by Stripes I'm heal amen just keep confessing that word until your body come in line with your confession amen praise the Lord uh so just keep all the saints in prayer and uh we but but anytime you go and you know and and and we had wonderful Services were very very very uh good services and um anytime you do damage to the devil's Kingdom you have to expect that he going to try to do some damage to you and and everybody that went on that trip you are a Target you need to understand that you are a target for the devil and and and uh uh so so you know we realize uh this is part of the battle but we claim victory amen we claim victory um there was a um prayer request that came in to me um actually a couple things that came in while we were away I got a a a email uh from sister Melissa and she was saying that her daughter sister Lily uh wanted to be baptized and we want to make uh a time for that uh uh I I don't have the exact text I mean the email in front of me but I know she said something about pray for me Saints uh so I can get back into uh Church uh be a little bit more faithful and she used the term I can get back in Step I I like that I like that and um so even you know we realize that this getting back in Step has a personal element to it and and uh and I believe the Lord's going to help us to see uh more of that you know in the weeks to come uh and uh so we want to pray for sister Melissa that God will make a way for her to be able to get back in church and uh that we can uh they here oh I didn't even see them praise the lord well you're back in Step already good to good to see you sister um so sister Lily uh we will make arrangements to get her baptized um uh really really so when God dealing with a person's heart like that you want to you want to jump on that so uh we we did get the uh the message and brother Frankie and sister Gina so good to see you all uh God bless you God bless you amen uh brother Frankie was listening to the service on Wednesday night and said uh brother the Lord really spoke to me through that sermon you'll see me on Sunday and uh so they're here amen so the Lord is moving amen man in in his own way uh uh we not looking at what the devil's doing we only got our eyes on what God is doing amen so um I um uh brother tro also mentioned a prayer request to me regarding um his um his sister Porsha uh the doctors have diagnosed something there uh in her body and uh she called and and just told him about the situation and he said uh do you mind if we just have the church pray for you and she said well that's why I was calling you uh because I wanted the church to pray amen over uh uh over her situation so we want to we want to we want to do that amen this this morning and um what I'm going to do amen is is actually have brother Troy come and uh he'll just lead us Amen in this

they they threw you to the they threw you threw you to the fire but you did a good job amen amen we were we we were there last weekend and and um my just it was just an overabundance of of singers overabundance of musicians and um you know and and when my my daughter and my niece are present uh we like to use them but I told uh sister Shalom and sister and I y'all y'all play for spirit and Truth Tabernacle so uh I want y'all up there playing too and uh they did a fine job they did a fine job um you know just just just everything just wonderful wonderful Services wonderful wonderful I just I I thank the Lord um but I'm happy to be back and I want to thank the Lord for brother smiley on last Sunday and uh certainly appreciate the word of the Lord coming from him and there's a particular quote that he was referring to about you know that little hickey that happened and I when I heard brother Troy come back and bring it you know uh uh he was reading and I don't know if they C it to put it on the screen but man that's a powerful quote that is a very powerful quote to just kind of think about it but the grace of God is what has uh bring us back to this perfect State there's a there's a uh like he said the theme of the scriptures restoration that when we catch that just very it seemed like it's uh simple but it's it's powerful the theme is restoration God is trying to bring us back to to something we on a journey y'all and God's trying to bring us back to a certain place in him we're living millions of miles beneath our privileges so uh I don't think we've tapped into this even deep enough but I trust to God just just kind of keep taking us further and further in it and brother brother Quinton did a wonderful job on the Wednesday night service uh just appreciate amen him and just uh just just just his warning to the church uh be be very very mindful that uh things could change because we know our situation going to change and when that happens the the the the the the the plateau may change but be prepared for that God is trying to prepare us even right now amen so praise the Lord God bless you I want to read uh our scriptures uh for today and uh thank God for the specials as well that went forth this morning appreciate you all uh thank God for brother Smiley standing in for brother Solomon on this morning morning amen just appreciate all things that have been done in Jesus name we're going back to our uh theme and I got a little I'm a little bit too hot on this uh too much gain uh but uh uh I'm going to have you just read with me uh joel4 and um and then um we'll we'll go on from there um all right uh it says that which the uh pal warmath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the korm eaten that which the cankerworm ha left hath the caterpillar eaten uh going on to Joel 2 uh here and just uh catching verse 23 uh be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you uh the former rain model and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I just love this and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and uh ye shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you my people should never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people should never be ashamed let's just quickly pray father we are grateful for the uh privilege to be able to read the word but we know um it takes the Holy Ghost to make the word live for us even uh today so God help us to hear what the spirit is trying to speak for this moment we take control over every Spirit that's against the spirit of God and we ask that the that you would have preeminence Amen in this portion of the service as you've done in uh the the the prior uh part of the service so God just get all the glory and all the honor uh hide us behind the cross that we might not be seen but may Christ be on full display in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated you can be seated um as you can see on my opening slide uh we are still in this theme of get back in step and um as I just mentioned here um I I believe you know as I was looking at this um I I I saw that one quote where brother brandom said uh the bride got back in Step may she get back in step and uh and see she got out of Step just like they did in the wildness you know journey and as I as I was looking at that that's where this whole thing just began to come uh to me but the deeper I go into it the more I see how this is not just a spiritual condition of the church uh but it moves down into a uh a personal spiritual condition Hallelujah sometimes we have a general uh spir spiritual condition of what God has done through the church ages but uh but as I look at this more and more it starts getting down into a personal spiritual condition Now understand generally the bride cannot get back and step uh unless uh uh the bride begins to apply some things personally in her life and and here here's what here's what I'm going to do this morning I'm going to call all of y'all bride all right all right amen and order to call All of You bride then there there are certain things that we have to um we have to um just begin to deal with amen so I forgot to set my timer and let me do that right now so that I don't run over time here today but uh we going we going to take our time and get through this so I I I read uh these scriptures in Joel however uh for this morning uh I kind of have two little thoughts that I'm kind of putting together in this one sermon and I trust it'll be a blessing for you let let us go forward because we stopped at verse 27 but I think for today it would be very appropriate for us to read verse 28 through3 2 amen and it says and it shall come to pass afterward Hallelujah that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy amen your old men shall dream dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions now uh here when we look at this scripture this is a a prophecy that happened on the day at Pentecost but nonetheless it's a prophecy that we still expect to happen today now as we go through this series uh really in my heart I want to tell you I want to get back to that part of where uh uh the restoration included the gifts of the Spirit so there's going to be a real Focus I want to bring into to that you know at at some point in time but before I can get to the gifts of the Spirit amen we got to talk about the brotherly kindness hello sir somebody we got to talk about the unity we got to talk about all those things before we can get to the gifts of the Spirit otherwise we got our cart way before the horse right and and and so so we got we got to put all these things in line because the restoration brings back it brings back the brotherly kindness it brings back the the unity the Divine Fellowship in the church oh I know what I'm talking about amen it brings back that restoration brings all that back plus it brings the gifts of the Spirit and then on top of that it brings the fullness of the word right so we getting all this amen but but we just can't we can't jump all the way to the gifts of the Spirit without talking about amen Unity without talking about brotherly kindness and things of that nature Hallelujah so y'all ready for the journey all right let's go on now and it shall come to pass cuz this is part of restoration now after word that I will I'm looking for it pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the service of upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood and this is supposed to happen before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call amen hallelujah on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and I like that promise I like that promise it it didn't say that uh uh you come and tell God I got this problem I got that problem I need deliverance from this I need deliver I I'm really really bound it don't care how deep in sin you are if you just call on the name of the Lord you shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call now um I I I'm looking at verse uh verse 30 and 31 in in Joel 2 there was talking about the wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire pillars of smoke so y'all already with me that's why it say it's very appropriate for us to read this scripture for today Hallelujah the sun shall be turned in the darkness amen and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord now so before uh the second coming of the Lord there are supposed to be things that happen that when we see them happen it should cause us to want to draw a little closer to God right ah help me Jesus amen so so here the scripture tells us that these things are going to be happening we will watch them happen but I don't want us to be so unspiritual that we miss what God is trying to do in this hour all right so we're going to talk a little bit about some natural things that are happening but let's look at some scriptures here and look at some quotes so here uh this verse 30 and verse 31 connects amen with the scripture over in Matthew 24 praise God Amen and Jesus speaks of these things amen before his second coming in verse 29 it says immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darken amen and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven which with power and great Glory now um I'm going to go ahead of myself and just say this what we're looking at in verse 29 are things that are supposed to happen before the Great Tribulation amen uh uh uh right now we're all you know we're we we we're enduring a many tribulation ourselves just a different tests and trials that we go through it's just a many tribulation but there's a Great Tribulation that's promised after the bride is taken home but before Israel is dealt with again the Bible tells us in verse 29 immediately after the tribulation those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give a light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the pows of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels I like that just just the mere fact that it says Angels uh we already know this is Moses and Elijah amen and he shall send his Ang angels with the great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and put forth leaves ye know that some is nigh so likewise when ye when ye shall see these things know that it is near even at the doors so when we see these signs in the heavens we see these uh uh uh things happening with the with the moon and with the sun we see these signs there there's things these are these are H uh indicators that the second cominging of Lord is upon us hallelujah amen we got to be ready for this uh for this coming of the Lord there there are some things that we're going to have to kind of get cleaned out glory to God Amen we got to go back and bring the brotherly kindness back into the church we got to go back and get the unity and bring it back into the church and then we can see the gifts operate hallelujah we're not Pentecostal here this is the bride of Christ amen in Pentecost you can live any kind of life you wanted to and still manifest in the gifts but not here in the message we can't do it like that amen we want to be like Christ in everything we do amen so now let's look at this with signs in the heavens glory to God uh brother Brandon makes a statement here in a in a in a question that's ask them in questions and answers on Genesis and they're asking specific about Matthew 24:29 and it says uh Matthew 24:29 speaks of the sun being dark and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from heaven will this happen before or after the Rapture they want to know this or just before Jesus comes to Reign on earth now brother man say to my humble belief now uh I don't know I think he's speaking of Matthew 24 there now Jesus speaking of the stars and things Fallen I believe that is just before the tribulation period sets on the earth so before the Great Tribulation that is just before the Great Tribulation oh my I I don't have time to go into it but I can tell y'all the next great event that we are looking for according to scripture is the rapture the completion of the Rapture as brother Troy said last week we already in the Rapture but the completion of it because it's a three-phase process a shout a voice and a trump glory to God but in the completion of that amen there's some things that need to happen before that completes and we're waiting for that great event one of these mornings it won't be long you'll look for me and I'll be gone in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I'll be changed I got to live daily ready I can't be getting ready I got to be ready Hallelujah it says I believe that is just before the tribulation period sets on earth now I have a real funny thought here that many of you are going to disagree with me on this I imagine some of the old Thom has heard teaching that we went through it see I don't believe the church would go through the tribulation period I believe the church will the only way I teach the New Testament is by Old Testament Shadow just like the Holy Ghost here for the Sabbath day and so forth everything is a shadow back there so what he said the church will go through the tribulation but the brides will catch a Rapture the church will go through a tribulation but the bride oh Lord help us there we we got to understand amen just scripture terms uh it's only the bride that makes herself ready it's only the bride that can get back in step and the way that the bride gets back in step is based on what she hears that's why it's important for us to feed the bride bride food Hallelujah because based on what she hears that allows her to get back in Step hallelujah amen it's it's not it's not the prophet screaming at you it's you having something on the inside of you screaming back to the word I got to line up with this you got something that cause you to get back in tune amen wait a minute I'm out of I'm out of tune right now I'm not where I'm supposed to be spiritually and and and many of us recognize these things I can I can say it from my own self there's things in my life that I don't like I need to get rid of this stuff Hallelujah I want to stay in Step because the Rapture is at hand We Don't Preach about the Rapture enough amen the Rapture is at hand church it's the next great event that we're waiting for the completion of this Rapture now brother brandom tells us that he believed this Matthew 24:29 amen is something that happens uh before the tribulation period set in these are signs in the sky Hallelujah glory to God and here we have one that's going to happen tomorrow glory to God it doesn't come through very clear but uh what we're expecting tomorrow amen is a a a solar eclipse and what they call a total total solar eclipse now these don't happen that often I'm going to read something here in the future the in in in in in in my next Slide the next the next one that's supposed to happen is going to be uh 20 20 I mean 2044 so 20 years from now these things don't happen that often so when they do happen we have to take notice of it cuz sometimes God's trying to speak to his people oh God help us here so I'm I mean we got to we put it right back in scripture and try to show hey this is what this is what was promised according to Joel according to Matthew 24 these are the things that were promised now we're seeing that happen right before our very eyes now what what happens in this total solar eclipse amen is uh you can see the sun here and the moon here and the Earth there and what happens is that the moon gets in between uh the the Sun and the Earth Hallelujah and when that happens glory to God Amen man when that happens you can't see it on this diagram but this part just goes dark right here on the earth and whoever's in that part of the earth they'll just see total darkness for about four or five minutes hallelujah hallelujah I I need you to understand something about about the Sun and the Moon the Moon is I'm going to read this in a second is 400 times smaller than the sun 400 times smaller than the Sun so that means there's no way that the Moon can totally black out the sun only for a certain spot hallelujah amen the Sun going to constantly be shining amen only for a certain spot praise God and it only happens when this this this this this this this solar eclipse occurs now here let me um uh I I I want to just kind of mention something here you know I'm going to I was just trying to look at some of this like what's some of the significance of of this you know and um when you really go out there on the website out there searching the internet they have all kind of things you got to be so careful because there's so many new age teachings on these type of things what I'm going to do is not take you to New Age teaching I'm going to take you to a old age teaching I'm going to take you to what a prophet said but just notice this is something this is something that does not happen but it said the scripture tells us that there would be wonders in the the heavens and in the earth blood and fire pillows of smoke it also said uh that the sun would be the sun shall be darkened and the moons shall not give her light now let's look at this I went uh and just try to get some facts and some some some significance of the solar eclipse and it said um and and here I'm going to tell you another thing that I do I don't know nothing about none of this so in order me to learn I got to go to Children's websites hello I go to kids websites and I find out if if it can be taught to a child it can be taught to me praise the Lord so I went to a child's website like what are some of the significant things that they want kids to know about this it said at it very simplest when the moon gets in between the Earth and the Sun and the Moon appears to pass the pass over the Sun as seen from the earth then we get a solar eclipse now I I underline that that it appear cuz when it's in darkness it may feel like the sun is being blocked no the Moon is not large enough to block amen the light of the sun now now I'm going to go a little further the Moon represent the church the church is not large enough to block the light of the s o n and I don't care how far the church gets away from the word the church is not large enough to block the light of the s o n somebody going to see some light and somebody going to come out of that denomination somebody going to come out of that system I don't care how much they've been blinded and how long they've been blinded it cannot stop the penetration of light of the S so N I like that here the moon I got this next one the Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun and and they they said where the way you have to look at it's like a basketball and a tennis ball if you put two of them in your hand it's no way that tennis ball can block all the shadow of the basketball praise the Lord this next one says as the moon blocks the Sun's light It cast The Shadow on part of the earth not the full Earth but on you got to be in a in a certain realm to be able to see this amen but it only blocks it castes Shadow on part of the earth praise God uh here the other one uh the the moon's uh the Moon Shadow creates a trail as the Earth is rotating and this Trail is called the path of totality amen so it's total darkness only for a certain section but not everybody oh my my my my my this is so important now I'm I'm going tell y'all something here I'm going read a quote here in a second but the quote that I read has been challenged when brother bradam said and if you go out to the websites you might find somebody challenging that quote and they say well you know and they said Brother Brad I'm trying to prove his Doctrine on the seven Church agents with this quote and they said uh they said uh if there was a a blackout it should have happened in Jerusalem now God don't when God said that his that when he promised this according to uh to Joel 2 and also he promised it according to to Matthew 24 it didn't say what city was going to happen in but that don't stop the word of God from being perform performed now where we living at we might not see much of this Darkness but there are some people in the US they in that they in that path amen they're in a path they're going to experience total darkness but others may not see it but does that mean the scripture not being fulfilled hallu just because you not seeing don't mean the scripture not being fulfilled right and what you want to do you want to catch up I mean they they trying to Chace they they they were chasing the PO we chasing a prophet and what a prophet is saying look at this let me keep going on now the Moon Shadow creates a trailer as the Earth rotates this Trail is called the path of totality the next one the path of totality will cross three countries Mexico Canada and the US all three countries be affected by the solar eclipse all of them another one um in that path the moon completely blocks the Sun's light for a few minutes it gets so dark that it looks like nighttime during a full moon wow and it happens for about four or five minutes say even nature get confused when it happens my God watch this now uh and the last one says after this this April spectacle the next total solar eclipse to cross the continuous uh contiguous us will not occur until 2044 now I say acrossing the us now it might be others Ur uh in other places but across in the US it's 2044 but yet and still we see in the word of God being made manifest right before our very eyes now let's go to like I told you uh when you if you go out there and you start reading all types of websites follow all kind of things you got to be careful because there's a lot of new age material coming your way and you start trying to tie tie into some of this new age stuff and you you way off base so for me when I see things like this I always go back to what a prophet said so I found it in the church A's book The Prophet dealt with this in 1964 glory to God now he made a statement there in 1964 that they're again they're challenging his statement but I I'm not watching a pope I'm watching a prophet watch this now Matthew 24 mentioned signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before Jesus comes I wonder if you noticed such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth that we uh we have been discussing that truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until in the last age he is pushed outside the church amen recall that in the first age it was almost a full ored Church of Truth yet there was a little error called the Deeds of the nicians that kept that kept the circle from being full then in the next age more Darkness crept in until the ball of light glowed less and darkness covered more of the circle in the third age it was eclips till still more and in the fourth age which was the Dark Ages the light had all but gone now I'm reading a quote but I thought it'd be very appropriate if I gave you a picture of what the prophet is saying Hallelujah let's see here uh I might have okay I might have got myself that's good did you did you for it twice okay all right no problem so so here uh I want to just kind of get this so brother Brandon was just talking about how uh this light was just I mean it was almost like a full moon in the first age he's talking about the Ephesus age it's almost a full moon almost full light just a little sliver of darkness and then we get to the next Church age irius is the messenger there it goes to amen a little little Moon little bit more darkness and then the third age it goes less Moon and more darkness sett in to finally get to and this is in your history lesson the Dark Ages that's back in your school history lesson in the Dark Ages it's just almost complete darkness and a small sliver of light this is what happened in the Dark Ages however when Luther came my God in Revelation chapter 3 this is all part of the restoration church but and when Luther came he began to break away from the denominational teachings hallelujah amen because here if you was not Catholic you were dead the Catholics killed everybody that did not agree with them so when Luther came along he broke away from his Catholic teachers that's why I said a little bit of light when it leaves Luther's amen Sardis age then it goes to West you can see a little bit more light coming in justification came in in Luther's day Wesley brought in sanctification Hallelujah they got a little bit more like but then when it hit this last day brother brandom's day Hallelujah glory to God the reason amen that it's only a little light there I'm going to read the quote he says because the light start growing then all of a sudden it stopped it says it start growing the reason that the light start growing because the fullness of the word came back into the church everything they had at this age it came back at this age and there's only very few people with that let me tell you something it was only very few people at this age that had the truth only very few at that age that had the truth amen it's only very few that's walking in the the full truth part we have some that's walking in truth right every denominational church out there has part truth my question is to you do you want part truth or whole truth amen amen amen cuz see the Bible actually tells us when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with so here the full truth came back but because people rejected the walk in that full truth that's why you see more more Darkness than light now let's go on and read a little bit more here in these in these quotes uh I think I had a I'm not sure I'm going Slide N I don't know if that's right uh okay right now think on this the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ he is the sun he is the son Christ is the sun all right the church is the moon so when you see these things happening in the natural uh just the sun is Christ the Moon is is the church and the church is blocking the view of the sun when you have a total eclipse it's the church blocking the view of the sun now what does revelation 3 tell us that Christ was on the outside of his own church knocking trying to get back in now now now the only way that that could happen is that the church somehow the church oh my God the church put Jesus out how did the church now they they go in there and they they they they worship and they praise God and and they have great music and they do all these things but how the bible say that they put Jesus out how did they put Jesus out when they rejected the word how do they reject the word if they got a woman preacher am if they got a woman preaching they rejected the word because the Bible say I suffer not a woman to do that right I mean I mean uh if they oh Lord have mercy God help me Jesus how they reject the word if they baptizing you in the name of father and of son and of Holy Ghost they have rejected the word because there's nobody in the Bible that's been baptized that way everybody in scripture was baptized according to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they reject that they rejecting the word this is why Jesus is on the outside of the church trying to try knock and trying to get back in brother random says one of the most pitiful sites you'll ever see Jesus knocking trying to get back into the church that he died for but that's a condition and and this sign in heaven tells us that these things are there oh God don't worry don't worry I'm going to turn the corner here in a little bit I'mma turn the corner I just I had to bring this because it's very appropriate for tomorrow very appropriate look he says this now think of this the church shines in the reflected light of the Christ he is a son the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a s a sliver in the fourth age but in the fifth age it began to grow in the sixth it took a great step uh uh of growth forward and part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and Wan almost to nothingness so that instead of light it was the Blackness of apostasy it was the Blackness of apostasy just hold on to that thought for a little bit let me finish reading this quote but I want to I should have underlined that the Blackness of apostasy watch this now watch it it says uh and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for Darkness had taken over Christ has was now outside the church here is the sign in the sky now when we uh hear him say the Blackness of apostasy I have a little something here that I wanted to just make mention of really really quick if I can find it yeah I uh uh apostasy is the abandonment or renunciation of a religious or political belief I'mma say that again uh he said it's going to WAN out into the Blackness of apostasy hey let me let me back up let me back up a prophet prophesied way back in the 60s that this was going to end up in the in the Blackness of apostasy and apostasy is an abandonment or renunciation of a religious or political belief now you tell me with believe the sign that don't believe the sign anymore have they ended up in an apostasy brother brandham saw that the church would end up in an apostasy the Blackness of apostasy oh my my my my but there is a promise I will restore sayeth the Lord so I don't care what I see God is bringing light back in amen like I say only the moon can only reflect and only block light in a certain area but the sun is still shining around all of that and it only lasts for a certain amount of time oh I thank God for that I'm ready to tell the devil your 5 minutes is up [Applause] brother I said your five minutes is up Amen Let There be lights and there was light and there will be light nobody can stop that light from shining once it strike the seed it's got to bring [Applause] forth my God my God my God I'm I'm under expectation I'm going on the slide 11 I believe the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to total darkness in seven stages now again they tacking brother Brandon for all this but if you just they they say it's no seven stages to an eclipse I just did a a quick Google Google search and the first search I found it was at least five it was at least five just in the first search so don't believe everything you read sometime do your own research just don't carry don't just take believe the sign stuff do your own research amen the last eclipse of moon was a total eclipse it waned to total darkness in seven stages in the seven stages the total darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul the 6 went to Palestine to make a holy tour Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem now he wasn't welcome but he still went right it says he was the first he was the first um uh Pope uh to ever go to Jerusalem the pope is named Paul I 6 now he takes the now they they they actually take names that's not that wasn't his original name he took the name Paul the six my God and Paul represent the first church age messenger but why would he say Paul the six six is the number of man Hallelujah the pope is and and you trying to trace a pope to find out if it was a eclipse where the pope was I'm telling you right now there's an eclip with Eclipse where the pope is they walking in complete darkness the pope is named Paul the six Paul was the first messenger and this man goes by that name notice it is the six or the number of man this is more than a coincidence and when he went to Jerusalem the moon of the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come quickly now what they're what they're harping on is that it the the the eclipse did not happen on the very day that the pope was visiting I want to say it's roughly two weeks after but here's here's the thing that brother Brand's bringing why would this man Paul the six be the first one to go Jerusalem and the Very year that he chooses to go to Jerusalem there is a total eclipse in the same year within weeks of him going so we got our eyes on these spiritual things that areen happening and here you know 1964 is when that occurred here we are 2024 and uh and it's happening all over again my God my God there are signs in the heavens in the earth and what we want to do is just be ready for these things because these are indicators that Jesus is coming soon now y'all y'all stay with me I'm turning the corner Jesus is coming soon so so so so with that amen being said then I think it's my it's our responsibility as the Ministers of the church to help the church get back in step we talked about this in our last sermon and we tur the corner right here the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones remember four death four death Messengers took amen these things from the church and four life Messengers wereing bring it back but the four death messages what did they take they the palmerworm took the brotherly love and the fruits of the spirit that's why we got to we got in order to get to where the uh uh where the spirit comes back into the church right we got to deal with this Brotherly Love fruits of the spirit they also Locust took the leaves of divine Fellowship y'all going y'all y'all going to talk to me this morning this is this is happening right here in our church the leaves of divine Fellowship have been taken away from us Hallelujah right in our midst but but God say he going to restore that I don't know how but I know he going to do it amen uh the korm ate the bark it attacks the doctrine of the religion amen the covering of the church also the caterpillar it sucks the life out but in in the four stage of of ezekiel's dry bones we want to see what was restor the first thing he says I'll aay sen you upon you and what that senu is is the tendance the natural cords in the body that hold the body together and I'm going to tell you when you look at uh this this this this tendons amen the senu the thing that's got to hold a body together the spiritual body together is brotherly love and the fruits of the spirit right when that comes back into the church it holds the body together you start overlooking your brother's fault not pointing them out but you start overlooking your brother and sister's fault hello church amen it's the tendon and and in Ezekiel Dr Bones this this send you had to come back into the church into the body next thing I'm going to bring flesh upon you and this is the soft part of an animal body and I mentioned here that we need a heart of Flesh tenderhearted towards God because if we're tenderhearted towards God it would bring amen Divine Fellowship right back into the church Oh Glory to God if we're tender-hearted towards God we'll be tender-hearted towards our brothers and sisters amen the other in in Ezekiel the fourth stage of Ezekiel Dry Bones I will cover you with skin and skin is a natural covering of our flesh which the bark of the tree is the natural covering to the tree God going to restore all of that and the last thing is I'm going to put breath in you and your breath is your life this is where the true spirit of God comes back into the church we're watching for this we're looking for it now let me go further because as we talked about the tendons laying s you upon you this goes back to Ezekiel 36 and I read it for you at the close of the sermon the last time I preached but now I'm picking up there Ezekiel 36:24 says for I will take you from among the Heathen this is a promise and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean look at this look at this oh my my my my my my my my my my I felt like shouting you gonna be clean from all your filthiness Hallelujah and from all your Idols will I cleanse you and look at this a new heart a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and and and and here's here's the other thing oh I love the word of God y'all yeah y'all just don't know how I love this no notice this you in a situation where you don't want to even give up the way you feel you feel justified in the way that you feel about a certain situation but God don't like that spirit being there in you and since you won't give it up since you won't lay it down God say I [Music] will God say I'm going to take away your Stony heart glory to God I'mma I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh something going to change I I believe this hey something's got to change and this this is a promise from God I I mean we some some some you know like like the brother that um that that that challenged the prophet he um uh he said you ain't going to preach here I done knocked a lot of preachers down trying to preach over here in Portland and brother random say he said you challenge the spirit of God you're not challenging me he said you're going to fall over my feet that man said I'mma show you feet feet I'mma fall over follow that man spit in the prophet's face now I'm going tell you right there the test would have been hard to pass for me for me that would have been very hard spit in my face in front of all these people but I'm going tell you why brother Brandon didn't didn't swing at that man that man was about 6 foot5 300 and something pounds he knew nothing he can do but take the spit spit falling from his face we talk about being Christians ain't we and he had to realize that he could not get in the flesh because this was not a flesh BL a flesh and blood battle this was a spiritual battle so he say you going to fall over my feet and God allowed that man to spit in his face like that to see how he' [Music] respond that was an intimidation uh move but he didn't fall for the intim imidation move he said I said you going to fall over my feet that man ran back went to swing at the prophet and when he was to swing right down over the prophet's feet police and all the preachers that was running away from the man they left brother brandom standing there by himself but see I'm going tell you if God is for you who can be against you that man laid there and then all the preachers and police running back say say what you want us to do say just get them off my feet that's right right say is he delivered no you're not delivered you going to pray for him no I ain't praying for him he worshiped the spirit that he got so since he worshiped that Spirit he go it's going to stay right there on him until he ready to get delivered but he know he just came in contact with the real thing here now he might go beat up another pre but he won't he won't be doing that here in these meetings and you know what as many times brother Brandon went back to Portland Oregon that man never showed up he knew he was dealing with this was no ordinary Ministry this was God sent this ministry all right Church Hallelujah but see that man worship His Spirit glory to God and some of us might worship the spirit that we [Music] got true but but here I even but but but but since I'm calling you bride right I'm here to tell you what's gonna happen to the bride what's going to happen to the bride God say I'm going to I'm going to take I don't care if you worship it or not I'm going to take away the Stony heart out of you amen out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh now now I got more to say here I'm I'm I'mma read my quotes so we understand clearly where we at but but after I take that from you there's still more to the process I will put this is the spirit of God this is a holy spirit this is a righteous spirit this is a Godly spirit I will put my spirit within you and cuse you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall drawn the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I got to read I got to read these things because it it helps us see a little clearer brother Brandon is referring to Ezekiel 37 in this quote uh Ezekiel 36 in this quote says now Ezekiel was prophesying or for telling what would take place in an age to come so the scripture we just read was not even for ezekiel's day that scripture is actually for this day Ezekiel was prophesying or for telling what would take place in the age to come not in his age he says but a prophet is a sear and it is referred to in the Bible as the eagle who goes way high in the air and the higher you go the further you can see watch this now so the eagle soars up much higher than any other bird there's no bird can go with the eagle and there's no I like the eagle the Hulk hasn't got a chance in his sight and the Hulk cannot stand the altitude of where the eagle can SW he would die he doesn't he hasn't got the makeup that the eagle has look at this now I'm going forward I'm going forward and God liken the prophet to the eagle that would go in the makeup of a prophet amen he's a Seer that in the spirit climbs beyond the emotions of the church he climbs beyond the emotion of the church he sees beyond your emotions all your feelings and all that it ain't got nothing to do with what God trying to do and you may be right but you got to be willing to die to what you right about you a sheep you got to give up your wool you got to give up your rights the Holy Ghost will make you die to your own [Music] thoughts the sea in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music glory to God we think we don't have church when everything just in line boy they played they did they sung they did this no no no God can see beyond that oh hallelujah amen we can have all that church and still people won't fellowship with one [Music] another I I I see Saints in the church going out of different doors so they ain't got to shake somebody's hand can I preach I mean avoiding each other I'mma go out of this dose so I I don't have to fellowship with this one and I'mma go out of this and I'mma leave early and I'mma leave late and I'm no no no no that God God see all of that happening right in [Music] here and it's time for us right now amen to do some spring cleaning it's time to get this stuff straight out in the church before we can have the gifts blowing in here we got to go back and get the brotherly kindness you going to have to go out your way to greet somebody you got to put that devil to [Applause] rest avoiding each other believers am and we think we're going to go to heaven like that I know fell ain't about 20 or 30 of us in here and I'm avoiding you I can see if there's a thousand member church but it's just a few of us and and when we do this avoiding people can feel that there's an anointing that goes with that and I'm going to tell you something else that anointing would go from one generation to the Next Generation we got to stop that devil in his tracks I'm putting up the spiritual fence [Applause] we got a shock this I told y'all I was turning the corner and and as a pastor I look beyond the emotions of the church I look beyond the meeting atmosphere I look beyond all of that we got to get back in step and I told y'all this for me too there there's some certain things I got to do I got to do cuz I don't let stuff get into my heart I got I got to break this I can't let this devil just control me like this and don't get me wrong I'm I'mma Be I'mma just be honest with you that brother brandom said there certain people create a certain atmosphere and you just love to be around them others they create another atmosphere and you don't want to be around them well see I know I got people in my life that create an atmosphere and I don't want to be around them but I got to break that I still got to go and be around them and not just be around him because I got to be around him no I really want love in my heart I want I want peace in my soul I want to be able to shake their hand and brother I love you sister I love you and I I want I want the same feeling I have around those that I love to be around I want that to be inside of me with the ones that I don't want to be around brother bandam amen has so much love in his heart that they say you could not tell his enemies from his friends that wasn't just for a prophet that is for the bride of Christ they should not be able to tell your enemies from your friends notice the title of the sermon did y'all notice the title of the sermon or the quote that I'm reading you want to be a real Christian or you want to impersonate a Christian I I told y'all we got to do this now now I'm telling you as we do this as we do this watch you see what happened with the gifts that come back into the church amen but we got to get some stuff clean and it and it can't just be me preaching it it's got to be some action how we going to how we going to have communion right and you and and if if sister Erica or sister Tanya assigned you to another sister one that you know you ain't talk to what you going to do what you going to do oh I got to go to the bathroom somebody else can take my place no we going to wait for you to come back church amen we talking about being a bride a sea that in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the Saints the reason go beyond because they see us only joy in certain clicks we got Clans and clicks and it's only joy over here but this one over here is feeling all alone and ain't nobody reached out to try to bring them in week after week month after month nobody reached to try to bring that person in but happy with our little click us F we want to avoid that around here look look you Heaven it ain't going to all of a sudden get fixed in heaven heaven has come down to earth and we got to fix these things here amen and and let me just tell you something I might as well just say this because you know often times brother Brandon even said it and I don't know if it's in a quote but he said he said what happened that people hear things like this next thing you know they feel led to move to another church they got this strong leading I I had a dream and and the Lord lead me no no no no let me tell you something you running and I'm not I'm not I'm not going to sit here and put you down I I've learned I've been around church for a long time I might as well just say these things when you leave God going to have somebody to take your place sir yes he will trust me God have somebody to take your place it's not this not the work of brother Jack this the work of God oh y'all ain't going y'all a I I I could I could say some things right there cuz I've seen people I've seen people leave I've seen them and I knew and I I wouldn't say nothing I just let him go ahead let him okay you feel led to do it go ahead no problem no problem no problem and then I watched God at the same time they feeling led to leave God send another family in to feeling led to come yeah and not just come but come and be a part and can do the same thing you was doing huh what you say I ain't say that you said that that's what I want to say but I got to put it on you sis glory to God I'm telling you about my God you better know where you belong what church you belong under and don't be running around playing games cuz you you you you're messing up your uh your spirit and let me tell you if you running from something here yeah it'll be waiting for you when you get to the other other side it might take a year it might take two years it might take three that same devil going to come challenge you over there that's right the best thing you can do is get rid of that recognize this a devil that's been holding me back for years and I'm tired this I got to sometime you got to go out your way in order to get that Spirit off of you oh my brother Xavier I done had something against you I don't know why but I just want you to come shake your hand and say brother I love you I'm so sorry God bless you I really man I'm sorry the devil just put this thing between me and you but ain't nothing but a devil brother I love you please forgive me brother most likely that's the way your your your your when when when you go to somebody they GNA be looking just like brother Xavier looked at me what you talking about I'mma tell you why only the devil put that in you to have that against your brother and sister I got more to read y'all I got a lot more to read but only the devil put that in you like that they don't even see what you see the devil make that thing a mountain and it ain't nothing but a little mo here that's amen but but we got we have we we have to do something different I'm I'm intentionally you that was a word a few years ago intentional now I I Lord I didn't do this but I I I need to do this uh anybody remember no I I I I'll do it I ain't G I ain't going to let y'all off that I I'll do it so let me go and just keep reading this he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that God brings him up into a rim alone alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see the things that is to come then he brings them back down among the members of the body to forell them of what is in the making so God took Ezekiel High far up and let him see around about 2600 years so that new new heart new spirit and then I put my spirit in you Ezekiel was looking all the way down into this day it wern't even for his age God let a prophet way back then see us today I wonder I wonder if he if ezek e y'all going to let me preach I wonder if Ezekiel Saw us going out of different doors trying to avoid one another I wonder if Ezekiel Saw that going saw us walking down the Walmart aisle and we saw a sister in the church said I don't want to talk to her turn and go down another aisle and trying to run and then you end up getting down the same aisle I I wonder if Ezekiel Saw all of that Brothers a brother calling you and you know you're available you looking at your phone they they they they call ideas all over it I don't know who this is I can't see now all of a sudden you got problems with your eyes oh brother I'm so sorry I I I couldn't I couldn't even recognize who it was calling me they left you a message you knew the voice but refused to call them back just just all kind of nonsense right just just just and can I call it Petty baby childish amen little things like that and it hinders the church it hinders the spirit of God from moving in here and sometime we can come in we have a great service but we got to look beyond the Clapping now all that Clapping Your Hands and all that shouting and all that jumping and you still going to get up here and go out the other door I done called it out now so everybody going to be looking at you now they see you going out a different door or or run to the car early I got to get I I've been here I've done this before I've done this before I I mean I had a spirit of indifference on me and the spirit of indifference I would get to church at a certain time but I ain't want nobody to bother me so uh actually what I do is I always come late that way they went ask me to sing no special or nothing cuz I'm too late to sing a special and I get there in the church and I and I hear the word and by when when the when the pastor say I'm closing when they when they when they bowing their heads to close their eyes to pray gone in my car gone I didn't greet nobody not even the pastor but I was still going to church and the reason I was going to church cuz I could at least the devil couldn't tell me that you didn't you wer going to church no I did go to church now I did go to church but I went with a wrong [Music] Spirit but one day I went to church and when I went to church that day God had a sermon waiting for me now I don't even remember the sermon to this day but what I do remember is that the Holy Ghost Hallelujah came down Hallelujah at the end of the service and I could not tip out and I sat there and I lifted my hands one time too minut me and before you knew it I was broken down in tears and crying and snotting and everything else and some kind of way that Spirit came out of me it might have came out in a snot but it came out pastor's wife was the first person to come over and greet me just grinning and smiling I still remember her today just grinning and smiling and shaking my and all I could do is reach my hand out and shake and if I could have hug I would have hugged her I was free and I was so happy to be free so I know what it feels like to be bound and I also know what it feels like to be free and after that day I was on time to church right I wasn't leaving first I would stay around and fellowship with everybody after the service and there was many people in my life back then I really didn't want to fellowship with but I I made it my intention to fellowship and they used to tell me you and brother smiley y'all always doing things to Y yourself y'all all y'all go play basketball and y'all go do this and y'all go we we would intentionally brothers let's go out to eat brothers let's do this brothers let's do that I want to make sure they got that Spirit off of them and look if you don't know how to play basketball it's okay now don't stop the other brothers from playing basketball just because you don't know how to play I I I enjoy playing so don't stop me now cuz sometime people trying to put a spirit on you you like fishing Go Fish fishing I don't like fishing I like basketball now I can't really play basketball the way I used to play you brother the brothers be wanting me to come out there and I be thinking I got a little something and then my body say my about say hey all right you keep on you got to preach on Sunday and and the devil looking forward to taking me out on so find something else I can do I got to read this hidden life with Christ brother Rand say now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel people can I put this and message people has been deceived beli D in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his Spirit that's your spirit then I will it says then I will put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you many times you get the new spirit and think you got the holy spirit because you had a good feeling on your flesh and there was good music music and some good singing and all that now you really think you got something boy we had a great time in church but what happened on the inside many times you get the new spirit and think you got the Holy Spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't divy up to that so if we had all this great time y'all know we get ready to have some powerful meetings y'all know all this getting ready to happened here but we got to be ready spiritually cleaned out ready for God to do something otherwise we G to miss out on what God got other people going to come here and get the blessing and leave with it all we are to just host I don't want to just be no host no I I want God to move and I want to be a part of it Lord whatever you doing in this season don't do it without [Music] [Applause] me your life don't givey up to that now brother R say that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth it goes on many people that spirit that new spirit God had to God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit oh we didn't I hope we got that your spirit ain't good your spirit ain't good you need a new spirit amen and when God give you a new spirit that's so that you can get along with his Spirit CU God can't dwell in no filthy vessel and sometime it Ain it ain't just filthy life right it's a filthy Spirit God can't God can't dwell in that God can't dwell in a temple like that so so so God got to get rid of your your old Spirit got to die and then God got to give you a new spirit so when his Holy Spirit Come it could actually sit in the middle of your new spirit the Holy Spirit ain't coming to your old Spirit the Holy Spirit coming to your new spirit I don't care what the pastor said I ain't shaking that brother hand you need a new spirit I know I I know get back and step but not for me you need a new spirit and let me also tell you something when you get your new spirit that ain't even the Holy Ghost right you just getting ready to re receive the holy ghost look at this now the new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit Well some people so mean I should have underlined that one some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves you wouldn't even hang with you if you won't shake your own hand you know you got a problem you so mean mean and know what the prophet say I I'mma tell you I got so many more slides but I'mma cut it I'm because I I I can save it I come back this a part two this a that a preach brother Jack that I preach you you so [Music] mean you can't even get along with your own self you know you're in bad condition you ought to be the first to hit an altar and we we have prayer for people from 9:00 to 10:00 some of y'all know y'all need to be in prayer and won't even come in the church for prayer but I got a Hallelujah I got a thank you Jesus I got a glory once they hit my note boy I got it there and won't come in here for prayer here early enough for prayer but won't come into the church to pray saints come all the way to the church here you at the church you here and you choose to sit in your car what is this what if I did that I'm here y'all see my car out there and the pastor who preaching today Pastor in the car what does that sound right to y'all y'all would think something was wrong with me what you think I think about you and if there is something wrong tell me amen now let me just say this while I'm here yeah I know with us we got another Deacon down the church and and so the the let's let's put it this way the task force of the police force gets a little stronger hello amen change will be be happening all of us have to be willing to adjust to change it is needful and necessary it is not only for this group this we are preparing for the future and if we don't have certain things in place for the future you're just going to see a church full of chaos we don't want a church of C we want a church in order we want a church following what the message say and we need all these eyes to help us amen so don't don't don't don't don't Buck against what what you voted for don't do that and you say well I ain't vote well you got another we got another problem then we got another problem if you can't vote in your own church now we need to really sit down and talk praise the Lord let's get rid of these demons amen amen amen the Bible says small foxes that spoil the vine I said I can't preach like this over there in England that ain't my church but here get back in Step amen I I I I I know where the Lord taking us I know what things I got to deal with so you know what I I set myself a timer you know what my timer say I got five minutes now I'mma tell y'all something I could just override that timer I ain't listen I'm not going to do this time thing I'm going just keep preaching I got so much more material I'm going just keep preaching I'm going weigh y'all out I can do that I I could absolutely do that or I can be an example to the ministers that when we set a timer it's okay to break it the Holy Ghost done said everything he wanted to say for today I know that and now we going to watch and see what happened after this sermon watch door they go out and then watch watch if they greet everybody God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit some people are so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if if he come in that's right and here's another one so doubtful and up and down y'all hear about somebody getting a little just a little cough Pastor shut the Church down people coughing Pastor you was just in Walmart people coughing all around you you ain't said nothing to nobody you actually went out to your car said I forgot something went back in and you're afraid to come to church I'm going tell you what you need you don't need a mask you need a new spirit I'm in the quote I know I'm in the quote that's right amen sister they go to work with it people you you you don't even tell your boss boss I can't come I mean someone's over here coughing how you don't tell your boss to shut the work down that's right why you going to tell me to shut the church down amen I

anoint you with oil let us do what the Bible say do amen praise the Lord hallelujah and when they tell a brother he got three viruses you got Co you don't have Co you got you don't even know what to believe like brother Troy say they be making it up they don't even know what they dealing with it's a spirit the prophet told us it's a spirit and you can't overcome a spirit with natural means that's it now a not telling you not to wear your mask you can wear your mask somebody ask me that the other day it's a mask is a preference it's where you and if you know you sick you you probably should have on a mask if you know you're sick praise the Lord keep on your mask we don't want nothing spreading we don't want to be a a a a a uh a super spreader event we're not trying to do that praise the Lord but I'm going tell you now um we can have have some faith that God going to protect us in the midst of this even in communion oh that sister cough and she going up there oh oh oh Lord you caral you need a new spirit Lord Heal my sister while she going up there to take that communion father heal my brother while he going up to take that communion you were wounded for his transgressions bruised for his iniquity the chastisement of his pieces upon him with your stripes I declare healing am amen so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with this Spirit when it comes I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his holy spirit in their Amen to dwell with you and abide with you that's what we call drop the mic let's pray father we're grateful for the word grateful for the truth because the Bible tells us that we shall know truth the only way we going to get free is through truth help us

morning amen amen amen let me just appreciate the word of God this morning you know I I was just thinking about something as I was sitting in the back listening to brother Jack preach and you know from experience you know it takes a real pastorial gift to be able to say what really needs to be said those these types of uh sermons ain't easy on the flesh cuz we would rather say things that's going to make the church go up in flames and we running and shouting and amen you know these types of things is when they say a everybody get quiet you can almost hear pendra you know why because it's dealing with the soul it's not it's not dealing with human emotions it's dealing with the soul so you you appreciate brother Jack amen amen that's that's a a just a real a real man of God I I appreciate brother Jack for his his St stand for what's what's right because if we going to get go on a Rapture this is what we going to need he put himself in it he say I got issues I got things

I'm not going to hold you I won't take an hour text after the preacher amen I'm will let you go is is a little song that I like to sing if I can remember it uh let us go on in the name of Jesus let us possess every gate of our enemies PE let us stand at the Forefront of the battlefield for we more than able to overcome amen I think that's enough of that let's bow our heads for a word of prayer that was too high of a key I started out y'all forgive me gracious father we just thank you for the word of God this morning we appreciate brother Jack uh getting himself out of the way and uh you using them in a in a you know uh just a mighty way Amen to just set the church in order Lord establish us you know I was reminded of uh the scripture with the Queen of Sheba what what uh C her attention with seeing a seeing a church Lord in order uh wasn't so much the gifts and things of that nature but it it she walked in and saw everything in its place Lord and that was the thing that really did something for her down in our soul and uh so you know we we want to just find the order of the word for ourselves and it's for for a body and that'll be the thing that'll be attractive Amen to unbelievers coming in Lord and people coming in and just looking for the word of God you know that they'll come from the north the South the East and the West in spite of you know the different things
