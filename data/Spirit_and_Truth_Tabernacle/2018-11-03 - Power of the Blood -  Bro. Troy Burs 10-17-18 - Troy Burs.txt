me for the Bible tells me through a man you believe that's a night Amen if you grab your Bibles a man there's a passage of Scripture amen we're gonna go to Ephesians the fifth chapter amen and we're gonna begin reading at the 15th verse I mean a glad to be in the house of the law man a man I tell you that song means so much to me after this little studying the word here realized that how much I Savior loved us a man Ephesians the fifteenth chapter I mean the fifth chapter in the fifteenth verse says see that you see that ye walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with the wine where is in excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ made a Lord out of blessing to the reading of his word a man you maybe see that I want to keep it standing now we're going to go over start out here to Genesis Genesis the second chapter Genesis the second chapter in the seventh verse Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul a man if you go over to the second shot at a 21st verse and the law calls the deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up his flesh instead thereof and the reel which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man a man may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us pray Lord did Heavenly Father Lord I just actually Lord God - Lord use my lips O Father God my faculties Oh father God - just speak to your people of father God precious name Amen amen oh we're going to speak on this evening the power of the blood the power of the blood now I'd like you to go back to Ephesians for just a little bit here go back to Ephesians and we're gonna continue reading from the ninth the fifth chapter nineteen first a man speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns I'm sorry good of the 21st verse submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God he says your wives submit yourselves unto your husband's as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body wherefore the church is subjected unto Christ let the wives be to their own husband's in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ has loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word now I just wanna I just I just want to take my time a little bit here and I'll just lose one of talking just and let God just have his way like that alright we're looking at this scripture here a lot of times and we a lot of time some sorts of the read this passage of scriptures and they Creon's just a little bit because they looking at it through the eyes you know of the husband when I got to submit to this man and the man said get a little bit puffed up a little bit feel good you tell them - why not - do what I say they got to submit themselves to me but I want you to understand and realize that that script is not you talking to sisters that's if you look beneath that scripture that Scripture is talking to the bride if you read all down there the Bible says that now I heard you to know that this is a great mystery he's not just talking to women being subject to their earthly husband but he's talking about earthly bride being subjective to the Lord Jesus Christ amen we must obey and submit ourselves to his will and to his way now lately I've noticed here that the Lord has been leading a certain kind of direction we've had two ministers visiting ministers come to one minister said only you know if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost then the other minister came and said I'm thinking that people don't realize that they really don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters that tells me something that God is trying to tell us something my brothers and sisters if we took that the Holy Ghost should be and he is the most important thing to the believer it is the very life of God you might have heard me say recently a few times that God came down and created a blood cell in the womb of Mary a man that was not the blood of a man that shed at Calvary it was the blood of Almighty God that was shared there and Calvary for what for the remission of our sins that we can go through the blood and come out clean on the other side amen it has to be a new brush my brothers and sisters we can't just go along a man with the good feel Oh which Oh with the good idea say kid we have the Holy Ghost amen because the Holy Ghost it's supposed to free do something we're going to get into that a little bit we see back here in Genesis that God is talking about him and his bride here in Ephesians he's talking about a love affair he's saying wives submit yourselves to your husband's in all things to his will a man and husband loves your wives as Christ loved the church that he might sanctify by the cleansing and the washing of the word that he might present it to himself a church without spot or wrinkle listen we look back here in Genesis and we see that that when God created that he crea the spirit say let us create man in our image he created man as a triune being we are flesh spirit and soul okay so he then went on down and he created the flesh of man took from the dust of the earth not in the recent Bible study Jack showed scriptures that that Doug that body is going to go back to the dust now we read the engine that he breathed into Adams nostrils when he believed in the atoms mantras that he became a living soul now we're not talking about just breathing the air he became eternal at that point he became God on the earth the Bible says so at that point he was eternal God owners he breathed into him the breath of life now I want you to understand what things my brothers and sisters I did a little study on looking I said that's blood the blood one thing I found one of the uses and the uses of the blood in our body it's to carry oxygen to our members to our organs that they function the blood carries the life of God but if he no breathe on you there's no life to carry it has to be breathed on you the blood is there waiting for you to excel hey man the breath of God he go on in Genesis day and he said he created took a reel of Adam and he created a woman a man he said you are now flesh of my flesh bone of my bone so what does that mean she now has the same blood coursing through her veins as Adam why because she accepted she came from him they meant so the Spain blood the same breath the same oxygen that was closer to Adam when the Lord Himself breathed into his nostrils was talking through her veins cuz that was her husband Amen now we want to look at something here lord help me in the message blasphemous names a man paragraph 180 folk I'm gonna start at a 185 now it reads now they take the scripture from Bank he's talking about the Jehovah's Witness because the Jehovah's Witness believed that we all breathe the same air I got something for you here now they take the scripture back from that God breathed into his nostrils and they became a living soul now I want to ask you something if it was man what kind of breath did he breathe before God breathed into him breathe his breath of life into him see what kind of breast was it he was a breathing living man well then he then if that be so then every animal is a living soul cause the breath of a human soul or the breath of a human soul or our soul and our and all together there Jesus would have had then Jesus would have had to die wouldn't have had to die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient so brother the argument don't stand but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life then he became a living soul so that they sold that can't die now watch now say we're going to get up into the hundred plumb up to our elbows notice the breasts the breed that the breasts the breasts of eternal life into the nostrils and he became a eternal soul because God breathed not what nature done but what God did he breathed eternal he breathed the life into his nostrils and he became a living soul then you say to me Adam died brother but remember before he died he had a lamb that was that redeemed him hallelujah those who he foreknew he called he got a lamb to redeem him then that was a perfect type that was a type Adam fail then when Adam then the lamb was provided for Adam because already his nostrils had become the breath of eternal God and he became a living soul he was a son of God not his breath says as the African word I don't know the Greek word but the African word is called amor which means the wind and an unseen force animals breathe amor you sinners breathe amor you Saints don't breathe amor you a man then why should we struggle for eternal life if that's the eternal soul breath into the breasts why would we struggle for eternal life says that backfires brother see it just can't do it but God especially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became eternal person with God had power like God he was an amateur God he was God on earth not God in heaven now God on the earth and someday the sons of God will again become God jesus said so he said it is written in your law that ye are God's then if you can call those who call themselves God amen he says when when I am son of God see now with him is something deep watch this and we going to drive it down now here they are he is now a son of God but he makes a mistake he knows he's done wrong now remember Adam was not deceived the Bible said so in first Timothy not see but the woman was deceived when the transgression Adam with Eve because it was his wife back to Ephesians it was his wife he loved her so much that he was willing to walk out with her to redeem her amen now we recognize that that blood that was shared for us at Calvary God created a blood cell in the Marian that blood cell came up and grew up to Jesus it was his men Redeemer it was God said oh he gonna he call us bride he was there to put to take out a Gentile bride now in order for us to take the blood we have to come through the blood amen so and how is that we going to do that he said there must be a new verse you must be born again you must come through the fight through the water amen verse is missing a birth is message first there's water didn't there's blood then there's life have to come through the blood haiya Pentecost he told him I go to prepare for you he favored work there were I go that she may be also a man he said going to O Jerusalem amen to the upper room and wait there amen and I will sing you amen the Holy Ghost and they was there in the upper room on one Accord and they stayed there for a while the expectation of God was going to do they had no idea all of us certainly said that there came a sound from heaven like him the Russian wing amen and they will all fear what was it the God just breathed on them received baptism of the Holy Ghost amen had a child oh how does it you know a child is alive a child they man they had that child is born they don't live until they take that first breath not until they take that first breath that's why the nurse got to take the baby clean out the airways and everything and probably say they hold him up and give him a little part of hazard stimulation give him a little spanking and that baby beginning to cry once that baby beginning to cry what is he doing he's breathing and Helen me life amen the blood begins to flow a man is ironic back the world symbolizes the heart we love I wonder what they got that from that they symbolizes the heart a man wouldn't love and that love that heart beats and it pumps the blood it sends the blood it comes from a place of love my brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost come from among you you'll love your brothers and sisters you'll love your neighbor your love goals that despitefully use you that is the capstone of the Holy Ghost hey man it's that blood pumping that life carrying what he turn a life the oxygen of God to your organs through a minimum amen he's redeeming a brighter to himself my brothers and sisters he didn't do it for anybody he said animals don't breathe this breath Simmons don't breathe this breath but watch come through that birth once you come through new birth no breathe food there's a new takes place you begin to breathe the blood of God what each breath metal breakfast of the eternal break it down they need us to have breath and it said point to one day my brothers and sisters that would no matter what see the devil so tell us that we okay you don't have to do thing you got a feeling on your flesh you are alright fella let's see he put you through the taste he'll let different things happen in your life you'll get a little temptation oh you let something happen and they say you fail they'd let you know you're in there yet it's to let you know you ain't done yet my god tell you what Satan has has lined up scarecrows all along the option to scare people from going to the altar and talking to Jesus confessing their sins confessing their faults and breathing oh god help me when you breathe out your mouth I need to talk about from your mind because God knows your voice I know my wife's voice my wife can be in a room with a hundred people and she's called my name I recognize her voice vice versa she knows my voice in a stranger she would not follow you'll have to call on his name you have to breathe his name their prophets saying when the temptation come just breathe the name of Jesus and the devil will flee that's what he said my brothers and sisters that's what he said it's power in the blood there's power in the blood we're not talking about just the blood of and everything about the blood of Almighty God no but remember I say we are trying to be if the blood was shed for the healing of our body amen for the salvation of our soul that's two areas anyway here yo spirit the blood will wash you and cleanse you through and through on all levels my momma we all got different hurts and things that we go through you don't mind if I just let the Lord lead me oh my my parents divorced at a very young age I was toe up I was seven years old I loved my mother and loved my father didn't understand what was going on that would tell you it bought me four years four years are better with that thing complex trying to get enough don't know who I am pull from one side pull to this I don't know what I'm a young boy but into pieces but God knew just what he was doing God was in control all the time and I'm sure we have things things that we've gone through in this life that has taught us to piece things we don't talk about no no it's buried deep within our subconscious and it hinders us give Jesus He shed his blood for the remission of your seeing the healing of your spirit and the healing of your body all right you don't have to live under those chains of bandages anymore the blood has been shed blood of God there's no chemical on earth man could produce try to produce chemicals that are clean and white thing the way Oh our pilot tried to wash the blood if you say what are you going to wash that blood off your hands takes a repentant soul amen the blood of Jesus and there's only one way you me must come you must be born again you must be born again amen hear the pardon please the message party he says now the word death means separation when we die this way it does not mean our physical death that we are dead jesus said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die now that that speaking of is separation from the presence of God but the physical death that we have to go through here is yet now I'm gonna go down to 51 now from Adam until now man has tried his own substitute he tried his best to do something a little better than what God did and that's the natural man man always trying to better to better something to make it a different way he wants to inject his own ideas into the plan of God and that's why we stand tonight separated as Christian people of the world by barriers of denomination denominational barriers it is not because that it is because it does this because that man has injected his own ideal in the plan of God crowd got 52 and Adam Express man in the garden when he made his self a fig leaf apron to face God it's something that he did himself from the fig leaves he tried education towers cities idols civilization denomination but if that it ever remains the same God only accepts his subjects under the blood that's all education has totally failed more education we get the further we get from each other denomination has totally failed we draw lines of barriers and each one trying to get that denomination higher than the other and it breaks fellowship civilization has merely brought about fusion cities towers and whatever more has all failed God planted still remains the same under the blood the blood must be displayed over the doorpost over the doorpost it must be a display blood now how do we display the blood how do we display what we go through birth on the end of that new versus worth life so that display must be the life of God must believe on display that's how you when you got it that you are producing that life listen he will be ready Fijians God took on a wife amen the Prophet was talking about he got to say read between the lines if I go away I go to a trip and my wife send me a letter and she say certain things in the letter I know able to read between the lines it's a love message from her to me man and we have this Bible is a love message but you must pass it see everybody read this Bible all denominations read this Bible but see you must be able to pass that thing to the filter unless you read that Bible through God's filter you're not getting it you're not gonna get it because this is the world for this thing you must you must put on the eyeglasses of God to be able to read the love letter you must be able to read it through the filter to be able to read between the lines that's the only way you're gonna be able to receive the Holy Ghost that's the only way you're gonna be able to get the message from him amen now the prophets say we in a three-bedroom house we live in a three back up guys we have the living room we have the kitchen and bedroom we go into the living room to have fellowship with him the kitchen is what we serve them it's a service to see but we must get beyond the living room in the kitchen we must go into the bedroom and and and and and take out our husband and where life is produced we must be willing to lay ourselves at your altar and receive the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters he said that still remains one way that you want something from your father you must cry out for it I gave the example about that little baby soon as he get that spanking you know until she cry out for it you're not gonna get it into you cry out for it amen I'm reminded of a brother that was to mister morning said he had a favorite and he lost his ring down in the commode and and he didn't know how he was gonna get his Ranga he had just got the ring in class ring and that ring fellow and the next day he come on he got his wrench out he down on his knees and he took that toilet apart and the plug he trying to find that ring got his are on all the way he said he didn't care it was a commode he trying to get that ring trying to get that ring you might say well I'm not sticking my hand in that you don't want it bad enough God left you a ring they say here's this ring and when I come back we're gonna get married he gave you a ring took you went to the church going said I'm fittin to go now but go over there I'm gonna leave you something a ring to put on your finger which what identifies you as my wife densifies you who you are Amen you go through the through the blood then you are identified with Christ you have the ring you showing the ring you proud of the ring but you lose the ring you would tap the house trying to find that ring well I don't want him to come home and realize I lost the ring and ain't even tried to find it ma no you don't have the ring or did you ain't even trying to find it Turks we got to shake ourselves we God came here with two ministers it's a warning my brothers and sisters my wife can attest this message had been on my heart months ago and he just been giving their little things give me little things now we still in part in that we're gonna now add them until now let me see here I'm sorry hey man you love the Lord hey man he says I'm gonna paragraph 55 says we believe every word that Jehovah says but that didn't expel it you might have come ago back they might have confessed that we believe every word that Jehovah says but that didn't expel it they had to display the token the blood must be shown that's the way it is tonight I believe that every Christian has to display the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanse them from all the things of the world now it's time now in that time the token must be on the door it must be there regardless of how religious how religious the house was how religious the people how well they had brought up their children how fine they had attended church how well they had displayed all the things of God he said it still at that last hour where it showed between death and life the blood had to be displayed the blood showed that an innocent substitute had been taken in place of the worshiper he says now the chemistry of the blood the red blood cell the red blood itself was a sign on the door that the house was safe under the blood now that was a title now in the last days we are coming back again to the hour where we believe we're delivering his church I believe I believe as and as certain as the blood has to stand for a memorial so does the token have to be it's required today for now they could not take the chemistry of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and place it upon their hearts door but you see that time an animal died which was a lamb and it showed that the animal was dead the blood was on the door so the life that was in the animal could not come upon the worshipper but the animal doesn't have a soul so that was in the animal could not come upon the worshipper but today when the blood of God his own son was shed at Calvary for the pardoning and release the life that was in the blood was God himself and the Holy Spirit returns upon the church upon his believer and it's a token in these last days that he will pass over the man or the wormans that accepted the death of theirs for a substitute a man a man a man the message miracles sister a man now the Prophet was talking about that Jonah in the belly of the whale I'm sorry you got it a man 188 just above it a man now Jonah in the belly of the were acted first upon the word and God know that he was gone from the physical hands that he was gone as far as physical his hands were bound his feet was vital that preacher to the Gentiles was thrown out of the ship into the whale's belly and down to the bottom of the sea amen we're gonna go down there to 189 I don't want to do too much read my wife Jeremy don't do too much read amen the storm we're gonna start here all hope was gone when he was in the ship now he was in the whales belly farther away farther away from the hope than ever when only he if only he he could see the belly of the whale he said there are lying vanities I won't believe them anymore but look towards your holy temple the holy temple wasn't looking down he said it's up there so I'm looking towards it and when he seen God's miracle somehow oxygen came into the whale and he just breathed normally for three days and took a nice little rest and Rob take these for today journey across a wicked City bound and preached the gospel God all freshened up a man with some new oxygen out of heaven mine some new oxygen out of heaven it couldn't come out of the will and it couldn't come out of the sea so it had to come from God Oh breathed on us tonight Lord let the oxygen of the Word of God and the power of his resurrection that we can stay alive in these last and wicked days breathe upon us O Holy Spirit this is it brother breathe Lord fill us with the oxygen like I told you this morning about that duck I don't want to read I don't want to get into that but let him talking about the oxygen breeze on us Lord that ought to be your prayer that ought to be your desire for the Holy Spirit for God to breathe on you the breath into your nostrils and you become a living soul what is it you must first die this flesh must die we must yield ourselves and surrender ourselves to God's will amen and he promised us that we baptized heat he will give us the whole ago we just not asking for it we just not sincere he said if you be sincere he'll hold nothing from you know the problem that out that but then it's in here and I don't want to do a whole lot of reen and everything the prophet of God say we get ritualized we begin after a while we come to church it's just a ritual it's just something to do it becomes a form of godliness but denying the power we have to come in my brother under expectation we have to come in really seeking something from God if there's something in your life and you know you know but the brother said is you know whether you got the Holy Ghost or not he said you know where that you got the Holy Ghost in life but what happened we come in and we sit there we get in these seats and we get comfortable and I believe sit on one side and insomnia you sit on the other side and he tell you don't you move don't you believe that don't you move and the other said they're going to go to sleep going to go to sleep he'd and then the devil got Scarecrow's lined up don't you move don't you go too don't you cry for night you bet not Satan it that's the truth the Prophet had a vision he said he's seen a vision he said he's seen the man with the three hooks and he just beating that woman BAM get in there we were born we were first kid coming to the world speaking lies we were married in a shotgun wedding he was an abusive husband you didn't have a choice get in that booth he beat you down give you with all kind of disease and affliction he give you it hurt but your heart some of you ain't the crop they had a good cry to the devil broke your heart when the last time you cried from the mercies of God when the last time you shouldn't tell for God's love but the devil will come along and do something and in your heart feelings hurt crater or the place it's a shotgun wind he will abuse him in repeating the Prophet said he got Popeye like Moses lucky hey some spinach muscles Bank groupie and he said now you hit again you're gonna have to deal with me what was it it was Christ coming to his bride shed of his blood saying that you get the divorce that old man and be married a new be married a new but you first got to come through the blood you first got to have that you got to leave that old me which is your flesh and it'll be born under the will of Almighty God come to the altar my brothers and sisters you know we all know we living in the last days the tenth will know he coming for a bride without a spot or wrinkle there is something we have to make ourselves ready now we can't do anything but cry out to God seal me Lord fill me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that I may apply to tokoto God and appeal discipline don't let me become ritual we come to church and it's just a routine routine routine routine that's the devil fainted you sleep amen I was preaching to myself - we gotta get lost and see about this thing and brothers and sisters you ain't all right to tell you'll are you all right no you're a wait cuz it's the prophecy if we was on wait there you will see now we see it imagine we see healings we see all sorts of things happening we thank God for it but all my brothers and sisters will see a lot more promise you yes sir if we all can you yield and surrender ourselves to our husband submit yourselves say I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also a man glory to God thinking man's filter 179 he said said as if you're a thinking people tonight here and out in the land where the message is going your desire would be a Bible taste not a denominational taste for you will be judged by the very Bible the word that I'm asking you to do asking you to your souls through it and to reject one word of it and not let your soul pass through that one word you will be turned down what do you mean by that you will be turned down depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't even know you to to not let you one word for man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it will be brought into you predestinated and when the Lord breathes upon you his Spirit will quicken that word to reality and you'll see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever leave the world denominational the dark denomination religious pack let it lay like that cigarette pack in the woods let it rot Let It Be Kay it's the wrong filter and take the word which is Christ that gives you reaches and

marriage a man we see that's why you know marriage is so important and it's so sacred because it is the very thought in the heart of God a man when he created Adam he said it's not good for man to dwell alone a man because he was Elohim and he know what it was like to be alone not that he was lonely because he had his thoughts he's God he's not lonely a man but he said it's not good for a man to dwell alone he wanted a bride he wanted a wife a man and he come to this Gentile through the Old Testament down to this New Testament hid it and he died on the cross for a Gentile bride for a Gentile bride and we must be cleansed we must go through the blood we must be we have to be born again I surrender also a man you love the Lord Amen so let us not come ritualistic let us not take these opportunities a man that we have to come to church to come to the house of God a man if if if I was going away on a trip and doctor sent my wife a letter and I say well meet me at a certain

know you we don't want to get to that point but we want to have the blood of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus Christ on display every day of our law I read that scripture there Oh in Ephesians there to walk circumspectly to walk circumspectly means that you know there's a house over there in Palm Beach that they have broken bottles all along the top of the wall this is an African thing that they do in Africa they have break bottles and in their use of adhesive to glue the bottles the broken shards of glass at the top of the wall so burglars and wild animals won't climb the wall but you see a cat says they saw a cat walking along that top of that wall and he's walking and he's watching everywhere that he put his foot he's welcome circumspectly along the top of that wall being real careful where he places foot that's how we're to walk through this evil aid let us walk circumspectly with our hearts and our minds feed on him I saw you surrender or they may let us stay nice feed and sing

of the Holy Ghost it's the blood of God Almighty that was shared at Calvary for the remission of our sins and he sent by the Holy Spirit a man as an identification that his life that was in the blood

love you how we praise you we thank you that your voice would speak to us we cried to us O God through a precious brother Troy Lord and Oh God don't let it just be in one ear and out the other but God let us really take heed to what is being spoken to our hearts Lord let us hear what the Spirit is trying to say in this hour and God as your prophet even told us there's one feeling but many refilling Xand Lord we don't want to just become comfortable we want to become complacent God we want to press in and receive everything that you have for us changing us every time we come to the service being changed from glory to glory if we have not received the Holy Ghost Lord don't let us rest Lord let us get desperate about this let us be serious about this Oh God the same desperation we had to want to be baptized and water we need that same desperation when it comes to wanting to be baptized with the spirit father this is this goes beyond a man pleasing men father we need to know we need to know that we please God we need to know father without a shadow of a doubt that we have done all things that are pleasing in the sight God so let Lord please please don't let us miss this God let us receive all that you have for us if there's sin in our life that might be blocking us from even got what you have in store Lord deal with our hearts let us make things right that we might not hinder the Holy Spirit from flowing through every vein we need every fiber of our being filled with the Spirit of God we need it Lord daily we need him God don't let us miss with what the voice of God is speaking in this hour the Prophet said we'll sit right here there to go right through us and we won't even know it we don't want that to be our testimony we want to we want to get a hold of everything you got Oh God we want your breath to breathe on us eternal life is found a man in your breath that's what the Holy Ghost what produces Emma so God let it flow through every every vein let it flow through our being or God father that's that's what we desire that's what we need Jesus Oh goddess in Jesus name we pray amen come on give the Lord a hand of praise tonight blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord man you can be seated in his presence you may certainly thank the Lord for thought tonight on the power of the blood and just kind of reminded of the story that the Prophet told of them there was a man one time that was filled with the Holy Ghost and his friends noticed a difference in him they noticed a tremendous difference cinnamon one of his friends said you know I want that what you got and and he and you know I said well you know I'm I want you to come pray with me and they went to a particular and they told them say well you're not got like this you're not gonna get it like this and they said well what you mean I'm not gonna get it like that so you know you you know you it's gonna take a little bit Matt so they went to another little area and and he said no you're not gonna get it here either say no no you're not gonna get it here either he said well what you mean we'll take me where I'm gonna get it so it took him I'm actually cutting in and out here he says I'm he says come follow me and they took him a man to a pigpen when I got to the Pigpen all the muck and everything around and he said now follow me out here and they say well I got to go out there and I got to do that he's like he's like yeah come on to see this with you and get it at right out here Annie and he went out a man into the Pigpen and God Philip filled with the Holy Ghost but God had to get him out of his comfort his places of comfort right and you know and the things that he thought would produce it you know because oftentimes we have our own imagination a man as to as to what the Holy Ghost is all about but you know as God got God knows what he wants from us in each one of us know a man whether it's something that we've really really struck that spot with God and I'll tell you what a man let's not come to church I agree a man let's not come to church and just make a tradition a man let's make this a place where we can receive a man from God need the Spirit of God every time we come amen we need the Spirit of God and don't be ashamed if this altars always open for anybody that wants to come a man I remember the brother that one time he was in the prophets meetings and whatnot the prophets meet prophet told a story about him but he was was in a situation where a storm at bluing over blown over is the hurricane or something like that and blew blow over that blew over the camp and he was in there praying there was an old lady there she was she was praying and she was all comfortable saying well if I if the storm take me away I'm settled I'm set up my heart is settled with God and I know everything gonna be alright so the young man went into her little area into her tent there and or the cabin that she had and and he prayed a little bit and she he saw the calmness over he said to himself I say you know what I need that same type of calmness and he he after he come through the storm the first thing he did was go to the church and before the preacher could even come up to preach that young man was on the altar crying out to God right that man meant business with God right he meant business with God and and I think sometimes we got it we got to show God that we mean business with them right Amen let's let's break out of our comfort zone let's do whatever it take to make sure that's fine what God is requiring of us a man wouldn't it be a shame to sit here and have all this word but be missing the main thing and that's to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I don't want that to be our testimony church amen I don't want it to be my testimony Amen I'll take this a man to heart tonight and we will begin to do things if we know if we don't have it let's press in until we get it amen let's press in until we get it it's important absolutely important brother branham said we can't come in the rap if we don't have it we can't come in the rapture so a lot of things we can do we can go to church and get away with but we talked about making a rapture and it's gonna take more than this a man it's going to take the baptism of the Spirit of God the life of God the breath of God amen flowing through us it's gonna be necessary it's gonna be necessary I'm talk about I want to stay to get into your spirit that when you leave church that's all you talking about is receiving the Holy Ghost amen everything else becomes secondary nothing else matters amen I mean tell people you ain't got time to talk because you just want to receive to speak God and right and and and he you know he's not limited to just coming down this church I know people don't got so desperate God come down and they home amen I mean you know another question is when was the last time the Spirit of God moved in your house when the last time the Spirit of God moved in your house I don't know people don't been feeling the spirit driving along in a car I got to pull the car over right stop driving because the Spirit of God is so strong in there right I mean you know the type of experiences that we used to have praise the Lord Amen God take us back to that you know that that's just we need a little bit more that comes sharing testimony I was driving along in my car the power God hit me you know I just couldn't stop crying I was just you know I was just I mean I was underneath an anointing you know but you know what when you start sharing testimonies like that somebody else get annoying it in a God do something for me you did it for them do something me you know and in US and it's easy for us when we see the the natural blessings flowing oh we ready to jump on that God give me some of that you did it for them do it for me what about the spiritual blessings hey man we need to get we need to get desperate to want to see God do the same thing you feel my brother Lord you feel me you feel my sister gods you'll feel me we need to have that type of desperation when it comes to God I'll tell you whether to settle the church it will settle the church the bat-signal Holy Ghost will change everything a man a man I appreciate this tonight a man I truly appreciate this tonight a man breathe Lord fill us with your oxygen breathe Lord fill us with your oxygen that's what we need in this church that's what we need a man praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen hallelujah let's prepare a man for tonight's offering and we'll prepare to let you go we're gonna be coming back on on Saturday night no service Friday night but we'll be back here on Saturday night and and and I want to encourage you all you know even as we come back Saturday you know or even Sunday let's try to get a church early fee and if we can get in prayer a man just just praying they you know if you get to church early best thing you can do when you get here is get on your knees and start praying start praying for the surface start praying the Lord send your anointing right send your anointing break yokes do whatever whatever is necessary but the best thing you can do when you get to church or let's just start praying a man for the service but we we have to create an environment for God to move amen amen we got to create an environment we got to do something praise the Lord so you know if you're able to get here early service gonna start at 7:00 o'clock on Saturday night but if you're able to get here early come on and come on in and start praying amen and just just just whatever you can do to help create an atmosphere Amen hallelujah Sunday morning create an atmosphere any time any time we go to church it ought to be a practice of ours to get there early amen and start praying hallelujah amen praise look you know as little things like that that used to really change the atmosphere but we right now we're so busy it's so hard you know and you all realized that's the best attack of the enemy because that's what happened in the first Exodus they but it made them so busy that they could do nothing right but but that's the devil trying to do the same thing in this hour so we want it we want to do all we can to break out of that and and Lord just give me a little time so I can just get there and just get in prayer just a little bit before the service starts just kidding i'ma get underneath the anointing so God can move and and and whatever way he desires here in our midst amen praise the Lord brothers if you all would come tonight Amen praise the Lord man let's pray over tonight's offering father we are grateful for the opportunity we have to give to you tonight as you have given so much to us thank you for every blessing that has flown Lord that has been been given to us and been passed through our direction but God the most important blessing we could ever have is the the blessing of being filled with the Holy Ghost so father we pray that Lord the same way that had a write gay Lord the way that you gave back to her is by going and bringing salvation to her two boys as we gave Lord may the best thing we can do to receive and return is Lord not just salvation but healing of our bodies and our souls and a feeling in our soul God that's the best thing we could ever receive in return of this so we actually use this for the furtherance of your kingdom may you be glorified and magnify in our giving soon Jesus name we pray amen amen I surrender [Music] hi Surrender Oh to the my bleep sit Savior [Music] surrender oh I surrender oh oh [Music] I surrender all well it's all to thee my blessed Savior [Music] Surrender Oh amen praise the Lord just a quick testimony I heard brother Nathan that give me a call on yesterday and he was telling me just about something that happened in their church here recently they were there's a brother that's been visiting a church from one of the countries in Africa and he speaks primarily French and doesn't really knows very very little English you know but it does speak just a little bit and he's been coming to church and he's like lord I just can't understand anything that they're saying you know I mean they just it's just not my first language so I just I'm catching very little so he prayed a prayer on Sunday morning said Lord let me hear what the preachers saying please God let me hear what the preachers saying and and they said they you know was going through the preliminaries a song service that man can hear anything him and I think brother Nathan happen to call his name during one an announcement and he heard that and that was not only heard and then brother Nathan picked up you know to read his Bible and just begin to you know go into the sermon and that when he picked up the man say he felt somebody touch him on his back and he was getting ready to turn around and see who it was it touched when he heard a voice say no don't don't turn around just just keep your eyes focused keep looking forward and and as he kept his eyes looking forward brother Nathan started his sermon the man stood up and and he was you know listing and and so he stood up and brother Nathan like why he was say a man sometimes and it's like well the guy could barely understand why they're saying a man is saying he won't sit down he just stated his State standing the entire service they say won't sit down said he didn't do this the other night why are you doing this now I said this is kind of strange so at the end of the sermon the man went up you say you know a miracle happiness image this if this miracle happened in here underneath this ministry I want this man just to pray for me just just just because I think he need to pray and I'm you know brother Nathan pray for me went back to the scene after services to brother Nathan said something touched me and told me to keep looking forward and say when it did that it something's like something was interpreting every word that you said why you were preaching I can't hear every word that's why I stood to my feet because I heard everything you sent and and after they you know after the sermon was done he couldn't hear anymore but his prayer was Lord let me hear what the preachers saying right and God blessed him and he heard exactly what the preacher was saying and that is what happened in the book of Acts right that is what happened that's what we were talking about in our Sunday School on on on Sunday and you know so to see God doing things like that today he is the same yesterday today and forever and Church we ought to expect these type of things when we come together amen let's not limit God let's put let's let's create environment so he can move in this place amen and do what he does best amen god bless you let's have a word of Prayer and we'll prepare to dismiss you tonight father we thank you for this opportunity we've had to come into fellowship at your feet pray to to it bless us now as we leave this place but not your presence may we go meditate them thinking on the things that we've heard here tonight and God breathe on us breathe on us God just like you breathe on you breathe into Adam the breath of life Lord also when when Jesus was on earth he pulled the disciples to decide me breathed on them Lord and said receive ye the Holy Ghost got tonight breathe on us that we might receive a man a feeling and a refilling we need the that oxygen from heaven got to come upon us Lord let us go with a heart of desperation and and God we don't limit you to where you can move we know you can move wherever so God even as we're going home maybe we meditate maybe we think on these things and and God even as we're going through the day tomorrow and on Friday Lord maybe we continue to think on these things until we come to the spot look where we feel like buddy Ryan who went to the corn fee and said God unless you fill me with the Holy Ghost you're gonna find a pile of dead bones in this field the man got desperate and when we get desperate we'll see you God will meet you Lord we gotta be desperate or will perish so help us O God to receive the words that we've heard and to apply them God in our life as our prayer bless us and keep us until we're able to meet again in this place it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you brothers we'll come at this time to dismiss you [Music] [Music]
