[52:54] throughout the years amen and just just
[52:58] just appreciate all of all the help that
[53:00] God has given the church I want to let
[53:05] managers read a couple scriptures if you
[53:08] won't just bear with me we will go back
[53:11] to our scripture out of second Peter
[53:16] chapter 1 we have been making our
[53:20] journey through war strategies and we're
[53:27] gonna pick up a different angle we
[53:29] preached war strategies patience with
[53:31] God last time and then we were together
[53:35] and this morning I want to use the
[53:38] subject war strategies patience with
[53:41] each other
[53:43] a man patience with each others won't
[53:45] have want us to have patience with God
[53:47] but another is to have patience with
[53:49] each other so we want to minister on
[53:53] that this morning and just for our
[53:56] foundation of scriptures here second
[53:59] Peter chapter 1 starting at verse 4
[54:03] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[54:07] great and precious promises that by
[54:09] these you might be partakers of the
[54:11] divine nature having escaped the
[54:13] corruption that is in the world through
[54:15] lust and beside this giving all
[54:18] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[54:22] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[54:24] temperance and to temperance patience
[54:27] and this is what we're focusing on amen
[54:30] here today patience glory to God and to
[54:36] patience godliness to godliness
[54:38] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[54:40] kindness charity but if these things be
[54:43] in you and abound they make you that you
[54:45] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[54:47] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[54:49] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[54:52] is blind and cannot see afar off and
[54:54] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[54:56] his old sins wherefore there brother
[54:58] brethren give diligence to make your
[55:00] call in an election sure but if you do
[55:02] these things you shall never follow a
[55:04] turn with me also over to Genesis
[55:07] chapter 14 in man and I forgot to
[55:11] mention to you all I had a Papa to me to
[55:14] talk with brother Oh bless this week and
[55:16] he told me to make sure that I let the
[55:19] church know that he sent his greetings
[55:21] to you all
[55:22] amen also brother brother Walker a man
[55:26] also sent his greetings to the church
[55:28] here amen Genesis 14 and we're using the
[55:35] platform of the statue of a perfect man
[55:38] because this is what God is given to us
[55:41] as believers a man this is what brings
[55:45] us to a place of perfection this is what
[55:47] gives us overcoming power these are
[55:49] things that we should be striving for
[55:51] daily and you know just constantly
[55:54] constantly don't describing just to look
[55:56] more like Jesus but I'm using it as a
[55:58] platform and then I'm going back and
[56:00] showing a man maybe in the Old Testament
[56:02] where this was applied to a man a war
[56:06] strategy was applied but will need this
[56:08] war strategy or strategies to overcome
[56:10] the enemy and our daily walk so here
[56:13] Genesis 14 verse 1 Stinson came to pass
[56:16] in the days of rafael the king of shinar
[56:20] arioch king of ellasar cheder a lot more
[56:26] king of elam and tidal king of nations
[56:29] that these made war with their king of
[56:34] sodom and with bersia king of gomorrah
[56:36] shine f king of admah and sham eber king
[56:40] of the boehm and the king of bela which
[56:43] is or all these were joined together in
[56:46] the Vale of Siddim which is the salt sea

[57:45] zeboiim and the king of bela the same as
[57:48] so are and they joined battle with them
[57:50] in the Vale of Siddim with cheddar
[57:53] cheddar a lo more the king of elam and
[57:57] with tidal king of nations and amraphel
[58:02] king of shinar arioch king of ellasar
[58:05] four kings with five and the Vale of
[58:08] Siddim was full of slime pits and the
[58:11] kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and
[58:13] fell there and they that remained fled
[58:17] to the mountain and they took all the
[58:20] goods of sodom and gomorrah and all
[58:22] their vittles and went their way and
[58:25] they took lot Abrams brothers son who
[58:29] dwelt in Sodom and his Goods and

[58:37] had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew
[58:39] for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the
[58:42] Amorite brother of ash coal and brother
[58:45] of a nur and and these were Confederate
[58:48] with Abram and when Abram heard that his
[58:51] brother was taken captive he armed his
[58:54] trained servants born in his own house
[58:56] 318 and pursued them unto damned and he
[58:59] divided himself against them and he and
[59:01] his servants by night and smoked them
[59:04] and pursued them unto Hoba which is on
[59:07] the left hand of Damascus and he brought

[1:00:06] name we pray amen amen god bless you you
[1:00:10] can be seated
[1:00:11] praise the Lord again we want to use the
[1:00:16] subject war strategies and patience with
[1:00:20] each other that is our title for today
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:29] in the statue of a perfect man brother
[1:00:33] branham tells us about these two TV
[1:00:36] speaks on two different types of
[1:00:38] patience he talks about patience with
[1:00:40] God and then he also talks about
[1:00:42] patience with one another and you know
[1:00:45] just a brief I want to read a quote that
[1:00:50] we read at the end of patience with God
[1:00:53] just to kind of hit that again he hit
[1:00:56] seven different examples in scripture
[1:00:59] about patience with God one was Abraham
[1:01:02] how he had patience with God Noah and
[1:01:05] how he had patience with God Moses had
[1:01:09] patience with God and I believe he said
[1:01:11] with Moses and when you've done what you
[1:01:14] know God has told you to do then just
[1:01:16] stand still and be patient amen when
[1:01:18] you've done everything that God told you
[1:01:20] to do just stand stand still and be
[1:01:22] patient don't worry about it
[1:01:23] God will take care of everything else
[1:01:25] right a man sometimes we find ourselves
[1:01:28] fighting trying to prove ourselves no
[1:01:30] stand still and be patient right
[1:01:32] God will vindicate you let me tell you
[1:01:34] when God vindicates you that's better
[1:01:36] than you vindicating yourself a man so
[1:01:38] easy use Moses it used the Hebrew boys
[1:01:41] who used Daniel they use Paul and and I
[1:01:44] love the story of Paul because as the
[1:01:47] Lord was showing me that I came out my
[1:01:49] preach tip and I said you could be in
[1:01:52] the midst of euro-crime and still in the
[1:01:54] perfect will of God a man we come out
[1:01:57] and see that one Sunday in the next
[1:01:58] Sunday we didn't have your cloud on it
[1:02:00] they had a different name they've called
[1:02:01] bori and a man but we was in the midst
[1:02:04] of torreón and still in the perfect will
[1:02:06] of God hallelujah yeah you can go on to
[1:02:09] Indiana still in the perfect will of God
[1:02:11] even though door is bare
[1:02:13] on you you can still be in the perfect
[1:02:15] will of God facing a tempestuous storm
[1:02:17] the holy God you've got to know who you
[1:02:20] are in Christ and I'm gonna tell you
[1:02:23] every quite some patience a man for me

[1:05:29] the people in the Bahamas Amen I feel
[1:05:31] very very I feel bad I wish I wish some

[1:05:38] Amen here to South Florida with us if
[1:05:42] you need a church I know your church

[1:05:52] come right I wish we could have been
[1:05:54] there in Miami doing something like that
[1:05:55] I mean when they come in yesterday but
[1:05:57] but but wow you know Bahamas was
[1:05:59] certainly suffering I do say God was
[1:06:01] holding things up to allow our plane to
[1:06:04] get right in and when that plane got in
[1:06:06] we thought it was going to be a very
[1:06:08] terrible conditions but it was so calm
[1:06:10] in Miami and so calm in Fort Lauderdale
[1:06:12] our cars were parked in the Fort
[1:06:14] Lauderdale Airport and we like how we
[1:06:16] gonna get the cars out they have told us
[1:06:18] not to even show up at the airport
[1:06:20] because we're not going to let you on
[1:06:21] the property and as I'm driving by the
[1:06:24] airport I say I got to try I say you
[1:06:26] know my cars and then I
[1:06:27] don't want to have to come back down
[1:06:28] here Lord just give us favor we we drove
[1:06:31] right on up on the airport and we got
[1:06:33] there and right where the police was
[1:06:35] stopping everybody the man walked up to
[1:06:37] my casa are you here to get your car sir
[1:06:39] I say yes sir he say father this officer

[1:06:50] home with no problems and then the next
[1:06:52] day no storm I'm talking about God is
[1:06:54] good god is good just just stated our
[1:06:57] coast
[1:06:58] right so I just believe God did that
[1:07:01] because we did something for him I'm
[1:07:03] crazy enough to believe that I told
[1:07:04] people a man there in our indy and i say
[1:07:07] the reaiiy mean paul the people that was
[1:07:09] on the boat with paul
[1:07:11] they were spirit because Paul was on the
[1:07:13] boat huh they were spared because Paul
[1:07:19] was on the boat so I'm crazy enough to
[1:07:22] believe that South Florida could have
[1:07:25] been spared from Miami all the way up to
[1:07:29] West Palm Beach because we had to get
[1:07:31] home I'm crazy enough to believe that
[1:07:34] hallelujah now that don't that don't
[1:07:37] mean that every storm come pass us
[1:07:39] hallelujah God did God showed us favor
[1:07:42] for that moment but there's gonna be
[1:07:44] some storms coming because judgment is
[1:07:45] strike in the land huddled it's just
[1:07:48] sometimes I hate to say it's the only
[1:07:49] way God can get people's attention Amen
[1:07:52] when judgment when these acts of
[1:07:54] judgment come comes you can't even
[1:07:56] explain how a storm like this just just
[1:07:58] come out of nowhere they got another one
[1:08:00] out there right now hallelujah amen
[1:08:03] everywhere we turn it's just judgment
[1:08:05] judgment just somebody ought to get
[1:08:07] serious about God's alright Amen so you
[1:08:11] know I thank God for that but but you
[1:08:12] can be in the midst of your Clyde on and
[1:08:14] still be in the will of God brother
[1:08:16] Branham also talked about the believers
[1:08:18] on the day of Pentecost amen and how you
[1:08:22] know they were patient waiting on the
[1:08:23] Lord but today we want to pick up
[1:08:27] another aim an example of this patience
[1:08:29] patience with each other let me read a
[1:08:31] couple statements here Amen a quote or
[1:08:34] so from statue of a perfect man I'm
[1:08:36] starting at paragraph 275 glory to God
[1:08:40] stay with me it says we should have
[1:08:43] patience with one another to see it says
[1:08:47] one time we get so much impatient with
[1:08:51] one another I love the statement we get
[1:08:53] so much impatient with one another we
[1:08:56] think we got to be like Moses Moses had
[1:09:00] patience with the people look that's
[1:09:03] what caused him not to go over see if
[1:09:06] you're trying to do something like I've
[1:09:07] tried to get this message over at the
[1:09:10] Tabernacle to see that each member of
[1:09:12] the tabernacle become this and he's
[1:09:14] talking about the statue of a perfect
[1:09:16] man
[1:09:16] become this amen it's hard to do I've
[1:09:19] tried to have patience this is 33 years
[1:09:23] see have patience women still Bob their
[1:09:28] hair still just the same but just have
[1:09:31] patience just see just have patience
[1:09:34] wait have to if you ain't got it don't
[1:09:37] try to build on this down here
[1:09:38] have patience oh my I know what that's
[1:09:42] like you know a brother branham being a
[1:09:44] pastor and and shepherding the people
[1:09:47] and you come and you bring a certain
[1:09:48] truth to the people and but everybody
[1:09:50] keep going on doing the same thing
[1:09:51] everybody and you don't know how much it
[1:09:54] requires patience not to say nothing
[1:09:57] Amen not that you don't see it you see
[1:10:00] it all but it require patience oh my god
[1:10:04] a man a man it's something that I all
[1:10:08] shy wasn't thinking about sharing this
[1:10:10] but it just came to my spirit and it's
[1:10:12] something that I appreciate I won't i
[1:10:14] won't i won't i won't say who it is but
[1:10:17] I'll say this I was helped I was held at
[1:10:20] the younger stage of my ministry amen
[1:10:24] when I first started out I remember a
[1:10:26] man a sister just showed me a scripture
[1:10:28] you know all she did was do I love the
[1:10:30] way she did it she just showed me the
[1:10:32] scripture and the scripture said the
[1:10:33] wrath of man does not work the right to
[1:10:36] of God and when I read that script I see
[1:10:39] who that's a yes Lord ain't number and
[1:10:43] it just showed me see you got to have
[1:10:45] patience with God's people right don't
[1:10:47] come out attacking everybody just
[1:10:49] because it ain't done the way to to want
[1:10:50] it done just preach the word and God
[1:10:53] will take care of the rest of it right
[1:10:54] just have patience with God people Oh a
[1:10:57] man somebody I learned that lesson a
[1:11:00] long time ago because you know I mean
[1:11:02] you can come out

[1:15:09] lot say we'll talk about that later all
[1:15:11] right all right let me go on so you know
[1:15:15] let me let me read a quote here
[1:15:17] questions and answers part three gotta
[1:15:22] learn to be patient with one another hey
[1:15:25] man the Prophet says this this is a
[1:15:27] question that comes to him and says
[1:15:28] brother branham how am I supposed to
[1:15:30] show my wife that I really care for her
[1:15:33] and yet stay with the word so that's
[1:15:38] that stay with the word but still having
[1:15:39] a question like this said why don't you
[1:15:41] practice what you preach I believe so
[1:15:42] his wife is always telling why don't you
[1:15:44] just practice what you preach so the
[1:15:46] husband is like how do I show my wife
[1:15:48] that I really care for her and yet stay
[1:15:50] with work because you know as a husband
[1:15:51] I got the I got to put my foot down you
[1:15:54] know this is the Word of God
[1:15:55] you know that's where we are as husbands
[1:15:57] right you know but but here the question
[1:15:59] is acts how do i how do I do this
[1:16:02] because my wife is telling me why don't
[1:16:03] you practice what you preach Oh
[1:16:06] hallelujah when it when it gets silent
[1:16:09] like that brother Devon you know you in
[1:16:11] there you know you in there women I'm
[1:16:15] gonna get real quiet halle-loo you know
[1:16:18] God's speaking then let's just read the
[1:16:20] quote he says well then if the wife it's
[1:16:24] the way to send this to you when she has
[1:16:27] a right to see it
[1:16:29] can we read the quote the wife is
[1:16:32] sending because she got a right to say
[1:16:34] it
[1:16:35] all right saying you better get right so
[1:16:39] what the prophets say you better get it
[1:16:41] right cuz she got a right to say that to
[1:16:43] you ain't man hallelujah better get
[1:16:45] since you see things that other people
[1:16:46] don't see
[1:16:47] glory got so she has a right to say you
[1:16:50] better get right see then it
[1:16:52] is saying it just to be evil remember
[1:16:56] the Bible said it was better than a
[1:16:58] millstone was hanged at your neck and
[1:17:00] drowning the deficit of see then even to
[1:17:02] fin the least of these my little ones
[1:17:03] now just that's just your question I'm
[1:17:06] and maybe maybe that this wife is not
[1:17:09] that type of perfect person maybe she's
[1:17:11] different maybe she's a good person
[1:17:13] person maybe she's just testing you to
[1:17:16] see what you'll do
[1:17:18] I'm reading says now stay in love with
[1:17:21] her and let her see Jesus in you you do
[1:17:27] that you just go on set I give a little
[1:17:30] illustration this morning now the
[1:17:31] prophets say stay in love with her and
[1:17:33] let us see Jesus in you come on somebody
[1:17:38] say I give a little illustration this
[1:17:40] morning about a person one time this
[1:17:43] little woman had received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:44] now now now remember the question was
[1:17:47] about the husband now the rest of this
[1:17:49] quote is gonna apply to the wife but
[1:17:51] what this wife does is exactly what a
[1:17:54] husband should be doing hallelujah
[1:17:57] so you already know the story but I'm
[1:18:00] not gonna tell you the store we're gonna
[1:18:01] read you the story amen but I want you
[1:18:04] to catch that this was an example the
[1:18:06] Prophet was given for a husband we use
[1:18:09] this for the wives but this example is
[1:18:12] actually for the husband let's read it
[1:18:28] like this I was there I was at home and
[1:18:31] and just looking at this I say Lord that
[1:18:33] a preach oh now look at this look at
[1:18:37] this look at this he says says now now
[1:18:40] one time this just this little woman had
[1:18:43] received the Holy Ghost and she was a
[1:18:45] very sweet little person where she had a
[1:18:48] hard life and her husband wasn't
[1:18:50] alcoholic says and so she just kept on
[1:18:53] she blows him he says you want to go to
[1:18:55] church honey take off but but I just I
[1:18:57] just go down to the saloon
[1:19:00] the Brown Derby down here go on so they
[1:19:02] hung out down there all the time
[1:19:04] used to be Boniface many of your old
[1:19:06] Thomas here
[1:19:07] remember when bountiful hat there on the
[1:19:09] corner it's called Brown Derby I believe
[1:19:11] it is so hang it around down there and
[1:19:14] the first thing you know one night come
[1:19:16] up a question about church and about
[1:19:18] Christians one of the old drunks sitting
[1:19:22] there said there ain't no such a thing
[1:19:24] as Christians anymore hallelujah
[1:19:29] said there's no such thing all this
[1:19:31] bunch of hypocrites said you see them
[1:19:33] out here smoking and drinking doing the
[1:19:36] same thing that we do that's what the
[1:19:38] Simmons are saying so a Christian should
[1:19:40] be sub doing something different than
[1:19:42] what Amen the sinners are doing
[1:19:44] hallelujah amen it sense since I doing
[1:19:47] the same thing we do and said call
[1:19:49] themselves Christians there is no such
[1:19:51] this is what drunk people were talking
[1:19:53] about says this one drunk raised up and
[1:19:56] said just a minute he said there's one
[1:19:58] that I know about said lizard said it's
[1:20:02] my wife said she becomes salty he was
[1:20:06] catching it all the time he said I bet
[1:20:09] if she was put to a squeeze oh Lord
[1:20:12] I wanted to just ask if we just put you
[1:20:15] to a squeeze how would you react with
[1:20:18] the patience of God come come come come
[1:20:20] flowing out of you
[1:20:21] I would you be over impatient if you're
[1:20:24] put to the squeeze come on somebody look
[1:20:28] at this he said he said no she's still a
[1:20:30] Christian what her husband that didn't
[1:20:34] even want to go to church recognized
[1:20:36] that his wife was a Christian i'ma just
[1:20:39] leave it there I believe it he already
[1:20:41] know the rest of the story
[1:20:42] i'ma just i'ma tell the rest of the
[1:20:43] audience you can pull it down so her
[1:20:45] husband recognized that this is a
[1:20:47] Christian and our husband is telling all
[1:20:50] the drunks they made it inside the bar
[1:20:52] man I know my wife a Christian I mean I
[1:20:54] don't know about nobody else but I know
[1:20:55] my wife say I'll tell you what

[1:20:58] it to the test say okay let's do it cuz
[1:21:01] I know she got still keep her
[1:21:02] Christianity so they come up with a
[1:21:04] scheme they gonna go back to the house

[1:21:10] gonna they're gonna put her through a
[1:21:11] test and see how she responds amen

[1:21:18] take you know they've gotten to the
[1:21:19] house the man knew that they had some
[1:21:21] ham and eggs in the refrigerator so he

[1:32:47] war strategy because sometimes be some
[1:32:49] serious Wars that be happening in the
[1:32:51] houses big time war war zone you walk
[1:32:56] into that house it's a war zone husband
[1:33:01] on this side wife on that side praise
[1:33:03] the Lord and the only way we're gonna
[1:33:05] overcome these things by applying war
[1:33:07] strategies one of your war strategies is
[1:33:10] patience patience with one another
[1:33:14] amen patience with one another now if
[1:33:17] you can't show that at home how you
[1:33:19] gonna show outside the house a man
[1:33:22] Church we got to be able to show it at
[1:33:24] home patients with one another now now
[1:33:28] now brother branham used example of the
[1:33:31] brother you know doing that with his
[1:33:32] wife or also in a previous example of
[1:33:35] the of the wife doing a particular thing
[1:33:37] with our husband we can all take this
[1:33:39] husband or wife we can all take this
[1:33:41] they maintain use it to overcome the
[1:33:44] enemy in our situations patients with
[1:33:47] one another another thing that the
[1:33:51] Prophet said and this is another thing
[1:33:53] that we should always always remember
[1:33:55] and I won't I don't have time to read
[1:33:57] all of this amen but he says every seven
[1:34:01] years people go through changes so every
[1:34:04] seven years people go through changes
[1:34:06] husband a man or woman every seven years
[1:34:08] you go through some type of change and
[1:34:10] so so oftentimes when you're looking at
[1:34:13] people maybe some things that they might
[1:34:14] be going through try to try to see if
[1:34:17] they might be in that cycle of seven try
[1:34:20] to see that right so you know a you know
[1:34:24] 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 right 56 praise the
[1:34:34] Lord
[1:34:35] 63 70
[1:34:39] they go through changes praise God I'm
[1:34:43] preaching they go through change so I I
[1:34:46] might have called one of y'all birth I
[1:34:48] mean you're aged out and one of those
[1:34:50] numbers but as a as a as a family member
[1:34:53] if you know your family members around
[1:34:55] that age watch the change that they
[1:34:57] might be going through and brother
[1:34:58] branham say when that happens that's
[1:35:00] when you really got to be patient with
[1:35:01] the person understand that that change
[1:35:04] is going to occur in their life when
[1:35:06] they hit a particular age there's a
[1:35:08] shift that happens in that just
[1:35:09] naturally it's a natural shift
[1:35:12] oh my I'm in age to be things that I
[1:35:15] used to be able to do I get on the road
[1:35:16] and glory to God we would drive from
[1:35:18] here to there and drive back and not
[1:35:20] feel nothing
[1:35:22] hallelujah but I hid a change I hid a
[1:35:27] change and when I hit the change I can't
[1:35:30] do that you spent time I could drive I
[1:35:32] remember we used to drive out to
[1:35:33] Oklahoma I mean 30 hour trip I would
[1:35:35] take 25 hours of the 30 hours driving
[1:35:38] straight through no problem now I'm
[1:35:40] looking for a airplane hallelujah even I
[1:35:44] don't even want to go three hours up the
[1:35:46] road I'm just I hit eight change there
[1:35:50] was a shift that took place you get
[1:35:52] tired just just thinking about it
[1:35:56] right but this is what happens when you
[1:35:59] when you hit the ship you got to
[1:36:00] understand it so when you catch people
[1:36:02] kind of add a shift then a that's it
[1:36:04] that's a that's the time to show extra
[1:36:06] patience Oh hallelujah
[1:36:10] more patience during that time more
[1:36:13] patience oh my man let me just read a
[1:36:17] part of this quote this is out of the
[1:36:19] indictment just a part of this quote he
[1:36:22] says says eateth because it was talked
[1:36:25] about Edith right she had gone through
[1:36:26] this change and she was going through
[1:36:27] menopause and and she was just thinking
[1:36:30] so hard of herself during this time but
[1:36:32] brother Branham said just now Edith with
[1:36:34] this just changing of the seven years
[1:36:36] every seven years your life changes so
[1:36:39] the seven the seven times seven you see
[1:36:42] and it makes it kind of hard and that's
[1:36:44] a complete change
[1:36:46] seven times seven he say is a complete
[1:36:49] change
[1:36:50] so I just hit that y'all gonna have to
[1:36:53] be patient with me glory to God it says
[1:36:59] the complete change and it bothers the
[1:37:01] women men usually get kind of a funny
[1:37:04] carrying on during that time and
[1:37:06] sometimes leave their wives but women
[1:37:10] are unfertile unfertile after that and
[1:37:12] we'll go through that and we must
[1:37:14] remember that it's things that we must
[1:37:17] bear with one another and understand
[1:37:21] those things we must bear with one
[1:37:24] another and understand those things so
[1:37:29] when somebody kind of hits that spot
[1:37:30] then you know just just be patient with
[1:37:32] them just be patient with a glory to God
[1:37:35] let me just give you just a couple of
[1:37:37] more cooks I'm gonna leave that one
[1:37:39] right there and I want to just jump into
[1:37:41] this a little bit oh lord thank you God
[1:37:44] a couple more quotes here this one's
[1:37:47] coming out of how the angel a man came
[1:37:50] to me how the angel came to me how the
[1:37:53] angel came to me it says I got a brother
[1:37:57] that's tall in thin blond headed pug
[1:38:02] nose and fair-skinned he don't look like
[1:38:05] me we don't act alike you never know he
[1:38:09] we was brothers but his daddy is my
[1:38:12] daddy
[1:38:12] and if the family accepted him looking
[1:38:16] the way he did except to me looking the
[1:38:20] way I did then we accept one another to
[1:38:23] be brothers so that's right so that's
[1:38:26] the way we have to do in this Christian
[1:38:28] realm we have to believe have faith in
[1:38:31] one another when the Christians lose
[1:38:35] faith in one another the devil's got the
[1:38:38] church right then when the Christians
[1:38:42] lose faith with one another then the
[1:38:46] Devils got the church right there that's
[1:38:48] why you got to fight with everything you
[1:38:49] got soon as you see the devil rises hey
[1:38:52] to try to bring the vision
[1:38:54] in the church you gotta that
[1:38:56] hallelujah gotta be patient with one
[1:38:59] another
[1:38:59] you never said no my brother didn't mean
[1:39:01] to do that no my sister didn't mean to
[1:39:03] do that
[1:39:03] no that's not that character you gotta
[1:39:05] fight that devil
[1:39:07] hallelujah somebody Gloria when
[1:39:10] Christians lose faith in one another the
[1:39:13] devil's got the church right there
[1:39:14] that's right we got to have faith and
[1:39:16] confidence in one another bear with one
[1:39:20] another got to have patience for each
[1:39:23] other you got to have patience for each
[1:39:25] other glory to God let me give you one
[1:39:27] more the church in this condition
[1:39:31] hallelujah glory to God all right it
[1:39:36] says this how many here that's
[1:39:38] backslidden solo you say I wouldn't
[1:39:41] admit that brother branham but look if
[1:39:44] the Dove of meekness is going from you
[1:39:48] brother there's something wrong can I
[1:39:52] can I say that if the Dove of meekness
[1:39:55] it's gone from you brother there's
[1:39:59] something wrong that's why we ought to
[1:40:00] be in pray all the time Lord let's you
[1:40:03] let let I want I want your character be
[1:40:06] manifested in and through me if the Dove
[1:40:08] of meekness is gone from me there's
[1:40:10] something wrong but there's something
[1:40:11] wrong when you came bare with one
[1:40:13] another when you can't forgive every
[1:40:16] person from the very depths of your
[1:40:17] heart no matter what they've done or
[1:40:21] what they say it if you came forgive
[1:40:24] them from the depths Jesus said if you
[1:40:26] don't forgive every man it's trespass
[1:40:27] from your heart neither does your
[1:40:29] heavenly Father forgive you
[1:40:31] Church this is so important that we
[1:40:33] learn amen to have patients one with the
[1:40:36] other and I'm gonna tell you the
[1:40:38] greatest trials that you can ever have
[1:40:39] are the trials that happen right within
[1:40:41] a man so church fight that with
[1:40:43] everything got half patience one with
[1:40:46] another now I go back here to statue of
[1:40:48] a perfect man because the Prophet makes
[1:40:50] these comments and let me I'll read a
[1:40:53] couple of them here and then I'll switch
[1:40:55] gears glory to God I love this a man so
[1:40:59] he says
[1:41:02] here in a paragraph 277 he says even one
[1:41:07] time when that rebellion bunch of people
[1:41:09] had such impatience they caused Moses to
[1:41:13] do something wrong but yet when it come
[1:41:16] to a showdown God got sick of their
[1:41:18] action he said separate yourself Moses
[1:41:20] I'll kill the whole bunch of them and
[1:41:22] start anew he throwed himself in the
[1:41:24] breech and said God don't do it what
[1:41:27] patience with the people that was
[1:41:29] rebelling against him catch that
[1:41:31] statement catch that statement brother
[1:41:34] branham said Moses have patience with
[1:41:37] the people that were rebelling against
[1:41:39] him think about it
[1:41:43] right amen sometimes in a church you can
[1:41:46] get rebellion going on but you got to
[1:41:48] have patience with the people that's
[1:41:49] rebelling against you in a household in
[1:41:52] a family kids can grow up and start
[1:41:55] rebelling but you got to have patience
[1:41:57] with the people that's rebelling against
[1:42:00] you you go back and look at Moses
[1:42:04] situation there and numbers 14 and God
[1:42:06] was sort of so thinner I mean I think
[1:42:08] about ten different times where the
[1:42:10] people had done something wrong God got
[1:42:12] fed up they tempted God in the
[1:42:14] wilderness God say you know what I will
[1:42:16] not let this this group of people go
[1:42:18] over to the promised land say Moses back
[1:42:20] up I'm gonna kill everybody Moses said
[1:42:23] Lord if you do that then the other
[1:42:25] nation is gonna say you brought him out
[1:42:27] but she was not able to bring them in
[1:42:28] and and God you you did this but you
[1:42:30] couldn't do that the people don't talk
[1:42:32] about your Lord all the other nations
[1:42:33] don't say these things say Lord please
[1:42:35] don't do this
[1:42:36] God says say Moses I hear your prayer
[1:42:39] Moses stood in the gap for those people
[1:42:43] that were rebelling against him Moses
[1:42:45] Moses stood there the same way Christ
[1:42:46] stood in between heaven and earth for
[1:42:49] our sins hallelujah amen Moses stood in
[1:42:53] the gap just the way Christ in the gap
[1:42:55] and we will be required at times to
[1:42:58] stand in the gap for somebody that's
[1:43:00] rebelling
[1:43:01] thus it's easy to stand and gap for
[1:43:07] people that that best best doing
[1:43:08] everything right but when they're doing
[1:43:10] everything wrong you got to stand in the
[1:43:13] gap for them God heard Moses prayer God
[1:43:17] said okay mother so I tell you what
[1:43:19] now i'ma tell you this 20 years and
[1:43:22] older they'll go in but this was that's
[1:43:24] 20 years I mean they'll die right here
[1:43:26] in the wilderness now they won't go to
[1:43:28] the problems and they'll die right here
[1:43:29] but I'm gonna I'm not gonna kill them
[1:43:31] right now in an instance I'm gonna hear
[1:43:33] your prayer Moses stood in the gap for
[1:43:35] church we got to do the same thing here
[1:43:38] he was having patience with people that
[1:43:41] rebelled against him the Prophet says I
[1:43:43] wonder if we could do that if you can't
[1:43:46] don't try to build on this because it
[1:43:48] don't it don't change it now that's the
[1:43:51] way the first one was vulcanizing to
[1:43:52] this and that's the way every one of
[1:43:54] them has to be vulcanize if you don't
[1:43:56] don't come to that statue of the
[1:43:58] dwelling place of the Living God if you
[1:43:59] haven't got patience patience one
[1:44:02] another all right now I use a man the
[1:44:09] story of Abraham here a man that talked
[1:44:13] about these these kings going to war
[1:44:15] glory to God and and and I use Abraham
[1:44:19] as our example of an Old Testament
[1:44:20] character that had patience with
[1:44:23] somebody else we have to have patience
[1:44:25] one with the other a man and as I just
[1:44:28] kind of thought about Abraham the
[1:44:31] previous chapter kind of talked about
[1:44:33] Abraham the scripture says that he was a
[1:44:35] very wealthy man and when I read that I
[1:44:37] highlighted it you know cuz if I'm
[1:44:39] Abraham seed I'm supposed to be the same
[1:44:41] way praise the Lord
[1:44:43] a man so so you know I looked at that
[1:44:45] and and what it happened was that
[1:44:47] Abraham when God called Abraham he
[1:44:50] didn't call a lot he called Abraham
[1:44:52] alone glory to God but when Abraham
[1:44:55] brought lot with him it created many
[1:44:58] problems in the camp and the land as the
[1:45:01] land was not able to bear both Abraham's
[1:45:03] group and life's group so so Abraham
[1:45:06] finally came a lot and he gave him a
[1:45:07] choice to say look
[1:45:09] the ladders not able to bear we
[1:45:10] constantly strive having strife because
[1:45:13] they fighting with one another your
[1:45:15] herdsmen with my herdsmen sex
[1:45:16] consciousness something coming up say
[1:45:18] the land is not able to bear so say I'll
[1:45:20] tell you what look just just just just
[1:45:23] raise your head and look and you choose
[1:45:25] which direction you want to go if you
[1:45:27] want to stay here I'll let you stay here
[1:45:28] if you want me to go out though but if
[1:45:31] you want to go you can go and I'll stay
[1:45:33] here but we got to separate in order to
[1:45:35] stop all this this dis dis bickering and
[1:45:37] everything that's going on we got to
[1:45:38] stop amen all the confusion all the
[1:45:40] fight and we got I mean somebody got to
[1:45:42] come to a point somebody gotta be the
[1:45:44] bigger person in the situation say look
[1:45:46] we gotta stop all this let's come to
[1:45:48] some type of agreement abraham was able
[1:45:52] to do that abraham was able to do that
[1:45:55] so so here you know not now now you
[1:45:58] would think that if abraham is is i mean
[1:46:01] get to the point where look man I'm so
[1:46:03] tired a lot I'm so tired of all this
[1:46:06] bicker and I'm so tired of all this
[1:46:07] fighting that you know I just won't like
[1:46:09] to leave I just want him just to get out
[1:46:12] just just leaving and after lot left
[1:46:15] it's with God éxito said and I look
[1:46:16] around me bruh ham now every everything
[1:46:18] and all the letters you see I bless you
[1:46:20] with that that's where he received his
[1:46:22] inheritance is when lot left that's
[1:46:26] according to the scripture that's when
[1:46:28] he received everything God promised him
[1:46:30] it's actually with lot left there's some
[1:46:32] people gauger have to get out of your
[1:46:35] life for a season hallelujah
[1:46:38] some people are hinder you from getting
[1:46:40] what you're supposed to have in God
[1:46:42] because you include him and God never
[1:46:44] included them they not part of the
[1:46:46] blessing hallelujah somebody but but you
[1:46:51] keep trying to make them part of the
[1:46:52] blessing amen but all the strife was
[1:46:55] coming up so God could get get a lot in
[1:46:57] one place and now you can deal
[1:46:58] specifically with Abraham but now you
[1:47:01] think that Abraham it's free and it's in
[1:47:04] his heart free in the spirit that men I
[1:47:06] finally got rid of life I finally got
[1:47:07] rid of life Oh hallelujah
[1:47:09] I thank God that Abraham didn't have
[1:47:11] that type of spirit in him glory to God
[1:47:14] Oh hallelujah we should never have that
[1:47:18] type of Sparrow
[1:47:18] oh they're gone good
[1:47:20] what you got the wrong spirit when
[1:47:23] you're doing something like that they
[1:47:25] going good know if your heart not crying
[1:47:28] out and praying for somebody that's not
[1:47:30] here something's wrong with you
[1:47:32] hallelujah but my ear here Abraham you
[1:47:35] know he's here doing whatever he's doing
[1:47:38] and life is over there and Abraham gets
[1:47:41] words that there was a war that occurred
[1:47:44] a battle that happened these kings come
[1:47:47] down and and took all the people out of
[1:47:49] sodom and gomorrah and he knew life was
[1:47:51] living down there in Sodom
[1:47:53] hallelujah and hear hear when he hears
[1:47:57] about you know lot was taken captive
[1:48:00] Abraham not being a warrior Abraham not
[1:48:05] really having any warriors in his camp
[1:48:07] he just got trained service 300 trained
[1:48:10] service but he's about to go after five
[1:48:13] kings because his brother is captured I
[1:48:17] won't try to get that hallelujah glory
[1:48:20] to God
[1:48:20] the read that the thing that brought
[1:48:22] that the thing that caused Abraham they
[1:48:24] wanna do something about this it's
[1:48:26] because his brother not the one that was
[1:48:29] causing a headache Oh y'all didn't get
[1:48:31] it now not the one that was causing them
[1:48:34] problems
[1:48:34] amen to Abraham he's not a problem maker
[1:48:38] he's my brother
[1:48:40] Oh Church I hope that said sin he's he's
[1:48:45] not a one that's causing me problems
[1:48:47] he's my brother she not causing me
[1:48:50] issues she's my sister and if she gets
[1:48:55] in trouble imma be right there to get
[1:48:57] her out hallelujah
[1:49:02] the same one that was cause of Abraham
[1:49:04] all the trouble was the first one he
[1:49:06] went after when he found out that he was
[1:49:09] in trouble he went sit around saying
[1:49:12] that's good for God don't teach him a
[1:49:15] lesson it's my time this happened to him
[1:49:18] no that's not the attitude of Abraham
[1:49:21] give the train service together and
[1:49:23] let's go after five kings
[1:49:26] I want you to see this in scripture
[1:49:31] Abraham goes there in Genesis 14
[1:49:34] and-and-and this let's look at this cuz
[1:49:36] you know great things happen
[1:49:38] well I mean when your spirit is right
[1:49:40] and you're doing things the way God
[1:49:44] wants you to do it you might meet
[1:49:46] somebody that you wasn't expecting to
[1:49:47] meet you might come in contact with
[1:49:52] somebody you never expected to have
[1:49:54] contact with huh
[1:49:56] but but when your spirit is right these
[1:49:59] the supernatural can take place look at
[1:50:02] this now because let's pick it up amen
[1:50:05] in Genesis 14 verse 13 and there came
[1:50:08] one that escaped and told Abram the
[1:50:12] Hebrew friend welt
[1:50:13] in the plain of Mamre the Amorite
[1:50:16] brother of s : brother Anna and these
[1:50:20] were confited with Abram and when Abram
[1:50:23] heard that his brother was taken captive
[1:50:26] notice he uses a term brother
[1:50:28] not-not-not not the one that's caused me
[1:50:30] all these issues but my brother right
[1:50:33] amen his brother was taken captive he
[1:50:36] armed his trained servants born in his
[1:50:39] own house 318 and pursued them unto
[1:50:42] damned and he divided himself against
[1:50:45] him and he and his service by night and
[1:50:47] smoked them and pursued them unto Hoba
[1:50:50] which is on the left hand of damascus
[1:50:54] and he brought back all the goods and
[1:50:57] also brought again his brother lot and
[1:50:59] his goods and the women also and the
[1:51:02] people that goes on and the king of
[1:51:05] sodom went out to meet him after his
[1:51:09] return from the slaughter of
[1:51:10] chedorlaomer and other kings that were
[1:51:14] with him at the valley of shaveh which
[1:51:18] is the king's Dale and Melchizedek this
[1:51:22] this is this is this unexpected king he
[1:51:25] was he wasn't mentioned before but
[1:51:27] because Abraham's spirit was right
[1:51:29] because Abraham
[1:51:31] did what was right he met Melchizedek
[1:51:34] look at this and Melchizedek king of
[1:51:37] Salem was brought a king of Salem
[1:51:41] brought forth bread and wine this is
[1:51:42] communion Oh hallelujah
[1:51:45] you want to know why some people can't
[1:51:47] take communion it's because they got
[1:51:49] problems Amen that they haven't been at
[1:51:51] work out at home glory to God but if you
[1:51:54] can actually get some of that and have
[1:51:56] peace with one another have patience
[1:51:59] with one if you can learn how to work
[1:52:00] those things that then you'll be free to
[1:52:03] take communion hallelujah with when
[1:52:06] Abraham had patience with lots he met
[1:52:09] Melchizedek and was served communion oh
[1:52:14] Jesus look at this he says him now can
[1:52:17] that king of Salem brought forth bread
[1:52:19] and wine and he was a priest of the Most
[1:52:21] High God the other thing I want to know
[1:52:22] about this is that after the battle is
[1:52:25] over you will receive Communion you know
[1:52:28] when we get to the other side the first
[1:52:30] thing that happens when we go to heaven
[1:52:31] is communion communion happens the first
[1:52:35] thing you do in heaven is have communion
[1:52:38] the last thing Jesus did on the earth
[1:52:40] was do what have communion when the
[1:52:43] battle is over you will be sir communion
[1:52:45] when this battle in life is over you'll
[1:52:47] be served communion so if you don't have
[1:52:50] it then why not start having it right
[1:52:52] now if you got to get something fixed
[1:52:55] get it fixed so you can start partaking
[1:52:58] and communion look at this he says the
[1:53:04] priests of the Most High God and He
[1:53:06] blessed him and said blessed be Abraham
[1:53:08] I blessed be Abram of the Most High God
[1:53:11] possessor of heaven and earth now this
[1:53:14] Melchizedek brother branham tells us he
[1:53:17] I mean to actually Paul said he was a
[1:53:18] man without father and without mother a
[1:53:21] man with our Father and without mother
[1:53:24] and it's the brother end up saying now
[1:53:25] this was not Jesus no cancer that was
[1:53:28] not Jesus because Jesus a man had a
[1:53:30] father God was his father right and
[1:53:33] and by earthly standards Mary - because
[1:53:36] consider his surrogate mother right he
[1:53:38] say Jesus also died he rose again but
[1:53:42] this man was without father and was
[1:53:44] without mother no beginning of days and
[1:53:46] no ending of days he say this was God
[1:53:49] himself
[1:53:51] hallelujah Abraham because he had the
[1:53:54] right spirit because he had patience
[1:53:58] with one another patience with his
[1:54:00] brother lot he meant God himself if you
[1:54:05] ever want to see God come down in your
[1:54:07] situation if you ever want to see God
[1:54:10] come in your circumstance
[1:54:12] let's have patience one with another
[1:54:15] your household will change the church
[1:54:18] will change everything will change when
[1:54:21] we can learn to have patience one with
[1:54:23] the other not talking that's fast and
[1:54:26] snippy and quick that's now that's not
[1:54:29] Christianity that's how the world do
[1:54:32] things but we got to learn to have
[1:54:34] patience one with the other Abraham had
[1:54:36] began TASIS with lot his brother by
[1:54:40] having patience he met Melchizedek let's
[1:54:43] go let's go on and read a little bit
[1:54:44] further in this look at this verse 19
[1:54:47] and he blessed him and blessed be
[1:54:50] Abraham the Most High God possessor of
[1:54:53] heaven earth and blessed be the Most
[1:54:55] High God which hath delivered thine
[1:54:56] enemies into our hand and when Abraham
[1:55:00] and when Abram met Melchizedek this King
[1:55:02] he gave he gave him tithes of all so he
[1:55:05] gave him a tenth of the spoil everything
[1:55:07] that he got back in this battle Abraham
[1:55:10] said I'm giving I'm giving a tenth of
[1:55:12] this to Melchizedek he says in the King
[1:55:14] so so tithing has been since Genesis and
[1:55:17] it's still here today God requires us to
[1:55:19] do that tithe and offering he says and
[1:55:21] the king of Sodom said unto Abram give
[1:55:24] me the persons and take the goods to
[1:55:27] thyself now he's trying to he's trying
[1:55:29] to give Abraham this you know all the
[1:55:31] stuff that you captured you can have all
[1:55:33] that yourself just give me the people
[1:55:35] now Abraham responds to Abraham said to
[1:55:37] the king of Sodom I have lift up my hand
[1:55:39] unto the Lord the Most High God
[1:55:41] possessor of heaven and earth
[1:55:44] that I will not take from a threat even
[1:55:46] to a shoe latchet and that I will not
[1:55:48] take anything that is dime lest thou
[1:55:50] should have say I have made Abram rich
[1:55:54] what brother branham safe see all wars
[1:55:56] are fought with the principle all
[1:55:59] battles are fought with the principle
[1:56:01] and in Abraham's case his principle was
[1:56:03] I'm not going to battle to get money I'm
[1:56:07] going to battle to get my brother and by
[1:56:13] having the right attitude by having a
[1:56:16] right approach then he could meet
[1:56:18] Melchizedek and Melchizedek blessed say
[1:56:21] you are possessor of heaven and earth go
[1:56:24] over to God right I mean you pretty much
[1:56:27] you are you you rule in both realms
[1:56:29] Abraham you root you rule in the heavens
[1:56:32] and you're ruling on earth
[1:56:33] Abraham possessor of heaven and earth
[1:56:36] hallelujah you don't need nothing to
[1:56:38] devil got to offer you when you know you
[1:56:40] the possessor of heaven and earth you
[1:56:45] don't have to take no shortcuts with the
[1:56:46] enemy he said no I don't need nothing
[1:56:49] only only only only only what does the
[1:56:53] verse verse 24 says save only that which
[1:56:56] the young men have eaten and the portion
[1:56:58] of the man which which which went with
[1:57:00] me inner ESCO and mamrie let them take
[1:57:03] their portion but the rest of it you can
[1:57:04] have I don't want this because I want
[1:57:06] you to I don't want you to think that
[1:57:07] you blessed me oh my god sometimes we
[1:57:11] forget who doing the blessing no its
[1:57:16] glory to God you know we think that you
[1:57:19] know I could I can give this a good cuz
[1:57:21] you know cuz your cuz cuz I cannot no
[1:57:23] lost not you God actually bless you so
[1:57:25] you could do what you did you understand
[1:57:28] is God all alone so long learn to give
[1:57:30] him the glory and give give them the
[1:57:31] honor don't exhaust yourself
[1:57:33] let God exhaust you come on church
[1:57:37] hallelujah Abraham met Melchizedek
[1:57:42] he'd met male kids that when he was able
[1:57:44] to have patience for his brother glory
[1:57:46] to God look at this I want to read a
[1:57:48] couple quotes here this is out of the
[1:57:51] message Hebrews chapter 7 my patience
[1:57:58] with one another he this was a war
[1:58:00] strategy Abraham had patience with lot
[1:58:03] and he went out after him now I want to
[1:58:05] tell you something even after he rescued
[1:58:06] like you want to know what Locke did lot
[1:58:10] went right back to Sodom right back to
[1:58:13] side now you already got him out one
[1:58:15] time but you know what
[1:58:17] when Abraham when it was revealed to
[1:58:19] Abraham by God Himself that I'm going
[1:58:21] down to destroy so out of myself Abraham
[1:58:24] began to pray and intercede for lot
[1:58:26] abraham threw himself in the gap for
[1:58:29] lots he never asked for a lot
[1:58:32] specifically he just asked for ten souls
[1:58:35] hope and lot would be counted in those
[1:58:37] ten Souls lot and his family oh my
[1:58:41] that's patience even somebody rebelling
[1:58:46] against you you can still have patience
[1:58:51] Church this heart but this is what God
[1:58:54] is calling us to now this is not
[1:58:56] something for us just to talk about this
[1:58:58] something for us to demonstrate let me
[1:59:02] let me read this quote Hebrews chapter 7
[1:59:04] part 1 the Prophet says this now if you
[1:59:06] notice Abraham said I'll not take a take
[1:59:09] take from a threat - shoe latch he
[1:59:11] didn't fight the war to make a lot of
[1:59:13] money and real true battles it says real
[1:59:18] true
[1:59:20] real true battles are not made with
[1:59:22] selfish motives wars are not fought for
[1:59:26] money this paragraph 75 I believe just
[1:59:32] go right right on down to paragraph 75
[1:59:33] I'm sorry he says real true battles are
[1:59:37] not not made with selfish motives he
[1:59:41] says wars are not fought for money wars
[1:59:45] are fought for motives for principles
[1:59:48] men fight war for principles and when
[1:59:51] Abraham went out to get lot he didn't
[1:59:54] go out because he knowed he could whip
[1:59:56] the Kings and take all their possessions
[1:59:57] he went out for the principle of saving
[2:00:00] his brother I want to tell you when you
[2:00:03] haven't patience one with another the
[2:00:04] principle is that you go save your
[2:00:06] brother you're gonna save your sister
[2:00:08] and any Minister that's thin out under
[2:00:11] the inspiration of the king of heaven
[2:00:14] will not go for money neither will he go
[2:00:17] to make big churches neither will they
[2:00:19] go to inspire denominations I like that
[2:00:21] statement so you can be called to the
[2:00:23] Ministry but if you're using your
[2:00:25] ministry to actually try to get bigger
[2:00:27] than denomination you got a question
[2:00:29] your call can I say that again you can
[2:00:34] be called to the ministry but if you are
[2:00:36] using your ministry to try to inspire a
[2:00:38] denomination something is wrong with
[2:00:40] your call you know the only reason I'm
[2:00:42] gonna go into the denomination of church
[2:00:44] to preach I'm going for my brother I
[2:00:50] know everybody that church they gonna
[2:00:52] come out but I'm going for one where
[2:00:54] it's locked in the midst of this group
[2:00:57] right I want to bring him out hallelujah
[2:01:00] amen there's somebody down there that
[2:01:02] might not have heard truth so I'm
[2:01:03] looking for that but destinated see I'm
[2:01:06] not here for everybody else so I don't
[2:01:08] get tangled up in that but but some
[2:01:10] again get so wrapped up they trying to
[2:01:12] inspire in the denomination hallelujah
[2:01:16] trust me my friend you can't compete you
[2:01:20] can't compete with the denomination of
[2:01:22] preachers the one thing I'll tell you
[2:01:24] about a message Church they're gonna
[2:01:26] come with a different angle so they're
[2:01:28] gonna bring angles that they ain't seen
[2:01:30] before
[2:01:30] but when it comes to entertaining you
[2:01:33] can't touch it this is a gospel that
[2:01:36] does not entertain hallelujah
[2:01:40] that we don't practice grabbing our ears
[2:01:42] and trying to hum and I know we just
[2:01:44] want to get the truth to people the
[2:01:46] Bible say you make they'll know the
[2:01:47] truth and the truth are make them free
[2:01:49] so I'm ever going to denominational
[2:01:51] church to preach which I have been
[2:01:53] invited to many and any time I go to
[2:01:55] preach I'm there for one purpose to
[2:01:57] bring my fallen brother hallelujah let's
[2:02:03] go on a little further
[2:02:05] he says any Minister sent sent out under
[2:02:09] the inspiration of the king of heaven
[2:02:10] will not go for money neither will he go
[2:02:12] to make up make big churches neither
[2:02:14] will he go to inspire denominations
[2:02:15] he'll only go for one principle and that
[2:02:18] is to bring back his fallen brother
[2:02:20] whether he gets a dime in the offering
[2:02:22] or whether he doesn't it won't make a
[2:02:23] bit of difference to him and I say real
[2:02:26] Wars our fault and ways for principles
[2:02:28] and not money let me you know let me
[2:02:30] just tell you another thing because
[2:02:31] sometimes you know you go to churches
[2:02:33] you get invited you go preach and I
[2:02:36] remember this happening us we went to
[2:02:37] church and preach and and man we you
[2:02:40] know we had a good time and I saw the
[2:02:42] the minister do something he told the
[2:02:45] church after after I preached to say
[2:02:47] let's raise our offering for this
[2:02:49] minister did me do a wonderful job
[2:02:50] tonight let's raise our offering for and
[2:02:52] he raised the raiser offering out and I
[2:02:54] saw the church just putting in name
[2:02:56] money you know Saints for my church just
[2:02:58] I'm just looking at them putting the
[2:02:59] name money I think they put more in that
[2:03:00] offering to me praise the Lord I'm just
[2:03:02] messing with you I'm just messing with
[2:03:05] you but-but-but-but I saw him do it and
[2:03:08] after I saw him do it
[2:03:09] I went to the back room man this
[2:03:11] preacher just told everybody out there
[2:03:13] that we've taken an offering for the man
[2:03:14] that just preached and when I get to the
[2:03:16] backroom he say what I owe you you want
[2:03:22] to know what I said nothing you don't
[2:03:25] owe me nothing you sure no you don't owe
[2:03:28] me nothing you could use you could have
[2:03:31] that you can use it for your church
[2:03:32] there's no problem you can use it you
[2:03:35] don't owe me nothing so guess what
[2:03:37] happened when he invited me back the
[2:03:38] next time I did not go hey man I'm not
[2:03:45] gonna let the people be taking advantage
[2:03:47] of glory to God right Amen so you got to
[2:03:51] be able to count on you know navigate
[2:03:53] some of this but I won't let my church
[2:03:54] be taking advantage of like that glory
[2:03:57] to God what I owe you what you told in
[2:03:59] them let me keep on reading as I say
[2:04:06] real wars are fought in ways for
[2:04:07] principles and not for money and men and
[2:04:10] women who join church and coming to
[2:04:11] church to be popular because joke
[2:04:13] because the Joneses belong there or they
[2:04:15] change their church from a little church
[2:04:17] to a big church
[2:04:18] doing it for selfish motive and the
[2:04:20] right principle is not behind it you
[2:04:21] should be willing to stand at the battle
[2:04:24] front I'm going on I got some more to
[2:04:27] read in this Tabernacle here when things
[2:04:32] go wrong and you mean and you women will
[2:04:35] run and go over somewhere else or lay
[2:04:38] out what that mean what that lay out me
[2:04:40] and stay home don't come the church have
[2:04:43] to have people call and see where you
[2:04:44] act you laying out before you know
[2:04:49] you're on the beach on Sunday right
[2:04:52] you just laying out glory to God you say
[2:04:54] laying out laying out till the little
[2:04:56] fuss or the students over I've seen
[2:04:59] people do that and when they start
[2:05:00] laying out they actually don't make it
[2:05:02] back that's why you just stay hang in
[2:05:05] there stay with it be patient one with
[2:05:06] the other it says lay out to the little
[2:05:08] fusses of fusses twos over there's
[2:05:10] something wrong with your experience

[2:05:16] order here
[2:05:18] the church has an order y'all understand
[2:05:20] it right there's an order here the
[2:05:22] church is based upon the principles of
[2:05:24] Bible oh I love this a man a man a man a
[2:05:29] man I'm just I'm although there's that
[2:05:32] the church has an order these brothers

[2:06:59] everybody got to stand in a lane there's
[2:07:02] an order to this there's order to it the
[2:07:06] Church of run smooth is everybody doing
[2:07:07] what they supposed to do is that all
[2:07:10] right now all right all right all right
[2:07:13] I'm taught I haven't patients one with
[2:07:14] another amen glory to God hey man all
[2:07:25] right I'm still reading we have a custom
[2:07:28] here we have an order here this church
[2:07:31] is based upon the principles of the
[2:07:33] Bible if there's somebody here not doing
[2:07:35] right and you think they're not you go
[2:07:37] to him and talk to him
[2:07:39] if you can't reconcile him then take
[2:07:41] some brother with you one or two more if
[2:07:44] he won't be reconciled then then tell it
[2:07:46] to the church and the church will
[2:07:47] dismiss him have no more fellowship with
[2:07:50] him and Jesus said whatever you lose so
[2:07:52] nerves our loosed in heaven that's the
[2:07:54] reason you have so much troubles because
[2:07:56] you don't follow the Bible principles if
[2:07:59] somebody in the church is causing a
[2:08:00] disturbance or something wrong it's not
[2:08:04] your duty to go talk about that man or
[2:08:07] that woman it's your duty to go to that
[2:08:11] man or woman and tell him his era and if
[2:08:15] he won't hear you take some other one
[2:08:17] with you he won't hear that then the
[2:08:20] church loses him jesus said what you
[2:08:22] loose on earth are loosed in heaven what
[2:08:24] you brought honor of our bond in heaven
[2:08:25] that's the power of the church now don't
[2:08:28] get the profit wrong just because you go
[2:08:30] to them and then you take somebody
[2:08:31] that's true and then you either come to
[2:08:33] me you come to brother Troy say this is
[2:08:34] what we did now just loosen I have
[2:08:36] somebody actually tell me
[2:08:40] we're gonna just put people out of
[2:08:41] church I said I don't I don't I don't
[2:08:44] know if I ever read that in Scripture
[2:08:46] what Jesus got rich well if they don't

[2:09:55] years now I want to tell this especially
[2:09:57] to the next generation you all better

[2:10:45] I'm hanging out it's one thing to have
[2:10:46] my family standing with me but it's
[2:10:49] another thing to have all the other
[2:10:50] Saints stand with me it's another thing
[2:10:55] to let other sisters and other brothers
[2:10:57] that is an opportunity for the devil to
[2:11:01] get in and now it might not happen
[2:11:03] immediately but a seed can be sown ojala

[2:12:51] with sin can not hide we we don't
[2:12:54] glorify sitting either I want you to
[2:12:57] read between the lines we do not glorify
[2:13:02] Zinn wrong is wrong and right is right
[2:13:13] so some folk might be upset with me but
[2:13:15] you're gonna have to get over it
[2:13:17] I ain't glorifying sin well you just put
[2:13:24] your category and now if it's sin it
[2:13:27] won't be glorified I understand all
[2:13:33] right
[2:13:33] that way you know everybody clear
[2:13:36] hallelujah got to do things right if you
[2:13:39] want God to bless it all right hey man
[2:13:42] now I could go deeper but I'm trusting
[2:13:45] you reading between the lines if you
[2:13:49] can't read between the lines don't worry
[2:13:51] I got an office I can talk to you about
[2:13:52] it but I don't glorify seeing a man a
[2:13:57] man I had to tell that to the brother
[2:14:00] recently uh-uh I can't come I don't
[2:14:02] glorify seeing i'ma keep readin that oh
[2:14:08] yeah I don't know why I'm all over the
[2:14:10] place like this a day but I'm s
[2:14:12] God knows God knows what needs to be
[2:14:14] said we have patience with each other
[2:14:16] alright there's just two more things
[2:14:18] that I want to read here and oh my yes
[2:14:25] let's see here okay this is out of the
[2:14:28] message who is this Melchizedek again
[2:14:31] talking about Melchizedek I'm going to
[2:14:34] paragraph 95 and this and then the last
[2:14:38] quote that I will read a man today is
[2:14:41] gonna be standing in the gap so who is
[2:14:43] this Mecca he says now the true
[2:14:45] revelation of Melchizedek comes into
[2:14:47] view what he was God the word he was God
[2:14:52] the word before he became flesh I'm a
[2:14:55] paragraph 95 says he was he was God the
[2:14:59] word before he became flesh what he got
[2:15:05] the word cause he had to be no one else
[2:15:08] could be a mortal like him see I had
[2:15:11] fathered mother you did - Jesus had
[2:15:14] father and mother but this man had no
[2:15:16] father or had no mother Jesus had a time
[2:15:19] he started this man didn't Jesus gave
[2:15:22] his life this man couldn't because he
[2:15:24] was life and it's the self-same man all
[2:15:27] the time our hope God reveals it to you
[2:15:30] the self same person all the time
[2:15:32] notices title king of righteousness now
[2:15:35] Hebrews 7 - king of righteousness and
[2:15:38] king of peace he is two kings now watch
[2:15:40] Hebrews 7 - king of righteousness also
[2:15:43] the king of peace he is two kings there
[2:15:45] now since he has come in the flesh and
[2:15:47] received his body up in revelations 21
[2:15:50] 16 he is called the king of kings he is
[2:15:53] all three of them together see King got
[2:15:56] King theophany King Jesus he is the king
[2:16:00] of kings
[2:16:01] it's men just like soul body and spirit
[2:16:04] all comes to make one also he is the
[2:16:07] father which was the first son and holy
[2:16:11] ghost of spirit king of righteousness
[2:16:13] the spirit attribute theophany king of
[2:16:16] peace theophany and in flesh he was king
[2:16:19] of kings same person so brother Branham
[2:16:21] is just trying to get us to see
[2:16:23] Melchizedek that that Abraham meant a
[2:16:26] man after he fought the battle with the
[2:16:28] right principles - having patience with
[2:16:30] with his brother lot abraham met
[2:16:34] Melchizedek which was God in the flesh I
[2:16:37] want to tell you something we can have
[2:16:39] patience one with the other
[2:16:40] we'll meet God amen in our midst we will
[2:16:43] see God in our midst
[2:16:45] Melchizedek which was God Himself that
[2:16:48] came down and serve communion to Abraham
[2:16:50] this last quote that I want to read
[2:16:52] standing in the gap very very important
[2:16:56] a man thought here Moses stood in the
[2:16:59] gap for the people that rebelled against
[2:17:01] him Abraham stood in the gap for
[2:17:04] people that rebelled against him Jesus
[2:17:06] stood in the gap for people that
[2:17:08] rebelled against him will also be asked
[2:17:10] to stand in the gap for people that
[2:17:11] rebelled against us here he says now
[2:17:14] here in Louisville Kentucky not long ago
[2:17:16] a minister was talking that there was a
[2:17:20] young lady she waited she waited a
[2:17:22] little long in life to be married now I
[2:17:24] want y'all to look at this quote with
[2:17:25] the prophecy she waited a little long in
[2:17:27] life to be married somewhere around 2530
[2:17:30] years old hallelujah
[2:17:36] it says she was fine staunch Christian
[2:17:38] girl and there was a certain man in
[2:17:41] Louisville that wasn't that mean he
[2:17:43] wasn't a Christian he hadn't lived such
[2:17:45] a good life he had run two dances in
[2:17:47] road houses and so forth but one day he
[2:17:49] found a pardon for sin and they become a
[2:17:52] real Christian real staunch Christian
[2:17:53] about a year later he fell in love with
[2:17:57] this young lady when the young lady Matt
[2:17:59] Lee fell in love with him and they were
[2:18:01] married and after they lived together a
[2:18:05] man after they lived together about two
[2:18:09] years they said they said that this
[2:18:12] young lady said her husband one day said
[2:18:14] dear I suppose that's kind of hard for
[2:18:17] you just a new Christian said I've been
[2:18:20] a Christian since a little girl but said
[2:18:21] for you a young Christian to have to
[2:18:24] stand all the wiles and temptations that
[2:18:27] goes with it after you've sinned so long
[2:18:30] he said well it does become a battle
[2:18:33] he's a confessing to his wife it does
[2:18:36] become a battle she said I want you to
[2:18:38] remember one thing that if the enemy
[2:18:41] does upset you somewhere and you fall
[2:18:45] and you go back into sin don't stay away
[2:18:49] from home see she's having patience with
[2:18:55] with a husband she realized that she's
[2:18:58] been a Christian for years and now he's
[2:19:00] just new to this walk and he might be
[2:19:02] struggling some time and the devil might
[2:19:04] trip you up but but don't stay away from
[2:19:06] home hallelujah the devil might come
[2:19:08] after and get you here and get to there
[2:19:10] but whatever you do don't don't stay
[2:19:12] away from home come always come back
[2:19:13] home look he says he says I wall
[2:19:16] to come on home said you're gonna find
[2:19:19] at home the same wife that you married
[2:19:22] glory to God he says and I'll help you
[2:19:25] to pray back and pray through and get
[2:19:29] back to God again can we have that kind
[2:19:31] of patience with one another right I
[2:19:33] don't help you to pray back and pray
[2:19:35] through and get back to God against it I
[2:19:37] don't want you to stay away said look I
[2:19:40] married you upon the basis not of what
[2:19:43] you were but I married you because I
[2:19:46] loved you and he and she said no matter
[2:19:49] what you do I still love you I married
[2:19:53] you because I love you but if if our
[2:19:59] marriages can get to that spot I married
[2:20:02] you because I loved you not because of
[2:20:04] what you could bring to the table
[2:20:07] hmm I mean I I mean you know I got to
[2:20:12] looking at some things I saw you had
[2:20:14] this you had that you can bring some
[2:20:15] things to the table what if they lose
[2:20:17] them thanks you you cut your bill you
[2:20:24] know a man what what's that you know it
[2:20:29] used to have the old sin you know you
[2:20:31] give the dimensions for the woman and
[2:20:32] all this kind of stuff and you know and
[2:20:35] you know she had certain certain
[2:20:36] dimensions I married you for them
[2:20:37] dimensions well
[2:20:40] dimensions will change are you still
[2:20:45] gonna be enough well I would love you
[2:20:48] just lose some of that weight look at
[2:20:51] you
[2:20:55] see that's not having patience one with
[2:20:57] the other nice I love you no matter what
[2:21:00] a man I don't matter I love you I love
[2:21:04] you I married you because I loved you
[2:21:07] not because of benefits I married you
[2:21:11] because I loved you if your marriage is
[2:21:14] not built on that foundation it won't
[2:21:16] last
[2:21:18] I'm gonna finish this this this this
[2:21:21] this this this wife that's having
[2:21:23] patience with her husband if you make a
[2:21:25] mistake don't stay out there come back
[2:21:27] home I'm gonna be right here you're
[2:21:29] gonna find the same wife that you that
[2:21:32] was here all alone think about this the
[2:21:37] next paragraph says in a man that day
[2:21:39] went to work and was hurt repeating it
[2:21:42] in the place where he was working so now
[2:21:44] he's telling people what his wife told
[2:21:45] him not taking advantage of it but he's
[2:21:49] touched by what she said he said now how
[2:21:53] could a man do anything wrong against
[2:21:56] some something like that when a woman
[2:21:58] that loves him so much that no matter
[2:22:00] what he did was willing to come back and
[2:22:03] take her again
[2:22:04] take him again and try it again see it
[2:22:05] shows now you multiply that by a billion
[2:22:09] and then you have some idea what the
[2:22:12] love of God is see that when a man falls
[2:22:16] in love with Jesus Christ the things of
[2:22:19] the world when you think of what he did
[2:22:21] for you in light of the scripture not in
[2:22:23] the light of some emotion but in the
[2:22:25] light of facts what it is then there
[2:22:27] something happens in you when the new
[2:22:29] birth comes the sin is dead at Mynt as
[2:22:32] dead as midnight when as long as the
[2:22:35] light is in you how can darkness shine
[2:22:37] it cannot do it that's what God did to
[2:22:41] one man who throwed itself in the gap
[2:22:45] that could take the promise and Moses
[2:22:48] being a type of this Ana type that's why
[2:22:50] Moses stood in the gap for the people
[2:22:53] Alleluia Moses could stand the gap for
[2:22:56] people that were rebelling against him
[2:22:58] and when we're having patience one with
[2:23:00] the other we're gonna have to have a man
[2:23:03] we got to stand in the gap for people
[2:23:04] that might be
[2:23:05] Belem against us that's what is calling
[2:23:09] us to pay ships with each other
[2:23:15] patience with each other don't allow the
[2:23:19] devil to get in the midst of this group
[2:23:22] God has done some mighty things and I
[2:23:24] miss but don't you let the devil come in
[2:23:26] amen have patience with each other
[2:23:28] always think the best about your brother
