the family God always enjoys stopping here trust we just get out of the way that God can have his way anything hey let's go to the scripture we go to Ephesians 6 a fetus six starting at verse ten so finally my brother be strong in the Lord and the power his may put up put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil but we also not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour God as you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand and stand let's go to 2nd Corinthians 4 during the verse 1 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in crafting out hell in the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God and if I would also be here is here to them that a loss and whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them note what they are blinded they are blinded in their mind Amen they can't they can't get a revelation they can't understand the thing that God called the garlotte is in your world has blinded their mind for we preached not our self but crises of the Lord and I was self your servant for Christ's sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ Jesus but we have this treasure in earthen vessel that he see X and their power may be of God and not of us anything that's a free Henne father surely Lord we counted a privilege to be gathered here with the Saints tonight Lord and God I just asked you to move us aside Lord they might be blessed Lord may you may your president be recognized by the Lord we know when we realize that you are here Lord then that's a celluloid car there's nothing too hard for you you're able and willing to meet in the need that we have Lord and I just pray God you break the bread of life - and may it fall on good ground and bring forth fruit subito like I asked in the name of Jesus Christ amen we've been you may be seated I want to free showing up the bell of the mind a man we know that there's a great warfare that's going on and it is not a flesh and red belt but it's a spiritual warfare amen to the greatest Balor LFO and then we're fired for the greatest prize they'll ever fall for though when people fight for calls that people go to fight they go to war they go for call they're fighting for principle but we're fighting for eternal life hey this culture will give it everything for it well done forever it's worth living for this is the greatest call that it ever was amen amen so we're in this warfare counselor we have a warfare right now it is between right and wrong it between doubt is they a man you can't get out of warfare even when you called it just America the devil come to but didn't come to get anything he come to rob you hey there hey Mary you will we're in a grave warfare but we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus we are more than a match for the devil for the water inside of hell over a company amen amen and that's what what you got to meet your enemy is in your life there's the battleground there was Satan and God is cited is in your mind a mayor say they are trying to ignore it you throw to just bleed or are they going away but God is trying to get you to breathe a word and then I would drop down in your heart here become a revelation so then when you got to meet you enemy is in your mind it's same kind of feature in your mind then you are this feeder person amen amen so called a word and the faith coming in mind and drop into the soul hey Mara lovely but if you let us stay in the mind he won't do you much good amen her knowledge you can all come with her knowledge there's got to be a revelation hey man you know a lot of people they get a lot of the hair but it got to come in the heart I will say if you get too much of the hair you come top-heavy and then you follow favorite where you get a heart you got a revelation representing the greatest fellow will fall so the mine is the gate to the soul your man opened up a cell to spirit a rejecter spirit amen he said you can have love caution and love feeling and listen say the only thing that had nothing to do with it everybody just sensations thing but when it come into reality your mind open up your mind either accepted or rejected amen amen sir and Mark the were death will be accepted in ER my bleeding heart and generally God become a reality to you hey man let's look at the Romans quail Roman square one I beseech you therefore brother by the mercy of God that you was that your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and knows you and I'm not especially that's your reasonable service and be not conformed to the world but being your transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what are they good acceptable and perfect will of God a mess so be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen the renewing mean like your Yukos thank you was a renovation of your mind to be made over for dinner amen and there are your transform by the renewing of your mind it is see it is Vanessa in the best of the great bellow for it's your mind and open the door or close the door and listen to your crush you don't listen to you your memories or listen to your affection but when your mind close yourself to detain and let God the spirit of is wait come here it blows the rest of the stuff out and it dollars go there if fears go in a cessation of a doubt as well it will feel as though there's nothing standing there but the weather bar and sing can knock Valerie is there a mare so the dumb I accepted the word amen he scepter life which of the word and that brings a life in you amen we know say so the values the mind so Satan belly with our mind system and then the first thing that Satan you've only he were a will reason there's a first taxes on human being in it work it is still worth hey my love you they can't see the way how they're trying to figure it out say it is not reasonable it not supposed to be reasonable his world to be believed and you can figure out God you don't need a revelation but how can we take a little he won't brain and figure out ah we've got to smoke the world in existence all the way we know God and why he reveals herself to nothing people can know the Greek and they can order Hebrew and still no no God so God is not known by education he's know about revelation amen so Satan you you reason Satan then just come out and say that our only word is wrong when he told me he said what God was wrong she's there were the gods right if you wanna listen to let's say there's more reason within it hey there so you cannot reason you got depend on God everywhere and God has always been feeded him but saying your sculptor has God's not said then he has God said you should not either the trees of the garden and he come back with what God said we can't either the trees we can either the trees of the guard but if we touch it free in the midst of the god or not of the tree of knowledge of good and evil then we're back Satan and say well he's wrong you won't die he said well now that was surely not that look at all that problem they're not he put in it that was surely not that that's all he put in there look how a tornado hit and a reason would have said if you're eating it you wouldn't know and you will be like God well what does he already like God the head itro life it will not weigh like god but she wanted someone Satan light and never will call the fall hey got it and I say that rather than say there is a real reasonable person accrete you whatever you favorite but you don't have to reason with it you can take the revelation on the Word of God and if we say in a place on the inner circle said amen amen so same drug death today you were raised by reason that we were told to cast down reason you know what you think in your mind this is what you believe in your heart amen it's what's your heart telling you and not your mind hey then let's go to a second color I'm inserting two rinses justice here verse three so do we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the webinar our warfare are not calm but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and agree that that means reason cancer not imagination and a half thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ all that we can do that we should be Victoria Christmas we can bring every thought to the obedience of the Word of God amen amen brother sir unbelief castle reason I'm lead rely on reason present-day Thane faith don't do that face hole at that word but faith plays a cell phone an hour rule of my rockem's art of God each hour and then they won't look at reason hey there amen I don't care how much you can show that it would be better if the word say so face rest is there and that's what your faith rest the word says all right don't matter what it looked like or what anybody else said what the word says there were faith with a man if you got a Revelator word nobody can take a revelation of love now if somebody talk you into somebody talk Janna they're a lot of people been around for 30 or 40 years the last four year therefore adorable yet they had knowledge of the message some of you preached it and it was good please you well give the caller debrief it anyway mmm but they went back because they had no revelation nobody can take a revelation from you and someone said I will deceive your world but that was before he came to the miss it and they never got a revelation so there's there to see there's some sake weights on that reason and they they reason so well it'd be better this is nothing to party ever and we are that you know what they say that we're just preaching a gospel of love love with the things of the world loan to be like the world they say we're free it does freedom deliver me from it then I don't say that outside of Christ they're free to live like the world well all sinners are free to live like the world hey hey man what are the crispy without caring it like the world will see you cry we'll see this then little a conjurer the Word of God amen Robel said that I missus from that time he's also spoke frankly all of us here tonight couldcould now it's all my memory I say I'm talking about Satan face you on memory and you know what remember you can recall faith in your mind experience that already pass and he said I suppose all of us tonight could recall the memory a certain thing that taken place at certain time and from that time something chain such and such a thing happened and from that time and for that time it was different and and it's a good thing that we can and some of those many are saying that that we think is where the thing that changed and there's something there's not worth think enough see there's something that a word thing you can think of the time that God got off your life if they change with you you won't difficult you know but the other thing that they're in your path they're not worried or faking them so st. Oliver Martin saying they will remind you or the good thing he will remind you and the bad thing when they start do just to remind him that he got the wrong address I mean he got the right house but they've got a little bit of oil your new creation and they're saying face you in your memory even when you guys get son from God Satan came bringing past sin in your memory a man so he accuses you used to do that you just tell him you didn't do it everybody that God did you don't have to be identified what it is hey man our middle story one guy is strong within town he met somebody grew up with him so I've met John and he knew he sees a new you there so yeah he's they used to do this and you used to do that so did you listen oh so well John said he knew so what tell said that he knew they got it died and they tell you see John tell them to come back I'll tell him how that old guy died hey say that I always try to identify you with your path anyway that Kristen you do something wrong and Satan keep beating you around the bus ride but if when it's under their blood God don't remember why are you meditating on it hey man we're not careful with other new Pitons say that God name of you do something wrong and the crisp enough no math you don't mean to do it here's a mistake God don't even counted against you listen to the man who God will not impute sin amen you're in the sin of the one God can't see you he's seen your sacrifice hey men but say no they will work on our numerous sometimes even in your friend you're trying to bleed God for a hill and it's hard to say remember so so trying it and they didn't get well they've got nothing to do with it that's your faith and God and all things are possible doubly we should believe that we heard enough hey man that's at the theme of the campaign and the things I would use crisis same yesterday today forever the probably breached MSO more than any other breath messily guarded trying to get us to realize that he's the same God and all things are possible he'll garden will change he's a private a God he's not the god I was wait our world or the great I will be he's a great I am he's a peasant a God hey there hey man praise God but you know I would say no they tried to work on assistant to get us to this we the Word of God let's go to Philippians 3 verse 13 Paul is speaking here you know Paul had quite a a background so brother I count not myself to help apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus amen Paul was were persecuting the church Paul said I was a blasphemer but I did Ignace and then he was doing everything he can I'll gifted the against the Church of God and no doubt Satan remind him but he said I forgot those things behind impress the Lord on a hot car in the dark in question and that's what we got to do no matter what you did in the past is it forgiven when you would come in Christ you just placed a mark of the high calling in Christ amen amen forget all about the plan and and lay for the browser amen and keep going forward in the service little over I look at it feed you we're trying to watch our time I know it's the weekday and you probably work but don't don't get too tired okay a free Ephesian too Ephesian to one and you had who has quickened who were dead in sin and trust me now he made you alive quicken me to may light after death you all did this intro but here's quicken you in taipei we walk a car to the course of the world according to the prince of the power the spirit are not working in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of a stretch of the mind and would by nation to chew on a Ralph's even as other I know we are whatever our whole living in time past like that and then I want makes you would like to chew on the wall that we have another major change lot of people said they they got a given that definition of being a Christian is be religious they got nothing to do with your nature got to be changed so long as you got a sinful nature you still a sinner remember did you got that nature cry you're not a sinner amen so we had that in time path but not now quarter verse four enforcer but God who is rich in mercy for his great law plain he loved us aren't you glad he's rich in mercy is over Lord mercy we are not consumed even when we were dead in sin has quick enough together with Christ by grace you'll see and he'll raise us up together and made us ascent in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm a god rich in mercy has quickened up together and cried and made of the set in heavenly places in crisis Amen I haven't I place it and you know what brother I say hell here's a heavenly atmosphere you're heavily in your soul days are everybody is in one Accord and nobody got nothing to get more bad everybody got the Holy Ghost honorable and everybody is that the horse up the Heather the winter God expecting God to do something they attack Oh what happened to places I don't want to be in heavenly places every time we come together and God will surely moon so you get what you expect hey man look us 1st Corinthians 6 verse nine know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not conceited are deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers not if liberate us no abuser of himself with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor el Dorados and exalt the shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you're washed but you were sanctified but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God Amen see you were like there but you're no more you wash your sanctify you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the Spirit of God amen amen I reverence that invisible union said the word justified is just a dope you never done it hey then so you're justified is just as though you never done it hey there but it's not even we got regarded at all the highs are done God God's book on the seal forgive me your own book and Maris is divorced and deep it's not even in the memory of God hey man we are we don't think like that you know you do something wrong you for you you make a mistake you make the same mistake the Lord I did it again and you guys said what again hey God goddamn it listen and see it see you forgiven hey hey men robbed Elsa no I'm willing to start what would you are justified therefore being justified it would accuse you you are the accuser you never done it in the first place well nothing you never done in the first place what are you worried about something you never done in the first place well the first place the first place in the Mara God and then I God God didn't see you at the Senate he didn't see as you are now that he see in a glorified state and then today they'll be people no he predestinated to be girl fall in Arizona Sun and don't even tell today he called and they'll be caught he justified and those he justified he already glorified so God sees you in a finished thing though he's still working on you but he's the author and the finisher of your faith he got to bring you to their door sighs thing is God presented you a breeder you got to be there don't never get stuff to predestinated when it ah hey then pays goes so we we can we can put it in in the sea of forgetfulness and God can put it in to see if we give them we don't have what hey but God can put it in a sea of forgetfulness now lobbies that whatever God you get to see if forgiven I'll see later isn't about and Micah 7:19 he said he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquity and and will cast all our sealed at a delicacy now that's a seat he Catherine the devil see and in Hebrews 10 and 16 said this is the color that I will make with them after the old days said the law I will put my love in their heart and in their mind and I will write their first seven and their share their iniquity I will wrote never no more now they're in the scene he don't remember that's not like to see it will give me hey there Amen sorry if our thoughts are contrary to the word that we'll get to thank you and take the word amen and then probably a felicitous part I'll have to think on the things that I that appeared that a low blue that in appraising verse you then report or think only thing every so we'll take all these things then we'll figure the right thing when you're thinking that they were to God then God can medicine the word in your life hey man even God during all time he told Joshua so you shall meditate on the Grippit of all day night vision eyes you're not developing your mouth and then show you how this is said then share your posture but a way to frost when you're meditating on the Word of God amen and when you're when you like say when you think of what God is doing brought out the with you talk about God and you think about God that's when he draws near Haman and the son said when I think of the goodness of Jesus and I all he does for me my soul cries out hallelujah praise God for saving me amen if you're saving that started for you to thank all the goodness of Jesus maybe I heard a story you know what guy you with the visit I think of the Fire Lord Farlow rid it down and so what's wrong with you just too many things go wrong so the guy looks pretty wise and say well tell me what did to how you guys say yes so you know guys start talking about what God did for you say well I got no problem when you think of it where God it does but the great God to save you he's gonna meet you everything and he's working everything together for your good nobody what you going through God gathered in control say Katie will do there to tell plea would I let me get permission for God in the first place then he got to be working together for you good amen but you know Satan works on our imagination that's a big one Oh a lot of people imagine all kind of thing there's nothing to a man let's go let's go to Genesis Genesis 6 verse five and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and repented God that he made me on earth and it grieved him in his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man who I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping things and the father laugh they repented me that I have made you and Noah found grace and I have to go H if I'm glad you found grace than either God remember why they do Rebecca every imagination of man life will weaken and that's where that's that's a day we're living here then the world that everything they can think of is wicked it's gross darkness and it's dog you

little bit amen Satan tear taxes and dip away he attacks our conscious you know a console of knowledge or right and wrong so many time you attack people by their conscious let's look at Hebrews 5 he will fire quail for when for time we ought to be teachers we have me that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God I become Setia have need a milk and not of strong meat for everyone to use milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness for his urbane but strongly blown to them little foolish even though who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil a message some people don't they conscious a lot of knowledge so right and wrong and from that day people don't know what right and what's wrong hey man you know something but they think Allah is right with his own a man I've got what mobility by some politician and while it was the water would an old day I think it's a barrel incident you know he always tell the truth and so Obama said I always tell a lie and cleanser I don't know different by the Royal apology today over how you lower they lie they loose abou or they held their father to del you know he's a father line but people don't know right well many people can't judge because you want to right and wrong or what true in error oh they think if your guest for Virgin hornacek you saying your praises you know I told her that's prejudice I said well if I'm against prostitution if that praises so no I said well that's worse than positive is more of a perversion but they don't know like like Pilate asked Jesus he said what is true Jesus I come to the truth may be manifested every one of the truth bleeds me here's me and Paula so what is true well he was standing in the face of truth and after one is true and people right at the word of God and say what is true so they don't know what true when they see it robust it in an oddball to do you know preach that they can't judge which is right the Word of God or their chest denomination oh you can tell them that but they they take their narration on all right what do married people and they asked their pastor and the pastor said this so that's what they got past the religion that's the absolute I one of my neighbors they were ridin we ran home for working he brought it up he said the bow said whatever you doing where did he do it all in the name of Jesus Christ that's a yeah that's right while all these people bow down in the towel the falls are noble to go I know they did it he said well if they in his spirit you for that was I'm glad yes so I gave him bunch of script he looked him up - yeah yeah he called it faster in the pastor said we don't have no true record I had our fossil real about that so you don't have a true record you just read out of the bowel I said and they just be talking you guys you know believe the bowels are true record but they're they believe it faster then you read it either way to go because that was his absolute he will believe anything they bleed our leaders the people they leave a message they bleed Oh God then when they do they were to God and then God they got nothing but argument they don't you have a life if they were so garlic it was there as sober or spiritual why they're looking more and more like the wrong garlic garlic does a submariner you don't blend in with the world and you want to be like the world you can't be like God if you love to they low water level God not in you well Brown said an oddball he said he thought my preacher couldn't really write wrong he said they don't know who's row today they can't judge between right role I know that that was said it but our church says see people are not capable of judging right role anything that's contractor the bower is wrong God's Word is right that every man would be aligned let God be true amen and the Bible said and I was a fat queer so woe unto them that car they call evil good and good evil and put darkness for light and light for dogs it for bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter yesterday I see the a sighting on fear of movies or theater one time and said good is evil I said if I was saying that they were doing it called good even he were good and never they're doing today they think they think the thing that so contrary to Oregon is good it's great but his death about the war on today let's go to first teams got lots of strippers hope you love the word first first Timothy chapter 4 verse 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron but then the mayor and command to restrain from me which God has created to be received with Thanksgiving Adam was believe and know the truth amen for her creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if his received with Thanksgiving for his sanctified by the Word of God and prayer amen this song was support for the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen well you know that speak of the Catholic yet but not only the Catholic Church many held appointed for the faith and everything that's contrary to the word is the doctrine of the devil or they tell people all you do is come to church you know and some of they got away from tithes and awfully anyway they pay their dues my brother wouldn't have the basket there my brother went down there and what a woman died and they said well they said you pay your dues she could make it she paid her dues she made it I'm sure she made it somewhere you can't pay your way to help oh yeah yeah they made a pair to do you got to be a point of Christ to go to hell if people see people that nonsense there then but the people are satisfied with it and they were stated like people to let be and rule over them they won't a man king or the man can rule over them they get on his sphere but we want to be on the spirit of Jesus Christ hey there Robinson this evil the god of this evasion said the church a disobedient and it shirin all beaten has nothing in common one is of the day amen the other one is of the night darkness

consciousness you have no no conviction uh nope nothing care about nothing oh man that's where people get needy people are so hard they care nothing right anything that's what Billy's going a little bit let's go to Hebrews chin Hebrews 10:19 having therefore brother and boulders here into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he had concentrated for us through the veil that is say his flesh having a high priest over the house of God let us draw nigh with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water hey they're having our hearts pranker for my evil conscience hey man Amen so it look at another one we know we closed on the card we don't want our cuts to see it we want to have a good in a pure conscience before God hey man hey man we could go on some question but when one skip over call we get late hey there but many people I just say that many people are not conscious of the problem the God that's mean they do the thing they do so they are not consulate apparently are they really cut another prevalent God they wouldn't do the thing to do and many time I believe we're not conscious enough of the problem of God having a third time we are so worried and we all are upset though we don't realize they're guarding with us and God is working everything together for all good hey there and it's really about said in the last day they would have a form of garden for the night of power there I realized that God is the same yesterday today and family but let's move on to

whole affection is on Christ Jesus whether we let it die will serve Him and love him and go forward then all we can to magnify him to the people hey man one more stretch before we blow Kalasha Colossians chapter 3 first one if you didn't be risen and Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sets on the right hand of God such as affection on things above and not on things of this earth for your dead and your life is here with Christ and I and when Christ without light shall appear the show he also appear with him in glory hey there praise God hey man if you want to blow into heaven bro Brown said on failing reality of the Living God then then you're there there that's where your affection ought to be on things about Jesus set your affections on things above and not

Lord just coming I brought those things to our hearts the this greatest battle a man the Battle of the mind the Prophet gives us that this is the greatest battle ever fought was the one that section felt in mine and I love that once they've made you you can't overcome with a head knowledge if it's gonna have to be a revelation something that God drops down and your heart and I think too many people are actually trying to overcome just what we're heading on you know and it's very easy to get hit knowledge you know you can just hang around the church and learn behaviors you can learn patterns you can learn how to act just like everybody else act you know I mean all that's a learned behavior but if it's not in the heart when the battle comes right when when the trial actually hits

mistakes right it's one thing to willfully do some things wrong and it's another thing you know when you just kind of make a mistake and you do something you quickly repent but this song says the blood that gives me strength from day to day but never lose this power and that's why we're grateful they meant for what Jesus did at Calvary is cross we don't have to walk around with our heads
