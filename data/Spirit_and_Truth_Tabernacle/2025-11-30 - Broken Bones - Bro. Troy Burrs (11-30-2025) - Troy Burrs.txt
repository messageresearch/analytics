We are uh unfortunately on a time restraint when we come here on Sunday mornings and uh I know the word of God has to have preeminence. Amen. In the in the in the midst of the people of God and and and there's uh something that I I do um just in my own way that I try to get all the ministers scheduled.

Oh father God, deliver where deliverance is needed. Oh father God, in Jesus name we pray. Church, say amen. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. It's good to see everyone. Amen. See we had a church everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. It's good to see all the saints. Amen. This got a meeting kind of atmosphere in here. I kind of wanted to come out the back. Jack was talking about a Jericho march and shouting, "Listen, my feet just getting right from last week. Got to let me know. I bring my tennis shoes." I shout it so much last week. I went home said, "Oh, I need my feet rub." My wife said, "Uhuh. We ain't falling for that one." Amen. She precious. I appreciate my wife. Just thought I would say that. My rib, she's uh she's a good wife to me. Take care. Amen. We won't prolong the time. Try to get through this real quick. Maybe we have some time for some of these uh gifts as brother Jack was saying. Real quickly, let's turn to Matthew 18 and 12. Amen. and uh read a couple of scriptures. Let the Lord have his way. We see what the Lord going to do. Amen. Matthew 18:12 reads, "For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost. How think ye, if a man have a hund sheep, and one of them be gone astray, do he not leave the 90 and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray. And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoicth more of that sheep than the 90 and nine which went not astray. Even so is not the the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou has gained a brother. Amen. You may be seated. May a blessing to the reading of his word. Amen. I also want to just look at another scripture here in Samuel 2 Samuel 12 1-7 and it says and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men and one in the city, the one rich, the other poor. The rich man had exceeding great many flocks and and herds, but the poor man had nothing saved the little u lamb, which he had brought and nourished up, and it grew up together with him, and with his children. It did eat and his own uh of eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter. And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take his own And there came a traveler unto the rich man. And he spared to take his own flock and of uh and of his own herd to dress for the wayfairing man that was come unto him. But the flock but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man and was and for the man that was come to him. And David anger was greatly kindled against the man. And he said to Nathan, "As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die." Amen. Not realizing that David was speaking of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to title this this morning broken bones. &gt;&gt; Broken bones. Amen. And uh the Bible says that all we like sheep have gone astray. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So this passage of scripture is basically speaking to every one of us. &gt;&gt; Because we've all had different situations in our lives. Amen. But that that have appeared as broken broken bones. &gt;&gt; We are uh reminded that every son and daughter of God must be tried and tested. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all pray for me this morning. Uh if we go on to read here the sixth verse says and he shall restore the lamb four-fold because he did this thing and because he had no pity. &gt;&gt; Pity is an emotional state of anger against the rich man. And he's not showing any pity either because he has just pronounced a death sentence &gt;&gt; to the man. Amen. That Samuel WAS TALKING ABOUT NOT KNOWING it was him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; SEE, HE HAD NO compassion &gt;&gt; for the for for the man and what he was going through. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If we read on, Amen. back in the scripture I just read about uh all of the the the sheep that went astray. &gt;&gt; And then if YOU GO ON FURTHER, HE'S TALKING ABOUT IF ANY MAN OFFENDS THEE, &gt;&gt; YOU GO AFTER him &gt;&gt; or her. Right. &gt;&gt; SEE, BECAUSE UH ONCE YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN, &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU UH UH UH WE'LL GET INTO IT A LITTLE LATER, BUT I'M GOING TO JUST GO AHEAD AND PREACH THIS MORNING IF that's all right. &gt;&gt; See, YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN AND YOU TEAR DOWN, AMEN, THE BRIDGES BEHIND YOU. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING IS ONCE YOU GET YOUR MIND MADE UP, &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND YOU STOP BECOMING JUST A CASUAL CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU YOU YOU YOU GOT A MADEUP MIND AND YOU'RE GETTING SERIOUS WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; SEE, SOME SOME OF US ARE JUST CASUAL CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE COME TO CHURCH WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE COME AMEN. OUT OF TRADITION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THERE'S REALLY NO BURNING IN THE HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE THINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. AMEN. BUT THERE'LL BE COME A TIME, AMEN, THAT A PERSON, AMEN, REALLY GET SOMETHING DOWN ON THE INSIDE. AMEN. AND THEIR ATTITUDE CHANGES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THEM UH ON THOSE UH PROPPED UP SERVICES. AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THEM MORE OFTEN IN THE SANCTUARY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO SEE DIFFERENT CHANGES ABOUT THEM. AMEN. BUT SEE, THIS IS THE VERY TIME, AMEN, THAT THE DEVIL IS TAKING NOTICE. &gt;&gt; HE CUZ SEE, HE DON'T MIND YOU BEING JUST A CASUAL CHRISTIAN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID IF YOU'RE LUKEWARM, AMEN, HE'LL SPEW YOU OUT OF HIS MOUTH. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WHEN YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY GOOD. CASUAL CHRISTIANS, THEY DON'T HAVE CHALLENGES LIKE AMEN. UH THE REST OF THE CHRISTIANS DO. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. BECAUSE WHEN YOU BECOME A A SOLD OUT BELIEVER, THE DEVIL HAS A TARGET ON YOU. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID, AMEN. THAT EVERY BELIEVER MUST BE TRIED &gt;&gt; and tested. &gt;&gt; Praise God. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THINK IT NOT STRANGE THESE FIERY TRIALS THAT WE go through. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, IN THIS SECTION, WE'RE LOOKING AT DAVID. &gt;&gt; And I'm GOING TO READ ON HERE SAYS UH IN IN IN 51, Psalms 51 5-8, he says, "BEHOLD, I was shaped in iniquity." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And in sin did my MOTHER CONCEIVE THEE. BECAUSE SEE, REVELATION BEGIN TO COME TO DAVID. WHY? BECAUSE THE PROPHET SAMUEL GO ON DOWN THERE IN THE SEVENTH VERSE. AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID, "THOU &gt;&gt; ART THE MAN." &gt;&gt; DAVID KNEW WHAT HE HAD DONE, &gt;&gt; BUT IT JUST DIDN'T DAWN ON HIM &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAD REALLY DONE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO, A PROPHET CAME AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A PARABLE. Y'ALL STAY WITH ME HERE. &gt;&gt; SPOKE TO HIM IN A PARABLE. AMEN. SO THAT HE HE HE WOULD WALK INTO THE THING AND HIS EYES ARE OPEN AND THEN HIT HIM WITH THE BOMBSHELL. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; SO, I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME THIS MORNING BECAUSE I MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You see, David began to think on his ways. David said here, "BEHOLD, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive thee, CONCEIVE ME. BEHOLD, THY DESIRES TRUTH in my inward parts. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST ON THE SURFACE. &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID HE DESIRED TRUTH IN HIS SOUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE GOES ON AND HE HE HE SAYS TO THE LORD, "LORD, PURGE ME &gt;&gt; WITH HIS." SEE, NOW HE HE REALIZES, AMEN. AND THE THE THE THE THE UH THE DAMAGE OF HIS WAYS AND THE THINGS. AMEN.

All right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to pay real attention there. &gt;&gt; He went here from the prophet Samuel and giving them the parable revelation set in about his own nature, realizing that he was among a a fallen nature. &gt;&gt; Amen.

WHICH CAUSED THE WHOLE WORLD TO GO INTO CORRUPTION. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY EVER SINCE THAT TIME GOD DISAPPROVE of women preachers. &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN PREACHER GOT FULLY ANOINTED SITTING UP UNDER THE TOUTELAGE OF THE SERPENT. &gt;&gt; CAME BACK AND GOT A LITTLE ANOINTED AND SAID, "WELL, I CAN DO THIS." &gt;&gt; AND DID A GOOD JOB &gt;&gt; PREACHING FALSE DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT CAUSE EVERY MAN, &gt;&gt; AMEN, TO STRUGGLE. &gt;&gt; EVERY WOMAN TO STRUGGLE, THROW THE WHOLE WORLD INTO CHAOS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, DAVID, BECAUSE OF THIS SITUATION, BEGIN TO LOOK AND SAY, "OH, UH, I I I WAS BORN IN SIN &gt;&gt; SHAPING IN INIQUITY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH." SO, I SHUDDER TO TELL YOU, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF MYSELF. LET'S go here to uh um the message the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh chapter 37. The prophet said, REMEMBER THAT OLD SHEPHERD STORY? What was there uh in Jerusalem in the holy lands of a shepherd was packing a sheep and he said what you packing that sheep for? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Said it's got a broken leg. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; HOW'D IT DO THAT? DID IT FALL OVER A CLIFF? Said no. I broke its leg. &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "Why you a cruel shepherd to break that sheep's leg?" See, our ways are not like God's ways. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; See, he had no problem breaking the leg because he knew he could heal it. &gt;&gt; WHAT HESITATION WOULD HE HAVE BREAKING LEG? AMEN. WHEN HE CAN TURN AROUND and fix it. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I WANT TO I I WANT TO GET TO THE meat of this A LITTLE BIT HERE AND AND SAY WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He can fix it. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, BECAUSE UH UH UH UH US LIKE DAVID, GOD WANTS TO UH CARRY US TO A PLACE, AMEN, OF OF OF SWEET SURRENDER. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET ME READ ON HERE. IT SAYS SOMETIMES GOD HAS TO LET US BREAK DOWN JUST A LITTLE bit &gt;&gt; he say BREAK DOWN IN HE in health to give us a little extra attention &gt;&gt; to get us upon his lap to woo us in HIS BOSOM. WHEN THE DOCTOR said nothing can be done, then he takes us into his bosom and say, "See, I love you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you get well." &gt;&gt; That's something. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO LET you get well. Oh, doesn't that just make life better? &gt;&gt; He is so grateful. He is so a marvelous shepherd, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN. NO wonder David said, "The Lord is my shepherd." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SEE, HE HAD DONE BEEN through something. &gt;&gt; Let me continue reading here. Amen. Psalms 51 5-8. He say, "Behold," when he said, "Behold, I will shape iniquity. Purge me with his make me to his joy and gladness. Then then will I teach transgressors &gt;&gt; thy ways &gt;&gt; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now bear with me. I printed this out this time. Amen. If we take a little bit here from Psalms five. Amen. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity. Did I uh sin did my mother and send into my mother's conceived me? He goes on and say, I desires truth in my inward parts. You see, since the time of Adam, we have all come birthed into the world by human nature. Amen. a flaw bent out of shape from what God had intended for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the reason us humans are like this is because of the fact the method of our conception was founded upon a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember that your first birth was produced by a result of unbelief in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you were born then it produces a nature in you that causes you to be able to receive and believe God's word, God's sick for your age. Once you get a new nature, Amen. And it goes on to say here, amen, that uh this is why the evidence of the new birth is when you receive the message that God sent &gt;&gt; for your age. All right. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand here that David had to go through this &gt;&gt; in the in the in the scripture that we just read that HE GOD ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN TO David for a reason. &gt;&gt; WHEN DAVID REALIZED THE CONDITION THAT he was in, his whole attitude changed. Remember in the beginning he wanted to HE HE WAS A &gt;&gt; DEATH SENTENCE. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IF YOU GO THROUGH PSALMS YOU SEE ALL ABOUT THE MERCIES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; ALL ABOUT THE MERCIES. GOD HAD TO SHOW David &gt;&gt; his loving kindness. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This is why David Amen. has so many great songs. because of this situation. &gt;&gt; SO IN OUR JOURNEY AND IN OUR LIVES, WE GO THROUGH THINGS. &gt;&gt; IT ALLOW US TO BE tried and tested. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE MAY GO THROUGH. If we will, let's uh I want to read something here. Beginning, ending. Let's see here if I have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bear with me here. say now noticing then uh I'm reading from the uh 23rd chapter noticing then when these brethren were down there they were put to a test &gt;&gt; beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation I think I'm at 23 very beautiful example of what a true believer comes to when he accepts the Lord Jesus as his savior, he is always put to a test. &gt;&gt; Satan still in the testing business and it comes and it only comes about to help you. It's for your good. &gt;&gt; GOD, &gt;&gt; EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST be tried, chasened, scoued. In other words, give a little thrashing, straightening up. And if God gives us some chastisement and we can't stand it, then we become illegitimate children &gt;&gt; and not the children of God. &gt;&gt; Now, a man that REALLY GOT HIS FACE SET TOWARDS HEAVEN, NO MATTER WHAT TAKES PLACE HERE ON EARTH, HE'S STILL GOT HIS face set toward heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. His friend may forsake him. &gt;&gt; His family &gt;&gt; may forsake him. &gt;&gt; Hold on TO YOUR CHAIR. HIS pastor &gt;&gt; may forsake him. BUT THERE IS ONE THAT won't forsake him &gt;&gt; and that's God. &gt;&gt; And when your MIND IS MADE UP LIKE THAT, AMEN. then you're on your way. All right. &gt;&gt; Many times God begins to carry a person on in their Christian journey and so many people are now have gone astray. &gt;&gt; May not be AMONG THE FOLD. WHY? Somebody hurt me. Well, well, if if if if you made a decision &gt;&gt; BASED ON WHAT SOMEONE ELSE DID, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOUR EYES WERE NOT FOCUSED on the right thing. &gt;&gt; He say it may be your it may be the one sitting next to you this morning. BUT YOU HAVE TO STAY FULLY FOCUSED. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Remember I r I read the scripture there in Matthew. Amen. THAT IF YOUR BROTHER OFFEND YOU, &gt;&gt; you go to him. &gt;&gt; Or her. Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; You don't take the move uh that uh David took when Samuel came to him. All &gt;&gt; dinners &gt;&gt; or I DON'T HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; GOD IS DOING SOMETHING. SEE, YOUR YOUR MIND IS ON YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE DISCOMBOBULATED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE UH UH MAYBE JUST GOD IS DOING SOMETHING &gt;&gt; TO BRING THAT PERSON ALLOWING THEM TO FALL INTO A DISPARAGING SITUATION &gt;&gt; TO BRING THEM CLOSER TO HIM. &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHEEP HAS GONE ASTRAY. AMEN. THE BROKEN LEG IS A METAPHOR. IT MIGHT NOT BE uh uh actually a broken leg. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT A METAPHOR FOR A SITUATION THAT THEY HAVE GOT IN &gt;&gt; THAT HAS CAUSED GREAT CONTENTMENT. BUT GOD WHO IS SO RICH IN MERCY &gt;&gt; GOES AFTER THAT SHEEP &gt;&gt; SEE THE BIBLE SAYS MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE. &gt;&gt; AND A STRANGER THEY'LL NOT FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; SO SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT THAT SHEEP CAN NO LONGER HEAR THE VOICE. &gt;&gt; SO HE HAS TO GO AFTER THEM. &gt;&gt; MY GOD. YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY CAME HERE. I WAS WATCHING A LITTLE THING ON SHEEP and uh uh there was a a bunch of sheep grazing in the field AND THE SHEPHERD WAS ABLE TO GO TO THOSE TO PEOPLE that was I think uh like a tourist thing and they would go out there and try to call the sheep. Whatever they were saying, &gt;&gt; you know, they just got to it's not it's just a call &gt;&gt; that they have become used to hearing &gt;&gt; and when they hear that call they come a gathering. &gt;&gt; THEY COME GATHERING. SO THEY ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WENT OUT AND SHE would do the same and try to mimic it exactly the way of the shepherd and just do the uh what I would call the yodel or whatever they was doing or whatever and the sheep didn't move. Oh my &gt;&gt; just stood THERE &gt;&gt; AND THEY LET SEVERAL PEOPLE GO AND TRY TO CALL the sheep and they would do their little call and things like that, the sheep just moved. &gt;&gt; They just they just kept grazing like they didn't EVEN HEAR. &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE THAT SHEPHERD &gt;&gt; GOT OUT THERE AND HE BEGAN TO CALL &gt;&gt; HIS SHEEP, &gt;&gt; YOU SAW SHEEP COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. THEY STOPPED WHAT THEY WERE DOING, &gt;&gt; TURNED TOWARDS THE SHEPHERD, &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN TO WALK SLOWLY TOWARDS THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; SHEEP BEGAN TO COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS, &gt;&gt; WALKING TOWARDS THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; NOW THE SHEPHERD LOOKING BECAUSE HE KNOW HIS SHEEP AS WELL. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I SAID, "I SEE THIS ONE &gt;&gt; AND I SEE THAT ONE." &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND I SEE THIS ONE, &gt;&gt; BUT WHERE'S SUCH AND SUCH? &gt;&gt; BUT I BEGAN TO CONTINUE TO CALL &gt;&gt; AND ALL THE SHEEP WAS GATHERED RIGHT AT HIS FEET AFTER A WHILE. &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE FOR THEM TO GET THERE CUZ THEY NOT RUNNING. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. BUT THEY TAKE THEIR TIME AND THEY COMING. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT HE NOTICED ONE MISSING. &gt;&gt; LORD HAVE MERCY. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED? DID A WOLF GET THEM? &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SHEEP? &gt;&gt; NOW MAYBE THE SHEEP JUST CAN'T SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SO THEY COULD GET A HOLD OF THAT BAD GRASS. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT I MEAN BY SOME FALSE DOCTRINE AMEN. OR THAT SHEEP BE MAY BE JUST A LITTLE BIT WOUNDED. SEE, WE GET WOUNDED IN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE BROKENNESS THAT YOU FEEL. &gt;&gt; SO HE COME AFTER THAT ONE BROKEN SHEEP. &gt;&gt; OH MY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE TAKES HIM. AMEN. AND HE BREAKS HIS LEG. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT LEG bones that I learned from my wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those leg bones are very serious. &gt;&gt; This might be something on your test, Zion. &gt;&gt; Cuz it was on her test. They had a scenario of a person with all kind of conditions, a heart condition and this kind of condition and another young man I believe was on a motorcycle and he broke his leg. Now which one is deserves the the right now attention? It was that broken leg &gt;&gt; because it's one of the biggest bones &gt;&gt; in the body. And I think something about the protein now I didn't go to the class. She just told me protein entering into the bloodstream. You you am I right, sis? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. She go she f to be a doctor, so she knows some of this, too. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But but but but but so UH THEN HE TOOK THAT SHEET AND PACKED him on his shoulders, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THE STRONGEST PART OF HIS BODY, &gt;&gt; and took it in. Amen. And nursed it back to health. See, that's what David was going through. HIS BONES HAD BEEN BROKEN. HE WAS A BROKEN MAN AFTER HE had realized, AMEN, THE STATE of his being. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came out better on the other side. &gt;&gt; He be And he says on here, now here's this. He says in 13 then see the word when I hear the word then &gt;&gt; something changed. &gt;&gt; SEE THERE WAS BEFORE &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; NOW THERE'S THEN MEANING IT WAS DIFFERENT BEFORE &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THEN WILL I TEACH GRAND transgressors &gt;&gt; thy ways &gt;&gt; and sinners shall be converted unto me. See, David was was teaching from uh a place of uh iron fist, I would say. &gt;&gt; But then he begin to carry the mercies of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he be to understand the grace of God. THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE UH UH UH brothers and sisters, friends that truly hurt you, &gt;&gt; pray for one another. &gt;&gt; God is in the plan. &gt;&gt; God is in the plan. PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND THAT PERSON AND just let them know that you love them and you forgive them. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO. GO AFTER him &gt;&gt; exactly right. &gt;&gt; And show love &gt;&gt; and show love to that one. &gt;&gt; We look at the Hebrew boys. Amen. In Daniel there, they had fallen into a situation. Amen. Where uh they were under great trial. under great trial. Amen. But after you come out of that trial, amen, if you uh uh stay with the things of God, then you become a witness for him. Then he uses you, amen, as a great tool for what he's doing. But you have to be tested &gt;&gt; understanding that. Now remember the Bible said all we like sheep. There's none of us that are that that that that get a pass on being tested. &gt;&gt; None of us. If one offends you, go to them. They may not receive you right away, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT? You pray for them. &gt;&gt; You pray for them. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to just share Amen. A quick testimony. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; A personal testimony. &gt;&gt; There was a situation. Amen. in my life. That was a great a great trial, a great test. And you know what? I CAN'T SAY THAT I HANDLED IT ALL THAT WELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But God, who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; came after me. &gt;&gt; Came after me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my bones were broken. hurt. That's why I read it here in in in in this in the in uh the message that he says friends may forsake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Family may turn their back on you and even your pastor. Let me tell you something. Don't lift up anybody too high. &gt;&gt; I'm all for appreciations. &gt;&gt; No problem with them. Careful not to step across the line. You see, because what happens is I remember when I was freshly coming back, coming back to the fold. See, I was that lost sheep. And uh I'm at the church there and the ministers asked for all of the pastors and to stand and the ministers to stand and they sung a song, you know, just you know, heaping praise upon them and and and and I cringed. I cringed, Lord, wait a minute. Because when you do that, you put a target on that man's back. See, I've been through some things. And recently I was sharing with someone on some of the things that I had been through being a young deacon and had to do some things that were was was I just didn't think I would ever have to do in my life. And um I realized how it affected me. Realized how it affected me. And it wasn't until that moment because we there were two of us, two deacons. And we had to handle some very difficult a very difficult situation cuz you see at that time uh I believe spiritual growth had be to set in. We we were we were a church that were was much like THIS WHEN WE WERE DOING THINGS. We were on fire, traveling, going from church to church. We were having such a great time. But something came along out of left field that I didn't see coming whatsoever and knocked me off center. &gt;&gt; Knocked me completely as uh Paul off my horse &gt;&gt; and I I I couldn't handle it. I began I began to like that sheep lost just lost. I I I tell you I just lost because of a situation. God is my witness. I tried but so deeply wounded. just lost my way. And the other deacon that was there with me at the time hung in there. I was safe for as long as he could. But it wasn't until I was sharing the story that I realized that he was affected as well. No longer in the message. It it it it cheapened the message in his eye in in his eyes &gt;&gt; that how should I say allowed him to eventually go astray, &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY HIM, MANY PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Though I say that to say this, pray for your pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray for these ministers. &gt;&gt; Because there is a target &gt;&gt; on your back. &gt;&gt; In any war, the enemy wants to take out the leaders &gt;&gt; and scatter the flock. Yeah. &gt;&gt; SO EVEN AMONGST YOU, YOUR friends and your family, THE DEVIL HAS NO, HE DON'T FIGHT FAIR. &gt;&gt; He will use even your spouse &gt;&gt; TO CAUSE GREAT HURT, &gt;&gt; GREAT PAIN. THAT YOU will go astray. I'M OFTEN REMINDED THAT HE'LL USE ANYTHING THAT SOMETIME MOST OF THE TIME YOU ARE NOT THE TARGET. &gt;&gt; IT'S the one that's watching you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TARGET. BUT IF HE CAN TAKE AND WOUND YOU WITH SOMETHING &gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T HANDLE IT CORRECTLY &gt;&gt; AND YOU GOT EVERY EXCUSE NOT TO HANDLE IT CORRECTLY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HURT TRULY HURT &gt;&gt; AND I CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR DOING AND YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT THERE'S OTHERS WATCHING YOU. You're just a tool &gt;&gt; in the devil's grip &gt;&gt; to get the one &gt;&gt; that's watching you. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHEN GOD HE COMES AND HE GETS THAT sheep and HE BREAKS HIS LEG. AMEN. And it seems so cruel. But on the other side of that is a sweet victory. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU become closer. HE SAYS, "THEN CAN I TEACH THE PEOPLE THY WAYS. Once you've been healed, once you've sat there in the bosom of that shepherd, &gt;&gt; and after you've been, Amen. healed and able to go back to the flock, YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER ONE IN THE flock and say, "I recognize what you're going through." &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't eat that grass. Yes, &gt;&gt; I ate that grass and oh, he had to come get me. &gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU CAN TEACH THE OTHERS IN THE FLOCK. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Of his tender mercies. &gt;&gt; See, we all go through things. &gt;&gt; All of us. Every last one of us. are the sheep of his pasture. &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we must all go through the test and the trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In question and answers, the prophet explains to us, backsliding is not lost. I want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost. And prove it to me. Prove it to the Bible. Backsliders are not lost. &gt;&gt; He's just out of fellowship. &gt;&gt; They lost their praise, their joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. David said, "The joy of his salvation, &gt;&gt; restore unto me the joy of his salvation, and renew a right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord." Amen. See, but sometime we look at it from a human perspective. and say that person is lost. &gt;&gt; That person is not lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because see, God is in hot pursuit of some people right now. &gt;&gt; In hot pursuit. &gt;&gt; And see when when when when when you one of them quiet pursuits, he going in quiet. Sirens ain't blaring. &gt;&gt; But he in hot pursuit. &gt;&gt; You ever been in hot pursuit and then you got apprehended? &gt;&gt; I have. &gt;&gt; See, I didn't know I He was in hot pursuit. &gt;&gt; But one day my wife said, "Let's go to church." &gt;&gt; He was in hot pursuit. &gt;&gt; And I just said, "Oh, uh, I got this to do and I got that to do." Amen. I was running &gt;&gt; from the pursuit. &gt;&gt; But when he's in hot pursuit, &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's not just him. Amen. He have other deputies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the old saying, you can't outrun that radio. &gt;&gt; He had that helicopter &gt;&gt; watching from a high. I know where you're at, brother. You can't hide. &gt;&gt; So, I try to go into the bar, whatever, and hide. No, you can't hide there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We He's in hot pursuit. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, something began to click on the inside. &gt;&gt; Lost wounded sheep. But when the Lord, amen, uh, found me, amen, and got to me and apprehended me, threw me upon his shoulders, amen, and brought me back to the fold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Immediately something began to feel familiar. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I can just get him in a familiar surroundings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I could nurse him back to health. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE LORD GOT ME IN familiar surroundings. Amen. And I I I began to sit there. And at first, AMEN. I WAS STILL WOUNDED. AMEN. SO, I couldn't move as much, &gt;&gt; man. I sat there. Amen. Uh, like a lump on the Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't have a whole lot of praise in me. &gt;&gt; So, I just sat there. Amen. And and let the Lord heal my broken bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. And after a while, Amen. the healing be to take place. And I begin to pat my feet. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember when I used to pat my feet? &gt;&gt; Amen. I wasn't jumping yet. I wasn't shot. All I could do is pat my feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT AFTER A WHILE, AMEN. the bones begin to heal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened is I begin to feel better. Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, cuz when your bones are broken, you you you you're not feeling just yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU DON'T YOU STILL DON'T HAVE THAT SAME joy that you used to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I began to feel healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah, I said, is like fire &gt;&gt; shut up in my bones. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL MIND IF I PREACH this morning? Amen. And after a while, amen, I got enough strength &gt;&gt; JUST TO STAND UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN I STOOD UP, &gt;&gt; AMEN. I be to feel a little more familiar. &gt;&gt; THAT ALMIGHTY, THIS FEELS PRETTY GOOD. &gt;&gt; BUT THE DEVIL CAME AND SAID, "THEY LOOKING AT YOU. LET THEM look on because I feel STRENGTH &gt;&gt; IN MY BONES. &gt;&gt; AMEN.
