amen turkey I put you to sleep you know that right hopefully it done what off a little bit in y'all y'all ready to praise the Lord Amen I appreciate all the specials that went forth Oh Caprice didn't see you got bless you good to see you and your precious daughter like God man Sharmila back in the house there we've been attacking her body amen thank God for that says Jimmy when the family god bless you amen good to see you all a man we just thank God for all things he's a good good father a man my god y'all turn with me we have been I've taken a journey through first John to here and we hopefully bring some closure to our thought today while we're getting first John to a man I also just wanted to make mention that um you all were made aware of brother Charlie Torres who passed away there in Tennessee very precious asain of God a man a prisoner of war and he actually passed on Veterans Day amen I think that was a you know just a testimony a mentor who he who he was not only a soldier in the United States Army but also a soldier in the army of the Lord and we thank God God gave him 96 years 96 years and he was very healthy for most of those years if he would have walked into this church on fire like he always was she wouldn't have been you wouldn't be able to tell he was 96 years old Amen but he just loved the Lord and what we we weren't able to make the service but for his home going but we did get a card that we wanted to send to his wife and just to encourage her and we'll have the card outside for you at the service if you would just sign and just send her you know just some well wishes let her know that you're praying for her through this time and a man we want to continue to keep that family in our prayers amen here in 1st John chapter 2 verse 15 we started with this a man a few weeks ago and will go further in this thought today but the Bible a man tells us love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and I want to go further we were stopping there for the last two weeks and we just kind of dwelt on that but let's go a little further into what John is trying to speak to us he says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father all right so the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world okay and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated a man you all join us amen we are under we are a faith as being a man elevated to believe God for a new church in a new school and y'all y'all join us not God God is in the miracle-working business is that right a man and I always kind of share this a man we you know we are in here a plaza where a lot of churches are together and one of the things about you know being down here in the corner if you had a business it's not many people that would find your business in the corner so most businesses shut down you know here in the corner but churches seem to survive right and so so what happens this is a landlord he'd like to put them all together and then our services bleed over into one another and you know we just got to deal with it but you know I've learned that I rather have I'd rather deal with a church then deal with a club right so there's some things you can just be thankful for a man so you all just be praying with us we believe in God and a man he's at work right now behind the scenes even right now while we talk and he's at work so a man we're relieving God so it meant just saw just bear with us we want to Amen use from our subject again today love not the world a man love not the world we are looking at a couple things here you know here John is telling us to love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and and when we when we think about this scripture and we compare it to some of the other scriptures especially John 3:16 because John 3:16 tells us for God so loved the world a man that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now when we look at a man first john 2:15 with john 3:16 we can almost see that there is somewhat of a conflict in these scriptures because we're being told to love not the world but then we're told that god loves the world well in order to get clarification on that we need to go further in scripture and this is where we go to hebrews 1 and verse 2 where it says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's he made the world so a man when we look at that now we see that there is there's more than just one world that we're dealing with and if i could just you know just just let you know you're living in more than just one world you know your your cell phone is operating in a different world than what you're operating in hallelujah amen so here there's also colossians 1:16 that tells us for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible and invisible so there's a visible world which you see right now but there's also an invisible world right he said whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things are created by him and for him so we want to kind understand here that there are multiple worlds there's an invisible world there's a visible world a man and even in the in the invisible world there's angels that dwell there there's also demons amen that dwell in that invisible world and oftentimes we might not realize it but we're being pulled from one world or the other we're either been pulled from heaven or we're being pulled from hell and all that's happened is we're seeing a manifestation of either one of those worlds manifested in the world in which we live right now where we have these five senses a man seat a seer smell and all of that you know we're we're being controlled by those processes we're living in that world but there are other worlds all around us and God made all of them hallelujah God made the devil a man God made the devil now I need y'all to understand something bout the devil the devil is not equal to God never ever never never never think that he's not equal because he was made by God and he had a purpose for being made by God right amen but but God made the devil God made the angels God made you God made me God made all of these worlds and God gets glory from all of it Oh hallelujah hallelujah so you know where we're talking about so when we talk about love not the world we got to understand which one to talk about the world that God loves is the one that you're dwelling in Amen that's the one that he died for hallelujah Amen but there there's a there's a world even even if I if I can also put it this way there's a church world that God loves and one that God don't like if the Bible actually speaks it Amen over there in the book of Revelation say he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church s not just one church but church s so there's a false church and there's a true church and they both say they worship God and one God loves and one God hates it's right there in the scripture right so you know we don't try to go a little deeper Amen here today because if there's a world that we're not supposed to love amen and that's what John is telling us though and when we see the influence of some of the things of the world then we know which world God don't love because that world will never be converted hallelujah but you you have the opportunity to be converted that's why God loves you in the word that you living in God loves dance but there's another word that he don't love and he's telling us to avoid that with everything we can now let's go a little deeper here I want to just kind of I'm gonna just jump right in if y'all don't mind this this world amen this word world has multiple definitions and one of the definition is an apt and harmonious agreement or Constitution order government and you know what we find there's oftentimes in in the church world we have the government and oh my help us lord that the government that you see in church world it produces a political system oh my it produces a political system that God is not in favor of right because politics rule not the Spirit of God Oh y'all they're gonna talk to me today but it's a truth in it hi there oftentimes a man in the church world politics will rule not God's Spirit amen when God wants to lead his people God wants to do something a different no no no we got that thing program where politics can rule and God don't like that I'm gonna let you know that's all in scripture we can go through it but but but that when you look at this definition an act in harmonious arrangement or Constitution order or government Amen we see that worldly system in church in God hates them alright another another another definition is the ungodly multitude so when it says love not the world we're not supposed we're not supposed to a man feel comfortable hanging with an ungodly multitude come on somebody people that you know ain't gonna accept your Jesus they don't tell you they don't want your Jesus and you're still trying to hang with them won't you wait to God changed a heart before you go hang with them but but we're not supposed to wanna hang with an ungodly multitude also says the whole mass of me and alienated from God and therefore hostile to the cause of Christ you got somebody like that in your life that's hostile to the cause of Christ you're supposed to let them go amen praise the Lord Amen I'm gonna tell you something when you spend so much time you up here trying to and somebody else down there and you're pulling trying to lift them up do you realize just based on the position that they're in they can actually pull you down fast and you can pull them up a man so you can't hang with everybody right you came fellowship with everybody it just bottom line because those people are designed by Satan to actually pull you down you can't love the world or the things other world otherwise the love of God is not in you can we go further all right so this last definition is the one that we really want to dwell up with dwell on today it's the world affairs all right the aggregate of things earthly the whole circle of earthly goods endowments riches advantages pleasures etc which although hollow and frail and fleeting they stir desire to seduce you from God and our obstacles to the cause of Christ now let's look at this a little deeper if we can because here's what in first John to a man again verse 15 16 17 let's read it again love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and then John goes a little further says for all that is in the world amen the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world now let's just try to see if we can dig in there a little deeper amen on this lust of the flesh lust of the eye amen in the pride of life now I just went to a commentary here Matthew Henry commentary I got some definitions that I want to bring to you before we go further and he says this this lust of the flesh the flesh here being distinguished from the eyes and the life imports the body say the lust of the flesh is subjectively the humour and appetite of indulging in fleshly pleasures amen objectively all those things that excite and inflame the pleasure of the flesh this lust is usually called luxury alright so what we're looking at here is this lust of the flesh it's physical desire amen we and I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to talk about that a man today because uh you know we we you know people don't realize it but they don't they're falling to the lust of the flesh quite often you know stuff that we see on TV annoying still lust of the flesh can I also say some of the music that we choose to listen to it annoys the lust of the flesh your flesh begin to long for stuff that it's not supposed to have hallelujah a man you marry what you listen for somebody else for huh that but but but you don't realize it there's an anointing coming from another world that's why you can't talk with everybody I remember you know uh you know years ago my wife had a friend that that she was you know they were real good friends but you know when my wife got married and you know she was thinking about married things and and and this one friend and this one friend got married but but you know her her conversation was like well you know what I know my husband is cheating so i'ma start cheating right and and you know I know he doing this so i'ma do that right not now if my wife kept entertaining that type of conversation what type of anointing do you think she would have received she would have start doubting me well if her husband cheating all men are dogs that's what they say Oh y'all they gonna talk to me today right but all I'm in a dog so now you get this anointing on you and you marry and now you listening out for somebody else it's flesh and realize when you start doing that the love of God is not in you hey I got to make it plain y'all just forgive me for being a plain preacher you know I was just wondering you know what kind of doctor would you won't write what you want a doctor that you know you're going to tell them say man I got some stomach pain I don't know where this come from I mean I've been dealing with this for days it's been on a while before I could get in here to the office and I got this stomach pain and you walk in tell them all you know you probably say he'd go to aspirin take him and call me in the morning now I'm gonna tell you something you had a doctor like that you would not be returning back to that doctor right I mean because he's not really diagnosing the issue right he not he not working for anything to aspirin and sent me away so no no no I'm not going back so if you wouldn't want a doctor like that why play with preachers get yourself a preacher that's going to tell you the truth not one that's gonna tickle your ears hey hey look look there's a time for singing and there's a time for preaching hallelujah amen if you want me to sing come before service but when it's time to preach is time to preach and we're going to deal with the wine of God when it's time to preach come on somebody hallelujah not now listen you know that this distance thing is this lust of the flesh it's dealing with physical pleasure another definition when I talk about the lust of the eyes and say the eyes delighted with treasures riches and rich possessions the eyes are delighted with treasures riches and rich possession are craved by an extravagant eye this is the lust of covetousness all right so so oftentimes when we get from to the lust of the eye and this happens all the time when people fall subject to this amen they put they job before God right they put they put making money before God look if God wanted you to have it he can just bless you with it Oh hallelujah you can tell when people fall subject to the lust of the flesh you can tell when people fall subject to the lust of the eye because the first thing a man weight where the first thing that if that is impacted by it is their attendance in church you know exactly when they've been affected by this the lust of the flesh will stop people from coming to church when people fall in sin when they're living in sin they won't come to church y'all are gonna talk to me huh and then when they're if they're not from the same but but maybe they got an appetite for for craving to be rich ain't no you know look look I'm not I'm not preaching against money money answereth all things but what the problem is the love of money see money not Eve it's the love of money it's how you go about getting it when you got a sacrifice got to get the money you got a problem hallelujah actually money has become your gods hallelujah and what the word says that you can't serve God and Mammon you can't serve God and money at the same time all right I'm going a little further don't worry I'm just giving you some highlights right now we'll get deep in this and we'll show you that not as other than the pride of life look at this it's a vain mind that craves all the grandeur equip it and throw and pump a vainglorious life now you know I like this you know I don't care what you accomplish in this life when you leave you will be forgotten it's only a few people that's going to remember you they sitting next to you right now but in the in this world's way ain't nobody I don't care what your job in this place is today die and see what happens they will quickly replace you actually they got somebody waiting right now they waiting for you to trip up somebody got somebody in the wings waiting to replace you and you're giving all your life for that God don't want you to do that give all your life to him and let him use you for his glory I don't care how much money you earn to come the company they don't forget about you once you die hallelujah amen it might we might as well just be honest so that's why you can't love the world of the things of the world and so so here this this proud of life is a vain mind that craves all the grandeur equip each pop of a vainglorious life this is ambitious a man this is this is ambition and the thirst after honor and admiration and praise do you know you know that that some people just cannot can not a man get off the stage even when they retire they have a hard time letting go to stage people want to be in a place where their name is always being called in the public eye can I just I'm gonna just call his name Dennis Rodman couldn't stay out of trouble if you all know who he is a basketball player since he couldn't play basketball no more he kept getting in trouble in the things just to get his name in the public eye hallelujah and some people don't realize that's the pride of life and you're not supposed to desire that when you desire that it shows that the love of God is not there you won't you won't vainglory let God lift you up hallelujah look at this I'm gonna say this is this that they call this this proud of life it's a thirst after honor and applause this in part is the disease of the ear the private life they call it the disease of the ear you're just you love hearing people call your name you love people you mean yeah I mean they said this about me they said that about and you just longed for more and more of it it's the pride of life that got you hallelujah when I go to church I get repute but when I get out here amongst ten people they just love me they don't know you I might as well just say it let's say saying say it's the ISTE it's the disease of the ear it must be flattered with admiration and praise see the object of these appetites must be abandoned and renounce as they engage the engrossed affection and desire they are not of the Father but of the world see the father this allows them and the world should keep them to itself the lustre appetite to these things must be mortified and subdued I'm giving you matthew Henry's comments and then they must be modified and subdued so the indulging of it is not appointed by the father but it's insinuated by the ensnaring world so when we start looking at this remember torian's the world visible in a world invisible sometimes Satan wants to anoint you to do things right amen to get you going down a direction that's actually gonna pull you further from God let's kind of look at this a little bit further I want to go deeper in this this is gonna come out of laodicean church age a little quote that I want to read a man I'm gonna show you a man a little bit how Eve was affected by this this lust of the flesh lust of the eye a man in pride of life how she failed there but then I also want to show you how Jesus was also impacted by it but he overcame listen let us see in church age paragraph 360 says this a quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition and Matthew form will go there shortly in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word a man and by the word only if you're going to overcome the devil in this hour it's going to be by the word and by the word only your song not gonna get it you're gonna need you're gonna need a revelation of the Word of God listen by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that correspond it exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the proud of life Jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fair and direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word I want to say it again Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this that this is the only way to be an overcomer it is the only way you can know if you're overcoming because the word can't fail I want to read this about Eva said that um that she she she fell here in this area of lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life now let's look at let's look at Eve let's go to Genesis chapter 3 let's go here to Genesis chapter 3 I want you all to look at this now I made a statement last week and I'm gonna have to go back and say this again first of all a man we have a issue here where when we look at just what happened in the book of Genesis the churches are divided over this even today right even today people have no idea what happened in the Garden of Eden and we've been going to church all our life and we still don't know what happened in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of the Bible now if we can't get the beginning of the Bible right how we gonna end up right at the end I just need to ask that question right we got to ask Christians we got to get something that solidifies what happened in the Garden of Eden now now everybody know Eve got pregnant everybody know that she had she had she had two boys one by the name of Cain one by the name of name of Abel right so we know that there was pregnancy that took place there was no fruit that any woman can eat that will allow her to get pregnant we might as well be honest right there is no fruit that a woman can eat if it if it exists why aren't women eating the same fruit today and having babies huh there's only one way we know that women get pregnant y'all gonna talk to me it's only one way we know hallelujah right Amen so what would the same way that women get pregnant today is the same way Eve got pregnant in the beginning however we have a we have a problem here because as we go further into Genesis will notice them something happens and you probably read it in Scripture why are there two lineages listed huh you start looking at the lineage of adamant and in this son and that son then you also start seeing a lineage of Cain evidently Adam was not Cain's daddy and not only that the Bible clearly says that Adam I mean that Cain worse of that wicked one so Cain's daddy was different than Adam however his mama was Eve alright so so so what we see here is Eve had a relationship with somebody in the garden outside of Adam and according to the Bible it was with the serpent now most people say you talk about a snake on the ground no I'm not talking about a snake on the ground I'm talk about a snake that stood on two feet before he went to the ground because he got cursed and widowhood on his belly so before the curse he stood on two feet talk like a man walk like a man acted like a man to have a conversation with even Eve not realizing that it was not the serpent talking to her but the serpent had been anointed by the devil oh you don't believe the devil go into animals ax leads him when he got delivered where did the devil's go pekes the devil will ignore an animal yes he will hallelujah God could also ignore an animal who talked to Balaam God anointed mule to talk right amen see I mean so so so so don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't get caught up in like God don't use that no no no no no animals can be used by God animals can be used by the devil hallelujah can I tell you also something you can be used by God or you can be used by the devil let's look at this because we're looking at these three these three things just lust of the flesh this lust of the eyes pride of life remember I share with y'all for the past couple weeks I Eve took a peep at the world this is her peep at the world now you know I want you understand her little peep when the Bible say love not the world Eve took a peep at the world and just a little peep at the world not the stuff that you know that we might deal with the day but one of the things that we don't talk about the day people do deal with this this less than a flesh everybody deal with this hallelujah let's look at this verse verse five amen amen now I just gave you a summarized version if you don't believe what I just said you have to go read the whole chapter Genesis 3 and then ask God to reveal to you between the lines what happened because now when God was dishing out punishment he call Adam he caught Eve and he called the serpent he did not call any other animal so the serpent had something to do with this great fall praise the Lord God wasn't just picking on the serpent and when he acts Eve what happened to her what did she say the serpent beguiled me that mean tricked me was talking with me see that's why I say you gotta watch you talk of it because though sometimes people are norther by the devil do you realize Peter was with Jesus slept with Jesus walk with Jesus talk with Jesus but that kind of time he had a minor revelation of who Jesus was then he got anointed by the devil and Jesus had to tell Peter get thee behind me Satan they weren't talking to Peter he was talking to the devil that was talking to Peter alright let's go on a little further here we are in verse 5 in Genesis 3 for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil verse 6 says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food so now when she saw that the tree was good for food this is where it was a breakdown in the lust of the flesh because she saw that means she partook of something and she saw that it was good for food oh my god y'all gonna make me get real deep in here today a man a man I got another scripture for y'all because y'all think I'm maybe I give that to you right now before I go a little further hold that scripture I'm coming back there so I want y'all to understand cuz you know you're looking at tree and you thinkin see it's a physical tree no no no no no know that you got these allegories you got to be able to read between the lines now I'm gonna show you how a man let's read proverbs 30 and 20 and I'm gonna try to get back on my subject here proverbs 30 and 20 and then I will go back to Genesis praise God you know and I find it amazing how a Solomon even picked up on this he says such as the way of an adulterous woman this is the woman that commits adultery and look at his analogy that he uses such as a way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipe with her mouth now what is adultery and eating got to do with each other amen she eateth and wipe with her mouth and says I have done no wickedness now Solomon brings both of these together so now we can tie what happened in the garden of eatin with Eve when we talk about eating from the feet of a tree but it wasn't just no physical tree this was an adultery that took place in the god of eating that caused her to get pregnant pregnant remove from the serpent all right let me go on Genesis 3 now we want to pick up here because she failed for the lust of the flesh this is what happened in the Garden of Eden Eve fell for the lust of the flesh she failed for the lust of the eye and she fell with the pride of life look at this now verse 6 says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that's lust of the flesh she fell right there amen and that it was pleasant to the eyes lust of the eyes right there she fell all right and a tree to be desired to make one wise proud of life popularity self-interest right not now she was already and notice how the devil sorta sold her a lie and said that she would be like God she was already like God she was made in His image the devil actually Amen twisted the Word of God on her oh my and she fell for this lie and when she fell she took a peep at the world oh I wish you took a people in the world now we got to go to funerals now we got to go to the hospital because Eve took a people in the world now but don't part your finger eat because many of us in the same situation we have took the same peep at the world and we're not compromised with the things have gone alright let me go on a little further look at this when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also a husband with her and he did eat now if we could just be so bold you know when they fail here when they got in trouble they Eve Eve was the one that actually fell first and noticed when she failed she let her husband write off into the same thing Adam did it willfully according to the Bible Adam did it willfully now but she led her husband off into this distance this thing now I wanted I want to just in full warn the sisters when you've fallen for lust of the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life amen be careful don't put your husband in a situation where he got to choose God over you i'ma say it again sisters don't put yourself in a situation where you have to make your husband choose God over you because if you got a real husband I can already tell you you've lost and i'ma tell you if you got a husband that loved you more than he loved God you got the wrong man you got the wrong man you want a man that love God more than he loved you and manna to tell you when you're wrong Adam should've told if she was wrong but Adam did this as a tight Adam Whitley did this because by Adam willfully going out to a man he knew when God came down he was gonna take Eve out right but he said I'm gonna go out with her is the same way at God himself leaving his throne and glory to come down to earth to redeem fallen man it was a willing act all right so we can see here in Scripture Eve fell with the lust of the flesh she fell with the lust of the eye and she fell with the pride of life now I now look at this verse 7 this is why I say when people fall in this place look at this that the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked now we know you know they eat no Apple and recognize was naked come on y'all if we know something deeper half in there this was adultery all right adultery and say say at the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together me and made themselves aprons now look at this verse verse 8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord got called in to Adam and said unto Him where art thou now this why I say when people fall to lust of the flesh lust of the eye proud of life what happens it's church attendance is the first thing that's impacted because when God God used to come down and even the cool of the evening every day and they were half Church he would have Church with Adam and Eve but this day he came to church and God was the only one in church and so he had the cost and notice now here's a couple things I need you to notice here he did not say Eve Eve where art thou he called for Adam you want to know why I come for Adam because Adam was held responsible for what happened in the Garden of Eden hallelujah and husbands I want to tell you something you are here responsible for what happens within your family praise the Lord somebody a man so when God came down he looked for Adam where I found Adam was hiding behind the trees it wasn't that God didn't know where Adam was God knows all things he knew exactly where Adam was but he needed Adam to realize look when you've messed up don't run from me can I tell you something that if you messed up don't run from God run to God hallelujah let me go on a little further a man I'm telling you love not the world Eve took a peep at the world and it caused all the problems that we have today and i'ma tell you when you start people that the world is gonna cause problems in your life as well a man let me go on a little further here now in that quote that we were just reading there out of latest in church age age he said and each of the three major trials that correspondent exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the proud of life Jesus overcame by the word now remember lust of the flesh is when we fall into physical desires and let me just kind of inject this this is out of first Corinthians 6 I knew I had to read this today this scripture because this is a lust of the flesh now I know it's not really said much in church no more a man but fornication is still against God's Word it ain't change fornication adultery all that is against God's Word praise the Lord and when you fall into fornication you fall into the lust of the flesh and it's telling you the love of God is not in you you cannot use the excuse God understands and you you you if you're if you're going out on your marriage vow you made it you made a commitment not only to God you made a commitment to your spouse that you're going to keep yourself if you're going out of your marriage vows you need to make things right hello somebody God came blessed over your mess God came bless the people at home my god that's what that's why you got this like your blessing back got a hole in the bottom of it you got to make some things right even the Prophet taught us that you know this one sister committed adultery on her husband and she thought when I told that to the Lord I'd made it right with God said sister you didn't you didn't just you didn't just do that to your husband you did that to your army to God you did that to your husband you need to make things right with your husband as well as with God she said where our God already forgave his sister the reason you dealing with the things you do it because you have not made things right with your husband he's saying I go and get that thing right and she said they're like I can't do it he gotta leave me God has already left you and she was a Sunday school teacher didn't realize God had already left it that's why she's being tormented by a devil or I might as well say these things summary the reason that we're not able to get free from some of the stuff that's going on like we haven't made things right we need to go back and make things right hallelujah you got to go confess that amen the truth in there the one who sat there that gesture session said no I can't do it I can't do it brother branham I can't go she say he say it sister you need to go do it that's the only way you're gonna get free from this demon that's that's tormenting you this nervous condition that you got that's the only way you gonna get free she said just I can't do it he say oh by the way your husband got the same thing that confession not my husband he's a deacon in the church accidents where the problems be in most churches you go to somebody's denominational churches Oh help us Lord the Deacons have problems deacons and preacher got problems taking advantage of people and I'm by the truth in a high right but but you know so so you know because people use their position of influence their status to take advantage of other folk you want to hold it ghost filled Church where folk came doing that kind of stuff amen call out here amen we want a church we're seeing a hot all right all right I'm going further don't worry so y'all don't cut me on a third end of this a man I had to get it all out my spirit it's part three but I have I just got it I got a release on it this how we keep the church clean amen all right but she said he say he says you'll be honest we got the same thing of confessors not my husband here Deacon sister y'all go and talk about this thing cuz your husband got the same thing to confess you know you make it right widow she went got a husband to the sides you know honey I need to tell you I did this I did that he just Oh what you did what I can't believe it and she just let him get all huffy and puffy and then she say now honey I need to tell you something you know brother branham told me that you got the same name confessed to me what I ain't got nothing to confess to you he said you was with a woman in a car just the other day at such and such a place and he knew it wasn't none but God that could reveal something like that they say oh yeah that's the truth honey I got something to confess to you too the turn around so we going through the prophets house because we gonna resign from our position and we're gonna sit down and get right with God and they went they went to tell the Prophet what they was getting ready doing brother whatever you do don't resign from your position say say you keep on being a deacon and you keep on being a sunday-school teacher just make things right with God and go on and don't live like that no more say God don't hold it over you when you repent but what prop what the problem is people don't want to repent we ain't sweeping this under the rug we dealing with it you got to go make things right you ain't gonna be blessed until you make things right now I don't watch folk make things right and I watch god bless them now watch other people just under curse all the time because they made things right let's go over here first Corinthians a man this this lust of the flesh we all deal with it first Corinthians chapter 6 look at verse 12 let's just read this y'all bear with me in a day glory to God it says in all all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any right meats for the belly and the belly for meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for and I don't only one is that though is that only in my Bible now I know I know they got all these new Bibles out nowadays they taking these words I so people don't feel offended but I'm going back to the King James Version we're not we're not taking it out we gotta live it the way it's written right he said but now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord's all right and the Lord for the body let's keep up somebody say read and God had both raised up the Lord and will also raise up raise up us by his own power know ye not that our bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot Oh let it go that go pretty deep because they got multiple meanings you realize the Catholic Church is known as the great amen a denominational group known as the great but she gave birth to children and every child that come for underneath that system is known as a harlot that's why you can't go fellowship and everywhere you got to stay true to the Word of God let me go a little further it said the members of the harlot God for beings it said what no you're not that he was just drawn to a harlot is one body for two staff he shall be one flesh let's go on but he that is joined until the lord is one spirit now look at what verse 18 tell you to do now this does this mean this first first first you got a commandment a man from from Paul Lee that being run from it that's why you can't you know if this fella acting like the devil whispering sweet nothings he made you smile like that you know that's that's a spirit coming from the underworld that's the spirit coming from the underworld or pull you down God got an anointed ever come from the pulpit to pull you back up right but but a fornication is something that you don't play around with if you've been Amen have you been guilty of this and I'm not trying to bring this message to bring condemnation I'm not doing that but when I am trying to tell you that we got it we got it we cannot love the world all the things of the world and say that we love God and don't work that way if you love God you gotta obey his word God you understand I just I just be struggling how long you been struggling how long you want to keep struggling can I can I just be honest with you some of us worship the devil's that's got us bound we worship gossip we worship lust we worship these things I mean now you you you are and I don't get me wrong I know sometimes you can get an honor with a spirit but every time you get a Church you ought to be trying to get free from that thing you ought to be trying to get free not not not in the world Lord understand and you know we just keep you got to make things right and that's why we used to go to the altar to get get our hearts right with God now we just you know and you know you're wrong everybody else know you're wrong but you ain't gonna say nothing all right flee fornication I'm going on every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth again his against his own body can I go further what no you're not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you now you claim to be feel the Holy Spirit but you out here come in fornication something wrong with you ain't give me a man's on this one I know it Lord delights to save man to it it's the truth anyhow say what know ye not that your body is the temple Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have what which you have of God and ye are not your own little further four-year boat with a price therefore glorify God in your body so you got overcoming lust of the flesh glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods your body belongs to God and your spirit belongs to God and what what the Bible tells us to do is glorify God in our bodies and in our spirits we have to overcome the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life amen and and the only way you're gonna overcome is by using the word now you know when the devil talking that when that text come that come from that other dimension and you sit there you read it you know something you know that thing that was the devil and all and you know how you know what you got to do is ignore it don't be responding back with no smiley faces praise the Lord somebody when you tell them to devil no you gotta mean no all right Jesus overcame by the word can I show you that in Matthew 4 let's just read this yeah I'll bear with me because in that quote we found out that this is how Jesus overcame now that now Satan trick Eve and she fell a mental lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life she failed to all of this but Jesus overcame these three things with the Word of God if he overcame physical desire he overcame personal desire and he also overcame self interest or what we call popularity praise the Lord that's that's some time that's a that's a devil that makes us want to be popular you know when we it's one thing when God makes you popular but it's another thing were you trying to put yourself all out there aid man church say I mean you know it's some crazy things that have people become popular do some real demonic things to become popular God don't want you to do it that way if God wanted you to to have all these follows here give them to you amen praise the Lord I told you if you start giving the word they won't follow you anyway Amen hallelujah glory to God father I thank you for your word now Ken let's read here in Matthew 4 let's read this now I want you to just kind of catch some things here let's start at verse 3 in Matthew 4 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now now when here we hear when Satan was trying to tip the tip the Lord Jesus he was actually trying to get him to fall here a man in the lust of the flesh he was hungry a man so he was trying to get him to fall in this area and now Jesus overcame by the word now the Prophet tells us something here he says Satan came and this isn't a message how can I overcome but don't worry about pulling this one up he says Satan came and he wanted him to use his own power on his self to feed him wanted to feed himself he was hungry a man when a man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal Rob beg borrow anything see and he had that appetite and Satan used his first great major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome with and use it on himself he didn't use it on himself no he used it on others that's right he used it on another time himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it but see he would have failed if he would have done it then who would fail to lust of the flesh and that's all Satan was trying to do is get him to use his power on himself here here the tempter came said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread so now you know your hunger you just come up with fast do this use this power and stuff he would have failed at lust of the flesh right there the way Jesus overcame and lust of the flesh as he took the devil back to the word in verse 4 he says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he overcame the devil in the lusts of the flesh by using the word then let's go on a little further here notice this next verse verse verse five and I want to tell you something it watch watch how this works because you might overcome the devil in one area of your life he coming back he coming back I remember my past used to say you know you it's like going to a baseball game and here comes the devil saying popcorn popcorn popcorn now I don't really want no popcorn they come back ice cream ice cream ice cream no I don't really want to ice cream soda soda soda I really don't want no soda they never say something hot dog hot dog hot dog lady wait a minute hot dog sounding pretty good but you don't realize that once you get the hot dog you're gonna need the soda or if you got the popcorn your throat gonna get dry you're gonna need the soda so they'd ever know how to keep coming with most stuff for you a man church now watching me in verse verse 5 now Jesus defeated him with the word and I look at him in verse 5 then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pen of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone now wait a minute wait a minute if I just caught that correctly the devil use the word on Jesus don't let that devil do that do you like what the devil were trying to treat now he used the word on Eve now he's using the word on Jesus and that's let me tell you something if you don't know the word you'll be tricked by the word i'ma say it again if you don't know the word you will be tricked by the word look at this cuz because this is this is what you know verse 7 says didn't Jesus say to him it is written again so you got to be able to go toe to toe with this devil yea yea yea it is written that he'll he'll give his anus child to me but also it is written again thou should not tell the LORD thy God let's see what the Prophet said about this particular passage he said that our Satan was actually trying to get Jesus glory to God amen he was he was tempting him to be a show-off see that's where that luster the lust of the eye come in right and even pride of life kind of coming that same thing when people trying to be a show-off rather than just letting God actually exalt you oftentimes we try to exalt ourselves that's what lust of the eye does amen we see somebody else got a whole bunch of followers we try to get we try to meet meet they status not allowing God to exalt you right Amen you doing all this in your own Amen I can do this and I can do that don't forget you ain't got nowhere without God even where you are right now it's because a God puts you there hallelujah Church hallelujah but oftentimes we forget about God we think our success came from something that we did I went to school I did this I know you didn't God gave you the ability God I'm none of your mind you forgot you pray through some tests you forgot you actually got to help you with that huh and now you don't made it not a list that I got you and now you're going after you're going after look I mean when we look at this amen or order proud of life either one you can kind of fit in there here brother brems say if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this temple and jump off see I'll give you a scripture for it because it's written he gave his angels charge over thee lest any time dash of foot against a stone heat better yet to make him a show-off to show his authority no true servant of God ever does that let's go a little further here we can see where Jesus overcame a man this devil with these three wild attacks by using the word in the same way we're gonna overcome this devil in this ours by using God's Word verse 8 here he comes again again the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain and show with him glory to God a man showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them now I want you to understand just by looking at this scripture we can see Satan is behind the politics Satan is behind it all Satan who owns it all here he's going to show Jesus what he'll give him that means Satan has control of it right now now let me let me go a little further and stand under him all these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship Me now verse 10 says then said Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him what only shalt thou serve I love this because what we found here is what what Satan was trying to do to Jesus amen and getting him this again lust of the eye lusted I mean pride of life all that can be found in there but here what most most believe is that that's what Satan actually in Norton the lust of the eye and what he was trying to do brother entellus he's trying to give Jesus a kingdom without going through a Calvary he was trying to give him a kingdom without going through a Calvary you know let me tell you something when you look in Scripture people that were exalted went through something before David became King he was on the run before before Joseph became second in charge he went to prison so so you got to understand we got to go through because this is what people trying to bypass they trying to bypass the process of their character developing hallelujah but but you can't bypass that process God got to take you through some hard knocks to see if he can trust you with the power that you're looking for and the only way you're gonna get there through God school is you got to go through some trials and you got to overcome them all hallelujah all right I'm almost there yeah I'll just bear with me a little bit longer listen he said I got this again out of this message the Prophet spoke on how can overcome he said this about about Jesus say he's trying to give him a kingdom without Calvary so remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross if he did we would be lost he could have took the kingdom but he must he must come back he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died Satan would have been Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me Satan he didn't do it see he overcame the lust of the eye he overcame the lust of the flesh he overcame the pride of life a man with the Word of God and let me tell you something that may seem simple but that's exactly the formula that you gonna need to be successful and overcoming the devil in this hour your good feeling I don't get it you're jumping you're shouting don't get it but you got to give the devil two words and let me tell you something he got something for you I was I was sharing with you know you all a few weeks ago when when when the fella I was telling you all Nimrod so when Nimrod what he was going for the Genesis 11 he was going for three things he wanted to build a strong nation a man he wanted to propagate his own religion and they wanted to make a name for himself I've always said this I remember one person got upset with me for saying it but this church we're not looking for church members I'm gonna tell you who we're looking for the bride we just want to be a church full we want the bride and see the bride gonna be an agreement with the Word of God all right and the other thing other thing about you know if we were a church that's trying to go on after church members we let down all the standards I would never stand in the pulpit and preach a sermon like this I couldn't even read 1st Corinthians amen in some churches praise the Lord they wouldn't let me oh you go what - what you again I'm not against nobody I love everybody but I hate sin I know churches you can't preach against homosexuality but here you can because it's in the Bible if it's isn't about we can preach it and it's not hate speech I'm gonna tell you what's hate speech when when they hate Christians for saying it huh it's the truth when we when they hate Christians and don't want Christians and say that's hate speech I mean you know when you talk about tolerance the people that's not being tolerated is the people that's preaching it and living it that's the bus that's not being tolerated hey man there's a truth in it hi right hey man I mean you know one of these days we gonna come to church they might have to put the padlock so we don't told them to stop preaching that it's gonna happen Church all you got to do is go around go visit some other churches they would never say anything like this runner pulpit small crowds over this but when Jesus gave the truth is the truth is what set him free all right amen Nimrod wanted to do three things build a strong nation propagate his own religion make a name for himself proud of life and make it named for himself right he fell I'm actually he actually accomplished all three of those things but he did it his way not God's Way and because he did it his way not God's Way the thing came to a end it style fell apart when God came down listen i'ma tell you these denominations will fall apart when God comes down amen if we're doing it outside of what God has told us to do we cannot expect it to be successful let me go on a little further here I wanted to just read something I was been sharing this and when a brother called me well actually text me just yesterday and they say brother I've just been kind of keeping up with this thought on love not the world and said my daddy was preaching a little message here at the church and as he was preaching my thought went back to these these things that you've been saying about love not the world nor the things of the world because the love of God is not not in us he said and my daddy hid this scripture and I just need to share it with him he gave it to me so I'm gonna give it to y'all and we're gonna bring it to a close today oh my God my God my God look at this this is John 17 John 17 we've been talking about this see there's there's multiple worlds that we're looking at here a man which they love not the world nor the things of the world and and God so loved the world with multiple things that we need to look at because God made multi worlds visible invisible he's made it all and there's demons and inside that invisible world there's angels also inside that invisible world hallelujah but God's coming to the world that you live in and he's trying to bring Redemption to you all right look at this John 17 I'm gonna start at verse eight I think this is a very very good scripture and we'll bring it home verse eight it says for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and I wanna I want to borrow the words of Jesus because as I was thinking on this whole subject of love not the world I was there in Tucson I was just reading my Bible and that just kind of rolls up I'm like man love not the world nor the things of the world and this dis dis applies in multiple areas it applies in the way that we dress yes it does it it applies in the way we present ourselves as Christians it does apply amen even to the church world and what to get involved with and what not to get involved with it applies to even what happened in the garden of eatin right this is a very very deep Scripture glory to God love not the world nor the things world and because it's the lust of the flesh lust of the eye private life those things that God did not God did not God's not the father that God is not the author of that that's what the devil's using to actually pull us away from God so we can't love those things look at this except so tonight my heart I feel like my heart has been delivered and I'm barring the words of Jesus if I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they had received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they had believed that thou did send me look at this I pray for them I pray not for the world Oh so I thought he loved the world I thought God so loved the world that he gave his son his only begotten Son but here here the son comes on the scene and says I pray for them not the world who was them and who was the world who's there who's the them that he's praying for but yeah but we've been told that he loves the world not everybody in the world there's demons manifested in his word he's not dying for them listen let me just be honest with you Jesus but God would not send his son to die for people that were not accepted would you give you a child for somebody we're not accepted a man God got most sister we got I mean so so so hear Jesus say I pray for them I guess he's talking about you right he's talking about you see you don't realize that you are in the world but not of the world he's talking about you he's praying for you but not those that's not going to receive him look at this say I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine let me go a little further says in all mine a vine and thine or mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more or in the world glory but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are listen while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost you know I was just thinking about this he said none of them loves but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled I'm gonna stop there I'm gonna keep on going but I was just thinking about this you know he said I pray for them not the world I pray for them not the world you know the Sadducees had their own world the Pharisees had their own world but that's not the ones that he was praying for but the ones that would be impacted by their doctrines he preformed and it was so I was this morning why we were in prayer just kind of came to me I said Lord you loved the two that went on the road to Emmaus Cleophus and his friend you loved them so much that you stopped them from going back to the world when he showed up and he came from my eyes out of the bushes they was on their way back to the world back to their denominational teachings and he showed up and stopped them from going back to the world hallelujah and I say if God could show up and stop clear pieces from going back to the world he's able to show up today and stop my loved ones and even if they made it back he can still do something so great to pull them right back out again he don't want you to love the world oh my god or the things that's the world order the world system the world way of doing things and the church world is against God's world all right all right let's go further in this verse 13 and now come out to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joyful field in themselves I have given them that word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I'm not a world and can I tell you something if the world does not hate you something wrong with your experience we're not supposed to blend in with the world we're suppose to be different from the world amen that's what Christian Christian is all about we're different from the world we always stand out Christian's always stand out now come to thee and these things verse 13 I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfill in themselves I've given them that word and the world hath hated them because they're not of the world even as I am NOT of the world I pray not that thou should take us them out of the world because some of us acts for that don't we Lord I don't want to go through this Jesus didn't want to go to that cross either but he bared it for us this is this since I pray not that thou should have take them out of the world but that thou should have keep them from the evil so that means in this world there's gonna be some evil pulling at us and what his prayers that God would keep us from evil from amen the different demonic influences that's trying to pull us into the underworld all right that thou should just keep them from the evil look verse 16 they who is they us they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world so see you know brother Branham talked about how we would see this just this world of darkness just blackness he said but every once while you see a little light in the midst of all the darkness and say what that light is it's you in the midst of the world shining light in the midst of some other situation it's talking to brother Troy just yesterday and when light comes into darkness you cannot deny it is there going to any darkroom and turn on a light darkness has to flee when light comes in if darkness is not fleeing when you walk into the room can you call yourself like Amen even if it's candle light darkness flees flash light darkness flees but you got to be light not darkness let's go on a little further sanctify them through that truth that word of truth as Dyer sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself and they also might be sanctified through the truth it was this one brother one time shared a statement with brother Branham he preached the message say I sanctify myself for the sake of others say when we live we're not living for ourselves but we're living for the sake of others somebody's got to be able to see light that's why we're here we're here to spread light right so so so and let me tell you something in order to sanctify yourself you have to put off to put off the things of the world you have to do it gonna have to volunteer to look different you know when they volunteer for the military they get a different suit you don't wear the clothes that you wanna wear you only do that in off-duty times but as long as you own duty you have to put on this uniform because your uniform identifies which branch of the service you're with amen right I mean you don't put on what you want to put on when you want to put it on they have certain certain things you wear at certain times when you are on duty if you go to a man a formal event there's certain things that you supposed to wear at the formal event right if you're going to the field of battle certain things that you supposed to wear as Christians why we got to get all shook up when God deal with us about how we suppose a dress so if you don't complain in the natural military why couldn't I complain in God's military it may you know even on the Golf Course they won't let you wear certain things hmm and now in church we just let everything go y'all y'all y'all grew up in the time where folk at church clothes separate from the play clothes and work clothes and all that now you go we don't know where you're going you're going to a bar you're going to church it's the truth anyhow that's what it used to be the people used to and another way people new year's going to church not just by the way you was dress but you always had that big Bible in your hand but not we don't want it on we don't want to carry the Bible to be identified as believers I got it on my phone I do too I got it on my phone I got a big one too everybody else know what I'm get ready to do you're going to church yep want to go with me alright Church hallelujah all right I'm coming home look at this it says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they might might be sanctified through the truth and neither pray I for these alone but for them also which they believe oh my god I like that neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word so in the midst of all this darkness of the world that we're living in God got some people gonna believe because the life that you live in in front of them they're going to believe so I'm not just praying that he'll you know take you out of the world no he just wants to give you strength so that you can overcome the evil that's in the world right they say but not only that I want I want to pray for them and not only them but pray for them that's gonna believe only testimony verse 21 says that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me in last verse and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one what a journey we've taken love not the world nor the things of the world in church I tell you what because it tells us that I mean Peter told us I mean tells us that with the love of the father's not in us when we do that he told us that we got to overcome a mental lust of the flesh we got to overcome the lust of the eyes and we got to overcome the proud of life because that's not of the Father it's of the world and see even though we go out into this world and you know the devil got so much to try to offer if it's not something physically then he's not trying to offer there's something that you're gonna get you with your eyes it might be monetarily you see oh you mean how much money doing what waiting but one Sunday that I got a miss and pastor Gong understand don't don't know so you don't realize every time you compromise on that one Sunday the devil gonna get you to compromise on another Sunday and you'll do it all and for the sake of money and it's sometimes not Sundays sometimes there's other things it's family life that we might have to well the devil offered and we sacrifice that and we'll be married to our careers method rather than married to our wives or tough families you got to watch this devil in every area of life he's always there trying to get you to do something that's outside of the will of God if he can't get you there then he's gonna work with you in popularity let them let them let them start pumping your ego just a little bit ain't nobody like you you don't only one can do this let them start pump you and when they start but what we're gonna need you to do it on this such-and-such a day when my boss told me I'm the only one can do it pastor well I'm telling you don't no one can do what you do here so why don't you do it right do it with all your heart love not the world the things of the world the love of God is not in you when you do that let's pray father we've taken a journey through this this scripture you've given us just a three-part series on it and so many angles that you've brought it from we can see it from the way that we present ourselves in this world we're not supposed to dress and act like the world that's not what you want us to do you want us to dress and act like Christians but we can see it from the angle of how a lot to receive to visitors here Abraham had a visitor but the two angels went down there to where lot was and they they preached the gospel in the world they preached it in Sodom God here they were lot was a man that was considered a man that he really didn't enjoy what was happening but he was against what was going on down there in Sodom but the problem was that he couldn't leave it he stayed connected to it somehow his wife stayed in it and Lord because they were so involved in that thing of the world God when it was time to come out he might not have lost his life but he certainly lost his wife and God as we even look at it even again today father how he fell to the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life she failed to these things God but Jesus overcame when they were presented to him and God as believers we we want to take the example of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the only way we're gonna overcome is by using the word of the Lord God help us to apply these things that we hear if there's any Lord that might be found in this place that's not living according to you word got my prayers that you would give them a man overcoming power you would give them strength Lord to rise up based on what they've heard of what they've read here today that you would give them strength Lord to apply that and to see the devil defeated in our lives we must be overcomers we must be more than conquerors we must Lord keep that devil under our feet we must be victorious when it comes to the lust of the flesh when it comes to the lust of the eyes and when it comes to the pride of life all three of these things are used by the enemy to pull us further from our God help us to be wise help us to be able to see God what the devil is trying to do in this hour help us so God is my prayer
