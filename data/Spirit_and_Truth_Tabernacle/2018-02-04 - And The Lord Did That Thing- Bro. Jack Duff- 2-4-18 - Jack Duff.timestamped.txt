[51:55] just kind of just just want to know you
[51:57] know just what what what everybody's
[51:59] going to be able to just contribute to
[52:01] if you can't do two full $3,000 whatever
[52:03] it is but we want everybody to be a part
[52:05] of this blessing because God's getting
[52:06] ready to do something special amen
[52:09] I believe so we're asking that everyone
[52:11] do that and
[52:12] and I want to thank God for those that
[52:13] have completed their pledge and turned
[52:17] it back in we thank God for that we're I
[52:20] won't give the number yet as to what we
[52:22] were expecting until everybody had a
[52:23] chance to to do it so I'm announcing
[52:26] that again today if you haven't done it
[52:27] then blaz'd please do that and put it
[52:30] back in there as soon as possible
[52:32] the other thing that you'll see out
[52:33] there is we have these letters that are
[52:36] written here from the church something
[52:38] that the Lord just gave me to to write
[52:40] and we're asking that you take that
[52:41] different people in your life that God
[52:43] might have you to just give one to that
[52:45] want to be a part of this journey with
[52:46] us amen and pledging towards us trying
[52:49] to get our own place
[52:50] you know please please just you know
[52:53] whoever you feel led to give it to it
[52:54] and give it to them and you know we'll
[52:56] just you know we'll both certainly
[52:57] appreciate that so but we want to just
[53:00] begin our journey to amen to exit
[53:03] renting and starting to own amen nothing
[53:06] wrong with that right a man and I
[53:09] believe I believe this is a season for
[53:11] us to be able to do that so since we
[53:13] voted on it we're all in amen I'm asking
[53:16] everyone please give a form back amen
[53:18] just showing your commitment as to what
[53:21] you'll be doing praise the Lord couple
[53:23] other things I need to make mention of I
[53:25] was I had a little sermon in my heart
[53:28] that I was going to preach but I just
[53:29] kind of felt leading not to go in that
[53:32] direction but I was talking last week
[53:34] about coming off of Facebook a man for
[53:37] at least a week and my primary reason
[53:39] for saying that is it's order to contain
[53:44] right I was going to preach a sermon on
[53:47] containment and I won't give you the
[53:49] whole you know thing today but in order
[53:51] to sometimes contain viruses you have to
[53:57] disconnect people from the virus all
[54:00] right all right
[54:01] so sometimes sometimes you have
[54:03] spiritual viruses that are spreading and
[54:06] the only way that you can be safe from
[54:09] the virus is you have to disconnect
[54:12] right so and and and the purpose for
[54:15] disconnecting you is to contain the
[54:18] virus
[54:19] we don't want to see other people get
[54:21] sick all right spiritually sick so so so
[54:25] we that's why I actually just just kind
[54:27] of when it's you know especially some of
[54:28] this stuff is just nonsense y'all so
[54:31] it's best that you just kind of get away
[54:33] from some of it right and you know and
[54:35] and and you know there's different ways
[54:37] that we handle things but but that's why
[54:39] I brought that out last weekend and I do
[54:41] you know I have a sermon developed
[54:43] around that but I won't preach it day
[54:45] I'll just I'll save it hey man I'll save
[54:47] it I've just kind of felt that uh maybe
[54:50] me coming out and preaching it right now
[54:53] it might get real close to some things
[54:56] it might be misunderstood and I don't
[54:59] want the Word of God to be misunderstood
[55:01] amen I want you to catch what God is
[55:04] trying to say to you but a man if even
[55:06] if you feel led Amanda to fer to remain
[55:11] contained stake disconnected alright
[55:15] Amen if you feel led as soon as you see
[55:17] some nonsense you need to be running for
[55:19] your life
[55:19] don't try to ant don't try to answer
[55:21] questions Paul actually tell you to
[55:22] avoid foolish questions ain't man it's
[55:25] so some that means Paul did not answer
[55:27] every question it's not that he running
[55:32] from it this man revealed two thirds of
[55:34] the New Testament but he still didn't
[55:36] answer every question right I mean I got
[55:39] it I got a quote that i'ma share it with
[55:41] y'all i'ma let y'all read that I'll tell
[55:43] you about it right now but there was one
[55:44] time a brother walked up and gave
[55:46] brother branham a book he said when you
[55:48] get a chance just read this and brother
[55:50] branham took the book you say okay and
[55:51] he took the book and he laid it on top
[55:53] of his Bible and he said it in his
[55:54] office and and the Holy Spirit told him
[55:58] take that mess off my Bible
[56:02] now I'm I don't I think it was the word
[56:07] mess but it was something that serious
[56:08] take that mess or that junk something
[56:11] like that off my Bible and now here the
[56:14] prophet who the word come to and God
[56:17] telling him not to read some a prophet
[56:21] right so if a prophet would be warned
[56:24] don't read that then we got to be warned
[56:28] as well you know some things don't read
[56:31] you don't want certain things going into
[56:33] your spiritual wound because once you
[56:36] allow certain stuff into your spiritual
[56:38] womb it will give birth and many of us
[56:45] just don't realize sometimes we wrapped
[56:47] up in something don't even know what we
[56:48] into because somebody might leave and
[56:51] say a little something over here and you
[56:53] might have just a little agreement but
[56:55] they trying to pull you into something a
[56:57] little further than where you want to go
[57:01] I'm time I contain men all right
[57:06] I can't preach it today but I'm just
[57:09] dropping that off for the church that
[57:11] that's you know that I gave you a
[57:13] Leviticus because there were certain
[57:15] things when it got to leprosy only
[57:18] certain people could handle it only the
[57:22] priests were designated by God to handle
[57:26] leprosy but now we got everybody else
[57:29] trying to diagnose look look look you
[57:30] know you you don't have if you're not a
[57:33] doctor certain things you probably
[57:36] should be working on
[57:40] all right I mean it just that's just the
[57:42] way it is this we got a issue here doc
[57:45] but you find a doctor that means
[57:47] somebody drop in here and they they you
[57:49] know maybe they pressure go down or
[57:51] something like that and then they drop
[57:52] here you looking for somebody with a
[57:54] certain skill set when you go to the
[58:00] hospital you're not going to stop and
[58:02] talk to the person at the reception
[58:04] that's if you got some serious pain that
[58:07] person can't help you at all they can do
[58:08] is take your name and sometimes you get
[58:10] frustrated with them because look I'm in
[58:12] pain and I don't need you asking me all
[58:14] these questions find me somebody that
[58:17] can help me I get the questions answered
[58:19] later see we got people that's
[58:22] designated to handle certain issues all
[58:27] right but it's all about containment
[58:31] right that's what it's all about but I
[58:33] that's just a prelude to some of it
[58:36] you'll get more later on a man but I'm
[58:40] just kind of giving you just a general
[58:42] warning because the enemy is at work and
[58:45] I miss the devil the devil is busy a man
[58:49] but I think God want to just give us
[58:51] victory in every area so I just I just
[58:53] appreciate the Lord and and I told y'all
[58:56] on Friday night no not not Friday which
[58:59] we do appreciate the tape we heard on
[59:01] Friday night brother branham brought out
[59:04] a statement about people it's snowing
[59:07] they won't go to church but there's a
[59:08] basketball game you know getting ready
[59:10] to happen in that same city and the
[59:12] doors was packed you know I mean you
[59:14] couldn't stop people from going in they
[59:16] didn't go to church but they did go to
[59:17] the basketball game and they said your
[59:20] God is a piece of flat air that's two
[59:25] people God is they worship the ball
[59:29] all right I'm Ali that alone they
[59:32] worship the ball they'll put the bottle
[59:35] before God all right Halen but we want
[59:40] to put God in us in his proper place hey
[59:43] man so you know we we just we just we
[59:45] want to honor God amen he's the one that
[59:48] give us our life I held that strength
[59:49] and everything else so we want to honor
[59:51] him but but we appreciate that tape amen
[59:54] on on Friday night but Wednesday night I
[59:56] was talking about hurt people will hurt
[1:00:01] people hurt people will hurt people and
[1:00:08] and and if you're just if you if you're
[1:00:11] spiritual and you can listen to hurt
[1:00:13] people you'll see how their hurts are
[1:00:16] hurting other people
[1:00:17] and and and and that's not the solution
[1:00:19] just by you talking about it
[1:00:21] you need to Liveris you need God to
[1:00:23] bring some healing to your body your
[1:00:25] inner man needs to be healed because if
[1:00:27] your inner man was here you would be
[1:00:29] talking the way you're talking and
[1:00:30] acting the way you acted but your
[1:00:32] intimate your inner man is suffering and
[1:00:35] and hurt people actually hurt other
[1:00:38] people amen their actions doing so you
[1:00:43] know I want you to be careful Church be
[1:00:45] very very careful don't know feed on a
[1:00:47] lot of nonsense the stuff that ain't
[1:00:49] going nowhere ain't gonna change
[1:00:51] iiiiii remember the preacher used to say
[1:00:54] all the times he say let the dogs bark
[1:00:56] the caravan is moving on right so when
[1:01:00] you see dogs just barking at a car
[1:01:02] that's moving I ain't never seen the
[1:01:04] owner get out of the car and you know
[1:01:07] try to stop the dogs from barking
[1:01:08] they just keep driving because
[1:01:10] eventually they know that dog I realize
[1:01:12] I can't keep up with that car and that
[1:01:14] dog is running it just turn and go back
[1:01:17] home and that's all that's happened you
[1:01:20] got dogs barking but you just keep
[1:01:22] moving on praise the Lord I hope y'all
[1:01:26] can understand
[1:01:28] so let me move on this week we had a we
[1:01:34] had a little something come up I should
[1:01:37] say something come up but we were out
[1:01:42] and and took our students bowling and
[1:01:46] they probably not gonna tell everybody a
[1:01:48] man that I thought I beat him a man and
[1:01:50] sisters of mine have praise the Lord
[1:02:00] [Laughter]
[1:02:03] beat him in bowling and but but while we
[1:02:07] was there I was just noticing you know
[1:02:10] something there was a group of men that
[1:02:11] had kind of kind of come and they start
[1:02:13] bowling as well he's just observing them
[1:02:15] and observing them and in my spirit I
[1:02:18] picked up and just deserves it he's men
[1:02:21] or men that are coming from all over the
[1:02:25] US and they're coming here to Florida
[1:02:28] because they probably have some type of
[1:02:29] addiction and they they want to be free
[1:02:32] from that addiction and and I just begin
[1:02:36] to process and think about that and it
[1:02:39] just hit me is like you know what South
[1:02:41] Florida Palm Beach County is the capital
[1:02:46] for people that are trying to break
[1:02:47] addictions they come here to Palm Beach
[1:02:50] County and I say Lord what if we were
[1:02:54] able to get some type of outreach
[1:02:58] opportunity where we could go into one
[1:03:01] of these homes and just be able to
[1:03:02] preach the gospel to the people because
[1:03:04] what happens is that pretty much every
[1:03:06] 30 days you're getting a new group of
[1:03:07] people that's coming in and you get a
[1:03:09] chance to sew something in them they may
[1:03:11] not stay here but they may go back home
[1:03:14] transformed by the word of god that was
[1:03:17] spoke to his fear so I say I I start
[1:03:19] praying I'm gonna exit Church which I'll
[1:03:21] be in prayer with me that God would open
[1:03:23] up some door for us to get in and just
[1:03:25] Cantor just just just just begin to work
[1:03:28] with people God has done some things for
[1:03:31] people in this congregation you got
[1:03:32] testimony that people need to hear that
[1:03:34] God is real God can set you free God can
[1:03:36] deliver you right we got people here
[1:03:39] that need to share those testimony so
[1:03:40] you know y'all not be in prayer that God
[1:03:42] would just open up some doors even if
[1:03:43] you hear you know maybe something where
[1:03:46] we might be able to come in I'm thinking
[1:03:48] you know just like we do pinnacle Palms
[1:03:50] because you know clinical problems we've
[1:03:52] been praying about that as the Lord is
[1:03:54] this where you want us to stay or do you
[1:03:56] want us to do something else and if God
[1:03:58] opens up another door we're gonna walk
[1:04:00] in that but until that door opens we'll
[1:04:02] stay where we are right so you know but
[1:04:05] I just want y'all to just be in prayer
[1:04:07] because we're looking for opportunities
[1:04:09] that we can be of an impact to those
[1:04:11] that in our community I think we have
[1:04:13] people just bump we bump it into them
[1:04:15] every day and just let them go right by
[1:04:16] but we have the hope that they need we
[1:04:19] have the help that they need it lays
[1:04:21] with inside of us Church so we have to
[1:04:23] have a burden to get out there and share
[1:04:24] these things with others and I just want
[1:04:27] I want to take that and lay that in the
[1:04:28] lap of the church a man it goes beyond
[1:04:31] these four walls we got to get out there
[1:04:32] and help somebody a man we're not trying
[1:04:35] to just get members in the church we're
[1:04:37] trying to get people back to heaven some
[1:04:40] I'm gonna lost a weight here on earth
[1:04:41] but we're trying to just get them back
[1:04:42] to heaven let them know you come from
[1:04:44] God and you got to go back to God
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:48] so Church just please keep us in prayer
[1:04:50] we're looking for that and we know the
[1:04:52] devil fight us as we as we try to pursue
[1:04:55] it but nonetheless
[1:04:56] we're gonna do that and the other thing
[1:04:58] that happened this week we at the school
[1:05:01] we have this person that kind of comes
[1:05:02] in once a week and you know they do do
[1:05:05] some things and and this lady she my
[1:05:09] wife was telling she stopped her
[1:05:10] the lady was trying to get the address
[1:05:12] to the school and somehow she pulled up
[1:05:14] the address to the church and then it
[1:05:16] got the came to the website of the
[1:05:18] church and as she started when she went
[1:05:20] to the website of church just looking
[1:05:22] for the address
[1:05:23] she heard singing on the website and
[1:05:26] when she heard the singing on the
[1:05:28] website she came and asked my once you
[1:05:29] see now is this building here a part of
[1:05:32] what y'all do here is it the same but no
[1:05:34] it's not the same but it is you know our
[1:05:36] church you say I went to your website
[1:05:38] and I heard y'all sing as they oh my
[1:05:40] goodness I never heard singing like that
[1:05:42] and she say this thing and just really
[1:05:45] did something to me and I say my god I
[1:05:47] begin to think church and sometimes we
[1:05:50] don't realize we come up when we sing a
[1:05:51] little song and you know think that's
[1:05:53] something but you don't know how that is
[1:05:54] ministering to somebody in church as we
[1:05:58] get ready to go out here you know you
[1:05:59] can't went went when they went to battle
[1:06:01] they put the singers up front right you
[1:06:05] got you have a ministry you God gave you
[1:06:09] that gift for a reason and it's got to
[1:06:12] be used for his glory right but but we
[1:06:15] you know when we when we get ready to do
[1:06:16] the tip we gonna do things a little
[1:06:18] different we're not just gonna have a
[1:06:19] song service we might do we might have a
[1:06:20] little little praise team in the tent
[1:06:24] three or four singers man y'all get the
[1:06:27] anointing going in here because this is
[1:06:30] what we need in order to break these
[1:06:31] chains Church I'm just trying to lay it
[1:06:34] all out before men we're going to do war
[1:06:36] and everybody gotta be in a place so
[1:06:43] don't sit on your gift we came that you
[1:06:45] do that it's blessing people right so
[1:06:48] some kind of way we got it we got to
[1:06:49] pull together and we got to do what God
[1:06:51] has called us to do a man and God didn't
[1:06:54] call us just to come sit on these pews
[1:06:56] there are chairs that's not it
[1:06:57] we got to get out and we got to do
[1:06:59] something we got to make an impact in
[1:07:00] our community so church I'm telling my
[1:07:03] sick the singers y'all get ready a man
[1:07:06] everybody that can be used to do
[1:07:08] something there might be something else
[1:07:09] where I don't say I'm doing it you can
[1:07:11] pass out tracts you can smile at
[1:07:15] somebody you can give somebody a hug and
[1:07:17] tell them Jesus love them you can do
[1:07:20] something they need a guard with peeing
[1:07:23] on them you betta God with skin on we
[1:07:28] all have a responsibility in church this
[1:07:32] is the beginning of the year we just
[1:07:33] setting it right we're trying to set it
[1:07:35] right but this is where we're trying to
[1:07:37] go

[1:07:39] the octave God has given us the after
[1:07:41] we're raising it and we're going out

[1:07:54] some of us it's a one there's one thing
[1:07:56] if we can't go and it's another thing

[1:11:02] that he was going through with us with
[1:11:04] his body
[1:11:05] God the doctors have given us their
[1:11:08] report but we want to see what you have
[1:11:11] to say about it
[1:11:12] so God while there's breath in his body
[1:11:13] we're gonna ask that you touch him

[1:11:20] nothing too hard for you so god we're
[1:11:21] just we're just trusting you that you

[1:11:28] through this time we just we look to you
[1:11:31] god that's all we can do is look to you
[1:11:34] so we pray that you would be involved

[1:11:38] strength Lord to each and every one and
[1:11:40] may you be glorified we we thank you
[1:11:42] that you brought sister Laura out of the
[1:11:45] hospital doctors couldn't find anything
[1:11:48] they ran tests couldn't find anything
[1:11:50] that shows that your hand does that work
[1:11:52] and if you can do it for her you can do
[1:11:54] for him so father we just we just commit
[1:11:56] them down to your capable hands as we
[1:11:58] turn our attention to the Word of God we
[1:12:01] pray that the Holy Spirit would take
[1:12:03] control over the thought today and may
[1:12:06] you get all the glory may you get all
[1:12:07] the honor that you get all the praise
[1:12:09] from everything that would be spoken and
[1:12:11] everything that would be received it's
[1:12:14] in Jesus name we pray
[1:12:15] a man a man turn with me to two portions
[1:12:20] of Scripture I want to tell you what I
[1:12:28] started Exodus 7 and then I'll go to
[1:12:31] John 5 as well we're trying to kind of
[1:12:37] tie a couple of things together here and
[1:12:40] we'll see how the Lord takes it Exodus 7
[1:12:44] just verse 1 and 2 then I want to go
[1:12:48] over to John 5 it says here nexus7 says
[1:12:52] and the Lord said unto Moses see I have
[1:12:54] made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy
[1:12:58] brother shall be thy prophet this is a
[1:13:02] powerful statement I have made the year
[1:13:06] God to another person he's a God to
[1:13:10] Pharaoh
[1:13:11] right I've made the Agard to Pharaoh now
[1:13:16] that that should not shock us too much
[1:13:18] right because if a a cat gives birth it
[1:13:23] should be another cat if a dog gives
[1:13:27] birth it should be another dog if a
[1:13:28] monkey gives birth it should be another
[1:13:30] monkey and if God gives birth it should
[1:13:34] be God
[1:13:36] so I have made the a god to Pharaoh and
[1:13:40] Aaron thy brother shall be that prophet
[1:13:42] thou shall speak all and that's the key
[1:13:44] thing that I want us to try to catch
[1:13:46] there thou shall speak all that I
[1:13:48] command thee and Aaron thy brother shall
[1:13:52] speak in the Pharaoh that he that he
[1:13:54] send the children Israel out of his land
[1:13:57] amen let's turn over here to John five
[1:14:02] and we will just read this I'll start at
[1:14:09] verse 14 and John five praise the Lord
[1:14:21] it says this after what Jesus found with
[1:14:24] him in the temple and said unto Him
[1:14:26] behold thou art made whole sin no more
[1:14:29] lest a worse thing come unto thee the
[1:14:34] man departed and told the Jews that it
[1:14:36] was Jesus which had made him whole and
[1:14:39] therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus
[1:14:42] and sought to slay him because he had
[1:14:45] done these things on the Sabbath day but
[1:14:49] jesus answered them my father worketh
[1:14:52] hitherto
[1:14:52] and I work therefore the Jews sought the
[1:14:56] more to kill him because he not only had
[1:14:58] broken the Sabbath but said also that
[1:15:02] God was his father making himself equal
[1:15:05] with God then answered Jesus and said
[1:15:12] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[1:15:15] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:15:18] what he seeth the father do for what
[1:15:22] things soever he doeth these also doeth
[1:15:25] the son likewise the Lord had a blessing
[1:15:28] to the reading of his word you could be
[1:15:30] seated
[1:15:40] praise the Lord I'll wait to give you my
[1:15:43] title if I could just have you read Amen
[1:15:55] a couple more scriptures with me we will
[1:15:59] take off from there turn with me the
[1:16:02] first Corinthians chapter 6 and while
[1:16:06] we're getting this do I have anybody in
[1:16:12] here that would be honest a man and say
[1:16:18] that the Lord has brought you from a
[1:16:21] mighty long way I want you to just kind
[1:16:29] of get in your mind a man before we get
[1:16:32] started I want you to get in your mind
[1:16:34] just just maybe some of the things the
[1:16:36] Lord has brought you from write some of
[1:16:39] that some of the things that God has
[1:16:41] done for you you know they used to have
[1:16:43] a thing you can't tell me let me tell me
[1:16:47] what the Lord has done for me you know
[1:16:50] and and and if God has brought you from
[1:16:53] somewhere God has done something for you
[1:16:55] delivered you from something or whatever
[1:16:57] you know you ought to get that in your
[1:16:59] mind and just just just just think on
[1:17:01] that and we're gonna read these
[1:17:03] scriptures and we'll we'll go from there
[1:17:06] first first Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[1:17:09] 9 says this know ye not that the
[1:17:13] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:17:17] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:17:21] fornicators and some of us has been
[1:17:24] delivered from fornication nor idolaters
[1:17:28] praise the Lord Amen we talked about
[1:17:31] that they brother branham talked about
[1:17:32] that basketball that was idolatry right
[1:17:35] he says because that became that got
[1:17:38] before God God don't want nothing in
[1:17:40] front of him he's got to be first right
[1:17:41] nor idolaters nor adulterers God has
[1:17:45] delivered us from some of these things
[1:17:46] nor effeminate now if you don't
[1:17:48] understand what that word is that's
[1:17:50] homosexual ISM
[1:17:52] and if God has not delivered anybody
[1:17:54] here from that Amen I want you to
[1:17:56] understand that you can't avoid every
[1:17:58] homosexual you see because the Bible
[1:18:01] said that some of the effeminate we're
[1:18:03] gonna be delivered somebody that's
[1:18:08] effeminate will be the living no it's
[1:18:11] not acceptable Bible even tell us that
[1:18:13] you can't even make it to heaven like
[1:18:14] that y'all want me to read it again a
[1:18:17] verse 9 says know ye not that the
[1:18:20] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:18:23] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:18:26] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[1:18:28] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:18:32] with mankind and there's a lot that's
[1:18:36] involved in that right abusers of
[1:18:38] themselves with mankind nor thieves you
[1:18:41] can't steal and go to heaven nor
[1:18:43] covetous a man nor drunkards you can't
[1:18:46] drink and go all right nor revilers nor
[1:18:49] extortioners cheap people you can't do
[1:18:52] that and go none of that gonna inherit
[1:18:54] the kingdom of God right she'll inherit
[1:18:57] the kingdom of God and verse 11 says and
[1:18:59] such word that I like that word I used
[1:19:06] to be that way this this was my
[1:19:08] testimony but but when Christ came in I
[1:19:11] became a new creation right I'm a new
[1:19:15] creature in Christ right so so such were
[1:19:18] some of you but ye are washed amen but
[1:19:22] ye are sanctified but ye are justified
[1:19:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
[1:19:28] spirit of our God
[1:19:30] I see something you know read in that
[1:19:32] particular scripture if any of us were
[1:19:34] guilty of some of the things that I just
[1:19:36] read you can go back in your mind you
[1:19:37] can see where the Lord brought you from
[1:19:39] and you can look at your neighbor and
[1:19:41] say won't he do it
[1:19:45] won't he do it I want to do it
[1:19:49] tired of the day and the Lord did that
[1:19:53] thing
[1:19:59] the Lord did that thing God is a good
[1:20:09] God and he's doing some great things in
[1:20:13] our myths so let me just you know work
[1:20:18] my way into this the Lord did that thing
[1:20:24] here I want to read from a man I was
[1:20:29] gonna read another scripture but I'll
[1:20:30] bypass that right now I'll give it to
[1:20:33] you for homework you can go read
[1:20:34] Ephesians 2:1 through 10 you can see how
[1:20:37] God brought you from a mighty long way
[1:20:39] but I want to read a quote here from
[1:20:41] blind Bartimaeus and and we're circling
[1:20:44] you know bringing our way back over here
[1:20:46] to John 5 and just using that you know
[1:20:50] the Lord did that thing the Lord the
[1:20:52] Lord did that you know you couldn't
[1:20:54] deliver yourself you couldn't get
[1:20:56] yourself free from some of the stuff
[1:20:58] that you was involved in but God did it
[1:21:00] a man the Lord did that thing alright so
[1:21:03] so here here I wanna I want to just kind
[1:21:06] of take this blind Bartimaeus says this
[1:21:09] now Jesus that I might speak to you this
[1:21:11] way when he was on earth he did not
[1:21:13] claim to be a healer he claimed he only
[1:21:17] did as the father showed him to do is
[1:21:20] that right how many ever read that in
[1:21:22] the Bible you know st. John 5:19 that
[1:21:25] Jesus Christ himself never healed
[1:21:28] anybody no he said I do nothing till the
[1:21:31] father shows me first what to do he saw
[1:21:34] a vision of what to do and then he did
[1:21:38] what the father told him he said that in
[1:21:41] his words of course it's true isn't it
[1:21:43] st. John 5:19 when he said verily verily
[1:21:45] I stand to you the son can do nothing in
[1:21:48] himself but what he sees the father
[1:21:51] doing that doeth the son likewise now he
[1:21:55] had to tell the truth because he was
[1:21:57] infallible he was the son of God and God
[1:21:59] amen and God Himself was in Christ
[1:22:02] reconciling the world to himself the
[1:22:04] body the man was Jesus
[1:22:06] son of God but the spirit in him was
[1:22:08] Jehovah itself tabernacle here in human
[1:22:13] flesh in order to take away sin he goes
[1:22:16] on says did you ever notice the great
[1:22:19] thing why God did that now God had to be
[1:22:22] made flesh because it wouldn't be right
[1:22:24] if somebody else was flesh and if God
[1:22:27] was a man of flesh who sent a different
[1:22:30] man to make two men having two guys it
[1:22:33] wouldn't be right
[1:22:33] see because God Himself can send
[1:22:35] somebody else and be just and then if he
[1:22:38] pronounced the penalty he had to take it
[1:22:41] himself in order to do it he had to make
[1:22:44] himself a body which was a creative son
[1:22:48] Jesus Christ Himself dwelled in this for
[1:22:51] the suffering made himself a little
[1:22:52] lower than the Angels to take the suffer
[1:22:54] for sin and for sickness now I wanted to
[1:22:57] just kind of bring that because even
[1:23:00] here the prophets terms that Jesus
[1:23:02] himself was not the one that would do
[1:23:04] the healing it was it was God that was
[1:23:06] doing it God was showing him where to go
[1:23:08] God would show him who to come in
[1:23:10] contact with God was doing all these
[1:23:12] things and as God did that then you know
[1:23:14] the supernatural would take place when
[1:23:16] we read in John 5 you know what happened
[1:23:18] Jesus felt led a man that to go down
[1:23:21] here to this this the sheep gate the
[1:23:25] Sheep market it was a pool there that
[1:23:28] the Pool of Bethesda you know that he
[1:23:31] went down to and and what the Bible
[1:23:33] tells us that there would be a lot of
[1:23:34] people just laying here at this gate or
[1:23:37] laying here at this pool and and they're
[1:23:39] just waiting for a particular something
[1:23:42] to happen and as they were sitting there
[1:23:44] that pool they wait for the troubling of
[1:23:47] the water and then they wait for the
[1:23:49] Aged of God the Bible say the angel come
[1:23:52] down at a certain season hallelujah you
[1:23:55] got to be able to catch God in his
[1:23:56] seasons amen we were talking about that
[1:23:59] on last week it seemed like this was a
[1:24:01] season for people that work that needed
[1:24:03] transportation God was blessing them in
[1:24:05] this season right and when you see God
[1:24:07] blessing other people that's when you
[1:24:09] got to jump in and try to get what you
[1:24:10] know God got for you if you having some
[1:24:12] car trouble you ought to be expecting
[1:24:14] God to do something for you amen because
[1:24:16] this is the season and
[1:24:18] think of it is when you when they
[1:24:19] recognize that the angel was coming in
[1:24:22] that season they never knew when the
[1:24:24] season could happen but when the angel
[1:24:25] came in that season they had to jump in
[1:24:28] and the first person to jump in was the
[1:24:30] first person and the only person to be
[1:24:33] made whole right you can be coming to
[1:24:36] the pool you can be getting ready a man
[1:24:39] that house to get there you have to
[1:24:40] already be there and be prepared ready
[1:24:42] to jump in if you wanted to get your
[1:24:44] healing I don't care what your condition
[1:24:47] was if you got into that pool when the
[1:24:50] aliens have moved your condition was
[1:24:53] going things hallelujah that's where the
[1:24:56] people's faith was that if I get in now
[1:24:58] things are gonna change but you know
[1:25:00] Jesus when he went down here there was a
[1:25:02] man that had been sitting at this pool
[1:25:04] for about 38 years now you know you look
[1:25:07] at this man and and Jesus you know walks
[1:25:09] up to him and and he's laying there on
[1:25:11] his cotton and Jesus acts and requests a
[1:25:13] say will that be made whole now this man
[1:25:16] really didn't answer to his questions he
[1:25:17] came back with a bunch of excuses as to
[1:25:19] why he couldn't be made whole God don't
[1:25:22] want to hear your excuses ain't many ask
[1:25:24] you a question you want to answer
[1:25:25] nothing but the reason I can't get holes
[1:25:28] because you know when I'm coming down
[1:25:30] somebody get in in front of me and it's
[1:25:32] been happening this way for 38 years
[1:25:33] where you gonna do some difference you
[1:25:37] know I told you before that when you
[1:25:39] give God excuses excuses only satisfy
[1:25:43] one person amen excuses only satisfy the
[1:25:47] person that's making them nobody else
[1:25:49] getting nothing out of that excuse right
[1:25:52] God Himself don't get no glory from your
[1:25:54] excuse so we got to get ready I excuses
[1:25:57] and we got to get busy for God I'm an
[1:26:02] action you know about what everybody
[1:26:04] else is doing I've asked you will you'd
[1:26:05] be made whole and you know when he said
[1:26:08] I'm sure I have no man when the waters
[1:26:10] trouble to put me into the pool but
[1:26:12] while I am coming another stepping down
[1:26:14] before me so I he's trying to say I need
[1:26:16] some help but I can't do some things on
[1:26:18] my own what he was was very comfortable
[1:26:20] in his condition now I'm gonna tell you
[1:26:22] when you read this scripture that the
[1:26:25] the leaders of that game was also
[1:26:28] comfortable him and comfortable with him
[1:26:30] in that condition Rick
[1:26:32] when the man got healed the very first
[1:26:34] thing they said is that why you doing
[1:26:36] this on the Sabbath day why you do I
[1:26:39] mean rather than say praise God for your
[1:26:41] healing they say why you allowed us to
[1:26:44] happen on the Sabbath day like he can
[1:26:46] pick today when God gonna heal him he
[1:26:50] can't pick the day by 20 the same take
[1:26:53] up your bed rise take up your bed and
[1:26:55] walk he did exactly that he was made
[1:26:57] whole from that very hour now what Jesus
[1:27:01] was trying to said now I didn't do that
[1:27:02] in my own I didn't do that on my own
[1:27:04] what happens that God showed me that the
[1:27:06] man was gonna be down there and all I
[1:27:08] did and see irregardless of the
[1:27:10] conversation that I'm having with the
[1:27:11] man that did not detour Jesus I want
[1:27:14] y'all to stay with me write that then
[1:27:16] detour Jesus the count even though this
[1:27:18] plan didn't even answer the right way
[1:27:20] even though I mean his response was not
[1:27:22] the right response God had it in his
[1:27:25] mind that that man was going to be made
[1:27:27] whole on that day Oh hallelujah amen you
[1:27:32] might have come to church with the wrong
[1:27:34] attitude but if God got his mind that
[1:27:36] this gonna be the day that you are
[1:27:38] delivered in this community if God
[1:27:41] having this mind that this is going to
[1:27:43] be the data to receive the baptism of
[1:27:46] the Holy Ghost and this is gonna be the
[1:27:48] thing even if you didn't want to be here
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:54] you can't stop God no matter what he
[1:28:01] said jesus knew that God showed him that
[1:28:03] he would be there and they went at me
[1:28:05] start talking to him and before you knew
[1:28:07] it
[1:28:07] this man was up and he was made whole
[1:28:09] and in sad part is he didn't even know
[1:28:12] who made him hope when they begin to ask
[1:28:14] questions you know like who told you to
[1:28:17] take up your band walk like they didn't
[1:28:19] know who else is telling to do things on
[1:28:20] the Sabbath thing who else keep coming
[1:28:22] who else in y'all camp
[1:28:24] keep coming up with these type of things
[1:28:25] y'all know as Jesus but when they heard
[1:28:29] it was Jesus they begin to come against
[1:28:30] him but the key thing I want you to get
[1:28:32] there is that Jesus made it very clear
[1:28:34] that he wasn't the one doing it it was
[1:28:37] it was God it was God that was showing
[1:28:40] him as a son God was showing him what to
[1:28:44] do and what
[1:28:45] want you to understand that amen when
[1:28:47] God begins to move in his power with you
[1:28:49] it's not you doing it the Lord did that
[1:28:53] thing and you're gonna have to stop and
[1:28:57] give glory to God amen the Lord did that
[1:29:00] thing all he did was just use your
[1:29:03] elements but it was God that did that
[1:29:06] you pray for somebody in there heal God
[1:29:09] did that you can't take no glory the
[1:29:14] Lord did that thing recently we were
[1:29:19] here and we had a you know we had the

[1:34:15] he also had a situation where he had to
[1:34:19] have his stomach drain like every week
[1:34:21] because of some fluid building up in the
[1:34:22] stomach after that service it was he was
[1:34:25] going by five of six weeks before you

[1:35:45] drive him here got him here and you know
[1:35:47] there was great fun and the cousin told
[1:35:49] me this we can say now I had a cyst
[1:35:52] right here on my own you know he said my
[1:35:58] arm here and say I know I had that sis
[1:36:00] say cuz sometimes they get real hard
[1:36:02] then sometimes I get a little softer and

[1:36:27] internal right so somehow some way the
[1:36:30] since disappeared and he came that he
[1:36:33] can't miss it that's I just want to tell
[1:36:35] us and then the Lord did that say won't
[1:36:44] he do it
[1:36:46] oh my god
[1:36:50] see Church we got we got to understand
[1:36:53] that God is moving God I mean the Bible
[1:36:56] tells that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:36:58] yesterday today and forever with
[1:36:59] testimonies like these we ought to go to
[1:37:01] the streets we honest we ought to share
[1:37:05] hope with people right we can't wait for
[1:37:08] them to come to us let's go to them
[1:37:13] hallelujah people looking for a God with
[1:37:15] skin on them so you got God God God did
[1:37:17] this and you know I want to just kind of
[1:37:20] drop into something here a man I'm I'm a
[1:37:23] reacts 3:16 here for in a second but
[1:37:27] another another little quote that I want
[1:37:29] to just give you a faith is the
[1:37:31] substance a man faith is the substance
[1:37:33] the Prophet says this the very God back
[1:37:36] there in the beginning that rolled the
[1:37:37] world the moon the Stars and made them
[1:37:40] from things which do not appear or made
[1:37:43] them out of things that do up here right
[1:37:47] he says out of things and where did he
[1:37:49] get the material to make it he spoke it
[1:37:52] into existence by his word he said let
[1:37:55] there be see if I could just break it
[1:37:59] down the chair you sitting on is because
[1:38:01] of the spoken word of God the car you
[1:38:03] driving is because of the spoken word of
[1:38:05] God this earth was was void it was empty
[1:38:08] it was nothing my god but but when God
[1:38:11] spoke it became something so everything
[1:38:14] the two halves because was a spoken word
[1:38:15] of God listen he says he says it says
[1:38:18] he's spoken into existence by us where
[1:38:19] they said let there be and it was so
[1:38:21] deity and this is what I want you to get
[1:38:23] a portion of that deity dwells in the
[1:38:27] heart of every born-again Christian amen
[1:38:32] so there's a portion of God dwelling on
[1:38:34] the inside of you and when when the
[1:38:36] situation is right and ready
[1:38:39] God will anoint you to speak listen say
[1:38:45] hallelujah then what did he say ask what
[1:38:48] you will and it'll be given to you there
[1:38:50] you are
[1:38:50] did you felling their Pentecost is still
[1:38:53] falling all right hallelujah
[1:38:57] I'll tell you we need we need to
[1:38:58] recognize these things I mean and when
[1:39:01] we see God do it give him all the glory
[1:39:02] God did that thing it wasn't us it was
[1:39:05] God that did it now let me just kind of
[1:39:07] drop into acts 3:16 really quick I want
[1:39:10] to read that aid man and this in the
[1:39:12] Bible says and his name through faith in
[1:39:15] his name hath made this man strong whom
[1:39:19] ye see and know yea the faith which is
[1:39:24] by him hath given him this perfect
[1:39:26] soundness in the presence of you all now
[1:39:29] I want you I want you to catch that and
[1:39:31] his name through faith in his name hath
[1:39:34] made this man strong whom you see and
[1:39:37] know
[1:39:38] yea the faith which is by him hath given
[1:39:42] him this perfect soundness in the
[1:39:45] presence of you all now you know when we
[1:39:47] when we look at this this was the story
[1:39:51] of a man a man that was sitting at the
[1:39:54] gate called beautiful right and as he
[1:39:56] was sitting at the gate called beautiful
[1:39:57] he was begging arms and just asking
[1:40:00] different people to just give him a
[1:40:01] little money here and give him a little
[1:40:02] money there to kind of take care of
[1:40:03] himself and maybe his family you know
[1:40:05] and I and this one day the disciples
[1:40:08] happened to be going through there and
[1:40:09] and the prophets say no doubt many times
[1:40:11] Jesus went right by this man and the
[1:40:13] reason Jesus did that he left the man
[1:40:15] there knowing that the disciples would
[1:40:17] deal with him in a future time
[1:40:19] hallelujah right so so here here this
[1:40:22] man is sitting there and and the
[1:40:23] disciples come by a Peter and John are
[1:40:25] on their way to the temple to pray and
[1:40:27] and went and when it when it when they
[1:40:28] get that acidity the man said look all
[1:40:30] of us to the man looked on him as if
[1:40:32] they were about to get something as if
[1:40:35] he was about to get something from them
[1:40:36] where Peter John say silver and gold
[1:40:38] have I none but such as I have I give
[1:40:42] unto thee what they had was that the
[1:40:44] healing virtue that was flowing from the
[1:40:46] Son of God was not flowing through them
[1:40:48] and they gave that to that man
[1:40:50] they gave the man his healing that he
[1:40:53] can do it until God showed them to do it
[1:40:55] I don't know how many times they might
[1:40:57] have went to church and went right by
[1:40:58] him but one day things change and they
[1:41:03] say oh my god one of these days you know
[1:41:05] it's gonna be a different service Church
[1:41:06] I'm letting you know that right now one
[1:41:08] date
[1:41:10] we come a man out of tradition but one
[1:41:12] day God gonna drop down and do something
[1:41:14] traditions don't change Oh hallelujah I
[1:41:17] believe that I believe that a man is
[1:41:19] maybe somebody not looking for the Holy
[1:41:21] Ghost of the Holy Ghost just baptized
[1:41:22] you right there on the spot that's
[1:41:23] that's what I'm talking about you you
[1:41:25] wonder what happened to them God God did
[1:41:28] that dang but here you know this man was
[1:41:33] sitting there and you know and they say
[1:41:35] look on us and he looked and said maybe
[1:41:38] I'm gonna get a little arm so now I'm
[1:41:39] sitting go we don't have but what we
[1:41:40] have we want to give to you so they rise
[1:41:42] up and walk in the name of Jesus the
[1:41:44] Bible say they they they picked him up
[1:41:45] and as they picked him up he begin to
[1:41:47] receive strength in his in his legs and
[1:41:50] and he began to leap and he begin the
[1:41:51] jump begin to worship and praise God
[1:41:53] they couldn't sit him down in church
[1:41:54] that day
[1:41:55] Oh hallelujah I wish we have a servant
[1:41:57] like that we can't sit folk down
[1:42:01] people just get wild in the presence of
[1:42:04] God running here and there and I man I
[1:42:09] just want to see God do some things but
[1:42:12] after you finish running in here you'll
[1:42:13] run out there and tell somebody that God
[1:42:16] did that same tells us that it was faith
[1:42:25] through faith in his name hath made this
[1:42:28] man strong whom you see and know yea the
[1:42:31] faith which is by him hath given him
[1:42:33] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:42:34] of y'all and and what brother Branham
[1:42:36] says say it was the faith of Jesus
[1:42:38] Christ that man's faith did not make him
[1:42:41] whole but what happened was that the
[1:42:43] faith of the Lord Jesus dropped in that
[1:42:46] man at that time and made him believe
[1:42:49] the promise of God see i'ma tell you
[1:42:52] when he was made hold that one even his
[1:42:53] own faith they made him hold God did
[1:42:55] that thing God did that right it was it
[1:43:01] was the faith of the Lord that dropped
[1:43:03] in the man and they don't believe the
[1:43:05] Word of God we need God's faith to drop
[1:43:08] down on us and make us
[1:43:11] leave halleluyah halleluyah see
[1:43:17] something don't change one day glory to
[1:43:20] God let's look at let's let's look at a
[1:43:22] couple things I want to read a quote out
[1:43:24] of pergamene church age on that
[1:43:26] hallelujah
[1:43:27] here's where the Prophet explains it
[1:43:30] says in acts 3:16 when Peter was axed
[1:43:33] how the mighty miracle had taken place
[1:43:36] upon the crippled one at the gate too
[1:43:38] beautiful he explained it on this wise
[1:43:40] and his Jesus name through faith in his
[1:43:43] Jesus name hath made this man former
[1:43:46] crippled strong ye the faith which is by
[1:43:50] or from him Jesus hath given him the man
[1:43:54] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:43:56] of you all see there it is Jesus name
[1:44:00] and Jesus faith brought about the
[1:44:03] miracle Peter did not claim it was his
[1:44:05] own human faith any more than he claimed
[1:44:07] that it was that it was his own name
[1:44:10] he said that Jesus's name used in the
[1:44:13] faith which is from Jesus perform that
[1:44:17] great work this faith is what the Lord
[1:44:19] was speaking about in Revelation 213 it
[1:44:22] was his faith it was not faith in him a
[1:44:26] man but it was his own faith that had
[1:44:29] given that he had given to the believers
[1:44:31] I'm in paragraph 179 - - just type that
[1:44:34] in 179 - - I've says Romans 12:3
[1:44:37] according as God hath dealt to every man
[1:44:40] according to verse 1 the man our
[1:44:43] brethren the measure of faith Ephesians
[1:44:46] 2:8 by grace ye are saved through faith
[1:44:49] and that faith not of yourselves is the
[1:44:52] gift of God it is and it also says in
[1:44:56] change to one my brother and notice he
[1:44:58] took - notice he too is talking to
[1:45:02] brethren have not the faith earth not in
[1:45:05] our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to
[1:45:08] person see this is what we're looking
[1:45:09] for
[1:45:09] we need the faith of Jesus not just
[1:45:11] faith in Jesus but we want the faith of
[1:45:13] Jesus to drop down inside the church
[1:45:16] because we're getting some things done
[1:45:18] with the faith of Jesus the faith of
[1:45:21] Jesus cannot doubt his word
[1:45:23] no matter what it goes through the faith
[1:45:25] of Jesus will continue to believe it's
[1:45:27] the same faith that spoke let there be
[1:45:30] there's there's the part of deity that
[1:45:33] is dwelling in every believer with the
[1:45:35] Holy Ghost it's the faith of Jesus
[1:45:38] Christ
[1:45:39] it's the virtue of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:45:42] temperance of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:45:44] knowledge of Jesus Christ where is the
[1:45:47] love of Jesus Christ it's the public
[1:45:50] honest oh Jesus Christ

[1:46:30] notice he too is talking to brother and
[1:46:32] have not the faith of not in our Lord
[1:46:36] Jesus Christ with respective persons it
[1:46:38] says in this program an age where men
[1:46:41] were humanized in salvation having
[1:46:44] turned from the truth that salvation of
[1:46:46] the Lord having cast aside the doctrine
[1:46:49] of election open open wide the church
[1:46:51] door and the fellowship to any and all
[1:46:53] who subscribed to their tenants never
[1:46:56] mind the word in this age of rapid
[1:46:58] degradation there were still a few who
[1:47:02] have the measure of that faith of our
[1:47:05] Lord Jesus Christ not only used that
[1:47:07] faith in acts of power but we've stood
[1:47:09] those who dare to say that they were
[1:47:11] saved simply on the grounds of joining
[1:47:13] the church they knew that no man could
[1:47:16] truly believe unto eternal life and a
[1:47:18] righteousness of God apart from the
[1:47:20] measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:22] himself as today's church is filled with
[1:47:25] mental believers who endorsed the virgin
[1:47:29] birth the shed blood going to church and
[1:47:32] taking communion and are not reborn at

[1:47:37] with mental faith a lot of them say even
[1:47:40] so in that third a each was the same
[1:47:42] problem human faith wasn't enough then

[1:47:58] your faith next thing you know you take
[1:47:59] on God Smith
[1:48:02] hallelujah it takes the very faith of
[1:48:05] the Son of God to drop into a man's

[1:48:54] like Moses like Eliezer like those
[1:48:58] prophets who live so close to God till
[1:49:00] God just transferring himself right into
[1:49:04] them oh you had a transfer you didn't
[1:49:07] realize that that's what the Holy Ghost

[1:49:15] himself right into if you say you've got
[1:49:17] the Spirit of God it ought to be doing
[1:49:18] the same thing that they was doing in

[1:49:22] see in the church
[1:49:23] glory to God amen amen I thank God for
[1:49:28] that the few mean the miracles that just
[1:49:30] happened but I think God got some Oh

[1:49:34] one thing to share a testimony what
[1:49:36] happened with the gods prophet but
[1:49:37] what's happening with God's people you
[1:49:41] know there's been a lot of criticism
[1:49:43] criticism around the message saying God
[1:49:44] ain't doing nothing I'm owed a lion not

[1:56:35] idea that her husband had come to church
[1:56:37] because women and man was separate at
[1:56:39] that time she had come to church not

[1:57:33] you're dealing with you're dealing with
[1:57:35] God God's people it's the Lord that's
[1:57:38] doing that thing let me finish this
[1:57:41] quote I got to get over here to Exodus
[1:57:43] all right where am I says uh Jesus is
[1:57:48] not written is it not written it's not
[1:57:51] it written you condemned me saying that
[1:57:53] I'm the son of God isn't it written that
[1:57:55] you are God's
[1:57:56] don't your own laws say that like Moses
[1:57:58] like in largely like those prophets who
[1:57:59] lives so close to God so God just
[1:58:01] transfer himself right into them
[1:58:03] and they spoke not themselves but God
[1:58:05] take no thought what you should say
[1:58:08] because it's not you that speaks it's
[1:58:10] the father that dwelleth in you he's he
[1:58:13] do it to speak in his words it's not his
[1:58:14] own because his life is dead if you die
[1:58:18] you take the blood out of a man you
[1:58:20] embalm him trouble of it is a lot of
[1:58:22] them never get involved you take the
[1:58:24] blood out of the man he's gone then the
[1:58:26] only thing you can do is put it do is
[1:58:29] put another blood back in him he's going
[1:58:31] to live again you took his blood
[1:58:33] out now you've put the blood of G you
[1:58:36] took a spool out but and now you put the
[1:58:38] blood of Jesus Christ MC and that brings
[1:58:40] the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of
[1:58:43] Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[1:58:46] Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ
[1:58:48] the patience of jesus christ the
[1:58:51] godliness of jesus christ the brotherly
[1:58:53] kindness of jesus christ and the love of
[1:58:55] God which is Jesus Christ
[1:58:58] he's the head and controls you and your
[1:59:01] feet is the foundation faith a man
[1:59:03] controlled by the head see take there
[1:59:05] you are there is the perfect man of God
[1:59:07] when he possesses these virtues let me
[1:59:10] go on he says then God represent his
[1:59:12] church as a bride a woman God represents
[1:59:14] his church as a bride and the way he
[1:59:16] brings each individual to being his son
[1:59:19] to go in that bride he also brought them
[1:59:22] right through the ages a man till he
[1:59:25] brings this one complete church into
[1:59:27] this my feet moves why because my head
[1:59:30] said so now it can't move like my hand
[1:59:33] because it's my feet Luther can't do the
[1:59:35] things that we did neither can the
[1:59:37] Methodists because they were something
[1:59:39] else see the feet moves because the
[1:59:41] headset so and the head never says now
[1:59:44] feet you become hand here you become I
[1:59:47] see but each age God has placed these
[1:59:50] things into the church and pattern it by
[1:59:53] showing that each individual has these
[1:59:55] possesses these qualities and this being
[1:59:58] when it is completed is the Church of
[2:00:02] God going to rapture and this being and
[2:00:07] complete it is a servant of God in the
[2:00:11] Church of God that's going in the
[2:00:12] rapture glory see what I mean there you
[2:00:14] are there's the full thing our purpose
[2:00:17] for coming here is because we try to
[2:00:18] become more and more like Jesus we don't
[2:00:21] want to just be church members we want
[2:00:23] to be Christians Christians act like
[2:00:26] Christ let's flip over here to Exodus
[2:00:30] the Lord did that thing the Lord did it
[2:00:36] he's working in us he's called us from
[2:00:39] some some really rough places in life
[2:00:42] but God is the one that's raised us but
[2:00:45] raise us up and made us who we are today
[2:00:47] the Lord that did that thing you could
[2:00:49] do it in your own strength a man you
[2:00:51] didn't have the power to change yourself
[2:00:53] but God did it
[2:00:55] amen he's still working on me glory to
[2:00:59] God
[2:01:00] I'm picking up just here and actually
[2:01:01] start with X's 5 verse 1 & 2 and let me
[2:01:06] just we're gonna just read a couple
[2:01:07] scriptures here because this is a time
[2:01:10] where were the children of Israel about
[2:01:13] to leave Egypt that's why it's called
[2:01:15] exodus they're given had taken Exodus
[2:01:18] but when Moses is called on the backside
[2:01:20] of the desert and and and he goes back a
[2:01:23] man in to eat if he run from Egypt
[2:01:25] before but now he's going back into
[2:01:27] Egypt with a message from God and he's
[2:01:30] gonna tell Pharaoh let my people go and
[2:01:32] and as Moses is on his way back he meets
[2:01:35] his brother Aaron you know they're in
[2:01:37] the they're in the mountain and when
[2:01:40] Aaron meets them and he began to tell
[2:01:41] Aaron his testimony how he met God on
[2:01:44] the backside of desert air Aaron was
[2:01:46] just so excited they together went and
[2:01:48] told the elders of Israel and and when
[2:01:50] the elders of Israel heard how God had
[2:01:52] visited Moses they knew God had sent
[2:01:54] them a deliverer and they began to
[2:01:56] worship and to praise God because they
[2:01:58] said thank God he sent us a prophet I
[2:02:00] don't know why they stopped believing in
[2:02:03] the Prophet but there was a time where
[2:02:06] they did have complete faith that God
[2:02:08] had sent a prophet hallelujah now look
[2:02:13] at this in X's 5 just first one and two
[2:02:15] and after it Moses and Aaron went in and
[2:02:18] topher Oh thus saith the Lord God of
[2:02:21] Israel let my people go that they may
[2:02:25] hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
[2:02:27] and Pharaoh said who is the Lord that I
[2:02:32] should obey his voice to let let let
[2:02:34] Israel go I know not the Lord neither
[2:02:37] will I let Israel go you know as I look
[2:02:40] at that and I'm skipping over here to
[2:02:42] chapter 7 we're going to pick that up in
[2:02:44] a second but here you know Pharaoh is
[2:02:47] hearing this message coming from Moses
[2:02:49] and from Aaron and and his question is
[2:02:51] who is the Lord now now when he's asking
[2:02:54] that question to Moses God heard it and
[2:02:57] God was was very well equipped
[2:03:00] to be able to answer Pharaoh's question
[2:03:03] you want to know who I am I'm gonna show
[2:03:06] you who I am now that I'm gonna show you
[2:03:08] but I'm gonna show everybody in your
[2:03:09] kingdom Who I am I am that I am that's
[2:03:13] who sent Moses I'm gonna show Pharoah
[2:03:15] who I am you want to know who the Lord
[2:03:17] is you're gonna see who the Lord is and
[2:03:19] every time a plague dropped
[2:03:21] Pharaoh began to recognize who the Lord
[2:03:24] was it's he answered his question got
[2:03:28] answered but I'm gonna tell you it
[2:03:29] wasn't answered by Moses the Lord did
[2:03:33] that thing you want to ask him Moses the
[2:03:36] question you ask you is asking God the
[2:03:38] question God was there in Moses Oh
[2:03:44] hallelujah how can I say that well
[2:03:47] Exodus 7 this is what we read at the
[2:03:50] beginning
[2:03:50] look at this exercise I said the Lord
[2:03:53] said unto Moses see I have made thee a
[2:03:56] god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother
[2:04:01] shall be that prophet now I'm making you
[2:04:03] God Moses you you are God in this
[2:04:07] situation sometimes we don't know who we
[2:04:09] are you know the Prophet had a little
[2:04:14] situation at home he said this people
[2:04:17] coming from all over the place and and
[2:04:19] the kids got in a little they were just
[2:04:22] fighting and just running around the
[2:04:23] house and just doing a bunch of stuff
[2:04:25] saying his wife was just frantic and you
[2:04:28] know just need to do so much in the
[2:04:30] house and but people come in just in and
[2:04:32] out they're like the out just don't know
[2:04:33] what to do so they went into the kitchen
[2:04:36] they saw his wife washing the dishes and
[2:04:38] and the kids running around and doing
[2:04:40] all day and they just just driving up
[2:04:42] crazy so he went into the kitchen and he
[2:04:44] saw getting dishes and so he grabbed the
[2:04:46] apron and he put on the apron I'm
[2:04:48] talking to some brothers in here I'm
[2:04:51] talking right now and he grabbed the
[2:04:53] apron he put on the apron and when he
[2:04:55] put on the apron
[2:04:57] he started washing the dishes with his
[2:04:59] wife and when they start washing the
[2:05:00] dishes with her he noticed that the

[2:05:30] when he did that y'all get y'all good I
[2:05:32] can get I got time to read a quote but
[2:05:34] you can it's in there he said he
[2:05:37] said I became God to the situation I
[2:05:43] took control my actions the way I
[2:05:46] handled myself
[2:05:47] I became God to that situation not only
[2:05:51] he said you know we stopped there him
[2:05:53] becoming God in this household
[2:05:55] now take it further you can become God
[2:05:58] on your child do you become God in
[2:06:03] school you can become God wherever God
[2:06:06] need you to be God the Lord said unto
[2:06:14] Moses see I have Maivia God not not not
[2:06:20] for you to be worshipped that's not what
[2:06:22] we're talking about that's not I
[2:06:24] mean this is a person that can take
[2:06:25] control over the situation
[2:06:27] I have Maivia got you ain't got to be
[2:06:31] running around and frantic like
[2:06:32] everybody else tell everybody to calm
[2:06:34] down relax we got this we got this he
[2:06:40] said he says and I have made thee a god
[2:06:42] to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall
[2:06:44] be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that
[2:06:48] I command thee and this is a key part I
[2:06:51] shall speak all that I command thee and
[2:06:53] Aaron thy brother shall speak in the
[2:06:54] Pharaoh that he send the children Israel
[2:06:56] out of his land
[2:06:57] now when Moses went down there a man
[2:07:00] into Egypt everything that he did every
[2:07:05] plague that was what was was given in
[2:07:07] Egypt it wasn't because Moses came up
[2:07:10] with the idea oh I hope y'all get this
[2:07:13] it wasn't because Moses sat around and
[2:07:16] think of this you know what tomorrow I
[2:07:18] think I'm gonna turn that river into
[2:07:20] blood
[2:07:22] and you know he not gonna listen anyway
[2:07:26] this not Moses thinking he not gonna
[2:07:29] listen anywhere and so after I finished
[2:07:31] blood you know then I think I'm gonna
[2:07:33] call for some frogs and he gonna he's
[2:07:36] not gonna believe that so I think imma
[2:07:37] do this
[2:07:38] that was not Moses thoughts I want you
[2:07:42] to understand that those were God's
[2:07:45] thoughts and what he had to tell mostly
[2:07:48] Moses now I'm gonna sing you but I'm
[2:07:51] gonna get in you and I want you to come
[2:07:53] everything I tell you to tell a pharaoh
[2:07:55] I want you to do it I'm commanding you I
[2:07:58] want to say something that business I
[2:08:01] did that came out of nowhere it won
[2:08:04] yours God did that thing God God did
[2:08:15] that thing and and there's a lot of
[2:08:17] things that are happening
[2:08:18] amen and your life you don't have no
[2:08:20] idea that God is behind it
[2:08:22] sometimes God is positionally placing
[2:08:25] you into certain situations because he's
[2:08:27] trying to reach somebody he need you to
[2:08:29] be there to reach him so before a plague
[2:08:34] dropped God had to give Moses the
[2:08:38] thought so before a frog could come God
[2:08:41] had to tell Moses to call for the frogs
[2:08:43] right I mean you know before the lights
[2:08:45] could come God had to tell Moses to come
[2:08:47] for the lights a man before the cattle
[2:08:50] could be destroyed God had to tell Moses
[2:08:52] amen the car for the cattle be destroyed
[2:08:54] God had to tell Moses to do it all he
[2:08:57] could not do anything until God showed
[2:08:58] him the same way it was with Jesus
[2:09:01] couldn't do anything to God show them
[2:09:03] you can't do nothing to God show you
[2:09:06] and when God shows you gonna give him
[2:09:09] glory God did that thing
[2:09:19] Moses would make God the Pharaoh and
[2:09:21] Aaron was made a prophet he was
[2:09:23] commanded to speak all that God had
[2:09:26] commanded him
[2:09:27] now also Ephesians I mean exit 6-3 said
[2:09:30] that Moses had not known God a man as
[2:09:34] Jehovah had not known a man's Jehovah so
[2:09:37] when Moses called for frogs and lice and
[2:09:40] flies and locusts that was the spoken
[2:09:42] word coming out of Moses mouth
[2:09:45] hallelujah
[2:09:47] Moses knew him as Jehovah Moses not only
[2:09:49] called for but but even sometime the
[2:09:51] Egyptians and then that they're
[2:09:52] magicians would come out and they were
[2:09:54] trying to call for things to but but
[2:09:56] Moses had the power not only just to
[2:09:58] cover for it he had the power to loose
[2:10:00] it and he also had the power to find it
[2:10:02] so he knew when he's in feresten I'll
[2:10:04] take it away from him
[2:10:05] only Moses could take it away guess what
[2:10:08] you got that same power to bind and to
[2:10:11] loose Oh hallelujah
[2:10:14] Moses knew messenger over Moses
[2:10:16] demonstrated the power to bind and loose
[2:10:18] now this is the one that I want y'all
[2:10:20] against just just just stay with me on
[2:10:22] this Oh hallelujah hallelujah there was
[2:10:29] a man in Moton and Exodus 9 we don't
[2:10:33] start reading from verse 1 there exodus
[2:10:36] 9 Moses was calling for these different
[2:10:40] things to come and plague Egypt there
[2:10:43] was 10 plagues that struck Egypt but it
[2:10:46] was God and Moses doing all that God was
[2:10:49] doing this thing it wasn't Moses doing
[2:10:51] it I want to tell you another thing even
[2:10:53] when it comes to the prophet and we just
[2:10:56] look at different testimonies and
[2:10:58] different things that happen his
[2:10:59] ministry it was not brother Branham
[2:11:01] doing it it was God doing that thing I
[2:11:05] was I was just thinking back to my cell
[2:11:08] phone on the little boy that God gave
[2:11:09] him a vision of a little boy being
[2:11:11] healed got hit by a car was going to be
[2:11:12] healed and and years went by before that
[2:11:15] before that became a manifestation he
[2:11:17] happened to be in Miami Florida
[2:11:18] preaching and somebody said is this the
[2:11:20] boy brother Branson no that ain't the
[2:11:21] boy the scenery ain't right that ain't
[2:11:23] the boy that's not the boy we can pray
[2:11:25] for him but that's not the boy that I
[2:11:26] saw in my vision and there you happen to
[2:11:28] be in Finland and and and they're in the
[2:11:31] service and and
[2:11:32] at the end of the service here this boy
[2:11:34] got hit by a car and brother branham was
[2:11:36] walking away and everybody told him
[2:11:38] exactly what happened and he went up
[2:11:39] there to the situation to just overlook
[2:11:41] it's it's just awful the word of Prayer
[2:11:43] and he turn and start walking when he
[2:11:44] held he felt a hand touched him on the
[2:11:46] shoulder turn around and go back now
[2:11:48] that just lets you know as a man he had
[2:11:52] nothing to do with this he forgot about
[2:11:53] it himself
[2:11:55] so here the angel or I have to stop him
[2:11:57] and say turn around look at that
[2:12:00] situation again and when they look to
[2:12:02] start looking around at the seniors say
[2:12:03] look in your Bibles didn't we write this
[2:12:05] down thank God tell us the right to stop
[2:12:07] he say oh this is the scene this is this
[2:12:09] is the boy that's supposed to be raised
[2:12:11] from the day and when it when he caught
[2:12:13] that he was actually inside a vision oh
[2:12:15] my god one day you're gonna catch that
[2:12:18] you are actually inside the vision
[2:12:20] you're gonna realize it's not your doing
[2:12:22] it is God doing it God showed it God did
[2:12:26] it God get the glory for everything
[2:12:30] brother branham realization I say okay
[2:12:33] let's pray me pray for the boy and God
[2:12:35] raised that boy up but the other part
[2:12:37] that God didn't show him in the vision
[2:12:39] that there was another boy that was
[2:12:41] gonna be hit at the same time and when
[2:12:45] that boy got hit the mama the mama and
[2:12:47] daddy said that boy was prayed for and
[2:12:49] raised up pray for our boy then he'd get
[2:12:51] up brother BAM said God showed me that
[2:12:53] earlier and that's why he was prayed for
[2:12:55] but God never showed me nothing about
[2:12:56] you he said well no we pretty much we
[2:12:59] can't accept that we want you to pray
[2:13:01] fire boy and raise him up like he did
[2:13:02] that boy I can't do that God had already
[2:13:05] got God got proved that he was going to
[2:13:07] do it through a vision they say uh
[2:13:09] I'll pray and we'll see what the Lord
[2:13:11] saying and as he was praying the angel
[2:13:13] Lord came to him and told him about some
[2:13:15] candy that he needed to eat and he saw a
[2:13:18] flower a man and one flower they were
[2:13:21] drooping and then one flower stood up he
[2:13:23] said they knew that was the boy I was
[2:13:24] here but the other thought I was still
[2:13:26] grouping
[2:13:26] say it kind of came him up and didn't
[2:13:28] went back down and he said he said he
[2:13:30] said what the angel said now the other
[2:13:32] boys that other flower that's going back
[2:13:33] down saying now you have to eat this
[2:13:35] candy if you want that boy to be healed
[2:13:37] oh my say some things you might have to
[2:13:42] go through
[2:13:43] on behalf of somebody else Oh Church
[2:13:48] things you might have to go through on
[2:13:50] behalf of somebody else so you say now
[2:13:52] you have to eat the can fruit he had two
[2:13:54] pieces of candy one piece of canvas a
[2:13:55] man that was best can he ever had in his
[2:13:57] life then he ate it real quick he said
[2:13:59] not eat that other piece of candy and
[2:14:01] when he ate the other piece of candy say
[2:14:03] it was some of the worst tasting candy
[2:14:05] he said soon as he put in his mouth he
[2:14:07] wanted to spit it out and he just said
[2:14:08] no that other boy gonna live until you
[2:14:11] finish the candy he finished the candy
[2:14:14] and after he ate it he saw the flower
[2:14:16] come back up he called her mom at the
[2:14:18] hospital say dust at the Lord you're
[2:14:20] gonna leave but didn't tell her mama he
[2:14:22] had to do something bitter oh come on
[2:14:25] y'all
[2:14:26] you might have to do something that's
[2:14:27] very bitter to you but it'll bring life
[2:14:30] to somebody else Jesus went to a bit
[2:14:33] across but look at the life that we all
[2:14:35] received
[2:14:43] Exodus 9 let's bring it home
[2:14:47] this is the plague of the cattle and God
[2:14:51] was always separating you know he
[2:14:53] started separating certain things that
[2:14:54] were hit the Egyptians but with not hit
[2:14:57] those that were living in Goshen listen
[2:15:00] then the Lord said unto Moses go in unto
[2:15:04] Pharaoh
[2:15:04] tell him thus saith the Lord God of the
[2:15:07] Hebrews let my people go that they may
[2:15:09] serve benign Pharaoh and got the same
[2:15:11] question who is the Lord he don't have
[2:15:14] some experience now with God so he know
[2:15:16] that God is real right now look at look
[2:15:19] at this it says for if thou refuse to
[2:15:21] let them go and we'll hold them still
[2:15:24] the hold the hand the Lord is upon thy
[2:15:26] cattle which is in the field upon the
[2:15:30] horses upon the asses upon the camels
[2:15:33] upon the oxen and upon the sheep there
[2:15:35] shall be a very Grievous moraine and the
[2:15:38] Lord shall sever between the cattle of
[2:15:40] Israel and the count of Egypt and there
[2:15:42] shall nothing die of all that is the
[2:15:44] that is the children of Israel children
[2:15:47] of Israel and the Lord appointed a set
[2:15:49] time saying tomorrow the Lord shall do
[2:15:52] this thing in the land and the Lord did
[2:15:57] that thing y'all thought I just came up
[2:15:59] with that did y'all and the Lord did
[2:16:06] that thing hallelujah
[2:16:16] won't he do it
[2:16:18] [Laughter]
[2:16:21] right there your Bible and the Lord did
[2:16:25] that thing on the morrow and all the
[2:16:29] cattle of Egypt died but of the cattle
[2:16:33] the children of Israel died not one and
[2:16:35] Pharaoh sent and behold there was not
[2:16:37] one of the cattle the Israelites dead
[2:16:40] and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened
[2:16:43] and he did not let the people go but
[2:16:45] every time is hard his heart got
[2:16:47] hardened it was God actually allowing
[2:16:49] that to happen because God has some old
[2:16:52] things that he wanted to do
[2:16:57] so sometimes you'd be going through some
[2:16:59] stuff and you don't know why you're
[2:17:00] going through that it's the Lord that
[2:17:02] did that thing it's the Lord that
[2:17:04] allowed that thing you just go through
[2:17:08] it joint and watch him just just unfold
[2:17:12] every attribute that was him
[2:17:14] that was in him before the foundation
[2:17:15] where he gonna express that to you but
[2:17:18] let God do what God does hallelujah
[2:17:21] hallelujah let me just finish off with
[2:17:25] reading a little quote here a man a man
[2:17:32] y'all got time for two quotes and I
[2:17:35] finish right here I'm like this is gonna
[2:17:37] be the pergamene church age paragraph
[2:17:40] 172 - to 172 - - says this note is the
[2:17:48] harmony of the Father and the Son Jesus
[2:17:51] never did anything until it was first
[2:17:53] showed him by the father John 5:19 this
[2:17:58] harmony is now to exist between the
[2:18:02] groom and his bride he shows her his
[2:18:05] word of life she receives it she never
[2:18:08] down stood there for nothing can harm
[2:18:11] her not even death but if the seat be
[2:18:13] planted the water will raise it up again
[2:18:16] here is the secret of this the word is
[2:18:19] in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride
[2:18:23] has the mind of Christ but she knows
[2:18:25] what he wants done with the word she
[2:18:26] performs the command of the word in his
[2:18:28] name for she has us at the Lord then the
[2:18:32] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[2:18:33] comes to pass like a seed that is more
[2:18:35] planted and watered it comes to full
[2:18:38] harvest serving its purpose and then
[2:18:41] those in the bride do only his will no
[2:18:44] one can make them do otherwise they have
[2:18:47] thus saith the Lord they keep still the
[2:18:50] reason they do this because the Lord is
[2:18:51] doing that thing right they know it has
[2:18:53] to be God in them doing the works
[2:18:56] fulfilling his own word he did not
[2:18:59] complete all his works while in his
[2:19:01] earthly minister so now he works in and
[2:19:03] through the bride that's what he did
[2:19:04] with the disciples when he went there to
[2:19:07] the gate the the gate called beautiful
[2:19:08] he's left
[2:19:09] that situation for those disciples God
[2:19:11] has allowed some situations in this
[2:19:13] world for us common present-day
[2:19:16] disciples we got to take care of but
[2:19:19] it's not us doing it it's God in us
[2:19:21] doing it and we gave him the glory God
[2:19:23] did that thing she knows that for what
[2:19:27] for it was not yet time for him to do
[2:19:29] certain things that he must now do but
[2:19:31] he will now fulfill through the bride
[2:19:33] that work which he left for this
[2:19:35] specific time church we've been reading
[2:19:38] his quotes for years but we got to take
[2:19:40] him to the streets can I read one more
[2:19:44] for you the deity of Jesus Christ look
[2:19:49] at this I just you know I just I just
[2:19:52] I'm encouraged by the Word of God says
[2:19:55] this is the deity of him who is he
[2:19:57] some of them thinks him a little a
[2:20:00] little baby back there he's the one that
[2:20:02] stood on the invisible oh my platform
[2:20:05] reached out his hands and spoke said let
[2:20:08] there be light and there was light that
[2:20:11] was Jesus Christ but he was in the world
[2:20:14] and the world was made by him in the
[2:20:16] world recognized him not he was and he
[2:20:19] is the deity of God look what he did
[2:20:22] back there talk about the miraculous
[2:20:24] back there you talk about shouting when
[2:20:27] he performed there were miraculous
[2:20:29] things to make things which are now out
[2:20:31] of things which was not he spoke and it
[2:20:33] was so and that same power that same
[2:20:37] Christ hallelujah let the fundamentalist
[2:20:40] let them people who deny the power of
[2:20:41] God say it's wrong but that same power
[2:20:44] that spoke the world into existence is
[2:20:47] in those people that's got the Holy
[2:20:49] Ghost
[2:20:50] that's right men and women it's time

[2:22:56] the rest of us that's coming here sick
[2:22:58] every week come on we are that we ought
[2:23:01] to say no no no no no no no no and and I
[2:23:04] can take I mean God you are his bride he
[2:23:10] wants to do more for you than you even
[2:23:11] ever imagine
[2:23:13] look at this you cannot be saved only by
[2:23:17] accepting Christ by the Holy Spirit if
[2:23:20] he's in you he's the power of God live
[2:23:22] by it
[2:23:23] he's God in you the Bible said we think
[2:23:27] God is upon me o God Jesus said the
[2:23:29] Pharisees answered said you make
[2:23:31] yourself God said isn't it written in
[2:23:35] your law ye are gods that's what jesus
[2:23:38] answered and he goes on saying he made
[2:23:40] Moses they got to Pharaoh once and he
[2:23:46] made you a god to the people
[2:23:53] I want I want that to sink in he made
[2:23:56] Moses but God to Pharaoh once and he
[2:24:03] made you a god to the people see the
[2:24:08] only god they're gonna see is the god
[2:24:10] that's inside of you
[2:24:11] the only hands God got are your hands
[2:24:14] the only feet God has are your feet the
[2:24:18] only mouth that God has is your mouth
[2:24:21] church it's time to yield a god and
[2:24:24] allow him to get all the glory and all
[2:24:26] the honor
[2:24:26] out of these 16 elements he made Moses
[2:24:32] God to Pharaoh once and he made you a
[2:24:37] god to the people that's right and you
[2:24:41] this morning are written epistles of God
[2:24:43] your lives are of God and even carries
[2:24:47] that Holy Ghost look dear friends don't
[2:24:50] let it pass don't let this go by that's
[2:24:53] just a little mythical something will
[2:24:56] you do that
[2:24:57] I pray you receive it if he could tell
[2:25:01] Moses I'm making you a god to Pharaoh
[2:25:03] made him a god to that man made him that
[2:25:07] way as sons of God we've been made in
[2:25:10] His image and their situations all
[2:25:12] around us on a daily basis that God
[2:25:15] needs some God to take could take
[2:25:17] control or you know when he told Moses
[2:25:20] to take those children of Israel out
[2:25:21] there to the on the journey and take
[2:25:25] them back to take him to the promised
[2:25:26] land and they come up to the Red Sea
[2:25:28] Moses got the crime lord what shall I do
[2:25:32] and say brother branham's say when moses
[2:25:35] got the crown said God was going over to
[2:25:37] sit down and as he was on his way to sit
[2:25:39] down he heard Moses crying what shall I
[2:25:41] do
[2:25:42] and it says Moses Moses what's your
[2:25:44] crying father and told you everything
[2:25:46] just say whatever whatever coming your
[2:25:48] way you just speak to it don't don't
[2:25:51] don't cry to me don't do it at he say
[2:25:53] you just be you just handle it Moses and
[2:25:55] let me tell you God trying to tell some
[2:25:57] of y'all handle me
[2:26:03] even as even as SS test as parents when
[2:26:07] our kids could have a certain age we
[2:26:08] looked for them to be able to handle
[2:26:09] some things spiritually we got to grow
[2:26:13] up because God is looking for us to
[2:26:14] handle some things we got to be about
[2:26:16] the Father's business when moses got the
[2:26:21] crying and god sitting on our mother
[2:26:23] stopped crying you know you speak and
[2:26:24] moses spoke something that he didn't
[2:26:28] even he couldn't even think he just say
[2:26:30] the egyptians that you have seen the day
[2:26:31] you'll see him no more forever didn't
[2:26:34] know how that was gonna happen but he
[2:26:36] spoke it and then he let God take care
[2:26:38] of the rest time and when he spoke it
[2:26:40] God said and I take your rod and just
[2:26:42] stretch it out over the water I
[2:26:44] stretched it out a water party children
[2:26:46] Israel start crossing on the dry ground
[2:26:48] it's man they was just rejoicing thank
[2:26:50] God but but then they start realizing
[2:26:52] man Pharaoh's arm is coming round and as
[2:26:54] they were pharaoh say well oh you know
[2:26:57] he had a question who was the Lord he
[2:26:59] wanted to know who is the Lord when we
[2:27:01] come down there now and that in that the
[2:27:03] same little parting of the Red Sea he
[2:27:05] found out who the law it was because his
[2:27:10] army didn't make it through the Red Sea
[2:27:11] they got drowned can I tell y'all
[2:27:13] something God will drown your enemies
[2:27:20] you won't see them again
[2:27:24] he can drown it amen but I tell you what
[2:27:28] before you do that before he does
[2:27:29] they're gonna challenge your face and
[2:27:30] you got to rise up and be who God's call
[2:27:33] you be give God the praise cuz it's the
[2:27:35] Lord that did that thing hallelujah
[2:27:41] glory it's the Lord that did that thing
[2:27:45] whatever it is that God has brought you
[2:27:48] through it's the Lord that innit amen we
[2:27:50] can't take any glory nope no glory at
[2:27:52] all for ourselves is God that is doing
[2:27:54] it let's pray father we thank you for
[2:27:56] your word that comes to our heart today
[2:27:59] we realize it's nobody but you God the
[2:28:05] summarizer said when we were in trouble
[2:28:07] you came to our rescue when God just
[2:28:10] seemed like everything was against us
[2:28:12] you made a way where there was no way
[2:28:14] you opened up doors that we could see
[2:28:16] here and I missed we've seen healings
[2:28:19] take place we knows nothing that you got
[2:28:20] and Lord as we go out with face the
[2:28:23] enemy the same way Moses was anointed to
[2:28:26] speak to his enemy at that time Lord
[2:28:29] will be anointed to speak to our enemy
[2:28:32] today we're not to take thought as to
[2:28:34] what we're gonna say we're not to take
[2:28:36] thought of that but we know that you
[2:28:37] would anoint us at the proper time God
[2:28:41] you give us mouth and the Bible said
[2:28:43] you'll give us wisdom and Lord as you
[2:28:45] give us these things then we have what
[2:28:46] we need in order to overcome the enemy
[2:28:48] so Lord we we want to just give you the
[2:28:51] praise we realize that it's not us it's
[2:28:54] certainly not us God that has done any
[2:28:57] distinct but you have done all things
[2:28:59] and you've done it well so Lord we pray
[2:29:01] that this won't just be something that
[2:29:04] goes in when they're not the other but
[2:29:06] Lord let us realize that there are some
[2:29:08] situations that you're calling us into
[2:29:10] just as you call Moses into and you want
[2:29:13] us to be gawked to the circumstance Lord
[2:29:16] not crying not a complaining not
[2:29:19] wandering over to be God and to speak
[2:29:22] because it's through the spoken word
[2:29:24] that things change this whole earth was
[2:29:28] changed because you spoke out of your
[2:29:30] mouth
[2:29:30] let there be stuff we have something
[2:29:32] that with
[2:29:33] fighting something that was struggling
[2:29:34] it's your word god that's going to make
[2:29:36] a difference and your word will come
[2:29:38] forth out of our mouths we yield
[2:29:40] ourselves to you my prayer is that you
[2:29:43] will feel every every person with the
[2:29:45] Holy Ghost and God every fiber of our
[2:29:47] being will be filled with your spirit
