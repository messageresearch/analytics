[0:45] outer man may cry, may weep, may be
[0:48] tired sometime, Lord Jesus. But if we

[2:45] remember, probably wasn't that long ago,
[2:47] we prayed for a brother. Um, his name
[2:50] was Doc. We prayed for him. He, uh, he's
[2:52] out in Fort Pierce. He had a stroke. Um,
[2:55] and just it's it's just miraculous. Just

[3:50] sweet the
[3:52] [Laughter]
[3:53] [Music]
[3:54] sound that
[3:59] saved a
[4:03] rich like me.
[4:10] I
[4:13] once was
[4:17] lost but
[4:21] now I'm found.
[4:27] was
[4:30] blind,
[4:31] but
[4:34] now I
[4:38] see. We're going to praise
[4:41] God. Praise
[4:45] God. Praise
[4:50] God.
[4:51] Praise God.
[4:55] Praise

[5:49] [Applause]
[5:52] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[5:54] God bless you, brother. Hope everyone
[5:56] has had a wonderful week. Amen. Uh in
[6:00] the Lord to know that you're um being a
[6:03] special chosen generation uh the apple
[6:06] of God's eyes. You know, there's there's
[6:09] lots of people on this earth that would
[6:11] love to have a relationship with God and
[6:13] to know God. Um, and I like how we are
[6:17] special because God chases after us. We
[6:20] don't have to go chasing after him.
[6:23] Uh I remember I was watching this uh
[6:26] this reel of this Indian guy and he's
[6:28] very devoted to his religion where I
[6:30] think he'll bow down and do certain
[6:32] rituals and he's over 100 years old and
[6:35] and he it has so much sincerity and I'll
[6:39] have to say that my sincerity isn't
[6:40] always like that with God you know but
[6:42] the difference that we have is the grace
[6:44] of God in our life not dependent upon
[6:47] our sincerity not dependent upon how
[6:49] much we know of God not dependent upon
[6:51] how much how good we are. I like to
[6:53] think about the prodical son uh that
[6:56] left his home, right? God had given him
[6:58] his inheritance and he lost it. Left his
[7:00] home and came back in the state where he
[7:02] didn't even know who he was. And uh um
[7:05] his his father said, "Cut the get the
[7:08] fattest cattle for him." Right? So I
[7:10] thank God for the grace he's given us in
[7:12] this hour that is not dependent upon our
[7:14] knowledge, how good we are of anything,
[7:16] but just God has this love that chases
[7:19] after us. Amen. So, let's go before the
[7:23] Lord in prayer before we start the word.
[7:26] Uh Lord Jesus, we want to thank you, oh
[7:28] Lord God, for this um monumental
[7:31] opportunity, oh Lord Jesus Christ, to
[7:33] come before you, oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[7:35] and just to worship you, oh Lord God. Oh
[7:38] Lord, it wasn't us going looking for
[7:40] you, oh Lord Jesus Christ, but it was
[7:42] you chasing after us, oh Lord God. Lord,
[7:45] in our laziness and our ignorance, oh
[7:47] Lord God, and our not understanding, oh
[7:49] Lord, and just living in the world,
[7:51] waking up and going to sleep and living
[7:53] in the world, waking up and going to
[7:55] sleep, oh Lord God, without any
[7:57] knowledge of your word, your truth, who
[8:00] you are, what you had done on the cross,
[8:02] oh Lord, we were ignorant of all of it,
[8:04] oh Lord God, but before the foundation
[8:07] of the world, Lord God, you had a
[8:10] thought in your head, oh Lord Jesus
[8:11] Christ, and it wasn't just a thought. It
[8:14] was individuals you had in your mind. Oh
[8:17] Lord Jesus Christ, the prophet said
[8:19] before we started on this journey of the
[8:22] earth. Oh Lord God, Lord, you saw all of
[8:24] our strengths. Oh Lord God, you saw all
[8:26] of our peculiarities, our personality.
[8:29] Oh Lord, but the prophet said you saw
[8:31] our weaknesses. Oh Lord God, Lord, you
[8:33] saw our struggles. Oh Lord God, you saw
[8:35] our all of the weaknesses that we had in
[8:38] the insignificant strength. Lord God,
[8:40] and the prophet said that you still
[8:42] chose us, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[8:45] even before the foundation of the world,
[8:47] we didn't even have a say in it. Oh Lord
[8:49] Jesus Christ. So Lord, we just want to
[8:52] thank you for this grace. Oh Lord God,
[8:54] that Lord, you would bring us to this
[8:56] point in time. Oh Lord God, the prophet
[8:58] said if you could live in any age, oh
[9:00] Lord God, this is the age that he would
[9:02] live in, oh Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord,
[9:04] we want to thank you, oh Lord God,
[9:06] before the blending of eternity. Oh
[9:07] Lord, that we get a chance to experience
[9:10] the outpour, the overflow of revelation
[9:13] of physical blessing. Oh Lord, that you
[9:15] will you'll lift us up like Joseph was.
[9:18] Oh Lord God, you'll lift us up above a
[9:20] many brethren. Oh Lord God, because
[9:22] we're your favorite, oh Lord Jesus
[9:24] Christ. Lord, we just want to thank you
[9:26] for this opportunity, oh Lord God. Lord,
[9:28] let the people know, oh Lord God, that
[9:30] they're healing, oh Lord God, the things
[9:33] they're looking for, oh Lord, the
[9:34] struggles are, the the loved ones
[9:36] they're praying for, oh Lord God. Lord,
[9:38] we can accomplish all of these things
[9:40] just because you love us, oh Lord God.
[9:42] Oh Lord, if we would just love you more,
[9:44] oh Lord Jesus Christ, it would produce
[9:46] faith, oh Lord God. It'll produce hope,
[9:49] oh Lord God, and make these things
[9:51] tangible to us, oh Lord. So Lord, help
[9:54] us to love you, oh Lord, like you love
[9:56] us, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Give us more
[9:58] of your spirit, oh Lord. Give us more of
[10:00] your understanding, oh Lord. Give us
[10:02] more of faith, oh Lord God. We may not
[10:04] have all the answers, oh Lord God. And
[10:06] it's so hard to live in that space, but
[10:08] we still have love, oh Lord God, where
[10:10] we can trust you, oh Lord God. Lord, I
[10:12] ask that you'll bless your people and
[10:14] bless this word, oh Lord, as it be
[10:15] delivered, oh Lord. May may the word be
[10:17] a seed inside their hearts, oh Lord God,
[10:19] that of something they're expecting from
[10:21] you, oh Lord, so they can see the fruit
[10:23] of the seed, oh Lord, in the precious
[10:24] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[10:27] Hallelujah. Amen. So, we'll begin right
[10:30] into the message. Um the title that the
[10:33] message gave me is why we believe in one
[10:36] God. Right. Um in this end time,
[10:40] revelation has been restored back to us.
[10:42] So, it's always important for us to
[10:45] realize the things that the prophet
[10:47] brought out because it helps us in our
[10:49] everyday lives, both physical and and in
[10:51] the spiritual. So, we're going to start
[10:53] our journey in uh John chapter 1. uh
[10:57] reading verses uh
[10:58] 1-2 and then we'll skip down to verses
[11:01] 12-
[11:06] 14. All right. And it reads, "In the
[11:10] beginning was the word, and the word was
[11:12] with God, and the word was God. The same
[11:15] was in the beginning with God." And in
[11:18] verse 12 to 14 it reads, "But as many as
[11:21] received him, to them gave he power to
[11:23] become the sons of God, even to them
[11:25] that believe on his name, which were
[11:27] born not of blood, nor of the will of
[11:29] the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[11:31] of God. And the word was made flesh and
[11:34] dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory,
[11:36] the glory as of the begotten of the
[11:38] father, full of grace and truth." And
[11:40] you may uh take your seats as we
[11:43] continue on. Um, so if you can pull the
[11:47] John uh first John the first verse back
[11:49] up there just so we can kind of uh build
[11:52] a foundation for what we're trying to uh
[11:54] uh discuss about with the um why we
[11:57] believe in having one God and the
[11:59] importance of believing in in uh one
[12:01] God. So I like how in this uh in this
[12:04] first verse it says um John says the uh
[12:09] uh notice that he has uh this word right
[12:11] here which is a word that's capitalized
[12:14] right and it's capitalized just as long
[12:17] just with along with the word God is
[12:18] capitalized right to show the equality
[12:22] between these two things right to show
[12:24] that they're not different but they are
[12:25] the same right so you can't separate God
[12:28] from his word right and we love that
[12:32] because the prophet said if you're going
[12:33] if God has given you a promise, right?
[12:36] You can bind God by his word. Right?
[12:39] Now, this is not language that everybody
[12:41] has because a lot of times people love
[12:43] to just, well, I'm just hoping God would
[12:45] do something for me. I'm just hoping God
[12:46] to heal me. I'm just hoping God a
[12:48] blessing. But if God has given you a
[12:50] word, you can go to God, bind him up,
[12:53] and say, Lord, this is your word. And
[12:55] force him to do what he promised he
[12:57] would do for you. Right? God loves to be
[13:00] challenged by his word to prove his
[13:02] words are the truth. Right? And I like
[13:06] here how you notice that word. It's not
[13:08] words even though there are a lot there
[13:10] are a lot of words in the Bible but we
[13:12] just see this word just meaning it's a a
[13:15] singular collective thought from a
[13:17] single source. Right? If you would have
[13:19] added a s on to the end it would have
[13:21] plurized it meaning more than one.
[13:24] Right? So the Bible is here showing us
[13:26] the importance for us to have one word
[13:28] from one source, right? And a word is
[13:32] very very important. Um I remember when
[13:35] I was living in Virginia and I was
[13:37] staying with my dad and my grandpa, my
[13:39] grandpa used to tell me something cuz he
[13:41] would ask me to do something and when if
[13:43] I didn't do it, he would get on me about
[13:45] it cuz he always tell me he says, you
[13:46] know, you know, as a man, you ain't
[13:48] nothing without your word. All right?
[13:51] You can be you can have a nice job and a
[13:53] nice car and you can be a wonderful
[13:56] person, but if you can't keep your word,
[13:58] you don't amount to nothing. And there
[14:01] was some real wisdom in what way he told
[14:03] me that, right, that we can we can see
[14:05] today because we're made in the image of
[14:07] God, right? We're made in God's image.
[14:10] So that means that our word has to be
[14:12] just as solid as God's word, right? And
[14:15] so I remember the one this one time uh
[14:18] Lil Xander um his birthday was coming up
[14:21] and I had promised him that I was going
[14:23] to give him a present and I believe it
[14:25] was a Wednesday I said I was going to
[14:27] give it to him and he was just ready to
[14:29] get this present and I totally forgot
[14:31] about that and he looked so distraught
[14:34] right it just did something to my heart.
[14:37] So then the following Sunday that came
[14:39] up there, I done forgot it again. But I
[14:42] said, "This time I have to find a way to
[14:44] get this thing to him." Right? Because
[14:47] that image of how sad he was because he
[14:49] was dependent upon what I said. That did
[14:52] something to me, right? So I remember I
[14:55] was on Saturday morning before church. I
[14:56] said, "Hey, I if I got to be late cuz um
[14:59] I was late to the Sunday school." And
[15:01] they didn't they didn't know that
[15:02] because I was going I went to this
[15:04] Walmart. I couldn't find what he was
[15:05] looking for. Then I drove all the way on
[15:08] the other side and I finally found I
[15:10] said, "Okay, now I got it." And that
[15:11] made me feel good because now I can keep
[15:14] my word to brother Xander, right? So
[15:17] when I told those words to brother
[15:18] Xander, you know what happened was he
[15:21] put all his feelings, right? His
[15:24] feelings, his sight, his touch, his
[15:26] hearing, which is the body, right? Then
[15:28] he put all of his emotions, his
[15:30] reasoning, his intellig, which
[15:32] intelligence, which is the spirit. Yes,
[15:33] sir. And then down in the soul he has
[15:35] something called faith. And he believed
[15:37] in that thing. And so what had happened
[15:39] was he stood on my words. What he was
[15:42] doing was standing on what I had said.
[15:44] Yes sir. Right. And uh and I have failed
[15:47] him because the Bible says, you know, uh
[15:49] let God's word be true. So I'm just a
[15:52] man and I can uh but the beautiful thing
[15:53] about a man is that you can redeem
[15:55] yourself. So I was able to redeem myself
[15:57] and eventually uh keep my word to him.
[16:00] But the opposite side of that thing is
[16:03] if I were to continually do that and
[16:06] disappoint him, what would happen is he
[16:08] would no longer trust in my word.
[16:11] He would lose complete confidence in me.
[16:14] And that's something God does not want
[16:17] us to feel about him, which is why he'll
[16:20] do whatever he can in order to give us
[16:22] the word that he had promised us. Right.
[16:26] Right. is it's a it's a simple concept
[16:29] but it's such it's such it's such a
[16:31] powerful uh uh uh thing. So because one
[16:34] of the powerful thing about words or
[16:36] word uh and it's actually what the
[16:38] original purpose of a word was was not
[16:40] just to provide meaning to things
[16:42] because words can provide meaning
[16:44] descriptions but a word was to provide
[16:46] stability. Right? The word was supposed
[16:49] to be something that's tangible that you
[16:51] can stand on. So even when the
[16:52] manifestation of something is not being
[16:54] seen, you can still stand. Which is why
[16:57] we love the word of God. God will give
[16:59] us the word and we may not feel it. We
[17:02] may may not be motivated. We may not
[17:04] understand when it's going to come to
[17:05] pass, how long it's going to take, but
[17:07] it's still something solid that you can
[17:09] stand on once you grasp it by faith.
[17:12] Right? So word provides stability. Which
[17:15] is why the problem we have today is that
[17:17] and we've already heard about this. It's
[17:19] so many voices in the world today. It's
[17:22] so many words. Everyone has a word. Uh
[17:25] um you know motivational speakers they
[17:27] have words about how you should get
[17:29] about your situation. You know someone
[17:31] says you need to exercise more. Somebody
[17:33] says you got to uh eat more healthy. All
[17:35] right. Uh if you go to a doctor, a
[17:37] doctor may say this make medication will
[17:39] help you. But if you go to another
[17:40] doctor and get a second opinion, they
[17:41] may say no that's going to hurt you. And
[17:43] so people are just all over the place.
[17:45] They don't know what to stand on because
[17:47] a word was made for somebody to stand.
[17:49] That's what God made words for, not just
[17:52] to be said, right? You know, in
[17:54] politics, you got the Republican party
[17:56] saying this thing and then the
[17:57] Democratic party saying this thing, and
[17:59] people just don't know what to believe,
[18:01] but they're looking for a word or a
[18:04] voice to be able to stand on because God
[18:06] created them to be that way. Right? So
[18:09] this leads us to our topic of the day as
[18:11] we're building this foundation because
[18:13] the word like I said before the word was
[18:14] restored to us in his last day and one
[18:17] of the problems that the early um well
[18:19] the church faced after the early church
[18:22] uh which was the early church was uh
[18:24] God's example of what a stable church
[18:27] was right after God uh died and rose
[18:30] again and gave the Holy Spirit and you
[18:32] saw the works during that age. That was
[18:34] God's example of what a stable church
[18:37] looked like and what he's expecting to
[18:38] see in this day and age, right? They
[18:42] were stable, right? But the problem is a
[18:45] lot of creeds crept into the church
[18:47] after that early church, which turned
[18:49] the church into a different image than
[18:51] what God had wanted it to be. And one of
[18:53] them nasty creeds was the creed of
[18:55] trinity, right? The creed of trinity.
[18:57] Trinity is slipped in somehow. And so
[19:00] we're going to turn to the message I
[19:01] will restore preached in 570
[19:04] uh
[19:05] 0309B to see how brother Brandham
[19:07] describes uh this uh trinity uh
[19:11] doctrine. And it's going to be
[19:12] paragraphs uh 31 through 33. So let me
[19:16] just get there real
[19:22] quick. Um give me one
[19:25] second. Okay. So it so it says here,
[19:30] this is going to be a a couple of
[19:31] paragraphs we're going to read, but we
[19:32] just want to build a foundation for what
[19:34] we're talking about. So here it says,
[19:35] "But they had the worship of one true
[19:37] God in that little faction. They set up
[19:39] in the program, which many of you
[19:41] historians know of making the Trinity
[19:43] three different gods. They had one God,
[19:46] the father, with a long beard. I've seen
[19:48] the pictures right at the Vatican. They
[19:49] had another one, God the Son, with a
[19:52] younger man and a little bird flying
[19:54] around like a dove called uh calling the
[19:56] Holy Ghost. They lost sight there of the
[19:59] true picture of the one true God. God is
[20:02] not three gods. God is one God. God has
[20:04] three offices, the Trinity, the Father,
[20:07] Son, and the Holy Ghost. But it isn't
[20:08] three different gods. If it is, we're
[20:11] pagan. But that never started in the
[20:13] early church. They know the different
[20:15] from that. So they were stable. They
[20:16] knew the difference between this thing.
[20:17] We couldn't pull that one on them. It
[20:19] started in the middle age when the unity
[20:21] of the brethren was broke up and love.
[20:24] And we want to remember that word unity,
[20:26] right? We all we we want to remember
[20:28] what unity uh uh means, which is a
[20:31] togetherness, right? Now, of course, we
[20:33] people today, we believe there's three,
[20:35] the father and the son and the holy
[20:36] ghost is the three persons of the one
[20:38] true god. It's three offices, not three
[20:40] gods. But that same listen now we think
[20:43] that was ridiculous in the Catholic
[20:44] church but we brought it right down here
[20:46] at Pentecost and tore yourself to pieces
[20:48] with it. Set up another organization
[20:51] started something else. Instead of
[20:53] coming like brethren with brotherly love
[20:55] and with unity, the first one began to
[20:57] see that that the three persons of the
[20:59] Godhead was in one person Christ Jesus.
[21:02] He was a manif manifestation of God and
[21:04] flesh not another man. And then you set
[21:06] up and got a little dogmatic idea of the
[21:08] oneness so-called. Then you started on
[21:11] that, began to harp on that and you made
[21:13] God one like your finger one. And you
[21:15] know that's wrong. You better scholars
[21:17] know better than that. But what was it?
[21:19] It was because the palmer worm began to
[21:21] eat first instead of setting and
[21:23] reasoning together. When I come into the
[21:24] factions of the Pentecostals, they set a
[21:27] bigger table and than that with their
[21:29] heads around you go, you go this and you
[21:31] can't go to this. You preach for them
[21:33] and you can't preach for me. So the
[21:35] prophet experienced during this time
[21:37] people trying to split him up. So if he
[21:41] said I wanted to go I would go I want I
[21:43] hey hey I want to go and talk and uh
[21:44] preach a message from this church. Well
[21:46] the faction over here would say hey if
[21:47] you do that you're not allowed to come
[21:48] and preach for us. So what they would do
[21:51] is that we know that brother Brandham
[21:53] represented the word. Well he he he
[21:56] brought the fullness of the word. God
[21:57] used him to bring the fullness of the
[21:58] word which was the word. And so the
[22:00] people were trying to separate the word,
[22:03] right? And you can't do that, right?
[22:05] Because God's word calls for a a unity,
[22:07] right? The only way that God can come
[22:10] and work in the people is if they're
[22:12] united. God cannot work in his the
[22:14] people if they're not united. The same
[22:16] way if I if I were to take my left arm
[22:18] and just leave it at the house, I
[22:20] couldn't do a lot of stuff. If I took my
[22:22] left leg off, I couldn't do anything. I
[22:24] need all of my bo my body pieces
[22:27] connected and united in order to do a
[22:28] work. And that's the way God has to be
[22:31] with his body as well. Amen. Brother
[22:33] Brandon went went ahead and said, I
[22:34] said, we are brethren. Absolutely. And
[22:37] the oneness and if the oneness faction
[22:39] hadn't had went off to one side and made
[22:41] an issue out of it and would have stayed
[22:43] with their brother and let the Holy
[22:45] Ghost anoint them, that thing would have
[22:47] never spattered and broke up brotherhood
[22:49] the way it did. And we're going to get
[22:50] on to we're going to get on this thing
[22:52] later because it's something that is
[22:55] something that is a responsibility. So,
[22:58] keeping of the of the keeping of the
[23:01] unity of the saints, that is everybody's
[23:04] job. It's not on a preacher, right? It's
[23:06] not on the prophet. It is your job to
[23:09] make sure you keep the unity in your
[23:11] local assembly. Right? If you fail on
[23:15] that end, the enemy will come in here
[23:16] like a whirlwind and tear every single
[23:19] thing apart. Right? That's why we have
[23:21] to pray for one another. That's why we
[23:22] have to forgive one another. If someone
[23:24] does something to us, we got to make
[23:26] sure that thing is right. Right? Because
[23:28] the enemy will use any crack he can to
[23:30] come inside here and try to tear every
[23:32] single one of us up. Right. So, but what
[23:36] happened? The locust began to fly.
[23:37] Continue. He says it broke up
[23:38] brotherhood. You have to have a little
[23:40] unity on your own. Unity is not an
[23:43] isolated thing, brother. Unity is for
[23:45] the whole body of Christ. So, you can't
[23:48] go off one and just say, "Well, I only
[23:50] fellowship with these people, or I only
[23:52] believe this this this piece of the
[23:54] message, or we only believe that piece
[23:55] of the message." No, no, no, no. We have
[23:57] to say amen to the whole message. We got
[24:00] to say amen to each other, right?
[24:02] Whether you're white, whether you're
[24:03] Chinese, whether you have a differences
[24:05] and living stuff, we all have to come
[24:07] together as one. That's what God's
[24:09] purpose was, right? Unity is for the
[24:12] whole body of Christ. It started in the
[24:14] early days. Paul said, "When I come
[24:16] among you, one has this and one has
[24:18] that." One said, "I'm of Cphus and I'm
[24:20] of Paul." Right? Trying to separate the
[24:23] word, right? Trying to create multiple
[24:26] uh entities, right? Was Cphus crucified?
[24:29] Would you baptize in the name of Paul?
[24:31] Why? That stuff had started had already
[24:34] started. It was eating into the church,
[24:36] right? Trying to divide the church,
[24:39] right? So the very nature of this of
[24:41] this doctrine or or um the spirit that
[24:44] is anointing this doctrine was to
[24:47] divide. Right? So when you have the
[24:49] trinity, what they're trying to say is
[24:50] it's three gods. Well, it's not three
[24:53] gods. It's only one god, right? One god
[24:56] is the unity, right? Uh and they were
[24:58] trying so they're trying to divide God
[25:00] into three different entities as if to
[25:02] separate them from one another. But
[25:04] could you imagine three gods? Could you
[25:07] imagine us living in a world with three
[25:09] gods? So you go to one God and that God
[25:12] says, you know, you're healed, you'll be
[25:15] healed next week. Then you go to the
[25:16] second God, he says, you'll be healed
[25:18] next month. Then you go to the third god
[25:20] and he says, you'll be healed next year.
[25:21] And it's like, well, who's who's telling
[25:24] me the truth? Right? Which is why the
[25:26] Bible says um to be equally yolked when
[25:30] you're looking to marry somebody, right?
[25:32] Um, and if you if if you have a if
[25:36] you're a message believer and you're
[25:37] marrying a Catholic person and you have
[25:39] a child and the Catholic person is like,
[25:43] "Well, you can wear shorts." But the
[25:45] message believer is like, "Well, you
[25:46] can't wear shorts." Who is a child
[25:48] supposed to believe cuz the Bible says
[25:50] obey your father and mother. So now you
[25:54] just put the child into a place of
[25:56] confusion because it's now looking at
[25:58] two opinions and it's like, "Well, I
[25:59] just don't know what to do. I don't know
[26:00] who to believe." Right? Because if you
[26:02] believe this one that'll be upset. If
[26:04] you believe this one, this one will be
[26:06] upset. So unity is very very important
[26:08] in order for stability and clarity even
[26:12] in your own household. Right. Right. Um
[26:16] and so and that's the way we see it
[26:18] today because we have so many
[26:20] denominations in the world today. I
[26:21] believe brother Mark had talked about
[26:23] it's I think it's hundreds of uh
[26:25] different denominations and stuff like
[26:27] that. And in order to get to heaven, one
[26:29] denomination says you got to walk this
[26:30] path. the other denomination says you
[26:32] got to go this way and this denomination
[26:34] says you got to go uh you got to go this
[26:35] way. You got so many ways. It's no
[26:38] wonder it's hard for and and I don't
[26:41] want I don't want to say this in in a
[26:43] wrong way, but I can I'm not saying I
[26:45] understand unbelievers, but if I was a
[26:47] unbeliever looking at denominations
[26:49] today, it would be very confusing to me
[26:51] to find out, well, which one is right?
[26:54] Because you're saying one thing and this
[26:56] person is saying one thing and this
[26:57] person is saying one thing and I don't
[26:59] know which one to believe. Right? So it
[27:01] just create it just puts people in a a
[27:03] position of uh different things. Right?
[27:07] Uh and the Bible talks about um the how
[27:11] the path to destruction is a broad path.
[27:14] So we don't want options, right? We
[27:16] don't want options when it comes down to
[27:18] the soul. We don't want to have a bunch
[27:19] of options and how to decide and stuff
[27:21] like that. We want one way, right? The
[27:23] Bible says straight and narrow is the
[27:25] way of life, but very few find it. Uh if
[27:27] we read here in John um John 14:6, it
[27:32] says, "Jesus said unto them, I am the
[27:34] way, the truth, and the life. No man
[27:36] cometh unto the father but by me." And
[27:39] it looks very interesting because it's
[27:41] like, well, is Jesus referencing some
[27:44] other person when he says the father?
[27:46] Well, no. They're one and the same,
[27:48] right? That's why he said no man can
[27:50] come into the father but by me because
[27:53] he is the father. Right? So that's what
[27:55] he was trying to uh uh uh clarify that
[27:58] isn't multiple people. No, he is the
[28:00] one. He is the father. He is the holy
[28:02] ghost. He is the son. All those people
[28:04] are one personality. Right? So this the
[28:07] so we know the doctrine the purpose of
[28:08] this doctrine is to destroy the unity.
[28:11] Right? Uh by um trying to separate God
[28:14] and take him out the uni take him out
[28:16] trying to take him out the unity of his
[28:18] titles when each of those titles was
[28:20] just to uh serve a particular purpose.
[28:23] Right? So when God was God the spirit
[28:25] with um the children of Israel, he
[28:28] couldn't really talk to them face to
[28:30] face. They said, "Moses, we don't want
[28:32] to hear you no more. We just want to
[28:33] talk to God." And God spoke out of
[28:34] heaven. They said, "Well, no, no, no,
[28:35] no. Just keep talking to Moses and
[28:37] talking to and talking to us." But when
[28:39] he came down in Jesus, he could talk to
[28:40] him face to face. They could touch him.
[28:42] They could hug him. They said the
[28:44] children came and they sat on his lap,
[28:46] right? He became more tangible. And then
[28:48] when he came down, but the problem was
[28:50] he was only in Israel. But then he came
[28:52] down in the Holy Spirit and now he can
[28:54] touch anybody in the world. Anybody can
[28:56] have access to God. So what he was
[28:58] trying to do was just showing the
[28:59] accessibility through each of his
[29:01] titles. It even though it was the same
[29:03] person because it preached what exactly
[29:05] he spoke what go Jesus Christ spoke what
[29:07] God said because it was God and the Holy
[29:09] Spirit speaks what Jesus Christ said
[29:11] because it was God and it's all one God.
[29:13] Yes sir. Right. And that's what we have
[29:15] to stand upon. Right. All right. So, we
[29:17] have to um we want to ask ourselves
[29:21] um what does this destruction exactly
[29:24] look like? Because in order to beat the
[29:26] enemy, you have to know what he's trying
[29:28] to do, right? I I I it's kind of like um
[29:32] and I think I told my Sunday school
[29:33] class this one. I've been outside. If
[29:35] you ever been in the woods before and no
[29:38] lights, I mean, I'm talking about
[29:39] country country woods. I ain't talking
[29:42] about no uh no city woods. country woods
[29:45] where you know I remember one time I was
[29:48] um I was hunting one time on my buddy's
[29:51] property and they was like and I believe
[29:53] he had they had given me a warning like
[29:54] you need to get out that tree stand once
[29:56] it starts the sun starts going down
[29:58] right and so I took my time and as soon
[30:00] as I got out that treeand and it got
[30:02] dark I was like okay cuz I couldn't even
[30:06] see my hand see when there's no
[30:08] moonlight and there's no stars and
[30:09] there's no light you can't see your hand
[30:11] so if you want to be able to defeat the
[30:13] enemy You got to know what it you got to
[30:15] know what you're facing. You can't fight
[30:17] in the dark, right? You cannot fight in
[30:19] the dark. So, it's important for us to
[30:21] be able to understand what his tactics
[30:23] are because that's the first thing that
[30:24] the enemy likes to do. He likes to hide
[30:26] himself and attack you. But then God
[30:28] comes on the scene to reveal it. That's
[30:31] why the prophet said, you know, he said
[30:32] if you could look at the people's faces
[30:34] when they come up with their conditions
[30:36] and uh brother Brandon would call out
[30:38] that you have this and you have that. He
[30:40] said if you could see their faces. He
[30:41] wasn't talking about the people, but he
[30:43] was talking about the enemy and the
[30:44] people being revealed, right? And now
[30:47] once they revealed, now the people know
[30:48] what to do and they can get their
[30:50] deliverance, right? So it has to be
[30:52] revealed to us first. So what does this
[30:54] look like? Because we've seen it in
[30:56] denominations, but we're not
[30:58] denomination, right? And so it's
[31:00] important for us to remember that just
[31:02] because we're in a message church, that
[31:05] doesn't make us immune to the spirit.
[31:08] That's the first thing. You can't think
[31:09] that just because you're sitting in the
[31:10] message church that you know well this
[31:12] can't happen to us. We believe the
[31:14] prophet uh enemy doesn't care about
[31:16] that. That spirit doesn't care about
[31:17] that. When wherever he sees unity that's
[31:20] what is going to attract them to ununite
[31:23] the people. Yes sir. That's right. So
[31:25] they tried this doctrine during the time
[31:27] of Shadrach, Mach and Abedneo when they
[31:31] uh when uh King Nebuchadnezzar raised up
[31:34] this statue of Daniel. Right. Right. So,
[31:37] we're going to and um we we have to
[31:40] remember that King Nebuchadnezzar during
[31:42] the time of Babylon, as we turn, we're
[31:44] going to turn to Daniel
[31:46] 2:36-37, we have to remember that this
[31:49] kingdom wasn't a heathen nation, right?
[31:52] They had the prophet in their day and
[31:54] age and they listened to that prophet,
[31:57] right? So, in uh Daniel's 2 uh 36-37, it
[32:02] says, "This is a dream and we will tell
[32:03] the interpretation thereof before the
[32:05] king. Thou king art the king of kings
[32:08] for the God of heaven hath given thee a
[32:10] kingdom power and strength and glory. So
[32:12] God was backing this country. Right? The
[32:15] prophet had a vision. Thus sayith the
[32:17] Lord. God is backing these people.
[32:19] Right? So they were believers. Right?
[32:22] They were
[32:23] believers. God had blessed them. But
[32:25] fast forward into the next chapter. Now
[32:28] they done built this statue of Daniel.
[32:31] And now they're telling everyone, "Hey
[32:33] guys, y'all got to worship this statue.
[32:36] It's like, "Okay, all right. That's
[32:38] pretty pretty interesting, right?" And
[32:41] that's one of the reason these Trinity
[32:43] spirits um uh these Trinity spirits all
[32:46] look they all they all really really
[32:49] look alike because it can come as such a
[32:52] religious thing happening, but its goal
[32:54] is to try to split the people up, right?
[32:57] And the prophet said about this trinity
[33:00] spirit, uh, before we continue going on,
[33:02] he said what Rome was trying to do when
[33:05] they came up with that doctrine, they
[33:07] were trying to fit their paganism into
[33:10] Christianity, right? They were trying to
[33:12] fit it into Christianity uh to please
[33:15] the people, right? Because before that,
[33:18] before uh Rome turned to Christian or
[33:21] their so-called version of Christianity,
[33:23] they had gods, right? They had Jupiter,
[33:26] they had Mars, they had Venus, they had
[33:29] Pluto, and they had Cupid, right? And
[33:32] Cupid we know is associated with
[33:34] Valentine's Day, which a lot of people
[33:37] uh a lot of people celebrate Valentine's
[33:39] Day. Uh Valentine was actually a saint
[33:43] within the Catholic Church. You see what
[33:46] I'm saying? Associated with the Catholic
[33:48] Church. And I've done my research online
[33:50] and there's mixed reasons on why
[33:53] Valentine's Day came to be and I could
[33:55] see why it would be mixed. But some
[33:57] people have said that it's a blend. It
[33:59] was a blend of ro Roman uh paganism
[34:02] where they were trying to mix in this
[34:03] thing where other people said it started
[34:05] as a celebration to celebrate his
[34:08] martyrm because he because he had died
[34:10] right. So but then after that it evolved
[34:12] into this whole love thing. So it
[34:15] started out as paganism. They tried to
[34:17] make it a religious thing on a guy, but
[34:19] then it ended up coming back to just
[34:21] paganism. Cuz if you ask anybody out
[34:24] here that celebrates Valentine's Day,
[34:26] they probably don't even know where the
[34:27] name comes from. So, it's not for
[34:30] religious purpose, right? It just goes
[34:32] right back to paganism. Just showing
[34:34] that you can't bring the world into the
[34:36] word and expect it to come out the word.
[34:40] No, it'll come in the world, it'll get
[34:42] all mixed up and funky looking and stuff
[34:44] and it'll come right back out to what it
[34:45] is. Yes, sir. Amen. That's why you have
[34:48] to have a born again experience. You
[34:50] just can't come to church, right? Cuz
[34:52] you'll come in church, y'all. You'll
[34:54] come you'll you'll get baptized. Brother
[34:56] Brandham said you'll go in a dry center
[34:58] and come out a wet center. Right? So it
[35:00] doesn't you can't mix your ideas in with
[35:02] the word. It has to be a new birth. Now
[35:04] you're a new creature. So no matter what
[35:06] you go through, you may be mixed in with
[35:08] the world, but you'll still come out a
[35:10] son of God at the end of it. Right? It's
[35:12] always important how things start.
[35:15] Um and so um what and brother Brandon
[35:19] went on to say is that instead of uh
[35:22] Jupiter and Mars and Venus and Cupid,
[35:24] what they did was they replaced it with
[35:26] St. Peter and and Mother Mary. And one
[35:29] of the beliefs within the Catholic
[35:31] Church is that um you can pray to Mother
[35:34] Mary to help you intercede to God on
[35:37] your behalf. That's one of the things
[35:39] that they believe. But if we turn to
[35:41] first Matthew uh verse 2 uh chapter 2
[35:45] verse 5 what the Bible says is for there
[35:49] is one God and one mediator between God
[35:53] and men the man Christ Jesus. So matter
[35:57] no matter how much you try to mix your
[35:59] ideas if it doesn't line up with the
[36:01] word you have to throw it out. Yes sir.
[36:04] All right. So here we have this king
[36:07] Nebuchadnezzar trying to worship a saint
[36:09] in Daniel, right? And and now the
[36:12] Catholic church hasn't hasn't started or
[36:14] nothing, but we can see the spirit, the
[36:15] nature of the spirit still trying to
[36:18] operate through this man, right? And
[36:20] they had this spirit that if you don't
[36:22] believe the things that we believe, you
[36:23] can't be a part of us, right? And it is
[36:27] such I mean it's it it gets so tired
[36:30] because you hear it all the time when
[36:32] people come off with these little
[36:33] factions. If you don't believe things
[36:35] the way that we believe, you can't be
[36:37] saved. If you don't see it our way, you
[36:39] can't be saved. When the brother
[36:41] Brandham came on the scene and said, "If
[36:42] they draw you, if they draw a circle and
[36:44] draw you out, what you do is you draw a
[36:47] bigger circle to show that your spirit
[36:50] is a spirit of unity, right?" So then
[36:53] you know where the right doctrine is is
[36:55] wherever things are trying to unite
[36:57] stuff. when things are trying to divide
[36:59] and separate and separate then you know
[37:02] it's a wrong spirit operating uh amongst
[37:05] them right so here the spirit was trying
[37:07] to break the unity right they were
[37:09] trying to separate people and trying to
[37:10] tell people hey if you don't bow down to
[37:12] this image well then you have to be
[37:14] thrown into the fire right um and that's
[37:18] exactly what the Catholic church is
[37:20] going to get to because the Catholic
[37:21] church the prophet said it'll get into
[37:23] this little um get into this little
[37:26] thing where it's trying to unite all of
[37:28] the religions together, right? And then
[37:30] if you if the Bible says if you don't
[37:32] agree, right, that you can't it says you
[37:35] can't buy or trade or sell without
[37:37] having a mark of beast. So if you don't
[37:39] agree with us, then you have to be
[37:41] outside of us, right? And it's just the
[37:43] same ugly spirit uh rearing its head up.
[37:47] And and in fact, you can actually see it
[37:49] in the Islamic nation because Muslims
[37:52] believe in God, too. And if you go over
[37:54] and you're caught in Muslim in one of
[37:56] those little fanatics uh uh
[37:58] organizations that you have, they'll ask
[38:00] you one question like, "Are you a
[38:02] Christian?" You'll be like, "Yeah, I'm a
[38:03] Christian." They'll say, "Well, you need
[38:04] to denounce your Christianity or they
[38:06] will kill you." Right? So, it's just the
[38:09] same exact spirit we see uh operating
[38:11] out here in these uh denominations. And
[38:14] I kind of want to show um even within
[38:17] the message how we got to be careful
[38:19] because um I used to go to a church. Me
[38:21] and my dad used to go to a church in
[38:23] Washington. Um, and man, our church was,
[38:27] you can ask my dad, we were a powerful
[38:29] church. We had Ghanaians, we had I
[38:32] people from Ivy Coast, we had Congalles,
[38:35] we had um people from Rwanda, we had
[38:38] people from Kenya, we had Mexicans, all
[38:41] of us was in it was it was a really
[38:43] really good church. We all loved each
[38:45] other. Uh it was actually that was the
[38:48] church where me and dad first met
[38:50] brother Jack because one of the
[38:52] preachers up there all the churches we
[38:53] had come together to unify for a
[38:55] convention and one of them invited
[38:57] brother Jack and that was the first time
[38:58] that I heard brother Jack and and and
[39:00] had known about brother Jack. But our
[39:02] conventions used to be the best. I mean
[39:04] it was after conventions everybody was
[39:06] sweating because they were dancing. It
[39:08] was we just had a a a good time in the
[39:11] Lord and then a spirit just had to come.
[39:15] Right? A spirit just had to come. See,
[39:18] that's the thing about the enemy, man.
[39:19] When you having a good time, he don't
[39:22] like to see that. And so, he has to do
[39:25] something to cause division. And so, one
[39:29] one of these summers, we had a
[39:30] convention. There was this one brother,
[39:32] and I'm not speaking against anybody,
[39:34] but the enemy can use anyone. He can,
[39:36] right? I'm not trying to say people are
[39:39] are evil. They're not. I'm just
[39:40] recognizing the enemy and how he works.
[39:43] So they had brought in this one uh
[39:46] brother came in here and he started
[39:48] preaching and you know we was I was
[39:50] sitting in the back just enjoying the
[39:51] message and we had in the back of our
[39:54] church we had a cross which was a wooden
[39:56] cross. We had two sticks and it was a
[39:58] cross and his brother said you know you
[40:00] guys should take down that cross and put
[40:02] up a picture of of the prophet and
[40:05] everybody in the church was shouting and
[40:07] and hollering and yelling. I'm sitting
[40:10] in the back like, "Hold on a second.
[40:12] This don't sound
[40:13] right." See, you need God in your life
[40:17] to be your ears or you'll get caught up
[40:20] with the fanaticism. Don't Don't think
[40:22] that you you're strong enough to face
[40:25] fanaticism. Fanatic spirits are very,
[40:28] very convincing.
[40:30] Very, very convincing. And so after I
[40:34] got out of church, because I talked to
[40:36] the young people and we were all kind of
[40:39] uh discussing about, you know, our uh
[40:42] kind of our reason about kind of what
[40:44] happened and our beliefs and I began to
[40:46] realize that there are some people out
[40:47] there that kind of towed a line of
[40:49] worshiping a man and I'm like I'm not
[40:51] going to believe something like that. So
[40:53] that kind of made me realize that a
[40:56] brother is more than just worship. We
[40:59] have to believe in the same word to have
[41:01] unity. If we don't believe in the same
[41:03] word, we cannot have unity. We all have
[41:06] to believe the word. We all have to
[41:08] believe the fullness of the word. Every
[41:09] single line, every single dot, right? Or
[41:12] we cannot have unity. We can't have
[41:14] unity in worship, right? We can't have
[41:17] unity in being good people. Our unity
[41:19] has to be in Christ. And so that spirit
[41:23] started to get into the church. And now
[41:25] if you look at our church today, um it
[41:28] is uh it's been divided. You know, you
[41:31] got this brother's a pastor, this
[41:32] brother's a pastor, and that brother's a
[41:34] pastor. So that spirit came right up
[41:36] into the church, saw all those people
[41:38] having a good time and said, "Nah, we're
[41:40] not going to have this." Came up in
[41:42] there and ripped the church right apart,
[41:44] right? Ripped the church right apart.
[41:47] Uh, I went up there with brother Jack
[41:49] and my dad and I saw some of the saints
[41:52] that I had been with and I saw this one
[41:53] brother just dancing and it was it was
[41:56] kind of
[41:57] a a bittersweet moment for me because
[42:00] this is somebody that is just still
[42:02] standing but it's like man I remember
[42:05] when you was dancing with so and so and
[42:07] dancing with this person and to see him
[42:09] still dancing and holding on was good
[42:11] but it's like our church used to be
[42:14] better than this, right? We used to be
[42:16] stronger than this. We used to I mean
[42:18] you had brothers. We would uh shake each
[42:20] other hand. We would eat during the
[42:22] convention. We would have food, laugh.
[42:23] We I mean the youth we used to travel to
[42:26] different youth conventions and all that
[42:28] kind of stuff. And to see a church,
[42:30] right, just a um a image of its for
[42:34] former glory really makes you sad,
[42:36] right? It really makes you sad. And
[42:39] there's more churches that I've gone to
[42:40] where you have I mean churches that are
[42:42] big buildings. I mean beautiful
[42:44] buildings man huge building and five
[42:48] people in the church because these
[42:50] spirits come inside here and divide and
[42:52] tear people apart right so it's
[42:55] something that we have to watch out for
[42:58] uh these spirits and we all have to
[43:00] believe in the word one word one god one
[43:03] mo message not multiple ideas multiple
[43:07] ideas mean that everyone can go on their
[43:09] own path but God wants to bring his
[43:11] church together right and So, and so I
[43:14] say this as uh um say this as like as as
[43:17] as
[43:18] as humbly as I can. If you don't have
[43:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're
[43:24] in a mer and you're in a message church,
[43:27] God is not obligated to protect you,
[43:30] right? God's not obligated to protect
[43:32] you. Right? So, the prophet, remember,
[43:35] it was the prophet that told us God
[43:37] allows the enemy to come into the church
[43:40] to disrupt things. Yes, sir. God allows
[43:43] him to do it, right? So, you can't blame
[43:45] him. He's just doing exactly what God
[43:47] commanded him. What you can do on your
[43:49] end is to make sure you're filled with
[43:51] the spirit so you can resist the attack.
[43:54] Right? You can resist it. Amen. Right.
[43:57] And um you know, cuz the the prophet
[44:00] said that two things are either going to
[44:01] happen when this person comes in the
[44:03] church to try to divide. Either he's
[44:05] one, he's going to become a brother, or
[44:07] two, he's going to get kicked out.
[44:08] Right? The problem is the enemy never
[44:12] likes to leave empty-handed, right?
[44:15] So Lucifer in the beginning when he was
[44:18] kicked out of heaven, he couldn't just
[44:19] go by himself. The Bible says he took
[44:21] onethird of the angels. And if you don't
[44:24] have the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[44:26] that fanaticism will come into the
[44:27] church and it'll carry you away. I don't
[44:30] care what your mom believes. I don't
[44:32] care what your dad believes. I don't
[44:33] care what your friends believe, right?
[44:35] If you're not standing on a solid
[44:37] experience with God, grounded in the
[44:40] word, which keeps people united, you'll
[44:42] be swept away with it. I remember when I
[44:45] was um when they began to tell me about
[44:47] that doctrine that they was trying to
[44:49] they were they say they were trying to
[44:50] worship Brother Brandon, but they
[44:51] weren't doing it. They trying to they
[44:53] gave me this thing where they're saying,
[44:54] you know, it's like an equation. It's
[44:55] like you put God in and the prophet
[44:57] there. And I'm like, I just I just can't
[44:59] see this thing. But let me tell you, it
[45:02] sounded so convincing. It's something
[45:04] that I battled in my spirit for years
[45:06] and years and years and years because
[45:08] I'm like, man, this thing sounds real.
[45:11] And it wasn't until I turned to the
[45:13] story of Shedrach, Meshach, and
[45:14] Abednego. And when I found out that that
[45:17] image was Daniel, I said, okay, now I
[45:19] know I'm standing on a solid ground.
[45:22] Right. We don't bow down to men. We bow
[45:25] down to God because there is one God.
[45:29] Exactly. Right. Amen. And it has to be
[45:31] revelation that comes to you or else you
[45:35] will agree. Right? Satan is too
[45:38] convincing and it takes God's word to
[45:41] resist him. Right? It takes his word to
[45:44] resist him. Right? Uh and I'm not saying
[45:46] these things to just to make uh to uh
[45:49] make you uh to make make you be afraid.
[45:51] I'm hoping that it'll build your faith
[45:52] up, right? To make sure that you're
[45:55] grounded and rooted in the word as well,
[45:57] right? uh you know during the times of
[45:59] war you know uh I think I can't remember
[46:01] it's like the Vietnam war I mean when
[46:03] you was sleeping you had to sleep with
[46:04] one eye open right and so it's it's the
[46:07] same way with uh uh our Christian fight
[46:09] as well so where else is the unity found
[46:12] so we've seen unity in denominations we
[46:15] see that we see uh and how it can be
[46:17] disrupted in denominations we see how
[46:19] unity can be disrupted in the message
[46:21] church because a lot of times people
[46:22] think it's a safe zone but it's not a
[46:24] safe zone right so where else is unity
[46:27] Now, so let's we're going to turn to the
[46:29] message Abraham preached in 60803
[46:33] uh and paragraph uh
[46:37] 39, right? And I'll just start reading.
[46:40] Okay, perfect. Says, see, everything in
[46:42] the Bible is in a trinity. You know that
[46:44] I said the other day, now he's not
[46:46] talking about a a a doctrine, the
[46:48] doctrinal trinity. I said the other day,
[46:50] you're a trinity. Soul, body, and
[46:54] spirit. You live in a trinity. kitchen
[46:56] and living room and the bedroom. You
[46:58] might have eight or 10 different rooms
[47:00] uh but bedrooms and spare this but you
[47:03] only live in three rooms. God, father,
[47:06] son, and holy ghost in a trinity. And we
[47:09] find out that the coming of the Christ
[47:10] is a trinity. He first he first came to
[47:12] redeem his bride. Comes to receive his
[47:15] next comes to receive his bride. Comes
[47:16] to his bride as king and queen to reign
[47:18] with through the millennium. You know
[47:20] that everything is in trinity and we're
[47:21] in a trinity. We have a mortal body, a
[47:23] glorified body or I mean a celestial
[47:25] body and then a glorified body. This
[47:27] this three stages brings us back to
[47:29] perfection again like Eden. So here the
[47:32] prophet is saying that we are a trinity
[47:33] soul, body and spirit, right? Uh mortal
[47:37] body, celestial body and then a
[47:39] glorified body. That's our perfection,
[47:41] right? So us being in the image of us
[47:45] being the image of God as the prophet
[47:47] said we have our own trinity. It's not
[47:48] like the world's trinity of doctrine
[47:50] because God expects us to have unity
[47:52] within ourselves. Right? God expects you
[47:55] to have unity within your own self. All
[47:58] right? We're going to get to what that
[47:59] means. Right? So, one of the people that
[48:01] I want to believe, one of the people in
[48:03] the Bible that I that I do desire to
[48:05] meet was the the father that had the
[48:07] epileptic son. And he was uh he wanted
[48:10] to get he wanted God to uh he wanted
[48:12] Jesus Christ to heal his son. And Jesus
[48:15] told him these words, "If thou can
[48:17] believe," right? God has to have God ha
[48:20] you have to come to God in faith in
[48:22] order for him to do something for you.
[48:25] And he said he said these these I call
[48:27] them famous words because I feel like
[48:29] it's anybody can relate to these words
[48:32] when you're going through and you're
[48:33] just kind of struggling. You just you're
[48:35] holding on and you just need some hope.
[48:37] He said, "Lord, I believe. Help my
[48:40] unbelief." Amen. So he realized that he
[48:43] was a being in trinity. But the thing is
[48:46] every single being has to agree in order
[48:49] for God to come on the scene and do
[48:50] something because you are one, right?
[48:53] Everything has to agree. Everything has
[48:55] to be in unity, right? He recognized he
[48:58] was a triune being and each one of those
[48:59] things had to agree. There weren't
[49:01] separate. They weren't separate people.
[49:03] You can't look at your your soul and
[49:06] your spirit and your body as separate
[49:08] people. You'll go insane, right? They
[49:10] all have to agree and be one just as
[49:13] Jesus Christ is one, right? And so I was
[49:17] I uh this semester uh semester ended uh
[49:20] yesterday, I believe. I was taking this
[49:23] sociology class and it's I mean it's
[49:26] it's it's amazing what they what they
[49:28] try to indoctrinate with the people. And
[49:30] so we got to the study of gender roles,
[49:33] right? Um
[49:35] and it's it's hard to sit through it,
[49:38] you know? It's it's really hard to kind
[49:40] of sit through that because, you know,
[49:42] they they recognize that there are
[49:44] roles. That's the thing about it. So,
[49:46] they see it and so, you know, they
[49:49] they'll have these uh they'll have these
[49:52] females out here that are in the world,
[49:54] you know, you got to be independent. You
[49:56] know, uh they got them chasing after
[49:57] like, hey, I want to be the president. I
[49:59] want to be the mayor and I want to have
[50:00] 10 businesses, right? And they got all
[50:03] of these and it's a sad because feminism
[50:06] is a spirit, right? They're not anytime
[50:08] you see ism, it's a spirit that gets on
[50:10] to the people. And so these poor females
[50:13] have got this stuff on their flesh and
[50:15] their spirit. But the Bible says God
[50:18] created a woman to be a mother. So now
[50:20] you got the soul in here that wants to
[50:22] be a mother. But then you got the spirit
[50:24] out here that wants to own 10 businesses
[50:27] and the flesh wants to be a leader. And
[50:29] now these person just can't agree with
[50:31] themselves. Right now they're just
[50:34] always angry. And whenever
[50:37] And I hate to say it, whenever you see a
[50:39] feminist, they are never happy. That's
[50:42] right. They're never happy people.
[50:44] They're always arguing because they
[50:47] don't have unity within themselves.
[50:51] They don't have unity within themselves.
[50:53] And it's not just the women, it's the
[50:55] men, too. You know, you got some of
[50:58] these men out here. You know, God made
[51:00] men to be strong. God made men to, hey,
[51:02] you got to use your muscles, right? And
[51:05] a lot of men try to complain about how,
[51:08] you know, how weak a woman is and she's
[51:10] always this and she's always that. God
[51:12] made you strong enough to bear those
[51:14] burdens. So now when they get out of
[51:16] their position, right? Now they're
[51:18] painting their fingernails. Now they got
[51:21] purses on, right? But their soul says
[51:24] you're a man. So now they got all this
[51:27] confusion inside of them and they have
[51:29] no unity because the soul says one thing
[51:31] and the spirit says one thing and the
[51:33] body says one thing and now they're just
[51:35] all out of whack because they're not
[51:38] what the image God had expected them to
[51:40] be. Amen. We already read we read in
[51:44] Ezekiel how when God comes and cleanses,
[51:47] one of the things that he does is he
[51:48] gives you a new heart and a new spirit.
[51:51] That's not the Holy Spirit. The prophet
[51:53] said, "God had to give you a new spirit
[51:56] because you couldn't even agree with
[51:58] yourself, right? God has to give you a
[52:02] new spirit so you have unity with inside
[52:04] because God can't dwell in confusion,
[52:07] right? God is not going to put himself
[52:09] into a vessel of confusion." You know, a
[52:11] lot of times people, they want
[52:13] Christianity to accept homosexuality,
[52:15] but God will not enter a vessel in that
[52:18] state. It has to be clean first. Yes,
[52:21] sir. Amen. Right? And then when you have
[52:24] when you have that new spirit on the
[52:26] inside, right? Now you've got a a now
[52:29] you got a piece of unity. Now God can
[52:31] put his spirit inside of you. So now you
[52:34] can agree with the word, right? That's
[52:37] the ultimate goal, right? God wants you
[52:39] to agree uh uh with his word. So this
[52:42] this trinitarian doctrine is um it's a
[52:46] very very important one to make sure you
[52:48] have revelation of uh because a lot of
[52:51] times people will baptize in the name of
[52:53] the father, son, and the holy ghost. And
[52:56] we've already seen Paul get on people
[52:58] that baptize wrong because there was a
[53:00] group of people that were believers and
[53:03] Paul asked them, "What baptize what
[53:06] baptism were y'all baptized in?" They
[53:07] said, "Well, we were baptized under
[53:09] John." The prophet said he made them
[53:11] rebaptize themselves because he realized
[53:14] God was not obligated to give them the
[53:16] Holy Spirit under that doctrine. So,
[53:19] it's important that you that what you're
[53:21] believing uh uh the doctrine that you
[53:24] believe, you have to make sure it lines
[53:25] up with the word because God has a role
[53:28] to play. And if you don't meet that
[53:30] role, God's not obligated to give you
[53:32] anything. And if God don't give you the
[53:34] Holy Spirit, you don't have power.
[53:37] You don't have power, right? You will
[53:40] not be able to overcome the world. You
[53:42] will not be able to overcome fanaticism.
[53:44] You won't be able to battle cancer. You
[53:46] won't be able to battle depression.
[53:48] These things will defeat you. Right? So,
[53:51] you have to make sure you're 100% on the
[53:54] word so God can give you his spirit and
[53:56] then you have the victory. Right?
[53:58] Hallelujah. But the problem is, you
[54:01] know, a lot of times, you know, as we
[54:04] went back, as we've seen in the past,
[54:06] people want religion and they people
[54:09] want religion and they want the things
[54:12] of the world. That's the problem. People
[54:14] want to have both, right? You know, they
[54:16] want to worship their flesh as God. So
[54:18] when a when their flesh says, "Hey, it's
[54:20] okay for you to cut your hair." Well,
[54:22] then it's okay, right? And then they
[54:24] want to be able to worship their spirit.
[54:25] Their spirit says, "Hey, you don't have
[54:27] to be a forgiven person. You know, if
[54:28] somebody does you wrong, you just uh
[54:30] curse them out or you just back talk
[54:32] them." And they want to be able to
[54:33] worship that. And they want to have God
[54:35] reigning on the inside of the heart,
[54:38] right? And it doesn't work like that,
[54:40] right? It doesn't work like that. Your
[54:42] your your body, your spirit, your soul,
[54:45] they got to agree, right? God has to
[54:47] talk to a being that is in unity in
[54:49] order to get stuff done. That's right.
[54:53] So, and um so the prophet had the
[54:56] prophet says, you know, you'll make him,
[54:59] you know, the savior, but you won't make
[55:01] him lord, right? You won't make him lord
[55:04] because you want lords. You want
[55:06] multiple gods that you can serve, right?
[55:09] And still be saved, right? Right. You
[55:12] want to be able to go go to the club on
[55:14] Saturday and then come to church on
[55:16] Sunday. You want to be able to say, you
[55:19] know, if your flesh says, "Hey, you can
[55:20] go to the club and wear what you want.
[55:22] you're just having a good time, you want
[55:23] to say amen to that. And then you want
[55:25] to come to church, you know, and God's
[55:27] preaching the word, you want to say amen
[55:29] to the word, right? But that doesn't
[55:31] show unity, right? That does not show
[55:34] unity, right? It's uh uh because if you
[55:37] had because see, if you had a Lord,
[55:40] singular Lord, he just not going to let
[55:43] you do whatever you want to do, right?
[55:44] He's going to make you line up with his
[55:46] word, right? So, um, we're going to read
[55:50] second Peter. Uh, let me turn to
[55:54] it. We're going to read second Peter
[55:56] because we're going to get into a bib
[55:58] biblical example of, uh, of these things
[56:02] right here. Um, just to kind of see
[56:05] examples in the Bible. So, second Peter
[56:08] uh, verses uh,
[56:10] 7-8. And Peter says here, "And delivered
[56:14] just Lot vexed with the filthy
[56:16] conversation of the wicked." And here's
[56:19] the important part. For that righteous
[56:20] man dwelling among them and seeing and
[56:23] hearing vexed his righteous soul from
[56:26] day to day with their unlawful
[56:29] deeds. And my question is, if you have a
[56:32] righteous soul, well, what are you still
[56:33] doing in the city?
[56:37] If you have a righteous soul, what are
[56:38] you still dwelling there for? Right? If
[56:41] you have something on the inside that
[56:43] tells you what's right and wrong, like
[56:46] why stay,
[56:48] right? So, we're going to turn to the uh
[56:50] message conference uh preached in 60
[56:54] um let me see uh
[56:58] 61125 and it's paragraph uh 67 just to
[57:02] kind of get a scope of this trinity as
[57:04] as it regards as to people because you
[57:07] want to make sure you're you're in the
[57:08] right trinity as far as group
[57:10] association as well. So, it says
[57:13] remember the brothers speaking this
[57:14] morning of three angels coming down. Two
[57:16] of them went down into Sodom. There's
[57:18] always three. It's a trinity. And the
[57:20] trinity is one. See, now notice there
[57:22] was the sodomites, the unbelieving
[57:24] sodomites of the world. There was Lot,
[57:26] the lukewarm Christian believer. There
[57:28] was Abraham, the called out from them,
[57:30] elected Abraham. You believe that?
[57:32] Watch. Two angels, modern preachers,
[57:34] went down and preached. Didn't do no
[57:36] miracles, just only splended the blind.
[57:37] And preaching of the gospel does smite
[57:39] the believer. But Lot was saved. But
[57:42] Abraham representing these last days,
[57:44] the elected church, the church that the
[57:46] supernatural's been going in, right? So
[57:50] Lot didn't get supernatural. And you
[57:52] want to be associated with a group where
[57:54] you can see the supernatural existing in
[57:56] your life, but you have to have oneness
[57:58] with the word. Right? So we see here the
[58:01] trinity uh as I said um uh representing
[58:05] the groups and brother Brandham even
[58:06] further on went to mention and said that
[58:08] Lot represented the denominational
[58:10] church right the denominational church.
[58:13] So we're going to turn to Abraham's
[58:14] grace covenant
[58:16] uh preached in
[58:19] um
[58:21] 0317 paragraph 171 to 172. I'll just
[58:24] kind of read it for time. Uh it says
[58:27] here somebody said the other day a
[58:29] converted Jew that said that show them
[58:32] that show that them three men was father
[58:35] son and holy ghost. Nonsense. He's
[58:37] talking about the angels that had uh
[58:39] come down. Nonsense. He didn't say my
[58:41] lords as a heathen. He said talking
[58:44] about Abraham my lord. Lot was the one
[58:47] called the two angels lords. And this is
[58:50] what he said. The backslider down there
[58:52] shows exactly where that same class
[58:55] lives today. makes God four or five
[58:58] different people. God is one. Uhhuh. My
[59:01] Lord, said Abraham. Lot said, "My Lord's
[59:03] for two of them, but there's three of
[59:05] them there." And Abraham recognized
[59:07] there's one God in them. My Lord, look
[59:09] at it. And remember, it wasn't little
[59:10] Lord over here in Elohim. It was my
[59:12] Lord. Elohim, Jehovah, walked up to the
[59:14] tent. Oh, listen to this. Everybody was
[59:16] trimming the first, you know, they said
[59:17] it and carried a conversation. Uh, wish
[59:19] I had time to stress it. Uh, and we're
[59:21] going to um we're also going to go to
[59:23] the message, the true Easter Seal. uh
[59:25] preached in
[59:27] 610402. Um just to kind of we want to
[59:31] focus here on Lot's Lot's reaction uh
[59:34] Lot's doctrine versus Abraham's doctrine
[59:36] and we'll kind of see where uh these
[59:38] guys ended up. So I'll just go ahead and
[59:41] read it. It says paragraph 200 says,
[59:42] "Now I want to watch it. Just bring
[59:44] something you remember. When Abraham
[59:47] seen them three together, he said, "Not
[59:48] my lords, but my Lord. But when Lot, his
[59:52] denominational brother, when he seen two
[59:54] of them, he said, "My lords." That shows
[59:56] where you're at. See, Lot called them
[59:57] lords. Abraham called three of them my
[1:00:00] Lord. There was only one of them there
[1:00:01] was God. That's right, Elohim. And then
[1:00:03] the two angels, which was nothing but
[1:00:05] messengers, went down there. And look
[1:00:06] what he says here. He says, "And Lot,
[1:00:08] that great trinitarian brother, wanted
[1:00:11] to call them his lords. You know, come
[1:00:14] on in." See what condition he got into.
[1:00:15] He was down there with the things of the
[1:00:17] world. His wife and all his daughters
[1:00:19] out there just like the rest of the
[1:00:20] world and they're a cold formal church.
[1:00:23] That's what you get with a cold formal
[1:00:26] church. When you can't recognize the
[1:00:27] oneness of the message, what it does is
[1:00:29] it tears you up. It eventually tears
[1:00:32] your family up. Um
[1:00:35] uh I'll just go ahead and read this. Um
[1:00:37] and it's the message uh Jehovah Gyra
[1:00:40] says, "Look at Lot. Lot sitting at the
[1:00:42] gate." And this is this is important for
[1:00:44] us to understand. Look at Lot. Lot
[1:00:47] sitting in the gate and said, "My lords
[1:00:49] and living in such a way just live in
[1:00:51] any okay." And he has a righteous soul.
[1:00:53] The Bible said he has a righteous soul.
[1:00:56] They said, "Come into my house." He
[1:00:58] said, "We'll sleep in the street. What a
[1:01:00] home." He was referencing the angels
[1:01:02] that when he asked the angels to come
[1:01:04] and dine with him, the angels said, "No,
[1:01:06] we'll stay outside." Could you imagine
[1:01:09] that?
[1:01:10] What what kind of what kind of Christian
[1:01:12] will have representatives from Ohio to
[1:01:15] come up in here, you invite them into
[1:01:17] your house and I say, "No, we'll stand
[1:01:19] on the street." You have to be in some
[1:01:21] kind of state in order for that to
[1:01:23] happen. Right? 108 says, "But as soon as
[1:01:26] as soon as Abraham they said, this is
[1:01:28] the purpose we come from. We sit down
[1:01:31] here by the side of you." So, they sat
[1:01:33] beside Abraham. They wanted to sleep on
[1:01:36] the outside with Lot, though. uh verse
[1:01:38] one uh paragraph 9 says that's the way
[1:01:41] live so that if God would want to use
[1:01:43] you he knows he knows right where to
[1:01:45] come get you in a position living a
[1:01:47] clean life before God your words are
[1:01:49] honest your life is true that's the kind
[1:01:51] of place that angels come look at
[1:01:53] Elizabeth Zachchariah seeing upright
[1:01:55] honest walking in the commandments of
[1:01:56] the Lord that's the way we want to live
[1:01:58] so God gets ready to use us he says this
[1:02:00] is my people I can do with the church
[1:02:02] what I want they believe me they stand
[1:02:03] on my word see that's the way you want
[1:02:05] to do live life so you have to have
[1:02:08] unity within yourself within the word
[1:02:10] and even for God to want to come and sit
[1:02:13] and talk with you right a lot of and
[1:02:15] that's why it's a lot of people in the
[1:02:16] world that are um that are in
[1:02:19] Christianity today and they think
[1:02:21] they're fellowshipping with God and
[1:02:24] that's the trick that the enemy has
[1:02:25] placed on them because you'll see a lot
[1:02:27] of these religious groups uh I'm not
[1:02:30] saying don't listen to their music but a
[1:02:31] lot of religious singers out here and
[1:02:34] stuff like that you know you got women
[1:02:35] wearing pants and You have uh the guys
[1:02:38] out here uh wearing earrings and tattoos
[1:02:40] and stuff like that. And I mean they can
[1:02:43] worship. They'll be in tears, man.
[1:02:45] They'll be praising the Lord. They'll
[1:02:47] bring the place down. And God's not on
[1:02:50] the inside, right? Because God can't
[1:02:52] dwell in a vessel like that. When you go
[1:02:55] and read the story of Legion,
[1:02:58] even Legion worshiped God when Jesus
[1:03:00] came to the scene with all them demons
[1:03:02] on the inside of him. So worship can't
[1:03:05] do it. You can't just come to worship.
[1:03:07] You have to have unity with inside of
[1:03:09] yourself with the word. That's what it's
[1:03:11] going to take. Right? God is not looking
[1:03:13] for a a makebeliever. He wants a full
[1:03:16] believer, right? So, when you have um
[1:03:21] so, like I said, when you have a Trinity
[1:03:22] spirit on you, God doesn't even want to
[1:03:24] come into fellowship with you, right?
[1:03:28] Um and so, we're going to uh look deeper
[1:03:31] into this with uh with Lot. So, we'll uh
[1:03:34] turn to Genesis, and I'll just kind of
[1:03:35] go through and read some of this as we
[1:03:38] begin to close in a little bit. Um,
[1:03:41] Genesis uh chapter 19, so we can kind of
[1:03:43] see uh the state of
[1:03:48] this. So, Genesis chapter 19, we're
[1:03:52] going to read verses
[1:03:54] 6-8. And this is just a uh just this is
[1:03:57] just kind of um what was happening was
[1:03:59] these guys had seen the angels and
[1:04:01] they're trying to do some wicked stuff
[1:04:02] with them. And this is just Lot kind of
[1:04:04] talking to him. And Lot went out of the
[1:04:06] door unto them, and shut the door after
[1:04:08] him, and said, I pray you, brethren, do
[1:04:10] not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two
[1:04:13] daughters which have not known men. Let
[1:04:15] me, I pray you, bring them out unto you,
[1:04:18] and do ye to them as is good in your
[1:04:21] eyes. Only unto these men do nothing.
[1:04:23] For therefore came under the shadow of
[1:04:26] my roof. Now, you have to be in a
[1:04:28] position to give your daughters up to
[1:04:30] wicked men. You have to be some you have
[1:04:32] to be in some kind of state, right, to
[1:04:35] have a mindset like that. What a
[1:04:37] righteous soul. You knowing right from
[1:04:39] wrong and willing to give your daughters
[1:04:41] up to men like that, right? That's why
[1:04:44] we have to have unity within ourselves.
[1:04:47] Right? Verse 13, we go down to verse 13.
[1:04:50] It says, "And this is the angels that
[1:04:52] were talking uh to Lot. For we will
[1:04:54] destroy this place because the cry of
[1:04:56] them is waxing great before the face of
[1:04:58] the Lord and the Lord have sent us to
[1:05:00] destroy it. And Lot went out and spake
[1:05:02] unto his sons-in-law, which married his
[1:05:03] daughters, and said, "Up, get out of
[1:05:05] this place, for the Lord will destroy
[1:05:06] the city." But he seemed as one that
[1:05:08] mocked unto his sons uh sons-in-law. So
[1:05:11] here here you have Lot here trying to
[1:05:14] now preach the word, right? But the
[1:05:17] thing about it was he was tearing. So
[1:05:20] when you say the word, you got to make
[1:05:22] sure you're living it as well, right?
[1:05:24] You got to make sure that you're living
[1:05:25] the word as well. Um and um so he had
[1:05:30] enough religion to repeat it. But the
[1:05:32] Bible is not looking just for repeaters
[1:05:34] of the word. The Bible's looking for
[1:05:35] doers of the word. Right? And so um as
[1:05:40] we come down to
[1:05:42] um verse 15 uh yes verse 15 and 16 it
[1:05:46] says when the morning arose so they've
[1:05:48] been there all
[1:05:50] night. So he had the word and it still
[1:05:53] didn't cause him to move. When you look
[1:05:56] at Abraham, contrast that with Abraham.
[1:05:59] Abraham went through a circumcision
[1:06:01] which represented the baptism of the
[1:06:03] Holy Spirit. And then when God came and
[1:06:05] sucked with him and said, "Hey, at the
[1:06:07] time of life, I'm going to give you a
[1:06:08] son." Abraham said, "Amen." Right? It
[1:06:11] put Abraham to action when he heard the
[1:06:13] word. But here Lot is he doesn't have
[1:06:16] agreement with his inner people. Right?
[1:06:19] So when he hears the word, it causes him
[1:06:20] to delay, right? So you don't want to be
[1:06:23] in this state of delay. And one of the
[1:06:25] things that this is just me speaking,
[1:06:28] but um I believe Lot was a gambler. Had
[1:06:31] a gambling problem when he was in uh
[1:06:33] Sodom and Gomorra. I believe I could see
[1:06:35] I wouldn't be surprised seeing them at
[1:06:37] the casinos and uh at the gas stations
[1:06:41] with the scratch offs and the uh right
[1:06:44] the uh the money balls and stuff like
[1:06:46] that trying to uh gamble his life
[1:06:49] savings because if you can gamble your
[1:06:51] family right you can gamble anything. So
[1:06:55] the outer man will always show what's
[1:06:57] going on with the spiritual person.
[1:07:00] Which is why uh God, you know, God God
[1:07:03] don't want to just deliver you from
[1:07:04] lying. God don't want to just deliver
[1:07:06] you from the things of the world. He
[1:07:08] wants you to live in faith. If he knows
[1:07:10] he can get you in faith, right? Those
[1:07:12] things the prophet said are the
[1:07:13] attributes of sin, which is unbelief.
[1:07:15] But if God can get you in faith, it'll
[1:07:18] take care of all of these other things
[1:07:19] out here. Right? Yeah. So verse 15 says,
[1:07:22] "When the morning arose and the angels
[1:07:24] hastened Lot, now they're rushing him,
[1:07:26] saying, arise, take thy wife and thy two
[1:07:28] daughters which are here, least thou be
[1:07:30] consumed in iniquity of the city." And
[1:07:32] while he lingered, still lingering,
[1:07:35] right? Still lingering. Uh it says, "The
[1:07:39] men laid hold upon him and upon the hand
[1:07:41] of his wife and upon the hand of his
[1:07:43] daughters, the Lord being merciful unto
[1:07:45] them." you know, but God ain't got to be
[1:07:47] merciful into him if you just listen to
[1:07:48] him the first time and just do what he
[1:07:51] says. And they brought him forth and set
[1:07:54] him without the city. So God had to
[1:07:56] force to save them. God had to drag him.
[1:08:00] And so when we come down here uh to vers
[1:08:04] um 17, it says here, "And it came to
[1:08:07] pass when they had brought them forth
[1:08:09] abroad that he said, escape for thy
[1:08:11] life. Look not behind thee, neither stay
[1:08:13] thou in a plain. Escape to the mountain,
[1:08:15] least thou be consumed. So here is
[1:08:17] another commandment going forth. But
[1:08:19] let's see what Lot's response is. And
[1:08:21] Lot said unto them, "Oh, not so, my
[1:08:26] Lord." Word after word after word. But
[1:08:30] this man doesn't have unity within
[1:08:32] himself to be able to say amen to the
[1:08:34] word. He said, "Behold now, thy servant
[1:08:37] hath found grace in thy sight, and thou
[1:08:39] hast magnified thy mercy, which thou
[1:08:41] hast shown unto me, saving in my life."
[1:08:44] Very religious.
[1:08:47] Very, very religious. God ain't looking
[1:08:49] for religion. God is looking for
[1:08:51] obedience in the word. And he said, "And
[1:08:55] I cannot escape to the mountain, though
[1:08:56] they said that he could. Least some evil
[1:08:59] take me and I die." But God had already
[1:09:02] given him the word. So if God provided
[1:09:05] him a place in the mountain, there's
[1:09:06] nothing there that's going to touch you.
[1:09:08] But because he couldn't agree with
[1:09:09] himself, he couldn't agree with the
[1:09:10] word. He said, "Behold now, this city is
[1:09:14] nearer to thee to flee, and is it and it
[1:09:16] is a little one? Oh, let me escape
[1:09:18] thither. Is it not a little one? And my
[1:09:20] soul shall live." So here he's wanting
[1:09:22] to go to another city. God's trying to
[1:09:24] deliver him out of this stuff. But this
[1:09:27] man doesn't have unity with inside of
[1:09:29] himself and he wants to mix the word
[1:09:31] with his own idea. Right? And and and
[1:09:35] the sad thing about this and what we
[1:09:37] have to be careful about is that it
[1:09:40] wasn't just Lot but Lot's wife. So Lot's
[1:09:44] wife, you know, she was dragged out the
[1:09:46] city. She walked with Solomon, which
[1:09:49] means that uh not Solomon, Lot, she
[1:09:51] walked with him, which means that she
[1:09:53] had an intellectual belief in salvation.
[1:09:55] The Bible said she turned in her heart
[1:09:58] back to the city and was turned to a
[1:10:00] pillar of a pillar of salt. Right? So,
[1:10:04] we need each man to agree. It can't just
[1:10:06] be a conscious thing. Can't just be
[1:10:08] within our spirit. It's got to be down
[1:10:10] there in the soul as well, right?
[1:10:13] Because that's what God is uh uh looking
[1:10:15] for, right? And uh Abraham in contrast,
[1:10:18] you know, he was just standing on the
[1:10:20] word. I mean, his body said one thing,
[1:10:22] but he stood with the word, right? His
[1:10:24] spirit said one thing, his reasoning
[1:10:26] said one thing, but he stood with the
[1:10:28] word. And that's why we have to have
[1:10:29] unity within ourselves. We have to have
[1:10:31] unity between the body, the spirit and
[1:10:34] the mind. Uh uh, brother Brandham talked
[1:10:36] about how, you know, some people will
[1:10:38] come up to the prayer line. They he he
[1:10:40] he'll say, you know, do you believe you
[1:10:42] can be healed? They say, "I believe."
[1:10:43] And he says, "Man, you I can see you
[1:10:46] don't believe." Right? So in their
[1:10:48] intellectual mindset, they're saying,
[1:10:50] "Amen." But deep down in the soul, the
[1:10:53] soul is like, "Well, I don't know."
[1:10:55] Right? It's because they don't have
[1:10:57] oneness. But when you receive oneness
[1:11:00] with inside of yourself, when you can
[1:11:02] get the soul to say amen, then the the
[1:11:05] uh the spirit will say amen. And then
[1:11:07] you force the body says that you you
[1:11:09] command your flesh to obey the word. And
[1:11:12] then once the word believes, now you can
[1:11:15] have results, right? There was a man
[1:11:17] that came up to the prophet who was
[1:11:19] blind. And the brother said, "Hey man,
[1:11:21] God healed you. Go on." Now, that was
[1:11:23] one person speaking inside of that old
[1:11:25] man, inside of that blind man because he
[1:11:27] believed. Then he went on out there and
[1:11:29] was one week happened, still blind. Two
[1:11:32] weeks happened, was still blind. Three
[1:11:34] weeks happened, still blind. Came right
[1:11:35] back up to the prophet. Now, this is a
[1:11:37] different person talking because the
[1:11:40] first one had faith. Came to the
[1:11:42] prophet, I thought you said I was
[1:11:44] healed. The prophet said, I thought you
[1:11:45] said you believed.
[1:11:48] All right. So each person on the inside,
[1:11:50] so in his soul, he believed, but maybe
[1:11:53] somewhere in his conscious, it's like,
[1:11:55] well, you know what? This ain't
[1:11:56] possible, man. I thought this man said
[1:11:58] that I was healed. So it was another
[1:12:00] word coming, right? And brother Brandon
[1:12:02] had told him, "Hey, this is what you
[1:12:03] need to do. You've already got the word.
[1:12:05] Just uh uh water with praise." And so
[1:12:09] then he kept praising the word. He kept
[1:12:10] encouraging. He ke that was the spirit.
[1:12:13] That was a soul belief. But now he's
[1:12:14] getting the spirit. He's singing. He's
[1:12:16] praising. He's saying extra, extra.
[1:12:18] write it on the paper. Hey, I can see. I
[1:12:20] can see. And then one day when he was on
[1:12:23] uh they said that he was at the barber
[1:12:25] shop and they was trying to get him to
[1:12:27] doubt. The enemy is always going to try
[1:12:28] to get you to doubt, but just hold to
[1:12:30] the word. He said, "Extra, extra I can
[1:12:32] see his eyes popped up because sooner or
[1:12:35] later the flesh just had to agree with
[1:12:38] the oneness that was in his soul. He had
[1:12:40] got his soul to agree with his spirit
[1:12:42] and the flesh had to follow suit. Now
[1:12:45] you have one being right you have
[1:12:48] oneness in a person and with oneness you
[1:12:50] can have results right without oneness
[1:12:53] there is no result without oneness
[1:12:56] you're not going anywhere in life
[1:12:57] without oneness you're not having any
[1:12:59] kind of victory but as soon as you can
[1:13:01] get the soul to believe right as soon as
[1:13:03] the soul believes as soon as the spirit
[1:13:05] believes and the body believes and they
[1:13:07] believe in the word now you have a you
[1:13:10] have a being that is in the image of God
[1:13:12] because when God came down in the spirit
[1:13:14] he said the word when Jesus came Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ came down he said the word they
[1:13:18] tried to trick him up and say hey you're
[1:13:19] trying to change Moses he said I didn't
[1:13:21] come to change Moses law I'm just
[1:13:23] expounding upon it to show they was
[1:13:25] trying to trip him up and make him into
[1:13:27] two or three gods but he said no no no
[1:13:28] no no we it's one person and he came
[1:13:32] into the holy spirit of the prophet and
[1:13:34] came and deliver us the word and now the
[1:13:36] prophet come and said if you can't find
[1:13:38] Christ in every single verse you need to
[1:13:40] go back to show God the son the holy
[1:13:43] ghost all agree, right? And when God if
[1:13:47] God can agree and get us to to agree,
[1:13:50] then we can have uh true unity. Amen.
[1:13:55] Amen. God bless you all. And we're going
[1:13:57] to uh just end this in a little
[1:14:00] prayer. Lord Jesus Christ, Lord, your
[1:14:02] word has come forth. Oh Lord God, Lord,
[1:14:05] we realize how important unity is, oh
[1:14:08] Lord God. And it can't it can't be it
[1:14:11] can't be three beings inside of us with
[1:14:13] different opinions, oh Lord, about what
[1:14:15] you've said, oh Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:14:17] can't move on like that, oh Lord God.
[1:14:20] Lord, help us, oh Lord God, to receive
[1:14:22] the word, oh Lord God, and then to
[1:14:24] command our spirit, Lord God, to command
[1:14:26] our flesh to line up with that word,
[1:14:29] Lord Jesus Christ, no matter how long it
[1:14:31] takes, oh Lord God. Lord, if we've been
[1:14:34] if we've truly been baptized, oh Lord
[1:14:36] God, and become the seed of Abraham, oh
[1:14:38] Lord, Abraham had faithful, Lord God, in
[1:14:41] spite of what his body was telling him,
[1:14:43] oh uh in spite of what his spirit was
[1:14:45] telling him, oh Lord God, in his soul,
[1:14:47] he believed the word, oh Lord God, help
[1:14:50] us, oh Lord, to have unity within
[1:14:51] ourselves, oh Lord God, so that we can
[1:14:53] get results, oh Lord God. Lord, it's not
[1:14:56] it's not sometimes it's not us waiting
[1:14:58] on you, but you're waiting on us, oh
[1:15:00] Lord Jesus Christ. You're waiting on us
[1:15:02] to line up. Oh Lord God, you've already
[1:15:05] showed, oh Lord God, that you can only
[1:15:07] dwell in a vessel that has unity which
[1:15:09] can bring about results. Lord, I pray
[1:15:11] that you would sprinkle the sprinkle the
[1:15:13] seeds of the word over your people. Oh
[1:15:15] Lord God, that in their situations, oh
[1:15:18] Lord God, Lord, they're striving for
[1:15:20] unity, too. Oh Lord, we're striving for
[1:15:22] unity into the church, oh Lord Jesus
[1:15:24] Christ. Lord, we're asking you, oh Lord
[1:15:26] God, to help us get to that place, oh
[1:15:28] Lord God, where we can have total faith,
[1:15:30] oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, there was
[1:15:32] many times in the Bible uh during the
[1:15:35] message that pro the brother Brandon was
[1:15:37] said, "Help thou my unbelief, oh Lord
[1:15:40] God." Lord, we want want unity within
[1:15:43] our soul and our spirit and our body, oh
[1:15:45] Lord God, to say amen to the word, oh
[1:15:48] Lord God. Lord, if there's any unbelief,
[1:15:50] help our unbelief, oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:15:52] so that we can be a one. We even though
[1:15:54] we may be a triune being, we can be one,
[1:15:56] oh Lord, like you have oneness in your
[1:15:59] trinity, oh Lord God. Bless your people,
[1:16:01] oh Lord God. Be with us, oh Lord God,
[1:16:03] and make this a revelation so that we
[1:16:05] can have victory in the precious name of
[1:16:07] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
