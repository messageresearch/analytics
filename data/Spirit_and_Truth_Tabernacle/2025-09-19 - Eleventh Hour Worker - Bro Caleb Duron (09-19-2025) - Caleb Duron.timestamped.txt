[8:25] down. The Lord loveth the righteous.

[44:40] bribes like that

[44:48] when brother Brandon was on the earth,
[44:50] there were many people that made drives
[44:52] like that to get into services and and
[44:54] God would always uh honor the people's
[44:57] faith. And I believe Jesus Christ is the
[45:00] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[45:03] And we would put our amens in like that,
[45:06] then I believe God moves on the scene.
[45:09] Amen. just for us. We thank God for um

[46:11] Palm Beach and um and and I brother

[46:26] your sacrifice. We thank you for um you
[46:30] know just just having in your heart to
[46:32] come and be a part amen. Of what God
[46:35] wants to do this weekend. Good to see
[46:36] brother Paul, amen, with us tonight from
[46:40] Bride of Christ Tabernacle. Amen.
[46:43] Certainly good to to have him with us.
[46:45] And brother Caleb will be uh ministering
[46:49] at uh their church, Bride of Christ
[46:52] Tabernacle, on uh Sunday night. Amen.
[46:55] Sunday night, the the service starts at
[46:57] 6:00 p.m. Uh and I know that you'll be
[47:00] blessed if you're able to come and be a
[47:02] part of that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um,
[47:07] some of you all we prayed on on uh
[47:10] Wednesday night. Uh, I was telling you
[47:12] about a uncle of mine that that needed a
[47:16] miracle. Uh, but on last night, the Lord
[47:20] called him home. And uh, we are uh
[47:23] certainly um grateful for the life that
[47:27] my uncle lived. Amen. He was a a a
[47:31] minister here in the area, Baptist
[47:33] minister for um 40 years or so. And uh
[47:38] but he was at 85 years old. His his
[47:41] birthday was coming up October 3rd, I
[47:43] believe. He would have been 86. But um
[47:46] the Lord saw fit to call him home. It
[47:47] was to me um very ironic.
[47:52] Um,
[47:54] when I tell you what happened to him,
[47:55] it's almost like that happened to
[47:57] somebody, but it happened to him. Um, my
[48:01] uncle was at Walmart with his wife and
[48:05] they were um
[48:08] getting her eyes checked there in the in
[48:10] the eyeglass area. And um and then, you
[48:14] know, he um he he saw a sign said, "No
[48:18] eating or drinking in this area." So he
[48:20] decided to get up and take his chips and
[48:24] um and go and and eat the chips uh in
[48:28] another area. And he got over there
[48:30] eating the chips and start choking on a
[48:32] chip. And um they did the Heimlick
[48:36] maneuver on him and and um I you know
[48:40] and they had to call the paramedics and
[48:43] um he had a heart attack through all of
[48:47] that and the Lord called him home. Uh it
[48:50] was very ironic, you know, for something
[48:52] like that to happen, but all I can say
[48:54] is that, you know, it was it was God's
[48:57] time uh for for Uncle Henry. So, we ask
[49:01] that you just continue to keep the
[49:02] family in prayers. You all are aware we
[49:04] have another funeral on tomorrow uh with
[49:08] another relative and then next weekend,
[49:10] I believe, uh we'll have to deal with
[49:13] this. But God is still good
[49:16] uh all the time and all the time. God is
[49:20] good. So, thank you for your prayers.
[49:21] Thank you for the text messages and
[49:24] everything. We just appreciate Amen. you
[49:26] reaching out to us uh during this time.
[49:28] But, Amen. God is in control. So, I just
[49:31] don't think it was um accident,
[49:35] amen, that God orchestrated this weekend
[49:38] to happen at this time. Amen. And God
[49:41] already foresaw all of that, right? And
[49:44] uh so I was glad that, you know, we had
[49:46] a preacher for the weekend and uh and
[49:49] and and I'm glad, amen, that brother
[49:51] Caleb is with us again. Amen. So let us
[49:55] uh stand to our feet and prepare to
[49:57] welcome uh Brother Caleb Duron uh to the
[50:01] pull pit. Amen. on tonight.
[50:10] How sweet

[52:29] The devil tries to stop you, but God
[52:31] says it's going to happen anyway. The
[52:33] devil tries to slow you down, but God
[52:35] said, "Don't worry. We're going to go on

[52:58] Tabernacle. It's been a while and but I
[53:01] can't really talk about it because it's
[53:02] been laundered for other people. So, uh

[53:15] ago at the computer.
[53:18] Oh, she Oh, I don't want to do that. But
[53:21] when I saw her, she I came in. She She
[53:23] let me give her a big old hug. I said,
[53:24] "Old friends. Old friends." We was
[53:26] talking on the way over here. Where's
[53:27] Mima? Mima, we love you. We was talking
[53:30] about that time we went to um July 4th.
[53:35] and and sister ca she she Mima found
[53:39] these two wonderful chairs that I'm
[53:43] going to tell the story now that
[53:45] somebody had thrown away and she said
[53:48] look at you all laughing and she said uh
[53:51] let's go to the beach I'm going to show
[53:52] y'all uh fireworks over the water we're
[53:54] excited so she said brother would you
[53:56] carry the would you be a gentleman I
[53:58] said sure so I carried them all the way
[54:00] how far do we walk about a mile or so
[54:02] seemed like that with these two foldable
[54:05] collapsible chairs. And we get there and
[54:08] I straighten them out and I go to sit in
[54:10] one and down I go.
[54:13] And I don't know if it was her or Sister
[54:14] Bird, but somebody said, "Save the
[54:16] preacher. Save the preacher."
[54:19] I looked at her and she goes, "I guess I
[54:20] should have just left them where there."
[54:21] I said, "You do that."
[54:23] She said, "I won't be doing that no
[54:25] more." I said, "Okay." And I got them. I
[54:27] put it in the trash can. I went to take
[54:29] a picture. And she goes, "Why are you
[54:30] doing I said, "I want to remember where
[54:32] I buried these things cuz that's where
[54:35] they belong." But that was a good story.
[54:38] Like we wouldn't have had those chairs.
[54:39] It would have just been fireworks.
[54:41] But you know that what's what fun is
[54:44] that without the preacher going down.
[54:47] Sister Anne never sat in her chair. She
[54:48] just kind of looked at me.
[54:51] What are you doing?
[54:54] Nothing. Falling. God bless you. It's
[54:56] good to be back. I want to just
[54:57] introduce a few people here if you don't
[54:59] mind. our head deacon, brother Jeff and
[55:01] his wife are here with us today. So, God
[55:03] bless you. Amen. There you are. All
[55:05] right.
[55:08] And then one of our translators and his
[55:10] wife, Brother Joe and Sister Edmonita
[55:12] right there. You raise your hands right
[55:14] there. All right. And then we have our
[55:17] youth pastor and his They're the ones
[55:19] who drove. Would you all stand up? Come
[55:21] on, sit up.
[55:23] They're the ones who drove. Yeah. God
[55:25] bless you. God bless you. I think I'm
[55:28] going to we're talking we're in
[55:30] negotiations
[55:32] uh to drive to Alabama next month
[55:34] because I don't you know plane tickets
[55:35] and all that. So we'll see how that
[55:36] goes. Um we'll see how that goes. And
[55:40] then we have the assistant to the pastor
[55:42] which means that I call him for just
[55:43] about everything. Brother Alzer and his
[55:45] wife and sister-in-law and sister Sophie
[55:48] came with. Would you all stand right
[55:49] quick just so they can see who you are
[55:50] and then greet you? All right. They know
[55:52] brother Jeff. They should. Anyway, I
[55:55] think some of them have changed, but
[55:56] most of them are the same. And then our
[55:58] assistant pastor, Brother Jesse, and his
[56:00] wife, sister Dawson, would you would you
[56:01] raise your hand or stand if you want to?
[56:03] Yeah, go ahead. No, stand up. We got to
[56:04] make them more redder than they are.
[56:06] It's all right. God bless you. Thank
[56:08] you. I I took one look at them. I said,
[56:11] "Well, you can tell they've been to the
[56:12] beach.
[56:15] The rest of us just got color.
[56:20] They got color, too.
[56:22] You ever heard that joke where that guy
[56:23] said color and they said who you calling
[56:25] color? White people turn green when
[56:26] they're sick,
[56:28] gray when they're scared, purple when
[56:30] they're when they're dying, red when
[56:33] they're hot.
[56:35] So anyway,
[56:37] we'll settle that. And then uh and then
[56:40] uh of course you saw Sister Anne and
[56:42] Naen. Did Naen stand up and get
[56:44] embarrassed yet? Oh, Naen, please stand
[56:45] up and get embarrassed. They have to do
[56:46] it. Come. Hey, get up. All right.
[56:51] didn't last long. All right. And then
[56:54] last but not the least, our sister
[56:55] Deborah Mariah is with us tonight. Now,
[56:57] this young lady is 28 years old. And
[57:00] just as a testimony, she died after
[57:03] having a seizure in my home. She stays
[57:05] with my wife and I. And the Lord allowed
[57:08] me to call her name twice and she came
[57:09] back to life and she's been with us ever
[57:11] since. So, I mean, back stronger. So,
[57:13] would you just stand up? Let everybody
[57:14] see what a dead person walking looks
[57:16] like.
[57:17] [Music]
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:20] Ah, we all got stories.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; We had a journey on the way over here.
[57:25] Uh, we were supposed to be here
[57:26] yesterday, but I won't talk about
[57:27] something that took place
[57:29] on Wednesday night, but I won't publicly
[57:31] mention it. But I'll tell you what, the
[57:32] devil tries everything,
[57:36] &gt;&gt; but God is in control. So what do you I
[57:39] wish the devil would get a revelation
[57:42] &gt;&gt; and find out that he does not have a
[57:44] chance
[57:46] &gt;&gt; to stop the bride of Jesus Christ.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; There's no opportunity there. There's
[57:52] nothing that's going to say, "Okay, this
[57:53] is going to work." Right? Can he stop
[57:56] you? I'm talking to you. Can he stop
[57:58] you? No. Can he stop you? No. Your your
[58:01] drum did something funny. I saw a little
[58:02] plastic. What was that about? But he
[58:05] didn't stop you from playing, did he?
[58:06] All right. That's what I'm getting at.
[58:08] When you're sold out to what you're
[58:09] supposed to be doing,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; God ain't going to stop. I mean, the
[58:12] devil ain't going to stop you. God's
[58:13] going to keep you going. Amen. God will
[58:15] not allow him to stop you.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; So, we have a phrase in our church that
[58:19] we take it from the greatest battle ever
[58:20] fought. And something Brother Brandham
[58:22] says a couple of times, but mainly once.
[58:24] He said it real strong. He said, "Don't
[58:26] you stop for nothing."
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. Well, it looks
[58:33] like I'm preaching to my church right
[58:35] here.
[58:37] So, this is weird.
[58:40] You've heard this before, but you better
[58:41] say amen. I don't want I I walked in.
[58:43] The first thing I said to brother Alli
[58:44] was, "What are you doing on the back
[58:45] row?" We don't sit in the back row in
[58:47] church. He goes, "I knew you were going
[58:49] to say something."
[58:51] Man. All right. Well, God bless you and
[58:53] welcome back to the house of God. Try
[58:54] not to keep you too long if the Lord is
[58:56] willing. Uh would you stand now for the
[58:58] reading of the word and we'll start to
[59:00] move into Thank you, musicians.
[59:02] Appreciate you.
[59:05] All right. Matthew chapter 20.
[59:10] I'm going to start off with uh let me
[59:12] see here.
[59:16] We'll just read the first verse and then
[59:18] I I'll expound on it here as we go
[59:19] along. Is that all right?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. Now, do we
[59:25] have translators here? Do I have to go
[59:26] slow or is it just English?
[59:29] Do we just Okay. Well, sometimes it's we
[59:31] have Creole translators and French, you
[59:34] know, all that. So, I want to make sure.
[59:35] We're looking forward to coming on
[59:35] Sunday night. God bless you. Thank you
[59:37] for being here, by the way. Oh, so
[59:38] sorry, brother Jack.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; No, see the reflexes are still there.
[59:42] See?
[59:45] Praise the Lord. All right. Uh, and it
[59:47] says like this, for the kingdom of
[59:49] heaven is like unto a man that is an
[59:52] householder, which went out early in the
[59:55] morning to hire labors into his
[59:57] vineyard.
[59:59] And then let's read verse two. And when
[1:00:00] he had agreed with the laborers for such
[1:00:03] a penny, he sent them into his vineyard.
[1:00:06] And he went out about the third hour,
[1:00:08] and saw others standing idle in the
[1:00:10] marketplace, doing nothing. And he said
[1:00:13] unto them, "Go ye also into the
[1:00:15] vineyard, and who whatsoever is right, I
[1:00:18] will give you." And they went their way.
[1:00:22] Again he went out about the sixth and
[1:00:24] ninth hour and did likewise. Now, here's
[1:00:26] where I want to be today at the sixth
[1:00:28] verse. And it says this. And about the
[1:00:31] 11th hour, he went out and found others
[1:00:36] standing idle and saith unto them, saith
[1:00:38] unto them, why stand here idle? Amen.
[1:00:41] Father, we ask you to bless the reading
[1:00:43] of your word. Bless the message that'll
[1:00:45] go forth and whatever it is that you
[1:00:47] want to say. Lord, I pray that you relay
[1:00:50] it to the people clearly and may they
[1:00:53] receive it as a revelation in Jesus
[1:00:55] Christ's name. For there is no other
[1:00:57] name greater. Amen. And amen. God bless.
[1:01:00] You may be seated.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; I can tell I'm going to get hot, so I'm
[1:01:04] just going to take this off. That's all
[1:01:06] right with you.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Well, that feels better.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; It's a nice place.
[1:01:15] I told brother Jack, "It's you're going
[1:01:17] to be here for a minute." And he goes,
[1:01:18] "I like that. For a minute." I said,
[1:01:20] "Yes, for a minute." God has a place for
[1:01:22] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the end of the road.
[1:01:26] And we sit there and we think to
[1:01:28] ourselves, well, it didn't happen like
[1:01:29] this. It didn't happen like But God
[1:01:31] knows how it's supposed to happen
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and when it's going to happen. He has
[1:01:35] the place ready. And it's it's u it's
[1:01:39] sweet because I told Brother Jack, "Did
[1:01:40] you see that one building on the way
[1:01:42] over here?" I said, "That's where I
[1:01:43] always thought I you all should be." And
[1:01:44] he goes, "What building is that?" And I
[1:01:46] said, "Well, we was driving." He goes,
[1:01:47] "Well, show it to me later. We'll see
[1:01:48] what happened." So, well, I saw it. I
[1:01:51] like it. I don't know what the Lord's
[1:01:52] going to do with it, but it just got a
[1:01:54] beautiful setting on a big piece of
[1:01:55] land. I said, "That's what we need to
[1:01:56] have here." And I say we because we're
[1:01:58] all in it together. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling him that we're
[1:02:03] planning on making an addition and and
[1:02:04] uh if the Lord is willing, oh, we'll
[1:02:06] talk dates tonight. Maybe we sit down
[1:02:07] and talk. But I've invited Brother Jack
[1:02:09] to come back out in December. and uh
[1:02:12] also a brother from Alabama and he's
[1:02:15] already agreed. We'll just have to see
[1:02:16] how it works out but hopefully brother
[1:02:18] not you brother Shelly. Yeah. He looked
[1:02:20] at me like I didn't agree to nothing.
[1:02:23] You agreed to come depending on the
[1:02:25] date. All right. So we'll settle it. He
[1:02:27] looked at me like uhuh.
[1:02:31] Caught you quick, man. I'm watching you,
[1:02:33] brother Jack.
[1:02:34] You know what a good a definition of a
[1:02:37] friend is? Has anybody ever heard that?
[1:02:40] Somebody Give me a second. Who has not
[1:02:43] who you have not seen for a while,
[1:02:45] right? Can you hear me?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; But when you see them, you pick up right
[1:02:49] where you left off.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; There's no awkwardness or uncomfortable
[1:02:54] feeling,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; You're not looking at each other all
[1:02:57] suspicious.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You're just happy to see each other.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And when I saw Brother Jack, I gave him
[1:03:03] a big long strong warm hug. I said,
[1:03:05] "Brother Jackie, it's good to see." You
[1:03:07] know how brother Jackie, he walked up
[1:03:08] like, "Hey, brother Caleb." I was I
[1:03:09] hugged him. over here.
[1:03:12] He had to hug me back.
[1:03:14] Would you give me that hand? Come on.
[1:03:18] Now, what we've noticed at the church,
[1:03:20] and I want most of you, I want everybody
[1:03:22] to take this, but young people, I want
[1:03:23] you to pay attention to this. If I could
[1:03:25] ask you a question, if you don't want
[1:03:27] anybody to know, I guess you could not
[1:03:29] raise your hand if you don't want to, or
[1:03:30] I can ask the adults to lower their eyes
[1:03:32] for a second, but I don't think it's
[1:03:33] nothing to be ashamed of. I want to ask
[1:03:35] you young people, all people, but mostly
[1:03:38] young, have you ever felt like you have
[1:03:41] nothing to do in the church? And I'm not
[1:03:43] talking about musicians, and I'm not
[1:03:45] talking about uh running the sound, but
[1:03:47] like what part of the body are you
[1:03:49] fitting into?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Have has any of you young people felt
[1:03:52] the way? Can I see your hands go up?
[1:03:53] Yeah. Okay, good. Thank you. All right.
[1:03:55] And some of ours here, and you're
[1:03:56] sitting there, you're wondering like,
[1:03:58] how how does this message how does it
[1:04:00] relate to me? I never saw Brother
[1:04:02] Brandham. Any hands?
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. I never knew brother
[1:04:05] Brandham. I I don't know how this is
[1:04:07] supposed to work for me. Like, how do I
[1:04:08] fit into this?
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Uh, by the way, Brother Jack, I don't
[1:04:12] know if you knew. Did you all hear that
[1:04:13] brother Bisco passed away?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; You know, as far as I know, and if if
[1:04:18] memory serves me right, he is the last
[1:04:21] remaining true witness to walking with
[1:04:24] brother Brown.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think about it. Brother
[1:04:27] Billy Paul's gone. Brother Green is
[1:04:28] gone. Brother Muse is gone. Brother
[1:04:30] Collins is gone. Brother Lee Bell's been
[1:04:33] gone. There's a there's quite a few of
[1:04:34] them. Brother Coen, uh, uh, Coleman is
[1:04:36] gone. Brother Hunt is gone. There's
[1:04:38] quite a few. Brother Wesco, a lot of
[1:04:40] them that knew him and they're all that
[1:04:42] walked, not just knew who he was, not
[1:04:45] just came in when he was there or here,
[1:04:47] but are gone. The ones that walked by
[1:04:50] him, talked with him, fished with him,
[1:04:51] and so forth. Brother Holland Hickerson,
[1:04:52] he's gone. So all these different ones,
[1:04:54] I think I think Brother was the last one
[1:04:58] that walked with him.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; All right. not knew him, not sat in his
[1:05:03] meeting, I said walked with him.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And to me, that's a significance. You
[1:05:07] know, can you imagine if you would uh
[1:05:11] whenever
[1:05:12] um the last disciple that walked with
[1:05:16] Jesus passed away,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; right? Now, Judas, he was the first to
[1:05:19] go,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; right? And can you imagine how it was?
[1:05:22] Well, I guess it might have it probably
[1:05:23] would have been John, maybe, right? He
[1:05:24] was the youngest. But when he went away,
[1:05:27] someone had to turn around and say,
[1:05:28] "That's the last one."
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Wow. that walked with them, talked with
[1:05:32] them, saw all the things that did.
[1:05:33] That's the last one. What are we going
[1:05:35] to do? Well, we write down what they
[1:05:37] wrote down. We write down what they said
[1:05:39] and we pass on and we keep on going. We
[1:05:41] don't stop for nothing.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I think there's significance
[1:05:46] to him passing away.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And it caused me when I found out I was
[1:05:50] somebody text me told me and then I said
[1:05:52] there there's something to that. That's
[1:05:54] the last one now.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And and I'm asking the Lord. I'm trying
[1:05:57] to do research kind of thinking, but I
[1:05:59] do believe it. And I'm not talking about
[1:06:00] brother Joseph Brenham. It wasn't he was
[1:06:01] very young. Not the same thing. So this
[1:06:04] is different.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm wondering what do we say now
[1:06:07] there there there's there's got to be uh
[1:06:10] we could it was never about the
[1:06:12] witnesses.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; It was never about those men who saw who
[1:06:16] fished and all these stories. Those are
[1:06:18] great stories. But we couldn't we we
[1:06:20] leaned on brother Brandham's coattail
[1:06:22] long enough. Come on.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; We leaned on Brother Green's coattail
[1:06:28] long enough
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; and all those other witnesses. Now, what
[1:06:32] are we supposed to do?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what we do. We have to
[1:06:35] walk where none of them have ever walked
[1:06:38] before.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Green has never walked in a
[1:06:42] rapture.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Green has never had a body
[1:06:46] change.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll has never experienced
[1:06:48] what it is to live in this last day.
[1:06:52] Now, he lived it, but now we're here.
[1:06:54] We're not He's on his way. We're on our
[1:06:55] way walking. We are going. They never
[1:06:59] walk from death unto life and keep on
[1:07:01] walking.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; They're taking a nap. But we are the
[1:07:05] people who are going to keep on walking,
[1:07:08] never see death, never close their eyes,
[1:07:10] never be buried, never died, walk from
[1:07:13] this place to the next place.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; We are doing what nobody else has ever
[1:07:18] done before.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what about brother? What
[1:07:23] about brother?" Even he had to rest for
[1:07:25] a while.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind it.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; You see, we can't keep walking depending
[1:07:30] on people that have gone by.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; We can't. As long as we got that
[1:07:34] brother, as long as we got this brother,
[1:07:35] well, those brothers are gone. Now, it
[1:07:37] depends on you. The burden is on your
[1:07:40] shoulders now.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You've got to carry the cross.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to show the young people how
[1:07:47] to get there.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to become as a young
[1:07:50] person, say, "Lord, what must I do and
[1:07:52] get over to the other side?"
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say, "Amen."
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And so for you that I'm asking, uh, have
[1:08:00] you ever been there? Have you ever
[1:08:01] thought this? Well, believe it or not,
[1:08:04] uh, when I started a church in Tucson, I
[1:08:08] got to thinking the same way. For the
[1:08:10] longest time, I wouldn't, and you just
[1:08:12] forgive me. I'm going to just be honest
[1:08:13] with you so you understand. I hope we I
[1:08:16] hope you're not going to stand up there
[1:08:17] and lie to us, brother Caleb. I don't
[1:08:20] like it when people say to be honest.
[1:08:22] Oh, were you lying before?
[1:08:25] Thanks for the clar thanks for the
[1:08:26] clarification. I didn't realize you were
[1:08:28] a liar before. All right. Um,
[1:08:35] y'all not gonna say that no more, huh?
[1:08:36] You're gonna lie,
[1:08:38] brother Jack. If they do, you just turn
[1:08:40] around and say, "Were you lying before?"
[1:08:43] When I started Amazing Grace, I I I
[1:08:46] didn't call our We didn't call ourselves
[1:08:47] a message church. We still don't. Watch
[1:08:50] me carefully. We call ourselves a
[1:08:52] Christian church. If I'm asked, are you
[1:08:54] denomination? You fellowship? You what
[1:08:56] are you? Denomination, non-denomination.
[1:08:57] We're non-denominational. We are a
[1:08:59] Christian church that follows
[1:09:01] the message of Malachi 4.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you a message church? No,
[1:09:06] I'm not.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you how can you tell the
[1:09:09] difference? There is a difference. If
[1:09:10] you watch and look closely,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; we might quote him and we will quote him
[1:09:14] and we say what he says, but we're not
[1:09:16] leaving the quote on the page.
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; A message church typically leaves the
[1:09:26] quote on the page,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; just like the Baptists have left God's
[1:09:30] word on the page,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; just like the Catholics have left it on
[1:09:35] their own Bible someplace. Just like the
[1:09:37] Mormons have made up their own Bible,
[1:09:39] just like the the the theologians of
[1:09:41] old, they leave the doctrines. They turn
[1:09:43] them into some theology, some kind of a
[1:09:45] heavyduty thought process, some kind of
[1:09:47] a doctrine, and they leave it on the
[1:09:50] page.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Their life is not a life change. Their
[1:09:53] life is something mimicked. is but is
[1:09:55] ran and governed by rules of dos and
[1:09:58] don'ts. But there's never nothing on the
[1:10:00] inside that changes them from glory to
[1:10:02] glory to glory glory glory glory glory
[1:10:05] all the way through till the end.
[1:10:06] There's nothing that brings them from
[1:10:08] one thing to the other thing.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; So if it's all right with you and I'm
[1:10:15] not excluding you, brother Jack. I think
[1:10:16] we're on the same page. Yes, sir.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; But that's how I answer the question.
[1:10:20] And the reason why I say that is because
[1:10:22] I'm not here to be another message
[1:10:23] church. I want to be a church that
[1:10:25] follows the message. Let the message
[1:10:27] jump off the page and clothe me in the
[1:10:29] in the wedding in the bride's uh uh gown
[1:10:32] and get me ready for a body change. Take
[1:10:34] me to a wedding supper. Take me to a
[1:10:36] rapture and get me off this place that I
[1:10:39] don't belong anymore.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And for a while we we didn't have no
[1:10:46] friends in Tucson.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; We got quiet. What happened to all the
[1:10:50] amens? Right.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's all right. in Tucson. We didn't
[1:10:52] have no, right, brother Jeff? Ain't
[1:10:54] nobody want to fellowship with us.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Then you know what we started doing? We
[1:10:57] started having non-denominational
[1:10:58] brothers come.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; We had a brother from Hawaii and brother
[1:11:01] Nelson. He came and he had long black
[1:11:03] hair and and uh uh we don't think
[1:11:06] nothing of it. But when people caught
[1:11:07] wind of it, they said, "Look what he's
[1:11:08] doing. He's not even a message believer
[1:11:10] anymore."
[1:11:12] Right?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; We had this big old uh Jamaican brother.
[1:11:15] What's that brother's name? Bailey.
[1:11:17] Reverend Bailey. Big old Jamaican
[1:11:18] brother. He got up there. He knew just
[1:11:20] how to. You could tell he was trained,
[1:11:22] man. Cuz he knew how to get us fired up.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But he was a brother nonetheless.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; And I had somebody say, "Well, why are
[1:11:30] you having these guys?" And said, "Cuz
[1:11:32] nobody in Tucson wants to come preach
[1:11:33] for me."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Well, why is that? I said, "Because they
[1:11:36] wanted to draw me out of the circle."
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Because I didn't do what they do.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Because I don't tear my kids up when
[1:11:43] they dress this way or dress that way or
[1:11:45] if they misbehave. Look, that's all part
[1:11:47] of it. But I want them to change from
[1:11:49] the inside
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; out.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we got all that training
[1:11:55] because the kids we got in there now.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; We got nose rings, ear rings, nasal
[1:12:02] rings, bull rings, long hair, short
[1:12:04] hair. And I'm looking at them like, but
[1:12:05] they're still God's children.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you what, they're
[1:12:09] saying amen louder than the believer
[1:12:11] that's been in this 40 plus years.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; They're on fire more than the person
[1:12:15] that's been on there 40 plus years. I
[1:12:16] told brother Jack the other day, I said,
[1:12:17] "You know what? Understand?" I said,
[1:12:19] "They're saying amen in the quotes."
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; And then I said, "I have yet." Have you
[1:12:24] brothers been asked at all who brother
[1:12:25] Brandham is?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I have yet to We have yet to be asked
[1:12:30] who is this brother Brandham y'all keep
[1:12:32] talking about.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Who is the seven seventh angel? Who are
[1:12:35] the other six? Nothing. They're not
[1:12:37] asking us what are you reading? What
[1:12:39] what's seven seal book? When I told them
[1:12:41] it was open and different things
[1:12:42] happened here, here, all they're doing
[1:12:44] is looking for tears coming down their
[1:12:46] eyes. They're crying and they're
[1:12:47] shouting, "That's right, brother. Amen,
[1:12:49] brother." And I'm going, "There's no way
[1:12:50] they know what I'm talking about." But
[1:12:52] Jesus said, "What about the 11th hour
[1:12:55] worker?"
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; We've been looking for it, hadn't we?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; We thought we were. And I'm going to
[1:13:04] tell you, if you if you've been in this
[1:13:05] long a long time, and if you've been in
[1:13:07] this message a long time and you haven't
[1:13:09] yet understood, but suddenly, oops,
[1:13:12] things are starting to go I can't do
[1:13:14] either one. Things are starting to snap.
[1:13:16] Get into get into uh Hey, that makes
[1:13:18] sense now. Hey, I'm getting it now. All
[1:13:19] of a sudden, I'm getting it. Uh uh uh.
[1:13:21] We got a revelation of who Caleb was.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; You want to hear this one? You got a few
[1:13:26] minutes?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Caleb was Jesus's
[1:13:29] grandfather?
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. I can show you if you go in the
[1:13:34] first book of Matthew, it talks about a
[1:13:36] man named Salman or Selma and he was
[1:13:38] married to Rahab
[1:13:40] and Rahab and he
[1:13:43] are the are the ones who uh founded the
[1:13:46] city of Bethlehem. Well, who's Selma?
[1:13:48] That's Caleb's greatgrandson or
[1:13:51] grandson. Caleb had a son and then that
[1:13:54] son had a son and that guy married
[1:13:56] Rahab. And on down the line, here comes
[1:13:58] Jesus.
[1:14:02] We sat there and I looked at this thing
[1:14:04] and I said, "How in the world?" I had
[1:14:06] some scholars argue with me, some
[1:14:08] message, you know, dignitaries that say,
[1:14:10] "Well, no, Rahab married Joshua." I
[1:14:12] said, "Why would that 14year-old girl
[1:14:14] marry that hundred-year-old man?"
[1:14:17] Well, brother Brennham said, uh, she's
[1:14:19] married to a general, a mighty general.
[1:14:20] I said, "Do you think Joshua was the
[1:14:22] only mighty general in Israel?"
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Joshua would have been Israel at this
[1:14:26] time. He's not fighting anymore. He's
[1:14:27] got other mighty generals underneath
[1:14:28] him. I said, "But if you look at the
[1:14:30] lineage and if you look if you want to
[1:14:32] Google it, it's there, too."
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; So, the Gentile line has fallen all the
[1:14:38] way through. Now, you say, "What does
[1:14:39] that have to do with anything?" Well,
[1:14:41] because if God was gracious enough to
[1:14:43] show us where the Gentile bride actually
[1:14:46] began
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; in a city of Bethlehem, then it makes a
[1:14:49] whole lot more sense why the son of God
[1:14:53] had to be born in the same city that was
[1:14:55] founded by these people.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; All right? He thought so much of you
[1:14:58] that he had his only begotten he had the
[1:15:00] groom born where the bride was born.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get a little heavy, huh? And we
[1:15:08] got so excited. I had I think it was
[1:15:10] sister uh Wilson back there. She turned
[1:15:12] around. She said, "We have been reading
[1:15:14] the Bible for years. We all have. Why
[1:15:16] are we just now seeing this?"
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; So, we've been in this message how many
[1:15:23] years and we are just now seeing this.
[1:15:26] All right.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Because there is a time and a place for
[1:15:29] revelation to take part.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; God, I got quotes to what brother said.
[1:15:33] God said, "Hold this back. Hold this
[1:15:36] back. Don't do this, and don't do that
[1:15:37] until this, this, this, and this
[1:15:39] happens."
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But you see, if now we're starting to
[1:15:42] see it, then this, this, this, and this
[1:15:44] must have began or happened already.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; It's getting touching. It ain't no
[1:15:49] touch. It's like hit and miss. No, it's
[1:15:51] touch and go now.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; See, hit and miss means you hit it.
[1:15:54] Sometimes you miss it. But if you touch
[1:15:55] and now you're going, you got something,
[1:15:57] you're running with it.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; We found out the other day that they had
[1:16:03] a a mock ceremony burning the red heer.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got quiet in here again. Huh? And
[1:16:12] it came it occurred to us. We started
[1:16:14] looking at it. We thought, well, they'll
[1:16:15] build the temple and then they'll
[1:16:17] sacrifice the three red heers,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; right? But brother, the hepher was
[1:16:22] sacrificed before the temple goes up
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; to to sanctify and and thank God for the
[1:16:30] property or whatever they're going to
[1:16:31] do. Then it goes up. Then they start
[1:16:32] their sacrif then they start their
[1:16:34] sacrificial worship.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Now I'd like to see what happens when
[1:16:39] the word really gets out and all these
[1:16:41] tree huggers and animal lovers start
[1:16:44] yelling at Israel because they're
[1:16:46] burning up innocent cows.
[1:16:48] It's going to happen. You watch.
[1:16:49] Someone's going to complain, you know,
[1:16:50] some whatever the you know what I mean.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; And I thought they're doing mockery.
[1:16:55] Yeah, because you see it's been 3 years
[1:16:57] since they had one born and it has to be
[1:16:59] three and a half years old and we're
[1:17:01] getting to that mark right now. Why? Why
[1:17:02] does that mean anything? Because brother
[1:17:04] Brandham said if the temple goes up and
[1:17:07] you see the sacrificial worship again,
[1:17:09] you've missed the rapture.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm not looking to miss
[1:17:13] it. I'm watching how close we're
[1:17:14] getting. And listen, there ain't nobody
[1:17:16] in this room going to miss it. I promise
[1:17:17] you that. Now, how how can you say that?
[1:17:20] Because I know it. Because God is
[1:17:23] showing too much revelation for anybody
[1:17:25] to be left behind.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; You're not just going to be a message
[1:17:30] believer. You got to be a message doer.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; You can't just be a Bible thumper. You
[1:17:36] got to be a Bible reader and a Bible
[1:17:38] believer.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; If you're going to quote scripture, you
[1:17:41] better know what you're talking about.
[1:17:43] And if you're going to quote the quotes
[1:17:44] within, brother, quote them all and put
[1:17:47] them in the right sequence.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Don't just don't just separate your
[1:17:51] favorite and use it for your own little
[1:17:53] doctrine. It's got to match from point A
[1:17:55] to point C.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And the B in the middle is I believe
[1:17:59] Christ. Come on.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we got the 11th hour
[1:18:04] worker here. See, he says, "What are you
[1:18:06] doing standing around?" This is
[1:18:08] scriptures now. uh Matthew chapter 20
[1:18:10] and I'm at verse uh 7 and they said uh
[1:18:14] they said because uh no man has hired
[1:18:17] us. We're standing around doing nothing.
[1:18:20] Verse 7, chapter 20.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; We're standing around doing nothing
[1:18:23] because no one has hired us. Now look,
[1:18:26] Temple of Amazing Grace, if you've heard
[1:18:28] this and you said amen on Sunday, you
[1:18:30] need to say amen here.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; All right, it's not old news. It's the
[1:18:33] same news.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't want to sound like
[1:18:36] brother Brandon's kids. We prayed over
[1:18:37] that yesterday.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; It's the same food and this is
[1:18:40] different.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; We just keep on chewing it. All right.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're tired cuz they drove all
[1:18:47] that way. Huh? Lay off, Caleb. Lay off.
[1:18:50] All right. Look here. Because no man
[1:18:51] hired us. And I I wanted to point this
[1:18:54] out. You see what what happens is and
[1:18:56] many of you got friends. How many of you
[1:18:57] not not our group friends here from
[1:18:59] amazing uh spirit spirit and truth? How
[1:19:01] many got friends in school? Hands up.
[1:19:04] Hands up. Hands up.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hands up. Hands up. Come on.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; They're home.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Y'all ain't got no friends
[1:19:16] then.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Well, this this ain't going to work for
[1:19:20] y'all. I'm going to change the sermon.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But the thing is, okay, how about you
[1:19:26] grown-ups? Y'all have jobs or do you
[1:19:27] home job?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Huh? You got jobs, right?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You got friends in your job. You got
[1:19:35] acquaintances, people you know.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, here's what I was getting at. The
[1:19:38] people, one person in our church, one
[1:19:40] little lady decided to invite a boy that
[1:19:42] she'd been seeing because I keep saying
[1:19:44] if you're going to date somebody out in
[1:19:46] the world, you better bring them to
[1:19:46] church, find out what kind of person
[1:19:48] they are.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; If they don't come when you invite them,
[1:19:50] if they come and they they don't like it
[1:19:51] and they leave, well, just you better
[1:19:52] get rid of them because that ain't the
[1:19:53] right person for you.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz I can understand God can lead
[1:19:56] someone to you, but he's going to make
[1:19:58] them the right person for you.
[1:20:00] Okay, I know we want to keep it in the
[1:20:02] family, keep it in church, but look,
[1:20:04] after a while, we're marrying cousins
[1:20:05] after cousins. You can't be doing all
[1:20:07] that,
[1:20:08] and Mexicans are all related. That's it
[1:20:12] gets it gets kind of messy.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I'm being serious now.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you black people, we
[1:20:18] got cousins everywhere.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; We call each other cousin. Even they
[1:20:25] call me Theo even though I ain't your
[1:20:26] I'm not your uncle. Why?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:31] So you got friends and what happened
[1:20:33] when she invited this boy. I said,
[1:20:34] "Okay, all right." Okay. Nice native
[1:20:36] brother, long hair and everything. And I
[1:20:38] I had to tell the whole people, "Look,
[1:20:39] he's a Native American. He's got long
[1:20:40] hair. Leave him alone. I mean, that's
[1:20:42] his tradition. Don't tell him nothing.
[1:20:43] If God wants him to cut it, he'll cut
[1:20:45] it. And I won't tell you why it
[1:20:46] happened. He finally told me. But when
[1:20:48] it did, it happened." And it was all by
[1:20:49] himself. But he's already been baptized
[1:20:51] and he worships harder than anybody else
[1:20:53] I see in the young group anyway, as far
[1:20:55] as males go. And then they invited
[1:20:57] somebody. and they invited somebody and
[1:20:59] sister Sarah invited somebody and uh
[1:21:01] where's Abby? Abby. Abby. Abby, you
[1:21:03] invited somebody and then and then and
[1:21:05] they invited somebody and then and next
[1:21:06] thing you know we got all these little
[1:21:08] kids coming around all 16 17 years old.
[1:21:10] What's going on here?
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And it says here nobody hired us. We
[1:21:15] don't go to work because nobody invited
[1:21:17] us.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And we found out what was it? 95% of the
[1:21:21] people that have friends who go to
[1:21:23] church do not go to church because 95%
[1:21:26] of them said they're never invited.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not even talking message.
[1:21:33] We're just talking church in general.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I got to tell you the truth.
[1:21:38] The so-called message people turn out to
[1:21:40] be a bunch of snobs
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; because we have a truth that is greater
[1:21:43] than any truth that has ever struck the
[1:21:45] face of the earth. But we think we're
[1:21:47] better than everybody else. Oh, we're
[1:21:49] brides. So, we can't be we can't
[1:21:51] associate with you long hair, short
[1:21:53] skirt, and all. Why don't you just be a
[1:21:55] witness?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; If what you think you have is so great,
[1:22:00] then why don't you just be a witness?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Be an example and be you what the salt
[1:22:07] of the earth.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, make it taste good.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; You know, we're too busy walking around
[1:22:14] dragging our chin to the floor. I'm a
[1:22:15] Christian believer. I'm miserable.
[1:22:17] That's not salty, man. That's like
[1:22:19] putting
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; sauerkraut on toiso and eggs. That ain't
[1:22:24] gonna taste no good.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That's like putting something nasty on
[1:22:30] chicken. Like, what'd you do that for?
[1:22:32] It was fine the way it was.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You want to be the salt of the earth.
[1:22:35] You want to savor the flavor. You want
[1:22:37] to enhance it.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So, if you're going to have this
[1:22:40] attitude that you're better than
[1:22:41] everybody, you better show a life that's
[1:22:43] better.
[1:22:46] See, nobody hired us. Nobody invited us.
[1:22:48] And then what's happened is uh last
[1:22:50] Sunday we had seven more come in. But
[1:22:52] now it's changed.
[1:22:54] Instead of us asking them, it's people
[1:22:56] going, "Hey, what church do you go to?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; What church do you go to?" And I was
[1:23:00] teasing your son the other day. He I go,
[1:23:02] "What happened?" Well, they asked me.
[1:23:04] And I said, "What happened? You You
[1:23:05] figured you better show up if they show
[1:23:06] up?" And he started laughing. I told
[1:23:10] him, "You had to you had been He works a
[1:23:12] lot." And I said, "You hadn't been here
[1:23:12] in a minute. He figured how to come
[1:23:13] back. He couldn't come back
[1:23:14] empty-handed. So, he brought four
[1:23:16] friends with him. He started laughing.
[1:23:19] He said, "That's right. That's right."
[1:23:20] You know, I said, "But hey," he brought
[1:23:21] four. We just went over here. And I go,
[1:23:23] "What's going on? They're asking. It's
[1:23:25] become an epidemic in the church." And I
[1:23:27] love it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; I love it. We had one lady jump the
[1:23:31] fence to get in.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not playing. I'm witnessing to you
[1:23:36] now. I'm not bragging. I'm telling you,
[1:23:38] look, we're at the end time.
[1:23:42] the the the whole spectrum of it has
[1:23:44] changed.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Right. You said something. We don't make
[1:23:47] those sacrifices. We don't drive that
[1:23:49] far. When brother Brandon was here, we
[1:23:50] used to.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Not me. I wouldn't even lie. But they
[1:23:53] used to.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Right. But now, and I'm not I don't I
[1:23:56] don't expect all these to follow me
[1:23:58] every single time. I don't think they're
[1:23:59] following me. They just wanted to come
[1:24:00] along and bless you and see you and hear
[1:24:03] what the Lord. It just it fires us up.
[1:24:06] We go home. We see how people receive
[1:24:08] what is being said. We go home and that
[1:24:09] makes us more on fire than we were
[1:24:11] before we came out here.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; This is a family effort.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living on earth for now.
[1:24:20] How about the rest of you?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It's time to go home.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It's time to move on.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I've had it with this place.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; What happened was the gates we closed
[1:24:34] the gates. We that church is kind of in
[1:24:36] a funny neighborhood right now and got a
[1:24:37] bunch of fentanyl people walking around.
[1:24:39] You know how it is.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; So we closed the gates. We had people
[1:24:41] trying to get in cars like we can't have
[1:24:43] that, you know. So uh all of a sudden I
[1:24:45] see my deacons run out the door. All of
[1:24:48] them.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; What was it some I I told you Jesse? Was
[1:24:52] it something I said,
[1:24:55] you know, trying to make it calm? And
[1:24:56] and I go what's going on? And somebody
[1:24:58] in the back said somebody jumped the
[1:24:59] gate.
[1:25:01] Well, this day and age with all the
[1:25:02] church shootings and things we got, I
[1:25:04] said, "Hey, somebody locked that door
[1:25:06] now. Hurry up."
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; That's closest to the pastor. You want
[1:25:09] to lock that one there.
[1:25:11] Then I told everybody to calm down,
[1:25:13] relax, you know, we'll see what happens.
[1:25:14] And after a little bit, this little
[1:25:15] white lady comes walking in the door and
[1:25:17] all the digs behind her. Said, "What?
[1:25:20] What? What is this?" I said, "Are you
[1:25:22] the one that jumped the gate?" She got
[1:25:23] all embarrassed. She says, "Yeah." And
[1:25:25] she said, "What'd you jump the gate for?
[1:25:27] We would have opened it for you." She
[1:25:28] goes, "I I came to come have church with
[1:25:30] my son." Who's your son? This guy, Adam.
[1:25:33] Okay. He invited his mom and and you
[1:25:36] know what? Let's be honest.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Let's be very honest now.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; If it was you and I and the gates were
[1:25:41] closed, we'd have turned around and took
[1:25:43] off.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, bride. Am I right?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; We just said, "I guess they just don't
[1:25:51] want me here. They knew I was coming."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the attitude that we
[1:25:58] have.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; But here is a nobody. She had a need.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; She said so. After church, I had brother
[1:26:07] Nathan said, "Come up here and put hands
[1:26:08] on. I don't want I don't want to be no
[1:26:09] holy man. I'm I know what I'm trying to
[1:26:10] do here. What I want this there there's
[1:26:12] there's a time and a push me to get
[1:26:14] involved because I got ministry now. I
[1:26:15] want the people to depend on them as
[1:26:17] much as they depend on me." You
[1:26:18] understand? My job is to bring the word.
[1:26:20] You all pray for them. You all cast
[1:26:22] them. You all take care of them.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; If it's serious, I'll get involved. But
[1:26:26] I said, "Come put your hand on her." And
[1:26:27] I said, "Thus say the Lord. Whatever you
[1:26:29] have need of, whatever, if it's
[1:26:30] sickness, if it's this, if it's that,
[1:26:31] you just receive it. She started crying,
[1:26:33] raise her hand. She had a need and she
[1:26:35] was not going to leave until she got
[1:26:37] that need. So, she jumped the gate to
[1:26:40] get in.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you I have a little
[1:26:47] bit of bragging rights. So, I called up
[1:26:50] brother Israel and brother Jason. I
[1:26:51] said, "How was y'all's church
[1:26:52] yesterday?"
[1:26:54] I did. Oh, we had a good service,
[1:26:56] brother. Tremendous. Did you have
[1:26:57] anybody jump your gate to get in?
[1:27:01] I called up brother Jason said, "Brother
[1:27:02] Jason said, brother Caleb, God bless
[1:27:04] you. God bless. Hey, how was your
[1:27:05] service?" Said, "Well, we had a my," you
[1:27:06] know, "All right. Did you have anybody
[1:27:08] jump your gate to get in?"
[1:27:10] What do you mean? I said, "We had a lady
[1:27:12] jump our fence. She wasn't going to let
[1:27:13] this 7 foot, 6', 7 foot fence stop her."
[1:27:16] And she had arms.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; She had arms. She got I don't know what
[1:27:19] she I would have liked to seen it, but
[1:27:20] JJ said she like she hurdled it. I said
[1:27:22] hurled it. I would have had to try to
[1:27:25] bend it to squeeze through. not going to
[1:27:26] jump that fence.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; But somebody has a need.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And if there's a hunger and a thirst,
[1:27:33] you're going to get it. I don't care how
[1:27:36] you get it. You're going to get it and
[1:27:37] do everything you got to get it.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. See, whatever it
[1:27:46] takes, I want to take the promised land.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Whatever we do, I don't want to see
[1:27:51] death. I want to get on to the other
[1:27:53] side.
[1:27:54] Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; So, fellowship has opened up in Tucson
[1:27:58] all of a sudden. We, Brother Doro and I
[1:28:00] are we have really close churches
[1:28:01] proximity. We're 1,56 feet away from
[1:28:04] each other.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; To put that into perspective, that's
[1:28:08] across the parkway, the the parking lot
[1:28:11] here.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; I'm serious.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; In the corner store there, you'd be from
[1:28:16] here to there. Now, I can't see him, but
[1:28:17] that's all close.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It was funny. Uh I hope you don't see
[1:28:21] this. Where's the camera? Hi, brother
[1:28:23] Israel.
[1:28:25] wherever you are. I'm just playing.
[1:28:31] But we went there with me and brother
[1:28:32] Ally for a little meeting they were
[1:28:34] having and and the song leader got up
[1:28:35] and he shouldn't have started and he
[1:28:37] said, "Hey, brother Caleb, if you just
[1:28:38] leave your door open facing us, you'll
[1:28:40] hear some real real worship."
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; He's playing. He was joking. And brother
[1:28:44] Israel looked at him like, "Why'd you do
[1:28:45] that?" Because he knew I was going to
[1:28:46] get him. I said, "If you keep it open,
[1:28:48] you hear some real preaching.
[1:28:54] Brother Israel goes, Brother looked at
[1:28:56] me, he goes, "That was just foolish.
[1:28:58] Why'd you even start with him?" "Come
[1:28:59] on, Caleb." And we walked off.
[1:29:04] We're friends now. You see, he goes, "I
[1:29:06] don't even know why that boy started
[1:29:07] with you." Why did he say that? I go, he
[1:29:09] walked right into his. I'm sorry. That
[1:29:10] was not personal. He goes, I know you
[1:29:12] had to get him. I had to. But now he's
[1:29:15] preached for me and I preached for him
[1:29:17] and we're having a wonderful time. All
[1:29:18] of a sudden, people said, "Hey, I didn't
[1:29:20] know you like they're surprised. I
[1:29:21] believe the message." I never stopped.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; How often do you say Moses said?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; How often do you say Elijah said? How
[1:29:30] often do you say Jonah? But you say the
[1:29:32] Bible said, the Bible said, the Bible
[1:29:34] said.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; So because I don't say brother said,
[1:29:36] that doesn't make me a believer.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; No, it means that I mean it, I believe
[1:29:40] it. I don't have to say who said it.
[1:29:42] Because if you got the same spirit
[1:29:43] tapping in here that I got, you don't
[1:29:45] have to be told who said it. You'll know
[1:29:48] it came from God.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You'll know it came from God.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If you need proof, I'll give it to you.
[1:29:54] I'll give you Matthew chapter 1 verse
[1:29:56] 16. Whatever. Just keep on moving.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; We're hung up on who knows what. It's
[1:30:01] all about knowledge. That's not the 11th
[1:30:03] hour worker's job. Now,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; brother Ben, I have the quote with you.
[1:30:07] Brother says on the quote, he said it'll
[1:30:10] be quickened to you. He said the 11th
[1:30:13] thou worker won't have time to come and
[1:30:16] study fast and pray. He said they would
[1:30:18] go straight from the milk. They would
[1:30:20] skip the milk and go straight for the
[1:30:21] meat. Born with teeth.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It would have a revelation because it
[1:30:26] would be quickened. Look up that word
[1:30:28] quickened to them.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; So these young people all suen shouting
[1:30:33] and saying amen and screaming at me. I'm
[1:30:35] looking even I had my doubts. Brother
[1:30:36] Jack looked back. There's no way they
[1:30:38] know what I mean. And the and that's
[1:30:40] what I said a little bit ago. The Holy
[1:30:41] Spirit said, "What about the 11th hour
[1:30:42] worker?" It's being quickened to them.
[1:30:44] And I'll tell you what, somebody who's
[1:30:46] been in church 30 years, 35 years. Some
[1:30:49] of us who've been in there 25 years,
[1:30:50] whatever it is, and never really
[1:30:52] understood. We said, "Amen. We like the
[1:30:53] fellowship. We're here for the miracles.
[1:30:55] We like the spoken word, but I don't
[1:30:56] really get it. I don't." All of a
[1:30:58] sudden, I go, "Oh, what happened?" All
[1:30:59] of a sudden, I get this.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Well, what happened? You've been here
[1:31:03] all this time. I don't know. But
[1:31:04] suddenly, it's being quickened to me.
[1:31:09] Praise God.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan and I uh were invited to
[1:31:14] a a Bible uh club. They didn't have
[1:31:16] those when I was in school either. Did
[1:31:18] they have those when you were in school?
[1:31:19] That stuff was outlawed. We weren't
[1:31:21] allowed, but they have them now.
[1:31:24] And so I had a chance took Naen with me
[1:31:26] and and uh I was invited. I said,
[1:31:27] "Nathan, why don't you come with me?"
[1:31:28] And we get there and y'all told me there
[1:31:30] was like 12. And I told your cousin, I
[1:31:33] said, "Are you dyslexic or something?"
[1:31:34] There's 21 kids in here.
[1:31:37] Well, the 21 kids a pretty good group.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And they all were there for what? They
[1:31:41] wanted to hear the testimony of their
[1:31:43] pastor and how I became what I was, the
[1:31:46] kind of struggles I went through. And
[1:31:47] then they heard Nathan's testimony. And
[1:31:48] we get out of there and what, two or
[1:31:49] three of them walked up to brother
[1:31:50] Nathan said, "Where's your church at we
[1:31:52] want to go to, but they realize I have
[1:31:55] seven of them." Now I got three more of
[1:31:56] them. I said, "It won't be long. We'll
[1:31:58] get all 21 of these kids in there." And
[1:31:59] their parents are going to have to
[1:32:01] follow.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:08] So if you young people want to find out
[1:32:10] where you fit, where you fit is to keep
[1:32:12] the church alive.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; If the Lord should carry and brother
[1:32:18] Jack should pass on, which he won't.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I'm I'll say amen to you, brother Jack.
[1:32:24] Brother Jack got like,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; "Come on now,
[1:32:29] right?" I said, "And brother Jack
[1:32:30] won't." Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's a lot better than the first time.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; He got nervous.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; You just go ahead and cancel the life
[1:32:38] insurance. Don't you worry about that.
[1:32:40] Now look here. And I believe that he
[1:32:42] won't. But if he was to, then that means
[1:32:45] somebody's got to take his place.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to keep holding the Bible
[1:32:49] and moving on with God.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; And I told Brother Jesse this, and I
[1:32:52] told Brother Nathan and brother Alzer,
[1:32:54] if I die and I won't.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you.
[1:33:00] Where was you for brother Jack a minute
[1:33:02] ago? Come on now.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; And I won't. But if I should, right? If
[1:33:07] I should, I don't want the work to stop
[1:33:09] because I'm not there.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want them walking around for
[1:33:14] seven years without a pastor. I want you
[1:33:16] all to step right in and just keep on
[1:33:18] moving and don't you stop for nothing.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, well, the 11th hour, he
[1:33:26] says, okay. He said, so nobody invited
[1:33:28] you. He said, ' Then go into the
[1:33:30] vineyard. Then he goes, "No one asked
[1:33:31] you. No one want to hire you. I'll hire
[1:33:33] you. Tell you what, go off into the
[1:33:34] vineyard." He said, "Go off into the
[1:33:36] vineyard." He said, "And when you do
[1:33:38] work, whatever you think you are owed, I
[1:33:40] will pay you." And so they go off and
[1:33:43] they work and they get paid. Now, here's
[1:33:45] what happens.
[1:33:50] When it's time for everybody to get
[1:33:51] their checks and their reward, you're
[1:33:54] going to have people that said, "Well,
[1:33:56] you know, I believe Brother Brandham the
[1:33:58] whole time." You know, I was with him
[1:34:01] when this, this, and this. Because you
[1:34:04] had that when it came to Jesus. Well, I
[1:34:06] was with him when this, this, and this.
[1:34:07] They challenged Paul that way. You know
[1:34:10] what gets me about Saul before he was
[1:34:12] Paul is that Saul must have known who he
[1:34:15] was.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; How could he not have?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Wow. He was being raised to be the next
[1:34:20] high priest. I think if we look at
[1:34:21] history and the timing is so the
[1:34:23] disciples were still alive. So how did
[1:34:25] he not know? How could he not know who
[1:34:28] Jesus was?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; There had to be some kind of knowledge
[1:34:31] of who he was.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe he was just a little, you know, a
[1:34:34] youngster in the group there, but he
[1:34:35] must have seen him at least once.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I I don't have Bible on
[1:34:40] that. I just wondered. But when he had
[1:34:42] people come up to him and say, "Well, I
[1:34:43] was baptized this way and this one
[1:34:45] walked with Jesus or I was this and I
[1:34:47] was that." Paul said, "I'm glad that I
[1:34:49] didn't touch one of you because I don't
[1:34:52] want to know anything you all know
[1:34:53] except you and Jesus and him crucified
[1:34:55] and you baptized in his name.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want I'm glad I didn't baptize
[1:34:59] none of you." That's what his attitude
[1:35:01] was. And I'm sitting here thinking to
[1:35:02] myself, "Okay, fine. I don't get invited
[1:35:04] to these big shot churches. I'm glad
[1:35:06] that I've never been asked to go cuz I'd
[1:35:08] rather go to the Lord's chosen few.
[1:35:13] I don't want to go to a bunch of people
[1:35:14] who are polished up and can out quote me
[1:35:16] and tell me this and then all of a
[1:35:17] sudden God I preach like John Haggy and
[1:35:20] God said
[1:35:22] and I'm like what is that all about? Why
[1:35:25] don't you just be what you are an
[1:35:27] uneducated believer
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be polished and all
[1:35:32] shined up. Who cares about that? Yeah,
[1:35:34] I'm getting sweaty. So what?
[1:35:39] Well, brother, we're in an age where
[1:35:40] we're above shouting. Where does it say
[1:35:42] that?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; I mean, I know you know your Bible, but
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm not 91, but where does it
[1:35:49] say we're above shouting?
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Where where does it say the bride has
[1:35:53] matured and turned the corner? Well,
[1:35:55] where does it say that? I don't have
[1:35:56] that. Do you have a different Bible than
[1:35:58] I got?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; What quote? Where was that quote at?
[1:36:01] Someone give me the quote. I want to see
[1:36:02] it. It doesn't say that at all. As a
[1:36:05] matter of fact, the greater the
[1:36:06] revelation, the greater the shout.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The greater the victory, the greater the
[1:36:14] shout.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; The greater the knowledge, the greater
[1:36:17] the shout.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; The more love you have a goof, the
[1:36:21] greater the shout.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; And the shout has got to be in the
[1:36:25] enemy's camp. In the king's camp. Not in
[1:36:28] the enemy's camp, but in the king's
[1:36:30] camp. Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; What I meant to say there was it's too
[1:36:33] often the shout is in the enemy's camp
[1:36:34] is far greater than the one that's in
[1:36:36] the king's camp.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Right. And we're shaking for fear of the
[1:36:39] Philistines. They're too many. The
[1:36:41] Amalachites, they're too many. The
[1:36:43] websites, they're everywhere. You can
[1:36:44] see anything.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; We can look up this and we can check up
[1:36:51] this guy and check that one out. We find
[1:36:53] out this, we find out that. But I want
[1:36:54] to know something. Is the shout of the
[1:36:56] king in the king's camp? Somebody say
[1:36:59] amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be in you. And it
[1:37:02] doesn't come from somebody saying,
[1:37:03] "Amen." It comes from way down deep. And
[1:37:06] you're saying, "Amen." And you're
[1:37:07] thinking to yourself, "Why am I
[1:37:08] shouting?" Amen. I don't even know what
[1:37:10] he said. Yes. But it's been quickened to
[1:37:12] you by the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Are one of the 11th hour workers
[1:37:18] listening to me this night, whoever is
[1:37:21] watching online, whatever, however this
[1:37:22] goes out, Brother Jack, however big your
[1:37:24] audience is, I hope they grab this. The
[1:37:27] 11th hour work is awake.
[1:37:30] They know who they are or don't know.
[1:37:33] But God knows exactly who you are.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Watch this now.
[1:37:39] I can't believe this. We got inflation
[1:37:41] in our church. But see, they received
[1:37:42] everyone a penny. I don't know how far a
[1:37:44] penny goes, but that's what they got
[1:37:47] back then.
[1:37:48] Y'all wouldn't do nothing for a penny,
[1:37:50] would you?
[1:37:56] They supposed that they should have
[1:37:57] received more. We're talking about the
[1:37:59] guys who were there all the way through,
[1:38:00] right? The ones who walked with brother
[1:38:02] Brandham. The ones who believed with
[1:38:03] them. The ones who walked with Jesus.
[1:38:04] The ones who were there. The ones that
[1:38:06] Well, wait a minute. None of them were
[1:38:07] at the cross. Isn't that right?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Not the big shots.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But they wanted a bigger reward. But I
[1:38:14] like this.
[1:38:16] These last have wrought but one hour. He
[1:38:19] said this in verse 12. They're saying to
[1:38:22] him, "Thou has made them equal unto us."
[1:38:26] I've seen people with the revelation
[1:38:27] that God has given us, Brother Jack, and
[1:38:29] they sitting around going, "Now, why
[1:38:30] would God give that to him?"
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Now, they not saying it, but I can, you
[1:38:35] know what I'm talking about. How did God
[1:38:37] give that to him? I don't know. Maybe
[1:38:40] because I was honest and said, "I am
[1:38:42] ugly. I am dirty.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; I am filthy, Lord." But nonetheless, I
[1:38:48] need the Oh, how I need you.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Huh? Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I like that little song. That little
[1:38:55] song you threw in there. That little
[1:38:56] diddy right there. Yeah. Every hour I
[1:39:00] need you. See, it isn't about look how
[1:39:02] long I've walked and look how long I've
[1:39:04] been here. Look how pimp I am and now
[1:39:06] I've grown and I don't shout no more and
[1:39:08] I better clap like this and raise my
[1:39:09] hands like that. Wouldn't you know when
[1:39:10] you first came to Jesus, you were
[1:39:12] snotting. You were spitting. You were
[1:39:13] pulling a guy. You were screaming. Stomp
[1:39:15] on the floor. Lord, I need you.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; When does that ever change?
[1:39:22] Because if you leave me alone long
[1:39:24] enough and you all want to walk out and
[1:39:26] come back in about an hour, you'd see
[1:39:27] Brother Caleb, Pastor Caleb on the altar
[1:39:30] still saying, "God, I need you."
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, you ever get like that or
[1:39:35] you too proud to beg now? Huh?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; How many times Eric found him crying
[1:39:43] just him alone? He's praying. Don't even
[1:39:44] bother him cuz he's in there talking to
[1:39:46] God.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; A real believer will never forget where
[1:39:50] they came from.
[1:39:52] I'm glad he forgets,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; but it keeps it in the center of my mind
[1:39:56] somehow. From the left to the right,
[1:39:58] from the back to the front, there's an
[1:40:00] image of a man on a cross. And it
[1:40:03] reminds me that once I was, look,
[1:40:06] remember this. My sins put him there.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I was the one that crucified the Lord.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; I drove the nails through his hand. Yet
[1:40:18] at the same time, I was there when he
[1:40:20] rose again. Now you tell me how that
[1:40:21] works.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; You tell me how that works.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Because somebody said, "I am ugly. I am
[1:40:29] filthy. I am a sinner. I was born that
[1:40:32] way. But that's why I'm talking to you.
[1:40:34] Duh.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You said your blood was for me. So here
[1:40:41] I am. One drop. That's enough. Okay,
[1:40:44] fine. But if you don't mind, just
[1:40:46] baptize me in it.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Don't just wash my feet.
[1:40:52] Wash everything." Well, when he comes
[1:40:53] along with his blood, don't just put a
[1:40:54] little smart. No, no. Dump the blood on
[1:40:56] me, man.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; 11 hour worker, you're here. I'm here.
[1:41:06] We're here.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Always recognized that I was part of
[1:41:10] this group. I'm serious. I don't count
[1:41:14] myself a 10th hour or whatever first
[1:41:15] hour. Forget about it. I'm an 11th hour
[1:41:18] worker. I came in at 11:01. Y'all coming
[1:41:20] in at 11:59.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; It's the same hour.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, I don't know when you came
[1:41:28] in. Maybe you came in 11:00 on the dot.
[1:41:30] I don't care and I don't know. But the
[1:41:32] 11th hour is here.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You talk about a doomsday clock. Did you
[1:41:37] see the other day they moved it past
[1:41:38] midnight?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Past midnight.
[1:41:42] I need to move.
[1:41:45] Let me see. Uh
[1:41:48] uh they're complaining. And in verse 13,
[1:41:49] he said, "But he answered one of them
[1:41:51] and said,"Friend,
[1:41:53] I do thee no wrong." Oh, I love it. Did
[1:41:56] not thou agree with me for a penny?
[1:41:59] Isn't this all you asked for?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Didn't you merely ask to have a picture
[1:42:05] with him?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Didn't you only want a fishing trip?
[1:42:10] Didn't you want a church that was built
[1:42:12] around the testimony and memory of what
[1:42:13] you did with him? Isn't that what you
[1:42:15] wanted? I gave it to you.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Well, why is he getting because he asked
[1:42:19] for more?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; The 11th hour worker says, I'll do that
[1:42:25] and then some.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I'll take that and all you got for me.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want revelation. I want
[1:42:33] understanding to that revelation. I want
[1:42:34] to be able to explain it somehow
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; if I'm asked. Why do you wear dresses?
[1:42:39] Oh, because my church says so.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; That's not an answer. And I'm not going
[1:42:43] to get on that kind of stuff because to
[1:42:44] me, that's just juvenile. Now,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; you if you don't know by now, you got to
[1:42:48] dress right, something's wrong with your
[1:42:49] experience.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Because brother Jack and brother Caleb
[1:42:53] shouldn't be standing up here telling
[1:42:54] you girls how to dressing you men how to
[1:42:55] be respectful. That's something that
[1:42:57] comes with a filling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will send the tutor.
[1:43:08] So, well, Brother Kev, I can't get them
[1:43:09] to change. I don't care if you can't get
[1:43:10] them to change their clothes. Get them
[1:43:12] to the altar and get them to change
[1:43:14] their attitude with God.
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to embarrass my daughter
[1:43:19] too much more than I have to, but I will
[1:43:21] anyhow. Every time she gets
[1:43:22] disrespectful, and it's very rare, look
[1:43:24] at her little sweet disposition. You
[1:43:25] can't imagine it, right? Having a bad
[1:43:27] day. Nate, don't ever have one. Look at
[1:43:28] her.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; But there, every teenager's got their
[1:43:34] moments.
[1:43:36] Well, if you brothers don't say amen,
[1:43:38] you forgot what it was like to be 14.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; All right. You never got sassy with your
[1:43:43] dad.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; You never got one of these. Never mind.
[1:43:48] I had to learn to bob and weave. Man, I
[1:43:50] was
[1:43:52] right. But the first thing she does is
[1:43:55] gets upset with herself. And I've asked
[1:43:57] questions. I've heard her in the, you
[1:43:59] know, she goes in to take a shower and
[1:44:01] we can hear her sometimes getting upset
[1:44:04] and telling God, I don't want to be like
[1:44:06] this. You can just hear her, you know,
[1:44:08] kind of praying, leave her alone or
[1:44:10] she'll go in a room and she'll be crying
[1:44:12] and I have to kind of wait until she's
[1:44:14] kind of done knocking on door, what's
[1:44:15] the matter? I don't like talking to mom
[1:44:17] like that. I don't like having attitude.
[1:44:19] I don't like feeling like what am I
[1:44:21] supposed to do? What have I done wrong?
[1:44:22] You ain't done nothing wrong. Your your
[1:44:23] spirit is reacting to your flesh. that
[1:44:25] you just continue to pray and ask God to
[1:44:28] get rid of the flesh and just continue
[1:44:29] to be more like him.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; You don't got to be perfect.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; I don't want people at my church that's
[1:44:36] perfect. Matter of fact, I'm excited
[1:44:38] that we got all these dirty kids. If
[1:44:40] y'all are watching, I love you. I don't
[1:44:42] know where they're at. Don't leave. Oh,
[1:44:44] there you are.
[1:44:46] They understand. I've told them all the
[1:44:47] same thing. I'm proud of them, Brother
[1:44:49] Jack.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I'm proud of them. I wouldn't change if
[1:44:54] I wouldn't take any other group for them
[1:44:56] because they're innocent. And I the best
[1:44:58] group of people to talk to is a group of
[1:45:00] people that don't know anything about it
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; cuz then they don't argue with you.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; How do you know that? Cuz I said so.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You you can teach them. They're
[1:45:13] teachable.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You ever watch these people come from
[1:45:16] another church? Don't worry. They won't
[1:45:17] ever be there long. If they go if you
[1:45:19] got if they got a reputation of going
[1:45:20] place to place to place and they hate
[1:45:22] your place. Well, that's all right. I I
[1:45:24] shouldn't have never said it, but I had
[1:45:25] a couple come in like that and I said,
[1:45:26] "Oh, they won't give them two years.
[1:45:27] They'll be gone." Sure enough, they
[1:45:30] said, "How do you know that?" Say,
[1:45:31] "Because they always stay two years at
[1:45:32] everybody else's place."
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, what kind of reputation is that,
[1:45:35] brother?
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Right. They need to get to an altar, but
[1:45:38] they don't think they have to.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And yet, here's a pastor who says, "I
[1:45:42] need the altar every day of my life."
[1:45:44] Anybody
[1:45:47] else want to join me on that?
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, sis. Get your hand up there.
[1:45:50] Come on. Come on.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; There you go. A little higher. Little
[1:45:53] higher. You can do it.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. New York. I'm talking to you.
[1:45:57] New York. Come on.
[1:46:01] She got a shirt on and said New York.
[1:46:02] She looked down. Oh,
[1:46:06] come on now. Don't be ashamed, right?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; This is not the time for this. This is
[1:46:11] the time to get serious with God. We're
[1:46:14] so close to the end. I don't want
[1:46:16] anybody to miss it. Brother Brandham
[1:46:17] said this. He said, "I don't want my" He
[1:46:19] said, "I want my family to make it. I
[1:46:21] want my friends to make it. I even want
[1:46:24] my
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; to make it."
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Let's be real, man. There's people in
[1:46:29] this room that don't care if their
[1:46:30] enemies go or not.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul,
[1:46:35] he started laughing.
[1:46:37] You know what I'm saying? I've heard
[1:46:39] people talk like that. Well, watch. when
[1:46:40] they when I make it and they don't, I
[1:46:42] say, "Hold on, brother, sister. Hold on
[1:46:44] a minute. If you're talking like that,
[1:46:45] you don't have to worry about what they
[1:46:47] think because you be right there with
[1:46:48] them."
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And don't be surprised if they're
[1:46:52] walking in before you do.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Not that it matters. I don't care if I
[1:46:58] go in last or go in first. I just want
[1:46:59] to go in.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:04] [Applause]
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people reacted to
[1:47:08] this. Uh, I'm going to call him brother.
[1:47:09] Charlie Kurd bit past a lot of people.
[1:47:13] Some people calling him racist, some
[1:47:14] people saying this, saying that. I don't
[1:47:16] care what he was. The man's dead.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Let's show a little bit of respect.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; He may not have been a perfect person,
[1:47:22] but which one of us is?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, oops. I almost put my hand up. See,
[1:47:27] outside the blood of Christ, which one
[1:47:28] of us never never made no mistakes? Hey,
[1:47:31] outside the blood, how many of you've
[1:47:32] never been racist at some point or
[1:47:33] another?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, black people. Don't act like
[1:47:36] you don't get like that, too.
[1:47:38] Right.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Black people can be more racist than us
[1:47:42] or white people. It's true.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? You don't say. You
[1:47:47] don't say. You don't call them crack or
[1:47:48] nothing like that. But you say it's
[1:47:50] because I'm black. Well, that's racism.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; You're racist against your own self.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; I ain't even said you were black. You're
[1:47:57] the one pointing out you black all the
[1:47:59] time. But you're not even black. You're
[1:48:00] like a dark brown.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be funny. You know, it
[1:48:05] comes out that way. I'm just saying
[1:48:07] racism is all kind. Look, the bride of
[1:48:09] Christ is racist.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; We're snobs.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; We're better than everybody else.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; We got like a hierarchy.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's in the message, too.
[1:48:20] There there's some there's some
[1:48:20] prejudice in the message. I know there
[1:48:22] is.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; They don't belong in this message.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Strange how the colors the colored
[1:48:30] people only say that, right? But I've
[1:48:32] heard Brother Green say that, too.
[1:48:33] Racism don't belong in this message. But
[1:48:35] I've heard stories about him. I turn
[1:48:36] around and say, "You know what? I don't
[1:48:37] care what anybody says. People are dead.
[1:48:39] They We got to be respectful." And this
[1:48:41] man died. I'll tell you what, whether he
[1:48:43] was perfect or not, whether he was
[1:48:44] racist or not, whether he was this or
[1:48:46] not, the man died doing what a lot of us
[1:48:49] do not do in the first place.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I don't even like Jake Paul, that fake
[1:48:55] boxer guy. But you know what he said?
[1:48:56] One thing I appreciate, he said, "The
[1:48:58] man died for telling the truth."
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; And that's a that's a plain fact. You
[1:49:03] got to respect that.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; But then I have to ask I got to beg
[1:49:06] another question. There are missionaries
[1:49:09] and dignitaries within our ranks that
[1:49:11] die every day in Africa for what they
[1:49:14] believe in and what they stand for. But
[1:49:15] ain't nobody lighting candles or having
[1:49:17] visuals for them.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; If you want to be if you want to if you
[1:49:22] want to feel sorry for him or his
[1:49:23] family, I'll tell you what. Why don't
[1:49:25] you take your Bible and your message
[1:49:26] book and go do what he did?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Why you know what? But if I have known
[1:49:30] they were going to have that rally, I
[1:49:31] think they said like a thousand. How
[1:49:32] many say you showed up at U of A? But
[1:49:34] I'm of a thousand. Boom. Who's that?
[1:49:40] Well, if I'd have known that, I'd have
[1:49:41] showed up
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; and I have said, "Hey, can I uh can I
[1:49:44] grab the mic? I'm a pastor. Can I hold
[1:49:45] the mic for a second?" I'd have let them
[1:49:47] know who I was and I would say in the
[1:49:49] memory of let me tell you who Jesus is.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Where do we ever get the nerve to stand
[1:49:56] up and say what we believe?
[1:50:00] Oh, not the message. You don't even
[1:50:01] testify about Jesus, let alone the
[1:50:03] message.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; We need to become 11 without worker and
[1:50:08] do the job we were called to do.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And that is to get on fire for God.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; You know why some people get mad at
[1:50:17] them? Because they're ashamed. They
[1:50:18] ain't nothing like him.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I remember this. There ain't nobody in
[1:50:21] this room like Jesus.
[1:50:23] Nobody says amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; There ain't no one in this room like
[1:50:26] brother Brandham. No, you're not saying
[1:50:28] things. You know where I'm going with
[1:50:29] that. Brother Green used to say that all
[1:50:31] the time. There's nobody on earth that
[1:50:33] been like brother Random. And everybody
[1:50:34] say, "Amen." He goes, "Isn't that a
[1:50:36] shame?
[1:50:40] There ain't nobody like Jesus."
[1:50:41] Everybody shout, "Amen." And brother
[1:50:43] Green say, "Well, that's a shame, isn't
[1:50:44] it?"
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And we'd all kind of get like,
[1:50:48] "We should be like Jesus
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; by now. We should be like brother
[1:50:53] Brandham." Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; No, not like an uneducated an uneducated
[1:50:58] uh seventh grade uh you know education
[1:51:00] whatever Kentucky. I mean the spirit of
[1:51:03] the sold out of it the the all all
[1:51:06] bulletins posted all guns in everything
[1:51:09] you're going to do. I'm all in. I'm all
[1:51:11] in. I'm all in.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Sold out. Trying God and keeping him at
[1:51:17] his word. Lord, you said when that
[1:51:20] little dog was run over, that little two
[1:51:22] and a half dog was run over, he went
[1:51:24] around the corner to the house and he
[1:51:25] said, "Lord, you said in your word that
[1:51:28] if I delight myself in you, you'd give
[1:51:30] me the desire of my heart and I want
[1:51:33] that little dog to live." And he walked
[1:51:34] out, he goes, "Come on, boy." And that
[1:51:37] little dog jumped up, came back to life
[1:51:38] with nothing wrong with it.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you challenged
[1:51:42] God like that?
[1:51:47] I
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; told you last time I was out here when I
[1:51:49] stood out there in the on the shores of
[1:51:50] that ocean. I was moving the wave this
[1:51:52] way and moving the wave that way. It was
[1:51:53] funny and y'all didn't didn't doubt me.
[1:51:54] You believed me. I appreciated that. And
[1:51:58] I remember brother Jesse behind me and
[1:52:00] sister Dawson watching. Brother Jesse
[1:52:01] come up behind me in the water. He goes,
[1:52:02] "Can I try that?" Remember Jess about
[1:52:05] the water and all the waves and
[1:52:06] everything? And then Jesse stood there
[1:52:07] and all a sudden the glass went flying
[1:52:09] off. But he didn't give up. He kept
[1:52:10] trying anyway. He kept trying. I looked
[1:52:11] at him. I said, "Lord, help him just one
[1:52:12] time." It isn't that he didn't. What got
[1:52:14] me was that he tried.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; You know, we always talk about Peter
[1:52:20] sinking. At least he got off the boat.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; I got a question for you. How do you get
[1:52:28] back on it?
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; We What? Well, the Bible don't recognize
[1:52:33] that, does it?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; His buddies didn't put that in the
[1:52:36] script, did they?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; All they mentioned was that he fell.
[1:52:40] Wow.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; All they mentioned was that he was
[1:52:43] possibly racist.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; All they did was possibly mention that
[1:52:47] he had, you know, encounters of some
[1:52:49] kind that was immoral. All they want to
[1:52:51] do was drag his sins out. All they want
[1:52:53] to do is show that at one point he
[1:52:54] doubted and began to sink.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But nobody can tell me how he got back.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; He had to have walked back.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus took him up. Said, "Why did you
[1:53:05] doubt, man? Come on." Hand in hand. They
[1:53:07] went walking back to the boat. Get in.
[1:53:11] At least we got the nerve to try.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; How many times did God use you to speak
[1:53:18] the word, but you never told anybody
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; and you know it was true. How many
[1:53:22] dreams have you had that come to pass
[1:53:24] and you know the truth? Brother Jack,
[1:53:25] I'm veering way off the notes. You
[1:53:26] understand? I hope it's all right. Is
[1:53:27] this all right with everybody?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; How many times have you done these
[1:53:30] things and you know that God did them
[1:53:31] for you, but you're too embarrassed to
[1:53:33] tell anybody?
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:53:36] You don't want to witness about it
[1:53:38] because you don't want to look like a
[1:53:39] fanatic of some kind. You don't look
[1:53:41] like a a brandomite. Well, I'm not a
[1:53:43] branomite. I'm a Christian.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not on it at all.
[1:53:51] It's time for AI to die, brother Jack.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I thought that was I think if we you'd
[1:53:57] have dug just a little bit further. The
[1:53:59] Lord was telling you something when he
[1:54:01] said it's time for I to die and this AI
[1:54:02] thing came out. I said, "hm,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; I think I think brother Jack was on to
[1:54:07] something there."
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; That can make you say things that you
[1:54:10] never said, do things you never did.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; All this stuff come out. They going to
[1:54:15] make Brother Brandon say things ain't
[1:54:16] never saw never let him do
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; or he never said. Huh?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. They'll do the same thing to
[1:54:21] you if they can get your voice,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; right? Lie on you. Say something about
[1:54:25] you. When you Where's your faith then?
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to be challenged soon.
[1:54:30] I think what bothered a lot of people
[1:54:32] about that was that this man was a
[1:54:33] bonafide uh Christian. Regardless of
[1:54:35] whatever he felt or believed outside of
[1:54:37] it publicly, he was a Christian. That's
[1:54:39] what people saw.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's it it kind of
[1:54:44] pulled us all in kind of
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon said one day
[1:54:48] he'd be shot for praying for the sick
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; or speaking the gospel. Wow.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Then here you got somebody not only on
[1:54:55] television, but around the world, people
[1:54:57] saw this man shot and killed right in
[1:54:59] front of everybody
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; for talking about Jesus.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just pray that when that
[1:55:05] happens to us, we got enough power to
[1:55:06] get shot and keep on going.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Enough of the Holy Ghost to just keep on
[1:55:11] moving.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Because I believe there's a time when
[1:55:13] we're going to get so close to God and
[1:55:14] have the power to speak the word and the
[1:55:16] power of the Holy Spirit, that short,
[1:55:17] quick work. I don't think you're going
[1:55:18] to fall dead when you get shot. You're
[1:55:19] going to stand right up
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; and say, "Man, I wish you wouldn't have
[1:55:22] done that. He ain't kind of lost my
[1:55:23] place." Now, in the notes, it says here
[1:55:24] like, "God, this guy's still living."
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Look, they killed Jesus. They did. They
[1:55:30] killed him.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; But three days later, he was walking the
[1:55:33] same earth that they killed him off of.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; When is Jesus going to be Jesus in you?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz if that same spirit that rose Christ
[1:55:42] from the dead, if it dwells in you, it
[1:55:45] will quicken your mortal body.
[1:55:50] I sit there and wonder if that man had
[1:55:51] what we had. Would he have stood right
[1:55:52] back up?
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; What would the world do with that? Well,
[1:55:55] I'll tell you what. Jesus said, "Though
[1:55:57] one be raised from the dead, they'd
[1:55:59] still not believe."
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; We're in that hour. You'll watch. You'll
[1:56:03] see.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; 11th hour has got to get stronger. You
[1:56:06] got to you got to just get with it. You
[1:56:08] might not have time to study and pray,
[1:56:09] but you just need to believe it.
[1:56:10] Whatever brother Jack says over this
[1:56:12] place, just believe God.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Well, you mean I don't have to go back
[1:56:16] and study. You going to second guess
[1:56:17] your pastor? Does he have the Holy
[1:56:18] Ghost?
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Then you know I don't got to second
[1:56:22] guess. Nobody got the Holy Ghost. If
[1:56:24] it's real, I know it's real.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; My God is real.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; He said, uh, did I do I do the no wrong?
[1:56:33] Did not you didn't agree for this. Take
[1:56:35] that thine is and go thy way. In other
[1:56:37] words, take what you've asked for. All
[1:56:39] you wanted was an experience. All you
[1:56:41] wanted was a chill up your back. All you
[1:56:43] wanted was a testimony. All you wanted
[1:56:45] was a a little relic of some kind of you
[1:56:47] you got his his cufflings or you got the
[1:56:50] windshield or whatever it was. That's
[1:56:51] what you wanted. That's what you got.
[1:56:53] But this group over here and this group
[1:56:55] over here, they want to be adopted.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; They want to get the fullness of the
[1:57:00] Holy Ghost.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; They want to walk from this life to the
[1:57:04] next without seeing death. They want
[1:57:06] something different. They want more
[1:57:08] because we realize that God can give us
[1:57:11] more.
[1:57:13] Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; You wanted to be saved, but this group
[1:57:16] over here wants their entire family
[1:57:18] saved.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You wanted the Holy Ghost. But see, this
[1:57:21] group over here, they'd rather give up
[1:57:23] the ghost and let the family not get the
[1:57:25] Holy Ghost. Come on.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; You wanted to see You wanted to see
[1:57:29] heaven and get there. But this group
[1:57:30] over here would rather take their their
[1:57:32] family members place into hell than let
[1:57:34] them see them than see them miss heaven.
[1:57:36] If anybody ever been that way.
[1:57:40] Oh, there's people I would rather take
[1:57:41] hell for them, Brother Jack. And I mean
[1:57:42] that I love them enough to say, "Lord,
[1:57:44] they wouldn't be able to hack it. I may
[1:57:46] not be able to take them in my place. If
[1:57:48] you ever paid that way, something
[1:57:50] different is alive in you."
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I went through some uh trials here
[1:57:59] recently. Had to eat some humble pie.
[1:58:02] Missed out on a good trip. All my
[1:58:04] friends went was excited. I was going to
[1:58:06] go. Some other things took place, but I
[1:58:08] got this problem and that problem. And
[1:58:10] then, believe it or not, I missed the
[1:58:12] plane. That don't ever happen.
[1:58:15] And uh then the the the brothers who
[1:58:17] were supposed to uh cover me, one got
[1:58:20] sick and the other one got called into
[1:58:21] work. And I thought, well, if I wouldn't
[1:58:23] have been here, what's going on here?
[1:58:27] But see, there was some there's
[1:58:28] something ticking that's different
[1:58:29] inside of me. Instead of being upset
[1:58:31] that I missed a trip, instead of getting
[1:58:34] angry with God for, you know, for what
[1:58:36] looked like a generous correction,
[1:58:39] you know what I did? I said, "Thank you,
[1:58:42] Lord.
[1:58:43] I appreciate what you've taught me."
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I got shingles for a while. I don't have
[1:58:49] them anymore, so I'm not contagious.
[1:58:50] Everybody relax.
[1:58:52] And every time I move, they hurt. My
[1:58:55] back gets sore still. They said they'll
[1:58:56] hang out for six months. No, I won't.
[1:58:57] I'm gonna pray this off. But the Holy
[1:59:00] Spirit told me, "I'm going to leave it
[1:59:01] there as a lesson to you. You brought
[1:59:04] this stress on yourself." And I I'll go
[1:59:06] into that some other time. But every
[1:59:08] time I felt it, ow. I remember and I
[1:59:10] think, "Thank you, Lord, for that lesson
[1:59:11] you taught me." And when I walked into
[1:59:13] church that Sunday morning that I was
[1:59:15] supposed to have everybody filling in
[1:59:16] for me, my younger brother shows up. He
[1:59:19] ain't been in church in years. And when
[1:59:21] I looked over at him, the Lord told me,
[1:59:22] "Because of the way you responded, I'm
[1:59:24] giving you your brother.
[1:59:30] [Applause]
[1:59:34] It ain't going to stop there either.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to stop there either. If
[1:59:45] God will do that for the pastor, if
[1:59:47] you'll just submit yourself and let God
[1:59:49] correct you and teach you and and guide
[1:59:51] you and you answer your you answer your
[1:59:54] Lord the right way, he's going to let
[1:59:56] you have what you have need of. He'll
[1:59:58] give you your family. He'll give you
[2:00:00] your loved ones. He'll give every I
[2:00:02] don't care how bad it is, how many kids
[2:00:04] they got, how baby mama drama, daddy
[2:00:06] drama, drug, I don't care what they're
[2:00:07] on. If you'll just obey God, he'll give
[2:00:10] every last one of them to you.
[2:00:15] That's thus sayeth the Lord. Even now,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; if you can believe it, say amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; I don't say things to brag. This is what
[2:00:22] God did for me. I say things to show you
[2:00:24] that if you do it for me, he'll do it
[2:00:26] for you.
[2:00:28] And why not? Huh? And why not?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Why are you giving this revelation to
[2:00:34] him? Well, why not? You didn't ask for
[2:00:35] it.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:00:38] The Bible tells us to ask for
[2:00:40] understanding.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Not knowledge necessarily, but
[2:00:44] understanding.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Give us more revelation. Lord, show us
[2:00:48] what we're missing.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Because, Brother Jack, if history is a
[2:00:52] teacher, we should have been gone a
[2:00:54] while back.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; But something's lacking somewhere.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, what is it? Well, it's you're
[2:01:00] waiting on the prophet to do something
[2:01:02] or this one to do something, even your
[2:01:04] pastor to do something. But the Bible
[2:01:05] said the bride or the wife has made
[2:01:09] herself ready.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; God cannot dress you. He can only supply
[2:01:14] you. And you have got to get ready
[2:01:17] yourself.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; And you don't get ready by not
[2:01:20] understanding or getting more
[2:01:21] revelation.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry.
[2:01:26] Don't you worry. They're not that far
[2:01:27] gone. Don't you worry. I don't care how
[2:01:29] it looks. Don't you worry.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Put them in the hands of God. Put them
[2:01:32] in the hands of God. Leave him there.
[2:01:33] Don't you ask no more. Just remind God,
[2:01:36] you gave me my son. You gave me my
[2:01:38] daughter. You gave me my grandchildren.
[2:01:40] Don't you ask no more. Don't you ask no
[2:01:43] more. You tell God, you gave them to me.
[2:01:46] Now let my eyes see it come to pass.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I think that was for you.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; And anybody else who wants it. Who wants
[2:01:59] it? Say amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's all right. Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take thine and go thy way.
[2:02:06] It's not lawful for me to do evil. And
[2:02:08] he goes on like that. Now, let me just
[2:02:09] give you another little bit of uh I'm
[2:02:11] just going to paraphrase this one. But
[2:02:13] you know the the parable about the king
[2:02:15] who created a mighty feast. And he said,
[2:02:16] "Go onto the highways and the byways and
[2:02:19] all this." And he said, "No, no, he
[2:02:20] first he said go invite invite the
[2:02:22] dignitaries and invite the politicians
[2:02:24] and invite the kings of the earth and
[2:02:25] all the governors and and all the
[2:02:27] presidents and first ladies and whatever
[2:02:29] what have you." and and he prepared a
[2:02:31] mighty celebration and you know if feel
[2:02:34] sorry for him kind of be like President
[2:02:36] Trump asking everybody to show up you
[2:02:37] know how they are with him.
[2:02:40] He threw himself a parade and nobody
[2:02:41] showed up.
[2:02:44] I kind of felt best and man if I was
[2:02:46] there I'd have been like Trump
[2:02:49] but you know the disrespect. He's still
[2:02:52] the president.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible tell us to obey those and
[2:02:56] honor those who have the rule over us.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. But we don't know. Well, I
[2:03:00] don't know about us, but people don't
[2:03:01] respect anything in this country.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; They watch their parents that are that
[2:03:06] are uh what do you call them? Anchors
[2:03:08] and co-hosts and all these people who
[2:03:09] think they got knowledge about they
[2:03:11] don't know nothing about anything. But
[2:03:12] they watch their parents bad talk the
[2:03:15] president, bad talk senator so and so or
[2:03:18] or congressman so and so or police chief
[2:03:20] so and so or judge so and so and then
[2:03:23] they go home and wonder why Junior
[2:03:25] doesn't respect them.
[2:03:28] Huh?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; But it'd be like him, you know, creating
[2:03:32] a new place and I'm going to have a
[2:03:35] party and invite everybody. Nobody shows
[2:03:36] up. So then it'd be like, "Okay, well,
[2:03:38] if they don't want to show up, we're
[2:03:40] going to do something different. We're
[2:03:41] going to do a new thing. It's going to
[2:03:42] be better than anybody's ever done. Go
[2:03:44] get Caleb in Tucson, tell him his church
[2:03:48] to show up, and go invite all these
[2:03:49] messes people that nobody Can you
[2:03:51] imagine that?
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; And all of us show up because, you know,
[2:03:54] free food.
[2:03:58] And we all showed up. Brother Jack,
[2:03:59] wouldn't that be something? What are you
[2:04:01] guys doing there? The president invited
[2:04:02] us.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what he is? Well, I know
[2:04:05] what you say he is, and yeah, I know
[2:04:06] some things about him, but he invited us
[2:04:08] to come.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; The king said nobody would show up. So,
[2:04:12] he told he got angry. He said, "I did
[2:04:14] all this work. I tell you what, go get
[2:04:16] the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the halt,
[2:04:18] the lame, the poor, the broken, the
[2:04:21] depressed, the oppressed, the drug
[2:04:23] addicts. Go get all those losers that
[2:04:25] nobody wants and invite them to come.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; If they don't want my blood, go get
[2:04:32] somebody else.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And we find the gentile bride screaming,
[2:04:37] "Grace, grace to the headstone."
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; We find us walking into a place that
[2:04:43] once where we were not invited or even
[2:04:46] welcomed. We couldn't even look at the
[2:04:47] tabernacle. We couldn't be in it
[2:04:49] anywhere near it. But now we've gone
[2:04:52] beyond the outer hole, the outer circle,
[2:04:55] the inner circle into the most holy of
[2:04:57] holies. We've gone in where the ark used
[2:04:59] to be because we have become the ark of
[2:05:02] the covenant.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Who you? Yeah. A rejected people,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; a gentile people, a peculiar people. And
[2:05:12] in the if you look up in the Greek, it
[2:05:14] doesn't mean strange or odd. It means
[2:05:17] precious,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; rare, like a gemstone that's kept in a
[2:05:22] vault to be safe.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; He let us in because nobody else would
[2:05:29] wanted to.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; The Hebrews wanted rules. Oh, you can't
[2:05:33] go past the inner court. You can't go
[2:05:35] past the outer court. Oh, no, no, no,
[2:05:36] no. You can't go into the holy place.
[2:05:38] Even the Jews kept some of the Jews out
[2:05:41] and only the high priest. He's the only
[2:05:43] one and a prophet. They can go in there,
[2:05:44] but you can't. And God said, "This is
[2:05:46] ridiculous because I want everybody in
[2:05:49] my presence."
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; And we are now allowed to go where no
[2:05:53] one else has gone before.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; He invited the lame, the deaf, the dumb,
[2:06:00] the rejected, the despised few. Come.
[2:06:02] I'll show them I'll show them a
[2:06:04] revelation they ain't never seen before.
[2:06:06] Tell them to come. Tell them to be a
[2:06:08] part of this celebration. Tell them to
[2:06:10] be part of this final work. Huh?
[2:06:14] Tell them to be part of this final move.
[2:06:17] Tell them to be a part of what I'm doing
[2:06:19] now.
[2:06:20] Tell them to turn a corner.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon used to say,
[2:06:28] "Anybody can build a brick wall." Which
[2:06:30] is not true cuz I can't.
[2:06:34] But you know what he means? He said,
[2:06:35] "Anybody can lay a brick wall." He said,
[2:06:36] "But it takes a real mason to turn a
[2:06:37] corner.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to have all kind
[2:06:40] of problems." He got to know exactly
[2:06:41] what he's doing.
[2:06:43] You got to have a real believer that
[2:06:45] knows how to turn the corner when God
[2:06:46] turns the corner.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; You got to have a real understanding of
[2:06:50] God's word to know when it's time to
[2:06:52] move with the pillar of fire
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; because you can't get ahead of it. You
[2:06:55] can't get ahead of the cloud. You can't
[2:06:56] get ahead of the pillar of fire. I've
[2:06:57] had people tell me that and say, "Well,
[2:06:59] you need to slow down." And I could see
[2:07:00] where God slowed me down. I could see
[2:07:01] where God didn't let me go here. Didn't
[2:07:03] let me go there. All of a sudden,
[2:07:04] Brother Jack, the doors have swung open
[2:07:05] again. What is it? It's time to move on
[2:07:07] with the pillar of fire. Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; And if I can just if you'll just let me
[2:07:12] stay humble.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Little bride, stay humble.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; One of the seven seal nuggets that I'll
[2:07:19] speak on Sunday morning, Lord willing,
[2:07:21] one of the seven sealed nuggets I found
[2:07:23] either in the fifth seal and even in the
[2:07:24] sixth seal, there's a warning to stay
[2:07:26] little in your own sight.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; there's a warning for you to stay
[2:07:33] humble. They talked about that little
[2:07:35] that little girl that that worked at the
[2:07:37] rancher's house and and how the rancher
[2:07:39] son said, "If you'll wait just one year,
[2:07:40] you get yourself ready and I'll come
[2:07:42] back." And they made fun of her. And
[2:07:43] they teased her and she was lowly
[2:07:44] looking and and uh calmly looking. I
[2:07:47] guess that means ugly. I think it means
[2:07:49] just, you know, not all dolled up and
[2:07:51] fake and makeup and fraudulent.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; That's what I think it means. I think it
[2:07:58] means you have enough confidence in
[2:07:59] yourself. You don't have to use anything
[2:08:00] else to make up the difference.
[2:08:05] What's with the war paint anyway? Huh?
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; All right, never mind.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I did that and I shouldn't have.
[2:08:14] That's politically incorrect.
[2:08:17] But I'm I'm I have a patch of blood, so
[2:08:18] I guess I'm all right. I told you, man.
[2:08:21] We're all mixed up.
[2:08:25] Look here what he said here. Uh, Brother
[2:08:26] R said he said, "Hold the four winds."
[2:08:28] Wait, wait, where was I going with that
[2:08:30] first? Let me finish that up. Oh, yeah.
[2:08:31] The rancher. Okay. And they said, "Why
[2:08:33] is he going to come back for you? Why
[2:08:34] would he love you? Why would he want
[2:08:36] you?" I don't know, but all I know is he
[2:08:37] said, "You ain't even heard from him.
[2:08:38] You don't You guys don't communicate.
[2:08:40] You don't text. You don't WhatsApp. You
[2:08:41] don't Skype. You don't FaceTime.
[2:08:43] Nothing.
[2:08:45] He has no social media. You ain't got
[2:08:47] none. How do you guys even talk? Do you
[2:08:48] guys call?" Nope. Never heard from him.
[2:08:50] Does he even send you a My dad the other
[2:08:51] day told me to look on Telegram and I
[2:08:53] thought he was just getting old. I
[2:08:55] didn't realize there's an app now called
[2:08:57] Telegram.
[2:08:58] Then I felt old. said, "How does my dad
[2:09:01] know what I don't know?" I don't My
[2:09:04] dad's telling me, "Get Telegram. Get
[2:09:05] Telegram." I said, "Dad, they don't have
[2:09:07] those anymore."
[2:09:09] Yes, they do. It's on my phone. I went,
[2:09:15] but in the seals, they are making fun of
[2:09:18] her and she hasn't answered. She goes,
[2:09:21] "It don't matter. It's almost the year's
[2:09:22] almost up." And she says these words, "I
[2:09:25] have five minutes yet."
[2:09:29] And brother Brand said at that same time
[2:09:31] she heard the wagon wheels. She looked
[2:09:33] down the road, saw the dust kicking up.
[2:09:34] Here he came like he had promised.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I thought it was interesting because we
[2:09:39] uh we prayed for our food in Atlanta and
[2:09:42] I made a statement, brother Jack. I
[2:09:44] said, "Lord, would you help us get there
[2:09:45] just a little bit earlier?" I should
[2:09:46] have asked for an hour earlier because I
[2:09:48] know he had done it, but I said a little
[2:09:49] bit earlier. And our flight was to leave
[2:09:52] at 209. We get back to the desk and it
[2:09:54] said schedule 209 but actual I've never
[2:09:57] even seen this but actual departure is
[2:09:59] at 204. I go why don't you just change
[2:10:01] it to 204 but that's 5 minutes left.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; We landed five minutes early.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, man, if you
[2:10:10] would just let your servant see every
[2:10:12] little thing that you're using to build
[2:10:14] his faith.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Remember that time we traveled together,
[2:10:17] Allie? And I I I said, Ally, I said, I'm
[2:10:19] going to start saying some things. I'm
[2:10:20] going to get into gear because I
[2:10:21] actually matter of fact we're on our way
[2:10:22] here and I said, "I got to get into uh
[2:10:25] gear. I hope you understand." He goes,
[2:10:26] "Well, yeah, we I think so." And I said,
[2:10:27] "Well, I'm going to tell you some things
[2:10:29] and I want you just to not question me.
[2:10:31] Just watch what happens." And so I
[2:10:32] looked over at a fell and I started
[2:10:33] talking to him and I looked at his boots
[2:10:34] and I go, "This guy's from Texas." And
[2:10:36] he goes, "Well, that's easy." He goes,
[2:10:37] "Yeah, but we're connecting." Because
[2:10:38] he's from Dallas. And he goes, "How do
[2:10:40] you know that?" I go, "Told not to ask
[2:10:42] me anything." I said, "Where are you
[2:10:43] connecting to?" He goes, "Dallas said,
[2:10:44] "Aren't you our pilot?" He goes, "How
[2:10:45] did you know that?" I said, "I told you
[2:10:46] not to ask me nothing. Just watch." So
[2:10:48] he does. And that sure enough, he's our
[2:10:50] pilot and he's he's stopping in Dallas
[2:10:51] and Boots and had nothing to do with
[2:10:53] this guy showing you something. We get
[2:10:55] on the plane and I said, "Somebody's
[2:10:56] sick." Remember that? And they hardly
[2:11:00] ever do this over the intercom. What
[2:11:01] happened? Uh, is there a doctor on the
[2:11:03] plane? We have somebody who's not
[2:11:04] feeling well. He may be having cardiac
[2:11:05] arrest. And Ellis goes, I go, "Just just
[2:11:08] don't say nothing. It's not me now. Just
[2:11:09] let me get this way." And he, uh, you're
[2:11:12] going to be in concord. I said, "No,
[2:11:14] they're going to switch it to this.
[2:11:15] We're going to have to go here, here,
[2:11:16] and here." We get there. Then the best
[2:11:18] one for last. We get in the little
[2:11:20] train. You're on the train. And I look
[2:11:21] to this lady and I go, "Are you you're a
[2:11:23] twin?"
[2:11:24] She goes, "What makes you say that?" And
[2:11:26] I go, "You're just like you were." She
[2:11:27] goes, "Well, um,
[2:11:30] no, but I'm about to have twins." And my
[2:11:34] sister's a twin, and this one's a twin.
[2:11:36] And this black lady goes, "That's the
[2:11:38] Holy Ghost."
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:43] [Applause]
[2:11:45] That lady goes, "How did you do that?"
[2:11:46] And she goes, "I told you that's the
[2:11:48] Holy Spirit." I'm not kidding. All
[2:11:49] right, Ellie. She was doing like this
[2:11:50] and me and Ally were just looking at.
[2:11:51] She goes, "Woo!" She's going like that
[2:11:53] back and forth.
[2:11:56] She knew enough. She knew enough to
[2:12:00] recognize what that was.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Then we came here and we had one of our
[2:12:03] meetings and we came with those four
[2:12:04] brothers. That time we come with you.
[2:12:05] And I said, "Man," he goes, "Why did you
[2:12:07] tell me that, brother Caleb?" I said, "I
[2:12:08] want you to if you're going to be close
[2:12:09] to me, I need you to see this stuff and
[2:12:11] don't ask me anything." I said, "I'm
[2:12:12] doing it to build my faith or let the
[2:12:14] Lord build it and yours, too." I said,
[2:12:16] "But it's mostly so I can just get
[2:12:17] stronger, you know, because it's time."
[2:12:18] And I said, "So, we're here in this hour
[2:12:20] and this is what's happening. Little
[2:12:22] things here and there and if Oh, well,
[2:12:24] what was that all about?" No, don't ask
[2:12:25] the Lord, "What was that about?" Say,
[2:12:26] "Thank you, Lord. I appreciate that
[2:12:28] little road mark.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that tie post. I appreciate
[2:12:32] you showing me and telling me not to
[2:12:34] leave now that this was going to happen.
[2:12:35] I appreciate you getting me ready.
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you getting me ready for
[2:12:43] what was about to happen. Cuz God's not
[2:12:46] just going to send you out there
[2:12:47] unprepared.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; He's going to have you ready for every
[2:12:50] situation.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time when you're
[2:12:53] going to lay your hands on somebody. I I
[2:12:55] I remember going through a place and
[2:12:56] telling somebody, "You don't feel good."
[2:12:57] Huh? I can tell they go, "How can you I
[2:12:58] just don't worry. You want me to lay my
[2:12:59] hand on you?" I remember doing it and
[2:13:01] they getting healed and then they want
[2:13:02] to try to find you. I said, "Come on,
[2:13:03] Ellie. Let's get out of here. I don't
[2:13:04] want to make a big deal out of it."
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; But the body of Christ is going to have
[2:13:08] to learn how to just take it just a
[2:13:10] little a little bit of attention, but
[2:13:12] stay humble about it. Amen.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; There's no big I's or little U's.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; We're all on the same team.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not greater than Brother Jack. And
[2:13:23] Brother Jack, you might be greater than
[2:13:24] me. I don't know. But I'm not greater
[2:13:26] than you. You're a better singer. I'll
[2:13:28] give you that.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:13:32] Are you with me?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Let me wrap it up with this one here.
[2:13:38] He said,
[2:13:40] "Hold the four winds until,"
[2:13:43] in other words, he said, "we seal the
[2:13:46] servants of God in their forehead." Look
[2:13:49] how God has been. You see, it says that
[2:13:51] that um we have to make ourselves ready,
[2:13:54] right?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; They tell us to watch and wait, look and
[2:13:57] pray so forth. But God is also
[2:14:00] long-suffering.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; He don't want nobody to miss it. Right?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; It isn't that anybody is.
[2:14:09] We just we're a little bit slow
[2:14:10] sometimes at picking things up.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; You ever see something happen and you're
[2:14:16] like, "Why didn't I see that?"
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; You should have.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; We seal the servants of God. The
[2:14:24] servants, the Jews, John turned and
[2:14:26] said, "I seen 144,000 sealed away." He
[2:14:29] goes on like that. He said, "Some come
[2:14:31] in one hour at 1 hour, another hour, and
[2:14:34] some another hour." And as they was 11th
[2:14:36] hour people, the 11th hour people now
[2:14:39] who you who are spiritual, read between
[2:14:43] the lines
[2:14:45] because I've got to jump here in a
[2:14:47] hurry. Come in the 11th hour people. And
[2:14:50] right now, the first come in and receive
[2:14:53] the penny. And the next come in and
[2:14:55] receive the penny. And the 11th hour
[2:14:57] people got the same pity that they did
[2:14:59] at the first. Is that right? The 11th
[2:15:02] hour. Now watch. He just starts talking
[2:15:04] on and on and on. That's a mile post. He
[2:15:07] talks about the first world war one and
[2:15:09] all this. And he goes down. He said he's
[2:15:11] going to receive the same baptism.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost that they got back at
[2:15:19] the beginning back there in Pentecost.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Now I want to show you something here.
[2:15:25] He says back there at Pentecost, I
[2:15:26] believe he's referring back to Isuza
[2:15:28] Street, right? But if we're spiritual,
[2:15:30] it doesn't go just that far back. It
[2:15:33] goes all the way back to the upper room
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; because that's where Pentecost started.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Pentecost be became an organization and
[2:15:42] and what you got now, the evidence of
[2:15:44] speaking the uh speaking in tongues and
[2:15:45] so forth. That's not the evidence. It is
[2:15:48] unevidence. But you look, I had somebody
[2:15:51] get up one time and they said, "Uh,
[2:15:52] speaking in tongues is fine, but that's
[2:15:54] not it."
[2:15:56] Okay, you're right. But the shame of it
[2:15:59] is this.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have all nine
[2:16:03] spiritual gifts
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; working in the church.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; And if we don't got the least,
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; so can we at least get the least
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; before you kick it out?
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Can we get a little bit of that? And the
[2:16:18] rest and the other eight gifts too
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; before you kick out this one.
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; I remember him saying, "Well, I spoke in
[2:16:26] tongues, but I Anybody can do that
[2:16:28] really.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; If you haven't spoken tongues, don't
[2:16:34] worry about it. It's not required.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's the right way to say it.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; It's in evidence, but it's not
[2:16:39] required."
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; You know what is required? A life
[2:16:42] change.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Servitude.
[2:16:47] selling out, repenting, being baptized
[2:16:50] in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; These are requirements.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Foot washing and communion.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; These are requirements,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; right? These are things you've got to
[2:16:58] do.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Well, but you're you're not supposed to
[2:17:03] prove God by works. No. By your works,
[2:17:04] you won't, but also by the works of your
[2:17:06] faith, you will prove God.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; That's not your works. That's faith
[2:17:10] works.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Faith works is a whole different thing.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm just dropping some seeds.
[2:17:15] Everybody say an amen. Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; He said he's going to receive the same
[2:17:18] bapt Holy Ghost. He go back there at
[2:17:20] Pentecost. It's not going just to
[2:17:21] Pentecost and Suz Street. We're talking
[2:17:23] in the upper room experience be baptized
[2:17:25] the same way and everything. The 11th
[2:17:27] hour of people moving in and what I'm
[2:17:29] seeing at my little temp at our little
[2:17:32] temple. I'm talk I'm trying to change
[2:17:33] the way I talk. It's not my church. It's
[2:17:35] our church.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not the only minister pastor there.
[2:17:39] We got pastors. And I got to remember
[2:17:41] that we had a time where people were
[2:17:44] fussing and fighting over certain things
[2:17:46] and certain pieces of equipment. I
[2:17:47] thought to myself, man, I don't even own
[2:17:49] the pulpit. I don't even I don't even
[2:17:51] you know what do you call it? Uh the I'm
[2:17:52] not greedy with it. Why should you all
[2:17:53] be greedy with everything else?
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; So I got to live by example. Is that
[2:17:57] right?
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; All right. I think I'm going to just
[2:18:00] finish up with that. Be all right. We
[2:18:02] are the 11th hour people. That's who we
[2:18:04] are. If you believe that, you can say
[2:18:06] amen.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Here, hold it till we
[2:18:08] seal the servants, not the bride. The
[2:18:10] Gentile never was a servant. We are sons
[2:18:12] and daughters."
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that should have made you happy.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not a servant. I am a son and or a
[2:18:19] daughter.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham was God's servant. Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] Now, thousands times thousands,
[2:18:25] thousands of Jews, God's got them all in
[2:18:27] there. He started talking about Muslim
[2:18:28] Stalin. He goes all the way back there.
[2:18:30] But see, I'm looking at something
[2:18:31] different here. And I want you to
[2:18:32] understand what I'm saying. I'm not
[2:18:33] trying to knock what he's saying. And
[2:18:34] I'm trying to read what he's saying and
[2:18:36] show you what it is. He said here, "Hold
[2:18:39] the four winds. Don't let the world be
[2:18:41] destroyed until we seal the servants of
[2:18:44] our God in their forehead." That's been
[2:18:46] nigh to 50 years ago when the Holy Ghost
[2:18:49] has come from the east fell upon the
[2:18:51] people and the Pentecostal as the
[2:18:53] streets and so forth started. Now what
[2:18:55] is going to happen? They have to hold
[2:18:57] it. Don't destroy the whole earth. Do
[2:19:00] you see why we're still here? because
[2:19:03] we're waiting on them. We're waiting on
[2:19:05] you.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; there's a threat now, right? There's a
[2:19:10] threat. Russia wasn't a threat for the
[2:19:12] longest time, was it?
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; No. And all of a sudden, we're real
[2:19:16] nervous because they're moving
[2:19:17] satellites and oddly right above the
[2:19:20] United States.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; What are they doing that for?
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Well, because a prophet of God said one
[2:19:25] day they'll go up there with a nuclear
[2:19:26] bomb. They'll bring the American country
[2:19:28] to her knees, the United States to her
[2:19:30] knees. that'll make her surrender.
[2:19:32] Either you do what we tell you or
[2:19:34] and then brother Brandon goes on to say
[2:19:36] this, but don't you worry. Before the
[2:19:38] first bomb ever hits the ground, you and
[2:19:39] I will be shaking hands with our
[2:19:40] brothers and sisters in glory.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; We're here now.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Russia's moving in. That war ain't going
[2:19:47] to stop. Israel started fighting. That
[2:19:49] ain't going to stop. We got a pope out
[2:19:50] of America. Oh, I love this argument.
[2:19:53] Oh, I I I agree. It could be a type, but
[2:19:56] I don't think it said Well, yeah, you're
[2:19:58] you're right, brother, because popes
[2:19:59] come out of America all the time.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; This person is not just out of America.
[2:20:06] He was born a United States citizen.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; The same year that Brother Brandham said
[2:20:12] that
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; on the same border of where brother
[2:20:17] Brandham lived.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; So, while Brother Brandham's saying
[2:20:20] this, this little guy's going goooo
[2:20:22] gaga.
[2:20:26] Come on.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just a coincidence. I don't
[2:20:29] think it's that.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Well, you go ahead then.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; You go ahead. That's the problem with
[2:20:35] prophecy, though, is people want to
[2:20:36] judge a prophet. Just let it come to
[2:20:38] pass.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. No one can judge a
[2:20:42] prophet's word. A prophecy you bring
[2:20:44] before two or three. But a prophet, you
[2:20:45] just leave that thing alone.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Well, you said, you said, "No, no, no. I
[2:20:50] said, thus say the Lord, leave that
[2:20:51] thing alone." I mean, how many times
[2:20:52] have we said something in the name of
[2:20:53] the Lord and it didn't happen when when
[2:20:55] people thought it should happen. But if
[2:20:57] they just wait a little bit longer, it
[2:20:58] takes place just like he said.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Same thing with brother Brandham.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what is going to happen? They have
[2:21:06] to hold it. Don't destroy the whole
[2:21:08] earth because it couldn't have done it
[2:21:09] then. Anyhow, anyhow, but now they got
[2:21:12] he said regular bomb. He made nuclear
[2:21:14] bomb that'll destroy the whole earth.
[2:21:15] That's right. Hold it until what? until
[2:21:18] we
[2:21:19] have sealed in in their foreheads the
[2:21:22] servants of God.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; We're here now. Just think the great
[2:21:26] Holy Spirit come identifying Jesus
[2:21:28] Christ alive after 2,000 years. See the
[2:21:32] very nature of him doing the same thing
[2:21:35] as he promised it would be done. That's
[2:21:37] right. I'm so grateful for you,
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; friends. You're that 11th hour people
[2:21:46] standing here.
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I'm so
[2:21:52] grateful for you.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; You are the 11th hour working people
[2:21:58] standing here."
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Well, he buried my sin in the depth of
[2:22:07] the sea.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; He carried my guilt far away.
[2:22:12] And as far as the east is from the west,
[2:22:16] he removed my transgressions from me.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Now I sing of his mercy and tell of his
[2:22:24] love and I sing of his liberty
[2:22:28] and I live in the awesome light of his
[2:22:31] love
[2:22:33] because I know that I am free.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Free to do what? to tell the people I am
[2:22:42] an 11th hour worker. The coming of the
[2:22:45] Lord is not coming, it's here. The bride
[2:22:50] knows who she is. She is the foolish
[2:22:53] virgin has awakened and so has the wise.
[2:22:57] The wise has already trimmed her and
[2:22:59] accepted God's word. Watch it and see if
[2:23:02] it ain't so.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; We won't be here much longer.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Well, then I guess we don't need to
[2:23:07] fight it, church. No, you just keep on
[2:23:09] doing what you're doing. Amen.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Don't you stop for nothing.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and make an addition. You
[2:23:16] go ahead and buy a church.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and get people to come. You
[2:23:19] just keep coming and coming and coming.
[2:23:20] But remember, don't get used to it. I
[2:23:22] don't care how pretty it is, how good it
[2:23:24] looks. This world is not my home. I'm
[2:23:27] just a passing through.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up somewhere
[2:23:31] beyond the blue. The angels beckoning me
[2:23:34] from heaven's open door. You know, I'll
[2:23:35] tell you something else. The believers
[2:23:37] that have gone on are beckoning me. Come
[2:23:40] on, Caleb. Get us out of this grave.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; And I can't feel that old in this world
[2:23:48] anymore. Come on, musicians. Oh Lord,
[2:23:51] you know I have no friend like you. And
[2:23:54] if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what
[2:23:57] will I do?
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, if heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[2:24:04] what will I do?
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Wow.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; All I know is I can't feel at all in
[2:24:13] this world anymore.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm grateful for you, friends.
[2:24:18] You're that 11th hour work. You're that
[2:24:20] 11th hour people standing here just
[2:24:22] getting in. I'm so glad you come. Each
[2:24:24] one of you remember it was God who told
[2:24:26] you to come."
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Humanly, you wouldn't have done it.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; But God told you to come.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:24:37] Now while these brethren these brethren
[2:24:39] here and I'm praying he goes on he asked
[2:24:41] the people to pray. Isn't that powerful?
[2:24:44] Humanly you would not have come. I told
[2:24:48] the church that last Sunday and I didn't
[2:24:49] even realize he'd said that. You know I
[2:24:52] think we do subconsciously. We know it
[2:24:53] you know by by spirit. And you say I
[2:24:55] didn't even know he said that. I think
[2:24:56] we did know but I didn't know. You know
[2:24:58] what I mean?
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; But that's what happened last Sunday. I
[2:25:01] go you you say well I'm here because so
[2:25:03] and so invited me. No that's not why
[2:25:04] you're here. You're here because God
[2:25:07] used somebody to ask you to come.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; God gave you the uncction to jump a
[2:25:11] fence.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; It was really sweet. I think actually,
[2:25:15] matter of fact, Brother Jesse's one of
[2:25:16] your last official acts as a youth
[2:25:18] pastor. What a way to go out too, huh?
[2:25:21] Young young man walked in there. I don't
[2:25:22] even know him. I never even seen him. I
[2:25:25] happened to be here or there. You know
[2:25:26] how it is. And he comes in and I say,
[2:25:28] "How you doing? How you doing, son?
[2:25:30] What's up?" "What's up, bud?" He goes,
[2:25:31] "Can I get baptized?" I said, "Sure."
[2:25:32] When? He goes, "Now?" Oh, well, Jesse,
[2:25:35] he was he was before Nathan took over.
[2:25:37] He goes I go, "Well, youth pastor suited
[2:25:38] up because the youth."
[2:25:41] He walks out of there. I go, "We've got
[2:25:42] one baptism. Stop everybody from
[2:25:44] leaving." Half the church had already
[2:25:45] gone on. I said, "Stop everybody from
[2:25:47] leaving so we can get people in there to
[2:25:48] baptize. You know, we we need
[2:25:49] witnesses." Here comes another one. Here
[2:25:51] comes another one. Here comes another
[2:25:52] one. Here comes another one. By the time
[2:25:54] we're done, we got six young people
[2:25:55] getting baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:25:56] Jesus Christ.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Jess is just standing in the water
[2:25:59] getting all, you know, pruny looking.
[2:26:02] And I said, "Man, we need seven."
[2:26:07] And brother Jeff said, "You know what? I
[2:26:11] need to rededicate my life to the Lord."
[2:26:12] He took off his shoes, Brother Jack, and
[2:26:14] his suit and everything. Got in the
[2:26:16] water, said, "Brother Jesse, baptize me
[2:26:18] one more time."
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Seven.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; That's just as good as his first one.
[2:26:25] But sometimes you just need to I don't
[2:26:26] know what I call it, Brother Jack, is a
[2:26:28] reset button.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; I just want to start over,
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; right? God recognizes whatever he
[2:26:33] recognizes. But just say, you know, just
[2:26:34] for my own sake, I want to just feel,
[2:26:37] but it was nice. I can't believe you
[2:26:39] ruined that suit.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; It's not ruined. Don't get mad.
[2:26:45] I'm glad it's not ruined. But we had
[2:26:47] seven.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; That was his last official act there.
[2:26:49] And I go, "What a way to go out." And it
[2:26:51] was nice because I'm walking back to the
[2:26:53] office and the Lord said, "I just want
[2:26:54] you to see what I thought of your
[2:26:56] ministry."
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Don't worry what other people think or
[2:26:58] say. You just keep on going.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just keep on asking. You just
[2:27:02] keep on searching. I'll show you how to
[2:27:04] get there.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Man, if he was good enough to show us
[2:27:06] where he started, where we started,
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; then he then I know that he's going to
[2:27:10] be faithful in us to get us all the way
[2:27:12] there.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; I have no doubt anymore.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; I told I told our home church this. I
[2:27:18] said it like this. I go, I don't have to
[2:27:19] believe I'm going to make it. I know I
[2:27:21] am.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know the difference? I can. Do
[2:27:24] you all know the difference?
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; But you can't just say it if you don't
[2:27:28] know. You got to know. You know,
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; See, brother Caleb has been this a
[2:27:31] while. Brother Jack, I believe you you
[2:27:33] you must know.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Say, well, yeah, but it says have faith
[2:27:37] and believe. Yeah, you have faith and
[2:27:39] believe until you know,
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; You see, we waited so many years for
[2:27:42] Nadine to be born, and I had to believe
[2:27:45] and have faith for that. But then when
[2:27:47] she was born, I didn't have to have
[2:27:49] faith and believe anymore.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; I know she's here.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you a question. If I
[2:27:53] stop believing and having faith for
[2:27:54] Nadine, is she going to disappear? No,
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; she's here whether I have faith or
[2:27:59] believe anyway.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; So if I'm in heaven, I got to faith and
[2:28:04] believe till I get to heaven. If I get
[2:28:05] to heaven, I stop having faith and
[2:28:06] believe and I'm going to fall out.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; No, I'm there. So there's going to come
[2:28:11] a point in your life where you don't
[2:28:12] there's certain things now I still have
[2:28:14] to have faith and believe for other
[2:28:15] things like money,
[2:28:19] you know, uh faith and believe that if I
[2:28:22] go jogging, I'm going to be able to jog
[2:28:23] and come back without, you know, falling
[2:28:25] over or something, you know.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; But as far as getting to heaven,
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have faith and belief
[2:28:30] for that at all.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to make it.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "I'm going to make it." He
[2:28:37] already said I would, right? He said,
[2:28:41] God said,
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that's ever going to
[2:28:44] be able to take that away from me.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care if I have to stand by
[2:28:47] myself and preach to an empty room. I
[2:28:49] still know I'm going when he comes.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; We must be that people.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; You have to know your bride. I know
[2:28:58] brother said, "Nobody knows and all
[2:28:59] this." Well, maybe then nobody knew.
[2:29:01] Brother Jack, you know, in the
[2:29:03] scriptures, uh, 1 Corinthians 9, oh man,
[2:29:06] here we go again. 1 Corinthians.
[2:29:08] Well, I know it's verse 9 and 10. I keep
[2:29:10] thinking, forget about the chapter, but
[2:29:11] it says, "Eye has not seen, ear is not
[2:29:12] heard, what is recorded, even recorded
[2:29:14] in God's word, what he has in store for
[2:29:16] them."
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Right. And everybody stops there, don't
[2:29:18] they?
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Most preachers just stop there.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; They don't say no more than that.
[2:29:24] And they and they use it as a as a
[2:29:25] copout. You see, weren't you sitting
[2:29:27] there earlier? Y'all switched. That's
[2:29:30] nice. But then he goes, you know, Peter,
[2:29:32] my eye has not seen, ears not heard. I'm
[2:29:35] like, well, maybe you haven't seen,
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; maybe you haven't heard.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; But if you continue just a little bit
[2:29:40] further in verse 10, it said, "But it
[2:29:43] has been revealed to us by his spirit."
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; So maybe you didn't know you were bride,
[2:29:51] but in this day and age, there's got to
[2:29:53] be just a little bit more than
[2:29:55] believing. I know
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; who I am.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; How are you? Well, that's kind of like
[2:30:01] an oxymoron. The bride, no one knows who
[2:30:02] bride is. Well, then why did brother
[2:30:03] Bran say when the bride recognizes who
[2:30:05] she is?
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are?
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; No question about it.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; All the confidence in the world.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Can anybody talk you out of it?
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Did anybody talk you into it?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Then that's all there is to it. Amen.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, would you come?
[2:30:25] [Applause]
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; More of you.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Just more
[2:30:37] of you.
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; I've had it all.
[2:30:43] But what I need is more of you.
[2:30:50] [Music]
[2:30:52] You got to help me with that one.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Had my feel
[2:30:59] [Music]
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; yet I hunger still.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:31:09] and bear
[2:31:12] hunger.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; More of you.
[2:31:19] Praise the Lord. That one. I'm sorry. I
[2:31:23] don't know.
[2:31:25] Uh I'mma give you
[2:31:27] [Music]
[2:31:31] I just um wanted to um mention that I I
[2:31:36] thank the Lord for the word on tonight.
[2:31:39] Um this 11th hour worker that um Brother
[2:31:44] Caleb is bringing
[2:31:46] to our attention. I think we've we've
[2:31:49] read the scripture
[2:31:51] uh for years. We we we have many quotes
[2:31:54] for brother Brandham. Even he read it
[2:31:56] tonight where brother Random identified
[2:31:58] us at the as that 11th hour worker. But
[2:32:01] when you experiencing something at your
[2:32:04] church
[2:32:05] where you got people jumping your fence,
[2:32:10] um, don't look like everybody else,
[2:32:12] don't dress like everybody else, but yet
[2:32:14] they jump in your fence trying to get
[2:32:17] into your church, then you begin to look
[2:32:19] at things a little differently,
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; right? And and and you know, I I think
[2:32:24] for me, I think that's a good problem to
[2:32:26] have. And if you know anything about the
[2:32:28] area that um out in, you know, Tucson
[2:32:32] and everything, I I know of churches
[2:32:34] where even believers can't even get on
[2:32:38] the property
[2:32:39] at certain times.
[2:32:42] Hallelujah.
[2:32:43] And the ones from Tucson know all about
[2:32:46] it. If even if you're a believer, you
[2:32:48] not getting in that church. Now, you can
[2:32:51] imagine if a unbeliever show up
[2:32:56] Oo my goodness. But yet the Lord is
[2:32:59] sending them. And I I have to say this.
[2:33:01] I thank God for who he made brother how
[2:33:05] he made brother Caleb and who he made
[2:33:06] brother Caleb because the people have to
[2:33:09] have somewhere they can go.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they can get the word of the
[2:33:13] Lord. And and and I've learned this as
[2:33:16] well when when new people are coming
[2:33:17] into the house of the Lord. Um don't
[2:33:21] give them all the dos and don'ts.
[2:33:25] Don't don't don't don't start with this
[2:33:27] and don't do this and don't then you'll
[2:33:29] be one of us if you don't do this. If
[2:33:31] the Holy Ghost don't make them stop
[2:33:33] doing that
[2:33:36] then all we're doing is is is making
[2:33:39] them conform to to our standards. And
[2:33:42] brother Brandham said you can't make
[2:33:44] Christians by conformity. Not like that.
[2:33:47] It's got to be something that happens on
[2:33:49] the inside. And our job is just to
[2:33:51] preach it and then let God just do take
[2:33:54] care of the rest. So I thank the Lord
[2:33:56] for this, brother. I appreciate, Amen.
[2:33:58] how the Lord is brought this to our
[2:34:00] attention tonight. Thank you for
[2:34:03] sharing.
[2:34:06] I know that I can make it.
[2:34:11] I know that I can stand. Why don't y'all
[2:34:15] help me sing it? Stand to your feet.
[2:34:18] may come my way. My life is in your
[2:34:23] hands. Come on. I know that I can make
[2:34:25] it. Know that I can make it.
[2:34:30] And I know
[2:34:34] no matter
[2:34:36] matter what may come my way. Oh my life.
[2:34:44] You don't have to worry. You don't have
[2:34:48] to worry.
[2:34:51] Don't you be afraid.
[2:34:55] For joy comes in the morning.
[2:35:00] Troubles don't last always.
[2:35:05] For there's a friend in Jesus
[2:35:10] who will wipe your tears away.
[2:35:15] When your heart is broken,
[2:35:19] hold
[2:35:20] your hands and say,
[2:35:24] "Yes, I know that I can make it."
[2:35:32] No matter
[2:35:35] what
[2:35:38] my life
[2:35:40] [Music]

[2:37:32] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:37:36] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:37:40] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[2:37:43] know, Brother Caleb was finishing the
[2:37:46] sermon and he made mention of six people
[2:37:52] being baptized. And he says, "No, six
[2:37:54] ain't the right number.
[2:37:56] It's got to be seven. It's got to be
[2:37:59] seven." and brother Jeff
[2:38:02] uh decided that he wanted to be baptized
[2:38:06] and just rededicate his life. And I'm
[2:38:09] glad that he spoke that because we had a
[2:38:12] young brother do the same thing here.
[2:38:14] And uh and after he did that, uh the
[2:38:18] Lord filled him with the Holy Ghost. So
[2:38:22] it was just a confirmation.
[2:38:25] Amen. And you know and and if there's
[2:38:28] you know anybody when you hear things
[2:38:29] like that and you hear what God is doing
[2:38:31] if there's anybody ever come to a spot
[2:38:33] like well you know what I want to do the
[2:38:35] same thing I want to rededicate my life.
[2:38:37] We we need to be sure certain
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; that there's nothing between us and God
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; right and u so I I encourage if you want
[2:38:47] to do that then you just get in touch
[2:38:49] and let's make arrangements so we can
[2:38:51] get you baptized. Amen. Sometimes the,
[2:38:53] you know, the devil will try to fight
[2:38:55] you in areas like that, but um, you
[2:38:57] know, I don't want nobody to say, "No,
[2:38:59] no, no, no. Let people be a witness of
[2:39:01] what God is doing in your life." Right?
[2:39:04] But I tell you, we've had two, we just
[2:39:07] heard two different testimonies from
[2:39:09] different sides of the United States.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; But God is calling his people. Amen. God
[2:39:14] is calling his people. Be sensitive to
[2:39:16] the voice of the Lord. Amen. God bless
[2:39:19] you. Let us have a word of prayer. Amen.
[2:39:22] Um just remind you that service on
[2:39:26] Sunday morning uh starts at 9:30. Amen.
[2:39:31] Service starts at 9:30. Uh we are
[2:39:34] sharing this facility with another
[2:39:37] church. So they come in after us on
[2:39:39] Sunday morning. So we'll have to come in
[2:39:41] and Amen. and and do uh what we do and
[2:39:45] and allow them to be able to come in and
[2:39:46] have the sanctuary. So uh but 9:30 is
[2:39:49] when we'll start. Amen. Uh the the doors
[2:39:52] will be open by 8:30. Amen. For time of
[2:39:55] prayer and things like that, but uh the
[2:39:57] service itself will start right at 9:30.
[2:40:00] So keep that in mind. Also, um I had
[2:40:03] made arrangements to at least have a
[2:40:06] restaurant that would serve us uh after
[2:40:09] service. We made arrangements for IHOP
[2:40:11] here on um Forest Hill and uh Jog area.
[2:40:15] So we want the Saints just to have a
[2:40:18] little fellowship. And if uh anybody
[2:40:20] want to join, feel free to do so. Amen.
[2:40:23] We'll be going there following the
[2:40:25] service. Let's just bow in a word of
[2:40:27] prayer. Father,
[2:40:30] we thank you,
[2:40:32] Lord Jesus,
[2:40:36] for your word that has been spoken
[2:40:39] uh to our hearts.
[2:40:42] Lord, we um just what amazing Grace
[2:40:47] Temple is experiencing all these
[2:40:49] different ones coming there. Thank you,
[2:40:51] Lord, that you've given brother Caleb
[2:40:53] wisdom to work with the people in the
[2:40:55] condition in which they are. Uh I trust
[2:40:59] Lord Jesus,
[2:41:01] God, that as the word is coming to them,
[2:41:04] it will continue to take them further.
[2:41:06] And Lord Jesus, we uh we want to be
[2:41:08] mindful of how you might send different
[2:41:10] ones here in our uh direction. We want
[2:41:14] to be sensitive to what the spirit of
[2:41:16] the Lord is doing in our midst. Be
[2:41:18] watchful, Father, those that have been
[2:41:20] invited to come from the the hedges, the
[2:41:23] highways, the byways, Lord, to feel the
[2:41:26] table of the Lord. God, we ask that you
[2:41:28] would just make us sensitive to what the
[2:41:30] spirit is doing in this hour. Lord, as
[2:41:33] we prepare to leave this place but not
[2:41:35] your presence, may the spirit of God go
[2:41:38] before us and Lord, just bless, amen,
[2:41:40] our time of fellowship. And Lord, as the
[2:41:43] saints would just go about on tomorrow,
[2:41:45] we ask that you would bless and Amen.
[2:41:47] all that they would do, Father. And just
[2:41:49] trust, Lord Jesus, that you would keep
[2:41:51] us until we're able to come back
[2:41:52] together again uh on Sunday morning. May
[2:41:55] the spirit of the Lord meet us, Father,
[2:41:57] in only way that you can. We give you
[2:41:59] all the glory. We give you all the
[2:42:01] honor. We give you all the praise in
[2:42:04] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[2:42:08] bless you. Amen. You can be seated. The
[2:42:11] brothers will come. Amen. At this time
[2:42:14] we'll dismiss you. Amen. God bless you.
