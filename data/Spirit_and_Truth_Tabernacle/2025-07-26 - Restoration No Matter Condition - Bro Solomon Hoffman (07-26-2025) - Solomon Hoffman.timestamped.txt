[5:18] Let's just bow our heads for a word of
[5:20] prayer. If you have got a need this
[5:23] morning, you can show by raising your
[5:24] hands.
[5:27] Mighty and gracious divine heavenly
[5:29] father.
[5:31] Lord, we are gathered once again. Alm
[5:33] mighty Jehovah
[5:36] at the same place where we are expecting
[5:38] Lord God Almighty greater testimonies
[5:42] this morning.
[5:43] We appreciate you Lord for taking care
[5:46] of us oh father in our respective homes.
[5:50] We give glory unto you and honor
[5:54] for you are the high priest of all our
[5:56] confessions
[5:58] father God this morning Lord Jesus
[6:00] Christ may you move from bench to bench
[6:03] father from heart to heart. For we know
[6:06] before we came in this place, Lord, the
[6:09] angels had already prepared and dusted
[6:11] our seats, expecting the children of God
[6:14] to come and eat as much as they can. Oh
[6:17] God Almighty, now we raise our eyes
[6:21] looking at that rugged crew across of
[6:23] Calvary, raising our cups, Almighty
[6:26] Jehovah, expecting you to fill them
[6:29] until they can overflow. We want to say
[6:32] thank you, Father, for your spirit that
[6:34] is within this place, Lord God Almighty.
[6:36] There is something that is going to take
[6:38] place in this house this morning. The
[6:41] word is coming, Lord Lord God Almighty,
[6:43] like a two-edged sword, oh dear God
[6:46] Almighty, piercing our hearts, Almighty
[6:49] Jehovah, uplifting us once more, taking
[6:52] us to greater highs. And Lord, as
[6:55] children of God, we will cry until you
[6:58] give us our milk. We are taught by the
[7:01] prophet that if you ask anything from
[7:03] him, ask in big almighty Jehovah. We are
[7:07] asking big things this morning. Oh God
[7:10] almighty. May the Holy Spirit, oh God,
[7:13] fall upon this placeh. The tables have
[7:15] been set this morning. We are expecting
[7:18] fire from on high. Let it be and let it
[7:21] be recorded in heaven that the children
[7:23] of God are gathered this morning. Lord,
[7:27] looking unto you, the giver and finisher
[7:29] of all our faith. We thank you, Lord.
[7:32] May you bless the song service. May you
[7:34] bless my brother Solomon here as he take
[7:37] his position. Lord, we know songs will
[7:40] chase away demons. We want to tell the
[7:42] devil that this place now we are
[7:45] declaring it a nonflying zone for the
[7:48] devil. We are saying, we are raising our
[7:50] faith in the name of Jesus Christ. Come
[7:54] by dear God and fill in the hearts of
[7:56] your people in Jesus name we pray and
[7:59] believe take control my father as we
[8:02] look unto you. Father we are taught by
[8:06] Amram that you have got ears. You have
[8:09] got eyes to see. You have got memory.
[8:12] Father we are putting our prayers before
[8:15] thee. Let it come unto thy nostrils oh
[8:17] God as a sweet savor as we look unto
[8:21] you. Father in Jesus name we pray and
[8:23] believe. Amen.

[8:33] I'm going to read out
[8:37] Proverbsapter 3 says, "My son, forget
[8:40] not my law, but let thine heart keep my
[8:43] commandments for length of days and long
[8:46] life and peace shall they add to thee.
[8:49] Let not mercy and truth for bind them
[8:53] about thy neck. Write them upon the
[8:55] table of thine heart. So shalt thou find
[8:58] faith
[8:59] &gt;&gt; and good understanding in the sight of
[9:01] God and man. Trust in the Lord with all
[9:04] thine heart and lean not to thine own
[9:06] understanding. In all thy ways
[9:08] acknowledge him shall
[9:15] Jesus.

[46:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, such grace you have extended
[46:46] to me.
[47:02] Praise the Lord. I thank God for mama.
[47:10] Amen.
[47:11] Amen. Amen. We're so happy uh to be back
[47:14] fellowship on this morning
[47:18] and uh again so happy that many of you
[47:20] all come from far and from here to be a
[47:23] part of I will restore saying the Lord
[47:26] meetings. Amen. As we mentioned, it's
[47:30] been a while since we've been doing
[47:32] meetings in July. Uh but we just had in
[47:35] our heart that we wanted to get this
[47:38] going again. Uh Brother Wesco was the
[47:40] one that got these things started and u
[47:44] u we will never forget some of the times
[47:47] that we've had. Uh and we trust that
[47:49] this weekend will also be a weekend that
[47:52] God would just cause us to uh be
[47:54] maintained in our memories. This morning
[47:57] we have um a minister coming and I want
[48:02] to just make mention uh that the
[48:05] ministers that were uh selected to
[48:08] preach during these services have been
[48:11] ministers that have blessed Spirit and
[48:14] Truth Tabernacle.
[48:16] Praise the Lord.
[48:20] Amen.
[48:22] And through prayer and uh just much
[48:25] discussion even with my deacons uh we
[48:29] wanted to um bring ministry in that not
[48:33] only would be a blessing to spirit and
[48:34] truth tabernacle but those that would
[48:36] gather uh with us. We believe that these
[48:38] ministers will be a blessing to you as
[48:40] well. As I mentioned last night, God
[48:42] made you a promise. And his promise was
[48:47] that you will eat in plenty and you will
[48:51] be satisfied.
[48:54] Praise God. Uh this morning we have a
[48:57] precious brother coming to us from uh
[49:01] North Carolina. Uh some of you are
[49:04] familiar with him, others may not be
[49:06] familiar with him. And um just tap on
[49:09] the door to make sure
[49:10] is ready to come. Um, others may not,
[49:14] but nonetheless, if you don't know him,
[49:17] you will know him after this service is
[49:20] over.
[49:23] You will you will you'll know him after
[49:25] the service is over. So, uh, but brother
[49:27] Solomon Hoffman, amen, will be coming to
[49:30] us, uh, this morning to minister. And,
[49:34] uh, I know the Lord has given him a
[49:36] word, uh, just for you. Please don't
[49:38] just look at him, but enter in and uh
[49:41] pull on the word of God. I I heard it
[49:44] said, "If you pull,
[49:46] I preach."
[49:48] [Music]
[49:49] And I believe you pull on Brother
[49:51] Solomon, um the Lord will use him to
[49:53] preach to your needs. Amen. On this
[49:55] morning, praise the Lord. Let's just uh
[49:57] prepare. Amen. To bring him to bring him
[50:00] on.
[50:04] [Music]
[50:09] If you stand to your feet,
[50:12] [Music]
[50:15] amazing
[50:18] grace,
[50:20] how sweet
[50:24] the sound, oh that say
[50:29] a rich like
[50:33] me.
[50:36] Oh,
[50:38] I once
[50:40] was.
[50:43] Oh, but now now I'm found. Oh, was
[50:51] blind,
[50:53] but now
[51:00] [Music]
[51:02] Amazing
[51:06] grace.
[51:08] How sweet
[51:11] the sound.
[51:14] Would that save
[51:17] a rich
[51:20] like me?
[51:24] [Music]
[51:26] I once
[51:29] was lost.
[51:32] Oh, but now
[51:34] I'm found.
[51:37] And I was blind.
[51:41] But now
[51:43] I see.
[51:47] Amen. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that
[51:49] this morning?
[51:51] Amen. That's a song the angels know
[51:53] nothing about. I tell you, ain't that
[51:56] powerful to realize that we can
[51:57] literally do something that angels can't
[51:59] even do? You've got to praise that the
[52:02] angels have to sit down and listen to
[52:04] you praise God and listen to you
[52:06] worship. My I tell you, you know what a
[52:10] what a revelation it is to know the
[52:13] grace of God. Amen. You love the Lord
[52:16] this morning and you're looking forward
[52:18] to what God has in store for you. Amen.
[52:21] I tell you, the prophet taught us very
[52:23] clearly. He said, "You always get what
[52:24] you expect." And uh I was just reading
[52:27] this quotation there in the back, but
[52:30] brother Ram says here in expectations.
[52:32] He said, "If you come expecting to
[52:34] criticize the meeting," he said, "the
[52:36] devil will show you something every
[52:39] single time." So I'll go ahead and tell
[52:41] you, you can look right here if you want
[52:43] to find something to criticize. You
[52:45] don't have to look far at all to find
[52:47] something. But the prophet said, he
[52:49] said, "But if you come and you're
[52:51] expecting for God to speak to you,
[52:54] you're expecting for God to heal you,
[52:55] you're expecting to be restored,
[52:58] whatever it is," he said, "you'll get
[52:59] what you expect." I don't know about
[53:01] you, but I'm expecting a refilling, a
[53:04] refreshing, a renewing of the Holy
[53:07] Ghost. Amen. And and we'll get exactly
[53:10] what we expect. And so, uh, we just want
[53:12] to humble our spirits this morning and
[53:14] go to the Lord in a word of prayer. And
[53:17] if you have a need upon your heart, just
[53:19] slip your hand up to the Lord and say,
[53:20] "Lord, come by my way and speak to me."
[53:23] I tell you, there's not a place too low
[53:25] that his hand can't reach. Amen. There's
[53:28] not a problem too great that our God
[53:30] can't solve. Amen. God's still in the
[53:32] moving business. Let's just approach him
[53:34] now. Lord, what an honor it is to be in
[53:37] the presence of not just a king, but
[53:40] Lord, to be here in the presence of the
[53:41] King of Kings, Lord. And you said in
[53:44] your word that if we would come and we
[53:46] would knock on the door, it would be
[53:47] open to us. So Lord, we're knocking this
[53:50] morning. We're knocking for a refilling
[53:52] of the Holy Ghost. We're knocking on the
[53:53] door for healing in our bodies, Lord.
[53:56] We're knocking on the door for
[53:57] salvation, Lord, for restoration, for
[54:00] whatever the need is. You said if we
[54:01] knock that it would be opened unto us,
[54:04] Lord. And we believe your word this
[54:05] morning, Lord. We just come into this
[54:08] place with praise and thanksgiving upon
[54:10] our lips, Lord. We want to just worship
[54:13] you for a moment, Lord, and thank you
[54:15] for the grace and the mercy that you've
[54:17] showed to us, Lord. You're the King of
[54:18] Kings. You're the God of gods. You're
[54:21] the Lord of Lords. You're the You're the
[54:23] God who's mighty in battle. And your
[54:25] name is Jesus, the name that's above
[54:27] every name. And we worship that great
[54:29] name this morning. We pray that you'll
[54:31] just have total control in these
[54:33] meetings. Lord, we pray that you have
[54:34] preeminence. Lord, I pray that you just
[54:37] anoint speaker and hearer alike. I pray
[54:39] that you would be high and lifted up and
[54:41] your glory would fill this place this
[54:43] morning, Lord. Lord, we just give
[54:45] ourselves to you. We give this meeting
[54:47] to you. We pray in the most matchless
[54:49] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[54:53] And the church said,
[54:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen." That means so be it. Amen. May
[54:57] God bless you this morning. We just want
[54:59] to get straight into the word. And uh
[55:01] I'll invite you into your scriptures in
[55:04] Malachi the 4th chapter and also in Joel
[55:08] the 2 chapter and one place in Acts the
[55:11] 2 chapter. As you're turning there, we
[55:13] just greet you this morning the name of
[55:14] the Lord and certainly counting the
[55:16] great honor and privilege to be here
[55:18] speaking to you. And uh we just want to
[55:20] put our shoulder to the wheel. Amen. And
[55:22] try to be a blessing and a help to the
[55:24] children of God. And uh we're just
[55:26] looking forward to what God has in store
[55:28] for us. And I believe the scripture says
[55:30] I has not seen and ear has not heard the
[55:33] things that God has in store for us. And
[55:35] uh we just want to appreciate brother
[55:37] Jack and the invitation to come. It's a
[55:39] great honor uh to be a part of these
[55:41] meetings and I've just known Brother
[55:43] Jack for several years now and I count
[55:44] him to be a dear friend and have great
[55:46] respects for him and the church here in
[55:49] this uh in this area in Florida. And I
[55:51] believe you're a lighthouse to the
[55:53] message of the hour. And I tell you, we
[55:55] should never let that fire burn out. We
[55:57] should never let it get dim, but we
[55:59] should hold up the the the banner of the
[56:01] message of the hour. And I believe that
[56:04] church does this and we just appreciate
[56:06] all the work and we just had our annual
[56:08] meetings there at our church. Uh where
[56:11] Josh Bennett's our pastor in Newton,
[56:12] North Carolina and uh so we know that a
[56:15] lot of work goes into a meeting, but I
[56:17] tell you as they were singing last
[56:19] night, your labor is not in vain. And uh
[56:22] we're just trusting the Lord that
[56:24] there'll be eternal fruit come forth out
[56:26] of this meeting. And so, uh, may God
[56:28] just bless you this morning, and we
[56:30] won't prolong the time, but let's read
[56:32] here in Malachi the 4th chapter and the
[56:34] first verse. The Bible says this, "For
[56:37] behold, the day cometh that shall burn
[56:40] as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and
[56:43] all that do wickedly shall be stubble,
[56:46] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[56:48] up, sayaeth the Lord of hosts, and then
[56:51] it shall leave neither root nor branch.
[56:54] But unto you that fear my name, shall
[56:56] the son of righteousness arise with
[56:59] healing in his wings, and ye shall go
[57:01] forth and grow up as calves of the
[57:04] stall, and ye shall tread down the
[57:06] wicked. I just love prophecy, don't you?
[57:09] And you shall tread down the wicked, for
[57:11] they shall be ashes under the souls of
[57:13] your feet in the day that I shall do
[57:16] this, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. If you
[57:19] ever need a scripture to remind the
[57:20] devil of and when you're in the middle
[57:22] of a battle, just read that scripture to
[57:24] the devil and remind him that he will be
[57:27] ashes underneath your feet. Amen. I'm
[57:31] sorry, but I just believe the word and I
[57:33] believe exactly what it says is exactly
[57:35] what'll happen. And remember ye the law
[57:38] of Moses, my servant, which I commanded
[57:40] unto him, and for all Israel with the
[57:43] statures and judgments. And behold, I
[57:46] will send you. Elijah the prophet. Now
[57:50] notice that scripture. I will send who?
[57:52] I will send you. So we can talk about
[57:55] Elijah, but we need to talk about who's
[57:57] the you part. I believe you is you. I'll
[58:00] send unto you. Elijah the prophet before
[58:03] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[58:05] of the Lord. And he shall turn the
[58:07] hearts of the fathers to the children,
[58:10] and the hearts of the children to their
[58:13] fathers, lest I come and smite the earth
[58:15] with a curse. And Joel 2 and 25,
[58:20] let's read this scripture as well. The
[58:22] Bible says, as brother Jack was reading
[58:24] last night, uh these things have just
[58:26] been on my heart for the past month or
[58:28] two, but uh nevertheless, we just want
[58:30] to speak what God's led us to. Uh the
[58:32] Bible says, "And I will restore to you
[58:34] the years that the locust hath eaten,
[58:37] the cankerorm, and the caterpillar and
[58:40] the palmer worm my great army which I
[58:42] sent among you. And ye shall eat in
[58:45] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[58:48] name of the Lord your God that hath
[58:49] dealt wondrously with you, and my people
[58:52] shall never be ashamed.
[58:55] And ye shall know that I'm in the midst
[58:57] of Israel, and that I am the Lord your
[59:00] God, and none else." and my people shall
[59:03] never be ashamed. In Acts 2 and one, and
[59:06] when the day of Pentecost was fully came
[59:08] or fully come, they were all in one
[59:11] accord in one place. And suddenly there
[59:14] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[59:17] mighty wind, and a filled all the house
[59:19] where they were sitting. And there
[59:21] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[59:23] as a fire, and it sat upon each of them.
[59:26] And they were all filled with the Holy
[59:28] Ghost and began to speak with other
[59:31] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[59:32] utterance. If you'll skip down to the
[59:34] 14th verse. But Peter standing up with
[59:37] the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[59:40] them, "Ye men of Judea and all ye that
[59:43] dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto
[59:46] you, and hearken to my words, for these
[59:49] are not drunken as ye suppose, seeing it
[59:52] is but the third hour of the day. This
[59:54] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[59:57] Joel. It shall come to pass in the last
[59:59] days, saith God, I will pour out my
[1:00:02] spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and
[1:00:05] your daughters shall prophesy, and your
[1:00:08] young men shall see visions, and your
[1:00:10] old men shall dream dreams. Amen. We
[1:00:13] just ask God would bless his word as you
[1:00:14] can be seated this morning. And by the
[1:00:17] help and grace of God, I want to take a
[1:00:19] subject from this and speak to you on
[1:00:21] restoration. no matter condition. Amen.
[1:00:25] Restoration no matter condition. As
[1:00:28] brother Jack was saying last night, I
[1:00:30] thought it was very fitting with the
[1:00:31] things I was studying. But he kept on
[1:00:34] repeating it was God that made the
[1:00:36] promise that you shall eat in plenty.
[1:00:38] And we know it was God that made the
[1:00:40] promise that he would restore everything
[1:00:43] to us. So let me ask you a question as
[1:00:45] we start. Is anything too hard for God?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And is anybody able to stop God? Amen.
[1:00:51] There's not a power too great. There's
[1:00:53] not any devil in hell that is going to
[1:00:56] be able to stop God from doing what he
[1:00:58] said he's going to do. So if God said,
[1:01:01] "I'll restore to you everything that you
[1:01:03] lost," it's not up to you to figure out.
[1:01:06] It's not up to you to question. It's not
[1:01:08] up to you to think about. It's just up
[1:01:10] to you to lift your hand and say amen to
[1:01:13] the word. Amen. That's the problem. We
[1:01:15] want to figure this out. How? How? When?
[1:01:17] Where? How? When? Amen. God don't want
[1:01:19] you to do that. God just wants you to
[1:01:21] say, "Amen. Be it unto me according to
[1:01:24] thy word." And I believe if we would
[1:01:25] have that attitude with all of the word
[1:01:28] of God, it would solve a lot of debates.
[1:01:30] It would solve a lot of problems. It
[1:01:32] would solve a lot of arguing. Instead of
[1:01:34] debating what the Bible said, why don't
[1:01:36] you just say amen to what the Bible
[1:01:38] said? Instead of wanting to debate what
[1:01:41] the message of the hour has brought us,
[1:01:43] why don't we just say amen to what the
[1:01:45] message has said? Amen. and we'll get
[1:01:47] the results that God has promised in his
[1:01:50] word. Now, I believe we're living in a
[1:01:52] time that all things has been restored.
[1:01:54] How many believes that in this place?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; We're living in a time that everything
[1:01:58] has been restored. I believe that the
[1:02:00] faith which was once delivered to the
[1:02:02] saints, that faith has been restored
[1:02:05] back to the church of the living God. I
[1:02:07] believe that the fullness of the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost has been restored also back to the
[1:02:12] church of the living God. See the
[1:02:14] prophet said the Holy Ghost was bound at
[1:02:16] the doors of creeds and denominations.
[1:02:19] He said the Holy Ghost was bound at the
[1:02:21] church door. But the prophet said in
[1:02:24] this evening time, Amen. He is no longer
[1:02:27] bound at the door, but he is inside the
[1:02:30] door and he's doing what he did again in
[1:02:33] Acts the 2 chapter. Amen. Now listen,
[1:02:35] you can bind the Holy Spirit in your
[1:02:38] life if you want to. Amen. But as for me
[1:02:40] in my house, I welcome the Holy Spirit
[1:02:43] into this door. And I believe that the
[1:02:45] fullness of the Holy Spirit has been
[1:02:48] released in the end time. I believe
[1:02:50] we've been restored back to the original
[1:02:53] Holy Ghost of the Bible. I believe that
[1:02:56] the scriptural balance of all things has
[1:02:58] been restored. Amen. The church was far
[1:03:00] out on left field and emotionalism. And
[1:03:02] the church was far out in the right
[1:03:04] field. And all we all we need is the
[1:03:06] word and no spirit. But this message
[1:03:08] came to restore us to the middle of the
[1:03:11] road where it's not just emotionalism
[1:03:13] and Pentecostalism, but it's the word
[1:03:16] and it's the spirit. It's spirit and
[1:03:18] it's true tabernacle. Amen. And we're
[1:03:21] restored back to the word of almighty
[1:03:24] God. Amen. I pity people that say we
[1:03:27] don't need the spirit. You may not need
[1:03:29] it, but I sure need the Holy Spirit.
[1:03:31] Well, preacher, we're deeper than that.
[1:03:33] Well, in Acts the 2 chapter, they wasn't
[1:03:35] too deep for the Holy Ghost. They wasn't
[1:03:38] too deep for the word of God. So, you're
[1:03:40] telling me you got deeper than they got
[1:03:42] in Acts the 2 chapter? That you don't
[1:03:44] need the spirit. As for me, I want the
[1:03:47] spirit and I want the word because the
[1:03:50] Bible says the word without the spirit,
[1:03:52] it is dead and it kills. Amen. But with
[1:03:56] the spirit, there is life and life
[1:03:58] above. Amen. That's the reason you can't
[1:04:01] make the word live in your life is
[1:04:03] because you don't have the dynamics of
[1:04:05] the Holy Spirit. But the prophet said
[1:04:08] that dynamics of the church would be the
[1:04:11] refilling of the Holy Spirit. And the
[1:04:13] prophet said it will put the church in a
[1:04:16] state of action. Hey, we're not a dead
[1:04:19] church. Amen. We're a church that is
[1:04:21] alive this morning. Amen. And well with
[1:04:24] the dynamics of the Holy Ghost. See,
[1:04:26] we've been restored back to the spirit
[1:04:29] of the Almighty. And that spirit is in
[1:04:32] our midst. See, I believe this message
[1:04:34] restored us back to the middle of the
[1:04:35] road. And we are not Pentecostal by
[1:04:39] denomination. We are not Pentecostal by
[1:04:41] emotion, but the prophet said, "We are
[1:04:44] Pentecostal by experience." Now, I know
[1:04:47] people are scared of the word Pentecost.
[1:04:49] I'm not ashamed of the word Pentecost
[1:04:51] because the Bible says when the day of
[1:04:53] Pentecost was fully come, it was all in
[1:04:56] one place and one mind and one accord
[1:04:59] and that's when the Holy Ghost fell.
[1:05:01] Amen. I'm not ashamed to be identified
[1:05:03] with the same Holy Ghost that fell in
[1:05:05] the upper room in Acts the 2 chapter.
[1:05:08] Amen. The Bible says that I will
[1:05:10] restore. Amen. And my people shall eat
[1:05:13] in plenty and they shall never be
[1:05:16] ashamed. Amen. Don't you ever be ashamed
[1:05:19] of the gift of the Holy Ghost. Don't you
[1:05:21] ever be ashamed of what God has done in
[1:05:23] this hour. Don't you ever be ashamed of
[1:05:25] the message of the hour. Let me tell
[1:05:27] you, if God himself was not ashamed to
[1:05:30] have his picture taken with the prophet
[1:05:33] of God, then why on earth would I be
[1:05:35] ashamed to be identified with the end
[1:05:38] time Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Revelation
[1:05:42] 10:7 follower. Amen. I am not ashamed
[1:05:45] with what God has done in this
[1:05:48] generation. Amen. I'm a believer of what
[1:05:52] God has done in this generation. And
[1:05:55] because I believe I've been restored
[1:05:58] back to the original faith. I tell you
[1:06:00] what it did. Amen. It restored the shout
[1:06:02] to the church. It restored the victory
[1:06:04] to the church. It restored divine
[1:06:06] healing to the church. It restored all
[1:06:09] of the word and put it in its rightful
[1:06:11] place. That's exactly right. And I
[1:06:14] believe that it restored us to our
[1:06:15] pattern which was Pentecost.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Ephesians church age and the
[1:06:19] church age book says it this way. He
[1:06:22] said what the church was at Pentecost is
[1:06:24] the standard. Let me remind you
[1:06:27] standards don't change with time.
[1:06:29] Standards are standards. Listen. Amen.
[1:06:32] This message is not out of date. In
[1:06:34] fact, I believe it's more up to date
[1:06:36] now. Amen. Than it I hope that's okay. I
[1:06:39] believe it's more up to-date now
[1:06:40] prophetically even than it was 60 years
[1:06:43] ago. And you say, "Well, well, you know,
[1:06:45] Brother Random, he just had this way
[1:06:47] about him or this way about him." You're
[1:06:49] just looking for an excuse to not
[1:06:51] believe what a prophet taught. Amen. But
[1:06:53] listen, I believe what truth was 60
[1:06:55] years ago is still true today. Amen. And
[1:06:58] I won't stop preaching it till the day I
[1:07:00] die. Amen. Truth don't change. Amen.
[1:07:04] Because preachers change. Truth don't
[1:07:06] change. Amen. Because time change. Amen.
[1:07:09] The word is still an upto-date word. And
[1:07:11] and I just I just am a simple believer
[1:07:14] and I believe what the prophet taught
[1:07:15] and I believe that truth does not ever
[1:07:18] change. If it was truth back then, it is
[1:07:21] truth today.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, he said, "Art, nothing
[1:07:25] has changed." He said, "No matter what
[1:07:27] the scholars say, we've heard a lot of
[1:07:29] what the scholars have to say." He said,
[1:07:31] "God has not changed the pattern." What
[1:07:33] God did at Pentecost, I just love this.
[1:07:36] what God did at Pentecost, he has to
[1:07:38] keep on doing until the church age is
[1:07:41] close. And brother Bam said, he said,
[1:07:43] see those scholars may tell you the
[1:07:45] apostolic age is over. The prophet said,
[1:07:49] don't you believe it? Amen. The scholars
[1:07:52] will tell you the apostolic age is over.
[1:07:54] Don't you believe it. And so I believe
[1:07:56] that the apostolic age is still
[1:07:58] continuing. Amen. In the book of Acts,
[1:08:00] it did not end with a period. It ended
[1:08:02] with a comma. Amen. to tell you that the
[1:08:04] acts of the Holy Spirit is not done.
[1:08:08] Amen. And I believe we have been turned
[1:08:10] back to the same faith that they had in
[1:08:12] Acts the 2 chapter. I believe the bride
[1:08:14] of Christ has been restored back to that
[1:08:16] same faith. In Jude 1 and3, the Bible
[1:08:19] says this, "Beloved, when I gave all
[1:08:21] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:08:22] common salvation, it was needful for me
[1:08:24] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:08:27] you should earnestly contend." Contend
[1:08:29] means to fight. It means to wrestle. You
[1:08:32] should earnestly contend for the faith
[1:08:35] which was once delivered to the saints.
[1:08:37] Amen. I tell you friends, I want the
[1:08:39] same faith they had back then. I I don't
[1:08:42] want a different faith. I want the same
[1:08:44] faith that they was uh that the Bible
[1:08:46] says to earnestly contend for. And you
[1:08:48] know, people say, "Well, well, those
[1:08:50] days are over and the revival is over
[1:08:52] and the power of the Holy Spirit is
[1:08:54] over." I ask you to tell me where the
[1:08:56] Bible ever said that and tell me where
[1:08:58] the prophet ever said that revival was
[1:09:00] over for the bride. He never said it. He
[1:09:02] said, "Out in this world, there is no
[1:09:04] more sweeping revivals. There is no more
[1:09:07] revival in the church world. But to the
[1:09:09] bride of Jesus Christ," Amen. Our
[1:09:12] revival is not over. Our revival is
[1:09:15] still going on now. Amen. You all
[1:09:18] remember when the prophet said, "There's
[1:09:19] been nothing to wake her bride as of
[1:09:21] yet. It will take those seven unknown
[1:09:23] thunders to wake her up." And then you
[1:09:25] find the prophet declaring, amen, in
[1:09:28] 1963, amen, that the opening of the word
[1:09:31] has taken place and the bride is now
[1:09:34] awoken by the word. Amen. She Listen,
[1:09:37] friends, we're not here asleeping
[1:09:39] church. We are here, Amen, alive and
[1:09:42] revived by the power of the spoken word.
[1:09:46] Amen. You can be a dead church if you
[1:09:48] want to. Amen. But I refuse, Amen, to
[1:09:51] be, Amen, dead underneath the message
[1:09:53] God has given me. I I simply denounce
[1:09:56] that. And people say, "Well, you know,
[1:09:58] those days they're just not here no more
[1:09:59] and the Holy Spirit don't move no more
[1:10:01] and and God don't move in the midst of
[1:10:03] his people like that no more." And I
[1:10:05] like to tell them people, you got to
[1:10:06] reward that. He don't do that no more.
[1:10:09] As far as you know, because as for me,
[1:10:12] I'm getting a refilling of the Holy
[1:10:13] Ghost all the time. I'm getting my cup
[1:10:16] running over all the time. Amen. I can
[1:10:18] get it today and get it tomorrow and get
[1:10:20] it the next day. Amen. for the bride of
[1:10:22] Christ. These days are not over, but
[1:10:25] these days are right now.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what it is. It's
[1:10:30] easier for people to say those days are
[1:10:33] gone by and God don't do that no more
[1:10:35] instead of believing that they can
[1:10:37] manifest a word for their age. It's
[1:10:40] easier just to say, "God, don't do that
[1:10:42] no more." Because then it takes all the
[1:10:45] pressure away and they can just do what
[1:10:47] they want and live like they want. It's
[1:10:49] easier to say that was just for the
[1:10:51] prophet. That was just for William
[1:10:53] Brandham. He was the only one that can
[1:10:55] speak the word. He was the only one that
[1:10:57] could operate the power of the third
[1:10:58] pole. It's easier for people to say that
[1:11:01] was only for him instead of realizing
[1:11:04] that is a bride scripture and that is a
[1:11:07] bride ministry. Amen. Listen, God was
[1:11:10] not just showing you what could happen
[1:11:13] in one man's life. He was showing you
[1:11:15] what could happen in your life when
[1:11:17] you'll surrender to the same Holy Ghost
[1:11:20] that that prophet was surrendered to.
[1:11:22] You will see the same God work through
[1:11:25] you like he did him. Now, now I'm not
[1:11:27] saying you're going to have the same
[1:11:28] ministry that was one to a generation.
[1:11:30] But I am saying the same God that was
[1:11:32] with that prophet is the same God that
[1:11:35] is with the bride. I ask you, where is
[1:11:37] the Lord God of Elijah? He is right here
[1:11:40] in the midst of his church. Amen. He did
[1:11:43] not die when the prophet died. Amen. The
[1:11:46] power did not die when the prophet died,
[1:11:48] but it's right here in our midst today.
[1:11:52] We have been restored back to it. Amen.
[1:11:55] You've got to understand though. Amen.
[1:11:57] See, we're not looking back constantly.
[1:11:59] And and the prophet warned about looking
[1:12:01] back. You can look back to the good old
[1:12:02] days. And this was the good old day. And
[1:12:04] that was the good old day. And brother
[1:12:06] Random warned you and I. He said, "Don't
[1:12:08] keep looking back or you're going to
[1:12:09] wreck." So, we don't keep our eyes on
[1:12:12] what used to be, but we keep our eyes
[1:12:14] what's on front of us. And that's the
[1:12:16] reason you're missing what God is doing
[1:12:18] right in front of you because you're
[1:12:20] looking back to what Amen. spirit and
[1:12:22] truth used to be. And you're turning the
[1:12:24] back of the good old days. And you're
[1:12:26] looking back and looking back and you
[1:12:28] forget that right now in your midst that
[1:12:31] God wants to bless you more than you've
[1:12:32] ever been blessed. God wants to move in
[1:12:35] your church more than he's ever moved.
[1:12:37] But he can't do it because you're not
[1:12:39] looking for it. But the prophet said,
[1:12:41] "God will always come to those who are
[1:12:45] looking for him." Hey, it was the three
[1:12:47] magi. Amen. That looked to the stars and
[1:12:51] it led them to where Messiah was. And I
[1:12:53] fixed my eyes to another star. Amen. The
[1:12:56] seventh star. And it's led me to where
[1:12:59] Christ is. Hey, the reason we couldn't
[1:13:01] see him is because we was looking in the
[1:13:04] church and we was looking in the
[1:13:06] ministry. But the prophet said, "Amen,
[1:13:08] to look to the word, that is where
[1:13:11] Christ is."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen. We've been turned
[1:13:17] back to the original faith. And I tell
[1:13:19] you, I I just believe what the prophet
[1:13:21] taught. Don't you? Amen. We're not
[1:13:23] constantly looking back. And if the
[1:13:25] prophet said that Pentecost was the
[1:13:26] standard, I say it was the standard. If
[1:13:29] the prophet said the bride of Christ
[1:13:30] will be a continuation of the book of
[1:13:32] Acts, I say the bride of Christ is a
[1:13:34] continuation of the book of Acts. If the
[1:13:36] prophet says she can do the greater
[1:13:38] works, I say she can do the greater
[1:13:41] works. If the prophet taught us
[1:13:43] according to the word, if the vine ever
[1:13:45] puts forth another branch, they'll write
[1:13:47] another book of acts behind her and
[1:13:49] it'll be life of his life. It'll be
[1:13:51] spirit of his spirit. Then I say, Amen.
[1:13:54] The vine has put forth another branch
[1:13:56] and she will be life of his life and
[1:13:58] spirit of his spirit and she will be
[1:14:01] him.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the prophet said, Amen, that
[1:14:05] you could do the greater works and that
[1:14:07] is a right now scripture and that's for
[1:14:09] you and not for a different person, then
[1:14:12] I say that word is for us.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's time we just believe
[1:14:17] what the prophet said. Don't you? Amen.
[1:14:19] And you'll come to understand it's not
[1:14:21] the thoughts of William Brandom. was God
[1:14:23] speaking to you and I. Amen. If you just
[1:14:25] listen to it as another man or a
[1:14:27] preacher, that's all you'll get out of
[1:14:29] it. But if you listen to it as God, this
[1:14:31] is your voice to this generation and it
[1:14:34] is the voice of God to me. Then you'll
[1:14:37] hear it completely different. And you'll
[1:14:39] no longer hear it as as this is for
[1:14:41] somebody else or or this is just another
[1:14:43] man preaching, but it's God speaking to
[1:14:45] his bride. Amen. See, I believe the
[1:14:48] problem is when we start saying what we
[1:14:50] think instead of what the prophet said.
[1:14:52] We start teaching what we think about
[1:14:54] the quotes instead of just preaching
[1:14:56] what's on the quotes. We start preaching
[1:14:58] about what what I think this wings and
[1:15:00] what this means and what that mean. It's
[1:15:02] time we just get back to the old
[1:15:03] stomping ground. Amen. Why can't we just
[1:15:05] say what the prophet said? Amen. Why do
[1:15:08] we got to tiptoe and be careful and
[1:15:10] worry about it? Used to be we could just
[1:15:13] preach this message. Amen. and folks
[1:15:15] believed it. But now we got to argue and
[1:15:18] fight and what do you mean here and what
[1:15:19] do you mean there? But you're looking at
[1:15:20] a man that has been restored underneath
[1:15:23] this end time message. And I am not
[1:15:26] ashamed for I met the God of William
[1:15:29] Brandon and he's my God and he's your
[1:15:32] God and he's our God here today. I think
[1:15:36] it's time we get back to the word and
[1:15:38] let's teach what that prophet said. You
[1:15:40] say, "I I don't know about that." You
[1:15:42] got to give me a scripture. Look at
[1:15:43] Moses in the Old Testament.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I can't talk, God. I can't
[1:15:48] talk." That's all right. I will give you
[1:15:50] the words and Aaron will be your prophet
[1:15:53] and you'll be like God and you tell him
[1:15:55] what to say and he'll put and he'll
[1:15:58] preach the word. In other words, as long
[1:16:00] as Aaron, glory to God, as long as Aaron
[1:16:04] said what Moses said, Amen. the God that
[1:16:07] made the promise to Moses would honor
[1:16:10] the words of Aaron. I think it's time of
[1:16:12] Aaron raise up. Amen. And say what Moses
[1:16:15] has said. And God will back up the words
[1:16:18] of the bride. Hallelujah. He'll back up
[1:16:21] the words of the bride if we'll say what
[1:16:24] Moses has said. Amen. God will honor the
[1:16:27] word just the same.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; People wonder what the secret is. I just
[1:16:32] say what the prophet said and God backs
[1:16:34] it up. People wonder where the power is.
[1:16:36] I just teach what the prophet taught. I
[1:16:38] hope that's okay. I just got to preach
[1:16:40] my convictions. I don't mean to stomp on
[1:16:42] nobody or offend nobody. I just got to
[1:16:45] preach what God's put on my heart. Amen.
[1:16:47] If we don't play around with these
[1:16:48] things, we might get somewhere with God.
[1:16:51] Amen. Just say what he said. He said,
[1:16:54] "Say what's on them tapes." So, I say,
[1:16:58] "Say what's on them tapes."
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay. God bless you. If
[1:17:02] you don't agree, that's fine. Amen. I
[1:17:05] believe we're living in a wonderful time
[1:17:07] concerning the word. I I believe that
[1:17:09] we've had the full restoration of all
[1:17:11] the truths of the Bible. Water baptism,
[1:17:14] serpent seed, the power of the Holy
[1:17:16] Ghost, true revival. I believe all of
[1:17:19] these things have been restored and has
[1:17:21] come through the message of the air. And
[1:17:22] I want you to understand this message
[1:17:24] was not about William Brandom. This
[1:17:27] message was all about Christ the word.
[1:17:30] And it was about revealing Christ. The
[1:17:32] prophet did not come to point you to
[1:17:33] him. He come to point you to Christ the
[1:17:36] word. And I'm not lifting up William
[1:17:38] Brandham. I'm lifting up the God that he
[1:17:41] lifted up. Amen. Listen, brother Bam
[1:17:43] said himself, he said, "I didn't come to
[1:17:45] point you to me or to start an
[1:17:47] organization or to start another
[1:17:49] movement, but I want to see one thing
[1:17:51] accomplished, and that's a true
[1:17:53] relationship back with man and with
[1:17:56] God."
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well," and people come
[1:18:00] along and say, "Well, you know, I don't
[1:18:01] think we need a prophet to restore us
[1:18:03] back to the correct teaching of the
[1:18:04] Bible." Well, look at what people have
[1:18:06] done with the Bible. Amen. I was just
[1:18:08] studying last night and they say there's
[1:18:10] an estimated 45,000
[1:18:12] denominations of Christianity. And you
[1:18:15] say you don't need a prophet. Look at
[1:18:17] the world. They've got the same Bible
[1:18:18] you and I got. And they've somehow come
[1:18:20] up with 45,000 different ideas of what
[1:18:23] the Bible says. Listen, there's got to
[1:18:26] be a final say concerning these things.
[1:18:28] There's got to be a truth of it. Amen.
[1:18:31] Surely they ain't 45,000 different
[1:18:33] truths of the Bible. Amen. There's got
[1:18:35] to be one truth. And let me tell you,
[1:18:38] I've got the answer this morning. Amen.
[1:18:41] There is one truth. Amen. It is the
[1:18:43] divine interpretation with divine
[1:18:46] vindication of the word of almighty God.
[1:18:49] If you want the truth, get in this
[1:18:51] message. If you want to know what the
[1:18:53] Bible says, Amen. Open the Bible and
[1:18:55] hear what the prophet taught about it.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; I don't need a prophet. and I don't
[1:19:00] need. Well, the Bible says you do.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I won't do anything unless I reveal it
[1:19:06] to my servants to prophets. Children of
[1:19:08] Israel said, "Don't let God speak to us
[1:19:10] less we die." God said, "Okay, I won't
[1:19:12] talk to him like this anymore. I'll send
[1:19:14] the prophet." So, according to the
[1:19:16] scripture, God speaks to us through his
[1:19:18] prophets. And I believe it's time that
[1:19:20] we we receive that and we open our arms
[1:19:23] to it. If we'd stop trying to figure it
[1:19:25] all out and just say amen to the word.
[1:19:28] Amen. Listen, there has been a final
[1:19:30] voice in this age. It's a final
[1:19:33] authority. Amen. There's no more probing
[1:19:36] about the Bible. There's no more
[1:19:37] questions about the Bible. Amen. But we
[1:19:40] now have the truth of it. Amen. And see,
[1:19:43] we we all know that. Amen. The prophet
[1:19:45] said, "See, we've had the Bible for
[1:19:46] thousands of years now." And they probed
[1:19:48] at it and they guessed at it. I'm so
[1:19:50] glad to know this morning, I'm no longer
[1:19:52] probing in the Bible trying to figure it
[1:19:54] out, trying to see this. But I can say
[1:19:57] without any shadow of a doubt, this is
[1:19:59] what the Bible says and this is the
[1:20:01] truth of the word. Amen. The prophet
[1:20:05] said here in the breach, he said, "See
[1:20:06] Malachi 4, there's one supposed to come
[1:20:08] like unto Elijah whom the word of the
[1:20:10] Lord comes to and he's to reveal by the
[1:20:12] Holy Spirit all the mysteries of God and
[1:20:15] restore the faith back to the children
[1:20:18] where I turn their hearts back to the
[1:20:20] faith of the apostolic fathers." He
[1:20:22] said, "What is it?" has restored back
[1:20:24] all these mysteries that's been probed
[1:20:25] that by denominations and through all
[1:20:28] these years. He said the word is here to
[1:20:31] bring us back. I'm so glad this morning
[1:20:33] we're no longer probing and guessing and
[1:20:35] wondering is this right? Is this wrong?
[1:20:38] Is this right? If you're still doing
[1:20:39] that, brother, I have pity on you. We're
[1:20:41] no longer guessing. Is this right in the
[1:20:44] word? Is that wrong? Is this right?
[1:20:46] Amen. Listen, if you want to know the
[1:20:47] truth, hear what that prophet said.
[1:20:49] Amen. I'm not guessing. Is it okay to do
[1:20:52] this? Is it right to do this? Is it
[1:20:54] wrong to do this? Amen. If it was wrong
[1:20:56] 60 years ago, as I said before, it is
[1:20:59] wrong today. Amen. It's time we just get
[1:21:02] back to the word. And the prophet's
[1:21:04] clear. He said, "This ministry will
[1:21:06] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:21:08] children back to the faith of the
[1:21:10] fathers." What is that faith? It's the
[1:21:12] faith.
[1:21:14] It's not the Baptist faith, the
[1:21:15] Methodist faith, the Pentecostal faith.
[1:21:17] I think it's something you never heard
[1:21:19] any of them names in the Bible. Well,
[1:21:20] you never heard Baptist or Pentecostal
[1:21:22] or Methodist. Amen. The prophet said
[1:21:24] them are not biblical names. They are
[1:21:26] blasphemous names. Is that okay? Amen.
[1:21:29] They're blasphemous names that are away
[1:21:31] from Christ. But see, we've not been
[1:21:33] pointed to those faiths. We've been
[1:21:35] pointing to the faith. And this message
[1:21:37] came to restore us to the original
[1:21:39] faith. And I just love what brother
[1:21:41] Random says here in restoration of the
[1:21:42] bride. He said to restore, it means to
[1:21:45] bring back.
[1:21:46] Now, it's not to purchase, it means to
[1:21:48] bring back. to restore. The prophet
[1:21:51] said, he said, "A claim can be enforced.
[1:21:53] When you're restoring something, you're
[1:21:55] bringing it back to its rightful owner
[1:21:58] where it belongs." So when God restores
[1:22:01] the individual, it is not God paying for
[1:22:04] your salvation. It is not God saving you
[1:22:07] all over again. It is God restoring you
[1:22:09] back to what he called you to be. Amen.
[1:22:12] Restoration is different, amen, from God
[1:22:15] saving you and God giving to you the
[1:22:17] Holy Ghost. Restoration is bringing you
[1:22:20] back from where you fell from. Amen. And
[1:22:23] that's what we need, brother, is to be
[1:22:26] restored back. How many remembers David
[1:22:28] in the Psalms? He said, "Lord, restore
[1:22:30] unto me the joy of my salvation." Amen.
[1:22:34] He never lost his salvation. Amen. But
[1:22:37] he lost the joy in coming to church. He
[1:22:40] lost the fun, if you'll give me some
[1:22:42] grace. He lost the fun in worshiping
[1:22:44] God. And he lost the joy in worshiping
[1:22:47] God. And he said, "Lord, restore unto me
[1:22:50] the joy of my salvation." Amen. I pity
[1:22:54] the people that they worship God. And I
[1:22:56] tell you, you know, it's a gloomy thing.
[1:22:58] And
[1:23:00] oh Lord, praise God. No joy and no
[1:23:04] victory and no joy. Amen. Listen,
[1:23:07] brother, sister. Amen. They came to
[1:23:09] Jesus and said, "Jesus, tell them folks
[1:23:11] to quieten down there. Tell them folks
[1:23:13] to stop their worship." He said, "If
[1:23:16] they don't worship the son of David, if
[1:23:18] they don't worship me and lift me on
[1:23:21] high and them rocks over there will cry
[1:23:24] out, I say, Lord, restore to the
[1:23:26] church." Amen. The joy of their
[1:23:29] salvation and the victory of their
[1:23:31] salvation. Hey, I tell you, there ought
[1:23:33] to be joy in the house of God. Amen.
[1:23:35] Used to be it wasn't normal to sit there
[1:23:38] and be all gloomy and depressed and our
[1:23:41] arms is folded and we're dead and we're
[1:23:43] Amen. used to be that wasn't a normal
[1:23:45] thing. Amen. To come into a church and
[1:23:47] think it was a funeral service. Amen.
[1:23:50] But somehow we get in our mind that
[1:23:51] that's normal. That is not normal
[1:23:54] according to the word of God. I tell you
[1:23:56] what's normal. Amen. Shout aloud,
[1:23:58] daughters of Zion, and lift up your
[1:24:01] voice as of that of a trumpet. You want
[1:24:03] something normal? Amen. Worship in the
[1:24:06] house of God. It ought to be a everyday
[1:24:08] thing.
[1:24:11] That's what I've been brought back to.
[1:24:13] It ain't emotionalism. It ain't working
[1:24:16] people up. I tell you what it is. We are
[1:24:18] worked up, but it's by the word. How
[1:24:20] many of y'all hear music pumping right
[1:24:22] now? There ain't a lick of it. What's
[1:24:23] the bride stimulated by? She is
[1:24:26] stimulated by the word of almighty God.
[1:24:29] Let me tell you something. Amen. This
[1:24:31] word will lift you up when you're as
[1:24:34] down as down can be. His word's got the
[1:24:37] power, amen, to lift you up out of the
[1:24:39] condition you're in. Hallelujah to God.
[1:24:43] His word has got a power, amen, to lift
[1:24:45] you back and restore you back to your
[1:24:48] feet.
[1:24:49] And that's what David said. David knew
[1:24:52] he wasn't lost, but he lost the joy of
[1:24:54] serving God. I ain't telling you you're
[1:24:56] lost, but I tell you, you ought to have
[1:24:58] joy in serving God. Amen. Used to be,
[1:25:01] brother, sister, we were so happy to
[1:25:03] come to church. I just can't wait. And
[1:25:06] the Bible said if you've got the Holy
[1:25:08] Ghost, uh oh, if you've got the Holy
[1:25:10] Ghost, you can't wait for them church
[1:25:12] doors to get open.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I don't you know that wasn't inspired by
[1:25:17] the Psalm. And you that was before 1963.
[1:25:21] I'm sorry. Amen. But I believe what the
[1:25:23] prophet said. If you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:26] you can't wait. See, it's because my
[1:25:29] heart's been turned back. And I ain't
[1:25:31] here because of you. And I ain't here
[1:25:32] because of him. But I'm here because of
[1:25:35] him. Amen. And I didn't come to see you.
[1:25:38] And I didn't come to see him. But I came
[1:25:40] to see him. And that's the problem. If
[1:25:43] you're coming here just to be seen, and
[1:25:45] you ought to stay home. If you was
[1:25:47] coming here, Amen, just to see what
[1:25:49] would happen and you ought to just
[1:25:51] stayed home. But if you was coming here,
[1:25:53] amen, to see the God of this Bible, I
[1:25:56] say, God bless your soul. Amen. Blessed
[1:25:59] are you that hunger and thirst after
[1:26:02] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's the promises of God.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Restore us back. Bring us back to our
[1:26:13] rightful owner. See, I tell you what it
[1:26:15] was. That we was in the devil's pawn
[1:26:17] shop, but we was not his.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; We was in the devil's pawn shop, and he
[1:26:21] had a pawn tag on you and I, but we
[1:26:24] never belonged to the devil in the first
[1:26:26] place. Can I say it this way? You was
[1:26:29] always a daughter of God. This message
[1:26:31] did not make you a son of God. This
[1:26:34] message did not make you a daughter of
[1:26:35] God. But what it did was break the
[1:26:38] scales off your eyes and gave you the
[1:26:40] revelation that you are a son of God.
[1:26:44] And you are a daughter of God. Amen.
[1:26:46] Listen, I tell you what it did. It
[1:26:47] restored to you your proper identity.
[1:26:50] Amen. That we are right now the sons and
[1:26:53] daughters of God.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has restored us back to
[1:26:58] it. See, amen. We was born a son and
[1:27:00] daughter of God. You believe that? Amen.
[1:27:02] The prophet's clear on it. He said, "You
[1:27:03] come to the altar, you didn't become a
[1:27:05] son when you came to the altar." Amen.
[1:27:07] Listen to me, young man. You always was
[1:27:09] a son of God. Amen. You didn't become a
[1:27:12] son, but you was born a son. It don't
[1:27:15] matter if you make a mistake or you
[1:27:17] backslid. You're still a son. All you
[1:27:20] need to do is be restored back to your
[1:27:23] rightful place. Amen. You may fall down,
[1:27:26] but that's the whole point of
[1:27:27] restoration because you get restored
[1:27:30] back to your rightful place.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Amen. How many thanks
[1:27:40] God for restoration?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know according to the
[1:27:44] scripture, you see the prodical son. I
[1:27:46] think it's a perfect illustration
[1:27:47] because Amen. He was born a son. I just
[1:27:50] love how the Bible puts it because he
[1:27:52] was there in that pig pin. brother and
[1:27:54] sister. And the Bible records that he
[1:27:56] came to himself. Now, can I ask you a
[1:27:58] question? When he was in the pig pin,
[1:28:00] was he still a son?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; When he was in the pig pin, was he still
[1:28:04] a son or because he fell down, did it
[1:28:08] change him and he was no longer a son?
[1:28:10] No, sir. When he was in the pig pin and
[1:28:13] he was living a riotous life, he still
[1:28:16] had an identity because he came from his
[1:28:19] father and he was the seed of his
[1:28:22] father. And it didn't matter where he
[1:28:25] went. His seed remained in him. And the
[1:28:28] Bible says, "Blessed is the man who God
[1:28:30] will not impute sin to because his seed
[1:28:34] remainth in him." Amen. While you was
[1:28:36] running from God, you were still a son.
[1:28:39] And while you was making mistakes and
[1:28:40] living in sin, you was still a son and
[1:28:43] daughter of God. You just needed to be
[1:28:45] restored to your rightful place. I thank
[1:28:49] God for his grace and mercy that he
[1:28:51] restored us back to our rightful place
[1:28:54] as sons and daughters of God.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; See, we need a realization
[1:29:01] and the end restoration. I I just love
[1:29:03] that. Amen. The prophet would talk about
[1:29:05] different versions of the Bible, but I
[1:29:06] was just reading along here in Joel the
[1:29:08] second chapter, our text that we read in
[1:29:10] the Amplified Bible would read it this
[1:29:12] way. I will compensate you. Ain't that
[1:29:14] beautiful? I will compensate you for the
[1:29:17] years that swarming locust has seen
[1:29:19] other other Greeks and translations
[1:29:21] would say I will repay you. I will give
[1:29:24] you back what you lost. I will make up
[1:29:27] to you the years that you lost. You
[1:29:29] know, I just got to worshiping God on
[1:29:31] that scripture and I got to thinking of
[1:29:33] Job there in the scripture. Amen. And
[1:29:35] the devil came up to God and God said,
[1:29:37] "Have you consider have you considered
[1:29:39] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle in West
[1:29:41] Palm? Have you considered my servant
[1:29:43] down there in Aoski North? Have you have
[1:29:45] you considered them?" Oh, yeah. I
[1:29:47] consider them, but you put a hedge round
[1:29:49] about them. You put a hedge around them
[1:29:52] and I can't get to them. And God said,
[1:29:54] you you you you can go down there and do
[1:29:56] what you want to. And then the devil
[1:29:58] began having a conversation up in heaven
[1:30:00] talking to God. He said, listen, the
[1:30:02] only reason that Job is serving you is
[1:30:05] because everything's going good and all
[1:30:08] of his bills are paid. Hello. And he's
[1:30:10] got money in the bank and his family's
[1:30:12] in church and you know, revival fires
[1:30:15] are burning. The only reason he's
[1:30:17] worshiping you is because he's got
[1:30:20] everything made. He's got everything
[1:30:23] made. But you let me put my hand on that
[1:30:25] woman and you let me put my hand on that
[1:30:27] man and I'll make him curse you to your
[1:30:30] face. And God said, "Job, go or or a
[1:30:32] devil, go ahead." And what began to
[1:30:35] happen? He went down and and Job's
[1:30:37] children got killed and his livestock
[1:30:39] got burned up and his house fell down on
[1:30:41] in them. And all of this terrible,
[1:30:44] terrible things begin to happen. Amen.
[1:30:46] And Job is now sitting here on an ash
[1:30:48] heap. And he had lost everything. And
[1:30:50] the devil said, "I'm going to stop him
[1:30:52] from worshiping God. I'm going to stop
[1:30:54] him from praising God. I'm going to stop
[1:30:56] his servitude unto God." And that was
[1:30:59] the devil's objective was to make Job
[1:31:02] curse God to his face. And I tell you
[1:31:04] what, Job sat there on that ash sheep
[1:31:06] and was scraping his balls there and he
[1:31:09] looked up into the heavens and said, "I
[1:31:12] know my redeemer lives." He said,
[1:31:15] "Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[1:31:17] gave to me and you take away, but
[1:31:20] blessed be your name." And then God
[1:31:23] said, "Listen, Job, I'm going to repay
[1:31:26] you for everything that the devil took
[1:31:29] away." Amen. Listen, the devil tried to
[1:31:31] stop your praise and the devil tried to
[1:31:34] stop your worship and the devil tried to
[1:31:36] take your victory and he took and he
[1:31:38] took and he took and we stand here
[1:31:41] today. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:44] You give and you take away. And then God
[1:31:46] says, Job, Job, I will restore. And he
[1:31:50] got double the money and he got double
[1:31:52] the blessings and he got double the
[1:31:54] rest. Hey, listen. If God takes
[1:31:57] something away from you, he'll give you
[1:31:59] something back better than you ever had.
[1:32:02] If you're willing to let it go, amen,
[1:32:04] God will bless you in the overflow. Hey,
[1:32:07] the Bible says, "I can do exceedingly
[1:32:10] abundantly above all you can ask or
[1:32:13] say." Amen. We serve a God of miracles.
[1:32:16] Amen. A God of restoration.
[1:32:21] Well, shout aloud this morning.
[1:32:24] Y'all know it's the truth. Amen. Look
[1:32:27] there in the scripture and the devil
[1:32:28] says they they just worship you because
[1:32:30] they got it good and they're blessed and
[1:32:32] the church is blessed and the church got
[1:32:34] no problems. But let me go down there
[1:32:36] for a minute and I'll kill that church.
[1:32:39] Remember there, amen, in the scripture
[1:32:41] when the Syrian army was they were
[1:32:44] taunting the children of Israel and
[1:32:45] said, "Listen, the only reason Israel's
[1:32:47] winning is because they're on the
[1:32:49] mountaintop." Y it's the Bible. The only
[1:32:52] reason Israel's winning is because
[1:32:55] they're on the mountaintop and they've
[1:32:57] got an advantage over us. Hallelujah to
[1:33:00] God. They've got an advantage. But you
[1:33:02] put them down in the valley and we will
[1:33:05] surely destroy them. And then the Bible
[1:33:08] says there was a man of God that came
[1:33:10] out on the seventh day. Hallelujah.
[1:33:14] There was a man that came out on the
[1:33:15] seventh day and he said, "Because you
[1:33:18] made this boast, I will show you that he
[1:33:21] is not only the God of the mountain, but
[1:33:23] he is also the God of the valley." And
[1:33:25] the Bible says that the children of
[1:33:28] Israel, Amen, slew a 100,000 Syrians. It
[1:33:33] wasn't just a victory. It was a great
[1:33:36] victory. It wasn't just a little
[1:33:37] victory. It was a great victory. And
[1:33:40] because the devil's made fun of you and
[1:33:42] the devil's taunted you and says she's
[1:33:44] only God on a mountain. Amen. Watch my
[1:33:47] God. He'll show up in the midst of your
[1:33:50] valley. He'll show up in the midst of
[1:33:52] your tribulation. Hey,
[1:33:56] he's God on my mountain. He's God on my
[1:33:59] way down. And he's God in the valley.
[1:34:06] Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] I'll restore it. I'll give it all back.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; What a God we serve. I'll give it all
[1:34:16] back. I'll restore everything back. I
[1:34:19] tell you what, Amen. The devil's all the
[1:34:21] time tempting God and tempting his
[1:34:23] children. Well, the reason why you
[1:34:25] worship and the re listen, we don't
[1:34:26] praise God out of our surroundings. We
[1:34:30] praise God according to the word. It was
[1:34:32] the Pentecostal realm. The only time
[1:34:35] they could worship was when they had
[1:34:37] music playing and they had their
[1:34:39] emotions worked up. Amen. That's not
[1:34:41] what this is, brother, sister. Amen. It
[1:34:43] is according to the word. Amen. Listen,
[1:34:47] we don't praise God and worship God
[1:34:49] because of our surroundings.
[1:34:52] We worship and praise God according to
[1:34:55] the word. Amen. People come along and
[1:34:57] say, "Father Solomon, you know, you see
[1:34:58] all these things happening and the
[1:35:00] prophecies being fulfilled. Ain't it
[1:35:02] just an exciting time and we got an
[1:35:04] American pope and we got this and we got
[1:35:06] that and I think yeah that's pretty
[1:35:09] good. That's wonderful. But I believed
[1:35:12] it just when I saw the prophet said it.
[1:35:15] Amen. I didn't have to see it, brother
[1:35:18] Larry, to believe it was going to happen
[1:35:20] because I knew God said it. And I was
[1:35:23] worshiping back when I saw the prophecy.
[1:35:27] Hallelujah. I said I was worshiping back
[1:35:30] when I saw the prophecy even if I didn't
[1:35:33] see the fulfillment of it. I saw the
[1:35:36] prophecy and to the bride prophecy is as
[1:35:40] good as fulfillment. See, that's your
[1:35:43] problem. You're waiting for it to get
[1:35:44] good to praise God and you won't ever
[1:35:46] worship God. You're waiting for the
[1:35:48] blessing to come and you won't ever
[1:35:50] praise God and worship God until you see
[1:35:53] the fulfillment. But how about you stop
[1:35:55] letting your problems, Amen, dictate
[1:35:58] your worship, and you're letting your
[1:35:59] surroundings dictate your worship when
[1:36:02] nobody else is saying, "Amen. Who cares
[1:36:04] what anybody else Well, nobody else is
[1:36:06] entering in. Who cares what anybody else
[1:36:08] does?" Amen. This ain't you and the
[1:36:10] church and God. Amen. This is you and
[1:36:13] God alone.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] It's the truth. That's exactly right.
[1:36:23] I think it's time, church. We've been
[1:36:25] restored back to true Bible worship. I I
[1:36:28] just love Paul and Silas in the Bible.
[1:36:29] This is people with excuses. You know,
[1:36:32] we get a flat tire. Well, you know, I
[1:36:34] guess God don't love me no more. We get
[1:36:36] some issues. Well, I guess God don't
[1:36:38] care about me no more. Paul and Silas
[1:36:40] was in a jail cell.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; And there was folks that had a reason
[1:36:44] not to worship God and not to serve God.
[1:36:48] It would have been them two men that was
[1:36:50] in prison for preaching the word. But
[1:36:52] you know what? They didn't let their
[1:36:53] surroundings, Amen, control them. In
[1:36:56] other words, they was in the middle of a
[1:36:58] flood. But the only way the boat goes
[1:37:01] down is if the water gets in the boat.
[1:37:04] And that's the problem. Amen. Listen,
[1:37:06] the water can't hurt you. But when the
[1:37:09] water gets in the boat, Amen, that water
[1:37:11] will drown you. And that's the problem.
[1:37:14] You're letting water get in your boat.
[1:37:17] Is that okay?
[1:37:19] You're letting water get into your boat.
[1:37:22] When that water was made to I just love
[1:37:24] the teaching of the prophet. He said
[1:37:26] that same water underneath the
[1:37:28] Andaluvian destruction. He said it was
[1:37:30] judgment and it was condemnation to the
[1:37:33] world. He said, "But to Noah,
[1:37:35] hallelujah, but to Noah and the people
[1:37:38] that was in the ark, it was not
[1:37:40] condemnation. It was their deliverance
[1:37:43] and it was their victory." Amen. The
[1:37:45] same water that kills your enemy and
[1:37:48] that kills the one beside you is the
[1:37:50] same water that carries you above the
[1:37:53] tribulation. Amen. You thought that
[1:37:55] water would kill you, but that water was
[1:37:57] sent to carry you.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; But keep it out of the boat.
[1:38:04] Keep it out of the boat. See, that's the
[1:38:06] problem. You let you let the water get
[1:38:07] in the boat and the boat goes down
[1:38:08] quick. And that's what I I got to move
[1:38:12] on. God help me. Let's get back to the
[1:38:15] scripture here. And Joel, uh, I never
[1:38:17] really went back that scripture prior in
[1:38:19] Joel the second chapter. And I wanted to
[1:38:20] get a better background according to the
[1:38:22] Bible. What was the Bible really saying
[1:38:24] when God said, "I'll restore unto you
[1:38:26] the years." And I just began to take a
[1:38:28] good Bible study. And I tell you, Amen.
[1:38:30] You find this very crucial when you find
[1:38:32] a good truth in the Bible, go and read
[1:38:34] that chapter before and then go and read
[1:38:37] that chapter after. And look at look at
[1:38:40] the the meaning of the word. Look at
[1:38:41] what the Bible's trying to say. And see,
[1:38:44] that's a lot of issues that we get is
[1:38:46] that we'll isolate one little thing and
[1:38:48] we make us say something totally
[1:38:50] different. We isolate one scripture. You
[1:38:53] realize you can take the Bible and make
[1:38:54] it say there is no God.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there is no God beside
[1:38:58] me. If you isolate there is no God for
[1:39:01] you know what this Bible says there
[1:39:03] ain't no God. That's the danger of you
[1:39:05] isolating the word. That's why you go
[1:39:08] back a little and go forward a little
[1:39:11] and say, "Oh, okay. There is no God
[1:39:14] beside me. Not there is no God.
[1:39:17] That's free. You can take that and do
[1:39:19] what you want with it. In Joel 1 and 13,
[1:39:22] the Bible, I think it's powerful. You're
[1:39:25] you're reading here in this scripture
[1:39:26] and you read about a horrible locust
[1:39:28] invasion. The Bible says the vines had
[1:39:30] dried up and the crops had been
[1:39:31] destroyed and it was a horrible sight.
[1:39:34] And then you find in Joel 1:13, you you
[1:39:37] find a call to repentance. I thought, my
[1:39:39] God, what is this in this? You you you
[1:39:41] find a call to repentance. And the Bible
[1:39:43] says, "Gird yourselves and lament, ye
[1:39:45] priests. How ye ministers of the altar,
[1:39:47] come and lie all night in sackcloth, ye
[1:39:50] ministers of my God. For the meat
[1:39:52] offering and the drink offering is
[1:39:53] withholdened from the house of God, and
[1:39:56] sanctify ye a fast, and call a solemn
[1:39:58] assembly, and gather the elders, and all
[1:40:00] the inhabitants of the land into the
[1:40:03] house of the Lord your God, and cry unto
[1:40:05] the Lord." And I begin reading now. I
[1:40:07] thought my whatever condition they got
[1:40:09] into, they needed to repent their way
[1:40:12] out of it. How many still believes in
[1:40:15] repentance? Probably said, I got to do
[1:40:17] it daily. You find God telling them,
[1:40:19] "Come and repent. Cry loud, ye priests,
[1:40:23] how ye ministers." And I thought, "My
[1:40:25] God, there it is. God is telling them,
[1:40:28] listen, look, look at what you got on
[1:40:30] your hand. Your crops are dead and all
[1:40:32] these things are destroyed." And then
[1:40:34] God tells them to repent. God says, cry
[1:40:37] out. But then you read just a chapter
[1:40:40] after this, after their repentance and
[1:40:43] after they make things right in Joel
[1:40:45] 2:25, then God tells them, "I'll restore
[1:40:49] to you the years that the locust hath
[1:40:52] eaten." And I thought, "My God, there it
[1:40:54] is. True restoration happens after
[1:40:57] repentance happens." And you can't mix
[1:41:00] the two up together. And I I thought
[1:41:02] about there it is beautifully because we
[1:41:05] want God to bless us while we're in sin.
[1:41:07] And we want God to move on us while
[1:41:10] we're still Jacob. Amen. But Jacob could
[1:41:12] not get blessed until Jacob was turned
[1:41:15] into Israel. Is that the truth? And
[1:41:19] everybody wants to bless him without the
[1:41:21] separation. And everybody wants to be
[1:41:24] Abraham, but they don't want to sojourn.
[1:41:27] Amen. And separate. And the prophet
[1:41:29] preached a message on it. He said,
[1:41:30] "God's word calls for a total separation
[1:41:34] of all unbelief."
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; And I began studying this. I thought,
[1:41:38] "My, when you repent, you're literally
[1:41:41] releasing yourself to the blessings of
[1:41:43] God." When you separate from your sin,
[1:41:46] you are a candidate of restoration. And
[1:41:49] I thought, my, how can God restore us to
[1:41:52] the position he's called us to if we're
[1:41:54] still holding on to Egypt? Amen. See,
[1:41:57] you can never go into the land of Canaan
[1:42:00] while holding on to Egypt. But if you'll
[1:42:03] ever get brave enough to let go of
[1:42:06] Egypt, then God can take you in to the
[1:42:09] land of Canaan. Amen. And see, we can
[1:42:11] preach about the blessings of God and
[1:42:13] talk about it. But you don't find the
[1:42:16] blessing until you find the separation.
[1:42:18] Amen. See, it's when he separated that
[1:42:21] God restored life to Abraham and
[1:42:24] restored life to Sarah. It was after the
[1:42:27] separation, then you got the blessing.
[1:42:31] And see, if there would have been no
[1:42:32] separation, there would have been no
[1:42:34] fulfillment of the promise to Abraham.
[1:42:36] If there would have been no separation,
[1:42:38] there would have been no promise sign.
[1:42:40] And see, that's why you have to be
[1:42:42] careful when you look at this one and
[1:42:44] you look at this one and oh, he's so
[1:42:47] blessed and she's so blessed. But you
[1:42:49] don't know what it took to get there.
[1:42:51] You don't know the trials and the
[1:42:53] tribulations and the fighting and and
[1:42:56] you look at that man and you say, "My,
[1:42:58] he's so blessed." You wouldn't want to
[1:43:00] go through what I had to go through. You
[1:43:02] wouldn't want to go through what she had
[1:43:03] to go through. Amen. Listen, for Joseph
[1:43:06] to be on the right hand of Pharaoh, he
[1:43:09] had to go to prison. Amen. He had to be
[1:43:11] a slave. Now, how many of y'all want to
[1:43:13] go to prison and be a slave for years
[1:43:15] and years and years? I mean, I don't
[1:43:17] want to do that. But see, that was
[1:43:18] necessary for Joseph. Before he could be
[1:43:22] exalted, he first had to be humiliated.
[1:43:25] And let me tell you this, you may be in
[1:43:27] the worst trial of your life and you
[1:43:29] feel like you're in the prison and
[1:43:31] you're humiliated. Let me tell you,
[1:43:34] amen. Maybe it's just you're on your
[1:43:36] way, amen, to victory. And you're on
[1:43:39] your way, amen, to the right hand of
[1:43:41] Pharaoh.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can talk about the great feats
[1:43:46] of Noah, but we don't talk about the
[1:43:48] hundred years he preached the same
[1:43:49] sermon with the same title.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Same sermon. Sometimes we preach the
[1:43:56] same sermon, different title. My wife
[1:43:58] kissed me all the time. She said, "I
[1:43:59] heard that one before. You use a
[1:44:00] different title, didn't you?" I said,
[1:44:01] "You got me."
[1:44:04] Same sermon, different title. Still the
[1:44:07] word of God.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Noah's there preaching for 120 years
[1:44:11] looking like a crazy man. We talk about,
[1:44:13] oh, how awesome it was to see him on
[1:44:15] that ark and all the blessings of God,
[1:44:17] but he preached the same sermon for 120
[1:44:19] years. So, you'll find that it's linked
[1:44:21] together. You find there's a separation,
[1:44:23] then there's a blessing. There's a
[1:44:24] separation, then there's a blessing.
[1:44:26] Amen. There's repentance, then there's
[1:44:28] restoration. And it ties perfectly into
[1:44:30] the Bible. You read in Gabriel's
[1:44:32] instruction to Daniel, the prophet talks
[1:44:34] about Israel. He said God never did deal
[1:44:36] with Israel. Listen, until she came back
[1:44:39] to her homeland. And the Bible said,
[1:44:42] "Hear me." Thus sayaeth the Lord, God
[1:44:45] will not deal with his church until she
[1:44:48] comes back to the homeland. The message
[1:44:51] of the hour. And the prophet says,
[1:44:53] screams it out. Amen. Come back to the
[1:44:56] original. So you see in the word after
[1:44:59] repentance is the restoration.
[1:45:02] And I think it's beautiful because we we
[1:45:04] don't know the condition the children of
[1:45:05] Israel got in, but whatever it was, they
[1:45:07] needed to repent. And ain't it something
[1:45:09] that immediately after repentance, God
[1:45:12] said, "I'm not going to hold you
[1:45:13] accountable. I'm not going to worry
[1:45:14] about what you did. I'm not going to
[1:45:16] even think twice about it. I'm just
[1:45:18] going to restore to you everything you
[1:45:21] lost." I think it's beautiful to realize
[1:45:23] that because after you have repented of
[1:45:25] something in the eyes of God, there is
[1:45:28] therefore now no condemnation
[1:45:31] to them that are in Christ. Ain't it
[1:45:33] amazing that in one verse of scripture,
[1:45:36] God is saying to repent and to cry out.
[1:45:39] And then in the next chapter, God makes
[1:45:42] an outstanding promise. I will restore
[1:45:45] unto you all the years that you lost
[1:45:48] while you was living in sin. I say we
[1:45:51] ought to repent and then we ought to
[1:45:53] come and receive the blessings of God.
[1:45:55] Amen. And I love what the Bible says.
[1:45:57] The Bible says, "I will restore. Not I
[1:46:00] might, not I'll think about it, not as
[1:46:02] possible. But when you repent and come
[1:46:05] back to your homeland, the message of
[1:46:07] the hour, God says, I will do this. If
[1:46:11] you'll come back to the word, and that's
[1:46:13] where the revival is, brother, sister.
[1:46:16] If you want revival in your church, then
[1:46:18] come back to the word. It is the word
[1:46:21] born revival.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, that's the problem. We
[1:46:27] think, well, you know, I'm not worthy
[1:46:28] for restoration. I'm not worthy to come
[1:46:30] back. And you know, some people act like
[1:46:31] they're Catholics.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I got to pay for my sin. I got to pay I
[1:46:36] got to pay penance. I can't just move on
[1:46:39] that easy. Why not?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I can't move on. My back's sleep. I just
[1:46:43] can't breathe. Why can't you move on
[1:46:45] from it? If God himself could move on,
[1:46:49] hallelujah. I said, if Jesus himself
[1:46:53] could move on from your sin and your
[1:46:56] mistake and your backslide, then why in
[1:46:58] the world, Amen, can you not forgive
[1:47:01] yourself and move on from what you did?
[1:47:05] Hey, listen. You can't change what's in
[1:47:07] the past. And that's what the Bible
[1:47:09] says. forgetting those things which are
[1:47:12] behind me and I press. You can't change
[1:47:16] what you did, but you can change what
[1:47:18] you do now. I say, let's go into the
[1:47:21] promises of God and move on. If Jesus
[1:47:24] could forgive you, I think you ought to
[1:47:26] be able to forgive you, too. And I I
[1:47:27] think it's beautiful to realize God
[1:47:29] said, "I restore it unto you." And let
[1:47:31] me tell you, there is no condition. It
[1:47:33] don't matter how bad it is. It don't
[1:47:35] matter how horrible it is. Amen. God
[1:47:38] made a promise that I will restore it.
[1:47:41] You say, "Where are we going back to,
[1:47:42] brother Solomon? We're not even just
[1:47:44] going back to the day of Pentecost. I've
[1:47:45] just got to forget the notes and run out
[1:47:47] of time and preach all day." Amen. But
[1:47:48] look, the bride, when does it start?
[1:47:50] Started at Acts, the second chapter.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But look at God's first
[1:47:55] masterpiece. I just got to preach these
[1:47:57] things to you. The prophet preached a
[1:47:59] whole message called the masterpiece.
[1:48:00] And he said God had his masterpiece
[1:48:03] family in the Garden of Eden. He said it
[1:48:05] was beautiful. There was love, there was
[1:48:08] equality, there was dominion, there was
[1:48:10] power, there was anointing, there was
[1:48:12] all of these things. And the prophet
[1:48:13] said that was God's first perfect
[1:48:16] masterpiece. And he said the devil came
[1:48:18] in and he marred that masterpiece. And
[1:48:21] and the prophet said that masterpiece
[1:48:24] fell to the ground. And he said that
[1:48:26] masterpiece, her face was laying down.
[1:48:29] And brother Ram said that God was a just
[1:48:31] God. Is that right? And he had to keep
[1:48:34] his word. And brother Ram said that he
[1:48:36] saw them going out of the garden of Eden
[1:48:38] and he could not refrain himself and he
[1:48:41] could not help himself. I just love the
[1:48:43] way the prophet said. He said, "I saw a
[1:48:45] funnel come down." He said, "And a
[1:48:48] spelled L O V E coming down in the
[1:48:50] Garden of the Eden." And then God
[1:48:52] prophesied and he said, "Listen, I'll
[1:48:55] not leave it this way. I'll not leave my
[1:48:58] masterpiece with their face on the
[1:49:00] ground." And then God made a prophecy.
[1:49:02] He said, "I'll put enmity between thy
[1:49:06] seed and the woman's seed." Is that
[1:49:08] right? The woman don't have a seed.
[1:49:11] Where did she get it? She got it from
[1:49:13] God and got it from the conception of
[1:49:15] the Holy Ghost. And then what was it? It
[1:49:17] was God prophesying of Messiah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to restore. I'm going to put
[1:49:23] immity. There's going to be a Messiah.
[1:49:25] And God prophesied. And then 2,000 some
[1:49:28] years later, Messiah is on the earth.
[1:49:31] Amen. And that's paying the price of
[1:49:33] sin, right? That's paying the debt that
[1:49:35] is owed. That is being the lamb. That's
[1:49:38] being the kinsman redeemer. That is
[1:49:40] everything in the scripture. Him
[1:49:41] fulfilling it. But it was not total
[1:49:44] restoration when he died on Calvary. It
[1:49:47] was redemption. Sure, it was salvation.
[1:49:49] It was healing, but it was not yet total
[1:49:52] restoration. Amen. And then some days
[1:49:55] later after his crucifixion, the Holy
[1:49:57] Ghost comes down in Acts the second
[1:49:59] chapter and it fills every vessel. But
[1:50:02] that was not total restoration as of
[1:50:04] yet. Amen. It was the potentials of
[1:50:07] everything, but it was not complete
[1:50:09] restoration yet. And then you find the
[1:50:12] prophet said that was the start of the
[1:50:13] bride tree and that was the church in
[1:50:16] infancy.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? Are you with me? And
[1:50:19] the tree begins to grow up. Amen. And
[1:50:21] Paul begins preaching the unadulterated
[1:50:24] word. And brother Ram said after Paul
[1:50:26] died, it was a short number of years.
[1:50:28] The church went into apostasy and they
[1:50:31] begin to abandon the the the teachings
[1:50:34] of Paul. It was complete abandonment.
[1:50:36] They just left the teachings of Paul.
[1:50:38] But there was a word hovering on the
[1:50:40] earth, but I will restore everything
[1:50:43] that is broken down. And the prophet
[1:50:45] said, "And then here come Lucer." He
[1:50:48] said, "And begin the tree begin to come
[1:50:49] up and then denominated. And then that
[1:50:52] Lutheran worm begin to eat the tree back
[1:50:54] down and kill it back down. And here it
[1:50:56] come up again. And then it ate the tree
[1:50:59] down and kill it back down. But see, in
[1:51:01] the evening time, brother, amen, there
[1:51:04] was a prophecy. In the evening time, it
[1:51:06] shall be light. And brother showed you
[1:51:08] so powerful. He said, "Look at that
[1:51:10] tree. It started to grow." He said, "And
[1:51:13] it was the churches.
[1:51:15] It was the churches that began to kill
[1:51:17] down that tree." I mean, let me tell you
[1:51:19] this, brother, sister. It's the church
[1:51:21] world. That was Amen. That Lutheran
[1:51:23] worm. Amen. And the caterpillar and the
[1:51:26] cankrine worm. Amen. The prophet said
[1:51:28] that was denominational systems. Amen.
[1:51:31] That was tearing down the bride tree and
[1:51:34] was cutting her down. And the prophet
[1:51:36] said that that that that tree got ate
[1:51:38] all the way down to the roots. Now, I
[1:51:40] tell you what, I want to preach on this
[1:51:42] for a moment. He said that tree got ate
[1:51:44] all the way down to the roots. He said,
[1:51:46] "But in them roots, them roots was a
[1:51:49] predestinated root. And God
[1:51:52] predestinated them roots." He said, "And
[1:51:54] it was only roots that was left." And
[1:51:56] the prophet screamed, "Now, but I will
[1:51:59] restore, sayeth the Lord." I thought,
[1:52:02] "My, it was ate all the way down to the
[1:52:04] root." But yet God says, "I'll restore
[1:52:07] this bride tree again." And he preached
[1:52:10] a masterpiece and called it the
[1:52:12] restoration of the bride tree. He said,
[1:52:15] "What the Lutheran ate off and what the
[1:52:17] Methodists ate off and what the
[1:52:18] Pentecostals ate off." He said, "What
[1:52:20] they do?" The Amen. The Methodists came
[1:52:22] off and and the Lutherans came off and
[1:52:24] ate the leaves off.
[1:52:26] He said ate the fruit off the tree.
[1:52:28] Fruits of the spirit. He said, "Eate the
[1:52:30] bark off." He said that was the woman's
[1:52:31] clothes. Is that right? Begin to eat the
[1:52:34] bark off her tree and said, "Mon modesty
[1:52:35] don't matter anymore." And brother Ram
[1:52:37] said that was the destruction of the
[1:52:39] bride tree. And all these church bugs
[1:52:42] came together. Amen. I think ain't it a
[1:52:44] shame that it was these churches that
[1:52:46] took worship out of the church and took
[1:52:48] the gifts out of the church and took the
[1:52:50] Holy Ghost out of the church and that's
[1:52:52] why to the Leodysian church age the
[1:52:55] Bible says Christ was on the outside of
[1:52:57] the door and he was knocking trying to
[1:53:00] get in because the church put them out
[1:53:03] and the prophet said but them roots he
[1:53:05] said was predestinated roots and there
[1:53:08] was a prophecy on the roots that I'll
[1:53:11] restore and I will bring her back again.
[1:53:14] And let me tell you this. Amen. I as I'm
[1:53:17] giving you my title, restoration no
[1:53:19] matter condition. You may be here today
[1:53:22] and you may feel like you've been broken
[1:53:23] down and you've been beat down and
[1:53:26] you've been tore down and all you've got
[1:53:28] left is the root. Let me tell you, you
[1:53:30] are a predestinated
[1:53:32] root and all God needs is the roots and
[1:53:35] he'll start rebuilding you and
[1:53:37] rebuilding you. He will fulfill his word
[1:53:41] no matter the condition that you are in.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. My mind comes back to Ezekiel
[1:53:49] there. Y'all know the scripture.
[1:53:51] Ezekiel's there in the Old Testament.
[1:53:52] God comes to him says, "Son of man, look
[1:53:55] at this valley of dry bones in here."
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:59] Look at these dry bones. And Ezekiel
[1:54:01] said, "And I beheld and they was very
[1:54:04] dry." Not dry, very dry. And then God
[1:54:07] said, "Can can this tree live again?" Oh
[1:54:10] God, can this tree live again? Can this
[1:54:13] army be restored? Can this bride tree
[1:54:16] live again? And then Ezekiel the prophet
[1:54:19] turned up to God and said, "God, thou
[1:54:21] knowest. Thou knowest if they can live
[1:54:24] again or not." And then God responded to
[1:54:26] the prophet on earth. It's God in
[1:54:28] heaven. It's the prophet on earth. It
[1:54:30] was the mighty angel in heaven. while
[1:54:32] the seventh angel was upon the earth at
[1:54:35] the time of the descent of the mighty
[1:54:37] angel and he asked Ezekiel and said can
[1:54:40] they live again and he said you know
[1:54:42] Lord he said so I said prophesy son of
[1:54:46] man
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; what's prophesy means to preach prophesy
[1:54:52] son of man and I just love Ezekiel he
[1:54:54] said so I said amen valley of dry bones
[1:54:58] hear ye the word of the lord and live
[1:55:02] began and the prophet said and the Bible
[1:55:04] records it so beautifully. He said bone
[1:55:07] came on bone and senue came on senue.
[1:55:10] What was restoring the dry bones? It was
[1:55:13] the word of the prophet's message.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; I said it was the word of the prophet's
[1:55:20] message and bone came back to bone and
[1:55:22] sin. You came back to senue and let me
[1:55:25] tell you brother sister it don't matter
[1:55:27] the condition of the church. There is
[1:55:29] going to be a bride. She will be without
[1:55:31] spot, without wrinkle, without blemish.
[1:55:33] She can do the greater works. She will
[1:55:35] be a continuation of the I don't care
[1:55:37] what you say. I don't care what it looks
[1:55:40] like. I don't you and folks come along
[1:55:42] say, don't you see the problems in the
[1:55:44] church? I say yes.
[1:55:47] Don't you see the issues in the church?
[1:55:48] I say yes. But I say, don't you see the
[1:55:51] prophecy
[1:55:53] in the word? But brother said, don't you
[1:55:55] see the problems in this? I say yes, I
[1:55:58] do. But don't you see the word? Do you
[1:56:01] think the problems in your church is
[1:56:03] going to stop the prophecy that is in
[1:56:06] the word? Do you think your failures and
[1:56:08] your shortcomings is going to stop the
[1:56:11] prophecy? God already calculated before
[1:56:14] the foundation of the world. He is the
[1:56:17] chief cornerstone. He is the master
[1:56:19] builder. And he calculated it. And he
[1:56:21] knew his word would be enough to restore
[1:56:25] you back to your place.
[1:56:29] Hallelujah.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He knew his word would be good enough to
[1:56:33] restore life back to the dry bones.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the condition and look
[1:56:40] at the word.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stop looking at yourself and
[1:56:45] looking in the mirror and looking at the
[1:56:46] issues and that's your problem because
[1:56:48] you're looking at your church. God said
[1:56:51] look unto me all you amen that are
[1:56:53] burdened and and heavy. God said, "Look
[1:56:55] unto me and live." Amen. That's why we
[1:56:58] get discouraged is because we're looking
[1:57:00] at the wrong thing. I think it's time we
[1:57:03] refocus our eyes and let's start looking
[1:57:06] back to the word of Almighty God. And
[1:57:09] where you look is where you're going to
[1:57:10] go. And if you look to the word, the
[1:57:12] word you will go. I say, God granted
[1:57:15] that. I think it's so beautiful. The
[1:57:18] prophet said God was not willing to
[1:57:20] leave that family on the ground.
[1:57:23] We like to read the quote to you. He
[1:57:24] said, "But the great sculptor, he saw
[1:57:26] the fall of his family, the masterpiece,
[1:57:29] but he was not willing to just leave it
[1:57:31] lay there face down and ruin." Let me
[1:57:33] tell you, God is not willing to see you
[1:57:35] laying down, face down, tore up,
[1:57:37] discouraged, torn out, beat out. God
[1:57:39] ain't going to leave you that way. Can I
[1:57:40] prophesy to you this morning? God ain't
[1:57:42] going to leave it that way. You may be
[1:57:44] discouraged, but God ain't going to
[1:57:45] leave you that way. Amen. I'm going to
[1:57:47] close right here. Musicians, go ahead
[1:57:49] and come. Amen. You may be tore up and
[1:57:51] defeated and discouraged, but God ain't
[1:57:52] going to leave it that way. Amen. Look
[1:57:55] back to the word and look at the
[1:57:57] prophecy of the scripture. You may say,
[1:57:59] "Well, Son, my condition is bad.
[1:58:03] I'm backsliding. I'm not where I need to
[1:58:05] be." So were them dry bones.
[1:58:09] Hallelujah. So were them dry bones. But
[1:58:12] did the dry bones stop the word of God?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Stand to your feet if you will. Did the
[1:58:17] dry bones stop the prophecy?
[1:58:19] I tell you how I I think of the
[1:58:22] testimony. You're very familiar with it.
[1:58:23] I'm sure prophet talked about that
[1:58:25] vision of that dead boy in Finland. I
[1:58:27] think it's the most powerful testimony.
[1:58:30] But years before prophecy, years before
[1:58:33] this ever happened, there was a dead boy
[1:58:34] down in Finland and brother Ram saw a
[1:58:37] vision and saw the dead boy was run over
[1:58:39] by a car, had a bowl cut hair and his
[1:58:42] leggings torn up and all these things.
[1:58:43] It was just perfect. And they wrote it
[1:58:45] down. See, prophecy is beforehand, not
[1:58:48] after.
[1:58:50] Just because you prophesied what
[1:58:52] happened today don't make you a prophet.
[1:58:55] I could have done that. I knew he was
[1:58:57] going to be wearing a green suit because
[1:58:58] I see I ain't a prophet.
[1:59:01] A prophet's before it happens. That's a
[1:59:03] true prophet. What if he says comes to
[1:59:05] pass and hear him? Brother Ram has that
[1:59:08] vision of that boy there in Finland and
[1:59:10] he's he's all dead and he's crushed up.
[1:59:13] It's a horrible vision that brother Ram
[1:59:15] sees and the condition the boy's in. He
[1:59:17] said they're there in Finland for the
[1:59:18] meeting and and they're they come up on
[1:59:20] a car crash and and brother Ram says, "I
[1:59:23] saw a little boy out there laying and I
[1:59:24] thought my what an awful sight this is.
[1:59:26] What a horrible sight it is." And they
[1:59:28] got out and begin to look. Brother
[1:59:29] looked at the boy and said I could just
[1:59:31] barely look at it because I had my boy
[1:59:33] at home and I thought my this is
[1:59:34] somebody's kid that's here. Ram said, "I
[1:59:36] turned and began to walk away."
[1:59:39] He said, "But there was a hand that got
[1:59:40] put on my shoulder." He said, "And I
[1:59:43] would have missed the vision."
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought, who put the hand on
[1:59:47] my was brother? Was it brother Moore?
[1:59:49] Was it this brother?" Well, he said,
[1:59:50] "But it was God." He said, "There was a
[1:59:52] hand on my shoulder and I turned me back
[1:59:55] to the boy." He said, "And I looked at
[1:59:57] the boy and I said, "Wait a minute. This
[2:00:00] is the vision.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; This is the vision that's happened. This
[2:00:04] is the vision." But brother Moore,
[2:00:05] whoever it was, go get your Bible, get
[2:00:07] your fly leaf out, read it. They begin
[2:00:08] to read it. He said, "Yeah, this is
[2:00:10] exactly the vision." And so, Brother
[2:00:12] Brandham said, "I already knew what was
[2:00:14] going to happen. Hallelujah." He could
[2:00:17] have already started to praise and
[2:00:19] worship and shout because he already
[2:00:22] knew what would happen. And said, "I
[2:00:24] came down there to the young boy and
[2:00:25] begin to pronounce life over him and
[2:00:28] said, "Breathe the breath of God. God
[2:00:30] would store life back into him." And the
[2:00:31] prophet said that the boy jumped back up
[2:00:33] and received his life. And it was a
[2:00:35] great victory that was won. You say,
[2:00:38] "Bro, son, why do you say that?" Amen.
[2:00:40] Because you was that boy. Amen. You was
[2:00:42] that person that was dead and crushed up
[2:00:45] and torn up, but you was in the vision.
[2:00:47] You say, "What vision?" Amen. The
[2:00:49] prophet went beyond the curtain of time.
[2:00:51] Amen. He went he went to another world
[2:00:54] and begin to see a vision take place.
[2:00:56] And he saw that alpha church, the church
[2:00:58] under the prophet Paul. He said, "But
[2:01:00] then I saw another church begin to come
[2:01:03] and it was that omega church." church.
[2:01:04] He said it was the bride that was coming
[2:01:07] out of the Leo in church age. And he
[2:01:10] said that last church looked just like
[2:01:13] the first church and she was marching
[2:01:16] according to the word. You said what
[2:01:18] does that mean? I'll tell you what it
[2:01:19] means. I represent myself in that
[2:01:22] vision. If you can handle it, maybe you
[2:01:24] can't, but I see myself in that vision.
[2:01:28] Amen. The prophet already saw me over
[2:01:30] there. I'm that omega church. I'm that
[2:01:33] omega bride. I'm the one that was
[2:01:35] walking according to the word just like
[2:01:37] they was. Just like the alpha church is
[2:01:40] what the omega church is. And it don't
[2:01:42] matter how crushed that boy was.
[2:01:46] Isn't that just so powerful?
[2:01:48] The said, "If God showed me a vision to
[2:01:50] go down into the presidential graveyard
[2:01:52] and call Josh George Washington from the
[2:01:55] grave, he said, I'd invite the whole
[2:01:58] entire world to come watch it." And let
[2:02:00] me just put you on notice. I invite
[2:02:02] every devil in hell. I invite all of our
[2:02:05] critics. I invite all of our naysayers.
[2:02:07] I invite the people that want to see us
[2:02:09] stumble and fall. I invite all of the
[2:02:12] enemy that wants to see us, Amen,
[2:02:14] backslide and fall from God. I invite
[2:02:16] every single one of them and they say,
[2:02:18] "There won't be a rapture. You won't
[2:02:20] make it." I say, "Watch me do it
[2:02:22] according to the prophecy of the word."
[2:02:25] Hallelujah. I'm not waiting to get my
[2:02:28] joy. I'm not waiting to worship. But I
[2:02:31] see myself in the prophecy. You say,
[2:02:33] "Why are you happy no matter what
[2:02:35] happens to you?" Because I see myself in
[2:02:38] the word. And I know no matter what
[2:02:41] happens, it's in his hands.
[2:02:48] But Lord, if you would have been here,
[2:02:49] you could have changed it. But I know
[2:02:51] you. You got the words of life eternal.
[2:02:56] Hallelujah. And even if you're four days
[2:02:59] late, you're still right on time.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. I I trust
[2:03:04] this has been a help to you.
[2:03:11] Amen. Restoration
[2:03:13] no matter condition. I love the
[2:03:15] scripture. The trials of our present
[2:03:18] time are not even worthy to be compared
[2:03:21] to the glory. Ain't that just wonderful?
[2:03:24] the stuff you're going through, it ain't
[2:03:26] even worthy compared to the glory that
[2:03:29] shall be revealed in you. So if you're
[2:03:32] going through the valley, praise God. If
[2:03:35] you're going through the worst time of
[2:03:36] your life, worship God. May God bless
[2:03:39] you. We turn to your pastor.
[2:03:56] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:00] What a what a wonderful uh word from the
[2:04:04] Lord.
[2:04:06] Restoration no matter
[2:04:10] the condition.
[2:04:14] Um
[2:04:15] just Brother Solomon was just kind of
[2:04:17] going through that and Restoration is
[2:04:21] just it's a very vast subject certainly
[2:04:25] deals with us at the individual level
[2:04:28] then you know from the church ages
[2:04:32] um there's restoration there just so
[2:04:35] much that can be preached this but as he
[2:04:38] was just dealing with a little component
[2:04:40] there of the the individual and my god
[2:04:45] just David did not lose salvation
[2:04:52] David lost the joy of his salvation
[2:04:57] and was talking about that prodical son
[2:05:00] and how when he was in the pig pit did
[2:05:02] that change his status.
[2:05:06] So your condition does not change your

[2:11:08] Amen.
[2:11:11] Lord, I agree. I agree with what your
[2:11:13] word say. I'm so glad that
[2:11:15] predestination was laying in the roots
[2:11:17] of the tree.
[2:11:20] The predestinated promise, the word of
[2:11:22] God was laying in the root. God knew the
[2:11:24] condition before it even got there. And
[2:11:27] when It looked absolutely
[2:11:30] hopeless.
[2:11:32] There was a prophecy
[2:11:34] in the roots. And maybe your situation
[2:11:37] this morning looks absolutely hopeless.
[2:11:40] But when you get to that space, there is
[2:11:42] a prophecy that is waiting for you at
[2:11:45] that condition.
[2:11:47] Prophecy says, "I will restore." When
[2:11:51] you can't help yourself, but he'll help
[2:11:53] you. I will restore saith the Lord. Oh,
[2:11:59] how we thank God.

[2:12:04] to do one thing here in the service. The
[2:12:06] prophet told us service is not complete
[2:12:10] unless we have an offering. So I want to
[2:12:12] make sure that we do that uh before we
