[1:16:57] says this but now is Christ risen from
[1:17:02] the dead and become the firstfruits of
[1:17:05] them that slept
[1:17:06] for since by man came death by
[1:17:10] man came also the resurrection of the
[1:17:13] dead
[1:17:15] for as an Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:17:19] shall all be made alive but every man in
[1:17:24] his own order Christ the firstfruits
[1:17:27] afterward they that are Christ's at his
[1:17:30] coming
[1:17:31] then cometh the end when he shall have
[1:17:35] delivered up the kingdom to God even the
[1:17:38] father when he should have put down all
[1:17:40] rule and all authority and power
[1:17:43] for he must reign till he hath put all
[1:17:47] enemies under his feet the last enemy
[1:17:52] that shall be destroyed is death
[1:17:56] a man let's turn amen also over to
[1:18:01] Hebrews 11
[1:18:08] want to thank the Lord for bringing
[1:18:11] sister charelle back seat but she was
[1:18:13] away for a little bit there I want to
[1:18:15] thank God for bringing her back safely
[1:18:17] here in Hebrews I'm sorry I've said
[1:18:21] eleven it's chapter 13 verse 11 and the
[1:18:24] Hebrews 13 verse 11
[1:18:28] man
[1:18:29] says for the bodies of those beasts
[1:18:34] whose blood is brought into the
[1:18:36] sanctuary five
[1:18:38] by the high priests for sin our burnt
[1:18:43] without the camp so they brought in by
[1:18:46] the high priest for sin but then they're
[1:18:48] burned without the camp is like a
[1:18:51] destruction pretty much for that body
[1:18:54] the offering that they were making he
[1:18:57] says verse 12 Paul says wherefore jesus
[1:18:59] also that he might sanctify
[1:19:02] the people with his own blood suffered
[1:19:07] without the gate pretty much outside the
[1:19:11] camp right let us go forth therefore
[1:19:15] unto him without the camp bearing his
[1:19:19] reproach
[1:19:20] but for here we have no continuous City
[1:19:25] but we seek one to come amen the Lord
[1:19:29] had a blessing to the reading of his
[1:19:31] word let's pray father we thank you for
[1:19:33] the ability to read the word but we
[1:19:37] trust that the Holy Ghost would help us
[1:19:40] to understand what it is that we have
[1:19:42] read as the Holy Spirit led Paul to
[1:19:45] write these things now the Holy Spirit
[1:19:47] God would bring clarity for us through
[1:19:50] amen the word that will be shared today
[1:19:53] may you get all the glory all the honor
[1:19:54] a man out of this portion of the service
[1:19:58] as we have felt your spirit thus far we
[1:20:01] pray that you continue to take us
[1:20:02] forward in Jesus name we ask it amen
[1:20:05] amen god bless you can be seated we are
[1:20:08] continuing our journey a man on it
[1:20:11] happened at Calvary and I want to just
[1:20:16] kind of pick up a couple things that we
[1:20:18] were talking about last week and then
[1:20:20] just kind of move it forward a little
[1:20:21] bit but let me just go back in and and
[1:20:24] just rehearse I mention these things but
[1:20:26] didn't necessarily read them so let me
[1:20:28] let me go to the sermon the possessing
[1:20:31] the enemy's gate I want to read
[1:20:32] something there and then you know we'll
[1:20:35] go we'll go for it too maybe one other
[1:20:37] quote from there and then I got some
[1:20:39] things I'll share possessing a man the
[1:20:41] enemy's gates
[1:20:43] praise the Lord says God had been
[1:20:46] testing the patriarch because he had
[1:20:50] given him a promise a man and this is
[1:20:53] something that you need to understand
[1:20:54] that after you get a promise you're
[1:20:55] gonna get a test alright God had been
[1:20:58] testing the patriotic because he had
[1:21:00] been given he had given him a promise
[1:21:03] and and when God makes a promise he
[1:21:06] wants to be sure that this person is
[1:21:10] worthy of the promise before he fulfills
[1:21:13] what he said or what he promises hey man
[1:21:17] so you know the other thing that happens
[1:21:20] with the test when you when you get one
[1:21:22] amen that's a sign that God got
[1:21:24] confidence in you right the test could
[1:21:27] not come the job a man until God
[1:21:30] actually approved it was going to go to
[1:21:31] jail right so so here some things are
[1:21:34] coming into our lives God allows it to
[1:21:36] happen but it's because it gots
[1:21:37] confidence in us and the other thing is
[1:21:39] a man like the Prophet tells us here he
[1:21:42] wants to be sure that the person
[1:21:44] that'sthat's get this promise is worthy
[1:21:47] to receive it before he fulfills it
[1:21:49] let's go on he says so Abraham have been
[1:21:51] promised that through his seed the whole
[1:21:53] world would be blessed that he'd have a
[1:21:57] son and the son out of him should come
[1:21:59] forth the seed that would bless the
[1:22:00] whole earth and Abraham when the promise
[1:22:02] was given to him was 75 years old and
[1:22:05] Sarah his wife was 65 years old but the
[1:22:08] Bible tells us that Abraham
[1:22:10] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:22:13] through unbelief but was strong giving
[1:22:16] praise to God and you know and I know
[1:22:19] that's what Paul said in Romans 4 but
[1:22:22] like I mentioned last week the reason
[1:22:24] that Paul could say that especially if
[1:22:26] you go back to Genesis and you read the
[1:22:28] storm Abraham he staggered quite often
[1:22:30] they may he he was always trying to help
[1:22:33] he did a lot of things that that with
[1:22:35] cars want to say this man was not a man
[1:22:37] of faith this man was a man of doubt
[1:22:39] hallelujah but the reason that Paul
[1:22:42] could write that in Romans quo amen
[1:22:44] about Abraham is because before Abraham
[1:22:46] staggered God gave him an unconditional
[1:22:50] covenant
[1:22:51] hallelujah I love that just because
[1:22:54] before you stagger did you get it Church
[1:22:57] before before before amen are you try
[1:23:00] before your tribulation before and then
[1:23:03] you're out of them until you fail here
[1:23:04] you felt before my failure
[1:23:07] God gave me an unconditional covenant
[1:23:10] and because I've got that unconditional
[1:23:13] covenant that's why I'm standing where
[1:23:16] I'm standing today
[1:23:18] right it ain't getting got nothing to do
[1:23:21] with me but it's all about what Christ
[1:23:23] has done
[1:23:25] such as a beautiful picture when you
[1:23:27] begin to see it the youth not being the
[1:23:30] devil I have nothing that he can hold
[1:23:32] over our heads no I didn't do it you did
[1:23:36] that in do it you didn't know I didn't
[1:23:38] do it it wasn't me that did that

[1:37:01] would say something that God told me to
[1:37:03] say to y'all
[1:37:04] i'ma say something
[1:37:07] there used to be a time and I'm Lord I'm
[1:37:10] gonna come back to this it happened at
[1:37:12] Calvary it used to be a time that you
[1:37:15] did not find women talking sports
[1:37:22] you didn't find that amongst women
[1:37:25] ladies State ladies they did not they
[1:37:28] did not delve into that area but now you
[1:37:31] find ladies talk more about it than men
[1:37:34] y'all better watch that spirit
[1:37:38] there used to be a time limit i'ma say
[1:37:40] this too I'm here I'm here see when you
[1:37:45] know
[1:37:46] ladies playing basketball right
[1:37:49] that was a time you didn't see that now
[1:37:52] it's become so common and and there was
[1:37:55] a spirit that came with the basketball
[1:37:59] you just saw the basketball but it was a
[1:38:02] spirit following the basketball and it
[1:38:06] was a homosexual spirit
[1:38:08] if y'all just say y'all y'all look
[1:38:11] around I mean it ain't nothin but the
[1:38:13] truth and now our kids getting involved
[1:38:16] in all this kind of stuff it's a spirit
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:22] when you think I don't mean for it to go
[1:38:24] that far you need to stop at the early
[1:38:26] parts
[1:38:27] somebody need this started on I went too
[1:38:30] far with this I'm turning around I'm
[1:38:31] going back the other way a man church
[1:38:33] right we got to get there amen yeah can
[1:38:37] I still feel the pool I
[1:38:40] ain't got past the first quote yet
[1:38:45] amen amen
[1:38:47] I got Lord Jesus I got much to sing all
[1:38:52] right so y'all stay with me amen amen
[1:38:55] don't worry don't go nowhere don't leave
[1:38:56] yet don't leave yet we got motive see
[1:38:59] like they say don't turn that radio off
[1:39:02] all right come on it's time totally this
[1:39:05] final test that Abraham got to write
[1:39:07] that that final test and it said that
[1:39:09] that's the way it is with all the seed
[1:39:11] of Abraham God gives us the final test
[1:39:13] just before he gives the promise and if
[1:39:17] it was possible he said I'd like to say
[1:39:18] something here personally but but I
[1:39:20] would hold that the final test to see
[1:39:22] how you react upon him and when he gave
[1:39:24] Abraham this test he found Abraham just
[1:39:27] as true as he was when he started
[1:39:29] what a blessing it would be this morning
[1:39:32] if we who take his promise of healing
[1:39:36] was banned just as true as we did when
[1:39:39] he stood and accepted it no matter what
[1:39:41] the doctor saying it stand just as true
[1:39:44] he goes on say this day and when he did
[1:39:47] this and never withheld his only son but
[1:39:51] was about to plunge the knife into
[1:39:52] Isaac's bosom to destroy his testimony
[1:39:54] he testified all over the earth all over
[1:39:58] the known earth that he was acquainted
[1:40:00] with that he was going to have this son
[1:40:02] and then when the Sun came he was asked
[1:40:05] to double back and to destroy the only
[1:40:08] hope that he had was testimony to people
[1:40:10] feel and when God seemed that he was
[1:40:13] loyal to that faith that he had in God
[1:40:17] God looked out of the heavens and he
[1:40:20] said I swore by myself then I'll bless
[1:40:24] you and multiply you you and your seed
[1:40:28] shall possess the gate of the enemy God
[1:40:30] was impressed by what he saw Abraham and
[1:40:34] God wants to be imposed by what he sees
[1:40:36] in you
[1:40:39] what a promise all right I got to go on
[1:40:44] I want to go to the Cedars it's not air
[1:40:47] at the shuk I hit this last week but I
[1:40:49] want to come and just hit it again a
[1:40:50] little bit
[1:40:51] remember Galatians 4 verse 33 31 says
[1:40:55] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[1:40:56] cast out the bondwoman and her son but
[1:40:58] the son of the bondwoman shall not be
[1:41:00] heir with the son of the freewoman so
[1:41:03] then brethren we are not the children
[1:41:05] not children of the bondwoman but of the
[1:41:07] free you know and I'm hitting this
[1:41:09] because people trying to get us to
[1:41:11] compromise with this word
[1:41:13] and we're not gonna compromise I'm not
[1:41:15] apologizing for the message I'm not
[1:41:18] apologizing for the truths that came out
[1:41:20] if y'all need somebody apologize ask God
[1:41:22] he's the one that sent it I just believe
[1:41:25] it
[1:41:27] but I'm not apologizing for what's in it
[1:41:29] amen but people want you to compromise
[1:41:32] in certain ways no no we're not
[1:41:33] compromising with this we're just gonna
[1:41:35] say what the prophecy right and you know
[1:41:37] so cuz you know the question was
[1:41:39] actually do you think God could you know
[1:41:41] I mean if a person just didn't know
[1:41:43] didn't know
[1:41:45] you think that God will hold that
[1:41:47] against them if they just didn't know so
[1:41:49] I said well now that depends it depends
[1:41:53] on who you're talking about that's
[1:41:54] because the rich young ruler knew
[1:41:58] and when he come to Jesus and ask a
[1:42:01] question right Jesus gave him the answer
[1:42:04] that he was looking for but he turned
[1:42:06] away from the answer and so when and
[1:42:09] when he lifted up his eyes and Hale
[1:42:10] according to description that was his
[1:42:12] fault not Jesus father I said but I do
[1:42:15] believe that there be some thieves on
[1:42:16] the cross to and the thief that was his
[1:42:19] first time and only time that he can
[1:42:21] receive truth he accepted it and he was
[1:42:23] rewarded for but if a person got
[1:42:26] willfully
[1:42:30] willfully reject truth that's been
[1:42:32] presented to them the bothers thing that
[1:42:35] remains the most chakra fights
[1:42:38] for your sins
[1:42:40] that's Hebrews a
[1:42:43] man church so I mean it's just you know
[1:42:46] we're not gonna compromise with look
[1:42:48] you've got the total line a man a man
[1:42:50] there is no there is no you know what if
[1:42:53] what if no no no that we not talk about
[1:42:55] them we're talking about you now what
[1:42:59] have you reject the truth after knowing
[1:43:02] it you got question for everybody else
[1:43:05] but I'm bringing it back home you
[1:43:09] what's gonna be your end praise our Lord
[1:43:12] we got trying to be the savior for
[1:43:14] everybody else and we lost
[1:43:17] all right C does not air at the shuttle
[1:43:20] look at what he say here
[1:43:21] here the see once the Nazis but once C
[1:43:25] these other were not seed of Abraham
[1:43:27] because Abraham C was his faith seed
[1:43:29] that God was speaking of not his natural
[1:43:31] seed because after Sarah died Abraham
[1:43:34] married another woman and had seven sons
[1:43:35] besides daughters so wouldn't be Abraham
[1:43:38] seeds it was Abraham seed one and that
[1:43:42] was Abraham's faith see pointing to the
[1:43:45] Roya see that was to come through
[1:43:47] Abraham's faith not Abrahamson afterlife
[1:43:49] but Abraham's spiritual life who took
[1:43:52] everything contrary to God's Word and
[1:43:54] called it as though it was not and
[1:43:56] believed God against hope believed in
[1:43:59] hope that's the real see we're speaking
[1:44:01] on so that's why the rapture is
[1:44:04] different and will only be for the royal
[1:44:07] seed of Abraham it cannot come by the
[1:44:11] natural carnal seed of the church it'll
[1:44:14] have to be the royal seed of the word of
[1:44:16] God through Abraham the royal seat
[1:44:19] that's what the rapture has to be first
[1:44:21] because remember we which are alive and
[1:44:23] remain shall not hinder prevent those
[1:44:26] which are asleep for the trumpet of God
[1:44:28] they men shall sound the dead in Christ
[1:44:30] shall rise first we which are alive and
[1:44:33] remain shall be caught up with them
[1:44:35] together and meet the Lord in the air
[1:44:37] notice and again it's written and the
[1:44:40] rest of the Dead lived not for a
[1:44:42] thousand years therefore they will not
[1:44:44] be heirs together listen there will not
[1:44:47] be in the rapture together y'all get
[1:44:50] that
[1:44:51] they want to know if they're gonna make
[1:44:52] the rapture no they're not that the seed
[1:44:56] of the of the bondswoman will not be in
[1:44:59] the rapture with the seed of the
[1:45:01] freewoman
[1:45:02] let me just put it this way
[1:45:06] denominational seed
[1:45:08] will not make the rapture
[1:45:12] so I'll put it this way if they're if
[1:45:16] they're true seed like I was true seed
[1:45:19] and
[1:45:20] denomination I'm gonna hear the mother
[1:45:23] Eagle cry
[1:45:27] you're gonna hear the mother Eagle cry
[1:45:30] that's what's gonna happen that's my
[1:45:31] brother branham share that said when
[1:45:32] that when that Eagle took off looking
[1:45:34] for his other as other eaglet that was
[1:45:37] stuck inside of a chicken coop and it
[1:45:39] let out a scream that little that little
[1:45:42] eaglet down there Muslim chickens
[1:45:43] finally realized I belong up there not
[1:45:46] down here and they'll come out
[1:45:49] ever since I've been back from Israel
[1:45:51] got two calls from the radio people that
[1:45:54] have heard the word on the radio and
[1:45:56] said that the message is bless them
[1:46:00] - since I've been back from Israel see
[1:46:03] that and that day up in Palm Bay
[1:46:07] one in Vero one was in Palm Bay people
[1:46:11] hearing the word see I mean even even
[1:46:13] when brother
[1:46:15] it wasn't the local people that came to
[1:46:17] church it was people coming from all
[1:46:18] over the place and that's the way to be
[1:46:22] today people driver I mean somehow to
[1:46:24] chummy has taught me to come 30 minutes
[1:46:26] and I said oh we got Saints in our
[1:46:27] church that come an hour and a half
[1:46:29] south with the pressure back on them
[1:46:31] don't tell me you can't come thirty
[1:46:33] minutes the Queen of Sheba went further
[1:46:35] than that
[1:46:38] see I think how trip was ninety days on
[1:46:41] the back of a camel through the desert
[1:46:44] and
[1:46:45] you got a cop
[1:46:50] and can't come to church no no no I
[1:46:53] don't care where you at I don't care how
[1:46:54] far you away from here if it's truth you
[1:46:56] need to get the truth oh my my my go
[1:47:00] back to read the book of what that mark
[1:47:02] I think it was where when they found
[1:47:04] Jesus was in the house man they got out
[1:47:06] the house and they went to find where
[1:47:08] Jesus was in the house and when they got
[1:47:11] there something happened
[1:47:14] hey man Church so look this says this
[1:47:17] this that the rapture is not for people
[1:47:20] that's not following the word bottom
[1:47:22] line now don't get me wrong I ain't say
[1:47:24] that they couldn't make heaven I just
[1:47:26] say they can make the rapture
[1:47:32] the raptures for his his bride
[1:47:35] well regards to one going to a wedding
[1:47:38] supper for two God when you go to you
[1:47:41] know the wedding supper it ain't it
[1:47:43] ain't for everybody else is for the
[1:47:45] bride and the bridegroom lady had to
[1:47:46] celebrate its back then they had the
[1:47:48] head table right so you know everybody
[1:47:51] not invited already got even a wedding
[1:47:54] everybody not in my head Oh
[1:47:56] Lord I'm getting there but church is
[1:47:59] just you know we need we got to stop
[1:48:01] compromising and and and also just stop
[1:48:04] you know we can't we got to say what the
[1:48:06] prophecy the rapture is not for I mean
[1:48:09] we not when I got I'm not trying to hurt
[1:48:11] nobody feelings cuz I've been there I
[1:48:13] was Baptists I was Pentecostal now I'm
[1:48:17] Christian
[1:48:22] all right so it's not it's not for
[1:48:26] everybody it's for those that are
[1:48:27] following the word all the word
[1:48:30] because you know so must follow just
[1:48:33] because we in church
[1:48:35] when we leave church we do other things
[1:48:38] against the word God see that
[1:48:43] he's a 24/7 God
[1:48:46] you know what he want
[1:48:48] 24/7 Christians
[1:48:52] alright I'm here with Abraham and Isaac
[1:48:58] Jim says 22 - it said that take that now
[1:49:03] thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou
[1:49:04] lovest and get thee into the land of
[1:49:06] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[1:49:09] offering upon one of the mountains which
[1:49:13] I would tell the F so we were working
[1:49:15] with this on last week and how
[1:49:17] Abraham took Isaac up the same mountain
[1:49:22] you know where Christ was also being
[1:49:25] offered for our sins I just I went out
[1:49:27] when I got the Israel I saw that just
[1:49:29] really meant so much to meet it to see
[1:49:31] that it was the same mountain brother
[1:49:33] branham even brought out multiple coats
[1:49:35] I can't read them all to you but I have
[1:49:36] him if you if you ever want him just let
[1:49:38] me know and I'll send him to you but it
[1:49:39] says he's took him up the same he'll up
[1:49:42] the same Hill and it just just just just
[1:49:44] kind of goes to show you know how how
[1:49:47] God was tackling himself a man in the
[1:49:49] life of Abraham that he wouldn't I mean
[1:49:51] it was just so perfect that it's the
[1:49:53] same mountain that I'm leading you to my
[1:49:56] son when he said he said that God was
[1:49:58] gonna provide himself a sacrifice he
[1:50:01] wasn't doing number prophesied and when
[1:50:04] he prophesied God Himself came to the
[1:50:06] same mountain and offered him offered
[1:50:10] himself for our sins what a beautiful
[1:50:12] story now when we look at this burnt
[1:50:15] offering let's just kind of work with
[1:50:17] this a little bit we look at this burnt
[1:50:18] offering aid man it was a sacrifice that
[1:50:21] was made by fire and it consisted of
[1:50:25] using the whole animal right it was the
[1:50:28] whole animal had to be used when you
[1:50:30] were doing a burnt offering amen other
[1:50:33] offers that just use part
[1:50:35] all right this impart that but but when
[1:50:37] God told Abraham a man in genesis 22:2
[1:50:40] he says you can pull that up genesis
[1:50:43] 22:2 he says he said take now thy son
[1:50:45] thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[1:50:47] and get into the land of mire and offer
[1:50:49] him there for a burnt offering
[1:50:52] it was going to be the complete
[1:50:54] sacrifice this was the ultimate
[1:50:57] sacrifice Isaac was don't lose his life
[1:50:59] that that's what was planned amen at the
[1:51:02] spot but God knew a man that he was
[1:51:04] going to provide a substitute and not
[1:51:08] only did he provide a substitute for
[1:51:10] Isaac but he provided a substitute for
[1:51:13] us and I just I just love this too you
[1:51:17] know that's why I say it wasn't that God
[1:51:19] sent his son God became the son
[1:51:24] now death in his son
[1:51:27] God became the son in order to die $0.05
[1:51:32] go back to Isaiah 12 you'll see that
[1:51:34] right so so so here here we got this dis
[1:51:37] burnt offering amen it consists of using
[1:51:40] the whole animal also it was described
[1:51:44] as an offering that goes up talk to God
[1:51:47] amen also it was um o my offering that
[1:51:51] goes up to God amen into his hands he
[1:51:55] committed a spirit right amen it goes up
[1:51:57] to God's glory to God amen it was it was
[1:52:01] turned a continual offering and then the
[1:52:04] teach the nation of Israel that their
[1:52:06] sinfulness required a complete and a
[1:52:08] continual torment and consecration the
[1:52:11] right also this burnt offering it was
[1:52:14] offered at the time of Passover
[1:52:17] the burnt offering see I told y'all
[1:52:19] gonna have read our Bibles after this
[1:52:21] you can have to put y'all you put down
[1:52:22] your phones and go back and read your
[1:52:23] Bibles amen it was all three at a time
[1:52:26] of Passover and if you remember Jesus
[1:52:29] Christ himself amen was open at the time
[1:52:32] of Passover Oh
[1:52:35] glory to God now when they all prayed a
[1:52:39] man at a time of Passover and reason I'm
[1:52:42] giving you all of this the reason I'm
[1:52:44] giving you this because I told you Amen
[1:52:46] it was the yes the stain heal but I said
[1:52:50] Calabrese was about a four minute walk
[1:52:53] it was a four minute walk from where
[1:52:57] Abraham offered Isaac
[1:52:58] now there's significance to that walk he
[1:53:03] understand and the significance is found
[1:53:06] right in Scripture we just ready here in
[1:53:09] Hebrews 13 instead for the bodies of
[1:53:11] those beasts whose blood is brought into
[1:53:14] the sanctuary by the high priest for sin
[1:53:16] and burn
[1:53:18] without the camp
[1:53:21] so if he was the perfect burnt offering
[1:53:25] he could not be offered in the same spot
[1:53:28] Isaac was he had to go to camp
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:36] he had to go outside the camp so that
[1:53:39] for a minute walk was to fulfill
[1:53:40] Scripture
[1:53:43] and why didn't why did he tell amber him
[1:53:47] the brain also get over him as a burnt
[1:53:49] offering because there's all types all
[1:53:52] for sin offerings in another time but
[1:53:54] he's had burnt offering it was gonna be
[1:53:56] the whole person consumed
[1:53:58] Christ gave everything y'all
[1:54:01] and he had to do it outside the camp
[1:54:04] with that what that meant was outside
[1:54:07] the city gates and when you go to
[1:54:09] Jerusalem you see how the gates are just
[1:54:11] lined up you know like you can just you
[1:54:13] can see it even on a picture I had a
[1:54:15] picture I will show you but just on the
[1:54:17] outside of the gate
[1:54:18] this is where they had to put him
[1:54:21] but they don't realize what they're
[1:54:23] doing they think they think they're
[1:54:25] doing it too embarrassing but no he's
[1:54:27] there because that's what His Word says
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:31] let's just read a couple of things here
[1:54:33] yeah we'll just read a couple of things
[1:54:36] that that's just Oh Lord yeah this
[1:54:39] justice can I just let me just jump
[1:54:41] there with me yeah y'all got that part
[1:54:43] so far right he had to go outside the
[1:54:45] gate
[1:54:47] outside
[1:54:48] oh Jesus let me let me let me read
[1:54:52] numbers 19
[1:54:57] outside the gate
[1:55:01] he's fulfilling Scripture you go back in
[1:55:03] Leviticus and Exodus you'll see
[1:55:05] different times you'll read the
[1:55:07] scripture and they're off in a Bullock
[1:55:08] sometime offering a ram it's outside the
[1:55:11] camp right anytime they're doing that
[1:55:14] burnt burnt offering it's outside
[1:55:16] hallelujah glory now numbers 19 they're
[1:55:21] something that's picked up here verse 1
[1:55:24] look at this it says in the Lord spake
[1:55:27] unto
[1:55:28] Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the
[1:55:31] ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
[1:55:34] commanded stand speaking to the tune of
[1:55:36] Israel that they bring the red heifer
[1:55:38] and now when you when you bring this red
[1:55:40] have to look at it it's got to be
[1:55:41] without spot now what did they say about
[1:55:44] Jesus I find no fault in him
[1:55:51] it had to be without spot right it says
[1:55:54] he says
[1:55:56] speaking to the children that they bring
[1:55:58] the red heifer without spot wearing is
[1:56:00] no blemish and upon which never came
[1:56:04] yoke you know what that mean
[1:56:06] denominational yoke Oh y'all hold on let
[1:56:10] me let me brother Brown say he say he
[1:56:11] never got hooked in with denominations
[1:56:13] he never got hooked in with the
[1:56:15] Pharisees he never got hooked in with a
[1:56:16] surgeon he kept coming against him and
[1:56:18] he said and when we want to go and go to
[1:56:20] him outside the camp guess what we got
[1:56:23] to leave denomination
[1:56:26] you can't go back into denomination you
[1:56:30] don't find them outside the camp
[1:56:32] outside the denominational gates
[1:56:36] if you looking for Jesus you got to
[1:56:38] leave you got to go outside the camp you
[1:56:40] might have to go outside your city
[1:56:47] I'm still reading I'm still reading I'm
[1:56:50] still real so they bring the arendt
[1:56:52] heifer without spot wearing his double
[1:56:53] Emerson pump which never came guilt and
[1:56:55] he shall give her unto Eliezer now this
[1:56:58] is the high priest look at this watch
[1:57:00] this I'm gonna read a quote for you
[1:57:01] after this so stay with me amen says and
[1:57:03] ye shall and ye shall give her unto
[1:57:06] Eliezer so they're getting and for the
[1:57:08] random saying her always typed the
[1:57:09] church right you should give her a man
[1:57:12] until he's at a priest that he may bring
[1:57:14] her forth without the camp
[1:57:17] without the camp and one shall slay her
[1:57:20] before his face so that the red heifer
[1:57:23] had to be slayed outside the camp before
[1:57:27] the high priest
[1:57:28] stay with me and Eleazar the priest
[1:57:30] shall take up her blood with his finger
[1:57:32] and sprinkle of her blood directly
[1:57:34] before the tabernacle of the
[1:57:36] congregation seven times and one shall
[1:57:39] burn the heifer in a site her skin and
[1:57:41] her flesh and her blood with her dung
[1:57:42] shall be burned now let's read a couple
[1:57:45] of things here from the Prophet just to
[1:57:47] kind of bring clarity on that that
[1:57:50] scripture that we just read I want to
[1:57:52] read from the water of separation and
[1:57:54] then after that the next quote I'm gonna
[1:57:56] read is Christ that's the title of the
[1:57:58] sermon at the past I mean that the
[1:58:00] Prophet preached Christ all right he
[1:58:02] says the water separation is night now
[1:58:04] God telling Moses and Aaron and and he
[1:58:07] was the prophet and priest Moses the
[1:58:10] Prophet Aaron the priest he said now I
[1:58:12] want you to go out and get a heifer a
[1:58:14] young heifer which is all one color one
[1:58:18] complete color red red always red we
[1:58:21] always think looks red is danger red the
[1:58:23] cigarette does signify danger or a life
[1:58:26] or so forth but read in the scripture
[1:58:29] signifies redemption through the blood
[1:58:31] the harlot Rahab when she put the
[1:58:34] Scarlet streak down and all through the
[1:58:36] Bible is a scarlet Street redemption
[1:58:39] comes through and through the shedding
[1:58:42] of the blood that's why was a red heifer
[1:58:43] representing redemption right through
[1:58:46] the shedding of the blood and without
[1:58:48] the shedding of blood there's no
[1:58:50] remission of sin listen and how that God
[1:58:54] said to get this hipper that's right all
[1:58:56] over not one spots Amen of anything else
[1:59:00] but perfectly red but God look through
[1:59:02] red and you know what color red is
[1:59:04] looking for red red the rent makes white
[1:59:07] flat one time right through red produces
[1:59:10] right so when God looks through the
[1:59:11] blood of Jesus Christ - who - we wash
[1:59:14] scarlet red with sin and covered by the
[1:59:16] blood he sees us white as snow
[1:59:20] though your sins be red like crimson
[1:59:22] they shall be white like snow I want to
[1:59:26] go on to the sermon Christ and that's
[1:59:28] quote I mean that scripture that brother
[1:59:30] Branham just quoted was Isaiah 1:18 says
[1:59:32] come now let us reason together a man
[1:59:35] saith the LORD though your sins be as
[1:59:37] scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:59:38] though they be red like crimson they
[1:59:40] shall be as wool let's go on I want to
[1:59:43] get to Christ I want you to see this he
[1:59:47] had that he couldn't be offered in the
[1:59:49] exact same spot but it was the same heel
[1:59:51] stained obscenity and here they walking
[1:59:53] up the same Hill but when Christ died he
[1:59:55] had to go outside the gate and be
[1:59:58] offered as a burnt offering outside and
[2:00:00] we have to go to him outside the gates
[2:00:03] of denomination all right all right look
[2:00:07] at this in Christ it says notice this
[2:00:09] Hepper must be a rent one and now she
[2:00:13] must never have a yoke on her neck amen
[2:00:17] it says oh that was that has a great
[2:00:20] meaning - says wish we had time to go
[2:00:24] into all this but we don't says but ye
[2:00:27] but but the yoke meant that Christ was
[2:00:31] not yoked up with anything on this earth
[2:00:34] glory to God it's 55 - OH - to one and
[2:00:38] the paragraph is e - 27 I'm sorry if I
[2:00:42] didn't write that down 55 55 - Oh two to
[2:00:45] one and paragraph II - 27 I want to make
[2:00:49] sure the church gets this says notice
[2:00:51] the heifer must be a red one and now she
[2:00:53] must never have a yoke on her neck oh
[2:00:56] that has a great meaning - wish we had
[2:00:59] time to go into all this but we don't
[2:01:02] but the yoke meant that Christ was not
[2:01:04] yoked up with anything on this earth
[2:01:06] listen he was not yoked up with any
[2:01:10] affiliation or organization he was free
[2:01:13] to move where the Lord moved him be not
[2:01:16] entangled in the yoke of bondage so now
[2:01:20] again if somebody talked about going
[2:01:21] back into domination you're going back
[2:01:23] into bondage you know what that sounds
[2:01:25] like to me y'all know what that sound
[2:01:27] like the me that sound like some people
[2:01:29] that's the only way to the promised land
[2:01:34] as they own the way they got it they got
[2:01:37] involved with the Bible call them a
[2:01:40] mixed multitude
[2:01:44] cuz you know you are you ought to know
[2:01:47] your people you never thought like this
[2:01:49] you never talk like this you get this
[2:01:53] from
[2:01:54] then I got involved with the mixed
[2:01:57] multitude and another word local wheat a
[2:02:01] locoweed it and this is what caused them
[2:02:04] to think this way but but when it's
[2:02:05] where the children's organic there was a
[2:02:07] mixed multitude the mixed multitude
[2:02:09] begin to complain then it's kind of hard
[2:02:11] it's difficult and it makes multitude
[2:02:13] like you know what it was better in
[2:02:17] Egypt
[2:02:18] not not kara can I tell y'all let me
[2:02:21] just i'ma just I'm this something this
[2:02:23] fresh this fresh this is this is fresh
[2:02:26] this is I mean it's so fresh I gotta
[2:02:30] come down here and tell it to you I
[2:02:32] gotta tell it to you I want to be on
[2:02:35] your level
[2:02:37] the mixed multitude the reason that
[2:02:40] Egypt looks so good to them they weren't
[2:02:42] in slavery
[2:02:55] of course it looked good to do they were
[2:02:58] never experienced in slavery
[2:03:00] but when they got around that the
[2:03:02] children of Israel and start talking
[2:03:04] that nonsense the Israelites but about
[2:03:07] their slavery
[2:03:14] let's go home
[2:03:16] but that's the same devil today
[2:03:20] ain't going back no denomination I
[2:03:23] remember what it was like
[2:03:25] hey well none but spirit and now it's
[2:03:29] worse than it ever been it was bad when
[2:03:32] I was there now it's worse than ever
[2:03:34] ain't no way you're gonna get me to go
[2:03:35] back I'm gonna meet them outside the
[2:03:38] camp
[2:03:41] alright let me go in a little further
[2:03:47] be not entangled in the yoke of bondage
[2:03:49] yoke yourself not amongst unbelievers
[2:03:52] but be separated Christ has jumped to
[2:03:54] one thing and that's his church we were
[2:03:56] listening to that on Friday night that
[2:03:59] having an absolute right you know in
[2:04:02] brother branham's bringing out in that
[2:04:04] message how you know he called it and I
[2:04:08] never looked at it this way he said but
[2:04:09] they it's like it was in the days of
[2:04:11] judges every man did what was right in
[2:04:13] his own eyes look at it Baptist
[2:04:16] Pentecostal Presbyterian Episcopalian
[2:04:19] Catholic Lutheran
[2:04:21] arise oneness Tunis Church of God in
[2:04:25] Christ Church of God by prophecy
[2:04:27] churches I mean come on I mean which one
[2:04:30] do we go to
[2:04:32] it's hard to figure it out and then even
[2:04:35] amongst the groups they're separated
[2:04:37] you know separation is so bad that even
[2:04:40] atheists have denominations
[2:04:45] it's the truth if you go and look at the
[2:04:48] Athens they got a chart for who believe
[2:04:50] what
[2:04:51] that's the same thing it isn't Christian
[2:04:54] that's what we called the labyrinth
[2:04:57] it's very confusing when you get caught
[2:05:00] in the trap and the lever if you can't
[2:05:01] find your way out of the maze you need
[2:05:04] somebody to show you how to leave jobs
[2:05:06] that's why God sent a prophet to to lead
[2:05:09] us animes
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:11] [Applause]
[2:05:14] that's that's why I see these Easter he
[2:05:16] say the reason that in the book of
[2:05:18] Judges they were in the condition that
[2:05:20] they were in where they did every man
[2:05:23] did what was right in his own mouth and
[2:05:24] because they did not have a prophet
[2:05:28] but when God gave them prophet then they
[2:05:30] could see clearly
[2:05:32] and God gave us a profit now we see
[2:05:34] clearly I see things in the word that I
[2:05:37] didn't see before I saw some things a
[2:05:40] word before I went to Israel that I had
[2:05:42] never saw before my church that never
[2:05:44] taught anything like that and I went to
[2:05:46] multiple churches many of programs heard
[2:05:48] many of preachers name never heard some
[2:05:50] of these things nothing none of it and
[2:05:52] now after going to Israel one time said
[2:05:54] oh yeah this bottles a new Bible to me
[2:05:56] I'm seeing some other things now that I
[2:05:58] want to see in and did not tie right
[2:05:59] back to the message they oh lord have
[2:06:01] mercy God
[2:06:03] thank you Jesus
[2:06:06] I'm almost I'm coming home I'm coming
[2:06:09] home I'm coming home I'm coming home
[2:06:12] there's one thing that I need to tell
[2:06:14] y'all today and I've just been building
[2:06:16] up to just tell y'all that when I see it
[2:06:18] I'm gonna see a couple of things and I'm
[2:06:20] be gone
[2:06:23] then if let me finish to read this
[2:06:26] be not entangled in that yoke of bondage
[2:06:29] yoke itself not up amongst unbelievers
[2:06:32] be separated Christ is joke to one thing
[2:06:35] and that's his church which is not
[2:06:37] earthly organisation but a heavenly
[2:06:39] growing group of people that's
[2:06:42] regenerated by the blood of his own
[2:06:44] sacrifice but he had no yoke of this
[2:06:47] earth neither has his church free not
[2:06:49] yoked up with nothing but their free and
[2:06:53] yolk with pricey we're not children of
[2:06:55] the bondwoman we're children of the free
[2:06:58] woman
[2:07:00] c33
[2:07:02] free from denominational yoke right now
[2:07:04] the yoke and now don't get me wrong
[2:07:06] because there's everybody saying we've
[2:07:07] nondenominational nowadays they just
[2:07:10] took the Baptist in the Pentecostal name
[2:07:12] of but they still underneath believe the
[2:07:14] same stuff you just got a different name
[2:07:16] hallelujah hey man we not talk about
[2:07:20] just changing your name we talk about
[2:07:21] changing your nature
[2:07:23] listen so now the yoke must never be put
[2:07:27] upon the neck a very beautiful type of
[2:07:29] Christ now here's something that's very
[2:07:30] outstanding she must be killed in the
[2:07:33] presence of the high priests type of
[2:07:36] Christ again a sky-high
[2:07:38] Caiaphas had to had to witness his death
[2:07:41] and she must be killed without the camp
[2:07:43] she take her out in a camp and kill her
[2:07:45] and Christ died without the camp killed
[2:07:48] in the presence of the high priest as a
[2:07:49] witness as a public testimony
[2:07:53] it took him
[2:07:55] they took Jesus
[2:07:59] to go Gotha
[2:08:01] it took them
[2:08:03] to
[2:08:05] Calvary
[2:08:11] John 19 15 through 17 tells us but they
[2:08:15] cried out away with him away with him
[2:08:18] crucify him Pilate saith unto them shall
[2:08:20] I crucify your king the chief priest
[2:08:23] answered we have no king but Caesar
[2:08:26] then delivered he him therefore unto
[2:08:29] them to be crucified and they took Jesus
[2:08:31] and led him away verse 17 and journal 19
[2:08:36] says and and he bearing his cross went
[2:08:40] forth and to a place called the place of
[2:08:44] a skull
[2:08:46] which is called in the Hebrew
[2:08:50] Golgotha and and and and I just looked
[2:08:54] up a man a couple things here the word
[2:08:56] Calvary meant place of the skull or a
[2:09:00] place of skull the word Daugava means a
[2:09:05] heap of skulls
[2:09:07] the word
[2:09:09] Moriah
[2:09:12] meant bitterness of the Lord and and and
[2:09:16] you know it also means doctrine of the
[2:09:18] Lord bitterness of the Lord and ocula if
[2:09:20] we're gonna receive the doctrine of Lord
[2:09:22] we don't have to go outside the camp to
[2:09:23] get it
[2:09:24] but I'll submit the bitterness of Lord
[2:09:27] just let me work you just just a few
[2:09:28] more minutes so it's good you know the
[2:09:30] word the word Smyrna also meant bitter
[2:09:33] and the believers in that age had to be
[2:09:34] faithful unto death right the three wise
[2:09:38] men brought amen their their gifts to
[2:09:40] God one was gold with representing his
[2:09:42] deity and then another brought
[2:09:44] frankincense which represents a service
[2:09:46] offering and and the third brought
[2:09:48] murder amen and this was a this was an
[2:09:51] herb that would anoint one for death an
[2:09:53] earth that was pictured
[2:09:56] brother random tells us that Jesus was
[2:09:59] deity in service to die and thus Jesus
[2:10:02] himself drink the bitter cup of death
[2:10:07] for us
[2:10:09] Mariah represented bitterness of the
[2:10:13] Lord and there at that same spot Jesus
[2:10:17] praying amen just across the street in
[2:10:19] the garlic disseminating saying lord if
[2:10:21] it be possible let this cup this bitter
[2:10:23] cup pass from me
[2:10:25] but it said nevertheless not my will but
[2:10:28] but thy will be done and I loved it I
[2:10:31] loved it mark 1436 says instead Abba
[2:10:33] Father all things are possible unto thee
[2:10:36] see this is what when you when you're
[2:10:37] really get into a state of Prayer a man
[2:10:39] sometimes you get then you realize that
[2:10:41] when you make me you say certain prayers
[2:10:43] even though you don't know the perfect
[2:10:45] will of God you can accept the perfect
[2:10:48] will of God listen he says all things
[2:10:50] are possibility take away this cup from
[2:10:53] me nevertheless not what I will but what
[2:10:56] thou wilt
[2:10:58] sometimes we need to drink bitterness
[2:11:01] the bitter cup we need this wheat I mean
[2:11:03] sometimes you know it's it's sweet in
[2:11:05] the mouth but it get bitter in the belly
[2:11:09] and sometimes you got to take God you
[2:11:12] got to take God knows just as good as
[2:11:15] you take is yeses
[2:11:21] they say sometimes you take that bitter
[2:11:23] medicine and do your body pretty good
[2:11:26] it don't taste good going down but it's
[2:11:29] gonna do good later on
[2:11:31] Calvary meant this place of skull
[2:11:35] GOG Arthur meant a heap of skulls and if
[2:11:39] you ever you know when I went there and
[2:11:42] I looked at the place of skull when I
[2:11:43] look at Calvary you can actually see a
[2:11:46] skull kind of carved in the rock the way
[2:11:48] that the rock is carved we connect
[2:11:50] actors to see how that the skull is
[2:11:51] carved there but they call this the
[2:11:53] place of skull and this is where now he
[2:11:55] didn't necessarily die oh this mountain
[2:11:58] when he actually died was right down at
[2:12:00] the public road right next to it and the
[2:12:02] reason he got at the public road next to
[2:12:04] it the reason when I found out when I
[2:12:05] was there he said that allow Amanda the
[2:12:08] people to come by and and and do all the
[2:12:10] kind of stuff that they did spit on him
[2:12:12] and hit him and I but but if he was been
[2:12:13] on the top of the rock then that would
[2:12:15] have been trouble but it was near the
[2:12:17] area stay with me here stay with me here
[2:12:20] stay with me here
[2:12:22] Kaveri meant the place of the skull
[2:12:27] Isaac was taken to this place and it was
[2:12:30] near this place of the skull
[2:12:34] now I was talking this over with another
[2:12:36] pastor friend of mine he told me
[2:12:38] something say you know he don't have no
[2:12:40] proof of this but he heard just as
[2:12:42] someone is reading that at the place of
[2:12:44] skull that David took Goliath's hand and
[2:12:48] put it at the place of the skull
[2:12:52] that's good but I found that one a
[2:12:55] little bit better
[2:12:57] somebody before David
[2:12:59] somebody before Goliath that had they
[2:13:02] had
[2:13:04] their skull and the place of the skull
[2:13:08] and the person that I found out was
[2:13:11] there
[2:13:14] Adam
[2:13:19] Adams heads was taken to the place of
[2:13:24] the skull what am I saying the firt the
[2:13:26] last Adam died
[2:13:30] shed his blood at the same spot the
[2:13:34] first Adam hey it was lame
[2:13:55] now go back to first Corinthians 15
[2:13:58] go back and let's read first Corinthians
[2:14:01] 15
[2:14:06] look at this Paul's words are so perfect
[2:14:09] for
[2:14:11] sensed by man came death what man Adam
[2:14:17] since by man came death by man came also
[2:14:22] the resurrection of the dance
[2:14:25] not only was Jesus not only did he die
[2:14:28] here in this place but is his grave was
[2:14:30] right nearby
[2:14:31] in a rock right near by this place right
[2:14:35] it says since for since by man came
[2:14:37] death by man came also the resurrection
[2:14:40] day for as in Adam all die even so in
[2:14:44] Christ shall all be made alive I
[2:14:50] know to be hard for y'all to believe me
[2:14:53] so I wanted to read a quote out of the
[2:14:55] Easter seal
[2:14:59] yelling I'll say a man to me
[2:15:01] can I get a witness
[2:15:10] she as I was studying this look at
[2:15:14] Isaac you know being buried at the same
[2:15:18] heel as I was studying and all of a
[2:15:21] sudden this quote came I'm like oh Lord
[2:15:23] I never seen that before god I never
[2:15:26] seen that in the message and when I read
[2:15:28] the quote then I had to go to the
[2:15:29] Internet to start doing some research
[2:15:31] then I come to find out there as many
[2:15:33] people out there say the exact same
[2:15:35] thing watch what happened here watch
[2:15:37] would the products a true Easter seal
[2:15:40] true is to say Christ died at Calvary
[2:15:45] how that he went up to that cross I was
[2:15:49] reading a little book here not long ago
[2:15:51] that on to some kind of a research and
[2:15:54] in this research I found something most
[2:15:56] startling I sit down see how the
[2:16:00] prophets responding this I know it's
[2:16:01] true because the way he responded I sat
[2:16:04] down and I leave the book down and
[2:16:06] raised up my hands and praise God
[2:16:09] got up walked around a little bit and
[2:16:12] sat down and read it again I
[2:16:17] thought always that soul
[2:16:20] that on this same heel
[2:16:24] where Jesus was crucified
[2:16:27] Adam died and was buried on the same
[2:16:32] heel that Jesus died
[2:16:36] and was buried on the same Hill where
[2:16:41] Adam died
[2:16:44] he died don't go Gotha and was buried
[2:16:48] Anka Gotha look at this and I thought
[2:16:51] what appropriate whether it was right
[2:17:00] [Applause]
[2:17:02] it's opiate even if it was wrong it's
[2:17:05] appropriate that
[2:17:10] says the last Adamek I'm in the same
[2:17:13] spot as the first atom soon it was it
[2:17:17] completely
[2:17:19] Jesus drop the conscious
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:23] [Applause]
[2:17:26] yes nothing against us anymore
[2:17:29] [Applause]
[2:17:30] the penalty has been paid
[2:17:33] [Music]
[2:17:41] I'm going on
[2:17:44] let's say it was right let's just see it
[2:17:47] was right
[2:17:50] then the first Adam died and was buried
[2:17:53] and there yet in the dust because he
[2:17:57] represented the world and the people to
[2:17:59] sin but the second Adam being the God of
[2:18:02] heaven when he died on Golgotha there
[2:18:06] was enough earth to hold him there he
[2:18:09] rose on the third day and is alive
[2:18:11] forevermore but the sin problem myself
[2:18:16] God settled the sin problem there at
[2:18:19] Calvary
[2:18:20] that's where the debt was paid when this
[2:18:24] Adam second Adam died he paid the debt
[2:18:28] of sin for the human race and the world
[2:18:31] put him in a tomb and silver money and
[2:18:34] that tomb let me say we went on the
[2:18:37] stage you can read it later on but the
[2:18:39] church is still trying to keep him into
[2:18:41] him
[2:18:41] but he's knitted he is alive church and
[2:18:46] his word is just as real today as it was
[2:18:50] when it was real
[2:18:52] everything is Scripture as purpose imma
[2:18:57] take you know you'll find some of these
[2:18:59] things all over the internet but you
[2:19:01] know and and to some people just
[2:19:02] intellectual stimulation they feel so
[2:19:05] good about giving it to lecture but for
[2:19:07] me is my own Lord that where Adam sold
[2:19:11] us out you could go to the sink now had
[2:19:13] it how did Adam get to the mountain how
[2:19:17] did he know where you know God
[2:19:19] orchestrated where he would even die
[2:19:25] there's mobile things like that it
[2:19:28] should find you no just say one that one
[2:19:30] of Noah's sons the sons took his head
[2:19:33] took took the skull took his head they
[2:19:36] kept it through the arc and they took it
[2:19:40] and they planted it there
[2:19:41] that's what that's what they say that
[2:19:43] and they got they got they got I got an
[2:19:46] article here that just kind of goes to
[2:19:48] show I'll just read a statement from the
[2:19:50] article so if these um
[2:19:52] this is a thing I got off the internet
[2:19:55] says as an early Christian leader named
[2:19:59] or rich in
[2:20:01] this man's name a Christian leader by
[2:20:05] the name of origin oor iGEM who lived
[2:20:09] from 185 to 253 AD recorded that Jesus
[2:20:14] was crucified on the spot where Adam was
[2:20:16] buried and where his skull had been
[2:20:18] found whether or not this is true there
[2:20:21] was an early Christian belief that Jesus
[2:20:23] had been crucified near Adams burial
[2:20:25] place as the early story as this early
[2:20:29] story goes when the earthquake occurred
[2:20:30] as Jesus hung on the cross amen Matthew
[2:20:33] 27:51 his blood rain ran down the cross
[2:20:35] into the crack and the rock below and
[2:20:38] fell on the skull of Adam this history
[2:20:40] is so entrenched an early Christian
[2:20:42] tradition that Jerome referred to it in
[2:20:45] a letter in 386 ad it says interesting a
[2:20:50] Jewish tradition right so we got
[2:20:52] Christian tradition then yeah Jewish
[2:20:54] tradition states that Adam skull was
[2:20:57] buried near the city of Jerusalem by
[2:20:59] Northside Shem tradition says that this
[2:21:03] barrier of burial place was guarded by
[2:21:05] Melchizedek who was the priest king of
[2:21:07] Jerusalem Jerusalem during the time of
[2:21:10] Abraham see Genesis 14 18 unknown to
[2:21:13] most Western believers this history is
[2:21:15] so accepted that is it is considered a
[2:21:17] major theme of Orthodox doctrine and the
[2:21:20] skull of atom appears consistently the
[2:21:22] base of the cross in both paintings and
[2:21:24] icons if you've if you've ever seen if
[2:21:27] you ever see a skull at the base of a
[2:21:28] crucifix you can know that it symbolizes
[2:21:31] Adams skull that was allegedly found
[2:21:33] buried at the site of Jesus crucifixion
[2:21:36] they go on to say these extremely
[2:21:38] interesting facts although unprovable
[2:21:42] have retained strong support throughout
[2:21:45] 2,000 years of Christian history
[2:21:47] if it were true that's what they said
[2:21:50] what the Prophet says right if it were
[2:21:53] true it would be quite amazing that the
[2:21:55] second Adam Jesus Christ died for the
[2:21:58] sins of the world exactly on the spot
[2:22:00] where the first Adam the original sinner
[2:22:04] was bearing an Origin was keeping his
[2:22:07] records
[2:22:14] listen he says he says if it were true
[2:22:17] it would be quite amazing that the
[2:22:19] second Adam Jesus Christ died for the
[2:22:20] sins of the world exactly in the spot
[2:22:22] where the first Adam the original sinner
[2:22:23] was buried if Jesus's blood ran down the
[2:22:26] crack in the stone and fell upon Adams
[2:22:28] skull as tradition says it would be very
[2:22:30] symbolic of Jesus blood covering the
[2:22:32] sins of the human race that originated
[2:22:36] with that
[2:22:43] what a mighty God we serve
[2:22:47] manaphy that specific if he's just that
[2:22:50] perfect
[2:22:51] in the way that he does things Church I
[2:22:54] don't do realize he got everything under
[2:22:56] control
[2:22:58] nothing that's happening by chance by
[2:23:02] accident nothing has happening just be
[2:23:04] faithful to God
[2:23:10] God's got it all in control
[2:23:12] all in control I am I'm grateful
[2:23:17] maybe I'll just read one more now we'll
[2:23:19] leave but this is uh
[2:23:22] this is just a blessing to me
[2:23:25] all right second hand it wrote a
[2:23:28] second hand it roll
[2:23:37] sickness disease diseases affliction
[2:23:40] seeing everything held the hell the
[2:23:42] little group of Adams race that day
[2:23:45] that no one could do nothing about it
[2:23:47] they were helpless and the devil in his
[2:23:51] great marching army come marching in
[2:23:53] well-equipped powerful supernatural
[2:23:55] beings here set a little natural people
[2:23:57] with nothing they could do then in
[2:24:01] heaven something took place there was
[2:24:02] one stepped out called Jesus the
[2:24:05] precious son of God he said to the
[2:24:08] Angels and his brethren this day I'll
[2:24:11] give my life I'll save Adams race and he
[2:24:16] came down and was made flesh and dwelt
[2:24:18] among us one day standing yonder at
[2:24:21] Calvary when he seen the thickest part
[2:24:23] that there is an ending human life the
[2:24:26] darkest part of the spirit of human life
[2:24:28] is death
[2:24:30] every man fears death and when Jesus of
[2:24:34] Nazareth run against every devil there
[2:24:36] was in Hell and caught death right into
[2:24:38] his own busines Muslim and conquered
[2:24:40] death and sent back the Holy Ghost and
[2:24:42] said take this and do the best you can
[2:24:45] liberate the people yes the last enemy
[2:24:48] that was destroyed
[2:24:51] death and Jesus defeated death at
[2:24:56] Calvary it all happened at Calvary
[2:25:01] let's pray
[2:25:07] mmm God
[2:25:13] these things are not shared
[2:25:18] because our hairs to swell
[2:25:24] but God our hearts should shrink
[2:25:31] and your presence to see
[2:25:33] what a great work you did
[2:25:38] God don't let us leave this church and
[2:25:40] and go back out and live the same old
[2:25:43] ungodly lives that we we were living
[2:25:45] that that's why you started this full
[2:25:47] series off the ritual versus
[2:25:49] relationship we can't we can't serve you
[2:25:51] in a ritualistic form we're not just
[2:25:52] going to church just to go to church
[2:25:55] God this is about having a true
[2:25:57] relationship when we just how perfect
[2:25:59] you are
[2:26:00] we as we see it in Scripture with with
[2:26:04] Isaac
[2:26:05] now God to hear
[2:26:09] history has recorded that that Adam was
[2:26:13] buried right there at Calvary his goal
[2:26:16] was there and they took Jesus to the
[2:26:19] place of skulls
[2:26:22] showing that the work of redemption was
[2:26:25] complete the red heifer had to go
[2:26:28] outside the gate
[2:26:31] symbolizing Christ who would go outside
[2:26:33] the gate would be offered as a whole
[2:26:36] offering for the human race only if we
[2:26:40] would accept it
[2:26:44] it's not worth it the things that we'd
[2:26:47] go through this world different things
[2:26:48] we kind of hold on to
[2:26:51] maybe some young man holding on to a
[2:26:54] young lady young lady holding on to a
[2:26:56] young man
[2:26:57] God no good for him maybe people that
[2:27:02] want to hold on to different clothes
[2:27:04] sisters want to hold on to their pants
[2:27:07] to their earrings to Lord they're just
[2:27:10] just a lot of ungodly stuff their makeup
[2:27:13] their fingernail polish toenail polish
[2:27:15] Jesus these are things that people want
[2:27:17] to hold on to things that don't mean
[2:27:19] nothing
[2:27:21] god help us to shake free from this
[2:27:23] stuff
[2:27:25] other Saints that may get beyond that
[2:27:27] but they want to hold on to television
[2:27:29] they want to hold on to you know social
[2:27:32] media and all this that that was been
[2:27:33] used a lot at against us
[2:27:35] but God help us to shake ourselves free
[2:27:38] the Bible you know the Bible says we got
[2:27:40] to lay aside every sin and wait and
[2:27:42] there's some things that are not sins
[2:27:43] but they are weights
[2:27:48] please Lord don't don't don't the
[2:27:50] Prophet said it'll go right through so
[2:27:52] we won't even know it
[2:27:53] be sickening your Lord hearing these
[2:27:56] things and and and it's just going right
[2:27:58] innocent and right out or please let us
[2:28:01] draw closer to you
