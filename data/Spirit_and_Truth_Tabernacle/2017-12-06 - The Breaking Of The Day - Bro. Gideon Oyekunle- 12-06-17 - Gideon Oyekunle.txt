issue was perfectly hokey Barca tests now we cou she was such a fire okay let me tell phrase we are serving the Living God we are serving the Living God I am a lot of miracles I can tell you all but brothers sisters I believe you know that these two things that your father's evening he proves to you that that day has broken he's a good day for you is a good day for me don't you never died the world is very visceral the world comes to Ross the gospel not in word only boy in power let me tell friends I believe now that the review one of the hardest fought word of this day this meant to accomplish something in the lives of the bride this is what we change you this is what we transform you this is why we give you a returning faith I'm gonna brand side you know that where you begin to see obviously truly two things it will give you paper that's information of your body hallelujah that is why we are here that is what this message is for this toasters from you mister trust lets you god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord the breaking of day just appreciate brother Gideon and just breaking out just so much they're in for our souls to just feed on those testimonies there the end just just what a mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve and we all got to leave here encouraged no matter how dark your night is it may you keep holding on because the day's about to break amen that day is about to break hallelujah I was just thinking that scripture the Bible say weep in me and do it for the night but joy comes in the morning a man let's give the Lord another hand of praise her [Music] but his his word I'm gonna do there shall be light in the evening time a man here in a second you know before you can actually have a morning you've got to go through an evening you gotta have a nighttime before you have a morning right and you know as he was just kind of sharing there just our calendar just got us all messed up young can don't gonna be seated just for a little bit but this the Roman calendar that we're we're under a man in the way that we start our days and things like that it just really got things just really messed up it's so messed up it would be hard for people even understand what truly happened at the resurrection right because we look at it from our Roman calendar system but you got to be able to look at it from the way that the Saints in I mean that the people in Israel when this when when the Sun Goes Down that's the beginning of a new day right and that's that's how they kind of it that's how they start things so you have to always look at it from from that perspective and you know and it just kind of helps you understand just just a little bit more of the scripture our Western approach sometimes hinders us I'm just be honest with you it really does hinder us but me just coming back from Israel I'm a witness of many of the things that he was just sharing there and I tell you whenever you get a chance just to kind of see it from a man that the eastern culture perspective the Bible becomes a new Bible to you and man there's things that you read and there was like wait a minute I'm missing that just just Genesis one how many you all caught that he would just be brought that out tonight just right there in Genesis 1 the statement was made I just want to read it again I don't I don't want to miss it but it said uh-uh [Music] what was that he was bringing out how it was dark first and then then it was no it's evening and the evening in the morning were the first day right the evening and the morning not the morning in the evening of the evening in the morning it just you know another little little secret that the way that the the the Israel Israelis they get married on most lot of them get married I think on Tuesdays I think it's Tuesday and and the reason like well you know cheering you know our culture we kind of get married on on Saturdays you know that that's that's the that's a good day to get married but they choose Tuesday and I saw the question was actual why do y'all choose Tuesday say when when you read your Bible the book of Genesis that was the only day God said it was good at twice so if God said it was good twice on that thing we're gonna get married on that day say what I mean you know just little things that that they do that just just just blow our culture away and they'll shut down stop working and do everything else because they're doing it God said it was good twice on that day so I'm gonna do things on that day and I tell you just it just really blesses your heart when you just see these little nuggets tear Scripture it just really upsets you you know just just moving in a different direction and I tell you what we're so grateful for the message of the hour amen because every last one of us in here was in darkness before the darkness rolled away when we heard God's voice through his prophets and now we see things that others just cannot see in Scripture and and I'm really so I'm so wrapped up and tied up in this message that uh you might as well just not talk to me about anything else cuz I'm not even looking at it not even entertaining it you know and even though you know as he was saying there is probably even as we go into 2018 more and more darkness cell in front of people many are struggling a man in this hour but I have a promise telling the church on Sunday when that when the children Israel were leaving a man Egypt they told Pharaoh that they were not gonna even leave a cows hoof behind man if God was so concerned about a cows huh don't you think he's more concerned about your loved ones so no matter how much darkness they in there Shelby likes their shared me light I don't know how it's gonna happen but there shall be light and they will begin to walk in that light anybody believe that a man let's give a lot a hand of plays a man imma change that on ya yes all right let's let's sing we're walking it light hallelujah we light such a beauty for light two drops that standing help me singing see our light shine anywhere - I know around us night Jesus you are Jesus yes a light up the world come on single for your heart will work in the right and I like such a piece for light come with two drops merci ah bright shadow awareness around us ah Jesus is a lighter right over oh come on one more time before your heart to drive some nursing right Shyne around us today but night Jesus likes howleen come on one more time before your heart tonight yes we will such a beautiful light goes somewhere but then she all right around Oh oh Jesus he though hallelujah thank God for the lights thank God for the light let's just pray father we thank you for your word that has gone forth you tonight the breaking of the day God just reminded how the Prophet talked about the watchman and how he would sit on the tower she said higher than all the other people when he could see a lot more than what they could see and maybe through the night they would be so worried about what was what was happening but as we were told tonight just just for us just rest just sleep because the day is coming it's gonna break and when it breaks things will change father days many that's going through tremendous trials and tremendous tests and and God just wondering how are they gonna come through but help us work just to have faith in your words when you speak Lord things are transformed things have changed all it takes is one word from you and things will change so help us God just to maintain our faith and not look at father to darkness but look at the promise of light that's going to shine forth in the midst of that darkness we actually should just continue to bless for the Gideon father that you would just continue to use them for your your glory thank you for this powerful testimony they share it regardless wife God how you you stepped into a hopeless situation a very dark circumstance got it you brought light into the midst of that we thank you for the breaking of day in her life God we thank you God that you're proving that you are the same yesterday today and forever no matter how bad it might look god all it takes Lord is just just just one one little knot from you things will change so let me pray that you bless them and bless his family as church Lord

would keep us until we're able to come back together again give us traveling merchants if we go to our respective homes and Jesus Christ and we pray man and a man give a Lord another hand of praise unless it be the name of the Lord a man a man god bless you you can be seated the brothers will come and they will dismiss you it meant tonight don't forget we'll be gathering together at brother West Coast Church on the 17th a man for our combined Fellowship service remember the gene will be speaking that service so continue to keep him in prayer and this has come looking for it a man for what God has in store for us god bless you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
