that something the sisters - what God is good [Music] she was mentioning about the food yesterday and want you all to just continue to keep sister Verna and her family her uncle a man who she brought the church just right there before Christmas if think it was a week before the Sunday before Christmas every time he comes elder Jameson of Jimerson I always kind of share the testimony I walk into his church one one Saturday afternoon Saturday afternoon they were playing the fiddle and burning hell and I remember seeing that and seeing what hell was gonna be like [Music] out of fear you know God don't serve them like that out of fear but uh but we went and you know it's just something that planted a seed in my heart and I always give a lot of credit to that man doing that that night they're just things starting to get me to where I am today and I'm very grateful after that so keep up keep her family in prayer he went home to be with the Lord he was at his penis and you know and he's just a real precious man every life that he could pretty much come in contact with he touched her some some some way so keep up keep the family prayer in there Daniel awesome I was there [Music] family members was speaking to me and he made a comment to me setup said the young the only thing is bending between your prayer being prayed and God providing the answers to that prayer he said because you know doctor do it say but only things down in between that is your level of patience and I said there's a prophecy of what but I say what wisdom because oftentimes when we're waiting something from the Lord if you don't come in on time we try to help remind right I know I'm guilty of that that's why I can say that because I'm guilty of it but my prayers a lord helped me to receive but instead to me there a man that just just be patient kind of under control then God and everything under control when God is given some teeth and God has given something to you you ain't got a worry buddy you gotta fret about it you just you just wait on it you just wait on hey man can I can I just read y'all a scripture this just my scripture a man this my scripture that I there's something that I'm holding on to and then we don't forget the announcements and everything else and very just praise the Lord and [Music] it's gonna be in the Book of Jeremiah three and we just violently I always get this mixed up I know it's in Jeremiah neither gotta find it here reduce and then I will service Jeremiah 32 Jeremiah 3241 Jeremiah 32 and 41 so what God gave me that bastard and shared with me that the only thing standing between my prayer being answered for every answer is just my level of patience and then think on the scripture baba says yay I will rejoice over them to do them and I will plant them in this assuredly with my heart and with my whole suit that's old in old today I don't want to get ahead of god I'm gonna get too far in front of a man I just want to just patiently wait for him to fulfill what he promised a man that's for our new church in school hey man we put that script to right in front of us say man so he's saying I'm plan us a man surely and all we got to do it just waiting he'll do it he's gonna be Joe solar so do as good without blaming us assuredly so that's what he said if he said it then he'll bring in two pence let's go with we have some announcements that I just need to make mention of a man and I got a a prayer request and will also appear for this morning's amen don't forget Amen brothers prayer this week at 7:30 Tuesday night at 7:30 to brother's prayer no service on this Friday a man we will be going down the fellowship with Brotherhood authority his meetings that will be happiness of this weekend the older brother Westco be preaching on Friday maybe I will also be preaching I'm sorry so anybody Joe under what would be having the concert there on Sunday night so that'll be happening this weekend it will be I've been a part of that also don't forget tonight there's a serviceability Beach at 6:30 for those that can make it brother moussaka from Paris will be preaching there and won't be chill tonight and we'll be starting our corporate fast a man we don't want to miss quality data fast because I want to give everybody the freedom to just do you know a lot with each or some might wanna do the data fast that's perfectly fine some may want to just pass like today maybe three o'clock or something like that you know and still want to eat what you don't leave a just fans some may want to do some you know some other types of faster soda juice only fast and you know whatever whatever way the Lord leads you we want to want you to be free to do that but we just want everybody to be involved in some type of fasting for those 21 days up to a man right before Easter our Easter services don't forget when this when that's coming and our services will have our Good Friday service with standard night service we will have a sunrise service we won't have prayer that morning of your sunrise service and then our regular service oh no I'm stunned once it happened during Easter but we try to do this amen every every year right before Easter 21 days we do it when they fast now the other thing the reason I was pretty is because everybody should be involved right when when Esther went forward and the King she asked for the entire nation to go on a fancy right she knew how serious this matter was and she said with everybody please just fast at least for three days for me right and I and I'm not saying don't eat no food for 41 days eat just fast if you do Dania fast you can eat all the time you just don't eat sweets and meats and treats and things like that but uh but you know justjust just try to find something that that will agree with your body and you know you say well my brother Jack I can't do it doctor doctor when the doctor when the doctor the man and the doctor asked people to fast you know they don't have that well Yes Doctor yes you can really have a serger they want you to fast before the surgery right you can't go in there where the food's coming and you have no problem you don't tell doctor my Medicaid so if God asks you to use the doctor all doctors all right so when he actions to do it everybody should be involved in Korver fans everybody finds something fast it's a part of our Christian a man to only do as Christians the action burrito Scripture Jesus saved Winky fast so jesus knew that we were gonna do it it sometimes I say wait you fast do it this way so so we know that this is a part of what Christians do when we want to do that so 21 days before Easter we'll get started and then start March 29th one through April 18th nice little celebration and then we'll do our Easter services but the week after that we're gonna have a church picnic we will give you more information about that but that'll be April 27th so put that on your calendar when we haven't having

thank you Father this hour in Jesus Christ in me free the Lord is good amen whenever the Lord it's been wonderful that the word each and every word there's actually only one free travel jack that features Jesus Christ because I've been looking at the continuity of the messages over the time that has been coming one will break into another to break into another to break into another and be coming I mean I don't know how to describe it whatever I'm said that the Word of God is like a roman candle when you you light one it explode and bring forth another candle it explode so I want to find out what is special about candle because we know candles when they Bend they kind of get consumed so what kind of candle does it you light it any breeze fold into another candle and another candle so when I read it look at a roman candle is not that Canada we use it's like an explosion something has got an explosive like a fishing bump when you throw one it was split and goes into a cascade of reaction and that is the word of God I was looking at the word of God from their brothers brother Dwayne but a Nathan rather poor but I Israel but a jack brother brother Jerry is where does add a little meeting the way it jumps into one another breaking from one another to one another and so under for how the law does say Amen because if the Holy Ghost is not a man because when God was delivered by Jack the other brothers were not they but the message was just breaking into one another it is wonderful man glory hallelujah I'm so blessed but a jack God bless you for the Apple message the lot is wonderful taste and see the goodness of the Lord amen if you don't test you will find it but when you test it and either Apple it become a fountain of life that flows within you so that their life is no longer you straggling but it's Christ in you who is living his life in you blessed be the name of the Lord permit me to sing a little song here to the word of the Lord I'm far away from being a singer but I'm trying to do a little a little melody praise be to God god bless america yesterday we were chatting stearic acid I mean I saw you having fun would you like to join I said I want to drive the angels away well you can make a lot melody to the Lord so I'm trying to make a melody to the Lord the song is called a grid I am in flesh today amen the great Elohim taking your sistine element taking potassium calcium putting them together and manifesting means often you is worrying your skin is wearing my skin is wearing your shirt and dress to manifest his glory and that is a great I am the great iron is here today the gray tire inflation man I am the great I yeah in time today they great I manifest in my day I am the god of their living my life today I'm wearing your skin I'm wearing your dress they greet you funny in plain view now I am the great I am in flesh today in Acts chapter 8 so persecuted Christians in our chapter 9 Jesus spoke to so so so why persecute me I am the great I am in flesh today the believers are me I am the believers we are God in flesh the great Elohim the celesia in time in plain view now the great I am expressing my love we are the great the body of Christ we are the servant I mentioned the mind eloheem we are the system in heaviness present are the great eye in flesh today I am the great I am the God of Abraham the great manifest in my book the great in Plainview now I am the great I in your heart today I am the god of the living manifest in my message for the Iowa today in your heart now I am the great I am who step in time the great I am is here today Amen praise be to God glory hallelujah that is a great I am that is the Lord Jesus Christ in EM today amen in Acts chapter 8 so when he was so when he didn't know the Lord when he was quaking he thought he was doing at a service of course had a mental knowledge of great Elohim the god of Moses who appeared to Moses who was in order prophet and his other people speaking something contrary to what he knew so he began to persecute them drag them to - I mean to their death and do whatever he wanted and one day a pillar of I appeared to him and a voice came from this light it says sauce so why do you persecute me and right away he began to realize that oh I thought I was going drink at a service God is speaking contrary to the law of Moses they were breaking the laws they were breaking the Sabbath so I was dragging them to court and killing them and persecuting them Lord I was the US service he said persecuting me Amen because they are me amen and I am them amen that is the same Elohim the same god of Moses the same God of Abraham the same God of Noah who has come down in the skin of his people amen so when you touch them you touch me the grid I am glory hallelujah and that message did something to brother Paul he turned from Saul to Paul he became a new man amen a brand new man in Jesus Christ and that is what we're gonna talk about we're gonna talk about Elohim personified the new birth amen Elohim personified and I try to look at a word personified it comes from the word person to impersonate to epitomize to embody to incan it to come in a human form so Elohim coming in human form is what he called the Holy Ghost baptism the new breath revelation of Christ is not something mysterious but it's a real person God Himself Elohim gritty turn add a few funny coming down picking your cysteine element my cysteine element and manifesting himself amen now let's take the human body and break it down because that is a thing that we know this human body that we see is just a lot of piece of earth amen it doesn't amount to nothing is made up of sitting element limbs if I can try to name them we are made up of cosmic lights and calcium Leblon just see if I can go in order amen we have cysteine element which is a cosmic cosmic light Bram said we are petroleum Petaluma has got four elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen so that is the first four elements then we've got some ions we've got some sodium we've got potassium we've got ion a magnesium calcium manganese then we got some negative ions as well that is the chlorine fluorine sofa and phosphorus iodine that is why sometimes student can be anemic when you anemic they give you pregnant women when when they pregnant they give them ion because it's part of the element of the body now when you take this body's about 65 to 85 percent water so when you bend somebody who is about six foot tall and as much as with a cigar when you bend a person is going to remain about just a spoonful of ashes that is what we can amount to as human beings the rest is gases the cannafest put and go back to the world to the cosmos so on the human side we are just one spoonful of ash that is what we are with it doesn't matter how much we clean this body it doesn't matter how handsome or how beautiful you are it doesn't matter how ugly you are that is about just one spoonful of ash that is all we amount you when you go to Asia India you know the about 2 billion 1 billion people so they don't have enough leads to bury people so when they die the increment and they bend them and they just put your ash in a battle for your grandkids and great-grandkids to come and not look at it though does just my grandad my great-great granddad one spoonful of ash so nothing that is the sister element we are made up of now when car let's go back to the man of God the Lord before the foundation of the world you are not cysteine element before the foundation of the world where Christ amen you were part of Elohim you were a China you are not a human flesh you were not asked you a celestial body you were a person before the foundation of what you existed not in this physical flesh but the celestial fish flesh amen that's luscious a person it has a voice is what body just like you it doesn't grow old it doesn't get tired it doesn't get confused it doesn't get attacked it doesn't scream it doesn't it can't get sick it cannot even die that is the true you amen so let's read some reboot of the scriptures let's read some quotes here to look at something here let's go to the church age book this man in charge an exposition of the seven th ages Desmond in church in book Nabu Brahma has given us the difference between the thought of God and our thoughts sometimes we can think of something let's say you want to go to Miami is it a which we can use is the i-90 95 south north south so you your plan is got your GPS everything go go you've map out I'm going to iron on i-95 south to Miami now you get there there was a student so they block the hole of i-95 now what do you do probably can use a local essence I don't know they had local SS here you have to reroute to somewhere else so your thought didn't manifest because of what condition of let's say accidental road block that is your thought and my thought but that is not a thought of God Lord Elohim has got only one thought that is Jesus Christ and nothing stood before his thoughts his thought is he and amen so let's go to the reading it it a not thought of God is there now watch carefully before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God Elohim was Elohim God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God he was only known as attend a spirit the bride was already in his mind and let's see the man of God yes she was she was assisting in his thoughts and what about those thought of God they are Atena are they not the eternal thought of God let me ask you at the thought of God it Atena if you can see this you see many things God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proving that already God is infinite and his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient he if his omniscient then is not now Lenin he doesn't add to his knowledge no is he taking counsel avail himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add it to knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient he doesn't know all things the best we could say is that sometime he will be that is in the future that is not Scripture he is only seeing he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has already had and always who have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God amen that's the thought of God are eternal they are real they are not simple like a man with the blueprints that he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real an antenna and a part of God amen so the thought of God is not just like a thinking something you have imagined here the thought of God is a substance the thought of God is the logos what is the logos the loco si did feel funny it is Elohim himself amen before you drop into the flesh you were a tenor you didn't even know what is and what isn't you didn't know about it what is salvation you don't know about it just like somebody who's never been to hospital before is always already always had a perfect health it doesn't know about the injection taking medication it's a mystery to that person so in that thought in that dimension you were perfect beyond even perfect so he didn't know what about Redemption we didn't understand so do la so don't worry one day I'm going to send you to the earth and you can understand Redemption so he sent Adam to the earth and jump in Adam he began to manifest himself the Lord tasted the earth he was worshipped he became God angels were worshiping him but he had more attribute of a severe of a redeemer of a king of a friend of a brother of a sister of a pasta but it was nothing there was no need at that time to manifest so he was only worship and having fellowship with Adam now to make him a Savior something has to be lost amen so he created man in a way he began to steadily me go back to electricity he wanted to have fellowship take literacy I don't know where we get a power house from I don't know here but then back in Ghana I know we get electricity from water and when you go to the power station if you try to get into it it will fry you and roast you and twist you so you can do that if you said I'm going to charge my cell phone take your cell phone you go to the power see and you want to connect it you're gonna get fried you're gonna get twisted so it's not gonna happen now this same electricity they bring it in the allotted Transformers in a high voltage if it's ok I'm going to check my click my cell phone or my my laptop on the big high voltage you're gonna get roasted and fried it's not gonna happen you can't do that okay this step it down further even to the powerhouse so it's a rocky I'm gonna charge my battery gonna cook my right take your rice cooker go to the power house I want to cook my rice here maybe the press could ask you I would want to say goodbye to the world if you plug it is gonna fry you a roost you and toast you but then the same electricity one day step it down to hear what 110 voltage in a British day you said to 220 now you can plug in your cell phones cook your rice do stuff do order you want use it for the organ and the instrument the same with a great antenna in all the Elohim integrity antenna when he manifests himself the whole earth would be will be going to an elation to nothingness if the glory of the Lord comes now he want to you want to generate this earth will be cooked are we or the planet or the universe could be splashed into nothingness that is how big he is so enough form there's not me can't even job into a human being look at even when in the time of Moses he came to us Elohim you can ask Jehovah Java means God with his family so he wanted to befriend a man so he stepped out even a lot of feather down and I appeared to Moose is the nature of Israel what happened it was is a Moses we cannot stand this because before he appears there was stand up it was so I mean so so horrible people were crying their faces down so Moises please go and talk to this guard and come and tell us because we can't stand it be good not that without Parrish so the lost are okay now I will come in the form of a prophet so he boarded a simple of fire murdered himself in a profit and job into Moses Moses acquainted with a pillar of fire on Mount Sinai and you come back his face the glory of the Lord shone in him even though one day they afterward cover Moses because the LOA the presence of Elohim was so glorious in him so they had to cover him to be able to speak to the trough Israel even has to step in software that down so the loss of our Moses you would have a prophet your brother Aaron will be a prophet so Moses who speak to the high priest Aaron then Aaron will step it down to the people I transform and now the people say ok the law said the Lord thy God is one don't have no other Idol ok yes Roger that in the military budget outside them do that so the Lord our God is holy do not contaminate yourself with idols Raja dad we salute you we're only taking the Lord is one God don't I mean love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and love your neighbor as yourself it's a Roger that I ticket Moses I believe it with all my heart so the logical step himself so down in a form of 110 voltage so that we cannot have connection with him glory hallelujah [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord so but then in his attribute as a severe because if when nothing is lost so he has to bring in this guy called Lucifer sit and as we know him to bring something that could be redeemed to cause a fall so Satan is doing his job as he was Odin to do amen sedan is not only to bring to bring salvation no he was Odin to bring destruction death and so that the Lord Himself will bring word Redemption and healing and transformation amen so when we were born we were not born three people istic Adam he was born by the spoken word of God Adam didn't have a mother he was born from the mouth of God amen Adam began to stab himself down to Eve who was what a little bit lower than him he was part of the spoken word but not all written as cooking Word of God so he stepped in so down now the Lord was trying to achieve something and now they were supposed to bring for their children just like their father Elohim by the speaking of the way by the preaching of the way but then that is where the Lucifer the devil came in and introduced introduce what he called sex what is sex look at the spelling of sex x s e x s represents satan e represent if X represent cross sit and Eve cross so it's rough God crossing by the spoken word [Applause] praise be to God so so Satan cross with Eve and that changed the program kind of chin the program instead of crossing with a spoken word sit and cross with Eve because it means mother of all he was supposed to be the mother of only sons of Adam and the sons of God but now there was a cross crossing with Eve has introduced something beyond the original arena plan of God but is forward for redemption seek so sit and eat cross now what happened when Satan crossed with Eve it brought forward sin what is sin s I n s represents Satan I in and nature sittin is now in our nature that is the way he injected himself into this earth because he want to express himself just as God was expressing himself you go back to Isaiah said the devil kind of ruse himself trying to be even more than Christ so you also cross with Eve to be able to manifest himself but he didn't know he was fulfilling the law of God he didn't know that he was making their way forgot to be a savior he thought it was something against the Word of God but he was paving the way that great Elohim will become a savior who manifests attribute amen just like that just like a sick person when you go to the hospital the doctor is happy he went to medical schools got a lot of loans to be almost a million so when you go to even if you do have a tooth ache is going okay we gotta put these teeth they pull your teeth so that he can have dollars to pay a student loan so you give that dentist some time that doctors do procedures that uh knows I'm in America for that or what happens doctors and pharmacists and nurses do procedures that is not necessary but I need their money they need the money from your Medicare what if whatever care to take care to run a hospital to run their business so when you bring your business they are happy for you I've got his patient the ticket teeth is okay you got a grill it Nexxus man come back they do some cleaning what do you do you pay money come back every I got to change these teeth I got to put something there so that is to give me a job to do so Satan was making a way for God to be a savior without knowing blessed be the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen the highest of heaven so now sit on has got himself in nature now let's go to the message praise be to God let's go to the nature sorry the message sauce that I in prison let me look at a flat graph so see imprisoned I think they have the okay lemme read from here they have it already blessed be the name of the Lord now let's see what happened what happened to the human race and what God was trying to achieve blessed be the Lord he is wonderful Amen so that I imprisoned is this awesome prison 1963 now paragraph 44 marami is talking about this so we made up of three things right a human body is a unit but and when you break it down you couldn't talk about the flesh that we see here when you go beyond the flesh you see the spirit then the spirit after the spirit see that the so now the body is just to contact the earth this flesh because it's part of the earth the potassium the calcium is what have fellowship with the earth now the spirit which is the next higher step is to be able to what control you look at me moving my hands is not my that is moving itself if I lay my my arms here they shed is not going to move but when I move the shell is gonna move so the same way this flesh system element has to have a spirit he must pray to control him so the humans but that has got constant memory affection imagination and reasoning con truce this flesh its giveth this it's got a control tower so the flood that you are thirsty good rains on water you need some race that is about the ethany it's going nothing to do with eternal life amen now the next higher step is the soul that is what God is working on the so is the highest control tower in the body the body the spread in the Sioux the soul is where your your destiny lives if I've got you're born again you have got the Holy Ghost then you are in heaven you are sitting in heaven right now but then if you are still in sit on if cross then you don't even know who you are you are so on the other side you are a sinner you haven't recognized yourself amen glory hallelujah so now there so let's read a little bit for the profit program 44 but the soul is that's who that is in the sea the soul is what God is working on see if he can get that nature desperate desperate to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies when we talk about the world is not talking about the moon the Stars is talking about Satan Satan is type as the world worldliness and Christ is top as the logos the weight so the world the love of the world the devil in in you in me before we're born again that is that is the love that you have the love of the world so if you love the world or the things although all the love of God is not in you the Holy Ghost is not in you see a man must be born again see this nature has to die and the nature of God comes in and lives in you and God is the only thing that there is the never did begin or never can end 45 so therefore he has partnership you allowed that way God is a businessman inform accompany he comes from eternity and from a company with assistant element less from a business company partnership for eternal life so he said he has partnership you see taking this everyman God reflected himself back in day he became a man when it became Christ Jesus he was God see God was in Christ lived in him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believed God and has asserted that become the perfection of him 35 now the so that I in prison so that are imprisoned the soul of a man is not a body of a man so the soul is not a flesh it's the soul and the soul is something that is the nature of the spirit let's keep that point the soul is the nature of the Spirit amen and then when the nature of a man when we are dead the scripture play little tells that we are dead and our lives are hidden God through Christ soon there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died when you are born again this body didn't die it wasn't your spray die or him as president died you so can go about and room about do whatever I need to do it was the nature of your spirit which is your soul which died see the nature which is the SU the nature of your soul is God if you are born again amen if it's not it's of the world anything that has a beginning has to end therefore the only way you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when we were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils you became a living soul otherwise when God put the human spirit in you and I've already had eternal life amen it was a few funny but then to be manifest on earth God by the spoken word spoke created a dust mote at him like 30 year-old man jump into it but in a human spirit to contact earth to control the earth to control the sistine element so he bred he stepped down from the high voltage tension to something like a transformer something lower then so that he can control Rudi's and relate creation or death amen so now the soul is what God is waking porn amen God is not trying to make you more handsome or more beautiful you can do that yourself amen what God has done for you yes already done for you God is not trying to make you more rich to make you get more money so they can buy a jet plane and take vacation go for a vacation plan no that is what a program of God but God's program is what to save you because bring a death and also bring a marriage we read some other quotation one instant by the nature I was in us true sit and eat Crossin a brought death in us and that word that death that spreaded in the zoo is permitted from God is tempura is not Atena so God comes in by the Holy Ghost baptism of fire consuming fire the message has been coming the fire of God comes in and consume it supernaturally you don't die physically you Slough you don't even know how it happens if you ask me when I was born again I don't know the precise date and time I don't have a clue it was a supernatural way that as you hear the word from brother Jack you hear from the ministers supernaturally without even you been conscious you realize that I've no longer the person I used to be first you wear only one foot person all that you know is the earthly things drink wake do the things that human beings do but then when the supernatural consume the old person consume the old nature of the spirit consume the old book consume the osoo then Christ comes in him comes in by the Holy Ghost baptism you begin to sit in Supernatural the angels of God began to manifest to you because you have become old the wife of the clean amen you have become mrs. Jesus Christ because in your flesh is inhabitant Tamplin the Holy Ghost temple in the below fire temple in the few funny temp the Elohim the Almighty God temple in Christ so wherever God is his word is holy so if I need to use this I'm gonna keep it clean if I don't need it I want to make a run out of it and I don't need it but as longer goddess in you you are holy holy on to the Lord you are gasps own righteousness amen you had a very profession of God remember a sinner human self we just spoonful of dust there's nothing good about us but when you partner got partners with you and then

love you do you want to marry me then you make that choice Lord I love you want to give all my life to you take my system element and do whatever pleases you and bring forth cooking we're children so God jumps into by the Holy Ghost baptism he quickens the seed amen because there's something new already there's a sit as a presentation in you but it has to have the quickening power amen just like a woman it one has got eggs but the one cannot bring four children without the life of the man in in hell amen yesterday I wanted to illustrate something and I Oh needed a magnet but a host we got me a magnet a bundle illustrate something amen sin wrap around this guy but he's going to see there some magnetism in him he doesn't even know she doesn't know he's a child of God he knows to smoke drink

what is this I would like to invite you to church god bless you and you could see the glory of God then they said we can do get quicken and there's something going on and it's a God loves you I want you to invite you to church come and hear the word of God or you share what of God with him that before the foundation of the world you are a daughter of God me I thought of God mmm I think it makes sense me how can I be a lot of God when I just came from club he said you have never been seen before Wow but I know I smoke I drink a car do these things then we could get down said there's something in you before the foundation of the world that if it a turn at of God was in you and we got to get closer you a child of God and getting closer closer then there's a quickening here we go [Applause] Elohim has got his daughter or his son who was in the house of hell who was a sinner who didn't know who she was or he was but now she's been madness to me to his father the Great Spirit come down and magnetize you partnership you partnership with you to become one with him so when you get magnetized to God you become omnipotent you become the spoken word of God you become the very expression of Jesus Christ the person of God is in you amen that is what the new bed that was all your sins are forgotten is no more God doesn't even remember you remember oh I did this I did that but your father doesn't remember it's not in the book of his memory he doesn't count it against you because your award you guys adopted sons and daughters of God amen but you have toward they're magnetized you have to taste this apple and I'm going to give a laceration amen when I was in San Antonio I used to do work as a as an instructor we teach a trained pharmacy technicians medical assistant dentists phlebotomist those who draw blood and so forth and many of our students were from different background those who went to college and they realized college wasn't for them so they want they want something hands-on somewhere from military I Afghanistan veterans and Iraq veterans they want to get a skills and so forth so we kind of build them to for success so we celebrate their success after each each each team whatever motto that they finish we celebrate them they do padlock we go to restaurant so one other time I student we were prepping for padlock and I let them choose whatever I want to eat you want to go to this Italian restaurant we want to do this we want to bring this food so they were planning what they want to bring and one of the student they kind of had this agreement so one wanted to go physical on the another students so we had to let my student take one student take her to the vehicle and then she went home in the night so I have what I call coach room so the next day when they come to school I said let's go to court we need to talk so when I said what happened talk about professionalism and everything why did you want to go physical on your fellow classmate just for disagreeing with hey what about you I work in a hospital where you going to punch your patient Sam Easter oh I don't know what happened but I saw that devil in me coming out last night I said that is good the first step in solving a problem is knowing the problem so if you see the devil in you but I said if you did hit her now the situation is escalated I could not handle it as cannot handle the police who come for you and arrest you go to jail they will lock you up is that no I don't to go to Jimmy Starr oh I've got a daughter I'm a single mom I moved from Louisiana to San Antonio to go to school to go to to do something why daughter and I said you're that student also is a single mom she move from North Carolina he had to go to school so I said what do you do about this devil in you and I said you want to give your life to God and I Bible for my student you want to read up Word of God I said mister I can't read Bible if I do that I'll betray my mom my mom raised me over witness so I cannot read Bible and so as you want to keep your mom's doctrine that you don't even practice and keep the devil in you now she realized she's got a devil in her and she said that that would this also this old nature manifesting even against her own world because you don't control yourself the soul is a control tower so if I'm not born again you can have the atmosphere of the word when you are sitting here you can that anointing will be on you but I when you get out there there must I tell you that also you think you are you are a Christian you think you a believer you a joker go get me some alcohol my old girlfriend I mean she loves you take a call call a take it from Colin do this or maybe better jack is going to see me I don't want my sister to see me no they're not going to see you do it in secret so then you do it in secret and you come back you feel condemned because that man is not dead it's all alive that husband is the one who is controlling you so you are not your cell phone you can be under the anointing of believers of a family and be so holy but then when you are by yourself then this guy comes out that I am the control tower do this for me go into prostitution for me don't even believe the message William Bramley is what he said is not truth because you had it intellectually amen but one day I am the grid I am that is I am draw senior let me use another example in the days of Abraham there was this young man a parents came to see Barbra ham it's about Abraham we do understand our son was engaged to a young sister but we don't know what happened he just left his young sister without even even telling nothing she doesn't like her no more sober Bram said I well your son need to be born again and of course parents our parents did they were upset about Braja that's a problem pastors face the repressive want to solve your problem you have said receive when it gives you the solution said no but a problem I'll make you to understand a son has been baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ in water baptism he has a good testimony in the church he's got his place abrupt saying yes your son is been baptized he's got a good example is not being a worldly person he heard the testimony in the church even a position a church but is that on Troy your son is born again advice that he doesn't touch a woman it doesn't marry because going to make a hell for that gift for that woman and for himself and so not a very begin to slow-dance a look you upon again and your wife is born again it is not you abram trace them to their roots that you a Germanic Germany pop wad they can stay at you and they don't respond they are indifferent Irish drunken fastens to win and killing African full of blood or distance all of us have got that nature through the Adamic nature sitting across in us so damaged I seen you but it's not nice and now is no longer your Irish Irish spirit and so your German is not your African is your American but it's your Christ in you [Applause] it is the Holy Spirit in you it is a new birth that has made you love any kind non suffering patient charitable rejoicing holy it is their cry see you by your son has got it all intellectual is a good persons tried to do something good but in his nature the old old nature he's not been regenerated he's not been been out he's not been consumed so that man is thought day and he doesn't even know how to say sorry he just left his girl just I don't want you no more and maybe the girls going through emotional pains and it doesn't mean nose to see sorry but he's religious he is a message believer what is the difference the difference is the Holy Ghost baptism amen glory hallelujah let me give another illustration when I was in high school I went to high school which is he's got a long history it was established by the British in 1876 it's an old Methodist school so when we go there and they give you a rain tation they tell you that don't just pass through the school let us go pass through you nothing as another sunny statement because there was a lot of things that we do in your school they teach you how to be a leader to be a gentle man how to approach your horizon broaden your horizon so many things so don't just go through the school without participate in activities join a club they have different ensigns right and a debating Club and the school has produced a lot of world leaders the first African United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan was went to the school so they tell you that be don't let the school don't pass through the school by ladies who pass through you don't pass through the message but let the message of the hour the Holy Ghost not just even passing through you but let it become you amen if you just go through the message oh yes I've been in a message for thousand years I Hunter William Brown it doesn't make no difference that was not afraid of that I'm the one dying heretic william brangham i was his shoes it doesn't make no difference I've been in the church I was I was there when bura bura bura Jack started a church that wasn't afraid of that it's a pack of history oh I'm a church member pay my tithe that is good that is a Christian I come to church every day is good but then if that death Christ has not been born in your heart then the life of Christ cannot be produced from your heart so jesus said he must be born again the new birth is the most important thing in the life of every believer amen when the Holy Ghost comes into you it consumes the old person it consumes the devil then recreates you or your ancestry the cases in your life or the demons of lying and all kind of demons consume them then recreates you then your spirit becomes get a new master get a new suit get cried Jesus in you get the Holy Ghost in you then your flesh has got a new boss now the boss in the house the occupant is a clean person if you go to a place that before--not tidy that does the place is all no tide is unclean unkempt but then when a new occupant a new a tenant goes any happy to please he tidied the place renovated please make everything brand new and God comes in and to undo what the devil has done destroy the old person and then bring back the original what you were before the foundation of the world because before the foundation of the world you ain't Christ if are not part of Christ you can't go to him and crisis a person that is Elohim personified in you amen let's read a little bit here glory hallelujah to the Lord the Lord is good blessed be the name of the Lord let's go to crisis revealed in his own word the mystery of God revealed 63 oh seven to eight let's read a bit the Lord is good alright let's go to paragraph paragraph 154 Christ is revealed in song word paragraph 154 now God wanted to have express himself completely programmatic efest to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church the church is not the congregation is you individual you and I in his check which is the body the bride so he could have the preeminence to express himself through them and thirdly to restore the kingdom to it's rightly position that fell by sin and by Adam back to where he worked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them and fellowship with them amen so God has got three purposes toward to express himself completely in Christ which he started doing from Adam on to this day but any want to have a personal relationship with you throughout their preeminence not ever have any preeminence not you have any preeminence not sitting having a preeminence not your ambitions and go have any preeminence but Jesus Christ the person of Christ won't have a preeminence in your system element amen by the Holy Ghost baptism Amen so that you become a partnership with him you become one with him and he walk in your earth to manifest is the glory hallelujah let's look at another scripture here let me read a data on Kaveri 60 on i-25 data on Kaveri paragraph 46 so there was a requirement for sin the requirement was death death was the panel see and this we could go into great details because I do not believe that is but one death there's one life and I believe a mother has eternal life can never die amen and I believe there's a complete and halation of the cidade sense for the Bible said that is Sudarsan it shall surely die not a man the Sioux doesn't it so Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed amen so that is what the Sudha's and they saw that drinkin is not a sin fornication is a lesson but the person that is you Satan they saw the old nature the nature of the Spirit the unbelief the unbelief is the root of some medicine in a person does it a sin the fornication that drunkenness is just an attributes of what comes out of he who that is in you so the Prophet preached a message he that is in you who is he that is in you is in Christ or is it the devil amen a little further from talking the message talking 60309 oh one and paragraph 82 say and now how could there be a more perfect sacrifice than God Himself becoming the atonement himself paragraph 83 because all of us were born by six sit and Eve cross and therefore the life that is in there is of the world and that life would not stand it's a thing that is already judged and condemned you can bring it before the Lord you can patch it up there's no way to patch it up there's no way to smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die amen and Eddie for that and a substitute a life of Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost gasps tooken that you have accepted the blood of His Son Jesus amen so the token is when God gives you the token it's just like a man marries a woman he gives a ring as a token so when God is married to as the first husband that ever dies out of us then Christ comes into us and he give you a token a ring what is the ring the Holy Ghost but Elohim personified in you Jesus Christ living in your letter F and what the RAM said what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism is it because you speak in tongues that is a gift is it because you prophesy that I give is it because I preach no but when you have a clear understanding of the way what can give you clear not standing it is the Holy Ghost in you which can give you a clay understand you don't have to know other ministries or in a Bible but you have a clear understanding of the word of god when god himself is personally reviewed in you because is what is a personal relationship Christ the eternal person partnership in you and you become a truthful beam you also a human being you Saguna being a human flesh but then there's apportioning you that is a supernatural that is Christ that is the eternal spirit that takes your flesh and become the flesh of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord let's read a efficient chapter - you haven't even read scriptures but we have read scriptures amen everything is a scripture here amen we are the living scriptures of God we are the Living Bible let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 okay vest 1 let's go he said and you have equation who were dead in trespasses and sins let's go to verse 2 where in in time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air who is the president of the a Satan desperate now works in the children of disobedience who is that Satan let's go on among whom also we had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and why and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others amen but God who is rich in mercy for his great mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us let's go forth even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved so now and have risen up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is the believers position amen sitting in heavenly places it doesn't mean that your system element is jumping into the skies no you're so right here by Christ in you the expression of glory amen you are sitting in heavenly places you know your position in Christ the devil cannot talk you out of it when you speak your word is no longer your weight your weight is what Christ manifest in his glory you have become the Temple of the Living God amen you are not afraid of physical death physical death is what is that transition to the other world because you're really in heaven amen look at her brother boss with he was an old man rich with vertebra ham so many years was dying in Bob Ram drove with his wife to see him and this man and his family were around laying in bed and a man rose up began to sing and it was written his mom and his family on the other side so we're I'm saying preposterous do you know you are dying and said how can I died I died long ago this is my glorification I can't die a Christian cannot die you can look at scriptures in their scriptures up into the eighth for all our sin and polish under the glory of God which is of sin is death even Jesus died that's the scriptures to the flesh to the human spirit but eternal present the true you has no beginning how can God died he only died in the flesh to a sieve mankind but a channel spirit Elohim the logos is eternal it cannot die and that is such a nice living right here that is doesn't grow old that doesn't agree here that doesn't cry doesn't get sick and that is who you are amen and if you can partnership your eternal person with the flesh nothing can stand before you amen Shari Shari writes and pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this piece of weird portion of eternity given to us Lord your what is a fountain father I pray that like a fountain of water that comes into s Lord thou wash all the forth that wash the old man is a fire that burns consume the devil and
