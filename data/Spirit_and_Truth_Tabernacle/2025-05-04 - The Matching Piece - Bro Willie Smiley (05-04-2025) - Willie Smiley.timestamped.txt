[16:03] Amen.
[16:04] Amen.
[16:09] Amen. My
[16:12] Jesus. I was reminded as the song was
[16:16] going forth of the story there in the
[16:19] scripture.
[16:21] Sarah and Abraham had not conceived a
[16:24] child in all their years of
[16:27] marriage. Uh but they got a visitation
[16:30] one day from Almighty
[16:32] God. Sarah was found laughing in the
[16:36] tent. Um the question was asked, "Is
[16:40] there anything
[16:42] too hard
[16:44] for the Lord?"
[16:47] You know, and and and when I read
[16:49] scripture, I don't recall Abraham or
[16:52] Sarah giving an answer to God's
[16:54] question. And sometimes God don't need
[16:56] your answer because he going to do what
[16:59] he said he going to
[17:02] do. Whether you doubt it or or not, God
[17:06] going to do what he said he going to
[17:10] do.
[17:12] Hallelujah. Blessed be his holy
[17:16] name. My God. My God.
[17:22] But as the children of
[17:24] Abraham, we can answer the question this
[17:26] morning. There is nothing too hard for
[17:30] our God. Come on, give the Lord a hand
[17:32] of
[17:35] praise. Oh
[17:38] my. Turn around and encourage somebody.
[17:41] Say, "There's nothing too hard for the
[17:43] Lord."
[17:46] There's nothing too
[17:47] hard for the
[17:50] Lord. Oh my. I don't care what you're
[17:53] going through. There's nothing too hard
[17:58] for the
[17:59] Lord. Nothing too hard for the
[18:03] Lord.
[18:07] My
[18:08] Hallelujah. Y'all be seated just for a
[18:11] moment.
[18:12] Amen. Amen. nothing too hard for the
[18:16] Lord. You know, it it's important to go
[18:20] to
[18:21] church. Um, you know, sometimes you go
[18:25] through things throughout the week and
[18:28] and uh and when you get here, uh, you
[18:30] know, you're going to get a word from
[18:32] the Lord. You know that.
[18:34] But sometimes uh songs that are
[18:37] selected, whether it's through song
[18:38] service or whether it's through a
[18:40] special uh the song that the Lord lays
[18:43] in somebody's heart is a song that just
[18:46] kind of pulls you to the next level.
[18:50] Amen. Of your praise, right? And and
[18:53] it's just something you're like, Lord,
[18:54] I'm leaving here encouraged. I'm leaving
[18:56] here strengthened. I I'm leaving here
[18:58] knowing that ain't nothing too hard for
[19:00] you. And as you go through the next
[19:03] week, you got something to carry
[19:05] you. Amen. You can ride the wings of a
[19:09] song. You can ride the wings of a word
[19:12] until it brings you right into the
[19:15] manifestation of your
[19:17] promise. Hallelujah. I say there is
[19:20] nothing too hard for the
[19:23] Lord. Now, now, now you see Satan to
[19:26] tell you that's too hard. Well, Satan, I
[19:28] ain't serving you.
[19:30] I serve a God that's bigger than all my
[19:33] problems, bigger than all my troubles, a
[19:36] God that's able to calm every storm in
[19:38] my life. Hallelujah. That's the God that
[19:41] I
[19:45] serve. My
[19:47] God. Thank you,
[19:49] [Music]
[19:51] Jesus. My
[19:55] my Oh, hallelujah.
[19:58] Amen. God bless you, Sister
[20:01] Shereice. Amen. For bringing that forth
[20:04] this
[20:06] morning. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[20:09] Oh
[20:10] my. Oh my my my
[20:13] my praise the
[20:15] Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[20:20] Um, as brother Solomon was mentioned, we
[20:23] had the opportunity last week to go and
[20:26] visit uh,
[20:28] brother um, Jean in the hospital. And I
[20:33] just
[20:36] um, my wife asked me said, "How come you
[20:38] didn't ask the brothers to go with you
[20:40] to visit Brother J?" I said, "All right,
[20:42] okay, let me do that." Put out a text.
[20:45] about four of the brothers met me there
[20:47] at the hospital and um and while we were
[20:51] there and his brother saw him said,
[20:53] "Brother Jean, my God, the man was in
[20:56] his bed, but the way he was talking, I
[20:59] felt like brother Wesco was talking to
[21:02] me. I felt like brother Wesco was
[21:05] talking to
[21:06] me." That man say the devil's a liar
[21:10] and and he ain't going to get no victory
[21:12] here. He tried.
[21:16] say, "But that devil's defeated." I
[21:18] said, "My God, he encouraging us."
[21:24] But we, it just so we had it, we had uh
[21:27] Brother Solomon and Brother Maris and uh
[21:30] Brother Troy and Brother Jerry uh join
[21:32] us. So I said, "Well, we'll let the song
[21:34] leaders go in and sing a few songs, then
[21:37] let the preachers come in and pray over
[21:39] him and and uh and we just just
[21:41] ministered to him in that way." And you
[21:43] know, while we were there, uh, at the
[21:46] hospital, uh, Brother Troy, uh,
[21:48] mentioned, uh, I want to say about a
[21:50] month ago about a a friend of his, old
[21:53] friend of his that had a motorcycle
[21:55] accident. And, uh, he was still there at
[21:58] the hospital, you know, waiting to be
[22:00] released to go home. And he was on
[22:03] death's door. Uh, but God brought him
[22:05] back and it's brought him given him
[22:07] another chance. He he lost a leg in this
[22:10] accident, but nonetheless, he still has
[22:13] life. And um praise the
[22:17] Lord. So we just joined brother Troy and
[22:21] went in there uh into the room with him
[22:24] and he said, "Man, I had all the guys
[22:25] from the the motorcycle club come up
[22:27] here and they turned them all away. They
[22:28] wouldn't let them through, but they let
[22:30] all of us through. So we got in and we
[22:32] just talking to him and you know just
[22:34] encouraging him a little bit there and
[22:36] just tell him say you know you got
[22:37] purpose that's the reason you still here
[22:39] cuz he had two accidents this year
[22:41] already and I said God got a purpose for
[22:44] you being here and I said it's time for
[22:46] you to seek God regarding that purpose
[22:48] that he has for you. And uh and and and
[22:51] I I looked at him I said I just feel to
[22:54] say to you your best days are ahead of
[22:56] you not not behind you. best days are in
[23:00] front of you. And uh we're just trusting
[23:03] that the Lord would just anchor that
[23:04] into his spirit and uh cause him to
[23:07] catch faith and and and believe that
[23:08] this will be a turning point. Amen. For
[23:11] for for him in his life. And uh but we
[23:13] were grateful for the opportunity just
[23:15] to kind of go. And I just heard a sermon
[23:17] my brother my son-in-law had preached on
[23:19] witnessing 101. And uh he just preached
[23:22] that uh last I think last Sunday. And
[23:25] I'm like, well, I don't never heard it
[23:27] like that. But yeah, we all need to take
[23:30] advantage of the opportunities we have
[23:32] to share Christ with somebody else. So I
[23:35] I say I I had to put that in action,
[23:37] witnessing 101. So So we thank God for a
[23:40] successful visit uh to the hospital.
[23:43] Amen. We we thank God for that. Praise
[23:46] the Lord. Um I also just want to make
[23:48] mention I I I got when we had not made
[23:51] an announcement, but I think it'll be
[23:52] good. Uh, I understand they're trying to
[23:55] do a fellowship for the sisters. Amen.
[23:58] Here in the church, a fellowship for the
[24:00] sisters. And and I know that there's
[24:01] some information been passed around. I
[24:03] want to encourage our sisters. Y'all get
[24:06] connected. Amen. This how we keep the
[24:08] devil out of our midst. Amen. We go out
[24:11] of our way and we fellowship one with
[24:13] the other. Amen. I think uh brother
[24:16] brother uh Quinton was kind of talking
[24:20] about that how we have to have unity in
[24:22] the body. Amen. Those not just words
[24:25] just kind of go in one ear and out the
[24:26] other but really we need to look for
[24:28] opportunities that we can get together
[24:30] and fellowship. And I think they want to
[24:32] have everybody go to some type of salt
[24:35] room. Yeah. Salt room. Sisters just sit
[24:39] there and get
[24:41] salt. But
[24:45] [Music]
[24:46] Amen. The sisters say it's nice. They
[24:49] say they enjoy it. I think y'all enjoy
[24:51] yourself. And and you if you want that

[30:10] Amen. I tell you, we had a a real
[30:13] wonderful time on last week. It's been
[30:15] some time since we going to be looking
[30:16] in the book of uh St. Mark chapter 16.
[30:22] Uh we had a real wonderful time there
[30:24] with brother Larry. They on the other
[30:26] side of the
[30:28] world, I tell you. But uh we had a good
[30:32] good time. It's been some years since
[30:34] we've been there. Some things has
[30:36] changed a little bit, but uh God really
[30:40] uh used us to speak some things to the
[30:43] saints there and just have some
[30:45] discernment and to just kind of educate
[30:48] folks on certain things also and and
[30:51] that's a blessing. And I was thinking um
[30:55] you know I appreciate the brothers for
[30:57] their prayers. I I don't I don't think
[31:00] that uh the services would be what they
[31:04] are if I didn't have somebody praying
[31:06] for me. I'm I'm reminded of Brother
[31:10] Brandham having sisters praying and uh
[31:13] you know um one thing I I can say um if
[31:18] anything's happening I got confidence in
[31:21] these brothers uh prayers behind it.
[31:26] Praise the Lord. And uh this week my my
[31:29] mom, you know, she's getting older this
[31:32] uh in a couple of weeks she'll be 84 and
[31:35] she had a problem maybe a month and a
[31:38] half ago and she's been kind of going
[31:39] through ever since and she she gets okay
[31:43] and then she goes under and you know I
[31:46] was I was preaching on a little subject.
[31:48] Um I'm I'mma let you be seated. Y'all
[31:50] going to be all right if I keep talking
[31:52] for a minute or do I need y'all to be
[31:54] seated? Y'all be seated for a second. I
[31:58] hate to get you bouncing up and down
[31:59] because I know I I can't bounce up and
[32:01] down like that. When I stand, I like to
[32:04] stand, but uh I just feel bad just
[32:08] watching you stand while I'm just
[32:10] talking. I ain't read. I ain't did
[32:12] nothing. But uh I I did just want to say
[32:15] uh she
[32:16] she I don't know what went wrong. She
[32:19] had an infection in her stomach. That
[32:21] was the main problem. And uh she's
[32:24] getting older. She's losing her memory a
[32:27] little bit. Uh she repeats herself a
[32:30] lot. And um but when I was I I was
[32:34] thinking about something when when they
[32:36] sent me out a text. I was on my way to
[32:38] work or I had got to work before I seen
[32:40] the text and said that they had already
[32:43] taken her to the hospital. And I was
[32:46] thinking about what I preached up at
[32:48] brother Larry's. And I was talking about
[32:51] the brothers on uh on their way to um uh
[32:56] the other side there and uh uh awakening
[33:01] Jesus was the topic of the message and
[33:04] uh you know when trouble comes and
[33:07] that's not my this morning's message not
[33:09] less he turned it into it but when when
[33:12] trouble comes what's our reaction
[33:16] right come on and and immediately I said
[33:19] this just the devil. All right. You you
[33:22] having revival and you doing good and
[33:24] everything and then all of a sudden
[33:26] trouble come.
[33:29] Yeah. And then it's like what's your
[33:31] reaction? And you know my reaction was
[33:34] I'm not going to panic. This the devil.
[33:36] I already see it. It's it's you know
[33:39] regardless of what she's thinking.
[33:41] That's right. You know whose report am I
[33:44] going to believe?
[33:46] I'mma believe the report of the Lord. I
[33:48] don't care what it look like.
[33:51] Now, when it's her time to go, she's
[33:53] going. But, you know, as far as I was
[33:55] concerned, it was like, you know, this
[33:57] just the devil. I'm I'mma just I'mma be
[34:01] like Jesus. I'mma be at rest. All right.
[34:04] I'mma be at rest. I'mma be at peace.
[34:07] It's It's going to be all right. That
[34:10] That's what my spirit was telling me.
[34:12] So, I was I was just kind of walking in
[34:15] obedience to what the spirit of God was
[34:17] telling me. And uh they figured out she
[34:21] had an infection and they ended up
[34:23] sending her home Friday. And uh I I went
[34:27] up and uh she was getting around good
[34:29] like nothing was happening. A few a few
[34:32] weeks ago, my mother couldn't even walk
[34:34] without a walker. Wow. And just to see
[34:38] her walking without a walker. Well, I
[34:41] felt I felt good.
[34:44] I I I really I really did. I I felt good
[34:47] to see how far God has brought her.
[34:51] Right. So, let us stand and we'll we'll
[34:53] move on. But I appreciate I I just want
[34:56] the brothers to know how much I
[34:58] appreciate and how much I have
[34:59] confidence in y'all uh prayers behind
[35:03] anything that I'm doing. Amen. So, so I
[35:07] just said to myself, when I'm going out,
[35:09] I'll just have them praying for me.
[35:11] Amen. Because I I I need it. God has
[35:14] been blessing me and flying. I hadn't
[35:17] over the years been flying that well.
[35:20] But uh my last leg when I landed in West
[35:23] Palm Beach, I stood up too fast and I
[35:26] got dizzy and I sat down and I said,
[35:28] "It's just the devil." Cuz my flights
[35:31] has been been a blessing. and I done
[35:33] lost some weight and and I'm feeling I'm
[35:36] feeling a lot better and uh so y'all
[35:39] just continue to pray for me. We got uh
[35:42] couple of services uh in two weeks and
[35:46] then in June so far and we just trying
[35:49] to move forward.
[35:52] Um Mark 16 and 15, y'all pray for us.
[35:57] appreciate brother Jack
[35:59] for this opportunity and thank God God
[36:03] has brought him and his wife 32
[36:07] my grandmama used to say odd
[36:09] years 32 odd
[36:12] years we appreciate him uh and it the
[36:16] 15th verses says and he said unto them
[36:20] go ye into all the world and preach the
[36:22] gospel to every creature he that
[36:24] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[36:27] saved. But he that believeth not shall
[36:30] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[36:33] them that believe in my name. They shall
[36:35] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[36:38] new tongues. They shall take up
[36:40] serpents. And if they drink any deadly
[36:42] thing, it shall not uh hurt them. They
[36:46] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[36:48] shall recover.
[36:51] And so then after the Lord had spoken
[36:54] unto them, he had was received up into
[36:56] heaven and sat on the right hand of God.
[36:59] And they went forth preaching everywhere
[37:01] the Lord working with them and
[37:04] confirming the word with signs
[37:07] following. Amen. Let us bow our heads.
[37:10] Gracious Father, we just thank you this
[37:11] morning for
[37:14] um just allowing us to be here and and
[37:17] just being with my mother uh and just,
[37:20] you know, just taking care of her, Lord
[37:22] Jesus. She's getting older, but Lord,
[37:26] she's still fighting. And so we
[37:28] appreciate the fight that's in her
[37:30] spirit, Lord Jesus. Uh she's just
[37:33] determined to continue to press the
[37:34] battle. Lord, Lord, we just thank you.
[37:37] We appreciate you. We appreciate the
[37:40] opportunity, Lord. Help us to just kind
[37:42] of uh just get under the same spirit.
[37:46] Lord God, I was thinking about if if we
[37:49] could get under the same anointing and
[37:53] spirit and atmosphere that the prophet
[37:55] was under when he preached this little
[37:58] thought u from the masterpiece in
[38:00] different places. Lord, we we know that
[38:05] you'll you'll just help us. So we we're
[38:07] trusting in you this morning. We pray
[38:09] that you have your way in Jesus name.
[38:11] Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Um I want
[38:14] to preach a little subject that's just
[38:16] kind of been on my heart for uh a couple
[38:19] of months. I was I a lot of times I'm
[38:23] I'm at work and and I'm I'm listening to
[38:26] tapes. Thank God for technology. I have
[38:29] a little earpods in. And while they be
[38:31] listening to all that crazy stuff, I be
[38:34] listening to to a little message because
[38:37] I be needing something to just kind of
[38:39] keep my
[38:41] spirit my spirit intact
[38:45] cuz you know out there in the workforce,
[38:47] boy, I tell you, they be pushing you and
[38:51] I don't want to start pushing back.
[38:54] That's right. So, I be I be trying to I
[38:56] be trying to just be cool and and calm
[38:59] and collected. So, I'll be listening to
[39:02] a message, but I was listening to the
[39:04] message of uh uh the masterpiece.
[39:08] And and you know, I I was telling the
[39:11] saints last week, I said, "We can't
[39:13] exhaust God." Um I know sometimes we
[39:17] might feel like, man, I've listened to
[39:19] that message. I have. I've been
[39:20] Christian for 37 years. Yeah. I don't
[39:23] know how many times I've listened to the
[39:25] message of Masterpiece. I don't know how
[39:27] many times I've preached from the
[39:29] message of Masterpiece. But every time I
[39:32] go back to the message of Masterpiece,
[39:35] uh it's always illuminating.
[39:38] It's it's it's always illuminating for
[39:41] me. That's always just, you know, and it
[39:43] don't take nothing but a little
[39:45] something and then it just takes the
[39:47] inspiration of the Holy Ghost. But I
[39:49] want to use as a little topic this
[39:51] morning the match the matching piece.
[39:55] The matching piece and uh as a subtopic
[39:59] redemption claims. Amen.
[40:02] Um uh let me let me just start it out
[40:06] this way this morning. I want to maybe
[40:08] get a background and read you some
[40:10] quotes. Brother Brandham, you know,
[40:12] Brother Brandham tells a lot of stories
[40:14] in in the message and you know, you
[40:17] could read over them. You could listen
[40:19] over those stories sometimes, but if you
[40:22] do, I tell you what, you'll miss a whole
[40:24] lot of substance when when you do that.
[40:27] So, Brother Brandham, he's he's
[40:29] preaching from the message of
[40:31] masterpiece and and he gets down he gets
[40:34] down in the message and he starts to
[40:36] talk about the Chinese uh laundry man.
[40:41] Y'all ever heard that that part passage?
[40:43] So he says, "Like many of you men and
[40:46] women my age, uh we used to uh have
[40:49] around the country a lot of Chinese."
[40:52] All right. He says, "And when the the
[40:55] Chinese first started in, they come from
[40:58] the west coast moving eastward, coming
[41:00] over from the eastern country, moving
[41:03] this way." And as they did, they were a
[41:06] people who who weren't acquainted with
[41:09] our language and our ways, but they were
[41:12] fine laundrymen. Right. Right. Now, I
[41:15] don't know about that cuz we I grew up
[41:17] where we had black folk cleaning our
[41:21] clothes and stuff. They was the
[41:23] laundryman. I guess that was for my
[41:25] time.
[41:27] Uh I I just don't remember the Chinese
[41:31] men. But he said that was during his
[41:34] time. And if he was still alive, he'd
[41:37] probably beund and something years
[41:39] old. But by the time we Well, I guess
[41:43] his time was my time cuz in ' 65 I was 3
[41:46] years old. But that's still for my time.
[41:48] I ain't know that. I was still running
[41:50] around with dirty diapers on or
[41:54] something. But he says, "And as they
[41:56] did, they were were people who were not
[41:59] acquainted with our language and and our
[42:01] ways, but they were fine laundrymen, and
[42:05] they couldn't write uh a ticket so you
[42:09] could get your laundry
[42:11] back." But the chineman, he got himself
[42:15] a bunch of little cards with nothing on
[42:17] it at all. So when you come for your
[42:21] laundry, now
[42:22] now this is when you come to
[42:26] redeem, make claims on what's yours, he
[42:30] had a provided way, right? that there's
[42:34] there's and I was I was thinking about
[42:36] this because because when when I
[42:39] appreciate the you know when I run
[42:41] across these things I I I appreciate the
[42:44] prophet more and more because of of his
[42:47] his thought patterns and the things that
[42:51] uh he brought out to benefit us because
[42:54] you know going to church as a young man
[42:56] these pre these principles and precepts
[42:59] we couldn't comprehend. That's right.
[43:02] Right. We just we just kind of went to
[43:04] church from a a traditional standpoint.
[43:07] And I went to Sunday school and I did a
[43:09] lot of different things and I heard a
[43:10] lot of sermons and things of that nature
[43:13] as as a young man. But uh there's so
[43:17] much man that I did not understand until
[43:21] God start opening up the word of God to
[43:24] us.
[43:26] Right. And showing us important
[43:29] principles,
[43:31] right? Yes, sir. Cuz these things are
[43:33] important for us as Christians also,
[43:38] right? Glory to God. So he said he got a
[43:40] bunch of little cards with nothing on
[43:42] it. So when you come back for your
[43:44] laundry, he would take this card and
[43:47] tear it in a certain way. Yeah. And hand
[43:50] you one piece and he kept the other
[43:53] piece. Now it's a little better than
[43:57] what we have now. He said because you
[44:00] come back uh to claim what's your
[44:04] own. He says those two pieces must
[44:09] Right. Right. I'm going to go somewhere
[44:11] here. They must dovetail.
[44:16] Right. Right. It's something that you
[44:18] can't get around. Right. They they must
[44:21] dovetail. He's Now this we going to go
[44:23] somewhere with this next statement. You
[44:25] can't impersonate it.
[44:28] Right? You
[44:30] cannot see and then you follow brother
[44:33] Brandham through his message and the
[44:35] things that he preached impersonation of
[44:37] Christianity. There's so much
[44:39] impersonation going on today,
[44:42] right? It's so much
[44:45] impersonation that's going on uh today.
[44:49] In the book of Acts, chapter 19, you
[44:52] know, it it was it was the sons ofKeva,
[44:56] right? The seven sons ofKea. Amen. They
[44:59] they were impersonating in Christianity.
[45:04] Right. They wasn't genuine Christians.
[45:07] They they were they were
[45:10] impersonators, right? And and the evil
[45:12] spirit say, "Well, wait a minute. Jesus,
[45:15] I know.
[45:17] Paul I know
[45:20] don't know you
[45:23] I boy we don't know we I jumped on them
[45:26] and whooped
[45:28] them they took a whooping and I'mma tell
[45:31] you something this is the reason why a
[45:34] lot of people take a whooping around
[45:36] church because they ain't genuine
[45:39] bornagain Christians they they
[45:42] impersonating Christianity
[45:45] Glory to God.
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:48] That was that was impersonating the man
[45:50] the evil spirit whooped up.
[45:54] Took a They took a pounding.
[45:58] You ever been You ever been in a fight
[46:00] where you had the feet? Don't fail me
[46:04] now. You taking a pounding? I don't know
[46:08] if I ever really got one of them. All
[46:10] right. Now I I think I did. My my
[46:13] cousin, he was older than me. Boy, we
[46:16] fought all the way from the boys club
[46:18] down the street. Boy, I backed in a
[46:21] corner and I like loud why I have to run
[46:24] in here. Boy, he hit me in the eye so
[46:27] hard. I fell down, but I knew I had to
[46:30] get up. Well, I saw stars. I said, "Man,
[46:33] stars ain't just for
[46:36] cartoons. This
[46:39] real, man." Let me read a couple of
[46:43] quotes, man. Brother Brandham, he he
[46:46] says,
[46:47] uh, these
[46:49] people impersonating
[46:52] Christianity, living like the world,
[46:55] running around to every kind of place,
[47:00] uh, are at to be belonging to church and
[47:04] calling themselves Christians, but but
[47:07] they're not Christian. That's in um
[47:09] great warriors of Joshua
[47:11] 1955, right?
[47:14] 1955 fellowship through the redemption
[47:16] of the blood. He said to go to church
[47:20] impersonating Christianity,
[47:23] acting like Christianity. All right.
[47:26] Right. Pay the tithes. Wow. Yeah. Wow.
[47:29] Yeah. Jesus. Amen. Living good in the
[47:33] community, not just really bad people.
[47:35] Right. Right. But except that a man's
[47:39] born again, he will never raise in the
[47:42] resurrection.
[47:43] And see what makes you what makes you a
[47:47] you can be a member of this church by
[47:49] just paying your tithes and offerings
[47:51] and having your presence. That don't
[47:53] even make you a Christian,
[47:56] right? H how many people that's going to
[47:58] church this mornings uh this morning not
[48:02] really Christians not not born again but
[48:05] they they support the church with they
[48:07] they their they tithes and offerings and
[48:09] they presence they just some good could
[48:12] be just a good member but you'll never
[48:15] raise like that right right you you just
[48:19] to say it earlier you'll never be able
[48:22] to match that piece like that glory to
[48:26] Amen. Amen. See, we we want our own own
[48:31] principles and and different things. I I
[48:35] wrote down a statement when I was
[48:36] studying. Um see it it can't be
[48:40] something
[48:41] uh amended.
[48:44] Right. Right. Which we can see that in
[48:47] Christianity
[48:49] around Christianity, not true
[48:52] Christianity.
[48:54] Right. for this day. Yeah. It's it's an
[48:56] amendment amended thought. Right. Right.
[49:00] Glory to God. Amen. It's an amended
[49:02] thought. The word the the word has been
[49:05] altered in so much. It don't take this,
[49:07] it don't mean that. It don't take this
[49:08] and it this that and the other and y'all
[49:11] guys would, you know, which is this old
[49:13] time. But well, give me that old time
[49:15] religion. Amen. G give me that, you
[49:20] know, that that they had, you know,
[49:23] well, no, let me back up. Let me think
[49:26] about that. It's got to go all the way
[49:29] back to the beginning. That's right.
[49:32] Right. Because Pentecost was good. Yeah.
[49:36] Right. It's so close that if it was
[49:40] possible,
[49:43] right? That's right. Now, that's true.
[49:45] and and pent Pentecost Pentecost was the
[49:48] closest thing to the original church.
[49:53] But but uh the thing that they were
[49:56] missing, right? Um they was missing the
[50:00] the revelation of the word and tying
[50:05] scripture with scripture and word upon
[50:07] word, line upon line, and precept upon
[50:09] precept. Right? And that's why we needed
[50:13] what we needed for this hour. True.
[50:16] Right. Amen.
[50:18] So that when when when those two pieces
[50:21] come together, they'll dovetail.
[50:23] There they'll be a matching piece,
[50:26] right? So it it it can't be some amended
[50:30] word. A requirement must be met. See, we
[50:35] we got to be a Bible bride. That's
[50:38] right. Amen. Some churches Bible
[50:40] believers and and that's the truth.
[50:43] That's just that's just not a name on
[50:45] the church door. We got to be a Bible
[50:48] blind and we still we still moving.
[50:50] Right.
[50:52] Amen. Amen. So
[50:55] So it's no impersonation to
[50:58] this. Running around's good and all of
[51:01] the things that people do that's good.
[51:04] But you know those things, you know, you
[51:07] could try to impersonate. But watch
[51:09] this. I'm I'm gonna get to this quote
[51:11] here in a second, right? He says in in
[51:15] in Hidden Life
[51:17] 19505, he says impersonating
[51:21] Christianity, trying to do something to
[51:24] act like Christians.
[51:27] All right. He says it that won't work,
[51:31] friend. Right.
[51:34] That won't work. God knows that. The
[51:37] devil knows it. The devil knows the sons
[51:40] of Skea. Like, boy, y'all ain't real
[51:42] Christians.
[51:44] Glory to God. We see the devil know when
[51:47] you genuine.
[51:50] He know a genuine Christian. Amen. He
[51:54] say the devil knows it and the people
[51:56] knows it.
[51:59] Glory to God. Glory to God. And and and
[52:02] it's no it's no need to be something
[52:04] that you're not. Glory to God. See the
[52:09] the the and I'm going I'mma get there,
[52:11] but I'm going say it before I get there.
[52:13] That's why you got to be born again,
[52:16] right? Be because you you can't be some
[52:20] other bird putting some other kind of
[52:22] feathers in there. That's an
[52:24] impersonation.
[52:26] Right. Glory to God. Right. See, sheep
[52:29] sheep just bears wool, right? Glory to
[52:32] God. Amen. So, so you just got to be
[52:36] from the beginning from the original an
[52:40] original seed and and what'sever there
[52:43] will come forth. Yes. Right. Where where
[52:46] you won't have to try to impersonate
[52:48] something, try to be something that that
[52:51] you're not.
[52:53] See that, man? That's hard. My God,
[52:56] that's all trying to be something that
[52:58] you're not. Glory to God. Amen. Just be
[53:02] who you are. I I've learned something,
[53:05] church. We ain't Ain't none of us
[53:07] perfect.
[53:09] Not me, not you. Not nobody. None of us
[53:14] is perfect. Glory to God. The thing is,
[53:18] we're born again and God is adding to
[53:22] us,
[53:24] right? God God is adding to us.
[53:28] The life is there and it takes God to
[53:32] build that life by the word. Amen. Is
[53:36] that right? No matter how emotional
[53:39] y'all get,
[53:41] you can feel good and feel good in the
[53:43] spirit and and
[53:46] right something happened and you you'll
[53:48] act just a little bit unseemly.
[53:50] [Music]
[53:52] Glory to God.
[53:54] That's me and anybody else. All right.
[53:58] Cuz cuz you know you rub the cat, you
[54:00] rub the cat the wrong
[54:09] [Music]
[54:12] way. and all that and you rub it the
[54:15] wrong way.
[54:18] So, let's not rub it. Let's not let's
[54:21] make sure we rubbing the kitty the right
[54:24] way cuz we want the fangs to come out. I
[54:27] am not a cat lover. I do not like cats
[54:30] for that
[54:31] reason, man. A cat cat you be walking
[54:35] by, they just jump on you for no reason.
[54:38] They say dogs is man's best friend.
[54:43] If I had to have one, give me a dog.
[54:46] That That's no slide to cat lovers. You
[54:48] love what you love. I just I ain't never
[54:50] cats just seem like they attack
[54:53] me. Amen. But he said the devil knows it
[54:56] and the people knows it. He says you got
[54:59] to be genuine.
[55:02] You've got to be original. Praise God.
[55:06] Amen. You got to be That's right. Right.
[55:10] just important statements because
[55:12] especially especially this hour you know
[55:15] brother Brandham he made a statement
[55:17] years ago and we probably couldn't have
[55:19] grasped it when he said the Pentecostal
[55:22] church in a hundred years man look at
[55:24] look at the church now
[55:27] I was I was looking I was looking at I
[55:30] was looking on Instagram the other day
[55:32] and this real pro prominent uh pastor
[55:37] man I like I just couldn't sit under
[55:40] these people just there ain't no way he
[55:42] got braids in his head going around.
[55:47] And dude
[55:48] had a
[55:50] yellow feminist looking blouse on with a
[55:55] little cut off church uh shirt with some
[55:59] baggie.
[56:01] I like bro and I just you know sometime
[56:04] I be trying to keep my mouth closed but
[56:06] I can't contain myself in the comments
[56:09] you know I read comments sometime and I
[56:12] just wrote you know the spirit of a man
[56:16] would would would would just say no
[56:22] right
[56:25] [Applause]
[56:27] the spirit this the masculinity
[56:31] Spirit of a man will say, "No, I can't
[56:34] wear this. Take that back from where you
[56:37] got that from."
[56:40] Because because because I'm I'm the
[56:42] standard,
[56:44] right? I supposed to be the standard. We
[56:47] wonder why where all these spirits
[56:49] coming from and all that. It's the
[56:51] people that's up front
[56:54] that these these young guys is looking
[56:56] to. Well, well, if pastor pastor he
[57:00] married and everything and he if he
[57:02] could wear that, pastor shouldn't be in
[57:04] that. He I mean he a big dude. He big as
[57:08] I used to be. Come slipped down some.
[57:11] And I but I looked at that I was like
[57:13] better hand it right. I couldn't help
[57:15] it.
[57:17] I just couldn't help it. It's like man
[57:20] the spirit I'm tell you all my life even
[57:24] before becoming a Christian a spirit on
[57:28] me would be like no don't wear that
[57:32] don't do that
[57:34] don't do that don't go there
[57:38] you know it ain't even nothing wrong
[57:40] with this ain't even nothing wrong with
[57:42] this I remember when I was in high
[57:43] school and I wish I would have really
[57:44] learned how to type but uh I had got in
[57:47] a typing class cuz I needed an elective
[57:50] and I got in that class and that class
[57:53] worried
[57:54] me. That class worried me till I got out
[57:57] that class. I say the fellas ain't going
[57:59] to like me, you know, cuz it it's a it's
[58:01] a it's a MS type thing. It's a MS thing,
[58:05] you know. I'm a I'm a I'm a athlete and
[58:08] I'm hanging with the the fellas, the
[58:10] hootlams, you know, and I'm like, boy,
[58:12] they pass by here and see me in there
[58:16] pecking on them keys. Boy, for 4 years,
[58:21] I'm not going to be able to live that
[58:22] die. Every time there's a joke, boy, I
[58:26] smile walk out and I see you smile
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] in and I got out that class. But there's
[58:35] nothing wrong with it. But but that's
[58:38] just it's just the way that I'm I'm
[58:41] wired.
[58:43] So So even now it's it's things that you
[58:46] know I'm like, "No, I can't wear that.
[58:49] That's that's pushing it.
[58:52] That's the spirit, the masculine spirit
[58:55] that's in me be like, "No, I don't care
[58:58] what they doing out there.
[59:01] No, I can't I can't wear that cuz I at
[59:04] all time want to look like a man, act
[59:06] like a man,
[59:08] talk like a man, walk like a man, right?
[59:12] So So I don't want to wear that, you
[59:14] know? So when I saw him looking like a a
[59:16] big bird slash whatever that was, I was
[59:19] like, bro, you you can't tell me a
[59:23] person like that got the Holy Ghost.
[59:25] That's right. He might have a gift to
[59:29] preach. Yeah. The Holy Ghost if the the
[59:33] God in a prophet would would would keep
[59:36] him from certain things, the God in us
[59:39] will keep us from certain things. That's
[59:42] a brothers and sisters, right? Amen. You
[59:46] know, cuz what a day we living in where
[59:49] sisters are b women are borderline, not
[59:51] sisters in the church, but y'all know
[59:53] what I'm talking about, right? It it it
[59:56] ought to keep keep you from certain
[59:59] things,
[1:00:01] certain certain the spirit of God will
[1:00:03] do that. See, you can try to impersonate
[1:00:06] by coming to church and shouting and
[1:00:08] doing this and saying or whatever,
[1:00:10] whatever, but you got to be born again
[1:00:13] because if you're not, you won't come in
[1:00:15] the resurrection.
[1:00:17] You won't you won't really be able to
[1:00:20] come subject to all of the words.
[1:00:24] Amen. Glory to God. You're not. Amen.
[1:00:27] You're not. We brother Smiley's never
[1:00:29] getting away from you must be born
[1:00:31] again.
[1:00:34] Hallelujah.
[1:00:36] Right. Be because and I got the
[1:00:39] scriptures. I'm I'm trying to take my
[1:00:41] time. Do I have time? Cuz I I you know,
[1:00:46] you know, it's it's it's on the
[1:00:48] foundation, right? Yes.
[1:00:51] when the when the when when when when uh
[1:00:54] the piece of paper was torn,
[1:00:58] right on on the Old Testament side and
[1:01:01] we going to read it. He was word upon
[1:01:03] word upon word upon word upon word upon
[1:01:06] word, right? And then on the new cuz
[1:01:09] when they connect, it's got to be word.
[1:01:13] Yes, sir. It's got to be a word bribe.
[1:01:15] If not, man, you it's no redemption
[1:01:19] claims. It's you you cuz see uh uh
[1:01:22] uh there's no claiming what's not his.
[1:01:27] True. Right. I I in studying I wrote
[1:01:30] that little statement. There's no
[1:01:32] claiming of what's not his. You got to
[1:01:35] be redeemable. Yes, sir. It and and and
[1:01:39] what makes you
[1:01:41] redeemable is the word. Right. Being
[1:01:45] able to recognize your day in his
[1:01:47] message. Glory to God. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:01:51] See, there's no claiming what's not his.
[1:01:54] A price was paid for him to make claims
[1:01:58] on the bride. Yes, sir. Glory to God.
[1:02:02] Glory to God. So, you know, we'll get
[1:02:05] into it in in a second, right? You see
[1:02:09] why it it can't be
[1:02:12] denominationalism, right? It it can't be
[1:02:14] all of that because when when the thing
[1:02:17] come
[1:02:18] together, it'll it'll show right that
[1:02:22] wasn't an original tear. That's not the
[1:02:24] original piece, right? This is this is
[1:02:27] something else. Glory to God. You know,
[1:02:30] the prophet uh he could he he was
[1:02:33] talking about in in the same quote he
[1:02:34] was just talking about, you know, people
[1:02:36] people can copy names and forge and you
[1:02:40] can do all kinds of stuff. the great age
[1:02:42] of forgery and and and just so much
[1:02:45] corruption on on so many levels. But
[1:02:48] when it comes to this, it's not so. It
[1:02:51] cannot. Right. You you can't fool the
[1:02:54] China. That's right. You can't fool the
[1:02:57] China. Right. Well, I'll take a little
[1:03:00] another piece and you know just the
[1:03:02] nature of people. They'll probably
[1:03:03] people probably tried a don't they
[1:03:06] probably you know weird language and
[1:03:09] especially back then not really speaking
[1:03:10] English probably this ain't it this
[1:03:13] ain't working this the pieces coming
[1:03:17] together they they not working right
[1:03:20] that's right I mean you might have
[1:03:21] brought something in a couple of weeks
[1:03:24] ago and lost the you know fig well I'll
[1:03:28] just take this that that's two weeks ago
[1:03:31] Right. Watch it. I'm run now.
[1:03:36] You You see why under Luther
[1:03:40] and Wesley,
[1:03:42] right? And Pentecost, it won't work
[1:03:46] because of where we are,
[1:03:49] right? It it it worked in that day for
[1:03:53] the believers in that that day in that
[1:03:56] part of the building of the bride body.
[1:03:59] It won't work now. You can't you because
[1:04:02] we we got we got more.
[1:04:05] Right. We we got all of what was in the
[1:04:07] mind of God. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:04:10] Luther didn't have all. He just had the
[1:04:12] just shall live by faith. Yes, sir.
[1:04:15] Right. Amen. And and Wesley and Wesley
[1:04:17] had a sanctification message and the
[1:04:20] Pentecostal had, you know, signs,
[1:04:22] wonders, miracles, and speaking in
[1:04:24] tongues and all that, but then they had
[1:04:26] women preachers. They had all sorts of
[1:04:28] things that were scripturally contrary
[1:04:32] to the Bible,
[1:04:35] right? So, so it won't work. Amen. God
[1:04:38] God is is is is looking for uh an
[1:04:42] original
[1:04:44] peace.
[1:04:47] Amen. Back to the Bible. That's right.
[1:04:49] Back to Pentecost. This what I tell you
[1:04:52] what the more the more I look at this
[1:04:54] the more and more I say Lord where can I
[1:04:56] go
[1:04:58] where am I going where can I go because
[1:05:02] this is so solid it makes so much sense
[1:05:06] Amen when when we look at it right glory
[1:05:09] to God so he says um you can make copies
[1:05:13] of letters but you can't impersonate
[1:05:16] that tail
[1:05:18] right it's got to fit exactly with the
[1:05:22] other piece. Therefore, your dirty
[1:05:25] clothes that you brought in, you could
[1:05:28] redeem them. That's it. See, God is not
[1:05:32] redeeming what's not his.
[1:05:36] By this ticket, because it matched the
[1:05:39] ticket that was turned in. All right,
[1:05:42] that's it. That it it's it's got to
[1:05:45] match.
[1:05:47] Watch. Now let's follow the prophet's
[1:05:50] thoughts, right? Still masterpiece.
[1:05:52] Verse 85, he says, "When God by the
[1:05:55] prophets and under the law condemned us
[1:05:58] to
[1:05:59] sin," right? Now, now let's keep in
[1:06:02] mind, right? We we've been on this uh
[1:06:05] journey for a year plus on redemption.
[1:06:08] All right. Right. Just trying to show us
[1:06:11] how how uh powerful the message actually
[1:06:15] is. how how scriptural my God uh the the
[1:06:20] message is. See, you you can't leave the
[1:06:24] scripture. All right. I don't care
[1:06:26] feelings and all of this. I feel I don't
[1:06:29] want that. No, sir. Not at all. Right. I
[1:06:32] feel I thought don't want that. Why? It
[1:06:36] won't fit.
[1:06:38] It won't fit. Denominational. I don't
[1:06:41] want that. It won't fit. Amen. You You
[1:06:45] won't come in the resurrection. Right,
[1:06:47] brother? Right, y'all guys are We are
[1:06:50] not demeaning. Right. We're not puffed
[1:06:53] up. That's right. Right. We just
[1:06:55] preaching the uncarchable riches of
[1:06:57] Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. That's it.
[1:06:59] Right. Amen. What what was locked up and
[1:07:02] sealed on the backside of the Bible has
[1:07:04] been unlocked. Hallelujah. And revealed
[1:07:08] so that we could be the matching piece.
[1:07:11] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Glory to God. I
[1:07:14] don't know about you, but I want to go
[1:07:15] in the rapture way.
[1:07:18] Amen. Amen. Well, you ain't going with
[1:07:22] just He not taking a part ticket
[1:07:25] himself. The other the other part got to
[1:07:28] be him.
[1:07:32] All right. She is him.
[1:07:35] Right.
[1:07:37] Hallelujah. You know, in the world
[1:07:38] today, they say, "I'm him." I don't know
[1:07:40] what that mean.
[1:07:43] We may not want to be that. All right.
[1:07:45] But I'm him.
[1:07:48] Right. I understand that.
[1:07:52] Right. I'm him. May not may not get me
[1:07:55] in a rapture. Yes, sir. Cuz folk got so
[1:07:57] many spirits. Yes, sir. Is that right?
[1:08:00] Yes, sir. So, when you look at them say,
[1:08:02] "I'm him." I don't know about that.
[1:08:05] That's we call that in question. What
[1:08:08] does that mean? What What are you
[1:08:10] saying? Spell it out for us. Break it
[1:08:12] down for us. Y'all don't talk to me now.
[1:08:16] Break it down to for me. Yes, sir. See,
[1:08:18] when when I talk about being him, I can
[1:08:21] break it down. Right. Amen. What that
[1:08:25] means, me being Christ, being in me, me
[1:08:28] being in Christ. Amen. The life that I
[1:08:31] live. Amen. Right. And we going
[1:08:34] somewhere still. Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] See, it got to make sense, church, cuz
[1:08:41] it it's it's so much it's so much that's
[1:08:44] out here, right? And I and I'll say
[1:08:47] this, if you're immature, you shouldn't
[1:08:50] be on social media.
[1:08:53] I'm telling you, I'm just going to
[1:08:54] preach from a a place of maturity
[1:08:59] cuz cuz it's the believe the sign and
[1:09:02] all of this. You shouldn't be on that
[1:09:04] stuff if you're not mature enough. Who
[1:09:08] was I? I was talking to little Larry. We
[1:09:10] was riding to the restaurant and uh we
[1:09:13] was talking about um you know some of
[1:09:16] this stuff and it's like he was saying,
[1:09:18] "Man, I tried to do it." And he said,
[1:09:20] "Man, it was I said, "Bro, you ain't by
[1:09:23] yourself." I tried to, too. I started
[1:09:24] looking at that stuff and I said, "Man,
[1:09:26] let me get off of this here." That's
[1:09:27] right. Cuz see what it'll start causing
[1:09:30] you to do? It'll start causing you to
[1:09:32] reason,
[1:09:35] right? And and looking at things from a
[1:09:37] a wounded person's
[1:09:41] perspective, right? Cuz listen, Brother
[1:09:44] Jack preached this a while back. Hurt
[1:09:47] people hurt people. Well, the the
[1:09:50] foundation of believe the sign is just a
[1:09:53] bunch of hurt people,
[1:09:55] right? So if hurt people that you know
[1:09:59] get on these signs automatically man you
[1:10:02] going to be pulled
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] because because it's it's appealing to
[1:10:07] your your your your feelings and your
[1:10:10] emotion and instead of the six sense
[1:10:14] right glory I'm telling you I went on
[1:10:16] that thing man and I was like boy
[1:10:19] no let me get up off this and then then
[1:10:23] I you know years ago I had brother Fred
[1:10:26] and brother David Mars came down and I I
[1:10:29] you know I was sharing this with uh
[1:10:31] little Larry uh I said man
[1:10:34] David was only believe the sign he said
[1:10:38] all of the lights in his house went off
[1:10:41] so he called his dad the demons just
[1:10:43] jumped in his house just that quick
[1:10:47] say he was so scared said brother Fred
[1:10:50] came and told him well I told you to
[1:10:52] stay off that
[1:10:54] man and prayed lights popped back on
[1:10:59] David Morris, right? But sometimes
[1:11:02] sometimes we don't we don't we don't
[1:11:04] listen, right? Glory to God. We we got
[1:11:08] we got to realize, you know, even in the
[1:11:11] days of Jesus, they was trying to
[1:11:14] criticize and ted out his ministry.
[1:11:17] Right. Come on. You you got to follow a
[1:11:19] a word pattern. Yes. They was trying to
[1:11:22] tear down Jesus, the son of man. They
[1:11:25] saw the supernatural and everything
[1:11:27] else, but they were still trying to tear
[1:11:30] it down. Give us bar rabbles. A
[1:11:32] murderer. That's right. True. Huh? Oh
[1:11:35] my. It's it's it's just so important,
[1:11:38] church. Uh I I know everybody got access
[1:11:41] to the internet, and I ain't telling you
[1:11:43] what to do. I ain't your
[1:11:44] daddy. I'm just your brother. Y'all
[1:11:47] grown folk do whatever you want to do.
[1:11:50] Right. But but when you get your life
[1:11:53] all screwed up,
[1:11:55] just remember I tried to tell you.
[1:11:59] Amen. That's right. Right. Amen.
[1:12:03] Sometimes sometimes some stuff ain't
[1:12:06] good. Even sometimes in listening to
[1:12:08] some of these guys preaching.
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:14] That's true. I I admit but I'm a whole
[1:12:17] lot more mature. But even me sometime I
[1:12:21] be like
[1:12:22] man no
[1:12:25] you got to have listen you got to be
[1:12:26] sound in the word you got to have good
[1:12:28] discernment because because if you don't
[1:12:32] down right you'll gravitate towards that
[1:12:35] stuff and it's like man it's a it's a
[1:12:38] it's a spirit behind it's a spirit
[1:12:41] behind everything
[1:12:45] and see I don't want anything pulling me
[1:12:48] away from this. Hallelujah. Because I
[1:12:51] what I what I realize is that this has
[1:12:54] been the thing that has kept me since
[1:12:56] 1988.
[1:12:58] And and and and I ain't got confidence
[1:13:00] in none of that other stuff keeping me
[1:13:03] sir. Cuz I I fought some real serious
[1:13:06] demons and I still fight some serious
[1:13:09] demons. Yes, sir.
[1:13:12] This morning just like y'all.
[1:13:16] Come on. Yes, sir. And I'm going tell
[1:13:19] you, those things do not have enough
[1:13:22] strength and power to keep you.
[1:13:26] [Applause]
[1:13:27] You know, I was I was thinking about and
[1:13:29] boy, I I enjoy hearing her sing. Uh what
[1:13:33] her name is, Leandrea Johnson.
[1:13:37] I enjoy, boy, she gifted. She'll knock
[1:13:40] Oh, man. Test something up. But she
[1:13:43] can't stop
[1:13:44] drinking. Amen. She can't stop drinking.
[1:13:48] She can't no matter how much and and and
[1:13:52] every time she go out, her situation
[1:13:54] gets worse. She take on more demons,
[1:13:58] right? And it's not enough strength.
[1:14:00] It's not enough overcoming power. She
[1:14:03] needs something with some teeth. Yes,
[1:14:05] sir.
[1:14:08] Glory to God. Hallelujah. She need the
[1:14:11] the lion. She need a eagle,
[1:14:16] right? Cuz she come in and I shouldn't
[1:14:19] have probably called her name. I don't
[1:14:20] know where this tape go, but I I was
[1:14:23] just a few weeks ago, she getting
[1:14:24] arrested and this and that. And and and
[1:14:27] you know, I got compassion as a human
[1:14:29] being. But in all uh reality, I
[1:14:32] realized, bro, she ain't she's not
[1:14:35] getting what she needs to keep her.
[1:14:39] That's it. That's it. Alcohol been
[1:14:40] taking people out way before these
[1:14:42] modern day drugs. That's right. Is that
[1:14:45] right? Glory to God. Yes, sir. That's
[1:14:48] And that's that's in a quote. You ain't
[1:14:49] got to try to look it up, but if you
[1:14:51] need it, I'll find it for you. All
[1:14:53] right.
[1:14:55] Alcohol been tearing up families way
[1:14:57] before cocaine and heron. Glory to God.
[1:15:03] Amen. Oh my. So, let let's kind of maybe
[1:15:07] get back on track a little bit. Remember
[1:15:09] what we talking about the ma the
[1:15:11] matching piece and redemption claims and
[1:15:14] and keep in mind it's not like people uh
[1:15:19] uh want us to think that that you know
[1:15:22] God is this
[1:15:24] this God and we try to throw grace in
[1:15:27] there and God is a good God. I don't
[1:15:30] doubt that.
[1:15:32] Right. God so loved the world that he
[1:15:35] gave his only begotten son that
[1:15:37] whosoever believe on him shall be saved
[1:15:40] and not perish. Is that right? And and
[1:15:45] listen, we hold on to that scripture,
[1:15:47] but we have to put something more on top
[1:15:50] of that.
[1:15:52] Right? Cuz it it's it's it's got to be a
[1:15:57] word birth, right?
[1:16:00] and not a cuz every denomination try to
[1:16:02] use that scripture,
[1:16:05] right? And I believe God got God did did
[1:16:08] s but God also knew who would and who
[1:16:12] would not.
[1:16:14] Right? Glory to God. He he God knew God
[1:16:18] God knew who would believe the word in
[1:16:20] its season and who would not believe the
[1:16:22] word in it season.
[1:16:24] Right. Amen.
[1:16:26] So, it's it's it's more to it than just
[1:16:30] uh what they want to make us uh uh think
[1:16:34] and feel cuz they all trying to they all
[1:16:37] trying and we not taking that out of the
[1:16:39] Bible but but when when it comes down to
[1:16:44] uh the promise,
[1:16:47] right? and and our part of the
[1:16:52] ticket. It's got to be entire word. All
[1:16:56] right. Right. Amen. To make up our part.
[1:16:59] But but watch uh in the masterpiece, he
[1:17:03] says, "And when God by the prophets
[1:17:04] under the law condemned us to sin, the
[1:17:07] law has no no
[1:17:09] grace. It only tells you you were a
[1:17:12] sinner."
[1:17:14] But when Jesus came on the scene, now
[1:17:17] watch this. this statement. He was the
[1:17:21] fulfillment.
[1:17:23] He was the
[1:17:25] fulfillment of everything that God had
[1:17:28] promised. Yeah. Yes. That's this part of
[1:17:31] the ticket. Yes. Right. He see entire
[1:17:37] word and here I I I want to say
[1:17:39] something because it's a strong
[1:17:41] influence uh amongst uh American blacks.
[1:17:45] They they got this what they call that
[1:17:48] group? Some kind of Israelites.
[1:17:51] Hebrew Israelites. I seen them. I seen
[1:17:53] them yesterday. And I was like, I'm just
[1:17:56] too tired to
[1:17:59] metal. I looked at them and say, "Man,
[1:18:02] they they'll drain everything out of me
[1:18:04] trying." But you know, here's the here's
[1:18:07] the thing, though. No man can come to
[1:18:09] the father unless he draw. Right. Yes,
[1:18:13] sir. you you you unless you're born
[1:18:16] again, you'll never be able to
[1:18:18] understand,
[1:18:20] right? You won't. And and unless they
[1:18:22] they get a birth, they'll never really
[1:18:25] be able to understand what they're
[1:18:28] trying to present to people. Right.
[1:18:30] That's right. See? Amen. They trying to
[1:18:33] they trying to teach a law, not
[1:18:36] realizing the law was fulfilled in
[1:18:39] Christ. It was shadows and types. All
[1:18:42] right. See, glor Thank God. Yes, sir.
[1:18:45] Thank God. It's things cuz it's things
[1:18:47] that we do and we eat, right, that under
[1:18:50] the law you could do. You couldn't do
[1:18:54] cuz I know all some of not all of us,
[1:18:56] but a lot of us like them ribs.
[1:18:58] Y'all already talked to me. Y'all
[1:19:01] couldn't be no Hebrew Israelite eating
[1:19:03] them ribs.
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:07] Oh, Jesus.
[1:19:10] And I and I can't hardly I can't hardly
[1:19:13] do pork like I used to cuz it shoot the
[1:19:15] blood pressure up. Every now and then I
[1:19:17] take a chance on that pressure. I'm
[1:19:19] going to get me a good looking rib. Give
[1:19:22] it that one right there. I choose the I
[1:19:24] choose the one that's going to make me
[1:19:26] sick. Give me that one. I go in the
[1:19:29] store and little Spanish girl be looking
[1:19:31] at they know me by now. I'mma choose.
[1:19:33] Don't just give me Don't give me
[1:19:35] anything. Give me the one that look like
[1:19:37] it's edible and I want to eat. If I'm if
[1:19:41] I'mma suffer the next day with him, you
[1:19:43] know, at least got to be sitting. I say,
[1:19:45] boy, it's a good, you know, sometime I
[1:19:47] be sitting in my car. Boy, it's a good
[1:19:49] one right here,
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:51] boy. Woo. And the next day I be at work
[1:19:54] moving slow, it be like, and then
[1:19:58] something hit me.
[1:20:00] See, you know, if you going to eat a
[1:20:02] rib, you at least need to eat it on a
[1:20:04] Friday
[1:20:06] where you ain't got to get up and do no
[1:20:08] work. You just wander on Saturday, man.
[1:20:13] Boy, some days I go in that store, boy.
[1:20:15] I thought you looking good.
[1:20:20] But hey, shrimp,
[1:20:23] crab,
[1:20:25] lobsters, but y'all couldn't ate that
[1:20:27] back then. It wasn't You was It's See,
[1:20:31] and that's what they don't even
[1:20:33] understand. It's it's things that
[1:20:35] they're looking at and it was good for
[1:20:39] them for that day. But but it was
[1:20:43] speaking of something that was far
[1:20:45] greater that was coming.
[1:20:48] Is that right? Far far greater. That was
[1:20:52] shadows and types with the turtle doves
[1:20:54] and the this kill one and do this and
[1:20:57] all of that kind of stuff. All of those
[1:20:59] different things was met,
[1:21:02] right? Yes. Hallelujah. In the life of
[1:21:04] Jesus Christ, they was just des a
[1:21:08] description of what his actions on the
[1:21:11] earth would be. Brother Brandham said he
[1:21:15] the in Christ the mystery. He would the
[1:21:17] principal theme. Amen. Everything was
[1:21:20] tied up in right. Amen. That those was
[1:21:23] just foreshadows.
[1:21:26] See, he was the fulfillment.
[1:21:29] see the fulfillment of everything that
[1:21:32] God had promised. Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:21:37] See, uh, you know, I I remember my early
[1:21:40] days of Christianity. Boy, I just didn't
[1:21:42] understand that that statement. People
[1:21:45] be talking about the promises. I didn't
[1:21:47] understand it. But I'm glad I understand
[1:21:48] it now
[1:21:50] cuz I'm I'm I'm tired to all of the New
[1:21:54] Testament promises. And I I'mma read it.
[1:21:58] Right. Just like Jesus was was
[1:22:02] connected, tied to, right? Identified.
[1:22:05] Jesus didn't do anything outside of of
[1:22:08] what was was prophesied. Everything he
[1:22:11] did, it was promised and prophesied he
[1:22:14] would do and fulfill. Amen. Right.
[1:22:18] Glory. They scrutinized it, but
[1:22:22] hey, he was the fulfillment. Yes, sir.
[1:22:25] See, he was the perfect identical image
[1:22:29] of the
[1:22:30] promise. Therefore, all the promises of
[1:22:33] the Old Testament was met in Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ. How many can say amen to that?
[1:22:38] It couldn't be met in Moses. Moses had
[1:22:42] his part, but not all of it. It couldn't
[1:22:45] be met in any of the prophets, but it
[1:22:49] was met in the masterpiece.
[1:22:52] We needed a masterpiece. We needed that
[1:22:56] perfection.
[1:22:58] Amen. Amen. See, when those two pe
[1:23:02] pieces come together, it's got to be
[1:23:04] perfection. It speaks of perfection.
[1:23:07] That's why it can't be impersonation. It
[1:23:10] can't be all of this. It can't be that.
[1:23:12] It can't be nomination cuz that won't
[1:23:15] produce perfection.
[1:23:18] That's right. That that's even why
[1:23:19] around the revealed word, we got to be
[1:23:21] careful that that we don't make this
[1:23:23] some sort of denomination now, right? We
[1:23:27] got little camps over here. Let's let's
[1:23:29] keep it the word, right? Let's just
[1:23:33] let's just keep it the word upon word,
[1:23:36] line upon line, precept upon precept. Is
[1:23:38] that right? Now, where I because I'm
[1:23:41] telling you church, we was a part of
[1:23:43] stuff like that,
[1:23:45] right? Glory to God. where it was a
[1:23:48] certain amount of statements and quotes
[1:23:51] and you know you you had to believe that
[1:23:54] and play certain tapes and play this in
[1:23:57] your church and that's I'm glad we
[1:24:00] outgrew that stuff. I was troubled with
[1:24:02] that stuff when I was a young convert
[1:24:04] with no understanding. It's like just
[1:24:06] something about this bothers me. Amen.
[1:24:09] Right. Glory to God. See, because that
[1:24:13] that that won't be the match the
[1:24:16] matching piece if we if we with all of
[1:24:19] that. You start breaking the word eighth
[1:24:22] angels and all of this kind the the
[1:24:25] foolishness that you hear, you're
[1:24:27] breaking the word, those pieces can't
[1:24:30] come together properly. They're going to
[1:24:32] kind of be like this
[1:24:34] to put a eighth angel in
[1:24:37] there. Yes. When the Bible speaks of
[1:24:40] seven seven angels,
[1:24:43] when he begin to sound, right?
[1:24:46] Mysteries. Amen. See, once he
[1:24:49] sounded and the mysteries was revealed,
[1:24:53] it was just like it was in the
[1:24:55] wilderness with Jesus and the disciples.
[1:24:58] It was
[1:24:59] broken and given to them like right.
[1:25:04] That's all it was. God come down, give
[1:25:06] it to a prophet, right? Then the
[1:25:09] five-fold ministry get it and we give it
[1:25:12] to the people. You don't get it. I mean,
[1:25:14] you'll get certain amount of things by
[1:25:16] listening and studying. You ain't
[1:25:18] getting it without the five-fold
[1:25:19] ministry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, we
[1:25:22] we just push play. You push play all you
[1:25:25] want to. That's fine. In your house,
[1:25:27] even in the church, if you want to put
[1:25:29] it, you know, tape on from time to time,
[1:25:31] that's up to you. But but on a regular
[1:25:34] basis now you need I'm telling you you
[1:25:37] need a five-fold ministry.
[1:25:40] You need a five-fold min to break these
[1:25:43] things down to us. That's right. To make
[1:25:46] where would we be if we didn't have a
[1:25:48] five-fold ministry, right? Glory to God.
[1:25:51] You got to appreciate, you got to
[1:25:52] appreciate, you know, when brother Jack
[1:25:55] gets up and he he breaks these things
[1:25:58] down and teaches and these the brethren
[1:26:00] here, you got to appreciate that. You
[1:26:03] can't see to get away from it. You're
[1:26:07] going to mess up the piece.
[1:26:10] You going to mess up the You're going to
[1:26:11] mess up your piece of the ticket.
[1:26:15] Push play all you want to try to take
[1:26:17] the five month. I'm not going to do it
[1:26:20] cuz I don't want my piece when they come
[1:26:22] together to connect. I want my piece to
[1:26:24] fit. Now, I don't know about what y'all
[1:26:27] want y'all little piece to be.
[1:26:28] Hallelujah. I just want mine to fit.
[1:26:33] And right. Glory to God. Let me let me
[1:26:38] move to this. How much time? Okay, I do
[1:26:40] have a little time. Glory to God. Okay.
[1:26:43] So he says in Moses, he said it couldn't
[1:26:46] be met in in any of the prophets. It met
[1:26:50] in the masterpiece. It matched all that
[1:26:53] it said it was going to be. So will the
[1:26:58] church have to
[1:27:00] be a match to everything that God has
[1:27:06] promised. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You got to
[1:27:10] be right. Right. It must be a piece
[1:27:13] that's smitten off of it. So if the
[1:27:16] original is the word,

[1:27:48] See this this is why we we read the
[1:27:50] scripture uh in the book of Mark to
[1:27:54] start out with, right? Yes, sir. Because
[1:27:56] because it's it's got it's got to be
[1:27:59] it's got to be scripture, right? Yes,
[1:28:03] sir.
[1:28:04] He said unto them, Mark
[1:28:07] 16:15, "Go ye into all the world." See,
[1:28:11] they're connected to some promises. And
[1:28:14] see, their their teaching and their
[1:28:17] preachings has got to be scriptural.
[1:28:19] Yes, sir. Right. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:28:24] Preach to every
[1:28:26] uh preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:28:28] Right. He that believeth. Now, this is
[1:28:31] where it kind of get a little tricky,
[1:28:34] too. We c we can't just make it the
[1:28:36] shores of Galilee
[1:28:38] because we've gone further. Yes, sir.
[1:28:42] And this is hard for people to swallow.
[1:28:47] What are we believing? All right. Come
[1:28:50] on. What are we believing? All right.
[1:28:52] Right. We could look back to that, but
[1:28:55] we got to look further. Yes, sir. We got
[1:28:58] to go deeper. Amen. That's it. Glory to
[1:29:01] God. He that believeth, what do you
[1:29:03] believe? See, somewhere we got to be
[1:29:07] settled if you're not on what you
[1:29:09] actually believe. Amen. Amen. You got to
[1:29:13] be it's got to be settled in your
[1:29:15] spirit. The the the revealed word has
[1:29:18] got to be settled in your spirit.
[1:29:23] If not, you'll be wishywashy.
[1:29:26] Glory to God. And
[1:29:28] unfortunately, it's it's hard for me to
[1:29:31] see you making a rapture apart from it.
[1:29:35] I ain't even saying you may not get
[1:29:36] eternal life. Yeah. But we we preaching
[1:29:40] a rapture message. This what people
[1:29:42] can't comprehend. True. This is not a
[1:29:45] denominational message. This is this is
[1:29:48] about uh connecting your part,
[1:29:52] connecting entire world. Yes sir.
[1:29:55] because that that the thing that was
[1:29:59] promised for this day. Yeah, I just read
[1:30:02] it. But let let's really clarify.
[1:30:05] Malachi 4's coming was connected to the
[1:30:10] promise of the believer for this day,
[1:30:14] not days gone by. Right. Right. See, in
[1:30:19] them applying the scripture, they had to
[1:30:22] see what was unveiled to them for their
[1:30:24] day. Come on. All right, y'all. Real
[1:30:28] quiet this morning. Come on. Right.
[1:30:30] Amen. But I mean, in in in in all
[1:30:34] reality, right, when when we think about
[1:30:36] what we
[1:30:38] believe, I can't it's hard for me to
[1:30:40] just have an a
[1:30:42] denominational thought on this
[1:30:44] scripture.
[1:30:46] All right. Because I realize, you know,
[1:30:50] when we start really thinking about the
[1:30:53] promises, it takes me a little bit
[1:30:55] further.
[1:30:57] Right. Yes. Yes. I got to believe on
[1:31:00] Christ died for me. Right. Yeah.
[1:31:03] Right. That's right. Old Testament, but
[1:31:06] then look look what Christ did. Amen.
[1:31:10] Under the seventh seal. Yes, sir.
[1:31:14] Right. Look, look, look what happened,
[1:31:18] right? We go back to the rising of the
[1:31:21] sun
[1:31:22] and all of those different messages. He
[1:31:24] shows
[1:31:25] us what what the ministry of Malachi 4
[1:31:28] was to do.
[1:31:31] Right. Oh yes. Amen. It was to pull us
[1:31:34] out of
[1:31:35] denominationalisms and all of these
[1:31:38] different things. Right. Come on.
[1:31:41] It was truly a rising out of sight.
[1:31:43] Amen.
[1:31:45] Christ Christ amongst us cuz he was dead
[1:31:49] through
[1:31:50] denominationalisms and all of that. Is
[1:31:52] that right? Come on. Go back and and
[1:31:54] listen to the tape. Now I'm just kind of
[1:31:56] bringing it. It wasn't in my notes off
[1:31:58] the top of my head. That's why I'm
[1:32:00] paraphrasing. Right. But truly, it was a
[1:32:04] rising. Amen. Right. And you got to be a
[1:32:07] part of that rising.
[1:32:09] See? Amen. Glory to God. You know,
[1:32:13] because we we're not this not
[1:32:14] denominationalism.
[1:32:17] We've come up hither.
[1:32:21] Glory to God. We've come up hither.
[1:32:23] Amen. See, and that's that's after
[1:32:26] church age and denominational ages is
[1:32:28] done with.
[1:32:30] Right. We have been called up a little
[1:32:33] higher. Right. If not, then we ain't in
[1:32:38] the rapture cycle. My Lord, come on.
[1:32:41] Preach with me, somebody.
[1:32:43] Amen. We're not in the rapture cycle,
[1:32:46] right? Either we in the rapture cycle or
[1:32:49] we not.
[1:32:51] Cuz the shout is the message. It is.
[1:32:54] Amen. Right. Amen. Glory. Amen. But he
[1:32:58] said, "He that believeth and is baptized
[1:33:01] shall be saved." Then then here again,
[1:33:05] now I know this was written before the
[1:33:08] book of Acts, right? But I'm about to
[1:33:11] Well, people say, "Well, you know what?
[1:33:13] It it don't matter." It does matter.
[1:33:16] Yes, sir. Because if if if it don't
[1:33:20] matter what we got our ticket looking
[1:33:22] like I have the promises, right? Glory
[1:33:27] to God. Everything's got to be cuz we
[1:33:30] can't preach
[1:33:33] imperfection.
[1:33:36] The word is perfect. Amen. Right? Be
[1:33:40] therefore perfect. Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:33:44] Then how how could we consider ourselves
[1:33:47] perfect with an imperfect word with with
[1:33:50] with imperfect teaching?
[1:33:53] Right? Cuz then what what what did we
[1:33:57] have? What do we have brother Bradom
[1:33:59] bringing us? Right.
[1:34:01] If it wasn't perfect teaching line upon
[1:34:04] line, you see what he was fighting for?
[1:34:07] Yes, sir. He was fighting for you and
[1:34:09] me. Amen. Amen. To bring a perfect
[1:34:13] world. Right. To bring Amen. a perfect
[1:34:17] master priest bride. Yes, sir. Thank
[1:34:21] you. Amen. Right. Amen. To connect us
[1:34:27] with what God had promised for this day.
[1:34:31] Right. They ain't doing that. I'm
[1:34:32] telling you, they not doing that. Right.
[1:34:36] They don't they don't understand the
[1:34:38] principles of of what was given to us.
[1:34:43] Right. They don't. That's right. Oh, I
[1:34:45] was going to read some scriptures. But
[1:34:48] boy, I get caught up because
[1:34:51] I was thinking, Brother Jack, boy, I
[1:34:53] don't even know. But I like, well, I'm
[1:34:56] going to just rest in him because once I
[1:34:58] get started, then he the mind of Christ
[1:35:00] comes in and he understands the message
[1:35:04] better than I do. Right. See, the gift
[1:35:07] is you get out the way. Get out the way
[1:35:10] and then I'll preach the thought that I
[1:35:12] gave you for you. Hallelujah. So he
[1:35:14] preaching the thought for me. Amen.
[1:35:17] Right. Glory to God. But he says, uh, he
[1:35:20] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:35:22] saved. That's just delivered, right? But
[1:35:26] he that believeth not shall be damned.
[1:35:29] That's a powerful statement. See, that's
[1:35:31] a real powerful statement. That's not
[1:35:33] throwing off because you don't want you
[1:35:35] know you
[1:35:38] God is a a a a loving God. He is I mean
[1:35:44] uh it's a scripture I'm trying to quote
[1:35:45] but it ain't coming coming to my head
[1:35:48] fully. Uh but God knows, right? God God
[1:35:52] knows. Amen. He said now now watch this
[1:35:56] now with with the word right with with
[1:36:00] the revealed word. He says, "And these
[1:36:04] signs shall follow them that believe."
[1:36:08] Right? See th this is your part
[1:36:13] of the ticket.
[1:36:15] So so that you'll know what your part of
[1:36:17] the ticket looks like. All right. Right.
[1:36:21] When when it's connected, you can have
[1:36:24] an assurance like I'm all right. I'm
[1:36:27] good. See, I know I know that I'll be
[1:36:29] claimed in redemption. Amen. Right?
[1:36:33] Because I'm the matching piece. If he
[1:36:36] was if he was this piece and fulfilled
[1:36:40] all of the promises of the Old
[1:36:41] Testament, then him and us fulfilling
[1:36:45] all the promises of the New Testament by
[1:36:48] the word.
[1:36:51] Right.
[1:36:53] See, so you know, it helps us to see
[1:36:56] where Brother Brandham wasn't some crazy
[1:36:58] crank and they be trying to tell us all
[1:37:00] this. I'll be like, I just don't know
[1:37:02] where y'all be getting that stuff from
[1:37:05] cuz this just make too much sense for
[1:37:07] me. I just don't see where it don't make
[1:37:09] sense to y'all.
[1:37:12] That's right. It just it just you know,
[1:37:14] I be trying to find a fault. Somebody
[1:37:17] came to me years ago and you know,
[1:37:19] brother, I won't go on his name and you
[1:37:22] see no you don't see no fault with the
[1:37:25] message. First of all, I ain't looking.
[1:37:27] It's taking everything that I got trying
[1:37:30] to understand
[1:37:32] the message and all that was laid out.
[1:37:35] So if it's taking me and I'm your
[1:37:38] head, then how you feel you above me and
[1:37:42] that he's bypassing me and you getting
[1:37:45] all of this great revelation and all of
[1:37:48] this and that and no see you breaking
[1:37:52] protocol anyway.
[1:37:55] See, I could tell it's the devil, right?
[1:37:57] Because your actions ain't even lining
[1:38:00] up with scripture. You you you bypassing
[1:38:03] order,
[1:38:05] right? That's right. If if how God going
[1:38:08] to bypass Brother Jack, right, and go to
[1:38:13] Now, I used to be a pastor, but I'm not
[1:38:15] now.
[1:38:17] This brother Jack is the pastor of this
[1:38:19] church. God just bypassing brother Jack
[1:38:22] and giving me these great revelation
[1:38:28] that's not something that's contrary to
[1:38:30] the word now God is giving me
[1:38:33] revelations based upon the word and
[1:38:35] these brethren but when it's things
[1:38:38] outside of the word
[1:38:41] see
[1:38:46] Eve Right. Yeah. Look at look at what
[1:38:50] your revelation causes.

[1:38:59] good ride. Me, him, and uh uh God, I
[1:39:03] can't think his cousin name. M. We had a
[1:39:05] good hour ride to the restaurant. We
[1:39:07] just was just talking about the word and
[1:39:09] and just different things. And man, I'm
[1:39:12] like, you know, this this is where
[1:39:15] people get messed up. They they bypass
[1:39:20] authority. Yes, sir. And I'm just going
[1:39:22] to tell y'all, y'all ain't that
[1:39:23] spiritual like y'all think y'all are.
[1:39:25] Come on, brother.
[1:39:27] This might hurt your feelings, but I'm
[1:39:29] not really concerned about that right
[1:39:30] now.
[1:39:32] Right. Come on. You can't bypass order.
[1:39:36] And everybody that does it, look, look
[1:39:38] at where they end up. Come on, church.

[1:40:44] it didn't look like to them it needed
[1:40:46] modifying amending
[1:40:49] it didn't mean it didn't mean that but

[1:41:35] I do. I'm responsible for what I say.
[1:41:38] There's no way in the world that I could
[1:41:40] I could preach them a gospel that's not

[1:47:05] Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of
[1:47:07] the Jews. The same came to Jesus by
[1:47:11] night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
[1:47:13] that thou a teacher come from God. For
[1:47:16] no man can do these miracles that thou
[1:47:19] doest except God be with him." Jesus
[1:47:22] answered and said unto him, "Verily,
[1:47:23] verily, I say unto thee, watch this."
[1:47:26] And this is just really at the
[1:47:29] foundation,
[1:47:31] right? Because you'll never really
[1:47:33] understand the message if you don't.
[1:47:35] You'll always struggle. It'll never make
[1:47:38] sense. Jesus and said, answered and said
[1:47:41] unto him, and you can't really say Jesus
[1:47:45] the Christ apart from it. That's right.
[1:47:47] Right. You can't say that was a southern
[1:47:50] man revealing the southern man without
[1:47:52] it. Right? Glory to God. Verily, verily,
[1:47:55] I say unto thee, except a man be born
[1:47:57] again, he cannot see or understand the
[1:48:00] kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto him,
[1:48:03] "How can a man be born when he is old?"
[1:48:07] Right?
[1:48:09] Um, let me keep reading. Uh, how can a
[1:48:12] man be born when he is old? Can he enter
[1:48:16] the second time into his mother's womb
[1:48:18] and be born? And Jesus answered,
[1:48:21] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[1:48:24] the man be born of water and of the
[1:48:26] spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:48:29] of God."
[1:48:31] That which is born of the flesh is
[1:48:33] flesh. That which is born of of the
[1:48:35] spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said
[1:48:38] unto you, to thee, you must be born
[1:48:40] again. All right, I wanted to skip down.
[1:48:43] Let's get down to the 15th verse. It
[1:48:45] says um 14th. It says, "And as Moses was
[1:48:48] lifted the serpent in the wilderness,
[1:48:52] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:48:55] that whosoever watch
[1:48:57] this. Whosoever believeth in him, that's
[1:49:01] the word, right?
[1:49:04] That's the complete understanding of the
[1:49:06] word. That's not part understanding,
[1:49:11] right?" Amen. that whosoever believeth
[1:49:14] in
[1:49:15] him shall not perish but have
[1:49:19] everlasting life. For God so loved the
[1:49:22] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:49:25] that whosoever believeth
[1:49:27] in him shall not perish but have
[1:49:31] everlasting life. I I'm I'mma it's more
[1:49:35] I I got more scripture but I'mma close
[1:49:37] here. The the thing for me and what
[1:49:40] brother Brandham was just trying to
[1:49:42] bring us was true understanding. Yes,
[1:49:45] sir. Right. See, we we could try to hold
[1:49:49] on to that and then when this
[1:49:53] disundering comes, you reject that. It's
[1:49:55] a real indication that you really don't
[1:49:58] understand your Bible.
[1:50:01] Right. Glory. Because brother Brandham
[1:50:04] let the musicians make their way.
[1:50:05] Brother Brandham's scope was a whole lot
[1:50:09] deeper,
[1:50:11] right? Is that right? Glory to God. It
[1:50:14] was a whole lot deeper. And not it
[1:50:17] wasn't something outside of the
[1:50:19] word, right? But the scope of what he
[1:50:23] was bringing
[1:50:25] us was just different.
[1:50:29] It was different in that it was the
[1:50:32] original thinking, man. the things that
[1:50:34] that we look at, man, we look back in
[1:50:38] our old churches and stuff like that, we
[1:50:40] be like, man,
[1:50:42] we were lost.
[1:50:45] We were just lost with a bunch of
[1:50:47] traditions and, you know, 100 women in
[1:50:50] white and 50 men in black and little
[1:50:55] cheering in red and just all kind of,
[1:50:58] you know, all kind of uh things to raise
[1:51:02] money. Brother Jack know what I'm
[1:51:04] talking about. Doc, we need to be We
[1:51:05] just need you over here. You just need
[1:51:07] me to raise you some money to pay your
[1:51:11] bills. That's all that is. It ain't even
[1:51:14] about what I'm preaching. It's about
[1:51:16] getting more people in here. More
[1:51:18] people, more money. That's right. That's
[1:51:20] it. I need my rent paid today. Come on
[1:51:24] over. Brother D be like that. I preach
[1:51:28] and he's a friend of mine. I've known
[1:51:30] him since we were kids. eight, nine
[1:51:33] years old. Doc, I want you to come
[1:51:35] preach for I All right, you sure? I'll
[1:51:37] come now. I came, they took up a
[1:51:41] offering. They took it to the back. I
[1:51:43] get Doc, man, see if you can get out get
[1:51:46] out there and get them people get I
[1:51:48] said, "Bro, I don't do that." I just
[1:51:50] straight up told him that I I don't
[1:51:52] raise money. I am not good at that. I
[1:51:54] never raise the money because the
[1:51:56] prophet said he didn't raise money. I
[1:51:58] don't raise the money. I if if we do it
[1:52:02] the way the Bible says do it, we'll be
[1:52:05] all right.
[1:52:07] You got, you know, and if you'll look at
[1:52:10] things right, cuz it can't be off of the
[1:52:12] word. Building funds and all that,
[1:52:14] that's scriptural.
[1:52:16] Those things are scriptural. It's not
[1:52:18] something off of the word,
[1:52:21] right? And if you do it like that, God
[1:52:24] God will bless it.
[1:52:27] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:52:29] of praise.
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:34] Thank
[1:52:36] you

[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:23] Oh, hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a
[1:54:26] hand of
[1:54:30] praise. Amen. Brother Jerry, don't worry
[1:54:33] about that. I'll got another plan. I
[1:54:36] appreciate um Brother
[1:54:38] Smiley uh on today. the matching
[1:54:43] piece. Um, and you know, he was there's
[1:54:48] there's a lot, you know, that was just
[1:54:50] being um uh spoken there. And I I know
[1:54:55] that um um um often times people just
[1:54:59] misunderstand us when we when we kind of
[1:55:02] share some of the things that we share
[1:55:03] and we've been accused of being arrogant
[1:55:06] and and all of that. But you know the
[1:55:09] scripture was very plain that he read um
[1:55:12] say he that
[1:55:14] uh the sign's going to follow them that
[1:55:17] believe but those that believe not was
[1:55:19] going to be damned. The the question
[1:55:23] was what what do you
[1:55:26] believe? What was Jesus speaking of when
[1:55:30] he said he that believeth not would be
[1:55:32] damned? Right? and and and and he was
[1:55:35] just really bringing it out so so plain.
[1:55:37] You know, if your ticket is not matching
[1:55:39] at the end, you can forget about it. I
[1:55:42] mean, I I don't care. I don't care how
[1:55:45] much you jumped and shouted and did all
[1:55:47] these. If your ticket is not a match at
[1:55:49] the end, it will not work. You ain't get
[1:55:52] no laundry. You ain't going to no
[1:55:54] rapture. Praise God. But I I just
[1:55:58] appreciate this message. I appreciate,
[1:56:00] you know, what God has given us. And you
[1:56:03] know, and I know through love, God will
[1:56:05] bring, you know, uh, different ones will
[1:56:07] be restored back to this truth. But, uh,
[1:56:10] I it's he hit it right on the head. I'
[1:56:13] I've seen it in many of situations. Uh,
[1:56:17] hurt people do hurt people. And as as he
[1:56:20] mentioned out, I was I was out in c in
[1:56:22] Canada a few years ago. the brother that
[1:56:25] put out the Believe the Sign
[1:56:28] um stuff. He was a song leader in the
[1:56:32] church and uh and they wouldn't
[1:56:35] necessarily receive some of the things
[1:56:36] that he was doing. So like one of the
[1:56:37] things that he would do is he would have
[1:56:40] rehearsals at his house with all the
[1:56:42] musicians and other song leaders and he
[1:56:45] would play um music from Elvis and he
[1:56:49] say this is what we need to be sounding
[1:56:51] like. So when people say no dang what we
[1:56:55] trying to sound
[1:56:56] like he get hurt, right? Because people
[1:56:59] ain't receiving your false revelation
[1:57:01] here, right? And now you get hurt and
[1:57:04] now you go put out something like this
[1:57:06] and next and and all you do is minister
[1:57:08] to other hurt people.
[1:57:12] And if you if you just got just a little
[1:57:14] something in you and this is how it's
[1:57:16] exposed. Now I'm being honest with you.
[1:57:18] If you just got a little bit of
[1:57:19] something in you, something that you
[1:57:20] ain't been able to forgive somebody for
[1:57:23] that little bit of something right
[1:57:24] there, the devil can take that and
[1:57:26] anoint it
[1:57:28] and you find yourself so far out here.
[1:57:31] I'm going to tell you something. You got
[1:57:32] to guard your spirit.
[1:57:35] You got to protect your spirit and you
[1:57:38] got to feed your spirit the word, right?
[1:57:41] I mean, because that's that's where
[1:57:42] people need healing at is in their
[1:57:44] spirit. It it's it's not necessarily on
[1:57:47] the flesh, but it's in the spirit and
[1:57:49] it's manifested in the flesh. But I I
[1:57:52] tell you, I if if if you don't recognize
[1:57:54] these things, you you'll just be so so
[1:57:56] swept away. And he's so right about all
[1:57:59] these new preachers, y'all, we can't
[1:58:01] listen to everybody.
[1:58:05] Everybody call theirself pastor ain't
[1:58:07] ain't really no pastor. A lot of these
[1:58:09] guys, they they they they not pastors.
[1:58:13] They they they are hirelings
[1:58:16] and uh they come just to take money that
[1:58:20] I mean they realize church is a big
[1:58:22] business and they take advantage of
[1:58:24] God's people but these people are not
[1:58:26] ministers of the gospel of Christ. I
[1:58:28] mean all kind of stuff that they coming
[1:58:30] up with so far away from the word of God
[1:58:32] and we just be sitting there listening.
[1:58:34] Soon as you see them as soon as you hear
[1:58:36] them go off one time you uhuh that's it.
[1:58:38] I'm done with that. I'm turning this off
[1:58:40] because there are spirits inside of this
[1:58:42] and all they want to do is anoint your
[1:58:44] flesh. No, we trying to go to go to go
[1:58:47] to heaven. We need the matching peace.
[1:58:52] Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Praise
[1:58:56] God. Thank God for the word today. I
[1:58:59] certainly appreciate brother Smiley.
[1:59:02] Amen. Amen. Let's um have a word of
[1:59:06] prayer and uh we'll prepare to uh
[1:59:09] dismiss on today. We'll be back on
[1:59:13] um Wednesday night. Amen. Oh, let me
[1:59:17] just mention something. Um I was
[1:59:22] um uh um being that I was away, usually
[1:59:25] I'm here to kind of do setup and things
[1:59:27] like that with the brothers, but um I
[1:59:29] was away this week and uh the brothers
[1:59:33] came in and did a wonderful job getting
[1:59:35] everything all set up. Appreciate you,
[1:59:36] brothers, so much.
[1:59:39] Um Amen.
[1:59:42] And um we um uh usually brother Maris
[1:59:46] always brings his two sons. He'll go
[1:59:48] home and and make sure he bring uh um
[1:59:52] Xavier and Xander, you know, back. Uh
[1:59:54] and uh this I guess they got to playing
[1:59:57] around on the instruments
[1:59:59] uh this week and brother brother Jerry
[2:00:01] took hold of the keyboard and and Xander
[2:00:04] took hold of the
[2:00:06] drums and I say, "Well, Lord have
[2:00:09] mercy." Uh and uh
[2:00:12] so I I I don't know what the Lord's plan
[2:00:16] is. I I'm encouraged. I tell you what, I
[2:00:18] I got very encouraged today. Uh that
[2:00:21] song, Sister Sheree song, and then even
[2:00:23] Brother Smiley. God got everything under
[2:00:25] control. Let's just let's just wait on
[2:00:26] the Lord. But I I I'm just I think we
[2:00:30] might have to somehow bring out the
[2:00:34] instruments on Wednesday nights because
[2:00:36] we got some new musicians that are
[2:00:38] coming forth and they need opportunity
[2:00:43] uh to be able to express their gifts.
[2:00:47] Now, in order for them to express their
[2:00:48] gifts means that somebody going to have
[2:00:50] to make a sacrifice and help with these
[2:00:53] instruments, putting them together and
[2:00:55] breaking them down. And we have to do
[2:00:56] that until the Lord delivers
[2:00:59] us. But uh but but but we want to just I
[2:01:02] think we're going to have to kind of
[2:01:03] shift some things to Wednesday night a
[2:01:04] little bit just so that these gifts can
[2:01:06] have room to mature and and develop and
[2:01:11] grow. You know, that's we used to have
[2:01:13] Friday night service years ago and
[2:01:15] that's was the time where everybody got
[2:01:16] their gifts uh to just to flourish a
[2:01:19] little bit. Song leaders learn how to
[2:01:21] song lead on Friday nights. The
[2:01:23] musicians learn how to play. We and and
[2:01:25] that's how God developed the next
[2:01:27] generation. So So we gonna have to
[2:01:28] figure out something. Amen. But we want
[2:01:31] these gifts just kind of go forward.
[2:01:32] I've been I've been I've been waiting to
[2:01:34] try to get um um uh brother Josiah on
[2:01:39] his bass. He be sitting here, but he got
[2:01:41] a bass guitar that Feller can play, but
[2:01:43] we got to give him space to be able to
[2:01:45] play. So So Wednesday night, bring your
[2:01:47] bass guitar. We'll put sand on the drums
[2:01:50] and and we going we going to we going to
[2:01:53] just do things a little different. All
[2:01:54] right. All right. We're going to do
[2:01:56] things a little
[2:01:57] different.
[2:01:59] Amen. So I tell you brothers, if y'all
[2:02:02] would help me. Amen. We'll we'll we'll
[2:02:04] get these gifts going forward. So thank
[2:02:06] y'all so much for what y'all did on
[2:02:07] Friday night. I I saw that and I was
[2:02:09] encouraged. I said, "Yeah, we got to we
[2:02:11] got to make things happen." So we're
[2:02:13] going to pull these instruments out on
[2:02:14] Wednesdays. Amen. We used to just keep
[2:02:16] them in, but we going to pull them out.
[2:02:18] Amen. Especially now we got our our
[2:02:20] musicians here. Amen. We can use them
[2:02:23] right here on Wednesday night. So, just
[2:02:25] need a little help, brothers. Just need
[2:02:26] a little help. Amen. Let's pray. Father,
[2:02:29] we thank you for Lord, just uh the way
[2:02:33] that you have come down to minister to
[2:02:35] us, God, through this sermon that your
[2:02:38] servant uh just brought it. It's all
[2:02:42] about that matching piece. We can't uh
[2:02:46] sugarcoat the word. We can't Lord just
[2:02:50] uh begin to amend the word. We can't do
[2:02:53] those things because that peace will not
[2:02:56] match at the end. And Father, we we
[2:02:59] realize that it has to be word upon
[2:03:01] word, line upon line, precept upon
[2:03:04] precept. Father, that's that's the way
[2:03:05] we have to believe it. And uh God, we we
[2:03:08] can't deviate because we know the
[2:03:10] scripture says that those that would add
[2:03:11] to the word uh they would have their
[2:03:13] names taken from the the Lamb's book of
[2:03:15] life, those that would also uh take away
[2:03:18] from the word that have their name taken
[2:03:20] from the Lamb's book of life. We don't
[2:03:21] want to be identified in that group. So
[2:03:23] help us to hold fast to the word of God.
[2:03:27] We ask that you continue to use your
[2:03:28] servant. Bless them, Lord. Thank you for
[2:03:31] uh all that you did with him on last
[2:03:33] weekend and this weekend. Some upcoming
[2:03:35] services that you've uh called him to go
[2:03:38] before him, Lord. Bless them, Father.
[2:03:40] Even as this sermon would go out, we ask
[2:03:42] that you would use it for the glory uh
[2:03:45] of yourself and that people would be
[2:03:47] strengthened and encouraged by the word
[2:03:48] that is given to them. Lord, we just
[2:03:51] trust that as we prepare to leave this
[2:03:53] place but not your presence, that we
[2:03:54] would leave, Lord, meditating and
[2:03:56] thinking on what we've heard here today.
[2:03:58] God, we trust, Lord, that the spirit of
[2:04:00] God would keep us and till we're able to
[2:04:03] come back together again on Wednesday
[2:04:04] night. And uh Lord, may you just
[2:04:06] continue to minister to our hearts and
[2:04:08] to our needs. We give you the glory. We
[2:04:11] give you the honor. We give you the
[2:04:12] praise for you alone are worthy. It's in
[2:04:15] Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. And
[2:04:19] amen. Praise the
[2:04:22] Lord. Amen. We'll have the brothers come
[2:04:25] at this time uh to dismiss us. Amen.
[2:04:28] We'll be back on Wednesday night 7:30.
[2:04:32] Amen. For service. God bless
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:54] you.
