[16:16] open our Bibles to Psalms
[16:19] 119 and we'll go we'll start at verse
[16:30] 57 and we'll read down to verse 64.
[16:39] Psalms
[16:40] 119:57
[16:42] reads, "Thou art my portion, O Lord. I
[16:46] have said that I would keep thy words. I
[16:49] entreated thy favor with my whole heart.
[16:52] Be merciful unto me according to thy
[16:55] word. I thought on my ways, and turned
[16:58] my feet unto thy testimonies. I made
[17:01] haste and delayed not to keep thy
[17:02] commandments. The bands of the wicked
[17:05] have robbed me, but I have not forgotten
[17:07] thy law. At midnight, I will rise to
[17:11] give thanks unto thee because of thy
[17:13] righteous judgments. I am a companion of
[17:16] all them that fear thee, and of them
[17:19] that keep thy precepts. The earth, O
[17:21] Lord, is full of thy mercy, teach me thy
[17:25] statutes. Amen. Let's bow our hearts.
[17:28] righteous.
[17:30] Father, your word, Lord God, is
[17:33] everything to us,
[17:35] Father. It's what we live for, Lord.
[17:39] Father, and we love to be obedient to
[17:41] your
[17:42] truth, Father. We have come this morning
[17:44] that we might hear your word this
[17:46] morning, Lord. And we need you to speak
[17:49] to us. Each one of us, Lord God, we have
[17:52] different tests and different trials,
[17:54] Lord God. We have different victories
[17:55] that must be won, Lord Jesus. There are
[17:58] so many things that we as overcomers
[18:01] must overcome, Lord. And we need your
[18:04] word, Father, for every situation that
[18:06] we have, Lord. It's already written.
[18:10] Father, we read the back of the book,
[18:11] Lord Jesus. We win, Lord, regardless of
[18:14] whatever comes our way. So, Father, I
[18:17] pray, Lord God, that you'll shine the
[18:20] light on your word as our pastor brings
[18:21] it this morning. Father, that a fresh
[18:24] anointing will rest upon him and upon
[18:26] this congregation, upon our brothers and
[18:29] sisters that are listening in, Father.
[18:31] Father, we want you to move, Lord. And
[18:34] Father, we don't want your presence to
[18:35] go unrecognized, Lord. We want to see
[18:38] you while you're moving even now in this
[18:39] service, Lord. Father, you know how to
[18:42] deal with each and every heart, Lord.
[18:44] So, we ask, Father God, just brood over
[18:46] us, each one, Lord. Oh father, as the
[18:49] prophet would say, make love to your
[18:51] people, Lord God, by brooding over your
[18:53] children. Transform our lives, Lord. You
[18:57] said that we are the children of God,
[18:58] and that's who we are, Lord. But you
[19:00] also said that we are an invincible
[19:02] army, Lord. Make us what you would have
[19:05] us to be, where Satan could have no
[19:07] place, no victory anywhere in our lives,
[19:09] Lord. Oh Lord, this comes by your word,
[19:12] Lord, and by the quickening power of the
[19:13] Holy Ghost. Quicken us all together in
[19:17] your divine truth. Bless our pastor,
[19:19] Lord, in a mighty way. Bless brother
[19:21] Willie in a different ministering
[19:22] brothers, Lord, as we all prepare our
[19:24] hearts to hear from heaven. It's in
[19:26] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[19:31] In my life be
[19:33] [Music]

[19:38] in

[38:23] your great grace and your mercy, Lord,
[38:25] that you have bestowed upon each of us,
[38:27] Lord. We are a blessed people, Lord.
[38:29] Lord, to have our souls sealed. We don't
[38:32] have to worry about eternity. We don't
[38:34] have to worry about our bodies being
[38:36] changed, Lord God, for we have the
[38:38] token, Lord Jesus. Our ticket is in our
[38:40] hands and we're ready to go. So, Father,
[38:42] we thank you for what you're doing in
[38:44] this service, Lord. And we pray that
[38:45] you'll continue to bless the remainder
[38:47] of the service, Father. Be with our
[38:49] brothers and sisters that cannot make it
[38:51] here for whatever reason, Lord. May your
[38:52] blessings be upon them. And father God,
[38:55] as we turn our part, our hearts to this
[38:57] portion of our worship, Lord, our
[38:59] giving, Lord, Father, you said, Lord
[39:01] God, you would open the windows of
[39:03] heaven and pour out a blessing that
[39:04] there wouldn't be room enough to receive
[39:06] it, Lord Jesus, and you would rebuke the
[39:08] devourer for our sakes. Father God, may
[39:11] we expect this to come to pass, Lord
[39:14] Jesus. May we expect the blessings in
[39:17] our spiritual life. May we expect the
[39:19] blessings in our family, Lord. May we
[39:21] expect the blessings in our bodies,
[39:23] Lord. May we expect the blessings in our
[39:25] finances, Lord. Father, bless your
[39:28] people abundantly, Lord. You've come
[39:30] that we might have life and have it more
[39:32] abundantly. Lord, both in this life and
[39:34] in the life to come. So I pray, Lord,
[39:36] your blessings upon your people. Lord,
[39:38] we return this in the name of Jesus
[39:40] Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.

[40:23] worry and don't you be
[40:29] afraid. Joy comes in the
[40:33] morning. Troubles they don't last
[40:37] always.
[40:40] For there's a friend in
[40:45] Jesus who will wipe your tears
[40:51] away. And when your heart is
[40:57] broken, just lift your hands and

[41:14] stand no matter what may come my
[41:20] way. My life is in your
[41:25] hands. With Jesus I can take
[41:31] it. With him I know I can stand.
[41:38] No matter what may come my
[41:43] way, my life is in his
[41:49] hands. So in your test and
[41:54] trials, they seem to get you down.
[42:02] All your friends and loved
[42:06] ones are nowhere to be
[42:11] found. Remember, there's a friend in
[42:17] Jesus who will wipe your tears away.
[42:24] So if your heart is
[42:29] broken, just lift your hands and
[42:33] say, "Oh, I know that I can make
[42:40] it. I know that I can
[42:45] say no matter what may come my way.
[42:52] My life is in his
[42:56] hands. Oh, with Jesus I can take
[43:03] it. With him I know I can
[43:08] change. No matter what may come my
[43:14] way. My life is in his hands.

[43:25] it. And

[43:35] come my
[43:36] way. My life is in his hands. And with
[43:44] Jesus, I can take it.

[43:53] stand no matter what may come my
[43:59] way. My life is in his hands.
[44:05] know I know that I can make
[44:09] it and I know that I can
[44:15] stay no matter what may come my
[44:21] way. My life is in your
[44:26] hands. And with Jesus
[44:30] I is with him.
[44:34] I know. I know. And that's no matter
[44:39] what. No matter what may come my
[44:43] way, my life is in your hands. And I
[44:50] know that I I can make it. And I
[44:57] know I can I can stand.
[45:02] No matter
[45:04] what. No matter
[45:07] what. No matter what may come my way.
[45:12] Oh, I'll go. I'll go through fire and
[45:16] blood. No
[45:18] matter. I'll go. I'll go where you want
[45:22] me to
[45:23] go. No matter what may come my way.

[52:43] Amen. Praise the Lord. Why don't you

[52:46] Say, "So good to see you in the house of
[52:47] the Lord
[52:48] today."
[52:51] Amen. My
[52:53] God. Blessed be the name of the
[53:01] Lord.
[53:04] Amen. Amen. Musicians, thank y'all very
[53:09] much. appreciate you all in your
[53:10] service. Amen. On today,
[53:14] uh thank God for the specials
[53:17] uh that went forth on today and the
[53:20] worship. It's everything that's been
[53:22] done in the name of
[53:24] Jesus. Uh I believe he's truly pleased.
[53:29] Amen. Saw Brother Kelly back there. Good
[53:31] to see you, my precious brother. Uh God
[53:34] bless you.
[53:36] Um I was informed them yesterday that
[53:42] um uh brother Jean Avis attends there at
[53:47] Rapture and Faith
[53:48] Tabernacle. Um you you all know brother
[53:52] Jean, but brother Jean uh suffered a
[53:55] stroke uh earlier this week and uh we
[53:59] want
[53:59] to uh take our brother to the Lord in
[54:02] prayer. Amen. and um uh pray that God
[54:07] would just uh reverse this because I
[54:11] actually heard the prophet pray a prayer
[54:13] like that for another man uh in his day
[54:16] that had a a stroke and the prophet
[54:18] prayed that God would reverse it and God
[54:21] did just that. Uh I know there's nothing
[54:23] too hard for the Lord. Amen. Uh so let's
[54:27] let's just uh carry uh Brother Jean uh
[54:30] before the Lord. Father, we come in the
[54:32] name of Jesus on behalf of um a a
[54:36] servant, a son, God, that's been so
[54:39] faithful throughout the years. He's been
[54:42] a bridge, Lord, to so many. And God, we
[54:45] see that the enemy has attacked our
[54:47] brother, Lord, with this stroke. But
[54:49] God, we're asking that you would reverse
[54:51] every uh impact or symptom that comes
[54:54] from it, Lord. That you would bring
[54:56] complete and total healing uh to his
[54:58] body. Satan, we rebuke you in the name
[55:01] of Jesus. Uh, as sons and daughters of
[55:04] God, we know that what we bind on earth
[55:06] shall be bound in heaven, and what we
[55:08] loose on earth shall be loose in heaven.
[55:09] So, we loose the the mighty hand of God
[55:12] to touch our brother, Lord,
[55:14] supernaturally, and bring healing to his
[55:16] body. Watch over his wife, his daughter,
[55:18] Lord. You know, everything that that is
[55:20] impacted by this. Meet every need that
[55:22] he would have, oh God, uh during this
[55:24] time. We just trust Lord Jesus that you
[55:27] would get the glory, the honor, and the
[55:29] praise from raising our brother up. It's
[55:31] in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. And
[55:37] amen.
[55:39] Amen. Amen. We also, Father, ask your
[55:43] blessings on your word as we read it in
[55:45] Jesus name. Amen. Let's turn in our
[55:48] Bibles uh to uh Leviticus 25.
[55:55] I am returning back to uh our thought on
[56:01] Jubilee year and um there's just a few
[56:06] things that I I desire to tie in and um
[56:12] uh there is a part of this when when
[56:15] when trying to tie it in uh there is
[56:18] some reading that I need to do and then
[56:21] there's some depending on inspiration
[56:23] that I need to do uh and we're just
[56:26] trusting God just to get the glory uh
[56:28] out of this. But but one of the most
[56:30] important things for me, amen, is to
[56:34] bring the church to a place where
[56:35] they're settled
[56:37] uh when it comes to the word of the
[56:40] Lord. And uh and it's it's important to
[56:43] be settled because you will hear a lot
[56:45] of people saying a lot of things. And
[56:48] remember, you know, the prophet said
[56:50] there are so many voices in the land. So
[56:53] many voices and you got to watch these
[56:56] voices. And I'll be honest with you,
[56:58] some voices actually feel like they
[57:00] greater than the prophet.
[57:03] [Music]
[57:05] Yeah. Yeah. We got to be careful. Uh if
[57:08] a prophet said it, you don't understand
[57:10] it. You just wait until understanding
[57:13] come to you. But you don't try to go
[57:15] above the prophet. It it could because
[57:17] the prophet had a very specific ministry
[57:19] and his ministry was to reveal
[57:22] the mysteries of God to us. Amen. Amen.
[57:27] So, uh you got to watch all the voices,
[57:29] but my job is to try to make sure the
[57:30] church is settled. Amen. And um uh so
[57:33] let's read. Amen. Here, Leviticus 25
[57:37] verse one says, "And the Lord spake unto
[57:39] Moses and Mount Si, saying, Speak unto
[57:42] the children of Israel, saying to them,
[57:44] when ye come into the land which I give
[57:46] you, then shall uh the land keep a
[57:49] Sabbath unto the Lord. Six years thou
[57:52] shalt sew thy field, and six years thou
[57:55] shalt uh prune thy vineyard, and gather
[57:58] in the fruit thereof. But in the seventh
[58:01] year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the
[58:04] land, a Sabbath uh for the Lord. Thou
[58:07] shalt neither sew thy field nor prune
[58:10] thy
[58:11] vineyard. That which groweth of its own
[58:14] accord of thy harvest thou shalt not
[58:17] reap, neither shall neither gather the
[58:19] grapes of the vine undress. For it is a
[58:22] year of rest unto the land. And the
[58:24] Sabbath of the land shall be meat for
[58:26] you uh for thee, and for thy servant,
[58:29] and for thy maid, and for thy hired
[58:31] servant, and for thy stranger that
[58:33] sojourneth with thee, and for thy
[58:36] cattle, and for the beasts that are in
[58:38] thy land shall all the increase thereof
[58:41] uh be meat. Verse 8 says, and thou shalt
[58:44] number seven Sabbaths of years unto
[58:47] thee, seven times, seven years. in the
[58:50] space of the seven Sabbaths of years
[58:52] shall be unto thee 40 and nine years.
[58:55] Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[58:59] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[59:03] seventh month and the day of atonement.
[59:07] Shall you make the trumpet sound
[59:09] throughout all your land? Now there's
[59:10] there's significant things that are
[59:12] happening here. This is a a Jubilee
[59:15] trumpet uh that sounds uh and then it
[59:19] says in the day of atonement. Okay, in
[59:22] the day of atonement. And um and some of
[59:24] the information I'd like to bring to you
[59:26] today is uh the Jews are actually called
[59:29] back to a day of atonement after the
[59:33] Gentiles have uh finished their pestal
[59:36] feast. I think um okay um the uh so so
[59:42] we want to just kind of look at that um
[59:45] them Jews being called back to their uh
[59:48] day of atonement after that Pentecostal
[59:50] feast and we are currently in the pen
[59:53] brother Brandham called it a Pentecostal
[59:55] Jubilee. Uh that's where we find
[59:58] ourselves right now. Amen. Praise the
[1:00:01] Lord. Amen. And and so there's a time uh
[1:00:04] that the the Jews will be called back.
[1:00:06] So, uh, and the preparation has already
[1:00:09] begun for them to be in the land. Amen.
[1:00:13] To receive their two prophets. Praise
[1:00:15] the Lord. I'm going to say that again.
[1:00:17] Preparation has already begun for the
[1:00:20] Jews to be in the land to receive their
[1:00:23] two prophets. Amen.
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:29] Amen. All right, let's let's go on. Uh
[1:00:33] verse uh verse 10 says, "And ye shall
[1:00:37] hallow the 50th year and proclaim
[1:00:39] liberty throughout all the land and to
[1:00:42] all the inhabitants thereof. It shall be
[1:00:44] a jubilee unto you, and ye shall return
[1:00:46] every man unto his possession. And uh ye
[1:00:49] shall return every man unto his family.
[1:00:51] A jubilee shall that 50th year be unto
[1:00:53] you. Ye shall not uh sow, neither reap
[1:00:57] that which groweth of itself in it, nor
[1:00:59] gather the grapes in it uh of thy vine
[1:01:02] undress, for it is the jubilee. It shall
[1:01:05] be holy unto you. Ye shall eat the
[1:01:08] increase thereof out of the field in the
[1:01:10] year of jubilee. Uh ye shall return
[1:01:14] every man unto his possession. All
[1:01:17] right. The Lord add a blessing to the
[1:01:19] reading of his word. You can be seated.
[1:01:22] Amen. in the presence of the Lord. And
[1:01:25] um as I said uh this is Jubilee year
[1:01:30] part
[1:01:42] three. And um we want to just do a a
[1:01:46] little reading uh here. And
[1:01:51] um I I I kind of I am trying my best to
[1:01:55] I'm coming out the gate ready to just
[1:01:58] fire and and I'm trying to find a a
[1:02:03] pace.
[1:02:04] Amen. Because um it's it's important
[1:02:07] that we we get some things church.
[1:02:12] We had a prophet. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:02:16] And um when God sent this prophet to us,
[1:02:20] he brought he brought um a lot of um I
[1:02:25] mean he he brought a lot of light on
[1:02:27] scripture and um you know one of the
[1:02:30] things I've been trying to share um even
[1:02:35] in our Bible study I I shared how Samuel
[1:02:40] uh being a prophet of the Lord Samuel
[1:02:42] grew
[1:02:44] in his understanding. ing. Samuel grew
[1:02:47] in his uh stature. Samuel grew in his
[1:02:50] wisdom. Uh Samuel grew in all these
[1:02:53] ways. And and and and the other thing
[1:02:54] that we read there in in Bible study
[1:02:56] when we talk about Samuel is that God
[1:02:59] did not let one word that came out of
[1:03:02] Samuel's mouth while he was growing.
[1:03:05] God didn't let one word fall to the
[1:03:07] ground. Amen. This is important. So, so,
[1:03:10] so, so understand that as Samuel grew,
[1:03:14] Amen. We also we grow in our
[1:03:17] understanding. We grow in our knowledge.
[1:03:20] We grow in our wisdom. Amen. When it
[1:03:22] comes to the things of God and I have
[1:03:24] you to also understand brother Brandham
[1:03:27] grew.
[1:03:29] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now just because
[1:03:31] he was growing and he might have made
[1:03:34] one statement here in this year and then
[1:03:37] he makes another statement over here in
[1:03:38] this year and then he makes another
[1:03:40] statement over here in this year. It
[1:03:42] doesn't mean that the statement he made
[1:03:43] over there was wrong. Amen. He was
[1:03:46] simply growing and that's still a part
[1:03:49] of it. Right. So, so, so, so we can't
[1:03:51] just kind of discredit things because a
[1:03:54] person is growing.
[1:03:57] Amen. But the the key to this is being
[1:04:00] able to just kind of follow the growth.
[1:04:03] Amen. Right. And you got to be able to
[1:04:05] follow growth because what happens here,
[1:04:07] Amen. And in our messages, somebody will
[1:04:09] hear something said before 63 and then
[1:04:12] try to throw that all out. Right. Right.
[1:04:15] Then they will hear something in 63 and
[1:04:18] then forget everything he said after it.
[1:04:21] Praise God. But you got to be able to
[1:04:23] take what he said before 63. You got to
[1:04:26] be able to say take what he said in 63
[1:04:28] and what he said after 63. And when you
[1:04:31] put all of that together, now you got a
[1:04:33] a really good picture. Amen. Amen. Oh,
[1:04:36] hallelujah. I was just sharing you know
[1:04:38] with some brothers. Brother Brandon made
[1:04:40] a statement in the church age book. He
[1:04:41] said you know um there is a a mighty a
[1:04:46] mighty initial illumination of the
[1:04:50] church ages. And then he says out of the
[1:04:52] church ages amen come the uh seals. And
[1:04:56] then out of the seals he said comes the
[1:04:58] trumpets. And then out of the trumpets
[1:05:00] he said comes the vows. And he says now
[1:05:02] he says there's a mighty initial
[1:05:04] illumination. But then he said after
[1:05:06] that light upon light will follow.
[1:05:09] That's right. So if there's going to be
[1:05:11] a mighty illumination, something's going
[1:05:13] to like wow. But then light upon light
[1:05:16] going to follow that wow. And you got to
[1:05:18] be able to catch the light upon light.
[1:05:22] That's it. All right. Amen. All right.
[1:05:26] So, um, you know,
[1:05:30] uh, I want to just, uh, kind of catch a
[1:05:33] little something here, and I'm going I'm
[1:05:36] I told you I just, let me, let me just
[1:05:39] start where I where I want to start
[1:05:40] here. Mark of the Beast. Let me just
[1:05:41] pick that up. And, and I I um, I'm just
[1:05:44] going to read a few things here. Says,
[1:05:47] uh, now at the going forth of this
[1:05:49] Jubilee year, it was to be sounded
[1:05:52] throughout all the land. A trumpet was
[1:05:54] to sound and this trumpet would make the
[1:05:57] distinction. The trumpet would make the
[1:06:00] distinction. Uh for the trumpet was the
[1:06:03] 50th year sound that led every slave
[1:06:06] that had been uh bought or become poor
[1:06:09] poor and could not care for his for his
[1:06:11] own. He had fell beneath a load and his
[1:06:14] master for his debt had brought him and
[1:06:17] placed him into a field as a slave and
[1:06:20] he had to serve him for he was too poor
[1:06:22] to redeem himself. But God said remember
[1:06:27] uh you were one-time slaves yourself and
[1:06:29] down in Egypt and and I have freed you.
[1:06:31] Therefore, at the sounding of the
[1:06:32] trumpet, every slave, no matter how long
[1:06:35] he's been in or or how short a time he's
[1:06:39] at liberty to return to his family, to
[1:06:42] return to his people, and be free of
[1:06:44] every debt. Uh for it's a time of
[1:06:47] jubilee. And I like that just, you know,
[1:06:49] uh when when that Jubilee trumpet
[1:06:51] sounds, every slave, no matter how long
[1:06:53] you've been a slave, you had you had
[1:06:55] just because the trumpet sound, you had
[1:06:57] the liberty or the freedom to leave
[1:06:59] whatever you were part of. my God. And
[1:07:02] and and this this is not just, you know,
[1:07:05] uh for for for the people of Israel that
[1:07:07] were bound in in slavery, but this is
[1:07:09] for the people of God today that's bound
[1:07:12] in slavery of sin. Amen. When you hear
[1:07:15] the Jubilee trumpet, you don't have to
[1:07:17] remain in sin. You can go free. And the
[1:07:21] Jubilee trumpet is none other than the
[1:07:23] the gospel trumpet being sounded to you.
[1:07:26] When the gospel tells you that you're
[1:07:27] free, then you're free. Amen. Bot bottom
[1:07:30] line here. He goes on. It says a even uh
[1:07:33] you wasn't to plant to plant it any any
[1:07:37] corn and ever what the field produce uh
[1:07:39] you was to live on it. You shouldn't
[1:07:42] trim your vineyard or anything. The the
[1:07:44] poor of the land was to eat of it. A
[1:07:47] very beautiful type of the millennium.
[1:07:49] Uh notice every slave when he heard that
[1:07:52] trumpet sound uh he could throw down his
[1:07:55] hoe whatever he's working with and say I
[1:07:57] am a free man. I couldn't redeem myself
[1:08:01] but God through his grace has declared a
[1:08:03] year jubilee. Therefore I believe God uh
[1:08:07] it says um it says and I don't have to
[1:08:09] work anymore and the laws of the land
[1:08:12] claimed him free. The law actually made
[1:08:16] him free. It says but what a what a
[1:08:17] beautiful type today. poor aliens.
[1:08:20] Nothing we could do. If we kept every
[1:08:22] Sabbath, every new moon, we quit eating
[1:08:25] meat. If we kept all kinds of days and
[1:08:27] and done all kinds of religious
[1:08:29] sacrifices, we are under a load. We are
[1:08:32] sold in sin. Our parents sold us out to
[1:08:36] sin in the Garden of Eden. And we are we
[1:08:38] are laden under the bonds of sin as a
[1:08:40] slave to the devil. We were born in sin,
[1:08:43] shaped in iniquity, come to the world
[1:08:46] speaking lies. He say there's nothing we
[1:08:48] can do to help us because our whole
[1:08:51] makeup, our whole nature and everything
[1:08:52] we are is sin.
[1:08:56] He says but what happens you know when
[1:08:58] we realize we're in that condition and
[1:09:00] we can't help ourselves. He says but
[1:09:02] when the jubilee comes
[1:09:04] that we are free and the trumpet is the
[1:09:07] gospel the good news. The trumpet was
[1:09:09] the wh what what was the gospel then?
[1:09:11] The good news you're no longer bound.
[1:09:14] You no longer have to live in sin. You
[1:09:17] can go home and be free. You don't owe
[1:09:19] any debts at all. The whole emancipation
[1:09:22] proclamation's done signed and you are
[1:09:24] free. I I I I thank God for that. You
[1:09:27] know, there was, you know, the reason
[1:09:28] that we celebrate in June, this this new
[1:09:31] holiday, Junth, uh because there was a a
[1:09:35] a bunch of people, I believe in Texas,
[1:09:37] that uh they they did not realize
[1:09:40] emancipation had been signed and they
[1:09:41] were free. They they were actually free
[1:09:43] for uh half a year and didn't know it.
[1:09:47] Half a year. They still working in
[1:09:49] bondage and and and and the law had set
[1:09:52] them free.
[1:09:54] The law had already set them free, but
[1:09:56] they had no idea that they was they were
[1:09:58] still bound. Evidently, nobody told them
[1:10:00] the good news. But once you hear the
[1:10:03] good news, praise God, everything
[1:10:06] changes at that point in time. You think
[1:10:09] different about yourself when you hear
[1:10:10] the good news. Amen. Amen. How you
[1:10:13] realize, no, I'm not a I'm not a slave.
[1:10:15] I'm not a slave no more. I'm a property
[1:10:18] owner,
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:22] I own property, right? I got a house
[1:10:25] that I can go back to. And and my
[1:10:28] there's no more mortgage on my house.
[1:10:30] There's no more mortgage on me. There's
[1:10:32] Everything changes when you hear the
[1:10:34] gospel trumpet.
[1:10:37] Amen. And our our job is to try to sound
[1:10:39] that gospel trumpet to let people know
[1:10:41] that they're free. Oh my God. God sent
[1:10:42] us a message where we didn't have to
[1:10:44] live in bondage anymore. Amen. No, this
[1:10:47] was a message of freedom, a liberation.
[1:10:49] Amen. A liberation from from church
[1:10:51] annity and denominationalism. Liberation
[1:10:54] from the world. Liberation from anything
[1:10:56] the devil tried to use to to bind us up.
[1:10:58] Brother Brandham goes on to say
[1:10:59] something here. He says, "And today," he
[1:11:01] says, "When a man hears the good news,
[1:11:03] Christ died and you're dead. Uh, nothing
[1:11:06] that you can do about it. Christ paid
[1:11:09] the price. The gospel sound," and I love
[1:11:12] this. I love You can drop every
[1:11:14] cigarette. And I mentioned this to you
[1:11:16] in the past, but I never got a chance to
[1:11:17] read it, so I wanted to take time to
[1:11:19] read it today. You can drop every
[1:11:21] cigarette. Yeah, cigarette is sin. Yes,
[1:11:24] it is. God don't want you. And oh, Lord
[1:11:26] have mercy. I think I mentioned this
[1:11:28] before. I'll mention it again. There's a
[1:11:29] big problem with vaping nowadays.
[1:11:32] That's included in this. You can drop
[1:11:34] your vapor. Yes, sir. Praise God. You
[1:11:37] ain't got to vape no more. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:39] They say they got more young people
[1:11:41] vaping nowadays than ever. And don't
[1:11:44] realize they they still destroying
[1:11:45] themselves. The devil trying to kill you
[1:11:47] at a very young age. But when you hear
[1:11:49] the Jubilee trumpet sound, you don't
[1:11:50] have to go back to vaping anymore. Amen.
[1:11:53] Right. Say to God, you can drop every
[1:11:55] cigarette, every chew tobacco. My Lord.
[1:11:58] Amen. Amen. Right. He says, "Every
[1:12:00] whiskey bottle, everything that's
[1:12:03] binding you and say, "I am free." Praise
[1:12:06] God. This is the good news. Christ has
[1:12:09] made me free. You're free people. You
[1:12:11] don't have to go any longer. You don't
[1:12:13] have to serve the devil any longer. You
[1:12:15] can be free if you desire to be free.
[1:12:19] And that's critical there. If you desire
[1:12:21] this freedom, you can have this freedom.
[1:12:24] All right. He says, "Now if you don't,"
[1:12:26] he said, "you don't have to drink. You
[1:12:28] don't have to run around, you don't have
[1:12:30] to mistreat your wife." Now, even in a
[1:12:33] jubilee,
[1:12:35] amen, your household can go free. Praise
[1:12:38] God. Because of the way you treating
[1:12:39] your wife or maybe the way the wife
[1:12:41] treating the husband, praise the Lord.
[1:12:43] But, Brother Brand, I'm saying that you
[1:12:45] believe both of y'all can go free.
[1:12:48] Oh, hallelujah. Now, I'm going tell you
[1:12:50] something. Amen. And in order to go
[1:12:52] free, you're going to have to be able to
[1:12:53] forgive somebody. You got to be able to
[1:12:55] drop some alts. You have to let some of
[1:12:57] that stuff go. If you want to go free,
[1:13:02] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All
[1:13:05] right. He says, you don't have to
[1:13:06] mistreat. You don't have to mistreat
[1:13:07] your wife. You don't have to curse.
[1:13:10] All right. You can go free in the
[1:13:12] Jubilee. You can stop your cursing.
[1:13:15] Amen. You don't have to lie.
[1:13:18] Glory to God. Tell the truth and shame
[1:13:20] the devil. That you don't have to steal.
[1:13:24] You don't have to be weary when you come
[1:13:26] to a jubilee.
[1:13:27] Praise God. Says, "Wow, you got
[1:13:30] resources up yonder that's never been
[1:13:33] tapped of the bountiful blessings of God
[1:13:35] that the world knows nothing about.
[1:13:39] All this is yours at the Jubilee."
[1:13:43] Praise God. Amen. I think um you know
[1:13:47] I'm going to stop at the reading there,
[1:13:49] but um if you'll scroll back up to I
[1:13:52] think um I I put you I said scroll back
[1:13:55] up to paragraph 56. Just get that one
[1:13:57] ready for me. Uh just remember a jubilee
[1:14:00] and a jubilee uh anytime there's a
[1:14:03] jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[1:14:05] grace to his people. And uh when God's
[1:14:08] grace is coming to you, he realized
[1:14:09] there's nothing you can do about it. You
[1:14:11] done got yourself in a fix. and and and
[1:14:14] and I use the example of Sarah and
[1:14:17] Abraham when Sarah went down there to
[1:14:19] Beimilec and Abraham uh and her came up
[1:14:22] with that lie. You can stop your lying
[1:14:24] in the Jubilee, right? But uh but they
[1:14:26] came up with lie said, "Tell them you
[1:14:28] are my sister." And when it went down
[1:14:30] there, they got into a fix. Uh Abraham
[1:14:33] told this man, "Yeah, she my sister."
[1:14:34] And she validated, "Yeah, that's my
[1:14:37] brother." And oh, well, if y'all brother
[1:14:38] and sister, then great. I got myself a
[1:14:41] new wife. And the man takes Sarah right
[1:14:43] on down to his house. Now, the scripture
[1:14:45] don't tell us how long she was in that
[1:14:48] man's house. Now, I can tell you this
[1:14:50] much. She was in there long enough for
[1:14:53] every womb to close.
[1:14:56] Yes, sir.
[1:14:58] Every womb was closed because nobody
[1:15:00] could have kids while Sarah was there.
[1:15:03] And if they wanted the wombs open, they
[1:15:05] had to release Sarah.
[1:15:07] Hallelujah. So, so we don't really know
[1:15:09] how long she was there, but she she had
[1:15:11] to be there for a little little longer
[1:15:12] than overnight. Now, now you can imagine
[1:15:15] what Abraham is going through every day
[1:15:18] that he's like, I just gave my wife
[1:15:21] away. I cannot believe what I just did.
[1:15:25] I mean, the man was in a helpless
[1:15:29] situation. That's right. Yes. God told
[1:15:32] him. He said he he was never even
[1:15:34] supposed to leave where he was at, but
[1:15:36] he ends up in this helpless situation
[1:15:38] because of this lie he came up with.
[1:15:40] Now, sometimes we find ourselves in
[1:15:42] helpless
[1:15:44] situations. And this is why we need the
[1:15:46] grace of God to come and give us a
[1:15:49] jubilee. God, I don't know how I got
[1:15:52] into this mess. God, I don't know what
[1:15:55] happened to me. How how did I make a
[1:15:57] decision like this? Look at me. Amen.
[1:16:00] God, I need a jubilee.
[1:16:03] Amen. And the and the beautiful part is
[1:16:05] that he he he provides it for us. Amen.
[1:16:08] He provides it. A jubilee is God's
[1:16:11] manner of expressing grace to his people
[1:16:13] for restoring all he brought back uh to
[1:16:16] their rightful position. A jubilee was
[1:16:21] amentor. And the other thing that we we
[1:16:23] we read there in the scripture, every
[1:16:25] seven years they were also supposed to
[1:16:26] leave their land unsewn. and um and and
[1:16:29] what's what's going on because a Jubilee
[1:16:31] is a restoration. So now now most people
[1:16:34] read Leviticus 25 and they'd only go
[1:16:36] down there to verse 9 or 10 and and they
[1:16:38] said when we talk about that 50 year we
[1:16:40] talk about the Jubilee and yes I I I
[1:16:42] agree with you 100%. But a prophet also
[1:16:44] helps us to see that that that every
[1:16:47] seven years something was happening.
[1:16:48] There was a release happening even the
[1:16:51] land itself was going through a
[1:16:53] restoration process and a jubilee is a
[1:16:56] restoration. Amen.
[1:16:59] Hallelujah. If they would obey the word
[1:17:02] of God and not plant anything in that
[1:17:06] seventh year and g let the land rest,
[1:17:09] God told them, "If you obey me in the
[1:17:12] sixth year, I'm going to cause I love
[1:17:16] this. Give me a Leviticus 25 and 21." Uh
[1:17:19] but but in in the sixth year, if you
[1:17:21] would obey, Amen. this, then I'm going
[1:17:24] to cause your your land to Amen. to to
[1:17:26] actually increase. And in that sixth
[1:17:28] year, you're going to get enough in the
[1:17:29] sixth year to last you for three years.
[1:17:32] The sixth year was a year of overflow.
[1:17:35] Yes, sir. Look at this in in in
[1:17:38] Leviticus 25 and and uh and and 21. It
[1:17:41] says, "Then I will command my blessings
[1:17:45] upon you in the sixth year, and it shall
[1:17:47] bring forth fruit for three years." Now,
[1:17:50] here's the other thing I I want I want
[1:17:51] to just mention there. This is a
[1:17:54] commandment.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah. Right. You get that? Let me
[1:18:00] put it this way. If a blessing didn't
[1:18:02] want to come your way, come on.
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:08] I ain't going nowhere. I ain't If a
[1:18:13] God God say I will command.
[1:18:17] Yes, Lord. Which mean I'mma make that
[1:18:20] blessing. Oh my. And it's not just it's
[1:18:22] not just it's not just a blessing,
[1:18:26] right? This is this this is enough.
[1:18:28] Amen. To satisfy you for 3 years. This
[1:18:30] is this is a huge blessing.
[1:18:34] This is what we call a overflow
[1:18:35] blessing. My God. My God. My God. I will
[1:18:39] command it. Amen. I'll command my
[1:18:41] blessing upon you in the sixth year and
[1:18:43] it shall bring forth fruit for three
[1:18:46] years. All right. So we realize if we
[1:18:48] follow the word of God then there are
[1:18:50] blessings. Amen. That are attached to
[1:18:52] our obedience. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] Want
[1:18:58] to slip into something
[1:19:01] here. Amen. For a little bit. Now, I'm
[1:19:05] going back to that paragraph
[1:19:07] 56 out of the same sermon, the mark of
[1:19:10] the
[1:19:11] beast.
[1:19:14] Um, brother Brandham says, I think I got
[1:19:18] this notice in the Old Testament. That's
[1:19:20] where I'm starting at. It might be
[1:19:24] above. It's notice in the Old
[1:19:28] Testament. It says the Bible said that
[1:19:32] there was to be a 50th year jubilee and
[1:19:35] that was seven times seven years. It
[1:19:38] says and in the 49th year that it was to
[1:19:42] be made ready. Uh and the 50th year was
[1:19:45] the jubilee. 50 means jubilee. It was 50
[1:19:49] is God's jubilee number. The word
[1:19:50] Pentecost means 50. So uh uh 50 is
[1:19:54] Jubilee and the word Pentecost means 50.
[1:19:57] Now we're going to get to talking about
[1:19:59] that feast of Pentecost again. Um uh we
[1:20:02] talked about that before, but we're
[1:20:04] going to kind of go back into that again
[1:20:05] today. It says 50 is God's Jubilee
[1:20:08] number. The word Pentecost means 50. It
[1:20:11] was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at
[1:20:13] the end of the 50 days. It was also the
[1:20:17] end of the 50th year. It was also the
[1:20:20] end of the 50th year. Now he goes on to
[1:20:24] say this says Jesus come to foreshadow
[1:20:28] or forewarn rather people of the coming
[1:20:31] year of Jubilee. He went into the
[1:20:35] synagogue at Capernaum and sat down and
[1:20:37] taken uh the scripture and turned it
[1:20:39] over to Isaiah 61:1 and read the
[1:20:41] scripture. And I I just want to catch
[1:20:43] this. said, "The spirit of the Lord is
[1:20:45] upon me, uh, for he hath anointed me to
[1:20:47] preach the acceptable year of the Lord,
[1:20:48] to set uh, the captives at liberty and
[1:20:52] to give sight to the blind." And when he
[1:20:54] got through reading, he sat down and
[1:20:57] hand the scripture back to the priests.
[1:20:59] And he said, "This day the scriptures
[1:21:01] fulfilled in your ears and eyes." He
[1:21:04] says, "You see it?" And I like this
[1:21:05] statement. It says, "For he was giving
[1:21:08] forth the warning of the coming forth of
[1:21:11] the great gusher of Pentecost." Just put
[1:21:14] that in. Great gusher of Pentecost. Uh
[1:21:17] he was giving forth the warning, amen,
[1:21:21] of the coming forth of the great gusher
[1:21:24] of Pentecost. Amen. Now, watch this
[1:21:27] statement. He says to He says, "To set
[1:21:29] at liberty everyone that was slaves to
[1:21:31] sin and bound." Now, now when brother
[1:21:33] Random says that he's given forth uh
[1:21:36] this warning of the great gusher of
[1:21:39] Pentecost, when I see that, I see
[1:21:43] overflow. Right. Now, I want to I want
[1:21:46] to just just hit that just for a little
[1:21:49] bit. I I thank God for the overflow in
[1:21:52] the natural realm. I thank God that
[1:21:56] people getting raises, Amen. and and and
[1:21:59] opportunities that they they never even
[1:22:01] imagined. and and God is blessing with
[1:22:03] with homes and God is blessing with cars
[1:22:06] and and God is blessing in all these
[1:22:08] natural amen ways. I thank God for that.
[1:22:11] But let me tell you something. Amen.
[1:22:13] When that rapture take place, you won't
[1:22:15] be taking your car. You won't be taking
[1:22:17] your home. And and your job going to
[1:22:20] find somebody else to work there.
[1:22:23] Praise God. Amen. Those things take care
[1:22:26] of you while you here on earth. But we
[1:22:27] are we are heavenly bound creatures. So
[1:22:30] we thank God for all the earthly
[1:22:32] blessings. But brother, don't you
[1:22:34] forget. And sister, don't you forget
[1:22:36] about these spiritual blessings that we
[1:22:38] are desperately in need of. And if God
[1:22:42] blesses you in the natural, you ought to
[1:22:43] be praying, God, amen, I need this to
[1:22:46] balance out on the spiritual side. You
[1:22:49] didn't give me a new job to take me out
[1:22:51] of church.
[1:22:52] The devil is still a liar. No, God don't
[1:22:55] bless like that. That's that's not what
[1:22:58] we talking about. So, so we're looking
[1:23:00] for just like we getting this great
[1:23:02] gushure of earthly blessings, let there
[1:23:05] also be a great gusher of Pentecost,
[1:23:09] an overflow of Pentecost.
[1:23:13] Amen. God let it be right here at Spirit
[1:23:15] and Truth Tabernacle.
[1:23:18] It says he was given a warning of the
[1:23:20] coming forth of the great gush of
[1:23:21] Pentecost to set at liberty everyone
[1:23:25] that was slaves to sin. That's right.
[1:23:27] and bow. Now, now, now just think about
[1:23:30] this statement. The great
[1:23:32] gusher of Pentecost is to do what? To
[1:23:36] set at liberty. That's right. Everyone
[1:23:39] that was slaves to sin and bound. You
[1:23:43] realize that sometimes you get yourself
[1:23:45] in such a fix that only the Holy Ghost
[1:23:49] can get you out of it.
[1:23:51] Amen. No man can get you out of it. No
[1:23:54] woman can get you out. The pastor can't.
[1:23:56] But the Holy, let me let me let me let
[1:23:59] me say it this way. The Holy Ghost will
[1:24:00] not only get you out, but the Holy Ghost
[1:24:03] will keep you out. Hallelujah. Yes, he
[1:24:07] will. We need a gusher of Pentecost.
[1:24:12] Exactly right, brother. Father, don't
[1:24:14] let that go by us. We We want to be
[1:24:16] desperate for a gusher of Pent. The same
[1:24:18] way you pay praying for natural
[1:24:20] blessings, you ought to be praying for
[1:24:22] spiritual blessings. God, let the Holy
[1:24:24] Ghost come in just take over the
[1:24:26] service. Hallelujah. We We want to walk
[1:24:29] out like drunk men and drunk women
[1:24:32] staggering underneath the power of God.
[1:24:35] Lord, you promised it. You said in the
[1:24:38] last days, I will pour out my spirit
[1:24:41] upon all flesh. Your sons and your
[1:24:44] daughters will I mean, say you you going
[1:24:46] to do something great in this place.
[1:24:49] Hallelujah. They'll prophesy. They'll
[1:24:51] dream dreams. I still see visions. The
[1:24:53] these are the things we want to see.
[1:24:56] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:24:59] spiritual part of a gush of Pentecost.
[1:25:01] I'm talking about our young people
[1:25:03] having an experience with God.
[1:25:05] God will shake them in a dream.
[1:25:09] They wake up telling, "Mom, I don't want
[1:25:10] to wear that no more, and I don't want
[1:25:12] to do this no more. And I and I what
[1:25:14] what happened to you?" I had a dream. I
[1:25:16] missed the rapture. Oh yeah.
[1:25:22] And then it's going from house to house,
[1:25:24] dreams everywhere. People want to get
[1:25:26] their life right with God. Lord, it's a
[1:25:29] gusher of Pentecost.
[1:25:31] All right. All right. All right. So,
[1:25:34] this is the overflow and the spiritual
[1:25:36] that we're under expectation for. Now,
[1:25:40] I'm going to make a a turn here. Amen.
[1:25:43] and and I'm going to a a sermon
[1:25:48] um titled the feast of the
[1:25:51] trumpets. This is a very important
[1:25:54] sermon that brother Brandon preaches.
[1:25:58] And um the reason that this sermon is
[1:26:01] important is because now now now first
[1:26:04] of all you know and and everybody would
[1:26:06] say this. Uh brother Brandham said
[1:26:10] um I think there was like two really
[1:26:12] really inspired um sermons that he he he
[1:26:16] you know he felt that he gave. One was
[1:26:18] uh the token uh he felt that that was a
[1:26:21] very inspired sermon and a very
[1:26:22] important sermon for people to realize
[1:26:23] and yes and I agree. And then the other
[1:26:26] one was when he preached the seals. You
[1:26:28] know, this this was this was very
[1:26:30] inspired, supernatural. Supernatural. I
[1:26:32] mean, the angels of the Lord uh met him
[1:26:34] in Tucson, Arizona. Uh sent him back
[1:26:37] east from Tucson to um Jeffersonville
[1:26:41] and gave him supernatural instruction
[1:26:44] every day on which how to preach the
[1:26:46] seal. He had preached it before. Had to
[1:26:48] come back and and said, "No, that ain't
[1:26:50] the right thing. The angel showed me it
[1:26:52] this way. It's this way. It's this way.
[1:26:53] It's this way." Now, now please please
[1:26:56] try to try to understand
[1:26:58] this. When a angel is bringing to you
[1:27:03] the revelation of the word of God, a
[1:27:07] angel now, not not not not me up here
[1:27:10] preaching, trying to bring re an angel
[1:27:12] from God shows up in your room and says,
[1:27:16] "No, this scripture, this scripture,
[1:27:19] this scripture." Now, now just just
[1:27:21] understand this. That type of presence
[1:27:24] is so great you cannot even capture it
[1:27:28] all in that moment.
[1:27:31] Amen. So it it it takes light upon light
[1:27:35] following that. Please try to understand
[1:27:38] this right because there are things that
[1:27:40] people would go back to the seals and
[1:27:42] and yes that's the mighty initial
[1:27:44] illumination. Right. Right. Yes. That's
[1:27:47] it. And everything he said that was
[1:27:49] right, but the light upon light that
[1:27:51] follows it. That's what we got to watch.
[1:27:55] Right. So, so, so here in in feast of
[1:27:58] the trumpets, it's a light upon light
[1:28:00] that follow what was spoken in the six
[1:28:03] in the seven seals. Now, I I don't have
[1:28:06] time to read all of this and we can I
[1:28:09] mean, it would take us weeks to go over
[1:28:11] just just listening to the seals and
[1:28:13] getting that. It would take weeks, but
[1:28:15] just just bear with me. So, here,
[1:28:17] brother Random makes a statement, and
[1:28:19] we're going to uh just comb through this
[1:28:20] just a little bit. Feast of the trumpet.
[1:28:22] He says, "See, the atonement
[1:28:25] followed." Watch now. The atonement
[1:28:27] followed the trumpet sound. Uhhuh.
[1:28:32] Amen. See how beautiful the atonement
[1:28:35] day followed the trumpet. Now, the 50
[1:28:38] days of trumpets. Now when he's using 50
[1:28:41] days, you know that that's talking about
[1:28:42] a jubilee. 50 days of the trumpets for
[1:28:45] us symbolized when the trumpet sounded
[1:28:47] at Pentecost. Say which was 50 days. Now
[1:28:50] after this, the Jews rejected that. It
[1:28:54] says now now so so so uh even there in
[1:28:58] um in Jesus day when he's talking about
[1:29:01] the Jews rejected um in Jesus day it was
[1:29:04] the Jews that put Jesus on the cross. It
[1:29:07] was the Jews that caused him uh to be uh
[1:29:11] uh killed in a very cruel manner. They
[1:29:14] they elected to have um Jesus Barabbus
[1:29:20] rather than Jesus the Christ.
[1:29:23] That was the Jews choice. And then they
[1:29:26] made this comment, let his blood be on
[1:29:30] us
[1:29:31] and on our children. And do you know
[1:29:34] brother Brandham told us that that was
[1:29:38] fulfilled.
[1:29:40] Amen. Under Hitler
[1:29:43] Ikeman sir Stalin when they when they
[1:29:47] cried out let his blood be on us that
[1:29:48] was fulfilled under Hitman uh uh uh
[1:29:51] Ikeman Hitler and Stalin's I mean they
[1:29:54] it was fulfilled that time. So what
[1:29:55] we're showing is that there's some past
[1:29:57] tense things that happened and people
[1:29:59] still waiting on some future tense
[1:30:01] events. Oh Lord. Oh my, we crossing over
[1:30:04] into something now. There's people
[1:30:07] waiting for something to happen in the
[1:30:09] future. Don't realize it's already
[1:30:10] passed. And and I and I'm not just
[1:30:13] saying that. I'm going to read to you
[1:30:15] where brother Brandham said
[1:30:18] that these things happen at the same
[1:30:20] time.
[1:30:22] Right. That's right. I'mma read to you.
[1:30:25] Say the sixth seal which is to the Jews
[1:30:27] and the sixth trumpet sounds at the same
[1:30:30] time. And then he also said the six
[1:30:33] trumpets sounded
[1:30:35] under Hitler Stalin Ikeman
[1:30:40] past tense.
[1:30:42] So there. So we're looking we're looking
[1:30:43] at this scripture and because we can't
[1:30:45] figure it out with our own minds. Well,
[1:30:48] I'm not talking about your mind figuring
[1:30:49] this out. Sometimes you just have to say
[1:30:52] amen to a prophet. That's right.
[1:30:55] Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] Oh my. I told you I see. You know, when
[1:30:59] Jesus walked into the temple that day
[1:31:01] and and he picked up the book and they
[1:31:02] gave him Isaiah and he read it and he
[1:31:05] sat down, Brother Ram said that was the
[1:31:06] greatest anointing upon anybody because
[1:31:08] he knew where he was.
[1:31:11] Amen.
[1:31:13] Come on. And when you know where you
[1:31:15] are,
[1:31:17] brothers, you under a great anointing.
[1:31:20] It might not be an anointing to make
[1:31:21] people shout and jump and run around the
[1:31:23] building, but my God, it will settle
[1:31:26] them.
[1:31:28] Amen.
[1:31:29] Let me keep reading please. It says now
[1:31:32] the trumpets. Now, now watch this. Now
[1:31:34] it says first the 50 days of the
[1:31:35] trumpets for us symbolized when the
[1:31:37] trumpet sounded at Pentecost which was
[1:31:39] 50 days. Now after this the Jews
[1:31:42] rejected that. So the Jews rejected him
[1:31:44] in that time. Not not only and did they
[1:31:46] take him to the cross but when Paul
[1:31:48] comes along uh Paul Paul makes a
[1:31:51] statement. He says now I'm coming here
[1:31:53] and I'm preaching and and the Jews just
[1:31:54] won't won't accept anything that I'm
[1:31:56] preaching. So Paul turned around and
[1:31:57] says, "Well, we are turning to the
[1:32:00] Gentiles because the Gentiles wanted the
[1:32:02] word." The Jews didn't want it. The
[1:32:04] Gentiles want it. And the ages began at
[1:32:06] that point.
[1:32:08] That's why we got seven church ages
[1:32:10] because Paul being the first messenger,
[1:32:12] he said, "I'm turning to the Gentiles."
[1:32:16] And you know that the Gentiles been
[1:32:18] receiving the word for this whatever
[1:32:20] time period brother Brandham calls this
[1:32:22] time
[1:32:24] period, right? that it he he calls it
[1:32:27] the uh Pentecostal feast,
[1:32:30] right? Oh my. All right. So, this is
[1:32:32] where we are now. Watch. But now, and
[1:32:34] we'll read this in scripture in a
[1:32:36] second. After the Pentecostal feast,
[1:32:38] after all of that, then there is a a
[1:32:40] time of atonement, which it goes back to
[1:32:42] the Jews, right? All right. And that
[1:32:44] that's where uh oh, let me just pause by
[1:32:46] saying
[1:32:47] this. Um church, signs are all around
[1:32:52] us.
[1:32:54] The coming of the Lord is on us.
[1:32:59] You all heard this week that a pope
[1:33:01] passed.
[1:33:04] And
[1:33:05] uh your our prophet told us a few
[1:33:09] things.
[1:33:11] Uh there's a couple things that he said,
[1:33:14] right? And many of them have been
[1:33:15] fulfilled. One of them he told us that
[1:33:17] there would be a woman president or vice
[1:33:20] president or it would be the Catholic
[1:33:22] Church.
[1:33:23] Okay. Now, the other thing that he told
[1:33:26] us is that there would be a pope rise up
[1:33:31] from America.
[1:33:35] And you know who's in charge right now
[1:33:36] of everything with this current
[1:33:39] situation with the Pope passing, the guy
[1:33:41] that has to go in and and research and
[1:33:44] make sure what's the cause of death and
[1:33:46] all that, it's a man from America.
[1:33:49] Hallelujah. There's articles all over
[1:33:51] the place about will there be a pope
[1:33:53] that comes out of America.
[1:33:56] There's articles all over. You can read
[1:33:57] it all over the internet. Y'all watch
[1:34:00] this because a prophet already told us
[1:34:02] these things were going to happen. Now,
[1:34:03] now now look, if if a pope comes from
[1:34:07] America now, first of all, Lord, I ain't
[1:34:09] got time for all this. Uh, Revelation
[1:34:12] 13, it speaks of the US
[1:34:16] and how she will she would give her
[1:34:18] power or encourage everybody to give it
[1:34:19] power to the beast.
[1:34:24] We living in the fulfillment of all of
[1:34:26] this right now. And let me tell you,
[1:34:27] things are going to happen so fast, you
[1:34:30] won't have time to catch up. Oh, I can't
[1:34:33] wait to get to church. Maybe brother
[1:34:34] Jack said, "No, no. You better be
[1:34:36] listening to this message yourself at
[1:34:38] home and you better stay in contact with
[1:34:40] God because things are going to happen
[1:34:43] real quick." That's right, brother.
[1:34:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. I want to tell you
[1:34:47] something else that's going to happen
[1:34:48] quick. We're going to be changed in a
[1:34:51] moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:34:54] Amen. You better be ready for it. Amen.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah. We got time to be fighting
[1:35:00] with makeup and and and and cutting hair
[1:35:03] and not cutting hair and come on,
[1:35:06] earrings and pants and uh what are we
[1:35:08] talking about? We we we should be way
[1:35:12] beyond that now. Amen. Yeah. No, no, no,
[1:35:15] no, no. I tell you what, if you got a
[1:35:17] gush of the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't
[1:35:18] have to worry about that no more. You
[1:35:20] have something on the inside that cause
[1:35:22] you to love God more than you love those
[1:35:23] things.
[1:35:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise God. I I want
[1:35:29] to see people make it.
[1:35:31] See, I'm going to tell you, brother
[1:35:33] Brandham even told a lady, he say he say
[1:35:36] uh the sister come uh I don't know was
[1:35:39] no I don't know if it's a vision or
[1:35:40] what, but I think it was a vision and
[1:35:42] the lady has some high heels on in the
[1:35:44] vision. He say, "Sister, you ain't going
[1:35:45] to make it like that." Right? He said,
[1:35:48] "Don't tell me I can make it whatever
[1:35:49] way I want to." And say they got they
[1:35:51] got so close to she thought she was
[1:35:53] going to cross over and she fell off.
[1:35:56] Right. Right. into abyss. Now, the
[1:35:58] prophet already told us how to conduct
[1:36:00] ourselves. Follow the word of God. We
[1:36:03] don't have time to be fighting in this
[1:36:05] area anymore. If you want that, you can
[1:36:07] have it. They going to have the same
[1:36:08] thing in hell. Amen.
[1:36:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. But I'm talking
[1:36:14] about people that want to go to heaven.
[1:36:17] People that want to live right and want
[1:36:18] to make it out of here, you're going to
[1:36:20] have to come God's way. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:23] That's bottom line, church. Amen. Now
[1:36:25] let please listen and let me let me try
[1:36:27] to get to this. It says the
[1:36:32] trumpets is to call them back to that
[1:36:35] atonement. See the atonement they
[1:36:37] rejected and they rejected so our eyes
[1:36:40] could be
[1:36:41] open. Theirs was closed. He's talking
[1:36:44] about the Jews now. Their eyes were
[1:36:45] closed so that we could receive truth.
[1:36:48] And this is where we are. We're we're in
[1:36:50] a day where we're receiving the truth.
[1:36:52] All right. It says now it says and
[1:36:54] during this time and during this time
[1:36:56] the seven seals open
[1:36:59] up and the trumpets
[1:37:02] blowed. And now in the blowing of the
[1:37:04] trumpets just before the Messiah
[1:37:07] comes cuz they got to be in Palestine.
[1:37:11] What?
[1:37:12] Hello.
[1:37:14] They got to be in Palestine.
[1:37:19] Look, it's not going to be the rapture
[1:37:22] going to happen and then some big thing
[1:37:23] going to bring them to Palestine. No,
[1:37:25] they've already been moving to
[1:37:27] Palestine.
[1:37:28] Even in brother Brandham's day, he said
[1:37:31] he said that the he said he read an
[1:37:33] article where the Jews said that they
[1:37:35] prophets told him they was going to go
[1:37:36] back home on the wings of an eagle. And
[1:37:38] when they got on an airplane,
[1:37:41] that was the fulfillment of their
[1:37:43] prophecy. They've already been moving
[1:37:45] back to Palestine. Why are they in
[1:37:48] Palestine? Because God cannot deal with
[1:37:50] the Jews outside of being there in
[1:37:53] Palestine. Amen. So he had to already
[1:37:56] start moving them back. How did he do
[1:37:59] it?
[1:38:01] Through Ikeman,
[1:38:02] through Stalin, through Hitler. And
[1:38:05] these things were happening while God
[1:38:07] was also speaking through a prophet to
[1:38:10] the Gentiles.
[1:38:12] Things happening simultaneously
[1:38:14] at the same time. And we got our charts
[1:38:17] and our charts. So these things ain't
[1:38:19] going to happen till after the rapture.
[1:38:20] But brother Brandham said these things
[1:38:22] have already been happening. That's
[1:38:24] right. So when brother Brandham's quotes
[1:38:27] go against your chart,
[1:38:30] right?
[1:38:32] Which one do we go with? I know which
[1:38:35] one I'm going with. Right. I ain't going
[1:38:38] nobody chart. I'm going with what the
[1:38:40] prophet said. Amen. A vindicated
[1:38:44] prophet. That's it. That's the truth.
[1:38:47] Hallelujah. Let me keep on. They got to
[1:38:50] be in Palestine.
[1:38:54] And you remember God had to harden
[1:38:55] Pharaoh's heart to run them out of
[1:38:57] Egypt.
[1:38:59] Look at this.
[1:39:00] and he
[1:39:02] hardened past tense
[1:39:05] Stalin Mussolini and all that to get
[1:39:10] them back into the promised land where
[1:39:13] the 144,000 is supposed to be.
[1:39:20] Yes, sir. All right. Now, first time for
[1:39:24] a thousand years, 2500 years that Israel
[1:39:27] is a nation with his own flag, own army
[1:39:30] and all that. It it considered it in the
[1:39:32] UN first time the the oldest flag that
[1:39:35] ever flew on the earth this time flies
[1:39:37] again. Five six point star David. He
[1:39:40] said uh he uh lift the end sign in uh in
[1:39:43] this last days and and when she come
[1:39:46] when she'd be coming back, we're at the
[1:39:47] end. There's just no doubt about it.
[1:39:50] We're here. Now he goes on. Let me just
[1:39:52] finish reading these the just these two
[1:39:54] more paragraphs here then I'll slip into
[1:39:56] a
[1:39:57] scripture. And now he says now notice
[1:39:59] now re quickly Revelation 9 under the
[1:40:02] seventh trumpet their king is from the
[1:40:03] bottomless pit. Now brother Brandham
[1:40:06] when he refers to Revelation 9 this is a
[1:40:10] portion of the trumpets. All right?
[1:40:13] Because Revelation 9 um uh speaks of um
[1:40:17] uh I can't remember which trumpets. I
[1:40:19] know fifth and sixth trumpet are found
[1:40:20] in that Revelation 9. All right. Now,
[1:40:23] there's a couple statements that I want
[1:40:24] to make about the trumpets when when
[1:40:26] brother Bam when he's referring to
[1:40:28] Revelation 9. First of all, he says that
[1:40:31] all the trumpets sound underneath the
[1:40:33] sixth seal. Another statement that he
[1:40:36] makes is that uh all the trumpets go off
[1:40:39] at once.
[1:40:41] It's another statement that he makes.
[1:40:42] Now, here's the problem. Here's the
[1:40:43] thing. When he says that all of them go
[1:40:45] off at once, what people are looking at,
[1:40:47] they're looking for one to sound and
[1:40:49] then another one to sound and they're
[1:40:51] trying to track it with history to see
[1:40:53] where it might have sounded. Brother
[1:40:54] Brandham say it all went off at once.
[1:40:57] And when it goes off at once, you ain't
[1:40:58] going to be able to really track too
[1:41:00] much. But but but here's the other
[1:41:02] beautiful thing that he says. The sixth
[1:41:05] trumpet. The sixth trumpet. It says it
[1:41:08] sounded already underneath Hitler
[1:41:13] Stalin. Ikeman already
[1:41:16] sounded. This is past tense. This is
[1:41:19] things that the kids are learning in in
[1:41:20] school. Hitler Ikeman Stalin is already
[1:41:23] it was an attack on the Jews. Yes, sir.
[1:41:26] And it was a purposeful attack because
[1:41:28] it drove the Jews back into their
[1:41:31] homeland. And that's the only place that
[1:41:34] they can receive their two witnesses.
[1:41:36] They have to already be there. Not going
[1:41:40] there. They have to be there.
[1:41:43] Oh my. All right. Look at this now.
[1:41:46] Says, "Now notice quickly Revelation 9
[1:41:48] under the trumpet their king is from the
[1:41:50] bottomless pits. Then in Leviticus, now
[1:41:53] how perfect interpretation is here with
[1:41:55] the word because see immediately
[1:41:57] following the Pentecostal Jubilee.
[1:41:59] Immediately following the Pentecostal
[1:42:00] Jubilee followed the day of atonement.
[1:42:03] It says the order of the feast time
[1:42:06] between the Pentecostal feast to the
[1:42:08] atonement the sound of the trumpets for
[1:42:09] the atonement was the Pentecostal feast
[1:42:12] the long period of time. Look there was
[1:42:14] a long period of time between the
[1:42:15] Pentecostal feast to the calling of the
[1:42:17] trump. Now there's a long period of
[1:42:19] time. That means all these church ages
[1:42:20] have passed. That's it's seven church
[1:42:23] ages. That's the long period of time
[1:42:25] that has passed before the Jews are
[1:42:27] called back. Now, the Jews won't be
[1:42:28] called, I mean, fully called back until
[1:42:31] the bride is taken out. God has already
[1:42:34] been preparing them, but they're not
[1:42:36] fully they don't fully got it all
[1:42:38] together. But when a bride is taken,
[1:42:40] they will they will receive two
[1:42:41] witnesses and they'll have it all
[1:42:43] together at that point in time. Three
[1:42:44] and a half year ministry, that's all
[1:42:45] that's left. We got to get ready to get
[1:42:48] out of here. We are the ones holding
[1:42:50] this up.
[1:42:53] It's the truth. Let me just go on now.
[1:42:55] I'm I'm I'm I'm giving you uh these
[1:42:58] these highlevel terms, but it's very
[1:43:00] important because it's all in the
[1:43:01] scripture. We're going to read Leviticus
[1:43:03] in a second. Let me just try to get get
[1:43:06] this. It
[1:43:07] says a long period of time. Look, there
[1:43:09] was a long period of time between the
[1:43:10] Pentecostal feast to the calling of the
[1:43:13] trump, the sounding of the
[1:43:15] trumpets, the trumpets to be sound. A
[1:43:19] long period of time. Frankly, it was 50
[1:43:21] days. From the feast of Pentecost to the
[1:43:23] feast of atonement was 50 days. Now, 50
[1:43:25] days is exactly seven Sabbaths. Now, he
[1:43:27] says there's a long periods of time
[1:43:29] before that that sounding of the
[1:43:30] trumpet. Now, let me just
[1:43:33] inject another trump that's supposed to
[1:43:37] sound. Jesus tells us in Thessalonians
[1:43:41] 4, the Lord
[1:43:43] himself will descend from heaven with a
[1:43:46] shout. That's right. a voice and the
[1:43:50] trump of God. Now, I want you to
[1:43:52] understand something. I got a quote to
[1:43:54] prove it, but just in case I don't get a
[1:43:56] chance to get there. The shout, see,
[1:43:58] this is that that that shout, that voice
[1:44:00] of Trump is actually three parts of the
[1:44:02] rapture. Yes, sir. H and you realize we
[1:44:08] are currently living in the rapture now.
[1:44:11] Yes, sir. Because the shout is the
[1:44:14] message that I'm quoting to you, the
[1:44:17] message that I'm reading to you. That is
[1:44:19] the shout that's going forth. And Jesus
[1:44:21] himself is the one that sent this
[1:44:22] message. Brother Brandham was a star in
[1:44:25] the hand of Jesus. So Jesus sent this
[1:44:29] message to his people to get them ready
[1:44:31] for a translation. This this what I am
[1:44:36] sharing with you is shout.
[1:44:41] Amen.
[1:44:43] Hallelujah. There's a voice that calls
[1:44:46] the dead out of the
[1:44:48] grave, right? And and those that died in
[1:44:51] Christ, there's the same voice that
[1:44:53] called Lazarus out of the grace calls
[1:44:55] them out of the grave. Now remember,
[1:44:56] brother Brandham told us because the
[1:44:59] power and the anointing that was on
[1:45:00] Jesus, had he not called Lazarus by
[1:45:05] name, then everything would have come
[1:45:08] out the grave. And let me tell you
[1:45:10] something. When when when when when when
[1:45:12] when when when when the dead in Christ
[1:45:14] arrived, it's only the dead in Christ.
[1:45:17] That's right. Everything else ain't
[1:45:19] going to rise. Only the dead in Christ.
[1:45:22] The same way Lazarus came individually,
[1:45:24] the dead in Christ will come
[1:45:25] individually.
[1:45:28] But there's a third part to this.
[1:45:30] There's a trump.
[1:45:32] Now the beautiful part about
[1:45:35] this if we can catch how
[1:45:38] God is working with the Jews and with
[1:45:41] the Gentiles at the same time
[1:45:42] simultaneously he's preparing the Jews
[1:45:44] by moving them back through Hitlin
[1:45:46] Hitler Stalin and even the war today
[1:45:48] moving them back moving them back moving
[1:45:50] they get uncomfortable where they are
[1:45:51] and they go back to where where they
[1:45:53] come from. Oh, hallelujah. God is moving
[1:45:57] that. God is doing that. Now, that trump
[1:46:01] in the shout voice trump, Brother
[1:46:03] Brandham said that's a call to the
[1:46:05] feast.
[1:46:06] Wow. Well, which feast?
[1:46:11] The Jews are called to the feast of the
[1:46:13] trumpets. We're going to read in a
[1:46:15] second. But the
[1:46:17] bride is called to the feast of the
[1:46:21] lamb. Amen.
[1:46:24] The trump that calls the Jews to their
[1:46:27] feast of atonement is the same trump
[1:46:29] that's calling us out. It is happening
[1:46:32] simultaneously.
[1:46:33] Amen.
[1:46:35] Amen. Y'all just let me get it out of my
[1:46:38] spirit.
[1:46:41] Amen.
[1:46:47] Jesus.
[1:46:49] All right. Let me let me let me let me
[1:46:51] let me let me let me read let me keep
[1:46:53] reading. All right. Where what
[1:46:55] paragraph? All right. In seven
[1:47:00] Sabbaths in the seven church years
[1:47:03] church
[1:47:04] ages. Get get it. See now the Jews has
[1:47:09] been blinded waiting all this time while
[1:47:11] the Pentecostal first fruits has been
[1:47:14] poured out upon the church. And we've
[1:47:17] come down through the martyr ages and
[1:47:20] down through the reformer ages and now
[1:47:22] now in the calling out age three three
[1:47:26] sections same spirit like father son and
[1:47:28] the holy ghost same one but uh see but
[1:47:31] seven church ages being seven sabbaths
[1:47:34] exactly seven sabbaths from the
[1:47:35] pentecostal jubilee trumpet a
[1:47:37] pentecostal jubilee feast the waving of
[1:47:40] the sheath and then the pentecostal
[1:47:42] jubilee and then from the jubilee to the
[1:47:45] atonement is seven sabbaths 50 days and
[1:47:47] at the end of the 50 days uh is the
[1:47:49] atonement. The atonement is made. You
[1:47:51] get it now and now and this has been a
[1:47:55] type uh that the church now brother
[1:47:57] Random just to inject here is referring
[1:48:00] back to Leviticus
[1:48:02] 25. Okay, I'm sorry. Leviticus 23 uh at
[1:48:06] this junction. Now
[1:48:09] um I could take the time and read this
[1:48:13] for you.
[1:48:15] Leviticus 23. There there's so much
[1:48:17] there, but let me just I'll try to give
[1:48:19] you the the the summary points. You can
[1:48:21] go back and read it yourself. All right.
[1:48:24] First, there are seven feasts that we
[1:48:27] have, and we've talked about this uh
[1:48:29] before. The first feast is actually the
[1:48:32] feast of Passover.
[1:48:34] And that you'll find that Leviticus 25
[1:48:36] 23 and 5. The feast of Passover. All
[1:48:40] right. And then the next feast that God
[1:48:43] gave them in Leviticus 23 was the feast
[1:48:45] of unleavened bread. And uh and that
[1:48:48] would happen during the March to April
[1:48:50] time frame. Uh you find that in
[1:48:52] Leviticus 23:6. Now just a few key
[1:48:55] points about that feast of unleavened
[1:48:58] bread. The feast of unleaven bread. This
[1:49:02] feast actually began on the evening of
[1:49:05] Passover and lasted for seven days.
[1:49:08] Okay? And uh and notice now it's the
[1:49:11] feast of unleavened bread and leavenan
[1:49:15] is a type of sin. Hallelujah. Right? And
[1:49:19] that's why we got to keep sin out of the
[1:49:21] church because a little levan leaventh
[1:49:23] the whole lump. Praise God. And so so
[1:49:27] when it's the feast of unleavened bread,
[1:49:29] it's actually typing Christ. And it was
[1:49:32] offered during Passover time. Do you
[1:49:34] know Jesus was offered during Passover
[1:49:36] time? That's right. It was a It was a
[1:49:39] Passover. At the time that Jesus was
[1:49:41] being offered, he was the Passover.
[1:49:44] He was the lamb that was slain for for
[1:49:47] for the for the for for the sins of the
[1:49:48] world. Jesus Christ was that lamb. So,
[1:49:51] he was offered at Passover time.
[1:49:53] Hallelujah. That's why they say between
[1:49:55] March and April, we we got it. Brother
[1:49:57] Brandham told us Jesus was born in the
[1:49:59] springtime.
[1:50:01] And you know what else? He died in the
[1:50:03] springtime. And you know what else?
[1:50:07] He rose in the springtime
[1:50:11] because that's when life comes forth.
[1:50:14] Amen.
[1:50:15] Notice Jesus Jesus is the only one that
[1:50:19] is unleavened. Amen. And uh uh we we we
[1:50:22] were born in sin, shaped iniquity, came
[1:50:24] into the world speaking lies. We got all
[1:50:26] kind of leaven inside of us. Hallelujah.
[1:50:28] We can't help ourselves sometime. But
[1:50:30] but but Jesus was the one that was uh
[1:50:33] considered the un he was he was he he's
[1:50:35] he's the unleavened bread. That's that's
[1:50:38] what it is. Now uh just a couple
[1:50:39] scriptures just to kind of uh prove
[1:50:41] this. Uh 1 Peter chapter 2
[1:50:44] 24-2. I love this. 1 Peter chapter 2
[1:50:47] 24-2.
[1:50:49] Oh Lord says who his own self bear our
[1:50:52] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[1:50:56] being dead to sin should live unto
[1:50:58] unrighteous by whose stripes ye were
[1:51:00] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[1:51:03] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[1:51:06] and bishop of your souls. Another verse
[1:51:08] here in Colossians chapter 2 verse 13
[1:51:10] and 14. Uh it says this. And
[1:51:14] you being dead in your sins. You got all
[1:51:17] kind of lev in you, right? You being
[1:51:19] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[1:51:21] of your flesh hath he quickened together
[1:51:25] with him having forgiven you all
[1:51:27] trespasses. That mean you done had a
[1:51:29] jubilee.
[1:51:31] Oh my. having forgiven you all
[1:51:33] trespasses, blotting out the handwriting
[1:51:36] of ordinances that was against us which
[1:51:38] was contrary to us and took it took it
[1:51:41] out of the way nailing it to his cross.
[1:51:46] Thank God for this jubilee. Now so we
[1:51:49] have the first two feast of Passover
[1:51:51] then we have the feast of unleaven
[1:51:53] bread. The next feast, Amen. the third
[1:51:56] one is uh what we call the feast of
[1:51:58] first fruits which typically happens in
[1:52:01] April. We find that in Leviticus
[1:52:04] 23:10-14. And one of the things that was
[1:52:06] supposed to happen with the the feast of
[1:52:07] first fruits is that the first thing
[1:52:09] that came to maturity in in your wheat
[1:52:12] field, you would bring that and wave a
[1:52:14] sheath before the Lord on the day after
[1:52:16] the Sabbath. The sheath was waved on the
[1:52:20] day after the Sabbath. The feast of
[1:52:23] first fruits required a sheath to be
[1:52:25] waved on the day after the Sabbath. Do
[1:52:27] you realize Jesus rose on the day after
[1:52:32] the Sabbath? That's right. Amen. Right.
[1:52:35] He truly is this first fruit. Oh my my
[1:52:38] my my my my. But when when you're waving
[1:52:41] that first fruit, it shows that there's
[1:52:44] other fruit that are going to come to
[1:52:46] maturity.
[1:52:47] Amen. There's going to be some other
[1:52:49] ones that's going to raise as well, just
[1:52:51] as Jesus rose. Yes, sir. Woo.
[1:52:56] Hallelujah. Now, here's the other thing
[1:52:58] that we get after the feast of first
[1:52:59] fruits. After the feast of first fruits,
[1:53:02] the next feast, you have to actually
[1:53:04] count seven Sabbaths before the next
[1:53:06] feast would actually start. And this
[1:53:09] would be called the feast of weeks or
[1:53:11] the feast of Pentecost, which is where
[1:53:13] brother Brandham has placed us. Amen.
[1:53:16] And uh this you'll find in Leviticus
[1:53:18] 23:15-22.
[1:53:21] uh it occurred seven chapters seven
[1:53:23] Sabbaths after the first after uh the
[1:53:26] feast of first fruit. So now if it
[1:53:27] occurs seven Sabbaths after then that
[1:53:30] means that's also a jubilee.
[1:53:33] All right. And what happens in the
[1:53:35] jubilee in this feast of weeks or feast
[1:53:37] of Pentecost then we take two loaves. It
[1:53:41] goes from a sheath to now it's two
[1:53:43] loaves but they're baked with leaven
[1:53:45] which represents us.
[1:53:48] Let me go a little further with getting
[1:53:50] to the feast of the trumpets. This is
[1:53:52] what comes after the feast of uh
[1:53:54] Pentecost, the feast of trumpets. This
[1:53:56] is where Israel is called back. Amen.
[1:54:00] And what calls them back is they're
[1:54:02] getting prepared for the atonement where
[1:54:05] they recognize who Jesus is.
[1:54:09] Amen. This is found Leviticus 23 verse
[1:54:13] 23-2. And then the f the line the next
[1:54:16] one is the day of atonement which is
[1:54:17] found in Leviticus 23:26 through32. And
[1:54:20] then the feast of tabernacles is found
[1:54:23] in that's the seventh feast. Leviticus
[1:54:26] 23:34-44. Now I'm going forward in this
[1:54:30] uh sermon the the the feast of trumpets.
[1:54:32] Brother Brandham makes a couple more
[1:54:33] statements. I just want to bring this
[1:54:34] in. Amen. And as he's talking about this
[1:54:38] glory, he says he when he was revealed
[1:54:41] himself as son of God has been revealing
[1:54:43] to the church in the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:45] Ghost down through the ages, the
[1:54:48] Pentecostal age. See, just keep getting
[1:54:50] more and more justification on the
[1:54:52] Luther sanctification on the Wesley,
[1:54:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, here is
[1:54:56] the calling out time at the sixth seal
[1:55:00] when it's open. The persecution struck
[1:55:02] the Jews at the sixth seal when it's
[1:55:05] open.
[1:55:06] at the sixth seal when it's open. Now,
[1:55:10] there's some people waiting for the
[1:55:12] sixth seal to open. But the prophet just
[1:55:15] told us at the six. Remember I told you
[1:55:18] he says this in feast of the trumpets
[1:55:20] which comes after the seals. This is
[1:55:23] light upon light.
[1:55:27] The sixth seal when it's opened, the
[1:55:31] persecution struck. Now wait, wait,
[1:55:33] wait, wait. Not the persecution will
[1:55:36] strike. No, past tense. The
[1:55:40] persecution struck the Jews. All right.
[1:55:44] In the literal standpoint, and here
[1:55:46] comes the persecution to the church in
[1:55:48] the ecclesiastical standpoint because
[1:55:50] the bride is already called. The
[1:55:53] persecution struck the Jews, but there's
[1:55:56] going to be a persecution that's going
[1:55:57] to strike the church. That's where uh
[1:56:00] the foolish virgin will be purged during
[1:56:03] that sixth seal. Oh, Lord have mercy. I
[1:56:07] I I I I I I I feel it,
[1:56:10] church. I feel it. But you know what I
[1:56:13] told y'all? I have a responsibility. I
[1:56:16] have to tear up this ground. I got to
[1:56:20] sew some seed.
[1:56:22] Hallelujah. And you know when you
[1:56:23] tearing up ground and sewing seed,
[1:56:26] it ain't a fun process.
[1:56:30] It ain't a fun process. But we got to
[1:56:32] get rocks out. We got to get dirt out.
[1:56:36] We got to get false teaching out.
[1:56:39] Amen. We got to get all that out in
[1:56:43] order to get the right seed planted in
[1:56:45] the ground for the people. Right. Amen.
[1:56:46] Amen.
[1:56:48] And and and if it don't make sense when
[1:56:49] you go back and listen to Feast of the
[1:56:51] Trumpets and then you put this sermon
[1:56:53] with Feast of the Trumpets and then you
[1:56:55] go back and listen to the seals, all of
[1:56:57] it will start coming together. It'll be
[1:56:59] illumination after illumination after
[1:57:01] illumination. Praise God. All right, I'm
[1:57:05] I give me 20 minutes. That's what my
[1:57:08] timer will say, right? 20 minutes and I
[1:57:10] and I'll be out of here. Okay. And so,
[1:57:12] so he says, "Now, here is a calling out
[1:57:15] time at the sixth seal when it opened.
[1:57:19] The persecution struck the Jews in the
[1:57:22] literal standpoint. And here comes the
[1:57:25] persecution to the church in
[1:57:26] ecclesiastical standpoint because the
[1:57:29] bride is already
[1:57:30] called. The Sabbaths are over and ready
[1:57:34] for the Jews to be called." Where to?
[1:57:36] Where are the Jews going to be called?
[1:57:38] To the feast of atonement.
[1:57:42] He says, "Oh church, don't you see it?
[1:57:44] Called to the feast of atonement." Why?
[1:57:46] To recognize the atonement. Not no more
[1:57:48] chickens and geese and what and what
[1:57:51] they've been doing. The lamb of God
[1:57:52] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:57:54] Israel is going to know that. Now, now,
[1:57:58] um allow me just to read one out of
[1:58:01] Leviticus 23. This is where he's
[1:58:02] referring to uh first is the feast of
[1:58:05] trumpets that actually leads them to the
[1:58:07] day of atonement. So let's let's read uh
[1:58:09] Leviticus
[1:58:11] 23:23-2. This is what he's referring to.
[1:58:15] Okay. Glory to God. It says, "And the
[1:58:19] Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak
[1:58:22] unto the children of Israel, saying, in
[1:58:24] the seventh month, in the first day of
[1:58:27] the month, shall you have a Sabbath, a
[1:58:30] memorial of blowing of trumpets." Of
[1:58:33] blowing of trumpets. So remember in the
[1:58:36] in the Jubilee year when a trumpet is
[1:58:38] blown, it actually signifies that
[1:58:40] there's freedom coming to those that's
[1:58:42] been in bondage. Oh my. When this
[1:58:45] blowing of trumpets happens for the
[1:58:48] Jews, they have been blinded for our
[1:58:51] sake for all these years. But a jubilee
[1:58:54] is about to happen. Amen. For the Jews
[1:58:58] where they're going to recognize who
[1:59:00] Christ is. Amen. I'm going to tell you
[1:59:03] nothing another. I'm going to tell you
[1:59:04] something else that they going to
[1:59:07] recognize. Moses and Elijah will preach
[1:59:11] the same message that you've been
[1:59:13] hearing. Amen.
[1:59:16] Amen.
[1:59:22] The same message that we refuse to
[1:59:24] listen to, the Jews are going to hear
[1:59:26] it. You you know, look, they they they
[1:59:28] they actually wanted to hear it years
[1:59:31] ago. They were they were trying to get
[1:59:33] brother Brandham take this take this
[1:59:35] into Israel. they will believe. And
[1:59:37] brother Random had a ticket on his way
[1:59:40] to Israel. And before he got on the
[1:59:43] plane, the Holy Spirit had said,
[1:59:45] "No, pull them to the side." He said,
[1:59:47] "No." Said, "No, don't go there. Don't
[1:59:49] go to Israel." What you mean, Lord?
[1:59:52] Lord, they they they ready to receive
[1:59:53] the word. Said, "It's not time for them
[1:59:56] yet to receive the word. And really,
[1:59:59] that ain't your job.
[2:00:02] So, you need to get a ticket and go
[2:00:03] somewhere else." Brother Brandham could
[2:00:05] not break God's word
[2:00:08] as a prophet. Had he gone there to
[2:00:12] Israel, I don't know what would have
[2:00:14] happened,
[2:00:16] it would have just disrupted everything.
[2:00:19] But God had to block his prophet from
[2:00:21] going to Israel. They were ready to
[2:00:23] receive it way back then.
[2:00:26] All right. You know, the the Jews have a
[2:00:30] I think I I can't remember which holiday
[2:00:32] it is, but whatever the holiday is that
[2:00:34] they celebrate, they leave an empty
[2:00:36] chair at their table
[2:00:40] uh while they're while they're preparing
[2:00:41] their meal, they leave an empty chair at
[2:00:43] the table, and the chair stays empty.
[2:00:45] Every every Jewish person that's that's
[2:00:48] celebrating holiday holiday, they leave
[2:00:50] the empty chair and the chair is there
[2:00:52] for Elijah to come and join them in a
[2:00:54] meal. The Jews are actually looking for
[2:00:57] Elijah. And guess what? They're gonna
[2:01:00] get Moses and Elijah.
[2:01:04] Amen.
[2:01:06] All right. Here, uh, verse I want to
[2:01:09] just take this. I got What verse did I
[2:01:11] stop at?
[2:01:13] 24. Okay. Speaking to the children of
[2:01:15] Israel, saying, "In the seventh month,
[2:01:17] in the first day of the month, shall you
[2:01:19] have a Sabbath, a memorial, a blowing of
[2:01:21] trumpets, and a holy convocation. Ye
[2:01:24] should do no silver silver our work
[2:01:26] therein. But you should offer an
[2:01:28] offering made by fire unto the Lord. So
[2:01:30] after um this uh the feast of Pentecost,
[2:01:35] then the feast or the the the the feast
[2:01:38] of trumpets is next. And the feast of
[2:01:41] trumpets is a calling of Israel to bring
[2:01:43] them back to their homeland so that they
[2:01:47] could actually get ready for the
[2:01:49] atonement.
[2:01:51] Now
[2:01:52] look, so I can just try to come out of
[2:01:56] this that feast of atonement that
[2:01:59] calling them back into their
[2:02:01] homeland. It's already been
[2:02:04] happening. It's already been
[2:02:10] happening. I'm going to read again from
[2:02:13] the feast of the trumpets. I I
[2:02:16] think I
[2:02:19] might have this.
[2:02:22] Um I don't think I've given you this
[2:02:24] one. So, if you could just type this in.
[2:02:28] Remember, all
[2:02:30] trumpets sound on the sixth seal. That
[2:02:35] should be paragraph 246 in Feast of the
[2:02:38] Trumpets. I'm at 14
[2:02:42] minutes, y'all. Just bear with
[2:02:44] me. All right. So, this paragraph 246, I
[2:02:49] believe, is where I'm at. And it
[2:02:51] this Pentecost feast finishes at the
[2:02:56] period of the seventh
[2:02:58] trumpet. It says, "For the next is the
[2:03:01] coming, the seventh
[2:03:03] seal. For the next is the mystery of the
[2:03:05] coming of
[2:03:06] Christ." It says, "And also the trumpet
[2:03:10] is sound for the Jews." Now he say
[2:03:13] also the trumpet is sound for the Jews.
[2:03:17] Their sixth trumpet is sound and when it
[2:03:20] does it make no known to them the
[2:03:23] revealed son of
[2:03:25] God 1/ half hour of
[2:03:27] space. Remember all trumpets sound on
[2:03:32] the sixth seal. The sixth seal finishes
[2:03:35] the mystery under the sixth seal just
[2:03:37] before the seventh seal is open. Let's
[2:03:39] go on. It says, "Now notice, notice here
[2:03:43] in Leviticus
[2:03:44] 23:26, it says, "How in order is the
[2:03:47] scripture after the long period of
[2:03:48] Pentecost, we just read it. After the
[2:03:50] long period of Pentecost, which Israel
[2:03:52] did reject back back there, and he
[2:03:55] called the Gentile church out through
[2:03:58] this Pentecostal feast, that's where we
[2:04:00] were called out. That's where we are
[2:04:01] right now." How many understand what the
[2:04:03] Pentecostal feast is? He says, "First
[2:04:05] fruits of the harvest, the first fruits
[2:04:06] of the resurrection, the Pentecostal
[2:04:08] feast." Don't miss this people. So if
[2:04:11] the prophets say don't miss this, it's
[2:04:13] important for me to share this. Don't
[2:04:16] miss this people. And you on tape listen
[2:04:20] close.
[2:04:23] This this
[2:04:24] this has been the time of the
[2:04:27] Pentecostal feast. The Jews has laid
[2:04:31] silent. They rejected it. Now they're
[2:04:35] now they're going to be called back to
[2:04:38] the atonement. So it's getting ready to
[2:04:40] turn to the Jews. And before it turns to
[2:04:42] the Jews, we Gentiles got to get out of
[2:04:43] the way in form of the rapture. You want
[2:04:46] to make sure your life is lined up. Says
[2:04:48] we know who the atonement was. They
[2:04:52] didn't. It says, "And the trumpet sound
[2:04:55] and the Pentecostal Jubilee calls the
[2:04:57] Jews together." Can't you see how that
[2:04:59] trumpet of of of Can't you see how that
[2:05:03] trumpet of
[2:05:05] persecution under Hitler and them
[2:05:09] blasted? Brother Brandham say the
[2:05:11] trumpet blasted when under
[2:05:15] Hitler. So is this a future thing we
[2:05:17] waiting on or or did a prophet tell us
[2:05:21] something else?
[2:05:23] No. Can I tell you something? The
[2:05:25] mystery is history.
[2:05:30] Amen. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:05:34] Can't you see?
[2:05:36] Yes, sir. How that trumpet of
[2:05:39] persecution under Hitling them blasted
[2:05:42] and remember I'm reading from feast of
[2:05:44] the trumpets which comes after the
[2:05:45] church ages I mean after the seals light
[2:05:48] upon light following.
[2:05:51] This is where we are. Light upon light.
[2:05:53] and and everybody built their charts on
[2:05:55] the seals and they stopped there and
[2:05:57] stopped going for life. That's why you
[2:05:59] can't put periods on anything.
[2:06:02] The prophet told us this. He said, "Put
[2:06:04] a come on everything." Look at this. It
[2:06:08] says, "Can't you see how that trumpet of
[2:06:11] persecution under Hitler and them
[2:06:12] blasted and the Jews was forced to come
[2:06:14] together to fulfill the
[2:06:18] scriptures?" Now you got it. And watch
[2:06:20] this. He say, "All that got it, say,
[2:06:22] "Amen." Amen. And some of y'all ain't
[2:06:25] even say nothing. The prophet said, "All
[2:06:28] that got it, say amen." And you know
[2:06:30] what you what you know what your amen is
[2:06:32] saying? Lord, if I don't got it, you're
[2:06:33] going to bring it to me.
[2:06:36] That's right. I agree anyway.
[2:06:40] Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,
[2:06:42] Lord. And and don't don't get me wrong.
[2:06:44] I'm not trying to do something to, you
[2:06:46] know, just,
[2:06:47] you know, try to be all above your mind
[2:06:50] and above your head. I'm not doing that.
[2:06:52] These are these are some of the deeper
[2:06:53] things in the message, but they have to
[2:06:55] be spoken on. No, this is more than just
[2:06:58] you getting a blessing. This is you
[2:07:01] understanding your your your your
[2:07:02] spiritual place. Yes, sir. Somebody else
[2:07:05] start and and when you go read
[2:07:06] Leviticus, you can see what this is all
[2:07:08] talking about. Brother Brandon went back
[2:07:09] to it. It's very critical. Yes, sir.
[2:07:12] Critical. Listen, it says now you got it
[2:07:14] all. All this got to say, amen.
[2:07:16] Congregation says, "Amen." Good. All
[2:07:18] right. Now he says
[2:07:20] this, they say, "Oh my, did we actually
[2:07:23] miss seeing
[2:07:25] him?" Was that the atonement and we
[2:07:27] missed it, oh God? And they said they
[2:07:29] just separate themselves and mourn for
[2:07:31] days. That's what the feast of atonement
[2:07:33] is all about is when they separate. And
[2:07:35] this is where the full tribulation
[2:07:37] period and but but underneath that
[2:07:38] tribulation period, the Jews are being
[2:07:39] called back into fellowship with Christ.
[2:07:42] The church has rejected the word. So the
[2:07:45] the church is going through tribulation
[2:07:46] but the bride is already in a rapture.
[2:07:49] Yes sir. All right. Watch it now. It
[2:07:51] says they just separate themselves and
[2:07:53] mourn for days. What is it? The
[2:07:54] atonement sadness. This time the coming
[2:07:57] of the of the making known atonement is
[2:08:00] not the regular atonement being killed
[2:08:02] like in Leviticus 16. But Leviticus 23
[2:08:04] and is a morning time of their sins and
[2:08:07] their sins they rejected it. Now he goes
[2:08:09] on. He says, "Oh, don't you see where
[2:08:10] we're at? Don't you see why them
[2:08:13] trumpets mean why them trumpets mean
[2:08:15] nothing to us? This is a critical point.
[2:08:18] Another statement because when people
[2:08:20] read the trumpets in the Bible, they are
[2:08:23] looking for those trumpets especially I
[2:08:26] want to say the fifth trumpet there's
[2:08:27] like this this great interruption that
[2:08:29] happens and earth something this great
[2:08:32] thing that happened to the earth and
[2:08:33] everybody looking for that to happen for
[2:08:35] the
[2:08:36] Gentiles. No, the trumpets don't mean
[2:08:39] nothing to the Gentiles.
[2:08:41] Amen. You can't look in Gentile history
[2:08:43] for that. You have to look in Jewish
[2:08:46] history.
[2:08:48] And I'm I'mma give you another thing. If
[2:08:50] Brother Brandham didn't really bring out
[2:08:52] nothing about that happening, it don't
[2:08:54] pertain to us. And there's no need to go
[2:08:57] looking at that. But what he did bring
[2:08:59] was that that sixth trumpet
[2:09:02] sounded at the same time that the six
[2:09:04] seal happened. That's what he did bring
[2:09:07] us. We got that much. And if the sixth
[2:09:09] trumpet done sounded, it's very clear to
[2:09:12] me that the other five before that also
[2:09:16] sounded
[2:09:18] where he didn't tell us. But he did tell
[2:09:20] me where the sixth one was. I got that
[2:09:22] much. That's all I need. Amen.
[2:09:26] All right.
[2:09:31] Here. Don't you see why them trumpets
[2:09:33] mean nothing to us? They all sounded
[2:09:35] under our sixth seal. You see now why
[2:09:38] the Holy Spirit wouldn't let me speak
[2:09:40] it. And the Heavenly Father knows with a
[2:09:43] with his Bible before me. That's the
[2:09:44] truth. Didn't know till didn't know
[2:09:47] didn't know it till yesterday. Wait a
[2:09:48] minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[2:09:49] Wait a minute. Wait. You ain't You ain't
[2:09:50] find this out till yesterday.
[2:09:53] Light upon light.
[2:10:00] Didn't know it until yesterday. Day
[2:10:02] before yesterday in my room there where
[2:10:05] he revealed it. come to me and spoke to
[2:10:07] me. Now, now wait a minute. Wait a
[2:10:08] minute. Wait a
[2:10:10] minute. Didn't an angel come to him to
[2:10:12] speak to him the seals?
[2:10:14] Well, here's an angel also speaking to
[2:10:16] him about the feast of the
[2:10:18] trumpets. Same angel, but the angel can
[2:10:21] only give you so much at one time. Like,
[2:10:23] like today, I can only feed you so much
[2:10:25] now. But you know what? We're going to
[2:10:26] have a nice little foundation here.
[2:10:28] Amen. So, so whether I come or some
[2:10:31] other preacher come in here and preach
[2:10:32] it, you'll be like, "Amen. Amen." Now,
[2:10:34] I'mma be sitting there like, "Now, Lord,
[2:10:36] they ain't say amen to me like that."
[2:10:40] But, it's because we had to plant the
[2:10:42] seeds. Somebody else going to come in
[2:10:44] here and get some water. Amen. Glory to
[2:10:47] God. Hallelujah. We all going to
[2:10:49] rejoice, though. Amen. All right. All
[2:10:52] right. Let me keep going. Let me keep
[2:10:54] going. All right.
[2:10:56] Amen. Amen. He says, I I come back. I
[2:11:00] said, wife, I got it now. He just met me
[2:11:02] in there and told me, "Here it is,
[2:11:04] honey. See, see, there it is. See,
[2:11:06] perfectly just in harmony." Oh, people
[2:11:08] without him, get in quick. It might be
[2:11:10] the last opportunity you'll ever be able
[2:11:11] to have. You don't know what uh time he
[2:11:14] might come. The feast of the trumpets,
[2:11:16] the Bible says they would separate
[2:11:17] themselves for for uh one for another
[2:11:20] and pray and weep because like a person
[2:11:21] with their only child uh being lost. It
[2:11:24] says, "Lord, I'm says, look, I want to
[2:11:27] say one more thing." Oh, Lord, this is
[2:11:28] good. Now, now when the prophet say, I
[2:11:31] want to say one more thing.
[2:11:34] Th this this to me is an intentional
[2:11:37] statement.
[2:11:41] In in your
[2:11:43] Bibles, if you just read,
[2:11:47] Revelation 8 1 says, uh, there was
[2:11:52] silence in heaven about the space of a
[2:11:54] half an hour. When he opened the seventh
[2:11:56] seal, there was silence in heaven about
[2:11:58] the space of a half hour. After that
[2:12:00] seventh seal opens, then it starts
[2:12:02] talking about the
[2:12:04] trumpets. So, Revelation 8 and
[2:12:06] Revelation 9 actually deal with six
[2:12:08] trumpets. But the seventh trumpet does
[2:12:11] not come until Revelation 11. Now,
[2:12:14] Brother Brand's going to tell us
[2:12:15] something because this is in your Bible.
[2:12:17] He says in between the sixth trumpet and
[2:12:21] the seventh trumpet. Remember the sixth
[2:12:23] sound in Revelation 8, Revelation 9. The
[2:12:26] seventh one sounds in Revelation 11,
[2:12:29] Revelation 8, Revelation 9. And the
[2:12:33] seven trumpet sounds in Revelation 11.
[2:12:36] Does anybody know what is in Revelation
[2:12:39] 10?
[2:12:44] Well, there's a seventh angel that's
[2:12:46] supposed to reveal all the mysteries.
[2:12:47] Now, look at what brother Brandham says.
[2:12:49] This he says this, not me. Don't take my
[2:12:53] word. Take a vindicated prophet's word.
[2:12:57] Look at what he said. Look, I want to
[2:12:59] say one more thing. This all this all
[2:13:00] the time I got to say this one last
[2:13:04] thing closely
[2:13:06] now. Don't miss this.
[2:13:11] How
[2:13:13] striking from the seventh angel's
[2:13:15] message, messenger of the seventh seal
[2:13:18] message in Revelation 10. Now he say the
[2:13:20] seventh angel's message was the message
[2:13:22] in the seventh seal where there was a
[2:13:24] half hour silence. That was the seventh
[2:13:26] angel's message. And what did he release
[2:13:28] in there? The seven thunders which was
[2:13:30] the mysteries contained in the seven
[2:13:32] seals. All that was a part of the coming
[2:13:34] of the Lord. All right. He says from the
[2:13:37] seventh angel's message of the seventh
[2:13:39] seal message in Revelation 10 was the
[2:13:42] seventh seal to the seven trumpets
[2:13:44] between these two times. Oh God, how can
[2:13:47] we say this to make the people see it?
[2:13:53] Watch this. It's
[2:13:56] between that sixth
[2:14:00] trumpet. It says that he says and the
[2:14:02] sixth trumpet. But he says now you see
[2:14:04] the little the stutter lines there. He
[2:14:06] says the sixth trump. So, so it's it's
[2:14:08] between the sixth trumpet and the sixth
[2:14:11] seal
[2:14:12] sounds at the same time. And between the
[2:14:16] sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet
[2:14:23] there is a prophet. Now remember he says
[2:14:27] I want to say one more thing. Yeah.
[2:14:34] He says he said he said he said he says
[2:14:35] he says now he says between the sixth
[2:14:38] trumpet and the seventh trumpet between
[2:14:40] Revelation 9 and Revelation 11. He says
[2:14:44] he says he says in between glory to God.
[2:14:48] Amen. He says between um the sixth
[2:14:51] trumpet and the seventh trumpet, there
[2:14:52] is a prophet to appear before the
[2:14:55] Gentiles to call the people back to the
[2:14:58] original Pentecostal doctrine. And the
[2:15:01] two witnesses of Revelation appear to
[2:15:03] the Jews to send them to Jesus while the
[2:15:06] church is being taken up all of them
[2:15:08] prophets. Amen. The word of the Lord
[2:15:10] cannot be broken. It won't be a
[2:15:13] denomination. Do you see it? Now what
[2:15:16] they just told us there is that the
[2:15:19] sixth seal, sixth trumpet will sound at
[2:15:22] the same time.
[2:15:25] And I can just save you a little time.
[2:15:28] He he says in the feast of the trumpets
[2:15:30] that the six six trumpets
[2:15:34] sounded. He says it was loosed. These
[2:15:37] supernatural demons were
[2:15:39] loosed on
[2:15:41] Israel under Stalin and under Hitler. So
[2:15:46] all I'm telling you church is that when
[2:15:48] you're looking at scripture like that,
[2:15:49] it's past tense. Yes, sir. It is not a
[2:15:53] future tense because brother Brandham
[2:15:54] just told us in between the sixth
[2:15:57] trumpet, right, and the seventh trumpet,
[2:16:00] he says a prophet will appear. I wonder
[2:16:03] who this prophet that's supposed to
[2:16:05] appear. Who's this prophet that comes
[2:16:07] between the sixth trumpet and the
[2:16:09] seventh trumpet? And not only not only
[2:16:13] you know he's not just saying that if
[2:16:15] you read it in your Bible Revelation
[2:16:18] 89 first six trumpets. Revelation 11 is
[2:16:23] the seventh trumpet. Revelation 10 is
[2:16:26] somebody that comes to reveal all the
[2:16:27] mysteries. Look, let me tell you
[2:16:29] something. We had a prophet sir that
[2:16:31] revealed every mystery.
[2:16:33] And if our charts don't line up with
[2:16:37] what he
[2:16:39] said, let's discard the chart.
[2:16:43] Let's just discard the chart because
[2:16:46] this is what the prophet said, right?
[2:16:48] And I' I've been in churches where we've
[2:16:50] had these charts and I look at the
[2:16:51] chart, I
[2:16:52] said that feasting the trumpet, feast of
[2:16:55] the trumpets is not represented in that
[2:16:57] chart. So what happens? What what now
[2:16:59] there there's two things that typically
[2:17:00] happen. I'm I'm I'm done. Let me
[2:17:08] I promise
[2:17:09] you two things that happen when you
[2:17:12] don't put your chart away or update your
[2:17:16] chart. Two things happen. Either you
[2:17:19] feel like you got a greater revelation
[2:17:22] than what the prophet said
[2:17:27] or you begin to pull away from the
[2:17:28] message.
[2:17:31] That's what happens, right? Look, I'm
[2:17:34] going to stay with what the prophet said
[2:17:36] about all these things. I and and look,
[2:17:38] I'm not looking for I won't even be here
[2:17:41] to be looking for it anyway. I don't
[2:17:43] plan on being here to see whether
[2:17:45] something going to happen to the Jews.
[2:17:46] And look, it's already been happening to
[2:17:48] the Jews. It's already been and I ain't
[2:17:51] looking for no more.
[2:17:53] It's already they they they have to be
[2:17:55] pushed back into their homeland for the
[2:17:58] for the calling of the 144,000. They're
[2:18:01] not going to come after the rapture.
[2:18:03] It's only three and a half years left.
[2:18:05] Amen. To deal with all all of humankind.
[2:18:07] So there's no need for them. It just
[2:18:09] don't I'm sorry. This don't make sense.
[2:18:11] It don't make sense for after the
[2:18:13] rapture, God do something tremendous and
[2:18:15] all the Jews go back. No, that don't.
[2:18:17] It's already been happening. And this is
[2:18:19] why the prophet said, "I tried to preach
[2:18:21] it. I tried to preach it, but God showed
[2:18:23] it to me. I've supernaturally already
[2:18:24] preached this.
[2:18:27] And the supernatural things that he
[2:18:28] preached in the seals, this is where he
[2:18:31] said, "Ike men,
[2:18:34] they were they were they were they were
[2:18:36] already being persecuted under
[2:18:38] ikeman, fifth and sixth seal." And I and
[2:18:40] I just I I I was just sharing. I say,
[2:18:44] you know, brothers, the church ages deal
[2:18:46] only with the gentile church. That's us.
[2:18:50] The trumpets, brother Brandham told us,
[2:18:53] only deal with
[2:18:55] Israel. But the
[2:18:57] seals just so happen to deal with
[2:19:02] both. Gentiles in the first
[2:19:05] four, the the the the the the Jews in
[2:19:09] five and six, and then the coming of the
[2:19:10] Lord in the seventh. Now, God put all of
[2:19:13] that in the seals, which means which
[2:19:15] means to me, really simple to me, that
[2:19:18] there was a
[2:19:21] simultaneous movement, right? God moving
[2:19:25] amongst the
[2:19:26] Gentiles, God moving amongst the Jews.
[2:19:30] That's why brother Brandon would use
[2:19:32] language like it happened at the
[2:19:36] same
[2:19:39] time. I'm finished.
[2:19:42] My heart is free.
[2:19:47] [Applause]
[2:19:51] Let's pray. Father,
[2:19:56] um just something that you've placed in
[2:19:58] my heart, God, for a little
[2:20:00] bit and just having this opportunity
[2:20:03] just to express it to the church. I
[2:20:06] pray, oh God, that it'll be something
[2:20:07] that would help us in our journey. If we
[2:20:10] don't catch
[2:20:12] anything, we should simply catch that
[2:20:15] time is winding
[2:20:17] up. We don't have much longer. These are
[2:20:21] prophecies. These are things in
[2:20:22] scripture, Lord, that that will be
[2:20:25] fulfilled. And we're living in the midst
[2:20:27] of it right now. Here we are um living
[2:20:31] in a time where we see another pope has
[2:20:34] passed. And uh we know that the prophet
[2:20:36] has told us that God that there would be
[2:20:39] a pope that would rise up from the US.
[2:20:42] We also know that Revelation 13 tells us
[2:20:45] that this this second beast, which is
[2:20:47] the US, will will will throw all their
[2:20:49] power over to the first
[2:20:51] beast, which is the Catholic Church. So
[2:20:54] Lord, we we know through a prophetic
[2:20:57] lens that we are looking at things and
[2:20:59] and Lord, we want to be we want to be
[2:21:02] sincere. We want to be ready. And and I
[2:21:04] know God that some of us are have um we
[2:21:08] have situations that we're in. We need
[2:21:10] the grace of God to come to us in the
[2:21:13] form of a
[2:21:15] jubilee. Father, we we've got ourselves
[2:21:18] so messed
[2:21:19] up. We're just we don't know how we even
[2:21:22] got into conditions like this. The way
[2:21:23] that Abraham and Sarah were so messed
[2:21:25] up. They had no idea what what could
[2:21:27] they do. Nothing they could do. But you
[2:21:30] showed up supernaturally.
[2:21:32] You gave Aimilec a dream and said,
[2:21:34] "Don't you touch that man's wife. That
[2:21:37] man is my prophet." Father, and and and
[2:21:40] supernaturally, Father, you spoke to
[2:21:41] him. So, Lord, this great guster of
[2:21:43] Pentecost that we're looking for in our
[2:21:45] hour, may you do some supernatural
[2:21:47] things in the midst of your people,
[2:21:49] Lord. Give dreams, give visions as you
[2:21:51] promised according to uh Lord uh Joel
[2:21:55] chapter 2. Lord, this is a time that
[2:21:57] we're living in. And and Lord, and as we
[2:21:59] as we as you do these things to just
[2:22:02] help us awake and and shake ourselves
[2:22:05] that Lord, we would awaken out of our
[2:22:07] spiritual amnesia. Oh God, Father, we
[2:22:09] begin to recognize who you are and what
[2:22:12] you're doing. We want to be we want to
[2:22:14] be close to you, Jesus. Lord, this is
[2:22:17] our desire. I pray Lord that as these
[2:22:20] seeds were sown Father into this church
[2:22:22] today Lord that it would bring forth
[2:22:24] good fruit and that the people Father
[2:22:27] would be amen clearer Lord on where they
[2:22:30] stand and and where they are and and
[2:22:32] what you're trying to do Father in this
[2:22:34] hour Lord let them be clear. We don't
[2:22:35] want to just go through the motions but
[2:22:38] we need to understand Father and the the
[2:22:40] Bible says in all you're getting get
[2:22:43] understanding. So help us God to see
[2:22:47] what you would have us to see. I pray
[2:22:48] your blessings upon each one. Father is
[2:22:51] my prayer. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[2:22:57] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:00] Amen. Praise the
[2:23:02] [Music]
[2:23:04] Lord. Amen.
[2:23:09] Um, I I I I made this comment earlier
[2:23:12] and I want to
[2:23:13] just read it to you. So, that you want
[2:23:16] to just say think I made it up. Uh, the
[2:23:20] last quote I think I got there is a
[2:23:21] rapture quote. If uh you would just pull
[2:23:24] that up. It's a very short one, but I
[2:23:27] want
[2:23:28] to Brother Random makes a statement. And
[2:23:31] he says and the trumpet he's talking
[2:23:34] about the shout the voice the trump says
[2:23:37] the trumpet with the sound of the
[2:23:38] trumpet when it does it
[2:23:40] calls. This is always a trumpet called
[2:23:44] Israel to the
[2:23:46] feast of the trumpets. Always a trumpet
[2:23:49] called Israel to the feast of the
[2:23:51] trumpets which was the Pentecostal
[2:23:53] feast, the great feast in the
[2:23:56] sky and the feast of the trumpets. Den a
[2:23:59] trumpet denounced a calling together
[2:24:01] calling to the feast. And
[2:24:03] now that is the lamb's supper in the
[2:24:07] sky. Now watch this. Assembling together
[2:24:09] in the bride the feast of the trumpets,
[2:24:11] the wedding supper. So as we are being
[2:24:14] called out to this great wedding supper,
[2:24:17] Israel is being called
[2:24:20] back for the atonement. And that's
[2:24:23] what's going to happen, church. Amen. in
[2:24:26] um uh in this three-fold phase of the
[2:24:28] rapture. This is why I said we're
[2:24:30] already in it. We the shout has already
[2:24:31] gone forth. The voice of the
[2:24:33] resurrection is waking the sleeping
[2:24:35] bride. And then there's a trump. And
[2:24:37] when that trump sounds, we're called
[2:24:39] out, but they're called in to recognize
[2:24:42] their prophets. The same trump, not
[2:24:44] something different, but it has a
[2:24:46] two-fold purpose for that
[2:24:49] trump. Oh God, I thank
[2:24:51] God. I'm going to tell y'all something.
[2:24:53] I thank God for a prophet. I thank God
[2:24:56] for a pro. I wouldn't know these things
[2:24:58] had there not been a prophet sent. We
[2:25:00] wouldn't be able to preach messages like
[2:25:02] this had there not been a prophet sent.
[2:25:04] And there, like I said, this this this
[2:25:07] the word of God just goes so much deeper
[2:25:09] than a come outside, I want to see
[2:25:13] you. It's so much deeper than that. But
[2:25:16] when we can catch it, oo, it a producer
[2:25:19] come outside, I want to see you. I
[2:25:22] prelude to Honda. Honda prelude a
[2:25:23] prelude to Honda.

[2:27:44] I praise the Lord.
[2:27:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's bow our hearts.
[2:27:53] Heavenly
[2:27:55] Father, Lord, we thank you so much, Lord
[2:27:58] God, for light upon
[2:28:00] light after the initial illumination,
[2:28:03] Lord Jesus.
[2:28:05] the word that you have revealed to us
[2:28:08] this morning, Lord Jesus. How we can see
[2:28:11] how you were dealing with the Jews and
[2:28:12] the
[2:28:13] Gentiles simultaneous simultaneously,
[2:28:17] Lord. Father, the prophet of God would
[2:28:19] make a statement like, "As soon as
[2:28:22] Israel became a nation, immediately the
[2:28:24] angel of the Lord appeared to
[2:28:26] me in a cave. Lord Jesus, you were
[2:28:29] dealing with the prophet while you were
[2:28:31] dealing with Israel. Father, they were
[2:28:34] going back to the homeland, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:37] And you prepared a prophet, Lord, to
[2:28:40] reveal the Lord Jesus to the
[2:28:42] Gentiles. Father, they're going to
[2:28:44] receive their two prophets, Lord Jesus,
[2:28:46] that will re rece will reveal the Lord
[2:28:49] Jesus to them. We're so grateful for
[2:28:53] this grace, Lord. This is great grace
[2:28:56] Lord that you have provided us in this
[2:28:59] hour Lord to send us a prophet Lord that
[2:29:02] will reveal the seals to us by angel
[2:29:07] coming to him
[2:29:09] Lord and gross darkness Lord upon the
[2:29:12] people of this world Lord and we have
[2:29:16] light father we are a blessed
[2:29:20] people Lord I can never say this enough
[2:29:23] I can never think it enough. We are a
[2:29:25] blessed
[2:29:26] people that you would show us your love,
[2:29:33] Lord. Thank you,
[2:29:37] Father. Thank you,
[2:29:40] Lord. We were wretched, blind, going the
[2:29:44] same way the rest of the world was
[2:29:46] going,
[2:29:47] Lord. But you called us by your grace.
[2:29:50] You knew we would believe you. You knew
[2:29:52] we would accept this truth,
[2:29:55] Lord. So you called us, Lord. You sent
[2:29:58] us a prophet. You said, "Behold, I send
[2:30:01] Solomon Elijah the
[2:30:03] prophet." I'm so grateful, Lord, that
[2:30:05] that seed was within me to receive it.
[2:30:09] Not everyone can receive
[2:30:11] it, Lord. Not everyone can obey it. We
[2:30:14] see so many walking away, Lord. They
[2:30:16] were called just as we were called. You
[2:30:18] sent Elijah to them, Lord, and they
[2:30:20] wouldn't receive them. Now, they're
[2:30:23] groping in darkness with the rest of
[2:30:24] this world, Lord. But there are some
[2:30:26] that has to return. There are some,
[2:30:28] Lord, that has to be called back, Lord.
[2:30:31] Lord, may our light so shine, Lord, that
[2:30:34] they can find their way back
[2:30:36] home. Father, we ask that you would
[2:30:38] bless our pastor, Lord. Thank you, Lord,
[2:30:40] for dealing with his heart. Thank you,
[2:30:42] Lord God, for opening the word to him,
[2:30:44] Lord Jesus, that he might bring it to us
[2:30:46] to us. Restore him his strength, Lord.
[2:30:50] Bless him for his time in your presence,
[2:30:52] Lord, to bring this, to receive it, to
[2:30:54] bring it to us, Lord. Give him his
[2:30:56] strength back. Everything that he put
[2:30:58] into the service, Lord. Lord, just bless
[2:31:01] them abundantly, a thousandfold, Lord.
[2:31:04] Bless this people, all that hurt and
[2:31:07] that will receive and obey this truth,
[2:31:09] Lord. Be with each one as they go and
[2:31:12] depart from this place. Lord, as we all
[2:31:15] meditate on your truth, Lord, may we all
[2:31:17] with a grateful heart, show you our
[2:31:20] gratitude, Father, until we all come
