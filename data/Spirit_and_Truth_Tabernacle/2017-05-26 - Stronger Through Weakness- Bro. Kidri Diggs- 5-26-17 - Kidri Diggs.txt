left work I'm out in Jupiter and I notice the sky is really really dark and really really black and I'm like okay just I want the rain to hold off until I get home and I had to make a couple errands first and by the time I got to military where I live it's the rain started coming it was pouring down raining so I finally put into my complex and I'm sitting in the car and I'm like okay maybe I'll just wait the rain now maybe the raining stopped the rain didn't stop the rain got worse it was raining so hard I literally could not see the cars next to me or anything in front of me and it was just like when I looked to my left it was two palm trees there but as I'm looking to my left the rain was coming I thought it was a hurricane or a tornado I don't know what was it but all I seen was this black figure coming towards my car and it was just like all the rain and like the debris and everything was coming towards my car and my first thought was first of all my windows one crack and a double stars talking to you like yeah you're gonna die you're gonna die in the car and something go come to the windshield you're gonna die and literally like this black figure kept coming towards my car and my car was shaking and moving and I'm sitting at first I got it man I was like scaring and what was going on then I realized that was the spirit and I had to review that and I was in the car and I'm like no W ain't getting me right now so I started praying I started praying and I was like no I know the master of the storm to win the rain and every single thing the Dove was trying to do i rebuked that and I just kept on praying and praying the prayer like I prayed that this storm ceased so I can go upstairs and go home and after I finished praying literally like the rain stopped the clouds came out and I was able to go upstairs but literally it was a black figure coming toward and I could see his shape and it was just black figure coming towards my car literally a spirit was coming towards my car I was like oh no no no no I rebuked at the name of Jesus Christ I just want to thank God for protecting me he's already provided he's already provided everything yummy he's already provided every four mature cat just guys getting his name was everything you me he's already provided he's already provided he's already provided everything you made he's already provided every prophet job cackling just ask it in his name everything you need he's already provided ball ready provided he's already provided anything like me he's very provided [Music] anything just my skating everything wing me he's already provided we've already provided he is already they provided everything I need here already provided every promise I can't just get in it every promise you got I get it every promise we can't play just kidding everything we need he's already provided [Music] a man finding strength and encouragement in the words of the song everything we need a man he is already provided a man I'm going to come just to enjoy the presence of the Lord tonight he'll an aid man well we're not going to a man hold that preacher back we want him to come and just a man have his way brother Diggs does not need an introduction we've all been blessed by his ministry over the years he was kind of coming through this way for something else here in Florida and gave me a call and said well maybe we can stop by on Friday night and say that would be a blessing I mean we love to have you you know come by and just want to accept you just continue to keep him in prayer brother Diggs is one that most yelled he shared his testimony but you know we would just remember time in his life where he was he was working and driving trucks and doing all of that and and I remember him his wife bringing him down this way and the brother Diggs was going through something with his when he would get in the truck and drive his eyes were just shut just just closed on them and the only time his eyes was open is when he would go to the pulpit open up his Bible read the Word of God preached the Word of God and then after he finished preaching his eyes were closed again and I remember him calling me and telling me about a saved man that's that's a condition I've never heard of before I've never seen that but when it came down there was that brother Smiley's Church and he was preaching and and we saw him come out and you know his eyes was pretty much shut and then when they got the preaching his eyes was wide open but soon as he finished preaching and went back and his eyes closed down and we like we just felt so so much compassion in a forum but that weekend while he was they were brothers smiley they went out to eat on Sunday and at Golden Corral and while they were there eating you know brother Diggs is having people go get him a plate and you know I want this and I want that so finally brother smiley told him kind of jokingly he says if you if you really want to eat you have to get up and go get it yourself so brother dick say okay and he got up by faith and he went there and start getting this plate together and when he took that step of faith his eyes popped open and it's been open ever since ain't man it's just simple faith right it's just simple faith but what we realized what God was doing with God God God allowed that to happen to him so he would come off of his job and do his real job and that's preach the gospel of Jesus Christ so a man when we see brother Diggs we see a living miracle a man and and multiple ways God has proved himself in his brother's life and and we're just very grateful you know very grateful just to have them pass this way so let's just start let's prepare our hearts to receive the word Lord let's all stand a man at this time let's just think a little bit of this song your presence is heaven to me as our precious brother Diggs would come a man to just share with us what the Lord has placed in his heart tonight [Music] your presence is heaven to be come on everybody sing that your presence is heaven your presence [Music] to me come on everybody sing with all your heart your practice is headed say is heaven to me to be your best on stage it is heaven yes it is to me Oh hallelujah let your foot sing tonight you're perfect thing is heavy [Music] yeah [Music] who is not you know who is like

this presence tonight amen how many glad to be in his presence hey man certainly good to be in the house of the law we thank the Lord for all of it here amen and we're depending on the lovely Lord Jesus Christ amen let's just pray and we're going to get into the word tonight and I guess prime Lord Jesus father we love you tonight and Lord we thank you for your grace that you've given us Lord and we know that we're not here based upon our own ability the Lord you saw each and every person here before the foundation of the world hello God let us take full advantage of this opportunity Lord Lord to hear your word and to receive your word and to act on your word and also we know that many are called but few are chosen Lord and we're just happy to be in the land of the living and we pray that the inspiration is given Lord is following good ground tonight Lord God that the word would bring forth some 30 60 100 fold tonight though we pray to you just continue to bless past the Lord family law and his church family Lord and all those who are here though God we just pray that supernatural be relevant tonight in this place in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church hey man y'all ready better net come on somebody saying man amen praise the Lord Amen those of you have your Bibles right manless let's turn to UM Matthew the fourth chapter you know them kind of songs are very hard to turn loose you know you're singing about being in the presence of the Lord who is like you and all the earth you know matches loving Beauty endless worth nothing in this world can satisfy because Jesus you're the cup I won't run dry oh my hope who Jesus Christ I wouldn't work what what you know there's another song kind of my heart but it's what a beautiful name it is nothing compares to this what a beautiful name you have no rivals you have no equals what a powerful name is oh my Matthew for this let's start at verse why there was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil if that's something God is being led to be tempted by the devil not my mind why so the temptation what we're about to see is the shows that we can have victory because Jesus was never attempted to lose the battle but he was tempted to wind about and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was after a hunger and when the tips it came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth God and the devil taketh him up into the holy city and seize him upon the pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto Him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and I don't taking him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto Him all these things will I give thee as I will fall down and worship Me and he said unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written that thou is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy god in him only shalt thou serve a man let's go to UM 2nd Corinthians 12 2nd Corinthians 2:12 chapter I started verse 7 you have a say man and at least at least I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffered me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it may that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I'd rather glory in my father's I left in his father's hand ohhohh most gladly therefore hour with a glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong Amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats a man praise the Lord tonight I hope you can see I'm gonna take my salt out of those last verses we read strong in weakness amen you know the Prophet preached a message perfect strength by perfect weakness but think about that that just that title what makes your strength perfect going through it in a time of weakness so if you've never had any adversity you've never get any stronger because you need opposition so you can see where you are you need a trial of faith so we can many of them stand you know and you learn something I believe the Lord has really been dealing with me and bringing me through that the only way your love can become perfect as if that love is testing and when you laugh testing is tested in a way that you're not used to living in it so you have to let think about you got to love someone even when you don't agree with him or you have to lower child it may be is going in the world now still your child and your love is testing but the truth but but the strength in that is when you can love that person unconditionally amen and that's what God did for us amen he loved us unconditionally Church even though we were born in sin and we did so many things that were contrary to the Word of God that did not change our God's just about us so touched that you know the scripture also says that you know through the page Christ with who he was made perfect holy so turn we don't want a life of a life that's trow free I know we would love to have that but that's not God's Way man because the Bible says every son and heir of God has to be tested and tried we have to be proven to forgot want to see what's in your heart you know you go back and really do Ronna me in and it different stricter than the Old Testament may begin to talk about you know not only on the other side and God said hey I'll add you this way so I could prove you so I could see what was in your heart to see what's waiting we're going to turn as the pressure came so sometimes that will try you to see what's in you because there's a lot of people in church but the tower care who you really are a man you'll tell you why you love her but the power tell whether you really love or not you tell you hovering you love you it's quite a child tell if you really do that here and so the trial is Deborah stretching you a man and think about it test the Bible say who you count it all joy when you fall into diversity and he said counsel child more precious than what go tried in the fire that means church we are not experiencing just regular child but with the ground there isn't crowds got here we experiencing teens holy that would bright the churches of all you know what because we are coming into perfection and there has to be a perfect strength hallelujah it has to be a perfect strength to pull away from that perfect weakness amen and you don't touch it in this time you know so many people I really I read Matthew the fourth chapter because you look I want to show you how to operates now if you are a user uh a smoker the devil's not gonna try you alcohol he want to deal with the witness honey so you watch you in me you'll see if you're really over it or not and you I hate to say it but real wait till you get in certain atmosphere see you have a minor line up earlier yeah well no present liya you know was a liya before you know we're gonna do the atmosphere weakness and you might think you strong holier but a - no deliverance if there's the Holy Ghost you are in the most trying time of your life and God loves to put a thing so he can show us how strong he is and you know what the enemy does we feel like we weak we feel like we're so unworthy and discourage and all these things well that they say like this and we didn't have no witness what knee would it be for Calvary Whitney would it be for the Holy Ghost what dealing with a people with Jesus just better resurrection if we had everything already locked up so because of our witnesses God kept us on the pawnshop hallelujah but you know churches the reason why I read as I looked at it look at Matthew the fourth chapter I will says you know when Jesus was Mazetti but experience is willing to be gifted of the you you know that one scripture says that God don't give you which one is it huh you know if he's being tempted of the devil and God yielded himself to allow the enemy to give him hugs and you know it also said that God gifted Abraham who are you didn't Bible says when you're tempted only your typical God what is the church well let's understand something by temptation hug God was gifted in every point every matter that you could ever experience why so in your weakness you become strong so God now allow himself to be gifted in every area that we can experience there be a certain area in your life that you can say with that I'm allowed to fall in this I'm allowed to fall in this because you did not feel my pain but my god sis Michelle is so great telling you he will give you an excuse hello yeah he was active you're right to say that the blood of Jesus did not deal with your situation oh yeah the problem of God he said oh yeah they said we tried to make our weaknesses explosive well you know the devil is the devil mainly just in the delegate a lot the devil made me put that on Facebook the devil made me put those Instagram pictures I did like it the devil maybe let's understand something no he didn't right so he got that calipower thank a maker you nothing we were all of you so don't blame it on your weaknesses holy night me on your ability or shelf will because anything we do if we want to do it all without trigger Satan gonna have enough power to stop you fire you from doing good if you want you yeah what I said I said from doing good if you want you oh yeah you know God is a keeper if you want to be captain but this is the thing some people don't want to be capped but I used it only weaknesses and everything looks the messages duct and the message is that and it's heart of thing is you don't see the promise that doesn't look at that and I just don't see it no all the time of you for weakness but that's really an excuse for what you really want to do oh yeah but you know a lot of times people say where the devil made me do it and every entertain they say well let's understand something proper God said honey he said let's see something you see this this is a bottle water can get a man use ain't no trick question just a bottle off a man's a bottle on everybody see this ain't David Copperfield is a bottle off now this paint on the water is up right right it was made to be that way but what happens to the bottle water when I turn it upside down is they still what is it coming out is it coming out now what's holding it from coming out the seal as long as it got a seal and then coming out so tickle your asses for example as long as you got to feel anger you do that folder you can get tough we can get pulled around but if there's a see up anything coming out if there is a seal ain't nothing coming up say you can make you feel like your love you put on your own what if there's a seal Amen coming out in your weakness if there's a seal and then coming out we're gonna be being apart you'll be matched up you can be talked about you mean Idol but as as a seal we can be turned upside down who is as a seal will be shaking it every which way but loose but if there's a seal Amen come it out so the devil can't let you through nothing when there's a seal in your life I really want to show you this tells you because you know sometimes we don't cover we don't know we're coming on we go and we say the devil is to delegate the devil devil the devil it was once recognizable even if it's unrecognizable if there's a seal Amen come in some people say when they used to be as they used to be that but if there's a seal he's fear the same father he just look a little different don't let the devil beat you up in your weakness you are so hello yo booty the telus devil I'm being tired because I got paisa because God will never test anything that doesn't belong to him come on somebody talking the Bible says let the weak say that I am why because there's something in your life that's keeping you I'm not giving myself he's keeping me hugging funny because you know what sometimes you get pressed upon what the seal will keep you sometimes you get knocked around but the sale will keep you he hate the water keeping itself is the sale keeping it inside hallelujah solo use excuses for your weaknesses yes your weaknesses show that you need something greater than you and that's why God comes on the scene because we wants to show you that he's greater than any other thing you can experience but what we do we get all shame and you know watch it doesn't I did does it I would take that to my grave you're gonna die and see you and I'm seen and you Diane seeing that means you separated from God so in your weaknesses in your times of adversity you should run to God the mall and say lord I need you that's what your weaknesses are supposed to do that's supposed to run you to God not away from God further and we've got too many people running away from God when God is trying to make you stronger honey that's what he's doing Church look young man I might I might look a little funny to some of y'all but don't worry about also little weight ah there's a little baggie now hallelujah in my weakness I become strong hallelujah sorry but you know even even if you take my testimony working out and getting in shape you don't have to tear my muscles down to build them up Holly if I never feel any pain I'm never getting any bigger honey I'm never mind my muscles will not get me really strong they met seekers when you work out if you don't get a barn I mean what you're doing is normal and then to me that people come to church and levels in a bar they're looking a burn that'll feel the fire of the Holy Ghost which is calm and we sing and we go home and you don't get a barn I mean you ain't going holy and we are in the day but we are supposed to experience a bird every time we work out and let me say it I just have you not getting a burn is because your body is used to that particular workout so you have to shock it higher you get used to the posisorter pastor called evangelist and he's supposed to shock you a man hallelujah check out what we do with easy to shop sometimes a man because we've gotten used to coming to church we've got used to hearing the clothes we got used to doesn't loosen it is a plot to get shot you know the shock does it takes you out of your comfort zone and then when you really get shot the real you comes out because you don't have time to hesitate to think about what you're gonna say if you get shocked when you get shot sometimes you just react and whatever comes out and if a demon see that you they really sewing so lightning but if this if there's a if there's a sale even when you get shocked sometimes the right thing oh come on honey you see people do things to you like me honey no you don't go persecute you say Father forgive them you say God have mercy you didn't got shocking you like lord have mercy upon them honey look search we try to make our weaknesses excuses Romans 5:8 but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so we have no excuses because he's already made a way can't charlie so everything that we could go through and you know when I look at the scripture I want to show you how the enemy loves to attack like like I said if you are a smoker Holly he gonna fit some bottles and James in front you know he wants to get you in that atmosphere where you're tempted you know I thought we were trying to tell our young people stay away from the world huh you know I'm all right I'm good I'm just a neck if you ain't got the only goes your nature will easily gravitate to that senior because there's a law inside of it yourself I won't see oh there's something inside of you hariya that's that was born to do wrong and it's called a kernel nature carnal nature borders of the world speaking lies Hullinger commit iniquity amen honey you're late that's the nature of every child born in this world the only one bypassed that was Jesus Christ because he one more like we were he was born according to the spoken word hallelujah see so you catch it in the midst of all this the word is the only thing that can give you strength in your weakness home and you know as I look at it turns look at this Matthew for said he to be tempted of of the devil and so forth and like I said you know the scripture say that he went to kill Abraham and in one place it says you know when you're tipsy don't say your tenders of God well let's deal with the part being tempted of God if they don't say you're doing your tivity intentions of God first of all if God ever allows you to be gifted it's not fulfill yeah that's why he says when you're tip - don't say you attempted of God because that kind of him taking he's talking about produces failure but we went we allowed Abraham to be tempted that wasn't for failure that was to show what was inside you so bad allowed Abraham to be gifted in his weakness but what if is trying to produce a son and ain't none ever heard he got so bad up he's that hey you ain't my wife you muscle slow weakness and you're not careful you and me in such a carnal real that you can miss the word is rightly Knightly in your mouth ready to move in your favor Church I always say there's no problem sitting here in that moment with Abraham looked at Sarah's again day girl you find that I don't know what didn't ever move way grandma looking good hey in the book did you look at it why was a man she's fair to look upon Oh 75 year old nineteen year old woman he didn't see a grandma Turkey because of his weakness and he's here he couldn't even see that the promise was right there beside him if Sarah was restored she was ready the eggs were there but he was so much concentrating on his weakness that he missed the Word of God was right there class that God said it in the right season right that's the appointed time you're gonna have a child now that could be reported time but are you just wet his eyes and now he's going down he's egg you know yeah you like you you might start a fire and I can see looking at it in all that fear come over that's what stops you from coming to God fear in your weaknesses because you're afraid to be found out let me tell you something God already know it ain't no CPD already know you just want you to confess it and get it right see touch I want you to understand something God will not put his hands on you with seen in your life until not you can have sin in your life but if there is a confession then God can put his hands on you but as long as you were like what you go out ain't no better than me in this manner ablah God can't do that remember the woman who committed adultery and she came in talking to brother Brennaman so on so forth and she was dying and she know why she's got this is her moment of weakness when our deliverance was speaking to she comes in there and he says you know you see the vision you say I seen you in a car with a certain man and you're gonna rebel tracking you almost got hit and she does I'm over the weakness she wanted to hide but God was trying to make her skull sometimes God will allow sickness for glory I got this one out I look out don't do that holding y'all but I got out God will allow sickness for his glory put it in my weakness with cancer in my brain God revealed to me that he was to hover aha so is that that cancer I would never know that God was a healer and Here I am 20-some odd years with the same revelation that God is a healer oh he's on change so y'all looking at me like really does he get he really a castle yes I did it's true in my brain but God delivers cuz in my hour of weakness I need a stress grater and how did that stream come Isaiah 53 the strength was in the word it wasn't in the operation it wasn't in chemotherapy and what did radiation treatments cladding taking it all I took was biased eyes I'm here fiery and the word was a big to hear me anytime anyplace anywhere any condition any circumstance just speak the word and in your weakness become strong because God has to back up his word who you church is time for us to get the revelation of that speak the word because God is obligated to his word huh but she's old sometimes we're going through it you know like I was saying perfect loves and always really showed me perfect love and you know you you got things in your life and you praying right now no no please don't let this have little peace disabled father I believe you Lord please Oh to you please please you know that is that's a prayer of fear yeah you are Lord please Lord please move Lord please move but what's motivating that prayer this is fear of faith cuz I remember the Bible says perfect love casteth out so if you really got perfect love there's no fear you're able to trust God you're able to say you know I found myself doing this more so now than I ever did right I don't know what's going on but I believe that's where I'm at church I try to figure it out no more well my passing though acid whom I pass don't ask him who am i touching agreed on acid I'm like loud I don't know what they're low but I know if I work out with my doula that's what we have to research and your witness we made strong by believing the scripture Holy Church Jesus being tempted of the devil in the devil look when he comes he comes when he knows it's your weakest moment Jesus been fasting 40 days and then the Bible says and after he hung why didn't he come why he was on the fan huh why don't he come when you pray when you concentrate when you in church like he's supposed to be why he don't message it in because you can get God more do you hear him honey now the Bible says after he says he he's homeless the hunger came after the concentration was over didn't come to them and how did the temptation come how did he tempt him he tempted him about what he just gave cold today you be got turn these stones into bread why pray because his weakest movement was the fasting he was hungry so you wonder why certain things happen to you it may be he's just the enemy looking at what you're watching on the internet you wonder why you can't sleep cuz that movie you watching you wonder why you have a nightmare because you you wonder why you can't sleep it's because you opened the door of weakness and you get in the prayer line it's all leather jacket with me I can't sleep all you guys do is stop watching f-feel cause all you guys help hold the door and the devil is done hollows see he started you to find your witness and he here poked you by the witness honey now if you want now if you want a smoke we'll use a drink up here you go bring on new how do you he's just gonna let you go to one of your family me more cookouts you know more you dated with you all this stuff feelings in my family you know we ain't bothering nobody and before you got say it's the same atmosphere now they got the alcohol table in the kool-aid table and then they mix it all together because they can't keep it separate can't keep it separate I got it all cake cake cake cake cake but they know my stance when I color my housing Dre can nope hey real question no but you know they so addicted they so weak it's so weak they leave it in the car and they tie whatever I don't have a good time yet Nathan you always disappear you want songs alright you got attended at weakness but see that kind of weakness is really a torment that's a demon see one thing you have to realize harder that's something that God allowed to come on you and then there's something that you won't let go holy because he said cash joke as a bunny oh yeah he says take my yoke olya he says his burden is light and so forth so God is saying your problems or trouble give it to me but one thing we realized there's too many people that don't want to give up so then that trial becomes a torment and I saw that the devils old power is there he wants to torment you it's something to say then take some you young people you make your mind up you say but that's it serve the Lord with all my heart and then that young man that you've been dreaming about all of a sudden you get interested hey girl you doing are you thinking like he never told him you a full night he talking to me he's anointed he dealing with your weakness what I want you to catch Satan is so crafty his deal with your weakness at the same time God calling you and God will allow it so he can see what's in your heart so he can see which one you want the worst the best that's why people can come to church calling it giving we're live here and go to a field God allows you to be a place to hear truth hallelujah so you can really see you ain't got that but real sustaining power hallelujah hey Turk I threw a couple back in my day I had me a little taste every 90 but when I got delivered hallelujah when I got deliver when I got sealed honey honey it ain't a boy while I was pulling up the jeep behind that seal but he later hidden church it ain't no velvet bag pretty enough some of y'all know what I'm talking about hallelujah can I get a witness it ain't no velvet bag pretty enough to make me full one by colors because there's a seal there now oh yeah and the problem of God huh you know you say the devil maybe loses every day you say look for the devil to get past that seal he has to be your brother huh for him to get bad that seal God got to be his father and ain't no way sinking it past and seal ain't no way the devil can get back yet hallelujah we go here never confess you got the Holy Ghost huh ah we'll use that excuse Omo hallelujah because judge he can't get past the word he can't get back at all you got to do is use the word that's all Jesus you Jesus could have made fire come on in hand out of it loses gotta been able to tell but he didn't do anything he just spoke the word and the interview was dealt with why won't we do the same thing speak the word honey and you know why and that this message tonight is not being preached just for a good sermon but there are some of us who have weaknesses that we're okay with but what we need to seek for is the difference because what I love about Paul Paul has something wrong on his flesh and he went to God about it God announcer he went to God again garden Elsa he went to God again and God answered you know why God acid because he didn't pause we'll keep coming think about that church God asked him because God knew Paul will go keep coming because he believed that God had an answer to all things he was going through and our problem is we give up too easy we start praying we get complacent hello yes sir I didn't find myself beating the flow rod I leave it out and God don't you know that do I go back and I beat the flow again and God don't answer and I said Lord you will get tired of me beating the floor because I need to hear from you that's real faith church real faith doesn't settle for imagination further you who are can imagine look you know what we do we imagine with a swell God don't ask me any long time and that might be true but let him decide that let him decide that you will decided you'll keep coming free tell you to stop hungry that's what I do I keep coming to tell me to stop hurting and you don't tell me to stop I will keep telling because you know that they I think he like that praise and adoration hallelujah but you don't test when you look at weaknesses and different things and feel Paul kept coming and coming and Allah say look I got this here because there's something special about you think about that Church God allows certain situations in our life God allows some of us to take certain paths so we can bring out certain things honey church David huh Leah Tucker man's wife computers adultery all these things on a day he decided not to fight and I was having it stupid so the doctors too many people get relaxed and they lose a will to fight David the kingdom was looking good everything all right and it you know walk him up and there's a y'all go ahead I'm gonna stay home and rest I'm gonna say I'm gonna take it easy I'm feeling real strong and

everything alright and I'm gonna take me a rest and then he went up on about it and he got wild Oh give him their strong David turn into a lion turn into an adulterous a murder premeditated murder did

of his people inhabited me he dwells and he or by here asses in that place that's what his there he can't say that is in the book now so all I gotta do is give you some place I mean God tells me he inhabits the praises of his people so why we raising him go to know God dwells in the midst of place he loves to be praised if you want to see God get all shook up give him some praise today happy to do something to him he's like a woman being touched by husband she see me in two weeks he come home as a girl I'm here alone that's ideally you begin to worship Jesus how you begin to bring it into a

God can fight your battle he said you're fighting it yourself see just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him this is he says the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just community him and God will take care of it don't you believe that don't you believe realism and the boys he can't don't you believe it Turkey you make him what he's Harlan when you are in need you make him go over job when you're sick you make him jover up huh Leah hey man listen he says and again he defeated Satan on the Word of God that shows that you can defeat Satan on the Word of God no matter the Word of God was a V Satan anyplace anywhere on the inner condition it is it it is in the belly of the whale or in a lion's d-day was in a deal alliance why because he prayed oh right you know in some places I'm persecuted cuz I'm a preacher some of you persecuted because you're a Christian you being persecuted for the good you doing and you think God hang on co fight that back the scripture said be not weary in well-doing hardly since he says uh he said he say even they're gonna bad with cancer or land yonder bleeding to death in an item of the accident the Word of God will defeat Satan in you anywhere and the week is Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it the week is Krisha we won't do that some more laws of a hallelujah you know the Bible says he says it you X anything these are you experiencing in my name if you ask what this erect anything in my name I will do sir are you hearing me tonight didn't say under this circumstance physics at do comedy do you think at this truth you can you act no I don't sound like y'all believing she says you guys anything in my name I will do and this is the confidence that we have oh my god little old for you today oh and one thing about the law it can't be broke the devil can break these laws and this is a covenant that we have oh if you act in your heart can give you now you can have what you ask for either Christians are here tonight anybody free from condemnation anybody got freedom in a life we're mean a heart there's no condemnation so the Bible says whatever here you can have it ha oh Jesus but in the whole surface of the burden ask and it shall be asked in a Shelby get sick oh you're not all scriptures it is they seek and you might find it it is a seeking one day a gonna come if they seek and ye shall find now Wow you know what knocking is knocking his desperation parley sometimes you got to put some fasting in that day huh remember put some supplication in it you got to push the plate back the other god I need this when I was who I needed I know you got it up I'm knocking Oh jump out and I'll go knock until you open the door you said knock and the door shall be opened anybody knocking but being in the same context the scripture says for you ask it receive it yeah double-o are you asking receive it and you fake it filed it and you are get the door shall be opened here and then they go to jeremiah he said call upon me and i will be found of you oh there you go and exited and moses head he called upon the lord and god has at him with the wrong so why didn't we ask what are we seeking why are we knocking we're trying to use our weaknesses don't make no excuses we're gonna destroy that tonight with this last long I'm gonna give you the last law there's plenty other one but this is the one I like water one you know the Bible says if you will speak to the mouth but were you speaking to it you placing it somewhere it said in these outcasts into the sea honey don't just talk to a talent where you wanted to go farther than a man you remember remember - you remember them demons in Legion when they came out a lot can we please go in the slide can we paid going to the swine Lord you gonna tell me to skate little goes as what any of God granted the request of demons leave us they granted the request of demons Church just wicked a ham we're on a fast and God that is judgment I am crushed well fast and gossiped say I have humble himself before me how you gonna bring the judgment in his day but in his son's day what about us if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray there what I see from heaven and heal my church this is this this this is going to be the law above laws you know what it says speak to the mountain head you know in mark 11:23 what it talks about you know whatever you pray you believe what you actually you have it if you don't doubt in your heart the key to that is you got to have forgiveness because once you finish that part about all the power you post have you got to ask forgiveness you said then why you stand praying forgive holiday amen and you can forgive you can wait on that lesson but this is the one I love like the prophet of God said he said when the car was going he said what we did was we got down on our knees and we put a claim it was a loss and man you just call back it's all his family clothes everything he said he had a vision but this was descriptive possible views now the Bible says wherever two or three I will believe
