to give you all an update a man on some things and then I want to go right into the word of the Lord if I could just get the building front update thank you so much as you all are aware we are in the process of raising money so that the Lord will bless us with our own church and school and we started a little journey on last year and they man we are continuing that journey this year our goal for this year is to raise a hundred and five thousand dollars we have pledged so far people that say that they would contribute towards that we got fifty six thousand eight hundred nine dollars pledge towards that and then and receive year-to-date amen for this year that's not including last year but include just this year we received three thousand three hundred eighty two dollars and nine cents we want to thank God for that raising and that received has remained neck because it has not been touched to be used for any other purpose but the building fund we thank God for that a man that he has blessed us so we you know three thousand three hundred eighty two dollars is a blessing and I'm grateful for that so anybody that would like to help us get to our goal we have little forms out there on the table that you can take and just say hey I want to pledge something towards that as well and a man this is so that we can be blessed with our own church and own school a man and the way I'm just one that believe God is a God of multiplication a man and I believe that as we just give our best you know one time in scripture the best that they had is four thousand people and you can you imagine four thousand people they must've been pretty excited to leave home with that nothing to eat there was excited people five thousand one time four thousand man got his family in his arms we're going to see Jesus can you imagine this and maybe their wife say well let's get some food no I don't worry about the food we're gonna see Jesus and they get there to see Jesus ain't nobody got nothing to eat and Jesus tell disciples my feet they feed the people I think that we can get enough money and offering to take care of these folk we got with Jesus what can we do here you know with this he says and Peter you know how Peter is he was very outspoken Peter said I told you to send them people we look early they would have got there to the shops for folding clothes and then would have some meat he's saying that we don't kept these people out here all day they will die going back trying to get see Jesus I tried to tell you Jesus saying I just just just have the people sit down get calm have them sit down now I told you feed them people and say now look through a congregation and tell me what you got and and they went through search and you got something ain't got nothing you got something ain't got nothing you got something I mean Oh thousand nine hundred ninety nine people with nothing and there happened to be one little boy and a little boy a little boy saying I got a few fish in some loaves of bread there all right let me had act and it took that to Jesus and Jesus saying I what you got Peter say two fish and five loaves of bread and I can imagine it don't say this in Scripture but it's just my imagination Peter Jesus and Peter say what you gonna do with that what you gonna do with that Jesus and Jesus I just have mom sit down have mom sit down I will show you what we can do with that and all he did was just saying prayer it was just a friend and then he said now what I need you to do is take this and feed the people and it was only two fish and five loaves of bread but as they just took a little piece it multiplied and then it took another piece and they multiplied and and as it was in the basket me what they were giving it out they would give it to one and they look like the one that they gave out got replenished and then the next one they gave I got replenished and then the next one egg and they went through five thousand people even a little boy that gave his fishing bread he got seen and the good thing about it that it didn't stop there they didn't run out you understand anything run laughs everybody got fed the Bible said it had left of us and I'm gonna tell you when God do things he he do things with leftovers come on somebody you ought to expect some leftover you ought to expect some overflow [Applause] glory to God our God is a God that multiplies the man if anything taken from me he gonna give it back y'all didn't get that I see if anything taken from you Oh God is a good God and we just under expectation for great and mighty things certainly appreciate the presence of the Lord here this morning amen brother Troy doing a song service thank God for him man how the testimony sister Tanya a man receives new job amen and the special state gun for touching sister Shonda as of yesterday she wants to be singing this morning the Lord touches me imma give it my all we appreciate that sisters time - god bless you god bless you

song amen the testimonies we appreciate you in man very very much I tell you what I I want to read a scripture and I noted heard different sayings that are business for the first time god bless you thank you so much it's good to have you in service and it meant good to see sister Blanche a man and the house of the Lord is well thank God for her but I want to read a scripture here and we'll try to get started a thought I don't know if we'll finish it today but at least we'll get started a man in in this thought if you always stand to your feet with me turn with me to second chronicles chapter 7 praise the Lord second chronicles chapter 7 and very familiar passage that we'll read from verse 14 says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now mine eyes shall be open in my ears a tenth them to the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever in my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually Amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray over what we've read father we thank you for the reading of the word but father we pray that the inspiration would come today to Lord just inspire us to even draw closer to you from the things that we've read we know that you're in control of the service we felt your anointing and in this place we know you here and got now as the word goes forth break the the power the enemy and in the lives of your people every chain guard let it be broken I recall in Scripture the Bible says that's Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on the people so what we're praying that you would do just that today thank you for all things that have been done we know there's a little bit more that you want to do so help us all to enter in and receive from heaven even at this moment we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even now Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord we want to use a man for our title today five characteristics of revival amen five characteristics of revival and just bear with me as we just kind of get through this thought there's a few little things that I just want to drop here and there and we'll just see what the Lord where the Lord takes this a man but I want to start a man with a quote from the third seal as I prepare to just read this quote this is a quote that as I was coming up in a man in church various meetings that we would tend this was a quote that was very harped on a lot of people would read this and and they were just really really focused on it focus on it focus on it and and when I read it what it does is actually takes a revival and puts the revival in the future a man it constantly puts a revival in the future but uh but today a man by faith I'm bringing it a man not just I'm not putting in a future I'm bringing that present tense a man by faith I want to bring it there but let's just look at this as a statement here out of the third seal he says now that's what's the reason today the revival that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we got revivals right he say don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival no we're right no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there has been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now now watch see now she was dead so now when they read this quote they're always I say the bride hasn't had a revival yet a man that says we're looking for it and it says it's gonna take the seven unknown thunders to wake her up again now I want to just drop something off if that's what he said that we're looking for it a man and it's going to take the seven unknown thunders the wake up again what we do know a man is that a man the revelation of the seven unknown thunders were contained in the seals hallelujah amen the revelation progressed if I can put it that way this statement was made as he was preaching the seals but after the seals have opened a man maybe that maybe the rest of the world and realize it but surprise entered into revival hallelujah somebody amen and this revival was something that a man that we entered into because of the opening of the world right and since we're living underneath the opening on the word can I said this way we are in continuous revival hallelujah so I wanna say it I make it real clear I'm not waiting a revival I am in revival you all remember you know it our Welsh revival Amen they went looking for this great manifestation of God and they gotta you know they come from the west door I mean I come from the East going Western and when they went there they they got I got on the other side and then and got to England and said now now are we gonna ask the police officer where can we find the Webster if I'm we don't know what address to go to where can we find a net they stopped the police officer he stood in the middle of the street saying so you ain't gotta go no further than this because I am the Welsh revival hallelujah his life has been changed amen my life has been changed your life has been changed and it's being changed from glory to glory praise God you are in revival right now it's not a feeling it's not an emotion it's a revelation hallelujah I'm in it right now hallelujah let me go to another little thought here that he he he makes hearing us in this message expectation hallelujah glory to God glory to God brother Jim a man that is right there Amen hallelujah hallelujah you know I'm gonna tell you this is not the first time I happened but a few weeks ago we were here ministering on a subject and I come out and I begin to read some quotes from a particular message and when I say you know I just finished listening to that same sermon and here you come preach them right from the sermon that I was listening to that's that's revival hallelujah amen if you give see and remember that revival don't come about a minister Reviver come by the people and what they doing in the holes when you listen to the word when you plan when you seek him God you you come to church you realize hey goddess speak at all we gotta do is enter into what he's doing so to say I was saying you read right where I was listening to that was confirmation and you know I said Amen brother Jim cuz he told me say brother I was praying and God gave me this word expectation that's all and when he told me that I knew I had this quote sitting here expectation hallelujah so if don't nobody else getting my brother Jimmy get something all right come on look at this he says in expectation it says now we don't mean to say agar a true great revival and don't get headlines a true great revival and let me tell you I n1 right now it don't get a true great revival don't get headlines and things like that no no there's one thing that Jesus lacked in his life I hate to say that but he did Jesus like one thing what is that a modern showmanship Jesus was not a show-off showmanship oh my god I mean you know actually it wouldn't probably be Jesus you know trying to run a television broadcast that's not the way it would be well if Jesus was on earth today what what happens that you have people live streaming him Whitney phones he wouldn't be running a telephone block broadcast the people would be live streaming what was going on oh my god hey man listen he said Jesus he said one the teens like one thing a modern showmanship he wasn't a show-off no to say that but he said says everybody today's got to have a great big headlines and bragging what they're doing that's a stuff sir that's right that's not a servant of God a servant of God will be humble keeping himself back and when the revival comes look we'll always come when it come in the days of Jesus just in the minority just a few people listen look what John had out there on the banks just a few people gathered around from the regions around about to hear him about 99 percent of them rejected his message and walked away yeah it was a great revival and a shaking time God shakes things oh I love that statement God shake things so sometimes you start going through little things here and there and you wonder where this came from God six things maybe your boss get a little upset with you you wonder whether you're gonna keep that job or not God shakes things and people don't realize it's being done see God shakes his church the revival is to his church I like that I like that it's not to the denomination but it's to his church notice what the Bible said if my people if my people let me go a little further who are called by my name do you know his name Oh church revolving for everybody it's for his church and if it's my people that are called by my name you know Jesus came in his father's name the reason that I'm Doug is because I took on my father's name hallelujah whatever your last name is it's because you took on yet the name you were born with that's because you took on your father's name and if you got married you should have took on your husband's name hello somebody we don't got this thing on mixed up nowadays not a husband's ticket on the wife's name that's preferred it's the wife's brother take on the hospice name she leaves her father and a mother now she joins forces with a husband hallelujah but when you were born you took on your daddy's name you didn't choose the name and whatever your daddy's name was that was your name unless you were adopted into the family you still took only daddy's name if you was adopted praise the Lord somebody right with Jesus came in his father's name so if if we call him Jesus if we know him as Jesus then his daddy's name was Jesus you understand not father son Holy Ghost he took on his father's name yes so the name of Jesus must be the name that the name of the son must be the name of the father that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not just a title Father Son and Holy Ghost but in the name what is his name Sourav I've only come to the people that are called by his name [Music] looking for you'll never receive it they'll never get headlines because it comes amen to those that I called by his name if my people which are called by my name so humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways that's thus sayeth the Lord Oh hallelujah people don't even know what real revival is come on I'm good I want to give some characteristics of it so Lizzie says he says I believe that the church is called out now see the robbers to his church I believe that the church is called out now but the thing to revive is to revive and shake the church to his place again so revival is going to shake the church hallelujah not the rest of everybody else that's not called by his name that can't be shook but revival come to shape the church hallelujah let me go a little further amen amen now you know there's a couple of things that I want to just kind of make mention now I won't read all of this but you know every day the prophets say every generation has given their chance at a revival every generation so you know even when God took his prophet home revival did stop revival continue know and there was a bird supposed to be certain characteristics that were there for you to know that you were in revival hallelujah I want to give them to you I want to give them to you just bear with me here there are certain things that you would see and when you begin to see like like if I was if I was getting my car and I wanted to go to Miami I know Amen just by living here in Florida I know I got to go south to get to Miami and there are certain roles that would take me down there right and when I get on those roads I want to see signs telling me that I'm headed towards Miami Amen I might see one side say Miami is 50 miles and if I keep driving I should see some say Miami 35 miles but I keep driving should say Miami 20 miles amen and eventually I'm gonna get to the point where it's gonna say welcome to Miami hallelujah imma be there but but see the thing of it is we got to see some of the science that God is trying to point out to us you are in revival right now amen don't get caught with that quote and misplace it hallelujah because there's still some people waiting the prophets been gone for years and they still waiting the thunders have already ordered and the revelations are contained in all seven seals praise God that's what the prophet told us yes hallelujah let me go in a little further he said this in a smyrnaean church age says he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches now this is going to be critical because in order for you to be in revival this is gonna be part of it just gonna be one of the characteristics look at this says he that hath the needle let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches of each age and every age it was the same cry hear what the Spirit says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the Spirit is teaching he told you what the Spirit was teaching what is the spirit teaching I can tell you this hallelujah let me just let me just let me just take my time right here the Spirit is not teaching get in the booth right that's four day gone by if you saw some man building a boat come on it's gonna rain that's what you talkin about my friend we know it's gonna rain we experienced raining all the time here floor and he invite you to come get us both that Capote I'm not giving it that was a message for they go by and if you saw somebody a man stem that side and I'd kill the lamb a goat or a lamb or something and they taking blood and putting on the top of a doe not literally like that anymore amen but the token is the life that you live by the Holy Ghost message like that I'm not gonna put that up on my on my door and on my side post like that that's message that message what they going by hallelujah hallelujah glory to God if somebody preached them to you only the restoration of the gifts that's a message for a day gone by if somebody preaching to you only that the just shall live by faith that's a message for a day that's gone by if they only preached in sanctification that's the message for they go by we need all that we need justification we need sanctification we need the restoration of the gifts but on top of that we need the restoration of the word in a message for your day go preach the restoration of that word oh I got some things I got to say here they haven't brought you to the restoration of word and they've stopped short oh that's a promise from God a man that according to revelation 10 all the mysteries of God would be revealed when the seventh angel begin to sound so the question is who was that seventh angel also as we said before amen destructions trying to caught a strike a quarter in Malachi chapter 4 the last two verses God say he was gonna send me like to the Prophet we better find who is he who is he Elijah hallelujah let me go on a little further he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches of each age in every age it was the same cry hear what the Spirit says if you are a Christian you will get back to what the Spirit is teaching hallelujah a man hallelujah you say I've been to denominational Church and I felt the Spirit of God yeah God want to let you know he was with you now get out of there you wonder let you know he loved you now get out of there seekers come out of there might come out of her my people amen that's what the Bible saying there's a divorce croc calling come out my people not go in come out all right let's go on a little further it says you'll get back to what the Spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach that word here it is every fresh and true revival here's a characteristic every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age can I be both you ain't even have a no revival if you not fellowship around this word the fresh and true revival come because you've gotten back to the word for your age and we are we're with fellowship and around that this open revelation listen the crime every age is to rebuke you have left the Word of God repent and come back to the word from first book in the Bible Genesis 2 the last book revelation there's only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor and that's back to the world you know we were talking this morning to Sunday school thank you for the plug brother sermon god bless you I appreciate that plug amen but we were talking this morning Sunday school how you know there's many people that have taken on titles that actually go against the word all right they have titles in the church and it make them seem like they somebody a man they they take on this title and you know your mom's like like what's some of the titles that they're taking you know you got people that want to be apostle's well how you gonna be a pastor and you ain't never setup no church right you you've never set up one church but you want to run you want the title pasta does that make you feel like you somebody right you got you got now they don't even have deacons in the church no more they everybody's a pastor how can everybody be the pastor right well I got the pastor of this ministry in the past of that ministry and you know and we got we got all titles and you know what we have is a lot of chiefs of no Indians really words that's actually absolutely been abuse let me put it that way I want to say it like the spirits say people are built in God's Word Bishop and it's a woman claiming the title bishop now the reason she got that title because of how the man operates in that title so she want the same power equal Authority that that man has so she wouldn't be called bishop regardless of what the Bible say the Bible say the bishop got to be husband of one wife so what you got going on in the church if you got the women as bishops praise the Lord in a man it's time to come back to the world and the only way you don't have revival is you got to come back to the words [Applause] Jesus some characteristics of revived praise God this is for my people if my people which are called by hearing everybody's prayer like that but if my people which are called by my name hey everybody truth description trying to apply but that's why they revive us fizzle out we are in continuous revival we don't have to wait for no preacher to come because revival not the preacher don't have it in this Bible and all the preacher doing is adding to the environment it's already created and when you get himself by the way God begin to use them we just we just have a mighty time in the Lord but revival is going on before a preacher God yeah and when the preacher libre power still going on continuous revival stay with me here o prayer some of the other things that I think that would come and revival amen something that some of the attributes or characteristics you'll see prayer and fasting you know you remember Jesus a man was there it's coming down off the Alpha Mount Transfiguration in Matthew 17 and after he you know kind of reveal you know some thanks to the disciples and told him what was given to happen as far as his death was concerned here this man come running up to Jesus and they say you know my son is a lunatic could you please help them it's safe could you could you please do something for my Sunday night I took him to your disciples and and and they they just couldn't get this boy they couldn't get his problem solved I took him to the Sun Jesus a you know I mean Oh faith listen and and and our generation say bring the boy to me I'll do something fun and I believe that Amen when we've got true revival going we ought not to be afraid of any circumstance any situation bring bring the situation there we'll take care of it right so so Jesus I say bring the boy here and when you come there you know before Jesus and man he just had a fit you know and finally Jesus prayed for him and and the spirit left to me they even thought the boat was dead but but he just picked them up and raised them up and the boy went on his way in his right mind so the disciples came to Jesus apart came to him on the side they say now now now now our Jesus why couldn't we can't stop that different brother branham say the disciples the way there was approached to say made me feel the same I let me show y'all how it's done and then John say John say Peter you ain't getting no results let me show you how it's done and they need each one said no let me show you how to and nobody got no results so we say say say they say Jesus why can we get that bad boy can't they say first of all your unbelief is a problem that's the first problem your unbelief and then they say secondly amen this time goes out only by fasting and prayers hallelujah do you see we got to come back to that because that's just a simple characteristic if you want to see God move in the church you don't have to put some fasting and prayer behind it come on somebody you can have the you have the index of fasting and prayer hallelujah glory to God quote after quote after quote I can show you on fasting and prayer amen butBut that should be one that one of the the the characteristics of revival you should see fasting and prayer let me go on a little further you know now the Bible said here if my people were to cover my name shall humble themselves humble themselves humble themselves oh come on somebody another another way you've got see revivals people are gonna get humble not boastful humble themselves and I remember brother Branham making a statement say we're honest hearts can't admit that they're wrong this is where revival starts when people humble themselves and can admit Lord I'm wrong you know my you know I've seen it just over the years folk can be wrong and they know they wrong but they will go on like they never did don't do that don't let your heart get so hard that when God began to deal with you about your wrong that you just overlook it and just kind of keep going no humble yourself hallelujah when foking humble themselves then God can do something with them look at this they say when honest hearts can admit they're wrong that's the place where revival will start so amen that's another characteristic a man and and remember I said no minister can bring them revive the revivals coming by the people and every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age now this is one other little statement that I want to make here and this message Israel in the church because we also know that revival is the washing of the trash onto the shore is that right we know that's a characteristic of the revival the trash in your life should be washed up to the shore Oh glory amen God guarding you know when that brother brems he was out there looking at the water he said wasn't that any new water came in hallelujah he said wasn't any new water that came in he said but the water that was there just begin to have a little churn in and as that water begin attorney say what's going to say the trash that was inside the waters been washed up to the shore right that's a characteristic of revival we should see trash coming out of your life being washed up to the shore but I had to go get something for you because in order to preach the five characteristics of it I had to give you a quote that kind of set the balance on that statement so read let me read this Israel in the church don't just stop with just the washing of the trash on the shore there's no there's a little bit more let's look at this it says this he says the little old tabernacle I've been back many times an hour two or maybe four be in for service since this is my first time to come back or anywhere to try to hold a revival we're starting tonight a revival - my opinion doesn't consist of well bringing in new members that's not all it does it says a revival doesn't consist of a bunch of conversions and I love this statement although those things go along with a revival y'all stay with me on that one and don't don't consist of a bunch of conversions but it did say we convinced consist of none stay with amen amen revival doesn't consist of a bunch of convergence although those things are along with the revival but a revival is to revive what you already got just to get them revive revival is revived what you already got just to get them revived but not now he didn't say that it wouldn't be in a convergence because there will be something now I can talk about the five characteristics this quote is something that's going we're going to take our time with I'm going to list some things this is how to speak to the mountain and we're gonna take our time with this now look at listen to this now we're trying to place the revival just in the best setting that we can we do not what we call major own divine healing because divine healing is a minor and you cannot major on a minor we know that so the great thing that we've that were after for any revival the great thing that we're after for any revival is to bring lost souls to Christ first it might not be a lot of convergence but it's gonna be some so the first thing that we look for in the Reviver are lost souls being one the Christ you tell me I lost those being one to Christ did they happen in your church you in revival you are in revival you just got to know where the sign sign I lost souls being one the Christ even if it's only two that's so it might not be some great thing to hit the head but it's enough to let us know that we are here [Applause] praise God Church this is a characteristic when you see this you know where you're at lost souls lost souls to Christ first listen revive the church this is the second thing revive the church back into a spiritual condition we look for that so now that's something for the people that's already here and maybe not just the ones that's already here but people that know this truth and God want to revive you back to your spiritual condition hallelujah glory to God man obviously you know we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't kind of lost what our condition was so sometimes you have to go in church like you go to a doctor you know your doctor you get sick praise the Lord you get sick and you want to go to the doctor and have them check things out and you don't know why you feel in the way you feel praise God and you go to the doctor and the doctor a man he tell you to do something however he want to check your temperature he want to check your condition and he tell you just open your mouth and say ahh and he stick a look at the thermometer down there to kind of check your condition just check your temperature right and you're going through all these types of types of things and what the Holy Spirit is doing is dropping a spiritual thermometer into the midst of the people to check their condition they may and based on what the results of the thermometer is he know what what what to give you somebody based on the results of your spiritual thermometer the Holy Ghost know exactly what to give you hallelujah listen oh my gosh amen hey try a safe they say uh he says revive the church back into a spiritual condition the Spirit of God comes to do that it's said to where it should be then he goes on he said this is a third thing that shouldn't happen in revival there should be close communion with God close communion with God now I'm gonna tell you I'm just giving you the highlights but I'm gonna hit each one of these that's why I say I won't have time to do it all today but I may hit each one we're gonna go into each one but here first is lost souls to Christ second amen revive the church back into a spiritual condition third amen close communion with God hallelujah amen and then the fourth we'll look at this bring fellowship among the churches for revival supposed to bring fellowship among churches do not get oh how you're gonna call yourself in my bar only your church fellowship you don't never go to nobody else Church huh you won't go fellowship with nobody else you only go if your favorite preacher there huh that ain't revival come on somebody true revival with to to fellowship with other church acts now I'm gonna have to break that down for you and not every Church other churches not every Church cuz how can two walk together except they be agreed but here's another one and he says fellowship among other among churches 36 and forth pray for the sick so revivals supposed to produce prayer for the sick so that's our aim our tribe is Dennis verse fellowship with the churches a close walk with that with the Church of Church to God and then pray for the sick now I'm gonna break all those down because really what he said winning souls of Christ was number one he said the church restores right condition was number two then he said close communion with God was number three and then it said fellowship amongst other churches was number four and then he said prayer for six that prayer for the sick that's number five so there are five characteristics that should be a part of every Bible can I just talk about this prayer for the sick just for a little bit whoa hallelujah if we am revival then there should be some prayer for the sick now I remember a few weeks ago early the beginning of the year brother Trevor it come through and he preached a man on a sermon no one needs to know we're at brother westcoast church and he any preach see if we were a fellowship in with other churches missing all night fellas shipping with other truck could we Emory power that's what we do when we Emory Bible let me put it this way I'm in revival because when you're in revival these are five characteristics that go along with Irv out hallelujah your revival is not selfish huh if you really Reviver you want everybody to know yes praise God but we went there to brother westcoast church and brother Trevor preach the message no one needs to know and after that after the message was preached a prayer line was formed for those that were sin sick they were hiding things amen and and they just want to count exposed it that night so a prayer line came forth and those that were sensing walked into the prayer line and God begin to do something for them and I want to tell many of you that might have winning that prayer line and maybe after the prayer line you still feel that same devil attacking you if you were praying for keep confessing your healing don't base your healing on your feeling I want to see that again don't grace your healing or your feeling those feelings are subject to change when the devil attack to keep confessing God's Word over to over the top of that watch what God do for you so so if you were praying for that night keep confessing your healing after after those meetings we had a service here in January brother quake who preached and after he preached I felt led to call for a prayer line and a man after his sermon just some of the testimonies that he was sharing amen there in his sermon and we become fair prayer line and I guess a week or so later sister Michelle testified of her healing in that prayer line because when a revival a man has broken out there should be prayer for the sick hallelujah glory to God just last Sunday you heard a two testimonies one of Amen brother Caleb that coming bus say he was in church sick but all of a sudden the Spirit of God began to move in here and as he began to shout and jumping he run around saying that's my granddaddy and all kind of other things that brother Caleb got caught up in the spirit before you knew it the sickness was gone hallelujah you can praise your way out of a sickness you can shout your way out of trouble hallelujah you can worship your way out of that thing the devil services is to keep you out of the environment you stay home and feel sorry for yourself but when you get here you forget about how you feel Amen you forget about what the devil's trying to do you begin to enter into your own personal revival brother Caleb received his healing and we heard sister Amanda glory to God she testified nobody never even laid hands on her now you know that's Bible right the Centurion he stopped Jesus please don't come to the house he say he said I'm not worried that if you should come in he said but if you would just speak the word only my sermon to be made whole hallelujah right so so sometimes you might I mean in brother Branham even said he said if you really have faith he said you wouldn't even get in the prayer huh and I sister took God at His Word and we a cancer attacking her body all she felt what she felt condemned about is that she never told the doctor that I don't have it and God God would not let that thing lift off of her she had that nurse where I should at least or the doctor that I thought I should have confessed it out of my mouth and believe in my heart that's what I should've did it say and doctors begin the challenge of faith so when she went back to the doctor and the doctor saying I remember we went over this and we went over there and you got this you got that she said no I don't the doctor said wait a minute you don't lost your mind said no I ain't got it just like what you mean you ain't got some I'm just telling you I used to but I ain't got it no more and she spoke it by faith not know what what the results would be and the doctor taught what she was doing since the man didn't even realize what she was doing the doctors say oh you you you you you claiming it exactly I'm claiming my healing I'm cleaning my deliverance [Applause] - for the devil's package he sent me a box of rattlesnakes I'm sending it back to where it come from people which are called by my name his name but he said he say he will heal the land supposed to be healed if you are his person one of his people his price okay you claim in and say yeah I'm claiming it that's where she say she's saying the name of Jesus I ain't got it alright okay alright you say you ain't got you claiming that's fine we gonna do these tests anyway do your tests I ain't got it and you know what may her happy the thing that made her rejoice is that she left the doctor's office knowing that she told the doctor what God had put in her heart to tell the doctors telling you ain't God she said it she went on home and then here a day or so go by and they call up and say ya got the results of your test yes just want to let you know uh-huh you ain't got it sometimes the miracles of God can become so common to us as its people that we can just say oh you just found that out I told you that when I was dead that I didn't have it and now you called me to let me know what I already told you yeah thank you ain't got it you ought to tell it to the divine got that whatever you tryin to put on your revival produced these things but it didn't start just with sister Amanda y'all know that right we've been in revival y'all remember sister turn your testimony and it wasn't just you know the way god this is a target is that he allowed it to grow so we can get a picture of it and if you doubt it if you don't believe this happened we gonna show you the picture he'd go befo and he'd go after after prayer was made by sister she have it no more either cancer disappeared but you remember the same night sister tangles briefer since the birds was free for she was barely able to walk she had cramps in the legs amen but after prayer that night she went to the hospital now I mean to the airport the next day she was walking like it was nothing she said she had the best sleep she'd ever had in days because God heal every Bible grant for the sick occurs I'm not done few weeks ago we was here and brother Dwayne Oh on that Saturday night call for a prayer line and I actually don't even know if he called for it but I saw different ones coming up to be prayed for and you know what blessed me preachers Reacher's got underneath that anointing and walked up into the prayer line not to pray for somebody but to be brief or whether they would be grateful for themselves I'm standing in the gap for somebody else their faith had been elevated because we're revival palms that is one of the attributes or characteristics of it you know the devil student you there and like don't go up there am I talking to somebody you know how to devil do you don't go up there you know they're gonna know this thing when the devil doing that what he's trying to do is keep you bound y'all ain't got it he wants to keep you bound and the way that you get free because the Bible say they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover can I read a few scriptures I mean if we do things according to the word his people which are called by his name humble themselves pray seek my face say then you'll hear from heaven do things according to his word watch what he does we're already in this we're not waiting for this to come is it it's been here for years Oh glory to God amen let me read you James 5 14 through 16 glory to God James 5 14 through 16 look at this it says is any sick among you let me just stop here I heard a prayer request go for it was there somebody in this church getting ready to have surgery okay all right all right praise look anybody in this church gonna have surgery before you let them doctors touch you would you let us pray for you amen before you let the doctors touchy let us briefly you know sometime they leave stuff inside of people and it create more problems you know it take faith for you to put your life in the hands of a doctor it takes faith then people got problems just like you sometimes worse man why you think someone want to start surgery later in the day because what they was doing the night before alright it's the truth anyhow amen and I wouldn't want no drunk man coming to touch me cut what all right is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them let them pray over him that's the elders of church and you know elder the churches is it's a person that seasoned in the gospel name just got here yesterday they don't see in God healed a few people and they can give you some testimonies amen elder the church let him call for the elders of church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord look at this in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall not maybe will the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so you can't have everybody praying for you hallelujah you want righteous footprint please a man you can't share your businesses everybody either you share it right to spoon hello somebody some folks tell you take your business all over town hey man you keep it with righteous spoon they don't have to guard it all right now all right Church listen mark 16 let's read this this is this is what this is for his people not people which are called by my name listen mark 16 verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe look at this in my name you better know his name you better know his name I don't know how people can pray in his name but not get baptized in his name cast out Devils in his name but not get baptized in its name say it and look when you when the devil is real in your trail you are not saying no in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost you ain't never said nothing like that you know you know not to say not like that you know not to say I mean you and you got to know him I mean to to call him you got to know but when you're in trouble in the name of Jesus you can't even get Jesus Christ of Nazareth you can't in the name of Jesus the devil know who you talking about in the book of Acts Jesus we know Paul we know but who are you they know Jesus so when you use it in the name of Jesus like I've told you that man going down in that plane y'all heard it on Instagram I felt here I gonna sit in both languages that he knew in the name of Jesus just in case you didn't hear me and ain't no brain to his name and you gonna call in his name like that then you need to be baptized in its name praise God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ even if you have been baptized once before you need to be rebaptised the right way in the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah that's what they told him acts 19 is that right okay let's go on it says this these signs probably might believe in my name shall they cast out they shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover let me read you one more Psalms 103 Kassir avaiable revival this is one of the characteristics prayer for the sick is a part of revival hallelujah Psalms 103 verse 1 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name I could see David just pause why he's thinking about it when he's writing this down then say bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits so when you a full-time worker you get benefits you serving God on a full-time basis there's some benefits that go with that right part-time people don't get benefits [Music] you can go to the HR office all you want to there is no card for you no override you got to pay for that out of your pocket but if you want to go full-time so bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity I don't care what you've done God say he forgive it all oh I feel good I feel feel like a man tree preaching brother brother Nathan do you have a a broke I mean a bruised vessel do you have a metal vessel that that maybe a little damaged do you have a vet so that needs some tending to do what kind of vessel to your hat because he said he saying say it don't matter whether it's bruised so whether it's a little damaged long it is not broken and it's not seeping out it's made a question is is the vessel empty because it is empty bring it God will fulfill it again hallelujah God can you show empty vessel who forgiveth all thine iniquities and I love this david says who healeth not some of them but everything that's attack your body God says he heals all your diseases he says who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles you see I just just wanted to just share you know when we are in revival there should be prayer for the sick few years ago we had a prayer line here brother Nathan came and you all remember brother Jeff a man was not able to see out of both his eyes he was losing outside and got restored one of his one of his eyes you all remember a man my um my wife's uncle a man he was unable to drive and unable to eat but after prayer that night he received strength in his body and it restored his appetite and he's a new man today and when you go around testify they always tell people I went to that church that night and God did something for me glory to God you all remember a man brother Rodney who came from Washington DC just visiting his cousin had a little growth on his arm here amen a little something going on there a little sister on his arm and say when he win it when he when he come through the prayer line he was bringing somebody else here but when he come through the prayer line God but I mean the Holy Spirit touched him and that sis was gone before he left church revival when you are in revival prayer for the sick occurs and we're not just praying for the sick we expected the sick to be healed let me finish this today I want to talk about I didn't do him in order I just didn't order way the Holy Spirit gave me because brother Branham gave us five things he says winning souls to Christ was first the church restores to his right condition close communing with God fellowship amongst other churches and pray for the sick and I started with prayer for the sick but I want to go to winning souls for Christ if we in revival in Souls I supposed to be one for Christ y'all tell me when I see brother Jerry we in revival right brother Jerry last week winning got his brother and brought Ishmael in last week when we went to the sister church service Ishmael came to the altar when Ishmael came to the altar Ishmael said I felt fire going down my back what was the sermon last week let the fire fall Ishmael said I felt you tell me you tell me whether it's revival or not it's not gonna hit the headlines but it's happening [Music] in brother Jared come yeah this hair wrapped having a little man but I think so just sitting over there just looking at watch the circle you don't think nothing going on he just he just see it made it all full services right yeah all full serve just sitting there and during the week nobody told Jerry but it's over the Mike so yeah I need to go get a haircut Oh told him go get a haircut I need to go get my haircut brother Mike and then I know that they went brother Mike wouldn't take him out to eat and Rosa might was get ready eat that sticker sheet one for the juicy shouldn't we pray [Applause] you tell me whether that's revival or not I'm gonna give him a haircut and I want to pray over my move my meal all this hair that's the same brother yeah and see and I got toyou last week he put himself in the word because a man not supposed to wear long hair a woman is a woman not supposed to cut her hair and a man is supposed to cut his hair a man Church you know the Bible say that right woman is not supposed to cut her hair amen if you cut it just trim it a little bit then you know it a girl healthy you know trim is yeah you have a trim like your hedges I'm talking about house you ever took a trim right on the hedges they've been cut so if you trim your hedges and has been cut when you trim your sisters not supposed to do that according to the Bible right no no people like I say people that got away from God's Word and now they do whatever they want to do but God's mercy it a certain way and all the way you gonna have revivals when you come back to the world with the brother in here you know and before brother Jerry King brother Paul came on a Wednesday night and they told us that heaven rejoices when one sinner repents yeah one seller repents heaven start rejoicing and here come brother Jerry just walking right into all this didn't even know man you just stay faithful brother Jerry got something [Applause] you want to know why the devil unlike brother Mike cuz he can affect people so the delicate brother Mike defeated he know he already know okay he he won't be able to take brother Jerry to church he won't be able to take brother Ishmael to church BJ won't come to church if I can get brother Mike well you say nothing you can't have me not you can't have him either I'm claiming I'm claiming them all you hang with me things gonna change what's your brother named Mike Mike brought them all just load up the church hallelujah thank God for that brother my name Amen got a bless you for it my brother I'll let brother Mike got do y'all get somebody and bring them to church and that just saw another young sister here this morning that's revival revival got the feel it just know it giving you the sponge giving you the size.i all right this I got to read this don't close right here this is out of the message inside man the inside man so you would like to know what I think the greatest need of the church today what I think is lacking is no soul travail the people are not broke up enough there's no bird and seemingly and you give me someone that just so tore up about lost souls that they can think they just cry and our warmth and revive us so bad so they can hardly eat just simply can't I've seen people coming here get toe up over these the sins of a loved ones just messed up God please deliver we had that that corporate prayer here in my what an experience in this place right and just just even I know for the brothers one of the things that's been on our prayer list is we're praying for two to two people backsliders and we're also praying for those that have walked away from this word we won't let that go every time we come here God don't hear that coming out of our mouth God sent him God bring him you know what if I was in their shoes if the roles was reversed I want somebody praying for me God the devil is a liar my brother my sister father please God and we keep that thing before God weekend and week out we keep it before God said we're not he gonna answer we seek we gonna find a man listen he says if you read the history of the world and the religious history you'll find out it always taking that kind of a spirit to bring a revival the interval of soul spirit to bring a revival that's right when Zion prevail or traveled I think a better word see when Zion travailed or Zion travel so when you're in prayer you need to travel your prayer should elevate you your prayer I mean see once you get a real you catch the burden for your brother and sister even I don't have the quote but I remember the brand I'm saying even if somebody's done you wrong and as you begin to pray for that person he said when you get them to the prison guard you can't even think about the wrong that they did you start feeling sorry for the person that's when you begin to travel when you begin to travail in prayer when Zion travailed or travel I think it's a better word then she brought forth children see you have to be tore up it's the atmosphere of anything you get around where there's arguments come on church listen you get into that type of atmosphere if there if there's something in the church someone who's disobedient and very ugly acting in the church and causing trouble you'll never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of an atmosphere is around that's why you gotta watch yourself you don't have to respond to everything a man Church sometimes it let it pass right a man because you know it's gonna create the wrong atmosphere listen he said you say that kind of atmosphere around and so you have to have everybody and if you'll notice when the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost they were all in one place and in one Accord is that right and waiting for a promise and when we get like that brother Bose the revival will be here then that's right we got to be in one mile and one Accord in the same place we'll see God do great things I want to read this last quote out of questions and answers part one don't have the wrong attitude don't have the wrong spirit travail of soul as we think about different I mean the reason that we're still here is because somebody somebody is not breaking out who you are in Christ and once they come to a knowledge of that you know my god it won't be long Church you know one of the other things I think revival see we might get lost you know some lost souls we might get some people restore it with me and you might even see some you know just new people just kind I think anytime you see new faces in a congregation it revives the congregation that's another characteristic right you get new faces people drawn to your church praise the Lord come on I have to be honest with myself I've been in church some time and I actually I didn't want to invite people I actually didn't want to invite them to my church because I didn't know what would be said don't know what the whole I don't know what they gonna do can I be honest I'm afraid to invite folk to church see as we mature you know you get to the point they oh wait a minute right all right all right we work with things we work with people right where they are learn to work with people right where they are and i'ma tell you right now if they come from the world they gonna be messed up because they have not been influenced by the word but when you get here you get underneath the influence of the word then things begin to change praise God questions and answers part one the Prophet says this he says now look if this church if I say this morning in this little group of people it says if God was saying if God would be speaking to the Prophet God would say now look William Branham I'm gonna make you answer for that group of people what'd you tell them now do you want them all to shower sure I want them to shout do you want them all to speak with tongues I want every one of them to look what the prophets say I want everyone in them to do you want them all to dance in the spirit like we was dancing on that Sunday night I want every one of them to alright well that's very good but what could what would you rather have them do huh huh I'd rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer that they just stayed at this altar and with be here day and night and everything else and in their house was constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to God and making calls at the hospital and visiting the sick and trying to get people to come to church do and do right I'd rather have that than all the other put together although the other is right it belongs in the church but if I if I had to have it I put that first because if you got that the other will take place we got travail a soul do you know you you you'll start shouting when you see your friend get free you get so kind of wrapped up you start wanting to speak in tongues you just let it you have this release of the let it go when you see God do something somebody else it excites you remember heaven rejoices just when one sinner repents what you think of happening if you see your brother sister restored when you see your prayer answers that right before your very eyes you think that will make you wanna shout sohow travail a soul more than anything else hallelujah and you know we we know you sometimes you know now that there's some serious Pierce if you're dealing with so sometimes you know you might talk to a person they just don't want to hear just nothing you can do as far as talking but you can keep praying don't stop praying God can change anybody's heart and I'm expecting him to do that revival occurs these are some of the attributes or characteristics of it so I I'm looking for it all right he says he goes on to say if you got that if you just get so hungry for God shout and will take place if you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place you got so hunger for God just keep on hungry and keep yourself now you go you go to seeing yourself getting indifferent just remember look out there's another spirit trying to work itself in there stay right before God humbled with travail of soul just be all that good old-fashioned he goes on and says I can prove by the Bible that the first time the end of God went over the lands the seal with the Holy Ghost he only sealed those who cry inside for the abominations done in the city Ezekiel of knife chapter is that right set a seal upon the forehead of those who sigh and cry for the abominations that done the city now if you go back and read is if you're not it was destruction getting ready to settle amen upon the city there and before destruction the angel was what was commissioned go seal those that are praying seal those in a silent crying and I mentioned last last week when we read out of Revelation 8 before destruction God was gonna pour out fire a man into his congregation just like he gave fire to Isiah he wants to give fire to his people and what aspire to do it cleanses all the sin out of my life listen she said it's still upon the forehead of those who sign cry for the abominations of our nation that's done the city now I want to ask you a question I ask you this question now we'll close just as quick as I can what would take place today if the Holy Ghost went through Jefferson Building of New Albany I want to say West Palm Beach Jeffersonville new Avenue Louisville West Palm Beach to seal those this afternoon who would be at home God sent a revival just so hungry for a meeting Oh God look at the sins of this city oh isn't it terrible God oh won't you please send a revival God send some good preachers send someone Oh Lord let the Holy Ghost where would he seal think of that and I believe a man that certainly we have started with some of the prayer meetings we're doing you know we're doing some great things but we all know we can do better in some other areas Amen we can keep praying keep their prayer well turning don't let that don't let up on don't let up on it and and and I believe prayers was actually produced some of the results that we're seeing now and I believe prayers what's gonna take us on I rather be caught prayin didn't doing anything else I rather if the Lord was gonna return let him catch me in a prayer meeting let him catch me in a premie don't catch me on the basketball court no it's catch me in a prayer me did you see me break his ankle nothing to do with Jesus hallelujah Lord catch me in a prayer me catch me right here doing what I need to do having sold travail seeing soles worn to the Lord this is a characteristic a revival remember five characteristics I only got through two of them today one was winning souls of Christ to church restored to its right condition I'm coming to that next week close communion with God I'll do that next week but next time I preach next week we're gonna have we're gonna have brother Quaker speech a man but when I come back to preach again I'll pick this up another's fellowship amongst sister churches and pray for the sick these are characteristics that we should see when there's a revival let's pray musicians if you would come father God we thank you for this word that you have given us your prophet that you sent to us true revival will only come when the people have gotten back to the word and the only people that can come back to the word are your people this is why you could right there in Scripture if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways said you were here from heaven you said you would heal the land father my prayer is that his revival fires continue to burn in his church that we would see all the characteristics that you have shown us through your prophet that they will all be manifested here we're already seeing it Lord but may they continue to manifest help us to come into one mind it's a one accord that your spirit would have the preeminence in this place every gift that you have called for the body would be released into the people all according to order of the scripture father we believe in that we're believing captives would be set free we believe in the bound will be delivered we believe in the sick will be healed God we believe in God for the impossible so we thank you look for what we see you doing this is your this is this is marvelous in our eyes thank you Lord for reviving a man of what the washing the trash out onto the shore they're the things that are in our lives look we're coming back the spiritual to the thermometer is being checked thank God you're giving us the right vitamins that we need God to bring ourselves back in position and the only reason you do this is because you love us when we have showed you that we didn't love you the way we thought we did you have demonstrated to us that you loved us regardless God how we appreciate you let us be found Lord in your presence let us be found doing the things that would please you in this hour God we are asked all of this in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen editor save Lord Frieza I'm sure if

revive a fire the winds of change is taking place you know weakly we're in a real valuable but you notice that everything is under an anointing you know the Bible said as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so Charlotte deep and we just ended here this past couple of weeks may I'd say this was Pride and they all anointed I've known about a devil to get out death they just bringing the word into full view everything has got to come into its place so the devil is coming into this place they all ever loved not anointed to do what they're gonna do but see the gospel is moving on and everybody's coming into their place amen we're in a revival hey Matt you love the Lord amen we're not going for a longer time amen Oh as we prepare ourselves to leave and may remember the
