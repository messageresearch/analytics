[1:03:23] praise the Lord if we could just turn to
[1:03:24] our Bibles I'm gonna go ahead let the
[1:03:26] musicians go and my brother already
[1:03:29] called me out on how bad I started off
[1:03:31] singing last night I know I was flat I
[1:03:33] was nervous and I never claimed I could
[1:03:36] sing my besaid make a joyful noise we
[1:03:41] can all agree it was a noise I trust you
[1:03:44] understand it was joyful and so I
[1:03:47] realized you guys aren't afraid to call
[1:03:49] somebody out if they start flat if
[1:03:51] they're in the cracks and get the wrong
[1:03:54] key so I'll just wait till maybe if
[1:03:56] we're gonna sing we'll do it at the end
[1:03:58] I mean I finished my case Matthew
[1:04:07] chapter 10 I'm gonna be reading verses
[1:04:09] 40 to 41 I would like to say what a
[1:04:13] wonderful privilege it is to be together
[1:04:15] with you and it's been it's just been a
[1:04:19] tremendous blessing we first met brother
[1:04:22] Jack in 2018 in Lima Ohio and we just
[1:04:25] were immediately impressed with his
[1:04:27] humility and certainly recognized the
[1:04:30] gift in his life whether it be in
[1:04:32] singing and then preaching and just
[1:04:34] really really admired it and felt just a
[1:04:36] quick connection with he and his wife
[1:04:37] and I purposed in my heart when I met
[1:04:40] him I want to stay in fellowship with
[1:04:41] this brother and so we've just tried to
[1:04:43] keep in touch by way of text messaging
[1:04:46] and maybe a couple phone calls and when
[1:04:48] the invitation was extended to come and
[1:04:50] minister I hope it didn't come off the
[1:04:52] wrong way but I think I just said yes
[1:04:54] immediately didn't even say I need to
[1:04:55] pray about it I just felt like I believe
[1:04:57] that's God's will
[1:04:59] and so we're really really happy to be
[1:05:02] in fellowship and it's been quite some
[1:05:04] time maybe we've been a fellowship with
[1:05:06] some of the people here but brother
[1:05:07] smiley and I I say I think we go back to
[1:05:10] another millenium because I might have
[1:05:11] met him in the late 90s or early 2000s
[1:05:14] and then just to be back in fellowship
[1:05:15] again this many years later is wonderful
[1:05:18] and if where our paths don't cross much
[1:05:21] just I want you to know we love you and
[1:05:23] I would think if that's the number one
[1:05:26] thing we try to convey when we Minister
[1:05:28] is that the word is first lift up the
[1:05:31] word of God give honor to the glory of
[1:05:33] God and just preach the word not
[1:05:35] personality or politics or opinion and
[1:05:39] but the second thing I certainly would
[1:05:40] want to come across and that is that we
[1:05:42] genuinely love you
[1:05:43] you really really do and we just didn't
[1:05:45] want to encourage you and express our
[1:05:48] thanks for you and my families enjoyed
[1:05:50] themselves this weekend and and we're
[1:05:53] probably going to sing all the way home
[1:05:54] and practice on practice on getting our
[1:05:59] voices real fat at certain times and and
[1:06:02] I love when you can worship just making
[1:06:04] a sound I like that already just it's a
[1:06:13] it's an unknown melody in your heart you
[1:06:15] just want to express praise and so I
[1:06:18] enjoy I enjoy worship like that my
[1:06:20] family loves to sing and it's really my
[1:06:22] my wife she's the real singer my
[1:06:24] daughter Eliza grace can really really
[1:06:26] sing she's got some good pipes and so
[1:06:29] maybe we'll practice so if we ever do
[1:06:30] come back that's not a pathetic attempt
[1:06:33] at an imitation but maybe we'll have our
[1:06:36] the family sing and I do I do want to
[1:06:40] send greetings to you from our church I
[1:06:42] bring greetings to you from Hickory
[1:06:43] Bible Tabernacle there in Hickory North
[1:06:45] Carolina so I'm in the South now and no
[1:06:49] longer living in Texas but we bring
[1:06:51] greetings to you especially from brother
[1:06:52] Barry Coffey to you and your wife and to
[1:06:54] brother Danny and your wife there's
[1:06:55] special greetings from brother Barry
[1:06:57] sister Becky the greetings with much
[1:06:59] love from North Carolina to you and
[1:07:01] we're so happy to be here we love you
[1:07:03] Matthew chapter 10 verse 43 to verse 42
[1:07:07] he that receiveth you receiveth me and
[1:07:10] he that receiveth
[1:07:12] me receiveth him that sent me he that
[1:07:16] receiveth the prophet and the name of a
[1:07:18] prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward
[1:07:20] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[1:07:23] in the name of a righteous man shall
[1:07:26] receive a righteous man's reward and
[1:07:28] whosoever shall give to drink until one
[1:07:30] of these little ones a cup of cold water
[1:07:33] only in the name of a disciple verily I
[1:07:36] say unto you he shall in no wise lose
[1:07:38] his reward let's bow our heads our
[1:07:41] gracious Heavenly Father it's wonderful
[1:07:43] to be in such a precious atmosphere Lord
[1:07:45] whether it's just joy and the people's
[1:07:47] hearts and it's been wonderful to have
[1:07:49] been in these services thus far and with
[1:07:52] such a mighty move of your presence this
[1:07:54] morning it might even seem in some ways
[1:07:57] carnal just how could it even go further
[1:08:00] how can it go any higher but Lord we
[1:08:02] believe if you would have us together
[1:08:03] again
[1:08:04] you would desire to improve upon and
[1:08:06] take us deeper so lord with the release
[1:08:09] that we have on our spirits the newness
[1:08:11] that we're experiencing the washing of
[1:08:13] the water the word that we've had to
[1:08:15] these few days
[1:08:15] we pray that you could do something
[1:08:17] special for us tonight as we sit at your
[1:08:20] table once again desiring to feast is
[1:08:22] iron to see your face so I commit this
[1:08:24] time to you designed that you have the
[1:08:26] preeminence for your glory and your
[1:08:28] glory alone and for your Brides benefit
[1:08:30] and the name Lord is Christ we pray amen
[1:08:33] you may be seated I would like to
[1:08:38] express before I continue just how much
[1:08:40] I appreciated the ministry of the word
[1:08:42] of our brother Danny it was it was just
[1:08:46] tremendous and I believe it was worth
[1:08:48] every effort for myself personally to
[1:08:50] have been in these two services on
[1:08:51] Saturday morning and Sunday morning and
[1:08:53] I believe the Lord did something really
[1:08:55] really special to me for it for me and I
[1:08:58] thank God that I was in these services
[1:09:00] to sit under the preaching of the word
[1:09:02] and to hear the word preached it just
[1:09:05] really really did something special for
[1:09:07] me I believe I'm leaving here a changed
[1:09:09] man and just and I thank God for that
[1:09:12] and it's the word that does that it's in
[1:09:14] and I'm thankful for him as we read in
[1:09:17] the in the scripture you can see that
[1:09:19] Jesus is saying be speaking of things
[1:09:22] being given and received and it begins
[1:09:24] to speak about receiving a
[1:09:26] often receiving a Prophet's reward
[1:09:28] receiving a righteous man receiving a
[1:09:30] righteous man's reward and then also in
[1:09:32] giving a cup of water to a little one in
[1:09:36] the name of a disciple he says he shall
[1:09:38] no wise lose his reward and I want to
[1:09:40] minister on the reward of Malachi for
[1:09:43] the reward of Malachi form and brother
[1:09:46] branham makes this statement each
[1:09:47] message to each age holds out an
[1:09:50] incentive to the believer encouraging
[1:09:53] him to be an overcomer and thereby be
[1:09:56] rewarded of the Lord and so every age
[1:10:00] has a message and then each message to
[1:10:03] that age not only just carries with it
[1:10:05] information or or something to heed to
[1:10:08] or something to obey or to understand or
[1:10:11] to know each message actually carries
[1:10:13] with it judgment that if you don't heed
[1:10:15] what is being spoken it brings a curse
[1:10:17] it brings a judgment it's a detriment to
[1:10:19] not hear it or receive it and just by by
[1:10:22] virtue or the fact that there's a
[1:10:24] judgment or condemnation in not
[1:10:26] receiving the message it also carries
[1:10:28] with it a blessing something to be
[1:10:30] gained or benefited from it and brother
[1:10:32] Branham says each message to each age
[1:10:34] holds out an incentive to the believer
[1:10:36] so there's an incentive that comes with
[1:10:39] the message it says encouraging him to
[1:10:41] be an overcomer and in being an
[1:10:43] overcomer be rewarded of the Lord so in
[1:10:47] every age there was a reward for the
[1:10:49] elect who heard the message that was
[1:10:52] ordained unto them and received it so
[1:10:55] where there's a message there's a reward
[1:10:56] where there's something spoken of God
[1:10:59] there's a benefit in receiving it so a
[1:11:01] message of God anytime God brings a
[1:11:03] message there's a blessing in the
[1:11:05] message and an incentive it's the
[1:11:07] expectation of reward that motivates an
[1:11:11] effort or inspires your action so he
[1:11:14] says each message holds an incentive to
[1:11:16] the believer then as an incentive
[1:11:18] there's an expectation of a reward so it
[1:11:21] actually motivates your efforts or
[1:11:23] inspires your action so when brother
[1:11:26] Branham uses this language and it might
[1:11:28] seem counterproductive and it might seem
[1:11:30] well you shouldn't necessarily encourage
[1:11:32] people that way but God's not afraid to
[1:11:35] give you an incentive
[1:11:36] and it may not work in raising children
[1:11:39] just because and the basic reason is
[1:11:41] your kids get your nature and so if they
[1:11:45] have your nature and get your nurture
[1:11:47] they're not going to turn out right so
[1:11:49] but if you can nurture them with the
[1:11:51] nurture of the Lord and the admonition
[1:11:52] of the Lord then you could take that
[1:11:54] nature and preserve it to a place where
[1:11:56] they can receive a new nature and we
[1:11:58] don't necessarily give incentives to our
[1:12:00] kids if you do this I'll give you that
[1:12:02] if you do this I'll give you that then
[1:12:04] they're only motivated by the incentive
[1:12:05] and usually what you want to do is
[1:12:07] reward good behavior but God having
[1:12:10] confidence in his seed confidence in the
[1:12:12] elect he actually holds out an incentive
[1:12:14] and says if you do this I will give you
[1:12:17] this not just rewarding you but telling
[1:12:19] you beforehand that if you're faithful
[1:12:22] if you receive if you believe there's a
[1:12:24] benefit that comes so he desires to
[1:12:27] motivate you or inspire you to act and
[1:12:29] brother Bentham writes in the church age
[1:12:31] book all too little time is spent on
[1:12:33] laboring for the eternal rewards of God
[1:12:36] the recompense of God is too lightly
[1:12:39] esteemed so there's there's a lesson in
[1:12:43] this that we spend too little time
[1:12:45] laboring for the eternal rewards of God
[1:12:48] and he says because his reward his
[1:12:51] recompense is too lightly esteemed and
[1:12:54] it's amazing the number of things that
[1:12:56] people will do when there's a rewards
[1:12:58] program how did you get $10,000 into
[1:13:03] credit card debt I got a point for every
[1:13:05] dollar I spend because the rewards that
[1:13:08] are involved with it and you go to a
[1:13:11] grocery store and you shop there and you
[1:13:12] give them your number because they give
[1:13:14] you points they give you rewards and and
[1:13:16] if you do that you get so much back and
[1:13:18] people can obsess about rewards and
[1:13:20] points and and incentivizing things and
[1:13:22] gaming things like well now I'm
[1:13:24] accumulating I'm gathering and people be
[1:13:26] so strict and disciplined because the
[1:13:28] reward that comes with it and listen
[1:13:30] chase has got nothing on God's reward
[1:13:33] program
[1:13:34] people want to know what's in your
[1:13:36] wallet the capital one got nothing
[1:13:39] nothing on God's rewards program because
[1:13:43] he is faithful and we spend too little
[1:13:45] time laboring for his eternal rewards we
[1:13:48] lightly esteemed the recompense of God
[1:13:50] and this tells us we ought to not
[1:13:52] lightly esteem it but highly a statement
[1:13:54] we ought to spend more time laboring for
[1:13:57] his eternal rewards why we could just
[1:14:00] spend time in revelations chapter 2 in
[1:14:01] Chapter three looking at how there's a
[1:14:03] reward for the overcomer and if there's
[1:14:07] a reward it means it carries with it if
[1:14:10] there's a reward there must be a labor
[1:14:12] there's going to be a reward there must
[1:14:15] be an effort there must be a labor and
[1:14:17] where there's a labor there's always
[1:14:18] going to be an opposition listen you got
[1:14:22] a job to do and the devil wants to stop
[1:14:25] you from doing him so we work in we wor
[1:14:28] we got a hammer in one hand and a sword
[1:14:31] and the other and as long as we stay on
[1:14:34] task and keep working then that's a
[1:14:36] battle that we can win and so we know
[1:14:39] that there's opposition there's reproach
[1:14:41] there's going to be difficulty and so
[1:14:43] there's labour there's opposition to
[1:14:45] that labor it's difficult to do it
[1:14:46] there's a reproach that comes with it
[1:14:48] but there's a reward that comes to the
[1:14:50] overcomer reward is something that is
[1:14:53] granted after reaching a goal after
[1:14:55] you've exerted labor after you've passed
[1:14:57] a test you receive a reward I passed the
[1:14:59] test as a reward
[1:15:00] I've exerted myself there's a reward or
[1:15:02] benefit I've reached the goal there's a
[1:15:04] reward that comes with it and that's
[1:15:06] what the Scripture speaks of when
[1:15:07] there's a reward it's something that's
[1:15:09] granted after meeting the mark and kind
[1:15:11] and reaching a goal says in Hebrews
[1:15:15] chapter 12 and again just stay with me
[1:15:17] as we just build our case and add these
[1:15:19] things we're speaking about the reward
[1:15:20] of Malachi for him Hebrews chapter 12
[1:15:23] verses 1 to 3 wherefore seeing we also
[1:15:25] are compassed about with so great a
[1:15:28] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:15:30] every weight and the sin which doth so
[1:15:33] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:15:35] patience the race that is set before us
[1:15:38] so we have a race to run and if there's
[1:15:41] a race there's a finish line and it's
[1:15:43] not so much who gets there first but
[1:15:45] it's how you
[1:15:45] Paul said labor that you may obtain so
[1:15:48] there's a way that you labor there's a
[1:15:50] way that you run it's not just he who
[1:15:51] finishes but it's he who runs correctly
[1:15:53] and he who finishes correctly so we got
[1:15:56] to run the race that is set before us
[1:15:58] each one finishing their course says
[1:16:01] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:16:03] finisher of our faith if he started it
[1:16:06] he'll finish it God's always going to
[1:16:08] finish what he started a lot of us we
[1:16:11] tweet we write checks we can't cash we
[1:16:14] talk things and we can't back it up
[1:16:16] God's going to finish what he started
[1:16:18] he's gonna do it that's the kind of God
[1:16:20] he is he'll finish it and so here he's
[1:16:23] saying that Jesus is the author and
[1:16:25] finisher of our faith now we're looking
[1:16:27] at him how he started and how he
[1:16:29] finishes who for the joy that was set
[1:16:31] before him endured the cross despising
[1:16:34] the shame and is set down at the right
[1:16:37] hand of the throne of God so he had a
[1:16:39] race that he had to run and he says
[1:16:42] being the author and finisher this is
[1:16:44] how he ran it was for the joy that was
[1:16:46] set before him it may not have been
[1:16:48] joyous for the moment might have been
[1:16:50] not been deriving much pleasure in the
[1:16:52] moment but there was a joy that was set
[1:16:54] before him and I'd take great a great
[1:16:56] lesson from this because brother Branham
[1:16:58] says how can I prove my love to him by
[1:17:00] conducting myself with joy in the midst
[1:17:03] of the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:17:05] allows to come to pass
[1:17:06] now there's something we've got to
[1:17:08] remember about this I want to walk this
[1:17:10] way because I think you all get left out
[1:17:11] because of all these instruments over
[1:17:13] here but when he says that we must
[1:17:15] conduct ourselves with joy in the midst
[1:17:18] of the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:17:19] allows to come to pass that doesn't mean
[1:17:22] we sit back and try to figure out which
[1:17:24] ones are in his wisdom every trial he
[1:17:30] has in his wisdom allowed to come to
[1:17:32] pass so you don't have a right to sit
[1:17:35] there and go well I just don't think
[1:17:36] this one was his wisdom so I don't have
[1:17:38] to cook myself a joy every trial that he
[1:17:41] allows delet to go through it's in his
[1:17:44] wisdom that he allows you to go through
[1:17:45] it so through every single trial every
[1:17:49] single trial you must conduct yourself
[1:17:52] with joy believing that this is God's
[1:17:54] wisdom
[1:17:55] I go through it I said well it's very
[1:17:59] hard to be joyful when these things come
[1:18:00] it's very hard when there's persecution
[1:18:02] very hard when there's death it's very
[1:18:04] hard when there's loss but then you've
[1:18:06] got to think about how Jesus did it
[1:18:07] there might not have seemed to be much
[1:18:09] joy within with him at that time but it
[1:18:11] was the joy which was set before him and
[1:18:13] as a believer we have a joy that is set
[1:18:16] before us and it's that joy I'm gonna
[1:18:18] conduct myself with it may not seem good
[1:18:21] at the time it may not seem joyous now
[1:18:23] but I know as a believer in this there's
[1:18:25] good who for the joy that was set before
[1:18:31] him endured the cross despising the
[1:18:33] shame so he says for consider him that
[1:18:35] endured such contradiction of sinners
[1:18:38] against himself lest ye be wearied and
[1:18:41] faint in your minds so he's he's telling
[1:18:47] us that the joy that is before us the
[1:18:49] reward is what keeps you from fainting
[1:18:52] because the trial itself it doesn't seem
[1:18:55] to bring much it doesn't bring the
[1:18:57] benefit or blessing and the things that
[1:18:59] you're experiencing what you're going
[1:19:00] through but there's something that comes
[1:19:02] with it something that's to precede it
[1:19:04] something that God's going to bring out
[1:19:05] of it and it's the end result that gives
[1:19:07] you the courage to go through it Hebrews
[1:19:10] 11 verses 24 to 26 by faith Moses when
[1:19:13] he was come to years refused to be
[1:19:16] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:19:17] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:19:20] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:19:22] pleasures of sin for a season now how
[1:19:25] could someone choose to suffer
[1:19:27] affliction instead enjoy the pleasures I
[1:19:31] mean when it said it's not because Moses
[1:19:34] loved the pain he wasn't yeah I'd like
[1:19:39] to be tortured bringing he wouldn't like
[1:19:43] this hurts so good he chose to suffer
[1:19:46] affliction and eschewed and abstained
[1:19:49] from the pleasures of the world for
[1:19:51] season because verse 26 he esteemed the
[1:19:54] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:19:57] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:19:58] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:20:00] reward he was able to endure pain not
[1:20:04] because he loved pain but because he
[1:20:06] knew there was over
[1:20:07] word that was coming he could say no to
[1:20:09] the pleasure because he knew there was a
[1:20:11] greater pleasure coming listen that's
[1:20:13] when you begin to think maturely when
[1:20:15] you're when you get to a place where you
[1:20:17] can say no to what the world has to
[1:20:19] offer you can say no to opportunities
[1:20:21] that present themselves now knowing that
[1:20:23] God has something better later and what
[1:20:28] the world calls great you call small and
[1:20:31] what you call big the world may call
[1:20:33] foolishness but you know you'll find
[1:20:35] more pleasure in the will of God than
[1:20:37] anything the world has to offer listen
[1:20:40] we ought to be of the mindset there's
[1:20:42] nothing in the will of God I fear and
[1:20:44] there's nothing out of the will of God I
[1:20:46] want there's nothing out fear in the
[1:20:51] will of God but there's nothing out of
[1:20:54] his will I want he chose to suffer
[1:20:58] affliction because he esteemed even the
[1:21:01] reproach of Christ to be a greater rich
[1:21:05] big more gracious a greater riches than
[1:21:08] the treasures in Egypt so it wasn't even
[1:21:11] put in the sense that the the greatness
[1:21:13] of Christ was greater than the greatness
[1:21:15] of Egypt the reproach was greater listen
[1:21:20] the backside of this message the worst
[1:21:22] part of this message that the hard parts
[1:21:24] the difficult parts the worst things
[1:21:25] people can drag oh I esteemed that to be
[1:21:28] greater the reproach of it misson
[1:21:31] brother Branham said things that were
[1:21:32] really really hard to take and if you
[1:21:35] want you can say well brother Branham
[1:21:36] said that because he was the misogynist
[1:21:40] brother branham said that because he was
[1:21:42] a chauvinist brother brems said that
[1:21:44] because he was racist and you could come
[1:21:46] up all sorts of isms and all sorts of
[1:21:49] things to attach to it and listen I
[1:21:51] don't care if the world can categorize
[1:21:53] it as racism chauvinism massagin ISM I
[1:21:56] believe that that is a greater the
[1:21:58] reproach is greater than what this world
[1:22:00] has to offer
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:06] because he had respect he knew that with
[1:22:10] the reproach came a rewarding he
[1:22:12] respected he endured because of the
[1:22:14] reward he did not faint he did not fail
[1:22:17] because it respected the reward that
[1:22:18] would come and so there was no shame
[1:22:21] even though there's a reproach there was
[1:22:23] no shame last night we preached I am not
[1:22:25] ashamed of the message there was no
[1:22:27] shame because of the reward the shame
[1:22:30] and the reproach even as its laid out
[1:22:33] here in the scripture it paled in
[1:22:34] comparison to the reward the hard part
[1:22:38] the shame of Christ was greater than the
[1:22:42] glory of Egypt he's not even taken to
[1:22:45] consideration the glory of it because we
[1:22:47] could all say the glory of Christ is
[1:22:49] greater than the glory of Egypt but here
[1:22:50] he sent the shame the reproach of Christ
[1:22:52] was greater than the glory of Egypt come
[1:22:54] on now the shame of this message is
[1:22:56] greater than all the glory of
[1:22:57] denominations all their beauty all their
[1:23:00] grandeur all their glitter all their all
[1:23:01] their glisten none of that none of that
[1:23:04] it can't compare even to the shame of
[1:23:06] this and what the scripture is
[1:23:12] establishing and I I'm grateful that
[1:23:15] tomorrow's a holiday
[1:23:16] I don't feel pressured to wrap it up
[1:23:19] because the kids got to go to school
[1:23:20] tomorrow
[1:23:21] oh but if you suffer there's a reward
[1:23:31] so if I make you suffer tonight you just
[1:23:35] take it I'm gonna conduct myself with
[1:23:37] joy and missing the trowel that the Lord
[1:23:40] is allowed to come to pass by letting
[1:23:42] brother air priests so long I'll just
[1:23:47] say smile Church joy comes in the moon
[1:23:51] [Applause]
[1:23:56] because this is what God is impressing
[1:24:00] upon the believer labor without strain
[1:24:02] is bonded labor without a reward is
[1:24:04] bondage if you if you worked and worked
[1:24:08] and worked and worked and then you
[1:24:09] didn't get a paycheck that's slavery
[1:24:13] that's exactly what it is I'm working
[1:24:16] for no payment I'm not working for any
[1:24:17] reward I don't have any equity in what
[1:24:19] I'm doing that's bondage to labor
[1:24:21] without a reward is bondage so when one
[1:24:24] is sowing in the field and planting what
[1:24:27] the sower does is he envisions the
[1:24:29] harvest and it's difficult in the winter
[1:24:31] to disk up your land and to move rock
[1:24:33] and to get things ready and turn it over
[1:24:35] it's difficult to begin to plant the
[1:24:37] seed it's difficult to water and to do
[1:24:39] all the labor and all the effort through
[1:24:41] months after months with no we bit
[1:24:43] reward or benefit but every effort in
[1:24:45] every step that's taken through the
[1:24:47] winter to through the spring through the
[1:24:48] summer the sower and the farmer
[1:24:51] envisions the harvest and he knows one
[1:24:53] day I'm gonna get wheat out of this one
[1:24:55] day I'm gonna get corn one day I'm gonna
[1:24:57] get a crop and I'm gonna partake in that
[1:25:00] amount a feed on it so it's actually the
[1:25:02] harvest that encourages the laborer but
[1:25:04] there was never any harvest than what's
[1:25:07] good doing what what good is there to do
[1:25:08] this and so it's motivation the the the
[1:25:14] the the the vision of the harvest is
[1:25:17] what strengthens the labor it's an
[1:25:19] incentive and brother Branham says in
[1:25:22] life story says if you only looked for
[1:25:24] today you'd be a miserable person so he
[1:25:27] says look out look to the end out there
[1:25:30] and live for that out to the end so
[1:25:35] we've got we've got to be a
[1:25:36] forward-looking people but the Branham I
[1:25:38] may be paraphrasing a little this a
[1:25:39] little bit but he said I believe a
[1:25:40] Christian ought to be the most ambitious
[1:25:42] person
[1:25:43] and so we ought to be ambitious we are
[1:25:46] we ought to be a goal focused people
[1:25:48] that we have a goal we have it we're
[1:25:50] visionary why are you doing this why do
[1:25:54] we go to church why don't we labor why
[1:25:55] do we strive why don't we raise our
[1:25:57] children the way that we do why do we
[1:25:58] apply the token we've got a goal in mind
[1:26:00] and I say this and perhaps I'm just kind
[1:26:05] of opening up the curtain a little bit
[1:26:06] about where I'm going for the last 2,000
[1:26:09] years within these seven church ages the
[1:26:12] church experience of a genuine holy
[1:26:14] ghost filled believer was leading them
[1:26:16] to a grave that's just the reality and
[1:26:19] we've been fellowshiping on how God put
[1:26:21] the Pentecostal experience in the church
[1:26:23] and never took it away it was the one
[1:26:24] thing the devil could never take away
[1:26:26] from the individual the individual would
[1:26:28] receive every single believer in every
[1:26:29] age brother and said every age is the
[1:26:31] age of the Holy Ghost to the believer
[1:26:32] and so they had this baptism of the Holy
[1:26:36] Ghost which is the new birth a
[1:26:37] quickening of an incorruptible seed but
[1:26:40] that leadership of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:42] that experience led them to a grave
[1:26:44] every sermon every every prayer line
[1:26:47] every altar experience every move of God
[1:26:50] every miracle every sign every wonder
[1:26:53] every sermon every powerful move of God
[1:26:56] in genuine vindication of the Holy
[1:26:58] Spirit was leading them to a grave but
[1:27:01] listen this age is not so in this age
[1:27:06] every miracle every shine every wonder
[1:27:09] every altar call every prayer line every
[1:27:13] manifestation of the Spirit is going to
[1:27:15] lead a people to a meeting in the air
[1:27:19] there will be up people that will not go
[1:27:22] to a grave so we ought to be a goal
[1:27:27] focused people the sky not the grave is
[1:27:30] the goal we ought to believe that
[1:27:32] there's gonna be a people that will not
[1:27:34] taste death so we ought to look out to
[1:27:41] the end live for that I'm not living for
[1:27:46] a funeral
[1:27:48] that's not that's not my goal I'm not
[1:27:51] living every day thinking well what's my
[1:27:52] kids gonna say about me at my funeral
[1:27:54] I'm living for the day that I meet them
[1:27:56] in the air and we're the same age where
[1:28:01] I can look my son Elya in the eye both
[1:28:03] of us 21 years old and say son this is
[1:28:06] gonna be a good time
[1:28:08] hallelujah you know what that's gonna be
[1:28:10] in a thousand year youth camp that's why
[1:28:15] the devil fights the young people so
[1:28:17] much you look just like that group
[1:28:19] that's gonna kick him into the lake of
[1:28:21] fire hallelujah
[1:28:26] it's gonna be a bunch of people that
[1:28:28] look like teenagers let's say devil you
[1:28:32] can't handle me no no not devil I'm
[1:28:37] gonna cast it into the lake of fire
[1:28:40] that's why the devil fights young people
[1:28:43] in the beauty of holiness that's why he
[1:28:45] fights your purity your sanctity and
[1:28:48] your righteousness because you look like
[1:28:49] the people that'll destroy him
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:29:02] and you know that millennium that a
[1:29:05] thousand year youth care
[1:29:06] you're just pre-gaming for eternity
[1:29:09] because they're gonna be that same look
[1:29:12] in that same body that same image of
[1:29:14] youth for the rest of eternity we got to
[1:29:18] be goal focused in Hebrews chapter 11
[1:29:21] verse 6 it says but without faith it is
[1:29:23] impossible to please him for he that
[1:29:25] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:29:28] you believe that he is now that's the
[1:29:32] first part and that's a conjunction so
[1:29:34] it joins these two thoughts together
[1:29:35] it's not enough just to believe that he
[1:29:37] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:29:40] that diligently seek Him
[1:29:42] so there's something about your faith
[1:29:44] that has to believe your faith has to
[1:29:46] move you to come to God and then
[1:29:49] believing that he is and that he is a
[1:29:51] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:29:53] Him and I believe there's a great
[1:29:56] mystery in this I think there's
[1:29:58] something contained in this and as I'm
[1:30:01] and as I'm speaking about the reward of
[1:30:04] Malachi for I believe we should have a
[1:30:06] respect for the reward of Malachi 4 we
[1:30:10] have to highly esteem it we have to
[1:30:12] understand the reward or the incentive
[1:30:14] of this message brother Branham writes
[1:30:16] in the church age book if they are
[1:30:18] willing to walk with him through the
[1:30:19] toils and snares of life and be an honor
[1:30:22] to him he's going to reward them he is
[1:30:27] not forgetful of our labor of love God
[1:30:30] will always recompense us for our
[1:30:32] efforts to please him then why wouldn't
[1:30:35] we want to do it why wouldn't we want to
[1:30:37] please him in our decisions and the way
[1:30:39] we conduct ourselves the way we think
[1:30:41] the way we respond react to certain
[1:30:43] situations and the way that we portray
[1:30:45] ourselves the way we dress all he said
[1:30:47] why wouldn't we labor to please him
[1:30:48] knowing that he's faithful to reward us
[1:30:51] he is going to reward them he won't
[1:30:54] forget your labor of love he will always
[1:30:56] recompense reward us for our efforts to
[1:30:59] please him he sees your effort and so
[1:31:03] with that as just a little bit of a
[1:31:04] foundation let's look at verse 41 of
[1:31:07] Matthew chapter 10
[1:31:10] man I just enjoy preaching to you all
[1:31:13] you pull so well I'm gonna I think what
[1:31:17] they should do is this ought to be a at
[1:31:20] least the initial proving ground of a
[1:31:22] ministry if a man can't preach here he
[1:31:26] can't preach you just you don't have
[1:31:33] nothing to work with but there and we
[1:31:36] tried we tried we pulled we pushed we
[1:31:40] lift it up we put man we did everything
[1:31:41] we could we just couldn't get anything
[1:31:42] out of you well I just ain't got it who
[1:31:49] knows you guys might even make a guy
[1:31:50] without a gift be able to preach you're
[1:31:53] hungry I like that Matthew chapter 10
[1:31:59] verse 41 he that receiveth the prophet
[1:32:03] and the name of a prophet shall receive
[1:32:04] a Prophet's reward and he that receiveth
[1:32:07] the righteous man in the name of a
[1:32:09] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:32:11] man's reward now this is a very unique
[1:32:16] scripture and the way that it's written
[1:32:18] it's it's intriguing and you think well
[1:32:20] if you receive a prophet in the name of
[1:32:22] a prophet what does that mean and then
[1:32:24] you shall receive a Prophet's reward and
[1:32:26] then he says the same of a righteous man
[1:32:28] and we made part of this well what does
[1:32:30] it mean I would really like to know what
[1:32:31] this means and by God's grace someone
[1:32:33] asked him the question August 23rd 1964
[1:32:36] brother Branham if you have time please
[1:32:38] explain Matthew 1041 I would like to
[1:32:42] know what is a Prophet's reward and I
[1:32:44] might I'll just embellish this and maybe
[1:32:46] dramatize it a little bit this person
[1:32:48] says if you have time please explain
[1:32:50] Matthew 1041 because to them perhaps
[1:32:52] they thought this would be a series if
[1:32:54] brother Branham is ever going to get to
[1:32:56] part 112 it's gonna be whenever he
[1:32:58] preaches something like this if you have
[1:33:00] time please explain Matthew 1041 surely
[1:33:03] this is something that's going to take
[1:33:05] two tapes but his answer is very very
[1:33:09] simple because you're thinking wow me
[1:33:11] brother branham really let's dig deep on
[1:33:13] this what does it mean to receive a
[1:33:15] prophet and the receive a Prophet's
[1:33:17] reward I would like to know what is a
[1:33:19] Prophet's reward are you ready for this
[1:33:20] very very deep
[1:33:22] answer a Prophet's reward is to be a
[1:33:26] friend with the profit and if they want
[1:33:31] to know what a Prophet's reward is is to
[1:33:33] be a friend of the prophetsí that's a
[1:33:37] reward he's your friend says it three
[1:33:40] times so there's no ambiguity here a
[1:33:42] Prophet's reward is to be a friend of a
[1:33:44] profit that's what the reward is to be a
[1:33:46] friend of the prophetsí that's reward
[1:33:48] he's your friend now would you agree
[1:33:51] this is a very simple answer and where
[1:33:55] does God hide himself in simplicity so
[1:33:59] here's lesson number one in
[1:34:00] hide-and-seek you're going to find
[1:34:02] somebody where they're hiding and so if
[1:34:05] God hides himself in simplicity you're
[1:34:07] gonna find him in simplicity God hasn't
[1:34:09] hidden simplicity and then you go find
[1:34:11] him in complexity he's hidden simplicity
[1:34:16] so you're gonna find him in simplicity
[1:34:18] you can't try to make things complicated
[1:34:20] and difficult to understand you think
[1:34:22] you found God if it gets complicated
[1:34:24] God's not in it and so it's a very very
[1:34:29] simple answer but it was a great truth
[1:34:31] that's revealed in this answer and so
[1:34:34] it's very important number one not to
[1:34:36] get carnal because if you make this
[1:34:39] carnal well if you receive a profit in
[1:34:42] the name of a profit you shall receive a
[1:34:44] Prophet's reward and to be a friend with
[1:34:47] the pro and the reward is to be a friend
[1:34:49] that means none of us have received a
[1:34:52] Prophet's reward unless I'm missing
[1:34:56] somebody anybody here fish with brother
[1:34:58] branham I wish I could make a prophetic
[1:35:01] attempt at fishing with brother branham
[1:35:03] especially when he caught those six
[1:35:05] seven pounders 90 of them back there for
[1:35:08] the Troy and our fellowship at all we
[1:35:09] can believe that
[1:35:10] we're fell about golf we can't
[1:35:12] find a real positive quote on golf but
[1:35:14] we can find a lot of good quotes about
[1:35:16] fishing Shah
[1:35:23] I'm not saying it is but could it be
[1:35:25] that fishin is millennial well so if
[1:35:36] that was the real if we were gonna be
[1:35:38] carnal Wells to be his buddy receive a
[1:35:40] profit you become a profits buddy then
[1:35:42] none of us could be his friend
[1:35:44] none of us context time none of us could
[1:35:46] call him none of us could say we fished
[1:35:47] with him none of us could say we were
[1:35:49] friends
[1:35:49] nobody can share some of these
[1:35:50] testimonies even great men of God
[1:35:52] brother brother ed Bisco has a
[1:35:54] tremendous testimony I believe he's
[1:35:56] liking unto Timothy someone whom brother
[1:35:58] Branham dealt with and certain things
[1:36:00] came through his ministry that helps us
[1:36:01] to understand certain visions in the way
[1:36:03] God used a gift and he was a friend in
[1:36:06] that way to a prophet for our benefit
[1:36:08] but none of us have that same
[1:36:10] relationship brother fiscal does we
[1:36:13] can't be like brother McHugh's and go
[1:36:14] hunting with them we can't be like
[1:36:16] certain other brothers that had that
[1:36:17] privilege of being called a friend but
[1:36:20] we can still receive a Prophet's reward
[1:36:23] because he's not being carnal when he
[1:36:25] answers this he says if if you receive a
[1:36:28] prophet in the name of a prophet you
[1:36:30] shall receive a Prophet's reward and a
[1:36:33] Prophet's reward is to be a friend with
[1:36:35] the Prophet so then we must look to the
[1:36:37] scripture to find out what it means to
[1:36:39] be a friend in John chapter 15 verses 14
[1:36:44] and 15 he says you are my friends you
[1:36:48] want to be a friend of the Prophet you
[1:36:49] are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:36:52] command you so now we're learning I can
[1:36:55] be a friend to a prophet I can be his
[1:36:57] friend if I do what he says for me to do
[1:37:00] he says henceforth I call you not
[1:37:02] servants it's important to understand
[1:37:04] that he's talking about relationship for
[1:37:07] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[1:37:09] doeth but I have called you friends why
[1:37:12] why have you called me a friend for all
[1:37:14] things that I've heard of my father I
[1:37:16] have made known unto you praise the Lord
[1:37:19] I can be a friend to a prophet because
[1:37:21] he has not treated me like a servant but
[1:37:25] he has whatever the Lord has told him he
[1:37:27] has told me
[1:37:29] brother branham held nothing back even
[1:37:32] though he restrained maybe in language
[1:37:34] restraining how deep he would go he did
[1:37:36] not fail to deliver to us and perfect
[1:37:39] and complete message and we don't need
[1:37:43] anybody to come and add to it the only
[1:37:47] thing that can be added is more life
[1:37:50] take it in a more powerful way but the
[1:37:53] potentials there the life is there the
[1:37:55] truth is there it's a perfect message so
[1:38:01] whatever he heard of the father he's
[1:38:02] made known and so we could have a
[1:38:05] scriptural friendship what is the
[1:38:07] scriptural fynch friendship number one
[1:38:09] he obeys you are my friends if you do
[1:38:13] what I tell you to do that's a true
[1:38:15] believer true believer obeys the Word of
[1:38:17] God and the second characteristic of
[1:38:20] this scriptural friendship is you
[1:38:21] receive secret things so why do you
[1:38:25] speak to them in parables but to us he
[1:38:28] says because it's given unto you to know
[1:38:29] the mysteries of the kingdom I don't
[1:38:31] speak to them the same way I speak to
[1:38:33] you
[1:38:34] so they obey and they receive secret
[1:38:37] things but the BAM said this he said I
[1:38:40] call you friends and a friend tells his
[1:38:42] friends all things so when he said as a
[1:38:45] prophets rewards to be a friend with the
[1:38:47] Prophet there's more to it than just a
[1:38:49] buddy mark to it than just efficient
[1:38:52] power there's something deeper more
[1:38:54] special to it says in Exodus 33 11 and
[1:38:58] the Lord spake unto Moses face to face
[1:39:00] as a man speaketh unto his friend so
[1:39:05] there's things that are being
[1:39:06] communicated as something supernatural
[1:39:08] in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the
[1:39:11] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:39:13] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:39:15] unto him for righteousness which is by
[1:39:18] faith by revelation it was imputed to
[1:39:20] him for righteous and he was called the
[1:39:22] friend of God God spoke to Moses that
[1:39:27] was the characteristic of friendship
[1:39:28] Moses did what God told him to do that's
[1:39:31] the characteristic and the completeness
[1:39:33] of the friendship God spoke to Abraham
[1:39:36] that's the first part revealed secret
[1:39:38] things Abraham did what God showed him
[1:39:40] and the Bible's tells them Oh
[1:39:42] this was a friend of God Abraham was a
[1:39:44] friend of God why because he told him
[1:39:46] things and they did what he said and so
[1:39:51] you could have a friendship
[1:39:52] if you receive secret things and obey
[1:39:55] those things receive a prophet you
[1:39:58] receive a reward it's not being a buddy
[1:40:01] not being a Chum because none of us
[1:40:03] would have that but we can be a
[1:40:05] scriptural friend we can have this
[1:40:09] relationship where a God has given him
[1:40:12] things to share and give out to the
[1:40:14] people and we receive it from him and we
[1:40:17] do what we're told it says in Malachi
[1:40:20] chapter four verses five and six behold
[1:40:22] I will send you Elijah the prophet so
[1:40:26] God sins and you receive because if you
[1:40:30] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:40:32] prophet you shall receive a Prophet's
[1:40:34] reward so there's a scriptural promise I
[1:40:36] will send you Elijah the prophet God
[1:40:39] sins therefore you must receive and if
[1:40:41] there's a sending and receiving there
[1:40:43] must be a reward if you receive him
[1:40:46] there has got to be a reward for this
[1:40:48] Elijah the Prophet and it begins to
[1:40:50] speak in a way to give us a clue as to
[1:40:52] what this reward is because he sends
[1:40:54] them before the coming of the Great and
[1:40:56] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:40:58] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[1:41:00] children and the second part the heart
[1:41:02] of the children to their fathers which
[1:41:03] is what we fulfill in this hour lest I
[1:41:06] come and smite the earth with the curse
[1:41:07] because the curse is coming but before
[1:41:09] this happens he sends a ministry to turn
[1:41:12] the hearts back to the original faith
[1:41:14] and because of that it raises up a
[1:41:16] people that's gonna walk out on the
[1:41:18] ashes of the wicked and so when that
[1:41:20] scene is introduced at the beginning it
[1:41:22] tells us that ashes are coming great
[1:41:25] judgments coming but before that happens
[1:41:27] I'm gonna send you a prophet and if you
[1:41:29] receive him it's gonna do something for
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:33] he comes in for the dreadful day before
[1:41:36] the right just walk out upon the ashes
[1:41:37] of the wicked and so the ministry this
[1:41:40] this this prophet called Elijah the
[1:41:44] spirit of Elijah if we look at the
[1:41:46] Ministry of Elijah it holds the secret
[1:41:49] to our reward the Ministry of Elijah it
[1:41:53] holds this great secret of this
[1:41:54] incentive for receiving Malachi 4 and if
[1:41:57] we just look you want to start to look
[1:41:58] at the scripture in first King 17 you'll
[1:42:02] see that it's pointing to a prize we'll
[1:42:05] just start here in 1st Kings 17 reverse
[1:42:07] read verses 8 to 16 I know I know
[1:42:14] somebody's counting scriptures so I
[1:42:16] don't know if I'll have as many as I had
[1:42:19] last night but here at first Kings
[1:42:20] chapter 17 verses 8 to 16 now we're
[1:42:23] looking at the Ministry of Elijah to
[1:42:25] catch kind of what what comes at the
[1:42:27] spirit of Elijah that would tell us what
[1:42:28] our reward is and the word of the Lord
[1:42:30] came unto him saying arise get thee to
[1:42:33] Zarephath which belongeth to Zion and
[1:42:36] dwell there behold I have commanded a
[1:42:40] widow woman there to sustain you well as
[1:42:44] a mouthful here's a prophet of God who
[1:42:48] in this time of great famine is time of
[1:42:50] the lacking and this great drought
[1:42:52] that's upon the land God could have used
[1:42:56] any means and it will look back in a
[1:42:59] moment to what he used but there came a
[1:43:01] point where God actually raised up and
[1:43:04] ordained a woman to sustain the Prophet
[1:43:07] that might seem a little backwards
[1:43:09] here's God's prophet here's God's
[1:43:11] anointed alright but yet God's going to
[1:43:13] command a widow and so this Widow I want
[1:43:17] to use her as a type of the brine this
[1:43:19] Widow is a type of the bride in the last
[1:43:21] days and brother Branham said your first
[1:43:24] husband is dead God let it die he says
[1:43:28] of you you must be dead to your first
[1:43:30] husband so we can realize that in a
[1:43:32] spiritual sense we identify with this
[1:43:35] widow whose husband was dead and now
[1:43:37] brother bear says your first husband is
[1:43:39] dead God let it die and as blue
[1:43:42] we must be dead to that first husband so
[1:43:46] there's characteristics of this woman in
[1:43:47] Zarephath that speaks to us as a bride
[1:43:50] and it says that she was the widow of
[1:43:53] Zarephath because he said get thee to
[1:43:55] Zarephath as their faith was a place of
[1:43:57] a refinery and the very word means to
[1:44:00] smelt or to refine so it was a place
[1:44:03] where metals were proven it was a place
[1:44:05] where metals were purged it was refinery
[1:44:07] it means to refine the very name is
[1:44:09] effort means to prove or to test or to
[1:44:11] prove to be true and brother man said
[1:44:14] every overcomer has to be put to the
[1:44:17] test what do you say brother by the
[1:44:22] Danube Lee was bringing that out
[1:44:23] yesterday more it was wonderful listen
[1:44:24] the world goes through mortgage trouble
[1:44:26] the world goes through sickness and all
[1:44:29] sorts of trouble you don't read the
[1:44:30] paper say my goodness they must be elect
[1:44:33] they lost everything
[1:44:34] no the bride is to be tried by the word
[1:44:37] that's your testing when you're tested
[1:44:41] by the word and this is a place a widow
[1:44:43] is in a place of testing Zarephath here
[1:44:46] we are in Satan's Eden this wicked ages
[1:44:49] to prove you're not like Eve so here we
[1:44:51] are in a place of testing in a place of
[1:44:54] refining in a place we're going to be
[1:44:56] proven to be true and we realize many
[1:44:59] are the afflictions of the righteous but
[1:45:02] all your suffering holds the promise of
[1:45:05] glory I like to say this every trial is
[1:45:09] pregnant every single one of them
[1:45:13] because God promised that I will bring
[1:45:17] forth through your suffering glory
[1:45:19] they'll bring good out of everything and
[1:45:22] so you can look at everything and say
[1:45:24] it's pregnant pain is pregnant with
[1:45:26] glory suffered is pregnant with glory
[1:45:29] this trial is pregnant with glory
[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:33] so this widow type of the bride she was
[1:45:36] in a place to be tested to be proven and
[1:45:39] brother Branham said he ordained the
[1:45:41] Ravens his servants this is a speaking
[1:45:45] about Elisha blessed them Birds his
[1:45:47] servants that kept the voice of Elisha
[1:45:49] during the time of his isolation from
[1:45:51] the church so brother Rams character
[1:45:56] see what happened prior that there was
[1:45:59] servants there was Ravens that sustained
[1:46:01] Elijah's ministry during the time of his
[1:46:03] isolation from the church but now the
[1:46:06] isolation is ending so he says it's not
[1:46:10] just servants that sustain Elijah's
[1:46:13] ministry but then God commands the widow
[1:46:16] to sustain him and this may seem like
[1:46:20] well from servants to Widow that seems
[1:46:22] very odd it's spoken of a woman who may
[1:46:24] be weak and carnal eyes but now he has
[1:46:26] actually called a widowed woman to
[1:46:29] sustain the prophet to support to
[1:46:33] nourish to keep his ministry alive to
[1:46:37] keep him going
[1:46:37] so when brother Graham said he used
[1:46:39] Ravens to sustain Elijah but now he
[1:46:42] commands a widow there's a change from a
[1:46:44] servant to a woman there's a change in
[1:46:48] the language as a change in the
[1:46:49] relationship
[1:46:50] he used Ravens but Ravens could only do
[1:46:52] so much there's only so much communion
[1:46:54] there's almost only so much they could
[1:46:55] have in common the Ravens were merely
[1:46:57] bringing substance for him to feed on
[1:46:59] but now here was a woman that could give
[1:47:01] him the opportunity to express the full
[1:47:03] benefits of his ministry what could he
[1:47:07] do for a raven how could they commute
[1:47:09] house things to be expressed to that
[1:47:10] relationship he was using servants to
[1:47:12] his Ravens type to servants that kept
[1:47:14] his ministry alive until he came in
[1:47:16] contact with the woman you could just
[1:47:23] preach on that so there's going to be a
[1:47:27] change in relationship Jesus said I
[1:47:30] you're not a servant because the servant
[1:47:32] doesn't know what his master's doing but
[1:47:34] I call you friends and so a servant
[1:47:37] doesn't know the Masters will but now it
[1:47:39] changes to a woman and so brother
[1:47:41] Branham begins to use a language to help
[1:47:43] us to understand at the time that the
[1:47:44] seals are open I'm going to call you
[1:47:47] bride that you'll understand it I don't
[1:47:49] want to call you church because you
[1:47:51] might misunderstand our relationship I
[1:47:53] don't want to call you just a servant I
[1:47:55] don't want to just call you friends I
[1:47:57] want to call you bride so that you can
[1:47:59] understand the dispensation we're living
[1:48:01] in
[1:48:02] I'm gonna call you bride not Church so
[1:48:05] that you'll understand that there has
[1:48:06] been a woman in this last day and listen
[1:48:09] if there's been something that's
[1:48:11] sustained Elijah's ministry it's because
[1:48:13] God commanded a widow hello it's been
[1:48:18] the bride that kept the largest ministry
[1:48:20] alive it hasn't been a man
[1:48:22] it hasn't been servants that's not a
[1:48:24] preacher in this message that can take
[1:48:26] credit for you have done it it has been
[1:48:31] the bride I don't call you church
[1:48:33] it hasn't been organizations it hasn't
[1:48:35] been denominations it hasn't it hasn't
[1:48:38] been anything of that communicant ISM
[1:48:40] none of that has done it it's been the
[1:48:44] bride she has kept this ministry alive
[1:48:47] she sustained it she nourished it let's
[1:48:53] just be honest if there's not you
[1:48:56] there's no me I'm just going to speak
[1:49:00] very honestly if we're not careful we
[1:49:02] get it backwards
[1:49:03] and we think that people are rallying
[1:49:05] around the men around the gift but
[1:49:07] listen we're only here because you're
[1:49:09] here and if you didn't show up the three
[1:49:12] of us would just go eat but they're
[1:49:14] smiling each one of us with just all us
[1:49:16] ministers we just go eat and talk but
[1:49:18] because you're here we've got a job to
[1:49:20] do and you didn't come here because of
[1:49:23] me you didn't come in for some other man
[1:49:25] you came here because of Christ and
[1:49:27] that's why we exist the ministry is a
[1:49:30] servant to the bride we need from behind
[1:49:33] we lead by example you do it because
[1:49:38] it's a labor of love and yes we're
[1:49:40] servants and yes we do our part but you
[1:49:43] the bride have sustained Elijah's
[1:49:45] ministry he said I've commanded a widow
[1:49:51] woman there to sustain day he says in
[1:49:57] verse 10 so he arose and went to
[1:49:59] Zarephath and when he came to the gate
[1:50:02] of the city now we have to be very kind
[1:50:05] of keep the whole scene in mind there in
[1:50:08] the middle of a drought so there are
[1:50:11] certain characteristics of this season
[1:50:13] in this time that if we don't if
[1:50:15] don't kind of keep that in mind it's not
[1:50:17] like he was showing up at a time of
[1:50:19] Plenty in a and just the markets full
[1:50:21] and everyone's being blasting everybody
[1:50:23] everybody has money and every house
[1:50:25] everybody has potential and everything's
[1:50:27] available everything's great
[1:50:28] he's coming a time where he had to sit
[1:50:30] by a brook and be fed by Ravens and when
[1:50:32] the brook dried up there's time for God
[1:50:34] to command a woman and he says he rose
[1:50:41] and went to Zarephath and when he came
[1:50:43] to the gate of the city behold the woman
[1:50:45] was there gathering of sticks and he
[1:50:48] called to her and said now get let's
[1:50:51] just enter into this I pray thee that's
[1:50:57] me I pray thee a little water and a
[1:50:59] vessel that I may drink now to us that
[1:51:03] don't mean much right now if I said I
[1:51:04] wanted another bottle of water I could
[1:51:06] drink all these and then brother Jack or
[1:51:08] maybe brother truck would just go about
[1:51:09] 50 yards that way go to Dollar General
[1:51:10] and buy me more water yeah wouldn't be a
[1:51:14] problem make me thirsty you know and we
[1:51:20] don't even think twice about to pay for
[1:51:21] it but this is put yourself in this
[1:51:25] situation he asked for the most precious
[1:51:29] resource he asked for the thing that was
[1:51:33] the most scarce to them if they had
[1:51:35] water there'd be no problem but because
[1:51:38] they lacked water that's why they were
[1:51:40] going through the things they're gonna
[1:51:41] this was a drought this is a time where
[1:51:43] there was no rain coming because the
[1:51:45] word Lord came and said hey it's not
[1:51:46] gonna rain until I called for it and so
[1:51:48] now he's in this place where there's no
[1:51:51] water and there's such a little resource
[1:51:53] and this is something very scarce very
[1:51:55] precious very valuable and he asked of
[1:51:57] her the thing that would be the most
[1:51:59] scarce and the most of that most
[1:52:00] valuable go fetch me a little water and
[1:52:04] notice what happens in verse 11 and as
[1:52:06] she was going to fetch it praise the
[1:52:11] Lord
[1:52:12] woman go get me some water and she
[1:52:15] didn't say excuse me
[1:52:18] I don't know where you're from but we
[1:52:22] ain't got no water up in her I don't
[1:52:29] know where you come from
[1:52:31] mr. Alamo the big lake must have water
[1:52:33] all the time but we have a drought here
[1:52:35] and the brook gun dried up and we don't
[1:52:37] have a bunch of water in here she didn't
[1:52:41] do that she didn't even say well sir I'm
[1:52:44] very sorry but this is a drought do you
[1:52:46] want anything else I can get you some
[1:52:47] dust I got a couple sticks here you want
[1:52:51] some sticks notice what she did he said
[1:52:56] bring me some water and she immediately
[1:52:58] said I'll go get you some water there
[1:53:01] was something about that woman the
[1:53:03] Prophet knew when he asked her to do a
[1:53:05] hard thing they asked her to do
[1:53:09] something difficult it was then he knew
[1:53:11] this is the woman hallelujah that's why
[1:53:17] this message ask you to do difficult
[1:53:19] things it proves to God you're that
[1:53:22] woman yes yes that's why this message is
[1:53:29] hard that's why it's difficult that's
[1:53:32] why it's not always easy but it proves
[1:53:34] that you're that woman hey men her
[1:53:42] obedience was instinctive it was okay
[1:53:46] you want water I'll get you water oh my
[1:53:52] that was an instinctive faith now you
[1:53:55] start to see man there's there's a
[1:53:56] relationship here for man yes because he
[1:53:58] asked her something and you are my
[1:54:00] friend if you do what silver asks you to
[1:54:02] do here she's going as she was going to
[1:54:04] fetch it then he called her stops her
[1:54:06] maybe it'll get easy and I said bring me
[1:54:11] I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy
[1:54:13] hand and she said as the Lord God my
[1:54:16] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[1:54:19] because he asked for a cake she's just
[1:54:21] being honest I don't have one I'm sorry
[1:54:24] I what I what you're asking for I don't
[1:54:26] have but I have a handful of mill and a
[1:54:28] barrel and a little all in the crews and
[1:54:32] behold now this is so you can especially
[1:54:34] your mothers your parents imagine her
[1:54:36] desperation and I'm gathering two sticks
[1:54:39] then I'm I go in and dress it for me and
[1:54:42] my son that we may eat it and die I
[1:54:48] think of how grave this situation is if
[1:54:51] a mother knows she's making her and her
[1:54:53] son her last meal their last meal this
[1:54:55] is our last meal we're gonna die after
[1:54:57] this she and her son were facing you
[1:54:59] have to catch this part of this story
[1:55:00] they're facing certain death death is in
[1:55:04] him it's a shadow hanging over them she
[1:55:06] wasn't just being flippant she just
[1:55:07] wasn't saying I'm literally going to die
[1:55:09] know that we use that word literally
[1:55:11] when we're using a figuratively my head
[1:55:13] literally exploded that means your head
[1:55:15] should have exploded
[1:55:16] I mean ingress don't even mean what it
[1:55:20] used to mean anymore and so this is
[1:55:27] definite she's going to die and she's in
[1:55:30] the state of knowing I'm making this
[1:55:32] meal we're going to eat it's gonna be a
[1:55:34] last meal for us and so now with death
[1:55:36] hanging over her lie just said unto her
[1:55:40] she's not objecting she's clarifying
[1:55:42] bring me bread she said I don't have
[1:55:44] bread I've actually gathered these
[1:55:46] sticks that I might make a fire that I
[1:55:48] might be able to prepare this meal and
[1:55:50] in prepare make a cake for us to eat and
[1:55:52] I she's just explaining their
[1:55:53] circumstances and Elijah said under fear
[1:55:56] not
[1:55:58] hardly in the face of certain death he
[1:56:01] says fear not and that's what the
[1:56:04] message says unto you fear not for
[1:56:07] you've given power to bind him the
[1:56:10] greatest and the least hallelujah I
[1:56:15] don't mean any disrespect fire but when
[1:56:18] that black mamba went down in that
[1:56:19] helicopter it only reminded me that that
[1:56:22] momma death is gonna die one day it's
[1:56:27] nothing but the truth there he was he
[1:56:34] said you've been given power to bind him
[1:56:36] the greatest and the least he says fear
[1:56:39] not go and do as thou has said keep
[1:56:42] doing what you're doing he says but make
[1:56:44] me thereof a little cake first bring it
[1:56:48] unto me
[1:56:48] and after make for thee and for thy son
[1:56:52] you're gonna put this first for thus
[1:56:55] saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel
[1:56:58] of milk shall not waste neither shall
[1:57:01] the cruse of oil fell until the day the
[1:57:03] Lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she
[1:57:07] went and did she went and did according
[1:57:12] to the saint of Elijah and so this shows
[1:57:15] that she had obedience this is
[1:57:18] friendship
[1:57:19] this is relationship she received the
[1:57:22] Prophet she didn't just shake his hand
[1:57:26] she didn't say good morning but she
[1:57:30] received him and she went and did
[1:57:35] according to his signs and she and he
[1:57:37] and her house did eat many days and the
[1:57:41] barrel of mill wasted not neither did
[1:57:43] the crucible fail according to the word
[1:57:46] of the Lord which he spake by a child
[1:57:51] God backed up what Elijah said Elijah
[1:57:55] said it wouldn't waste I won't let it
[1:57:57] waste well I just said it wouldn't fill
[1:57:59] I won't let it fail God did not let the
[1:58:02] words of Elijah pertaining to that woman
[1:58:04] to fail whatever brother Branham is
[1:58:06] spoken about this pride in his
[1:58:08] santé Lord it will not fill whatever he
[1:58:15] said about you it will not fail fella
[1:58:19] been said by and through the members of
[1:58:21] the bride I'm looking at the members of
[1:58:24] the bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:58:26] promised of God to be fulfilled in the
[1:58:28] virgin it's not even just something
[1:58:32] collective it's something individual I
[1:58:35] [Applause]
[1:58:36] don't have to live vicariously through
[1:58:38] brother Jack I don't have to live by
[1:58:40] courtesy for the brother smiley I can do
[1:58:42] it myself
[1:58:43] I can fulfill all that was promised to
[1:58:47] God to be made manifest Oh according to
[1:58:55] which was spoke by Elijah
[1:58:57] she received the Prophet sorry she
[1:59:00] received a Prophet's reward what was it
[1:59:03] in this instance provision during a
[1:59:05] famine that was the reward of Elijah
[1:59:08] that was a Prophet's reward she received
[1:59:12] a benefit with death hanging over her
[1:59:13] she received the benefit of his ministry
[1:59:16] and Elijah's word the mill which
[1:59:20] represents the word the oil which
[1:59:21] represents this holy spirit and her
[1:59:24] receiving it it carried her and her son
[1:59:27] I just think about these images now it
[1:59:29] carried them over death it defeated
[1:59:34] death so we want now we want to
[1:59:36] recognize our full reward this is what
[1:59:38] happens in Elijah's ministry so there's
[1:59:41] something about Elijah's ministry that
[1:59:44] when it's confronted with death death
[1:59:46] has to give way in first Kings chapter
[1:59:51] 17 the widow's son dies and no doubt
[1:59:57] this is a test of her confidence in
[1:59:59] Elijah this is another test now when
[2:00:05] this happened I want you to think make
[2:00:06] this personal she gave credit to the
[2:00:10] message for keeping her son her and her
[2:00:13] son alive but then one day her son
[2:00:15] walked away from the message
[2:00:19] one day her son died
[2:00:21] now that was her opportunity to be
[2:00:24] shamed by the message that's when all
[2:00:27] her neighbors said yeah what about this
[2:00:28] ol Elijah business oh and your oil never
[2:00:32] ran out and your crews never ran out and
[2:00:33] you had all this grain and you had all
[2:00:35] this meal and you ate all these days but
[2:00:37] now look at you
[2:00:38] now that the waters come back now that
[2:00:40] everyone's thriving now your son dies
[2:00:42] and it would have been a reproach to her
[2:00:45] oh you believed Elijah you trusted
[2:00:47] Elijah in this one that kept you and
[2:00:50] your son alive now look where your son
[2:00:51] is today the widow wasn't done being
[2:00:55] tested it was another test when someone
[2:00:59] walks away when someone fell away when
[2:01:00] someone dies
[2:01:01] would she be shamed and walking away too
[2:01:03] would be she be shamed and rejecting the
[2:01:05] message no what happened in verse 22 and
[2:01:07] the Lord heard the voice of Elijah why
[2:01:10] because she didn't give up on Elijah
[2:01:13] she knew the same Elijah that could
[2:01:15] speak a word that could keep oil and
[2:01:18] me'll to be sustained and sustained
[2:01:20] during a famine if God could do that
[2:01:22] then God could raise the dead so the
[2:01:26] Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the
[2:01:29] soul of that child came into him again
[2:01:31] and he revived by whose voice the voice
[2:01:36] of Elijah and he says the spirit the
[2:01:42] soul the child came in and he was
[2:01:44] revived again you'll find that in this
[2:01:47] instance or with a resurrection it's the
[2:01:49] first time you read of a resurrection
[2:01:50] the spirit of Elijah is associated with
[2:01:52] defeating dead yes there's only three
[2:01:57] instances in the Old Testament of a
[2:01:58] resurrection and I know for a fact if
[2:02:03] I'm wrong that brother right there's
[2:02:05] gonna let me know and I can always print
[2:02:07] a retraction in the morning three
[2:02:12] instances the O in the Old Testament of
[2:02:14] the resurrection of the Dead the first
[2:02:16] one we just mentioned in first Kings 17
[2:02:18] that was done by Elijah the other two
[2:02:22] were done by Elijah why double portion 1
[2:02:28] by Elijah 2 by Elijah
[2:02:30] and I'm running out of time here but in
[2:02:33] second Kings chapter four we come to
[2:02:37] Elijah and in second Kings chapter four
[2:02:40] we heard a little bit of it last night
[2:02:42] about all the vessels being filled with
[2:02:43] the Holy Ghost but in verse eight it
[2:02:45] begins to talk about a shoot of my woman
[2:02:47] and she heard about the Prophet and what
[2:02:50] is she does she welcomed him into her
[2:02:52] home and provided food for him and
[2:02:54] actually gave a place for him to stay in
[2:02:57] the home and as she accepted the Prophet
[2:03:01] into the home the Prophet wanted to find
[2:03:03] a way to be a blessing to her and he
[2:03:05] found out that they had never brought
[2:03:07] forth that they had never had a child of
[2:03:10] their union so what did he do he
[2:03:11] actually spoke a word and click
[2:03:14] pronounced a blessing where a woman was
[2:03:16] dead he brought life and she was able to
[2:03:19] bring forth his son I'm just gonna I'm
[2:03:24] gonna maybe just go through this very
[2:03:26] quickly because you know the story now
[2:03:28] he was by the word of Elijah that caused
[2:03:30] a dead woman to come to life and bring
[2:03:33] forth the son and now this son that came
[2:03:37] by the word of the Prophet dies happens
[2:03:40] with Elijah comes with Elijah and this
[2:03:44] woman she's so convinced she had so
[2:03:47] received this prophet that when the son
[2:03:50] that was by his word died she didn't go
[2:03:53] oh that's it
[2:03:55] it was only good for so long I guess it
[2:03:58] was only good up until 2012 I guess it
[2:04:01] was only good up until this happened it
[2:04:03] was only good until that happened no
[2:04:05] she's thinking listen when I received
[2:04:07] him at the first I was barren and I was
[2:04:10] willing to have him in my home I was
[2:04:12] willing to give him place I was willing
[2:04:14] to plant a token I was willing to play
[2:04:16] the tapes I was willing to go to church
[2:04:18] I was willing to praise I was willing to
[2:04:20] get my home even when my moon was barren
[2:04:22] but as a reward he opened up my womb and
[2:04:25] I brought off the son
[2:04:27] and no matter what's happened to that
[2:04:29] son whether he leave this message
[2:04:32] whether he died that does not change my
[2:04:34] confidence in this ministry she kept on
[2:04:41] believing what she purposed in her heart
[2:04:44] is I want to get back to that man and
[2:04:48] you know what she wasn't just happy with
[2:04:49] the intermediary Elijah said go ahead
[2:04:52] get haze' to figure this out she said no
[2:04:53] I'm gonna get to the man of God and
[2:04:55] remember this where was he Mount Carmel
[2:04:58] that's the place of showdowns Elijah was
[2:05:03] there once
[2:05:03] now Elijah's there I want to just
[2:05:07] summarize this very quickly because you
[2:05:08] know that how the story ends this child
[2:05:11] laying dead she took him and put him in
[2:05:12] the room of that prophet yeah haze'
[2:05:14] actually took the staff and laid it on
[2:05:16] that prophet that wasn't going to do any
[2:05:18] good what had to come is that prophet
[2:05:20] had to come lay himself on it and mouth
[2:05:22] to mouth the prophet coming and that
[2:05:24] word making contact and a personal
[2:05:27] contact with the message that brought
[2:05:29] the child back to life you can't take
[2:05:33] briefcase and belt buckles and tats and
[2:05:35] everything else and bring somebody to
[2:05:36] life ain't never gonna work what are
[2:05:41] they doing the Old Testament they took a
[2:05:42] relic of the prophets ministry set it up
[2:05:45] that brazen serpent and they set up as a
[2:05:47] place of worship and it was an artifact
[2:05:49] and a relic of the prophets ministry but
[2:05:51] there was death in that what happened
[2:05:54] when they did that it closed the doors
[2:05:55] of the church better Ben even prophesied
[2:05:59] he said one day they'll set up some
[2:06:00] system that close the doors of this
[2:06:01] tabernacle and the doors are closed but
[2:06:10] he Elijah raises the son of the
[2:06:12] shunammite woman and in this it declares
[2:06:15] the mystery of the friendship because
[2:06:18] when the god Lord first inspired the
[2:06:19] sermon to me it was quicken to me just
[2:06:21] very immediately the reward of Elijah
[2:06:23] Elijah's reward power over death and I
[2:06:26] kept thinking that's a Prophet's reward
[2:06:28] power over death power for death and
[2:06:30] immediately as soon as that thought came
[2:06:31] in mind this thing said the rewards to
[2:06:33] be a friend of a prophet I was like well
[2:06:35] that's true but the reward is power over
[2:06:37] death reward is in a time of death it
[2:06:39] and it was
[2:06:40] so vivid to me and this voice said but
[2:06:42] the frit is to be a friend of a prophet
[2:06:44] and I was really struggling with it
[2:06:45] finally the Lord anointed it the sermon
[2:06:48] I've got to preach this and I thought
[2:06:49] you know what I've got to preach this
[2:06:51] but I don't want the people to think I'm
[2:06:53] taking away from the message so I'm
[2:06:55] gonna acknowledge that this is what
[2:06:57] brother Branham said and what I'm
[2:06:58] inspired to preach I'm not adding to I'm
[2:07:00] not takin away but we can see this
[2:07:02] pattern in Scripture we can see this
[2:07:04] teaching the message so it doesn't take
[2:07:06] away and it doesn't add to what brother
[2:07:08] BAM said about receiving a prophet you
[2:07:10] receive a Prophet's reward and that
[2:07:11] rewards to be a friend of a prophet and
[2:07:13] so I took this quote and I was gonna
[2:07:15] copy-paste it put it in the front of my
[2:07:17] notes to acknowledge it before the
[2:07:19] people and as I went back and read it
[2:07:20] well that wasn't my conscience talking
[2:07:24] that was God talking he was like go back
[2:07:28] and read what brother Branham said
[2:07:30] brother Branham if you have time please
[2:07:32] explain Matthew 1041 I would like to
[2:07:36] know what is a Prophet's reward
[2:07:37] all right everybody stand up shake
[2:07:41] yourself romancin if you're not
[2:07:43] wide-awake you'll miss it touch somebody
[2:07:46] say wake up raise the Lord come on
[2:07:56] bodily exercise profiteth little I could
[2:07:59] use a little profit
[2:08:01] hey man you may be seated cuz I'm just
[2:08:03] I've just hit my halfway point alright I
[2:08:12] hope you got a little bit of energy
[2:08:13] because listen I don't want this to fall
[2:08:15] flat
[2:08:16] I'm tired of preaching sermons and
[2:08:19] people say remember there and I almost
[2:08:20] ran
[2:08:24] almost that's what my ministry can
[2:08:27] produce almost running I can't wait till
[2:08:31] I sit under a preacher who brings it
[2:08:32] brings the run in he says brother man if
[2:08:36] you have time please explain Matthew
[2:08:37] 1041 I would like to know what is a
[2:08:40] Prophet's reward a Prophet's reward is
[2:08:42] to be a friend with the Prophet and if
[2:08:44] they want to know what a Prophet's
[2:08:45] reward is is to be a friend of a prophet
[2:08:48] see that's a reward he's your friend
[2:08:51] like the shunammite woman hey it might
[2:08:57] come in handy sometime he brings it
[2:09:04] right down to that relationship is to be
[2:09:07] a friend but what benefit is this
[2:09:09] friendship Oh hallelujah
[2:09:13] like the shooter my woman it might come
[2:09:17] in handy sometime it did with her watch
[2:09:20] God's service when did it come in handy
[2:09:24] for the shoot of my woman when her son
[2:09:26] was dead when a room was dead hallelujah
[2:09:31] a friendship with the Prophet comes in
[2:09:34] handy in a time of death here's the
[2:09:39] ultimate reward of malachi for her
[2:09:42] brother branham's ministries pointing to
[2:09:44] something he wasn't just let's just get
[2:09:46] through this question let's just move on
[2:09:48] to the next one he says that three times
[2:09:50] is to be his friend it's to be his
[2:09:52] friend it's to be his friend and how he
[2:09:55] gives us a prophetic clue like the
[2:09:58] shunammite woman he's saying something
[2:10:01] to his Saints listen some people may
[2:10:04] take this it means to be a friend or I
[2:10:05] can be a friend or I can be a friend but
[2:10:07] no it's much more than that
[2:10:09] like the shunammite woman it might come
[2:10:12] in handy sometime why because the word
[2:10:16] of Elijah brings life brought life to a
[2:10:19] Barren womb brought life in a time of
[2:10:21] famine and it brings a resurrection like
[2:10:26] the shooter might woman it might come in
[2:10:27] handy sometime in second Kings chapter
[2:10:30] 13 verse 21 you find this third instance
[2:10:34] of a resurrection
[2:10:35] and they were going to bury a body and
[2:10:37] the enemy came as these men were digging
[2:10:39] a grade to bury a body and they got in a
[2:10:41] hurry and they took the dead man and
[2:10:43] threw a dead man on the bones of a
[2:10:45] prophet
[2:10:46] I want a dead man touch the bones of
[2:10:49] Elijah this dead man's body came back to
[2:10:53] life and listen if the dead bones of a
[2:10:55] prophet can bring a resurrection how
[2:10:58] much more can the Living Word of God
[2:11:01] how much can fresh manna how much can
[2:11:05] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[2:11:07] the son of man bring life in a
[2:11:09] resurrection how much more if the bones
[2:11:14] of Elijah can resurrect how much more
[2:11:16] can this message he had the message when
[2:11:25] there was death in the pot why because
[2:11:28] the spirit of Elijah is associated with
[2:11:29] resurrection it's associated with life
[2:11:32] which on the Baptist came of the the
[2:11:34] anointing of Elijah he introduced the
[2:11:37] resurrection and the life
[2:11:40] revelations chapter 11 verse 11 when
[2:11:43] that last time the spirit of Elijah is
[2:11:44] used what happens Elijah is resurrected
[2:11:48] every single time God uses Elijah
[2:11:51] resurrection and life is associated with
[2:11:53] it and listen the res the the Elijah
[2:11:56] Malachi 4:5 is no different his ministry
[2:12:00] is associated with power over death its
[2:12:03] associate with resurrection and rapture
[2:12:04] we must esteem the recompense of God
[2:12:08] there's a reward that's being held out
[2:12:10] to us for those of us who believe this
[2:12:11] message for this day what are these
[2:12:13] things come why do hardships come why
[2:12:16] does shame come why does reproach come
[2:12:17] because there's an ultimate objective of
[2:12:19] this message and it's not just to look
[2:12:21] good it's not to tickle our ears
[2:12:24] something make us feel special but the
[2:12:26] goal of this message is rapture and
[2:12:30] these things have got to bring it out of
[2:12:32] you so we've got to look at this and
[2:12:34] believe that there's a reward that's
[2:12:36] coming to those who hold fast brother
[2:12:40] man says he will come to back up his
[2:12:42] word and take his bride in the rapture
[2:12:43] he said there was three
[2:12:45] the first showdown was Mount Carmel that
[2:12:48] was Elijah at Mount Carmel Elijah was
[2:12:50] found at Mount Carmel the second was
[2:12:52] with Mal was Mount Transfiguration who
[2:12:55] was on Mount Transfiguration Elijah was
[2:12:57] there at Mount Transfiguration and the
[2:12:59] third will be Mount Zion and there has
[2:13:02] to be an Elijah before there can be on
[2:13:04] Mount Zion showdown and all of us were
[2:13:07] represented there amount Transfiguration
[2:13:09] and here we are the bride that
[2:13:11] represents the Saints that will not die
[2:13:15] [Applause]
[2:13:17] it might come in handy sometime Vanna no
[2:13:22] you like to shoot on my woman it might
[2:13:24] come in handy sometime well when will
[2:13:27] this message pay off I've been receiving
[2:13:29] dividends I've been receiving payments
[2:13:31] but one day one day the final playoff
[2:13:36] will come I'm living this life to live
[2:13:41] up there I'm not living for funeral I'm
[2:13:44] living for meeting in the air I'm living
[2:13:47] to put death under my feet I want to be
[2:13:50] the one that says devil get under my
[2:13:53] feet what is this last a showdown it's
[2:14:03] the rapture of the bride it's a showdown
[2:14:05] with death that's the reward of Malachi
[2:14:08] 4:5 Hebrews 11:5 to 6 by faith Enoch was
[2:14:12] translated that he should not see death
[2:14:14] now think of this because this holds a
[2:14:16] great type for us and it says now
[2:14:19] because remember in the beginning when I
[2:14:20] read verse 6 I said there's a mystery
[2:14:21] here because he says by faith Enoch was
[2:14:24] translated he should not see death and
[2:14:25] was not found because God had translated
[2:14:28] him for before his translation he had
[2:14:33] this testimony that he pleased God but
[2:14:37] without faith it is impossible to please
[2:14:40] him for he that cometh to God must
[2:14:44] believe that he is and that he's a
[2:14:47] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[2:14:50] Him so we can't just seek God we've got
[2:14:54] to believe he's a rewarder
[2:14:56] and if you want to have a faith that
[2:14:58] pleases God for a translation you have
[2:15:01] to believe there's a reward of
[2:15:03] translation if you want to believe God
[2:15:06] for power of her death you got to
[2:15:07] believe there's a reward for power over
[2:15:09] death my faith Enoch was translated that
[2:15:11] he should not see death because he had a
[2:15:13] faith he had a faith that pleased God
[2:15:16] he had a faith to believe walking with
[2:15:18] God could one day take him out of this
[2:15:20] earth so we have got to have the mindset
[2:15:23] of Enoch not that I'm just kidding
[2:15:25] through I'm just gonna barely survive
[2:15:26] but I am an overcomer and I'm not just
[2:15:31] overcoming Laodicea I'm not just
[2:15:33] overcoming temptation I'm not just
[2:15:36] overcoming dant
[2:15:37] I'm not just overcoming lust I'm not
[2:15:39] just overcoming the flesh but I will
[2:15:41] overcome SH and the world the flesh and
[2:15:43] the devil and Jeff will be put under my
[2:15:47] feet he's a rewarder you said Enoch was
[2:15:55] translated brother Baron said Enoch was
[2:15:56] translated from death by God's
[2:15:58] transforming power he says what did God
[2:16:01] do that for why he says for a type of
[2:16:06] the rapturing Church that's coming God
[2:16:10] did that for you he didn't just take
[2:16:14] Enoch off the earth because merely
[2:16:18] because his faith was so pleasing but
[2:16:20] because he saw in Enoch a pre figure of
[2:16:23] your faith and he wanted Judah know that
[2:16:27] a faith like that gives you power over
[2:16:30] death he took Enoch and Enoch and I said
[2:16:34] oh God thank you translating faith oh
[2:16:37] God
[2:16:38] I had no idea that I was so pleasing to
[2:16:41] you I had no idea that you loved me so
[2:16:43] much he said anak I do love you Enoch I
[2:16:45] do think your faith is pleasing but I
[2:16:47] did this so you could be an example
[2:16:49] because in the last days I want you to
[2:16:51] see look at that group there it's spirit
[2:16:53] and truth Tabernacles look at brother
[2:16:55] smiley they're in Okeechobee look at
[2:16:57] brother West go over there look at this
[2:16:59] brother in Boynton Beach look at that
[2:17:01] group in Miami look what all those
[2:17:02] Haitians have gone through look at all
[2:17:04] these troubles they've gone through see
[2:17:06] everything they're going through the the
[2:17:08] heartaches our grief the pain the
[2:17:10] difficult of the persecution I want them
[2:17:12] to be able to look back at you and know
[2:17:15] that their faith will one day bring them
[2:17:18] to a place where I'll take them home so
[2:17:23] I raised you up as an example yes Enoch
[2:17:27] I love you but in the I used you because
[2:17:30] I wanted my glory to be seen for you
[2:17:31] because you're holding a mystery that if
[2:17:33] a bride will walk pleasing to the Lord
[2:17:35] pleasing there's a rapture and this
[2:17:38] message has a reward of a rapture one
[2:17:40] day there will be a rapture as for type
[2:17:48] of the rapturing church that's coming
[2:17:50] and he says yeah Elijah was the same
[2:17:54] could you imagine Elijah making it a
[2:17:57] whirlwind of fire thank you lord thank
[2:18:01] you for this it's great translation
[2:18:03] there's Enoch and Elijah is just let me
[2:18:06] dramatize a little bit I'm not saying it
[2:18:08] is but listen Elijah's up there and he's
[2:18:10] saying man look at this
[2:18:11] I was translated I didn't have to die
[2:18:14] Enochs going you gonna tell him Lauren
[2:18:19] or do you want me to tell him
[2:18:22] aloud you you did good but listen the
[2:18:24] reason why he did that see those people
[2:18:27] in Boynton Beach see that brother there
[2:18:29] in West Palm see those believers there
[2:18:32] see those believers there he did it to
[2:18:34] me but the reason why he did it for me
[2:18:36] and he did it to you is because he want
[2:18:38] them to be able to stay in the last day
[2:18:39] he did it for me
[2:18:43] right maybe you don't know what it's
[2:18:47] like but I know what a slack everybody
[2:18:50] Enoch saying he did it for me he can do
[2:18:52] it for you Elijah saying he did it for
[2:18:55] me he can do it for you and the bright
[2:18:58] side he'll do it for me that's why your
[2:19:03] soul is rumbling hallelujah when the
[2:19:06] word is heard I got praises remnant wah
[2:19:11] there's a body being formed
[2:19:13] [Applause]
[2:19:16] hallelujah hallelujah I've been singing
[2:19:20] in a glorified body awaiting me why I've
[2:19:24] already strapped into eternity
[2:19:28] praise the Lord
[2:19:31] he says Elijah was the same this is the
[2:19:35] reward for the faith
[2:19:36] that's excited by the Ministry of Elijah
[2:19:40] the Elijah this hour what's the reward
[2:19:43] of malachi 4 for those who receive him
[2:19:46] this Ministry of Elijah holds the key to
[2:19:49] our reward encouraging us to press on
[2:19:55] encouraging us to despise the shame
[2:19:57] encouraging us to remain faithful
[2:19:59] brother Branham even said I was afraid
[2:20:02] of death he said I thought I would die
[2:20:05] and I'd be a cloud and I'd kind of float
[2:20:08] I think it might mention brother Neville
[2:20:10] float by wouldn't be able to hug him and
[2:20:12] he said I was afraid of death now how
[2:20:15] could you beat an enemy you were afraid
[2:20:16] of if you're afraid of that how could
[2:20:20] you ever beat it so he takes brother
[2:20:22] Brandon beyond the curtain of time why
[2:20:25] because he couldn't be afraid of death
[2:20:26] anymore and the spirit of Elijah had to
[2:20:29] encourage a bride to not be afraid of
[2:20:31] death so it takes them beyond the
[2:20:32] curtain of time he says I'm not afraid
[2:20:34] anymore why cuz he had to instill in you
[2:20:36] the confidence don't be afraid of death
[2:20:39] because you can't defeat an enemy you're
[2:20:42] afraid of it says in 2nd Kings chapter 2
[2:20:45] verse 11 his brother Branham says Elisha
[2:20:47] was the same he says it came to pass as
[2:20:49] they went on and talked that behold
[2:20:51] there appeared a chariot of fire and
[2:20:52] horses the fire and part of them both
[2:20:54] asunder and Elijah went up by a
[2:20:56] whirlwind into heaven
[2:20:58] this was Elijah's literal reward he was
[2:21:02] swept away by passing death that's what
[2:21:05] God demonstrated not only did he bring
[2:21:07] life in his own ministry raised the dead
[2:21:11] in his own ministry but even himself he
[2:21:13] was translated when up by a whirlwind
[2:21:17] into heaven and brother BAM says this in
[2:21:20] investments and God sent in a prophet by
[2:21:23] the name of Elisha to condemn that thing
[2:21:25] and after he got old and tired
[2:21:27] he was ready to go home and he didn't
[2:21:29] even have to die listen his payoff come
[2:21:33] his reward came also his payoff come
[2:21:37] also God just sit him down a chariot and
[2:21:40] some horses and packed him on up into
[2:21:42] the heavens that was his reward then he
[2:21:47] says when he's preaching the Laodicean
[2:21:48] Church age Elijah did not have to die he
[2:21:52] was translated and was taken up into
[2:21:54] heaven a type of the church at the end
[2:21:57] of this Elijah that will come why did he
[2:22:01] do it as a type for the bride that comes
[2:22:04] after the anytime Elijah the type of
[2:22:07] that church at the end of this Elijah
[2:22:08] that will come at the end of his time
[2:22:10] the church will go on the rapture
[2:22:13] without going through the shadows of
[2:22:15] death it will be the rapture this is the
[2:22:20] bride's reward this is the reward of
[2:22:23] Malachi for want to say about Abraham he
[2:22:26] was a friend of God what happened he
[2:22:28] received strength received a young body
[2:22:33] this is to receive a prophet you receive
[2:22:36] a Prophet's reward it's become a friend
[2:22:38] of a prophet how many of you are Friends
[2:22:40] of the Prophet it's gonna come in handy
[2:22:44] it's gonna come in handy like the
[2:22:47] shooter might woman it's gonna come in
[2:22:48] handy
[2:22:49] this my son who is dead is alive again
[2:22:52] this womb that couldn't conceive life is
[2:22:55] going to come this song that fell away
[2:22:56] he's going to come back life is going to
[2:22:59] come why because I'm under a promise
[2:23:02] like the of my woman it'll come in
[2:23:06] handy sometime that's the purpose of the
[2:23:10] elijah ministry not only to restore the
[2:23:14] faith but to bring us to a rapture in
[2:23:16] faith because the restoration of Elijah
[2:23:20] is not only a restoration back to
[2:23:23] Pentecost the original Pentecost back to
[2:23:26] the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts
[2:23:27] but it's a restoration back to the
[2:23:29] Garden of Eden Christ the mystery of God
[2:23:31] revealed it's all the way back to the
[2:23:33] Garden Avene where he said there was no
[2:23:34] fear and there was no death he said you
[2:23:39] have to be raised up in the faith of
[2:23:40] this hour
[2:23:42] what are the holy Oracles of God what is
[2:23:44] the lucian of these seals what is what's
[2:23:46] containing it your rapturing faith
[2:23:47] that's the season we're living in and so
[2:23:51] I want to share with these last
[2:23:53] statements here I'm just kind of I'm
[2:23:55] winding it down here and the message
[2:23:59] inspiration it's just a very vague
[2:24:00] general statement you can't really
[2:24:02] derive much from them I heard somebody
[2:24:08] say one time ministers say I'm closing
[2:24:10] so much you start to wonder how many
[2:24:11] doors they've gotten their sermon he
[2:24:21] says someday brother when the Sun
[2:24:24] refuses to shine when the moon goes down
[2:24:27] the stars hide their faces from the
[2:24:29] earth
[2:24:30] the last sermons preached in the Bible's
[2:24:32] lane closed churches blown into bits and
[2:24:34] the rocks are convulsing and crying out
[2:24:35] I want to know him as the poet and the
[2:24:39] song said I can see Adams shake Eve and
[2:24:41] say Eve this is it honey
[2:24:42] Eve reaches over and shakes Abel and

[2:48:26] oh my what a benefits for believing the
[2:48:33] message it's a message that gets you
[2:48:36] prepared for this rapture I was just so
[2:48:40] taken by that quote brother Aaron was
[2:48:44] reading about just being a friend of the
[2:48:46] Prophet a man and you know you look at
[2:48:49] that and say you know we you know just
[2:48:54] just kind of being buds of chaps with
[2:48:57] the with the Prophet none of us had that
[2:48:58] opportunity so you have to go deeper
[2:49:01] than that what do you say like the
[2:49:03] Shulamite one you know and as I was just
[2:49:06] looking at that I thought about the
[2:49:07] situation where for the random was
[2:49:10] passing through Timothy was that
[2:49:13] Tennessee I believe it was and it's
[2:49:15] playing got a pool town all because of a
[2:49:19] woman that was spraying a man up prayers
[2:49:23] cause mechanical problems on a plane to
[2:49:27] pull it down and not just pull it down
[2:49:29] keep it down please stay down into her
[2:49:35] knees with cement
[2:49:37] she had a specific prayer God had a
[2:49:42] specific answer she say I'm your
[2:49:45] Shunammite she could identify herself in
[2:49:48] Scripture
[2:49:50] she say I know I'm the shunammite but
[2:49:53] where is Shirley Lysa so since she had a
[2:49:58] specific question God had to bring the
[2:50:00] specific answer and Elijah happen to be
[2:50:03] flying across
[2:50:05] I stayed at the time brought him to the
[2:50:08] airport
[2:50:09] put him in uh in a hotel room cause him
[2:50:12] to get up the next morning test to start
[2:50:14] walking down the street she's singing ah
[2:50:17] he's singing I'm so glad I can say I'm
[2:50:20] one of them didn't know which way he was
[2:50:22] headed but he say I'm just going by
[2:50:24] faith and as he's singing with the right
[2:50:26] attitude this woman say good morning
[2:50:28] parson well read him say how you know I
[2:50:33] was a parson say what God showed me in a
[2:50:37] dream that you were becoming the only
[2:50:38] thing missing is your briefcase say yeah
[2:50:42] that's back at the hotel and she just
[2:50:44] began to tell a story and there a boy
[2:50:47] was facing death he was he was saying it
[2:50:51] it's dark in here it's dark in his
[2:50:53] talking but when the spirit of Eliza
[2:50:55] passed to that room death had to back up
[2:51:01] [Applause]
[2:51:02] [Music]
[2:51:04] no longer could dare stay there even
[2:51:07] with a simple prayer death could not
[2:51:11] remain there there's a reward for
[2:51:13] believing this message I just might as
[2:51:19] well say I can't see a rapture outside
[2:51:24] is that too hard for people I can't see
[2:51:28] rapture outside of this message it's the
[2:51:32] only thing that prepares us I know
[2:51:33] forget upset when you say things like
[2:51:36] that but do you know in the days of
[2:51:39] Moses there was no deliverance from
[2:51:42] Egypt if you couldn't follow the message
[2:51:48] you know what the message was put blogs
[2:51:50] on the top of the doors on the side
[2:51:52] posts and if you can follow what the
[2:51:55] prophet Moses were saying that was
[2:51:59] coming the only way you receive life in
[2:52:03] your household was to receive the
[2:52:06] message for your day the types are all
[2:52:10] their church don't let this go over your
[2:52:13] head
[2:52:13] God's given you something precious God's
[2:52:17] giving you something
[2:52:18] he's giving you the way of escape all
[2:52:20] you got to do is take it you reject it
[2:52:22] that's on you
[2:52:23] but God has given it to you I thank God
[2:52:25] for this word I thank God for this word
[2:52:28] I thank God for the word
[2:52:30] [Applause]
[2:52:35] it's not gonna be easy you take this

[2:56:47] he can the scripture tells us that he
[2:56:49] would he would go out willingly from a

[2:59:01] brother Aaron was hitting tonight about
[2:59:04] we're not we're not living to the death
[2:59:08] for a funeral preparing for a funeral
[2:59:10] and I thought that was a very fitting
[2:59:13] because leave brother Jerry was telling
[2:59:16] us on Friday night he says he believes
[2:59:19] this is a generation that's gonna see
[2:59:21] the rapture and with this being that
[2:59:24] generation the devil comes against this
[2:59:26] generation harder than any other
[2:59:27] generation but this is the generation
[2:59:30] that will overcome I believe that and I
[2:59:33] and I tell you even though I might not
[2:59:35] be one of the young people know more I
[2:59:36] believe just like Caleb incident to the
[2:59:38] promised land I can enter into a rapture
[2:59:40] I'm holding on with everything I got
[2:59:43] Amen god bless you all
[2:59:45] praise the Lord
[2:59:50] the brothers will come in dismiss you
