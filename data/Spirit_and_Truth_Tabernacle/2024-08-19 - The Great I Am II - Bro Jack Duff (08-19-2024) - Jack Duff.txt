uh the reading of the word we thank you for all that has happened thus far in the service uh how we appreciate the spirit of the Lord just meeting us here in a special way but we come to this portion of the service where we get our strength where we get our nourishment where we get everything we need to be able to overcome the enemy father we pray that you would just continue to reveal and open up our understanding as we go through the word today take control over every thought that is being presented take control over every thought that is being received and father may you get all the glory and all the honor from our gathering it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen in the presence of of the lord we are uh continuing a journey we started on last week with the thought of The Great I Am amen The Great I Am and there are a couple things that I have in my spirit and I I I don't know uh which way things will go but um I won't release this I won't be released from this thought until I get all those things out of my spirit uh but we we we we started this last week I was explaining amen a uh a quote that I was a sermon I was listening to recently perfect faith and as I was listening to that uh brother Brandon was talking about a young man who was being criticized because he believed in Divine Healing and uh so he says you know he get moody sometime y'all heard me uh quote that and he was talking about how sometimes Satan throws things in his face and then when God uh performs a miracle uh he loves to throw that right back at the Devil and say what about that sometimes you have to uh uh reflect on what God has done and throw things right back at the Devil don't don't sit and let him just talk to you all the time you know what you can can do you can talk to the devil and and I even when he ain't saying nothing to you you can go to him now what about that did you hear that testimony did you hear what God did for my brother did you hear what God did for my sister what about that and and because that begins to build your faith where you realize if God Did It For My brother or my sister then that same God is capable of doing it for me praise the Lord so this young man you know heard these people criticizing Divine Healing and and then he knew that there was a situation in their in their Community where this lady had been diagnosed with cancer but uh and everybody just kind of gave up on this lady but when when the Lord touched her uh he went to these critics and said what about that what I mean now you talk about divine hilling a't right but what about that you know you say God is not the same yesterday today and forever but what about that so he began to you know kind of put them in a place and brother Brandon made the statement say no he he he is The Great I Am Not the I will be not the I was but he is the I am and I like him uh even revealing himself to Moses when Moses want to know what is your name you you want to send me down here to the to to uh the the the children of Israel but they're going to ask me well what is his name what's the what's this God that you're talking about that we that we all serve but we want to know his name name he said well you just tell them that I am that I am has has sent you down and and when God took that name with with with with Moses what he did was take a present tense name for every generation oh Hallelujah he is not just a God that opened up a Red Sea for the children of Israel if you are facing a Red Sea this morning the I am is still present yes he is hallelujah he is the same yesterday today and forever and often times we have to be reminded of who our God is and and and and hopefully in this in this in this journey we'll find out not only who our God is but if that God is dwelling on the inside of you then it's time for you to recognize who you [Applause] [Music] are yeah there's been many of testimonies of God moving in our midst and I I I went through a number of scriptures on last week I didn't finish him so I want to just kind of pick up on some more um Moses could have went back when I'm I'm sorry yeah when God told Moses um I am that I am you know he could have went back in scripture and found where God used that title in other situations when he spoke to Abraham there in Genesis 15 151 we talked about it he told Abraham I am thy shield and thy great reward amen I'm I'm I'm your Shield I'm where you place your faith amen I'm your shield and I'm your exceeding great reward and he uh you know there's many things that he could have looked back at and and there was one that I ended up on out of Song of Solomon 2 uh verse one says I am the rose of Sharon amen and the lily of the valleys and I wanted to read a quote that goes along with that particular verse of scripture out of the message the seed of discrepancy Amen brother brandom tells us here in this sermon he says but when it comes to that name of Jesus Christ they walk just as far from it as they can now you know people don't want you to pray anymore in the name of the Lord Jesus uh you know that you can you can say all kind of other things but just don't use the name Jesus right but when it comes to that name of Jesus Christ they walk just as far from it as they can they don't want nothing to do with it for he is the word and the word declares itself notice the only way of Escape he is the rose of Sharon the Bible said he was every title in the Bible uh of God uh of God belongs to Jesus Christ he was Alpha Omega the beginning and the end he he that was which is and shall come the root and offspring of David both root and offspring of David amen the Morning Star the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the alpha omega father son Holy Ghost amen all in Jesus Christ he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell Among Us that's exactly what he was he was the Ros of sharing what did they do with the rose of sharing they squeezed it out come on they mashed it out to get the perfume out of it and and this is what I was referring to Amen on last week brother brother Smiley talked about that process amen and and many of us don't realize when we're going through trials and tribulations we're just going through a process amen it's not that God forgot about you it's not that God can't change your situation just like this but God is to Tak you through a process Amen in order to get his glory out of you hallelujah amen to get his character formed in you so so he says uh uh it's squeezed out mashed out to get the perfume out of it a beautiful rose has to be squeezed down to get the perfume from the rose and that's what a beautiful life there never was a life live like it but it had to be squeezed out on Calvary see they took the anointing of the Rose of Sharon and put it upon Aaron he had to be Anointed with that for to go in before the Lord in the Holy place in the Holy Veil he had to be Anointed with the rose of Sharon to go in to sprinkle The Mercy Seat each year and that anointing must be upon him a sweet smelling Savor unto the Lord packing the blood of the lamb before him after he had also been sprinkled by the lamb uh pom pomegranate Bells around his garments he had to walk a certain step playing holy holy holy unto the Lord now this is the priest that he's talking about now and we want to we don't want to just leave this back in the in the Old Testament amen even today with everything we do to do for the Lord we have to live a life that is Holy Holy Holy unto the Lord I can't come up here and preach and my life is filthy filthy filthy I gotta have holy holy holy unto the Lord you can't come up here and sing if your life is filthy filthy filthy your life got to be holy holy holy unto the Lord you can't get on the piano the instruments and play if your life is filthy filthy filthy but your life must be holy holy holy unto the Lord yes sir am glory to God we required to live a life of Holiness he says notice he is that Rose of Sharon that sweet smelling Savor the anointing upon his people you cannot come before him with any Creed any other thing but anoint it with that Rose of sharing the word he says and he all he also is the lily of the valley now how do you get opium he says you get opium when you take a Lily and squeeze it out you get opium doctors use it in their Laboratories take a man that's nervous and look at this not only that not only a man that's nervous but a a man that's flustrated and if I can just use that a man that's frustrated praise God Amen sometimes when we go on through trials and tribulations you can see the frustration amen it comes out brother brother Wesco used to make a statement he says don't tell us that you're in the fire because we smell the smoke we smell it all over you amen we know you in fire because everything around you just show that you in fire but one day you realize you're going to come out of that fire and the and the and the fire is there in order to take you through a process amen like like uh in in the when when they when they take gold and they put it in the fire the the very purpose of putting it in the fire is so that and not only put it in fire oh my they beat it while it's in the fire amen they they hit it here and they hit it there and there's one purpose that amen Thea has in his mind he said I got to see my reflection in the gold before I can pull it out of the fire you're not going to escape this trial until God can see his reflection inside of you yes sir you can run from here you can run to there but you going to keep going through that Tri until God can see his reflection in you yes amen so it's time just to start thinking God for what we're going through amen no complaining thanks hallelujah hallelujah he says so so when a man get nervous or frustrated or I'll use the word frustrated or a woman she feels like she's going to go crazy amen he says uh uh she's walking the floor and screaming she's in hysterics a doctor will take a little of his Lily opium and push it into a arm or vein somewhere or or his and then quiet and down it's all over for a while but just as soon as that opium dies out here they come again worse than they ever was glory to God Amen we he's the lily of the valley and amen the the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley now now now what what what we're what we're trying to get you to see is that amen and in the natural there their their their uh healing process only lasts for so long the opium that the doctor used only lasts for so long amen but but if you can ever get in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ amen he can take care of that issue he can give you peace in the midst of your storm he says this but I'll tell you friends that's the only type of genuine opium from the lily of the valley that I know of he is the lily of the valley he was squeezed out on Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed and that the squeezing out of the flower he was a flower he was the greatest flower to ever grow was the lily of the valley and this great Rose of Sharon now he hangs tonight sped between heavens and earth I believe he was the time uh rather to take away the sin of the world Amen and to bring healing back to the world and the Bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever if you need a little Healing Touch just turn to Jesus amen he is the The Great I Am he is the great I am just a few more scriptures of who this I am is uh Malachi 3 and 6 Malachi 3 and6 hallelujah hallelujah says for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed I am the Lord and I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consume John 6 verse3 33-35 it tells us who this I am is The Great I Am he says for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then they said unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life amen he that cometh to me shall never hunger glory to God and he that believe on me shall never thirst glory to God I am the bread of life amen uh Revelation 1 and8 praise God it says this amen I am Alpha glory and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is hallelujah and which was praise God Amen and which is to come the almighty and again when you look at him as Almighty he's the breasted God now sir you can go and get some strength from the breast at God Amen Revelations uh 1 verse1 17-8 it says this and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand uh upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Glory I love this I am amen I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death this some powerful powerful things he got the keys in his hand amen uh Revelation 22:16 praise God it also says I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto thee these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star glory to God all right I want to just kind of catch uh something here as I as I move into one of my turns amen here in the message recognizing your day in its message now when I when I quote from this the first thing sometimes when I when I'm just giving you the title where I'm I'm I'm getting the quote from the title itself is a sermon right hello and notice now a prophet steps out amen onto the platform he says recognizing your day and this message and he preaches that for you right so so now I want to I want to just kind of catch something here Amen in in this quote he says if they only recognize the promised sign of the Messiah uh the sign of the son of man he come in the name of the son of man Hallelujah now he was in the name through the Pentecostal age and the Holy Spirit Son of God now the next thing is the Millennium the son of David Three Sons same God same father son Holy Ghost same God Son of David Son of God all right uh he said Son of son of David Son of Man Son of God it's the same God God all the time just in three different office works now I just don't have time to to to work with that but there's a sermon just right there we can talk about him in his son of God work we could talk about him in the son of David work right which is a millennium time but but we also we can see him as a son of man a prophetic office sir yes sir and and I'm here to tell you Amen brother Brandon was not the son of man but what brother Brandon was is a son of man revealing the son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ sir amen and every Prophet should have been pointing us to Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me go on a little further he says so is um uh so is Father Son and Holy Ghost not three Gods but the same God and three dis dispensations three office works as Father Son and Holy Spirit but like today oh my traditional blinded like they like like they was then traditionally blinded they don't see it why can't they see it they never will see it remember that thus sayth the Lord says why are you saying it then just the same as John did as the same as the rest of them there there is one sticking here and there see this this message only going to find just one here and one there I remember sister said we going to pray that the church be full and I say full of what I'm not here to try to win all West Palm Beach but the reason I'm here cuz there might be one seed here in West Palm Beach that I'm looking for praise God but we not here to win the whole city we not trying to be a mega church we we we want to be full of Believers glory to God and I know I know when this message begins to come across the people it's hard for them to believe everything this message says there's a lot of folk that want the Miracles of it they want those manifestations but they don't want the life of it praise the Lord let me go on a little further he says he says tradition tradition blinded like they was then traditionally bind they don't see it why can't they see they never will see it remember that thus say the Lord say why are you saying it then just the same as John did the same as the rest of them then there is there is one sticking here and there that's got to be brought out oh sheep of God hear the voice of God my sheep hear my voice I'm going further the woman at the well and I found that this was in our reading today if you if you following the Bible reading plan the woman at the well and I'm going to just read this because I think it's important I want to I want to make sure we get it the woman at the well recognized her day remember recognizing your message in this day the woman at the well recognize her day now how did she recognize it oh my by the sign of the Messiah look at this now she was in a bad shape she didn't want to fool with them old churches the way they were doing it they were living every way and things they were doing she didn't believe in that stuff now even though she was living any kind of way come on now she didn't believe in that stuff but she know there would come one day now now how can the prophet say she ain't beli in that even though she living like that oh y'all she didn't believe in that lifestyle even though she was living that lifestyle how could the prophet say that because when the word struck this lady amen her response to the word showed that she didn't want to live that way this lady had things taught to her while she was in Sunday school and she believed the things that were talk to her she she she she said she said now we knew that when Messiah comes they told us this when Messiah comes he's going to tell us these things oh my God yes sir yes sir Oho Lord I I tell you the truth I'm I'm I'm I'mma uh I'm I'mma read this but then I want you to just pick up John 4 maybe about verse 22 somewhere around in there I got something I just need to show you right right in there right in there somewhere in there some all right uh let let me just finish reading this it says uh they were living everywhere and the things they were doing she didn't believe in that stuff but she know there would come one woman one day the poor little fell up there on the way to the well she found that thing that she was looking for when he began to reveal to her the secret of her heart told her the sin that she was living in she said sir I believe that you are a prophet not get up out my business see see her response not not now who you think you talking to no that that's that's the present day woman at the well but back then she sir I believe you must be a prophet watch this now now they hadn't had one for 400 years said I perceive that you're a prophet and I know that when Messiah cometh he'll do these things he said this lady met the I am yes he was in the flesh and when she met him in the flesh she took off running into the City come see a man that told me the things that I've done oh my look at this I am he she recognized there was no more question how can you prove it it was already proven Messiah cometh this is what he'll do what if she what if she can recognize it by the scripture can't we recognize the even lights and the sign of today we know when Messiah cometh he'll show us all these things he'll tell us this he said I am he that speaks to you no more question she went and and she told the people come and see here he is no more question to her it was settled because she recognized the day she was living in she recognized let's just pick up you know that in in John 4 this lady caught it and and and the prophet told that she didn't believe in the that that lifestyle the living that she that they were doing she didn't believe in that she didn't believe in it and you know you you just yeah let's just pick this up I'm G catch it in in in in in um in John 4 I I think around um let's start at 19 it says uh oh um now I I'm I'm I'm leaving a lot out but the reason that this lady come to the spot is because he told us said go get your husband and come and the lady say you know what I don't I don't have a husband he said you spoke the truth he said you don't had five husbands now wait a minute I want y'all to catch that now this ain't just five men that she lived with at different times no she was married five different times five husbands and then then he say this because you know can I just y'all Y can I be playing it's all right for me to be playing and I know y'all tell me to get out y'all business but but I'm going just say it the way Jesus said it right he said you had five husbands and then he say the one you living with you acting like that man your husband but that man is not your [Music] husband the one you living with right now is not your husband now when he did he did it privately with her but but he had to make sure she understood that this lifestyle that you living is not right the one you liveing with right now is not your husband and you know when when he when when when when when she when she heard that she didn't get offended cuz she didn't want to live that lifestyle that's right she Ain get off and people that don't want to live in sin they won't get offended by the word when you want to keep that lifestyle Hallelujah to the Lamb of God sister was just telling me how she lost a job because of her social media it doesn't uh it doesn't it's not an alignment with what they job some of the things that happened in that job and and social media on her social media she post scripture and and and these people in the in the job setting praise God you just be honest the the the homosexuals leading amen the company and they say now your your your position amen is not in alignment with where we are but rather than put it that way cuz they know to get a lawsuit they they just say we are at whe uh company we can just fire you for whatever we want to fire you for you just not a good fit that's all right I'd rather not be a good fit in this world that's right amen I'd rather be a good fit with God I want to hear him say I want to hear God say Well done thy good and faithful servant you've been Faithful over over over many uh into over a few things and ENT into the joys of the Lord so that's what we living for we're not living to please people we're living to please God all right I'm trying to get ahead I'm trying to get on up there y'all but but but but but you know Jesus had to deal with the sin problems of that day and we got sin problems today how many people streaming the service and you living with somebody that ain't your ain't your spouse but yet you going to church I want to make you feel uncomfortable get out that bed praise [Applause] God get your own place to stay until you get married now don't turn off the stream he told in verse uh uh verse 17 let's catch it there the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I I have no husband you telling the truth but Verse 18 thou for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that thou and and and that says Thou truly and look at her response the woman sath unto him sir I perceive now how did she get this perception because her sins were revealed and and now I want you to understand when when he reveals uh the secrets of her heart this in itself is the sign of the Messiah amen hallelujah this is the sign of the Messiah so she says this to him she says uh uh sir I I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers Worship in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship Jesus said and her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen it's not just the name of a church but this is the place you can find in Christ verse 25 says the woman said un him I know that I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he come he will tell us all things verse 26 Jesus sayith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and other words I am he sir amen I'm not a god of the past tense I'm not a god of the future tense I am his present tense and I'm right here talking to you and brother after that lady heard that she dropped her water pot took off running into the City and said come see a man who told me the things I done is not this the Christ let's go on that silent Messiah was done on her when the secret of her heart was revealed brother Brandon makes a statement there's a question that comes up in questions and answers a question that um that arises someone um uh ask a question says has the name of the Lord changed in the different dispensations brother brandom answers the question says yes yes it was once called he was called the I am he was called Jehovah and and he changed many times the last time it was changed was when God became flesh and took a human name Jehovah I am and all those are titles to a name see you you was baptized in the name of Jehovah he's asking the question it it have to be the name of Jesus Christ you was baptized in the name of Jehovah Rafa uh Jehovah Manasseh Jehovah Gyra all of those it it have to be Jesus Christ the I am is Jesus Jus Christ remember standing there that day and he said you say you eat Mana in the wilderness our fathers eat mana and are dead he said they said well we know now you're crazy because you're just a man and not over 50 years old and say you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am can you IM imagine standing there before all these religious leaders and Jesus makes a statement like this amongst all of these guys that have studied for years and it say before Abraham was I am now when the woman at the well heard him say I am he that speak to you she took off running but when he when he said these words to these religious leaders they were was ready to to crucify him oh my can I just ask a question who do you say he asked the same question he asked the same question to the Disciples of that day who do you say that I am let's keep reading say uh see say say you seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am see he was the I am and all the titles and names that ever belonged to God was made one human name the Lord Jesus Christ all right I want to pick up this in um John 8 because he he he's referring to this uh passage of scripture with that previous quote there about uh when Jesus comes in contact with the religious leaders of the day and he tells him um before Abraham was I am let's pick this up in John 8 verse 53 um let's let's actually I'm sorry I start at 52 then said the Jews unto him now we know that thou H has a devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death art thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead who makest thou thyself verse 54 Jesus answered if I honor myself my honor is nothing it is my father that honth me of whom ye say that he is your god let's go a little further oh my yet ye have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like unto you don't Don't Mess With Jesus you got questions for Jesus he got answers for you I should be a like like an a liar like unto you but I know him and keep his saying now watch this statement your father Abraham Rejoice to see my day not not just Rejoice to see my day and watch this one and he saw it and was glad let me keep reading then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and and hast thou seen Abraham Jesus said unto them oh my my my verily verily I say unto you that means surely surely I say to you before Abraham was I am and watch watch watch the next verse then they took up Stones not like the woman at the well now they took up stones to cast at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by they were getting ready to kill them in church the statement was made by Jesus he says your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad how will Abraham see the day of Jesus H how is it that ABR I mean Jesus was not even living during that time how did Abraham see the day of Jesus and rejoice in the day when he saw it can I just put it this way even right now we are seeing the days of Jesus and we can rejoice and be glad when we see it the same way Abraham saw it and rejoice we can see it and rejoice yes sir amen amen let me just break it down for you I want to make it make it very very clear but my question is how did Abraham Rejoice to see the day of Jesus and he wasn't living during that time the Lord Jesus the Bible says that he saw it and was glad now this is how Abraham saw it and was glad because there was one day that Abraham was sitting yes in his tent and while he was sitting in his tent he received three visitors sir Hallelujah the prophet tells us it was about noon time that Abraham saw amen these visitors show up three men showed up at one time and when Abraham saw them Abraham gave a title to one of them he says my Lord he didn't see three Gods he didn't see a father a son and a holy ghost he saw one God and he said my Lord one of the visitors begin to speak to Abraham and you know the the the thing of it is is and this is I'm I'm I'm I'm coming out of Genesis 18 right now but but but what he said when he when he called him Abraham this visitor Abraham knew something special about this guy sir why would he rejoice in seeing him because the chapter before his name was Abram but but but God gave him a part of his name he changed him from Abram to Abraham amen God was Elohim and he gave him the high ham he just add added something to his name praise God so so only only God that gave Abraham the name change would know that his name is Abraham when he says when he comes to visit him and he calls him by name yes sir begins to talk to him Abraham Abraham where is Sarah not only did he change Abraham's name he changed Sarah's name it used to be Sarah but now it's Sarah only God could change those names so Abraham's rejoicing to see this day yes while he's there talking with Abraham say where's Sarah your wife didn't say Sarai but where is Sarah your wife she was in the tent behind them you see the sign of the Messiah sir is when the secrets of the hearts are actually being revealed the reason the woman at the well a man could know that this was Messiah because the secrets of her heart the secrets in her life were revealed the reason Abraham could rejoice in that day is because the secrets of what was going on in their tent were revealed where's Sara wife oh she's in the tent behind me behind you okay um I'm going to visit you at the time of life and Sarah not Sarai Sarah your wife come on the name change prod doce something sir yes sir the name change was a a produ a character change you know even in the scripture y'all uh uh when you go I think it's Hebrews 11:11 it say even Sarah got faith to believe that she was going to have a promised son now and this story that I'm telling you she was laughing but something changed somewhere along the line that Sarah received Faith she went from laughing about her situation to having faith in and if you can stop laughing at your situation if you can stop doubting your situation if you can stop just believing only what the doctor said and only what this report say you can start believing what God has said when God speaks directly to you it elevates your faith that's my promise and I'm not going to let Let It Go when you get Faith like that you'll see things begin to change I don't want to just mentally agree with the word I need something to drop down into my heart underneath the fifth rib something I can hold on to when nobody else holding on with me I'm still holding on because God spoke to me yes sir hey The Great I Am he still speak Sarah began to laugh so I'm going to visit you at the time of life and Sarah your wife now I know you done tried uh Hagar that didn't work out did it Abraham when I when I when when God one God God one one playing games he want Miss some words Sarah and I know I know you don't went down into different cities you get afraid down there and you didn't tell them people who she really is you tell him y that this my sister no no no no no no no I want I want to make it very clear Sarah your wife she going to have a child she G to have a son bible say that Sarah began to laugh and with the angel or God himself and the two angels there with him sitting there this is why Abraham rejoiced it to see the day of Christ and and the bible say that he was glad you know when he saw it he was glad I mean this is why because this was the son of Messiah happening right there to Abraham he say say say say why is Sarah laughing Sarah say uh no no no I was laughing I was like now Sarah come on now you know don't don't don't don't try that I I know you was laughing and you know was laughing but you know what it's okay even you trying to get out of it right now don't worry about it I know you was laughing but over the top of your doubt can I over the top of all your laughter I'm still making a promise to you and in your I don't care if you 90 years old Sarah you going to have a child this is is my promise to you and y'all Y y'all y'all heard me tell the story many times even when after this situation Abraham goes down there to G I believe it is aimc takes Sarah as it now this is after he told him Sarah your wife after he had a a a a direct visit from God and it say Sarah your wife can have a child he go right down there and give his wife over this is the second time now he gives her over to AMC and say now she my sister and God have to come down oh Lord have mercy and he have to tell this man while he's sitting there with his bedtime prayers thank you Father for sending me this wonderful woman 90 years old looked like she was 18 had been Lord I've been praying I wanted a really nice wife this man just brought his sister to me I didn't even go looking for he brought it to me Lord I Thank you for answering my prayer God say don't you touch that man's wife wife he said and she said brothers and sisters say I know what they said but that's his wife and you better not touch her cuz everything in your house will go Barren and then I kill everything around here too saying now here's the thing I want you to restore that man his wife oh my God my God we're back in restoration restore that man his wife and then after you restore that man his wife have that man pray for you wow should he pray for me God he's a liar no he's not my he's not my liar he is my [Music] prophet and I know he down here doing things he not supposed to do but it does not change his status with me oh I like that why can't it change his status because he has a part of the I am inside of him he's even got part of his name and Elohim don't change and neither does his [Applause] children when they reveal what was happening in the tent behind them that was a sign of the Messiah and that's why Abraham rejoiced to see the day that Jesus was speaking of he rejoiced to see it he was glad right uh that was verse 56 he says he Abraham your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad that's how he saw it oh my you know we lived in a in a in a time period where we had a prophet he pray for the sick and and when he prayed for the sick he said now I know people just hard hard time for you to believe but said let me just do something a little different and he turned his back to the audience and he said there's a sister over here on this side and and he would even tell them their name not even looking at them tell them what their condition was thus sayith the Lord you're healed the people had no idea that when he did this they were looking at the sign of the Messiah now now you can either respond like the r religious leaders of that day and say who this man think he is or you can be like the woman at the well sir sir I perceive that thou art a prophet [Music] gen Matthew 16:15-16 thank the Lord I got time to get all my thoughts out today he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and so you got to have your own Revelation as is what this is all about because Peter Peter had a revelation Peter said in verse 26 and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God I'm picking up Matthew 8 8-10 I'm making a little turn now my second turn and here it's good to know who he is but he also wants us to know who we are this man in Matthew 8 his name is the Centurion watch the language that he uses the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only yeah I just I I I was out visiting amen with brother Wesco this week and and I was talking with sister Wesco I said I just remember I think um yeah I remember we went to a meeting one time and I still remember the sermon brother Wesco got up there and preached speak the word only and then folk were like where this brother come from bro Wesco now he's already a tall man he was walking the chairs and all all kind of stuff I'm like what is I mean the the meeting was just never everybody going around speak the word on it speak the word on speak the word on I mean it was just it was contagious absolutely contagious but but look at this man he says he says but speak the word on and my servant shall be healed don't speak the doctor's report speak the word only and look at this look at this man he recognizes his position look at his language for I am and and and now Jesus makes a comment about this man because it says he say I ain't found nobody with this type of Faith a person that recognizes who they are in Christ for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he don't question me you don't sit around talking why I got to do that no he know my position and he know his position so if I say go you know what the Bible say he does he goeth oh come on somebody I I I'mma just I'mma say it like this Satan go [Applause] hallu and to another come and he come now I'mma tell you something y'all caught what I just said by faith you that you won't go back home with that devil and you'll put a steak down say what about that he didn't he tell you to leave so long so on byebye right go and he goeth and another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that follow verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel this is a me a man that recognizes who he is let me I got uh uh Lord h I think I want to I got to skip something here yes I want to go to the true Easter seal this might be the last one on on the page uh the uh Prophet says this speaking the other night on Abraham and the seed after him how that God showed through Abraham and how he justified him the the 12th chapter of Genesis and on down 16th chapter and how he confirmed the Covenant through S ification on the 17th chapter let him nurse from his breast draw in the Holy Spirit and then he confirmed or placed him like you've heard me preach the sermon of hear ye hymn took Abraham out and changed his name from Abram to Abraham give him part of his name Elohim h m then we find out that after that he appeared to Abraham now to his seed watch how he's done the seed the same way the seed of ab come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost manifestation of his name revealing of who he is that re the Revel that revelation of who Jesus Christ baptism in his name and so forth like that that Revelation dividing his name with his church dividing his name with his church calling them out then what did he do in that same church that he called his name Jesus name what did he do he appeared in the same form that he did to Abraham being able to discern the spirit discern Spirit behind him see appeared in that same name in that same thing in the same form we're just at the end of the road now we weren't living in the days where brother Brandon was turning his back some of us lived during that time but many of us didn't but I am here to tell you that uh there are many times that the minister comes up here and preaches something that you you know he has no idea that's going on in your house that is the sign of the Messiah can I put that again it's not the sign of the preacher It's The Sign of the Messiah that is in your midst kids have just done something you ain't even had a chance to tell the pastor and here it come right out of the pull pit get back in the C again now you know God was speaking to you today you should have been the first on the altar that's right it's a silent Messiah he is here he's the same yesterday today and forever let me catch this out of revelation of Jesus Christ out of the church age book brother random makes this statement and I and when I was wanting to make this turn I needed let me just say this sometimes you have thoughts as a minister and I and I I I knew that there was something here that I wanted to turn and and bring to show Who You Are The Great I Am is in you now and and and I want I want you to know who you are but but when when I'm thinking like that I always try to cement my thought with something that the prophet might have said so I went looking to search and search and then I found this one quote in the church his book I said there it is that's what I need to settle this in the church that's why no man can never come come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest he says the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us I I actually put this one right under Ephesian Church age there's a little line that I wrote there you'll find it there uh it says the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us he says how dare the hierarchy declare the leoty has no word to say each one has something to say oh my each one has something to say I like that each has a work each has a Ministry no side effects the Holy Ghost came at Pentecost and separate separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled where of Christ said at that day ye shall know that I am in my father I am I am I am at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you John 14:20 says The Great I Am the almighty God has come as Spirit to F his true church well where is the I am today it's in the Holy Ghost Field Believers amen hallelujah hey you not the our you're not I will be you are present tense I am amen because he is present tense I Am The Great I Am the almighty God has come in spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men among us but the whole true Cong true Congregation of the Lord is hold now now I catch those things the whole true congregation cuz every Church got Believers make Believers unbelievers but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit if if uh it is he the holy spirit that is Holy not the congregation of itself he said The Great I Am the almighty God has come to fill his his church so we find The Great I Am dwelling inside of Holy Ghost filled Believers and let me just give you a few scriptures that help you understand who you are Psalm 71 and7 Psalm 71 and 7 the bible says I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge hallelu my family look at me and think I'm crazy they don't understand why I I do this why y'all wear them skirts why y'all do this why I am hallu I'm a Wonder y'all can't figure me out and ain't no sense in trying to figure me out cuz I am as a wonder and I'm okay being that way too yes I am a wonder unto many they can't figure out figure me out in school they can't figure me out on my job my neighbors don't know who I am I am a wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge Lord Verse 18 in Psalm 71 now also when I am old and grhe headed forsake me not until I have showed Thy Thy strength unto the generation th power to everyone that is to come I I must have missed okay I I had to when I'm old and grhe headed when I am old I might get old and gray-headed but Lord don't forsake me when I get to that stage Isaiah 6 and five then said I wo is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts Psalm 139 and4 this ought to be one that you just keep highlighted every Bible you got for every young person this one is yours I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made I ain't got to add this and I ain't got to add that I am fearfully and wonderfully made I ain't got to take this away and I ain't got to add that God made me perfect I am fearfully and wonderfully made yes sir Hallelujah marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well Romans 1:16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek I am not ashamed Romans 8 37 through 39 this is we read a little early with G I mean Paul said if God be force and who can be against us and he said all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose but he says in this verse 37 n in all these things he's asking the question what's going to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus my Lord he said nay nay nay nay nay nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and look at what he say F oh tell your neighbor I am persuaded I I ain't talking about quitting I ain't talking talking about giving up I I I every day every day I am persuaded hallu they they they say they say something inside of me telling me you know that's something that's on the inside of you telling you that's the I am that lives on the inside of you oh my God my God like The Little Engine That knew he could you get from I think I can I think I can you get away from that type of thought process and thinking no no I ain't no I think I can when you get to the top of the hill and you start rolling down I knew I could I knew I could hallu brother everything your whole perception changes I for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor nor nor nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Galatians 2:20 says this I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live that means I used to live a different life but when Christ came in I start living the life that pleases Christ right it say he says uh and this life which I now live in the flesh I live live by the faith of the Son of God how could you have the faith of the Son of God you have to be dwelling hallu he got to be dwelling in you for you to have his faith amen I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Philippians 411 y'all going to stop we're going to stop complaining we're going to start praising God and thanking God for the process that we're going through it's it's all good it's all working together for good look at Philippians 4:1 watch this now not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatever state not whatever state I was or not whatever state I will be but wherever you are right now I have learned in whatever state I am therewith be content hallu I got these statements from the church age book that I wrote down and these are what I call I am statements and they coming from the church book and they also come from scripture first one says I am the very righteousness of God

shield and exceeding great reward Romans 8:37 actually tells you this I am more I'm more than a conqueror another statement Jesus said I will walk with him in white because I am worthy Revelation 3
