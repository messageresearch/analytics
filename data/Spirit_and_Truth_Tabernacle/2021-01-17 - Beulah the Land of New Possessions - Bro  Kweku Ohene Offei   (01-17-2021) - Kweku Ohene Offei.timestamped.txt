[4:40] jehovah's servant who hath believed our
[4:43] report
[4:44] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[4:47] revealed
[4:48] for he shall grow up before him as a
[4:50] tender plant
[4:52] and as a root out of dry ground he hath
[4:55] no form
[4:56] nor calmliness and we shall see him
[4:59] there is no beauty that we should desire
[5:01] him
[5:02] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[5:06] of sorrows
[5:06] and acquainted with grief we had and we
[5:10] hid as it were
[5:11] our faces from him he was despised
[5:14] we esteemed him not surely he had borne
[5:17] our grace
[5:18] and carried our sorrows yet we dared to
[5:21] steam him stricken smitten of god and
[5:23] afflicted
[5:24] but he was wounded for our
[5:25] transgressions he was bruised for our
[5:27] iniquities
[5:28] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[5:31] him and with his stripes
[5:33] we are healed all we like sheep have
[5:36] gone astray
[5:37] we have turned everyone to his own way
[5:39] the lord hath laid
[5:41] on him the iniquity of us all
[5:44] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[5:47] yet he opened out his mouth
[5:49] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[5:52] and as a sheep before his shears is dumb
[5:54] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[5:57] from
[5:58] from prison and he was taken from prison
[6:01] and from judgment
[6:02] and who shall declare his generation but
[6:05] he was
[6:06] cut off out of the land of the living
[6:08] for the transgression
[6:10] of my people was he stricken and he made
[6:13] his grave with the wicked
[6:15] and with the rich in his death because
[6:18] he had done no violence
[6:20] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[6:23] it pleased the lord to prove
[6:25] him he hath put him to grief
[6:28] when thou shalt make his soul an
[6:30] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[6:33] he shall prolong his days and the
[6:35] pleasure of the lord shall prosper in
[6:37] his hand
[6:39] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[6:42] and shall be satisfied by
[6:44] his knowledge shall many my righteous
[6:47] servant
[6:48] justify many for he shall bear their
[6:51] iniquity
[6:52] therefore will i divide him a portion
[6:56] with the grave and he shall divide the
[6:58] spoil with the strong
[7:00] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[7:02] death
[7:03] and he was numbered with the
[7:05] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[7:07] many

[56:39] taking time let's pick our bible
[56:42] it seems the lord has a few things to
[56:44] speak to us
[56:45] so we want to make it while the sun
[56:48] shine
[56:50] blessed be the name of the lord we want
[56:52] to go to book of
[56:54] isaiah the gospel of isaiah chapter 60
[56:58] verse 13 to 22
[57:02] isaiah 60 13-22
[57:06] to see what the lord has for us for the
[57:09] team
[57:09] or for the subject we want to speak on
[57:12] beulah
[57:13] the land of new possession beulah which
[57:16] if
[57:17] this is the third phase of that
[57:21] seminar we started last year so we want
[57:23] to continue and
[57:24] look it in another angle of what the
[57:26] lord is doing in this hour
[57:28] amen so let's read isaiah chapter 60
[57:32] verse 13 to
[57:35] 22 and when you go home try and read the
[57:39] whole book of isaiah study it
[57:41] it's you it's the lord is talking to you
[57:43] amen
[57:44] we didn't have time to read the whole
[57:46] chapter else we will read the whole
[57:48] chapter i rise and shine for the light
[57:49] is come
[57:50] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[57:52] you darkness
[57:54] shall be upon the earth but you will
[57:56] receive light
[57:57] for the sake of time let's jump to the
[57:58] 13th verse
[58:00] the glory of lebanon shall come unto
[58:02] thee the fair tree
[58:04] the pine tree the box together to
[58:06] beautify the place
[58:08] of my sanctuary and i will make the
[58:10] place of my feet glorious
[58:12] amen it's talking about you the builder
[58:15] land
[58:16] the sons also of them that afflicted
[58:18] thee shall come
[58:19] bending unto thee situations that are
[58:22] overwhelming
[58:23] will bow to you amen
[58:27] and all that despise thee shall bow
[58:29] themselves
[58:30] down at the source of thy feet and they
[58:32] shall call thee the city of the lord
[58:35] if you take the word of the lord yes
[58:36] you're going to be rejected you're going
[58:38] to be despised by your friends and
[58:39] even family but stick to the word of the
[58:42] lord
[58:42] they will come and bow to you amen and
[58:46] they shall call it the city of the lord
[58:48] the zion of the holy one of israel
[58:51] whereas thou has been forsaken and hated
[58:53] so that no man went through thee i will
[58:55] make thee
[58:56] an eternal excellence excellency
[58:59] now he started talking about a city we
[59:01] know the city of west palm beach
[59:03] but now it's switching to eternal
[59:05] excellent city
[59:07] what is eternity it's christ amen it's
[59:10] not the city of west palm beach or miami
[59:12] you are the city of the living christ
[59:14] amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[59:17] thou shalt whereas thou has been
[59:19] forsaken and hated so that no man went
[59:21] through thee i'll make thee an excellent
[59:23] eternal albedian eternal excellency a
[59:26] joy of many generations
[59:28] thou shall also suck the milk of
[59:30] gentiles of the gentiles
[59:32] and thou shalt suck the brace of kings
[59:34] thou shalt know that
[59:35] i the lord am thy savior and thy
[59:38] redeemer the mighty one of jacob
[59:40] for brass i will bring gold for iron
[59:43] i'll bring silva
[59:45] for wood brass and for stone's iron
[59:48] where you were lacking where you were
[59:50] missing the lord will give you abundance
[59:53] amen i'll also make thine offices peace
[59:57] and then exactly's righteousness
[1:00:00] violence shall no more be heard
[1:00:02] in thy land wasting no destruction
[1:00:05] within thy borders
[1:00:06] but thou shalt call thy walls salvation
[1:00:09] and i get praise how do you call
[1:00:12] salvation
[1:00:13] amen i can see something on the wall
[1:00:16] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[1:00:19] true worshipers
[1:00:20] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:00:22] in truth for their father
[1:00:24] search to worship him amen so even in
[1:00:27] our natural sense we've got
[1:00:29] our walls is being beautiful by
[1:00:31] salvation but it's not the wall
[1:00:32] the bible is talking about you are the
[1:00:34] wall amen
[1:00:36] your sistine element is the wall that
[1:00:37] the lord is going to beautify with
[1:00:39] salvation
[1:00:39] and blessings amen let's finish quickly
[1:00:42] so that you can take your seed
[1:00:44] the sun
[1:00:48] this uh verse 20 okay 19 the sun shall
[1:00:51] be no more
[1:00:54] the sun shall be no more thy light by
[1:00:55] day neither the brightness
[1:00:57] neither for brightness shall the moon
[1:00:59] give give light unto thee
[1:01:01] but the lord shall be unto thee an
[1:01:04] excellent and everlasting light
[1:01:06] and thy guard thy glory the sun shall no
[1:01:08] more go down neither shall the moon
[1:01:10] withdraw
[1:01:11] itself for the lord shall be the
[1:01:13] neverlasting light and the days of thy
[1:01:15] morning
[1:01:15] shall be ended thy people shall also be
[1:01:18] righteous
[1:01:19] thy people shall also shall all be
[1:01:21] righteous
[1:01:22] they shall inherit the land for for
[1:01:24] forever the branch
[1:01:26] of my planting the work of my hands that
[1:01:29] i may be glorified
[1:01:31] and the last verse is a little one shall
[1:01:33] become a thousand
[1:01:35] and small one a strong nation i the lord
[1:01:38] will hasten it in his time
[1:01:39] shall we be seated glory hallelujah to
[1:01:42] the name
[1:01:45] verse 21 says that people shall be
[1:01:46] righteous your loved ones
[1:01:48] people that you are praying for as
[1:01:50] esther prayed for his people
[1:01:52] for her people to be redeemed and the
[1:01:54] lord
[1:01:55] the king gave esther the favor to redeem
[1:01:58] the people of esther
[1:02:00] all your people all that you are crying
[1:02:02] for the lord gave it to you
[1:02:03] amen your family your loved ones the
[1:02:06] lord has already redeemed them before
[1:02:07] the foundation of the world
[1:02:09] and they are righteous amen a little one
[1:02:12] shall become a thousand
[1:02:13] and a small one a strong nation i the
[1:02:15] lord will hasten it in time
[1:02:17] amen god bless you we want to talk about
[1:02:20] a subject biula the land of new
[1:02:24] possession
[1:02:25] glory to the living christ and we want
[1:02:27] to tie in what
[1:02:28] the lord is doing on earth and then
[1:02:32] tie into the church and then tie into
[1:02:35] your individual life
[1:02:36] amen because before the lord does
[1:02:38] something on earth
[1:02:40] he manifests it he show it in in the
[1:02:42] heavens
[1:02:43] and when the bible talks about heavens
[1:02:45] heavens is a three-fold language
[1:02:47] one fold is the sixth dimension before
[1:02:50] anything manifests before a tree
[1:02:52] comes upon the earth there's eternal
[1:02:55] tree in the celestial dimension
[1:02:57] and the image the elevation is what we
[1:02:59] see around the cocoa trees
[1:03:01] and all the pine trees and different
[1:03:03] trees that we see around before
[1:03:05] a human being would drop upon the earth
[1:03:07] from the womb of their mother or from
[1:03:08] their lords or their father
[1:03:10] that human being is a seed of god and
[1:03:12] that human being was already existing
[1:03:15] not as a human thinking but as a
[1:03:17] theophany a celestial being
[1:03:19] and then the celestial being creates
[1:03:23] or drops a terrestrial aspect called
[1:03:26] brother
[1:03:26] brother salomon kobadaku
[1:03:32] give me your name gary god bless you
[1:03:35] so before but again existed he was in
[1:03:37] the man of god not
[1:03:38] as a thought of a human thought but he
[1:03:41] was a celestial being
[1:03:42] amen so he's eternal as eternal can be
[1:03:45] amen because he came from elohim so
[1:03:48] before the lord does something he he
[1:03:50] announces it in the celestial dimension
[1:03:53] and the second fruit of heaven is the
[1:03:55] skies
[1:03:56] because the first bible god created is
[1:03:58] not this paper bible that we read
[1:04:00] it's not the torah and the scroll but
[1:04:02] the first bible was the zodiac
[1:04:04] the nature the universe it's all the
[1:04:05] bible of god the sun
[1:04:07] is christ the moon is the wife of christ
[1:04:09] the stars are the manifold
[1:04:11] sons and daughters of god from adam to
[1:04:13] the last one the lord will ever create
[1:04:15] amen and the third fault heaven is the
[1:04:18] church
[1:04:18] that is you so we want to look at it in
[1:04:21] one fold so let's go to
[1:04:23] a few quotes just to create a background
[1:04:26] and then we go from there let's read
[1:04:28] from the
[1:04:30] the first six the first seal six
[1:04:33] three zero one one eight c
[1:04:36] one paragraph sixty two the first seal
[1:04:41] 630318 paragraph 62.
[1:04:45] he cometh in this age he's talking about
[1:04:47] christ the efficient age
[1:04:49] revealed sent the messenger paragraph 63
[1:04:53] notice what happens as we go along here
[1:04:56] is the plan of it
[1:04:57] the first things happen is this
[1:04:59] announcement in the heavens first
[1:05:01] that is before the lord will do
[1:05:03] something he announces it in the heavens
[1:05:05] the sixth dimension the zodiac
[1:05:08] and in the church what happens
[1:05:11] a seal is open what is that a mystery
[1:05:14] unfolded
[1:05:15] see and when a mystery unfold then a
[1:05:18] trumpet sounds
[1:05:19] it declares a war a plague falls and a
[1:05:22] church age opens
[1:05:24] see what is the war part the angel of
[1:05:27] the church catches the mystery of god
[1:05:29] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[1:05:32] he catches this mystery of god
[1:05:34] and then he goes forth to the people
[1:05:36] after the mystery
[1:05:37] has been given to him goes forth to the
[1:05:39] people what does he do out there he
[1:05:41] begins to proclaim that message
[1:05:43] and what does it start a war a spiritual
[1:05:46] war
[1:05:47] amen so just for you to know that before
[1:05:50] the lord will do something before the
[1:05:51] seven seals
[1:05:52] that we have now been revealed to us
[1:05:53] it's no longer mystery
[1:05:55] the lord revealed it in the zodiacs the
[1:05:58] lord
[1:05:58] revealed to the celestial dimension
[1:06:01] because he
[1:06:02] closed it he kept his secret from adam
[1:06:05] until the seventh angel messenger until
[1:06:08] 1963
[1:06:09] for six thousand plus years mankind
[1:06:12] didn't know those mysteries
[1:06:14] portion of the bible was mystery people
[1:06:16] read the book of revelation
[1:06:18] and they feel like it's some figurative
[1:06:19] language i think
[1:06:21] somebody told abraham that i think john
[1:06:23] uh had some hard paper
[1:06:25] and the puppet kind of got into his
[1:06:26] brain and he scribed a book of
[1:06:29] revelation because it doesn't make sense
[1:06:31] you know grasshoppers and uh a woman
[1:06:33] with a hair
[1:06:34] a grasp of the hair that just doesn't
[1:06:36] make sense but it's the word of the lord
[1:06:38] in cold form
[1:06:40] amen and when the time came the lord
[1:06:42] began to declare in the zodiac
[1:06:44] in the heavenly dimension in the church
[1:06:48] even in politics in science before the
[1:06:50] lord unveiled it to
[1:06:52] his people amen so whenever the lord
[1:06:54] wants to do something
[1:06:56] he proclaims it in the celestial
[1:06:57] dimensions first
[1:06:59] before he brings it to this earth i want
[1:07:01] us to read another
[1:07:02] quote from the message communion
[1:07:07] 620204 1962
[1:07:10] communion paragraph 74
[1:07:14] we see that the astronomers are
[1:07:16] predicting sometime
[1:07:18] in this early part or first part of the
[1:07:20] month
[1:07:21] beginning on the second or the fifth or
[1:07:23] somewhere along this month
[1:07:25] the indian astronomers predict that the
[1:07:27] world the world to blow to pieces
[1:07:30] and the american newspapers made make
[1:07:32] fun of it i do not believe that
[1:07:34] i do not believe that the walls is going
[1:07:36] to blow to pieces but i do
[1:07:37] but i do see it's wrong to make fun of
[1:07:40] it because something is fixing to
[1:07:42] happen one of these days something
[1:07:44] similar to that
[1:07:46] when the five planets mars jupiter venus
[1:07:49] and so on he didn't mention the two of
[1:07:50] them come fought into the
[1:07:52] orbit now that was their lineup they
[1:07:54] never have did
[1:07:55] it oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years
[1:07:59] ago
[1:08:00] but who was back there to know it now
[1:08:02] this is where i want us to know this
[1:08:03] word belongs to now he comes to the
[1:08:04] church
[1:08:05] paragraph 75 i predict that this has a
[1:08:08] spiritual application
[1:08:10] i believe that is the coming in of the
[1:08:12] issue of god
[1:08:14] that the great revelations of the word
[1:08:16] will be opened
[1:08:17] during this time remember the claim it
[1:08:19] was three stars
[1:08:21] came into their orbits when jesus was
[1:08:23] born and this
[1:08:24] is five and five is grace the number of
[1:08:27] grace
[1:08:27] there is a number of perfection five is
[1:08:30] the number of grace
[1:08:31] j-e-s-u-s that's jesus grace
[1:08:35] g-a-g-r-a-c grace faith f-a-i-t-h
[1:08:39] so forth number of grace god ever sends
[1:08:42] his power to the church
[1:08:43] it will be by his grace it will be
[1:08:47] the obedience of the people glory
[1:08:49] hallelujah
[1:08:50] let me repeat that if god will ever send
[1:08:52] his uh grace
[1:08:54] his power unto the church it will be by
[1:08:56] grace
[1:08:57] amen it's not going to be by the
[1:08:58] obedience of the people now if you flip
[1:09:00] it you say oh
[1:09:01] hallelujah praise god i don't have to
[1:09:03] obey god to get blessing
[1:09:04] hey let's go drink let's go party let's
[1:09:06] go have fun you know because god is
[1:09:09] going to bring his blessing anyway
[1:09:10] you never understood the word of the
[1:09:12] lord if that's what you think then you
[1:09:14] miss
[1:09:14] you miss the revelation entirely
[1:09:17] god is going to bring his blessing you
[1:09:19] you can't wait to get it you don't
[1:09:20] deserve it
[1:09:22] but by his predestination and his love
[1:09:24] and grace
[1:09:25] he forgive your sins and your errors
[1:09:28] and everything about you and give you
[1:09:30] his grace but you don't turn grace into
[1:09:32] this grace
[1:09:33] that oh praise god the lord is gracious
[1:09:36] whatever i do the lord loves me so i can
[1:09:37] do whatever i want
[1:09:38] i can go and kill i can go and run with
[1:09:41] women and men
[1:09:42] the lord doesn't care it means you have
[1:09:44] made the revelation you didn't start you
[1:09:46] didn't even get
[1:09:46] an iota of it but the grace is what you
[1:09:49] don't deserve
[1:09:51] you were supposed to be condemned you
[1:09:52] and i but he came down
[1:09:54] to give his life so that he died
[1:09:57] that you will give get life and life
[1:10:00] eternally
[1:10:01] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:10:04] glory hallelujah so that will be by his
[1:10:07] grace
[1:10:07] god sent anything it will be by his
[1:10:09] grace not our merits
[1:10:11] so it means so it may mean something i
[1:10:14] predict that
[1:10:14] there will be a change that's what i
[1:10:16] want us to note i don't know what it
[1:10:18] will be
[1:10:18] but i believe it's fixing to happen we
[1:10:21] are on
[1:10:22] it right on the if of it and if any man
[1:10:25] hungers
[1:10:26] let him come to christ if any man is
[1:10:28] thirsty let him come to christ
[1:10:30] he quenches the thirst he's the
[1:10:32] satisfier of all
[1:10:33] our thirst and hunger amen so whatever
[1:10:36] you desire
[1:10:37] just come to christ it's in christ he
[1:10:40] satisfied the thirst
[1:10:41] and quenches your hunger blessed be the
[1:10:44] name of the lord so before the lord will
[1:10:45] do something
[1:10:46] as we read from those two coats the lord
[1:10:48] already give a prelude of what he's
[1:10:50] going to do by sending it in the
[1:10:52] zodiacs and recently i think just barely
[1:10:55] a month ago
[1:10:56] but a jack preacher someone here it was
[1:10:59] wednesday service
[1:11:00] sometimes blessings a lot of deep
[1:11:02] revelation comes during the
[1:11:03] wednesday services sunday services
[1:11:06] sometimes it's just like
[1:11:07] sharing food everyone get their portion
[1:11:09] but when wednesday teaching
[1:11:11] fewer but merrier so let's let's try and
[1:11:14] make it to the wednesday service because
[1:11:15] certain things i preach on wednesday
[1:11:17] that you don't get them on sunday so i
[1:11:19] remember preaching about they talk about
[1:11:22] the two planets that line up that was in
[1:11:25] december
[1:11:25] somewhere 21st uh two planets which is
[1:11:29] uh saturn and jupiter line up and they
[1:11:32] call it
[1:11:32] the great uh what is it the greek
[1:11:35] junction
[1:11:36] is what conjunction thank you the great
[1:11:37] conjunction so that was the true planet
[1:11:39] and
[1:11:40] thank god god blessed by the jack i said
[1:11:42] wow the lord is doing something here
[1:11:44] why two planets why the great
[1:11:46] conjunction
[1:11:47] to the earthly man is beautiful the
[1:11:49] admired is the beauty of creation yes we
[1:11:51] all
[1:11:52] thank the lord for giving those things
[1:11:53] but there's spiritual connotation
[1:11:55] to the true conjunction let me just
[1:11:58] make sure i have the dates at the times
[1:12:00] right just give me one second
[1:12:04] it looks like
[1:12:07] i left one of my my notebook in the
[1:12:09] office
[1:12:10] oh it's right here it's hiding right
[1:12:12] here got it
[1:12:14] praise god hallelujah so now just right
[1:12:17] after that
[1:12:18] january 9th and january 12th
[1:12:21] there was another conjunction this time
[1:12:23] it was a triple
[1:12:24] conjunction now the two planets which is
[1:12:28] uh saturn and jupiter line up already
[1:12:31] the mercury the smallest planet also
[1:12:34] line up with
[1:12:35] these two planets in a form like a
[1:12:37] triangle
[1:12:38] and triangle is just a circle which has
[1:12:41] been
[1:12:42] extrapolated to get three corners so
[1:12:44] triangle is actually a circle if you
[1:12:46] remove that
[1:12:46] three corners you can form a circle out
[1:12:48] of the triangle
[1:12:50] it means the lord is doing something all
[1:12:51] the planets used to go by themselves
[1:12:54] now two planets line up they almost came
[1:12:56] close together
[1:12:57] they became a conjoint like so close
[1:13:00] according to scientists you can put it
[1:13:02] in your finger
[1:13:03] that is the wonders of the lord if two
[1:13:05] planets collide
[1:13:06] the whole orbit will change into chaos
[1:13:09] but there's
[1:13:10] a person who controls the planet the one
[1:13:12] who's put that planet into
[1:13:13] into creation you can let them come so
[1:13:15] close
[1:13:16] yet so they won't hit each other that is
[1:13:19] what the lord does
[1:13:20] amen the lord can permit trials and
[1:13:22] tribulation and the devil to push you
[1:13:24] so close to death but the lord will
[1:13:27] bring you right back to life
[1:13:28] because his love is greater than
[1:13:31] whatever any power
[1:13:32] can do amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:13:36] so now these two planets sorry these
[1:13:40] three planets
[1:13:41] line up on earth and according to
[1:13:43] scientists
[1:13:44] when those three planets line up they
[1:13:46] they don't happen usually but when they
[1:13:48] line up then there's something according
[1:13:50] to astronomical data we don't study
[1:13:52] astronomy
[1:13:53] but from the church it's aquarius
[1:13:56] gemini and libra also line up
[1:13:59] aquarius is the teaching ring the lord
[1:14:01] bringing the blessing
[1:14:03] gemini is a twin the blessings in double
[1:14:06] portions
[1:14:07] and libra is the fifone ministry what is
[1:14:09] a fight for ministry it doesn't
[1:14:11] mean but a jaguar
[1:14:18] it's all of us every one of us is a
[1:14:21] minis
[1:14:22] is part of the fifo ministry you might
[1:14:24] not stand here to preach
[1:14:26] but your your heart is your pulpit your
[1:14:29] life
[1:14:29] that you testify outside here is a fifo
[1:14:32] ministry
[1:14:33] amen mothers are fight for ministries
[1:14:36] sisters are fight for ministries
[1:14:37] brothers are fightful ministries
[1:14:39] children are fight for ministry the life
[1:14:41] the life of christ
[1:14:42] that you portray to people out there not
[1:14:45] necessarily here you can dress up here
[1:14:47] as a
[1:14:48] holy christian man or woman but if your
[1:14:51] life doesn't have till
[1:14:52] with your holiness then you are fake
[1:14:55] people will not see that life of christ
[1:14:56] in you
[1:14:57] but when jesus christ is on the center
[1:14:59] of your of your heart
[1:15:01] and when you have not even spoken people
[1:15:03] can look at you
[1:15:04] this lady this my co-worker this guy
[1:15:08] there's something about him i want to
[1:15:10] find out because there's a deep in you
[1:15:13] and that deep is calling is calling it's
[1:15:15] an attraction
[1:15:16] unto the person to see that there's
[1:15:17] something about you there's something in
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:19] and he find that that is christ in you
[1:15:21] and that is the fight for ministry so
[1:15:23] the libra
[1:15:24] is not just somebody who was born under
[1:15:25] the sound of libra but it's just for the
[1:15:27] whole body of christ
[1:15:29] glory hallelujah so this uh
[1:15:32] what they call it lines houses the
[1:15:34] zodiac houses also line up when you have
[1:15:36] this planet lining up
[1:15:38] and now in the wall sense it said we it
[1:15:40] outshed the earth into the
[1:15:42] air or the mind age remember when this
[1:15:45] is
[1:15:45] the the bible the lord uses certain
[1:15:48] elements of the earth
[1:15:50] god uses the earth the water the the
[1:15:53] fire
[1:15:54] and the air to manifest his glory now
[1:15:57] god use
[1:15:57] animals or creation like uh the lamp
[1:16:01] uh the bear is it a bear no i'm not
[1:16:04] talking about the bed
[1:16:04] the cow or the buu and also the ego
[1:16:08] and a man to manifest his attribute the
[1:16:10] messengers the seven church ages
[1:16:12] so the last messenger was under the sign
[1:16:15] of an ego
[1:16:16] he could see william brahm had a
[1:16:18] discernment he could turn his back
[1:16:20] at the audience and tell your name where
[1:16:22] you were born
[1:16:23] where you came from what sickness that
[1:16:25] the doctors cannot diagnose
[1:16:27] it wasn't william brown because jesus
[1:16:28] christ who took a redeemed son of god
[1:16:31] and used his flesh to manifest his glory
[1:16:33] just like he's taking your flesh
[1:16:35] and my flesh to manifest eternal
[1:16:37] attributes
[1:16:38] if you let him amen so that was and also
[1:16:42] that is going to usher the earth into a
[1:16:43] great technological advancement
[1:16:45] we know of ai artificial intelligence
[1:16:49] that is where we are going now right now
[1:16:51] when uh around the night
[1:16:53] uh about two decades ago the earth was
[1:16:56] ushered into the
[1:16:57] planet pluto took an influence on earth
[1:17:01] what was that influence great
[1:17:03] advancements in science and technology
[1:17:05] and communication
[1:17:06] there's communication people can live in
[1:17:08] uh on their moon they go to the moon
[1:17:10] and they communicate with people on
[1:17:11] earth there's communication everywhere
[1:17:14] you can just press button
[1:17:15] click your cell phone someone in asia
[1:17:18] africa will get it in instance just a
[1:17:21] second
[1:17:22] it doesn't have to be a you just press
[1:17:25] button age that's what the best i can
[1:17:26] call it
[1:17:27] because technology has gone is so
[1:17:29] advanced but now we are going to move
[1:17:31] into a higher
[1:17:32] version of that advancement way beyond
[1:17:34] what we have now
[1:17:35] we still have is it 3g now where are we
[1:17:38] going to
[1:17:39] 5g it shows that the more we do those
[1:17:42] things the more we bring
[1:17:43] problems upon ourselves because it goes
[1:17:46] it comes with cancer
[1:17:48] depression with the wi-fi that we use
[1:17:50] they have their effect
[1:17:52] of course the companies want to make
[1:17:53] their billions and trillions so they
[1:17:55] will not
[1:17:55] disclose everything to you but they have
[1:17:57] a deleterious effect on human body
[1:18:00] because sometimes when you when it
[1:18:01] happens to me personally when
[1:18:03] there's an incoming call and my phone is
[1:18:05] around me my heart miss a beat
[1:18:07] and i realize that the radiation is
[1:18:08] coming on so they affect our body
[1:18:11] the hanging of the vehicles pain pain
[1:18:13] they all affected that's why we don't
[1:18:14] live long like the time of
[1:18:15] the time of abraham or even about let's
[1:18:18] say five generations back
[1:18:20] people used to live more than they were
[1:18:21] strong they could walk from here to
[1:18:23] boca rat is what whatever they call it
[1:18:26] right people can walk from here to miami
[1:18:28] it's like a mystery walking to miami are
[1:18:30] you crazy
[1:18:32] what's wrong with you just even if you
[1:18:34] don't have a car just go by the bus
[1:18:36] get a train get to uber we have uber so
[1:18:39] we don't walk you know
[1:18:40] we have things are easy you just sit on
[1:18:43] the jet it will take you to asia
[1:18:45] like six eight hours it will take you to
[1:18:47] africa
[1:18:48] 20 hours you take you to india 21 hours
[1:18:51] so we've got all this technology yes we
[1:18:53] use them i'm speaking to a microphone
[1:18:55] we use them for the things of god as
[1:18:57] sons and daughters of god
[1:18:58] but it's got its negative aspect as well
[1:19:02] so the earth is going to go into science
[1:19:04] now there was it's even changing the way
[1:19:06] we fight
[1:19:07] militaries change it used to be we used
[1:19:10] to have the old fashioned way of
[1:19:11] fighting people military will meet
[1:19:13] like the bible times people fight
[1:19:14] soldiers will fight kill people no no
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:17] it's colloquia it's a kick let's use
[1:19:19] technology right
[1:19:20] we can send a missile into wherever you
[1:19:23] are
[1:19:24] we've got gps right global positioning
[1:19:28] what satellite
[1:19:29] one pastor one brother said he said a
[1:19:31] gas provided a
[1:19:32] spirit on the flip side on on the on is
[1:19:35] a type of the holy spirit
[1:19:36] so we have the holy ghost so now what
[1:19:40] they do is they
[1:19:40] use missiles to kill people
[1:19:44] there was one uh iranian scientist who
[1:19:47] was one of them who helped
[1:19:48] develop their new nuclear station in
[1:19:51] iran and israel you know iran and israel
[1:19:54] is so close
[1:19:55] so they find a way to eliminate him they
[1:19:57] didn't send a soldier
[1:19:58] they just sent a weapon a controlled
[1:20:02] weapon in his car and he blew him to
[1:20:04] pieces he just killed him
[1:20:05] so it's defining even how we're gonna
[1:20:07] fight
[1:20:09] countries are gonna fight they don't
[1:20:10] have to come out your back door and come
[1:20:12] and fight your people no
[1:20:13] they'll just send a missile they'll just
[1:20:15] uh
[1:20:16] press a button and something will come
[1:20:18] and hit you
[1:20:19] so now we are going to go into more
[1:20:21] advancement and we see that in politics
[1:20:23] as well
[1:20:25] there was a time that women could not
[1:20:27] even vote women were relegated to their
[1:20:30] back door
[1:20:31] they couldn't go out their husbands and
[1:20:33] brothers and fathers have to go and
[1:20:35] maybe buy newspapers and come and tell
[1:20:36] them the story because they were women
[1:20:38] but over the years women have gone so
[1:20:41] forward
[1:20:42] and now we have them have them at the
[1:20:44] helm of politics
[1:20:45] of course we've got women in in high
[1:20:47] places in politics we've got
[1:20:48] clinton was a secretary of state she was
[1:20:50] even a presidential candidate
[1:20:52] she didn't win though but she got so
[1:20:54] close but now
[1:20:55] we've got a one vice president we've got
[1:20:58] a donald trump
[1:20:59] we've got a joe biden and i could see
[1:21:01] them in the three planets that are
[1:21:02] lining up in the political sense
[1:21:05] now the two planets where the main
[1:21:07] competitors were biden and trump
[1:21:09] it looks like trump saw that biden was a
[1:21:12] strong competitor so he started fighting
[1:21:14] his way up
[1:21:15] with a rush air with his son and
[1:21:16] different things and it kept
[1:21:18] on going but now when uh was the name
[1:21:22] when biden took carmela as a vice
[1:21:26] president
[1:21:26] candidate it changed the ball game now
[1:21:29] the attention is not so much of course
[1:21:30] there's a fight what you know
[1:21:32] went on in washington but the attention
[1:21:34] is coming more on women
[1:21:35] the natural is typing the spiritual if
[1:21:38] the natura is allowing women to
[1:21:40] come to the helm of politics the lord is
[1:21:43] bringing his wife
[1:21:44] like esther and ahi soros to where he's
[1:21:47] supposed to be
[1:21:48] amen so the natura is just a type of the
[1:21:52] spiritual app
[1:21:53] praise god hallelujah and the planet
[1:21:55] mercury
[1:21:56] is in in the word mercury is coming from
[1:21:58] it came from a
[1:21:59] roman word it was a roman god of comets
[1:22:02] travel and eloquence and it's also
[1:22:05] cunning
[1:22:05] and deceptive in the natura the women
[1:22:08] are coming into power
[1:22:10] i mean they are very eloquent it used to
[1:22:13] be that women like i said women oh
[1:22:15] they don't even have they used to be up
[1:22:16] in america here about 100 200 years ago
[1:22:20] if your husband or your father died you
[1:22:22] can't even inherit your brother has to
[1:22:24] step in it and take care of the land and
[1:22:26] different things for you
[1:22:28] but not now no women are just saying yes
[1:22:31] ma'am
[1:22:32] that's what we do now women are at the
[1:22:34] affairs
[1:22:35] women have more a master's degree than
[1:22:37] men
[1:22:38] if you go to medical schools there are
[1:22:40] more women than men i'm an eyewitness
[1:22:42] so women are climbing so high and what
[1:22:45] is happening in the natura
[1:22:46] has a spiritual connotation glory
[1:22:49] hallelujah to the lord
[1:22:51] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:22:52] christ amen
[1:22:54] so the lord is using and these natural
[1:22:56] things
[1:22:57] set it up to type what is doing on earth
[1:23:00] what is doing in his church the church
[1:23:03] is the woman
[1:23:04] the church is the wife the church is the
[1:23:06] bride the queen
[1:23:07] the body of christ and so the lord is
[1:23:09] using as the natural one in politics
[1:23:12] in religion in science the lord is also
[1:23:15] using typing
[1:23:16] what is happening is bringing the anta
[1:23:17] type the reality in his church
[1:23:20] what he's trying to achieve in the
[1:23:22] church of the living god
[1:23:24] if the whole world men and women are
[1:23:26] trying to get women to be a president
[1:23:29] to be at the helm of our face what is
[1:23:31] the lord
[1:23:32] doing with his wife what is the lord
[1:23:34] doing with this church
[1:23:36] what is the lord doing with you and i
[1:23:38] he's trying to bring you to the helm
[1:23:40] that this is my missus this is my wife
[1:23:43] this is me this is my body this is
[1:23:46] manifestation of my character
[1:23:48] message jesus christ queen jesus christ
[1:23:51] the body of jesus christ is the same
[1:23:52] thing jesus christ
[1:23:54] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:23:57] the lord
[1:23:58] the lord is good amen let me just take a
[1:24:00] sip of water
[1:24:04] the lord is good glory hallelujah amen
[1:24:07] now that is the
[1:24:09] the world system that is science but
[1:24:11] let's come back home
[1:24:13] to the church glory to the lord amen
[1:24:17] as this planet are lining up in triple
[1:24:21] conjunction double conjunction the lord
[1:24:24] is lining up his people
[1:24:26] in triple and double conjunctions
[1:24:29] remember the year 2020 was the year for
[1:24:31] double blessings
[1:24:33] and we had about blessings too
[1:24:35] coronavirus was a blessing under
[1:24:36] disguise
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:38] the lord sometimes allowed things to
[1:24:40] come on earth to purge us
[1:24:43] to bring things into manifestation so
[1:24:46] the lord permitted this and nothing will
[1:24:47] happen
[1:24:48] that the lord hasn't permitted that will
[1:24:50] happen
[1:24:52] nothing can take your life no demon
[1:24:55] no sickness no satan can touch you
[1:24:59] if the lord jesus christ didn't permit
[1:25:00] it and if he permitted it
[1:25:02] and he permitted for his glory that he
[1:25:05] will heal you
[1:25:05] he'll resurrect you rapture you give you
[1:25:08] millennium peace and rest in your life
[1:25:11] to identify his attributes to show you
[1:25:13] his love for you
[1:25:14] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:18] glory hallelujah now the builder land
[1:25:21] our titus the builder the land of new
[1:25:23] possession we've already possessed a lot
[1:25:25] of things
[1:25:26] but there's a new possession as we drop
[1:25:29] into the year 2021
[1:25:31] possession does not destroy means having
[1:25:32] buildings and houses and business
[1:25:34] those are the attributes those are the
[1:25:36] benefits of eternal life
[1:25:37] because we are seed of abraham royal
[1:25:39] city of abraham the lord give you
[1:25:41] celestial blessings
[1:25:42] and give you earthly blessings as well
[1:25:44] so the lord will bless you with
[1:25:46] whatever your finance money husband wife
[1:25:48] children whatever just name it
[1:25:50] whatever you want to achieve the lord
[1:25:52] has them for you
[1:25:53] amen but there's more greater than that
[1:25:56] than the earthly blessing because those
[1:25:58] things we are not going to take them
[1:25:59] with us
[1:26:00] when you draw from the earth if i leave
[1:26:02] my earth i'm not going to take this with
[1:26:04] me
[1:26:04] no you can't take a house with you you
[1:26:07] can't take your wife and your children
[1:26:08] with you
[1:26:08] you can't take your husband with you the
[1:26:10] only thing you take with you
[1:26:12] is the character of jesus christ the
[1:26:14] theophany
[1:26:15] the holy spirit baptism and that's the
[1:26:18] most important thing in
[1:26:19] any person's life that you have to ask
[1:26:21] yourself
[1:26:22] lock yourself in a room and ask yourself
[1:26:24] do i have
[1:26:25] what it it takes to transition to this
[1:26:28] from this earth
[1:26:29] to my next destination if the lord
[1:26:31] should take my breath now
[1:26:33] if you don't have it then don't get out
[1:26:35] of the room be on your knees so you get
[1:26:37] what it takes
[1:26:39] amen because your life is not in your
[1:26:41] hands your life is in the hands of the
[1:26:43] lord
[1:26:43] amen so be like the land of new
[1:26:45] possession we have definitely already
[1:26:48] but billa means ownership master
[1:26:52] lord married and claimed as a wife
[1:26:55] it's a heavenly zion and then another
[1:26:58] word that also explains
[1:26:59] in manifestation is half ziba my delight
[1:27:03] is in her
[1:27:05] hair is who the church you the lord the
[1:27:08] light is in you
[1:27:09] the delight of the husband is in the
[1:27:11] wife amen
[1:27:13] because the wife is expression it's just
[1:27:14] a feminine part of him
[1:27:16] it's part of him amen just like the
[1:27:19] husband is the masculine part of the
[1:27:21] woman
[1:27:22] so the two are one they just separate in
[1:27:25] manifestation
[1:27:26] as an attribute on earth glory
[1:27:28] hallelujah
[1:27:30] now the law doesn't if the lord is
[1:27:32] showing uh
[1:27:33] triple conjunctions and uh great
[1:27:36] conjunctions
[1:27:37] onto the world what is he doing in his
[1:27:39] church
[1:27:40] the lord is doing nothing in his church
[1:27:42] no he's doing great things in his church
[1:27:44] even right here amen and i want to take
[1:27:48] my next scripture it's just a short
[1:27:50] scripture psalm 81 verse 10
[1:27:53] psalm 81 the book of psalms some of
[1:27:55] david
[1:27:56] 8-1 verse 10 it reads
[1:27:59] i am the lord thy god which brought thee
[1:28:02] out of the land of
[1:28:03] egypt open thy mouth white and i will
[1:28:06] feel it
[1:28:07] glory hallelujah this is the male
[1:28:10] portion of the scripture i want to read
[1:28:12] i am the lord thy god which brought thee
[1:28:15] out of the land of egypt
[1:28:16] opened thy mouth wide and now i will
[1:28:19] feel it what is egypt
[1:28:21] i've never been i was born in africa
[1:28:22] i've never been in egypt before i've
[1:28:23] flown past egypt
[1:28:25] so what egypt is allowed talking about
[1:28:27] some of you have never gone to egypt
[1:28:29] africa some of you never go to africa so
[1:28:30] what egypt is allah talking about is
[1:28:32] that country egypt
[1:28:33] no egypt is a condition right the
[1:28:35] country gives us a
[1:28:36] condition of the world condition of the
[1:28:39] old
[1:28:39] bed now he brought you from the old
[1:28:42] breath
[1:28:43] from the old civilization to the new
[1:28:45] civilization
[1:28:46] the eternal kingdom of the holy ghost
[1:28:48] baptism where
[1:28:50] everything is possible there's no
[1:28:52] impossibilities in your life
[1:28:54] amen because when you have the holy
[1:28:56] ghost christ
[1:28:57] is in you amen if you profess that i
[1:29:00] could you know have the holy ghost what
[1:29:03] i'm trying to say is that
[1:29:05] i am jesus christ because jesus christ
[1:29:07] is inhabiting in me
[1:29:09] and if jesus christ is in this flesh
[1:29:11] what is my limitation
[1:29:13] i do not have any if i have to pass
[1:29:15] through this wall
[1:29:17] my iman cannot do it but a christ in me
[1:29:19] can pass through this wall
[1:29:20] without any breakages and damages amen
[1:29:25] if you have to pop through this roof if
[1:29:27] it becomes necessary let's say there's a
[1:29:29] fire
[1:29:30] in this boat the doors are locked and
[1:29:32] you have to pop through this roof
[1:29:34] with children and everything the christ
[1:29:36] in you
[1:29:37] will make your way you pop this roof
[1:29:39] without any breakages and damages
[1:29:41] it has happened before before man
[1:29:43] invented automatic door
[1:29:45] the holy ghost in the time of peter was
[1:29:48] in jail
[1:29:49] he thought he was dreaming he saw
[1:29:51] somebody tell him to get up and put on
[1:29:52] your clothes
[1:29:53] and like was dreaming did dreaming and
[1:29:55] he was following somebody without really
[1:29:57] wasn't aware of what he was doing and
[1:29:59] before he could realize
[1:30:01] he's going through a door meanwhile the
[1:30:03] door has got military people standing
[1:30:04] there
[1:30:05] strong military with attention to make
[1:30:07] sure peter doesn't escape
[1:30:08] and they were vigilant they were awake
[1:30:11] and they passed through the door without
[1:30:12] even them noticing
[1:30:14] for greater he that is in you is greater
[1:30:16] than all the other things in the world
[1:30:19] amen so if you have the holy ghost
[1:30:21] that's who you are
[1:30:23] if you don't have it forsake whatever
[1:30:25] you have that is prevent you from having
[1:30:27] it
[1:30:27] and get this jewel of great prize
[1:30:31] if you know and you know and the lord
[1:30:34] knows
[1:30:34] and you know that you don't have the
[1:30:36] holy ghost christ on the inside
[1:30:38] you have a void an emptiness on the
[1:30:40] inside
[1:30:41] which cannot be satisfied by nothing in
[1:30:43] the world no
[1:30:44] money cannot satisfy us if so
[1:30:47] millennials and billionaires will not
[1:30:48] kill themselves
[1:30:50] people commit suicide when they've got
[1:30:52] millions and billions
[1:30:54] when they've got mansions when they've
[1:30:56] got properties beyond what you can
[1:30:57] imagine
[1:30:58] they just hung themselves killed
[1:31:00] themselves take tap pulse and die
[1:31:02] so that would not satisfy sex will not
[1:31:05] satisfy you
[1:31:06] the last of the flesh will not satisfy
[1:31:08] you attractions of the eyes will not
[1:31:10] satisfy you
[1:31:11] but there's a man jesus christ the lord
[1:31:14] himself
[1:31:15] the seed that was in you before the
[1:31:16] foundation of the world the house that
[1:31:18] you live in
[1:31:19] the celestial body the man who can speak
[1:31:22] and his word is here in amen
[1:31:24] when he activate himself in you when he
[1:31:26] quickens you
[1:31:27] and let you know that you are mine you
[1:31:30] are my daughter
[1:31:31] you are me and i am you amen
[1:31:34] and if you let me live in your flesh all
[1:31:36] things are possible
[1:31:38] the old things will be gone they'll be
[1:31:40] bygone and everything will become new
[1:31:42] you become a beulah the land of new
[1:31:45] possession
[1:31:46] all your inheritance that were missing
[1:31:47] that got lost it will be redeemed unto
[1:31:49] you
[1:31:50] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[1:31:53] the name of the lord amen
[1:31:56] we just want to stay in the church now
[1:31:57] so that was a masculine
[1:31:59] scripture let me read the feminine
[1:32:01] scripture the female portion
[1:32:03] john 7 30 38
[1:32:07] the book of john chapter 7 verse 38
[1:32:11] and we put them together we're going to
[1:32:13] have a wedding today
[1:32:16] marrying two scriptures amen glory
[1:32:18] hallelujah
[1:32:21] he said he that belief on me as the
[1:32:23] scriptures have said
[1:32:24] out of his belly shall flow reverse of
[1:32:27] living waters
[1:32:28] reverse of living water out of your
[1:32:30] belly how can my belly water come out of
[1:32:32] my belly that'd be a sickness
[1:32:34] if you see water coming from your belly
[1:32:37] there'll be no that'd be no joke
[1:32:39] you'll probably run to your doctor
[1:32:40] quickly you're going to cover the jaguar
[1:32:42] jack i've never seen this before
[1:32:45] so it's not the the scriptures the lord
[1:32:48] and the prophet
[1:32:48] and men and women of god use the natural
[1:32:50] language to portray
[1:32:53] to a reveal unravel spiritual things
[1:32:56] that the lord is doing
[1:32:57] so out of your belly your heart is your
[1:32:59] belly your heart is your faith
[1:33:02] so when you believe you become what you
[1:33:04] believe
[1:33:05] believe means eating when you eat the
[1:33:07] lord jesus christ
[1:33:09] you become the lord jesus christ if you
[1:33:11] say i do as you are having aware then
[1:33:13] lord i do
[1:33:14] i believe you i accept you i am you i
[1:33:17] want to be you
[1:33:18] i want to save you i want to be see
[1:33:19] jesus christ and when you accept the
[1:33:21] lord get into
[1:33:22] get into your heart now you become the
[1:33:24] lord jesus christ
[1:33:25] and whatever attribute that is in the
[1:33:27] lord jesus christ is imparted on to you
[1:33:30] and when you speak your word is not the
[1:33:31] word of a man or word of a woman what
[1:33:34] the what your word is the word of the
[1:33:35] lord jesus christ
[1:33:37] and out of you your faith your
[1:33:39] revelation
[1:33:40] shall flow blessings rivers of living
[1:33:43] waters
[1:33:43] it will bring people of the lord it will
[1:33:46] bring sins
[1:33:47] into manifestation amen just as one
[1:33:50] person
[1:33:51] believe the word of the lord start a
[1:33:53] church call it a spiritual tabernacle
[1:33:55] and out of it has flown living waters
[1:33:58] all the people here there are living
[1:33:59] waters
[1:34:00] amen water is people
[1:34:03] amen water is not just water
[1:34:06] it's what people the people of the lord
[1:34:08] is referred to as water
[1:34:10] amen glory hallelujah the lord is good
[1:34:14] amen so now the first scripture was the
[1:34:16] masculine
[1:34:17] portion i am the lord thy god which
[1:34:20] brought thee out of the land of egypt
[1:34:21] open thy mouth wide and i'll feel it let
[1:34:24] me quickly read some two codes before i
[1:34:26] narrow it down
[1:34:28] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:34:30] christ let's read uh
[1:34:32] endlessly contending for the fifth five
[1:34:35] four zero four zero four m
[1:34:36] endlessly contending for the fifth
[1:34:39] five four zero four zero four m
[1:34:42] paragraph 20.
[1:34:44] i'll just keep the first portion and
[1:34:47] i'll go to your questions that i depend
[1:34:48] on the holy ghost
[1:34:49] not knowing not knowing one thing god
[1:34:53] knows that
[1:34:53] what to say this morning i never take
[1:34:55] thought of what to say
[1:34:57] i go to the platform let him do the
[1:34:59] leading that's all but he promised
[1:35:02] if you open your mouth i will feel it

[1:35:06] freeze
[1:35:07] take note if you open your mouth i'll
[1:35:09] feel it
[1:35:10] so that he's done that for 20 23 years
[1:35:13] and i'm not worried i'm not worried in
[1:35:15] the road i trust him
[1:35:16] amen in other words the lord promised
[1:35:18] him that if you will abraham open your
[1:35:20] mouth
[1:35:21] i'll feel it so he's been opening his
[1:35:23] mouth since he accepted the lord
[1:35:24] and the lord has kept feeling it feeling
[1:35:26] it and it's not tired of it you want
[1:35:28] more feeling
[1:35:29] amen feeling and refilling keep feeling
[1:35:32] now it's not naturally filling things
[1:35:34] up food in your mouth shoving some
[1:35:36] delicious uh
[1:35:38] kick in your throat no it's the word of
[1:35:40] the lord
[1:35:41] that fills your superman supernatural
[1:35:43] being amen
[1:35:44] when the lord fills you when the holy
[1:35:46] ghost fools you it activates you
[1:35:49] it makes you a living being it makes you
[1:35:51] a supernatural being
[1:35:52] it makes your way beyond the worst of a
[1:35:54] person become the person of the lord
[1:35:56] jesus christ
[1:35:58] so let me see i think yes
[1:36:01] so for let me read the second quotes
[1:36:03] that is the true vine
[1:36:04] and a false vine 550607
[1:36:08] the true vine and the false vine
[1:36:10] paragraph 9
[1:36:12] and may the glory of god come down upon
[1:36:16] us
[1:36:16] and bless us like it was in the day of
[1:36:19] pentecost
[1:36:20] shakana pentacles god repeated again
[1:36:23] tonight
[1:36:24] give us an outpouring of thy blessings
[1:36:27] may we sit not with an umbrella over us
[1:36:30] and i want to post a pulse of
[1:36:31] anticipation
[1:36:33] do not sit with umbrella over you just
[1:36:36] like if it rains and you don't ruin the
[1:36:38] rain to fall upon you what do you do
[1:36:39] you get your umbrella and the rain will
[1:36:41] not touch you
[1:36:43] now some of us are spiritually doing
[1:36:44] that god i want a blessing for you
[1:36:46] but we've got an umbrella on top of us
[1:36:49] and the blessing are not hating us
[1:36:51] they're blessed not trekking to other
[1:36:52] places but it doesn't come into our life
[1:36:55] they're naturalized about their spirit
[1:36:57] if you've got anything that is hindering
[1:36:59] you from getting the blessings of the
[1:37:01] lord getting the holy ghost baptism
[1:37:03] just let it go and let the lord take
[1:37:05] place
[1:37:06] if you have something holding on to
[1:37:08] something whatever it is you know it
[1:37:10] that is hindering your blessing that is
[1:37:12] not satisfying your heart
[1:37:14] right let it go and let the lord take
[1:37:16] take his abode in your heart
[1:37:18] if i'm holding on to your condition that
[1:37:20] condition could be a relationship
[1:37:22] it could be a wrong desire it could be
[1:37:26] pain in your heart it could be
[1:37:27] unforgiveness
[1:37:29] and actually unforgiveness scientists
[1:37:30] found that unforgiveness can lead to
[1:37:32] cancer
[1:37:33] if something somebody does something
[1:37:34] against you you might be innocent you
[1:37:37] might be the
[1:37:37] one on the right side but if you hold
[1:37:39] unforgiveness in your heart
[1:37:41] you end up getting cancers and tumors
[1:37:43] and diseases
[1:37:45] so it doesn't matter how close a person
[1:37:47] is the most painful thing is somebody
[1:37:49] who's very close to you
[1:37:50] when that person hits you it's most
[1:37:52] difficult to take it away
[1:37:54] but that is when you show that you are
[1:37:56] divine your human mind cannot do it
[1:37:58] but here that is in you the holy ghost
[1:38:00] in you can take it away
[1:38:02] and then you become stepping the
[1:38:04] condition for that person amen
[1:38:07] now moses was a man like you and i we
[1:38:09] know moses right
[1:38:11] he was a short-tempered person he was a
[1:38:14] brutal man he could kill you
[1:38:16] and bury you under under the sand
[1:38:18] without pharaoh and the military knowing
[1:38:20] moses did that he had a temper he had a
[1:38:22] wife that had a temper too
[1:38:24] two tempers together to to to to settle
[1:38:26] each other
[1:38:28] now about the lord touched moses when he
[1:38:31] came to
[1:38:31] uh the burning bush he saw a bush
[1:38:34] burning
[1:38:35] moses had never seen that he had seen
[1:38:37] visions before but he's never seen a
[1:38:39] bush burning
[1:38:40] and it wasn't being consumed so moses
[1:38:43] said you know what let me find what is
[1:38:44] going on here
[1:38:45] he went and there was no science science
[1:38:48] egypt
[1:38:49] ruled the world in science at that time
[1:38:51] yeah but there was no egyptian
[1:38:52] scientific basis that could uh that
[1:38:55] could uh
[1:38:56] explain why the bush was burning and not
[1:38:58] being consumed
[1:38:59] and a voice came from the bush moses
[1:39:02] this ground is the holy ground take off
[1:39:04] your shoe
[1:39:05] you are stepping the celestial dimension
[1:39:08] take off your reasoning mind
[1:39:09] and let the holy ghost let me lead you
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:12] so that you can understand your life so
[1:39:14] that i can move you from being a failure
[1:39:16] on to being who i called you to be and
[1:39:19] moses
[1:39:20] yielded amen and the lord changed him
[1:39:22] there was a time that his own
[1:39:24] brother and his sister was teasing him
[1:39:26] mocking because he made an eg
[1:39:28] ethiopian ethiopian is a colored person
[1:39:30] like you and i
[1:39:31] but the lost choice the mind of the lord
[1:39:34] is different from your mind
[1:39:35] amen god can go outside the box and do
[1:39:38] what you want to do
[1:39:39] he's a sovereign god so the lord moved
[1:39:42] the anger of the lord raged against
[1:39:43] miriam and aaron
[1:39:46] and the lord wanted to slaughter them
[1:39:47] but what did moses do
[1:39:49] moses could have found it found a flame
[1:39:52] yes they mocked me lord kill them
[1:39:54] slaughter them is that what moses did no
[1:39:57] he's stepping the guard for them he said
[1:39:59] lord don't touch them
[1:40:01] and he pleaded for them because he has
[1:40:03] got their grace
[1:40:04] to speak to the pillar of fire the lord
[1:40:06] spoke to him face by face
[1:40:08] he showed visions and dreams to miriam
[1:40:10] and moses and uh
[1:40:12] and aaron but for moses the lord could
[1:40:14] come visibly
[1:40:15] and say moses my servant upon all the
[1:40:18] men on earth
[1:40:19] moses had all their problems that are
[1:40:21] already narrated but upon all the men on
[1:40:24] earth
[1:40:24] that i've created there's none that i
[1:40:26] love like you moses
[1:40:29] and that's what the lord is talking
[1:40:30] about to you now of all the creation
[1:40:32] beautiful women and men on earth rich
[1:40:35] and poor
[1:40:36] ugly and beautiful you are the one the
[1:40:38] lord has
[1:40:39] selected elected to be his wife
[1:40:42] to be his son to be his daughter to be
[1:40:45] his buddy buddy
[1:40:46] the closest person to to be scrawny that
[1:40:49] he want to communicate with
[1:40:51] best friend if the lord wants to speak
[1:40:53] something to the earth
[1:40:54] he comes to you and show you amen
[1:40:57] you don't want this position what do you
[1:40:59] want if the almighty
[1:41:02] the one who give breath to human being
[1:41:05] want to be your friend
[1:41:06] he said i don't want it i want the
[1:41:08] opposite
[1:41:09] i want the world i want sin i want death
[1:41:14] i want satan to rule me i don't know who
[1:41:16] you are
[1:41:17] no forsake the world and let
[1:41:20] the lord jesus christ because you can't
[1:41:23] even get enough of him
[1:41:24] amen there's something about the lord
[1:41:26] that the more he gives you the more you
[1:41:27] want even more
[1:41:29] because it's an uh eternity means it has
[1:41:32] no beginning
[1:41:32] has no end it's an unquenching reverse
[1:41:35] of water
[1:41:35] that you drink and drink and drink and
[1:41:38] you push out the attribute in you
[1:41:40] and you keep pushing out and you keep
[1:41:42] pushing out and you become like him
[1:41:44] amen glory hallelujah
[1:41:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:54] so moses stood in a god voice for his
[1:41:56] people
[1:41:58] glory to the lord now let's drive it
[1:42:01] back home
[1:42:02] we're coming back home open your mouth
[1:42:05] wide and i will feel it right
[1:42:10] oh my lord help us just a couple maybe a
[1:42:14] few months ago
[1:42:15] the lord gave a prophecy here
[1:42:18] we've been praying about the gift that
[1:42:20] the lord has put in the church
[1:42:22] and we see gifts and many gift
[1:42:24] manifestations manifesting
[1:42:26] and i remember when i came here probably
[1:42:28] the last three years ago
[1:42:29] we used to before they covered we used
[1:42:31] to pray right at the back of the church
[1:42:33] the brothers we pray and we see the gift
[1:42:35] of the lord manifesting in brother
[1:42:37] quentin
[1:42:38] there was a time i remember right right
[1:42:40] at the back the holy ghost was so strong
[1:42:42] our brother was moving up and down it
[1:42:44] wasn't him he didn't know where he was
[1:42:46] the lord just said time the lord anoints
[1:42:48] you but there's another one he possesses
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:51] that your human mind and your human body
[1:42:53] is not yourself
[1:42:54] you do things that you won't even think
[1:42:56] of doing it as i wouldn't have
[1:42:58] prophesied that
[1:42:59] a a virgin shall conceive
[1:43:02] and bring forth a son in his normal
[1:43:04] human reasoning
[1:43:05] he wouldn't have done that but someone
[1:43:07] possessed him and
[1:43:09] spoke through his lips so that the lord
[1:43:11] possessed our brother
[1:43:12] and was give that word of the lord he
[1:43:14] was speaking in the
[1:43:15] the other dimensional language that was
[1:43:17] not early language
[1:43:18] and we've seen that gift before i
[1:43:20] remember jack pray uh
[1:43:22] preached he said let's keep praying that
[1:43:23] the lord will give us the gift of
[1:43:25] interpretation because if the lord put a
[1:43:27] gift in there to speak in terms then
[1:43:29] the lord who put a gift there will give
[1:43:31] an interpretation
[1:43:33] glory hallelujah so i remember jack used
[1:43:35] to preach one day i was in my
[1:43:37] house and i was close to my kitchen and
[1:43:40] the voice said
[1:43:41] somebody from himself mother jack
[1:43:43] himself is going to interpret
[1:43:45] so my first thought was oh let me go
[1:43:47] take black jack and another said no
[1:43:49] just let the lord have his own way so i
[1:43:51] kept my silent i didn't say nothing to
[1:43:53] jack and i remember we were here in
[1:43:55] church having a normal service
[1:43:57] and the president of the lord came so
[1:43:59] strong and i remember
[1:44:00] that troy and i were praying for for he
[1:44:02] had a prayer line
[1:44:04] and the lord the holy ghost possessed
[1:44:06] our dear sister sister naomi johnson
[1:44:08] to speak the word of the lord in a
[1:44:10] language that is not
[1:44:12] any earthly language that we could
[1:44:13] understand and i remember i was standing
[1:44:15] somewhere here and i opened my eye
[1:44:17] and i saw the dimension circulating
[1:44:19] around my sister
[1:44:20] so strong beyond what you can think
[1:44:22] about it was an anointing but it was
[1:44:24] possession
[1:44:25] and the lord ought to said what he
[1:44:26] wanted to see and after that we kept
[1:44:28] praying for people me and
[1:44:30] jack were here and out of the blue
[1:44:33] sister rebecca gave the lord an
[1:44:36] utterance
[1:44:37] in english language clay as as clear as
[1:44:40] anything i mean as clay as
[1:44:42] as you can understand in a language that
[1:44:44] we know earthly language
[1:44:46] and i think i have it written here let
[1:44:48] me see if it's right if i had it right i
[1:44:50] want to quote it
[1:44:51] and then narrow certain things down
[1:44:53] prophecy um
[1:44:55] say have i not spoken this was to you
[1:44:58] if i'm wrong please correct me have i
[1:45:01] know spoken this was
[1:45:02] on to to you i'm doing a new thing and i
[1:45:05] want to underline
[1:45:06] have i know the first one is a question
[1:45:08] have i not
[1:45:09] spoken this way to you
[1:45:12] statement i'm doing a new thing
[1:45:16] i the lord who's i am i am that spoke
[1:45:19] with moses
[1:45:21] and moses asked him hey lord if i'm
[1:45:23] going to tell the people that
[1:45:24] you spoke to me they're going to ask me
[1:45:26] who your name is he said tell them i
[1:45:28] am that i am that is not that is
[1:45:30] sufficient for now
[1:45:32] i am i exist he said i am
[1:45:35] doing a new thing i am doing a new thing
[1:45:38] in my bride
[1:45:39] so he repeated the same thing again i'm
[1:45:41] doing a new thing
[1:45:43] then he said i'm doing a new thing in my
[1:45:44] bride just wait on me
[1:45:47] and i will do what you have asked me to
[1:45:49] do
[1:45:51] so you already asked the lord to do
[1:45:52] something for you
[1:45:55] and he said wait on him when he say wait
[1:45:58] on me
[1:45:59] let's break it down when is it wait on
[1:46:01] me we've all been to a restaurant before
[1:46:04] waiting that if you tell the waitress
[1:46:06] that okay i'm going to wait on you then
[1:46:07] the waitress will come and sit down i'm
[1:46:08] waiting on you
[1:46:09] are you going to be having that waitress
[1:46:11] no
[1:46:12] you want food f-o-o-d
[1:46:18] it's not just to come and wait and stay
[1:46:19] at you and your family you want food so
[1:46:22] that is a waitress
[1:46:23] so wait a minute save me
[1:46:26] save the lord with none the lord has me
[1:46:29] just sit down okay
[1:46:31] the lord said
[1:46:35] but i quit what i do you know the lord
[1:46:36] said i should wait on him i'm waiting
[1:46:38] i'm sleeping
[1:46:39] i'm with no that's not the waiting say
[1:46:41] the lord so waiting of the lord means
[1:46:43] serving with all your heart with all
[1:46:46] your mind
[1:46:47] with all your body with all your
[1:46:48] substance so waiting means
[1:46:50] serving the lord wait on me
[1:46:56] wait on me and i will do what you have
[1:46:58] asked me to do
[1:47:01] you don't have to worry for i am
[1:47:04] here oh man what an assurance i
[1:47:07] am here we know who i am is who is i
[1:47:10] am jehovah the lord jesus christ
[1:47:14] and he's in you he's here where is he
[1:47:17] in you in you so i am
[1:47:21] here be rest assured
[1:47:24] just like a child when children
[1:47:26] sometimes when it's dark they're afraid
[1:47:27] of darkness
[1:47:28] or when they see something that they're
[1:47:29] afraid but when they have a family
[1:47:32] daddy mommy uncle grandparents grandma
[1:47:34] i'm scared
[1:47:36] oh i'm here don't worry junior oh okay
[1:47:38] grandma is here
[1:47:41] oh that is here so that is an assurance
[1:47:45] i am here sometime when parents are
[1:47:47] going out and maybe their kids are
[1:47:49] younger
[1:47:49] they lock them don't go out because i'm
[1:47:52] not here
[1:47:53] don't open the enemy can come in a dog
[1:47:54] can come and bite you
[1:47:56] so stay in the room don't go outside
[1:47:58] because parents are
[1:47:59] not there but then when parents are here
[1:48:01] i
[1:48:02] am here amen amen it's okay
[1:48:06] don't be afraid
[1:48:09] amen know that i was
[1:48:13] not that i will be but i am
[1:48:16] here amen where you see in you
[1:48:20] amen i am here amen
[1:48:24] now we go father said i am he oh my
[1:48:27] father said have i not
[1:48:30] he brought the negative to bring the
[1:48:31] positive he so he started with a
[1:48:33] contrast
[1:48:34] the lord sometimes permits afflictions
[1:48:36] and trials
[1:48:38] to bring their blessing so when you see
[1:48:40] trials on your way
[1:48:41] when you see afflictions and limitation
[1:48:44] there's an abundance of world amen
[1:48:46] coming into your life there's a big
[1:48:48] frequency
[1:48:49] beyond what you can understand so when
[1:48:51] you see afflictions
[1:48:52] yes you're a human being you've got
[1:48:54] blood in you but you look beyond the
[1:48:56] pain
[1:48:56] yeah look beyond the breath pain looking
[1:48:59] beyond the affliction
[1:49:00] look beyond the trials and just narrow
[1:49:02] your eyes
[1:49:03] through the affliction that the lord is
[1:49:04] not punishing you no
[1:49:06] he doesn't punish people that he loves
[1:49:08] he blessing them
[1:49:09] he's building a contrast he's built an
[1:49:11] attribute so that when the blessings
[1:49:13] come
[1:49:14] you appreciate a blessing glory
[1:49:16] hallelujah
[1:49:17] it doesn't matter whether it's sickness
[1:49:19] whether it's job loss
[1:49:21] whether it's family there's a blessing
[1:49:23] for you
[1:49:24] and it's on the way it's here amen is
[1:49:27] coming out of you
[1:49:28] amen because the scripture said out of
[1:49:30] your belly shall flow
[1:49:32] reverse of living water glory hallelujah
[1:49:38] i am he so now he's making a reference
[1:49:42] i am here who speaks to you right now
[1:49:46] spanish would say ahora but ahora right
[1:49:50] right now not yesterday not tomorrow
[1:49:54] but right now oh glory hallelujah
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] let me use an experience that i had in
[1:50:04] uk working in a pharmacy
[1:50:07] they have a program called a needle
[1:50:09] exchange program
[1:50:10] where people that drug pushers who use
[1:50:12] cocaine and whatever
[1:50:14] they inject themselves and they use the
[1:50:16] same needle to inject each other
[1:50:18] in doing so they transmit hiv so they
[1:50:20] have a program where
[1:50:21] drug pushers can come to the pharmacy
[1:50:23] and come and get
[1:50:24] new um new needles to do their stuff
[1:50:28] so we were working and normally the
[1:50:29] pharmacy i was working on my boots the
[1:50:31] cameras
[1:50:32] we opened at 8 o'clock but then we are
[1:50:33] not open to customers until 9 00 am

[1:50:37] inventory and do stuff that we need to
[1:50:39] do internally so we were there during
[1:50:40] our staff

[1:50:44] want needles and it's oh go and come
[1:50:45] back nine o'clock

[1:50:50] needles
[1:50:51] right now before she could finish we
[1:50:53] just gave her the needle

[1:52:00] you've got the genetics of jesus christ
[1:52:01] in you you've got a blood
[1:52:03] which is the holy ghost in you you've
[1:52:05] got the dna
[1:52:07] you've got the genes whatever jesus
[1:52:09] christ is in you
[1:52:11] and so whatever you need open it your
[1:52:13] mouth and speak it
[1:52:15] let it come from your heart don't look
[1:52:17] at the condition
[1:52:18] no don't look at the circumstance but
[1:52:21] look at your desire
[1:52:23] and speak it to the lord and the lord
[1:52:26] has it already for you
[1:52:27] amen don't look at your children don't
[1:52:30] look at your
[1:52:30] wickedness don't look at your husband's
[1:52:32] weirdness don't look at your back
[1:52:34] sliding off your brothers and your
[1:52:35] sisters
[1:52:36] but speak and it shall be
[1:52:39] amen amen amen and sometimes i'd like to
[1:52:42] die sit
[1:52:43] said i said i think i am just that
[1:52:45] little prophecy
[1:52:47] i am was mentioned three times if i'm
[1:52:49] correct
[1:52:50] i am new thing two times twice
[1:52:54] said i'm doing a new thing and repeat it
[1:52:56] again
[1:52:58] i am doing a new thing in my bride so
[1:53:00] now he qualified it further
[1:53:02] he's doing new things in politics new
[1:53:05] things in the world
[1:53:06] in communication in the zodiac even in
[1:53:09] the celestial dimension
[1:53:11] but it doesn't pertain to me if it's not
[1:53:13] new things in my life
[1:53:15] but i'm doing a new thing in my bride in
[1:53:17] my wife
[1:53:18] in my body in my message in my in
[1:53:22] me because you are jesus christ himself
[1:53:24] amen you are
[1:53:26] we are the female designation
[1:53:27] designation of jesus christ
[1:53:29] we are him amen open your mouth a new
[1:53:33] thing
[1:53:33] i will five times it means there's more
[1:53:37] to come
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:39] there's more to come amen
[1:53:42] there's more gifts in the church
[1:53:46] and as we step into the frequency the
[1:53:49] lord has the time
[1:53:50] it's in them it's in people but there's
[1:53:52] a time that the lord brings into
[1:53:54] manifestation
[1:53:55] and the lord opened the frequency and
[1:53:57] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:53:59] begin to manifest just like he gave us
[1:54:02] surprises
[1:54:03] right sister naomi and sister rebecca
[1:54:06] just look at the names of the two
[1:54:07] sisters that's right
[1:54:09] naomi and rebecca
[1:54:12] amen when the lord calls a person he
[1:54:15] calls his family
[1:54:16] and the lord transcribed and manifests
[1:54:19] himself
[1:54:20] in the family of the person that he
[1:54:22] calls amen
[1:54:24] look at the life of naomi in the bible
[1:54:26] she was a prophetess
[1:54:28] she led ruth onto onto boaz
[1:54:31] to christ look at rebecca rebecca was
[1:54:34] married to
[1:54:35] isaac the type of the son of god the
[1:54:37] love of christ
[1:54:38] so the lord used brother john's own
[1:54:40] daughter
[1:54:41] but a solomon's wife to bring an
[1:54:43] attribute
[1:54:44] a wife and a daughter there's no
[1:54:47] coincidence in the lord
[1:54:48] it's not by mistake that the lord used
[1:54:50] our two sisters
[1:54:52] to bring those manifestations you want
[1:54:54] to show that there's a relationship
[1:54:55] marriage going on
[1:54:57] another there's children being produced
[1:54:59] and those children are what
[1:55:00] spoken with sons and daughters of god
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:04] the lord is doing a new thing it's not a
[1:55:06] man it's the lord
[1:55:07] and when the lord says something nothing
[1:55:10] can hinder him
[1:55:11] not even your own belief can hinder him
[1:55:13] he'll just go right ahead and do it
[1:55:15] amen glory hallelujah and so you accept
[1:55:18] what the lord is doing
[1:55:20] in you in the church in the world and
[1:55:22] you'll be rejoicing and dancing
[1:55:24] glory hallelujah to the lord amen
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:40] glory to the lord
[1:55:46] let me use william brown for example
[1:55:49] when he had an accident
[1:55:51] he knew already he already saw the
[1:55:53] vision he even told a friend he told one
[1:55:55] brother i think one of the friends
[1:55:56] is the one who heard that the lord the
[1:55:58] lord is going to take me home
[1:55:59] when you hear the lord has taken him out
[1:56:00] take your wife and go to go back to i
[1:56:03] think they are the denominational church
[1:56:04] because they won't survive in brahms
[1:56:05] tabernacle because after he the church
[1:56:07] became different story
[1:56:09] became fight and struggle and whatever
[1:56:11] so he said
[1:56:12] the lord told me that i'm going to leave
[1:56:14] and when you hear him left
[1:56:15] i'm going to glory take your wife and go
[1:56:17] to that church your wife will be far
[1:56:18] better over there
[1:56:19] so he was driving amarillo means yellow
[1:56:22] yellow means death and resurrection
[1:56:24] that's the same the symbol of the color
[1:56:26] yellow blue is heavenly
[1:56:28] dimension green is new beginning red
[1:56:32] is sacrificed redemption white is purity
[1:56:36] and all the colors have got meaning so
[1:56:38] the prophet was coming from
[1:56:39] amarillo texas the largest state in the
[1:56:41] u.s if i'm right
[1:56:42] and was driving and somewhere along the
[1:56:45] line i think about abraham his wife
[1:56:46] sister meda
[1:56:47] uh two three daughters no two daughters
[1:56:51] rebecca says sarah and joseph were in
[1:56:53] babram's car but i believe
[1:56:55] his wife sister lois were in his car i
[1:56:57] don't know i think if he has his son
[1:56:58] there i don't remember but then
[1:57:00] somewhere along the line brother joseph
[1:57:02] he was a little boy he said
[1:57:03] can i go to my brother's car i'm saying
[1:57:04] yeah go to your brother's car
[1:57:06] so when the accident happened but billy
[1:57:09] paul was behind
[1:57:10] we're behind by abraham so he didn't see
[1:57:12] you drove to find out that oh there's a
[1:57:14] wreck
[1:57:14] and he got to know it was his father so
[1:57:17] billy paul locked that car
[1:57:18] locked his wife and his son his brother
[1:57:21] because her little brother because he
[1:57:22] can't see it was too graphic for him to
[1:57:24] see so he looked you
[1:57:25] said be in the car i'll be back he went
[1:57:27] his testimony was
[1:57:28] so i've been with my father i've
[1:57:30] traveled with him to africa i share
[1:57:32] different countries
[1:57:33] when i saw my daddy i know he was gone
[1:57:36] he's dead and for whatever reason
[1:57:40] how it happened the lord knows but
[1:57:43] joseph was locked in the car little
[1:57:44] joseph
[1:57:45] but he came out of the car not opening
[1:57:48] the car how he came out
[1:57:50] and he saw his father wrecking the car
[1:57:52] he said daddy
[1:57:53] and when he mentioned daddy abram opened
[1:57:55] his eyes
[1:57:57] the amanda was dead he opened his eyes
[1:58:00] and said where's mommy put put my hands
[1:58:02] on mommy that is his wife
[1:58:04] and they managed to put his son and he
[1:58:06] said a simple prayer
[1:58:07] oh lord remember me and my family at
[1:58:09] this hour
[1:58:10] and he just went back into the other
[1:58:12] dimension
[1:58:13] and sister meda came back to life
[1:58:16] resurrected
[1:58:17] his daughter i think the lord gave them
[1:58:19] unconscious they didn't see much of it
[1:58:21] so when the lord calls you he cost your
[1:58:24] family
[1:58:25] brother billy was the old church
[1:58:28] and so he was typing like dead he saw my
[1:58:30] daddy was dead
[1:58:31] but joseph was a new beginning so when
[1:58:34] he came yes
[1:58:34] he did see his father dead he saw his
[1:58:36] father that he wanted to speak to
[1:58:38] and he called his father from the
[1:58:39] dimension and his father came back to
[1:58:42] life
[1:58:42] so when the lord calls you he calls your
[1:58:44] family because the people around you
[1:58:47] to play a part in the ministry and every
[1:58:49] one of us
[1:58:50] every one of you here has a part of the
[1:58:52] ministry of the lord jesus christ
[1:58:54] and what we need to do is to know our
[1:58:56] position in the lord how do you know
[1:58:58] your position in the lord yield to the
[1:59:00] lord
[1:59:02] just yield your heart your mind
[1:59:05] your body your spirit your properties
[1:59:08] your family your house your car

[1:59:20] bring his word to pass
[1:59:22] blessed be the name of the lord glory
[1:59:25] hallelujah to the name of the lord
[1:59:28] so the lord said open your mouth wide
[1:59:30] and i
[1:59:31] will fill it you are the delight of the
[1:59:34] lord
[1:59:35] you are his wife he's doing new things
