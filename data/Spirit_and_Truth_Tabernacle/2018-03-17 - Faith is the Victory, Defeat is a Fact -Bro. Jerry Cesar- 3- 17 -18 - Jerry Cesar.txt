you would allow us to receive something tonight God that we can take away for the rest of our lives well we are grateful and I prayed it you just said your Holy Spirit down onto us Lord some Jesus Christ's name that I pray amen [Music] thank you [Music] god bless you sites I'm very grateful to be here with you guys today I trust you all had a good day turn with me to first John chapter 5 verse 4 last time I was here I was very nervous so definitely a different feeling by grace of God thankful for everyone that I see so I pray that his word can be preached in the rightful way to your hearts today first John chapter 5 verse 4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God this is the this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and this is the spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truth thank you made a load out of blessing to his reading I like to use as a title faith is the victory defeat is a fact so I like to pose a question what is faith we go to Hebrews 11 it tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so see faith is a reality it's your reality of the things that the things that you don't see and it's the proof of what you don't see what you're believing in God for whatever it is that your prayer consists of it depends on your faith your faith will either bring you victory or it'll bring you you know it allowed it already bring you victory or your faith can can get compromised and when you when you fit they're compromised that's when fear settles in right but understand that your faith is supposed to be proven because the right type of faith can only produce victory and if I could just add this only rapturing faith can produce and allow you to get to a rapture so what is the right type of faith if we go to Galatians 5:16 it says this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh so what is your dwelling place it says walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh your faith determines where you go everybody has faith but your dwelling place determines what your faith is going to bring out of it if you're walking in the spirit your faith will produce victory but if you're dwelling in your flesh is going to produce defeat by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God how did he please God if we could just connect the to the few words in the first the first part of that scripture in last it says by faith he please God he walked with God see it wasn't bad it wasn't by sight but it was by faith and and the Bible doesn't tell us so much about Enoch but it tells in Genesis 5 right that that he walked with God and he was not for God took him that's got to be our testimony today you can't wait for the rapture to say that you have faith faith focuses on the now right believing all the things on scene as if there already work if you're dwelling in defeat then it means you never had faith right so God has already given us victory it's been it's been purchased already at the cross but you leave faith it's accepted faith to receive it and faith to keep it see you have to put God first and by putting God first you also have to keep God first I learned that the trials will continue the burdens will increase and the weights will be heavier but no matter what you ask God for putting it into your trials is one that he's not going to fulfill and 1st Peter 1:7 says the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that person though would be tried with fire might be found on to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so your trials are not meant to destroy you but to prove you it's a revelation with the right kind of faith it shows who you are it shows what you're identified right so if you think about all the times you've been tried and to think that the enemy allowed you to get this far it's the enemy that tries you with the seat with the sit with deception but God allows him to try so you can be proven God allows you to go through a trial so that the fruits of his spirit can be reflected what are the fruits of his spirit in Galatians it shows us that it's joy love peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections of less so as a question we all have to come to a point where all the attributes of God has been fulfilled right before before the foundation of the world God already knew you would he set him right you chose sides we all did that but it didn't mean you didn't still have to fight see the children of Israel had to fight every step of the way to claim their victory and when they claimed their victory the fight was still not over see God gives us victory but we all need faith to keep it think that what we need faith in Christ and the spite of their victory as we see the children of Israel they still don't defeat even after that right they forgot their taste of victory they forgot what God had done for them right it's not so much that didn't realize who and and what God was doing but they didn't have enough faith to keep the fire burning they lost sight of their victory and I learned even today you can't fight today's battle with yesterday's faith your faith has to be renewed every single day the thing that you had to overcome yesterday you need a different faiths overcoming today because the enemy's greatest gift is deception he just wants you to know that you're lost and as long as he can get that instill in your mind and your spirit right then you know she's got you but the spite of all of that if we can walk in the spirit being God gives us victory because of our faith right faith is what makes the difference faith is the victory many caught many can't we call on facts and things like that right now in our day of what's going on people leaving a message people leaving the revelation of that God gave to us right what is it that they're leaning on Deerling in there leaning onto their own understanding right the Bible says lean not to your own understanding acknowledge God in all your ways and he shot direct your path right so your faith has to be greater than the fact the facts I learned that God God cannot be figured out all right a fact can only be proven based on something that's already been created but faith has the ability to create so which one is greater fact or your faith faith overcomes death if we go to faith is the victory this is 50 1958 faith is the victory she says bear with me so it says when you come to him don't come to him as a floater paragraph 55 by the way don't come to him as a floater I'll go up and try it and see if it works you'll never get nowhere but when you come with this kind of determination that you have sold out lock stock and barrel when you are tired of the world and sin and unbelief in frustrations and doubts and come to the Living God where they anchor surely tie into the Rock of Ages the Holy Spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the Living God that will give you a faith that will overcome anything that there is in the world sickness disease and even death itself see faith is what overcomes death with the fact see the fact that Lazarus was dead but faith raised them up before you died before he died you couldn't have made it effect until afterwards he was dead see it wasn't that he became a fact but even with that faith overcame faith doesn't wait until it focuses on the now it can create anything out of nothing in church I'm here to tell you can claim victory right now you guys we all have the faith to overcome we all have the faith to create anything out of our uncle wanted circumstances that's the victory God has given us so it isn't our place or position to let the foolish facts out there fool our faith because that's not what work that's not what we're living by that's not our foundation that's not our revelation see our revelation is that Jesus Christ overcame the world and by his Spirit we overcame the word also see faith is the victory but but we we all have to understand that wits with with with victory comes purpose so you can't have victory without first finding purpose what is the life what is the the journey the the money that God has purposed in our hearts right because we're all God's masterpiece but until we've identified what he's purposed for us we won't be able to fulfill his purpose in our lives and that's that's how we we can reflect who God is in our life by allowing his his plans to be fulfilled it's not our plans but his plans our plans got the surrender to his right paragraph 62 now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is it to conquer to conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw it to prison it means that the same that wrongs that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you are you have whipped it you're greater than it is the devil and his plans are far beyond us nothing that he's doing now can disrupt the plans of God and with faith it's got to be unconditional it can't be conditional faith it can't be waiting for something first to happen for us to have faith it has to be faith that believes even when things are not going our way see with faith in James 2:26 it says for the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also see I realized that our next blessings are as close as our next prayer see prayer is the weapon that God has given us to change and to change any and every circumstances that opposes his plans see the word is his is the weapon he's given us prayer is our place to show God who we are to show our circumstances that we have power and authority over it see I can go as much as say faith without pray is dead you can't say you have faith and not pray right because before you pray you have to first believe before you can believe you have to have faith right so prayer gives us dominion over sickness addiction bondage anything that opposes his word and the word is the very thing that defeats the enemy now how do you fight someone that's already been defeated because the enemy is already defeated right see oftentimes the real fight is not with the enemies within ourselves cuz Satan is not omnipresent he can't be everywhere at the same time right so so how is it that he can cause a whole nation to be divided or or or to completely be outside of the will of God right it's his tactics he uses was already ours to corrupt us right Satan is a really God but he tries to be like God right he uses what belongs to us to deceive us right you already have victory but he gives you fear you already are you're already healed but he comes to you with sickness you're already an overcomer but he comes to you in discouragement right everything that's already yours he uses this to deceive you right he's already defeated but his plan is to keep trying and I saw he knows to do they're the same revelation we got he got and the best way to fight someone that's already defeated it's the claim was already yours and that's victory right if this seems hopeless our position in the job is to pray if it seems impossible what we ought to pray if it seems good we ought to still print right see Moses he pleaded with God to preserve his own name and character and not to destroy Israel Hezekiah prayed for deliverance and healing right a godly King about to see his nation conquered and destroyed by the mighty Assyrian army but then he hears from a prophet that he should prepare to die soon so how does he pray in defeat no sir trusting that God was able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask he was able to actually change God's mind God already has something planned for him but he prayed and his prayer changed God's mind David prayed a prayer to surrender to God Jesus Christ he prayed that the father's will be done right so our job as a Christian is to pray by prayer our faith can be led to do greater and bigger things to accept the promises of God because if God gave us a promise then every promise he gave us he's obligated to fulfill we're standing on his word in Matthew 20 21 13 and said and said unto them it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer so by prayer and faith is how we can defeat the enemy I learned that church faith is the only thing that can get us ready to get out of here faith is what allows us to continue this race but our faith has to be dealt with Wheldon in the right things see our spirit has to our spirit is with God we walk with God the reason Enoch was able to be raptured is because he walked with God you know he did fulfill the lusts of his flesh but he walked with God our testimonies got to be the same because we don't have much more time in Ephesians 6 verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand awhile to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having a breastplate of righteousness so see it's our it's our job to make sure that we can identify with making sure we overcome all the things that the devil has are coming our way because as a Christian the fight doesn't get easier but we're promised to get there and and no matter what it is that's come our way we already have victory to Jesus Christ see last Sunday pastor Jack was saying we have to get into the spirit and I thought it was appropriate to go over this again this is making a valley full of ditches 1956 it says and the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual revival where the hallelujahs of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an old-fashioned Holy Ghost sent revival hits the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things then you'll wonder why these real Christians are hanging on while they're praying for you what a revival and he got into the spirit now the reason these people have dances is that they if they didn't have a dance so they could get into the spirit of dancing you can't have a bell game unless you get in the spirit of a ball game you have got to get into the spirit of it and we can never have a revival in a seventh port or anything else until church gets into the spirit of revival God can come and perform miracles he can show us wonders he can stretch forth his arm his hand to heal the sick and afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there never be a revival until the church gets in the spirit of it so we have to get into the spirit of revival no matter what is it well no matter what it is is going on today God is still the same yesterday today and forever right redemption has a name that's Jesus victory has a name that's Jesus healing has a name that's Jesus 19:58 hear his voice like to also read this says God has a new birth for you but listen to his still small voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians to get yourself quiet before him don't let the work don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him get up in the woods somewhere and get out of the side of the road and go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids get at school there get down on your knees you've heard all the voices you've heard all the noises but you've got to go there and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift it up it'll change you to make you different it'll make you the kind of Christian you ought to be so Church we're living at a time where prayer has to be our foundation faith is our victory and we have to accept every all the promises of God it says clearly that we've already overcame the world and and and this is the faith that God has given us so we have to keep prop we have to keep the race we have to keep overcoming all the trials in all the battles because the truth is we have everything we need to get to where we want to be we're just suppose in this in this world and it's earth I'm just allowing the promises of God to be fulfilled no matter who and what is coming with what they have manat enough to interrupt or disrupt what God has done for us and what he's given us already because faith is is something that no matter who you are you have it but what your dwelling determines where you go so I'm very very grateful I know there's there's a little bit more but with what God has allowed me to to do faith I realize is the only thing that's that's holding this world together and and and despite of all the horrific acts and in this world the light of this world is us here and and and when we're finally removed from the scenes there'll be a tribulation there'll be a destruction and we we have to praise the Lord that that we're in a position where we won't have to see those things and it's our job to stay away and stay in tune stay in tune with the Spirit of God that he can prepare us and get us ready for what's getting ready to happen may the Lord add a blessing say his word thank you thank you lord is the Lord for brother Jerry that's certainly a wonderful thought there man faith is a victory defeat is a fact and there was the that your faith has to be greater than facts right I say that now that's that's pretty good you know you especially when you you know you see all the stuff you know floating on the internet or whatever it is social media about the message you know and now somebody recently was telling me that they couldn't they couldn't find the fact was they could not find 16 men that fell off a bridge and brother branham said that you know these people would fall off the bridge and they couldn't find that you know so the fact was they couldn't find it so their facts said that it didn't happen and that the Prophet was not telling the truth and when they brought that to my attention I you know said let's let's go back to that time period you know you couldn't find that I'm sure they did a Google search and couldn't find it not that Google has everything but nonetheless they trust Google over the Word of God right so I said let's go back to that time and let's just think about it I mean really really think about it if you were the boss of a company that was pouring concrete and on your job 16 men died while he was pouring concrete why use building this bridge would you want the rest of the people to know that this just happened on the job or would you try to cover it up so that you can get this job finished I said most people that are in that business it would get covered up and the only way you would know it would happen is that a prophet have to tell you cousin to be covered up right it's just no way that they released information like that so the media puts out there they want to put out there or what is control as to what was being spoken and and and that's why we thank God for a prophet you know that can kind of tell the secrets you know that happened in the Bible remember it was the Elijah I believe it was and and he was telling no Elijah and he's told that the King you know to avoid certain places because this other king was coming in to fight him and I think if the King does series like well do I have a spy in my camp or what's going on saying how does this fan know these things before I get this now it's though spot down here Oh King don't kill nobody don't go don't go off the rock and kill nobody they got a prophet in the land and that prophet know what you thinking in your bedchamber okay so you know these things you know we our fate takes us beyond facts and we're so grateful for that thank you thank you brother Jerry god bless you god bless you hey man we just we just appreciate the Lord we thank you all a man for coming out tonight and just being a part of service that know that we're all leaving here strengthened and encouraged a man from the word that we heard and just being in his presence a
