[19:56] Precious Lord, we come humbly before
[19:59] your throne of grace, Lord, we thank
[20:01] you, Lord, for this glorious privilege
[20:03] of entering into the house of God,
[20:05] Father. Lord, sometimes we fail to
[20:09] realize, Lord, that it's you inviting
[20:11] us. It's your house, Lord. So, we're not
[20:13] inviting you into your own home. You're
[20:15] inviting us to come before you. You're
[20:17] summoning us [music] to come and stand
[20:19] in your presence, Lord, to offer praise
[20:21] and thanksgiving, Lord, oh Father, and
[20:24] to bless and praise your holy name and
[20:26] to hear your word as you would speak,
[20:28] Father. You have prepared a ser a
[20:30] servant, Lord, Brother Willie, Lord. And
[20:32] we just pray for him, Lord. Help him to
[20:34] get himself out of the way. Anoint him,
[20:36] use him, speak to him and through him,
[20:38] Lord Jesus. Lord, we desire to hear your
[20:41] word. It's what we feed on, Lord. We are
[20:44] what we eat, Lord Jesus. And we want to
[20:46] be the [music] word. And Father, we want
[20:48] to pray, Lord God, for brother Maris and
[20:50] his family, Lord, after losing a
[20:52] matriarch, Lord Jesus. Father, she was
[20:55] the one that held the family together.
[20:57] Father, I just pray, Lord, that you
[20:59] would comfort each of their hearts,
[21:00] Lord. Strengthen his grandfather, Lord
[21:03] Jesus, and strengthen Brother Maris and
[21:05] the family, Lord God, and comfort them
[21:07] as only you can, Father. You are the
[21:10] living God, Lord, that he's leaning
[21:11] upon, Father. Sister Amanda is leaning
[21:14] upon you as well, Father. She has need
[21:16] of comfort, Lord. Father, help her
[21:18] during this time. Help her family, Lord
[21:20] Jesus. Oh, Father, move throughout the
[21:22] families, Lord God, to if it's just one
[21:24] soul, Lord, you're seeking to save,
[21:26] Lord. Do the work, Lord Jesus. We're
[21:29] trusting you and we're committing
[21:30] [music] these families into your hands,
[21:32] Lord. Father, we pray [clears throat]
[21:35] for Sister Michelle's mother, Lord
[21:37] Jesus. Father, she had a fall, Lord
[21:40] Jesus, and she's getting up there, Lord
[21:42] Jesus, and she needs a touch from you.
[21:45] Father, if you can touch Sarah's body,
[21:48] Lord Jesus, you can touch Sister [music]
[21:50] Michelle's mother's body, Lord. Father,
[21:53] we know you are the healer, Lord Jesus.
[21:56] And Father, we put all of our confidence
[21:58] in you that the work is already done.
[22:00] So, we place our faith along with Sister
[22:02] [music] Michelle's, Lord, believing for
[22:04] her mother, Lord, that she'll receive a
[22:06] complete healing, Father. Father, we
[22:08] pray for our brothers and sisters
[22:09] that'll be traveling back, Lord God,
[22:11] from Australia. Keep them safe, out of
[22:14] harm's way, Lord Jesus. And may you be
[22:16] with them. May you anoint the pilot to
[22:18] do his work. Oh, Father, may they have
[22:21] no issues, Lord,
[22:23] going from one plane to the next, Lord.
[22:25] May they arrive home safely, on time,
[22:27] and give them rest to their bodies.
[22:29] [clears throat]
[22:30] And Father, we have need of you now.
[22:33] Come and have your way in your service,
[22:35] Lord [music] Jesus. Father, bless our
[22:37] giving, Lord, as we have prepared our
[22:38] hearts to give to you, Lord, from that
[22:41] what you have given us. We thank [music]
[22:43] you so much. And it's with a grateful
[22:44] heart, Lord, that we return unto you the
[22:47] portion, Lord, that you have laid upon
[22:48] our hearts to give. Thank you, Lord.
[22:50] Bless your people, Lord, oh Father, and
[22:52] fulfill Brother Quinton's prayer
[22:54] concerning [music] each of their
[22:56] finances, Lord, as our s sincere prayer.
[22:59] We commit all things to you now in the
[23:01] name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and
[23:02] Savior. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother
[23:05] Maris will come.
[23:10] Hallelujah.
[23:19] God bless you.
[23:25] I couldn't seem to fall [singing]
[23:27] asleep.
[23:29] There was so much on my mind.
[23:34] searching for that peace,
[23:38] the peace I could not find.
[23:43] But then I kneel down to pray,
[23:47] praying, "Help me, please."
[23:52] He said, "Don't have to cry
[23:55] cuz I'll supply all your needs soon as I
[24:01] stop worrying.
[24:04] worrying how the story ends.
[24:08] When I let go and I let God,
[24:14] I let God have his way. That's when
[24:19] things start happening.
[24:22] And I stopped looking at back then.
[24:27] I let go and I let go.
[24:32] I let God have his way. I let go
[24:38] and let God.
[24:41] I let go
[24:43] and I let God.
[24:46] I let go.
[24:48] And I let God.
[24:51] I let go.
[24:54] I let go. [gasps]
[24:56] [sighs] There's so much going on.
[25:01] Sometimes I can't find my way
[25:06] and often times I struggle.
[25:11] Struggle from day to day.
[25:15] I have to realize it's not my battle.
[25:18] [singing]
[25:19] It's not my battle to fight.
[25:23] I have to know if I put it in your
[25:26] hands,
[25:28] everything [screaming] will be all
[25:30] right. As soon as I stop worrying,
[25:37] worrying [screaming]
[25:38] how the story ends,
[25:41] I let go and I let God.
[25:47] I let God have it. I swear
[25:53] when I stopped looking back
[25:57] looking at back then
[26:00] when I let go and I let God
[26:06] I let God have his way. Let go
[26:11] and let God
[26:14] and let go. Oh, I let go.
[26:19] My brother,
[26:21] my sister,
[26:24] I let go

[26:29] As soon as I stop worrying
[26:34] worrying how the story ends,
[26:39] I let go and I let go.
[26:44] I let God have his way is that's when
[26:49] things start happening
[26:53] and I stop looking at back then

[27:26] things start happening.

[43:18] morning. Y'all just continue to pray for
[43:21] us.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to definitely try to get
[43:24] some of this dust off my voice.
[43:28] Man,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; I used to could hit some notes, but I
[43:33] don't I you know, they say you don't use
[43:35] it, you lose it.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; But, uh, I'm going try not to lose it. I
[43:41] done lost a lot of stuff, but I don't
[43:42] want to lose. Let us look at a couple of
[43:45] places in the scripture. Let's remember
[43:48] the saints u in Australia. [snorts] It
[43:52] look like they was having a good time. I
[43:55] I saw a little clip. It was brother
[43:57] Larry was singing and had all the fellas
[43:59] in the back. They like to do that, you
[44:02] know, all get together and they just be
[44:04] up there having a good time. The Saints
[44:07] was jumping all up and down. Even even
[44:10] had uh brother Quint. I see they they
[44:14] put and he you know he ain't have a
[44:17] whole lot of he it don't look like he
[44:19] got a whole lot of rhythm and stuff and
[44:22] he was like WELL EVERYBODY LET ME TRY TO
[44:24] GET me a little something and I just so
[44:27] I was so tickled. I say, "Bro, brother,"
[44:30] uh, Quinn said, "Well, Y'ALL GET ALL
[44:32] THIS BY Y'ALL.
[44:34] I'mma get me a little sub of this here."
[44:37] Romans chapter 8. Um, I got a place in
[44:41] there. This these scriptures ain't going
[44:44] to really make sense probably to y'all
[44:47] until I start talking. But, uh, we want
[44:49] to read Romans 8 and 14.
[44:54] It says as for as many as are led by the
[44:58] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[45:03] And then one place in in first Peter
[45:07] chapter uh five.
[45:13] Oh my.
[45:16] 1 Peter 5 and8
[45:20] it says be sober be vigilant because
[45:23] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[45:25] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[45:30] devour.
[45:32] Uh whom resist steadfast in the faith
[45:35] knowing that the same afflictions are
[45:38] accomplish in your brethren that
[45:40] [snorts] are in the world.
[45:43] But the God of all grace, whom has
[45:45] called us into an eternal glory by Jesus
[45:49] Christ, after that ye have suffered a
[45:53] while, make your uh make you perfect
[45:57] uh establish, strengthen, and settle
[46:00] you. Let us bow our heads for a word of
[46:02] prayer. Gracious Father, we just come
[46:04] this morning to just give thanks and
[46:06] praise for just allowing us this
[46:09] opportunity to uh be in the service of
[46:12] the living God uh this morning.
[46:16] We just pray that, Father, that you'd
[46:19] have your way uh in the service, Lord.
[46:22] Take control of our our lips, Lord
[46:25] Jesus. And we just trust that we could
[46:27] be edifying in Jesus Christ's wonderful
[46:30] name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[46:34] uh this morning from the scriptures like
[46:38] I said it'll take a minute uh cuz you
[46:42] know when I was looking at the
[46:43] scriptures I was like well praise the
[46:45] Lord we just have to comment and
[46:47] hopefully uh we could make some sense
[46:49] this morning y'all y'all pray for me
[46:51] also this morning it's been a it's been
[46:53] a while since we've kind of exercised
[46:56] the gift so it it may take a few minutes
[46:59] to get out of the way but um we want to
[47:02] talk on a little subject, true
[47:03] connection.
[47:05] Um, just maybe uh the early part of the
[47:08] week, I was I was just kind of in
[47:10] prayer. I was totally studying something
[47:13] totally totally different. I I wanted to
[47:17] uh uh preach on earnestly content for
[47:20] the faith. But you know, I was I was
[47:23] praying and and uh just the word
[47:27] connection just in prayer just kind of
[47:30] came to our heart and uh you know it got
[47:33] it got so strong that I had to get off
[47:36] my knees and write it down before I
[47:38] forget. And I picked up my pen and
[47:41] started trying to uh uh uh write some
[47:44] notes and different things. And so y'all
[47:47] y'all y'all pray for us this morning.
[47:50] Like we say um uh I I have an objective
[47:54] this morning. Uh there's something in my
[47:57] heart. You know, always when I'm
[47:58] preaching, I I I have an objective. is
[48:02] not to uh belittle anybody or anything,
[48:06] but it's to try to transform
[48:10] uh just the the way that we we think as
[48:15] as individuals. Is that right? Um, it it
[48:19] takes I'm I'm realizing this more and
[48:21] more as as I go along and live life. Um,
[48:25] as as as a servant of God, as a
[48:28] Christian, as as an individual,
[48:31] uh, I realize how how much I need
[48:36] transformation in the way that I think,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; in the way that uh, I approach things.
[48:44] Is that right? it be because you know th
[48:48] this thing is it's it's all about it's
[48:50] it's all about being being productive
[48:54] being overcomers. Is that right?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Uh and and just learning how to think
[49:02] right. [laughter]
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Because you know the Bible say
[49:06] there's there's there's a a a just a way
[49:10] that that seem right. And a lot of times
[49:15] sometimes those things aren't right
[49:18] &gt;&gt; because because we have no basis for
[49:21] those things.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And and you know I always want us to
[49:26] keep in mind YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE IN A
[49:29] BATTLE CHURCH. Is that right?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're in a battle. This is
[49:33] not a picnic. you know, the scripture,
[49:36] we we got to keep certain uh uh THINGS
[49:40] IN OUR MINDS as as we're going along and
[49:44] and we're walking this this this
[49:48] Christian life which
[49:50] uh consists of A NATURAL PART AND A
[49:55] SPIRITUAL PART.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND AND YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO
[50:00] APPROACH BOTH.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? in in in order to keep
[50:06] from to keep from um being deceived
[50:12] CUZ THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "SEE THAT NO MAN
[50:14] deceives us."
[50:16] &gt;&gt; So we we we WE DON'T WANT TO BE WE DON'T
[50:19] WANT TO BE THROWN OFF. WE DON'T WANT TO
[50:21] BE OUT here on on an island and and you
[50:25] know just don't know where we're going.
[50:26] We don't want know know what we're
[50:28] doing. Is that right? YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
[50:31] I WISH I wish I COULD HAVE BEEN A part
[50:35] of a ministry,
[50:37] you know, especially as as a young
[50:39] person uh uh where where
[50:43] UH MY THINKING WAS CHALLENGED.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; AND AND I WAS GIVEN INFORMATION to teach
[50:52] ME HOW TO THINK.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Come on, preach with me, church.
[50:57] I know we missing a lot of folk, but
[50:59] y'all, we come to have church,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; you know, TO TEACH ME HOW TO THINK.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; AND AND WHAT'S MY APPROACH TO THOUGHT?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND AND WHAT AM I BASING MY
[51:12] THINKING UPON?
[51:15] Is that right?
[51:16] WHEN WHEN WHEN WE LOOK BACK TO THE BOOK
[51:19] OF GENESIS,
[51:21] uh I always go back there because
[51:23] brother Brandham teaches us that sir,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; you always got to go back to the
[51:28] beginning to do to get the uh fullest
[51:32] and truth perspective of a thing.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Outside of that, uh uh
[51:40] you you just don't really get the full
[51:42] picture of it.
[51:44] The first the first place where we see
[51:48] true connection is in the book of
[51:51] Genesis,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Uh
[51:55] y'all pray for me. I got a little quote
[51:58] I want to read. Um it's is in Genesis,
[52:03] right? With with you know
[52:06] Adam and Eve and God. THAT WAS THE
[52:10] truest
[52:11] connection,
[52:13] right, that we'll find anywhere. The
[52:16] truest connection. Is that right? A a
[52:19] perfect connection
[52:22] based upon uh uh um eternal principles.
[52:28] Is that right?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; UH BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY [screaming]
[52:31] HAD, YOU KNOW, THE THE PERFECT
[52:34] INTERPRETATION of the word. Is that
[52:37] right? SEE CHURCH, ONE OF THE THINGS
[52:39] THAT I I'VE LEARNED, you know, in
[52:41] studying the message, YOU YOU GOT TO
[52:44] HAVE THE [screaming] RIGHT BASIS,
[52:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YOU YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT
[52:50] BASIS
[52:51] uh uh uh for
[52:54] connection
[52:56] &gt;&gt; or fellowship.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; If if it's GOING TO BE A TRUE
[53:01] CONNECTION, IT'S GOT TO BE BASED UPON
[53:04] SOMETHING,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU KNOW, I YOU KNOW, GROWING UP,
[53:08] I I WAS I HAD A lot of different
[53:12] connections, but you know, when when I
[53:15] LOOK AT IT NOW, I CAN SEE it really
[53:17] wasn't based on anything that could be
[53:21] longlasting,
[53:23] &gt;&gt; anything that could be productive. It
[53:26] wasn't nothing that that I could it
[53:29] could have elevated me
[53:31] &gt;&gt; to to the spots that I desired
[53:34] [screaming]
[53:35] &gt;&gt; right to be. IS THAT RIGHT?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; ONE ONE THING I'LL TELL Y'ALL CHURCH, I
[53:41] DON'T FOOL WITH EVERYBODY.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I just hate to say it like that, but you
[53:47] know, I've I've kind of grown up. you
[53:49] know, I'm I'm I'm a lot older, but you
[53:52] know, uh I just I'm just a funny type of
[53:55] person that I am who I am, but but I'M
[53:58] NOT A KID ANYMORE.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm really not a kid anymore.
[54:04] So, if if if in my approach to things,
[54:08] if if certain things aren't there, then
[54:12] you're not going to really find me kind
[54:14] of there,
[54:16] &gt;&gt; right? Come on, preach with me, church.
[54:18] Y'all real quiet.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; I know I ain't preached in a while, but
[54:23] you know, I'm like, brother Wes, I think
[54:25] I'm preaching real good.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; See, be be because, YOU KNOW, IN MY
[54:31] APPROACH THIS MORNING, YOU KNOW, WE JUST
[54:34] WANT TO CHALLENGE THE WAY that that that
[54:38] you you look at things. You look at
[54:41] life,
[54:42] &gt;&gt; you you look at uh uh connections and
[54:45] people that you come in contact with and
[54:48] things of that nature. Is that right?
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know,
[54:53] Eve and Adam AND GOD, THEY HAD
[54:56] [screaming] THEY HAD THE RIGHT KIND OF
[54:57] CONNECTION. They had the truest uh uh uh
[55:01] connection.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; But then I WANT TO SHOW US SOMETHING.
[55:08] Watch
[55:09] the connection
[55:12] that that Eve had with the serpent,
[55:16] &gt;&gt; right? The the Watch something here,
[55:20] Brother Brandham said. And And IT'S
[55:23] WEIRD BECAUSE
[55:25] SHE HAD EVERYTHING.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Every everything was in divine order.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, everything was in oneness.
[55:34] Everything was in agreement.
[55:37] IT COULDN'T GET NO BETTER,
[55:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT THE PROPHET OF GOD MAKES A
[55:43] STATEMENT. HE SAY Eve lusted.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; She lusted
[55:50] &gt;&gt; to be smart.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; She lusted. Now, y'all can pull it up if
[55:55] you want to for a PhD. Now, I I ain't
[55:58] got a I ain't got all the quotes with
[56:00] me, but I know it's in there cuz I read
[56:02] them already the early part of the week.
[56:03] Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; She she lusted,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; right, to be smart.
[56:10] Uh she had more information right from
[56:14] the beginning than she knew what to do
[56:16] with
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You know, it's and it's weird BECAUSE
[56:22] YOU YOU WATCH PEOPLE AND AND I'VE
[56:25] WATCHED people from my position, right?
[56:29] YOU KNOW, YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE have
[56:32] been given more information than they've
[56:36] ever had. Amen. IN THEIR ENTIRE
[56:39] [screaming] LIVES AS CHRISTIANS.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AS CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
[56:45] MORE. LISTEN, CHURCH. BECAUSE WE HAVE AN
[56:49] OPEN [screaming] BOOK,
[56:51] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE'RE NOT PREACHING FROM A CLOSED
[56:53] BOOK.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; WE WE HAVE THE MIND [screaming] OF GOD.
[56:56] RIGHT?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; THE INTELLIGENCE OF GOD,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; ALL OF WHAT GOD [screaming]
[57:02] THOUGHT ABOUT US,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. I MEAN, WE WE HAVE
[57:08] A A YOU KNOW, A THINKING MAN'S FILTER.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WE CAN RUN ALL OF [screaming]
[57:13] OUR THOUGHTS THROUGH. AND THAT'S
[57:15] IMPORTANT.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful message, I tell you.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[57:21] BUT YET AND [screaming] STILL FOR A LOT
[57:24] OF people
[57:26] &gt;&gt; is not enough.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; AND AND NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL WE'VE WE'VE
[57:33] PREACHED
[57:35] AND WE'VE HEARD THE WORD PREACH FOR A
[57:38] lot of people. And I'm talking about
[57:39] people who have shouted.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; People that have screamed. People that
[57:44] have run around the church and
[57:46] everything else. But you know THEY THEY
[57:50] STILL WASN'T SETTLED,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And see, you know, without the baptism
[57:58] of the Holy Ghost, you you you're not
[58:00] going to be settled,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz you're not really
[58:04] understanding.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; It's emotional and maybe intellectual.
[58:10] It take the baptism of the Holy Ghost TO
[58:13] GIVE REVELATION.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. like like Peter, who do you say
[58:17] that I the son of man am?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT THAT DIDN'T COME FROM HUMAN
[58:22] INSTRUMENTALITY,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? UH THAT RE BECAUSE THE OTHER
[58:28] BRETHREN AROUND HIM COULDN'T SPEAK UP.
[58:31] THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT SPOKE from
[58:33] within Peter.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A REVELATION COMING TO HIM FROM
[58:39] GOD.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:42] And see, you know, the prophet says
[58:44] revelation,
[58:46] you know, means more to us than
[58:50] we could imagine.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I I enjoy coming to church.
[58:57] I enjoy the excitement of it. But but
[59:00] what means more to me uh uh is the
[59:04] revelation of the word striking my
[59:06] heart. BE BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT'S THE
[59:10] THING THAT'S GOING TO KEEP me when the
[59:12] enemy TRYING TO BRING SADNESS DOWN UPON
[59:16] ME.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Oppression and depression and things of
[59:19] that nature. THAT'S THE THING THAT
[59:22] ELEVATES ME.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, and and here here's
[59:28] the thing, church, you know, um when
[59:32] when people when people are are are
[59:37] looking for for things and lusting for
[59:40] things that's contrary to biblical
[59:44] principles,
[59:45] A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE THEY'RE MOST
[59:49] VULNERABLE.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, T.
[59:54] They're they're most vulnerable,
[59:57] right? See, it means to be susceptible
[1:00:02] to physical and emotional attack,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. A LOT OF TIMES, YOU KNOW,
[1:00:11] you you watch people and you you see how
[1:00:15] susceptible people are to the attacks of
[1:00:20] the enemy,
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,
[1:00:25] PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; TO THE ATTACKS OF THE ENEMY. YOU NEVER
[1:00:31] WILL BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE ATTACKS OF
[1:00:35] THE ENEMY APART FROM THE WORD.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; AND SEE, I'MMA TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING,
[1:00:41] CHURCH. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY [screaming]
[1:00:43] GOD GIVES US SHEPHERDS.
[1:00:48] SEE,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE WALK AROUND WE WE
[1:00:51] WALK AROUND WE ARROGANT AND WE PUFFED UP
[1:00:54] AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND YOU DON'T
[1:00:56] EVEN REALIZE APART FROM YOU KNOW THE GOD
[1:01:02] [screaming]
[1:01:02] ANOINTING THE SHEPHERD GIVING US
[1:01:06] SOMETHING to uh help us to elevate AND
[1:01:11] TO HELP US TO THINK A DIFFERENT WAY and
[1:01:15] approach a THING FROM A DIFFERENT
[1:01:17] STANDPOINT, WE'D be in trouble. We'd all
[1:01:19] be wiped out.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; You and me both.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, now we've been DOING
[1:01:25] THIS A LITTLE WHILE AND AND I'VE WATCHED
[1:01:28] CHURCH AND I WATCH PEOPLE AND I'M NOT
[1:01:31] SAYING THIS TO SAY THAT I KNOW IT ALL
[1:01:34] BECAUSE I GOT MY ISSUES AND EVERYTHING
[1:01:36] TOO, BUT YOU KNOW, I GOT A GIFT.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WORKING WITHIN ME,
[1:01:43] RIGHT? AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I
[1:01:45] COULD SEE YOU.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. APART FROM THAT, THEN YOU DON'T
[1:01:49] YOU DON'T REALLY SEE. YOU SAY, "AH, NO,
[1:01:51] MAN. I not me, brother Smiley."
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, you.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF TIMES THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE
[1:01:59] THEY KNOW IT ALL are the people who know
[1:02:01] the less,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; right? Are the people who the are the
[1:02:07] most vulnerable.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; SEE, THINK ABOUT WHAT I JUST SAID. Eve
[1:02:15] was lusting for something,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; She she WAS SHE WAS LUSTING FOR
[1:02:22] something and and and the the ENEMY CAME
[1:02:26] IN BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO ALWAYS
[1:02:28] KEEP IN MIND EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT HE'S
[1:02:32] TRYING TO STEAL, KILL, AND DESTROY.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; HE HE'S TRYING TO ONE UP.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE'S ALWAYS [screaming]
[1:02:39] TRYING TO ONE UP THE CHURCH, ONE UP THE
[1:02:42] INDIVIDUAL.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; But we got his number this morning.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; SEE, LIKE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY,
[1:02:51] [screaming] WE GOT TO STRIP HIM DOWN BY
[1:02:53] THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU GOT TO SEE THESE THINGS BY THE
[1:02:57] SCRIPTURE. YES, SIR.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. WE'LL BACK UP. THE TRUEST
[1:03:04] CONNECTION,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; THE TRUEST BOND [screaming] THAT THERE
[1:03:08] WAS WAS IN THE BEGINNING IN GENESIS,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; THEN THEN WATCH THEN WATCH EVE. AND WE
[1:03:17] AIN'T women bashing. We ain't no
[1:03:18] bashing.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to give information and
[1:03:23] truth. And now y'all do with it what you
[1:03:25] want when I get done.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You can throw it in the trash,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; right? But think on it. Ponder it.
[1:03:33] SHE SHE
[1:03:35] GOT on a connection,
[1:03:38] right, with with the serpent,
[1:03:42] right? Glory to God. Uh
[1:03:46] without THE RIGHT KIND OF THOUGHT
[1:03:48] PROCESS,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz let let me let me just read this
[1:03:55] this right quick and then we'll we'll
[1:03:57] try to move on. Uh y'all right this
[1:04:00] morning?
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:04] Now uh
[1:04:07] in the message led by the spirit it says
[1:04:10] and and and
[1:04:12] let me make sure and how one of the most
[1:04:14] wonderful things of God and the con is
[1:04:18] the connection
[1:04:20] of the fellowship between God and the
[1:04:23] Christian is that uh
[1:04:27] they are son sons of God and are led by
[1:04:31] the spirit of God.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Let me read that again because that's
[1:04:35] that's a powerful powerful statement,
[1:04:37] right? He says uh one of the most
[1:04:41] wonderful things of God and the
[1:04:44] Christian, he says the connection of the
[1:04:47] fellowship between God and the Christian
[1:04:50] is that they are sons of God led by the
[1:04:53] spirit of God.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And and and I got some some things later
[1:04:59] on. LISTEN, OUR FELLOWSHIP HAS GOT TO BE
[1:05:03] BASED upon something.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's got to be based upon
[1:05:11] something. I've been toiling with this
[1:05:14] thought all week long. I ain't been able
[1:05:15] to sleep hardly. I might be able to get
[1:05:18] me some rest tonight.
[1:05:24] bec because you you realize it it be so
[1:05:27] it be so much
[1:05:31] material. Yes.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he says,
[1:05:36] "Now, now fellowship comes by love."
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; See, LISTEN, CHURCH, THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:05:42] BASIS,
[1:05:44] RIGHT? There there's got to be a basis
[1:05:48] for for these different things, right?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Uh because
[1:05:54] IF NOT, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[1:05:56] PART OF.
[1:05:58] And see, see for me,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; if if I have a connection,
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; man, I want I want to know what I'M A
[1:06:05] PART OF,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT DOES THIS THING ENTAILS,
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT ROOTED and grounded
[1:06:15] in?
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I got I gota I got
[1:06:20] there, you know, uh I'll get back to
[1:06:22] that in a second. I'm I'm over the all
[1:06:25] over the place.
[1:06:27] Um
[1:06:29] in watch this in my connections
[1:06:34] CERTAIN QUESTIONS HAS TO BE ANSWERED
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; AND SATISI AND SATISFIED IT'S WITHOUT
[1:06:43] QUESTION SEE YOU YOU watch you watch the
[1:06:48] younger generation [snorts]
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; uh
[1:06:52] even older we we make these connections
[1:06:56] Right. And and we don't have any
[1:06:59] questions.
[1:07:01] We're not satisfied. And we we just in
[1:07:04] these things happy golucky.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; AND AND NOT REALIZING
[1:07:10] THE DETRIMENT,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THE THE detriment of of
[1:07:17] these DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE WE GO IN
[1:07:21] AND AND WE'RE NOT BEING LED BY THE
[1:07:23] SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:07:26] LEADS YOU BY THE WORD.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS. ALWAYS.
[1:07:33] Whether it's uh UH OR UH BUSINESS OR
[1:07:36] WHETHER it's it's you know you want to
[1:07:39] be CONNECTED WITH A GIRL OR A BOY, GOD
[1:07:42] IS GOING TO LEAD YOU INTO THESE THINGS
[1:07:45] BY THE WORD.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE A BASIS FOR THESE THINGS,
[1:07:50] A FOUNDATION FOR YOU TO BUILD UPON.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. GLORY TO GOD. AND IN ANYTHING,
[1:07:57] WATCH GOD. GOD [screaming] ALWAYS BUILD
[1:07:59] A THING ON ON SOMETHING SOLID. AND THE
[1:08:04] ONLY SOLID THING THAT THERE IS IS THE
[1:08:06] [screaming] WORD. UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL
[1:08:09] BUILD MY CHURCH. AND THE GATES OF HELL
[1:08:12] WON'T BE ABLE TO PREVAIL against that.
[1:08:14] Right.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This thing has got to be on
[1:08:17] Christ.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; See, even even in our approach to
[1:08:22] church, right? THIS THING IS FOR ME. I'M
[1:08:27] NOT HERE JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I want
[1:08:30] to be part of something. Man, this thing
[1:08:33] has got to be scripturally based for me.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[1:08:38] IT'S IT'S GOT TO BE, YOU KNOW, ONCE UPON
[1:08:42] A TIME WHEN I FIRST GOT CONVERTED AND
[1:08:44] EVERYTHING, I WAS I WAS FINE. BUT THEN I
[1:08:47] START HAVING PROBLEMS
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; WITHIN MY HEART BECAUSE,
[1:08:52] YOU KNOW, THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD
[1:08:56] WEREN'T SETTLED.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; SO IF [screaming] THE QUESTIONS WASN'T
[1:09:00] SETTLED,
[1:09:02] YOU KNOW, OR SATISFIED, THEN I WASN'T
[1:09:05] SETTLED.
[1:09:08] RIGHT. I WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
[1:09:10] WISHYWASHY.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS THIS IS THE THING WITH PEOPLE,
[1:09:15] YOU KNOW, THEY WISHY-WASHY. THEY IN AND
[1:09:18] OUT. They
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; is because they don't even know the
[1:09:24] questions to ask.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:29] Look, you look at the Queen of Sheba in
[1:09:32] um
[1:09:34] 2 Chronicles
[1:09:37] uh chapter nine. Let's let's kind of
[1:09:39] read that. Y'all could pull that up for
[1:09:41] me if y'all don't mind. Maybe I got it
[1:09:46] biblically.
[1:09:48] Right. When I I I was reading this, it
[1:09:52] this this shows you this shows you the
[1:09:55] maturity
[1:09:57] of of this lady cuz she SHE WAS MAKING A
[1:10:02] BIG SACRIFICE,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Come on. She was going through
[1:10:07] the desert with all of this stuff and
[1:10:10] you know she would had been hearing
[1:10:12] about a certain you know re movement
[1:10:15] revival and and and she she
[1:10:20] wasn't willing to make full uh
[1:10:25] commitment TO THE THING WITHOUT ASKING
[1:10:28] QUESTIONS. And just an analogy that had
[1:10:32] been whirling around in in in my head.
[1:10:34] It's almost like, you know, you're in a
[1:10:36] hotel room and I don't know for you, I
[1:10:38] don't trust folk. So, I I latch that
[1:10:41] bottom lock and then I I like to latch
[1:10:43] that other one that you know, you slide
[1:10:46] that that's you know, uh you you could
[1:10:50] open it, but it ain't nobody could still
[1:10:53] get access to your room
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; CUZ IT SLIDES just enough so you could
[1:10:58] peep out of it and talk. Yeah. May I
[1:11:00] help you? Who are you?
[1:11:04] Glory to God. See, I ain't THE TYPE TO
[1:11:06] JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND NO, NO, NO, NO,
[1:11:10] NO, NO. I'm tell I don't cuz I don't
[1:11:13] want you to HAVE ACCESS TO ME BECAUSE I
[1:11:15] don't really fully know who you are.

[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Well, y'all listen. I probably was
[1:25:16] considered a cruel dad
[1:25:19] with the way that I raised my children.
[1:25:22] And I know my family members thought
[1:25:24] that I was very odd. You don't let them
[1:25:26] kids do nothing, you know. And my my my
[1:25:29] friends, well, you don't let them kids,
[1:25:31] man. Y'all kids. I'm like, bro, kids
[1:25:34] find a way to get the wrong information.
[1:25:36] Don't kid yourself. I don't care how but
[1:25:39] you take them to church.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Huh? Cuz that cuz there's there's
[1:25:44] connections, COUSINS AND ALL SORTS of
[1:25:48] folk, right?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And then you get and then right there,
[1:25:52] brothers and sisters sometimes too
[1:25:54] because some of them ain't even saved.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Some of them in your own,
[1:26:02] you know, out of your kids, they got
[1:26:04] different mindsets.
[1:26:06] You know,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; And and you trying to and you trying to

[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But see, he says, uh uh
[1:26:24] you got to know what you're looking for.
[1:26:26] What will our connections be based upon?
[1:26:32] Right? Come on. IF I'M A PART OF THIS,
[1:26:37] what is the basis?
[1:26:39] Cuz because I'm a Christian,
[1:26:43] right? I'm a I'm a Christian and and
[1:26:49] it I WANTED our connection to be
[1:26:54] 100%
[1:26:57] uh biblically based,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:04] NOT JUST GOOD DEEDS,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; we got to go further than that,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE IF I WANT TO BE A
[1:27:12] CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MAYBE
[1:27:14] good deeds, at least I want to make
[1:27:17] sure,
[1:27:18] you know, the on the foundation is uh
[1:27:23] Christianbased,
[1:27:25] right?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT I I DON'T WANT I don't WANT
[1:27:29] IT TO BE SECULARLY BASED. RIGHT.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And then and then AS YOU GO UP, it's
[1:27:37] like there's there's nothing there's
[1:27:40] nothing for me to really base this
[1:27:42] connection upon. This is just all this
[1:27:45] is all just just worldly and worldly
[1:27:48] influence and and and and there's
[1:27:52] there's a disconnect here,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; right? GLORY TO GOD. SEE, I REALIZE
[1:27:59] THERE'S BEEN A MAN THAT TURNED ON THE
[1:28:01] LIGHTS FOR ME.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:28:09] WHEN WHEN THE LIGHTS IS TURNED DOWN OFF,
[1:28:11] then you scream.
[1:28:14] [screaming]
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; If y'all know the story,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; right? The little girl, she was fine as
[1:28:20] long as she could see light.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; She could walk in the light. Y'all ought
[1:28:25] to talk to me,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT ONCE THAT MAN TURNED THEM
[1:28:30] LIGHTS OFF,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT, she realized I could no longer
[1:28:35] Oh, y'all ought to talk to me.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; I I COULD I COULD NO LONGER FORGE
[1:28:40] FORWARD,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? [screaming] BECAUSE THERE THERE'S
[1:28:44] BEEN A DISCONNECT
[1:28:46] SOMEWHERE. BECAUSE TO TURN ON LIGHTS, I
[1:28:48] AIN'T NO REAL ELECTRICIAN, but there's
[1:28:50] got to be a connection when you flip
[1:28:52] that switch to turn them on or turn them
[1:28:54] off,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; bro. Troy know what I'm talking about,
[1:28:56] right? Troy, electrician. Somewhere when
[1:28:59] you hit, there's a connection that turns
[1:29:01] these off. And when you pull that thing
[1:29:02] down, there's a disconnect to turn them
[1:29:04] off.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Right. It shows that boy, ain't no power
[1:29:08] running through there somewhere.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Right. And she realized, boy,
[1:29:14] I can't move forward. Amen. Down here
[1:29:17] cuz it's dark.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And and what brought the darkness was
[1:29:22] the disconnect.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; THE DISCONNECT [screaming]
[1:29:29] in this switch.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; But thank God, you know, she had A
[1:29:33] BROTHER WHO WATCHED SAY, "UH, don't fear
[1:29:36] little sister. There's a man that can
[1:29:38] turn on the light."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[1:29:43] I I I'M determined to walk in the light
[1:29:48] because he IS LIGHT
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; IN HIM. AIN'T NO DARKNESS,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; AIN'T NO AIN'T NO HIGH BREATHING IN
[1:29:58] HERE. You know, it ain't that.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S IT'S ALL [screaming] LIGHT AND
[1:30:02] LIFE
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; IN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. IT'S IT'S ALL LIFE.
[1:30:12] SEE, this this this connection,
[1:30:16] right? Uh uh UH IT'S ALL LIFE AND LIGHT.
[1:30:23] Glory to God. Glory to God. It's it's no
[1:30:28] it's no it's no darkness, right?
[1:30:33] A lot of times people just refuse light
[1:30:35] to walk in darkness.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:38] And and to me that don't make sense if
[1:30:40] if we're Christians,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; right? You know,
[1:30:47] when when we didn't know no better,
[1:30:50] it was it was it was kind of easier
[1:30:54] because you just didn't have the
[1:30:55] knowledge,
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, BUT NOW THAT NOW THAT YOU
[1:31:02] KNOW,
[1:31:04] now that you know, IT MAKES IT
[1:31:06] DIFFICULT.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT IT'LL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME
[1:31:13] TO, you know, WALK IN SOME OF THESE
[1:31:16] AREAS BECAUSE THE SWITCH HAS BEEN turned
[1:31:20] on
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; AND I'M MOVING AROUND AND I'M MOVING
[1:31:23] AROUND in light.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:31:28] And like say don't go there.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Light say don't go here.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Light say you can't fellowship there.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:38] Because because THE THE INFLUENCE
[1:31:41] INFLUENCE IS A REAL THING,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:31:47] and the people that you you come in
[1:31:49] contact with. You know, I've just never
[1:31:52] even before I had this understanding, I
[1:31:55] just never been the type of person that,
[1:31:58] you know,
[1:32:00] I walked in a group amongst a group of
[1:32:02] people and I just felt like,
[1:32:06] you know,
[1:32:07] everybody loves me and this and that.
[1:32:11] And it's like, man, I got my gods up.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I always have my gods up. I do not put
[1:32:20] them down.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I put my guards down one time. I'll
[1:32:25] never do it again. Brother Troy know
[1:32:27] what I'm talking about.
[1:32:29] Where in church now, when I was a young
[1:32:32] convert, I was a little gullible
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; because I felt like certain things
[1:32:38] didn't happen around the message.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Just the message. Just Yeah. But the
[1:32:45] devil is still a devil. He's still going
[1:32:49] to and fro seeking to whom he made THE
[1:32:52] VOW
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; MALE, FEMALE, FAMILY, AND EVERYTHING
[1:32:57] ELSE.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. [snorts]
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so from that time, you
[1:33:04] know, I turned right back on that
[1:33:06] switch. And from then on, it's like,
[1:33:08] man, if it walk like a duck, it quiet
[1:33:10] like a duck is a duck.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; I ain't playing with it.
[1:33:16] If I see what I see, I see what I see.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; AND I MAY NOT BOTHER THE PERSON, YOU
[1:33:22] KNOW, ABOUT WHAT I see. But I'm just,
[1:33:24] you know, I ain't I ain't going to close
[1:33:26] the blind like brother Brandham says.
[1:33:28] You know, people go in the basement AND
[1:33:31] REJECT TRUE CONNECTION.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THEY'LL GO DOWN AND AND REFUSE
[1:33:39] THE WORD.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Glory to God. Glory to God. This
[1:33:46] is THE ONLY THING THAT SATISFY.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; SEE THIS IS THIS IS WHY I WILL NEVER
[1:33:53] BECOME A PART of any of these
[1:33:57] sorority [screaming] type of things.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; WHY? BE BECAUSE ON THE FOUNDATION WHAT
[1:34:07] IS IT? RIGHT.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; AND AND IT MIGHT IT [screaming] MIGHT
[1:34:13] SEEM LIKE, YOU KNOW, IN SOME OF THESE
[1:34:16] INST AND YOU SEE THIS A LOT OF TIMES IN,
[1:34:18] you know, more of Methodists and
[1:34:20] Baptists and AM and, you know, uh
[1:34:28] where where you know they they got the
[1:34:30] Masons and and the you know the the
[1:34:34] Eastern Stars. Y'all have helped me
[1:34:36] preach and all of this kind of stuff.
[1:34:38] There's no way that I could get
[1:34:40] involved. You know, in in in um college,
[1:34:44] they they have all of this stuff, these
[1:34:46] sororities and all of that.
[1:34:51] At the core, those things are demon
[1:34:53] inspired.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You see, give me a scripture. Jesus to
[1:35:00] the Satan told Jesus, "If you bow down
[1:35:03] and worship me, man, I'll give you all
[1:35:05] of this."
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz everything, RIGHT, EVEN THE
[1:35:09] DAUGHTERS, EVERYTHING IS INSPIRED BY THE
[1:35:12] DEVIL.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUTSIDE OF AMEN. THE WORD.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Satan controls,
[1:35:20] RIGHT? THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO PROTECT OUR
[1:35:22] MINDS,
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; PROTECT OUR THOUGHTS,
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE PROPHET
[1:35:30] TAUGHT US, YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT
[1:35:32] APPROACH TO THINGS.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YOU, you can't approach things
[1:35:36] just kind of halfhazardly,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; right? Because like we say, you know, uh
[1:35:43] uh in our our connections
[1:35:48] like the Queen of Sheba,
[1:35:50] right? You know, she she had to have a
[1:35:54] settling in her spirit. This is the
[1:35:57] right place.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I'll make a broader
[1:36:03] statement. WHEN I FIRST GOT uh converted
[1:36:05] to uh the message, right, we was in
[1:36:09] another group amongst another group of
[1:36:11] people, right? And it was just something
[1:36:15] that was not settling in my spirit.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT THE WORD THERE WAS SOMETHING
[1:36:22] THAT I FELT LIKE AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE
[1:36:24] UNDERSTANDING, BUT I IN MY HEART I KNEW
[1:36:27] THAT THE WORD WAS RIGHT.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:36:31] BUT EVERYTHING ELSE I COULDN'T PUT
[1:36:33] TOGETHER,
[1:36:35] RIGHT? AND AND THE FOLKS THAT WAS AROUND
[1:36:38] ME JUMPING AND SHOUTING AND SCREAMING,
[1:36:41] THEY COULDN'T HELP ME CUZ THEY COULDN'T
[1:36:43] ANSWER THE QUESTIONS NEITHER.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't preach.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Huh? Sh, brother.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Really, man? I I need something, you
[1:36:56] know, and and and see from my
[1:36:58] PERSPECTIVE AND WHERE I CAME FROM, I
[1:37:02] didn't want to go back.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Right. SO SO THERE WAS A HUNGER.
[1:37:08] THERE WAS A hunger for for true
[1:37:12] connection.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:17] And eventually, you know, I I changed
[1:37:21] churches,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; right? because I was more I was more
[1:37:26] satisfied
[1:37:27] at the time. But even in that,
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; we were still being hoodwanked.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; BE BECAUSE YOU don't think brother Jack
[1:37:41] was using it. You got to know them that
[1:37:43] labor amongst you.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; See, CUZ YOU COULD COME IN AND TAKE ON A
[1:37:49] SPIRIT.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YOU CAN TAKE ON A MAN'S
[1:37:52] SPIRIT,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; we done that,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; We took on a We were We were vulnerable.
[1:38:01] WE WERE GULLIBLE.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; WE were susceptible
[1:38:06] to anything
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and the man were playing games with us
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; all in the name of reading quotes and
[1:38:14] all of that. SEE, LIKE IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:38:18] THE, YOU KNOW, LIKE THE BROTHER BEEN
[1:38:19] PREACHING, THE RIGHT CHARACTERISTICS,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?

[1:38:39] EVEN KNOW ME LIKE THAT. THAT'S NOT MY
[1:38:42] INTENT,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:38:46] Brother Bam say sometimes YOU JUST GOT
[1:38:48] TO TAKE OFF THE GLOVES.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHEN I'M PREACHING, I AIN'T GOT NO
[1:38:53] gloves on.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Right. I ain't trying to spare family,
[1:38:58] friends, CO-WORKERS, AND NOBODY ELSE.
[1:39:01] I'M JUST PREACHING THE UNCARCHABLE
[1:39:03] RICHES of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST TRYING TO TRYING TO PREACH
[1:39:07] SOMETHING that transform the way that we
[1:39:11] move in life.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. You might say, "Well,
[1:39:16] these guys do not know how to move in
[1:39:18] life."

[1:39:37] through life.

[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I I SAW LIFE THROUGH blinders
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; at 15. At I'll take it a little further.
[1:39:47] At 25, I didn't I didn't know how to
[1:39:50] navigate.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:54] I'll take it further. In my 30s and 40s,
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; right? I'm right now learning to
[1:40:04] ask questions.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Right. TO MAKE SURE I'M I'M SATISFIED.

[1:56:29] And you and you got to be big enough to
[1:56:32] ask the questions.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The last few
[1:56:36] years, man,
[1:56:38] it's been a a
[1:56:42] who? Brother Solomon, make your way up
[1:56:44] here to stop me. Come on, walk on up
[1:56:46] here.
[1:56:48] But I'm telling you, I've been I've I've
[1:56:50] I've I've been, you know, uh making a
[1:56:53] deep dive into
[1:56:57] my ideology,
[1:56:59] right? And some of the principles that I
[1:57:01] held to that I realized, boy, I wish I'd
[1:57:06] had a different thought.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. behind, you know, a different
[1:57:10] thought.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Because my way of thinking really wasn't
[1:57:16] the right way of thinking,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz all the time I ain't gonna
[1:57:20] argue,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I get upset, I just shut down.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; But that's not I mean, you don't argue.
[1:57:29] Sometimes you might have to quill the
[1:57:32] the the conversation if you get heated,
[1:57:35] but you got to bring the conversation
[1:57:37] back up
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; because you got to get down to the core.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; But see, I didn't I didn't I didn't
[1:57:43] think like that then.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS A PASTOR, I didn't think because
[1:57:48] I had a certain ideology, certain things
[1:57:50] that I got from men in my family,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:55] NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY GOT THAT FROM.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; But that what was told in me and that's
[1:58:01] what I held on to. And I I I should have
[1:58:05] been I'm not argumenting him. I'm not
[1:58:08] arguing with nobody.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Right. But I'm always willing to have a
[1:58:14] conversation,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:19] with with folks around things or
[1:58:21] disagreements or something like that. If
[1:58:23] we gonna be big and adults be about it,
[1:58:27] let's have a conversation.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; And then in our conversation,
[1:58:32] let's make sure it's biblically based.

[1:58:42] prayer.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:58:49] Most gracious Father, we just thank you
[1:58:51] and we praise you, oh God, this morning.
[1:58:54] Lord, you know, I I've been days, Lord,
[1:58:58] just kind of toiling and and uh just
[1:59:03] want to to say the right things.
[1:59:06] you know, I I I could look back on my
[1:59:10] life and, you know, as a kid and as an
[1:59:13] adult, I I just didn't even really
[1:59:16] realistically know how to
[1:59:19] think. I didn't really know how to
[1:59:23] approach connections.
[1:59:26] But but you know in this season I
[1:59:29] realize in anything that I'm involved in
[1:59:32] it's got to be 100%
[1:59:35] Bible. It's got to be biblically based.
[1:59:39] It it it cannot be, [music] you know,
[1:59:43] just something and, you know, some club
[1:59:47] and and
[1:59:49] different things going on around and,
[1:59:53] you know, alcohol and secularisms and
[1:59:57] cuz I'm a Christian and and I can't walk
[2:00:00] with that,
[2:00:02] you know. I I I can't even begin to
[2:00:06] reason that.
[2:00:09] But Lord, I I I've come to this
[2:00:11] conclusion based upon scripture, the
[2:00:14] word, and what I see in the word.
[2:00:18] I just want to be uh a partaker of the
[2:00:21] word. I want my fellowship to be
[2:00:25] wordbased.
[2:00:28] Lord, I thank you this morning. We just
[2:00:30] want to pray for the saints. pray their
[2:00:32] uh traveling mercies, Lord, as you know,
[2:00:36] they wind up their services and prepare
[2:00:39] to make their way back homes, [music]
[2:00:42] Lord. Uh we pray that they have safe
[2:00:45] travels, but I I apprec I appreciate you
[2:00:48] this morning. And I and I just pray
[2:00:50] that, you know, the things that were
[2:00:53] said, Lord, that we could we could grasp
[2:00:58] and we could really
[2:01:01] mold our way of thinking as it relates
[2:01:04] to all of our connections [music] and
[2:01:07] the people that we come in contact with.
[2:01:10] Lord, we just want to know where we
[2:01:13] stand and we want to look at this person
[2:01:15] and make sure that this is the type of
[2:01:19] person that [music] I want around me and
[2:01:21] in my life. Lord, I be careful to give
[2:01:24] you the praise, the glory, and honor in
[2:01:25] Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:34] My Lord, what a message. [music]
[2:01:38] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Clap
[2:01:41] and praise for brother Willie.
[2:01:46] Amen. I was thinking as he was
[2:01:48] preaching,
[2:01:50] you know, God, he only wants us to
[2:01:52] recognize who we are.
[2:01:55] And Satan is entirely the opposite.
[2:01:59] He don't want [music] you to know who
[2:02:00] you are.
[2:02:02] When he came to Eve in the beginning,
[2:02:06] he said, "You'll be like God."
[2:02:10] And she already [music] knew that she
[2:02:12] was already like God. But he wants to
[2:02:15] get you out of a place. You are a son
[2:02:17] and daughter of God. You [music] must
[2:02:19] know who you are.
[2:02:22] He came to Jesus if thou be [music]
[2:02:25] always. He want to make you question who
[2:02:27] you are. But God said, "You are my sons
[2:02:30] and daughters. You are Christians.
[2:02:33] Wherever you go, you are a Christian.
[2:02:36] Don't let Satan get [music] you off
[2:02:37] that. Stand on that word. Every
[2:02:39] relationship is the word." Amen. I'm so
[2:02:43] grateful Brother Willie said what he
[2:02:44] said. God only made one brother Willie.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the best brother Willie I
[2:02:50] ever seen.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this little song
[2:02:53] together [music] and trust as we sing
[2:02:56] this, you'll realize the connection that
[2:02:58] we have is something precious in the
[2:03:00] sight of God.
[2:03:03] Every need be supplied. [music]
[2:03:08] You are important to me. I need you to

[2:05:43] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[2:05:48] [music]
[2:05:49] Precious Lord.
[2:05:52] Father, we're so grateful, Lord God,
[2:05:53] that you allowed your servant to clear
[2:05:56] [music] his heart and clear his mind,
[2:05:58] Lord, by ministering the word that you
[2:06:00] placed on his heart. Father, it's a word
[2:06:03] that we all need, [music]
[2:06:05] Father. Whether it's in relationship or
[2:06:07] if it's in business, Lord, or whatever
[2:06:09] it may be, we need to make the right
[2:06:11] connections. [music]
[2:06:13] Father, we can all agree that we made
[2:06:15] the right connections, Lord, being a
[2:06:17] part, Lord, [music] of this brother and
[2:06:18] sisterhood that we have here at Spirit
[2:06:20] and Truth Tabernacle. Lord, Father, we
[2:06:23] come from so many different [music]
[2:06:25] places, being led of the spirit, Lord,
[2:06:27] that we may sojourn together. And
[2:06:30] father, I pray for my brothers and my
[2:06:32] sisters, Lord, [music] that you would be
[2:06:33] with each one, that you'll continue to
[2:06:36] direct their minds and their hearts,
[2:06:37] Lord, as we continue to try and
[2:06:40] navigate, Lord, while we're souljouring
[2:06:42] here in this earth, Lord. Father, this
[2:06:45] is the greatest hour, Lord. It's the
[2:06:46] hour that [music] your coming is in,
[2:06:48] Lord. And I'm so grateful, Lord, to be
[2:06:51] standing with brothers and sisters of
[2:06:52] like, precious faith that believe and
[2:06:55] trust you. So, Father, we just ask
[2:06:57] almighty God that you'll grant to us
[2:07:00] more revelation, Lord, more wisdom and
[2:07:02] understanding. [music]
[2:07:04] Enlarge our minds and our hearts that we
[2:07:06] can know you more perfectly, Lord God,
[2:07:08] to believe you for the impossible.
[2:07:10] [music]
[2:07:11] Father, like brother Willie said, we
[2:07:13] want our minds transformed, Lord Jesus.
[2:07:16] [music]
[2:07:16] If we knew back then what we knew now,
[2:07:19] Lord God, how much further down the road
[2:07:21] we would be. Father, we want to help
[2:07:24] this next generation, Lord, [music] to
[2:07:26] go to higher heights and deeper depths
[2:07:28] in you, Lord. Father, to be able to
[2:07:33] [music] live in the upper springs and
[2:07:34] the Nether Springs, have them both, Lord
[2:07:36] Jesus, while in this life. So, Father,
[2:07:39] [music] we pray your blessings upon your
[2:07:41] people. We pray for Brother Willie,
[2:07:43] Lord, all that he put out, Lord. God,
[2:07:45] may you strengthen our brother, restore,
[2:07:47] Lord, his strength, Lord. And Father,
[2:07:49] just bless [music] him in every aspect
[2:07:51] of his life, Lord. May you grant him his
[2:07:54] heart, his eye, and meet every need,
[2:07:55] Lord, along with this [music]
[2:07:56] congregation, Father. There are many of
[2:07:59] us that could not make it, Lord, for
[2:08:01] whatever reason, Lord, [music] we pray.
[2:08:03] Be with our brothers and sisters where
[2:08:05] they are, Lord. No doubt their hearts
[2:08:07] are [music] with us, Lord, and they
[2:08:08] enjoyed the service as well. Father, be
[2:08:11] with us all as we go to our respective
[2:08:13] homes. bring us all back at the
[2:08:14] appointed time. Bless our [music]
[2:08:16] brothers and sisters in Australia as
[2:08:18] they travel back again, Lord. Keep them
[2:08:20] safe and out of harm's way, oh Father,
[2:08:23] and bless them, Lord, for every effort
[2:08:24] that they put into the service. Bless
[2:08:26] our brothers and sisters with brother
[2:08:28] Lee and Gian Tabernacle that hosted
[2:08:31] them, Lord. Everything that they put
[2:08:33] out, Lord God, may you restore. We love
[2:08:36] you, Father. Thank you for being God. We
[2:08:39] commit all things to you now in Jesus
[2:08:41] Christ's precious and holy name. Amen.
[2:08:44] Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[2:08:46] seats and our brothers will come [music]
[2:08:47] dismiss you at this time. God bless you.
