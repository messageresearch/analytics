[59:14] really bad for him we prayed and prayed
[59:16] for him and we sang songs to him and the
[59:19] Holy Ghost took over they began to sing
[59:21] and smile and now he was singing back to

[59:55] we were I was so sick and I got mean
[59:59] after preaching and running and
[1:00:00] traveling I was sick with sneezing and
[1:00:03] my head was how was it realistic
[1:00:05] whenever a brother invited me I was
[1:00:07] supposed to attend his wedding I
[1:00:08] couldn't go because I was renew my
[1:00:10] passport so he asked me to come and see
[1:00:12] a lot of daughter she's around a yen
[1:00:14] half so we went and the wife give me
[1:00:16] some vitamins too she made some
[1:00:17] solutions for me to drink and we're
[1:00:19] there when the pastor's wife caught that
[1:00:21] hey there's a lady here who needs you
[1:00:23] the daughter has a cancer of the stomach
[1:00:25] she's been through two surgeries so they
[1:00:28] wanted to come and go pray for him and I
[1:00:30] was run out with energy that night she
[1:00:32] was gone so we went and the pastor did
[1:00:34] all the praying and preaching for like
[1:00:37] two hours
[1:00:37] give her the word of the Lord she told
[1:00:39] ed the type of cancers and what cancers
[1:00:42] are is like a suspect of a crab is a
[1:00:44] demon actually that took ahold of your
[1:00:46] normal body sauce and distorted and
[1:00:49] twisted and destroy your life to the sub

[1:00:53] cancer's one is the B'nai cancer which
[1:00:56] sometimes the doctors can help with
[1:00:58] medication and chemotherapy
[1:00:59] but when it becomes malignant sometimes
[1:01:01] there's no hope the only hope is Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ so he pretty went to her that
[1:01:05] even if you die receive Jesus Christ if
[1:01:07] it's your time to go you have to receive
[1:01:10] Christ before you go so the lady receive
[1:01:13] the Lord and she wanted to be baptized
[1:01:14] but because of the chemo she saw we
[1:01:16] needed a couple of months to recover
[1:01:18] from the effect of the chemo she's been
[1:01:20] through to therapist but she was very
[1:01:23] has it sincere had she said I'm thankful
[1:01:25] to develop because people have a lot of
[1:01:27] planes when they have cancer but thank

[1:05:00] was praying and looking at the what is
[1:05:02] the title Lord what do you want us to go
[1:05:04] and I found this I got a title this
[1:05:07] morning at the office our caption it the
[1:05:11] nature of a perfect man instead of the
[1:05:13] statue of a preferred man or the Rema of
[1:05:16] the logos hospitable Rema Rema is our
[1:05:19] each and
[1:05:21] logos ello gos Daruma
[1:05:25] of the logos or the nature of the or of
[1:05:31] a perfect man a man who is a perfect man
[1:05:34] on earth in the human sense who is a
[1:05:37] preferred man beside Jesus Christ
[1:05:39] there's nobody in from Adam right
[1:05:43] through all of them there's nobody the
[1:05:44] only perfect man is Jesus Christ say oh
[1:05:47] brother but Enoch was perfect the Bible
[1:05:49] said that he was perfect before God
[1:05:51] now when John John was in the vision on
[1:05:54] the island of Patmos when the Lord move
[1:05:57] into the system Asian and mankind needed
[1:06:00] Redemption there was a cry who is worthy
[1:06:03] to take the book of life and give life
[1:06:06] unto mankind
[1:06:07] to pay the debt to pay for sins anak was
[1:06:10] there by he was silence amen
[1:06:12] Elijah was there he was silent Joseph
[1:06:15] was that he was silent everyone has a
[1:06:18] scratch on him or her but there was only
[1:06:20] one person and it's only one person the
[1:06:23] Lord Jesus Christ himself who had no
[1:06:25] scratch on him amen
[1:06:27] he walked through the blood system like
[1:06:29] you and I walked through but there was
[1:06:31] not a single scratch called sin or
[1:06:33] mistake in his life he was the only one
[1:06:36] who was worthy to use his blood his life
[1:06:39] in exchange for arson he became a sin
[1:06:42] that we will become his righteousness
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:45] and so that divine nature the locust is
[1:06:48] Christ Himself is the silesia beam and
[1:06:51] the Rhema is the expression or
[1:06:54] manifestation of the celestial being
[1:06:56] amen the locust is not an ID is not a
[1:06:59] scoop is not something it's not like a
[1:07:02] wind is not something that hasn't got an
[1:07:04] itch it's just a person of Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] and the Rhema when we begin to manifest
[1:07:09] himself then become the Rhema amen
[1:07:12] in the book of Genesis if you look at
[1:07:14] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 God created
[1:07:17] the world created all the things in the
[1:07:20] world but if you go to Genesis chapter 2
[1:07:22] the Bible said that there was no one to
[1:07:24] the land Numa God has created a man he
[1:07:27] has really created a solution which is
[1:07:29] too funny
[1:07:30] eternally
[1:07:31] but then he hasn't murdered assistant
[1:07:32] element to put the man in it amen so got
[1:07:36] to the earth and created modded it in
[1:07:39] the form of a man Adam Adam means red
[1:07:41] earth a man with blood position in his
[1:07:43] body so God wanted to become flesh as
[1:07:46] well he wanted to express their the
[1:07:49] Teresa attribute the human attributes
[1:07:51] but he couldn't do it on so he created
[1:07:54] created Adam the freshmen amen
[1:07:58] so when created Adam then begin to
[1:08:00] manifest himself now if you go to
[1:08:02] Genesis you have got a turn at time when
[1:08:05] God begin to manifest eternal attributes
[1:08:07] of redemption he became God because Adam
[1:08:11] was God
[1:08:11] the Bible said that he was God over
[1:08:12] creation is all right so Adams put
[1:08:15] things into creation because God wanted
[1:08:17] his son Adam to be like him he was part
[1:08:19] of him if you have a child you don't
[1:08:21] want your child to to be a baby the rest
[1:08:23] of his life or the rest of her life you
[1:08:25] don't want to pack your child one is 38
[1:08:28] years old when it's 40 years old you
[1:08:30] kind of impact him I mean there's no way
[1:08:32] you know so you want you have to teach
[1:08:34] him how to walk how to eat how to speak
[1:08:36] that hey you a human being you are not
[1:08:38] going to be a baby you are not going to
[1:08:40] be in that mess all your life
[1:08:41] same thing spiritually when we are born
[1:08:43] we are spiritual babies we are in
[1:08:44] diapers we don't know who we were but
[1:08:47] then the low began to teach us how to
[1:08:48] eat drink milk how to drink water how to
[1:08:52] change ourself how to do this because
[1:08:54] this attribute was already in us when a
[1:08:57] child is born as a baby he's already a
[1:09:00] human being she's already a human being
[1:09:01] he only began to lend attributes more
[1:09:04] than a true that is already in him to
[1:09:06] express this in a much better way in a
[1:09:09] much excellent way amen because as a
[1:09:12] baby he doesn't know how to say I'm
[1:09:14] hungry
[1:09:14] so when is hungry what does that she or
[1:09:17] he do he cries that's what he does
[1:09:19] because it doesn't know no language that
[1:09:21] it can speak English she can speak
[1:09:23] French but then wait time when you begin
[1:09:25] to learn language begin to evil and baby
[1:09:29] language we have got a language sometime
[1:09:32] alidium the mothers can understand the
[1:09:34] mother can know or the older sisters and
[1:09:36] brothers can understand a baby language
[1:09:38] they Pickett
[1:09:39] with time as their teeth and as they
[1:09:41] develop their senses now they can speak
[1:09:43] an adult language they can tell you I
[1:09:45] need food they can tell you I need to
[1:09:47] use a restroom I need to drink water I'm
[1:09:50] sick mommy I have a headache
[1:09:51] so the same thing the Lord put put us on
[1:09:54] a grid stitch that we grew from infancy
[1:09:56] on to maturity but we are not going to
[1:09:58] be babies the rest of our lives
[1:09:59] amen praise God in Genesis 1 we have the
[1:10:02] following turn at time of manifestation
[1:10:06] then we have the following time Genesis
[1:10:08] 1 is when God begin to manifest the
[1:10:09] eternal attributes Genesis 3 is when the
[1:10:12] contrast came in the fall came in and
[1:10:15] sin was a shed upon the earth in human
[1:10:18] risk if you take the years of Adam and
[1:10:21] Seth and Methuselah and Enoch and Noah
[1:10:26] and the rest of the most of them live up
[1:10:28] to 900 plus years Methuselah was having
[1:10:32] 969 Adam was 930 somewhere night 12
[1:10:35] nights and now where's that age what
[1:10:38] happened because the ethics were corrupt
[1:10:41] that we can't get the age but then the
[1:10:45] Lord has compensated us with the
[1:10:47] revelation of Jesus Christ amen so in
[1:10:50] Earth in the natural we don't grow to
[1:10:52] 200 300 maybe at most 110 120 115 130
[1:10:57] some few people get to that age but then
[1:10:59] God has given you the revelation the
[1:11:01] eternal aspect of you amen so just as
[1:11:07] the Lord had attributes in him when we
[1:11:13] begin to manifest himself on earth
[1:11:14] attribute to be God to be a savior he
[1:11:18] put the same divine attribute in his
[1:11:20] sons and daughters to manifest those
[1:11:22] attributes we read from the scripture
[1:11:23] Peter was asserting the church to add
[1:11:25] certain virtues on to them how do we add
[1:11:28] average the Bible so that a man cannot
[1:11:30] even add add an inch on to his height so
[1:11:33] how am I going to add feet when I can
[1:11:36] even add an inch on to my height how do
[1:11:38] I do that why manufacture that know that
[1:11:41] attribute is already in you before the
[1:11:43] foundation of the world as it 10
[1:11:45] attributes and as you pick the first an
[1:11:47] is what you have
[1:11:48] the Bible said Jesus began to preach he
[1:11:50] must be born again
[1:11:52] the old man has to die and cried Jesus
[1:11:55] has to take preeminence in your life and
[1:11:57] then cry cry Jesus is that attributes
[1:12:00] when into prominence in your life just
[1:12:02] like a human being is just automatic for
[1:12:04] you to talk as part of you is part of a
[1:12:07] human being to walk to sleep to dance to
[1:12:10] eat to drink to do things to yawn to do
[1:12:14] things that human beings do so you don't
[1:12:16] even think about it they come as to when
[1:12:18] is needed
[1:12:18] amen now a person can have those sundews
[1:12:21] attribute without even having the Holy
[1:12:23] Ghost baptism God the Bible said that
[1:12:25] God gave gifts unto men
[1:12:27] even without repentance they are people
[1:12:29] that are not even Christians they are
[1:12:31] very patient they have some faith they
[1:12:35] have some godliness in them they have
[1:12:37] some kindness about them they have some
[1:12:40] atmosphere about them they don't have
[1:12:41] they're not even Christians I'm not
[1:12:42] talking about people while
[1:12:44] denominational were Christian this
[1:12:45] require not Muslims people who don't
[1:12:47] have even any religion but God divine
[1:12:50] atropine a gift he put those gifting
[1:12:53] them but it doesn't mean the Ivanpah
[1:12:55] again those get manifest now there are
[1:12:58] others that they need to have those
[1:12:59] gifts the godot's gift when they are
[1:13:02] born again there are people who don't
[1:13:04] have they don't have an iota of patient
[1:13:06] this snob
[1:13:07] the judge patient is out of their life
[1:13:10] but then when they are born again this
[1:13:12] person is different so what happened to
[1:13:13] you it is not him but it's what Christ
[1:13:17] in him
[1:13:17] it is the Christ that is living in this
[1:13:20] woman that is giving him that patient
[1:13:22] that is bringing that brotherly laugh
[1:13:24] that is bringing the godliness that is
[1:13:27] bringing faith in him amen the Bible
[1:13:30] said I would have faith
[1:13:31] no man can even please God so how do you
[1:13:35] get faith the Holy Ghost has to give you
[1:13:38] the faith how do you get temperance the
[1:13:42] Holy Ghost has to give you the
[1:13:43] temperance how do you get brotherly
[1:13:45] kindness the Holy Ghost has to do that
[1:13:47] how do you get profit laugh so when
[1:13:50] someone offends you when someone
[1:13:52] persecute you you love him so much that
[1:13:54] you don't want the law to punish him
[1:13:56] you want a lot to forgive him and you
[1:13:59] forgive him or her and pray that a lot
[1:14:01] should bring him or her out of that
[1:14:03] situation when the person has treated
[1:14:05] you with evil when I mean Evo Evo
[1:14:08] probably all of us I've gone through one
[1:14:11] or the other that's somebody that even
[1:14:13] you love it that sometime doesn't take a
[1:14:14] non-believer maybe sometimes a lot to
[1:14:17] make it's always somebody who is close
[1:14:18] to you we supposed to be me a believer
[1:14:20] you can offend you and if you don't have
[1:14:24] that divine laugh of forgiveness so I
[1:14:27] know I'm never going to forgive this
[1:14:28] person the rest of my life even my
[1:14:31] family will forgive them because the
[1:14:32] deed is against our family they wouldn't
[1:14:35] train our children their generation that
[1:14:37] oh this family did this against us don't
[1:14:40] even talk to them if they have to save
[1:14:42] your life choose to die that's how bad
[1:14:45] it is they don't have nothing to do with
[1:14:47] this family family and family we are
[1:14:50] like the North Pole and the South Pole
[1:14:52] they don't meet together because of
[1:14:54] something that our kid in Lapland in the
[1:14:56] life situation but then when the Holy
[1:14:59] Ghost comes in the Holy Ghost change you
[1:15:02] that you are not that old person no more
[1:15:04] that word person who cannot forgive his
[1:15:07] dead he's an illiterate he does even
[1:15:10] exist no more now Christ who is the
[1:15:13] locust who is the great antenna who is
[1:15:16] the ll Elohim who can forgive the
[1:15:19] unforgivable who can forgive the one who
[1:15:21] doesn't deserve is in you so you just
[1:15:24] allow it you let go and let God let the
[1:15:27] Lord take preeminence and you bring that
[1:15:29] forgiveness that laugh that kindness out
[1:15:32] of you because it's an odd root that is
[1:15:35] in you Amen let's do a little bit of a
[1:15:37] reading resource create quotations here
[1:15:40] just to batter at this point and we move
[1:15:42] forward praise be to God let's go to the
[1:15:46] message and expectation 1950 expectation
[1:15:52] 5 0 0 8 1 0 paragraph 36 to 37 praise be
[1:15:59] to God
[1:16:06] yes
[1:16:13] expectation bar graph that Isis okay let
[1:16:16] me give me one second
[1:16:18] god is good praise be to God yes is that
[1:16:28] and when you receive the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:16:30] not sure if I'm reading the right
[1:16:30] paragraph but then is that when you
[1:16:33] receive the Holy Ghost everything that
[1:16:34] you have need of for Earth journey is in
[1:16:38] you then when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:16:42] or the Holy Spirit or Jesus Christ the
[1:16:45] person of Jesus Christ in your heart not
[1:16:48] when you confess him you can confess him
[1:16:49] with your with your lips but if it's not
[1:16:51] on the inside he's talking about when
[1:16:54] you receive when he comes on the inside

[1:17:07] loose and believe God 37 now she's
[1:17:11] talking about Simon Simeon had a promise
[1:17:12] of the Holy Ghost that he wasn't going
[1:17:14] to die until he's seen the lost Christ
[1:17:17] and it wasn't afraid to testify of it
[1:17:20] either some of them said show him to me
[1:17:23] amen this was an elderly man probably
[1:17:26] who who couldn't tell when he was going
[1:17:29] to die but was promised him that he
[1:17:31] wouldn't die until he see the Christ the
[1:17:34] Messiah and he believed it and told
[1:17:36] people he wasn't leading chabad his old
[1:17:38] age

[1:22:02] will bring forth what is purposeful
[1:22:04] purposeful I see many of you down here
[1:22:06] is
[1:22:07] cuttin apples peaches fruits when the
[1:22:10] little apple tree is no bigger than the
[1:22:12] right than the right every Apple Dow
[1:22:15] ever be in that tree is in it they write
[1:22:18] in dozens of bushels of apples isn't a
[1:22:21] little tree right then why you see but
[1:22:24] Abraham no well wait it came from if
[1:22:27] they are not they the only tree right
[1:22:30] then
[1:22:30] amen is trying to print a picture here
[1:22:33] that if you take an apple seed or take a
[1:22:36] corn seed tomato mango whatever pray
[1:22:39] have occurred whatever you planted I've
[1:22:42] done some planting before so I know a
[1:22:44] little bit about planting so you planted
[1:22:46] tree here or you plant a seed here you
[1:22:48] pour water on it I also good today from
[1:22:50] with my grandmother so I remember those
[1:22:52] this when I was a good ranch so now you
[1:22:54] plant it then you prayed a lot to send a
[1:22:57] rain upon the seat and the sunshine will
[1:22:59] come upon it now listen about I don't
[1:23:02] know how Mays can take about three days
[1:23:04] to germinate it was proud it will come
[1:23:07] out maybe up will take more than that
[1:23:08] some can take like a year but then it's
[1:23:11] going to come out it has to it need a
[1:23:13] Sun it drinks it takes the water it is a
[1:23:15] sunshine it is a moisture then we get to
[1:23:18] come out when it comes out what are the
[1:23:21] fruits all this fruit that is going to
[1:23:22] bear where does it come from the fruits
[1:23:25] they seed the flowers the leaves the
[1:23:28] stem they are in that little seed it's
[1:23:31] like a mystery isn't that salacious is
[1:23:34] the other dimension the system mentioned
[1:23:36] control everything on this planet so is
[1:23:39] there in another dimension and as the
[1:23:41] tree begin to suck the water now a begin
[1:23:44] to manifest the first lives may be true
[1:23:46] leaves the Conn leaves the knot of the
[1:23:49] leaves begin to grow stem flowers now
[1:23:52] you've got mango trees all over around
[1:23:54] like pressures is the best give it
[1:23:56] supplies with mango she's got a mango
[1:23:58] tree be probably a bunch of them in his
[1:24:00] house and he bring it to us
[1:24:01] he plus she planted probably only one
[1:24:03] mango tree or there was only one tree
[1:24:05] that was one seed but out of that mango
[1:24:08] tree or see that was planted most of us
[1:24:11] are eating mango fruits from that tree
[1:24:14] this seemed let's see how it applies in
[1:24:17] this in in our lives in the spiritual
[1:24:19] life is that a thing I go to not the
[1:24:22] only thing there is is talk about the
[1:24:24] tree now the only thing that the little
[1:24:26] tree you stick in the ground okay I
[1:24:28] think I did that
[1:24:29] mmm okay that's draw the moisture from
[1:24:33] the ground it has to draw more than what
[1:24:35] is lotted portion what is it's not a
[1:24:37] portion you have to give it plenty of
[1:24:40] water and when you give it water it just
[1:24:42] drinks and drinks and drinks so it can't
[1:24:45] hardly drink no more
[1:24:47] and it just start pushing out and it
[1:24:49] pushes out limbs pushed out flowers
[1:24:51] push it out blossoms push that oppose
[1:24:54] the Apple was on the inside of it at the
[1:24:57] beginning it just has to drink every man
[1:25:00] that is born again in Christ Jesus
[1:25:02] everything that you have need of your
[1:25:04] healing sit down or flee to your hero
[1:25:07] but everything that you have need off of
[1:25:09] of the whole life journey is in you
[1:25:13] right then and when we are planted in
[1:25:15] Christ you see what I mean when you are
[1:25:17] born again and the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:19] Ghost has come into your heart you have
[1:25:21] everything that you have need off for
[1:25:23] the journey now the only thing you have
[1:25:25] to do is to start drinking drinking and
[1:25:28] pushing out drinking and pushing out I
[1:25:29] believe he hears I believe he hears my
[1:25:32] analysis of Jesus Christ he is the you
[1:25:35] know the in exhaustible fountain of life
[1:25:37] and every one that is planted in him
[1:25:39] can't drink and drink and push out and
[1:25:41] push out to every dent every redemptive
[1:25:44] blessing that God has promised belongs
[1:25:47] to you and it's your personal property
[1:25:49] amen

[1:28:19] and that is our Jesus amen there's not
[1:28:22] an impossible before him there's not an
[1:28:25] iota possibility the Lord does it all
[1:28:27] one time my brother gave a testimony his
[1:28:30] own life testimony took me to a place
[1:28:32] houses that he owned and he said brother
[1:28:36] I own 12 houses how did I get his houses
[1:28:39] I was selling a gas station and my
[1:28:42] mother got sick so we had to buy
[1:28:44] narcotics so when you buy a saw you have
[1:28:46] to she was given a prescription for
[1:28:47] morphine and stuff like that so I begin
[1:28:50] to seduce medication with my mom and
[1:28:52] make money I'm BOTS bunch of houses then
[1:28:56] the law the Lord lead me in the bad so
[1:28:59] they took all the houses 12 houses and
[1:29:01] even they took my money that I was
[1:29:03] working I was only left with 33 say 33
[1:29:06] dollars and 11 cents in my account with
[1:29:08] all the thousands and whatever money I
[1:29:10] had and he said they put me on this did
[1:29:13] ask me to eat up forfeit those houses
[1:29:15] are good to do the rest of my life
[1:29:17] something like that and so they put me
[1:29:19] on parole and I go to their office and
[1:29:21] as 29 look I'm not a person that I used
[1:29:23] to be if I'm the person that I used to
[1:29:25] be and you took my 12 ounces I'll blow
[1:29:27] you to pieces but I've got Jesus on the
[1:29:30] inside so I don't care about those
[1:29:32] houses were not my they were not they
[1:29:34] were evil so if you want to owe them and
[1:29:37] said the Lord is in me and the prophet
[1:29:40] saw said you'll go away you don't have
[1:29:41] to come again I could see a change in
[1:29:43] you so now when the Lord changed you he
[1:29:45] bring a sharp contrast he took impatiens
[1:29:49] out of your life he take demons he took
[1:29:52] ancestral cases he explains that we are
[1:29:54] running through your family that wasn't
[1:29:56] of God you consumed them then the
[1:29:58] attitude of Jesus Christ came to
[1:30:00] manifest in your life now you might say
[1:30:02] oh I don't have the faith to bring this
[1:30:03] to pass when the circumstance comes the
[1:30:06] faith will come amen there's a brother
[1:30:09] from Nigeria he's nodding Virginia now
[1:30:12] he has a testimony was it was a young
[1:30:14] preacher and they used to invite him to
[1:30:16] go and preach he was going to write an
[1:30:18] exams which he has registered for and
[1:30:20] then a pastor I invited him to go preach
[1:30:22] so he went to preach without going to
[1:30:25] take the exams after the exams when the
[1:30:27] resort that under the resort was
[1:30:29] supposed to be in he called one of his

[1:30:46] present it is a mission room have to go
[1:30:51] right you have to stay steady he did he

[1:30:55] chose to honor his faith for forfeiting
[1:30:57] his exams to him preach to go and do
[1:31:01] service for the Lord the Lord took care
[1:31:03] of him mmm and so when the circumstance
[1:31:06] comes the pillar of fire the Holy Ghost
[1:31:09] in you who bring things to pass amen the

[1:37:45] to me some time ago probably out of run
[1:37:47] away or out of shoe wear off but now
[1:37:50] I've got the patient and I can see
[1:37:52] beyond what she's doing that the Lord is
[1:37:54] sitting there and the Lord send it to me
[1:37:56] why of all the peoples in the restaurant
[1:37:58] didn't invite nobody to a strip club
[1:38:01] that invited the sons of God to go to
[1:38:03] strip the Lord has a purpose the Lord
[1:38:08] has to bring attributes when it isn't it
[1:38:11] for amen there was a time I was an
[1:38:13] analyst on a flight from I think Dallas
[1:38:17] to San Antonio and I was on the aisle
[1:38:20] and there was this guy in able to seat
[1:38:23] and another guy and I was drunk smelling
[1:38:26] of alcohol and he started talking to you
[1:38:28] that guy he said I don't want to talk to
[1:38:30] you shut up so he turned on me and he
[1:38:33] was drunk and talking why are you going
[1:38:35] in where you from
[1:38:37] and I also cannot be on that side I
[1:38:40] could have done the same thing like the
[1:38:41] other guy but I had the Lord has given a
[1:38:43] patient and I know there's something
[1:38:45] behind what he's doing and I'm just
[1:38:46] watching the Lord ways going so he kept
[1:38:48] talking and talking and asking me a
[1:38:50] bunch of question like I was under
[1:38:52] interrogation okay I answered him so
[1:38:54] after I said why going what's your
[1:38:55] business said well I live in San Antonio
[1:38:57] - I do a artificial hands and foot for
[1:39:01] military people because some attorneys
[1:39:03] they I think the largest trauma center
[1:39:05] US military center and the whole world
[1:39:07] they bring people from Germany and other
[1:39:09] places to come in to do limbs
[1:39:12] you know prosthetic limbs for them so
[1:39:14] that is good so I said what what is
[1:39:16] listen in life besides money and what is
[1:39:19] your destiny she said my wife is very
[1:39:22] religious and I said I don't go to
[1:39:23] church but I suppose that changes and we
[1:39:26] kept talking the gospel he was drunk and
[1:39:27] he was smelling of alcohol you got to a
[1:39:30] place the drunkenness left him and we
[1:39:32] kept talking he broke into tears
[1:39:35] and as I can we pray we know that right
[1:39:37] in the plane and we prayed and the
[1:39:39] pressure of the logic over even the
[1:39:41] people around well looking not looking
[1:39:42] in a bad way but he could feel their
[1:39:44] presence on the Lord and I said you want
[1:39:46] to give your life to the Lord there was
[1:39:48] something I thought there was something
[1:39:49] in his life that he couldn't give up he
[1:39:51] was a narcotic situation and do since I
[1:39:54] had to give up said my wife I'll let my
[1:39:56] wife come to your church but he couldn't
[1:39:58] come because there's something holding
[1:40:00] my I said my wife Oh Graham so he went
[1:40:02] the pastor was waiting for me at the
[1:40:03] airport said pastor this guy is going to
[1:40:06] raise people for your church he said and
[1:40:09] I could see this is sitting him but the
[1:40:11] devil has bound him so the lot of bring
[1:40:14] the attitude is in you already
[1:40:15] whatever you need it's already in you
[1:40:18] the Holy Ghost will bring it out when is
[1:40:21] needful amen in the UK had a situation
[1:40:24] but Jeff asked us about could you do
[1:40:26] explain this all the time I said it's
[1:40:27] not every time I was never I do
[1:40:29] experience it was in a blue moon in UK I
[1:40:31] was went to wake
[1:40:33] I think the work was cancelled coming
[1:40:35] from Townsend I would backpack on me and
[1:40:37] I met a lady she said what do you have
[1:40:39] for me and I saw I have nothing to cook
[1:40:42] they don't call is true that the
[1:40:44] colleague who can find a suit you can
[1:40:45] grab one she said when I was coming from
[1:40:48] home something to me I'm gonna meet my
[1:40:50] star and you are my star say O Lord so
[1:41:00] she kept talking she was drunk with one
[1:41:03] hand with a cigarette another her with a
[1:41:05] bottle of beer and talking and we're
[1:41:07] going on concentric circle and I'll just
[1:41:09] with not the Lord looking into what Lord
[1:41:11] what do you have for me today so we kept
[1:41:14] talking and asking Christian she said oh
[1:41:16] I used to go to church but then when I
[1:41:18] read a Bible I don't understand and a
[1:41:20] lot gave me a word I said
[1:41:21] yes the Bible has an author just like
[1:41:24] any other book
[1:41:24] the author is Jesus Christ and the
[1:41:27] author has revealed the book on to you
[1:41:29] and she posed a kind of hit hey so you
[1:41:33] need Christ to kick in the Bible to you
[1:41:35] and I said I said star I can't die and
[1:41:39] leave you if I'm your star but as
[1:41:41] thought of David Jesus Christ he will be
[1:41:44] with you even in you on to the end of
[1:41:46] the world and other study you need so we
[1:41:49] kept talking she threw his cigarette
[1:41:50] away she threw the beer away she said I
[1:41:53] want to hear more the word of the Lord
[1:41:55] and I pray for her which said you go to
[1:41:57] I said I go to church in London about
[1:41:59] three away from reading so you find any
[1:42:01] Bible Church here and I know you're
[1:42:03] gonna be the other side I pray for her
[1:42:05] and I left another time I met her she
[1:42:07] said I don't drink no more I just came
[1:42:10] to her I said I know the Lord has
[1:42:11] already done the job
[1:42:12] amen so so the Lord has brought the
[1:42:21] attributes in you everything that you
[1:42:25] need personally and for others is in you
[1:42:27] let's go to reading what the Lord has
[1:42:30] for us even as beside your personal need
[1:42:33] beside your faith your temperance your
[1:42:35] kindness let's go to a first Corinthians
[1:42:38] chapter 12 s1 praise be to God
[1:42:51] first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1
[1:42:53] let's read a little bit downward so now
[1:42:56] concerning spiritual gifts brethren I
[1:42:58] will not have you ignorant you know that
[1:43:01] you add Gentiles cried away onto these
[1:43:03] damp idols even as you were led
[1:43:05] wherefore I give out to you and I give
[1:43:08] want you to understand from here I want
[1:43:12] you to understand that no man speaking
[1:43:13] by the Spirit of God calls Jesus a
[1:43:16] Christ and that no man can say that
[1:43:18] jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
[1:43:20] now there are diversities of gifts but
[1:43:23] the same spirit and there are
[1:43:26] differences of administration's but the
[1:43:27] same Lord and the bases of operation but
[1:43:30] in the same God which works all in all
[1:43:33] but the manifestation of the spring is
[1:43:35] given to every man to profit without
[1:43:37] four to one is given as food they spread
[1:43:40] the word of wisdom to another the word
[1:43:43] of knowledge by the same spirit to
[1:43:45] another faith by the same spirit to
[1:43:48] another gifts of healing by the same
[1:43:50] spirit to another the working of
[1:43:51] miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:43:54] discerning of spirits to another divers
[1:43:57] kinds of tongues to another
[1:44:00] interpretation of tongues but all this
[1:44:02] work all this worketh that one and the
[1:44:05] self same spirit dividing to every man
[1:44:08] severally as he own for as the body is
[1:44:11] one and has many members and all the
[1:44:14] members of that one body being many of
[1:44:18] one body so is Christ for by one spirit
[1:44:21] we are all baptized into one body
[1:44:23] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:44:26] we be bond or free and have been all
[1:44:29] been made to drink into one spirit for
[1:44:33] the Lord is not one member but many
[1:44:35] amen so now this is for the church this
[1:44:39] is for the body of Christ that we desire
[1:44:41] just as Peter was admonishing the shed
[1:44:43] and add to your faith virtue add virtual
[1:44:47] temperance temperance brotherly kindness
[1:44:49] now these are the gifts God has given to
[1:44:51] us in his own providence in his own
[1:44:53] sovereign grace and mercy predestination
[1:44:55] is given some healing
[1:44:58] of healing some gift of faith some
[1:45:00] prophecy to bless the body of Christ
[1:45:03] amen so those give that day but then if
[1:45:06] you don't receive it just like Peter was
[1:45:08] admonishing it's not we we cannot
[1:45:09] manufacture any gift no it's going to be
[1:45:11] like trying to be like a peacock putting
[1:45:14] some feathers that is not meant for you
[1:45:16] but then if we whatever the Lord has
[1:45:17] given to you it could be like David the
[1:45:19] Lord gave David a little slingshot
[1:45:22] through that slingshot he called a bear

[1:54:31] have Jesus Christ you can have the
[1:54:33] beautiful church you can have that

[1:54:52] are part of what the co-workers of God
[1:54:54] amen glory hallelujah praise be to God I
[1:54:59] think I've kept you too long
[1:55:03] praise be to God the Lord is good now
[1:55:07] look let's go to a scripture here
[1:55:08] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 just a simple
[1:55:12] scripture Genesis 1:1 in the beginning
[1:55:23] the Rema of the logos amen praise be to
[1:55:30] God in the beginning God created the
[1:55:34] heaven and the earth that's it let's go
[1:55:37] to John chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[1:55:40] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:55:41] earth
[1:55:42] let's see what John 1:1 says in the
[1:55:46] beginning was the word and the word you
[1:55:50] know Graham said the theologian
[1:55:52] sometimes they wrote it but I didn't
[1:55:54] write with a revelation and the Word was
[1:55:57] with God it's supposed to be the word
[1:55:59] the word was in God every manual weight
[1:56:02] is in you the word is not separated
[1:56:05] where is what was in Christ and the Word
[1:56:07] was with God but it should be the Word
[1:56:10] was in God and the Word was God amen
[1:56:13] when you talk about where does a human
[1:56:15] being are what is the sound that is
[1:56:17] coming from our mouth but when you talk
[1:56:19] about God and His Word is not just the
[1:56:22] inscription of English and Latin and
[1:56:24] Greek and French and Spanish his word is
[1:56:28] the few funny
[1:56:29] his word is the Lucas his word is
[1:56:33] himself in action in attributes Amen we
[1:56:37] can say that LSU's are precious sister
[1:56:39] here when he was a young lady we can say
[1:56:41] in the beginning was stubborn she was a
[1:56:43] teenager some years back and the
[1:56:47] teenager became a young lady she got
[1:56:49] married and I only became a mother and
[1:56:52] the mother became a grandmother and she
[1:56:55] became to bring more attributes it's not
[1:56:58] a different person that was a teenager
[1:57:00] when she was let's say 15 or 16 it was
[1:57:03] an analysis tabitha was a married woman
[1:57:05] maybe 35 40 and 50 and so forth it
[1:57:08] wasn't another woman that is maybe 60 or
[1:57:10] something is the same person she just
[1:57:13] add an attribute upon attribute bringing
[1:57:15] the attribute out same thing with Jesus
[1:57:18] Christ is the same God he was a father
[1:57:21] he was Elohim he was a blow fire and he
[1:57:25] said a blow fire in the church but Rama
[1:57:27] was deplore fire now is in the body of
[1:57:29] Christ the Holy Ghost in you is the same
[1:57:32] as the people of fire so in the
[1:57:34] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:57:36] in God and the Word was God the English
[1:57:39] word for God is God but now when you go
[1:57:42] to definitely have a know him because
[1:57:44] God is just object of worship but the
[1:57:46] Grand Master is Elohim God is just one
[1:57:49] of the attributes so in the beginning
[1:57:50] was Elohim and the word was in Elohim
[1:57:54] and the word was Elohim lla Elohim is
[1:57:58] the same person changing attributes
[1:58:00] became Assyria he became a Sevilla
[1:58:03] became a Sevilla he became God he was
[1:58:05] worshiped he became the OVA Rafa he's a
[1:58:08] healer he has become Deva Missy is our
[1:58:11] banner is the one who protect us he has
[1:58:14] all the attributes in you so now Genesis
[1:58:17] 1 in the beginning God created the
[1:58:20] heaven and the earth John 1:1 in the
[1:58:23] beginning was the word which is which is
[1:58:25] in order
[1:58:25] cuz Genesis is the Facebook right but
[1:58:29] John 1:1 was older than Genesis 1 John
[1:58:33] 1:1 is the logos is Elohim and Genesis 1
[1:58:37] is the creation manifestation of Elohim
[1:58:40] amen so John 1:1 was there before
[1:58:43] Genesis 1:1 came into creation amen so
[1:58:47] you the PLAAF I was in you was you
[1:58:51] before you became a human being
[1:58:54] before you pick on this flesh that we
[1:58:56] are so used to that kind of limit as you
[1:58:59] were in China you had no beginning if
[1:59:02] you read a second Corinthians chapter 5
[1:59:04] we have a Tabernacle not made with hands
[1:59:08] and when this one drops that Minako is
[1:59:11] in you it takes over create what you
[1:59:14] need to create and live on the other
[1:59:15] side internally so you have no beginning
[1:59:18] you have no end now when you go to
[1:59:20] another scripture let's look at a
[1:59:22] scripture here let's because Hebrews
[1:59:24] chapter 9 verse 27 he said it's
[1:59:27] appointed unto man once to die and after
[1:59:30] that judgment Hebrews 9:27 it's
[1:59:36] appointed unto man once to die and after
[1:59:38] that after that judgment and we come to
[1:59:41] John chapter 5 24 he says we are passed
[1:59:43] from life maybe let's read it if we have
[1:59:45] a day less reading Hebrews 9:27 so
[1:59:49] they'll be on the same page Hebrews 9:27
[1:59:52] and as it is appointed unto man once to
[1:59:56] die but after this the judgment
[1:59:58] so that is Hebrews 9:27 John 5:24 John
[2:00:04] chapter 5 verse 24 verily verily I say
[2:00:09] unto you he that hears or here at my
[2:00:12] word and believeth on him that sent me
[2:00:15] has everlasting life and shall not come
[2:00:18] into condemnation but is passed from
[2:00:20] death unto life glory hallelujah
[2:00:26] 1 says Hebrews 9:27 said is appointed
[2:00:29] unto man once to die and after that
[2:00:32] judgment now when you come to a John
[2:00:34] 5:24 very when the law said verily
[2:00:37] verily it means take notice
[2:00:39] truly truly it's a strong word he said
[2:00:42] whether you have to or take it in a
[2:00:44] brutal letters they have setting we have
[2:00:46] number in those ways which come from the
[2:00:48] law that is a word of it could be
[2:00:50] caution or a word that is is cereal that
[2:00:52] you have to take it to heart so said
[2:00:54] truly truly I say unto you he that hears
[2:00:57] my word and believes on him that sent me
[2:00:59] has everlasting life and shall not come
[2:01:01] into condemnation but is passed from
[2:01:03] death to life how do you compare these
[2:01:06] two descriptions
[2:01:07] one says there's an appointment you
[2:01:09] appointed to die once and even after
[2:01:12] that does not end you are going to be
[2:01:13] judge another I said you have platform
[2:01:15] life onto judgment one is talking about
[2:01:17] the flesh man this flesh man the long
[2:01:20] she is not going away when his life is
[2:01:22] over just like your schedule clooth you
[2:01:24] drop it right here but then you've got
[2:01:27] another Tabernacle we've got another
[2:01:29] temple we've got another beam that's on
[2:01:32] the inside is the eternal person and is
[2:01:35] the one we have to start listening to
[2:01:36] he's the one we have to stop insensitive
[2:01:38] to him he that is in you the logos that
[2:01:42] is in you the Christ that is in you the
[2:01:45] Holy Spirit is in you
[2:01:46] the appeal of fire in you the more
[2:01:48] sensitive you are the more he works to
[2:01:50] do one more closer because you can hear
[2:01:54] his voice but when he's singing this
[2:01:56] beat and you are going this way he's
[2:02:00] gonna wait for you here but you are
[2:02:01] doing or stuffy a Shadrin doing stuff
[2:02:04] over here but when you are sensitive to
[2:02:06] the Christ in you he talks to you you
[2:02:09] hear his voice you hear a voice he gives
[2:02:12] direction he tells you that the battle
[2:02:14] is already done victory is yours amen
[2:02:18] you cannot die you don't have to worry
[2:02:21] about your bodily condition because you
[2:02:23] are eternal amen
[2:02:25] no demon no sitter can take your life if
[2:02:28] it's not finished with you just like
[2:02:30] your clothes you are wearing nobody can
[2:02:32] come and pull it out of your skin until
[2:02:34] you finish and you send it home and put
[2:02:35] on another clothe how much more God do
[2:02:39] you think that the devil can take out
[2:02:40] from your a the devil can take you from
[2:02:42] the hands of the Lord no no second is no
[2:02:46] demon no trials no tribulation the Trice
[2:02:49] is meant to strengthen you is meant to
[2:02:52] bring patient is meant to bring a laugh
[2:02:55] is meant to bring a temperance is meant
[2:02:58] to bring faith that you need for
[2:03:00] something future a monogamy for the
[2:03:02] present the Lord allow you to go through
[2:03:04] certain tribulation and trials for your
[2:03:06] future destiny you are going to need
[2:03:08] that faith in the future you're gonna
[2:03:10] need that life in the future you're
[2:03:12] going to need that temperance
[2:03:13] to be able to stand silent Trust in the
[2:03:15] future amen
[2:03:17] so don't look at the virtues as
[2:03:19] linear because God doesn't work in a
[2:03:21] linear form God walks in circles in
[2:03:24] cycles and in spheres what do I mean by
[2:03:28] that
[2:03:29] in our human concept we come from 1 to 3
[2:03:33] God has got attributes the attributes
[2:03:36] are eternal God is yet speaking through
[2:03:39] us God is in somewhere else is in
[2:03:44] brother Jack reaching somewhere in
[2:03:46] Washington
[2:03:47] God is in other ministers and brothers
[2:03:49] and sisters praying for somebody who is
[2:03:51] sick is the same goddess in a sensible
[2:03:55] fountain his infinate he's in system
[2:03:58] Michelle listen my brother he's my
[2:04:01] sister is in all of us and the more we
[2:04:04] recognize guarding us and guarding one
[2:04:06] another
[2:04:07] the more we see the supernatural being
[2:04:10] sensitive to the Holy Ghost in you in
[2:04:13] your brothers in your sisters in your
[2:04:15] ministers in one even in your children
[2:04:17] amen
[2:04:18] never think oh this children this
[2:04:20] generation there's nothing good nothing
[2:04:21] good going to come out of them no God is
[2:04:24] going to issue them more than he's
[2:04:25] showing you they're going to walk more
[2:04:27] in Christ amen because the same one
[2:04:30] because in you is working in their life
[2:04:32] they are going through their destiny but
[2:04:34] the same Holy Ghost is what the same to
[2:04:36] you funny the simple of fire is taking
[2:04:38] them through the channel to put a spirit
[2:04:40] that they need for this life and when
[2:04:42] the time comes the same Holy Ghost is
[2:04:43] going to grab them and use them lightly
[2:04:45] amen he that is in you the Holy Ghost in
[2:04:50] you being sensitive to the Holy Ghost is
[2:04:52] one of the greatest things we need in
[2:04:54] our lives
[2:04:55] prayer and sensitivity to the spirit
[2:04:58] said but how do I guess and seem too
[2:04:59] desperate
[2:05:00] free when you pray it take all the noise
[2:05:04] and the chattering are we it is what is
[2:05:07] knowing this guy here this guy's not the
[2:05:08] one in control no sometimes make a lot
[2:05:10] of chattering thinking isn't control
[2:05:12] telling you taking all the limitation
[2:05:14] that you have oh you are sick this is
[2:05:15] not going to be all right look at your
[2:05:17] problem here look at this year and you
[2:05:18] begin to enumerate them number one you
[2:05:20] are sick number two you don't have money
[2:05:21] to go to you don't have even insurance
[2:05:23] number three your family do you mean
[2:05:25] care for you number four you've got a
[2:05:27] lot of stuff but don't let this guy chat
[2:05:30] let he that is in you this guy here is
[2:05:34] the control tower amen he's the holy
[2:05:37] ghost is the one who's in control he's
[2:05:40] the one who runs a ship he's the one who
[2:05:42] runs the company and you have to let him
[2:05:45] go into action but if you don't let him
[2:05:47] go into action is not going to profit
[2:05:49] you just like because of the plane issue
[2:05:52] I think a boeing has a grounded or the
[2:05:55] point seven three something max it's not
[2:05:58] waking and sometimes not working they're
[2:06:00] not making money they are loose him and
[2:06:02] they are getting a lot of lawsuit but
[2:06:04] when they get it on the air to move
[2:06:06] passengers that is when they put into
[2:06:08] action that's when they get money the
[2:06:10] Holy Ghost can be in you or it can be in
[2:06:12] heaven if it's not function you is not
[2:06:14] profitable to you you can praise God in
[2:06:17] heaven in some way but if that God is in
[2:06:19] you you know sees glory in your life
[2:06:21] that's reason ye must be born again
[2:06:25] because the old bed cannot help you it
[2:06:29] cannot give you patient it cannot give
[2:06:31] you temperance it cannot give you all
[2:06:33] the virtues but a new birth Christ Jesus
[2:06:35] when you allow him let go and let loose
[2:06:38] what do you what do you gain when you
[2:06:41] let God the Lord in I think was a
