coming from brother eddie biscuits church and there in canada they're not even able to meet right now uh so we're grateful that we can come and sit and have service right because in canada just there

he's gonna be with us on wednesday night and also be with us on next sunday morning so we'll be looking forward to that uh following brother ernie that so he'll be here sunday the 7th and sunday the 14th brother paul lafontaine has rescheduled and he'll be here on sunday the 14th so uh we're going to look forward to some wonderful services amen over the next couple of weeks and just something that i've had in my heart uh just been praying about i just want to just get this out on everybody's schedule i want to want us to do a little uh easter service just for us just for us we want to be inviting anybody but we got all these preachers here we're gonna do it like we did a few years ago we had service on friday and saturday and sunday and uh and i'm gonna get it all lined up and let you know but just keep your easter weekend free praise the lord amen uh we're we're looking at putting something together there we'll be kind of coming out of our time of fasting and uh and then just going right into that so i'm just looking for god just to do some uh great things for us uh those that uh on wednesday night and all the other services we actually just join us online if you can uh as i mentioned before periscope will be going away so just follow us on facebook or go to the church website spirit of truth tabernacle dot org you can see the live stream there as i said we started our fasting uh on the last monday and that'll be going through to march 14th so keep that in mind and just stay prayerful and under expectation during this time uh also uh let me just read this really quick it says uh dearly beloved saints at spirit and truth tabernacle this will be our last service as we will be leaving on tuesday we have so very much enjoyed being here meeting each one and sending and spending some time with you it has been a blessing beyond words i know we are leaving fuller than we came and to god we give thanks and praise god's no god knows when uh or if we will be back we sure hope and trust so uh we have been enriched by his presence god bless you all says looking forward to spending eternity with you loving christ jesus brother sal and sister margaret we love you god bless you brother sal sister margaret we love you all too and certainly appreciate you all spending some time with us amen and uh i just trust that the lord will allow you to pass this way again i was telling uh uh uh brother sal and sister margaret the i really appreciate them they were coming just visiting and uh they knew that they would be going you know back uh you know home there to ohio but while they were here they made this church like it was their home and i i'm just i'm talk about i'm talking about at home y'all um i'm gonna give y'all just a couple things that were done while they were here so you all know we have the pantry uh that we uh we do i think brother salam sister margaret heard about the pantry and the very first week that they were here they were at the pantry helping us surf [Music] and i'm talking about not just the first week the second week the third week they were there they only missed one week they were there serving after service one day um i don't even know how brother sal heard about it but they heard about i guess outside the lord had blessed uh brother troy sister time with a house and they needed to move you know on a sunday and uh so you know a couple of brothers you know we said we'll get together and help them get everything out out the uh where they were and into the new house and um and lo and behold brother sal and sister margaret shows up to help brother troy and sister tonya move i'm talking about making themselves at home [Music] and the third thing that i want to say about brother silence is to margaret they knew they weren't gonna be here they knew they weren't gonna be here they knew they were leaving going back but they heard about a fast that the church was about to take had never done it before never even heard about it before but they decided to join in with the fast that this church is taking for 21 days i told them i appreciate that i i i i honestly appreciate that very very very special people to our heart and and uh we're gonna miss them amen dearly and i trust that the lord will just open up the door for them to return again to be in fellowship amen amen amen praise the lord so um as far as our giving we all have the opportunity to give giving is a part of worship and um those that are in the sanctuary you have the privilege to be able to give in the uh the wooden box that's on the table uh those that uh online uh you can give through cash app or through paypal if you decide to use cash app then we accept you with use um the handle dollar sign spirit and truth team and if you want to use paypal choose the option give to a friend or family member and use the email address of giving at john423.org if you would like to mail your offering into the church the address is there on the screen at the bottom and uh and i'm telling you i'm telling you i'm telling you i'm on the expectation that that address is going to change glory glory glory [Applause] amen even brother sal went around town just looking at different properties trying to find a place for us to go i'm telling y'all [Music] [Applause] [Music] this looked nice and this looked nice like well praise the lord brother but we thank god you know so amen but but we're under expectation for god to do something tremendous amen for for the church and um amen i i uh i just want to encourage everyone let's let's let's live above reproach let's live above sin uh let's not do anything in this season that will stop the hand of god from moving in this church brother adam says that one person's misbehavior one person's misbehavior can actually stop the hand of god from moving so i want to encourage you live above sin live above reproach don't do anything to stop god from moving in this hour amen your sin can stop somebody from being healed somebody desperately need to be healed and your sin blocks that you understand the so so your decisions that you make when you leave church don't just impact you come on somebody it impacts all of us so i want to encourage the church this is a season we're at a junction please don't let the devil come in and trick you on nothing because we don't want no hindrances in this hour hallelujah don't let it be your fault that the church didn't get their blessing all right let's pray god we thank you for the opportunity we have to be able to give we uh trust that you would use it for the furtherance of your kingdom here on earth we thank you lord for brother sal and sister margaret god who have been here with us and lord and just all that they've done to make a difference uh in our lives uh certainly have touched us in so many ways and i pray your blessings be upon them as they prepare to make their way back to ohio give traveling mercies watch over their family watch over their home god and when you keep their spirits uplifted and encouraged and as they embrace the fast give them strength to endure the fast and god i pray that their hearts will be drawn closer to you uh lord through all of this and we just appreciate you allowing them to be able to come and and be with us for this time and and lord i just also just pray a special blessings upon every need that they have and and also god grant them the desires of their heart you know exactly what's there so grant them the desires of their heart so father we just ask that as we would now begin to turn our attention towards the word of the lord speak to us reveal yourself to us open up your word that we might have understanding and we pray god that the spirit that was here in the worship would also be here in the uh hearing lord of the word be glorified and magnified in our midst it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians appreciate you all um you all can stand with me we'll uh turn in our bibles uh to acts chapter two pick up our journey here a man uh in acts 2 so good to have uh bro smiley back in service with us amen appreciate the lord watching over him while he was away um devil attacking him in his body but he made it uh by god's grace amen and and very happy uh to have him i didn't get a card on my precious brother but god bless you brother good to have you amen and fellowship with us on today amen praise the lord um let's turn here to acts chapter 2 and verse 15 is where we are reading from amen acts chapter 2 verse 15. did we have any birthdays that i missed okay all right just want to make sure all right um acts 2 verse 15 and it says uh uh start at verse 14 i'm sorry but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them uh ye man of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream james i love the way the word of god is written amen and you know these things were written i'ma put it like this these things were written before you made your mistakes before you fail god it was already written about you so it's not based on your mistakes and your failures it's based on what god has already spoken verse 18 says and all my servants and on my handmaidness i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs and earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever praise god shall call in the name of the lord shall be saved no matter what your condition is if you just call on him he will answer a man a man amen praise the lord you can be seated amen praise the lord as we uh continue our journey a man here in these seven junctions this morning we want to preach on the fourth junction and the prophet told us amen in the message junction of time he says that there were seven great junctions that he saw in scripture uh and what we've done is just kind of take each junction um and just kind of brought that forth the first one first junction was noah uh and the ark that was a junction uh a second junction was moses and the children of israel coming out of egypt coming out of bondage that was a junction uh the third junction which we just ministered on a few weeks ago was about abraham and locked and i'll talk a little bit about that a little bit more about that in a second uh this fourth junction is about elijah and the 450 prophets of baal amen and certain things that happened during that time the fifth junction uh brother branham said jesus came at the fifth junction uh the sixth was martin luther and john wesley brother branham uh said that martin luther and john wesley was a junction and then the last or the seventh junction would be the second coming of our lord and savior jesus christ so uh we want to pick up just a little quote here out of the junction of time paragraph e4 and it says this my subject this morning if we should call it such will be the message to the church is the junction of time and always in the days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end and we hit a junction amen the dispensations come to their end and we hit a junction it says uh there's junctions on the highways the junction uh on the roads that we travel in this world now when he's talking about that uh when you hit a stop sign you hit a junction when you hit a red light you hit a junction a man when you hit a roundabout you actually hit a junction and uh and when you're in a roundabout you have to be very very careful uh because uh if you get in there and and don't know where to get off you end up right where you left off praise the lord right and then sometimes when you end up going on the wrong turn you might go uh oh wow you know we were we were recently taking a little trip and and uh and i i i i took a little turn amen on the road and i said lord i hope this is the right turn because as i was driving i noticed that there was nowhere to turn around it was miles before you could actually turn around hallelujah i hope you can catch spiritually what i just said if you make the wrong turn at a junction it might be miles and let me put it this way it might be years before you can actually turn around and get that thing right again that's why it's so important to make the right turn at the junction the holy ghost is trying to warn the church amen the holy ghost is telling us where we're at you i mean not not only a as a as a the whole church is at a junction but individually we are at junctions in our life hallelujah you must make the right decision at the junction you must make the right turn at the junction hallelujah glory to god and god forbid if you leading people amen like i told y'all my daddy was leading some people amen if my daddy would have made the wrong turn in some of them trips everybody would have been impacted hallelujah glory to god hallelujah somebody as a pastor i got to make sure i'm not making the wrong turns in the south because everybody will be impacted hallelujah daddies amen you got to make sure you're making the right decision for your family because your family will be impacted bless it be the name of the lord all right it says the junction on the roads that we travel in this world they junction on this grand old highway that we travel to glory and always it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that so see i mean it's one thing uh for me to just say the omnipotence is here it's one thing to say that that that god is all-powerful but it's another thing when god comes to vindicate those statements himself and at the junction we actually expect god to come and vindicate that he is omnipotent we expect god to vindicate that he is all-powerful i don't care what your situation is we had a junction and you ought to look for god to do something at the junction amen and only the miraculous can do that teaching of the word is a very fine thing and it comes faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous god i say amen to that we must have the miraculous all right amen now i also just kind of these are some quotes that um uh uh that just kind of help us you know afford and i thought i'm i'm kind of these are things to set our background this other uh message hear ye him another statement that is made about the junction uh here and here ye him he says every junction of time god sends forth prophets then angels and gives a warning every junction of time god sends forth prophets then angels and gives a warning like him uh before the ant of the living destruction before every other time god always sends warnings first he could not put punishment on the earth without and uh without first sending warning all right now we got to watch that because uh you know uh certainly we have had we've been warned uh tremendously about different things that about to happen in this this season this junction uh the coming of the lord there were seven things that was supposed to happen before the coming of the lord and you all just saw one of them manifested right before your very eyes amen in uh and in the fulfillment of a 80 something old prophecy of brother branham saying that we would have a woman vice president not only told us that she would be vice president he even told us the colors that she would be wearing praise the lord and and on inauguration day she was wearing those colors you can take that down amen uh she was wearing those colors so you know here we are we're seeing many things happen right before our very eyes and i pray that we don't miss it uh in this hour glory to god can i just share a little bit more here let me just uh oh what did i do there y'all bear with me you know i try not to preach too long and so i set myself a little timer but so since i forgot to set my time are y'all gonna give me some free minutes amen on this morning praise the lord amen thank god for the free minutes all right amen glory to god but here um uh so abraham and lot were the uh the third junction that we we talked about so let me just kind of go forward i mean bring it bring out a couple more things there uh abraham we know was the prophet during that junction he was the prophet the word of the lord always comes to the prophet uh there were some miracles that happened because at a junction we should see certain miracles that are taking place uh one of the miracles that happened was the secrets of the heart was revealed amen the secrets of of sarah's heart where she was laughing at the promise of god uh while god was there in human flesh uh talked with abraham and sitting there eating and drinking milk uh he asked why is he saying first say where's sarah thy wife say oh she in the tent behind you and as they begin to talk saying now i'm going to visit you at the time of life abraham and sarah thy wife shall have a son and he say uh abraham like okay and sarah's sitting in the tent she started laughing it's like now me and abraham uh have pleasure gifts and no i don't i'm not sure if that's gonna really happen now um um and and and god himself with his back turned to the tent says why is sarah laughing hallelujah now abraham didn't hear her laugh glory to god nobody else heard a laugh but in her heart she was laughing laughing at the promise so so uh so sarah said i wasn't laughing he said yes you were laughing hallelujah glory to god he could have struck sarah dead right there on the spot hallelujah but because she was a part of abraham he allowed her to live let me tell you your sin could have caused you to die a long time ago but because you're a part of christ that's why you're still moving in grace hallelujah somebody amen but the secrets of the hearts were revealed and you know at this time and there was another thing uh that happened and i want to be careful as to how i say this i'm trying to approach this very delicately amen but uh but there was a a thing that happened and sarah and abraham's time and i was this week i was listening to a preacher preach and uh he made a statement that i had never looked at before i never thought about it like this before and uh and he's talking about he say uh you know during sarah and abraham's time uh one of the things that that that god did was a change of the body in order for abraham and sarah to produce isaac god had to change their bodies he says now when you look around today and you see everybody inked up right hallelujah amen so you look at everybody inked up their whole arm is covered amen and tattoos they say what it is is people trying to produce their own change of the body glory to god amen but you got to go beyond just you know somebody inking up but we are living in a time where we can do whatever we want to do with our bodies come on somebody and by doing that we don't realize that amen under a natural influence we're trying to change the body but in abraham and sarah's day was god changing the body hallelujah and we are under expectation for god to change the body again one of these days my brother my sister this mortal will put on immortality and the bible says we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye praise god when you come to church the surgery is taking place god is cutting this off god is cutting that off your body is being changed even right now glory to god hallelujah but this was this is one of the miracles during that time god changed their bodies to be able to produce the promised sun the blinding of the sodomites was another thing that happened there a miracle that took place sodomites were blinded to you know the uh the angels that were there inside him trying to get locked in his family out and i mentioned this i think on wednesday night church don't linger don't linger sin amen lot had a word from the lord come out amen but lot kept lingering in sodom hallelujah glory to god amen i think the thing of it is that we ought to be satisfied that god dealing with us amen if he's not dealing with my brother my sister ain't got nothing to do with that but god is dealing with me i cannot stay in sodom i can't stay in these conditions and i got good news here this morning if god will go get an umber i'm a make believer out what do you think he's going to do for your family hallelujah lot was a make-believer but god went and got lot out of sodom that same holy ghost is here to produce a deliverance for our loved ones too i'm under expectation hallelujah at the junction abraham had to make some really really big decisions he had to leave his kindred he had to search what city whose building maker was god hallelujah amen and uh you know and i was just kind of thinking and abraham's junction they were abraham made plenty of mistakes along the journey plenty of mistakes now i'm gonna just kind of uh uh uh line up some of these one in genesis 12. he gave his wife to pharaoh that was a mistake he lied and told pharaoh that that was his uh sister but it was his wife and and and the man took his wife but god gave gave her back uh also in genesis 16 abraham got hooked up with hagar that was a big mistake he should not have listened to sarah to go and make ishmael ishmael became a thorn in their flesh and still isn't thrown in the flesh even to this day hallelujah amen that was a huge mistake that abraham made and that and also uh in genesis 20 before the promised son was brought to abraham he gave his wife again to abimelech second time this man has given his wife that god made a promise to he give this man give his wife away to another king what a shame for abraham i want you to think about this glory to god but paul writes some things about abraham even though he made all these mistakes paul writes these qualities in in romans 4 verse 17 through 21 and i won't read all of that i'll just say this amen well yeah let's read it romans 4 verse 17 through 21 glory hallelujah all these mistakes that he's making bible says as it is written i have made thee a father many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickly the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were glory verse 18 it says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father many nations according to that which was spoken so shall i see be now this is what paul is writing about abraham even though i can see abraham has made many mistakes now abraham don't look like a man of faith to me when i read this story in the bible i can't see that this man is a man of faith but the good thing about when i read about abraham and i see all his failures and i see all this all his mistakes i am a seed of abraham i have failures i have mistakes but god sees me the same way that he saw abraham amen who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be amen go on to the next verse and being not weak in faith that's what paul said about him being not weak in faith i want you to i want you to see something sometimes you got to stop seeing yourself the way the devil wants you to see yourself you got to see yourself the way god sees you even though he gave his wife to these leaders i mean to the to the kings and all that god said being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb i love these qualities about abraham look at this he's staggered come on see now that that's what men would say amen when i look at it in genesis i would say he's staggered glory to god but what god says is he's tagging not [Applause] oh what that tells me is that every turn we make is predestinated by almighty god every decision that we take it's predestinated by almighty god hallelujah he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and look at this and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform now i love amen paul's description of abraham because i believe what paul gives us is what god actually sees in abraham man only sees your faults man only sees your failures but god sees a promise that he made to you praise god and i'ma tell your failure can't even stop god's promise your unbelief won't stop god's promise ain't nothing you can do to stop god from fulfilling what he said he's gonna fulfill glory hallelujah now i love this and i want to just kind of present this to you the reason paul to write such precious words concerning abraham in romans 4 is because abraham glory before he fell before he gave his wife to pharaoh before he had ishmael before he had uh before he gave his wife to abimelech before he did all this abraham received an unconditional covenant oh church that ought to make everybody happy abraham had an unconditional covenant before his mistakes and if abraham had that you are abraham seed you are under the unconditional covenant now that does not give you a license to sin but when you sin and repent did you hear me when you sin and you repent you can get up from there there is no condemnation when you truly repent [Applause] glory to god look at it in genesis 12. let's look at let's read genesis 12 verse 1 through 3. this is the brother branham said this was the unconditional covenant that abraham received before his mistakes oh if we can only get that then we don't have to sit with mine battles and everything else we can get up and run for our life glory hallelujah hey man now you know here's the thing uh the goal the goal is not coming to church right all right that's not the goal the goal is getting to heaven and there's a reason we come to church in order to get there right the church is a place that that helps correct certain things in our life right you know i mean maybe certain things that we we get tied up in in the world and you know things of the world maybe our thinking needs to be corrected praise the lord it's very easy to start getting this worldly thinking but we got to bring ourselves back to biblical thinking and that's why you come to church in order to hear the word of god it elevates you to live a lot higher than everybody else come on somebody right but bro you gotta understand it's not just coming to church you there's many people i said this on on on on wednesday night i'm gonna say it again many people come to church to try to please brother jack no that's not why you come to church i don't want brother jack to call me i don't want him to ask where i'm at that ain't why you come to church you come to church because you love god because you can't wait to get into his presence if you ain't got that kind of love for god you're missing something hallelujah somebody amen amen i'm not coming because i'm one of the church the church is going to be wonder where i'm at no that ain't why i'm coming to church i'm coming because i need to get something from god i need his wisdom i need his direction i need him to speak to me hallelujah he knows what i'm going through i need him to bring a word from heaven through the pulpit directly to me but don't come to church to please brother jack you missing something hallelujah amen glory to god the the goal here is to get right so we can go home because this is not our home you want to live right so you can go to heaven and i'm going to tell you not just go to heaven because some of us are not going to taste death we're living in that season at that junction where somebody not gonna taste death a whole group of us will not taste death [Applause] some of us are going to go in a rapture we're going to be a part of the seventh junction you're going to be living the seventh junction oh hallelujah all right church glory to god you need to understand what it's all about it's not to please a man this is about pleasing god so when you fail god repent repent make things right god don't hold it over you only man does that matter only man does that hallelujah but god don't do that only man glory to god so you got to live above that live above your reproaches now you got that you got the you know if you saw it you got to reap it you understand it it ain't like it just and it's erased no you're going to reap that you sold it it's yours it's yours you're going to reap it yes yes yes that's part of your testimony now oh hallelujah but just know that god still loves you when man when man act like they don't love you god still loves you he still cares all right all right i want to just show you uh genesis 12 and amen we'll move on here genesis 12 1 through 4 says now the lord has said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred from thy father's house unto the land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great thou shalt be a blessing this is what we call the unconditional covenant this was not based on anything abraham did hallelujah this based on this based on god said i will make of thee a great nation i will bless thee and did god do it i mean i could i can go back and show you scripture where i says abraham was a very rich man that's what the bible says that's what the bible say abraham was a very rich man when i saw that i said amen because i'm one of abraham's seed [Applause] i hope y'all can get what i'm saying here it's right in the scripture glory to god says i will make thee i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and i love the and and and that means it's gonna keep adding and thou shalt be a blessing hallelujah and i will bless them that bless thee hallelujah amen and curse him that curse of and in thee shall all families on the earth be blessed so abraham depart as the lord had spoken unto him and the lord went with him and abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of iran so here we see before abraham made any mistakes abraham was already covered underneath this unconditional covenant and as abraham sees we got to realize we have a covenant on us too amen glory to god even through our mistakes now let's go on here and pick up the fourth junction here uh let's go uh to paragraph e79 in the message the junction time hallelujah god's prophet makes this comment he says notice when the junction time came god had a prophet appear on the earth elijah he had angels appear on the earth absolutely he had signs and wonders to appear on earth he shut the heavens that it didn't reign in the days of his prophecy he done other things and miracles and signs before the people to prove it that's another one it's the fourth one all right so he's talking about this fourth junction this is elijah uh the prophet at mount carmel and uh and when we talk about the miraculous that has to take place uh when a junction occurs we we look for the miraculous there's a a quote and i'll probably bring it in a few weeks brother adams say uh speak omnipotence it's just in the middle of his summary say speak i'm nepotism and i just had to say the same thing speak omnipotence glory to god i want him the speakers it's more than a man just speaking but speak omnipotence let the miraculous take place before the people where they know it's nothing but almighty god hallelujah but here in the days of uh elijah he was the prophet amen that god had called uh at that time the prophet elijah and we we found a story in the book of first kings and uh and here you know there's uh eight miracles that happened in his ministry the first of the miracles that happened and elijah's ministry was he shut the heaven that it did not ring elijah went out and told the king at that time king ahabi says it says it won't rain until i say it can rain now imagine a man having that type of authority that he can actually stop the rain what a man but i want to tell you was not elijah himself doing that it was god inside of elijah giving him the authority and the power to stop the rain pretty much he told ahab y'all can stop your fasting you can stop praying it will not rain until i say it can rain hallelujah that was the first miracle amen uh another miracle you know that happened there with uh elijah glory hallelujah is that he went down there to the widow woman's house and when he went down there to a house uh he was already told by god that go to a certain brook amen go you know what i think i want to do i i'm gonna read this imma read this one i think let's go to first king 17. some things i want the holy spirit to just quicken to us there first king 17. hallelujah some of the miracles that we see uh are happening here oh glory here in first king seven it says in elijah the tish fight who was of the inhabitants of gilead said in ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor ring these years but according to my words now that's powerful no do no rain nothing until i call for it that's a man that understood his position right you know let's go on it says and the word of the lord came unto him saying that now you gotta understand with it not being any do with it not being any reign this actually also impacts the prophet elijah he can't get water and water is needed to live right so he can't even get water but but oh hallelujah amen but but but god had to make a way for elijah in the midst of all this now watch this and the word of the lord came up to him saying get thee hints and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan so god knew exactly where to send the prophet now watch this and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there now i was just reading and i don't know i'll probably get to the quote a little later we'll see uh if not it's all right because i'll just say it i'll say it brother branham said god had already a man made a way for elijah before the problem actually started i have commended amen that the the reigners knew exactly where to go whether elijah was there or not the ravens would have been there i have commended hallelujah i like that amen god had already made a way for that promise to be fulfilled god has already made a way to meet your needs god has already made a way to touch your body what god has commanded for these things to happen oh glory to god i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there can i just also put it this way you can't go anywhere to get food if you want spiritual food if you want supernatural foods you have to be where god tell you to be i have commanded the ravens to feed thee dead amen look at this it says so he went and did according to the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drink of the brook now brother branham said uh elijah was sitting around wondering now how these birds gonna get beef to me how they gonna do this and how they gonna do that so is it gonna come cooked is it gonna come you know he was elijah was sitting around with those kind of thoughts you know the way we sit around and think i i'm can i talk about myself this is the way i think god how you gonna do this and god how you gonna do that who am i talking to who do i think i am that i can question a god that created the universe amen a god that causes the sun to rise and to set every day without my help a god that causes the earth to spin without my assistance and who am i to question a god like that [Applause] no i shouldn't have no questions for god like that i should just serve him with everything i have [Applause] that with all the things he's got going on in the universe he still thinks about me how this come happening how that's gonna happen and what about this and and what if what if uh you know i just want to say really you you can't be like that we talk about god look i'm not talking about you making a way i'm talking about god making a way see when you make it away you might have to depend on your job you might to depend on this you might depend on that but when god makes a way the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein god got resources you don't even know about [Music] [Applause] i'm talking about resources in this particular story god did not use men god use a reason and i want to tell you these ravens that god predestinated there was nothing could happen to them ravens they had a purpose of being on the earth go get food from my servant i want you to bring it in the morning and in the evening and i can imagine god telling birds don't y'all eat til y'all get my servant something to eat hallelujah church we got to know the gods that we serve god got resources everywhere you got taxes to pay go fishing [Music] glory to god we talk about god gotta put money in the fish mouth and bring it right to you nobody else can catch that fish that fish is protesting for you there's a fish got something in it that you need [Applause] don't you limit god [Music] take the limits off praise god take the limits off and what about this and oh lord i don't what are you talking about [Music] now we're talking about a god that'll send you a raven glory to god glory to god [Applause] now i want you to go with these ravens i told the ravens go to the brook cherith and you stand right there elijah you just wait right there and now now while he's waiting guess what happens at the brook tariff the water begins to dry up and remember it was it was his words that caused this condition sometimes your words cause your condition but in the midst of your words causing your condition god still want to make a way to show you that he's still god look at this in the next verse verse seven and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land now who said no rain it was it was elijah that said no rain and the word of the lord came into him saying a rocks glory to god give thee to theraphat now i want you to understand in their father there was still another jug of water even though everything else had run out and you can imagine the prophet coming to zarephath i want to get to all of this but you can imagine him coming this air fast probably very thirsty i had no water in a few days and and i didn't know how god was going to provide and and god said just go to seraphim because in zarephath there was a woman that knew where to get some water let's watch it now said the word lord came unto me saying unto him saying arise get to this airport which belonged to zion and dwelt there behold i have commanded there's another commandment amen glory i love the way the lord do things even when it looks like it's at its worth worse hallelujah the song said even when it seems like you're not working even when i can't i can't see it i can't feel it one thing i do know you never stop you never stop you never stop working praise the name of jesus he's working right now why are you sitting here god is working god is sitting sending angels to answer that request and i want to tell you church there's nothing too hard for god [Applause] amen there is nothing too hard for god oh jesus these are not just songs that we sing but we're looking for the miraculous attraction [Music] look at this look at this he says this verse nine arise give thee to zarephath which belongs to zion and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee now when you look at this widow's woman condition don't look like she can sustain nobody hallelujah it says so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink now this woman knew where the water was because look she didn't say nothing about the water i mean she had no problem when he actually ordered look at the next verse she says and as she was going that means she was going to get some water as she was going out now see the first thing what the problem did he had to test her obedience he had to test to see whether she would be obedient and and i'm gonna tell you what god does sometimes to give you something easy to be obedient to oh somebody work with me she knew where the water was that's why she had no problem going to get water and he was testing her obedience see oh you need water okay i'll go get you some water and as she was going to fetch it hallelujah nice saying okay i know she'll be obedient to that now i gotta hit her where it hurt he called and said bring me i pray thee i'm also the bread and not hand now this is where things got awkward things change right here so you see sometimes when we're being challenged come on i might as well say these things when you're being challenged to do something that you're not comfortable with god want to feel see if you'll be obedient [Music] sometimes you might get challenged to leave a relationship come on somebody sometimes you might get challenged to leave a job can i talk about it you might be challenging areas that you never thought you would be challenged but god is testing your obedience here it is here it is watch this next verse and she said see this one she has something to say not with the water but with the breads wait a minute now wait wait wait ash and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake now god said he sustained he gonna sustain the prophet through this woman now look at that testimony i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die now she's explaining her condition now god told the prophet i i commanded this widow woman to sustain you her testimony i ain't got nothing to sustain you with hallelujah right that's her testimony but god had already told a prophet i'm sending you to her house because she got everything to sustain you now now somehow the way you see it and the way god see it somebody change so that you can see what god see [Applause] something has got to change speak omnipotence oh my amen thank you so here we see it in the next verse elijah said in her fear not i know i heard your testimony i know what you're going through your situation don't look too good right now fear not [Applause] glory fear not go and do as darwin said go do exactly what you plan on doing but when you go get to that that when you get to your little barrel there and you pull out that little bit of meal and your little bit of oil that you were talking about make me there of a cake first now you heard him say i ain't got nothing to make no cake with but when you get to the barrel when you get to your oil make me a cake first and bring it unto me and after make revealing for that son look at this now cause she was she was already doubting now wait a minute man of god i just told you something and i don't think you heard what i said well he has something to kind of change her attitude and this word these these these five words will always change people's attitudes right now if you was going through whatever you was going through if you heard these five words i don't care what if the doctor said death the doctor said you gonna die in 24 hours if you heard these five words you would not believe the doctor anymore oh hallelujah for thus saith the lord those the words that you're looking for for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of mill shall not race neither shall the crucial war fell until the day that the lord's sin is ringing upon the earth when everybody else is suffering from a drought you gonna have abundance but she had to be obedient if she was gonna get this she had to be obedient to what the prophet had told her and and i'm gonna tell you if we're gonna get what god wants for us we have to be obedient to the word of god whatever it is that god challenges you with yeah amen some of us have been challenged in our ties and offering and some have responded but i can guarantee you this god will rebuke to the vow for your sake i'm a witness of it i'm a witness i'm a witness amen i i don't just receive times i pay tithes hallelujah i'm a witness of how god rebukes to devour i could tell y'all some stories about my house it was going to it was going to foreclosure knock on the door early in the morning waking me up out my sleep and i sleep hard policemen standing there a with a notice or sir i'm not i did not wrong why he here here i'm here to serve these papers too you're going to lose this house say oh lord jesus all i can do is go back to what what he said his word you said i didn't say this you said you was going to rebuke the devour for my sake i don't know how you're gonna turn it around god but i'm just expecting you to turn around you know what i'm gonna tell you we need to graduate we need to get out of this trying to figure out how god gonna work it out let me say this god doesn't work too many things out for you already for you to still have them thoughts [Applause] i mean i'm talking about years and years of working things out for you and you still talk about how you gonna do this and what you mean i don't already [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and i'm gonna tell you what god wants you to do in the midst of your weight and just begin to praise him begin to give him glory and thanking him in advance for opening doors that you can't see hallelujah praise god so must wait for the manifestation before we praise god we need to start praising god before we see a manifestation [Applause] glory [Music] another miracle that occurred during this time this same woman that was uh provided for during this drought one day the sun that she was providing food for this son dropped dead and um and and and and and and you know she went to the prophet and said wait a minute are you you bringing my my sin back before me you know i i did this and i did that and i'm not my son is dead what's going on and uh what we found there in the scriptures that elijah you know took the child up into a little room and he just kind of stretched himself on top of the child and he laid there and um and uh and the bible said he laid upon the child three times and after the third time the child received life again glory hallelujah the child received life again this was one of the miracles one of the eight miracles uh that occurred there uh with elijah and i just want to just drop a quote in if i can at this section i want to go to the message the angel of god glory hallelujah amen uh it says the doctors knew he was dead i went to offer sympathy to the family and starting out of the house the wife seemingly crying of the man and as i started out the door human hands seemingly touched me by the arm and i felt it hold me and as i started forward i could not move when i turned back the hand left me so as he's walking out the house he feels something just grab him say don't don't go nowhere just stay right here and then as he turns the hand stops now the hand didn't tell you what to do now it just say don't leave but now the prophet has to be sensitive enough to the voice of god as to what to do next now look at this it says i went to the bedside and looked down upon the man now the man's dead y'all it says there was a methodist minister's wife in the room and another sister and i started to have prayer when i come to myself i was laying on this man's body now he don't remember what happened from when the hand told him to turn around he got to the side of the bed started praying got so wrapped up in the spirit that now he's laying on top of this man hallelujah we're talking about a prophet now glory to jesus take that down just for a second now you know most of us especially nowadays if we saw somebody come and end up in a spot like this on our wait comb it no don't touch them right that's the way we acting but america is about to happen so you can't have thoughts like that when it's time for a miracle to take place [Applause] hallelujah sometimes our thinking stops miracles from happening our unbelief you think god ain't bigger than comet amen [Music] come on church god is way bigger than kobe we got too many testimonies or too many people being healed from it amen some of y'all sitting here tonight today you've been healed from kobe who you think did that you hear on the news all the time about this person dying that person dying but it can take your life who you think did that you think vitamin c did that and and and b three and d whatever no that was the hand of almighty god lemons don't do that and honey don't do that but god can i went to the bad side looked down upon the man there was a methodist minister's wife in the room and another sister and i started to have prayer when i come to myself i was laying on this man's body the dead man says had a sheet over his face for at least a half hour my face was laying right against him and i was calling out into the spirit land brother elijah now ain't it amazing that god's uh god was the way that he worked that he had this man's parents name him elijah and then we go to the bible see that there was an elijah that laid on top of a little boy to bring him back to life now this is an elijah that's receiving life because the spirit of elijah was resting in a man named william marion branham that brought elijah back to life face was laying right against him and i was calling out in the spirit brother elijah his name was elijah brother elijah calling out into the land for his spirit not knowing what i was doing in a few moments i laid still calling i felt that this man's hand come up around my ears the man is working on the pennsylvania railroad tonight alive dead for 30 minutes come on but because a prophet is actually fulfilling scripture when he's laying there on top of this man's body now can you imagine him ladies sitting in there in the room what would you have done if you would have been one of the sisters in the room come on see this is why we need to get rid of our colonel thinking that's why we this is why we got to overcome this type of stuff right because here god want to do something miraculous brother brandon didn't know what he was doing sometimes you you can't explain god oftentimes we want an explanation you know what you know that's why i just said you know he went he went uh sitting around now how the birds gonna do that and how they uh no that's the way we think but the god don't want us to think like that no more like no no god i know you're making a way yeah oh yeah and however you do it i just want you to do it [Music] amen amen amen all right all right let me uh uh okay a couple other um i gotta hit these these points and then i'm gonna try to get out of here i tell y'all y'all gave me some extra time today so i'm gonna take it um some of the other miracles that happened a man uh there was uh the cloud the size of a man's hand it couldn't and now he it didn't rain until elijah said it was gonna rain and uh then he sent a servant up the mountain said uh go up and look uh it's about to rain and the man went up first time saying i don't see nothing second time i don't see nothing i don't see that he said go up again he kept going up and down the mountain seven times and the seventh time he says i see a cloud besides a man he said okay y'all get ready it's about to be an abundance of rain let me tell you god ain't got to do nothing great you don't have to have to show a great sign to do something abundant it can be something real small he caught fire down on the 50 men that disrespected him king king king disrespect him say he look um you know we um the king wants you to come down you don't did this you know did that king want you to come down so he said he sent 50 men up there go get that prophet down from him have him come here he says uh because uh he says he said he said man of god the king said come he said if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your 50. immediately fire come from heaven destroyed him in his 50. so you got to watch how you handle god's servants praise the lord so the the king saw the first 50 die say you know what give me 50 more i said tell him to come down now okay second man goes up there he got you've got you know this authority from the king i'm coming to get this prophet prophet the the king said come down now and see you say if i'll be a man of god let fire come down and destroy you and your 50. fire come down destroy him and his 50. now the king i noticed the king ain't going himself up there he keeps sending people all right so here here here here comes this the king said i i know 100 men undock give me 50 more go up there and get that profit well this fella that was leading this 50. he said he said uh profit please man of god i saw exactly what happened to the first 250 and i'm just doing my job the king sent me up and asked for you to come down you know just to meet with him and please don't kill me and my men please don't do that he says you know what god said because he respected you because of the way he's approaching you you got to watch how you approach ministry see sometimes you know you just you just you don't know what the anointing of being somebody and something be sad and you don't realize what you what you're dealing with you just you just see a veil always respect what god got before you praise the lord it's not it's not it's not respect brother jack but respect the office you understand it's the office that i have to that i'm carrying god god called me to the office i didn't even put myself here i ain't put myself here hey man i i was in a house with me and my my three daughters and a wife that's all i had but god did all this and they got mo daddy getting ready to do but god did this but all i'm telling is that just just watch god respect the office if everybody's standing in lane it'll be all right y'all get me this man approached the prophet the right way and because he approached the right way with respect then he got something you know you know sometimes folk folk not coming to the pastor to get advice they're coming to inform they come in and let him know what they've already decided but you didn't ask for advice because advice would you already knew the advice would have been something different than what you did so you didn't ask for advice so you're just coming to tell me just to let me know right that's disrespectful that's disrespectful amen sometime before you make it i told you make a turn at the junks you might end up in you'll be way down the road for ye miles years down the road before you can make that thing right and you could have prevented that had you asked for advice [Music] i'm coming back to this but sometimes god god has allowed a minister to go through different things in his life so he can help the people and not only go through things see other things in life i watch i watch other you you think you're making a decision that ain't nobody made before you i can see so and so right now years ago they did this they doing the same thing you do and you don't you know i mean even brother branham come on y'all i'm coming back brother brandon was about to make a decision to leave the field say i ain't gonna i ain't gonna preach some more i'm just he got tired of the people not receiving what he was saying so god told him god just showed him something oh my he said he went to a restaurant and in the restaurant god dealt with him there was a man come in the restaurant and say bailey had his i mean where he had his clothes on he said man it was a bum and another fella that was next to him was it was another bump he said now the decision that you're getting ready to make to leave the field he said you're gonna end up just like him [Music] hallelujah gotta show you your future and other people if you make the wrong decision at a junction don't think you can fix it if you could have fixed it you wouldn't be in it now give it to jesus give it whatever it is give it to jesus all right i'm coming back i'm coming home i'm coming home all right so this man say you know please prophet don't don't don't don't don't kill us you know we're just doing our jobs it's okay god said you can go with him because he respected the way that he handled it you can go with him so here he go the prophet goes down and goes with the man and he didn't change his testimony because he was a poor king i say he gonna die because he's seeking for the wrong gods see so so here you know uh uh these were this this that those were seven of the miracles that happened in oh i'm sorry another one was the partner of the jordan when he was dying leaving here go not for not for death but really it was a a rapture that he was taken and he parted the jordan that was the seventh miracle but the eighth one is the one i want to deal with you know for right now um this eighth one is when he caught fire down from heaven amen and what we have and let me just work with this just for a few minutes and i will uh bring it to a close but first kings 18 and verse 21. before you bring that up let me just try to set this up the children of israel got to a spot where they had gotten away from god being god they were they they allowed through ahab marrying the wrong woman ahab married the wrong woman and through his marriage it it it brought in um idol worship into the nation of israel right uh here a country that was uh controlled by god uh a country that saw the supernatural things of god but now and god even told him when when moses gave them the the instructions from mountain and god writing with a finger of his hand and said you should have no other gods before me here they come and find themselves in direct disobedience to the word of god through a marriage understand that right through a marriage now now now uh and the problem is see you got to watch what you marry because you can't get out the marriage you just don't just jump out the marriage amen you you make a vow till death do you part praise the lord and i'ma just say this amen while i'm here just because a person gets divorced it don't mean that every divorced person can get remarried some divorced people gonna have to stay divorced for the rest of their life [Music] and the way that we look at things well this one got divorced and got remar that don't work like that for everybody a marriage vow is supposed to be until death do you part you understand church praise the lord i know that's a mouthful and they have to be sad because sometimes folk look at certain situations say well they did no no no no no no your situation different amen and that's why i'ma tell you when it come to marriage and divorce don't let the congregation be out there trying to give advice congregation don't do that you'll get yourself in trouble with god let it run through the pastors look just go talk to the pastor just go what did he take don't you even fix your mouth they asked what the pro what the pastor said you ain't got nothing to do with it amen amen church praise the lord all right glory to god i have to say things like that god know why they being sad sometimes folk getting all my feeling i ain't trying to hurt nobody feelings but i am trying to keep sin at the church i am doing that i i don't want us to make the wrong decisions at the junction and when it comes to marriage and divorce it takes a lot of prayer you know brother branham didn't just get up there and preach marriage and divorce just because he waited till he heard from god he had a supernatural experience before he preached marriage and divorce sometime before i give counsel i'd be waiting for supernatural experiences you understand i mean you can get you can get in a world of trouble over that church should be all messed up over there all right glory to god hallelujah help us god i need the wisdom of the lord but here you know we have uh this situation where they got away from god because of a marriage ahab marrying jezebel jezebel brought this this this influence not only the influence she got her own profits her own preachers that she's raising up got 400 and and and and 450 and one group 400 in another group and any true prophet of god she trying to kill them this woman was something else and it was ahab's wife he couldn't even stop her she'll kill anybody [Music] she will she'll kill anybody i mean ahab come home crying one day he asked a neighbor for the vineyard and he crying he won't get i asked him nicely and he won't give me the vineyard he said it was it was his father's inheritance he couldn't just give it up ain't half knew what that man was saying but his wife said what you doing crying yeah you're gonna have the vineyard by tomorrow she go and she she gets some some some some uh what we call men of belial can i just tell y'all what the bible say a worthless man men and ain't got no credibility oh amen these men these men ain't got no real good standing in the community right but she gets some men like that to come up with a lie to to to tell them neighbor and when they tell the lie then they had a man stoned to death and when they stole them to death then she gonna take possession of his king go and take possession the man is dead as nothing to stop you from having this vineyard now she had the man killed through her schemes what a wicked woman this man ah i mean it's this ahab mare what a woman you better watch the character of that woman you better watch the character and i'm gonna tell you something i'm i'ma just i'm gonna let this out right now if you're not married and maybe you're courting or you're doing something like this or whatever amen you will never find out who the real person is until you say i do that's when the rubber meet the road you everything else was a lie to get a ring that's why you better make sure they got the holy ghost [Applause] they ain't got the holy ghost you better run for your life you don't realize what you setting yourself up for [Music] glory to god just because they're going to church don't make them a candidate [Music] everybody in the church you know like they say just because you just because you live in the palace don't make you the king that's right no you're a worker in the palace but you ain't the king hallelujah amen just because you work in the barn don't make you the horse you're just a farrier right amen come on just because they go to church don't make them christians you know people go to church with ulterior motives [Music] you got their eyes on all kinds of stuff you think i can't see that think i can't see that i see it all the time i don't have too many folks come to this church with ulterior motives and i have to just wait them out wait them out wait them out and you know what happens either the word gonna preach you out all the word gonna preach that sin out of you amen praise the lord i am a watchman all right i'm coming back to my sermon and coming back to my sermon you know i play golf and i'm trying to get out of here y'all just i got some extra minutes so i'm gonna use them but i got these uh i play golf and the guys you know they they hit the ball and some of the guys i play with they can't they'd be like man i don't know where it went it says right over there jack you it's right there come on i'll take you to it ride them up ball sitting right there like man you got eagle eyes now you don't know what you're saying you understand as a passing as a watchman yes i'm supposed to have eyes to see if i couldn't see get me out the watchtower [Music] if i can't see certain things get me out to watch town i watch everything i watch where you park yes i do i watch where you park why are you parking over there [Music] what you had yeah because restaurants parked all out here why are you parked over there [Music] don't you think i ain't crazy hey i'm coming back to this fourth junction i'm just i'm just letting y'all know i'm a watchman that is that is my job now i might not come out here and say things all the time but i see everything don't think don't think nothing get now and see what happens that y'all can hide stuff for so long but eventually it's going to come out and then it got to be dealt with that's why best get past involved first i don't want to i want to see people make it that's my that's my my objective i don't see me this this this first kings 18 a marriage created a problem for the nation amen a marriage caused an entire nation to forsake god one marriage so that's why as a leader a leader has to be very careful as to what decisions they make because it affects everybody you understand as a leader you just can't do whatever you want to do as a leader you got you got to be very very careful because here the leader ahab impacted the whole nation because he married the wrong woman and and i'm gonna tell you the other thing about jezebel she had no intention of ever becoming a believer [Music] she was under a real real bad anointing and and you know what it was it was so bad i mean don't you think a woman that that that wicked maybe god would just get rid of her no he let them live with her and live through all her antics finally we get to the spot where the prophet elijah can see that the people have come to all this they they're forsaking god they're not serving god anymore they say this is shameful i'm how could the nation of israel get to this spot right how could it happen says you know what i i'm tired of this so he makes a statement in first kings 18 first kings 18 21. elijah came into all the people and said how long hawkey between two opinions can we just leave it there just for a second because we have people today halt it between opinions right yeah and and i don't have time to hit all of this but you know brother branham made some statement that uh you know spiritual amnesia happens to people and uh sometimes it happens through shock sometimes in a war you know maybe maybe shocked through the war or maybe some explosion something happened that shock can cause a person to go into amnesia right they forget who they are hallelujah they forget a man uh you know they just they just become very forgetful about a number of things spiritually you can forget who you are as a son of god as a daughter of god you can forget that because you've suffered amnesia your life experiences have caused you to go through spiritual amnesia brother adam said another way that people actually get amnesia it's not through just some shock or something like that in war he says but when they get halted between two opinions and what will happen that you listening to what this person's saying and then you're also listening to what that person's saying oh god i want to take y'all back to that dream amen that i shared with y'all when i preached the second junction the last dream i shared is that this brother was in a car hallelujah he said somebody else was driving can i go back to the dream somebody else would drive that means somebody else had control of your decisions somebody else had control of your life right somebody else was what was what was there so this brother was just sitting in the car and he saw a dark cloud coming dark cloud represent death hallelujah he said he said and as he noticed you know the cloud coming he said man you know i don't know what's going to happen he said he said but he said uh depending on the decision that we make at this junction it's going to it's going to determine whether we're going to die or whether we're going to live hallelujah he says but at the junction they made a turn no that's not what happened let me uh let me go back at the junction they stayed straight at the junction they stayed straight and said by them making the the uh the decision just to stay straight that allowed them to keep living they overcame the dark clouds now you know as i looked at that you know uh let me just read it here a brother and his family were in a car riding with someone else driving he noticed a black cloud ahead and realized had the driver made the turn the black cloud would have been right over the top of he and his family he stated the driver went forward rather than making a turn and this allowed them to steer clear of the storm now i said someone else is steering your decisions let me say another one and making a turn actually meant making a decision so if you made the wrong decision it would create spiritual death if you make the wrong decision it will create spiritual death some say well brother jack what decision should i make come talk to me let's see what we can do together amen i'ma tell you this when i give you some advice it's up to you to take it or not [Music] you can't you can't blame the doctor when you go to the doctor to get some medicine they say okay take this and you'll be well now if you go home and put the stuff on you i ain't taking no medicine and then you get sick and die don't blame the doctor don't blame the pastor when you fail to take heat so it comes out sometimes you just think i'm talking off the top of my head no i'm talking from experience all right amen this man suffered spiritual amnesia because he got i mean brother man say sometimes people get halted between two opinions and that's what i want to bring out here in this in this thought they got halted between two opinions which way should they go don't don't let the devil get you there i i made i i decided a long time ago i'm gonna follow jesus i'm gonna follow you no matter who come no matter who go i'm gonna follow jesus and you gotta get to the same spot in your life jesus first everything i said everything else second look at this the way that we get people out of spirit chimneys brother brandon say you got to bring them to familiar places again because uh you know when they get to spiritual amnesia and they just they're suffering just wondering the man man completely done he don't his identity is gone he don't know who he is the devil stole his identity he used to be a son of god i mean sometimes some of us are in that place right now we used to be the one encouraging everybody we used to be the ones strengthening everybody now we now we got to get the strength you understand because we're suffering from spiritual amnesia so mr brother adams say the way that you get the person out of it is that you just have to get them in familiar surroundings oftentimes when this is why some saints i'm gonna tell y'all some of the ones that them backslid you want to know why they won't come to church this amnesia will break in one service the anointing in a breakdown people have to run from church because they realize the power that is inside the church the amnesia will break amen the devil said keep them out that environment don't let them get in that environment don't whatever you do just stop don't let them go to church but once they get into the presence that that amnesia be in the breakdown oh i'm a son of god i'm a door to god this is where i belong i don't know how i let the devil get me into this situation brother brother brown said just get him in and familiar surroundings say there was a fella that he was he said he was in the war and they didn't know what to do with this felon said one day the fellow took off they stopped the train somewhere and gonna let him get out and walk that fella took off and started walking and one of the men saw him walking said not the man don't know where he at so he gonna he gonna hurt himself if he don't get back to this transit no no no let him go man stop looking around and saw a hill and he saw that and he saw this and the man something about this he said the guy just took off walking so so the fellas wouldn't just just you know the soldier that was watching him just follow him and as he walked up one hill and down another and up another and that's this guy guys seem to know where he's going and and before you know it the guy kept walking and and as he got as he kept walking his daddy was standing out on the porch glory hallelujah i want to i want to tell you where your dad is at your father in heaven is waiting for you glory to god and he said he said he said he said the daddy was standing on the porch say he says uh when he saw him suddenly say they told me you were dead but i didn't believe it son glory to god i've been waiting for you to come home all this time and that a boy shook out of his amnesia because he got himself in familiar surroundings he remembered not only his home he remembered his father he remembered everybody even though he was he was he was he was messed up in a war and sometimes we get messed up in the wars of life but god will break us free from that amnesia when we come into familiar surroundings [Music] elijah say to god an answer by fire let him be god y'all halted between two opinions but let let omnipotent speak now let omnipotence speak he say the god let's let's make a pact let's let's make an agreement he says you know y'all call on y'all gods and i'mma call on my god the one true living god he said he said and the god that answered by fire let that god be god set it up and they said okay we'll go for it they agreed to it and set up the day that they would come and he said i'm gonna let y'all go first they got up there and built they alton start calling on their god bail bail bail come and bring fire bail wasn't moving and and the good thing that elijah knew his place he knew his position he was one against many he says you know what y'all need to call a little louder maybe your guard is on vacation i would hate for my god to take vacation even when i'm on vacation i want him to be with me he says maybe he's on vacation and and maybe he just can't hear y'all y'all need to do something to get his attention y'all come on fellas say uh next thing you know they begin to cut their self and y'all watch that because the spirit that causes you to cut yourself is a spirit from hell start cutting yourself in it's the cutting itself and um it says fellas i mean it's been all day y'all y'all god ain't ain't responding tell y'all what it's over with your time is up that's it get all your stuff watch my turn come out there by himself and start digging some trenches say dig a trench get it deep deep deep i put some water in there man we trying to get fire you got water put some more water in there put water let me put water all over it all over the sacrament put water everywhere elijah stood there with a revelation yeah say god now i've done everything according to your word i've challenged them according to your word i'm trying to get rid of this sin that's in this nation i i can't stand seeing god i can't stand the fact that that jezebel done did this to the entire nation i can't stand it lord he said he said lord lord lord i then did everything at your word now god as you turn these people's hearts back to you let the fire fall and before your fire come from out of heaven destroyed the sacrifice that was there the people acknowledged that god was the god that answered by fire and after that elijah said you know we're not going to let this influence get out of monks y'all no more because you know some people can see the miraculous and they still don't change amen they're allowed to say bring them them false prophets i know what to do with them and elijah himself took 400 of them out by himself hallelujah he didn't need no help he was anointed but you know what he was not anointed to do deal with jezebel after all that he took off running i'ma tell you like i said it's about david and saul when saul was trying to kill david david never rose up to try to kill saul because here's the thing god put some souls in your life and you can't kill your souls your souls have to die on their own god did not allow the prophet to deal with jezebel she had to down he prophesied about it later on that the dog's gonna lick her blood but that was after he was off the scene be careful what you get yourself tied up to because you don't know how bad that thing will affect you years years years god help us let's pray lord we've come to this fourth junction this time of elijah and the 450 prophets and other 400 prophets lord he had to stand on the word you had to stay true lord you vindicated him and as you've indicated him lord we know you'll vindicate us help us lord to make the right decisions at the junction god these are tough decisions these are difficult decisions but the question is is it the right decision i know lord jesus that you'll put us in places where we have to decide on our own you you won't come supernaturally and do certain things we have to decide on all and it's after we obey that you manifest the supernatural it was after the woman gave lord her meal and oil after she did that that she saw the miracle of god performed in her life father i prayed it should help us to be obedient help us lord to have a church where sin can't hide help us oh god we we we don't want a church where sin can just come in here and feel comfortable lord that's not the church that we're running we won't we won't want people that are free in the spirit because they have repented [Music] and he who the son sets free is free indeed father i pray that god you would uh you would deal with our hearts don't let it just be another word that we've heard but lord let it make a difference on the inside hearts lord need to be changed we yield to you god [Music] we yield to you jesus from jesus name we pray [Music] amen [Music] praise the lord so um don't remember all the words to that song but we'll sing a little bit of it amen [Music] you know that i'm going all the way this is got to be a um a personal decision personal decision you're going to go all the way with the lord jesus no matter no matter what comes no matter what goes you're gonna decide to serve him with everything you have [Music] coming to church we should draw closer to christ that's what the purpose is is that we come here and draw closer to the lord jesus christ [Music] amen oh you know that i'm i'm going all the way and i care less of what you may do or say i said if he would lead the
