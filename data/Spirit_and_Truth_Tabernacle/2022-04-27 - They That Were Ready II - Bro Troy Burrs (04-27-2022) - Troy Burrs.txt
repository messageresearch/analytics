man there's a whole difference between a sunday amen and a wednesday man you see who hey man i'm gonna leave that alone but we here amen are we gonna stand in our post of duty amen uh if one but one person here amen i prepared all week and beyond amen so you know my thought is god has who here who he wants to be here and those that don't have a burn in their heart to uh be in service amen we'll pray for them amen because surely in this hour there should be a burning in your heart amen to be in service every time the doors are open many scriptures say forsake not to assemble yourself together as you see that day approaching amen and we certainly see that day approaching amen i tell you what uh when the does shut and one day they will be shut amen we'll look back at all of the services we missed and say man i wish i had made more services i wish i had been a little bit more desperate a man to uh uh to be there tried a little harder made uh made things just a little bit more preparation amen and that's a lot of what we're gonna talk about tonight is making preparation amen um we come to church to make preparation amen because uh uh certainly that i was late amen and the days are evil amen and for me just amazing that after the service like we had sunday i couldn't wait to get to church and i think a lot of times that uh people believe that all those things can only happen on sunday amen but uh some of your greatest services i find a lot of times on your midweek services amen you don't have a lot of the fighting a lot of the battle because the ones that are there are true believers for the most part amen and pulling on the word amen so let us stand to our feet not going to prolong the time amen we're going to move right into our a little thought amen for uh this evening let's buy our heads and pray most gracious heavenly father god we thank you father come lord humbly oh father god as we know how lord god when just thanking you lord god for giving us another day of father god for keeping us o father god or put your your protection lord over us lord god uh lord god for allowing us to see another day lord god to live under the revelation of the gospel of this our lord god lord god no doubt we're tired in our bodies and uh worked all day and labored oh lord god and sometimes it's just a struggle or father to keep moving sometimes i do get it because i get that way but lord god we ask you to renew our strength lord god and lord god may you bless those that have persevered oh father god to come out brought to the house of god lord god and give them a blessing o father lord those that may be joining online lord god we ask you o lord god to uh uh have your way of father god reveal to them o father god the secret things o father god that you would

destination safely o lord in jesus precious name we pray the church say amen amen you may be uh you may be seated i won't have your stand amen um i'm gonna want to take a scripture amen if you go with me to uh matthew the 25th chapter the sixth verse amen a little a little bible study matthew the 25th and it's kind of um taking up where i left off last week it says uh in the sixth verse 20 matthew 25 the sixth verse it says and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh and go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil for our lambs have gone out amen and we don't want our lamps to go out in this hour amen but the wise answer saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye out rather to them that sell and buy for yourself amen see you have to you have to know him for yourself you can your parents can't carry your oil for you you have to i'm gonna get out this coat cause i feel my help coming amen thank you my brother appreciate you bro that's up man sit over there amen so go ye out you have to know him for yourself you can't have depend on your parents to have your oil in this hour speaking to our young folks you can't depend on your wife or your husband to have your oil you have to have enough oil for yourself amen thank you my brother and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen so they that were ready so the significance in this hour is to making sure that you're ready amen there was a group that failed to get ready failed to make themselves ready for the marriage and there was another group that had made themselves ready and that's kind of what we're going to talk on this evening amen making yourself ready the title is they that were ready so we we we want to um just look at here in 2nd corinthians the fourth chapter says uh but if our gospel be heard it's here to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them now we see that the god of this world satan instead of opening the blinded eyes he have blinded the eyes of the people wow and they cannot understand the gospel so we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for the god who commanded the light to shine in the darkness amen we see amen that that directly relates to genesis one and three he has shined that dark i shine the light into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of god amen the light of the knowledge of the glory of god amen so we're not talking about a literal light we're talking about a light of the gospel in order to be able to see in the darkness in order to be able to have an understanding amen there has to be some light amen but prophet was talking about the little fish amen that fish in the in the in that goes that lives way down in the in the deep deep dark sea they carry a little light with them amen there is a little light in their eyes that allow them to see in that darkness amen and that's what we need in this hour that light to see means to understand in this hour amen glory to god if we can go here to isaiah 53. the first chapter amen it says who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed wow see so it's it's it's it's it's about having a revelation in this hour amen uh uh uh i i'll put it this way uh i had a little quote bear with me one second here the prophet said here in the message turn on the light he says here uh and jehovah requires a lamb i'm at the right place uh one uh turn on the light paragraph 145. and here jehovah requires a lamb for his sacrifice for sin the businessmen that they lived in the cities here and they that sell goods and so forth their products and produce and whatever they're going to sell they don't raise lambs and what did the priest do made a little stand up there for them to sell their lambs so this man could come could go in and clear his souls with jehovah seemed like an admirable thing but it was off the word of god the people didn't raise lamb they knew it had to be a they come to offer their sacrifice and they can go right to the church and buy a lamb what did this fellow jesus of nazareth do what church did he come from what denomination does he belong to what fellowship card well he kicked him out and won't have nothing to do with him because he condemns every one of them what did he do he goes up there and takes uh takes that where men are trying to get their soul saved the church as we would call it today you spiritual minded people he kicked over the tables and throw the chains took ropes and platted them together and run them out and called the godly old priest of yours the son of the devil that kind old man that loaned you money when you was in trouble what is going to stand by you who is going to stand by you and bury you when you're dead that kind o priest he has got the fruit of the spirit but does this jesus of nazareth have the fruit of the spirit you can't judge by speaking in tongues neither can you judge by the fruit of the spirit but it takes a manifestation of the word brought to light it's the light that does it the man that walks in that light jesus christ was not founded upon speaking in tongues though he did he was not he was not the fruit of the spirit so he did you couldn't judge it amen but what he believed and punctuated it uh and god lived every word of promise of that day through him that's the light of the hour that's the evidence amen amen so the light amen is is having a revelation of the gospel amen for your day amen so we see amen go on here mark the 10th amen chapter talking about that right arm amen who has believed our report and to whom the arm of the lord amen is revealed and if we see in that in that in that scripture that it goes on to talk about uh for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground and has no form nor commonness and we when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and was esteemed and we esteemed him now surely he has borne our grease and carried our sorrows yet did we esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes are healed common scripture we hear all of the time when we're trying to give people faith amen for physical healing amen but i want you to understand that that sacrifice was not was more than just for a physical healing we thank god for the scripture and the strife for our physical healing amen but that was a dual atonement amen because it starts with who hath believed our report and who the arm of the lord is revealed amen that'll go further than the healing of your body see the prophet said that the healing of your body is just the down payment wow we're looking for something much more than just the healing of these bodies amen we're looking for a complete body change amen we're looking here on mark the 10th chapter in the fourth verse talking about uh the ladies zebedee amen we'll start from the 35th verse james john the sons of zebedee came come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldn't do for us whatsoever we desire whatever we shall desire and he said unto them what would ye that i do for you they said unto him grant us that we may sit one on the right hand and the other on the left hand in glory but jesus said unto them amen ye know not what you asked can you drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with amen can you can you suffer amen the persecution amen that i'm suffering are you willing to walk up gal gases heal amen and be despised and rejected of men amen are you willing to go all the way with the lord amen because see this this this place that you ask for it takes a sacrifice it takes more than a sacrifice it takes a special calling if we read on here and he says and they said unto him we can and jesus said to them you shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink and with the baptism that i am baptized with all shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand it is not mine to give but it is it shall be given to them whom it is prepared amen he said when he left jesus said i go to prepare a place for you amen that where i am you may be also so he was talking to a a special specific group of people a man they that have made themselves ready amen will be granted a man to sit with him in glory amen are you with me amen so we look here continuing on that kind that thought that in revelations 1 16. amen he said that in his right hand are seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as that we looking at john hill on the isle of patmos and uh uh he's seeing these visions amen but he's seen here in the first verse there of 16 that he's seven stars in his right hand amen and it goes on at 18 says i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore he is identifying himself after who he is amen and have the keys to death hell and the grave write these things that thou see the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw was in my right hand now remember now he's talking about i go back to isaiah the prophecy that say whom has believed the report amen the arm of the lord is revealed amen so we see here at this end time he's showing john that he had in his right hand amen seven stars amen in these seven stars or what these angel messengers a man down through seven church ages amen that are going to reveal the truth amen for their time to whom the arm of the lord is revealed amen zebedee tried to just go to jesus and ask to say let my voice sit at the right hand and one at the left but hold on uh zibby is gonna take more than just asking me it's gonna take a revelation amen that is how you get yourself ready because the bible says that faith amen faithful healing amen faithful body change is going to come amen by hearing of the word amen we have enough faith amen we have enough faith just by reading the bible pretty much without a prophet to have nice clothes we have enough faith in this hour amen that we could get a nice car amen we have enough faith in this hour that we can buy fine homes amen that we can go out to eat every now and then that's all good and fine amen but it's gonna take a deep of faith amen amen a deep of faith amen for your healing amen and that's all fine and well he said i would that you prosper and be in good health amen so we want you to have enough faith amen to heal your body but the prophet said we barely got enough faith to heal a toothache part it's gonna take a revelation in this hour and i'm going to get into something i'm going to show you amen the revelation amen you love the lord say um the mystery of the stars which i saw in my right hand are the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars and the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which i saw us in the seven churches candlesticks now we're talking about how do five virgins lit they lamps amen they lit it with the glorious light of the gospel that's how they made themselves ready amen in the message the pacmo's vision 19 uh 1960 1204 paragraph 207 the prophet says now the seven stars that was in my right hand he had seven stars in his right hand which means the seven ministers of seven ages it's beautiful how we go back to get the minister that brought the message to the f ephesians church age and the minister who brought the message amen the minister who brought the message to the ephesians church and the minister who brought the message held with it until death right down to the submariner church and to the pergamos church the bacteria and on down through the age went into that this age the ministers that kept and brought the light and held it back like the original like the original at the beginning and brought the light through him he held him in his right hand think right hand doesn't exactly mean like christ setting on god's right hand it doesn't mean that god has a right hand because god is a spirit but christ was the right hand of power your right hand man that man the fellow stands by you the closest to you my god and remember the seven stars was in the right hand just think they were drawing their current now see he's going back and forth he's talking about current electrical power but we're talking about delight to light those lamps my god drawing their current their light from him he is the great generator of power amen and we must be connected amen to the generator amen for power i mean we find ourselves sometime in a storm amen and the winds are blowing and the rain and then and and things get all taught man can only do so much they put down the lines and the poles and they got their substations and different things but every now and then we have to have what's called an emergency generator amen we have an emergency generator in this hour amen that we don't have to worry because when the lights go out amen our emergency generator kick in and when it's darkness all over the land amen they say hi those people out there still shouting singing why because the emergency generated and kicked in [Music] amen and our light is still burning amen because it comes from him the creator of life amen it comes from him the creator of power amen but you got to do the groundwork amen before the storm amen you have to connect the dots you have to connect the wires amen it has to be a revelation amen and a calmness that when the lights go out you don't panic i know everything is going to be all right wait a minute hold on just some second boom the generator has kicked in and we got life what happened you have drawn on the faith amen see the those five foolish virgins hey man they didn't have oil they didn't have gas because oil is a petroleum product they didn't have gas in the generator hey man so when the generator went to kick in amen nothing now there was nothing there to turn the generator amen but we're in this hour amen a certain prof group of people with a prophetic anointing amen who has a revelation amen of not only who he is amen but who she is he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll send you a comforter amen i will send you a revelation amen that is the oil amen in your generator that when the power goes out when the lights get dim you don't have to worry amen you have lights nobody on your block may have light amen but your porch light is on amen yeah condition running amen your stones working hey man you still have power amen power to overcome power to withstand the dark ages power to withstand the dark times in your life you don't quit you don't run you don't panic amen because you're connected to the generator glory to god [Applause] amen you love the lord he says here amen still here in uh patmos vision he held them in his right hand hey man think hand that doesn't exactly mean like christ amen said in his hand it means that god has got a right hand because he's a spirit he doesn't have a right hand amen and we'll go down to 209 here and remember the seven stars was in his right hand just think they were drawing the current their light from him they were completely under his control in his right hand oh every true servant of god is the same way held who can harm them who can harm them as one of the angels cried back there in the beginning remember angel means messenger we get to those deeper things a little later in the week an angel means messenger and he said what can separate us from the love of god in christ can sickness can peril can nakedness can sword can death i am persuaded said paul that there is nothing that can separate us can i say it this way from the generator [Music] amen which is the love of god amen which is in christ for we are completely yielded to his right hand amen now we familiar that the right hand means power and authority john the 16th chapter the 13th verse howbeit when the spirit of truth is come he will lead you amen and guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but ever he shall hear and that shall he speak and show you things to come amen we see amen that that that the light amen you're able to see all around the hue of that light amen will give you the ability to see those things amen through a prophetic anointing amen through a prophetic lens a man to see those things which are to come now i want to kind of switch gears just a little bit if we can and go to the message god hid himself in simplicity amen this message preached in 1963 amen oh 3 17 amen was i believe it was the last message just before he preached the seals amen it might have been one other prayer i think this was the last one but just before he preached the seals but nevertheless i think it was strategically located amen because we see a man at the first pool of of his ministry amen when he had the vibrations in his hand and and he was able a man to to to to that was a great healing campaign and being a man and then during that second pull when he was able to discern the thoughts of the people he's able to call him out and say well you were touching such and you lived out of such and such place and this is your condition it was a great revival amen the people thought what a great and magnificent thing oh man we really know now that god is here but let me tell you something that wasn't what he come for he was just getting to the meat of his ministry and i'll show you some things amen he said but he had to get the people to see that god hide himself in simplicity you know i'm convinced that a lot of times we miss the supernatural of god because we're looking at the wrong things thank god for the healing oh god thank thank god for what he did to my wife amen but if we look beyond that amen we thank god for the revealing of the word amen because that is what's going to put oil in our lives that is what's going to keep our generator all full amen amen he says now men has their own ideal good ought to be and what god is going to do and i have made a old testament many times that man still remains man man always give god praise for what he did do and always look forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's the way they miss it they look back and see what a great thing he done and they failed to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of ten it's already happening i believe that i believe that it's happening right now we are being changed as we speak from glory to glory amen we are being raptured as we speak amen because our mind and everything is being conditioned four rapture amen and they look forward to see the great things coming amen and he says it's happening right around them and it's so simple that they don't know it see we look if we go to the first seal i want to read something for them from the first seal 6303 18. amen um paragraph 68 he said oh it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel how we had no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in those other ages all the truth that was truly revealed yet see as a revelation come then he reveals those things in this day did you catch that he go back and tire all of those loose sins now see that's going to take a a a a special it's going to take a little more faith amen for a rapture so we had to go be the prophet had to go back and get all of those things and tie up all of those loose sins amen because you got to be feeding a man from pure word in this hour [Music] not uh i think it's this way or uh it might be this way no it had to be sure line upon line precept upon priest self had to be a prophet to go back and all of those things that was wondered about amen maybe preach even the prophet he said i was going to come out and i was going to preach it the way that i had always started and realized i was all together wrong he said that angel came into his room and revealed to him that night what it was that was the supernatural that angel came to the prophet and revealed to him the prophet talked about that he says oh my god he said it was such a presence what do you think is happening to you when you get a revelation it's that same angel amen he allowed the prophet amen he explained it they but you the prophet said i read on last week that said you can't compare quote scripture for scripture it takes a revelation he said to peter who told you this peter flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you peter so in order for you to receive amen that revelation that has to be amen a supernatural take place in your mind and in your heart amen to receive the revelation of the hour my god connectivity i'm connected amen that angel that presence amen that comes amen you may not feel goosebumps you may not you may oh my god i tell you what sometimes i do oh lord i feel like running when it just drops down into the sockets of my soul that's it glory to god i see it see you for as you oh my god what services we had this weekend oh lord talking about that rock what a glorious revelation but there's more there's more because what the prophet said he said amen there will be a feeling of the holy ghost and many refillings make no mistake about it my brothers and sisters the mystery of this hour is receiving a refilling of the holy ghost without sensation when you receive the revelation of the gospel in your soul when god reveals to you just a little bit more of the mystery amen and you go closer to him it is a refilling i got the quote i read it to you amen let me read on here take the book of the seals and break them and show the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of god is the mysteries of the seventh angel amen now we just come through the church ages with even history uh and prove that see it is the angel's message of the seventh church all right amen go on down to the uh chapter the seven paragraph 74. amen and at the end of the pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word of god he says help me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger amen that will take all these loose ends see you have to receive the messenger see if you don't receive the messenger amen i put gas in my car i have a spout and a receiver a place where i put the fuel amen receive the message that will take all those loose sins and there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church and then there is coming forth seven mysterious thunders that not even written at all that's right and i believe that through the seven thunders will be revealed in the last day in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now won't be able to do it there is something we've got to step further we can't have we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out the earth and we find out after a while the lord will find where it is written amen we will find where it is written of ourselves in genesis the 24th chapter when rebecca at the well of the water at the evening time responding to elijah's call and then following him on a journey to meet her unseen bridegroom we will find where it is written of us in the book of esther of the choosing of a bride and the destruction of haman and the resurrection of her people and the promotion of mordecai and all these mysteries of the bible that we have that have been opened unto us by the message of the hour amen is actually the mystery of your life and what was sealed up in the word and has laid there since the foundation of the world in order to reveal to you personally in this day and so it is only these revealed mysteries of the bible that can reveal yourself to you let me introduce you to yourself say hello self nice to meet you amen because the word not only come to you come amen the mystery to reveal to you the secrets of god amen it also come to reveal to you you amen you are also was sealed up amen in the books the revelation of who you are amen you found a man by the mysteries amen of rebecca amen when eliezer amen had to go away man and and and give her the report amen she believed to report amen and she joined him on a journey amen i believe amen back to see amen her bridegroom amen does that mirror your life amen glory to god so it is the opening of the hidden truth of the bible that show you the mystery of your life exactly as it matches those mysteries revealed in the word amen the mystery of rahab and the token that came by her receiving the message of the hour matches the story of your life amen also the choosing of a bride in esther matches your life amen the mystery of deborah amen the fourth judge who was under the prophetic eagle anointing and who sat under the palm tree a type of the tree of life being restored back again was a match to your life amen it reveals the hidden secret of the mysteries of your life of who you is amen who you are amen who you're who you was at the performing foundation of the world amen the seed was laid there amen of you amen your life and when you catch that revelation amen of who god is and the secret mysteries of who he is you will catch the revelation of the secrets of who you are all these mysteries revealed in this hour have been open to reveal your life matching half oh my of all these mysteries of the bible now revealed amen let's go my sister christ the mystery of god reveal amen 630728 amen paragraph 204 oh my glory to god do you know who you are this evening amen glory to god we see here christ the mystery of god revealed listen now i said i had to quote he say the new birth is the revelation god has revealed to you the great mystery and that's a new birth the revelation christ revealed the mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expresses it through his word by the same action the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is when she knows who she is amen you love the lord hey man i wanna amen we just look there was one other thing i wanted to amen this message that the prophet preached he said i forgot to turn my time on i have no idea what time well hey man i'm almost in closing amen [Applause] and said this the prophet was talking about this little girl and uh a friend that he had uh mr uh utica uh you know that was in the place lived in utica his name was jim dorsey he says many of you people might know him i don't think nobody here know him but he's talking to them back then he used to give them watermelon but he was an infidel amen and one day the little girl was coming from sunday school amen i'ma say that again one day the little girl was coming from sunday school and he asked a little girl one day why do you waste your time on doing such a thing as that she said because she believed that there was a god and mr dorsey said that he said child you are so wrong to believe in such thing as that and said that the girl stooped down and picked up a little flower out of the ground pulled it from its petals and said mr dorsey could you tell me now how this lives there it was when he began to search back he could have said to the child well it's growing in the earth and then the question could have resolved back to where did the earth come from and did the seed get there how did it happen on and on and on and run it back until he seen now the great glamorous thing that we think about but it's so simple things that god is so real in its simplicity so it pleases god to reveal himself then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in the simple things puts over the top of the head of man because if you say why would a just god do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely on god that's the reason we're likened unto lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit is supposed to lead us so man has made that way so man is made that way and god made all of his work so simple that the simple simple can understand it and god makes himself simple that the simple in order to be understood the simple and otherwise he said in isaiah 35 i believe he said though a fool should not error it's so simple so we see that just a common flower a little girl picked up the flower and the flower was connected and the question of where did that flower come from how did it get there to display its beauty at that very hour that that man had that question and that little girl is walking by no doubt that seed was productionated before the foundation of the world that that flower would be there the life in that flower amen that came all the way from genesis amen and that flower had one purpose to be there as a witness praise god hidden in reveal in simplicity [Music] so your life the ups the downs earlier he was talking about that lily amen i go back to zebedee are you willing to drink of this cup are you willing to take this but that lily a man had to press her way through all of the monk all that was put on it she had to press away amen through the muck in the mirror to one day amen press through to reveal the beauty to to to to blossom and praise the lord that little flower had to press its way amen no doubt i don't know if the young girl was walking in a field on a sidewalk but that lily was right there in its position waiting to be used by god and i don't know where you come from in your background and where you've been and all of these kind of things and what you've been through but your time is now to stand up in the beauty of holiness to display the beauty and amen lift up your heads amen and give god praise that somebody can walk and see the beauty of your life and see where god comes from let us stand amen glory to god most gracious heavenly father lord god we oh god such a grateful people oh father god in this house much like that little flower lord god if i'm just to be used one time use me lord to show the beauty of you o lord that someone can smell my savor and be drawn to you that come someone can see the beauty of your life in me lord help us oh god oh lord as we surrender to you lord god as we walk o father god that narrow way or father willing to be persecuted o lord cast down overlooked and talked about lord god we shall not be ashamed lord we thank you o father for the revelation of the hour thank you lord that we're able to see ourselves and how our lives match scripture lord god have see that we are scripture oh my god oh
