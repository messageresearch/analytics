[Music] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we certainly think the Lord for his presence here today in the worship amen the songs that were sung here specials we just appreciate each and every one just seemed like we just kept elevating and you know our capping portion of the service sometime you go to church and all people talk about is the singing but we want to come to church we want to talk about the singing and we want to talk about the word and I just felt like it was elevating just getting us just right for the spot they man where the Word of God can come forth and do something special for some today man we're certainly happy to have our precious brother Nathan Bryant a man with us from Indiana a man as son Philip and a man we thank God for both of them just being here this this weekend and a man and just real precious friend of mine we we have a number of years together a man in friendship and you know we were friends before we were pastors a man and you know God just I think it was later in 2000 and 2001 something like that 2001 when we when we met so 18 years of just friendships and and I just I just loved the way the Lord uses him and in just last night that he preached on my friend I just walked us through the journey of Lazarus and amen just a real real precious precious message and then at the end of that he prayed for the sick and I'm just under expectation that testimonies will come forth from last night God God was God was here God was moving in this place God was right here so many things that were just happening and and and I was just I'm just sitting I said look at God look at God look at God look at God any time you come here God don't speak to you gotta speak to your condition now to speak to your situation whatever it is you need God will speak to him and this morning I believe God got something else in store for us and even as he comes a man that we would just open our hearts from to receive from the Lord I believe it may you'll get what you come for today I think he told us the story of the daddy and the son that went to church and amen and as they went to church to offer him by the book it came by and daddy put that dollar in offering and you know and it's you know son watch that and then as as a service was coming to an end the daddy that really didn't like what the preacher said that day so as as the the ushers were walking by the daddy reached over and grabbed a dollar how to offer mask it put in his pocket what a daddy so his son said daddy so if you were to put my win you would have gotten more out I see lord have mercy the babies right I think God for that so I trust it we've all come to put something in this morning and I believe God is going to give you what exactly what you need as I press his brother Nathan Bryant will make his way forward a man less sing a courser song man Word of God speak pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty babe [Music] of God's me or down like rain washing my to see your majesty [Music] be still [Music] please hallelujah please let me [Music] you're holding your holiness Word of God right of God speed washing my to see [Music] help me to be Steve [Music] in [Music] your majesty just to be still [Applause] in this race [Music] your home word of god speed ami is that your desire this morning [Music] and Thank You musicians god bless you amen the keys brother Jack picks I think he just likes to test out my white vocal cords and see if I can keep up with them but I can't brother Solomon I can't keep up with him mm-hmm at the risk of blowing out my voice I did Ecclesiastes chapter 11 and verse 1 if you turn this morning good to be in church again and I was had a word of prayer on the way over from the hotel this morning with my son Philip and we were just thanking God for the healings that took place here last night a man I believe there'll be many testimonies that come forth not because I was here this weekend but because Jesus Christ was here amen wherever he's at good things happen you know brother Branham preached a message one time called the presence of God unrecognized and I was actually in a car wreck right before my wife and I got engaged I was driving a little Ford Ranger and got rear-ended by f-350 the man had dropped his cell phone and reached down to pick it up and wasn't watching where he was going trying to pick up his cell phone out of the floorboard and the car two cars in front of me locked up and the car behind them locked up and hit them and I locked up and got about this close from hitting them and I thought praise God I got stopped I looked in the rearview mirror and f350 just surrounded me full speed didn't slow down at all and it was just a miracle of God that I walked away I had a little bit of glass in the back of my head from hitting the back window with my head and other than that I didn't have really any injuries and and knocked the - the the radio and the vents and everything out of the dash and just knocked things all over the place bent the truck bed like that and bent the bumper down around the mufflers and and and I happened to think on my way to the hospital and the ambulance you know they put me in a neck brace and everything because these afraid my neck was broke when they saw the vehicle and I was out checking on everybody else helping they said sir you got to sit down and stop and I said I'm okay and then I reached back and I begin to feel some blood and look back and had glass in my head and was trying to pick out all the glass that I could on my own and they put a neck brace I mean I really wasn't in any pain brother Solomon until put that neck brace on then that pushed the glass into my head more and on the way to the hospital begin to think you know the tape I was listening to in the car when I got hit was the presence of God unrecognized and so if we believe that he's omnipresent by his foreknowledge by being omniscient and omnipotent then then we recognized that he's always present but the many times you know sometimes you go to church you say my didn't we feel his presence there this morning well if we came in his name he is there all the time but sometimes we just get in a condition to where we let all the toils of the road and all the busyness of life and everything fade away a little bit to where we can recognize his presence but he's here every service whether you recognize him or not some services we feel like running and shouting and some services we just sit there and but he's there whether you feel it or not amen the the our job is to get into a condition where we can recognize his presence Amen Ecclesiastes chapter 11 and verse 1 cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days amen let's bow our heads together dear Heavenly Father lord I don't know for who or for how many people this will be for this morning but Laura and I know in studying last night you placed this on my heart and I just asked it to be a blessing to the people here this morning help me to get out of the way so you could use me help me to get into a channel Lord where the Lord it wouldn't be me but it would be you Lord that would be speaking to your people the Lord may you come again do the supernatural this morning I pray father will give you the glory in the praise for it in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you can be seated you know brother Jack was talking about how that you know God working and and and how many times it's a god thing that we see God God speaking through Ministers and things and and and we recognize that by the grace of God but I want to say that he doesn't just use ministers in that way but many times you know we recognize it at our church and I'm sure you do here maybe you had a need or a burden or maybe you had a song on your heart all week and you come into church and you sit down and the musicians get up and and whoever still leading the music that morning gets up and they just begin to play softly and it's that song that you needed to hear or if they don't do it maybe the song leader will get up and maybe and maybe he struggled and thought of I don't know what to sing this morning I just don't feel impressed to sing anything all of a sudden the song strikes him and he begins to sing and he say thank you Lord that's exactly what I needed I heard somebody out here when one of the sisters begin to sing said that's my song amen why did God leave that sister to sing that song why not one of the other 500 songs that we sing God works on both ends of the line amen and God uses us if we can get out of the way and get in the channel where God can use this whether it's a five-year-old child or a 95 year old person whatever would be God can use you I want to look at this thought this morning with the help of the Lord just a simple thought I don't have a lot of ones that aren't simple but I want to look at this thought of sowing and reaping and Ecclesiastes here the Solomon tells us that if we cast our bread upon the waters we'll find it after many days and brother Brandon picks up this thought and a greater than Solomon is here in 1961 and he says you're hungry for more of God there's more of God somewhere or you wouldn't have the hunger a deep calling to the deep if there's a hunger that God's placed in you I don't care how many years you've been in the message or how many wonderful experiences you've had in prayer in church if there's a hunger and a desire in your heart for more of God this morning then God is obligated to provide for that design brother branham said that God wouldn't have put a fin on a fish's back if there hadn't have been a water for him to swim in it wasn't some freaking thing of nature that that a fish had a fin on its back but the reason that God provided a fin on the fish's back is there was a water for the fish to swim in so if God provides the desire in your heart God I want to do something for you I want to do something for your people I need more of you in my life God would not place a desire in your heart unless there was a way for that desire to be fulfilled he's obligated if he gives you a desire deep calling too deep then there has to be a deep that is able to respond to that all I want a greater experience with you God I want to see you move more in my life than you ever had before if there's a desire there if there's a hunger there then God is obligated to provide a way to quench that thirst or that hunger bream says that's only the law of it God one of his laws like sowing and reaping and so forth so we recognize that God has many different laws there's a law of faith that brother Branham talks about that God operates on a law of faith that you didn't have to earn your healing you didn't have to do anything to deserve your healing brother Branham said many times in prayer lines he would see somebody come across the prayer line maybe a good christian maybe it's a prophet of God looking through their life and not see anything as far as being a hindrance that would keep them from being healed right before God and all that and walk off the platform still sick because they didn't have the faith to receive it and God works up for the law faith he said then he would see prostitutes come through and receive their healing because they had the faith to receive it and now he tells us that you can't or you can be healed and not even be a Christian but if you're gonna stay healed then you need to come a Christian he tells us that just as sure as faith will kill whatever disease it is that's in your body the fear or doubt will resurrect that thing you know what I was talking a little bit about David last night and when David when he killed Goliath you know he didn't just do like a lot of us do when we come to church and we come down to an altar we say Lord forgive us and help us with that thing that ms settings sin that we keep stumbling with and and he didn't just relieve Goliath laying there with a rock in his forehead and hope that that was good enough he didn't even have a sword of his own but he goes over and he picks up this big sword of Goliath and he takes it and he swings it over and he chops the head off of his Giants but a lot of us we come to a church service and we feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit and I hope I hope it's not too early for you this morning I hope you can stay awake I'll try not to preach over an hour I'll do my very best so if I'll do my very best to do that I'm gonna ask you to do your very best stay awake for an hour jesus said to Peter he said couldn't you what didn't you say with me one hour a man even asked him to have an all-night prayer meeting he just asked him for an hour so I'm just asking you for an hour this morning stay with me alright he chops the head off of this giant and many of us we come to a church service and we feel an atmosphere of anointing we feel a presence of God the musicians begin to get anointed the singers begin to get anointed and we don't just want to leave the anointing up here on the platform but the congregation begins to feel the anointing they begin to worship they lift their hands to God they begin to clap their hands and begin to think about all that God has done for him they begin to praise them and and it brings an atmosphere and then it's the minister we get up and begin to preach and he maybe you know he maybe he didn't know exactly what she was going through maybe he didn't know the little things that the devil's been trying to tempt you with or beat you up about but God gets that man in the channel to where he starts going down through those things and if you've really got any ounce of God in your conviction begins to come to your heart and you think oh my he's talking to me and sometimes you look around to see if everybody's looking at you in point because God is what a man at a channel so specific that you think brother Jack did you tell that brother did you take him out to lunch and tell him about what I was going through brother Jack said no I didn't tell him nothing in fact I'll just say it this way if a pastor got out and - tell me now look brother Nathan when you come to my church there's a sister that she's dealing with this and I'd really appreciate if you hit that and then there's some brothers over here that they won't do this for nothing if you if you could just really hit on that I'd tell them you've probably invited the wrong preacher Amen because you know I as much as I respect my brothers and as much as I respect other ministers there's nobody that tells me what to preach but Jesus my wife don't tell me what to preach my deacons don't tell me what to preach no pastor that invites me is gonna tell me what to preach but when he tells me you know don't get offended if it's Sam laying it on my heart okay and so what a man gets to the channel where God can use them and you begin to recognize that's God walking down my aisle that's God giving me warning that's God placing anointed man in a watchtower to look down the road and recognize hey there's trouble coming there's danger coming and if you don't get right with God it's gonna cause you problems down the road and conviction begins to set into her heart we think Oh God you know the man's right he may be stepping on my toes he may be hurting my feelings but I know it's the word and I know that it's right and I need to commit myself and surrender myself to your word and we come down and say Oh God forgive me and help me this time and then we leave the stone in Goliath's forehead and we go out of these doors and then we get out there and we get around our work buddies and they begin to talk about what they did over the weekend and Satan places that you know Satan doesn't I don't know about how the rest of you brothers were are but when I was working you know out in the commercial world and and working out in the corporate world and things like that Satan never put the ugliest woman in the business right beside me and my cubicle but he would put the most beautiful worst dressed woman in the whole company right by me why because he wasn't interested in getting the drunks and all these other guys had already got there but he won to get to this guy and so you go and you sit down some attractive little Jezebel walks by and begins to lean over your desk and display your body to you and you think oh Lord I know I asked you to help me with this and Lord I know I laid that down at the altar but what do you do you go over to your Goliath and you get out the paddles and you charge them up and you rub them together and you put the Vaseline on me say come on Goliath I was I was under conviction but come back boy I need you instead of chopping the head off of the thing and we played Church and we come and well it was sure good service I felt the presence of God not in printed minister sure was anointed but but we don't fully slay our Goliath and we begin to sow little things oh it was just it was just a little something you know but when you sow little things they grow up to be great big things I don't know about you I don't know how many you know farmers and things that we have but you know when you go to plant watermelons I've never planted watermelon but I'm pretty sure you don't take a watermelon and dig up the ground and put a watermelon in the ground but you plant a seed it's something small it's something that seems so insignificant brother Jiang but you plant that and it grows up to be something big something much bigger than what you planted oh man whatever you know you go out here and you get an acorn in a tiny little egg horn and you plant it in the ground and all of a sudden a huge oak tree begins to grow and it might outlive you for hundreds of years your children might see the oak tree your grandchildren might see the oak tree line because of one little seed that you plant in [Music] [Applause] all brother Nathan I just flirted a little bit with some of these girls that might work and things I you know I don't really mean anything by it but you're planting seeds am i preaching to anybody tonight or I'm at the wrong Church oh [Music] you know my boss on my job he likes it if I wear these outfits that are tight and short and and display myself a little bit all I'm sure he does I'm sure that he does oh I dress okay when I come to church but but when I get out there with my co-workers you know they make fun of me because I'm holiness and so I'm just trying to be a little bit more like them and I'm trying to fit in oh my you'll never fit in over there amen Solomon the brothers Solomon saying I'm going up yonder hey man you'll never fit over and over there dressed like a prostitute a man if you don't like this tonight don't don't come but already this morning don't come tonight to the joint meeting cuz there's gonna be a lot worse than this I'm going easy on you this morning but tonight no or no bars hold I'm just I'm just letting loose tonight can i bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days oh my we find that there's laws that God places there's a law of pro and con there would never be an opportunity for you to enjoy the good days if there weren't bad days and I know in Florida you don't have quite of the extremes that we do back home but we had what they called a polar vortex this last winter and it got about negative eight degrees and there was about four inches of snow on the ground and it was cold and it was miserable and my dad who is stubborn and doesn't like to go to the hospital and it holds off and holds off and holds off till it feels like he's about to die decided on the day of the polar vortex that he wanted me to take him to the hospital I thought dad why couldn't you let me take you yesterday he was sick yesterday why didn't you have any take you yesterday when the weather was nice but you know when we go through days like that then we get into a nice day about 70 or 80 degrees and all my the breeze is just right in the Sun it's just right we've come through us a winter and a spring and summer begins to creep in and now you know an ounce 95 degrees and humid here in Florida and you all are saying oh let the fall come back probably most of you but but you know it seems like was human beings were never satisfied we're always waiting for the next thing when we were more a child we think oh my if I could just get out of school if I could just get a driver's license then I'd be content and then we get a driver's license and we realize what we got to pay for that car and we got to pay for that insurance and then and then we get a job and we think oh my this job is way worse than school if I could only go back to when I was in school but if I could just find the right person brother Jack if I could just find a wife and I could get married and and all my then I then I would be continued find a wife and then you realize hey you got to pay now for two cars and two insurance and a house anything Lord if I could just get a little better job then I would be content and then he gives you a better job and you realize your boss is a jerk and the job is a lot more complicated than your old job you think oh I long for the simple days but if you just give us some children I think then I can be content then I could be happy to see some on my own offspring running around and then they come and you realize now you got to pay for seven pairs of shoes and seven suits and seven dresses and all this and then you know it's just all my drama and this one fighting with that one and and now you know to go to Disney World it's a lot more expensive than it was just for you and your wife and then how you think all my if they could just get out of the house and we can have peace and quiet again and enjoy our retirement days if I could just get to retirement then then Lord I'll be content and you get there and you think it's an empty nest if I could just hear the children running down the house again I wouldn't even care if they broke the China just to hear the pitter-patter of little feet and that job that I hate it I'm so bored and I sit here and I look at for a while walls I have to almost beg my friends to come and visit me and I go to church and my joints hurt so bad I can't shout like I used to Satan will always keep a carrot out in front of you longing for contentment but Paul said I found whatsoever state I'm in there to be with the content this was a man who was in prison who was in this in the sea many days in shipwreck who was beaten they tried to stone him they did all these things to me said I found whatever state I'm in there to be with content if Paul could be content in those conditions oh god help us so there's a law of pro and con there's a law of different things there's a law of free moral agency but yet I thank God that sometimes his sovereignty over rules my free moral agency a man as a young man there were many times that my free moral agency got me in trouble but if it hadn't been for the sovereignty of God holding me back it would have got me in a lot more trouble but there was something about it that God would seemingly allow me you know you ever walk a dog on a leash and a dog has a certain amount of or maybe you don't have a dog maybe you're cat people but I'll pray for you if you are me and brother Brandon don't like cats okay I know that offends people but you know I somebody texted me a picture of a kitten in a bowl and they said don't you hate it when your Chinese food shows up completely uncooked didn't even defer it I'm offending people already brother Jack it's not even barely twelve o'clock but you walk a dog on a leash and he's got a little bit of freedom yeah some you know they've got these things down where it's got a little click thing and you can stop it you know and click it or they got about 20 feet that they can run out and you can click it and blind them back or whatever and and you know that's how I felt like God's free moral agency as he gives us a leash that you know he puts them in here on free moral agency and he allows us to make certain choices but hey there were choices that brother branham wanted to make that God didn't allow him to make and I thank God for it I thank God that sovereign his sovereignty overrode the free moral agency brother branham and those boys beat him unconscious and when shake him and wake him up and beat him again not because he did something wrong but just was cuz he was from Kentucky I don't understand stuff like that I don't understand people that would beat somebody up because of the country or the state or the color or the nationality something that was I just don't understand that a man I don't understand that but they beat him just because he was from Kentucky and they beat him unconscious and they take him wake him up and beat him again and and so he goes home and he gets him a 22 rifle he goes out there with the intention to kill these boys now he'll be honest with ourselves without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we would've did the same thing and he goes out there click he puts another shell in click and he puts another shell in click and it misfires every time and he gets so mad he throws the gun down and the boys run off screaming and crying he puts the shells back in and it suits what the boats not there nothing wrong with the gun nothing wrong with the bullets what was it the sovereignty of God overrode his free moral agency now I believe that that was because he had a gift in his life that God was protecting so that you and I would have the benefits of hearing this message but I believe that God also has that with us and you can look back in your life I can think of specific times in my life and I don't want to get into too many details this morning but I can remember its specific details in my life brother Solomon that I can look back and had it not been for the sovereignty of God that said I'm not gonna let you go that far wouldn't be standing here this morning if God hadn't said no you can try you can run but I'm gonna stop you I'm not gonna let you go any further than this why because of my free art moral agency my free moral agency I was done a man I'd seen how the message people treated preachers and I didn't want anything to do with it and yet a call of God in my life but I found that hey the further you run the quieter that call gets but I also found that you can run but she can't hide well there may be some of you here this morning that you're running but she can't hide from him Jonah tried it he went kept going down further and further and further he went he got in a boat and tried to run that was it for enough he went into the belly of the boat and I wasn't far enough and then he went in the belly of the whale the whale went down to the bottom of the ocean and hid down underneath the mountains and it still wasn't far enough he couldn't hide from God Oh Jonah if you're here this morning you can't hide from him he knows right where you're at he knows how far you've ran but you can trout run him David said if I go up if I send into heaven he's there if I go down to the pits of hell he's there hey man he knows where you're at this morning but we find that there's these laws of and and one of the laws is sowing and reaping and we find there's a statement that says hurt people hurt people hurt people hurt you means if your heart you're gonna hurt somebody else why because somebody sowed something to you and now you're gonna turn around so that to somebody else that we find out a lot a lot of child molesters if you go back and you look into their life what was it somebody molested them once upon a time nine times out of ten or more and we find that somebody hurt them so they're gonna hurt somebody else we find parents that you know are too extreme one way or you know there's a knee-jerk reaction many times that either if they was disciplined too hard as a child then either they're gonna discipline the same way and pass that on to another generation or they're just gonna say well my daddy discipline me too hard I'm gonna they're not gonna discipline my children at all because the seeds that was sowed and instead of finding a balance on it they go under extreme or the other and so when you when you begin to sow things you know it's not just something that that is just going to lay there and just stay the same as it was but when you sow something that's gonna begin to grow and when it begins to grow it's probably not just going to be there for one generation but it's going to pass on from generation to generation Galatians chapter six verse seven st. Paul says be not deceived God is not much for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he read for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall have the Spirit reap life everlasting whatsoever immense owes he's so reap now if you go out here and you plant a if you plant some type of a seed we'll say if you go out and plant a watermelon seed you're not gonna expect for a potato to come up if it did you'd be very surprised and you say somebody sold me the wrong kind of seeds because whatever you sow you're going to reap if you sow corn you're gonna reap corn back and so when we sow things whatever it is that we're so and how can we expect to get anything else back than what we sowed brother Jack preferred the story that I said last night about the man that is some time if you to put more in you would have gotten more out if you come to church and you don't put anything in if you don't put any worship in if you don't put any time in if you don't put any money in how do you expect to receive something back but yet we have a lot of people to do that we'll give to that maybe it a little bit I don't want to get ahead of myself this morning but Hosea says they have sown to the wind and they reap the whirlwind brother Graham said in faith of Abraham 1959 he said I'll preach one of these nights on sowing to the wind and reaping the whirlwind that's what the nation's has done sowed to the wind at is reaping the whirlwind he said we sowed to socialism and reaping communism now he's saying this back in the 50s but yet we still see it today what is it seeds that was sewed back then we're we're being it's the beginning to reap those things now he tells us in one place he said he said the the the things that the government was spending back there 40 years ago he said if my grandson lives to be an adult he said in 40 years he'll be paying taxes on what we're spending back here in the 50s and we see this day the Scriptures fulfilled Amen what they're spending now our children our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren will be paying why because of seeds that was sold back there we would see him strike at things like the Elvis and the Beatles and I Love Lucy and things that it will be real honest with ourselves if you would go back and listen to some of that you think what is what's what was so bad about the hands compared to some of the garbage that we have today it seems sold so tame and by the way they dressed and and the way they did he talked about the Beatles and their haircuts the Beatles would look like some good Pentecostal boys if they live next door to you today let's just be honest if the Beatles showed up and knocked at your door you would think they were a Mormon coming to tell you about the Book of Mormon or something but what was it seeds were being sown and you hear people today they'll interview him what was your influences who what influenced you what was your influence the music and nine times out of ten they'll say the Beatles or Elvis they took a poll and said what was the most influential actor I think it was People magazine did about ten years ago what was the most influential entertainers of the top 100 influential entertainers of the 1900s and Lucille Ball was number one the most influential entertainer a prophet of God saw that seeds were being sown and you go back and all many of us we wouldn't watch I Love Lucy for nothing because the prophet of God talked about it but you go back and watch something from that era you watched I Love Lucy or some of those TV shows from the 50s and you look at what they got today going on and everyone kind of thing brother even talked about allowing men and women that wasn't married to kiss all over one another and things on TV and how terrible it was what would he say today with men kissing men on the TV and women kissing women oh you can get mad I'm gonna talk about it anyhow what would he say today oh my what is it a perversion a perversion you say oh you're just an old homophobe brother Nathan you you hate homosexuals I don't hate them I just think it's a sin I don't hate drunks but I think it's a sin I don't hate cigarette smokers but I think it's a sin it's destroying their body all right this it's a party it's because they've yielded themselves to something there's this contrary to the way that God originally intended it to be a man whatever the sin there's no big sins and little sins I know some sins it will make us more uncomfortable than others but it's just sin whether it makes you uncomfortable or it doesn't make you uncomfortable sin is sin and so these seeds that were sold way back there now we see you know I can't imagine you know if there had been Miley Cyrus's and Kardashian's and some of these things that we have today they would have put them in jail back in the 50s but today you can't even check the news you can't even go on Fox news.com and check about a weather update or see what Donald Trump's doing it or whatever without having to see what everybody wore to every event and what somebody put on Twitter 90% naked or whatever they was they would have never allowed it back then but seeds were being sown seeds were being sown and it's continually got worse and worse and worse and it'll continue to get worse and my Everitt everywhere you look there somebody has done something perverted and instead of instead of preaching against it instead of condemning it they smear it all over the newspaper and all over the news and everywhere you go you can't turn hardly without looking at it brother man said he would back there he said he said God healed my eyes I was almost blind and had to be led around he said I hang a little cross in my car because he said I promised God that I look at the right thing as well my today brother Jack would have to have one in every window and on the sunroof the windshield the left window the back window the right window the right back window the back windshield we'd have to have about 100 crosses dangling from the ceiling just to keep from looking at it today the cedar discrepancy 1965 now we notice that today our churches all our churches has sewed to the winds and are reaping the whirlwind we don't have the prayer meetings we don't have the services we used to what's the matter we've let down the bars on everything we've let down the bars on everything now we recognize it out there in the world but it tries to creep right into our churches he says and why are we not anno domination 1950 he says you girls that's out here wearing these little old shorts and things around you know that's reflecting on your daughter did you know your grandmommy was a flapper and your mammy a chorus girl and that's the reason you're a striptease today it's certainly he said what will your children be what were your children to be why because of seeds that were sown because of seeds that were sown in one generation and then the daughter of that raised up and said well my mammy did this so I'm going to go even further oh we used to talk about Madonna and how that she dress and how that she acted back in the 80s and now some of these people you know that come out today and the things that they do on their music videos and things would make her look like a Catholic schoolgirl but what is it become so normal because we're in inundated with it I think that's a word isn't it and undated inundated thank you brother inundated we're overwhelmed with it constantly oh my I feel bad for you all we walked through our land oh and it was it was bad enough you get down to Miami it's even worse than that why because it's just public flesh on display everywhere and now you know they wonder why so many young people are molested and things we walk through Disney World in 12 year olds dressed like street prostitutes I don't say that to be a judge say that to be hateful but my goodness when you wouldn't when they've got little children out here that they're displaying and perverts out here everywhere oh and then they wonder Wow can you believe brother Jack yeah I can believe it I can believe it I'm surprised there aren't more rapes and things that go on the way that women are dressed today all brother Nathan you can get thrown in jail well I had some friends that got thrown in jail one time for preaching the gospel they sang and the jail shut down the Elvis sang about a jailhouse rock but they really had won the jail shut down what were you what will your children be the things that we set before our children and we think what's just a little thing you know this movie over here it only had 15 cuss words and and you know there was only there was only two or three love scenes and there was only you know it wasn't it wasn't too bad and and what will our children be a blessing prophet 1956 he says do you realize old men when we were boys our boys has got ten times the temptation that we had sister do you realize that your daughter has ten times the temptation you had when you as a girl what will her daughter have look at the things that pictures the Devils are painting all how we need to pray he said now we'll go back to you again brother do you realize we don't pray half as much as our fathers did pastor do you know we don't put as much time on our knees as the pastor's did before us women do you realize you don't instruct your daughters and pray with her at night like your mother did you then what about it who's guilty we're guilty there's no way around it he says we're guilty you know I'm sure you don't have this problem at your church but I'll just tell on our church a little bit okay I'll preach on our church a little bit while I'm here and I'm away from them but we've got some people you know that they they can't show up to church on time to bring their kids to Sunday school and maybe once a month they'll get him to Sunday school and so the Sunday school teachers have them for about 45 minutes once a month then they expect their children to know everything about God and everything about the Bible and everything about the message giving them to us for 45 minutes a month and yet they can't put anything into it they can't have devotions and they can't have prayer time with the children they can't sit down and teach them about the Bible because they're too busy because they got to work two jobs so that momma can have a boat and daddy can have a Mercedes and they can get more square footage to the next person on the next view or the guy at their job and so they work two jobs and the kids have babysitters and our grandma watches them or whatever and the she's she's too tired and too old so she puts the TV in front of them to be the babysitter well praise the Lord yeah we're guilty we're guilty and my son I thank God that the technology and stuff that he'll face that it wasn't around when I was a kid brother Solomon because I did a lot of stupid stuff but at least I wasn't stupid enough to put it up for everybody in the world to see what I was doing I did a lot of stupid stuff that I thank god there's no Facebook account that somebody can go back to and say look what brother Nathan did 20 years ago well praise the Lord I guess I must be at the right church after all our boys has got ten times the temptation that we had technology was just starting to get a start I was the first one of our family to have a computer and my parents didn't know about the Internet they had never had the Internet my parents weren't they were first-generation message believers and they they just assumed that because we was in the message that all message kids were good they had came out of my dad was Pentecostal and then he back slid my mom was Methodist and when they got married they got married in the Methodist Church and and and then eventually they came back to the Pentecost and they were in the Pentecostal denominations for a while and then they came into the message and I was raised as a message boy so I'm sure they thought well he's a message boy and he's playing with message friends and he would never get into anything inappropriate so they put a computer in my at 13 years old with an internet connection in my bedroom and I found out that there were things that you could stumble across without even intentionally going and looking for him that I didn't have any idea about and it became a stumbling block in a trial for many many years it's okay for me to preach this morning brother Jack and now it's not in the bedroom now my boy he's got it right in his hand a cell phone that he can take around and thankfully his dad I don't see that to throw off on my parents they weren't intentionally being bad parents they didn't want anything bad for me they just didn't know about technology it was something new but now then God my son the phone that he has to slog down he can go to four websites he can only listen to the music that I've downloaded to it he can't download any other music if he tries to add an app that he doesn't have approved or download music it pops up on my phone and says hey your son's trying to download this can do you want to approve it yes or no and I'm gonna leave it that way till you about forty brother Solomon but a lot of parents don't know that a lot of parents don't know that you can lock it down like that and so they've got little fourteen-year-old boys out here with in their hand access to anything in the world that they can pop into their mind or that they can stumble their way through YouTube links or Google Links or Google Images define and it becomes a stumbling block and it becomes seeds that are sown in their life that'll cause them problems the rest of their life if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and grant them deliverance used to if we wanted to do something bad brother Jack we had to sneak down to the liquor store and buy a bottle of alcohol and risk being seen or or the boys would go down and buy him a pack of cigarettes so maybe drive 30 miles so they wouldn't risk running into somebody that they knew to buy him and they'd have to go down and sneak a magazine from a book store from from a gas station or something but now you can get it all right there on your phone if you want an alcohol or cigarettes through ever you can have Amazon deliver in a nice little box and even if you know the Amazon liver he don't know what he's delivering in the package ten times the temptation that we had and half the prayer now I'm not a mathematician I don't claim to be some some deep college professor but but that's some bad calculations right there when you have ten times the temptation that the previous generation you had really you ought to be praying ten times as much if you want to overcome but instead we pray half as much as the last generation with ten times the amount of temptation you say oh I don't know about those statistics all trust me they're good statistics you can look around I can see where things have come in the 20 years since I was a teenager it's come a long ways there's a lot of things that go on that didn't go on when I was a child the technology wives I mean still the same sins but it's just been made a lot easier Satan's give us easier access to it and we saw these seeds and if we're not careful it won't just impact you it'll impact the next generation that's coming along we find that what you sow into your church you're gonna reap the same thing what it Church sews or what you as an individual shows into the church if it's Church sews false doctrine what is he gonna reap if it's church you know when you highbreed something brother man talks about you know the spoken word was the original seed but then how that seed became high Brittany said when you high breed something you can't breed it back and he said when when you take and he said he went down there and he was sitting there fellowship and with the brother and and there was talking he said they had a radio playing of the 4-h club there and he said they begin to talk about how they had this corn that would looked exactly the same they had replicated it so close to where to lay it down and look at it with a microscope you couldn't tell which was the real corn and which was the manufactured corn and he said but there's one way you can tell you put them both in the ground and you bury them and one will die in rot and life will spring back up again and the other just died in rot right you want to know how to prove if I got the Holy Ghost or not bury me in the ground when I go if I tarry if I if I go before he comes and if I come back up again I had it and if I don't then I didn't have it you bury a quart of wheat in the ground and it dies and if it's got life it comes back up again and so when you see churches even around the message and they begin to highbreed the truth with false doctrine and with legalism and man-made creeds and things and what does it produce you see their congregation with it's a personality movement once that personality goes on it crumbles because it was built on a false foundation and you see the people and all they can talk about is whatever their little false doctrine is that they rally around and they've got their keywords and they've got their triggers and they've got things that you can say and they'll just make them shout and rejoice and and half of them don't even know you ask what is it that you believe oh it's a revelation I can't tell you well you know what that tells me that tells me that some man has duped you and you don't even know what you believe but you just feel like he's anointed and so you're blindly following and because starving children will eat out of a garbage can and you can't produce a real birth from something like that hey man why because they're reaping what they're sowing and then you see a lot of those that they get so legalistic and so organized that the young people realize hey we can't live this and we that we don't see anything real in this so they all go back to the world and then the old people begin to die off in a church of 300 or 400 and 500 suddenly becomes a church of 12 because they didn't have anything real to so you so hurt and bitterness whether it's coming from the leadership of the church or whether you're sowing it as an individual in the church what are you gonna reap hurt and bitterness but you sow encouragement and you're gonna receive encouragement now you come and and you know we talk about money a lot at church and and you know it's something that you know gets a little touchy and and and I don't know a brother Jack can he can talk to me afterwards or correct me afterwards once I go or tell you brother Nathan was wrong on this if he feels like I am but I believe there's a difference between encouraging giving and preaching prosperity now there's a lot of people that'll preach prosperity oh if you give to the church you know that you see them get up with their smiles and their million-dollar tuxes and they'll tell you God wants you to have a Ferrari well I'll just be honest God doesn't care if I have a Ferrari or not God really doesn't care a man God wants me to be able to get from point A to point B and if I want to go in debt and have to scrimp and save and stress and and be pressure on me and my family because I got a more expensive way to get to one at point A to point B or if I get something that I pay cash for and it gets me to point A to point B without the stress and the debt and all that you know God God doesn't really care at the brand of vehicle that I Drive I know there's a lot of people that they want to preach their vehicle brand doctrine or whatever because of whatever they lean - oh brother branham's drove a four-door all the disciples were in one Accord so we're gonna drive Honda's or whatever would be but but Jesus really doesn't put a lot of thought I don't think into what car I Drive he didn't promise me a mansion that over here and I promise me one over there he didn't promise me a Rolex he did give me an Apple watch that I like cuz I can text people when I'm driving just talk to it and it'll text them you have to make sure sometimes because sometimes Siri makes you say say things you didn't mean to say and you say God forgive me I didn't say that word how did she say that she's trying to get me in trouble he didn't promise me a Rolex he didn't promise me thousand dollar suits and things he promised that my needs would be supplied and I can say by the grace of God this morning my needs are supplied I don't have the biggest Church the biggest hero I don't have that either I don't have the biggest Church I don't have the biggest house of all the people in our church I don't have the newest cars but I've got cars that get me from point A to point B I've got some cars are better than some of the people in our congregation then we got other people in our congregation to have better cars than I do and I don't look at them and say say well God why do you why didn't you know I spend more time praying than brother so-and-so does why didn't you bless me with a car like he did he blessed me I'm content if he blesses me more I'll be content with that and if he takes away what I got by the grace of God I'll be content with that because Paul said I've learned whatsoever state I'm in there with to be content does that mean that we shouldn't learn something better for our family no it's okay to want something better for your family as long as that doesn't become an idol to you and become more important to you than the Word of God and and coming to church and having time with God you know it's okay to 1 good things but our ambition should be for more of Jesus it's okay to have ambition but our main ambition should be for more of Jesus let me just say this and maybe I'll get in trouble again but if your ambition is so focused on your career that it's taking you more and more and more away from church then you need to reevaluate your priorities all brother Nathan I got this job offer and it's ten thousand dollars more a year but I'm gonna have to travel ninety percent of time what would you do I would be content in the state that I'm in because if you sit out at church the prophet of God said you will spiritually wither up and die and ten years down the road you might have a bit better car than brother Jack has you might have a nicer home than brother Jack has and your children might be sitting there saying daddy they said this in Sunday school about Noah why haven't you ever told us about Noah I was too busy traveling so that we could buy a bigger boat what are you so you'll reap what would you do brother Nathan I've had people ask me about moving to different places and things what would if he was gonna move would you move for a job if there was a good Christian Church that I could go to and I felt led to I would move for a job but I wouldn't move to a job out in Timbuktu where there's no church well I just stay at home and streamed I'll just say home and listen to tapes yeah I've seen families like that and I've seen what their children are like and I've seen what what it produces in their marriage and I wouldn't encourage it to anybody a man if somebody offered me a million dollars a year to move somewhere where there was no church I wouldn't do it oh you just say that brother Nathan cuz you're a pastor not promised you before the Lord I wouldn't do it I wouldn't move somewhere where my children would suffer because they couldn't be in church and wither up and spiritually die so that I could say hey see what I'm driving we think about that I'm the man no he's the man and that job situation might change and then you're stuck in Timbuktu without enough money to get back home to where you came from well I believe in encouraging giving but I don't believe in preaching prosperity all if you just give a little more in the basket then God's gonna bless you little bit more well he might but if you're given with those intentions then you're given for the wrong reasons God loves a cheerful giver not a stingy Giver Lord I'll give you 20 if you'll give me 40 but like like we said you get what you put in oh my then there's people that won't support the church they make too much to pay tithes or they make too little to make tithes you know there's never any you never do seem to find somebody that's just right there in the middle and they they make just enough to where they can pay tithes you know it's like Goldilocks and the three bears oh you know is this not enough tithe to pay I'm too poor I can't pay or or Lord I've got too much money I couldn't pay tithes on this but well then there's the ones that's just right right in the middle lord I finally reached that exact dollar amount where I can pay tithes for a little while and people won't support the church they want to see the church dragged on but then but then when they need help and when they don't have a job who's the first person they come to buy the jagan you know that job that I've been missing church so much for then I made too much money to pay tithes because I was yeah they they eliminated my position and you know that house that I bought because I was taking so much I'm having a really hard time making that payment so you think the church could help well you get what you put in god help us laying up my treasures in that home above how much are we laying up over there and I'm not just talking about dollars and since this morning but how much time do we put into it a lot of times people dragging in an hour late instead of getting there half an hour an hour early and praying for the service and they say I didn't get much out of church well you did you missed the whole worship service and you came in you were still thinking about what you and your wife argued about in the parking lot and how she was yelling at you for running that stoplight and I'm sure there's nobody like that here this morning but we're just talking you know and and and and you still all worked up and frustrated and and you know her hairs hanging down in her face cuz she ran out the door and didn't get it all up or just right and then the Sun just began to wilt it all down and and you get in your frazzle and you sit there and then you think now I was so busy and so late that I didn't get any breakfast all you can think about is lunch all the way through the service you know then you've got people that they want to tell the pastor who they can help now look brother Jack I'll pay tithe but I don't want you helping so and so with my tithes don't you help so-and-so you know because I they're they're just too lazy no good for nothing nobody and either you can do what you want with my tithes but don't you help son so well whose times do you think it was to help she when you needed help and then we've got people that they sow seeds of talking bad about the church or talking bad about the pastor or talking bad about the musicians or the song I didn't like the way they did this they sang too long well this guy over here says they didn't sing long enough and this one says they sing too loud and this one says I couldn't hear it I wish they would have turned it up and and you know this one says they had the temperature too cold and I was about to freeze to death and I'm have to start bringing two blankets instead of one and then the other one says oh no I was about I was about to roast to death they couldn't turn it down low enough for me is there something wrong with the see and when we leave church that's the things that we take away instead of all my the presence of God was there and the pastor preached and we're talking about the thermostat and we're talking about the temperature of the water is the water heater broke because I can never could get the water hot enough to really get my hands watched the way that I wanted to and and we begin to focus on all of those things and and what do you get you get what you receive you get what you put in you receive what you put in you know there was some parents in the days of Elijah that they said around the dinner table and they'd all they had was to say was negative things about Elijah's ministry he preached too long he preached too hard he got on this topic doesn't he know I've got a nephew that struggles with that why would he preach that with me sitting there and so he came out one day and these little children that said at the dinner table came out and said hail ball head why don't you go up like Elijah did they didn't make that up on their own they said at the dinner table and heard that and a prophet got angry and curse those children to see bears came out and ate them we were worried about kittens earlier what about little children the Bears came out and ate them brother him said that wasn't the Holy Spirit it wasn't the nature of a Holy Spirit it was an angry prophet and it wasn't the children's fault it was the parents fault because what they had put before him and many times will show things well I don't agree with brother so-and-so and I don't like the way he runs his service and I don't like this over here and over there and then our children go to a youth camp or something and sitting there and that Minister gets up and maybe the Holy Spirit wanting to use him to impact those children to make a change in their life and they said their thing I remember what daddy said about him ain't nobody he a nobody he teaches this and he's up here and he's up there and and Satan has soda seed that hinders that child and undermines what God is trying to do before your family through that ministry but you so love and mercy and forgiveness and then what's going to come back to you love and mercy and forgiveness the leadership of the church souls balance they sew the word they sew faith they're gonna receive things from that it's gonna produce things and the people that they're leading what are you so into your marriage you sew into your family I'm trying to close but I feel like we're maybe not done quite yet what he's so into your marriage what are you so into your family you're gonna reap back those same things if you saw an atmosphere of fear what's it gonna produce now there's different types of fear there's a fear of you know some some Overlord that's gonna bless God you better shut your mouth boy I brought you into this role I can take you back there's that type of fear rule in a house with fear like that with a ruler of iron but then there's another type of fear that's just afraid of everything that all did we lock the doors and we check it 500 times and did you sanitize your hands and and oh don't go outside because you might get my mitt my mosquito that's packing a disease or and if we're not careful we live in an atmosphere of fear afraid to do anything and you saw an atmosphere of fear to your children and it's gonna produce a child that grows up afraid of everything you so anger maybe oh maybe you say I don't get angry with my children I don't get angry with my wife maybe it's not that maybe it's somebody at church that you're angry with or maybe it's somebody in your extended family that you're angry with and all you can sow is bitterness because of that bless God if I ever get a chance I'll get even with them and you allow that bitterness and that hurt towards family you you so that and what's it gonna produce in those children that you're raising up you talk bad about your spouse in front of your children and then you expect them to treat their spouse the right way when they grow up what have you sowed brother branham said he said I'm a Kentuckian united we stand divided we fall and he's talking about as a nation and as a church but I want to bring that down to the family as well brother Graham said when that when the family when the children lose respect for the parents he said the family's gone that home is ruined and he said when the when the church loses respect for the pastor that church is gone why because of things that have been sowed and when we begin you know if we don't stand together I believe it was it was one of the founding fathers said if we don't stand too then stick together then we'll surely all hang together and many times the very things that destroys families and destroys homes and destroys churches maryam said it's not the Robin that's pecking away from the outside somebody come in from the outside trying to destroy it's the worm that's eaten away at it at the core and many times we're sewing things that destroy families and destroy churches why because we allowed that to come in and we allowed it to be projected and many times if we're not careful where the very ones that's hurting ourselves if we're not careful we'll destroy the example of how our children should treat their spouse but if you saw an atmosphere of love and acceptance not just saying the words I love you and I accept you but it's really truly showing that child you know I told my children many times I've tried to encourage them don't lied to me a man if they just tell me the truth or whatever it is that they've done the punishment will be much less if they just tell me the truth and don't lie to me about it and I'm trying to create an atmosphere where they can be a confident to come to me and tell me look daddy hey I made a mistake I did this and I want to be that person brother Solomon that they can come and talk to you about that because if not they'll go and talk to somebody else about it brother Ben said you Mother's he said all nice and some of the doctors had said oh just let the babies cry it out he said sounded like a witch doctor to me more than a real doctor and he said that child needs your love that child needs your love II said if you don't give it love it'll find somebody that will you wonder why there's so many sisters that run out and they wind up having children out of wedlock and having all kinds of problems and things why a lot of times it's because they had daddy issues or mommy issues that nobody would love them at home so they had to run out and find somebody that would show them love because of seeds that were sown because of seeds that were sown let me tell you this morning young people Satan will try to destroy your life if you'll allow him to he will try to destroy your life at a young age he'll put some slicker in your way that'll just say all the right things and do all the right things and you think oh he loves me and I've never been loved before no no he's probably got different intentions than just love but I pray that God will send somebody along to you that will really love you that won't just look into your eyes and compliments your body but he'll appreciate your mind and your spirit and your stand for the word of God because let me let's just be honest and may I may have said it here before but I'll say it again you know if you're looking for somebody I don't know how many single here I want to ask you to raise your hand but if you're single and you're looking for somebody there ain't nobody that go shopping down at the nursing home there ain't nothing attractive there brother Jack might go to preach to people in the in the nursing home I guarantee you when he was when he was at the dating age before him and sister Erica met he wasn't going down to the nursing home saying oh I'm gonna find me a honey because time time fades away a lot of that attraction part and so a lot of times we go out just looking for attraction and I thank God that I found an attractive wife I thank God that there was attraction but I didn't marry her for attraction because if we live fifty more years a lot of that will have faded and I'm not just talking about her and trust me it's already starting to fade right here I didn't have all these gray hairs when I married her brother Solomon had hair when he married his but thankfully brothers Solomon has a nice shaped head I don't think I would look as good bald as he did so I pray that God gives me a full head of hair till I'm about 90 but if he doesn't you might look at me and if you're sitting behind me in a service you'd be be distracted by the knots and things sticking out and think my goodness his head ain't shaped like brother Solomon's God God must be paying him back for something but I married her because of character because I recognize she loved the word and she loved me and it wasn't just because of my hair it wasn't just because of my brown eyes it was because there was something there but I REM said said when you really find somebody that you love and it's not just some physical thing because hey trust me if it's just a physical thing then 20 years agos down the road and he'll trade you in for a newer model or vice versa you see we just said that about the men but in this age it's the women doing it too they like those younger boys a lot of the women today I don't it's six some of the stuff that goes on out here but a lot of it's because of seeds that was sown seeds that was some one but we should so we should so an atmosphere of love an atmosphere to accept our children and say look even if you make a mistake I love you anyhow I won't agree with it I might not agree with your lifestyle may not agree with your decisions but I'll love you anyhow and I'll be here and Jesus will be here waiting for you when you get as desperate as the prodigal son didn't you come back home I'll be waiting right here for you we saw those kind of things and it'll produce something in our children's lives Oh mine see marriage is a two-way street give and take a lot of times people you see marriages and you can tell which ones the giver and which ones the taker but it should be give-and-take a friendship just a friendship brother Jack and I you know he's one of my closest friends you know why because we have a friendship that's give-and-take and he doesn't always come to me and just brother Nathan I need this and brother Nathan I want that and I don't just always go to him and say brother Jack I need your time I need your attention I need your money I need this I need that but it's give-and-take and sometimes he's encouraging me and sometimes I'm encouraging him and sometimes he's inviting me to preach and sometimes I'm inviting him to preach and and sometimes you know he's asking me a question of something I've dealt with and sometimes I'm asking him a question of something that he's dealt with but one-sided friendships don't work one-sided marriages don't work one-sided churches don't work when the leadership is trying their best the son leader is trying his best to get you in an atmosphere and you're sitting there I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them well why don't you tell your face to show it every once in a while what we sell we reap what you put into church you're gonna get out what you put into your marriage what you put into your children you're gonna get those things out now sometimes it's not instantaneous sometimes we sow something if we're not careful we go back out there you know our our children were a science project that they had recently was to plant some seeds and two of them their seeds came up real nice and one of them it wasn't coming up at all and finally mama switched the pots around I think and gave one of the kids her pot because that seed must have been a hybrid or something it wasn't coming out but you know what if you plant a seed and then a day later you go out there and you say oh my that that seed I wonder how it's doing you pull back the dirt and you look at it I don't see nothing I don't see no roots I don't see nothing you put it back in bury it back up and give it a little bit of water and scoot it out closer to the Sun and you come back the next morning you keep checking it up what are you gonna do it's never gonna grow because you keep digging the thing up and that's why a lot of problems marriages and friendships and church relationships fail because you keep digging stuff back up I thought we buried that yeah brother Jack I know I heard she but I thought you forgave me of that why every time I talk to you on the phone you got to bring it back up again you got to throw it in my face again why you keep digging it back up and we plant you know Oral Roberts talked about sowing his seed faith and we put some money into the church so we we want to dig it up all the time well why hasn't this happen and why hasn't that happen why hasn't God blessed me of this stop digging it up oh you plant something in your marriage and all mine you know I'm gonna do something for my wife I'm gonna do something I'm gonna show her that I still got a little bit of romance I'm gonna buy her some flowers for Valentine's Day anybody still do that god bless you brother it's their birthday I'm gonna go out and get her some chocolates so I'm gonna go out and do this so I'm going to I'm going to show her that I can still wine and dine her like I did when I was 18 and thought I was something you say oh we don't we don't do just don't go there brother Nathan we know where the RAM said she's still your sweethearts now don't you go home and tell mommy I said all this no she still gets flowers and chocolates maybe not as frequently as she used to but she still does she's still my sweetheart brother Bram said she should always be your sweetheart said that honeymoon should never die the problem with a lot of marriages is you let the honeymoon die life got too busy the kids got too noisy your priorities got different and now what did you sow into it you can tell sometimes at a church I don't want brother Jackson awful far away from sister Erica for me to preach on this but but he's the pastor so he's up here because of his position but sometimes you see in a message church you see the the you know that those two that used to you couldn't tell you know where his part of the pew stopped and hid her started and they were so they was holding hands in church and when they worship they was worshipping together clasp fingers up in the air thank you Jesus and then you look and there's a Bible case in between them and now his hand goes up during one song and then her song her hand goes up in the next song pastor starts preaching on the women he amends a little ladder starts preaching on the men she amens a little louder then before you know he was gonna be real spirit so he's gonna sit on the front row leave her back there here's many spiritual he's spiritual he's got to be closer to the anointing you wonder why don't get invited out to preach as much as I used to somebody said brother Nathan's just meddling tonight this morning he's metal no come tonight if you want to see Medellin God's good isn't he I mean what are you doing brother Nathan he's trying to beat people I'm trying to encourage you so the right seeds so the right seeds you want to get something out of church put something into it somebody said all my you mister good service the other night I know but it was double overtime now that might mean you pay your job or it might mean you know the Miami Heat or whatever but when the preacher goes into double overtime you're upset but when your favorite team does you're ready to run the aisles shout hallelujah maybe we should just dismiss and go home so the right things so the right things into your children you won't regret it it'll produce real men and women of the next generation take the time for them all we take time for golf and we take time for fur and watch our favorite team we take time to go see our favorite movie and we take time to go do this and go do that and we take time to fellowship with brother so-and-so who's our buddy and we take time to spend with our boss that we're trying to get a promotion from many times the kids sit there and daddy when are you gonna spend time with me when you gonna do so when are you gonna take me and throw a ball what are you gonna do this oh there might be a lot of things that you regret 40 years down the road but spending time with your wife and children I've never seen anybody on their deathbed say I wish I'd spit last time they might say a lot of things but that's not what they say no I wish I'd spent less time reading my Bible you don't hear things like that what did they regret I wish I wish I hadn't been such a workaholic I I hadn't been chained and whatever this was setting sin was so much that I lost out on time with my wife and my children I wish I hadn't worked so much overtime and missed so much Church I wish I had been there when sister so-and-so got the Holy Ghost I wish I'd been there when that crippled brother ran the aisles I wish I had been there so the right things a man we could go on and on but I'll stop let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just asked that you'd help us help us to sew the right things Lord whether to the church to our family our children our life our friends Lord if we don't put anything in we're not going to receive anything out lord help us to sew the right things I pray father help our priorities Lord so many times the pressures of the age the fast pace of the age everything fast and super and incredible and Lord it gets so much pressure and so much time consuming on us that if we're not careful we turn around we realize we forgot to read our Bible today and we forgot to spend time talking to you today and we didn't have time to really talk to our wife at the end of the day and see how her day was and we didn't have time to tuck the children in bed and do devotions with them and and we lose out on so many of these opportunities that we could be sowing Lord sometimes with good intentions Lord sometimes it's just Lord we want to provide for our family or we want to do different things Lord to relax our mind or whatever it be Lord sometimes it's not an evil thing that we're doing but Lord may our priorities be right lord help us to put you at the very first and foremost in center of our life Lord Jesus may nothing become an idol above that father the Lord helped us to sow the right things for the kingdom of God Lord may we not look back in the years to come with regrets of if I had only did this differently if I'd only spent my time more wisely but Lord may we may we cherish every moment Lord Lord some of the most valuable things that we can have is our time Lord that how we spend that Lord we might we might waste money here and there and we might waste different things but Lord if we waste our time we can never get that back help us Lord Jesus to spend it wisely help us to be up and doing things for the kingdom of God things that's going to Lourdes instill the right characteristics and our children and things that's going to be of value to them and things that'll be fond memories that we can look back in years to come and think all by I'm so glad I did this with my wife and my children I'm so glad I took the time so glad I made them a priority Lord but Lord may you always be the main priority in our life we pray may we sew the right things Father in Jesus Christ's name a man and a man let's sing this together this morning all they that wait upon [Music] shall we you there strain all they shall mount up with wings as

preached a sermon on it's an inside job there's things that need to have it on the inside and I believe brother Nathan just kind of picked up on some of that because you know I was even this morning I had a little thought in prayer about a seed if you take a seed and you place it in the ground you have to commit it to the earth you have to commit it to the earth because if you dig it up you'll never get fruit from what you planted a man and the only way you gonna get fruit is you have to leave it on the inside of the earth I mean you got to let the Word of God go to work on the inside and he made a comment a little earlier he says he's thank God that God sovereignty over rise our free moral agency you know many of us might have had some thoughts and I had things that we had planned on doing but this morning God sovereignty through a warning amen of the Spirit is overriding a free moral agency trust that you'll listen to what the Spirit Lord is speaking there's a law and sowing and repeat a man's so so good seeds if you want to see their seats I don't think he left one stone unturned today a man I think every stone was turned and something for us to just look at and just really allow a god just deal with our horse and a man and and and and and I want to say this with him with him not leaving any stones unturned same as sin there is no there is CC in our jail system we put people in jail for so many years for this and so many years for that and so many years for this and so many it's for that we have we classified and put degrees on what's wrong right but when it comes to God staying in sin and unless you get right with God then he'll is open to everybody that would not get right with God hallelujah father we thank you for your word we appreciate the minister s he has come here today to share what you placed in his heart as the Shepherd of the house I know God that you have spoken directly to us as a church father I pray that we would receive what the Spirit of
