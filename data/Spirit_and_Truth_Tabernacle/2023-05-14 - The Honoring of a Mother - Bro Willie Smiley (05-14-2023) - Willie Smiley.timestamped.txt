[47:32] things of God we just appreciate your
[47:35] God this morning we ask that you blessed
[47:38] and anointing and suppression Jesus name
[47:40] amen amen you may be seated
[47:42] uh this morning I'd like to
[47:44] um use as a topic uh the honoring of a
[47:50] mother
[47:51] and um
[47:53] I just kind of
[47:55] been I don't know contemplating I gotta
[47:58] guess a few statements and a a few
[48:02] comments we'll pass and let you out of
[48:04] here but we we want to just try to be
[48:07] encouraging uh we we know just every
[48:11] year this just this time has been a a
[48:14] day that's been set aside for mother
[48:17] since the early 20th century this lady
[48:22] uh Ann I think Jarvis is how you
[48:25] pronounce her name she she kind of
[48:28] fought
[48:30] the government to implement this this
[48:33] day uh
[48:35] because she had I guess uh uh really
[48:40] good mother and thought it would be
[48:43] necessary to kind of bring forth
[48:46] sometimes we know it's historical and
[48:49] very traditional and and
[48:52] commercialized nowadays and I don't have
[48:55] no problem with that though you know the
[48:58] commercialization of it now I don't have
[49:00] no problem because sometimes we we don't
[49:03] hardly call our mothers we don't we
[49:06] don't hardly see them you know we don't
[49:08] hardly do anything for them sometimes
[49:11] folk won't even cut a chance to his
[49:14] mother's day
[49:15] I was I was messing with my my cousin uh
[49:19] on the job the other day me and a
[49:21] preacher friend of mine we was like man
[49:23] you won't take your wife to Service uh
[49:26] on Sunday and I just got declining with
[49:30] him I said might as well because then
[49:31] the preacher could just say Merry
[49:33] Christmas
[49:34] you know happy Easter because that might
[49:37] be the next time you show up
[49:39] and uh he got he caught a little warm
[49:42] with me but I'm his oldest cousin so you
[49:45] know he like come on cool leave me alone
[49:47] but uh you know sometimes that's that's
[49:50] kind of how it is I remember growing up
[49:52] and and a lot of times my my dad and my
[49:56] uncle's they they at that time they
[49:58] weren't Church going guys but when it
[50:00] Mother's Day came around uh they would
[50:04] they would go to church with my
[50:05] grandmother and I I thought that you
[50:07] know that was that was fine they
[50:09] probably needed to do it more often I I
[50:12] thank God this morning that
[50:16] um you know uh with with my children and
[50:19] growing up I had the opportunity that I
[50:21] was converted and I had the opportunity
[50:24] to just be there on a consistent basis
[50:27] right but you know you you have to
[50:30] really appreciate mothers the word
[50:33] mother is one who has begotten
[50:37] right one who has begotten and you know
[50:40] as as I was studying I was thinking how
[50:43] you know really really brought this this
[50:46] this uh sermon could be because there's
[50:50] so many different
[50:51] variables and so many things that that I
[50:55] think you know uh has has to uh be
[51:00] approached and has to be talked about
[51:02] that's just beyond tradition and and
[51:05] things of that nature to try to uh uh
[51:09] just maybe better Society
[51:12] uh as I was studying the prophet he he
[51:16] he
[51:17] in so many years he would take the
[51:21] opportunity to talk about uh mothering
[51:24] and and motherhood to try to really show
[51:27] just really the importance
[51:31] right yeah really show the importance of
[51:35] of of being a mother and what all
[51:38] mothering entails is that right
[51:45] I didn't come to really lecture I'm a
[51:48] preach in a minute I guess but uh
[51:52] it it's a lot that goes along with with
[51:56] mothering and and motherhood one of the
[52:00] outstanding statements he made he said
[52:03] you know uh uh uh and just trying to
[52:07] show the the importance he says um
[52:11] that motherhood is the backbone of a
[52:14] Nation
[52:16] right
[52:18] amen uh it's it's goes beyond just
[52:22] having children
[52:25] we there's a great responsibility that's
[52:29] been given
[52:30] is that right a tremendous tremendous
[52:33] responsibility that's been given and
[52:36] it's something that I don't think you
[52:38] know you want to approach it lightly and
[52:41] it's probably things that's never been
[52:43] been said never been taught things that
[52:46] we probably never really consciously
[52:50] understood
[52:52] is that right growing up you know a lot
[52:55] of times young ladies They Don't Really
[52:58] comprehend
[52:59] uh uh
[53:01] uh the sacred trust that's been given to
[53:03] them
[53:04] right of Womanhood and you know
[53:07] motherhood and things of that nature and
[53:09] and and and having babies and child
[53:12] rearing uh people approach these things
[53:16] haphazardly
[53:18] especially especially in this today's
[53:21] society you you look around and you see
[53:25] a lot of uh uh you know and hey I'm not
[53:29] trying to be critical but it's things
[53:30] that's got to be said unwed unwed
[53:34] mothers and you know a stream a woman
[53:39] with a stream of children with no no
[53:41] headship and things of that nature and
[53:44] and you can tell the approach to the
[53:46] whole thing has been uh in ignorance
[53:52] am I calling you ignorant but the
[53:55] approach to it has been in ignorance and
[53:59] a lack of of real clear understanding
[54:04] huh
[54:08] but but
[54:10] you know there's a responsibility that's
[54:12] been given
[54:14] because see uh when Womanhood is broken
[54:19] motherhood is broken
[54:22] that's when it comes to morals
[54:25] right and we could we could see this
[54:29] morning a real decay
[54:31] in morals
[54:33] if folks think this this stuff is cute
[54:38] well somebody gonna preach with me this
[54:40] morning
[54:41] folk think that this stuff is this stuff
[54:43] is cute
[54:45] but they're failing to see the
[54:47] responsibility
[54:49] that's that's been given and I'm not
[54:51] just talking about young young I'm
[54:53] talking about on every level right
[54:57] you could see the ignorance and where
[55:01] folk fail to understand the
[55:03] responsibility that's been been given to
[55:07] them
[55:08] right to affect a nation of people
[55:12] well I'm starting to feel like preaching
[55:15] this morning
[55:16] amen see
[55:18] when the morals are broken right
[55:22] then it's an indication of where the
[55:25] nation is
[55:28] come on somebody believe me this morning
[55:32] when the morals are broken
[55:36] it shows
[55:41] it show on the walk around with blinders
[55:43] on and not this nation is broken to
[55:46] pieces
[55:48] right because the morals look at just
[55:52] look at the morals
[55:55] right but it it just shows you it just
[55:59] shows you just the lack of understanding
[56:02] this morning brother spotty Gonna Leave
[56:05] You with some understanding is that
[56:08] right glory to God glory to God because
[56:11] you know growing up you know we didn't
[56:13] we didn't hear this this level of of of
[56:16] teaching
[56:19] come on Church
[56:20] you know this morning we probably get a
[56:23] whole lot of things that that's real uh
[56:26] surface
[56:27] but but I I think I think you know as as
[56:32] we we constantly move towards a man uh a
[56:37] change of our bodies in in the
[56:39] generation degeneration of of of of of
[56:43] young ladies coming up and and and
[56:46] mothers coming up I think it's important
[56:49] for them to be actually taught something
[56:52] help help them to understand the
[56:56] responsibility that they've been given
[57:01] right
[57:02] let's imagine something
[57:04] if if if we could if we could you know
[57:08] inject
[57:10] into
[57:11] every mother in America
[57:15] spiritual values
[57:18] right real true spiritual values and and
[57:23] really give give uh a real clear
[57:27] understanding of more morals
[57:31] it would change the fabric of America
[57:36] come on it would change the fabric of
[57:40] America when once we once LED in so many
[57:45] categories
[57:47] as not so much of as a Christian Nation
[57:50] because we've never really been that but
[57:52] you know we would found it kind of on
[57:55] Christianity and principles and and
[57:58] morals and at least you know I know oh
[58:01] oh man
[58:03] but I'm old enough to look back and and
[58:06] see where you know that was a little bit
[58:09] of something something
[58:12] but but you know
[58:14] nowadays you know everywhere you look is
[58:17] is somebody with
[58:19] um
[58:21] have stripped down and back sides out
[58:26] and it it's like bosoms out and it it
[58:29] just shows you uh where we've gone at as
[58:33] as a nation
[58:35] as as a society
[58:39] right oh well we can get deep into this
[58:41] this morning right this Mother's Day I'm
[58:44] gonna spare you just a little bit
[58:47] right right
[58:49] but but you know mother motherhood
[58:53] motherhood is is a
[58:56] is a
[58:57] great responsibility it's it's it's the
[59:02] office is different
[59:04] from being a wife
[59:07] glory to God it's it's definitely
[59:09] different because the way that you
[59:11] interact with your husband you interact
[59:13] with your children differently
[59:17] and you gotta understand the balance in
[59:20] all of that
[59:21] come on
[59:22] come on
[59:24] come on because you're choosing ain't
[59:26] your husband and your husband ain't your
[59:28] children
[59:29] somebody gonna preach with me up in here
[59:31] this morning
[59:33] right and and you never put your
[59:36] children on the same
[59:38] level
[59:40] because it's different
[59:42] it's it's different it's definitely
[59:45] different
[59:46] come on somebody say preach brother
[59:48] somebody
[59:49] come on y'all ain't heard me in a while
[59:52] so I might we're gonna preach y'all
[59:55] gonna have to bear with me two Sundays
[59:57] in a row because brother Jack gone y'all
[59:59] get brother Jack when he come back
[1:00:03] huh
[1:00:04] but but it's truth being being
[1:00:07] a mother uh uh is a great responsibility
[1:00:13] that that that's been been uh afforded
[1:00:17] to by the grace of God and and
[1:00:21] it's something that you can't take
[1:00:22] lightly
[1:00:24] and and I want to say this for the young
[1:00:26] people I'm kind of move back and forward
[1:00:29] you have to appreciate uh a good mother
[1:00:35] you know the Bible says for us to honor
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:41] to honor and that's to demonstrate high
[1:00:45] respect
[1:00:47] or praise the Lord
[1:00:49] demonstrate high respect
[1:00:53] or great esteem
[1:00:57] for someone by honoring another you are
[1:01:01] saying you see Great Value in them
[1:01:05] that's real powerful
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:08] y'all get that young people
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:14] to demonstrate High because we don't got
[1:01:17] away from that
[1:01:19] yeah right in in this Society where
[1:01:22] where morals is broken down and right
[1:01:25] has become wrong and wrong it's become
[1:01:28] right like I say you know at as soon to
[1:01:31] be 61 things have changed it used to be
[1:01:34] when I was a Youngster you ain't you
[1:01:36] ain't sitting in the living room and and
[1:01:38] and and being Grown Folk and you ain't
[1:01:41] talk back and you ain't if you have
[1:01:44] something to say you said it lower in
[1:01:46] your in your room somewhere
[1:01:48] and if your parents heard you you like
[1:01:52] what you say nothing
[1:01:56] y'all a lot of priests with me
[1:02:00] yeah I love the priests with me my
[1:02:01] mother my mother uh my mother if you
[1:02:04] know my mother
[1:02:06] she tries to be poised and sophisticated
[1:02:09] and and uh show show character and she
[1:02:13] I'll tell you what my mom really
[1:02:15] actually she raised I was thinking on my
[1:02:17] drive to church this morning I say man I
[1:02:19] was raised right we lived in a nice four
[1:02:22] bedroom two bedroom house we we always
[1:02:25] had a nice car one of the nice houses
[1:02:28] one of the nice yards on the
[1:02:29] neighborhood I mean we dressed nice we
[1:02:33] we went places she took us places and
[1:02:35] things of that nature we just made crazy
[1:02:38] choices
[1:02:40] right it wasn't it wasn't that that she
[1:02:44] misunderstood her responsibility because
[1:02:47] she understood her responsibility
[1:02:50] it's just that it's just that being
[1:02:53] being young and immature we didn't
[1:02:55] understand
[1:02:57] right as being 12 13 14 15 16 17. we
[1:03:02] just select understanding and I'm quite
[1:03:05] sure in here this morning we got young
[1:03:07] folk that just look just lack
[1:03:10] understanding of what real motherhood
[1:03:14] and parenting is really all about
[1:03:17] yeah now I got six children I know what
[1:03:19] I'm talking about
[1:03:20] imma lead them out of this
[1:03:23] but uh you know I I kind of have a an
[1:03:26] idea
[1:03:28] and and you realize you know and I can
[1:03:30] speak by experience that I didn't I
[1:03:33] didn't understand
[1:03:34] uh my mother's role
[1:03:38] come on I thought my mom was mean
[1:03:43] I thought my mom didn't love me but I
[1:03:46] but as I got older and I got mature I
[1:03:49] realized she was being a mother
[1:03:53] she she was being responsible
[1:03:57] right it had nothing to do with with you
[1:04:02] know uh the thoughts of society
[1:04:06] right it it it it everything had to do
[1:04:09] with my well-being and her being
[1:04:13] responsible
[1:04:15] amen uh uh in her role as a mother
[1:04:22] because she was a wife and she was a
[1:04:24] mother and she had to navigate
[1:04:28] between those two roles and sometimes
[1:04:31] you know that gets difficult
[1:04:34] somebody ought to talk to me
[1:04:36] this ain't foreign this ain't even deep
[1:04:39] right right
[1:04:40] and and I'll say this for you young
[1:04:43] sisters That's not married you got to do
[1:04:46] a lot of navigating
[1:04:48] come on somebody some old sister start
[1:04:50] to work with me this morning
[1:04:53] come on come on because maybe the
[1:04:56] younger generation don't know what I'm
[1:04:57] preaching this morning
[1:04:59] right you you got to do a lot of side
[1:05:03] stepping and navigating but to
[1:05:07] right
[1:05:08] come on
[1:05:10] because it's it's so much going on and
[1:05:13] there's a devil in the midst of all of
[1:05:15] us
[1:05:18] to try to break up the Oneness
[1:05:22] right to spoil a picture
[1:05:26] Oh Glory to God
[1:05:28] and so you know as a mother you got to
[1:05:31] be prayerful
[1:05:32] right amen uh uh you gotta be something
[1:05:37] that struck me one day just thinking
[1:05:38] about the subject you know God impressed
[1:05:42] it in my heart you got to be discerning
[1:05:46] right you got to be Discerning as a
[1:05:49] mother
[1:05:51] glory to God young Sisters You Gotta you
[1:05:54] know the rose is different you kind of
[1:05:57] got to be on skates
[1:05:59] but but
[1:06:02] you you you gotta you know sometimes
[1:06:04] stand in the middle
[1:06:07] and battle on both sides
[1:06:10] y'all want to preach with me that's a
[1:06:12] mother
[1:06:15] that's a mother
[1:06:17] glory to God be be discerning right be
[1:06:24] be Discerning because you you gotta you
[1:06:27] gotta head and then you got children
[1:06:30] right and and you you got to be
[1:06:33] Discerning of him and and you got to be
[1:06:36] Discerning of them and you got to be
[1:06:38] Discerning of that devil
[1:06:41] come on
[1:06:43] come on that's that's real real real
[1:06:45] mother
[1:06:46] listen listen if if you're you're going
[1:06:49] to go back to uh and I'm not you know I
[1:06:52] want to be here all day but if you
[1:06:54] really go back to uh proverbs 31 this
[1:06:58] King uh I guess you pronounced his name
[1:07:01] Lyman something like that y'all go back
[1:07:03] to the first verse right
[1:07:06] uh um what he was writing was from the
[1:07:12] wisdom that was given to him by his mama
[1:07:16] right not his daddy
[1:07:21] right his mother
[1:07:25] is the one who related to him certain
[1:07:29] things as being a king
[1:07:31] his mother
[1:07:34] somebody who understood you know uh her
[1:07:38] role her responsibility I think it was
[1:07:41] brother Solomon was saying the dog got
[1:07:43] behind him and the first person mama
[1:07:49] that's just how it is
[1:07:52] I think sometimes as far as we get
[1:07:56] I won't say that uh
[1:07:59] how can I put this in a way you know I
[1:08:02] think I think sometimes our role our
[1:08:05] role
[1:08:07] people don't fully grasp
[1:08:11] right if I could say it like that
[1:08:13] especially our children sometimes I
[1:08:15] don't think our children really
[1:08:17] understand uh the role of a father
[1:08:20] sometimes I don't think they understand
[1:08:21] the road either but that's neither here
[1:08:24] nor there but uh it's definitely a
[1:08:28] difference
[1:08:29] and and I'll get to some quotes if I do
[1:08:32] if I don't I don't but I do have a few
[1:08:35] uh uh
[1:08:37] the just just because of motherhood and
[1:08:41] and
[1:08:42] like brother Brandon was making
[1:08:44] reference to
[1:08:45] you know they bear you under here
[1:08:49] there's there's that there's that
[1:08:51] closeness
[1:08:53] automatically from the jump
[1:08:57] right that that a mother have you know I
[1:09:00] remember back when when my children were
[1:09:02] were in the womb my wife used to talk to
[1:09:05] him
[1:09:07] come on
[1:09:09] my wife used to read
[1:09:11] to him
[1:09:13] you know I was automatically at a
[1:09:15] disadvantage when they got here
[1:09:18] you know who I mean let's face it how
[1:09:22] how do you how do you compete with Dad
[1:09:25] she already got his ill
[1:09:31] I mean that because she was expressing
[1:09:35] she was a she was expressing you know uh
[1:09:39] uh a love and a compassion in the womb
[1:09:43] man right
[1:09:46] sometimes we we see genius kids and
[1:09:51] those things come because mothers take
[1:09:54] the the opportunity and mothers let me
[1:09:57] tell you something I think we got a
[1:09:59] pregnant sister up in hitting my own
[1:10:01] anybody else at least one
[1:10:03] you know talk to your baby
[1:10:07] speak to it speak into its life
[1:10:11] you know educated
[1:10:14] come on I think scientifically and I
[1:10:17] don't know how to research but I'm quite
[1:10:19] sure you could find some statistics to
[1:10:22] prove how important these things are a
[1:10:26] man to uh the growth of the child
[1:10:31] from conception
[1:10:34] right you know people often say you know
[1:10:36] my children are smart and and it's it's
[1:10:39] it comes because
[1:10:42] there was a person who
[1:10:46] not fully but had enough understanding
[1:10:49] to realize you know what I'ma start the
[1:10:52] process in the womb
[1:10:55] to to get up to get a jump on it when
[1:10:58] when they come out
[1:11:00] right that that the feeling that you
[1:11:04] know these children I have towards us
[1:11:07] is that right yeah it's it's it's
[1:11:09] important it's Abraham Lincoln we got a
[1:11:13] quote you know he he says you know any
[1:11:17] contributions that I'm giving don't give
[1:11:20] it to me I am what I am because I had a
[1:11:23] good mother
[1:11:25] right amen you know uh I made a lot of
[1:11:30] mistakes coming up y'all know my
[1:11:31] testimony right but but it's because I I
[1:11:37] had good grandparents
[1:11:41] come on grandparents
[1:11:43] I had a good Mama and I had a good
[1:11:46] grandparents right that that I grew up
[1:11:51] around grandmothers
[1:11:54] lose it
[1:11:57] I that that's a touching well when you I
[1:12:00] started talking about my grandma was
[1:12:02] right not my grandmother's my grandmamas
[1:12:05] yeah yeah some of y'all might call them
[1:12:08] Mama dear
[1:12:10] but
[1:12:12] man let me tell you something these
[1:12:15] these people held me up when I could
[1:12:17] hold myself up
[1:12:19] when I was a young man just trying to
[1:12:22] trying to navigate through through life
[1:12:25] and and try to get some sort of
[1:12:27] understanding of who I was I you know
[1:12:30] and when I was at my worst
[1:12:32] and and when uncles and aunts and
[1:12:35] different ones you know would come
[1:12:38] around and rebuke me you know uh for
[1:12:42] being at Grandma house and and she
[1:12:45] taking the time to feed me and and and
[1:12:48] nurture me back to health and everything
[1:12:51] they will get upset but that was just it
[1:12:55] hurt that didn't go nowhere because her
[1:12:57] kids grew up
[1:12:59] right I like something the prophet of
[1:13:02] God said he talks about nature and he
[1:13:04] says he talks about the mother bear
[1:13:07] you know uh when when she wakes up in
[1:13:10] those Cubs you know they kind of pretty
[1:13:13] big and everything and she just get to a
[1:13:15] point after a while she shoot him away
[1:13:18] right but then you know they go into
[1:13:21] hibernation but if she wake up and
[1:13:23] realize that she didn't have no Cubs
[1:13:26] mother is still Lima so she'll go hunt
[1:13:30] them she'll go hunt them you know last
[1:13:33] year's comes down to to nurture them to
[1:13:38] love on them
[1:13:40] to nurture them that's an instinct
[1:13:43] that's something that's placed in in in
[1:13:46] a real good woman that's right amen is
[1:13:51] that right I mean you get some some
[1:13:53] mothers that get demon possessed and you
[1:13:56] know cause them to do all that them
[1:13:58] Spirits
[1:14:00] when you see women taking babies lives
[1:14:03] and all of that that's not them them
[1:14:05] Spirits because there's an instinct
[1:14:08] that's placed in them
[1:14:10] there's things displaced in the mother
[1:14:12] that's not placed in the father
[1:14:15] right there's there's compassions and
[1:14:19] there's different things that's placed
[1:14:20] in a mother that's just not placed in a
[1:14:24] man
[1:14:25] come on we we barely uh I was I was
[1:14:30] eating with some of my family members
[1:14:32] and everything and I just had to laugh
[1:14:35] because you know I remember my dad
[1:14:38] and and us growing up and and and and
[1:14:41] you know my mother was one way and my
[1:14:46] dad was another way especially old
[1:14:47] school dads you know they ain't want you
[1:14:50] washing dishes they didn't want you to
[1:14:52] do this and they didn't want you to do
[1:14:54] that and all of their mind could say I
[1:14:56] don't want him to be gay
[1:15:00] right come on preach with me somebody
[1:15:03] well if it what makes a person that is a
[1:15:07] spirit that gets on them Society Society
[1:15:10] screwed up now
[1:15:12] uh uh uh and it is what it and and we
[1:15:16] really can't change it because it's it's
[1:15:19] under scripture
[1:15:21] come on if you know your Bible as it was
[1:15:25] in the days
[1:15:27] right so it's it's it's a spirit that's
[1:15:30] dominating
[1:15:32] right
[1:15:34] but but you know here's the positive
[1:15:36] thing
[1:15:38] you know when when mothers understand
[1:15:40] their role in their position and what's
[1:15:43] been given to them by God
[1:15:45] right and and their approach to to
[1:15:47] Motherhood and everything it helps to
[1:15:51] offset
[1:15:54] a lot of things
[1:15:56] is that right
[1:15:58] be because they're the first line it's
[1:16:02] it's their job watch watch scripture
[1:16:07] right it it was it was not Moses's Daddy
[1:16:12] right that taught him his purpose
[1:16:16] it was Moses's mother
[1:16:20] come on preach with me somebody y'all
[1:16:23] might not jump over the building but
[1:16:25] y'all gonna be all right it was it was
[1:16:27] Moses's mother
[1:16:30] taught him the precepts in the his his
[1:16:33] real purpose
[1:16:35] right so so you gotta understand this
[1:16:38] young sisters you got a job to do
[1:16:42] yeah right uh I think it it was Paul
[1:16:46] talking to Timothy you know uh uh and he
[1:16:50] went way back because she he had he had
[1:16:53] a real spiritual Grandmama
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:58] amen Paul looked all the way back to his
[1:17:02] grandmother right and prophetically
[1:17:05] spoke to him about a gift that was in
[1:17:08] his life
[1:17:10] come on I thank God that you know my
[1:17:13] grandmothers were were spiritual women
[1:17:16] right one was Pentecostal and one was
[1:17:19] Baptist but they were spiritual prayer
[1:17:23] warriors
[1:17:24] prayer warriors read the Bible didn't
[1:17:27] neither one of them had a 12th grade
[1:17:29] education I doubt if they had an eighth
[1:17:31] grade education
[1:17:33] but they they had enough education that
[1:17:35] they could pick up the the little black
[1:17:38] book
[1:17:41] and read it
[1:17:43] come on somebody
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:47] all right
[1:17:49] a responsibility some of y'all young
[1:17:51] sisters going to get married these
[1:17:54] things are key
[1:17:56] right one of the things I'm realizing
[1:17:59] more and more and more as as I'm mature
[1:18:03] right uh as a servant of God it's
[1:18:07] important that you educate yourself
[1:18:11] in in in areas of family
[1:18:15] sometimes I look back and I get
[1:18:17] frustrated
[1:18:19] I can't because you know you can't get
[1:18:22] blood from Eternal what what ain't in
[1:18:26] the preacher just ain't in a preacher
[1:18:28] and and until certain things is
[1:18:30] quickened to a man he can't present
[1:18:33] these things
[1:18:35] right amen that's a tremendous job amen
[1:18:39] that's been been given to us right and
[1:18:42] and a part of what's been given to us is
[1:18:45] to help us to mature
[1:18:48] help us help help us to see you know
[1:18:52] certain signs and what it takes to
[1:18:55] navigate
[1:18:57] right through this light and get the
[1:19:00] best out of life
[1:19:02] come on somebody
[1:19:04] get get the best out of life so it's
[1:19:07] it's important for you young sisters
[1:19:09] coming up right to to really take the
[1:19:12] time and educate yourself
[1:19:14] Amen on on Womanhood
[1:19:18] and motherhood
[1:19:20] right not just out here being fast and
[1:19:24] all of that that's that's nonsense all
[1:19:25] you're going to do is scar up your life
[1:19:27] with that
[1:19:29] right glory to God and trying to be cute
[1:19:32] and all of this and and and and somebody
[1:19:35] pray with me come finna go left I see it
[1:19:38] now
[1:19:39] yeah
[1:19:40] right but somebody need to just tell you
[1:19:42] because that that like who is that that
[1:19:46] ain't life
[1:19:48] who that was Troy that was Troy was
[1:19:50] saying that that ain't that's not life
[1:19:55] hugging up and slapping up and this and
[1:19:57] that and the other and getting your
[1:19:58] heart broken and that ain't life that
[1:20:01] ain't cute
[1:20:05] either way male or female I know we put
[1:20:08] we put a lot on on the young sisters but
[1:20:10] the same thing in the mail there ain't
[1:20:12] no notches in your belt and all that
[1:20:14] that's a lot of nonsense man you you
[1:20:17] scarred up people people lives and
[1:20:20] everything up and you gotta live with
[1:20:22] that
[1:20:23] you gotta live with that as a man
[1:20:26] you gotta live with these these things
[1:20:29] so you gotta take preventative measures
[1:20:33] to make sure because there's a sacred
[1:20:36] trust that's been given and and and you
[1:20:39] know you you want to grow up and be able
[1:20:41] to impart
[1:20:44] right in part some of y'all young
[1:20:47] sisters you know y'all got daughters and
[1:20:49] you might have some daughters and you
[1:20:52] know you you don't you don't want to
[1:20:54] scar up your life because you don't
[1:20:57] realize those daughters will be affected
[1:21:04] y'all cause you know I don't know you
[1:21:07] know I'm 61 and some a lot of y'all
[1:21:09] young enough to be my children but
[1:21:12] praise the Lord so I might go and just
[1:21:14] tell you what's on my heart because I'm
[1:21:16] I feel like I'm old enough
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:23] because when you do these things you
[1:21:26] don't realize the effects that's eat
[1:21:29] both ways the effects that that these
[1:21:33] things have on you
[1:21:36] whether you you're speaking these things
[1:21:39] or not you don't realize even by having
[1:21:43] a baptism of the Holy Ghost your past
[1:21:46] will have an effect
[1:21:49] Oh Glory
[1:21:52] Oh Glory your past of getting the way of
[1:21:56] of your presence
[1:22:00] is that right
[1:22:01] even though even though you may not want
[1:22:04] it but it will
[1:22:06] I'm a living witness to that
[1:22:10] glory to God sometimes sometimes
[1:22:12] sometimes I know I know sometimes my
[1:22:15] kids think I'm the strangest guy
[1:22:17] but but I'm really not it's just things
[1:22:20] that I choose not to never share with
[1:22:23] them
[1:22:24] uh but I had a pass
[1:22:27] come on
[1:22:29] I I had a pass and I I got a lot of
[1:22:32] scars and I got a lot of hurt and and
[1:22:35] and then also and and trying to raise
[1:22:39] right let's look from different
[1:22:42] different levels you you trying to grow
[1:22:45] up you know and you're trying to raise
[1:22:47] children but but you got scars
[1:22:51] you got hurt you you've been damaged
[1:22:57] right and and and you're trying you're
[1:23:00] trying to keep your children from the
[1:23:01] damage
[1:23:03] and the hurt
[1:23:05] and and you lacking understanding so you
[1:23:09] don't really fully know how to navigate
[1:23:11] y'all ain't gonna get this till you get
[1:23:15] older
[1:23:16] because this right this morning seemed
[1:23:19] to be see to be Greek and don't seem
[1:23:21] like it's a Mother's Day Mother's Day
[1:23:23] Sherman
[1:23:25] come on
[1:23:27] right but like I say it's it's levels to
[1:23:31] it it's it's things that you know you
[1:23:34] sometimes you need to we and I don't
[1:23:36] have time because I'm not the pastor to
[1:23:38] break to break things down
[1:23:41] right
[1:23:42] so so that so that this generation can
[1:23:46] be better than the previous generations
[1:23:51] in 23 years of pastoring that's all I
[1:23:54] fought to do is make every generation
[1:23:58] better
[1:24:00] I've probably been considered a fanatic
[1:24:03] and a crank but but I always knew what I
[1:24:07] was standing on
[1:24:09] right because biblical principles are
[1:24:13] different than natural carnal uh
[1:24:15] principles you want people
[1:24:17] right
[1:24:18] and and church I I just have to say it
[1:24:21] like this I'm a Christian
[1:24:23] and and you know I try to you know be a
[1:24:27] Christian
[1:24:28] and and operate
[1:24:32] Christian views and Christian values we
[1:24:35] make mistakes but uh
[1:24:38] you won't you want every generation to
[1:24:41] be better right
[1:24:43] every parent should you know you won't
[1:24:46] be
[1:24:50] and that's all that's brother Jack watch
[1:24:52] watch brother Jack's heart now I know on
[1:24:55] Sunday on Sunday mornings he preached
[1:24:57] faith and he tried to get you get you
[1:24:59] worked up and get you feeling good about
[1:25:02] yourself so you can go into Monday well
[1:25:05] I don't have that enough services to do
[1:25:06] that for y'all
[1:25:08] I just caught I kind of hit here and
[1:25:10] there you know so I have to I have to
[1:25:13] just kind of give it to you what I give
[1:25:15] it to you you know what I mean if I had
[1:25:17] every week then I could make you feel
[1:25:19] good a little bit some of these Sundays
[1:25:21] right but but you know when you give me
[1:25:25] a day like this and and with our level
[1:25:27] of growth
[1:25:29] and and you know one of the things I'm
[1:25:31] finding out is that it's people watching
[1:25:35] us brother Jack alluded to that a week
[1:25:37] ago it's people watching us from
[1:25:39] everywhere and and and we don't know
[1:25:42] what folks stand in need of
[1:25:45] we don't we don't know what folks are
[1:25:48] feeding on
[1:25:50] sometimes sometimes you know I think we
[1:25:54] take for granted what what we're getting
[1:25:57] fed
[1:25:59] right and so we don't show the kind of
[1:26:02] honor and respect to it
[1:26:06] right we we look at we look at the
[1:26:08] individual and not not comprehending
[1:26:11] what's being said
[1:26:15] right glory to God glory to God
[1:26:18] but but that real real honor
[1:26:21] real honor real respect
[1:26:25] is is what's needed in this generation
[1:26:28] to take us to the next level right
[1:26:34] amen glory to God see if if you can't
[1:26:39] respect and honor right your parents how
[1:26:44] could you ever operate in the purpose of
[1:26:46] God
[1:26:50] priest with me
[1:26:53] see if you don't respect your daddy and
[1:26:57] you don't respect your mother you ain't
[1:26:59] never gonna respect the pastor
[1:27:01] hello
[1:27:02] because these things got to start in the
[1:27:05] home
[1:27:07] right glory to God and so so that's why
[1:27:10] it's important to teach a man children
[1:27:14] respect
[1:27:17] it right
[1:27:19] honor
[1:27:21] that's the Bible say honor if you want
[1:27:24] to live long you honor right right amen
[1:27:29] is you know kids get older and and and
[1:27:32] you know they just start losing respect
[1:27:35] you was Mom and Dad
[1:27:39] then you become man
[1:27:42] what's up man
[1:27:45] bro
[1:27:47] it's like
[1:27:50] really
[1:27:53] I had I had to check one of my boys one
[1:27:55] day I try not to be on them hard but
[1:27:57] just sometimes things just because you
[1:27:59] know it'll go from that to something
[1:28:02] else
[1:28:03] right what's and I don't get on it it
[1:28:07] just become a habit now
[1:28:09] and to me to me it's it's sometimes and
[1:28:13] I try not to read into things but it's
[1:28:15] like I never would have even if my dad
[1:28:18] was still alive what's up man

[1:29:10] have done that if my dad was still
[1:29:11] living today
[1:29:14] bro what's up bro

[1:43:24] well preach with me
[1:43:26] come on
[1:43:28] we we lack
[1:43:30] maturity
[1:43:33] we we lack the level of understanding to
[1:43:36] even be in a relationship
[1:43:43] y'all don't seek your dog on me
[1:43:45] or Justin messenger
[1:43:49] right
[1:43:51] right now this probably only mean that
[1:43:52] to you but it will after a while
[1:43:55] yeah right
[1:43:58] you say why you say I could preach out
[1:44:00] an experience now I'm 60. and and I wish
[1:44:04] I I can't do it over again because they
[1:44:06] say hindsight is 20 20. but I can be
[1:44:10] informative to this generation that's
[1:44:12] coming up
[1:44:14] because because if you go back to the
[1:44:17] Old Testament when they were given the
[1:44:19] laws and different things amen Moses
[1:44:22] said look now you calling you this what
[1:44:24] you teach your children
[1:44:26] even the prophet said in marriage and
[1:44:29] divorce teach your children
[1:44:31] we gotta teach the children
[1:44:34] we gotta teach the young adults
[1:44:38] you say I know I'm educated that's all
[1:44:41] you is
[1:44:43] education education don't Translate
[1:44:47] uh if it's just intellectual what I'm
[1:44:50] trying to preach this morning I'm gonna
[1:44:51] get out of here in a minute
[1:44:52] right because you could be you could be
[1:44:55] ignorant and educated
[1:44:58] as it relates to Life
[1:45:00] come on that's right come on
[1:45:04] you got to grow you gotta mature
[1:45:07] young people you you educate yourself
[1:45:12] young men and young women
[1:45:16] right educate get an understanding of of
[1:45:21] who you are your position the things of
[1:45:23] that nature fatherhood I wish I could do
[1:45:26] it all over again I believe I'll do a
[1:45:28] better job at it
[1:45:30] I try to do the best job I can now
[1:45:33] right
[1:45:34] but but you know uh I believe that we're
[1:45:38] here for such a time as this to to try
[1:45:41] to inform
[1:45:45] right because all we had was a lot of
[1:45:47] infighting
[1:45:49] and see that's why I don't fight now
[1:45:51] Doctrine and religion and what you
[1:45:53] believe you believe what you believe
[1:45:55] right I just stand for what I believe
[1:45:58] and what I understand
[1:46:00] right and and where we understand and
[1:46:03] believe the same thing praise the Lord
[1:46:06] but but when you don't comprehend what I
[1:46:09] comprehend
[1:46:10] then that's between you and your maker
[1:46:12] maybe that just hadn't been your season
[1:46:17] maybe in the next season he'll reveal
[1:46:19] those things to you well well you know
[1:46:23] in this season now we could look at
[1:46:27] things holistically and try to and try
[1:46:30] to educate this Young Generation because
[1:46:33] you know God is still looking at the
[1:46:36] picture
[1:46:38] of Oneness if we understand Redemption
[1:46:42] right we go back to Genesis that first
[1:46:45] family was a Oneness it was in harmony
[1:46:48] is that right glory to God
[1:46:50] glory to God so God is looking at that
[1:46:53] so God has anointed
[1:46:56] God has anointed men of God to bring a
[1:47:00] perspective
[1:47:02] right that goes beyond y'all shouting
[1:47:04] right
[1:47:11] a lot of meetings and didn't know
[1:47:14] nothing when I left y'all talk to me
[1:47:18] you said don't say that brother why not
[1:47:23] we we we want
[1:47:26] for
[1:47:27] nothing to go
[1:47:29] we want for a younger generation to be
[1:47:31] educated
[1:47:32] right
[1:47:35] we want for a younger generation to get
[1:47:37] perspective
[1:47:39] well I ain't married yet
[1:47:41] don't tell me you don't want to be
[1:47:45] huh
[1:47:46] I believe all y'all your sisters will be
[1:47:48] married
[1:47:49] uh that why I believe God anointed a day
[1:47:53] for y'all to be here this morning to
[1:47:55] hear the old crank
[1:48:01] you to educate yourself
[1:48:04] boy y'all cry
[1:48:05] y'all cry my wife always used to tell me
[1:48:08] you start out good and before you get
[1:48:10] finished you don't get an amen nowhere
[1:48:13] [Laughter]
[1:48:17] because it goes see this this goes
[1:48:21] beyond listen this goes beyond just your
[1:48:24] your human emotions and all that this
[1:48:26] this touches the soul when it's not God
[1:48:29] stopped dealing with that Soul everybody
[1:48:31] get quiet preacher K how to get an A by
[1:48:35] a doorway he got a third piece of the
[1:48:37] lights come on lights
[1:48:42] next week I'm gonna have a different
[1:48:43] message it'll be better maybe y'all is
[1:48:46] out next week
[1:48:47] did we this week man this week I had I
[1:48:52] didn't know what I was going to preach
[1:48:53] on
[1:48:54] it's been a minute since I had to be
[1:48:57] well I try to be past 30 I'm different
[1:49:01] I like I have to say I'm not going to
[1:49:03] preach like the young evangelist because
[1:49:05] I'm Not Dead
[1:49:07] right
[1:49:08] but let me get on track for about two
[1:49:11] minutes
[1:49:13] educate yourself Young Generation y'all
[1:49:16] young sisters is not married
[1:49:19] really really do a deep dive pray in
[1:49:22] your Bible
[1:49:24] try to find the resources ask the
[1:49:27] questions you know talk to the pastor
[1:49:30] you know uh to try to to try to get even
[1:49:34] you know if they shouted to get them I
[1:49:37] believe we got a good good man of God
[1:49:38] that's my brother-in-law uh to to take
[1:49:42] the time
[1:49:43] uh to really sit down and give us the
[1:49:46] information
[1:49:48] to help us because listen it's it's it
[1:49:51] goes beyond the cute little white dress
[1:49:53] in the white tub
[1:49:56] somebody you ain't had now well most of
[1:50:00] the time you ain't had no battle
[1:50:01] sometimes people get took out at the
[1:50:03] wedding
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:05] woman realized boy I ain't gonna be able
[1:50:07] to do this boom
[1:50:09] that's just a sense of humor but but you
[1:50:12] ain't normally you ain't fault no you
[1:50:15] ain't fought one devil
[1:50:17] were you up there looking cute and
[1:50:20] walking down and you and and he crying
[1:50:23] saying you walking down with your daddy
[1:50:24] and your little white guy on and he's
[1:50:27] sitting there
[1:50:30] and then next time you know a few years
[1:50:32] down the line he just sitting in the
[1:50:34] corner crying
[1:50:42] y'all talk to me
[1:50:49] I got a quote too now but I'm talking
[1:50:52] about a little fella sitting up in
[1:50:54] church with the children want me to walk
[1:50:55] down for 11. he got a children yeah
[1:51:02] yeah see
[1:51:04] and this I think this is why this is why
[1:51:07] they they're trying to mandate that uh
[1:51:10] uh couples get counseled
[1:51:13] right cause look at look at the divorce
[1:51:17] rate not just in the world
[1:51:22] right and I think at the core of the
[1:51:27] whole thing it's just that people like
[1:51:31] the knowledge
[1:51:33] at the core
[1:51:35] that that that if things were given to
[1:51:39] them and quickened to them it would have
[1:51:42] made a whole lot of difference
[1:51:46] right
[1:51:48] amen because a lot of times people
[1:51:51] people come from different backgrounds
[1:51:53] and and everything you know right well
[1:51:57] well we weren't giving any much of
[1:51:59] anything and what most young men we
[1:52:01] learn we learn from our cousins and we
[1:52:04] learned from our uncles cheating and
[1:52:06] running around and a lot of times even
[1:52:08] in the Pulpit they cheating and running
[1:52:09] around and that's what we learned
[1:52:13] huh that's what we learned these young
[1:52:15] men
[1:52:16] right glory to God Amen we was we wasn't
[1:52:21] given the tools
[1:52:23] right
[1:52:24] so you know I believe I believe that my
[1:52:28] job as long as I'm preaching is to help
[1:52:30] give us the tools
[1:52:32] what's what's what's needed
[1:52:35] right to go to to the different levels
[1:52:39] in our life
[1:52:41] as Christians this real Christianity
[1:52:44] right
[1:52:45] amen real Christianity is what you do
[1:52:48] outside of these doors
