[55:44] our lord is good amen we may take our
[55:47] seed
[55:48] there's none like unto him
[55:50] glory to his name
[55:53] we want to look at uh if you can bring
[55:55] the slice for for us we want to look at
[55:59] my purpose on earth
[56:01] individually
[56:03] why are we here
[56:05] is it to work and make money
[56:09] and just
[56:11] spend the money and die out go to
[56:12] vacations in the places that we love to
[56:14] go
[56:16] is it to marry and raise children
[56:18] and live a good life
[56:20] and die and go out
[56:22] is it to get some positions and fame on
[56:25] this earth
[56:27] and finish and live the good life so
[56:29] called and die and go out
[56:32] but what is the purpose
[56:33] that the good lord have on have for us
[56:36] on this earth
[56:38] why are we here
[56:40] why are you in the family that you are
[56:42] in why were you born in maybe west palm
[56:45] beach or wherever you were born
[56:47] why are you located here
[56:50] why are you sitting on this plastic
[56:51] chair
[56:53] why do you have the address that you
[56:55] have
[56:56] why are you in a job that you have
[56:59] why are you in the family of christ
[57:01] what is the reason that the lord put you
[57:03] here on earth
[57:05] amen
[57:07] this sermon was actually intended for
[57:09] the little ones for the children
[57:11] and i wanted to do some illustrations
[57:13] with it and i wanted to bring some books
[57:15] but i couldn't
[57:16] i'm not ready for that yet so i'll talk
[57:19] to the parents
[57:20] and the children and all of us amen
[57:23] everyone inclusive
[57:24] but god willing in his time we will just
[57:27] focus on the children narrow our eyes on
[57:29] the children and speak something to the
[57:30] children
[57:31] amen
[57:33] so let's look at the first scripture
[57:35] the second slide
[57:37] where were we before we drop here
[57:39] amen
[57:42] ephesians chapter one verse three to six
[57:44] if you want to open your scriptures if
[57:46] you understand we can
[57:48] if we're able to stand less than then as
[57:50] we read the word of the lord
[57:52] amen ephesians 1 3-6
[57:56] and after we read isaiah 49
[57:58] 16
[58:00] blessed be the blessed be god and father
[58:03] of our lord jesus christ who has blessed
[58:05] us with all spiritual blessings in
[58:07] heavenly places in christ
[58:09] according as he has chosen us in him
[58:11] before the foundation of the world that
[58:13] we should be holy and without blame
[58:15] before him in life so now he's unfolding
[58:17] some of the purpose he has for us
[58:19] that the lord chose you before the
[58:20] foundation of the world to be here in
[58:23] this world on this earth
[58:25] and to be holy amen that alone is the
[58:28] same one holy and would i blame before
[58:30] him in life amen so the holiness of god
[58:34] is not something is being forced on you
[58:36] but it's coming out of love
[58:39] it's not because i want to smoke but if
[58:40] i smoke but but someone is going to look
[58:42] at me that i'm not holy so i'm not going
[58:44] to smoke
[58:46] i'm still smoking in my heart if that's
[58:47] my desire
[58:49] but holiness which is come which comes
[58:51] from a pure heart you don't even have
[58:52] the desire to smoke and to drink and to
[58:55] do evil amen
[58:57] verse 5 says having predecessors
[58:59] predestinated us unto adoption of
[59:02] children by jesus christ to himself
[59:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[59:06] will
[59:07] to to the praise of the glory of his
[59:09] grace wearing he has made us accepted in
[59:12] the beloved you may take your seat amen
[59:16] to the praise so the sole intention of
[59:19] the of the lord
[59:20] is for us to manifest his praise
[59:22] to be instrument of his spirit amen to
[59:26] be vessels of priest and honor and grace
[59:28] unto the lord
[59:29] let's
[59:30] go to isaiah 49
[59:32] verse 16
[59:34] isaiah 49 16 the second slide
[59:37] say behold
[59:39] i have grieved thee upon the palms of my
[59:42] hand
[59:43] thy walls are continually before me amen
[59:47] all your life from your from conception
[59:50] from being a seed in your father's voice
[59:53] before then until when you breathe your
[59:55] last breath
[59:57] you are always in the palms of god in
[59:59] the palms of his hands amen
[1:00:01] there's nothing that you go that's it
[1:00:03] thy walls are continually before me you
[1:00:05] are confined
[1:00:06] you can't hide away from the lord
[1:00:08] it's not possible amen
[1:00:11] you can dig down and go whatever fit you
[1:00:14] want to go billions of feet
[1:00:16] you are still naked before the lord amen
[1:00:20] let's look at another scripture here
[1:00:22] is a career verse
[1:00:24] three
[1:00:27] sorry
[1:00:27] sir career verse sorry chapter three
[1:00:29] verse one to eight
[1:00:31] now before
[1:00:32] you can achieve the purpose of god on
[1:00:35] earth
[1:00:36] you have to go through a transition
[1:00:38] and you want to look at those
[1:00:39] transitions the career was born was
[1:00:41] ordained a priest
[1:00:43] for the lord
[1:00:44] but then before he became a priest
[1:00:47] there was somebody objecting to his
[1:00:48] priesthood
[1:00:49] and want to find out and he needed to
[1:00:51] overcome he couldn't overcome by himself
[1:00:53] but there has to be a messenger from
[1:00:55] heaven
[1:00:56] to help zakaria overcome that
[1:00:59] opposition
[1:01:00] so that he could manifest
[1:01:02] the purpose god has for him on earth and
[1:01:05] so is every one of us before you can
[1:01:07] achieve the sole purpose of god in your
[1:01:10] life you need to be born again amen
[1:01:13] and look at the type
[1:01:15] verse one and he showed me joshua the
[1:01:17] high priest standing before the angel of
[1:01:19] the lord
[1:01:20] and satan standing at his right hand to
[1:01:23] resist him
[1:01:24] and the lord said unto satan the lord
[1:01:26] rebuked thee o satan even the lord
[1:01:30] that has chosen jerusalem rebuke thee
[1:01:32] what is jerusalem god city of peace
[1:01:36] it's not this brand plucked out of the
[1:01:38] fire it means joshua came from the
[1:01:40] pillar of fire and every one of you came
[1:01:42] from the pillar of fire which is the
[1:01:44] mind of jesus christ amen
[1:01:47] now joshua was clothed with filthy
[1:01:49] garments and stood before the angel what
[1:01:51] is the filthy garment the old breath
[1:01:55] breathed through the canal realm which
[1:01:58] made you a sinner which made her sinners
[1:02:01] and he and verse 4 and he answered and
[1:02:03] speak unto those that stood before him
[1:02:04] saying take away the fifth garment from
[1:02:06] him
[1:02:07] and unto him he said behold i have
[1:02:09] caused thine iniquity to pass from thee
[1:02:12] and i will clothe thee with change of
[1:02:13] remnant
[1:02:15] what is the change of ramen the holy
[1:02:16] ghost baptism
[1:02:18] the new breath that will put you in the
[1:02:20] perfect will of god amen
[1:02:22] until a person is born again
[1:02:25] you cannot do god's prayer at all
[1:02:27] you can try with your mind but it's not
[1:02:29] going to bring the perfect will of god
[1:02:32] amen but when you are born of the lord
[1:02:35] then the life that is in you is no
[1:02:37] longer your life but it's jesus christ
[1:02:39] working his life and living his life in
[1:02:41] your life in your hearts amen
[1:02:44] verse five
[1:02:45] and i said let them set a fair meter
[1:02:48] upon his head
[1:02:49] so they set a fair meter upon his head
[1:02:51] and clothe him and clothe him with
[1:02:53] garments and the angel of the law still
[1:02:54] by what is the feminist
[1:02:56] it's a hebrew word if you go to the
[1:02:57] hebrew original readings
[1:03:00] miss nibbet something wrote around the
[1:03:02] head the turban or the headdress of a
[1:03:05] high priest which is a priesthood
[1:03:07] covenant amen now if you go to the east
[1:03:10] if you go to let's say india and
[1:03:11] pakistan pakistan shop
[1:03:13] you see the pakistanis and indians they
[1:03:14] have a table like a headgear
[1:03:17] around their head now that is a covenant
[1:03:19] that is a they have a cast originally
[1:03:21] they have a cast system pre-shoot a cast
[1:03:24] they have their business cast they have
[1:03:26] uh the lowest their cleanest now so the
[1:03:28] priesthood used to wear that turbine to
[1:03:31] show that they are from a royal family
[1:03:33] amen and the natural types the spiritual
[1:03:36] the bible is an eastern gospel and most
[1:03:38] of the cultures or all the cultures come
[1:03:40] from the east
[1:03:41] so the turbine signified the token and
[1:03:45] what is the turbine today is it the
[1:03:46] turbine that we wear no
[1:03:48] is it the turbine our sisters where no
[1:03:51] is it a is it a what else what what do
[1:03:53] what is the turbine what is that here it
[1:03:56] is the holy ghost baptism
[1:03:58] it is the inner man
[1:04:00] it is a christ in you
[1:04:02] it is the pillar of fire in you that
[1:04:04] sets you apart to be a royal priesthood
[1:04:07] unto the lord and when you walk in
[1:04:10] the angel of the lord singing holy holy
[1:04:12] holy unto the lord
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:15] the flesh of brother solomon johnson is
[1:04:18] not the same as the flesh of brother
[1:04:19] solomon johnson before he was born again
[1:04:22] when you are born again even the atoms
[1:04:24] of your flesh the pillar of fire has to
[1:04:27] recreate it
[1:04:28] rearrange it so that he can live in it
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:32] in the natural sometimes you buy a house
[1:04:34] the house is gorgeous your dream house
[1:04:36] but you go in there there's no certain
[1:04:37] things are not the way you want it so
[1:04:39] what do you do you refurbish your house
[1:04:41] is that right pull certain things down
[1:04:43] and create
[1:04:44] if a human being is wise enough to
[1:04:46] refurbish his house how much more did
[1:04:48] the creator amen
[1:04:50] how much more greeted tenna
[1:04:52] he want to live live in your flesh and
[1:04:54] my flesh
[1:04:55] and through the sex birth we were
[1:04:58] deviant amen we were away from his his
[1:05:01] covenant we were not in the in the mode
[1:05:03] that he could live in us so he had to
[1:05:05] consume he just doesn't refurbish he has
[1:05:08] to consume the old person the soul that
[1:05:11] didn't come from god and now he creates
[1:05:13] nature the soul is the nature of the
[1:05:14] spirit is the control tower amen
[1:05:17] before you were born again there was a
[1:05:18] being that was living in you that tells
[1:05:20] you to drink alcohol to smoke marijuana
[1:05:24] to take cocaine push cocaine into your
[1:05:26] veins
[1:05:27] and that was a control tower but then
[1:05:29] there's a time that the true owner of
[1:05:31] the house decided to swap
[1:05:33] ownership amen and he has to he doesn't
[1:05:36] just eject the one that was previously
[1:05:38] living there but it consumes him and
[1:05:40] destroys his kingdom
[1:05:42] amen because the kingdom of god
[1:05:45] is greater than the kingdom of this
[1:05:46] world
[1:05:47] the kingdom of this world can just go so
[1:05:49] far but the kingdom of god is returner
[1:05:52] amen so when the true owner of the house
[1:05:54] decide to take
[1:05:56] to use his house then he comes in and
[1:05:58] does the redemption work and his
[1:06:00] consumption amen consumption means to be
[1:06:03] done away then he create himself in you
[1:06:07] and when you are working you are no
[1:06:08] longer the same person you used to be
[1:06:10] you become a two-fold person you still
[1:06:12] have your human being a man this
[1:06:15] addiction is she's always been addiction
[1:06:17] but when she was one again she changed
[1:06:19] form
[1:06:21] heaven began to speak into her
[1:06:23] she saw another dimension
[1:06:26] that is walking in her
[1:06:27] that sing songs that praise the lord
[1:06:30] that loves to hear the word of the lord
[1:06:31] that
[1:06:33] that causes to raise her children in the
[1:06:35] fear of the lord
[1:06:36] and that is the holy ghost the christ
[1:06:38] the eternal being in you amen
[1:06:41] so joshua the high priest let's let's
[1:06:43] continue and verse 6. now joshua is
[1:06:47] ready to fulfill his purpose on earth
[1:06:50] verses says and the angel of the lord
[1:06:51] protested unto unto joshua saying
[1:06:55] that says the lord of hosts
[1:06:56] if thou walk in my ways and if that will
[1:06:59] keep my charge
[1:07:01] then thou shall also judge my house
[1:07:03] and shall also keep my courts
[1:07:05] and i will give the places to walk among
[1:07:07] those among these that stand by
[1:07:10] here now oh joshua the high priest thou
[1:07:13] and i fellows that seed before me for
[1:07:15] they are men wonder that for behold i'll
[1:07:18] bring forth my servant the branch what
[1:07:20] is the branch christ jesus
[1:07:22] now joshua is going to reproduce
[1:07:26] he's not going to produce the old joshua
[1:07:28] but he's going to produce a replica of
[1:07:30] heaven jesus christ in his flesh amen
[1:07:35] glory hallelujah to the lord now let's
[1:07:37] take a a typical example let's go to the
[1:07:39] next verse the next slide
[1:07:45] and let's see how the lord
[1:07:48] take our brokenness
[1:07:50] and transform them into masterpieces
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] now before you were born
[1:07:54] your purpose was already woven
[1:07:58] in you
[1:07:59] your purpose on earth doesn't it begins
[1:08:01] manifesting on earth but the purpose was
[1:08:04] already predestinated before the
[1:08:05] foundation of the world
[1:08:06] whatever gift the lord gave to you
[1:08:08] to be a preacher to be a housewife to be
[1:08:11] a counselor to be a pro
[1:08:14] the one who prophesied to be whatever
[1:08:16] you do to be on the instrument the
[1:08:19] wisdom that our brothers and sisters
[1:08:20] have here the lord put in them they are
[1:08:23] all part of their attribute amen
[1:08:25] not everybody would love to be sitting
[1:08:27] at the computers somebody will have to
[1:08:28] be in the wild life someone will love to
[1:08:30] maybe play basketball
[1:08:32] not everybody we are not the lord didn't
[1:08:34] make us all the same amen but they can
[1:08:36] comfortably happily sit behind the
[1:08:39] instrument and do what they do over here
[1:08:41] over there amen to keep the system going
[1:08:44] so now let's look at esther
[1:08:46] esther was a masterpiece
[1:08:48] in the house of the lord before the
[1:08:49] foundation of the world
[1:08:51] but for esther to manifest
[1:08:53] her purpose on earth
[1:08:55] she needed she needed a contrast
[1:08:57] in other words a background
[1:08:59] and that background was brokenness it
[1:09:02] was actually death
[1:09:04] the lord took both parents
[1:09:06] the bible didn't say how old she was
[1:09:09] but they could probably she was very
[1:09:11] very young when the both parents died
[1:09:13] the bible didn't give her circumstances
[1:09:15] but both parents died and she became an
[1:09:17] orphan
[1:09:19] now let's read esther chapter two
[1:09:24] verse five to seven so now in shushan
[1:09:27] the palace there was a certain jew whose
[1:09:28] name was modikaya the son of jade the
[1:09:31] son of shima the son of kish a
[1:09:33] benjaminite who had been carried away
[1:09:35] from jerusalem jerusalem with the
[1:09:37] captivity which had been carried away
[1:09:39] with
[1:09:40] jaconia king of judah whom
[1:09:42] nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had
[1:09:44] carried away verse seven
[1:09:46] and he brought up hadassah
[1:09:48] is esther
[1:09:49] that is a hebrew name
[1:09:51] estha is i think the name that was given
[1:09:53] because the babylonians call it
[1:09:55] different so he brought up hadassah that
[1:09:58] is esther his uncle's daughter for she
[1:10:00] had neither father nor mother and the
[1:10:02] maid was fair and beautiful whom
[1:10:04] modikaya when her father and mother were
[1:10:07] dead took for his own daughter amen
[1:10:10] now look at esther she was born a
[1:10:12] beautiful lady fair to look upon
[1:10:14] you can your beauty can be a deception
[1:10:16] it can be an instrument of destruction
[1:10:19] it can also be a blessing
[1:10:20] in the house of the lord amen so let's
[1:10:23] see how esther used her beauty not not
[1:10:26] an instrument for the devil but for god
[1:10:29] to be a masterpiece in the house of god
[1:10:32] amen so we find out how esther started
[1:10:35] as a broken vessel and the lord
[1:10:37] transformed her with character with
[1:10:40] praise with fasting under the tutoring
[1:10:42] of her uncle which is her father sorry
[1:10:44] her cousin actually in bloodline but she
[1:10:47] became he became her father amen
[1:10:50] and what the child really said in the
[1:10:53] fear and admonition of the lord
[1:10:55] it's not had a choice
[1:10:57] esther could could have seen herself as
[1:10:59] a victim
[1:11:00] she could have even said that there's no
[1:11:01] god if there's a god how can that god
[1:11:03] take i mean take my parents away esther
[1:11:06] could have
[1:11:07] decided to do whatever she wanted to do
[1:11:09] but she humbled herself and gave her
[1:11:12] heart all out to the lord amen
[1:11:15] she didn't dwell on the past
[1:11:17] she didn't stay in the broken ashes in
[1:11:19] the broken vessel but she saw herself
[1:11:22] that lord you have a purpose for my life
[1:11:25] amen she yielded to the word of the lord
[1:11:27] in the in her father mordecai because
[1:11:30] maybe the parents wouldn't have raised
[1:11:31] the way she was supposed to be raised
[1:11:33] the parents would have spoiled her she
[1:11:35] could have become a sport daughter
[1:11:37] as pop rats but the lord wanted it to be
[1:11:39] something else amen
[1:11:41] so the lord made sure that the prince
[1:11:43] were out of her life
[1:11:44] so that she could be what he wanted her
[1:11:46] to be amen because esther was going to
[1:11:50] be a deliverer esther was going to be a
[1:11:52] kinsman esther was going to be a jesus
[1:11:55] christ esther was going to be a savior
[1:11:58] unto her people amen
[1:12:00] and power without character is what
[1:12:03] is satan power with character is what
[1:12:06] jesus christ
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:09] glory hallelujah to the lord so now here
[1:12:11] we see esther being broken let's go to
[1:12:13] the next slide
[1:12:16] there was a redeemer needed
[1:12:18] now over the years the lord has been
[1:12:20] bringing the attribute that was already
[1:12:22] in esther through suffering through pain
[1:12:25] through prayers through obedience
[1:12:27] through things that maybe she didn't
[1:12:28] understand
[1:12:29] i don't think esther understood all her
[1:12:31] life
[1:12:32] maybe she never thought she was going to
[1:12:34] be as an immigrant a slave that was
[1:12:36] taken in captivity she was going to be
[1:12:38] the first lady or the queen of the land
[1:12:41] maybe that wasn't in her dream
[1:12:43] maybe her dream was just to be a happy
[1:12:45] girl you know happy daughter maybe get
[1:12:47] married and live a normal life but the
[1:12:50] great eterna has something way beyond
[1:12:52] her little dream life amen
[1:12:55] so there was a time that they needed a
[1:12:57] savior let's read esther chapter four
[1:12:59] verse seven to nine
[1:13:01] and monica told him of all that he had
[1:13:03] happened there was a time that you know
[1:13:05] heyman wanted to all the jews to be
[1:13:07] killed including even esther
[1:13:09] but then the lord turned things around
[1:13:11] so modikaya became the one that the
[1:13:13] brethren was upon her heart but then
[1:13:15] esther was a queen
[1:13:17] and she was living a good life
[1:13:19] but now there was a redemption a
[1:13:21] redeemer needed so let's see
[1:13:23] so monika told him
[1:13:25] and some of the money that he man had
[1:13:27] promised to pay to the king's treasuries
[1:13:29] for the jews to destroy them so mordecai
[1:13:31] has actually put money in treasures
[1:13:33] treasuries that if they kill all the
[1:13:35] jews whoever will agree or will bring
[1:13:38] this to happen make it happen that all
[1:13:40] the jews are exterminated scratched out
[1:13:42] of existence that person will get maybe
[1:13:44] one trillion dollars
[1:13:46] who wouldn't go for that money
[1:13:48] if you have ever in your heart
[1:13:51] because people worship money the love of
[1:13:53] money didn't begin today
[1:13:54] the love for money began years ago right
[1:13:56] in the garden of feeding amen
[1:14:00] also he gave him a copy of the writing
[1:14:02] of the decree that was giving attrition
[1:14:04] to destroy them to show it to esther to
[1:14:06] declare it unto her and to charge her
[1:14:08] that she should go in onto the king and
[1:14:11] make supplication unto him
[1:14:13] and to make requests before him for her
[1:14:14] people
[1:14:16] and her touch came and told esther the
[1:14:18] worst of mordecai again esther speak
[1:14:20] unto her touch and give him commandment
[1:14:22] on to monaca now esther is listening sit
[1:14:24] in a white house so even to see esther
[1:14:27] it's not easy to see us that's where
[1:14:29] uncle went before the white house
[1:14:31] strip his clothes out that all your
[1:14:33] people are going to die and if you think
[1:14:36] you are the queen you are also an
[1:14:38] immigrant you're also a jewish
[1:14:40] so when it times
[1:14:42] it comes time for the jewish to be
[1:14:43] exterminated you're going to be one of
[1:14:45] them so you are the person of power you
[1:14:48] need to do something amen
[1:14:50] glory hallelujah
[1:14:52] let's go to the next slide essa chapter
[1:14:54] five one two three now esther has had
[1:14:57] fever before the king
[1:14:59] when the lord put you in a situation of
[1:15:00] blessing
[1:15:01] it's not for you to be selfish but it's
[1:15:03] for you to see
[1:15:05] what can i do to help mankind
[1:15:07] what i what can i do to help those
[1:15:09] beneath me those who don't have that
[1:15:11] power those who are less privileged
[1:15:13] many a time when human beings get power
[1:15:17] and money and resources they become
[1:15:19] selfish they build a wall around
[1:15:21] themselves
[1:15:22] it's me mine and myself
[1:15:25] they don't care about anybody else
[1:15:27] be it politicians be religious leaders
[1:15:30] that is what they want but if you have
[1:15:31] christ in your heart
[1:15:33] jesus christ
[1:15:35] he was the all in all
[1:15:37] he had
[1:15:38] millions or thousands of angels around
[1:15:40] him
[1:15:42] but he left that
[1:15:43] place of joy
[1:15:45] place of blessing
[1:15:47] place of throne of glory
[1:15:49] and took on mortar flesh
[1:15:51] to die that you and i will not perish
[1:15:54] amen that is the mind of christ and
[1:15:57] anyone that has got the man of christ
[1:15:58] you have the same mind amen you want to
[1:16:01] live for people eternal life is what
[1:16:03] living for others
[1:16:05] eternal life is not amassing all the
[1:16:06] world on the planet into your pocket
[1:16:08] into your bank
[1:16:10] and then see people suffering amen
[1:16:12] brotherly love is not when seeing your
[1:16:14] brother or your sister go poor when you
[1:16:16] can help them and you don't help them
[1:16:18] and even you case them that oh they are
[1:16:20] not hard working they are they are under
[1:16:22] case they are they are not they are not
[1:16:23] living their life that's why god is not
[1:16:25] blessing them
[1:16:26] not all the fingers are the same amen
[1:16:29] the lord make the this finger may be the
[1:16:31] tallest finger
[1:16:33] the lord made the thumb the thumb can
[1:16:34] touch all the all the other fingers
[1:16:37] i can leave it i don't want to dive it
[1:16:38] but i can go to the fivefold ministry
[1:16:40] amen the pastor is the thumb
[1:16:42] he can touch all the ministry the pastor
[1:16:45] is the prophet when they need to be a
[1:16:47] prophet he's a teacher i want he needs
[1:16:49] to be a teacher he's an evangelist he
[1:16:51] needs to be an evangelist he's an
[1:16:53] apostle when he needs to be an apostle
[1:16:55] amen maybe the evangelist cannot be a
[1:16:57] pastor
[1:16:58] he can just blast the word
[1:17:00] and causing us to stop i know an
[1:17:02] evangelist he speaks and people that are
[1:17:04] smoking weed on the spot
[1:17:06] they throw their weed away and come and
[1:17:08] i want to be in heaven
[1:17:10] he can cut you into pieces
[1:17:12] and then the pastor will take you and
[1:17:14] patch you up amen
[1:17:19] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:17:22] so now back to esther
[1:17:24] now she has got favor with the king
[1:17:28] let's see how esther approached the
[1:17:30] blessing that the lord gave it to her
[1:17:33] esther five one two three now it came to
[1:17:35] pass on the third day
[1:17:37] three is what perfection
[1:17:39] esther put on her apparel now from
[1:17:42] brookiness she's the first lady the
[1:17:44] queen of the land
[1:17:45] and stood in
[1:17:46] and stood in the inner court
[1:17:51] of the king's house over against the
[1:17:53] king's house and the king sat upon his
[1:17:55] royal throne in the royal house over
[1:17:57] against the gate of the house and as i'm
[1:18:00] talking about the esta you put yourself
[1:18:02] in a statue amen
[1:18:04] who is the king king jesus
[1:18:07] we are not talking about the king of
[1:18:08] histories of some 50th century but we
[1:18:10] are talking about king of kings who
[1:18:12] lives in your heart amen
[1:18:15] and it was so very it was so that when
[1:18:16] the king saw esther the queen standing
[1:18:19] in the court
[1:18:20] that she obtained favor and inside and
[1:18:22] the king held out
[1:18:24] held out to esther the golden scepter
[1:18:26] that was in his hands
[1:18:28] so esther drew near and touched
[1:18:31] touched the the top of the scepter then
[1:18:33] said they came unto her what
[1:18:35] what will thou quen esta what is that
[1:18:38] request it shall even be given thee to
[1:18:40] the half of the kingdom
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] what is the half of the kingdom the lord
[1:18:46] has given you a throne
[1:18:48] to rule the earth
[1:18:50] heaven is already for you amen that is
[1:18:53] your inheritance
[1:18:54] and the earth the lord has given you
[1:18:56] given it to you to rule over it
[1:18:59] what you see come to pass
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:02] when you speak your word the way you
[1:19:04] speak is no what it's not the word of a
[1:19:06] man
[1:19:06] if you speak under inspiration your word
[1:19:09] begin to manifest
[1:19:10] you can sit here in west palm beach and
[1:19:13] you speak and things will happen in
[1:19:14] north carolina
[1:19:17] somebody might be sick in india
[1:19:19] in africa in asia in england in france
[1:19:23] and you just see a word of prayer where
[1:19:25] you are sitting in your closet
[1:19:27] and i had a testimony from brother
[1:19:28] solomon about a lady right who had
[1:19:31] gangrene and we prayed and the lord
[1:19:34] healed hey where's the lady located
[1:19:36] please
[1:19:39] pamby we didn't go to palm beach we
[1:19:41] didn't do surgery but prayers that we
[1:19:44] prayed
[1:19:45] was transformed supernaturally to heal
[1:19:47] the lady so she wanted to walk is that
[1:19:48] right now the word that you speak is
[1:19:52] life is here and amen
[1:19:54] and when you speak with the authority of
[1:19:56] christ in you
[1:19:57] it doesn't matter how long
[1:19:59] the word will walk in the dimensions
[1:20:01] it will pick more speed amen and it will
[1:20:04] bring to pass it will come to pass
[1:20:06] so esther has obtained favor before the
[1:20:09] king and now the king is that half of
[1:20:11] the kingdom i'll give it to you
[1:20:12] so let's go further let's go to the next
[1:20:15] slide
[1:20:16] esther chapter eight now esther has
[1:20:18] stepped into the position of a king's
[1:20:20] man's redeemer
[1:20:21] glory to the lord
[1:20:23] is er esther chapter eight verse
[1:20:25] one two four
[1:20:27] on that day
[1:20:28] on that on that day did the king and his
[1:20:30] sorrows gave the house of heaven to the
[1:20:32] jewish enemy unto esther the queen
[1:20:35] the enemy that wanted to kill esther and
[1:20:37] the people his house has been given to
[1:20:40] esther
[1:20:41] and mordecai came before the king for
[1:20:43] for esther had not told what he was for
[1:20:46] esther had not told what he was unto her
[1:20:49] in other words oh sorry for esther had
[1:20:51] told what he was unto her
[1:20:53] the king i think when he married esther
[1:20:55] probably he didn't even know esther was
[1:20:57] an immigrant
[1:20:59] esther was taken into captivity let's
[1:21:01] say he was brought to the united states
[1:21:02] when she was young
[1:21:03] he didn't have an accent so the king
[1:21:05] didn't know that he wasn't born in the
[1:21:06] united states he didn't know he came
[1:21:08] from somewhere in guatemala or somewhere
[1:21:10] in africa or somewhere in india or in
[1:21:12] asia but esther went later on up
[1:21:16] to let the king know that i'm a jewish
[1:21:18] i'm an immigrant and my uncle mordecai
[1:21:21] he's my uncle amen he was the one he's
[1:21:24] my father he's the one who raised me
[1:21:26] some people when they get their personal
[1:21:27] power they don't remember where they
[1:21:29] came from
[1:21:30] they don't remember their parents
[1:21:34] there's a saying in in in my country
[1:21:36] ghana he said when your parents raise
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:39] to to to develop your teeth help them to
[1:21:42] lose their teeth
[1:21:44] it means when your parents help you when
[1:21:46] when baby diapers
[1:21:48] they raise you up
[1:21:50] and now you've got to college you've got
[1:21:52] money
[1:21:53] you've got you can buy whatever car you
[1:21:55] want now your dad and your mom are
[1:21:57] suffering
[1:21:58] they can't even take out themselves
[1:22:00] and you bought
[1:22:02] lamborghini right
[1:22:03] you want all the jaguars that you want
[1:22:06] but you can't even buy
[1:22:08] a mercedes-benz if you won't buy

[1:30:34] esther couldn't have done this on her
[1:30:36] own but the king gave her the scepter
[1:30:39] the authority the power the supreme
[1:30:42] power of the land that whatever esther
[1:30:44] sees you should be written in a book it
[1:30:46] must be implemented it became a law
[1:30:49] the west of esther is as good as the

[1:31:15] type
[1:31:16] the spiritual side of it the lord has
[1:31:18] revealed the seven-fold mysteries
[1:31:21] amen he has put in the 8-day eternity
[1:31:25] itself
[1:31:26] where the lord speaks to you face to
[1:31:27] face amen where the lord did with his
[1:31:30] wife amen
[1:31:31] that's why the lord has removed the
[1:31:32] seventh messenger the messengers have
[1:31:34] finished their work
[1:31:36] they have done what they were supposed
[1:31:37] to do they were the right hand of men
[1:31:39] from paul up to abraham they finished

[1:32:00] decree came the jews had joy and
[1:32:02] gladness a feast and a good day and many
[1:32:05] of the people of their land became jews
[1:32:07] for the fear of the jews fell upon them
[1:32:11] when they see christ in you
[1:32:13] they know that
[1:32:14] brother sullivan johnson has got
[1:32:16] something supernatural about him

[1:33:13] church called opposing kingdom or person
[1:33:16] kingdom baptist church that's quite a
[1:33:17] name there was an old circuit preacher
[1:33:20] the old fashioned baptist preacher came
[1:33:22] through there about every once every two
[1:33:25] weeks two months the people would have a
[1:33:27] little service together they would sing
[1:33:30] some songs but they had preaching every

[1:33:40] the people would raise to give to give
[1:33:42] it
[1:33:42] and the old preacher came by and there

[1:33:50] going to hold down on the on the parents

[1:34:04] and we hone it down let's go to the next
[1:34:07] slide
[1:34:08] uh lamp the lamp and the dove
[1:34:10] that light
[1:34:11] that you see on that picture was hanging
[1:34:13] over my cradle when i was born
[1:34:16] born on a little straw tick and a shark
[1:34:18] pillow my mother was 15 years old my dad
[1:34:20] was 18. five o'clock in the morning they
[1:34:23] didn't have a window in the house had a
[1:34:25] little door i don't know whether you see
[1:34:28] how many of you ever seen one of them
[1:34:30] little like supposed to be like a window
[1:34:32] but it's still a little door you open

[1:34:37] angel of god at five o'clock in the
[1:34:39] morning april 6 1909
[1:34:42] at five o'clock in the morning came
[1:34:43] right
[1:34:45] come right in and stood over that little
[1:34:47] bed where i was laying they didn't know
[1:34:49] my people before me were catholic and so
[1:34:51] there was no catholic churches up there
[1:34:53] so they're taking me over there to a lot
[1:34:55] of baptist church and then i made up my
[1:34:57] first visit to a church the baptist
[1:35:00] church is called opposing kingdom
[1:35:01] baptist church a person king of baptist
[1:35:03] church this that's where i made my first
[1:35:06] visit to a church
[1:35:08] and from when i was just about two years
[1:35:10] old the first machine come from that
[1:35:13] it's come on and on and on and i'm 50
[1:35:16] and i'm 51 years old now see
[1:35:18] is the vision when he told me you were
[1:35:21] born for this for this purpose to pray
[1:35:24] for sick people
[1:35:26] amen you were born for this purpose to
[1:35:30] pray for sick people i said they
[1:35:33] wouldn't believe me he said as moses was
[1:35:35] given two signs you were given two signs
[1:35:37] he said one of them
[1:35:39] one of them just take the hand take the
[1:35:41] paper by the hand and don't
[1:35:43] don't use your thinking
[1:35:45] and it will be told what's wrong amen
[1:35:48] this is a man that was one for a purpose
[1:35:50] on earth
[1:35:52] to bring the greatest healing that's
[1:35:54] ever hit the earth one of his writings
[1:35:56] he said the lord did more than in my
[1:35:58] ministry in sinful city of
[1:36:00] jeffersonville more than a nazirite a
[1:36:03] city of prostitution and i was wondering
[1:36:05] when i was
[1:36:06] young in the message how can the bible
[1:36:09] say the things that jesus did
[1:36:10] even we can't write it if a body is an
[1:36:13] author
[1:36:13] how can this man say that the lord is
[1:36:15] something greater
[1:36:17] and then one day the lord opened the
[1:36:19] revelation to me that it wasn't he it
[1:36:20] was the lord
[1:36:22] who did that in your example amen
[1:36:25] there was this was a man who go to an
[1:36:28] auditorium
[1:36:29] park with thousands of people
[1:36:31] jam with people around
[1:36:33] he prayed and after prayers cancer
[1:36:35] people with breast cancer
[1:36:37] they would have to walk in cancer
[1:36:39] sometimes they have to take him he's
[1:36:40] like i've seen a photo where he was like
[1:36:42] a dead person himself
[1:36:44] all the human strength is almost gone
[1:36:46] and they carry him and his head at the
[1:36:48] back like a dead person
[1:36:50] but he had to find his purpose
[1:36:52] he has to accept the purpose god gave to
[1:36:55] him
[1:36:56] to be able to do that
[1:36:57] and so all of us have got purposes on
[1:36:59] earth
[1:37:00] you have to accept
[1:37:02] your calling and the purpose the lord
[1:37:04] brought you here on earth despite the
[1:37:06] predestination
[1:37:08] it was by choice
[1:37:10] and acceptance or rejection
[1:37:12] you can choose to reject your purpose on
[1:37:14] earth
[1:37:15] and die and go away without fulfilling
[1:37:17] your purpose
[1:37:20] or you can choose to face your purpose
[1:37:22] embrace it
[1:37:24] and accept it no matter the challenges
[1:37:26] that goes with it
[1:37:28] and the lord himself will make a way to
[1:37:29] fulfill our purpose
[1:37:31] amen
[1:37:32] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:37:35] let's go to the next slide
[1:37:41] so

[1:38:12] story came from when i was living in a
[1:38:14] cold country very cold and i was living
[1:38:17] up hills
[1:38:18] so before the snow what i used to do is
[1:38:20] i go
[1:38:21] to the to the to the not a mountain but
[1:38:23] to bottom of the hill and run on top run
[1:38:26] and get the body acclimatized
[1:38:28] because if i'm in the house you can put
[1:38:30] on all the heaters you still full coat
[1:38:32] within you can put all the blankets and
[1:38:34] whatever all the jacket
[1:38:36] you still feel cold because their body
[1:38:38] is not acclimatized to it so i used to
[1:38:39] go out and run
[1:38:40] come back around and come back back and
[1:38:42] forth for their body to get used to it
[1:38:44] and that's what sometimes sportsmen do
[1:38:45] so i saw this lady she was a neighbor
[1:38:49] and five-year-old boy was around this is
[1:38:51] seven lemme see seven
[1:38:53] he said i'm going to take my son to play
[1:38:56] basketball i said what this snow i mean
[1:38:59] it's too cold for the little boy he said
[1:39:00] no he laughs you want to be a basketball
[1:39:02] player no sorry no basketball football
[1:39:04] or baseball one of them and he wants to
[1:39:07] practice
[1:39:08] so he's taking his son
[1:39:10] five year to seven-year-old boy
[1:39:13] to the field
[1:39:14] when me even an adult trying to get my
[1:39:16] body acclimatized i was still at home
[1:39:18] but she was taking a son to go and play
[1:39:21] baseball
[1:39:22] and the lord has a way of giving someone
[1:39:24] to preachers and i said wow look at the
[1:39:26] mother
[1:39:27] in the cold taking the little boy
[1:39:29] dressed up in his baseball clothes going
[1:39:31] to play baseball
[1:39:33] what about we
[1:39:35] sons and daughters of god
[1:39:37] what about the resources your your son
[1:39:39] your daughter is a resource
[1:39:41] god gave to you to raise
[1:39:44] if an earthly mother
[1:39:46] has enough view that son wanted to be a
[1:39:48] baseball player
[1:39:50] she had invested her time
[1:39:52] in the cold season
[1:39:54] when it was snowing to go and play
[1:39:56] baseball to practice baseball as a
[1:39:58] little boy to get him used to it
[1:40:00] how much were you an adult sorry another
[1:40:02] adult you a christian brother christian
[1:40:05] brother
[1:40:06] how much more time we need to invest in
[1:40:07] our children
[1:40:08] to raise them for the purpose god has
[1:40:10] given to them amen
[1:40:12] let them call my little friend say but
[1:40:13] joseph is he around can you come up here
[1:40:16] brother uh
[1:40:18] xavier and brazanda right let me get my
[1:40:21] my three wise men here
[1:40:22] please come up here
[1:40:25] line up here for me
[1:40:28] this is my friends
[1:40:30] i think a couple of weeks ago no no we
[1:40:33] month ago about two three months i think
[1:40:36] my job preached on that sunday and after
[1:40:38] after after service we were
[1:40:39] fellowshipping outside
[1:40:41] and i saw these three wise men sitting
[1:40:43] down and talking and they are my friends
[1:40:45] so but joseph was like seriously like
[1:40:48] somebody thinking of something i said
[1:40:49] brother joe what's going on what are you
[1:40:51] talking about what are you thinking he
[1:40:52] said well we're thinking about what you
[1:40:54] want to do when you grow up so wow
[1:40:56] that's interesting
[1:40:57] what do you want to do when you grow up
[1:40:59] he said i want to be a pastor and uh my
[1:41:02] church would be called is it holy spirit
[1:41:03] of barnacle great
[1:41:05] and i asked her alexander says and how
[1:41:07] about you said i want to be a pastor i
[1:41:09] said wow that's awesome
[1:41:11] then i came to my big brother
[1:41:15] brother xavier i said i want to be a
[1:41:17] deacon that's right
[1:41:19] so now but jesus said at the same time
[1:41:21] but uh
[1:41:22] brother troy and brad jack were talking
[1:41:24] very close he said what happened you
[1:41:26] want to be a deacon go see but a troll
[1:41:28] he's standing right there
[1:41:32] and i was wondering
[1:41:34] so god has something in this children's
[1:41:36] heart
[1:41:37] you can take your seat god bless you
[1:41:40] god has something in your heart
[1:41:42] the seed in them is talking
[1:41:44] now i'll call this time
[1:41:46] they are now called the state of angelic
[1:41:48] age
[1:41:50] they are the time of innocency and let
[1:41:52] me say roughly from birth up to let's
[1:41:54] say 12.
[1:41:55] i'm just using a crude example
[1:41:58] time is different children develop
[1:42:00] somebody can be six years old and they
[1:42:02] are way smart
[1:42:03] than even someone who is 12 years old
[1:42:06] they know what is good and bad
[1:42:08] but let me say the age of innocency is
[1:42:10] from zero
[1:42:11] to childbirth to let's say 12.
[1:42:14] they are innocent the devil cannot do
[1:42:16] much with them you know apart from
[1:42:18] telling not a lot of lies which children
[1:42:20] sometimes do
[1:42:21] but then when jumping let's say 13 14
[1:42:23] 15.
[1:42:25] now
[1:42:27] now things begin to change
[1:42:29] the angelic form of them
[1:42:31] they're going to dry out
[1:42:33] now they have to make choices
[1:42:35] now parents make choices for them
[1:42:36] parents
[1:42:38] i mean give them the dress
[1:42:40] the they have to they have to wait
[1:42:41] for services
[1:42:43] i think if brother jew am i right
[1:42:46] you've got your dress all lined up for
[1:42:48] you
[1:42:48] so mommy just give your dress why you
[1:42:50] choose your dress
[1:42:52] no
[1:42:53] puppy does it for you right would you
[1:42:56] choose your own clothes
[1:42:57] okay little preacher
[1:43:01] no so brother joe is a twister uncle but
[1:43:03] you know a certain age parents will do
[1:43:05] everything for you but they're going to
[1:43:07] get to age where they want to okay i'm
[1:43:08] 18. i've got my id i can drive i want to
[1:43:13] go and live on my own
[1:43:14] i want to go and live with my girlfriend
[1:43:16] my boyfriend
[1:43:18] now the english phone began to fade away
[1:43:20] now so now we need to invest something
[1:43:22] in the children that will help them when
[1:43:24] they get to their form amen
[1:43:26] we have to invest a lot of time t-i-m-e
[1:43:30] time
[1:43:31] seconds
[1:43:33] minutes hours days weeks
[1:43:36] month
[1:43:37] years
[1:43:38] into the children
[1:43:39] real investment
[1:43:41] just like if let's say football uh this
[1:43:44] um what they call it
[1:43:46] i forgot the term
[1:43:48] not the coaches the team those who
[1:43:51] recruit people into basketball what do
[1:43:52] you call them managers right
[1:43:55] recruiters right when they see a talent
[1:43:57] in you that you know how to play
[1:43:58] basketball they'll pay you millions
[1:44:02] from their high school or college
[1:44:03] basketball team now become a
[1:44:05] professional and now they invest in you
[1:44:08] they'll buy whatever you you need they
[1:44:09] will put huge amount
[1:44:11] your let's say 18 year old boy 1920
[1:44:15] started playing basketball
[1:44:17] you started making millions
[1:44:19] is that in your account they're sitting
[1:44:20] there waiting for you so you invest you
[1:44:22] are happy you are motivated to put your
[1:44:24] life your soul into that basketball
[1:44:27] because that's going to be your career
[1:44:28] now we have to adults have to also put
[1:44:31] time and resources
[1:44:33] it doesn't have to be millions but time
[1:44:35] godly time prayers amen let me use
[1:44:38] babies for example
[1:44:40] babies almost in the same food that we
[1:44:41] eat but not in the same form
[1:44:44] you eat the same corn
[1:44:46] the same air uh
[1:44:47] what else rice and vegetables but now
[1:44:51] the babies or the children these have to
[1:44:53] be processed
[1:44:54] into a minute in a way they can take it
[1:44:56] the same
[1:44:57] starch the same wheat the same corn the
[1:45:00] same rice other greens or cereals but
[1:45:03] you have to make it work in a milk form
[1:45:06] cereal like right
[1:45:08] lactogen different version where you can
[1:45:10] add milk that the baby can easily take
[1:45:12] in
[1:45:12] but for you an adult you don't have to
[1:45:14] proceed to that form
[1:45:16] so now after the preacher speak the word
[1:45:18] of the lord
[1:45:19] you have to take the word that has been
[1:45:21] preached
[1:45:22] i said mother i said father when you go
[1:45:23] home
[1:45:24] break it in a way your son or your
[1:45:26] daughter can understand
[1:45:27] don't assume that they necessarily
[1:45:30] understood what was preached here
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:33] their spirit man understand it yes you
[1:45:35] funny understand it
[1:45:37] but they on the human side their mind is
[1:45:40] not developed
[1:45:41] to the capacity where they can catch the
[1:45:43] revelation
[1:45:44] so the preaching can go here and go over
[1:45:46] there
[1:45:48] desperate money if they should die right
[1:45:49] now they have you finally understood
[1:45:52] let me see abram's daughter when abram's
[1:45:54] daughter died at a baby form
[1:45:56] when he went absolute father you have
[1:45:57] been preaching about heaven
[1:45:59] how did the little charon know about
[1:46:01] heaven
[1:46:02] because she had a few funny
[1:46:05] right so you have you found the that's
[1:46:07] why the bible said that a child of god
[1:46:08] the son of god will never get lost it's
[1:46:10] not possible
[1:46:11] let them mess themselves up
[1:46:13] because their names were written the
[1:46:14] lamb book of life
[1:46:16] isaiah 49 16 said you are in the palms
[1:46:19] of my hands
[1:46:21] the children can go as wayward as they
[1:46:23] want to go
[1:46:24] they are not lost but we are talking
[1:46:26] about their manifestation on earth
[1:46:28] achieving their purpose fulfilling their
[1:46:30] mission that the lord has ordained for
[1:46:32] them to fulfill
[1:46:33] so you have to pray with them
[1:46:36] not only praying for them but pray with
[1:46:38] them amen
[1:46:40] does amanda does something that i
[1:46:42] appreciate can i tell it
[1:46:45] i i i was i've been into their home i
[1:46:48] mean so many times and
[1:46:50] there was a couple times that
[1:46:51] i had to take care of the kids
[1:46:53] and before they go to sleep
[1:46:55] she'd go and stand each of them before
[1:46:56] before their room and pray for them
[1:46:59] that's outstanding
[1:47:01] before the kids will go to sleep pray
[1:47:03] for them
[1:47:04] and when the kids do something bad i
[1:47:06] like the way their punishment is you're
[1:47:07] going you're grounded
[1:47:09] and your grounding is good read your
[1:47:10] bible you go listen to messages wow i
[1:47:12] wish i was grounded when i was kid that
[1:47:14] way
[1:47:16] there's no punishment
[1:47:19] just go lie in bed comfortably and read
[1:47:21] bible that's awesome but that is what in
[1:47:24] a form to teach them that don't lie
[1:47:26] don't do this do the right thing
[1:47:29] so you have to soak the word of god into
[1:47:30] their heart just like moses mother did
[1:47:33] amen
[1:47:34] bombard them with the word like left and
[1:47:36] right
[1:47:37] so they'll have no choice but to hear
[1:47:39] the word of the lord
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] you have to read for the scriptures for
[1:47:43] them you have to ask them questions
[1:47:46] that
[1:47:47] what did the preacher say
[1:47:49] let them tell you their version their
[1:47:50] little version of what they understand
[1:47:53] what was the same one today after going
[1:47:54] home ask your children
[1:47:57] what did you hear amen
[1:48:00] xavier what did you hear tell me what
[1:48:01] brother quaker said what did you get out
[1:48:03] of it
[1:48:04] they may not remember the scriptures
[1:48:06] they might not quote the scriptures but
[1:48:07] let them then you quicken their mind
[1:48:10] activate their spiritual mind
[1:48:12] they turn out you know way smarter than
[1:48:14] you think
[1:48:15] amen give them cell phones they can go
[1:48:17] to where pornography is
[1:48:20] the same mind if you turn it around with
[1:48:22] the word of the lord it will put them in
[1:48:23] a spiritual side amen
[1:48:26] if you just certain parents give their
[1:48:28] children let them do whatever they want
[1:48:30] they don't inspect their cell phones
[1:48:32] they're already going to point side
[1:48:35] doing things primary school
[1:48:37] trying because their minds are curious
[1:48:39] they want to lengthen around them but
[1:48:41] then if they get on their negative
[1:48:42] frequency the devil uses them on that
[1:48:45] way if they keep you keep them on their
[1:48:47] positive frequency jesus christ uses
[1:48:49] them in a positive frequency
[1:48:51] that's why ram said that the children
[1:48:53] are not if they are not too small too
[1:48:54] young for the devil to use them then
[1:48:56] they are not too young for that for the
[1:48:58] lord to use them
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:01] if they are not too young for the for
[1:49:02] the devil to manipulate use them to tell
[1:49:04] lies then they are not too young for the
[1:49:06] for jesus christ to use them so you have
[1:49:08] to make them available to jesus christ
[1:49:11] don't just feed them
[1:49:13] don't just buy them nice clothes don't
[1:49:15] just take them to vacation side don't
[1:49:17] just take them to disney they're all
[1:49:18] good if you want to support your
[1:49:20] children even more they have this piece
[1:49:22] x
[1:49:23] where the space you can take your
[1:49:25] children to space if you want
[1:49:26] what's the name i think amazon guy
[1:49:28] what's his name
[1:49:30] what's the name
[1:49:32] what's his name
[1:49:33] jeff bezou and then uh
[1:49:35] this uh this guy
[1:49:37] what's the name elon musk thank you
[1:49:39] thank you you are so
[1:49:41] up to date elon musk they are running
[1:49:43] some space business if you have the
[1:49:44] millions to pay you can take you and
[1:49:46] your children can go to space 11 minutes
[1:49:48] 12 minutes or one hour you come back
[1:49:50] but that will not put jesus christ in
[1:49:52] them
[1:49:54] disney is good yes take them to disney
[1:49:56] but take them to supernatural disney
[1:49:59] like moses mother
[1:50:01] moses mother was always telling
[1:50:03] president of moses moses
[1:50:05] you are a deliverer
[1:50:06] moses had uh was the word haram of women
[1:50:09] around him all the beautiful egyptian
[1:50:11] women moses could have easily become a
[1:50:13] womanizer
[1:50:15] because he had them around them
[1:50:17] you could have become a drunkard you
[1:50:19] could drink whatever you want but their
[1:50:21] mother bombarded moses moses pharaoh is
[1:50:24] paying me to raise you but it's not fair
[1:50:26] it's god who's doing that
[1:50:28] remember you are not an egyptian
[1:50:30] regardless of being the grandson of
[1:50:32] pharaoh you are the next to the throne
[1:50:34] you were born a deliverer when you were
[1:50:36] born the pillar of fire under my own
[1:50:38] eyes came and hung around the window
[1:50:41] where you were born your dad and i saw
[1:50:42] the pill of fire you were born to be a
[1:50:44] prophet you are born to be a deliverer
[1:50:46] moses don't look at the things around
[1:50:48] you but listen to the scroll they didn't
[1:50:50] even have the screw they have jason
[1:50:52] because before music music was the one
[1:50:54] who brought the paper so they even have
[1:50:56] much to read
[1:50:57] but they have inspiration in their heart
[1:51:00] look at abraham he didn't have much
[1:51:03] in sunday school but you are privileged
[1:51:05] under the jacks ministry but a smallish
[1:51:07] ministry but a jerry bader brother troy
[1:51:10] and all the brother solomon all the
[1:51:11] ministers the sisters singing songs of
[1:51:13] zion the atmosphere that is created for
[1:51:16] you
[1:51:16] why on earth do you want to leave this
[1:51:18] atmosphere
[1:51:20] and go and dwell in a place where pigs
[1:51:23] dwell
[1:51:24] how on earth
[1:51:26] when your dad and your mom have invested
[1:51:27] in you
[1:51:28] and you turn around
[1:51:30] and your little high school friend your
[1:51:32] high school uh comrade body tells you
[1:51:35] that if you haven't have sex before
[1:51:37] you're gonna be a fool
[1:51:39] is the devil talking and you as a child
[1:51:42] you as a girl have to stand on your
[1:51:45] ground take your knife take your gun and
[1:51:47] fight because when you get to high
[1:51:49] school they're gonna tell you have you
[1:51:51] had sex before or you're a dumb you
[1:51:53] don't have sex you don't have a
[1:51:54] boyfriend i'm using plain language
[1:51:56] because i never fight with his birth
[1:51:58] finger so i'm fighting with my bare
[1:52:00] fingers
[1:52:01] so permit me to use those languages
[1:52:03] you're going to face those sins in high
[1:52:05] school
[1:52:06] your friends are going to pollute your
[1:52:07] mind
[1:52:08] and i said girl as a boy that i've been
[1:52:10] raised in church are you going to give
[1:52:12] your flesh to the devil or you are going
[1:52:14] to give your flight to jesus christ to
[1:52:16] use
[1:52:16] their choice is yours your father can
[1:52:19] raise your mother can raise you but they
[1:52:21] cannot put you in a in a box
[1:52:24] they're gonna keep you in the house all
[1:52:26] the time
[1:52:27] you're gonna face the world you're going
[1:52:29] to hear things in high school you're
[1:52:31] going to see things even the school
[1:52:33] programs you're going to situations that
[1:52:34] are ungodly but as a son as a daughter
[1:52:37] of god are you going to be like moses
[1:52:39] and esther
[1:52:41] who will stay on your grounds that the
[1:52:43] lord didn't teach me this
[1:52:44] my father and mother didn't teach me
[1:52:46] this i'm going to stay clean to the lord
[1:52:48] gives me my husband or my wife
[1:52:50] that is your choice amen and if you
[1:52:53] choose to go and try cocaine try
[1:52:55] marijuana
[1:52:56] try girls and boys
[1:52:58] you're gonna reap that one as well amen
[1:53:01] because whatever a man does you're gonna
[1:53:03] reap the result
[1:53:04] so if the lord by your grace by grace i
[1:53:06] give you a pastor the word of the lord
[1:53:08] sunday school you hear the word every
[1:53:10] day you can listen to bible
[1:53:13] programs you can listen to the tips
[1:53:15] you've got the word all around you
[1:53:17] parents invest your time to teaching the
[1:53:20] children
[1:53:21] bring them up in the field of the lord i
[1:53:23] remember in the old church i said this
[1:53:24] like every based on your time
[1:53:27] take one child it doesn't matter how
[1:53:28] many children you have don't take them
[1:53:30] the two of them take only one of them
[1:53:32] take them to the field somewhere out by
[1:53:34] themselves
[1:53:35] father and mother or mother or holy
[1:53:37] father
[1:53:38] and ask them
[1:53:39] what is your josiah what is your purpose
[1:53:41] what do you want to do on this earth
[1:53:44] abigail what is your purpose on in life
[1:53:46] observe you what do you want to do
[1:53:49] what is in your heart
[1:53:50] and then find out things that is coming
[1:53:52] from the heart just like my three wise
[1:53:54] men were telling me they want to be
[1:53:55] pastor they want to be dickies now you
[1:53:57] nature and nest that desire upon their
[1:54:00] heart you remind them because when they
[1:54:02] get to high school they might be
[1:54:04] forgotten that they wanted to be a
[1:54:05] pastor
[1:54:06] because they're going to hear another
[1:54:07] language not only from their friends but
[1:54:09] another language is going to speak from
[1:54:10] their body
[1:54:12] hormones and chemicals begin to speak
[1:54:13] through their body why am i going
[1:54:15] through this feeling but do their
[1:54:17] parents have to teach them that it's
[1:54:18] normal you're a human being you give it
[1:54:20] to the lord you need the holy ghost
[1:54:21] baptism to control that feeling you need
[1:54:24] the holy ghost baptism to go through
[1:54:26] your tongue you need the holy ghost
[1:54:27] baptism to keep you away
[1:54:30] to keep in certain diameter
[1:54:32] where the devil will not permeate into
[1:54:33] your life
[1:54:35] and it has to be you have to be done
[1:54:36] constantly talk to the children
[1:54:39] talk to them remind them of their vision
[1:54:41] i wanted to buy notebooks and bring it
[1:54:43] but i'll do it next time so that let the
[1:54:45] children tell you their dreams
[1:54:46] not dream of being engineered
[1:54:48] that is great no dream of being a pilot
[1:54:51] that is awesome no dream of being
[1:54:52] attacked and pharmacists and nurses that
[1:54:54] is great but i'm talking about their
[1:54:56] godly calling in their life just like
[1:54:58] like my little wise men want to be
[1:55:00] pastors and dickens
[1:55:03] i'll be happy if my son or my daughter
[1:55:04] tells me this that's the greatest thing
[1:55:06] even if he doesn't go to school if he
[1:55:08] doesn't get a high grade school sorry
[1:55:10] first grade education and your son or
[1:55:13] your daughter said that mom i want to be
[1:55:15] a woman of god
[1:55:17] that's the greater blessing
[1:55:19] and you the parents have to keep him in
[1:55:21] that path
[1:55:22] that son daughter you remember you
[1:55:24] taught this this is your book this your
[1:55:25] writing
[1:55:26] you said you want to be a woman of god
[1:55:28] you want to be like esther you want to
[1:55:30] be a deliverer you want to be an
[1:55:32] instrument in the hands of the lord you
[1:55:34] want to sing in church that is sick like
[1:55:37] david
[1:55:38] when demons were tormenting saul
[1:55:40] through the administration of songs
[1:55:42] and
[1:55:43] guitar and whatever david could drive
[1:55:45] those demons away from saul
[1:55:48] and saw her deliverance amen
[1:55:50] so because he allowed his life to be
[1:55:52] what to be an instrument of the lord
[1:55:55] jesus christ
[1:55:56] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:55:59] we need to invest time just like mothers
[1:56:01] invest time into baseball
[1:56:03] to help them to make millions because
[1:56:05] the mother knows that when my son become
[1:56:06] a baseball player i'm going to have
[1:56:08] living mansions i'm not going to live in
[1:56:10] this small house i'm going to be living
[1:56:12] big machines i'm going to be popular i'm
[1:56:13] going to be traveling all over the u.s
[1:56:15] and the world with my son playing
[1:56:17] basketball i'm going to get the fans too
[1:56:18] you know
[1:56:21] so if a mother
[1:56:22] can put that time
[1:56:24] into a son into a daughter because i
[1:56:26] don't want to be a basketball player
[1:56:28] women women basketball this is the women
[1:56:29] basketball is going up higher mind is
[1:56:32] money business
[1:56:33] how much more we believe is why don't we
[1:56:36] put even three times the time
[1:56:38] into our children
[1:56:40] that the word of god they will have
[1:56:41] nothing but to be bombarded with octol i
[1:56:44] do succumb no matter how hard the devil
[1:56:46] will try to harden their heart their
[1:56:47] word will succumb them amen
[1:56:50] i want to share testimony let's go to
[1:56:53] the next slide
[1:56:57] i'll keep you long
[1:56:59] when you've done all you could do
[1:57:02] you've taught them their word
[1:57:04] you spend their time with them you've
[1:57:05] helped them to bring their vision out
[1:57:08] you've prayed for them you've fasted for
[1:57:10] them you've cried over them you pray
[1:57:12] wake up night mothers and fathers go lay
[1:57:14] your hands and pray for them because
[1:57:17] you're anointed
[1:57:18] remember by jack you said there was a
[1:57:19] time i was holy ghost for my daughters i
[1:57:22] remember that statement you are there
[1:57:23] holy ghost now
[1:57:25] they hear it but it's not registered
[1:57:27] here so you act as their holy ghost
[1:57:30] when they asleep go to their room
[1:57:32] kneel down lay hands upon them and pray
[1:57:36] and let the people of fire be on them
[1:57:38] without their sleeping in a gun pray
[1:57:40] over them not one day
[1:57:42] make it habitual no matter how tight you
[1:57:44] were in your work mother go lay hands on
[1:57:46] your daughter your son want to be a
[1:57:48] pastor you want to be a deacon lay hands
[1:57:50] on him on her pray for them
[1:57:53] and you see the fruits of what you are
[1:57:54] doing in the future
[1:57:56] but when you've done all you could do
[1:57:58] they have their choice
[1:58:00] you cannot force them to be you
[1:58:03] or to be what meant for them if they
[1:58:05] said well you told me all you told me
[1:58:08] but i just want to get go get a
[1:58:09] boyfriend

[1:58:14] you still love them
[1:58:15] you still believe god for them
[1:58:17] amen of course you're going to take
[1:58:19] certain actions but your hardest stuff
[1:58:21] for them and i'll give you a testimony
[1:58:23] of
[1:58:24] a young man when i was in
[1:58:26] texas
[1:58:27] i think around
[1:58:29] 2012 2014
[1:58:31] a family in from brazil i used to pray
[1:58:33] with them
[1:58:34] and they told me one of the assistant
[1:58:36] son
[1:58:37] was doing drugs and these guys started
[1:58:38] doing drugs at the age of 14.
[1:58:41] that's when he started taking cocaine
[1:58:49] at age of 14 was taking cocaine
[1:58:53] and when our when we were praying for me
[1:58:54] was around 20 something
[1:58:57] and he has been in drugs for years
[1:59:00] so there was a time the doctors said
[1:59:01] that
[1:59:02] even their mother shouldn't come close
[1:59:03] to him because
[1:59:05] he manipulated their mother the mother
[1:59:07] was soft on him and get the money that
[1:59:09] he wanted he'd come up like one clean up
[1:59:12] and then get the money go back to the
[1:59:13] street go do drugs
[1:59:15] and he had diabetes which was affecting
[1:59:17] his body
[1:59:18] he was actually
[1:59:20] almost blind or partially blind so even
[1:59:22] the brazilian government was paying him
[1:59:24] you know blind people to get paid so he
[1:59:25] was getting salary from the government
[1:59:27] because of the blindness
[1:59:28] but he couldn't
[1:59:29] could still couldn't help himself
[1:59:31] still on his drugs on his tracks and we
[1:59:34] prayed for him the parent the family
[1:59:36] been praying
[1:59:37] just about this testimony is about i
[1:59:38] think
[1:59:39] shorter than three months not too long
[1:59:41] ago i went i went for a wedding in san
[1:59:44] antonio and the family i have their
[1:59:46] pictures if you want i'll shoot the
[1:59:48] pictures to you on my phone after the
[1:59:49] same one
[1:59:51] this young man
[1:59:52] god is real
[1:59:54] this human went to a dimension regions
[1:59:56] of the lost remember the story about
[1:59:58] abraham at the job i think 14 when he
[2:00:00] went to hell he screamed for his father
[2:00:02] he was a young boy father wasn't there
[2:00:04] mama mama wasn't there
[2:00:06] there was nobody calling on jesus he
[2:00:08] wasn't a religious person he didn't have
[2:00:09] a pastor but i didn't have a pasta at
[2:00:11] that time
[2:00:12] but this man
[2:00:13] his family his great grandpa sorry yeah
[2:00:15] great grandpa mother you see the message
[2:00:19] the pastor in in brazil is called pastor
[2:00:21] joaquin he just
[2:00:22] went to be with the lord august of last
[2:00:24] year
[2:00:25] and he received a message right after
[2:00:26] abram went to glory around 1967 so this
[2:00:30] man received a message and he spread the
[2:00:32] message in brazil his church was about
[2:00:35] three to five thousand people
[2:00:37] huge it's like a company
[2:00:39] and so he spread the message all around
[2:00:40] so this boy his family are coming from
[2:00:43] the message the word of the lord
[2:00:45] and his parents and aunties uncles they
[2:00:48] are all believers but
[2:00:50] he
[2:00:52] wanted his way with the drugs so he kept
[2:00:54] the drugs
[2:00:56] and when he went to that origin of the
[2:00:57] loss
[2:00:58] he said you did his testing when i have
[2:01:00] it in portuguese
[2:01:01] he came up he came from the from that
[2:01:04] region
[2:01:05] and called his brother younger brother i
[2:01:06] know his younger brother he came to san
[2:01:08] antonio to visit he's an engineer
[2:01:10] engineer in brazil he speaks english
[2:01:12] perfectly
[2:01:13] he said bro
[2:01:14] never dream of going to hell
[2:01:16] is real
[2:01:18] he said i was tormented
[2:01:20] and you mean understand torment
[2:01:22] torturing painful suffering
[2:01:26] he said people the place is horrible
[2:01:28] is that the thing that you don't want
[2:01:29] them to do for do to you they'll do
[2:01:31] today we're cutting my leg
[2:01:33] and he screamed crying and he said i
[2:01:37] want to see but pasadewa king it's a
[2:01:39] pastor your king is not here.
[2:01:42] and he was suffering he said what about
[2:01:43] abraham
[2:01:44] that's what abraham hears about braham
[2:01:46] is not here
[2:01:48] and was in torment torture but the only
[2:01:50] person that could save him
[2:01:52] is who
[2:01:53] the lord jesus christ because that i'll
[2:01:56] be with you
[2:01:57] even in you
[2:01:58] even when you are sinning and in hell
[2:02:00] because even if you go to hell is it
[2:02:02] isaiah chapter 45 verse one to seven
[2:02:06] even wherever you are he will be there
[2:02:07] amen
[2:02:08] even if you go to you make your bed in
[2:02:10] hell
[2:02:11] you are selling the pumps of his hands
[2:02:14] you can go to the bottom of hell
[2:02:16] do drugs
[2:02:17] do whatever you want to do put cocaine
[2:02:19] in your blood put in your brain
[2:02:21] if the seed of god is in you
[2:02:24] they see this in you
[2:02:25] amen you're gonna so find yourself in
[2:02:28] the palms of your sense
[2:02:29] so you went through this torment and
[2:02:31] came back and called his brother he's
[2:02:33] screaming
[2:02:34] and then there was a in the facility
[2:02:36] where he was
[2:02:38] five years he hadn't seen the mother the
[2:02:39] mother only sent money and things
[2:02:41] through
[2:02:43] his brother
[2:02:44] so there was a person there who was he's
[2:02:46] a long-distance anchor but they don't
[2:02:48] even want him to know because he'll
[2:02:50] manipulate anybody he can manipulate to
[2:02:51] get his way to get the money to get a
[2:02:53] drugs so he didn't know that there was
[2:02:55] an anchor who was working there as a
[2:02:57] policeman long-distance uncle and he
[2:02:59] checks on him so he told the anchor that
[2:03:01] i want to go and buy something in town
[2:03:03] can you give me a ride he said yes
[2:03:05] the uncle took him to town he said wait
[2:03:07] for me i want to buy something here the
[2:03:09] guy never one hour two hours three hours
[2:03:11] so he called the pr the mother that hey
[2:03:13] your son
[2:03:15] asked me to give me a ride and for three
[2:03:17] hours i've been waiting i can't find him
[2:03:18] maybe he's going to the streets and said
[2:03:20] no he's here
[2:03:22] he said
[2:03:24] and he said you want to go to church you
[2:03:26] know when you lie
[2:03:27] nobody takes your website nobody takes
[2:03:29] you because you manipulate people they
[2:03:31] come to a time when you are you are
[2:03:32] dying you are on the verge of dying
[2:03:33] people will think you are just trying to
[2:03:35] manipulate so he went home
[2:03:37] and told the auntie that take me to
[2:03:39] church right now
[2:03:40] and they felt like he's just like trying
[2:03:42] to
[2:03:43] have his own way because the world
[2:03:44] suspicious that he does things you know
[2:03:46] and they took him to church
[2:03:48] and he's going to church and i have a
[2:03:50] photo of him when the person was
[2:03:52] preaching he was making notes
[2:03:54] and bow he sat down and praying
[2:03:56] he promised the people that he wanted to
[2:03:58] he has already given his life to the
[2:04:00] lord you want to
[2:04:01] tell to make a youtube
[2:04:03] and give a testimony of what is going
[2:04:05] through hell so that people will stay
[2:04:07] away from
[2:04:08] from drugs
[2:04:10] so the family said they want to surprise
[2:04:12] him they bought a message all the
[2:04:14] messages in in portuguese and they want
[2:04:16] to give it to him as a gift
[2:04:18] because he's now listening to the
[2:04:19] message he can't wait to go to church
[2:04:20] with his grandmother his auntie's his
[2:04:22] mom
[2:04:23] now he's expressing true love
[2:04:26] all along
[2:04:27] that i would deceive him
[2:04:29] for the age of fourteen to the third is
[2:04:31] now thirty-something twenty-six
[2:04:32] something years or fourteen plus years
[2:04:34] the enemy has swept him
[2:04:37] under the carpet blindfolded him
[2:04:39] thinking drag the pleasures of light of
[2:04:41] drugs
[2:04:42] could satisfy his soul
[2:04:44] but he was lucky i was so lucky he was
[2:04:47] protested right
[2:04:48] so he went to that dimension of original
[2:04:50] they lost hell and made it back
[2:04:52] but maybe not everybody will make it
[2:04:54] back
[2:04:55] amen
[2:04:57] and so this day if the lord has given
[2:04:59] the opportunity
[2:05:00] to give your heart to the lord
[2:05:02] to consecrate your life now lord i will
[2:05:05] save you and you alone all the days of
