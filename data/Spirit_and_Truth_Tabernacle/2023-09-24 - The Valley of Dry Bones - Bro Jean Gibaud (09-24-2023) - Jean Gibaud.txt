place of worship the Lord father to God we pray that you just come and meet every need exceed every expectation the Lord father I pray the Lord as I flip back the pages of this word to God that you come down and bring bread with us the Lord and remove me from the scene but use this Temple of mine to God to minister into the needs and desires of your people to God I pray the Lord that you just make this word alive in our hearts father we ask the Lord that you just come and just work a miracle amongst Our Lives of god father we'll be careful to give you the praise and glory that you alone are worthy of and the bride says amen amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord Saints bring one another and say welcome into the house of the Lord amen just so good to be in the house of the Lord r amen can you hear me pretty good all right praise the Lord so good to be here and uh Came Here solo without my family they miss you all very much so they told me to make sure that I extend their greetings so uh when I went to greet them on their behalf so God bless you just certainly get to be back in the house of the Lord won't keep you standing too long turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 37. foreign just a little simple thought that I'd like to kind of I like this particular scripture because it's just so meaningful and so many nuggets that's embedded within there and so we'll just take our time and just let the Lord has have his way with us amen Ezekiel 37. and it reads the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live now God doesn't ask a question unless he knows the answer and I answered all oh Lord God that's wisdom there he didn't try to reason with guys like God you know again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oily Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord now this is interesting right because you have a prophet that God is speaking to and he's telling his Prophet to speak to these dry bones that they may hear well these bones have no ears but somehow they're able to respond to the word of God thus saith the Lord verse 5 thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live now whenever God speaks he speaks with authority and it's affirmative there's no questioning when it comes to God's word he doesn't speak with the degree of doubt in his voice oftentimes we talk and we end our we end our sentences with a question not so with God and so this is very important because I'm trying to bring you I I'll eventually bring you to a point where you see yourself in the scripture so God says unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you will live and I will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord because no man is able to do this so I prophesied as I was commanded and I and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld low the sinews In the Flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then City unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesy as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet in exceedingly great Army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried in Our Hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesying saying to them thus saith the Lord God behold all my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves o my people and brought you up out of your grace and they shall and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that I am the Lord that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated you know oftentimes I kind of Wonder to myself you know if I've ministered on a particular topic or not and I may but just because you had chicken last week doesn't mean that you're not you won't have chicken this week [Music] tasted good last week so I'm sure it's gonna taste good again this week as long as it has the right ingredients the right spices and everything else amen so if you heard it before you said amen don't stop saying amen now because it's still the truth God's word don't change but I love this scripture because there's so meaning that you and I can draw from when it comes to this passage of scripture and albeit it's talking to Israel as a nation but the prophet says the way God deals with Israel as a nation is the way he deals with you and I as individuals and so this message is uh is is enshrouded it's it's it's it encompasses nothing but life and it's really important for us to understand that because we find that in this lesson itself that there is a valley of dry bones and things seems like it was kind of hopeless for this uh for this nation but you know let me take you back to how the creation process began and it's just interesting how kind of things kind of play itself out in Genesis the Bible talks about how God begins his form of creation and this was all God creating and he was uh bringing his form of creation to a sort of Pinnacle and that Pinnacle was the creation of man and so God reached to the point when he lay the foundation of the earth when he created when he brought the seeds together the animals that dwelt therein and so there was one piece that was missing and God wanted that fellowship with man so he began to take a clay off the off the Earth and begin to kind of form it and the Bible talks about how in the forming and the creation process the Bible says in the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and so when God's for men there was really nothing much more to man other than just thus he was just a piece of the Earth and so he was not mobile he was not there was no physical activity within him he couldn't shout the Praises of God he couldn't respond all he was was just a clay object it's like having a car but no no spark it's not like having a car with a full tank of gasoline but there's no spark it's no good to you and so God the Bible says and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and then the Bible says that men became a living soul and so as a result of that he was no longer just an object that just comes and just uh assume a position he's now an object that could respond to his creator he's now an individual that could respond to that creep that which created him and so he became a living soul but the only way that he became a living Soul was because God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the Bible says men became a living soul and the reason why that's important is because there's something to be said about the words of God that when God speak it breathes life to an individual it breathes life into a situation it breathes life into a circumstance Jesus said the words that I speak to you they are Spirit in their life now we're we're The Offspring of God and so we ought to be very careful how we use our words because the same words that Jesus used we can use the same words and we could bring spirit and Life to someone amen all right that's the reason why the Bible says be quick to listen and slow to speak because in your lips as the power of life and death you can say something unknowingly careless about what you're saying and bring death to someone not realizing what you've done but in the same vein you can say something not even realizing what you said and be uplifting to someone that's the reason why we should be very guarded about what we say not only around the world but what we say to one another because in your lips holds the power of life and also the power of death you could go home right now and in any demonic Spirit that's inhabiting the home you have authority in your words to speak life into your home because God has equipped you with the same power to speak life or to speak that you could be troubled in your job I declare unto you Monday morning go to your word and put your feet down and say hi I speak in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and every demon in Hell ought to come into subjection the words that we speak have power it could bring life to someone you don't know what people are going through Saints they can be straggling here and there Holding On by a thread and one word you say could either Make It or Break It that's the reason why we as Sons and Daughters of God always ought to be positive edifying someone lifting their spirits up Elisha was in a situation well he blessed this woman that didn't have a child and as a boy grew up he was in the field with his father and he complained about his head and the father told one of the servants to bring him to his mom and there he died and the mom runs to Elisha and Elisha looked at her as she was making her way to him he said it's all well with you she said all is well it's all wrong with the household all is well let me tell you say she had a dead boy and a home but when the prophet of God said is all wrong with your son her testimony was all is well [Applause] the devil will bring disruption in your life but there's no reason for you to pout and to have a pity party you ought to have a testimony that despite the fact All Is Well with My Soul no matter how difficult situations get and it's gonna get worse but I live I worship a living God I worship a resurrected God I worship with Savior King that when I speak he listens I could declare and not imagine that when I say those words all is well [Applause] [Music] don't let the devil rob you of your testimony you don't judge how you are but how you feel in the body you judge how you are by your promise of God yes man the mother was still with Elisha she explained the situation and Elisha says look I'm gonna send my service he's like you can send the servant but I'm gonna need you to come with me there's a thought that I'm working on called the force of a mother written throughout the scriptures the Unstoppable force of a mother he says he's like you could go kahasa could go but I need you to come with me Elisha fell the Blige and went back to the home close the doors removed any doubt any disbelief come on somebody people might look at you like you're crazy remove every doubt remove every disbelief you're not here to impress one another you hear it to him believe in the word of God I don't know man no explanation my life is predicated on what God has done for me he shut the door behind him he's put everybody away they're the corpse laid emotionless not a heartbeat nothing people would have ridden It Off but when God comes on the scene Saints when God is on the scene he looked at the situation there's nothing too too impossible for God too difficult to observe two two two two unreasonable just believe in the word of God it was Elisha and the boy and there the Bible talks about how he stretched himself over the boy if someone would have Peak then that would have looked unorthodox that would have looked weird that would have looked unnatural yeah but God is not here to show you what's he doesn't go with the way the world goes he doesn't do the things the world does he stretched himself the Bible says eyes with his eyes nose with his nose moths with his mouth hands with his hands and the Bible says the boy his body his chorus began to wax warm that life was pulsating from the prophet unto the boy [Music] and no doubt Elijah must have offered a word of Prayer under the word of prayer too and called upon the name of Jehovah and the boys in the Bible says that the boys needs seven times seven times and the Bible says his eyes were open this defies the laws of a physician who wrote the death certificate just because you got papers on it doesn't mean that God agrees with it I can't tell you how many times I've gone to the doctor and they've looked at this document they've looked at this paperwork they've done this analysis I don't care how good your machine is if God doesn't agree with it then I don't accept it you don't have to agree with everything the devil tells you [Applause] must remember Gene I feel a certain way but that's not the way God tells you amen life was ushered in under that Elisha Ministry you know as I think about the concept of life and how God breathed life into man hi Elisha brought life the Bible talks about and bear with me Saints the Bible talks about in Ephesians the Bible says you hath he quickened and you have to quickened who were dead in trespasses you were dead and trespasses and sin the moment you were born you came into this world speaking lies the odds were stacked against you there was no likelihood that you would be sitting here this morning when people look at your history you did not have the resume of being a child of God you did not have the resemblance of being the child of God you shun every churches you slept in the church you heard one thing and then when when and went on one year it came out the other you barely responded to the Gospel of Truth oh my you had nothing to do with God but God had everything to do with you because God is not going to lose out on his investment I heard the brother pray that we came to church that business with god well God's a businessman and he's invested in you and God is not going to lose out on his investment you are too valuable for God you were dead in sin we were in time past walked according to the courts of this world that was our ways we acted like the world we did things like the world there was no differentiation between you and how the world acted you and how the world looked like you and how the world behave the language was the same let me tell you the moment someone begins to backslid I could tell the reason why the language start to change the language starts to change think about the moment that Adam felt the very first thing the very first thing he said was that we heard you but we was afraid God never taught them that what did that word free come from where did you get that in the language all right right you watched someone before it's like are you gonna make it in the Rapture praise the Lord speak with such confidence and boldness are you a child of God Amen I'm 100 child of God the moment they start skipping around and missing out on church a little bit and start bacheloring a little bit asking the same question and now the response is a little bit different God knows all things what happened to the confidence what happened to the boldness oh God knows all things something's wrong right there in the face of the enemy you got to uphold your testimony don't judge us you're gonna make it on the Rapture how you feel one day and how you feel the next judge how you're gonna make it based on the promises that God has given to you [Music] I remember I became a a steadfast Christian and I was always relying on the elders to kind of make sure that my faith was in check back in the day we didn't have cell phones so when you call somebody and you couldn't get a hold of them naturally for me I was thinking that I don't miss the rapture so I called brother so-and-so and they wouldn't pick up oh I was upset because you would just say you were I was young in my faith I didn't have enough confidence in the word of God to believe in what God has said about me so I had to rely on others when brother so-so didn't pick up his phone because I mean you know someone we didn't have cell phones so he didn't pick up the phone I started question what happened I called another brother so-and-so he didn't pick up his phone by that time two people didn't pick up the phone for sure the Rapture happened you start to pace around and start wondering and finally he called a third brother and it took a while he finally picked up you're so relieved but so upset because it took so long and that's the sweetest voice that you could ever find on the other phone brother I'm so happy you picked up God bless you how are you gonna you don't give praise though you're gonna be interested I'm gonna be in church on Sunday I won't miss church you're gonna be in church he's just so relieved because your faith was based upon that they were around but let me tell you as you mature as a Christian and you know where you stand and you know the promises that God has for you and my faith is not predicated on what you believe it's based upon what God says about me I was a sinner that was saved by grace okay amen amen and thank God for cell phone I could text you too now so I mean when in time pass you walked according to the course of this word according to the prince of the power of the air let me tell you when you look at the ocean the only reason why the ocean is wild up is because of the Winds that causes the ocean to kind of cause emotion the reason why you were the way you were there was a seed that was planted within you before the foundation of the world so when you were born there was a seed that was there there was a germ of life that was there but you were you were shrouded in darkness you were shrouded in darkness and so therefore your behavior was influenced by the by the Demonic Powers within the air and so even though in your mind you said I could never come to terms of accepting the word of God God had different opinions about you that's the reason why I go back to the very beginning in Genesis when the Bible says let there be light it was never a question it was never spoken without doubt but it was spoken with such a a a such Authority and the Bible says the Bible says there was light it came to pass and so the Bible goes on to say among whom also we had our conversations in time past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind felt good we did it if we thought about it we did it and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is Rich not only a god who's merciful but a God who is Rich and mercy amen amen let me tell you we were so far in darkness we were so much into sin the things that we used to do if we were to play back your life half of you would be embarrassed but thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ that when people try to remind you of your past God doesn't even see your past because the blood erases your past removes it all completely and so God brought you to life and Ezekiel where my thought was at the Bible talks about this valley of dry bones we live in a world right now where man is trying to play God man is trying to flee God so ezekiel's looking at this valley of dry bones and we're going to dissect this a little bit and God looks to Ezekiel and see the dead situation and he says can these Dry Bones live and he says Thou knows there is a desire in men to be a creator there's a desire in men to be a creator and so back in the beginning God had told Adam that you should eat only of the Tree of Life but men slipped up and ate off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Stand Together so the tree of knowledge produces some good and it produces some evil and so there is evidence of this we are recipient of this we have been a recipient of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil in the gospel has been intended to bring us back to the Tree of Life while we're reaping the benefits of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil let me help you understand we find that throughout history man has uh man has come up with technological advances bringing them to life we move from the horse and buggy to the car we move from the car to the rocket we have progressed in our understanding all that's been through the through the knowledge of the of Good and Evil that's how you were able to come to church we drove our cars there but we also know what could I the the outcome of such these things it's not until here recently that man says you know what I want to go beyond just the mechanics I want to take this to another level the reason why they're doing that is because they're motivated by a spirit and the prophet says as what we see happening in the world is the same type that's happening in the spirit Realm so there's been a lot of talks which I'm sure many have heard called artificial intelligence it's no stroke of a of coincidence that conversations like this has beginning are beginning to happen in our time and man is trying to tap into a realm where they can say how can we position ourselves and they won't tell you like this they're spinning Every Witch Way but how can we position ourselves to be creators of our own crafts and so therefore they've created they've evolved technology to the point where you have now artificial intelligence and what's artificial intelligence is that it's artificial it's not real but it's a form of intelligence and so they're using that intelligence to create some sort of life that could speak for itself that could think for itself that can do for itself that could replicate itself are we staying together [Music] and so they're looking at these things and they're introducing what is called artificial intelligence they're trying to bring forth artificial life so they're bringing a substitution for something that is real and so at the same time that man is trying to tap into a higher Dimension God is calling a bride and trying to tap her into a higher dimension that's the reason why we're no longer living under just justification you're no longer just Justified that's not good enough to say I'm a Believer being Sanctified is not good enough to say I'm a Believer being baptized of the Holy Ghost that's just not enough you got to be it's you gotta be saturated having the mind of God having the intelligence of God having the understanding of God to separate you from the world are we staying together man is creating his own devices he's creating his own ways and meanwhile God is creating a bride that doesn't think like the world but I think it's just like God that you can walk into a situation and assess it and say this is not Godlike the Bible says shouldn't every appearance of evil it doesn't have to say evil written over it if it just appears like it's the devil the Bible says have nothing to do with it because the Bible says your spirit Bears testimony with his spirit that you are the child of God there's been times that you can walk into a situation and not have a scripture to back it up but you know it's a wrong situation so man is trying to be creators of their own selves and yet God has instilled within you the power of creation through the words that you speak by the spoken word are we staying together so by the Bible says God looks through Ezekiel says can these Dry Bones live they were in the valley and the reason why they were in a valley that means that they were there for a long time that's the reason why they were dry bones they were in between mountaintops they were from one Revival to the next sometimes you feel like you're in a high sometimes you feel like you're in the low and what happened is that between the mountaintops one Sunday you're coming you feel all revived you feel all edified you feel that God has spoken unto you and then the rest of the week you go through the valley you get hit on every side you get bombarded on every side you're faced with family situation job situation Bill situation uh Health situations you name it and you come back to church you're back on the high pastor preached me happy he preaches his best heart out you feel all excited you feel pumped and you get knocked out again on Monday and you go through the cycle again rather than carrying that inspiration throughout the week you lay inside on the Shelf the only scripture that people have often read is the scripture that they hear from the from a sermon that's preached on a Sunday morning that's horrible Saints you ought to know the scriptures throughout the entire week not just what is preached on a Sunday morning or Wednesday night amen you ought to live and breathe this thing so here you are between two mountaintops and there you are in the valley the Bible says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil start with me start writing thy staff to comfort me but what happens is that when we go through this Valley sometimes the the journey up to that Mountaintop gets so burdensed up it's a lot of work that you get tied to go up to that Mountaintop and you fall back and there you are in this Valley you stop worshiping God Like You should you stop praising God like you should you stop being an example like you should and the only thing that people know about you is what they see here in church don't live no higher than what you preach don't live no higher than what you're saying don't live no higher than your testimony because God has a way of finding you out it's easy when we blame in one another here it's easy when we can look at one another say praise the Lord I'm with you sister I'm with you brother but when you're out there that's a different story this is just training ground you don't have to impress me you got to impress God out there in that Valley people get cold because they've been in the journey for so long they go through the motions of the church they come to church they see people praise God they praise God they see people shout they shout they see people holler they holler they see people buy their heads and pray they pretend the body of their heads and they pray was the reality of it all right but God comes across the situation and he looks at it and he sees Ezekiel and he says look look at the valley of these Dry Bones God doesn't leave a situation the way he sees it can these Dry Bones live and he says you know it's Lord and he spoke the words he says prophesy unto these bones prophesy unto these dead bones that has no Flesh on them that can't hear they can't listen but it takes the movement of God to come on the scene and begin to make these bones move and it's no longer that you're motivating yourself it's God that's coming on the scene and creating life where people thought there was no life you know brother bear talks about the story he says you had this one mother who had this boy he was off in a seminary School and he was on for a few days and he got word and he heard that his mother was sick so as it were he made his way back home in a long story short his mother got well and then he looks at his mother said Mom I got your letters and I understood that you weren't feeling too well and that you were sick she's like yeah I was on the Brinks of death but there was a Revival that was going on he says there was a preacher down there that was preaching on healing so I went down there and I began to uh have some uh healing services with that preacher and then she says that he started to quote Mark 16 and off off of that scripture I received my healing and the boy looks at his mom's like Mom I want you to know something I learned in the Seminary he's like we learned that that scripture that that preacher quoted to you has no inspiration it has no life is no power behind it it's not even anointed and the mother looked and she began to shout and she began to praise God she began to holler and the boy says mom what is wrong with you she's like I started to think if that scripture is uninspired and was able to heal this body how much more the inspired word of God what the world doesn't like I take every bit of word of God and bring it into my soul life could become so routine for us it could become so common for us in between high mountains in between scriptures in between revivals can these bones live Apollo bones God saw something that people didn't see so he prophesies I was commanded and I and as I prophesied there was a noise Behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone let me tell you Saints when the word of God was first preached to you there was a Revival that took place you responded a certain way if I lit a fire underneath you you won't sit still I've never been a kitchen where I haven't heard something sizzling and see it just laying there motionless something was happening when God comes on the scene let me tell you when God comes into your life it doesn't cause you just to stand around you react to the promises of God because you envisioned where you see yourself at amen let me tell you when I get to the other side I'm not going to be casual about it every battle that I've gone through every Star that I've gotten every wound that I've endured the last thing I do is when I get to the other side and say thank you Jesus I'm so glad that I made it let me tell you there's not enough excitement that could contain a Believer to know that every battle that you've endured here was for the reason that you made it on the other side [Applause] that you've endured when you have a scar it tells me that whatever that was that tried to get hold of your life you were stronger than that thing amen every time the Devil comes and tries to growl at you like a roaring lion you let the devil know I see that scar but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so God spoke to these bones and these bones begin to come alive let me tell you Saints you are a child of Prophecy before you were born God knew you before you spoke your first word god knew you amen amen when you took a when God took a family picture way back before the foundation of the world you know whenever you took a group picture people just try to make sure that they you could see them you know you kind of catch the little head just want to make sure that they're part of the photo don't worry God sees you know you might be hiding behind somebody God sees you in the picture God sees you God recognize you you have your place in the word of God no one can take your place you are not a substitution you're the original you're unique you're authentic God Made You the Way You Are God didn't make me to be like brother jacked up and he could never be me God made me the way I am don't try to be somebody that you're not supposed to be right don't try to impress somebody that you're not be yourself because that's how God sees you [Applause] God didn't cause you to be nobody but be your unique self the world is trying to conform to a certain place a certain way of thinking a certain way of doing things I'm not here to conform to the world the Bible says be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind when these bones started to come together these bones were scattered across the whole valley if it was me my bone was probably way down there my leg bone was way down there my thigh bone was way down there my shoulder bones were way down there my skull was way down there my neck my knee you name it I was all over [Applause] your life was scattered in a million pieces many of you did have no direction in the sense of life you had no idea if you were coming or going your life was every bit of a confusion but the Bible says God is not the author of confusion [Music] if you don't understand something it's not God it's you take it back to the scripture and God will line it up for you bones were crossed over a pile of bones scattered into probably miles and miles of this Valley and God says to Ezekiel speak these words to these bones they may not have ears but they were listen they may not have ears but they'll respond when you were born into this Earth your life was scattered into a million pieces you try to fit in with this crowd you try to fit in with that crowd you try to act this way talk this way you're trying to put pieces together make sense of the meaning of your life where do you fit in society would he fit within your family would he fit with your friends would he fit within your peer group how does your future look like how does my family look like you try to make sense of all these things and then people tell you go see a psychiatrist go see a therapist let me tell you even they themselves need help amen they're listening to your problems and have problems of themselves let me tell you I'd rather go to a great position that can be touched by the feelings of my affirmities who knows my problems it doesn't have a problem himself [Applause] and when God said we got spoke those words going back to your unique self every bone that was in the far distance came rushing back the the skull bone connected to the neck bone not my skull bone connected to your neck bone it was my neck bone my neck bone connected to my shoulder not his shoulder God's making me unique I am my individual person my shoulder bone connected to my rib bone now your rib bone amen my remote connected to my hip bone now your hip bone God is forming me I'm in the hands of the Potter I'm in the hands of the creator amen my hip bone connected to my leg bone not your leg bone the balls started to come back together from the distance what was God doing he's putting the pieces back together again God was putting to Pieces he's a great surgeon putting the pieces together let me tell you things I don't know if there was pain that was felt but I know there was some shouting the bones were clapping together they were making a lot of noise when God started opening my eyes I started to get excited my bones started to clap together I started to shout I started to holler because I started to see an image of who I was supposed to be beautiful and if he looked at me I was just numbered a skeleton I was not a pretty picture to look at back in my day you would look at me say oh he's one ugly fella that's all right God didn't when God started God will finish the Bible says he that has begun a good work in you will finish it amen I didn't look too attractive I was a messed up boy number please number skeletons but he that started the good work in you what men can see God saw God sees the Finish Line when you say you can't make it God has seen you here already you've already crossed the Finishing Line go back and read the ending of the Bible and then when you're free when you read the ending of the scripture the ending in the Bible don't walk around so sad that's your promise that's your Victory amen the leg bone connected to the anchor bone and they're just bones lay there a formation of different bodies then the Bible says send you upon sinew because God when he does something he does it completely the muscles started to form around the bones creating the muscles let me tell you it's it's a form of pottery I took in our class and you know when we did Art one of the things that we did was we we did pottery and I took this massive piece of clay and we put it in the center of the wheel and you can move the wheel like this if you want and then they have the the one where you could just press with your feet and it just goes and then this this thing you gotta center it got to be right there in the center it's not where God has a good grip on it guy got to get a good grip on your life because you have a tendency of not staying in place the Bible says be still and know that I am God quit trying to solve the problem yourself be still and know that I'm God quit trying to do it yourself be still and know that I am God as a Potter you grab a hold of that clay I'm talking from experience to grab a hold of that clay and the only way that you you don't just let it stay there it has to be emotion it has to be constantly in motion God got to spin you around things look kind of funny you don't know whether you're coming or going and so things might look confusing to you but God is in control of the situation [Applause] and you're just spinning around you're just spinning around and God got a hold of you right there when you think you're gonna fall guys like I got you in all the meanwhile you're spinning around that's how the world's just constantly spinning things at you throwing things at you you're being bombarded with all kinds of things and God says I got control of this and all it is is just a lump of clay doesn't look like anything but God sees a finished product as he's working on it yeah and you know what you know what we do also as we're working with the clay we got to put some water on it we gotta keep it moist so that way it can move it's pliable if it doesn't look the way it needs to look it looks like it's on the right track but it doesn't look sometimes we have to break it up again y'all didn't catch me sometimes it looks like it's looking like something I have to break it up because it's not exactly what what I want it to look like just because someone's going through some hardship doesn't mean that God is done with them he said well he used to walk so circumspectly such like a Christian and now he's all broken up God is redoing him again God is reshaping her again he's still in the hands of the Potter [Music] we take that Potter and it begins to kind of shape it and then we break it down we let it take form and we break it down meanwhile the wheel is still spinning and we're dropping more water we're filling it with more of God's words we're letting them know that God's with you he's giving you some reassurance your life is spinning around you don't have any sense of what's going on you don't feel like you're in control but God's in control that's the reason why people don't like to fly because it's easier to stay behind the steering wheel and be in control of the driver's seat but when you're in the plane 30 000 feet up in the air and you're just sitting there as a passenger and the plane goes dead like this you're all your confidence is in that pilot and it makes you scared because you don't have a steering wheel to grab on and so you have to relinquish give up that trust and trust that that man's experience could take you from point A to point B let me tell you give up your trust on yourself and give it to God and he can take you from point A all the way to point B [Applause] itch and we keep spinning that wheel and then we go in we punch a hole if we're making a vase and it's just a little hole just a small little hole and then we slowly as it spin begin to widen it a little bit widen it and we're controlling how wide this base has to be we're controlling how deep how thick this vase needs to be only when we start to get to that image what we have in our head do we start to slow up a little bit because this vessel is not becoming mature sinew upon seeing you and when that vessel is done the Potter carefully takes out that vessel he looked at that vessel it looks everything that he has in his mind but it's not done yet it's not done yet God went through a lot of work looking for you took a chunk of dirt they said this ain't it thousands of people laid in the days of Jesus by the pool of Bethesda and Jesus waited his way past thousands of people looking for one man seven billion people on planet Earth Saints and God came looking for you that's how special you want to God that's how unique you are to God that God didn't look for someone else he came looking for you when Adam felt God didn't just say hey you where you at God says I am where are you at God knows your name before you were born before your mom or your dad had a name given to you God called you by your name thank you Lord Jesus picked up that clunk of dirt that clay molded he started working with me a little bit he made you cry a little bit he broke you up you left church and came back to church you left church and you came back to church y'all can look at me like I'm crazy because I've been through myself in and out of church I'm not gonna praise God no more I come back praise be to Jesus because God knows how to put situations in my life since I'm running right back to him he's not going to lose on his investment you're too important for God to lose you he's invested too much in you he breaks you up builds you back up and then there he has this vessel this vase that looks gorgeous but she's not done yet what God getting ready to do what we had to do when we used to do stuff like that we had to put it in the fiery furnace yeah you thought you went through something so God put you in the fiery furnace Shadrach back now I have been the the Hebrew boys I can finish the names but y'all know who I was talking about I started too I'm in the fiery furnace God has to do that he has to break all of that greenness out of us all of that immaturity getting upset for no reason because someone didn't shake your hand someone looked at you a certain way they acted a certain way you got to serve feelings about somebody God is trying to make that out of you because that's not going to cause you to have a change in the body let me say it again the way you feel about somebody having those little feelings that's not going to be over there having certain looks are not going to be over there that's right brother perfect love perfect Fellowship it's the only thing that's gonna be over there now when I say God bless you I mean it that when I say I'm praying for you I mean it now when I see that God's blessed you I'm happy for you hey man and that I don't feel a certain way God's trying to bake all of this stuff out of you say Lord make me stronger he put situations to make you stronger Lord grant me patience he put situations to build patience Lord Give Me Love he put people around you so that way you could love it's like brother I don't know I'm trying to love and I'm trying to exercise and God put me with the with a horrible boss he's trying to teach you love you did ask for love [Music] God doesn't give you more than what you're capable of God has confidence in you let me say again God has confidence in you think about it Satan doesn't even think about you unless God directs him he said Bridget what are you talking about in the day of job Satan was minding his own business just mind his own business and God said let me ask you a question have you considered my servant job he's like you never even crossed my mind my mind that's not God I'll praise he's like you got all this has a protection about him you got all this protection around your sons and daughters don't even cross my mind I got other people to deal with it and then feign looks to God he says if you remove the hedge of protection I'll give them a curse you to your face I'm sure God kind of laughed a little bit he's like all right you're on on this one let's do this because God had confidence sometimes let me tell you sometimes the battle that you're going through has nothing to do with you it's God proven to Satan Who You Are yeah amen your battle may not even be for you it could be for somebody else sister I was watching how God dealt with your life and how you have dealt with it I'm just so inspired sometimes what you go through is for the benefit of others because if they see how God works in your life that gives them confidence that God can work in their life [Applause] let me say not only here in church but in the jobs in the job people watch it they know what you stand for they know what you believe they may not say anything to you but Lord prevent the day that's you you slip up and do something that you ain't supposed to you say something you ain't supposed to say they come out there hey I thought you said the Bible said [Music] they know the scripture they know when you said it they're watching you they may not read that Bible but they're watching your biblical life then watch how you hold on to God's word then watch how you react to a negative situation sinew upon Sindhu God puts that that pottery and that fiery furnace let me tell you when God puts you through the Heat the devil could try to put you through in the fire but God's control of how hot it gets let me say one more time you could be in the fiery furnace and the devil could holler and shout and say he's happy about this but God controls how hot it gets he knows what what's enough to build you because he doesn't want to break you he just want to make you stronger he burns all that thing out of you he takes it all out when you take that thing out this is this ashy White clay and people are looking at him might say man that is awesome God's like I'm not done yet it's still working he's still working God's looks at it and says I'm not doing yet then God takes this paint he begins to paint it put certain colors around it he's made us all different black white Chinese Indian European you name it God's made us all different he respect our individuality it's our collectiveness I worship God but he respects our individuality he made you the way he made some tall he made some short he made us a variety of people and God blessed us that way and what we used to do because we thought that was this like oh that's nice we're not done yet we put a coat over it so we could have like this this this uh not shine but like this this glow this gloss to it so that when God looks at it God sees a reflection of himself throughout the process God conceived his reflection so you weren't done yet so he takes this uh this this this this glaze and he puts it over and he puts it back saying we're gonna go through the battle we're gonna go through the struggle but the Bible says I would never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you all the way to the end when the Hebrew children was in the fire furnace when they looked they thought they would have seen just three men the Bible says they saw four and the fourth one was the son of man when you're in your trust God does not leave you by your trance by yourself God's with you in the trials amen once that's done he set it aside and he gives it time to rest and then when he looks at this pottery the gloss begins to come through he sees a reflection of himself God's trying to get you through the trials the tribulation the persecution the things that you go through a reflection of himself sinew upon sinew and then what God does is that he puts the skin over them and all you saw was just nothing but corpse laying there that's what we that's that's where we're at now don't come to church and just be a corpse don't come to church and just be dead the Bible the prophet says the church without emotion is death sometimes I don't feel like stinging but I sing anyhow because I want to let the devil know that greater Z that is did me than he does in the world sometimes I offer like saying amen I say Amen anyhow sometimes I don't feel like shall not shout anyhow sometimes I don't feel like praise not praise anyhow because when I was at new out there in the world when I didn't feel like doing it I did it now that I'm on this side of Glory I'm not gonna let the devil rob me of giving God the praise and glory that he deserves you don't feel like praising God praise Him anyhow let the devil know whose side you are if the devil no it's not a matter of how I feel I'm still going to praise him I'm still going to worship him I'm still going to glorify him and don't just do it here do it in your house [Applause] [Music] cast out those demons from your house praise the Lord praise it to him when no one's looking shout the Praises of God and watch those Devils flee your home is your domain it's God's Kingdom amen the Bible says the inhabit the Praises of his people even in your car praise the Lord [Music] in your job praise the Lord when your Walmart praise the Lord when things are going good praise the Lord when things are going bad praise the Lord everything that has breath praise the name of the Lord [Applause] [Music] praise confuses the enemy he's asking what do you have to be so happy about if you know what I've gone through if you know the weak I've had if you know my trials and tribulations if you know what it took for me to be here then you would know why I'm praising the Lord devil try his best to stop me from being here but it's my God's grace by his Mercy that I'm able to stand on my two feet it's God's blessings if you're gonna take time to come to this place and worship God then worship Him don't go to the house of God because you have to come to the house of God because you want to amen God's called you for a certain purpose he called you for a certain reason this congregation of bones that were now flesh they were laying there God looked across the Spectrum and saw his reflection his people he could have just moved on but that's his creation no one else cared no one seemed to be bothered by it but it bothered God when people don't care God cares when people don't notice God noticed when people don't recognize God recognized he said Ezekiel prophesy your children amen this day was spoken of you this day was spoken of you you were meant to be born in this era all right you could have been born in any age at any time at any moment in history but God's so I fitting that in this era you were to be born you were to come on the scene at any other time in history but God chose you for this time he knew the battle would be tough right he knew the enemy would come in like a flood but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard God has risen you up as a standard in this age we live in a world where people are not embarrassed of the gods they worship [Music] they don't care the gods that they believe in they threw they saw God out of the schools they throw God out of the homes there's no example but I declare to you there's an army that's rising up there's a generation that's been called for this age that is not a shame of the Gospel of Jesus Christ [Music] I'm not ashamed when I'm in a restaurant to pray over my feet amen it's a little thing since but it goes a long way pray over your food have a testimony people just jump into poison but I want to pray that there's no poison in my food not only do I trust the people that's cooking the food back there but I got more trust in God they might have missed something they might have added something come on somebody but when it comes in front of me I said Lord remove all impurities bless the smell that I'm about to receive I don't care who's looking at me as for me and my house we will worship God if they're not ashamed of their God I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen I remember one time when I worked at Bank of America I might have shared this story years ago I worked at Bank of America in North Carolina I went down to go get me something to eat and it was just a Chinese restaurant that was down there right and it was kind of hustling and bustling it was just a lot of movement so I go up there and I patiently wait when you're hungry your stomach growls you know you just you're just patient you only got a certain amount of time and the line's a little long and you just you know trying to get up there and then finally I get up to the to take account and I'm like well give me a one lo mein add some shrimp with that give me this community so they got me the lady in front of me she was all bewildered and you know she's taught giving people hey you know this is what we want everything's happening so fast so she's like it's about eight dollars and something I changed I'm like all right no problem I looked in my wallet and I've down to my last ten dollars it's kind of tough to separate with your money so I gave her my ten dollars I gave him my ten dollars and then the movement of things she spun around and she exists something and she extended the 20 back to me things slow down the Bible says War to them that call evil good in good evil I looked at that twenty dollars coming back to me it was me and that twenty dollars everything was slow motion I I know this is gonna sound funny but I know that face looked at me and winged my head started to move in slow motion [Music] and in my mind I say praise the Lord [Applause] my pastor was not there I'm on somebody y'all look at me like I'm crazy my Deacon was not there my brother in Christ was not there with me that lady in that twenty dollars praise the Lord this is where the battle begins [Music] this was not a sermon that was being preached to me at that time like that it was the longest she did not realize what she was doing I just saw that twenty dollars I'd like praise the Lord but greater Z [Applause] I didn't need a passive tummy like brother Gene you know better than that I didn't need a beacon to remind me what I believed in I didn't I didn't know Bible that I was holding into everything that God wanted me to understand was in me no one would have known anything about it I would have walked away twice as blessed [Music] the Bible says woe to them that call evil good and good evil this was a moment for me to be honest with myself with the word of God amen yes because there was nobody to hold me accountable but in the day of judgment I don't want the devil coming like what are you crazy look at here I got some on you let's rewind real quickly do you remember this incident God is catching me and that very moment I whispered to the lady at first because I tried to justify it excuse me in my attempt to say to get her attention if she didn't respond while it wasn't my fault foreign those are battles that's going through your mind you try to justify things excuse me and I know it's loud in there and I'm talking even lower than I should and then I realized you know what this can't be I said ma'am excuse me and she spun around I'm like you're giving me too much change back she looked and she was astonished she was astonished that someone could be so trustworth someone could be so honest can you think about the repercussion that that could have had on that individual your actions because have a repercussion without you knowing because at the end of the day they gotta balance that drawer and if that drawer is not balanced and I said what did you do they could have lost her her job she could have been a single mother trying to bring him food and now she doesn't now she she doesn't have the means to do that your actions you're inappropriate non non non-word abiding actions right to have a consequence of someone greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world with the courage to speak up no matter how difficult it is when the devil put Temptation he knows how to put the right Temptations in front of you let me tell you since that wasn't the last time that happened there's there's many a times that this happens we come here we we congregate we assemble and we encourage one another but this is not where the battle's at I'm not fighting you I'm fighting a devil and that battle starts when you walk through those doors every amen you said this morning the devil's gonna test it tomorrow morning that's the reason why you got to have a sure Foundation let me tell you there's a lot of things I'm not certain of but the Bible tells me one thing be ye certain of God I'm wrapping it up and there are these bodies were laying there in the valley and God looks at Ezekiel and say speak unto the winds the north south east west the Four Corners speak unto the winds because it was not sufficient for the bodies just to be laying there we more we're more than just corpse we're more than just a vessel or Temple the wind started to come across I'll put it this way there was a mighty there was a sound of a rushing of A Mighty Wind like it was in the day of Pentecost A Rush of A Mighty Wind that came rushing through and every body you start to hear a heartbeat God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life you started to hear heartbeat the Miracles of life well my wife and I first heard that heartbeat or the heartbeats of our kids you realize this is beyond science Beyond man's ability to replicate there's a Creator somewhere yes and these Hearts started to pulsate and one by one these soldiers started to get up they came back from the dead they were once alive they were slain they were killed in battle God sees you where you were at he brings you back to life let me tell you something Saints death does not change you it changes your Dwelling Place when Samuel died as a prophet and they called Samuel back to life again he was still a prophet amen but the Blood changes in that same example I'm closing in that same example we know that we're going to be changed young again right that's what that's what the prophet teaches that's what the Bible teaches let me give you an example when Samuel died and Saul needed him he consulted the witch of Endor he came sneaking in and she's like we ain't supposed to be doing this because you know so I'll put a knee dick out there and he's like don't worry about this I I'll take care of it she called Saul I mean saw it called Samuel and when she saw Samuel Saul says what do you see and the Bible says I see an old man an old man showing that the blood of bulls and goats was not strong enough to change you in the Old Testament but there was a lamb that came there was a lamb that went to Calvary when his blood was shed on Calvary and he went down into that place and he brought back those individuals that blood was powerful enough to change you from an old person to a young person that's the power of the blood that's the reason why our Prophet when he looked at this and he looked beyond the curtains of time he says does the land that is called Forever it's that sweet place that we want to go to the winds came and the Army rose up and God looks ezekiel's Ezekiel you see when you looked at those people there was no hope for them there was no way there was no opportunity but God says when I looked at them I saw something completely different you were written off Saints the devil was done with you he says like the story with job he says if you remove the hedge of protection I'll get him to curse you he's like you want that won't happen so he did everything to job took his kids took his land took all this got him sick his marriage was falling apart and even though he was down to his last breath he refused to curse God will get you down to your knees if he has to he'll get you down to where you're laying in bed and all you have to do is look up to him but he's going to get your attention but that seed on the inside that was planted before the foundation of the world that seed the devil cannot touch he can make you feel your worse have you think you're the worst physically all these different things but down to it when it comes to that life on the inside God says you don't touch that life that life belongs to me we're a work in progress I thank God I'm not what I used to be and I'm on my way what he wants me to be he's not done with me yet and he's not done with him so I stand to our feet Mercy re-rolled my life [Music] Mercy rewrote my life I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy [Music] re-roll My Life One More Time Mercy we wrote my love Mercy [Music] rewrote my life [Music] I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy [Music] as they play that softly it's nothing think about that when you think about your life and what you've gone through what you've come through what a miracle it is you are a miracle of God [Music] people are looking for miracles all they have to do is just look at you and say that's a miracle of God when they say I'm looking for healing of God I'm a healing of God I'm the salvation of God I am everything that God wants I am the Bible says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us think about what that means election predestination [Music] when you are out there in the world and you drunk you were drinking your beer God looked at you and said I made the right decision about you imagine that when you were running with the wrong crowd God says I've made the right decision about you you sitting here this morning is a vindication that God made the right decision about you God will go through Great Lips through the deepest depths to find his elect and so when I reflect on what God has done in my life that's the reason why I could sing that song Mercy free [Music] all together now Hallelujah [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] but his Mercy it rewrote my birthday [Music] [Music] [Music] s [Music] I should my soul cast down but his Mercy [Music] [Music] hey man how many appreciate but the dream amen [Music] this is the air I breathe [Music] I breathe this is [Music] living in me Hallelujah in me
