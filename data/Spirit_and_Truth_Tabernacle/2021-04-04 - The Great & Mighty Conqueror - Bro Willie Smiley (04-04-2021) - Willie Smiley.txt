mind blessed be the name of the lord i certainly appreciate that song from sister charisse amen on tonight [Music] sets us up for the word of god um i wanted to just make mention we're certainly happy to have brother smiley amen coming to bring the word of the lord to us on tonight and i was just sitting there thinking in my mind when we were a single man before we got married we were on the way to church one friday night and as we were driving to church i took a different route don't know why i did it but i just did it and we ended up in an accident where a car was turned over on its um on the top and we were sliding down the street and um by the grace of god we both made it out with just scratches and man uh one i think i had one on one hand he had had a scratch on the other hand and uh but you know way back then i believe satan uh must have had a little glimpse of the future and uh he signed his demons to try to wipe us out before we could get started and uh you know but the the hand of god stayed the enemy and i'm grateful for that tonight and for years we have uh done ministry together for years uh but the lord has i believe elevated us in this season uh to you know do ministry even at a different level and i'm just so uh elated a man to have brother willie smiley a man here ministering in in in the pulpit so let's stand to our feet and let's keep singing this song glory to his name is a precious brother smiley makes his way a man to vulpit tonight precious name i say glory read to his name i'm is [Applause] is amen amen amen amen amen i'm kind of reminded of that story i remember that night looking at brother jack like jack why are you going this way he told me it was a shortcut i'm like a shortcut and uh i tell you what god was definitely gracious to us you know we could we could laugh about it now uh when the car kind of rolled and slid and and uh when jack was like brother you all right man i was on my way out that wasn't done i was like you can stand here if you want to but i'm going to get up out of here i tell you god has definitely been good to us amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight and uh it's good to have my wife with us tonight also amen and uh let us let us uh get our bibles out tonight we'll go straight to the word amen we just trust that we could say something you know brother troy said something uh the other night he say you know it's like it's just two fishes and uh that's all it is tonight uh it's the same two fishes right but you know what made the difference jesus broke it blessed it he gave it to the disciples and and the folks and the disciples gave it see now if jesus don't break it and give it to me then i ain't got nothing to give you but but as long as he's constantly breaking it you know and giving it to the disciples we can constantly feed you and here's here's the thing too uh uh uh when it was all said and done they was able to take up baskets so so we we we pray that we could fool you up tonight and that y'all could take some stuff home with you is that right let us let us look a couple of places in the scriptures tonight but it's good to be here it's good to see everybody i'll tell you what i've definitely enjoyed myself the last couple of services brother troy started off uh working with the grace of god and and brother uh quaker helping somebody help me help me i tell you now when i'm by myself i can pronounce his name but when i get in front of folk i'm ready to put that key in there praise the lord thank god amen for brother jack we want to look at our revelations philippians chapter 2 and revelation revelations chapter one uh philippians chapter two i thought it had this way i wouldn't have to uh if they could pull it up for me i don't have to flip to this bible uh we want to start at the fifth verse it says let let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god keep going we're going to the 11th verse but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto the death even the death of the cross wherefore god also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of the things in heaven and the things in earth and the things under the earth one more and that every tongue shall confess jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father now let us look at revelations chapter 1. revelation 1 17 and 18 everybody have it it says and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i'm the first and the last um he that liveth and was dead and behold i'm alive forevermore amen and have the keys to to hell and of death let us buy heads for a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we just want to give thanks and praise o god for the songs that we've heard lord god amen about the blood and calvary and uh we're we're we're so grateful father tonight to be able to be here and to be in your presence to be amongst uh the saints of god tonight lord and uh we know that the gift is the ability to get oneself out of the way and so we we just want to get ourself out of the way so that uh you could speak to the hearts of your people lord god and uh we could give them something to encourage them and we just thank you and we praise you for all things in jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh i just like to say before we get started we appreciate both jack and just for having the mind of god to want to uh put on these these services um you know one of the things that um we we're going to preach on the great mighty conqueror i think after a while we we're gonna uh appreciate these services we don't realize a lot of folk ain't in church i i ran across a fella today and he's a pastor and he was just saying they ain't they not even having church they zooming and they're doing all of these different things so to be able to come together in a building and and create an atmosphere man that's a that's a tremendous blessing y'all don't even know i just don't know what if i i'll be able to do a do if i had to zoom for a year boy i would probably be struggling right with past struggling i'll be struggling zooming for a year oh lord have mercy but but we appreciate we appreciate that uh tonight we appreciate brother jack and and the inspiration to have the services and we appreciate everybody i i've made a a point to be here uh every service now that sunrise that's going to be a tricky one but i i'm going to do my best if i don't make it well praise the lord [Laughter] amen but but tonight we want to use as a little topic that the great and mighty uh conqueror the greater mighty maybe uh when brother jack mentioned this uh these services to me um maybe a few weeks ago this little thought just kind of uh just dropped down in my heart and it's just kind of been a little minute uh we we realized there's this there's so many ways and directions you can go amen on um on easter and and preach different subjects and things of that nature one thing i'm grateful for is is a a revelation my mother-in-law mentioned it uh we we thank god that we've we surpassed uh easter eggs and bunny rabbits and things of that nature i was listening to a friend of mine and i kind of understand but it it's like you you you don't see the real picture uh easter had nothing to do with if you think about it uh a bunny rabbit come on come on come on you know it we we're talking about a lamb and blood it was bloody it wasn't nothing nice it wasn't it wasn't nothing purity and things of that nature you know uh you go back to genesis i think brother quick who us made that reference last night see chapter when when um um those two brothers uh uh were brought to a place where they had to bring up their sacrifices to god you know one one brother right he he brought the fruits in the field and and and the flowers and and all of that and god said ah right that's not it that's not what it's going to be all about it's it's not going to be anything that that that that man could look back and say that he did within himself it's not going to be anything beautiful that that will not be the revelation that moves down through the history of the scriptures right but but a lamb was slain according to the bible before the foundation of the world right that that was the thing that was in the mind of god hallelujah is that right a lamb and and us being identified with blood so we're grateful this this evening right that is that we have the revelation of blood amen sister dixon used to sing this song it's dripping with blood yes glory and we talk about a bleeding bloody word tonight all right amen amen eagles eager something about an eagle they want something bloody something that's fresh killed and all of that amen uh we want to maybe get started and try not to hold us too long thank god brother jack uh started the service early so i got at least about two hours though [Laughter] praise the lord but um one of the things we we find um and uh we maybe i want to maybe start out and and read a couple of things and we'll pick up some statements just see how god leads us from there right uh he says you know uh in the message uh the great and mighty conqueror and this is kind of where we're gonna base our thought from all the way through uh uh verse five he says there has been man in our days right uh uh and in the days gone by and in great in the great history of the world in his great broad fields of battle there has been many great conquerors many great things that have been done for the human race now y'all keep that y'all keep that point in mind because uh it helps us to really understand uh what christ is coming was all about and what calvary was all about it was about the human race right right every everything that g that jesus did it was for you and i i'm grateful for that he had no selfish motives no selfish intentions and things of that nature it wasn't that because one of the things we got to realize he had to be perfect he had to be the the right kind of sacrifice is that right amen one of the things we realized amen jesus had a real big job right that's right and and one of the things i realized is studying jesus did things that was going to do things and has done things that you know what humanity couldn't do amen right and and it's all of its ability uh there's things that jesus christ has accomplished force like trust say we we gotta we gotta start thinking different as christians yes glory right right amen we gotta be able to see what he has already done for us not gonna do i like the statement that the prophet of god makes he says you know what jesus can't do no more for us tonight than what he's already but y'all gonna make me preach tonight it's already done hallelujah the victory is already won [Music] i'm getting ahead of myself the battle is already over glory and it's in this and i'm gonna just say this i'm gone and and i know people might not like this but it ain't victory is one not that's not it boy lord have mercy glory to god it's like man we gotta pick up some speed when you sing victory is victory is one man you gotta you talking about excitement you you you talking about tambourines and you you look back in the scriptures when folk got victory huh when the shout of the king was in the camera when right when folks saw god moving on their behalf man it made the the it may hell shake y'all be right here victory not nothing not like that man i i'm gonna look back when when marrying him and and when when they saw when they saw that in me right that was prophesied drowned it glory to god so y'all don't know nothing about being changed [Applause] y'all may not know nothing about being beat all right don't know nothing about being a slave don't know nothing about being in prison could you imagine somebody that just spent 20 years behind bars and them gates swing open and they walking out all night a lot you know praise the lord man they got green on their face within the ill don't know where they going for show don't know what they gonna do but all they know is that i i what's what's bound now i'm free now man i'm finna tear up some stuff oh glory that's how you feel as a christian when when you realize what god has done for you amen but but he says you know there has been many great conquerors many great things that has been done for the human race he says in thinking of how many great conquerors we've had in this world and and what great things the seventh verse they have done to to watch this to further or in better the human way of living and i and i thought that you know what um um i'm glad that he he had us in his mind right right um uh everything that christ did amen was so that we could have a better way of living right because because if he had not a cup if he had not went to calvary if he had not died and rose right wasn't enough for him to come on the scene but he had to die right he had to go take some keys and he had to come back all right but have you ever thought about what kind of world this would be if if jesus couldn't have conquered come on church i i had a little i think we all have i i mean we we've all lived some form and sin i mean i might have been a little further down in it than most of y'all you know in the depths but could you imagine what life would be hallelujah right if it wasn't for calvary if if if it wasn't for the great and mighty conqueror glory to god amen man when i when i read when i read that you know i just kind of highlighted it and put it put a little note in it this has been the best life that i could have lived as a human being right right people people you know people struggle right people people struggle with with the thought of living for god and making this sacrifice and and and this vow and this this marriage to the word and what we might have to give up preach wow this is a much better life right i couldn't i couldn't have lived the life any better on my own amen when i think of well now let's think about something i don't know how far we're going to just go to i can't go no more right but but let's let's think about in the flesh you know uh family inheritances and and all of the things and all the obstacles and all the things that and then then you know the the the contest the the battle there's no way we could even begin to speak of victory come on church look you could take victory off your tongue apart from jesus christ right come on come on our lives right now right i know we we party we handsome now we got suits on and ties and all of that and sometimes we we we turn up our nose to to folk a man that's on the corners that's got signs and begging for money all right uh the like the songs say sister nelly used to say it could have been me right with no shoe right now you know i feel good i got on a nice outfit tonight praise the lord but it could have been me smell it not knowing where my next meal gonna come from you know sometimes we get all lifted up with folk that we know and folk in our family and things of that nature i don't know about y'all but i just thank god for grace is that right brother troy because it could have been me i was oh let me say something as hard as i fought amen to try not to be like you know my daddy i was going on that same path and couldn't stop myself could couldn't help myself couldn't conquer couldn't overcome is that right glory to god couldn't do it couldn't do it listen church didn't know what real life was all about didn't know what living was all about right now right man i didn't know what it was like to live life without puffing on a cigarette a a bottle of liquor a joint or this or something didn't know right amen but jesus come down for the betterment if it weren't for nobody else he come down from me he did it for me huh he he knew the road that amen i'd be traveling on he said boy i want to give him a better life oh jesus i love to preach with you thank you i want to show him a better way yes you know that's a difficult thing right that's a that's a that's a real difficult thing for a lot of folk trying to show them a better way a better life in christ wow right wow that's that's really the preacher can scream and howl and everything else as parents you could talk like to you blue in the face i don't know what that's like huh and uh unless it's quickened to them they'll never comprehend amen then all you're trying to do is give a show them a better way of living right great great great men think about that right many great conquerors we've had in this world what great things that they've done what this now this on the humanistic side that they've done to further and better the human way of living i thought my that's powerful great great men and what what they've tried to do and what they've tried to accomplish right he says i was thinking of this great uh napoleon back in the day yeah and how he was uh he wasn't exactly a frenchman but he had something in his mind right uh and he just he said he despised friends i'm just trying to get to some a point here uh he he did not he said didn't like him he come from the owls but he had an idea in his mind that someday that he would conquer and the reason that he had these in his mind he had to have something to work on right that's that's true if you're gonna accomplish anything you gotta have something right there that that you're trying to uh right achieve or you won't be able to be persistent right or persevere right right right amen uh he says and to every man before you can do a job you have to have some motive come on right let's see you know and having the right motive right some alternative right something that you are working on for a a working purpose something to work by see jesus didn't just come just to come all right the statement of the prophet he makes say he just didn't come just hoping somebody would feel sad not that wasn't it he he had a purpose in coming yeah there was something behind everything that jesus actually done right and i'm gonna say this i'ma get to this say this before i get to it if he hadn't done it what he done we'd be in trouble we'd be in trouble boy i'd be trying to find a cave somewhere and hide in it especially especially when when we see that that we're living in an age where where uh uh people's hearts is failing for fear and and we back in genesis right amen we back in genesis where the very imagination of man is evil continuously that's right right but i thank god that we're covered by the blood think about the age where the prophet of god he makes a statement he he talks to he talks about uh uh uh uh insanity that's right people are insane that's right that's right right people are insane absolutely right people are insane but thank god for the blood that that covers us so that we can walk out our house and go about our occupations and things of that nature without fearing glory without fear amen he did it for me amen i'm i'm i'm moving i'm moving he says i'm i'm just trying to you know just drop these three things in here i'm gonna pick up a little speed in a minute and we're gonna get out of here but but it's something that i want to bring out right because this this napoleon you know he had something that he wanted to achieve i'll skip some of it right and and he actually achieved some some of it right but look at look at the individual after he was able to achieve these things he he he dot look it look at look at his end with the great achievements and all of the accolades and things of that nature watch something here he couldn't hold himself he couldn't hold his position right right come on preach with somebody that that status that he had it actually drove him crazy and as i was reading some of the statements i thought you know what and that's nothing but the truth god allows men listen you don't become great on your own in the economy of god right right i mean we we we give people too much of what they don't deserve i mean the ministry should be honored and things of that nature but i think we we push man more than we push god all right even with all of this truth we do something that the man who brought it never done he never pushed himself he was never trying to point people to himself he was always only trying to point people back to the word back to the bible back to right it wasn't about a man it was about christ because look we we look over in revelation 5 man wasn't able to take the book no man john started crying that's right so how could a prophet come on the scene amen and point us to a man point us to himself that wasn't even scripture his ministry was only to reveal the son of man luke 17 30. yes make christ known amen not himself but to make christ known that's right reveal christ come on church i believe we can all say amen to that it wasn't about a man but what what we find is is is that you know god blesses men and blesses men in ministry and and here's the thing people from a humanistic standpoint going to be people right people going be people especially when they lack spiritual understanding they're gonna do things in the flesh and and you know somebody ain't ain't ain't wrong because i mean you're supposed to try to encourage and do different things but i think it's the job of the minister right to hold his position by the baptism of the holy ghost to hold his place to not amen get lifted up but but we see it all the time a man a man could be a small god blesses his ministry he start traveling or his church blow up or something of that nature and the next thing you know boy all you need is a glass of water you drowning oh y'all oughta talk to me that's all it will take it won't even take a bathtub fool one glass cause his head be so high that's right can't hardly shake hands i've seen this right i've i've seen this and this this has been to the detriment right right now right of of ministers of people right look at look at napoleon right he he did all of this conquer but he could not sustain himself right he couldn't hold himself he couldn't hold his position he couldn't handle all of the praise and [Music] all of the brag it got too much he look at his end he died a drunk right amen he could conquer he could conquer and one fold and then the next thing amen because of the the humanistic realm in the realm of the spirit it just wiped them out it was it was just absolutely amen too much for him is that right glory to his wonderful name to be to be able to stand in that position amen as i'm preaching this tonight to be able to stand in that position as as a conqueror but but yet amen he was overwhelmed right see what's something there's things that we can accomplish in the natural right amen but it takes the baptism of the holy ghost it takes like my brother was talking about last night the resurrection to take place down on the inside of us to hold us positionally amen come on now to hold us positionally after we we do great things everybody can't take being pat on the back praise the lord brother smiley praise the lord brother boy did not preach praise god you see hey man come on church yeah look look at watch this now we we're working tonight right he was able to accomplish something right the thing that was on his mind he accomplished that and and then you know once he got to this place without the mighty conqueror he fell apart come on now let's let's show us something look at look at look at uh noah right let's bring it to the scripture look at look at noah look at look at what noah was able to do y'all think that was easy come on now the preacher a preacher message that nobody never heard it's gonna and to just keep saying it right right it's going to rain it's going to rain to preach a judgment message to a group of people that never seem rain didn't know rain god had turned the corner right right glory to god god had turned a corner man smart men smart people educated people people could prove man please no such thing a man a man that operated in faith right come on right amen something that was revealed to him personally all right see that's why the baptism and this way a lot of people fail right because you get caught up in emotions and sensations right but the the your experience ain't a revelation to you one thing about it nobody can't take away from me what god has done for me is that right glory to god glory to god you've got to be able to look back to the time when god brought about a change i don't care how much you scream on this altar crying all of that roll around and all of that come on that's emotionalism most of it huh you got to be able to get up from there and accept and and i had to learn that right the experience that i had in brother wesker office versus the experience i had in the pentecostal church they had me down there an emotional what they call terrorists right jesus jesus jesus huh but then and brother wesker over he looked at me like son i ain't got time for all this that what you doing but i got to go y'all now y'all know brother west go back in the day when when he was working on the church and everything brother westcott slowed down he almost ate it now back then boy brother wesker was like a jet plane now you see me now you don't he's like young man get up it's done it's over it's something i'm my friends feel like standing on sir something within me accepted it's over something deep accepted marthaphiny said grab a hold of that grab a hold of that right grab a hold of that and move on out grab a hold of that this is exactly what you've been waiting on grab a hold of that and move out [Applause] you can do it tonight you can hear from your theophany tonight you can grab a hold of it [Applause] and move out y'all gonna make me shout out in this place tonight oh glory right hallelujah hallelujah noah accomplished all that he accomplished right went through the judgment come out on the other side right not that he was lost right but look look at his end look how he died without the mighty conqueror a man um think about it the the the building of the ark for the safety of the people was for the embattlement right right so that they would not have to go through the judgment right wow amen they wouldn't have to go through the judgment that's it they didn't you know what they didn't really know the depths of noah's message come on they couldn't comprehend that yeah man we've seen we've seen boat builders before special this is a different boat though my god the specifics and and everything amen that was given to noah by uh uh god was for the the safety and the embedment of the people exactly think about it when when men had got so corrupt god wanted to wipe wipe humanity out is that right glory to god but god found grace noah found grace in the sight of god god used noah to bring a message of watch this of deliverance of hope right ultimately ultimate to wipe out amen uh uh sin and things of that nature is that right and and start humanity over right it's a it's amazing thing to understand the plan of god right it's a lot going on right but we got to be able to read between the lines is that right we're living in the jasmine hour right but are you shaking don't preach like that brother smiley i ain't even move they could look people can they can do what they want to do and things of that nature right amen i realized something what he has done right because this has been a great drama right yeah right it's been it's been a great drama like we said god has been building a masterpiece [Applause] bringing back perfection and eternity see amen when we leave here we're going into something that's better see reject the redemption story is about the betterment right amen from earth to glory oh y'all ain't with me huh i know y'all tired i know y'all tired y'all had a long day but i i'll preach to you anyway i scream at you i'll let you jump at you but but to think right amen uh let me let me move a little faster that that that here here a man could could accomplish right could have could accomplish cross over the tribulation period and become a total embarrassment right such an embarrassment amen two the two sons that they was they was like oh look at daddy look at that daddy just drunk out his mind they backed in right covered that up one one son like wow look at this man he he just totally disrespected noah god didn't like that god was like that's my servant now i know he drunk as a who wow like brother west coast you should say he's drunk as a whole and everything but but apart from the great and mighty conqueror it shows us amen the the human element the human element can't overcome satan and sin and and all of that on its own you cannot hold your position your stand your status hallelujah right apart from the great and mighty cops that that's why when he came on the scene he told his disciples you know right at the end of his ministry he said you know what man i got to go away yes sir he realized he had a purpose amen he realized you know what i got to go away so that the next phase of my ministry could come into fruition right that i could give the people something right amen that would embattle them right bring them back to this perfection right and and help them to keep their possession [Music] [Applause] we'll jack our lives up in a heartbeat but the mighty conqueror lives in us amen you know we could we could look back at that scripture uh we're more than a conqueror through him romans 8 right you ain't got to pull it up uh more than a conqueror is through him right that loves us right amen amen we could we could keep ourself we could well it's keeping us put it that way we ain't keeping ourselves no it's keeping me glory glory to god because

complete time tonight like i got all night huh what's the truth any higher church amen it's the truth anyhow amen but but to think right amen a man like these the the humanistic individuals we can

heart he said you talking about this is when we understand the battle was over the victory is one one he says uh he said you talk about about beating this pants blowing horns he said the world ought to be in a jubilee wow we ought to be in a jubilee right like it has never been the screams and the shouts of his people because this is a memorial day that when he conquered the last enemy and set uh we kept we ought to have some tamarinds beaten shouting glory to god you brother see you anointed oh god you annoyed that why you could act crazy and move around like that we ain't anointed where you

don't have to get excited and stay excited amen about the word right man he said when he pulled up she was shouting running around and she was all and everything else he said he just stood back and looked he said sister i thought you told me you don't get emotional you know what set a free she got victory knowing she gonna be right just the thought of ride versus yeah she just went there oh my my mind he said man you ought to be this is the believer right he said we ought to if if we understand what jesus christ has done for us right we should be screaming and hollering and you know jerking off aprons letting musicians make their way uh uh and waving people's people say we we crazy because we shot and we run and we scream and we holler hallelujah he say you know what they have never felt
