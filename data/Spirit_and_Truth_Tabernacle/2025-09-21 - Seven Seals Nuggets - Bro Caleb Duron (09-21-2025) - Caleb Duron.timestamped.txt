[22:23] Sister Vera, Lord, the devil has been
[22:26] fighting her, Lord, giving her
[22:27] migraines, Lord God, but like she said,
[22:29] you are the neurologist. You are the

[22:57] when when something has to die in order

[23:37] pray over the giving Lord Jesus. You
[23:39] said give Lord God and it shall be it
[23:42] shall be given unto you pressed down
[23:44] shaken together running over. Father God
[23:46] that's what you said concerning your
[23:48] promise Lord. You said if we brought
[23:50] into the storehouse, you would open the
[23:52] windows of heaven and pour us out
[23:53] blessings. There wouldn't be room to
[23:55] receive it. And you would rebuke the

[35:41] Uh we
[35:43] want to um again thank the Lord to have
[35:48] all the saints from Tucson, Arizona.
[35:53] Amazing Grace Temple.
[35:56] Thank God for their pastor, Brother
[35:57] Caleb. uh been a friend of mine for a
[36:01] number of years. And as he was saying on
[36:04] um Friday night, how you know you got a
[36:08] good friend is that when you
[36:11] are disconnected just for a little bit,
[36:13] when you get reconnected, you just pick
[36:15] up right where you left off.
[36:18] And uh that's just the way it's been.
[36:20] And you know for for for some reason
[36:24] um
[36:26] typically brother Caleb is always
[36:29] connected when we make a move.
[36:33] When we were in Green Acres the first
[36:36] time he come to preach for us and we
[36:39] were uh in the process of thinking about
[36:42] relocating somewhere else and and in the
[36:45] middle of his sermon he just stopped.
[36:46] They said, "Brother Jack, you are uh the
[36:50] Lord said you're leaning in a particular
[36:52] direction. Just go ahead and go in that
[36:54] direction. He's with you." And I was I
[36:57] was leaning because, you know, we were
[36:59] moving from uh paying, you know, one um
[37:03] thing for rent, but it was going to
[37:04] double and our congregation had not
[37:06] doubled. Uh so it was a little stressful
[37:10] to kind of make a decision like that.
[37:13] And um you know it was you know just
[37:16] just I didn't know which way to go but
[37:18] that word just encouraged me and we went
[37:21] forward and uh the Lord took us to that
[37:23] other place and and we we were able to
[37:27] sustain for roughly 13 years uh there
[37:32] and uh God was good to us and then when
[37:35] it was time for us to leave that place
[37:38] brother Caleb was the one that preached
[37:39] the last sermon
[37:42] in that place and he preached and we
[37:44] packed up and had to move out on that
[37:47] day and we went to a school, you know,
[37:50] for a a season roughly about 4 years and
[37:53] it's been 4 years since he's been here
[37:54] with us. Uh and um so we we were there
[37:58] at the school and you know we you know I
[38:01] was telling brother Jesse last night
[38:02] just there's a number of things that
[38:03] were happening during that season and we
[38:06] we felt that we were in position to
[38:08] purchase and that we have something but
[38:10] the Lord had not opened that door yet.
[38:13] And uh so this came available to us and
[38:16] we got here in July July 30th of this
[38:20] year. So, uh, at the same time, Brother
[38:23] Caleb was calling me saying, "Brother, I
[38:26] I just got y'all on my heart. I just got
[38:28] y'all on my heart." Said, "Brother, I
[38:30] don't know why you happen to call all
[38:32] the time around when we moving and
[38:34] everything, but uh, I'm so happy to have
[38:37] him." Amen. I I appreciate appreciate
[38:40] them. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[38:44] Lord. We We have a lot of history. We
[38:46] We've come from the same grounds.
[38:50] Amen. And uh so we got a lot of history.
[38:53] We go way back. Uh so we we just thank
[38:56] God, you know, for for all that he has
[38:58] done throughout the years and and all
[39:00] the saints that have come. Amen. To join
[39:03] uh brother brother Caleb. 22 saints uh

[39:13] some pressure on the saints in Spirit
[39:16] and Truth Tabernacle cuz uh I I know
[39:19] they wouldn't want me to show up in
[39:21] Arizona by myself
[39:24] and we done I mean some some saints say
[39:27] I drove all the way over there.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; 32-hour drive to get here. Say I know
[39:33] brother Jack ain't going to show up by
[39:34] itself. So I'm going to try to make sure

[39:38] opportunity to go out to Tucson with us.
[39:40] Amen. for uh for some services. Amen. We
[39:44] thank God. I wanted to also just um uh

[40:17] to each and everyone. The sisters got in
[40:19] and just did what Spirit and Truth does.
[40:22] Amen. And and and I I heard it was done

[40:28] was um some um some people uh saying,
[40:32] "Do y'all got do y'all have business
[40:34] cards?
[40:37] They want to hire you." You know, and I
[40:40] said, "Yeah, that's that that means
[40:41] you're doing things with excellence."
[40:43] And and that's that that's a real
[40:45] blessing. So, thank you all the sisters
[40:47] that that fixed something, that gave
[40:50] money towards it, that uh serve the
[40:52] family, just just everything. I really
[40:54] appreciate you all uh doing that. Um

[41:40] and uh I was just very very blessed.
[41:43] Amen. and to see how the Lord just used

[41:49] to think about. Amen. And and and I just
[41:52] I was just very very blessed. Amen. Just
[41:55] to see how God used him. Uh so we we
[41:58] just we just thank God. It's it's
[42:00] something about uh he was talking about
[42:02] that mantle responsibility and um you
[42:05] know we we feel that you know we are uh
[42:08] getting close to 60 and um so we realize
[42:12] you know uh hey we don't know how much
[42:15] time we got so we got to make sure we're
[42:17] passing on that mental responsibility to
[42:19] the next generation. Right? Hallelujah.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime people don't want to step
[42:25] up and get underneath the load.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you got to carry something.
[42:30] Jesus carried a cross and you got to
[42:33] take up your cross and follow Jesus.
[42:37] Yes, there's some responsibility here,
[42:39] but somebody got to carry it. Every
[42:41] generation got to have somebody willing
[42:44] to step up and carry the responsibility.
[42:47] Amen. Appreciate you, brother Troy. God
[42:50] bless you. God bless you. All right.
[42:54] Oh, let me also say this. musicians.
[42:57] This is what I'm talking about. Y'all,
[42:59] y'all got it. Thank y'all. Thumbs up.
[43:02] Thumbs up.
[43:04] I was just sharing some something with
[43:06] them, but this there there's I'm going
[43:09] to mention this and I'm going to let
[43:10] brother Keith come. So, there's a
[43:12] there's um
[43:16] um
[43:17] a gift is is is a beautiful thing to
[43:20] have, but discipline with the gift is
[43:25] actually a whole another level
[43:28] &gt;&gt; because I I know a lot of gifted people,
[43:30] but they're not disciplined,
[43:33] &gt;&gt; right? And and and they just do a lot of
[43:35] things that can actually disrupt the
[43:36] service rather than actually help the
[43:38] service. And uh and and I mean I this
[43:41] band getting together, they excited, you
[43:43] know, and I'm excited to have them
[43:44] together, but I just want them when they
[43:46] when when they get into other
[43:48] environments be disciplined and know how
[43:50] to handle themselves in every
[43:52] environment. And so I just had a little
[43:54] talk with them on Friday night and I see
[43:56] how they done adjusted. So I'm going to
[43:59] give them a thumbs up. This is what I'm
[44:01] talking about.
[44:03] This is what I'm talking about. Man, I
[44:06] appreciate each and every one of them.
[44:08] Boy, I tell you this is this is this is
[44:10] this is I'm about ready to say spirit
[44:13] and truth 3.0. But
[44:18] but I thank God. Amen. Let's stand to
[44:20] our feet. What? What do we
[44:25] Okay. All right.
[44:28] Let's stand to our feet. Amen. Let's
[44:30] welcome

[44:35] thank God for his precious wife, Sister
[44:37] Ann, his precious daughter. Amen. Uh
[44:42] being with us, Naen. Like many of y'all
[44:45] have been waiting to see Naen for a long
[44:47] time. You finally got a chance to see
[44:49] her. 14 years in the making, but she's
[44:52] here. Praise the Lord. God bless you.

[47:23] If nobody else can worship, we know we
[47:25] can worship. If nobody else is happy, we
[47:28] know we're happy. If people don't have
[47:30] the joy of the Lord, we know we've got
[47:31] the joy of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[47:34] Hallelujah. God be praised and praise be
[47:37] to God. Glad to be back in the house of
[47:40] the Lord. We had a wonderful time of
[47:41] fellowship yesterday. Uh all of us, we
[47:44] got to meet with brother Jack a little
[47:45] bit and we all, you know, uh in Arizona,
[47:48] they don't have water. There's no such
[47:50] thing as water.
[47:53] Ocean water that is. And so, uh when we
[47:56] get to see ocean water, that right,
[47:57] Brother Samuel, is that right? So when
[47:59] we get a chance to see ocean water,
[48:00] we're like, "Wow." You know, but y'all
[48:03] are you all It's be like us in the Grand
[48:05] Canyon. We've seen it. It's a hole in
[48:06] the ground. It's beautiful. But you all
[48:08] would be like, "Wow, look at this hole
[48:10] in the ground."
[48:12] &gt;&gt; You know, look at all this desert. Well,
[48:13] what about it?
[48:16] Uh and it it hardly ever rains in
[48:19] Tucson. And so it it raining every day
[48:21] here for an hour or less. It doesn't
[48:23] matter. It rained and we're excited to
[48:25] have rain. So, uh, but we're I
[48:28] appreciate it all the fellowship. Now,
[48:30] brother Jack said something there.
[48:31] Brother Jesse, my assistant pastor in
[48:33] Amazing Grace Temple. He and I talked
[48:36] about having arrange making arrangements
[48:37] to have different ones come out in
[48:40] December. Well, y'all may be seated. Go
[48:41] ahead. That's all right. If y'all want
[48:42] to go, it's okay. Y'all like you wanted
[48:44] to stop. I told the drummer he's
[48:47] supposed to get excited when Jack did
[48:48] said all that. He's supposed to go.
[48:52] He was scared.
[48:54] Uh, I said, "Let me have that stick." He
[48:56] said, "No, no, brothers.
[49:00] That's all right." Uh, and uh, but he
[49:02] said something about, we were talking
[49:03] about having you all come and, uh, he
[49:05] actually said, "Can we do January?" So,
[49:07] we could probably make that work even
[49:08] with the other brother. Might make it
[49:09] work for him, too. You know, we don't
[49:11] want to miss Santa Claus. So,
[49:15] and so, uh, but when he just said that
[49:18] we we stepped it up a notch, uh, I will
[49:20] go ahead and say this. You're all
[49:21] welcome to come when he comes. We'd like
[49:22] to have every single one of you. It's
[49:24] been I don't know how many years,
[49:25] Brother Jeff. How long has it been since
[49:26] we had them all at your house?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; 16 years. It's been that long, too.
[49:32] Okay. All right. It's I think it might
[49:34] be just a little bit longer. But I
[49:35] remember we'd never left that
[49:36] neighborhood. We lived in the same
[49:38] because here come Jeff in his van. And
[49:40] all they did was sing and sing and sing.
[49:42] And then we decided we'd walk down to
[49:44] church. And here's about Oh, I don't
[49:46] that neighborhood's never seen that many
[49:47] black people in that neighborhood ever.
[49:49] Plus all of us. And everybody's walking
[49:51] to church singing up and down Zion's
[49:52] glory. So I just thought it was
[49:54] wonderful. So you're welcome to come.
[49:55] We'd love to have you. And brother
[49:57] Smiley, come on back out. I didn't know
[49:59] that was Brother Smiley. I thought
[50:00] Brother Jeff was standing next to me.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Smiley. Brother Jeff,
[50:04] can y'all get by each other right quick?
[50:06] Go stand by. Was the y'all Go ahead.
[50:09] Look at this. I'm not Look at this.
[50:13] Look,
[50:15] twins.
[50:18] I know. I know people say y'all look
[50:20] alike, but you really y'all look this.
[50:24] That would be considered rude, but this
[50:26] time it's true.
[50:29] And my brother in the front, you could
[50:30] be like their little brother. So, I
[50:33] don't know if it's the head or the white
[50:34] hair. I don't know. But God bless you,
[50:37] brother Smile. Leave it up to somebody
[50:39] when you're trying to lose weight and
[50:40] look good. Leave it up to somebody who
[50:41] hasn't seen you in a few years to say,
[50:43] "Man, you're getting fat.
[50:49] I said, "Brother Smiley, you should have
[50:51] seen me 20 pounds ago." He goes,
[50:52] "Really?"
[50:54] He couldn't believe that. Like, that's
[50:55] this suit didn't fit. This suit didn't
[50:57] fit two months ago. All right. But
[51:00] anyway, God bless you. It's good to have
[51:01] friends. Good to be back in the house of
[51:03] God. And yeah, being brother Jack, we go
[51:04] back a long time. Brother Jack, what's
[51:06] the mystery? You see, Caleb is the one
[51:08] who said, "We're more than able to take
[51:10] the land." So, I think it's fitting that
[51:12] I call you every time it's time for you
[51:13] to take another piece of property.
[51:16] [Applause]
[51:20] I'm just
[51:21] [Music]
[51:26] &gt;&gt; that just kind of came out there.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know if that must have been the
[51:30] Lord cuz I was sitting there going, "Why
[51:32] is it so mysterious? This is what I'm
[51:34] supposed to be doing.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Take the land.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; If it's time for you to take another
[51:38] piece of property, if Joshua or Caleb
[51:40] don't call you, don't take it. It's not
[51:41] yours."
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; I was saying that as a joke. Lord, I'm
[51:49] sorry. That was serious.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; He knows what he's saying, doesn't he?
[51:54] &gt;&gt; All right, keep me on the time. We don't
[51:55] have to take too much time. The Lord
[51:56] willing, we'll be in and out. We know
[51:58] how it is here and we want to make sure
[51:59] we stay faithful to the time. So, would
[52:01] you open your Bibles to Genesis chapter
[52:03] 18 and verse 10?
[52:06] And I hope and pray that you all are
[52:08] able to come uh this evening. It'd be
[52:11] nice to have more support, especially
[52:12] for brother G. really appreciate,
[52:14] brother Jean. Uh, Brother Jean's always
[52:16] been very welcoming to myself. Uh, and I
[52:18] don't think there's ever been a time
[52:20] that you've introduced us, uh, Brother
[52:22] Jack, that I haven't come out here that
[52:23] he need to have me preach.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; So, I really appreciate his hospitality.
[52:26] Plus, I don't know, they came out a
[52:28] while back. You came when they came,
[52:30] didn't you? Yeah. That was that time
[52:32] that we all went to Sabino Canyon and it
[52:35] rained all the way up the hike and all
[52:38] the way down the hike. And we got up,
[52:40] well, it started to rain. We got about
[52:41] halfway up uh to the different places
[52:44] and I shouted down. I said, "This is not
[52:46] going to stop. Do y'all want to just
[52:47] turn around?" And all them Haitian
[52:48] brothers says, "We didn't come to leave,
[52:50] brother. Let's keep on going." And so
[52:52] here's Caleb again on the mountain
[52:56] taking people into the storm. I said,
[52:57] "Man, I don't know if this is going to
[52:58] be good." But, uh, we made it back down.
[53:01] We were soaked and it was a funny story
[53:02] and we had a good time with it. So, it's
[53:04] a memory we won't soon forget. Uh, and
[53:07] that's one of the rare times it rains.
[53:09] They kept saying, "It's supposed to
[53:10] rain. It's supposed to rain. Ah, it
[53:11] never rains in Tucson. And wouldn't you
[53:13] know it, it rained in Tucson that day.
[53:15] So, if you would read it together, let's
[53:17] read it together. 18 and verse 10. Oh, I
[53:19] guess I better get it. Hold on
[53:24] one second here. All right. And it reads
[53:26] like this. And he said, I will certainly
[53:28] return unto thee according to the time
[53:30] of life. And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall
[53:32] have a son. And Sarah heard it in the
[53:35] tent which was behind him her him. Yeah.
[53:38] May God add a blessing to the reading of
[53:39] his words. Let's pray. Father, we love
[53:41] you. Ask you to bless the remainder of
[53:43] this service as you have already. We
[53:44] know you're here. So, I won't make you
[53:46] more welcome than you are. Lord, you're
[53:48] welcome to stay and to feed our souls.
[53:51] Get me out of the way. I pray in Jesus
[53:53] Christ's name we ask. For there is no
[53:54] other name greater. Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. All
[53:58] right. Now, I use that scripture as an
[54:01] opener there. Uh and then I want to take
[54:03] you over to another place real quick if
[54:05] we could to John chapter 1. Amen. John
[54:09] chapter 1 and I want to say it's going
[54:12] to be um verse 47
[54:16] and you'll see what I mean here in just
[54:17] a little bit. Verse 47.
[54:25] John chapter 1 verse 47. Jesus saw
[54:27] Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him
[54:29] behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no
[54:32] guile. Nathaniel saith unto him, "Whence
[54:36] thouest whence knowest thou me?" Jesus
[54:40] answered and said unto him, "Before
[54:43] that Philip called thee,
[54:46] when thou was under the fig tree, I saw
[54:50] thee." Amen. We know what the scripture
[54:53] says then. He knew who he was. All
[54:55] right. Now, let me get this coat off
[54:57] real quick if you don't mind.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; You don't mind, do you?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[55:03] Well, Jack, this is a nice place,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; but you know, none of this none of it
[55:08] none of it belongs to any of us, right?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Even our church, it's ours, but it's not
[55:13] ours. And uh because I say that because
[55:16] everything belongs to the government,
[55:17] but everything belongs to the meek. So,
[55:19] I don't know how to weigh that out for
[55:20] you.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; But the meek do inherit the earth.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Sorry, Mr. Trump. You're going to have
[55:27] to move out of one of your towers when I
[55:29] come back.
[55:34] I'm just saying build me one on the
[55:36] ocean. Oh, there is one on the ocean
[55:38] front. Marlargo is ours.
[55:45] [Music]
[55:50] &gt;&gt; This kind of talk could get me thrown in
[55:52] prison now,
[55:54] huh? I might get me in some good
[55:56] trouble.
[55:58] It belongs to us. Please treat it nice.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Keep it sanctified and holy. Will you
[56:04] get all them riffraff out of there?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Including your No, I'm just All right.
[56:08] All right. I stopped. I stopped.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I stopped. You know, I I'll say this.
[56:15] Because of what Let me Let me give you
[56:16] my real thoughts on President Trump. You
[56:18] want to hear it? It's real good. No,
[56:20] it's good. Because of what he did for
[56:22] Jerusalem, I do believe he'll be there.
[56:25] I'm that serious. because there'll be
[56:28] people there that brother Brandon said,
[56:29] I don't know if he'll be bright or if
[56:31] he's going to be. I don't know what what
[56:32] the order of things going to be. But
[56:34] because he made Jerusalem the capital of
[56:36] Israel, something that had to have been
[56:38] done years and years ago because he did
[56:41] that one thing, I do believe that God is
[56:43] going to keep him alive.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to I'm going to go on to
[56:46] say this. He's not going to even know
[56:47] why he's alive.
[56:49] Because you see, the Bible does say, and
[56:51] brother Jesse got up one time and he
[56:52] preached, "When the trump of God shall
[56:55] sound, when the last trump sounds." And
[57:00] brother Jesse got up and goes, "You
[57:01] realize he can't be president no more.
[57:03] This is the last time Trump is going to
[57:05] sound."
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And I said, you know, there there's
[57:08] stuff too there. And then you got the uh
[57:10] the Jews, what they the the Israelites,
[57:11] they put that coin together. They have
[57:13] King Cyrus on one side and the profile
[57:15] of President Trump on the other side.
[57:16] And I said, "That's not a that's not a
[57:18] joke to them. I mean, Trump did what
[57:20] Cyrus did,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; right?"
[57:23] &gt;&gt; And on the reverse side, there's a third
[57:24] temple. Now, I know we joke around this,
[57:26] that, like him, different, black, white,
[57:27] and different. Don't matter. Obama, not
[57:28] Obama. It doesn't matter. This stuff is
[57:30] silly. This world's not my home. I'm
[57:32] voting for King Jesus.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; My allegiance stands there.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It's not on any one man. White, black,
[57:39] brown, I don't care. I don't care if a
[57:41] if a Hispanic gets in office. It's not
[57:42] going to do me any world of good.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[57:46] Except that every day would be Cinco de
[57:48] Mayo. I mean, that's about all.
[57:51] Make siestas legal. You know,
[57:55] &gt;&gt; the peso might get a little bit
[57:56] stronger. Just forget it. All right. But
[57:59] I want you to see something here. A
[58:00] while back when I was preaching the
[58:01] tabernacle, the Lord put on my heart uh
[58:03] when there was this anniversary of the
[58:05] seven seals being revealed. And the Lord
[58:08] put in my heart, it happened to me that
[58:10] one time, brother uh uh Jack, where
[58:12] everything fell in sequence. And when a
[58:14] meeting was on Monday, it was on Monday,
[58:16] Tuesday. Remember that when it happened
[58:17] a while back? And so, uh, I set out to
[58:20] read each sermon at the same time, at
[58:23] the same day that he did on purpose. And
[58:25] I think brother Alzer, you and I did
[58:27] that. You did that with me, didn't you?
[58:28] He got himself a seal book, went in my
[58:30] office at the house where I was living
[58:31] at the time where y'all stayed with us.
[58:34] And um, and we sat there and we went
[58:36] through each service. And uh, brother,
[58:38] the Lord put on my heart to to find what
[58:41] else is there. What else is there?
[58:43] Because people uh and I got nothing
[58:45] against this. Everybody wants to talk
[58:47] about the horse rider and uh what this
[58:49] means and what that means. And that's
[58:50] fine.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. But let me
[58:53] explain something real quick. The horse
[58:55] rider the horse rider is a is a is an
[58:59] authority on an a power on an authority.
[59:01] Is that right?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; And the rider changes horses. It changes
[59:05] colors and different things. In other
[59:06] words, different powers, different
[59:07] authorities, but the same person does
[59:09] all of them. You understand that? But
[59:11] here's what I want you to understand
[59:12] here. Those things would happen whether
[59:15] or not you and I knew about it or not.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Whether it was revealed or not, it would
[59:20] still take place.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord allowed brother Brandon to
[59:23] reveal those things to us so we wouldn't
[59:24] be in ignorance. We would be uh
[59:26] spiritually intelligent, if you will. Uh
[59:28] we would know the time, season, and so
[59:30] forth. We talked about that a little bit
[59:31] last night. But I got to thinking, and I
[59:34] don't mean this disrespectful. It's
[59:35] going to kind of sound that way, but my
[59:37] mindset was big deal
[59:39] &gt;&gt; because we know it now. The world knows
[59:41] it. Everybody knows it. So, what what
[59:44] defines bride and what defines people
[59:46] who know what we know?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Because this is now common knowledge.
[59:49] This is not this is not something uh by
[59:51] the way, you know, the pale color in
[59:53] there is green. Correct?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; It's a shade of green. Y'all know that.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Did you? Well, it is. And now, if you
[59:59] didn't know it, now you know it. But did
[1:00:01] you ever wonder that all the countries
[1:00:02] that surround Israel, did you ever
[1:00:04] notice the similarities of their flag
[1:00:06] colors?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; They're all black, white, red, and
[1:00:10] green,
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; For horse riders, powers, and they're
[1:00:16] all out there to seek and destroy
[1:00:18] Israel. And if we happen to get caught
[1:00:20] up in the mix, we'll get knocked out,
[1:00:21] too. Now, so what does that mean to you?
[1:00:24] Well, I'm saying this. I wanted to find
[1:00:25] out what else did brother Brandham say.
[1:00:28] Now, I'm going to need some interactions
[1:00:29] with some amens. If you got if you got
[1:00:30] them, if you got a bag, amens, throw
[1:00:32] them out here. All right.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you something. Now, did
[1:00:35] did brother Brandham when he got up and
[1:00:36] he preached. Now, if you pay attention
[1:00:38] to the seals when brother Brandham got
[1:00:40] up for uh and began to talk now, he said
[1:00:43] these things. He said the angel of the
[1:00:45] Lord came in the same night and wrote
[1:00:47] that down. Write this, write that, write
[1:00:49] this.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. So, Brother Brandham knew
[1:00:52] what the seal was
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; before he got there.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So, then why did he take so long to get
[1:00:58] there?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:01:00] Did you ever watch if you're listening
[1:01:02] to the first seal, it's this, it's that,
[1:01:04] it's this, it's reference to this, and
[1:01:05] let's go here and let's look there.
[1:01:06] Let's turn to this page here. Let's go
[1:01:08] to this book here. Let's go to that
[1:01:09] Bible scripture. And then at the end, 10
[1:01:10] minutes, 15 minutes, boom, and there's
[1:01:12] your first seal. And he's excited. It's
[1:01:13] all over with.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Why'd he do it like that? If he knew it,
[1:01:17] why not just, you know, 10 minutes, I'm
[1:01:19] done.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Prayer line time, right?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; No, there had to be something else going
[1:01:24] on. And so I talked to Brother Green
[1:01:25] like that. said, I said, "Brother
[1:01:26] Green," he goes, "Well," he said,
[1:01:27] "Caleb, Brother Brandham did say, he
[1:01:30] said that, I know there's something
[1:01:31] going on here, but I can count on my
[1:01:33] hand how many of you are catching up
[1:01:34] what's going on." That's right.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He also said there was people sitting on
[1:01:38] the edge of their seats, waiting for
[1:01:41] thus revelations, and excusing, not even
[1:01:44] How many times you hear him say, "Write
[1:01:45] this down. If you want to write that
[1:01:46] down, if you want to write this down,
[1:01:47] but they weren't writing that stuff
[1:01:48] down. They were they were waiting for
[1:01:50] what's the seal."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:54] So I started listening to it and I
[1:01:56] realized something that the revelation
[1:01:58] of the first seal begins at paragraph
[1:02:00] one okay
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; of the first seal and ends at the last
[1:02:04] paragraph of the first seal.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; The revelation of se the second seal
[1:02:08] begins at paragraph 1 and it ends at the
[1:02:11] end of the second seal. The par the
[1:02:13] revelation of 3 4 5 6 and 7 each at the
[1:02:15] very beginning and at the end. In other
[1:02:18] words, every word that the prophet
[1:02:20] utters out of his mouth in this seal is
[1:02:22] the revelation of the entire first,
[1:02:24] second, third seal. You get it?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; The problem with all of us is that we're
[1:02:28] sitting here trying to dress ourselves
[1:02:30] with a horse ride of revelation, but
[1:02:32] that's like half a shoe on the wrong
[1:02:34] foot. There is more to this than that.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; There are things in there that he said
[1:02:41] that I thought to me holds more truth,
[1:02:44] Brother Smiley, than knowing who the
[1:02:45] horse rider is. There's stuff in there
[1:02:47] that means more to me as a person. In
[1:02:49] other words, what I have to do to
[1:02:52] prepare myself to get from here to
[1:02:55] there.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I did say prepare myself because
[1:02:58] the Bible said the wife has made herself
[1:03:01] ready.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody gets the bride dressed. You all,
[1:03:06] you sisters have been married. You go in
[1:03:07] there and you got an outfit on. You
[1:03:08] might have a few people help you here
[1:03:10] and there, but the man don't see you,
[1:03:11] the husband don't see you, the best man
[1:03:13] don't see you, the minister don't see
[1:03:14] you, your dad don't see you. You're in
[1:03:16] there by yourself getting prepared for a
[1:03:18] wedding.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And the same approach is with the groom.
[1:03:21] Is that right? We're all trying to keep
[1:03:22] the best man whose job is to try to keep
[1:03:24] the group from running out the side
[1:03:25] door.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Right. Now, watch this. So, I went
[1:03:31] through this and I started to comb
[1:03:33] through the seals here and I started to
[1:03:35] find things that say, you know what,
[1:03:36] that registers something to me. That
[1:03:38] means something to me. And I find out
[1:03:40] that there is a mystery within a mystery
[1:03:43] within a mystery tied into these seven
[1:03:45] seals. And if you go back, I want to
[1:03:47] just kind of wet your your lips a little
[1:03:49] bit. And hopefully you'll go back.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And you'll begin to read the seals.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And if you don't got a seal book, you
[1:03:56] should. If you don't, go order yourself
[1:03:58] one.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the voice of God's got
[1:04:01] an influx of seal orders. I wonder
[1:04:03] wherever I'm going preaching this
[1:04:04] because I'm curious about it. But go and
[1:04:06] start reading through it.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; All right? And instead of finding what
[1:04:10] I've showed you or what this one shows
[1:04:11] you, say, "Lord, show something to me
[1:04:13] that is scriptural and is backed up by
[1:04:16] the verse of God or by the scripture of
[1:04:18] God, by the spirit of God, and shows me
[1:04:21] this is what you need to do to
[1:04:23] understand who you are."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Now, would you like to hear one?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear one?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; So, I found one in here, and I thought
[1:04:30] it was very interesting. I said, you
[1:04:32] know, I've heard this before and I've
[1:04:34] read this before in the book of First
[1:04:35] John and uh chapter 1, chapter 2, and so
[1:04:38] forth, but I want to read this here.
[1:04:40] There's something strange that that just
[1:04:42] stuck that struck my heart when I read
[1:04:44] it the first time uh over and over
[1:04:47] again. It still gets me now. This is in
[1:04:48] the first seal. All right.
[1:04:52] He begins to call now in the seals. He
[1:04:54] officially calls his bride in the seals.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, he's done said it before
[1:04:58] and he said it many times after. But in
[1:05:00] the seals is when he says, "I'm no
[1:05:01] longer going to call you church. I'm
[1:05:03] going to call you bride."
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Right? And even he goes back and forth
[1:05:07] saying church a couple of times. Are you
[1:05:08] with me now this morning?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hurry now. Let me relax.
[1:05:13] All right. Okay. And he goes here. He
[1:05:15] says, "And Christ and the church, the
[1:05:18] bride, not the church. The bride and the
[1:05:22] church.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Christ and the queen." Uhoh. Now he's
[1:05:25] put it somewhere else. All right.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Christ and the bride stood there. Stood
[1:05:29] where? We're standing in a place of
[1:05:31] judgment. Not being judged, but judging
[1:05:33] the earth.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; This is one of the first times I
[1:05:37] realized that I don't have to be judged.
[1:05:39] I'm not going to be judged because I'm
[1:05:40] going through my judgment right here,
[1:05:42] right now in this lifetime.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Now, for those of you who for those of
[1:05:48] us who fear the white throne judgment,
[1:05:50] you don't have to fear the white throne
[1:05:52] judgment anymore.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; All right? That's right.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You do not stand before God as a judge.
[1:05:58] You are standing next to God as a judge.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, how do you know you're
[1:06:05] going to be a judge? Because however you
[1:06:07] give people grace today, that's how
[1:06:09] you're going to pertain yourself or
[1:06:11] that's how you're going to conduct
[1:06:12] yourself when you're on the side of
[1:06:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; If you're a judgmental individual here,
[1:06:18] most likely you will not be a judge over
[1:06:20] there.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] That's right.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; If you are a gracious and merciful
[1:06:26] person here, most likely you're going to
[1:06:29] be a judge over there.
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that are full
[1:06:35] of mercy, grace, and justice.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Sometimes justice is harsh. Sometimes
[1:06:42] justice is pure. It should be always
[1:06:45] pure. I meant to say or is merciful, but
[1:06:47] it should always be pure. Whatsoever
[1:06:50] things you say, whatsoever things you
[1:06:52] do, whatsoever things you believe in,
[1:06:54] whatsoever things you are talking about,
[1:06:56] whatsoever things you're living for, let
[1:06:58] it be truth.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry about building other
[1:07:04] people up and reputations of others.
[1:07:05] Build up your own reputation, but not
[1:07:08] just yours, but Christ and him crucified
[1:07:10] inside of your life.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; We're too busy building up other
[1:07:15] platforms for other people.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. See, now you
[1:07:20] misunderstood. You think I mean that
[1:07:22] people sitting around, you know,
[1:07:24] building my platform for Amazing Grace
[1:07:25] Temple.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; No, no. I mean, you're building up an
[1:07:28] Instagram platform. You're building up a
[1:07:30] a a Telegram platform.
[1:07:34] I believe in that now. I guess
[1:07:37] you're building up a a a Tik Tok
[1:07:39] platform. You're building up a
[1:07:40] following. All these influencers. And
[1:07:43] here's the thing. You got to understand
[1:07:44] something. They're influencers. They're
[1:07:46] there to influence you. That does not
[1:07:48] mean that they live the way you think
[1:07:50] they do.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Their life could be just as fraudulent
[1:07:58] as yours, if not more so.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because there's a platform we
[1:08:04] call church.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And we try to build an image of who we
[1:08:07] are at church.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; But you see, here is just like a a
[1:08:11] social media. You could be here and
[1:08:13] you're doing all hallelujah and all this
[1:08:15] and when you get home you ain't that
[1:08:17] hallelujah person at all.
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; If you're going to build a following,
[1:08:27] stop following people to follow you.
[1:08:29] Follow Jesus Christ.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; All right, you with me now? Now, brother
[1:08:38] Brown didn't say any of that in the
[1:08:40] seals,
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; but see those little statements there
[1:08:43] prompt all that there.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I'll go on here. He said, uh, he said,
[1:08:47] "If they heard the truth, truth." Okay.
[1:08:48] Okay. He says, "And if they heard the
[1:08:50] truth and rejected the truth, when, uh,
[1:08:53] then what's going to be said when the
[1:08:56] big thing is spread across the canvas."
[1:08:59] I like this. When even your own thoughts
[1:09:02] will be there.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Wow.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; I need God's grace, don't you?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; The wonder of the angel of the Lord
[1:09:10] said, "Tell the people to be careful how
[1:09:13] they think."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being up there and you
[1:09:21] don't make it and your wife goes, "I
[1:09:22] didn't know you thought that way about
[1:09:23] me."
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; You see how careful we have to be this
[1:09:29] day and age? Yes,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we do. All right,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; let me do this. All right. And uh says
[1:09:35] here uh uh because how are you going to
[1:09:37] escape it? And right there on the canvas
[1:09:39] of the skies and God's great television
[1:09:41] there, it's your own thoughts rebelling
[1:09:44] again. Oh my god. Your own thoughts
[1:09:46] rebelling. Your own thoughts will speak
[1:09:50] against you in that hour.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Can you be condemned by your own
[1:09:56] thoughts?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I got the young people looking kind of
[1:09:59] scared all of a sudden. But you see, you
[1:10:02] already forgot. I said something a
[1:10:03] minute ago. If you're judging, if you
[1:10:06] are in Christ, you're not going to be
[1:10:08] judged. You will be judging.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I just got this rebound, so it's a
[1:10:12] little tight still.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; I I couldn't get rid of my old book,
[1:10:15] Brother Jack.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; So, I had it customized.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I got some ribbons put on this bad boy.
[1:10:20] Seven of them. Oh, yeah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; But now it's all tight now. But now, I
[1:10:27] got you all afraid of the judgment. Now,
[1:10:28] see, but let me show you something.
[1:10:31] Here's what I want to get to.
[1:10:41] What do you have to be purified from
[1:10:45] when you are perfectly in Christ?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Sinless.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Now, the room got quiet and didn't
[1:10:55] understand what I just said. I'm saying
[1:10:57] to you that we are talking about people
[1:11:00] who are going to stand in front of Jesus
[1:11:02] Christ and the queen and whom I hope you
[1:11:06] believe that you are a part of
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; because you are now sinless.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it now?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; All right. You're sinless now. All this
[1:11:19] where'd you get this, Caleb? I got this
[1:11:21] in the first seal.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; But what does that got to do with the
[1:11:25] horse rider? Nothing.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to tell you. At
[1:11:29] the end of this, when everybody's
[1:11:30] waiting for the cra for the punch line,
[1:11:32] my punch line was barely onethird of the
[1:11:34] way through. I found out that I was not
[1:11:36] full of sin. That when I accepted Jesus,
[1:11:38] I became sinless.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; First John began to live for a
[1:11:47] Christian, for a believer who who is in
[1:11:49] Christ, who is in Jesus, does not sin.
[1:11:53] Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my my
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Perfectly sinless. How? He said, "How?
[1:12:01] What's the judgment for it?" But it's
[1:12:03] it's that sleeping bunch
[1:12:06] and them people that can't make it out.
[1:12:08] Are you with me now? So, he shows us
[1:12:10] here that we are perfectly sinless in
[1:12:13] Christ Jesus. I hope you got that. I
[1:12:15] hope that was good for you.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not done. I got a few more here. If
[1:12:19] you don't mind, I'm going to sit this
[1:12:20] over here.
[1:12:22] All right. Now, I got some more. You
[1:12:26] want some more? Yes,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Did you know And do you realize that
[1:12:30] people are looking for a book?
[1:12:34] People are looking for a lamb's book of
[1:12:35] life.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a book of life.
[1:12:40] Brother Smiley, I don't mean to hit
[1:12:42] knock you or Brother Jack as you all
[1:12:44] preachers or any other preacher in the
[1:12:45] room, but I I mean to tell you if you
[1:12:47] don't know, look this look this up for
[1:12:49] yourself. There is actually, in my
[1:12:50] opinion, and if there is a literal book,
[1:12:52] a literal book, I have no no problem
[1:12:54] with that. But I do not believe it's a
[1:12:56] literal book.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going explain it to you here in a
[1:12:59] little bit. It says in the Bible, I will
[1:13:00] meet you in the volume of the book. Oh
[1:13:02] man, there's so many mysteries tied up
[1:13:04] right then and there. You're trying to
[1:13:06] figure this whole thing out. Like, where
[1:13:07] is this at? Then where is my name
[1:13:08] written? And how is it not removed? How
[1:13:10] is it this and how is it that? Well,
[1:13:12] didn't Paul say that you are written
[1:13:14] epistles read of all men?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Then doesn't that make you a book?
[1:13:19] Doesn't that make you a chapter in the
[1:13:21] book of God?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you get your name in there,
[1:13:24] though? How do you how do you get your
[1:13:25] name? Don't you think that God knows
[1:13:27] exactly who you are?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; How are How are you able to be written
[1:13:32] out of the book of life, but not in the
[1:13:33] lamb's book of life, which you always
[1:13:35] are in? See,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; now, let me let me just kind of get here
[1:13:38] to this, brother Jack. I might be done
[1:13:41] 30 minutes.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; I want to hit it,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; but I don't like the way the devil's
[1:13:46] trying to hinder things. I can feel his
[1:13:47] spirit kind of uneasy and it ain't you
[1:13:50] and it's not me, it's him and he's
[1:13:51] getting scared cuz he has to leave and
[1:13:53] he doesn't like leaving.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; But it's like the brother up here said
[1:13:57] earlier, I know who I am
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and and and and even though you know who
[1:14:02] you are, he's not going to leave you
[1:14:03] alone. I wish he'd get a revelation and
[1:14:05] figure it out, but he's not going to.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But see, I've been invited to the Lord's
[1:14:09] house to eat.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; the devil's never been invited.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to be invited.
[1:14:16] He says here, "Did you know?" Brother
[1:14:18] Brown said, "Now, this is a nugget that
[1:14:20] I pulled out of the second seal." Now,
[1:14:22] this one is really exciting and it gets
[1:14:24] me every single time because it finds
[1:14:25] out it made me find out that I know who
[1:14:28] I am and I'm going to always I've turns
[1:14:30] out I've always known who I am. I want
[1:14:32] you to listen very close.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Are you ready now? He said, "Did you
[1:14:36] know we had false leaders
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; raised up false messiahs before Christ
[1:14:42] come?" Sure. Didn't they? Yes. the
[1:14:45] teacher of that day, that mighty
[1:14:46] teacher, Galia, he go he goes on the
[1:14:49] question, get up about beating these men
[1:14:51] and so forth. I'm going to read it to
[1:14:53] get you to where I got to go. Let them
[1:14:54] alone. If it's of God, why? You'll be f
[1:14:58] you'll be fined fighting against God.
[1:15:01] But if it isn't God, didn't a man raise
[1:15:03] up not long ago, take, what did he say?
[1:15:06] He said, take 400 into the wilderness
[1:15:08] and so forth. We had those things. What
[1:15:10] was it? He said, the forerunning of the
[1:15:12] real thing. That's all it is. When you
[1:15:13] see something fake, there's something
[1:15:15] real coming along.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say something kind of harsh.
[1:15:18] When you see all these false revivals
[1:15:20] around a certain kind of idea and a
[1:15:22] certain kind of thought, then you see
[1:15:23] their leader pass away. Then all of a
[1:15:25] sudden that all kind of fizzles out. It
[1:15:27] was just a a it was just a false before
[1:15:30] the real thing is about to hit.
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; When somebody's work does not continue,
[1:15:38] it's not the person who left fault. It's
[1:15:40] the people who put their faith and their
[1:15:42] belief in the person that started the
[1:15:44] work and didn't have the uncction to
[1:15:46] carry the work on in the right manner
[1:15:48] with the right inspiration with the
[1:15:50] right Holy Ghost with the right
[1:15:51] following with the right feeling with
[1:15:54] the right sealment with the right
[1:15:55] understanding. If you don't have
[1:15:57] revelation you got no business preaching
[1:15:59] what somebody else preached.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That goes for brother Brandham too. And
[1:16:04] I mean this if you don't have a
[1:16:06] revelation of what brother Brandham said
[1:16:07] you shouldn't be quoting it then.
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:13] That's where false doctrines come out
[1:16:14] of.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; See, they start right. Well, brother
[1:16:17] Brandham have said this and brother, oh,
[1:16:18] I got this idea right here. Yeah, but
[1:16:20] you don't even know what he meant by
[1:16:21] that. Well, you do. I prayed about it. I
[1:16:24] studied it. God showed it to me. Found
[1:16:25] out where it fits in the scripture. It
[1:16:27] has to fit from point A to point B. It
[1:16:29] can't just be your own idea.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here.
[1:16:37] He said, "Satan rises raises those up."
[1:16:40] He said, "Watch." I like this word. Ro,
[1:16:43] watch. Watch. Watch the shrewdness of
[1:16:46] this fellow that we're talking about.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Satan, we're here. This is the second
[1:16:51] seal now. See, it's not a horse rider,
[1:16:54] but I'm showing you a nugget that's been
[1:16:56] there the whole time.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Huh? He said, "Satan, we're unfolding
[1:17:00] him right here. were stripping him down
[1:17:03] by the scriptures and letting him see
[1:17:05] who and letting you see who he is.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; My brother, it's this. Not only did the
[1:17:11] the seals came to do three things. One,
[1:17:13] to show us Jesus Christ.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Two, to show us the queen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And three, to show us who the enemy is.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, the seals ain't
[1:17:25] about Satan." Oh, it's very much about
[1:17:27] Satan.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; The seals ain't about us. Oh, it's very
[1:17:30] much about us.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; The seals are revealing who I am.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Who you are,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, you're stalling. Yeah,
[1:17:38] just a little bit.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to build your anticipation.
[1:17:42] Go with me right quick. Oh, I know. I'm
[1:17:44] going to stop right in the middle of
[1:17:45] that seal. Go to Go with me to Second
[1:17:47] Timothy verse 2, chapter 19.
[1:17:52] Second Timothy, verse two, and chapter
[1:17:55] 19.
[1:17:58] I like these things here I got from one
[1:18:00] of the preachers back home. Kind of
[1:18:02] threw this into my little my little mix
[1:18:04] right here.
[1:18:12] Oh, brother Jack, we're going to start
[1:18:15] at verse 16. We're going to start at
[1:18:18] verse 16. All right. So, it's chapter 2,
[1:18:20] verse 16. And read, let's read this.
[1:18:22] Look here. It says, "But shun profane
[1:18:25] and vain babblings."
[1:18:27] In other words, what I just said,
[1:18:29] somebody don't know what they're talking
[1:18:30] about.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; It sounds good, but it's not good.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody else is standing and you're
[1:18:34] looking around going, "Why are they
[1:18:36] doing that?" We went to a service one
[1:18:38] time and uh we're watching. Never mind.
[1:18:41] We We were at a service. You got what
[1:18:42] I'm doing, what I said. And we're
[1:18:44] sitting there, and Sister Ann sitting
[1:18:45] there next to me, and uh she come from a
[1:18:47] church uh Jeffersonville that was a a
[1:18:49] woman pastor. Nice lady. Nice lady. She
[1:18:51] got on to be with the Lord. now. But she
[1:18:52] would say a bunch of stuff. I was like,
[1:18:54] "What is she talking about?" And she she
[1:18:56] knew, but then later on when she read
[1:18:59] the supernaturals and found out who
[1:19:00] Brother Brandon was, now that she goes
[1:19:02] back, you're probably just confused as I
[1:19:03] was. All of a sudden, you're like, "What
[1:19:04] are you what are they talking about?"
[1:19:05] Right? What do they mean? What's a love
[1:19:07] chariot? What is, you know, what is the
[1:19:09] Song of Solomon? I don't get what y'all
[1:19:10] are talking about. It's crazy stuff. So,
[1:19:12] we go to this other church. She's a
[1:19:14] message believer now. And we're sitting
[1:19:15] there and uh this brother's saying this
[1:19:17] and he's saying that and he's saying
[1:19:18] this and everybody's standing,
[1:19:20] everybody's clapping. And all of a
[1:19:21] sudden he says, "Why?" Because the white
[1:19:23] horse rider and boom boom boom boom. He
[1:19:25] went all the way down the line and
[1:19:26] everybody's clapping, "Amen. Amen." And
[1:19:28] when it got quiet and they sat down, she
[1:19:30] didn't time it perfectly enough. She
[1:19:32] goes, "What did he just say?"
[1:19:36] And I was like, "I'll
[1:19:38] try to explain it to you later."
[1:19:41] Of course, everybody clapped and kind of
[1:19:42] looked at her like, "Oh, huddy." You
[1:19:44] know, but it was vain babble. He's like,
[1:19:46] "What do you just sput out a bunch of
[1:19:47] stuff, brother? We don't even know what
[1:19:49] you're talking about." Exactly the
[1:19:50] truth.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You We need to have the spirit of truth
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; come back in the room
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; and tell us the truth of the matter.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Are you with me now?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; It says, "So, but but son profane and
[1:20:02] vain babblings, for they will increase
[1:20:05] unto
[1:20:06] ungodliness."
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. 17. And their word and and their
[1:20:12] word will eat us do uh uh eat as canker
[1:20:16] as a canker. In other words, it'll just
[1:20:18] take the very life from you,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; right? Of whom is
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; well, he named two brothers, didn't he?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Heranius and Philippus. You can't even
[1:20:30] say their names, so don't try to quote
[1:20:32] them if you can't even say their names.
[1:20:34] All right.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. who concerning the truth have
[1:20:40] errors, saying that the resurrection
[1:20:44] is passed already.
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Does this sound familiar?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Huh? Has passed already and overthrow
[1:20:56] and and overthrow the faith of uh uh of
[1:20:58] some. In other words, it's passed. And
[1:21:00] he was right. It did pass. There was a
[1:21:02] resurrection, but there's going to be
[1:21:04] another resurrection and then another
[1:21:06] resurrection. Are you with me now? So
[1:21:08] there was a coming and there's going to
[1:21:09] be a coming and there'll be another
[1:21:11] coming. Are you with me now? So there
[1:21:13] was a bride and she was put away and
[1:21:15] there was a bride and she but this Eve
[1:21:17] shall never fail.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; You get how it happens? There's always
[1:21:23] God always does things in threes. If you
[1:21:25] miss the first one, don't worry. There's
[1:21:27] another one coming. If you miss that
[1:21:29] one, that's the one you need to worry
[1:21:30] about because if you're on this one,
[1:21:32] you'll be here for that one. Just hang
[1:21:33] on. All right.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:38] Look here. And then in 19 it says this.
[1:21:41] Nevertheless,
[1:21:43] the foundation of God standeth sure.
[1:21:50] Having this seal.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; You didn't catch it. Having this seal,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; right? The Lord knoweth them that are
[1:22:01] his.
[1:22:03] Yes, sir.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to get a kick out of
[1:22:07] this. I'm going to just keep on going.
[1:22:09] Don't knowing them that are his. All
[1:22:11] right. All right. All right. I'm too
[1:22:13] excited. Calm down. And let everyone
[1:22:15] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[1:22:18] from iniquity.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I like this. Our brother, one of
[1:22:22] our brothers back home taught us this.
[1:22:23] I'm I'm going to borrow it from him. And
[1:22:25] whether he likes it or not, I'm going to
[1:22:26] tell him there's nothing new under the
[1:22:27] sun, brother. So, be quiet.
[1:22:31] But in good but in a great house there
[1:22:33] are not only uh vessels of go of of gold
[1:22:37] and of silver but also of wood and of
[1:22:40] earth and some of honor and some of
[1:22:42] dishonor. It's going to happen in every
[1:22:44] work.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; If a man therefore puh purge himself
[1:22:51] from these, he shall be a vessel unto
[1:22:54] honor, sanctified and meat for the
[1:22:57] master's use.
[1:22:59] and prepared unto every good work.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; All right. God knows who are his.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Watch the shrew. Going back to this
[1:23:13] here. Watch the shrewdness of this
[1:23:15] fellow.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; We're we are we're talking about here
[1:23:19] Satan. We're unfold where we're
[1:23:22] unfolding him right here. just stripping
[1:23:25] him down by the scriptures and letting
[1:23:28] you see who he is. That's what that is
[1:23:31] what's supposed to be done. Oh my. And
[1:23:34] you remember he has not tried to go in
[1:23:38] as a communist. Satan hasn't. He is an
[1:23:42] antichrist.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; So close that he would deceive the very
[1:23:47] elected. Then he stops right there. You
[1:23:50] guys got this on the board.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, go on. Oh, good for you. Okay, then
[1:23:54] he stops right there. He said the
[1:23:56] elected and we all know what the rest of
[1:23:58] it would deceive the very elected if it
[1:24:01] were
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; possible.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; So that means that it is not
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; but if it were
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; possible
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; but it's not
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; possible. Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And then he says this, "And that's the
[1:24:13] ones big O." The ones who
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; the ones who
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. The ones that has hid down in
[1:24:23] those seals.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Uhhuh. Uhuh. You didn't get it.
[1:24:30] Those are the ones whose hid down in
[1:24:33] those seals, whose names are on the book
[1:24:37] since the foundation of the world.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Are you sure you got this?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Where was it written?
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Show me Revelation chapter 6 and show me
[1:24:52] where your name's at.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Show me chapter 7. Where's your name?
[1:24:56] Show me chapter 8. Where's your name at?
[1:24:58] Your name's not in there.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Your name's not in there. But according
[1:25:02] to brother Bowen, I found this nugget in
[1:25:04] the seals here. He said, "Your name was
[1:25:06] written in the second seal before the
[1:25:08] foundation of the world, and it was hid
[1:25:11] there."
[1:25:13] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham didn't say it like this,
[1:25:18] but I'm going to tell you, it's not G.
[1:25:20] It's not a seal like a scroll up. When
[1:25:22] when Jesus revealed the seals to the
[1:25:25] brother of Brandham, when the angels of
[1:25:26] God came down and said, "This one and
[1:25:29] this one and this one." Do you
[1:25:30] understand that it was Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] pulling one tab off and another tab off
[1:25:34] and another tab off? It was Jesus
[1:25:36] revealing Jesus in seven parts to the
[1:25:39] prophet of this age.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; When your name was written on the last
[1:25:47] book of life, your name was written on
[1:25:50] his heart.
[1:25:56] Your name has been written there and and
[1:26:00] hidden since before the foundation of
[1:26:02] the world.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I'm a little confused at why everybody
[1:26:04] else is not as happy as I was when I
[1:26:06] read that.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Your name has what? What's your name,
[1:26:10] lady?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got two Abigails. How many? Let
[1:26:13] me see. All the Abigails stand up. All
[1:26:15] the Abigail stand up. Okay, that's a Don
[1:26:18] and that's a
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; a what?
[1:26:22] Say like you're proud girl.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; All right. You got this one and that
[1:26:25] one. And both these Abigails whose names
[1:26:28] were hidden since before the foundation
[1:26:30] of the world.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; We got a Jack Duff right here. And his
[1:26:37] name was written in the seals before the
[1:26:39] foundation of the world.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; We got a Jeff Smith over here. And
[1:26:43] there's a lot of Smiths. Let's be
[1:26:45] honest.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; There's some white ones, some black
[1:26:47] ones, and I'm pretty sure there's an
[1:26:49] Asian Smith someplace.
[1:26:53] There's got to be there's got to be an
[1:26:55] Asian Puerto Rican Smith someplace,
[1:26:57] right? But Jeff Smith's name was written
[1:27:00] on the seals and hidden there before the
[1:27:02] foundation of the world.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Caleb, when did it get
[1:27:09] revealed? When when Jesus Christ broke
[1:27:11] open them seals, when polar bear broke
[1:27:13] over the seals, your name was released
[1:27:18] and it still did not find its mark to
[1:27:20] the day you went goooo gaga wah wah.
[1:27:23] When your name was Caleb Don then God
[1:27:25] said that's one of my that's one of my
[1:27:28] that's one of my
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. Glory.
[1:27:37] And it's been there
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; hidden
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; in those seals.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And if you Oh, I love the mystery of it.
[1:27:46] Go ahead and read all the Revelation 6,7
[1:27:49] and 8. You won't see your name anywhere,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; but it was there.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; It was there
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; the whole time.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Because you were with him the whole
[1:28:03] time.
[1:28:07] Hallelujah.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He knows who are sealed.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He knows whose are his.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; So why are you sitting here all tossed
[1:28:16] about?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; When I told you that I know who I am, I
[1:28:19] know who I am because I saw that in the
[1:28:21] second seal.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; The second seal opened up to me and it
[1:28:26] told me who I was.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Well, in the second seal, well, it's all
[1:28:30] through the seals, brother. I don't know
[1:28:31] what part of it you got released, but
[1:28:32] I'm pretty sure I came out when the
[1:28:34] seventh seal was opened up. Here I here
[1:28:35] come my part. I don't know when it was,
[1:28:37] but your names were written there
[1:28:38] anyhow.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote here.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm already done. I'm not even
[1:28:47] playing with you. I didn't come to I
[1:28:49] didn't come here to put up a Caleb show.
[1:28:50] I came here to give you God's word and
[1:28:51] walk off.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Your name is in those seals.
[1:29:01] When brother who would have thought, let
[1:29:02] me get you this. Let me ask you this
[1:29:03] one. When you were sitting there and you
[1:29:05] heard how many when you heard the seals
[1:29:07] for the first time, do you ever actually
[1:29:09] hear your name come out?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; No. Did you realize it though? You don't
[1:29:14] have to give me a show of hands, but I
[1:29:16] almost can promise you how many of you
[1:29:17] have never really read that before.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You've read over it. You've read through
[1:29:21] it, but you never stopped and said, "You
[1:29:22] know what? Do you want to know what
[1:29:23] never was revealed to me, Brother Jack?
[1:29:26] When I was sitting there preaching, my
[1:29:28] my folks will tell you I was preaching.
[1:29:30] I say, "Hold on. Give me a second. Wait,
[1:29:32] give me one minute." And I was reading
[1:29:33] again. I go, "I just want to make sure I
[1:29:35] read this the right way."
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And then I read it and we just had an we
[1:29:39] just had a field day with it.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Because we had ne I had never seen that
[1:29:44] before. All right.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Now, in a different message, Christ the
[1:29:49] mystery of God revealed, he says here,
[1:29:52] he says here, he says, "Now you see
[1:29:54] those seals when he's in his
[1:29:56] meditational work back there redeeming,
[1:29:59] but someday he comes forth to get this
[1:30:02] book." What book? His bride book.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; It's not a book like this is a book or
[1:30:09] that's a book. It's we are the book.
[1:30:12] Yeah.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; He comes back to get this book that he's
[1:30:14] redeemed.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I heard uh Brother Randy, Brother Randy,
[1:30:19] Brother Randy said the other day, he
[1:30:20] said, "Now, I'm going to say something
[1:30:22] kind of plain, and I hope you're not
[1:30:23] offended." He said, "But there's Adam in
[1:30:25] the Garden of Eden and his wife." He
[1:30:27] said, "They're walking this before they
[1:30:28] fell." This before they fell now. And he
[1:30:30] said, "Here they are." The Bible said
[1:30:32] they were not clothed. They were naked.
[1:30:33] Is that right?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; So, was Adam walking around naked with a
[1:30:36] book under his arm?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I know it sounds crude, but it's a
[1:30:40] question. Right?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible, brother Brown said
[1:30:43] that Adam had that book.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; So where'd he keep that book at?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a book. He was the book of
[1:30:51] redemption.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; He lost the title deed
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; because he had to. And then that was
[1:30:58] forfeited and Jesus became the book of
[1:31:00] redemption.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? It went back to
[1:31:03] the father till Jesus was born. And when
[1:31:05] Jesus was born, he took back the title
[1:31:06] deed and the book of redemption. And
[1:31:09] before he could claim it, he had to go
[1:31:10] back to where he's at now. Do the
[1:31:12] meditational uh uh medial
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; thank you work that he has to do. And
[1:31:17] then when the rap the body change
[1:31:19] happens, the resurrection and the
[1:31:21] rapture forth that he comes back to take
[1:31:22] back the book that he had redeemed
[1:31:24] already.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; It's not coming back for a book under
[1:31:28] his arm, brothers. He's coming back for
[1:31:30] you and for me.
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:39] Hallelujah.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:42] Come back for the book he's redeemed and
[1:31:45] all that's in this book would be him.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. So he's coming back for
[1:31:53] himself. Yes, he's coming back for
[1:31:56] himself.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, it gets better.
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:03] So you mean to So brother Caleb, you're
[1:32:05] telling me that when my name was
[1:32:06] released, when my man my name was hidden
[1:32:08] in the seals? Let me let me get this
[1:32:10] straight. My name was hidden in the
[1:32:11] seals. Yes. And Jesus name was Jesus was
[1:32:13] in the seals. Yes. Jesus is the seals.
[1:32:15] Yes. And my name was there. Yes. Then
[1:32:17] that makes me the seals. Yes.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me
[1:32:21] that the bride and Jesus are the seven
[1:32:23] seals? Yes.
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:28] and he's coming back for that book.
[1:32:31] That's every part of himself.
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hey, so you see how now I say I know
[1:32:42] that I'm going to make it.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; This is not a walk by faith, brother
[1:32:46] Jack. This is a walk that I know that I
[1:32:48] know that I know I'm going to make it.
[1:32:54] I am that book of redemption. I've been
[1:32:56] redeemed because I'm in there.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; You can't stop the fire now.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You can't stop it now.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; I am the book
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; because he is the book.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; If he's coming back for himself, he's
[1:33:21] coming back for me. And that means that
[1:33:23] Jesus cannot leave without me,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; without you, without amazing grace
[1:33:30] temple, without spirit of truth. He
[1:33:32] cannot leave without any part that
[1:33:35] belongs to himself.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Let me finish this here.
[1:33:50] All and all that's in the book would be
[1:33:54] him. For that's the believer.
[1:33:58] The words in the book and the word is
[1:34:02] him and all that's in that.
[1:34:06] He come forth for the book of redemption
[1:34:10] whose names are written on that book
[1:34:13] before the foundation of the world when
[1:34:16] he was slain as the lamb. Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; So, you mean he had said this before?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; No, he said it right after. He said in
[1:34:27] the seals, he says, "In Christ, the
[1:34:29] mystery of God revealed." He continues
[1:34:31] to hold to that revelation
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; that those names were already there in
[1:34:36] the seals.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, how have we all missed
[1:34:39] this all this time? Right?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; That don't make you any less of a
[1:34:42] preacher or a pastor
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; or me. It don't make me any greater of a
[1:34:47] pastor or a leader. What it means that
[1:34:49] it's been hidden
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; and kept a mystery
[1:34:53] until this time
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; when his words come back to me and say,
[1:34:57] "I'm going to visit you according to the
[1:34:59] time of life."
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And the bride is going to give forth
[1:35:03] another life.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; What life is that? It's the life behind
[1:35:08] the name that makes the demons tremble.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; It's the life behind the name that
[1:35:15] causes proud hearts to humble. It was
[1:35:18] Christ who devised the plan that in all
[1:35:20] ways as a man that he would live so he
[1:35:24] could give give us the life behind the
[1:35:28] name.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I know they said there was a bunch
[1:35:32] of there was a lot of people named Jesus
[1:35:34] before Jesus was born. I don't find any
[1:35:37] history of that. There may been, there
[1:35:39] may not have been, but I know since then
[1:35:42] there's been plenty of Jesus walking
[1:35:43] around,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; right? And some basketball players that
[1:35:47] got the nerve to be called Jesus,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; named Jesus, call himself King of Kings.
[1:35:52] They need then then they wonder why they
[1:35:53] got a knee injury or a tendon tear and
[1:35:55] they can't play no more.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You know, God will share his glory with
[1:35:59] nobody.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You can't give nobody credit for getting
[1:36:02] you to Jesus. Someone say, "Well, I I I
[1:36:05] I'll always be supportive for brother
[1:36:06] Caleb Don because he got me to the
[1:36:07] Lord." No. The spirit of God got you to
[1:36:09] the spirit of the Lord.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; The man didn't do nothing. I'm just a
[1:36:12] vessel. I'm just a tool. But I didn't
[1:36:14] lead you to Christ. Christ led you to
[1:36:16] Christ.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; You watch any famous speaker. You
[1:36:22] watching, they're trying to try to try
[1:36:24] to build their kingdom around themselves
[1:36:25] and what they've done. You watch how
[1:36:26] quickly they fall.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Look at all these guys. Cleo, what's his
[1:36:30] name? Cle what's it? What's his name?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Cre low dollar. Like so like like cleave
[1:36:35] to a dollar. That's what it sounds like.
[1:36:39] Why anybody would trust a preacher named
[1:36:40] Dollar. I have no idea.
[1:36:43] I wouldn't trust him if he was a real
[1:36:45] estate agent, let alone a preacher.
[1:36:47] Who's your real estate guy? Dollar. Oh
[1:36:50] no. No. No. Find me somebody that says
[1:36:53] cent or something. You know, he going to
[1:36:55] charge me cents on the dollar, not
[1:36:57] dollar on the dollar. Come on. Why you
[1:36:59] want to Why Why you want to go Joel
[1:37:00] Ostein? He retired. How you going to
[1:37:01] retire at 45? What's the matter with
[1:37:03] you?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz they got money.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; They're They're not That's not That's
[1:37:08] not a That's not a Well, you know,
[1:37:10] Brother Jack, it's kind of hard to say
[1:37:11] this being preachers cuz we don't have a
[1:37:13] whole lot of it. But having money
[1:37:15] doesn't make you successful.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I've had brothers say they're going to
[1:37:20] win the lottery for me.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I said, "Okay, well, that's all right.
[1:37:24] If you get all your bills paid, Brother
[1:37:25] Green told me that wasn't gambling." He
[1:37:26] said, "That's just exchanging one
[1:37:28] worthless piece of paper for another
[1:37:29] worthless piece of paper.
[1:37:33] He said, "If you can afford to waste one
[1:37:35] piece of paper on another piece of
[1:37:36] paper, you go right ahead."
[1:37:38] But here's the problem I had. I said,
[1:37:39] "If we win, I mean, if you all win
[1:37:46] and you give it to me and word gets out,
[1:37:50] well then I'm rich because somebody
[1:37:52] played the lottery."
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I built my church because someone gave
[1:37:56] me money from a lottery.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Where's the
[1:37:59] glory in that?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So I tell the brothers, don't play too
[1:38:03] big, fellas.
[1:38:09] Don't come at me with billions. Come at
[1:38:11] me with a few thousand. It'll be all
[1:38:12] right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Keep it humble.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying the success you cannot
[1:38:17] point to any man.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; God will share his glory with nobody.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus is not going to Jesus will not be
[1:38:23] outshined by anybody.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Even his queen will not outshine Jesus.
[1:38:28] But the light that the queen has belongs
[1:38:30] to Jesus Christ anyhow. It's the life
[1:38:33] behind the name.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "And here he is today in his
[1:38:39] word manifesting the same thing he did
[1:38:41] there. She can't recognize another
[1:38:45] headship." That's what he said.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You wonder why these big men and
[1:38:50] dignitaries, why their movements don't
[1:38:52] last or why their ministries kind of
[1:38:54] fizzle out because they're sharing their
[1:38:57] headship
[1:38:59] or excuse me, because she is claiming
[1:39:02] them as their head as as her head. And
[1:39:05] you can't have that.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; God won't let you have another head. You
[1:39:10] have one head, and that's Christ.
[1:39:14] There's no bishop. There's no nothing.
[1:39:17] She recognizes one headship. That's
[1:39:20] Christ. And Christ is the word. He said,
[1:39:22] "I love that." Yes, sir. Christ is the
[1:39:25] word.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Now listen. He said, "Fallen angels."
[1:39:32] What kind of angels?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let uh Luther Wesley Catholic
[1:39:37] Pentecostals who kept not their first
[1:39:39] estate like the angels did." I think
[1:39:41] this is strange. He calls them angels.
[1:39:45] I think it's strange to me how he does
[1:39:47] it. He said, "What have they done?" He
[1:39:49] said, "Lucifer, the main the main hold
[1:39:51] of Na. And what have they done?
[1:39:54] Organized a great economical council
[1:39:56] associated ministers behind them." Now,
[1:39:59] he didn't call them false angels. as he
[1:40:02] goes on, an image like unto the beast
[1:40:05] and a building a c a Christian economy
[1:40:08] that'll close the doors of this church
[1:40:10] and others like it. In other words, this
[1:40:12] that the ministries were fine but the
[1:40:14] organiz organizations around it became
[1:40:16] as a fallen angel just like Lucifer.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; What happened? They sold out their
[1:40:22] headship.
[1:40:24] Wow.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; He says here, what do they do in
[1:40:28] paragraph 552? Sold out to reasonings
[1:40:32] and wisdoms and education
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; like Eve did. Fallen angels did that.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Wesley was a man of God. But what
[1:40:41] followed him? Fallen angels got into it.
[1:40:43] What was the angels first? Creative
[1:40:46] beings of God, but fell for Lucifer's
[1:40:49] wisdom.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Right?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You got these people standing up and and
[1:40:55] I don't have a problem with it, but
[1:40:56] they're trying to get people to Christ.
[1:40:58] But you're not going to get people to
[1:40:59] Christ because of your wisdom
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; because you can outsmart somebody,
[1:41:03] because you're educated or anything like
[1:41:04] this. You're going to do it by a life.
[1:41:06] You We can talk. We need to be
[1:41:07] witnesses. How many needs to be a
[1:41:08] witness?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We need to introduce people to Jesus. Is
[1:41:11] that right? But don't outdo them with
[1:41:13] your words. Don't try to win them over
[1:41:15] with your with your wisdom and with your
[1:41:18] knowledge. You win them over by your
[1:41:19] kindness and the love that is in your
[1:41:21] heart that God has put there.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I think I'm I'm gonna stop there. That's
[1:41:26] enough. We don't want to be a fallen
[1:41:28] angel.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to follow after these
[1:41:30] footsteps. Brother Jack, the reason why
[1:41:32] you and I pick up the way we do when we
[1:41:35] do is because we got the same spirit
[1:41:36] ticking inside of us.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Did I ever tell you, I don't know,
[1:41:39] brother Jack ever told you the story how
[1:41:40] we met? When we met, we had never seen
[1:41:43] each other. Ain't that right? And we had
[1:41:45] met uh through brother Trevor via email.
[1:41:47] I think it was like a blog or something
[1:41:49] like this, some kind of chat that we
[1:41:50] had. Uh yeah, you remember that message?
[1:41:52] Two message ministers, Nathan and
[1:41:54] Trevor.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And uh somehow I was saying something
[1:41:57] saying something and all of a sudden
[1:41:58] this name pops up, Jack Dove. And I
[1:42:00] didn't have internet and I mean uh
[1:42:02] websites and all that stuff. So I didn't
[1:42:03] look him up or nothing. I just saw his
[1:42:05] name and God bless you, brother Caleb. I
[1:42:07] don't know you, but duh. And did you
[1:42:08] ever see what brother Brad said this?
[1:42:09] Like who was this guy? Oh yeah. Oh,
[1:42:11] that's good. Okay. Yeah. Hey. Well, did
[1:42:12] you see what he said? We established a
[1:42:14] little relationship. And then one day he
[1:42:16] comes out. Was he with brother Smiley?
[1:42:19] Okay. One day he comes out to uh Brother
[1:42:21] Musa's church, I think, via Brother
[1:42:23] Israel's invitation. And I walked in the
[1:42:25] doors and looked at Brother Jack and he
[1:42:27] looked at me. I go, "Brother Jack," he
[1:42:28] goes, "Brother Caleb,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; we had never seen each other before."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Well, you never seen each other before?
[1:42:38] No, not ever. But somewhere before the
[1:42:40] foundation of the world,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; when the sons of God danced before the
[1:42:45] stars in heaven,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; or was it the stars dance before the
[1:42:48] sons of God? Whoever it was before he
[1:42:51] formed you, I knew you.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; How can you doubt that your names were
[1:42:56] on the lamb's book of life?
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; How can you doubt that your names were
[1:43:00] hidden in the seals when he says,
[1:43:01] "Before I formed you, I knew you." All
[1:43:04] right.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Thus say the Lord God to Israel, I
[1:43:07] called you by name.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; He has known you before you knew you.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; What about that song we sing? He knew
[1:43:19] me.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; And yet he loves
[1:43:24] me.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; He whose name alone outshine the sun.
[1:43:34] Huh? God did that for you and I.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was going to go on saying I was
[1:43:39] unworthy, but I'm not unworthy because
[1:43:40] he who the son of man is made worthy is
[1:43:42] worthy indeed.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; He who the son of man is made free is
[1:43:46] free indeed. He who the son of man is
[1:43:49] made clean is clean indeed. He who the
[1:43:51] son of man is saved is saved indeed. He
[1:43:54] who the son of man is purified,
[1:43:55] sanctified, justified is sanctified,
[1:43:58] justified, and purified indeed. He who
[1:44:01] the son of man is found to be the truth
[1:44:03] is truth and the witness of all truth.
[1:44:05] And the only truth there is that Jesus
[1:44:07] Christ is the same yesterday and today
[1:44:09] and forever. Never forget your name were
[1:44:12] written there and hidden before the
[1:44:14] foundation of the world.
[1:44:17] God bless you, brother Jack. Come on.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. Hallelujah. Come
[1:44:23] on. Somebody give God praise. And I mean
[1:44:25] give him praise. I was known. I was
[1:44:28] there. My name is hidden. I'm in the
[1:44:31] seals. My name when the seals were
[1:44:33] broke, my name was Jet Luke.
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; I have a favor though. Could I have him
[1:44:46] sing that song one more time? Come on up
[1:44:49] here, brother. I know who I am. Take a
[1:44:52] look at me. Take a look at me. Take a
[1:44:53] look. How'd you do it?
[1:44:55] Huh?
[1:44:57] I said, "You I was trying to get Take a
[1:44:59] look at me. Take a look." I was like,
[1:44:59] "Take a look at me. Take a look at me."
[1:45:01] I know.
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. That's perfect,
[1:45:21] brother.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:52:23] Brother, we uh we appreciate that,
[1:52:26] brother Caleb.
[1:52:28] Um,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; you know, it's I I think everyone should
[1:52:35] feel challenged to go back and just
[1:52:37] start listening to the seals. I love the
[1:52:38] the thought that he uh brought because
[1:52:42] when you when you listen to the seals
[1:52:45] and for years we've listened um brother
[1:52:48] Brandham takes a really really good
[1:52:51] amount of time before he actually begins
[1:52:54] to reveal the seal
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; and and then the the next night he'll
[1:53:00] come and he'll do a a recap,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; right? And in the recap,
[1:53:07] the revelation of what the seal was was
[1:53:09] only about five minutes long,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Really about 5 minutes. So the
[1:53:15] the the revelation of what the what the
[1:53:17] seal was, what it meant was only about 5
[1:53:19] minutes. But what else was he trying to
[1:53:21] tell us?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; If it only took 5 minutes to tell you
[1:53:24] what the seal was, what what else was he
[1:53:26] trying to tell us? Yeah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And uh I I think you it causes you to
[1:53:30] listen to it just a little differently
[1:53:33] uh when you go back and and and and hear
[1:53:35] it and and and I'll I'll put a plug
[1:53:37] here. Um if you can't get the seal books
[1:53:41] from um Voice of God, then I know also
[1:53:45] brother George Smith,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; he produces a sealed book and he he does
[1:53:49] in a little different format. What
[1:53:51] brother George likes to do is when when
[1:53:53] a scripture is called out, he actually
[1:53:55] highlights the scripture a little bit
[1:53:56] better in in the book so you can see
[1:53:59] exactly where brother Random's getting
[1:54:00] this from. He didn't make this up. He
[1:54:02] went right back to the scripture and
[1:54:03] brought these things forward to us,
[1:54:04] right? But uh but just what a what a
[1:54:07] what a blessing.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; You you mean to tell me you were
[1:54:12] revealed in the seal?
[1:54:18] And and and another quote that came to
[1:54:20] mind is um brother Random said, you
[1:54:22] know, when when he says our names was in
[1:54:24] the book and brother Gibson, not a
[1:54:27] physical book, not like this.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And and here's the thing. When when when
[1:54:33] you see your name
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; there
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; in the book,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; it actually creates a different response
[1:54:40] from you.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and and if you if you go
[1:54:44] looking for a physical book like this,
[1:54:46] you're going to miss it.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; But brother Random say your name was in
[1:54:50] the book. He says, "And when when you
[1:54:52] see your name, you hear your name called
[1:54:53] out of that book," he says it's not like
[1:54:56] you would see Jack Duff
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; or Caleb Duron or or Man Neville, right?
[1:55:03] He said it wouldn't be like that. He
[1:55:04] says, "But as the revelation
[1:55:07] is being revealed to you, then you being
[1:55:10] identified with the revelation causes
[1:55:13] you to be able to see your name."
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; So when he was unfolding the seals, we
[1:55:22] were seeing our name revealed in that
[1:55:24] book, the Lamb's Book of Life. I tell
[1:55:29] you the truth. I'm so happy that God has
[1:55:32] allowed me to be identified with this
[1:55:35] message.
[1:55:39] This is this is like heaven to me. This
[1:55:42] is like heaven to me. I was just I was
[1:55:44] just absolutely blessed. And brother
[1:55:47] Caleb had been telling me about this
[1:55:49] sermon uh as we've been in fellowship.
[1:55:51] But it it's something about when you
[1:55:53] actually hear it preached uh underneath
[1:55:55] the anointing. It's just a real a real
[1:55:58] blessing. We appreciate the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:00] And all that he's done here today. Um so
[1:56:04] you you you you
[1:56:06] went under time. You could have kept
[1:56:08] preaching, but I know you got another
[1:56:10] one tonight. So that that's perfectly
[1:56:12] fine. I'm going to ask uh brother Jesse
[1:56:15] just to come and close us in a word of
[1:56:17] prayer. we were fellowshipping on
[1:56:19] yesterday and and he made a a statement
[1:56:22] to me um that just just blessed me
[1:56:25] because um
[1:56:27] um we've been talking about a few things
[1:56:30] you know and the the second coming and
[1:56:32] the third coming of the Lord that was a
[1:56:34] part of our ministers meeting and um and
[1:56:37] he brought out a scripture said you know
[1:56:39] Malachi 4
[1:56:41] says that um he would send Elijah to
[1:56:44] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:56:46] fathers and uh Um you know that coming
[1:56:49] of Malachi was actually for the second
[1:56:51] coming of the Lord. So brother
[1:56:53] Brandham's ministry is completely
[1:56:55] connected to the second coming of the
[1:56:58] Lord.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He did reveal what the
[1:57:01] third coming would be but he his
[1:57:03] ministry in itself was connected to the
[1:57:06] second coming of the Lord. As John the
[1:57:09] Baptist for my first coming, your
[1:57:12] message will for my second coming.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I was just blessed when he was
[1:57:18] sharing that. So I want brother Jesse to
[1:57:19] just come and Amen. and he can greet you
[1:57:22] and then also just say a word of prayer.
[1:57:24] Amen. For you as we prepare to dismiss.
[1:57:26] God bless you, brother Jesse. Amen.
[1:57:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, he he wouldn't want me to say this.
[1:57:34] Uh but this is uh brother Perry Green's
[1:57:38] grandson.
[1:57:41] [Applause]
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:48] God bless you, brother Jack. I
[1:57:49] appreciate the opportunity. Um, can we
[1:57:51] just get John 15:15 up real quick,
[1:57:53] please, brother? I promise I won't take
[1:57:56] long. Um, I appreciate all you. I'm glad
[1:57:58] to see brother Jack. It's really
[1:58:00] encouraging when you have We traveled
[1:58:01] here about four years ago. Um, our
[1:58:03] oldest was still a baby and you guys
[1:58:05] greeted me and I got up here and I was
[1:58:06] so excited from all the preach from all
[1:58:08] the praise and worship that I think I
[1:58:10] talked faster here than I do back home.
[1:58:13] And back in Arizona, we talk pretty
[1:58:15] fast.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; So, I promise I won't take that much
[1:58:17] time. I promise.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; But I've been in prayer ever since I've
[1:58:20] been here and I was talking to my wife
[1:58:22] last night and I just want to share this
[1:58:23] with you for just a moment because it
[1:58:25] goes right along with what brother Caleb
[1:58:26] said on Friday night. It says,
[1:58:27] "Henceforth I call you not servants, for
[1:58:30] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[1:58:32] doeth, but I have called you friends,
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; for all things I have heard of my
[1:58:36] father, I have made known unto you."
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; He called them friends,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; if he's calling you bride,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; how much more is he going to reveal to
[1:58:47] you?
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I wanted to share that
[1:58:53] with you that if you're called the bride
[1:58:55] of Jesus Christ,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; has anyone ever liked anyone before?
[1:58:58] Ever had a crush on anyone before?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Yes.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of married couples. I hope
[1:59:02] you get your hands up cuz not we're
[1:59:03] going have to have marriage counseling
[1:59:04] here. I I'm not I'm not here to do
[1:59:06] marriage counseling.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; But if you've ever liked someone before,
[1:59:09] you investigate. You find out where they
[1:59:11] what they like, what who they like, what
[1:59:13] clothes they like, what the attitude.
[1:59:15] You want to know everything about them,
[1:59:16] right?
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; You want to know who they are. Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus already knows who you are.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; What if it just takes this last trip as
[1:59:25] we try to back east now to come visit
[1:59:27] you? What if it takes that last trip for
[1:59:29] someone to get up and say, "Jesus is
[1:59:32] just waiting for you to find out who he
[1:59:34] is." Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And then we can all get out of here.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; What if it's just that last we're
[1:59:40] getting our garments on. We're preparing
[1:59:41] for Jesus come. What if he's like, "I
[1:59:43] just need you to know just a little bit
[1:59:44] more about me
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; so that when we get back to dinner,
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; the dinner of dinners,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; the feast,
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; he's going to have that plate set for
[1:59:54] you because he knows who you are."
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give you that little
[1:59:58] bit of nugget saying,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; "God bless you. We love you. Glory."
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; And I really hope when you come visit
[2:00:04] us, it is in January.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Don't come there in July and August.
[2:00:07] Don't don't come there. All right. As
[2:00:09] you can tell, I experienced your son.
[2:00:10] You don't want to experience that desert
[2:00:11] heat over there.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; But we love you.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Sincerely, it's encouraging to come back
[2:00:17] and see the churches growing and to see
[2:00:20] those that I saw last time, you're still
[2:00:23] pressing on.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; That encourages a young Christian like
[2:00:26] me. Amen. Go ahead.
[2:00:28] Amen.
[2:00:32] To have a song special saying to us, God
[2:00:34] bless you, sisters. That was a blessing.
[2:00:35] I think I shook your hand. I did not
[2:00:37] shake your hand, but it was a blessing
[2:00:38] to see the youth get up here, not even
[2:00:40] know, not even know, not even need to
[2:00:42] know the words on a phone, but just be
[2:00:44] able to sing it from your heart.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; That's encouraging
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; to see that you're still pressing on.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; You're still believing.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Let it be, Lord. Let it be.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; When you recognize his presence, you'll
[2:01:01] just take a minute. I know he's here
[2:01:03] right now. So, let me just stop talking
[2:01:05] and let's just talk to the Lord for a
[2:01:07] moment. So, heavenly father, thank you
[2:01:09] for this opportunity
[2:01:12] to be in the house of the Lord with
[2:01:15] those of light, precious faith, Lord, an
[2:01:17] encouragement to speak to them, Lord,
[2:01:19] tonight and to hear their words again,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, to see those that are still
[2:01:23] pressing on to find out who you are.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; You tell us who we are,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; but Lord, I want to know who you are.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; So, Father, when you come and get us
[2:01:31] back and oh, it could be very soon. It
[2:01:32] could be today. It could be right now.
[2:01:34] It could be tonight. Lord, I pray that
[2:01:36] we take that time. We take this
[2:01:38] seriously to find out, Father, just how
[2:01:41] much more you have planned for us. And
[2:01:43] Lord, only the eyes have not seen, ears
[2:01:46] have heard, but has been revealed to
[2:01:48] those through your spirit. Lord, I know
[2:01:51] the brothers and sisters here. And
[2:01:52] though we haven't met in person, Lord,
[2:01:54] the same spirit as in me is in the
[2:01:56] brothers and sisters here, my brothers
[2:01:58] and sisters of precious faith. So,
[2:02:01] Father, as you as we thank you for this
[2:02:03] wonderful service and all the song
[2:02:04] specials, Lord, and the words that were
[2:02:05] spoken, I pray, Lord, that you be with
[2:02:07] us again tonight, Lord, you give us a
[2:02:09] double portion of your Holy Spirit,
[2:02:10] Lord. And though we depart out of this
[2:02:12] building, Lord, don't let us ever, ever
[2:02:16] depart from your presence, Lord. Let it
[2:02:18] be so familiar that know if we get up in
[2:02:20] the morning, Lord, and we don't feel
[2:02:21] your presence, Lord, don't let our feet
[2:02:22] touch the ground. Don't let us roll out
[2:02:24] of bed, Lord. Don't let us continue our
[2:02:26] our our human business, Lord, until we
[2:02:29] have the spiritual in our hearts, Lord.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; So, Lord, let's wake up in the morning
[2:02:33] saying, "Father, what can I do for you
[2:02:35] this day? For, Father, you deserve all
[2:02:37] the honor and all the glory. For Father,
[2:02:39] without you, I am nothing
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; and because of you, Father, I am still
[2:02:43] standing and breathing
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; and I know who I am."
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I'm the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I'm adopted son of God.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm standing amongst the fellow
[2:02:54] believers, Lord.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; So, thank you, Father, for this
[2:02:57] opportunity. Please bless this
[2:02:58] congregation, Lord. Let them find a
[2:03:00] home, Lord, that they can praise and
[2:03:02] worship you. Stomp their feet, clap
[2:03:03] their hands. Lord,
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; I spoke it last night with a with a
[2:03:06] pastor here, Lord, by your inspiration.
[2:03:08] Lord, I know they'll be moving soon to a
[2:03:11] new location.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; So granted, Father, as you've already
[2:03:14] made it known, I pray you'd be with us
[2:03:16] again this night and this day through
[2:03:17] your son's name, Jesus Christ. We give
[2:03:18] you all our glory. Just want to say,
[2:03:20] "Father, I love you." Amen.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:03:27] [Applause]
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; You can be seated. Amen. Um just wanted
[2:03:33] to say brother Samuel so good to have
[2:03:35] you with us. Uh brother Steven had sent
[2:03:39] me the um asked me for the address and
[2:03:42] and I didn't let him know that uh a
[2:03:45] little bit of Arizona would be here
[2:03:48] today with you. Amen. and so happy that
[2:03:51] it all worked out for you to to come.
[2:03:53] Amen. On today, the Lord bless you.
[2:03:55] Also, uh just real quick, brother, um
[2:04:00] Jesse had just ran an idea by me and I
[2:04:03] want to just throw this out to you all.
[2:04:04] He say, "Brother, look for some
[2:04:06] abandoned buildings."
[2:04:10] He says, "Look for some abandoned
[2:04:12] buildings. you might see grass growing
[2:04:14] all up all around the place and and just
[2:04:16] look to see cuz then start investigating
[2:04:19] and see if you can get that building at
[2:04:20] a really good discount and then you know
[2:04:26] that's just something that he shared.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; I can't see all abandoned buildings by
[2:04:31] myself. So I'm throwing that out to the
[2:04:33] church. Look for some abandoned
[2:04:35] buildings.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
