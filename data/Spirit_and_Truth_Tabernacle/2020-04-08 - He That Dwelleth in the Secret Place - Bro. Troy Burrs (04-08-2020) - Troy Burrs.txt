from uh psalm 91 and it reads on this why why is it signs up he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen and i say unto the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the uh know it the the noisome pestilence he shall covet thee with feathers and under the wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler thou shalt not be afraid in the hour if they're not shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walk in the darkness nor for the destruction that wasted in noonday amen and uh we'll we'll just kind of start with the reading right there but we're going to get into that a little bit more but i want us to go back and i want us to kind of focus on the first uh uh chapter there um no doubt many have uh used this scripture in these trying times you what we're going through with this virus and uh this plague government that that has that has circled the globe and and and and have kind of disrupted amen a normal way of doing things i've heard this scripture written by read by all types of people everybody is running through this scripture at this pow everybody's running through this scripture to fight try to find comfort and man in some sort of peace amen but i want you to recognize one thing here and the first chapter here it says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty now many are reading this scripture but see the first the first chapter here gives us uh specifically to who this belongs to it says to he that dwelleth in the secret place so now i i i i i i'm not even afraid my brothers and sisters that that that that this scripture amen pertains to a particular group of people it ain't no anybody just grab this scripture and say oh well i'm going to just make myself fit right into the scripture amen you have to be and you have to be dwelling in the secret place now you might ask well what are you talking about man where is this secret place i want to if you turn your attention over here to joshua the second chapter we're gonna look into a few things this evening amen and i i i pressure you uh pray that you keep me in your prayers amen uh study a little bit on this secret place amen uh uh uh if i had to title this message i don't want to go any further without giving it a title the title of this message was he that dwelleth in the secret place amen he that dwelleth in the secret place so we see here in uh joshua the second chapter it says and joshua the son of none sent out spitting the two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came up to the harlot's house named rahab and they lodged there and it was told to the king of jericho behold that came in and hitler uh tonight of the children of israel to search out the country amen and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that i come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be uh come to search out the country and the woman took the two men and heared them and said thus there came men unto me but which which uh not which they wear now i want you to notice something here very peculiar here i'm very interested in this story up to this point uh raham this this this harlot woman and man just to give a little background she had a house and then a house lived upon the wall a man of jericho amen and uh uh just to give a little background and a little context to this story here uh uh they haven't heard about what was going on amen they had heard about the the issue of these people that that had left egypt and how god had uh delivered them they had heard about amen how how how uh uh uh it was plagues and things amen that had happened there in egypt amen to uh uh convince pharaoh to let these people go amen and uh uh uh uh they they had heard about amen the deaf angel that came through the land amen and smoke all of the firstborn of the egyptians they had heard about tales of all of these things amen so rahab here knew they meant that that they that hurt that that this great army amen was approaching to take the city amen so she had a choice to make she lived in a great wall city and much like today this wall this city uh was was was was striving very well amen they had they were comfortable behind their walls amen they had a booming economy amen and uh their government was strong and stable and they had they had all of these things and they were quite comfortable but they began to hear tales of of a people coming that had an inheritance amen that they were going to claim the land so they had i mean so ray have a man a a living a man on this wall no doubt she had a clear vantage point amen that she could she could see from afar these men also was able to use the rahab's house for the exact same reason amen and they uh she had a choice rahab had a choice to make amen she could choose a man to to offer assistance amen to to to to this great move of god amen oh she she she could have chosen to to to turn these men over to the king of jericho now we see that rahab made a choice she made a choice being a harlot amen being a a a woman a man that that was not in the promise of god at all amen she had no lineage uh to speak of she was a sinner she the gospel was not even to her she was a heathen woman amen but she made a choice amen amen to receive these spies into her house amen these spies amen uh uh that joshua had sent them to spy the land so in doing so amen ray have uh uh uh kind of uh put herself in a really good position amen because see uh what they came with they came with the word of god for that day they were god's people moving amen by the will of god amen so she what she did was she she got herself amen right in the way amen and she made herself an intricate part amen of the move of god amen she made herself a part of what was going on in that day amen she she was a person amen that didn't know religion they were idol worshipers amen and they served amen the god of abraham isaac and jacob and they said that the lord thy god is one amen so and she she turned she turned on from her wicked ways amen and she gave help to the message of the hour she gave assistance to god amen at that various time amen are you with me glory to god and uh uh let's read on and the woman took the two men and it came to pass amen that the men had came and everything and and she told them to go one way and they shut the gate amen she did not tell the men where where the spies were she hid them in her house very important i want you to just keep that and tuck it away she hid those men amen in her house now something very important i want you to recognize because that was the word of god amen that was the that was the avenue that god was working through at the time what she did was she heard the word she hear the message of that hour in her house amen and the story goes on that uh before they laid down amen she came up amen to the roof and she said unto them i know that the lord has given you this land my god she said i know so right there this hard woman had faith in the word of god amen she believed that that that in this word of god and she said uh and that your terror is falling upon all the inhabitants of the land and faith because of you and we have heard how amen the lord dried up the waters of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what ye did to the kings of the amorites and were on the other side of jordan and sihan and all whom he utterly destroyed amen she was paying attention and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither there remain any more courage in any man because of you and the lord your god he is god in heaven and above listen at this woman's testimony she is declaring that your god amen is god amen she made a declaration amen for for for herself amen she had a respect and a reverence for the word of god in that hour amen glory to god hey man we see today amen many people some time how uh uh uh in the day's time local ministers are trying to tell people about a great message of deliverance for us and our families in this day and we treat them with such disrespect like they are almost uh entrusting people on the earth and then wonder why there is no token for their families amen dealing with today's ministry the five-fold ministry with such disrespect and wonder amen while your children amen may be battling certain things wonder why there's no victory in your home wonder why you just can't seem to get a breakthrough amen it's because of a lack of respect amen for the gospel amen and it came to pass in the seventh day and they wrote early about drawing the day and compassion about the city at the same manner seven times i can only imagine this harley rahab sitting on the top of the wall looking over and seeing amen this uh uh uh this great army as they marched around the wall for seven days quietly and on that seventh day they began to march more they march seven times amen she knew that the time amen was at hand amen but she had made provisions amen she had aligned herself a man on the winning side amen she had aligned herself amen with a guard because she had seen the manifestations of the victory of this god amen no doubt they were on the other side of the wall uh uh uh googling what to do maybe amen they were probably making idle worship praying to their wooden statues to deliver them from what was coming amen there was a judgment amen that was on the way amen no doubt we can see that the king was in a panic amen my brothers and sisters much like today amen we have a virus in the land amen that represents judgment amen let me tell you something my brothers and sisters amen when you see a plague like this these kind of things are a direct relationship to sin it's a direct relationship to sin in the lives of the people amen it is judgment it is a form of judgment upon the land and judgment was coming to jericho but this woman they have a man this holy woman amen this heathen woman who did not have no god this idol worshiper amen she made a decision amen at a point in time amen that she would align herself with god amen she began to seek out amen away of escape amen she began to seek out how could i save myself and my family cause she understood that surely amen after hearing and seeing the manifestations of this god that there was definitely going to be trouble amen she had no confidence no more confidence in the walls amen she had all confidence in the god of abraham and isaac and jacob amen and she gave honor to them she gave assistance to them she was kind to them and she aligned herself on the winning side i asked you this evening my brothers and sisters are you on the winning side are you aligning yourself in this hour amen with all of the signs and wonders around you are you allowing yourself on the winning side amen we see how fragile our walls are amen within a matter of months we see the economy totally collapsed amen we see the republican party fight against the democrat party woman all is disarrayed everybody's under pressure grocery stores are empty people are under a panic we see the walls are crumbling all around us are you aligning yourself on the winning side you see are you aligning yourself on the winning side amen allow us to go wrong amen we see here amen that uh on the seventh day they arose early about the dawn of the dead and they compassed about the city uh the same manner seven times i'm reading from joshua the sixth chapter the 15th through the 17th verse amen picking up at the 16th verse and it came to pass on the seventh day when the priest blew the trumpets joshua said until the people shout for the lord has given you the city and the than the city shall be accursed even in and all their own therein in the lord and the truth of all their end to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all of her in her house because she hid the messengers that was sin amen and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man woman young and old oxen sheep the ass and the edge with the edge of the sword but joshua said unto the two men that spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out this the woman and all that she had as ye swearing to her and the young men went to the spies went in and they brought out rahab her father her mother her brother and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel oh my and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron that they put into the treasury of the house of the lord and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father her household and all that she had and she dwelled hey man she dwelled in israel even until this day because she hear the messengers because joshua was sent to spy out jericho now we see that she was saved in her action she was she there was a certain death amen that that that that that that they was beholden amen but through her actions amen rahab was saved but i tell you amen we see amen she dwelled amen with israel now remember the title of the message but he that dwelleth in the secret place now she had a dwelling my brothers and sisters she was she she had done just enough to get her placed into the right position amen that she could find amen the secret place amen she had a dwelling she had a life she had a life amen all of the others amen died at that hour amen there was a certain death but rehab because of what she did she was alive and her household was alive amen but we are looking for that secret place amen we see that in 91 it says he that dwelleth amen in a secret place amen my god so we look a little further here amen i i want to get into this just a little bit more and the holy spirit leads people into the inheritance where god has promised them through the ministry of prophet moses there was a natural inheritance and today my brothers and sisters i was is a spiritual inheritance amen now we want to see amen here in times 91 he not dwelleth in the secret place of the most high should abide under the shadows of the almighty this secret place amen can be uh translated as a shelter or a covering or a hiding place from danger so when we find that dwell in this hiding place then it is also the same thing as abiding under the shadow of the almighty amen let's pick up here amen from uh john the psalms 91 and we'll pick up where we where we left off let's go to verse seven if we will it says we'll start we go from verse six verse six psalms 91 first chapter the sixth verse nor for the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor for the destruction that wasted that new day thousands shall fall by thy side ten thousand by that right hand but shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall they behold and see the reward oh man of the week you're gonna behold this you're gonna see it but you are in a secret place where the pestilence cannot even find you because it is a secret place in god amen only thy lives uh shall not behold and see the reward of the wicked you will see with your eyes but you will not be a partaker of it because thou has made the lord nice verse because i have made the lord which is my refuge even the most high the habitation now a habitation is your dwelling place amen there shall be no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come not thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways i want you to take a good look at that brothers and sisters these are ministering angels that will be sent amen to keep you in the way amen he said he will send you these ministering angels we're not talking about little white beings with but with wings flying around yeah we're talking about men amen ministering angels that'll keep you in the way he shall put them charged over thee amen psalms the 81st chapter and the seventh verse it reads on this why thou call us in trouble and delivered thee i answer thee in the secret place of thunder i'm gonna read that again thou callest in trouble and i delivered thee i answer thee in the secret place of thunder amen and thunder my brothers and sisters is a symbol of the voice of god to us amen which is revealed word for the age that you live in amen we've been called in this day amen by seven thunders amen which we heard the voice amen and the voice honor amen that this hour time of trouble god has released the voice of information of truth to the elect to compact to combat the deception of this age so he allowed us amen in this hour of trouble and he delivered us and he answered us in a secret place of thunder amen we see a man that noah and his family found a hiding place back in the time of noah amen there was a great deception in the land amen that was a great trouble coming their way amen they were hidden away in the ark from the destruction of that age amen because amen they recognized the voice and the revelation of god through a prophet's message to get in through the ark and they were here amen in the safety of the ark amen would save them from the trouble and the pestilence of that island amen we look at the israelites at the same time in in exodus one they were hitting from the death angel behind the door amen the houses uh one uh was the blood over the lentil and the dog post was applied because they received the instruction amen from the voice of god amen from a prophet's message by a vindicated prophet moses amen and they found safety in the secret place in the dwelling place amen because they heard amen the thunder amen they heard the voice of god for that day and we see here now the story that we're talking about also rahab in the time of trouble and destruction he had the messages in her house and then she herself and her family also hid in the same house and they there she had hear the messengers because of her obedience to the voice of instruction by these two spies so she heard amen the voice of god she recognized the voice of god amen for the hour for the day that she was living in and she was saved from the destruction amen of the walls coming down all of the walls failed amen and hey rahab and her family walked out of the house and walked into safety into the camp of israel amen and they would save my brothers and sisters let us take a reading here psalms the 27th chapter we're going to read 1-5 the 27th chapter of psalms psalms of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is my strength and my life whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat me up my flesh they stumbled and failed though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear amen the war should arise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desire of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock oh my rock of ages club for me let me hide myself in need glory to god proverbs the 22nd chapter the third verse breathe a prudent man foreseeth evil and him the prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but a simple pass on and are punished in this hour my brothers and sisters i'm sure with your eyes walk around the streets today see people walking around with masks my god we had a present his main objective was to build a wall in this hour he wanted to build a wall that we can be safe behind this wall keep out the drug dealers and this that and the other but you didn't foresee a man a german enemy that you can't see you didn't foresee how did this one get behind the walls all right why because my brothers and sisters you have to be fortified behind the word of god in this house your walls are going to come down your walls mean nothing to god absolutely nothing amen he's going to get your attention how many ray halves do we have out there how many rahabs are out there i don't know god but you see judgment coming and you say lord god deliver me you have to be in the secret place maybe you cry out amen like this is my prayer lord one thing i have desire lord that you will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord amen all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the lord for in the time of trouble he shall hide you amen in this pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle amen and set you upon a rock amen a rock my brothers and sisters a revelation a revelation of the word of god for this hour amen the entrance into the shelter shall be ministered unto you amen we're going to get into that i'm going to get into it a little further i don't want to get beyond myself bear with me just a little bit longer amen we want to look at something here real quick amen we see that uh uh uh uh eve amen she was faced with a similar situation amen she uh uh uh uh uh with face she was in an age of information amen the serpent brought her uh uh a little information a man that she didn't have before amen which which which i allowed her amen to reason with the word of god amen to reason against the word of god and then we see that both adam and eve had to leave and environment of eden because they had left the spiritual environment of their relationship with god amen the natural will follow the spiritual bear with me one devil was loosed against eve in eden but in this age we have two hundred thousand thousand demons against humanity to cause an environmental change on such a spiritual magnitude in order to destroy mankind both spiritually and naturally we are living amen in a time where you got to be in the secret place amen so we're living in a great time of trouble and fear and the raging storm this is a condition and the environment that rey have found herself in because jericho was to be destroyed and so what is the answer you can imagine change the environment of this age amen you can send 200 million demons we can't send 200 million demons back into the pits of hell the answer for rahab was to find the hiding place but first she found a hiding place for the messengers i want you to catch that rahab had to find a hiding place but first she had to hide the word the bible say thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee you want to find a hiding place you must first hide the word in your tabernacle amen you must first have respect for the word and hide that word amen and when she heared those messengers she heard the messengers she hear the word of god for that hour amen and in turn they hid her amen and in the time of trouble amen 27 verse 5 amen psalms 27 verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the province of the secret place his tabernacle shall be shall he hide me amen he has set me upon a rock amen as i said a rock is a revelation the word for the season amen in which uh i should live and rahab received a revelation of the word from the messengers now i want you to notice that uh rahab she began to live amongst the israelites she began to eat what they eat she began to live the way they lived she began to dress the way they dressed right she began to pray to their god she did away with all of her idol worship amen she became an israelite she became amen one of the ones amen she dwelt in the city now i want you to notice something very particular about this lady because amen god rewarded her greatly i wanna i i wanna i wanna go to something here amen for the sake of time i'm gonna um move ahead a little bit uh bear with me hey man amen amen i want you to know this here in uh in the thightarian church age yes in the dictarian church age amen the prophet said now eve should have been burnt along with the serpent for their awful deed but adam intervened taking her quickly into himself so that she was saved now let's take a look at that my brothers and sisters she had a certain death coming she was going to be burned along with the serpent but eve adam acted as her redeemer and took her into himself took her into himself what was it a hiding place it was a hiding place her redemption now now you say wait a minute i don't understand that how was that because adam did not sin it was eve the serpent that sinned amen adam adam was not deceived i should say he took his wife amen they took her into himself through a marriage amen through a through a union so therefore he took her into himself amen thou for adam being uh the original uh creation and eve the byproduct amen eve adam acting as in that situation as the redeemer now i want you to look my brothers and sisters uh uh amen i don't want to get get get ahead of myself but i want you to understand one thing that we're talking about a secret place he that dwelleth in the secret place and we see amen that that that that rahab had found herself married to a prince of judah you see when joshua had placed her joshua had positionally placed her now say he you wonder why rahab rahab she uh uh uh uh all of these things that she was going through and she was saying rehab the harlot had a position she was predestinated to to to be in a certain place at a certain time for a certain reason amen as you can say her purpose was her protection amen her purpose was her protection she found herself amen in the tribe of judah amen where she had basically become amen and israelite amen and and and judah amen i think it was one of his grandsons she found herself wedding amen to solomon amen wedding amen to solomon amen let's look at something here why little bethlehem amen 58 12 28 amen 58 12 28. and we're gonna uh you could go from the uh 58 the chapter 58 58 chapter amen we're gonna go to this the second one we're there because i'm just trying to move ahead well let me back up now there's some good stuff in there i can't i can't pass up and we find out they had a lovely home in bethlehem as simon salmon had established it and it would become a great place and the fertile lands and how beautiful amen it is to think of a great weak country and it would be the bread place of the world and it is true no wonder jesus had to be born there because he was the bread of life there's all the nation come for their wheat and the nations come for their uh for their corn and uh for it was in bethlehem that uh had those fertile lands amen and you see uh the little bitty thing just saying oh it was a province of wheat yet that meant something and you see how the gentile prince or the jewish i'm sorry he said gentile prince then he said or the jewish prince amen taking his gentile bride amen back to bethlehem for a settling down place a place to live where there was plenty of bread we find out that this great romance and great obedience of faith that the harlot rahab she gave birth to a son to salmon and his name was boaz amen the first uh boaz was born in bethlehem from salmon and the the harlot rehab amen so i want you to see my brothers and sisters you see how she she she she placed herself now i want you to when we still talk about he that fine hides himself in the secret place i asked a question what really saved rahab the harley yes uh she had life amen because amen uh what she did back in jericho but i say to you my brothers and sisters just like eve when when adam took even to himself as a wife to save her from judgment salmon took rahab to wife took her into the secret place and made her a literal part of the lineage of jesus christ into the secret place i want you to know my brothers and sisters that the prophet preached a message called doors and doors amen and in that message he's talking about we live in a three-room house amen we fellowship in the front room he made provisions in the kitchen but in the bedroom is where we receive seed rahab was saved because she received the word of god into her womb she received seed and she birthed forth the lineage of the messiah amen so where is the sacred place in this hour amen it's a union going on you want to find safety in this tower there is a union amen and you must go amen into the secret place to receive seed amen to be impregnated amen to become a integral part of the royal seed of god amen we're talking about he who abideth in the sacred place there's many places there's only one secret place amen we see amen that the the disciples when jesus left he said go into the upper room and tarry there amen so they went into a house the the the the uh uh uh people they the uh of that time were hunting for them to to kill them so they had to go and pray in secret so they would come into the house they didn't stay in the living room no doubt there was a kitchen in the house but they had to go upstairs to the upper room and there they tarried for 10 days and what happened they received seed on the inside the baptism of the holy ghost amen now he said of john the 14th chapter the sixth verse i praise the father and she shall give another comforter that he may abide abide means to dwell with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither do they know us him not but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you my god see you have to go into the upper room and receive see you have to but we can't go there without there being first a union there has to be a union amen there's a union going on my brothers and sisters he is the bridegroom amen and he's calling a bride in this hour she has made a self wreck amen she's going into the upper room amen the secret place amen where she can receive seed where she can be impregnated amen with the word of god amen to produce the life of christ again amen i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also and at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you there's the secret place amen the secret place amen it's not enough to just come in the room it's not enough to just come into the message it's not enough to just travel amen with the word it's not enough to just hang around the word you must go into the secret place and receive seed amen she birthed seed that puts her directly in the lineage of christ there's the secret place there's the secret place that they're talking about at night in one in psalms 91 he's dwelling in the secret place you don't have to worry because your purpose is your protection amen christ hide me in the secret place amen i won't be before you much longer amen as i say before ii peter for the entrance shall be ministered unto you and abundantly into the everlasting kingdom and our lord and savior jesus christ how do we get into this secret place by the ministry of the word through the voice of god amen in this last day amen you love the lord amen amen i think i'll cut off there amen i hope that something was said amen uh to be a blessing to you amen we see judgment is coming this is just the warning we see everybody amen there they they they put out a stay at home uh everybody stay at home hide behind your doors stay in the house but i say my brothers and sisters you gotta go further than that it's not enough to just get into the house amen as i said before we started out this presidency was to build a wall but we see that a wall is not enough it's not going to save you my brothers and sisters going into the house is not enough it's not going to save you in this hour you must go into the secret place go into the secret place we sing a song shut in with god in a secret of god's saving grace gaining new power to run in its race oh i love to be shut in with god [Music] in with god in a secret place there in the spirit behold his face gaining more power to run in this race oh i love [Music] almost gracious heavenly father lord god is just a simple message o lord god i ask o father god that you are not the hearers of lord god lord god may the word of god penetrate lord god that someone realized that we're living in the last days oncoming judgment lord and and and lord these things that we place so much confidence in our military our financial system our medical system is not enough lord we must not be hidden in the secret place where you promise lord god to keep us just like you did rehab but because she was obedient lord and many man may hear this word this evening it's in your lap this evening rahab had a choice she had heard the word just like you've heard the word this evening and she had a choice to make whether to listen to the king and and and and and have depend on those walls or to find a hiding place and we see that only to hot to find that hiding place she had to have respect she had to receive the word of the hour and in order to receive the word for the hour she had to hide those messengers she had to receive god's messengers amen that came with the message of salvation for her day those that hear this word lord god may something strike in their heart that they may have a yearning lord to go into that upper room and be shut in with god we ask these blessings in jesus name amen praise the lord certainly grateful for the word of god tonight and um coming from our precious brother troy and just um much to just kind of meditate on and as we look at that scripture as you're saying in psalms 91 everybody is claiming that and everyone's holding on to that but if you're not really dwelling in the secret place of the most high uh then you can't actually claim that scripture and i thought it was a beautiful type and using rehab you know when when the walls of jericho came down you go back and read the scripture rahab's house was actually on top of the wall and uh so that tells us that when the wall to jericho came down there was only one spot on the wall that did not fall and everybody that was inside her house they were dwelling in the secret place if you were outside you were not in a secret place you know you had to be in her house where the scarlet threat was out of the window which represented a token that had been given to her and and that was the only place of protection and and today uh god has given us that and we find it in christ and uh not just uh that's a very a general term when we say in christ but uh you know rahab received a message she received the messenger she received a message and uh and today we invite people to receive this message that god has sent through his prophet william mary and branham uh regardless of what any anybody says there's things that we're seeing today um in our you know in our world it's not just something here in the u.s but it's the entire world that is on lockdown uh everybody's impacted but we had a prophet tell us that these things were were to come and um so as we see things unfold we're not alarmed amen we have been prepared because we have received word from a prophet and uh and we're hiding in a secret place and even you know when the prophet preached uh the message the rapture the scripture that he chose to use was psalms 27. so i thought that was very very appropriate again that brother troy was led to go there uh because uh you know we we were i was just talking with a brother to dave brother solomon he was saying you know it's um you know we we need uh we find safety we find all these things when the pressure is actually hitting like this so uh the wrap this pressure is going to produce a rapture and we're under expectation for it but you must be dwelling in the secret place if you want to a man make it in this hour praise the lord so we thank god tonight for service again we want to just encourage those that

word out to the hearts of god's people the lord richly bless you let's have a word of prayer as we close our service tonight father we are again grateful for uh this time and we thank you for the word that has come lord he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high amen we find ourselves uh in in christ and lord it's it's so easy uh to use that term but uh god as as rahab had to understand uh what was the message for her day the the children of israel had to understand the message for their day those that were in the ark with noah had to understand the message for their day even when christ came to the earth right before him he sent his messenger uh john the baptist the people had to understand the message of their day through john the baptist and when christ came they had to understand the message of the day when paul picked it up and carried it on they had to understand the message of the day all the way down to this time people must understand the message that has been presented to them because that's where we find christ moving and christ dwelling so lord we just thank you uh that the secret place that you've hit us there that you've placed us there and uh god how uh we can be protected in a time lord when everything else around us is falling apart thank you god that we can dwell in safety the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run in and they are safe so lord thank you uh that you've you've revealed these things to us pray that you blessed brother troy that you give back to him as he labored to give to your people here tonight and may you restore back all that he gave out as the saints with lord prepare to give pray that you bless them in their giving and god may you continue to meet the needs of your people uh meet the needs of the church lord and just when you continue to show yourself strong uh on our behalf we love you we praise you we thank you keep us until we're able to meet together again and i just pray that you touch each one in their bodies wherever sickness or even symptoms may be felt we pray that you touch the people we bind every symptom we bind every sickness in the name of jesus and god we believe as your word told us uh a thousand may follow that side and ten thousand in the right hand but it shall not come not our dwelling no pestilence no plague would come against us because we are in that secret place so we we rebuke and we reject every symptom in the name of the lord jesus christ lord we want to remember a request also a young lady who was on the front line providing care for uh many people now she finds herself lord and i see you needing uh care lord we ask that you would touch her we understand that she's uh she's not serving the way that she uh she knows the service so we pray god that you restore her soul as well as restore her body and god that you would raise her up for your glory and for your honor and she would serve you lord all the days were life and also the request that came from the the the the brother who's uh uh i believe he's a he attends a spurgeon's tabernacle there in the uk and lord he's a surgeon and has uh the opportunity to serve lord some uh some some very prominent people and god is just looking for uh prayer that you would give him opportunity to share christ with these people and i pray that you would open up those doors for him that you would help him lord god to see when you to send your spirit and god to seize the moment that he has oh god and we just pray that all of us would be sensitive to those moments god that we'd be able to share christ with people that do not know him in this hour god is in jesus name that we pray amen and amen god bless you we'll be back on sunday morning 9 a.m amen for our service sunday morning 9 a.m
