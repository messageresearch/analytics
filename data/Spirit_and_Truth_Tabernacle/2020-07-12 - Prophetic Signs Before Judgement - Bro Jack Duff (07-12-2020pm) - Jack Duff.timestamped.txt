[27:17] [Music]
[27:21] yes okay
[27:23] Exodus 3 and in verse 1 through 10 it
[27:26] says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro
[27:29] his father-in-law the priest of Midian
[27:34] and he led the flock to the backside of
[27:38] the desert and came to the mountain of
[27:41] God even to Horeb the angel of the Lord
[27:45] appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out
[27:49] of the midst of a bush he looked and
[27:52] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[27:54] bush was not consumed praise the Lord
[27:58] and Moses said I will now turn aside and
[28:02] see this great sight why the bush is not
[28:05] burn
[28:06] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[28:09] aside to see God called unto Him out of
[28:13] the midst of the bush and said Moses
[28:16] Moses and he said hear mine and he said
[28:21] draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes
[28:24] from off thy feet for the place whereon
[28:27] thou standest is holy ground
[28:30] moreover he said I am the God of thy
[28:32] father the God of Abraham the god of
[28:36] Isaac the God of Jacob and Moses hid his
[28:40] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[28:43] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[28:48] affliction of my people which are in
[28:50] Egypt and have heard their crime by
[28:52] reason of their taskmasters 5 know their
[28:55] sorrows a man knows all about it it says

[30:38] give you all the praise all the honor
[30:40] and all the glory we take every spirit
[30:42] that's against the Spirit of God
[30:43] underneath the control of the Holy
[30:44] Spirit even right now in Jesus name we
[30:47] pray amen amen god bless you you can be
[30:50] seated Amen praise the Lord
[31:00] we want to just take a topic today
[31:05] prophetic signs before judgment a man
[31:09] prophetic signs before judgment a man
[31:15] and as you know we just kind of get
[31:18] started as we were just reading there in
[31:20] the book of Exodus you know that the
[31:24] whole story of Moses a man and what we
[31:27] read III would assume a man that all of
[31:33] us believe what happened to Moses a man
[31:36] all of us believe that he met God at a
[31:39] burning bush it's not just a story that
[31:42] was told to us but we actually believe
[31:43] this happened to Moses and and and you
[31:47] know and one of the things that that I
[31:49] think that's striking to me is that you
[31:52] know we could believe a story about
[31:55] Moses and this happened probably some I
[31:59] mean years ago 4000 5000 years ago yet
[32:04] we believe it by faith that it occurred
[32:06] but when we see God doing similar things
[32:09] a man in another ministry that was only
[32:12] roughly you know a hundred years even
[32:16] less than that a man from this time God
[32:19] doing the same thing we still got to
[32:20] have the you know we still got to have
[32:22] that same belief because it's the same
[32:23] God moving glory to God it's the same
[32:26] God that the same he's not just a God of
[32:29] history we heard that this morning but
[32:31] he is
[32:32] man he's the same yesterday today and
[32:35] forever and the reason that I could
[32:37] believe that he can move a man the same
[32:40] way today because I see them doing the
[32:42] exact same thing so mark my confidence
[32:44] is that it's the same God hallelujah
[32:47] glory to God but as we as we look at
[32:50] this a man I want to just kind of just
[32:54] bring a couple of statements in and a
[32:56] couple quotes but we're talking about
[32:58] prophetic signs before judgment here in
[33:02] this discernment the ten virgins and the
[33:06] 144,000 Jews brother Branham speaks and
[33:10] he makes a statement says six days a man
[33:13] he labored he's talking about Almighty
[33:15] God there at the beginning six days he
[33:18] labor and and seventh he rested a man
[33:22] that's complete C seven six days he is
[33:26] labored in the world for 2,000 years it
[33:30] was destroyed by water second two
[33:33] thousand years Christ come and this is
[33:37] the third 2000 now and the end of every
[33:41] two thousand something happens the world
[33:44] is shook back again in six thousand
[33:48] years he built the world six thousand
[33:51] years to church Labor's against the
[33:53] world and the seven thousand is that
[33:56] thousand years millennium ring
[34:00] understand it now he says now the church
[34:03] has seven church ages also a man who
[34:06] says God and that's the complete number
[34:09] of the churches that's all seven seven
[34:12] is God's completed number seven church
[34:15] ages seven thousand years of creation
[34:17] everything deals in seven now since
[34:22] we're talking about a man prophetic
[34:24] science before judgment in the first two
[34:27] thousand years God shook the world
[34:30] a man with with a flood and that flood
[34:32] actually took us off of our tilted the
[34:35] earth a little bit took us off our axis
[34:37] this is what causes some of the weather
[34:39] patterns that we have nowadays amen
[34:41] because before they and everything was
[34:42] perfect the seasons were perfect
[34:45] everything
[34:46] just right actually that time it had
[34:47] never rained on the earth the weight of
[34:50] the earth goddess its irrigation is out
[34:52] from underneath my god God did things so
[34:55] perfectly when he designed it's like the
[34:58] earth had its own sprinkler system
[35:00] hallelujah Amen a perfect sprinkler
[35:02] system glory to God everything was just
[35:05] right it had never rained on the earth
[35:07] glory to God because everything was so
[35:09] perfect but but when sin came in God
[35:12] sent a prophet to try to call the people
[35:15] from their sinful conditions and then
[35:18] I'm not only than his city center with a
[35:20] word to preach 120 years they may he
[35:23] warn the people of the rain that was
[35:24] coming but he also built a boat that the
[35:27] people had the opportunity that come and
[35:30] get on the boat if they want to
[35:32] protection they had two hits listen to
[35:35] that prophetic sign that God had given
[35:38] him just before he was gonna judge the
[35:41] earth in the first two thousand years
[35:43] Noah had a message Noah had a boat Noah
[35:48] a man had word from the Lord nor had
[35:51] everything the people needed all they
[35:53] had to do was follow up nor was saying
[35:55] hallelujah and the other thing we need
[35:57] to understand nobody else during that
[36:00] time had a message nobody else during
[36:02] that time had a boat how long you had to
[36:05] get on Noah's boat if you wanted to be
[36:08] spared
[36:08] amen from the judgment that was coming
[36:11] hallelujah
[36:12] Noah himself was a prophetic sign
[36:16] hallelujah for the first 2,000 years
[36:19] every two thousand years something
[36:21] happens every two thousand years now now
[36:24] after the days of nor we had another two
[36:26] thousand years glory and this is when
[36:29] the Lord Jesus comes on the scene amen
[36:32] and I mean I hate to just call him a
[36:36] prophetic sign but he was the sign of
[36:39] old signs amen a virgin conceived and
[36:42] bore a son hallelujah and Jesus Christ
[36:45] coming to see but but here in Jesus day
[36:48] of that second two thousand years
[36:50] transmitted began to strike the Jews
[36:53] because they rejected their prophetic
[36:56] sign Oh hallelujah
[36:59] just begin to come upon the Jews because
[37:02] they rejected something it was during
[37:03] that time after Jesus died and rose
[37:06] again that Paul said we turn from the
[37:08] Jews to the Gentiles hallelujah we've
[37:11] been in that time a man where the turn
[37:14] is taken to the Gentiles we've gone
[37:15] through seven Church ages and we're in
[37:17] that time where we had the end of the
[37:20] end glory to God we're at the end of the
[37:23] end because now we're at another 2,000
[37:26] years 6,000 years amen and we've
[37:29] actually gone over time when you really
[37:31] calculate it we've gone over time just a
[37:33] little bit but you know I thank God and
[37:34] His grace has allowed us to go over time
[37:37] for a little bit because he's still
[37:39] trying to reach somebody amen
[37:41] while God is trying to reach you to pull
[37:44] you in the devil trying to do everything
[37:46] he can to pull you out hallelujah
[37:49] you know I don't know us both they were
[37:50] still doubting a man they were inside
[37:53] the ark with the door locked and still
[37:56] doubting whether nor had the truth or
[37:58] not a man but the good thing about is
[38:01] that by them being in the art ever since
[38:03] God locked the door there was no way
[38:06] they were gonna get out can I put it
[38:08] this way your bow can take you out I
[38:14] said your doubt cannot take you out if
[38:18] you belong to God that you belong to God
[38:21] hallelujah glory to God amen so here we
[38:26] are two thousand years late the last two
[38:28] thousand years God is ready to shake the
[38:30] world again but God says the Prophet
[38:33] Amen on the scene and this time as he
[38:36] promised the quarters worked amen before
[38:39] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[38:40] amen our send you Elijah the prophet and
[38:43] he'll turn the hearts of the children
[38:44] back to the faith of the fathers amen
[38:47] and and the ark that we find today is
[38:50] the Ark of the word of God what we need
[38:53] to do is stay inside the words stay
[38:55] inside the ark we'll be safe Amen at
[38:58] this time of judgment hallelujah I look
[39:00] at let's look at another quote here
[39:04] glory hallelujah this is coming out of
[39:08] the the message spoken words original
[39:10] seed and I just want to read a
[39:13] things here by the grace of God spoken
[39:18] words original seat and this is kind of
[39:22] picking up from where we were last week
[39:23] says so it's at that time in this
[39:29] country that the person that that person
[39:32] will appear force in the scripture and
[39:35] is thus saith the Lord that in the
[39:37] latter rain there will come forth a
[39:39] Mount Carmel showdown
[39:41] a showdown Bible for field that's what
[39:44] happened in the days of Elijah he had
[39:45] the Mount Carmel showdown amen
[39:48] a Bible fulfilled to the letter glory
[39:51] John the Baptist his messenger his
[39:55] message before its face in Malachi 3
[39:57] planted a former rain and was rejected
[39:59] by the churches the denominations the
[40:02] pharisees and the sadducees in his day
[40:05] Jesus came and had the Mount
[40:08] Transfiguration showdown glory this
[40:12] forerunner of the last days will sow for
[40:15] the former rain and I love the statement
[40:18] Jesus will be the showdown between
[40:23] denominations and creeds which is his
[40:27] word
[40:27] when it comes a man a showdown the rest
[40:30] of his bride so Jesus will be the
[40:33] showdown to prove who's right and who's
[40:35] wrong you don't have to prove it
[40:38] Oh glory to God I don't have to prove it
[40:41] amen I just I just preach it and I live
[40:44] it but I don't have to prove it it is
[40:46] not my job to prove it
[40:48] Jesus himself will prove this Laurie the
[40:52] guy say that first was Mount Carmel the
[40:55] second was Mount Transfiguration the
[40:57] third will be mountain sighing glory now
[40:59] I wanna I just wanna the scripture just
[41:02] kind of came to me
[41:03] let's just go to mark 16 real quick hey
[41:06] man I knowing that quote brother branham
[41:08] said Jesus would be the showdown between
[41:09] denominations of Crete a man which is
[41:13] his word when he comes a showdown the
[41:15] rapture is bright so the showdown is
[41:17] going to be those that go in the rapture
[41:19] knows that thoughts amen but I want to
[41:21] just show you how Jesus became the
[41:23] showdown man back in the in the early
[41:25] church
[41:26] here mark 16 I was reading the scripture
[41:29] this week and it just blessed my heart
[41:31] verse 9 says when Jesus says mark 16
[41:35] verse 9 says now when Jesus was risen
[41:38] early the first day of the week he
[41:41] appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of
[41:44] whom he had cast out Seven Devils
[41:47] and she went and told them that had been
[41:52] with him as they mourned and wept now I
[41:55] love this because this business Mary
[41:58] Magdalene is going with the testimony of
[42:01] how she has seen the Lord she's going to
[42:04] testimony that's how she has experienced
[42:07] the Lord amen
[42:08] she's not talking about something past
[42:10] tense I'm telling you that he is risen
[42:12] again hallelujah says she went and told
[42:15] them that had been with him as they
[42:18] mourned her wealth and they when they
[42:19] had heard that he was alive and had been
[42:23] seen seen of her believed not now Jesus
[42:28] had already given them scriptures he had
[42:30] already prophesied that he was going to
[42:32] be rising and he kept telling after the
[42:34] third day this was gonna happen after
[42:35] the third day that was gonna happen but
[42:37] it was something new they never heard a
[42:39] sermon like that they never heard a
[42:41] message like that so really challenged
[42:43] their thinking so here upon his
[42:46] resurrection the first person he appears
[42:48] to is Mary Magdalene
[42:49] now they refuse to believe her testimony
[42:52] so here comes here comes this next verse
[42:54] and says after a man after that he
[42:58] appeared in another form unto two of
[43:02] them as they walked and went into the
[43:05] country
[43:05] this is Cleopas and his friend and they
[43:08] went and told it until the until the
[43:11] residue neither believed they them I'm
[43:16] looking at this glory to God
[43:18] so here Mary Magdalene comes with the
[43:20] testimony
[43:21] Cleopas and his friend comes with the
[43:23] testimony and you know the Bible
[43:25] actually tells us I don't amount the two
[43:27] or three witnesses let every word be
[43:29] established but you know even after they
[43:31] heard these powerful testimonies the
[43:34] disciples the men that were living with
[43:36] Jesus the man that were fishing with
[43:39] Jesus the me
[43:40] that were praying for the sick with
[43:41] Jesus the men that experienced so many
[43:44] miracles they still did not believe that
[43:47] he was risen even after this hallelujah
[43:50] and I'm looking at this because no
[43:52] matter how much we give people are
[43:53] supernatural no matter how much we give
[43:56] them the word we still find a group of
[43:58] people on the earth today that refuse to
[44:00] believe but I want to tell you something
[44:05] Jesus himself will be the showdown
[44:09] watch this a man in verse 14 afterward
[44:13] he appeared to the eleven as they sat at
[44:17] meat and upbraided them with their
[44:21] unbelief and hardness of heart I was
[44:23] thinking about this here at his
[44:25] resurrection the very first time that he
[44:29] sees the disciples the other eleven abdi
[44:32] he was resurrected he rebukes them oh I
[44:36] don't want that to be my testimony amen
[44:39] I wanted to be a very exciting
[44:41] experience when I feel for the first
[44:43] time I don't want him rebuking me I want
[44:46] to be able to express my love to him
[44:48] hallelujah look at this add to it he
[44:51] appeared unto the of the eleven as they
[44:53] said at me and I braided them with their
[44:56] unbelief and hardness of heart because
[44:58] they believed not them which had seen
[45:02] him after he was risen Jesus himself
[45:06] became the showdown for the testimonies
[45:10] that had preceded him you don't have to
[45:13] believe that God sent a prophet but
[45:15] Jesus himself will be the showdown when
[45:21] he calls his bride into and its bride
[45:24] will be father with a prophet sing
[45:27] hallelujah amen we don't have to prove
[45:30] it Jesus himself is gonna prove it he
[45:32] will be the showdown all right stay with
[45:35] me church glory to God amen this pork
[45:38] goes on to say in spoken words original
[45:40] seed he says he largest behavior and in
[45:45] this quote that I'm reading to you now
[45:47] I'm still in the the channel of pick up
[45:52] your pen and write
[45:53] this is still part of that entire a
[45:55] man's statement that the angel the Lord
[45:57] told a prophet to write to the church so
[46:00] I'm still reading amen I'm taking it
[46:02] almost section by section trying to make
[46:04] sure that we get what the Lord is trying
[46:07] to give to us in this season
[46:08] it says Elijah's behavior Moses's
[46:13] behavior John's behavior leaving their
[46:17] field of service many of the people
[46:20] didn't understand them it was because
[46:22] they was rejected and their message said
[46:26] the seed had been sown judgment was next
[46:30] glory and they was assigned to the
[46:33] people from God that judgment was at
[46:36] hand planting was over it was over now
[46:41] you know I'm looking at this a man on
[46:44] today and and I just want to just kind
[46:47] of we you know we've talked about Elijah
[46:51] and we can go back and just touch it
[46:53] just for a brief moment but you know
[46:56] during the time of Elijah what trigger
[46:59] the showdown and Elijah's day was that
[47:02] the people got away from the Word of God
[47:04] and I don't did they get away from it
[47:07] you know this just kind of flows and
[47:09] connects with last sermons I mean last
[47:11] week's sermon you know how history is
[47:13] repeating itself hey man what happened
[47:15] was that they had a leader they had
[47:18] godly leaders that started out Israel
[47:20] with you know where people like David
[47:22] and Solomon and so God was just moving
[47:24] the muscles free but even in Solomon's
[47:27] day how look we can see how seeds were
[47:31] so where it was going to get worse and
[47:34] worse because Solomon merits some women
[47:36] that he should not have Mary Sullivan
[47:37] mayor of these foreign women caused him
[47:40] to build houses their gods he built one
[47:44] for the God of Israel but then he got a
[47:46] man he got a little relaxed and and then
[47:48] he started building houses to the gods
[47:51] of his wife and he started bringing in
[47:53] idolatry hallelujah
[47:55] into Israel where God was supposed to be
[47:58] the only God of Israel but here they got
[48:02] that's why I have no other gods before
[48:04] me
[48:04] but they've been given to bring it in
[48:05] even in Solomon's day till the Galilee
[48:08] we down my 1/2 and the scripture say he
[48:10] was the worst of every King that ever
[48:12] amen our seventh of throne and in Israel
[48:15] this man hallelujah married a Jezebel
[48:18] though the worst one the worse between
[48:21] could mirror he caused an affinity of
[48:24] the kingdom by Mary meanness later
[48:26] Jezebel and she was a true Optometry she
[48:29] wanted nothing to do with the God of
[48:31] Israel killing the prophets and
[48:33] everything my god what a woman that this
[48:35] man married but you know brother Branham
[48:38] you know tells us how Israel's history
[48:41] is it's typed into the US history a man
[48:45] and when a.m. comes on the scene and
[48:46] Israel got to the worst act that it had
[48:49] ever been God used a prophet a man by
[48:53] the name of Elijah they're trying to
[48:55] call the people back to the word he's
[48:57] saying a God that answers by fire
[49:00] let him be God I'm tired of y'all
[49:02] following all these false cops y'all
[49:05] guys can't answer prayer y'all guys
[49:07] can't do this but yet y'all choose the
[49:09] phone he said let the gods answer by
[49:12] fire let him be God the people agreed to
[49:14] it
[49:15] they accepted the showdown and when God
[49:18] showed up on the scene hallelujah
[49:21] all the priests and prophets out there
[49:24] cutting themselves and trying to get
[49:27] their God answer prayer he loud you just
[49:28] sitting back saying look you're guiding
[49:30] he ain't done that yet maybe he's on
[49:32] vacation maybe he's dead maybe this you
[49:34] know he said y'all just wasting time
[49:36] okay I'm no now it's my time here he's
[49:38] standing by his self against all these
[49:40] other prophets let me tell you something
[49:42] in the South you may be spending by
[49:44] yourself but if you're standing with God
[49:46] you're not alone hallelujah greater see
[49:50] that singing than he that's in the world
[49:51] glory to God
[49:53] Elijah stood myself it brought on a
[49:55] Mount Carmel showdown God showed up God
[49:59] demonstrated that he was with Elijah
[50:02] Amen when he consumed the sacrifice
[50:05] hallelujah but it's because the people
[50:07] that got away from the Word of God now
[50:09] brother Adam say notice Elijah's
[50:11] behavior aunty Elijah did thereafter his
[50:13] mighty
[50:14] my
[50:17] you know supernatural move Elijah took
[50:19] off running from Jezebel Elijah went to
[50:22] a cave to hide from a woman that he
[50:24] thought would take his life hallelujah
[50:26] notice his strange behavior now I want
[50:29] to you know just kind of focus our
[50:31] attention today on Moses behavior a man
[50:35] we see are Elijah a man but we want to
[50:37] focus on Moses behavior I want to go
[50:40] back and say a couple things about Moses
[50:42] God gave Abraham a vision of the people
[50:47] of Israel coming out of bondage Genesis
[50:50] 15 verse 13 and 14 this is a vision that
[50:54] God gives a man Abraham he says and he
[50:59] said unto Abram know of a surety that
[51:03] thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
[51:06] that is not theirs and shall serve them
[51:10] and they shall afflict them for hundred
[51:13] years
[51:13] and also that nation whom they shall
[51:17] serve will I judge see judgment is gonna
[51:20] come hallelujah amen but before a
[51:23] judgment they will receive a prophetic
[51:25] sign glory to God amen it says and also
[51:28] that nation whom they shall serve will I
[51:30] judge and after what shall they come out
[51:33] with great substance this is a prophecy
[51:37] that God has given Abraham and when
[51:41] Moses is poured hallelujah not just when
[51:44] he's born but when he begins to
[51:46] recognize who he is
[51:49] Oh glory to God because there's a lot of
[51:52] folk on earth that's been born but still
[51:55] don't understand their purpose glory to
[51:59] God they running here and they running
[52:01] there but you don't know why God has
[52:03] placed you on this earth
[52:05] you don't realize were you thinking the
[52:07] economy of God Moses Moses didn't reel
[52:11] his mama tried to tell her mama I want
[52:14] to just kind of take my time and just
[52:16] share this you know his mama tried to
[52:18] tell him
[52:19] Oh God his mama trying to help him
[52:21] understand a man some of the things that
[52:24] had happened glory amen at his birth
[52:28] how she couldn't keep them they met at
[52:30] the house because they either kept going
[52:34] out that they want to kill all the
[52:35] children to it all of male children two
[52:37] years old and under hallelujah and I
[52:40] somehow someway mama was able to get him
[52:43] in a basket put them in the Nile River
[52:45] Moses I'm telling you your story amen
[52:48] here here he gets in the nile river and
[52:51] it just so happened his basket ends up
[52:54] in the house of Pharaoh pharaoh's
[52:57] daughter gets a hold of the basket maybe
[52:59] she's a woman that can't have children
[53:01] so when she sees this baby come out of
[53:04] nowhere she feel like her prayers being
[53:06] answered hallelujah but God allowed the
[53:09] deliverer to be raised in the house of
[53:12] Pharaoh glory to God ain't his mama
[53:16] telling him all these stories it and
[53:18] Moses was like mama I never heard that
[53:22] but you tell me that's my story
[53:24] mom I believe it and based on his mama's
[53:27] revelation Moses tried to deliver the
[53:31] people based on his mama's revelation
[53:37] glory God yet she was to deliver but he
[53:40] could not go to Egypt and get anybody
[53:43] free old Mahmut revelation Moses was not
[53:46] going to do anything till he came in
[53:48] contact with Almighty God and what many
[53:51] of us meet today it's our own personal
[53:53] experience with Almighty God we've been
[53:55] trying to go on Mama's revelation we've
[53:57] been trying to go old dannis revelation
[54:00] but we need our own personal revelation
[54:02] hallelujah when Moses came on the scene
[54:07] what was happening is that God was
[54:10] answering his word through the life of
[54:13] Moses and Moses himself was stepping
[54:15] into a vision the vision that God gave
[54:19] Abraham years ago Moses himself was a
[54:22] man that stepping into the vision and I
[54:25] pray as a church that we would begin to
[54:27] step into a vision that an angel saw
[54:30] before we were even born
[54:31] most of us were even born look at this
[54:37] Moses I want to make this statement here
[54:41] hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[54:46] amen Moses was a great prophet but Moses
[54:52] mentioned to the people he prophesied
[54:55] about something he was a prophet coming
[54:57] before judgment because judgment was
[54:58] giving strike Egypt a man but he propers
[55:02] I have something in his days and we're
[55:03] gonna look this up in Deuteronomy 18 and
[55:05] 15 Moses beginning to prophesy he meant
[55:09] after his ministry had been vindicated
[55:10] amongst the people he gave them a
[55:12] statement saying he said this in
[55:14] Deuteronomy 8:18 15 says the LORD thy
[55:16] God will raise up unto thee a prophet
[55:21] from the midst of thee of that brethren
[55:24] like unto me unto Him ye shall hearken
[55:29] now I'm one that believes scripture has
[55:32] a men dual meanings glory to God here we
[55:36] can clearly see that Moses is talking to
[55:39] the Israelites we can see that and it is
[55:42] telling them that God gonna raise up a
[55:44] prophet like unto Him in the midst of
[55:46] them amen
[55:48] right an image to them that brother in
[55:50] him you should hearken now we noted that
[55:52] that that scripture was related to the
[55:55] life amen in the prophetic Ministry of
[55:57] the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:58] but I also believe Amen that scriptures
[56:01] also related to life amen in the
[56:04] prophetic ministry of William Marion
[56:06] Brennan glory to God the Lord raise up a
[56:09] prophet a man like unto Moses hallelujah
[56:12] now let's look at this look at a quote
[56:15] here God is his own interpreter a man
[56:18] the Prophet makes a statement here and
[56:19] this message God as his own interpreter
[56:22] thank you Jesus God help us here it says
[56:26] watch what he did one day he was
[56:30] standing there the first beginning of
[56:32] his ministry there was a man came to him
[56:34] by the name of Simon Simon Peter and
[56:37] when Peter looked upon him and saw him
[56:39] jesus said to him your name is Simon
[56:43] you're the son of Jonas he should have
[56:46] known that Moses said the Lord your God
[56:49] shall raise up a prophet like unto me
[56:52] and you Tomas here now know
[56:54] ha brother branham I did I mean
[56:56] identified a man the Ministry of Jesus
[56:59] with the ability to be able to a men are
[57:03] just kind of minister to it I mean know
[57:07] the heart set the heart heart sort of
[57:08] people know where they come their name
[57:10] and where they come from they may hear
[57:12] the secrets of their hearts this this is
[57:14] part of brother Branham second pool
[57:15] right so here at through the second pool
[57:18] ministries identifying Jesus ministry
[57:21] amen he said this was a prophet like
[57:23] unto Moses when Peter looked at him in
[57:29] Psalms said Jesus said your name is
[57:31] Simon and you're the son of Jonas he
[57:34] should have known that multitude the
[57:37] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[57:39] like unto me and him you must hear and
[57:44] there was a man that had never seen him
[57:47] in his life said your name is Simon and
[57:49] you're the son of Jonas why he know
[57:51] right then that there could be no more
[57:53] they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds
[57:56] of years and here was a man telling him
[57:58] who he was no wonder he could receive it
[58:01] glory to God now let's go
[58:03] he says Phillip at that time found
[58:07] anything on the tree brought him back to
[58:10] Jesus Jesus said Behold an Israelite in
[58:13] whom there is no guile said rabbi when
[58:17] did you ever know me he said before
[58:20] Philip called you when you were under
[58:22] the tree I saw you
[58:25] he said rabbi thou art the Son of God
[58:28] you're the king of Israel
[58:30] he knows that was why it didn't need any
[58:33] interpretation Jehovah said that so this
[58:36] very scripture that Moses says in
[58:39] Deuteronomy 18:15 that the Lord your God
[58:41] will raise up a prophet like unto me
[58:43] brother Branham a man looked at the
[58:45] discernment that Jesus demonstrated his
[58:48] own ministry and said that was the
[58:51] Prophet a man that was like unto Moses
[58:54] that Moses prophesied about Jesus
[58:57] himself was stepping into a vision
[59:02] hallelujah glory to God Amen Jesus
[59:06] himself was
[59:08] stepping into a vision let us go on a
[59:11] little further hallelujah hallelujah
[59:13] glory to God amen
[59:16] now I wanted to just saw hit this say
[59:20] man just for a little bit
[59:21] glory just give me a second here my Lord
[59:24] Jesus enemy attack louia we go back to
[59:36] Exodus 3 and I picked this up because I
[59:41] want to just kind of just just think
[59:44] about this here God is calling Moses on
[59:47] he was on the backside of the desert
[59:49] and as I was thinking about this now
[59:52] Exodus has a number of chapters I
[59:55] believe over over 30-something chapters
[59:58] amen and Exodus and uh Moses is calling
[1:00:03] on the backside of the desert its found
[1:00:05] in Exodus chapter 3 and in and as I look
[1:00:09] at it you know the first two chapters
[1:00:12] first chap to come talk about the
[1:00:14] condition of Egypt the second chapter
[1:00:16] kind of talk about Moses birthing and
[1:00:19] what his mama Dean and what his daddy
[1:00:21] did and how he was raised in Egypt and
[1:00:23] in the chapter 2 he actually took off
[1:00:25] from Egypt do you know
[1:00:27] amen pretty much the first 40 something
[1:00:30] years of Moses life is all included in
[1:00:32] the first two chapters I want you to get
[1:00:36] that the first 40 something years is
[1:00:38] only included in two chapters can I just
[1:00:41] say something
[1:00:42] you ain't even started writing your book
[1:00:43] yet hey man yeah yeah yeah God and even
[1:00:47] started using you yet right and you all
[1:00:50] worried about this and worried about
[1:00:52] that you'llyou'll chapter - praise God
[1:00:57] I've got so much more to do in your life
[1:01:01] Amen it get greater after chapter 2 the
[1:01:06] devil tried to wipe you out before you
[1:01:08] get to chapter 3 hallelujah but once you
[1:01:11] step into chapter 3 great things are
[1:01:13] about to start happening
[1:01:14] a man church I hope you catch that but
[1:01:18] mouid didn't really begin for Moses till
[1:01:20] he got to chapter
[1:01:21] three that's when the excitement started
[1:01:24] glory to God a man when he really found
[1:01:28] in place when he found this place in God
[1:01:30] and not not only this Amen when he was
[1:01:33] at the burning bush he was no longer
[1:01:35] going on his mama's testimony come on
[1:01:39] somebody now he's got his own personal
[1:01:42] testimony and now when he got his
[1:01:44] personal testimony everything begins to
[1:01:47] change
[1:01:48] hallelujah see when it was going on
[1:01:51] Mama's testimony he could only write one
[1:01:53] chapter and actually killed one one
[1:01:55] Egyptian with Mama's testimony but now
[1:01:57] God given use them in a mighty way with
[1:01:59] his own personal testimony all right
[1:02:02] watch this now we look at Exodus chapter
[1:02:05] 3 hallelujah and Moses is met by God in
[1:02:10] the burning bush God uses this bush to
[1:02:12] get his attention
[1:02:13] God is attention he's talking to him and
[1:02:16] and he's saying you know what I've heard
[1:02:17] that groans in the cries of my people
[1:02:19] and I'm coming down to bring delivers to
[1:02:22] the people and I'm gonna send you now
[1:02:23] now here's the problem
[1:02:25] Moses is here having a supernatural
[1:02:27] experience but yet he has excuses as to
[1:02:32] why he can't do what God called him to
[1:02:34] do now I want you to stay with me reason
[1:02:38] I need to say this
[1:02:39] the reason Moses is even on the backside
[1:02:43] of the desert
[1:02:45] Amen is because Moses lost feeling for
[1:02:50] the people
[1:02:50] Oh God help us there the reason Moses is
[1:02:54] here at this burning bush is because he
[1:02:57] lost feeling for other people he left
[1:02:59] Egypt and went out to the backside of
[1:03:01] the desert and forgot all about the
[1:03:03] people but God said I remember my people
[1:03:06] and I'm sitting you I don't care about
[1:03:09] you losing feeling let me tell you
[1:03:11] something man may forget about you
[1:03:13] hallelujah
[1:03:14] woman may forget about you but God has
[1:03:17] not forgot about you glory to God daddy
[1:03:21] may forget about you mama fate may
[1:03:24] forget about you but God has not
[1:03:26] forgotten
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:29] I remember my people I'm gonna send you
[1:03:31] Moses right back down to the people that
[1:03:33] you forgot about now I want you to
[1:03:35] understand something
[1:03:37] Moses say now who you want me to go say
[1:03:42] I don't even know your name and he's
[1:03:44] having a conversation with God I don't
[1:03:46] even know your name Who am I gonna tell
[1:03:49] them sent me hallelujah and God got
[1:03:53] thunder back to Moses a tell him I am

[1:05:36] of right now I am I am telling him that
[1:05:40] I am sent you down there hallelujah
[1:05:44] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Moses
[1:05:48] was given two signs before he went back
[1:05:52] down into Egypt one was to throw down
[1:05:55] your rock a man and throw down your rod
[1:05:59] and pick it up and he threw it on the
[1:06:01] rod it turned into a snake he picked it
[1:06:02] up and returned to a stick again also
[1:06:05] Moses a man was told to put his hand
[1:06:08] down in his bosom and when he pulled it
[1:06:10] out it was widest leprous and then God
[1:06:13] toasted and I put it back down there
[1:06:14] again
[1:06:14] and he put it back down and it was
[1:06:16] healed praise God he had these two sides
[1:06:19] glory that he was given a man but even
[1:06:23] with all the supernatural the burning
[1:06:26] bush the stick turned into a snake and
[1:06:29] turn him back to a stick again a man the
[1:06:31] putting his hand in his bosom and then
[1:06:33] turning lepers and then putting it back
[1:06:35] in it and it being here with all those
[1:06:37] supernatural manifestations Moses still
[1:06:40] was reluctant to go down a man and
[1:06:43] deliver the children of Israel he began
[1:06:45] to talk about his inability to speak
[1:06:49] let's pick this up in perfect strength
[1:06:51] by perfect witness with our perfect
[1:06:53] weakness because you know we've seen
[1:06:55] supernatural - we've heard supernatural
[1:06:58] testimonies we've experienced it right
[1:07:00] in our church but some of us some of us
[1:07:02] are still giving God excuses as to why
[1:07:05] we came do what we need to do a man some
[1:07:09] us giving excuses where we can't
[1:07:10] accomplish some of the things that God
[1:07:12] has laid before us to accomplish and I
[1:07:14] want to tell you that two excuses a man
[1:07:16] only satisfy you but they don't satisfy
[1:07:19] God when you praying to God and
[1:07:22] presenting him your excuses let me tell
[1:07:24] you something God does not feel sorry
[1:07:26] for you
[1:07:26] hallelujah you only feel sorry for
[1:07:28] yourself you got to shake that spirit a
[1:07:31] man of defeat and and and and and doubt
[1:07:34] you got to shake that yourself cuz God
[1:07:36] don't feel sorry for you and I'm gonna
[1:07:38] give you a quote brother Branham says
[1:07:39] this is perfect stream power perfect
[1:07:41] weakness says did God feel sorry for
[1:07:42] Moses with all of his weakness
[1:07:45] I said poor little Moses something sure
[1:07:48] has happened to you you fail from your
[1:07:51] degree oh my here ya are you was a great
[1:07:55] man and intellectual there wasn't nothin
[1:07:58] going to stop your brother you had all
[1:08:00] your PhDs and ll DS and everything else
[1:08:02] and now here you come confessing that
[1:08:06] you are nothing you can't do a thing
[1:08:08] you're just so weak no God wasn't sorry
[1:08:12] for him God never took pity on him God
[1:08:17] had him cured then all of that stuff he
[1:08:21] wasn't sorry for him but we found out if
[1:08:23] you're putting it down Exodus 4:14 the
[1:08:26] anger of God was kindled against him God
[1:08:29] wasn't sorry for him because he was weak
[1:08:31] look at this it says you say Oh Lord I
[1:08:34] just feel so bad I don't believe I could
[1:08:37] do it God don't feel sorry for you
[1:08:45] God don't feel sorry for you actually
[1:08:48] it's what God feels feels like kicking
[1:08:50] you around a little bit
[1:08:52] oh my you've given God all your excuses
[1:08:56] of God ready to kick you around a little
[1:08:58] bit look it's that see sure sure God
[1:09:01] don't feel sorry for you he gets angry
[1:09:03] with you
[1:09:04] you're just getting in shape then to
[1:09:07] where he can use you yeah Moses getting
[1:09:09] Curt cured up God can use him he had the
[1:09:12] cure he was he was away from his human
[1:09:15] ability since he didn't have nothing he
[1:09:17] could rely upon then because he was
[1:09:19] ready then for the service now you see
[1:09:22] Moses now was ready to go down into
[1:09:24] Egypt get rid of all of his excuses
[1:09:27] God's done the supernatural and now God
[1:09:30] is ready to use this prophetic sign and
[1:09:32] Moses Amen that's judgment to the
[1:09:35] Egyptians and when Moses goes down and
[1:09:38] throws this rod in front of pharaoh and
[1:09:40] pharaoh says that's a cheap magician
[1:09:43] trip rather than moses get afraid and
[1:09:45] mul just feel like oh god something on
[1:09:48] something that went wrong Moses stood
[1:09:49] still I want to tell you to do the same
[1:09:52] thing stand still and see the salvation
[1:09:54] of the Lord glory to God don't get all
[1:09:56] frustrated don't get flustered that
[1:09:58] stance
[1:09:58] still watch God bring you out so he
[1:10:01] threw down the rod and and when when
[1:10:02] Pharaoh threw down is had his magicians
[1:10:04] turn on the rocks they rise also unto
[1:10:06] snakes but before you're not Moses snake
[1:10:08] ate up thick rope
[1:10:10] snakes hallelujah now you know in many
[1:10:13] churches they telling the same story
[1:10:16] today Lord I got many churches people
[1:10:19] are excited about what God did for Moses
[1:10:22] way back then but many of them cannot
[1:10:24] bring it closer mininum cannot see God
[1:10:28] using a ministry the same way today we
[1:10:31] might not be throwing down sticks but we
[1:10:33] still see the same supernatural God
[1:10:35] moving on the scene hallelujah glory to
[1:10:39] God God you just a prophetic sign before
[1:10:43] judgment right before it's rare I mean
[1:10:48] for each it was jerked a profit within
[1:10:50] the land the prophet Moses Moses Moses
[1:10:55] was told by God said not now they're not
[1:10:57] gonna receive you went to go down to
[1:10:58] Egypt even when you throw it on the
[1:11:00] stick they're not gonna see but God told
[1:11:01] most saying that when this happened and
[1:11:03] that happened he said call for blood
[1:11:06] turn their waters into blood Moses had
[1:11:10] the power to speak out of his own mouth
[1:11:12] then change the situation
[1:11:14] he had the power to bind and he had the
[1:11:17] power to loose Moses called for blood
[1:11:22] Moses called for frogs
[1:11:24] Moses calls for lice or gnats and you
[1:11:27] know and the thing about it is that uh
[1:11:30] some of the magician magician's of
[1:11:32] Pharaoh's court was trying to do the
[1:11:34] exact same thing but Moses every time he
[1:11:37] just kept stepping it up another level
[1:11:39] stepping it up another level step until
[1:11:42] he got to report them I'm just saying we
[1:11:44] can't do nothing with this he call for
[1:11:47] blood
[1:11:48] he called for frogs it called the licen
[1:11:51] at sea it called for flies amen the
[1:11:54] livestock of Egypt was actually
[1:11:57] destroyed and in the livestock of there
[1:12:00] in Goshen amongst that the children
[1:12:02] Israel theirs was spared God was showing
[1:12:04] the difference all the time he called
[1:12:06] for Boyles he called for hell he called
[1:12:10] for locusts
[1:12:10] he called for dark
[1:12:12] and the last thing was depth to the
[1:12:14] firstborn if you did not apply the blood
[1:12:16] or the token amen to your door something
[1:12:20] struck me and I want to just present
[1:12:23] this to you ten plagues struck Egypt ten
[1:12:28] hallelujah glory to God if we were
[1:12:31] living in that time a man we just got
[1:12:34] one right now on the earth and we can't
[1:12:36] handle that if 10 was to strike us what
[1:12:40] would it do to the people now I want to
[1:12:42] tell you something like and I can almost
[1:12:43] assure you ten plagues struck Egypt and
[1:12:46] not one Egyptian repented know each if
[1:12:53] she's repented think about that ten
[1:12:56] plague struck Egypt drove nobody to
[1:13:00] repentance and I want to tell you a man
[1:13:02] coronavirus has hit the earth and the
[1:13:05] churches are not full yet people still
[1:13:08] thinking about partying my god scene is
[1:13:12] on the increase in the midst of a virus
[1:13:15] how nobody even thinking about God it
[1:13:18] shows there was something wrong
[1:13:20] somewhere something wrong with the
[1:13:22] people's spirit but I do have some good
[1:13:24] news for the bride even though amen the
[1:13:27] Egyptians never came to repentance just
[1:13:30] like today the world itself Amen is
[1:13:32] represented in Egypt they have not come
[1:13:34] to repentance but when those planes
[1:13:36] struck hallelujah it did create an
[1:13:40] exodus for the children of Israel
[1:13:43] hallelujah look at why this plague is
[1:13:46] striped it may create a third Exodus for
[1:13:50] the pride of Christ and Exodus to get
[1:13:52] out of here
[1:13:53] praise God it might not have an impact
[1:13:57] on the Egyptians but it certainly had an
[1:14:00] impact only Israel's I Israelites it
[1:14:03] might not have an impact on the world
[1:14:04] today but it's certainly gonna have an
[1:14:06] impact on the Bride of Christ glory to
[1:14:09] God hallelujah
[1:14:10] it was a judgment rocked it was a
[1:14:14] judgment robbed let me just read this
[1:14:16] out of take the rod and gather the
[1:14:19] people Moses was a prophetic sign before
[1:14:25] judgment
[1:14:26] was to strike Egypt look at this the
[1:14:30] Prophet says in the robbed that Moses
[1:14:31] had in his hand it was not the rod of
[1:14:34] Moses a man it was the rod of God God's
[1:14:39] judgment wrought a man Moses held it out
[1:14:43] over Egypt and flies came up he held it
[1:14:46] out and fleas came up wherever he dumped
[1:14:50] this robbed it robbed it was a judgment
[1:14:52] rock it brought judgment upon a
[1:14:55] disobedient people and the rock was
[1:14:59] Christ the substitute for sin and
[1:15:02] sickness glory and Moses took the
[1:15:05] judgment rod and smote the rock to bring
[1:15:08] forth water therefore it was the
[1:15:10] judgment rod of God that smote Jesus and
[1:15:14] killed him the innocent one and brought
[1:15:17] from him flowed the holy spirit to a
[1:15:20] perishing people now that we'd have life
[1:15:23] no more do we smite the rock but we
[1:15:27] speak to the rock no more do we smite
[1:15:31] the rock but we speak to the rock and
[1:15:33] watch denounce a man in pronouns he said
[1:15:37] speak to the rock and it shall bring
[1:15:39] forth his personal pronoun his water
[1:15:43] speak to the rock and I shall bring
[1:15:45] forth his water brother branham just
[1:15:48] giving us the types there we no longer
[1:15:50] strike the rock you know even in Moses
[1:15:53] day he he struck the rock twice and and
[1:15:56] by him striking it twice it caused Moses
[1:15:58] to miss going to the promised land I
[1:16:01] want to say this church a man above
[1:16:04] everything here the church we're gonna
[1:16:06] keep the Word of God at the forefront
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] we're gonna keep the commandment of God
[1:16:12] at the forefront Moses gift actually
[1:16:14] caused him to miss the promised land
[1:16:16] hallelujah if Moses would have kept his
[1:16:19] gift and checked with the word he would
[1:16:21] have been alright but he got ahead of
[1:16:23] the Word of God and and even though he
[1:16:26] struck the rock twice and he got results
[1:16:29] amen amen I want you to catch that
[1:16:32] somebody may may have a gifting life
[1:16:34] they may get results even with a gift
[1:16:36] but if their gift is not in accordance
[1:16:39] to the word
[1:16:40] forget about the gift a man as spirit
[1:16:43] and truth we gonna put the word before
[1:16:45] the gift I'm gonna say that again we're
[1:16:48] gonna put the word before the gift hey
[1:16:52] man the gift must come in line with the
[1:16:56] word glory to God what's the use in
[1:17:00] having all these manifestations and mr.
[1:17:02] promise land
[1:17:04] Alleluia not me I don't want that that
[1:17:07] my objective and this is the problem
[1:17:09] many people they're their main objective
[1:17:10] is just to be seen
[1:17:12] that's not my objective my objective is
[1:17:15] to make a rapture hallelujah I don't
[1:17:19] need to be seen as long as I make a
[1:17:21] rapture I'm brother Coleman said it
[1:17:25] years ago you can call me this and you
[1:17:27] can call me that but whatever you do
[1:17:29] just don't call me late for the rapture
[1:17:32] praise God hallelujah can we go a little
[1:17:38] further
[1:17:39] hey man I'm going back picking up this
[1:17:42] quote out of pergamene church ancient
[1:17:46] the angel wrote to the Prophet told him
[1:17:48] pick up his pen and write and he wrote
[1:17:50] this the Prophet wrote this to us say
[1:17:52] the strange behavior scroll down there a
[1:17:57] little bit for me it should be the next
[1:18:00] paragraph right there the strange
[1:18:02] behavior a Moses Elijah and John
[1:18:06] withdrawing from the people into
[1:18:08] seclusion left many confuse they did not
[1:18:13] realize that it was because their
[1:18:15] messages had been rejected but the seed
[1:18:18] had been sold the planting was a
[1:18:20] judgment was next they served their
[1:18:23] purpose a sign to the people suggestion
[1:18:25] was next when we look at Exodus chapter
[1:18:27] 3 Moses had felt that when he killed
[1:18:31] that one Egyptian he felt that his
[1:18:33] brothers knew that he was there to be
[1:18:35] their deliverer but he was gonna try to
[1:18:37] take one Egyptian out at a time that was
[1:18:39] his plan that wasn't God's plan and when
[1:18:41] he rose up and he told her brothers you
[1:18:44] say brothers why y'all fighting among
[1:18:45] ourselves don't do that don't do this
[1:18:46] and one guy say oh you're gonna kill me
[1:18:48] like you killed the Egyptian and you say
[1:18:50] he realized that those guys I mean that
[1:18:53] is present
[1:18:53] his countrymen we're not ready to
[1:18:55] receive his gift
[1:18:56] so Moses took off running and and here
[1:18:59] he is sitting on the backside of the
[1:19:00] desert for he lived 40 years in Egypt on
[1:19:03] the backside of the desert for 40 years
[1:19:05] and here this man has spent all this
[1:19:06] time
[1:19:07] amen in chapter 1 and chapter 2 finally
[1:19:10] getting to a place where God can use
[1:19:11] them 80 years old before God can really
[1:19:14] use it he's in seclusion he's in
[1:19:17] isolation and the reason that he's in
[1:19:20] seclusion and in isolation is because
[1:19:22] he's built his own complex hallelujah
[1:19:26] stay with me here Church he has built
[1:19:28] his own complex that's why he had the
[1:19:30] burning bush experience because he built
[1:19:32] a complex hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:19:38] glory glory I think I want to just touch
[1:19:42] on that a man just for a little bit if I
[1:19:46] can just find this definition of a
[1:19:50] complex it's it's a related group of
[1:19:54] emotionally significant ideas that are
[1:19:58] completely or partly repressed that
[1:20:02] cause psychic conflict leading to
[1:20:04] abnormal mental state or behavior now
[1:20:07] now pretty much what happens that you
[1:20:09] make this stuff up in your mind you make
[1:20:12] up how people gonna receive you you make
[1:20:16] up how people are gonna respond and how
[1:20:18] this gonna happen
[1:20:19] you make it up in your mind Moses made
[1:20:22] up in his mind say you know what I don't
[1:20:24] think they're gonna be able to receive
[1:20:26] me so I might as well leave Egypt he was
[1:20:28] going off his mama's experience he's
[1:20:31] going off his mama's testimony of who he
[1:20:34] was hallelujah and and even though he
[1:20:37] had Mama's testimony it was not enough
[1:20:40] to stabilize Moses when the pressure
[1:20:42] came when them brothers say what you
[1:20:44] gonna do kill us like you're kill of the
[1:20:46] other Gyptian Moses decided in time take
[1:20:49] off running but when it came back with a
[1:20:51] stick in his hand hallelujah there was
[1:20:54] nobody strong enough to push Moses Amen
[1:20:58] off the scene a man he had his own
[1:21:01] personal testimony his own experience
[1:21:04] with God our complex is something
[1:21:06] you build yourself now let me just kind
[1:21:10] of go back I'll come back to that in
[1:21:12] just a second
[1:21:13] oh no I'm a sadist now I'm a sadist now
[1:21:17] this complex it's something that brother
[1:21:21] Branham had oh my he built it himself he
[1:21:26] was having a problem with the people he
[1:21:29] just couldn't get him to line up with
[1:21:31] the word of God call them Ricky's Andrew
[1:21:34] Kenneth and and all kind of names and
[1:21:36] God told say don't you know he told he
[1:21:38] told he brother Branham used to preach
[1:21:40] to say if you got a child named Ricky
[1:21:43] change the name you say change name they
[1:21:46] say because names Kerry speaking spirits
[1:21:49] and he says say I would never call my
[1:21:51] mother my child Ricky I think Ricky
[1:21:53] meant rat that's something like that say
[1:21:55] don't call it don't call it the child
[1:21:57] Ricky so he said he wouldn't even say he
[1:21:59] kept calling the people Ricky's and Rick
[1:22:01] ettus hallelujah he built a complex he
[1:22:04] forgot the feeling of the people now you
[1:22:07] know there's a time brother branham gave
[1:22:11] a testimony about a young girl and I
[1:22:13] want to read just a little bit about her
[1:22:15] this has come out a message an uncertain
[1:22:18] sound coming out of the message an
[1:22:21] uncertain sound hallelujah it says this

[1:24:17] lovely daughters she married a fine man
[1:24:20] a brother huff now this is another one
[1:24:23] just to help some of the some of the
[1:24:25] saints out a man brother branham say
[1:24:27] this girl lady used to be a girlfriend
[1:24:29] of her he didn't marry her so it's okay
[1:24:33] if you don't marry the person glory to
[1:24:35] God and you if they don't work out it is
[1:24:38] okay brother Branham went through that
[1:24:39] all right I'm just leaving it out there

[1:24:44] men oh you don't
[1:24:45] a man know what you're getting yourself
[1:24:46] into all right he says brother huff and
[1:24:50] he was a meal right he had it one of his
[1:24:53] fingers and thumbs cut off a very nice
[1:24:55] brother and they had two twins and
[1:24:58] another girl making three children and
[1:25:00] the twins were staunch Christians see
[1:25:04] III I like that word
[1:25:07] we need start creatures vote that
[1:25:11] enemies just move by whatever come this
[1:25:14] other girl wasn't staunch now look at
[1:25:16] this says that the twins a man they were
[1:25:19] starts Christians they were ube people
[1:25:22] but they really how they really believe
[1:25:24] God if so one little girl going to
[1:25:26] school she got a complex the girls tell
[1:25:29] her well why don't you smoke like we do
[1:25:33] you think you better than we are why
[1:25:35] don't you go to dances now they didn't
[1:25:37] go to dances neither did they smoke
[1:25:39] smoke a drink and they made fun the
[1:25:42] healthier girl she said when you try
[1:25:44] help you're spiritually healthy the
[1:25:47] healthier girl she said who let them
[1:25:50] jump in the river I'm the one serving
[1:25:53] Christ so she freedom I stand you wanna
[1:25:55] smoke you wanna drink you go do that on
[1:25:57] your own
[1:25:57] you ain't got nothin to do with it
[1:26:00] that's what I starch Christian will say
[1:26:04] hallelujah but somebody's a little weak
[1:26:06] and wishy-washy look at what happens now
[1:26:09] says let him trumpeter I'm the one I'm
[1:26:11] the one serving Christ they don't want
[1:26:12] to let him go ahead and we need people
[1:26:14] like that they said by the little but
[1:26:17] the other one she began to think so just
[1:26:19] by her beginning to think she actually
[1:26:21] had a complex that she was developing it
[1:26:24] was something in her own mind says oh
[1:26:26] maybe I could do something and she built
[1:26:29] a complex got nervous
[1:26:31] she went insane and I want you to notice
[1:26:36] that just by building a complex just by
[1:26:39] saying you know what you know these
[1:26:41] people think that we better him I'm not
[1:26:43] better than I can just be amongst them I
[1:26:45] can just be with them I can do this I
[1:26:47] can do that building a complex not even
[1:26:49] realizing it amen and she got that
[1:26:52] and she begin to compromise the girl
[1:26:54] lost her mind through compromising and I
[1:26:57] noticed the people that brought her out
[1:26:58] there they still doing exactly what they
[1:27:00] was doing but the one that went amongst
[1:27:02] them lost her mind
[1:27:05] loss of mine look at this she the one
[1:27:09] went to the insane institution so they
[1:27:12] had her in an institution two years and
[1:27:14] so they was trying to doctor her by
[1:27:17] giving a little little kinds of stuff in
[1:27:19] treatments and everything it didn't work
[1:27:21] now so I was I was looking at this a man
[1:27:25] this young lady I couldn't read the
[1:27:27] quote is quite long to view if you want
[1:27:29] to go back in and beyond the screen on
[1:27:31] certain sounds you can go back in just
[1:27:32] and and just just just listen to the
[1:27:34] message to read the quote but I just
[1:27:36] kind of took it in that and and
[1:27:38] summarized a little bit but this this
[1:27:39] young lady built the complex because of
[1:27:41] the peer pressure that she was under she
[1:27:44] and her sisters were real strong
[1:27:46] Christians
[1:27:47] but she began to listen to the outside
[1:27:50] influences and by listening to the
[1:27:53] outside influences she developed a
[1:27:55] complex that complex caused her to end
[1:27:58] up in isolation because complexes will
[1:28:00] do that complexes the complex caused
[1:28:03] Moses to go to the backside of the
[1:28:06] desert isolation Jesus help us brother
[1:28:09] branham was also thinking about going to
[1:28:12] the to the to the wilderness isolation
[1:28:14] complexes will cause people to go into
[1:28:17] isolation amen he or she was an
[1:28:20] isolation in an insane institution but
[1:28:23] what happened is that they called for
[1:28:25] the Prophet to come he pick up picked up
[1:28:26] the telephone call and I went when he
[1:28:29] went a man down to the house and and met
[1:28:32] with the family he rode down to this
[1:28:34] insane institution with with the other
[1:28:37] two daughters the two twins there was in
[1:28:38] the car with brother branham and then
[1:28:40] also the mom and dad was in another
[1:28:42] colony they took going down to this
[1:28:44] institution to go talk to the that the
[1:28:47] youngest daughter and when they got down
[1:28:48] there a man as they were on the way
[1:28:50] brother branham just began to talk with
[1:28:51] the girls in the car just having a
[1:28:52] conversation with him and and the girls
[1:28:55] just began to say you know brother
[1:28:56] branham at church today pastor was
[1:28:58] talking and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:29:00] Spirit just turned and he began to start
[1:29:02] talking about healing and he was just
[1:29:04] really talk about healing and we knew
[1:29:06] that you were coming so when they
[1:29:08] started talk about healing it was a
[1:29:09] confirmation to us that God was gonna do
[1:29:11] so
[1:29:11] say mom and start crying and daddy start
[1:29:14] crying we start crying in church because
[1:29:16] we knew God was gonna do so if the girl
[1:29:18] said say say brother branham you thank
[1:29:19] God gonna do somebody say well let's
[1:29:21] just wait and see let's just wait and
[1:29:22] see what the Lord does so when they went
[1:29:24] on down there to the insane institution
[1:29:26] brother Branham beginning to talk to the
[1:29:28] girl him and it says sister you remember
[1:29:31] me I'm I'm bill Branham the girl just
[1:29:34] looking at him like she crazy couldn't
[1:29:36] couldn't figure out who he was I'm bill
[1:29:37] Branham you don't remember me said I
[1:29:39] remember you as a little child he was
[1:29:41] dis she was that he said he kept talking
[1:29:42] to it trying to pick up her spirits
[1:29:45] hallelujah and the girl just was not
[1:29:48] responding to him and then I finally say
[1:29:50] he felt the Spirit of God come in and a
[1:29:52] vision showed up Oh glory glory glory
[1:29:56] glory now I remember I read
[1:29:59] you earlier a man how brother branham
[1:30:02] identified the minister of Jesus Christ
[1:30:04] when he told Philip who he was when he
[1:30:07] told Nathaniel who he was when he told
[1:30:09] Peter who he was he said that was the
[1:30:12] ministry that identified God was gonna
[1:30:14] raise up a prophet like unto Moses it
[1:30:17] was identified in Jesus Christ when he
[1:30:19] begin to share the secrets of the heart
[1:30:22] that same ministry was identified in
[1:30:25] brother Branham because he told this
[1:30:26] young lady say now you know you might
[1:30:27] not remember me he says but I remember
[1:30:31] you as a young say say the Lord just
[1:30:34] showed me that you had a desire in your
[1:30:36] heart as a young girl that was going to
[1:30:39] marry a preacher and say soon as he told
[1:30:41] a girl that something snapped on the
[1:30:43] inside of her hallelujah you had a
[1:30:46] design your heart that she was gonna
[1:30:47] raise up and marry a preacher hallelujah
[1:30:50] just that little information nobody else
[1:30:53] knew that but that girl knew soon as
[1:30:55] that was revealed to her she was set
[1:30:57] free from the spirit that had her in
[1:31:00] bondage the complex that that she had
[1:31:02] developed now she got delivered because
[1:31:04] a secret of her heart was revealed I am
[1:31:08] praying that God will again begin to
[1:31:11] reveal the secrets of people's hearts
[1:31:13] then they will know that God is on the
[1:31:15] scene she was delivered from a complex
[1:31:19] because of the secret of her heart being
[1:31:22] revealed Moses was given two sides throw
[1:31:28] the rock down pick it up put your hand
[1:31:31] and your bosom pull it out brother
[1:31:34] Branham was also given two sides one was
[1:31:38] touch people with your hand and you'll
[1:31:41] be able to tell what their troubles is
[1:31:42] that was his first pull then the second
[1:31:45] pull was that he would have the ability
[1:31:47] to reveal the secrets of the heart that
[1:31:49] was his second pool to science but also
[1:31:52] God gave brother Branham a man another
[1:31:55] level he says you're gonna also have a
[1:31:57] third pool which would be the opening of
[1:31:59] the word every mystery according to
[1:32:02] revelation 10 7 will be revealed by this
[1:32:06] ministry oh how I love the Lord Jesus
[1:32:10] brother branham developed a complex
[1:32:14] he developed a complex his ministry was
[1:32:19] to come before judgment moses ministry
[1:32:23] came before god brought judgment to
[1:32:26] egypt brother branham's ministry was to
[1:32:28] come according to Malachi chapter four
[1:32:31] verse five and six amen
[1:32:34] we'll read it real quick it says behold
[1:32:37] I will send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:32:40] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:32:44] Lord that is a day of judgment so so
[1:32:47] before judgment God promises to send a
[1:32:50] prophetic sign before judgment verse six
[1:32:53] a man says and he shall turn the heart
[1:32:56] of the father's to the children and the
[1:32:59] heart of children to their fathers lest
[1:33:00] I come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:33:03] we can see a man Moses ministry we can
[1:33:08] get excited about how God used Moses but
[1:33:11] there's other scriptures that God is
[1:33:12] also manifesting a man in Malachi four
[1:33:15] five and six was applied for this day by
[1:33:17] God's thinness Elijah a man before this

[1:33:28] signs of it right now but you know

[1:36:51] fella look look like me wobbled up says
[1:36:54] they had been standing over a campfire
[1:36:56] with smoke all over them faces dirty I
[1:36:59] think they're breakfast together the man
[1:37:01] must have had must have paid 20 cents
[1:37:03] maybe a cup of coffee or something
[1:37:05] my heart bounced within me I watched and
[1:37:08] Billy said what's the matter with you I
[1:37:09] said nothing and I watched and if they
[1:37:12] went around and went out he said daddy
[1:37:13] what's the matter I said nothing he's
[1:37:15] got and he got in the car said he said
[1:37:17] do you mind driving again I said no he
[1:37:19] said I'm still sleepy so he went to
[1:37:21] sleep and I went speed down the road
[1:37:24] about 55 miles an hour in the truck over
[1:37:27] the mountains coming on towards the
[1:37:29] border now coming out coming home to
[1:37:31] Arizona and but I was coming now into
[1:37:34] Utah and as I got there coming down from
[1:37:37] the mountains about 20 miles out of City
[1:37:39] just heard it as I told you about about
[1:37:45] the morning about the squirrels and all
[1:37:46] these things how something somebody went
[1:37:48] to talking to me a voice just the same
[1:37:51] as you hear my not notice how brother
[1:37:53] I'm saying somebody went to talking to
[1:37:54] me if we can believe that a voice spoke
[1:37:58] to Moses out of a bush then we can also
[1:38:01] believe brother branham was talking to
[1:38:03] that same God while he was driving down
[1:38:05] the street in his car Sarah Mary went to
[1:38:09] talking to me a voice just the same as
[1:38:11] you hear mine I know it sounds
[1:38:13] neurotically but as I've got through
[1:38:16] expressing have I ever told you anything
[1:38:18] but what was right and a voice got to
[1:38:21] talking and I was talking to him it said
[1:38:23] carry out your plans and you'll be like
[1:38:27] that I said lord I don't want to be like
[1:38:30] that said your wife will go - she won't
[1:38:33] live up there in them heels like that
[1:38:35] you'll become a bum just a shoot at just
[1:38:38] as the dream showed you would I said I
[1:38:42] don't want to be that I want to be I
[1:38:45] don't want to live like that I don't
[1:38:46] have to live like that I don't want to
[1:38:47] do something different
[1:38:48] but I was told that you had called me to
[1:38:51] be a prophet not brother branham is
[1:38:52] starting to reason
[1:38:53] God now this statements gonna be very
[1:38:55] very important as we come up to it just
[1:38:57] get his reason with God he's still in
[1:38:59] his complex right
[1:39:01] and his reason guy says you you know I
[1:39:02] was told that you had called me to be a
[1:39:06] prophet and I want to live in the
[1:39:08] wilderness like the prophets but I was
[1:39:11] using my own excuse so I could hunt my
[1:39:15] own good God can read through that I'm
[1:39:18] looking at what God tell the Prophet and
[1:39:20] he said but that was the prophets of the
[1:39:25] Old Testament you've been called to be
[1:39:29] there in a much higher office than that
[1:39:33] how are you office than what Moses Act
[1:39:36] now you think about that one because we
[1:39:39] can believe Moses we can rejoice over
[1:39:41] Moses but the Prophet that God sent you
[1:39:44] call you he was called to a higher
[1:39:45] office than what all Old Testament
[1:39:48] prophets had and I'm gonna tell you why
[1:39:50] he was called to higher office because
[1:39:52] he's introducing Messiah you've been
[1:40:01] called to be up there in a much higher
[1:40:03] office in that he said you have more
[1:40:06] gifts besides that you was called to
[1:40:09] pray for the sick not only that and to
[1:40:13] preach the gospel and in the apostolic
[1:40:16] forum you know of greater things many
[1:40:20] great yes so how do you why do you wait
[1:40:26] for me to movie every time you move
[1:40:30] where's your reward then I seen and then
[1:40:34] I said do you remember I told you do you
[1:40:36] remember what brother Robeson told you
[1:40:38] in your dream in his dream or vision
[1:40:39] that you had done like Moses you forgot
[1:40:42] the feeling of your people you forgot
[1:40:45] the call that I called you to I let the
[1:40:50] sick lay I want the Lord to tell me
[1:40:53] where to go and not to that's wrong I
[1:40:55] had built myself a complex because the
[1:40:59] people did hear my message and if God
[1:41:02] forbid that I'll try to compare the life
[1:41:04] of now like Moses
[1:41:07] but it's exactly what Moses did a man my
[1:41:11] god exactly what Moses did the people
[1:41:15] were listening to him when he come to
[1:41:17] deliver them so he just left them alone
[1:41:19] and went into the wilderness but God
[1:41:22] turned him around and he had long forgot
[1:41:24] the suffering he long forgot the
[1:41:28] suffering people he says and then I said
[1:41:30] Lord how could I that's right with no
[1:41:33] education that's the same excuses that
[1:41:35] Moses used I can't speak I came this I
[1:41:38] came that since with no education with a
[1:41:39] grammar school education be able and the
[1:41:42] people are standing and rose and
[1:41:43] everywhere to hear the simple gospel
[1:41:45] it's more it's greater now than it was
[1:41:48] under the Old Covenant he is sending on
[1:41:50] high he gave gifts unto man Jesus Christ
[1:41:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:41:55] then I was talking I heard of talking to
[1:41:57] me and it left me Moses had a complex
[1:42:04] brother Branham had a complex we all get
[1:42:08] complexes but I tell you what it doesn't
[1:42:11] stop God from manifesting himself in our
[1:42:14] lives
[1:42:14] amen the reason Moses on the backside of
[1:42:17] that desert is because of the complex
[1:42:20] that put him there brother Branham was
[1:42:22] on his way to the to the wilderness to
[1:42:24] the backside of the desert because of a
[1:42:26] complex that was putting there that girl
[1:42:28] went to a insane institution because of
[1:42:31] a complex that put there but God had a
[1:42:34] prophetic voice to go to the insane
[1:42:37] institution pull that girl out God also
[1:42:40] had a prophetic voice to come to us to
[1:42:42] pull us out of our insane institutions
[1:42:45] denominations hallelujah
[1:42:47] pulled us out hallelujah amen and we're
[1:42:51] free because God has set us free I want
[1:42:53] to tell you something church listen and
[1:42:55] obey the prophetic sign that God has
[1:42:59] sent us before judgment thank God for
[1:43:04] his prophetic sign god bless you
[1:43:12] let's pray over the word of the Lord
[1:43:16] father I thank your God your words Lord
[1:43:22] Jesus it's really your word is true God
[1:43:28] we can we can go back and pick up the
[1:43:31] Bible as many have picked up their Bible
[1:43:34] and just looked at Exodus chapter 3
[1:43:36] today and told the story of Moses and
[1:43:39] what happened at the burning bush the
[1:43:41] Lord can they see a prophet but their
[1:43:44] day come and Lord a man according to
[1:43:47] scripture God to bring a truth to the
[1:43:50] people to bring them out Lord and and
[1:43:54] and just as Moses even said the Lord
[1:43:56] your God shall raise up a prophet like
[1:43:58] unto me brother Branham identifies Jesus
[1:44:01] Christ as that prophet that was like
[1:44:04] unto Moses and we can see it clearly in
[1:44:06] Scripture we believe that but the way he
[1:44:09] identifies him is through a man the
[1:44:11] ability Lord to reveal the secrets of
[1:44:16] the heart God and how we saw the same
[1:44:20] thing manifested in your prophet today
[1:44:23] revealing the secrets of the heart that
[1:44:28] one girl they're 18 years old stuck in
[1:44:33] an insane institution because she let
[1:44:35] down the bars father of Lord of her
[1:44:39] convictions
[1:44:40] she caught a complex and it drove her
[1:44:42] crazy a demon drove a crazy got because
[1:44:46] she let down the bars one time Oh God
[1:44:50] but a prophet went in with a mind of
[1:44:53] Christ the sermon of spirit Lord that
[1:44:55] second pool ministry manifesting itself
[1:44:58] Lord and that girl and one sit reveal
[1:45:01] that she she had a desire when she was a
[1:45:05] young woman to marry a preacher that was
[1:45:07] her desire that was in her heart and
[1:45:09] maybe she looked at a condition and she
[1:45:11] said how am I gonna do it in this insane
[1:45:13] institution but God went when the word
[1:45:16] came forth and it set her free Lord she
[1:45:19] left that institution I pray that same
[1:45:21] word with
[1:45:22] come forth and set captives free Lord
[1:45:25] many of us have complexes many of us
[1:45:27] have things that we're going through and
[1:45:28] maybe we've let down the bars maybe we
[1:45:31] have given in and and by giving in Lord
[1:45:34] to some of the things that people have
[1:45:35] placed on us God amen now we're dealing
[1:45:38] with things that we never thought we'd
[1:45:40] deal with but God you're able to set us
[1:45:42] free just as you set that girl free I
[1:45:44] pray Lord Jesus that this message would
[1:45:47] be a message of freedom and liberation
[1:45:49] now your your word God would do the work
[1:45:51] even for those that are listening in on
[1:45:54] the stream got me the word go forth and
