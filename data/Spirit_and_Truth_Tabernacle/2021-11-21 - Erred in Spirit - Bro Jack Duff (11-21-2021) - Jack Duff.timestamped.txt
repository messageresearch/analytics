[48:50] he never offered
[48:53] victories without fighting but he said
[48:57] help would always come in time
[49:04] so just remember when you're standing

[58:54] here in luke 4
[58:56] verse 16
[58:58] um
[58:59] it says
[59:00] and he came to nazareth
[59:03] where he had been brought up
[59:05] and as
[59:07] his custom was
[59:10] he went into the synagogue on the
[59:11] sabbath day and stood up
[59:14] for to read
[59:16] and there was delivered unto him the
[59:17] book of the prophet isaiah
[59:20] and when he had opened the book
[59:23] now
[59:24] you know there's so much happening here
[59:26] uh in the scripture
[59:28] first of all in verse 16 we see it was
[59:31] customary
[59:33] for jesus
[59:34] to go to church
[59:37] i said it was customary
[59:40] for jesus
[59:42] to go to church
[59:44] and if it's customary
[59:46] for jesus
[59:50] to go to church
[59:52] then it should also be customary
[59:54] for his people
[59:56] to go to church
[59:58] i see my cousin god bless you cuz
[1:00:01] amen uh here
[1:00:03] it goes on and in the next verse it says
[1:00:05] there was delivered unto him verse 17
[1:00:07] the book of the prophet now didn't it
[1:00:09] doesn't say that jesus asked
[1:00:11] for this book
[1:00:13] it says it was
[1:00:15] delivered unto him
[1:00:17] and when it was delivered unto him he
[1:00:20] found the place where it was written
[1:00:22] let's keep reading
[1:00:24] amen uh it was delivered unto him the
[1:00:26] book of the prophet isaiah and when he
[1:00:28] had opened the book he found the place
[1:00:30] where it was written
[1:00:32] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:00:35] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:00:37] the gospel to the poor
[1:00:40] he have uh sent me to heal the
[1:00:43] brokenhearted now the only person can do
[1:00:45] all this is jesus
[1:00:47] amen to preach deliverance to the
[1:00:49] captives
[1:00:51] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:00:54] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:00:58] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:01:01] lord now he found where it was written
[1:01:04] he read it
[1:01:06] and the bible declares he and he closed
[1:01:09] the book
[1:01:10] and he gave it again to the minister
[1:01:14] and sat down
[1:01:16] and eyes of all them that were in the
[1:01:19] synagogue
[1:01:20] now they weren't looking at the
[1:01:22] minister think about it now they weren't
[1:01:25] looking at them and everybody now why
[1:01:26] would he read something like that
[1:01:28] read it
[1:01:30] sat down
[1:01:32] and said the bible say uh and eyes of
[1:01:34] all of them that were in the synagogue
[1:01:36] were fasting on him
[1:01:40] and he began to say unto them
[1:01:43] this day
[1:01:45] is this scripture
[1:01:48] fulfilled in your ears
[1:01:50] oh my my
[1:01:52] my my my
[1:01:54] well let's just stop right there and
[1:01:56] let's
[1:01:56] have a word of prayer
[1:01:59] father we are
[1:02:02] grateful for the
[1:02:04] opportunity we have to come
[1:02:07] into the house of the lord
[1:02:10] god how we have been blessed by
[1:02:13] uh everything that has happened us
[1:02:15] father song service the specials
[1:02:18] uh we have um
[1:02:20] we've thoroughly enjoyed just being in
[1:02:22] your presence but now we come to
[1:02:25] the word of god and we trust that the
[1:02:27] holy spirit would take control over the
[1:02:29] thought that is being presented today
[1:02:32] use it for your glory
[1:02:34] and for your honor father i want to ask
[1:02:37] a special blessing upon my wife
[1:02:40] lord the enemy attacking her in her body
[1:02:43] but we rebuke the enemy right now in the
[1:02:46] name of jesus and we ask that you would
[1:02:48] touch her and make her completely whole
[1:02:51] even as she's listening in on the line
[1:02:52] father may she feel the spirit of god
[1:02:55] amen just come into the room and touch
[1:02:57] her right where she is
[1:02:58] you're the same god that touched peter's
[1:03:01] mother-in-law and then within an hour
[1:03:04] things were different we believe that
[1:03:06] god still lives today so we're trusting
[1:03:09] god that you have moved by your spirit
[1:03:10] amen upon her and upon anybody else that
[1:03:13] has a need here this morning god we give
[1:03:16] it to you in jesus name we pray amen
[1:03:19] amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:23] um
[1:03:26] i'm taking a thought from this scripture
[1:03:31] that we just read out of luke 4
[1:03:34] our title today is
[1:03:36] aired in
[1:03:38] spirit
[1:03:40] amen aired
[1:03:42] in
[1:03:43] in spirit
[1:03:45] i want you to just bear with me
[1:03:48] as we try to
[1:03:50] uh
[1:03:51] navigate this thought
[1:03:54] uh i want you to just catch that word i
[1:03:56] had uh sister tina just put that up
[1:03:58] there amen a forest so that you not not
[1:04:01] errored but aired
[1:04:04] aired aired
[1:04:06] in spirit and um
[1:04:09] aired actually
[1:04:11] means to
[1:04:12] be mistaken
[1:04:15] or to be incorrect
[1:04:18] or
[1:04:20] to make a mistake
[1:04:21] a man to make a mistake and as i was
[1:04:25] just looking at some of these
[1:04:26] definitions
[1:04:27] uh
[1:04:29] when we use this word there are
[1:04:31] uh little statements that have been made
[1:04:33] they say error i mean air air not air
[1:04:36] but air
[1:04:38] on the right side air on the right side
[1:04:41] which means
[1:04:42] act so that the least harmful of
[1:04:45] possible mistakes or errors is most
[1:04:48] likely to occur
[1:04:51] so when your air on the right side
[1:04:54] you're acting in a way
[1:04:56] so that the least harmful
[1:04:58] of of possible mistakes
[1:05:01] because it's i can tell you this right
[1:05:03] now none of us are perfect
[1:05:06] all of us going to make a mistake
[1:05:08] somewhere along the line but but
[1:05:10] air on the right side
[1:05:12] right because this says act so that the
[1:05:15] least harmful
[1:05:17] of possible mistakes or errors is the
[1:05:20] most likely to occur amen another amen
[1:05:24] uh
[1:05:25] a statement that they kind of uses air
[1:05:27] on the side of caution
[1:05:30] okay and what this means is display more
[1:05:33] rather than less
[1:05:35] of a specified quality in one's action
[1:05:38] so if you're going to err on the side of
[1:05:39] caution that just be be a little bit
[1:05:41] more careful right amen uh just because
[1:05:45] there could be a mistake made but just
[1:05:47] be a little bit more care careful so air
[1:05:49] on the side of caution
[1:05:51] all right and here's another statement
[1:05:53] that is used when we're talking about
[1:05:55] this word air this is to air is human
[1:05:59] glory to god
[1:06:01] to forgive is divine
[1:06:04] amen amen to air is human but to forgive
[1:06:08] is divine and this means uh uh it is
[1:06:11] human nature
[1:06:13] to make mistakes
[1:06:15] hallelujah amen uh it's human nature to
[1:06:19] make mistakes oneself while finding it
[1:06:22] hard to forgive others of theirs
[1:06:26] so terrorist human but to forgive
[1:06:29] is divine
[1:06:32] see we're talking a man that's born on
[1:06:34] air in spirit
[1:06:37] and spirit now now you know
[1:06:39] um
[1:06:41] my my heart
[1:06:42] uh uh moves in the direction of many
[1:06:46] people
[1:06:48] in this day that i feel have aired in
[1:06:50] spirit because they have walked away
[1:06:52] from the word of god
[1:06:54] and let me put it this way they've
[1:06:55] walked away from the revealed word of
[1:06:57] god and oftentimes when people make this
[1:07:00] mistake you begin to see certain things
[1:07:02] creeping to their lives
[1:07:04] it's the truth in it how amen holiness
[1:07:07] what goes right on out the window amen
[1:07:09] but but there there that there's a stand
[1:07:11] that they used to have but because they
[1:07:13] they aired
[1:07:15] because they made a mistake amen
[1:07:17] spiritually
[1:07:19] right because they made a mistake
[1:07:20] spiritually and you start seeing certain
[1:07:23] things creep into their lives now what i
[1:07:25] want to tell you is that when this
[1:07:26] happens uh you gotta have you had a
[1:07:29] certain response that you should have
[1:07:31] and it should be to pray for a person
[1:07:33] glory to god hey man look look you can't
[1:07:36] point your finger at nobody cause when
[1:07:39] you got one finger pointing out like
[1:07:40] this you got four more pointing back at
[1:07:43] you
[1:07:44] hallelujah so when you see somebody's
[1:07:46] heired in spirit you got to pray for him
[1:07:52] so take heed lest you fall
[1:07:56] i want you to just just just stay with
[1:07:58] me here today
[1:07:59] um i want to you know just i'm going to
[1:08:02] read a little bit uh i want to start in
[1:08:04] this message shalom
[1:08:06] is where i want to start just reading
[1:08:08] from and and just this morning i was
[1:08:11] teaching and and um
[1:08:14] actually the two of those songs a man
[1:08:16] this morning's sister sister birds when
[1:08:18] she come out talk about the wise men i
[1:08:19] was teaching this morning talking about
[1:08:21] the wise men i said man what a
[1:08:23] confirmation then when sister rachel
[1:08:25] starts singing um
[1:08:27] i'm still holding on i say well
[1:08:29] i thought about this this message
[1:08:31] because there were many
[1:08:33] that started out with me
[1:08:36] but now
[1:08:38] they've gone astray if i can just put it
[1:08:41] this way they air
[1:08:44] air in the spirit it's just a mistake
[1:08:46] it's just a mistake you can recover from
[1:08:48] a mistake
[1:08:52] you you can recover from a mistake
[1:08:55] you're not defeated because you made a
[1:08:57] mistake
[1:08:58] lord i'm gonna get to this quote but i'm
[1:08:59] reminded of this man that went for a job
[1:09:02] interview
[1:09:03] and he walked into the job interview and
[1:09:04] he and he took a pen i believe it was
[1:09:06] when it went into the interview and the
[1:09:08] boss began to say no no he took a pencil
[1:09:10] but the pencil had no eraser and and
[1:09:13] then when he went in went in there with
[1:09:14] the pencil the boss actually said now
[1:09:16] hey uh i noticed your pistol don't have
[1:09:18] an eraser he said that's because i don't
[1:09:20] make no mistakes he said you ain't gonna
[1:09:22] get this job
[1:09:24] you're not gonna get this job you can go
[1:09:25] ahead and leave because we don't need
[1:09:27] nobody like you around here amen if you
[1:09:29] make a mistake just use the eraser
[1:09:32] glory to god that's why the pencil has
[1:09:35] an eraser all you got to do is erase it
[1:09:37] and rewrite the answer
[1:09:40] hallelujah somebody you can make a
[1:09:42] mistake but you can't recover
[1:09:46] glory to god you can recover
[1:09:49] and jesus himself said he brings
[1:09:51] recovering of sight
[1:09:54] to the blind
[1:10:00] this is not a message to uh condemn
[1:10:03] this is a message just to say look we
[1:10:05] all do it
[1:10:07] we all make mistakes
[1:10:10] but we can recover
[1:10:12] look at this this sermon shalom the
[1:10:14] prophet says this now
[1:10:16] a few about three years ago it will be
[1:10:18] now
[1:10:19] that at home at my home church the holy
[1:10:21] spirit spoke to me and said go to tucson
[1:10:24] there is something waiting
[1:10:26] i stood on this platform and told every
[1:10:29] one of you thus saith the lord something
[1:10:31] is fixing to happen
[1:10:34] it says um
[1:10:35] this there is probably hundreds of
[1:10:37] people sitting here that know it
[1:10:39] i just told you what i saw the message
[1:10:42] is on tape what time is it sir
[1:10:45] i saw a constellation of angels like a
[1:10:47] pyramid come down just north of tucson
[1:10:50] up in this way north of tucson and they
[1:10:53] spoke to me something and i didn't know
[1:10:56] what it was
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:58] and and one day there
[1:11:00] uh there's a man sitting right present
[1:11:02] now two of them that was with me back
[1:11:04] over there when that happened and they
[1:11:07] took the picture of it in the sky
[1:11:10] it come out in the magazine i thought i
[1:11:13] had a copy i do that's it you see it you
[1:11:16] see it here in life magazine this copy
[1:11:19] just exactly the way the holy spirit
[1:11:22] said it would be
[1:11:24] now here you know the prophet had
[1:11:25] already told the people uh years before
[1:11:28] it actually happened and then now when
[1:11:29] it happens uh there are seven angels
[1:11:32] that uh uh form this cloud and you know
[1:11:35] and and we we we we hear a lot of people
[1:11:38] saying that maybe it was a jet that did
[1:11:40] that and you know if you want to give
[1:11:42] credit to the jet i don't i mean fine
[1:11:44] that's more of a miracle than uh then i
[1:11:47] know right because a jet can't even fly
[1:11:49] that high but if a jet got up there and
[1:11:51] created a cloud that big then my god how
[1:11:54] how much more supernatural that is right
[1:11:56] you know and then on top of that when
[1:11:58] when we look at the cloud the way that
[1:11:59] they took the picture in life magazine
[1:12:01] they had no idea what this was and the
[1:12:04] prophet never went to life magazine and
[1:12:07] told them what to do with it he only
[1:12:09] told the bride to turn it to turn the
[1:12:11] picture to the right and when we turned
[1:12:14] it to the right we didn't see brother
[1:12:15] branham
[1:12:18] we saw jesus
[1:12:20] and when we look at this message we
[1:12:22] should still be seeing jesus
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:27] hallelujah look at it now he says uh it
[1:12:30] says and there stood seven ain't those
[1:12:32] seven angels just as natural
[1:12:35] as you see me standing here and told me
[1:12:38] to return to my home that the mysteries
[1:12:40] that the reformers down through the ages
[1:12:42] have failed to pick up the mysteries of
[1:12:44] the bible which the seven seals held
[1:12:46] would be revealed and that's a statement
[1:12:48] that i that i want to bring to you i
[1:12:51] challenge anybody
[1:12:53] get those seven seals and look them over
[1:12:57] glory to god and i don't let not not
[1:12:59] what he's saying is i mean i i should
[1:13:01] have brought one with me but i ain't got
[1:13:02] to hear a seven seal book he said get
[1:13:05] the seventh seal book
[1:13:07] and look it over
[1:13:09] and find fault with them oh glory to god
[1:13:13] right because this not the place that
[1:13:15] people have gone to find fault they've
[1:13:18] gone to a bridge they've gone to a bear
[1:13:21] they've gone to all kind of other places
[1:13:23] but go to the seven seals
[1:13:26] pick it up and read it and find fault
[1:13:29] there
[1:13:33] now i'm gonna tell you how perfect this
[1:13:34] word was that we got because when you
[1:13:36] read revelation 10 i'm i'm just y'all
[1:13:38] just bear with me because this is my
[1:13:40] teaching from this morning i'm just
[1:13:41] giving you a look i'm just giving you
[1:13:42] synopsis amen but uh but but but when
[1:13:45] you read revelation 10 amen give me
[1:13:47] verse one and two real quick
[1:13:49] just give me a real quick revelation 10
[1:13:51] verse one and two and i'm gonna just
[1:13:52] read something here for you just just
[1:13:54] kind of show you something just write in
[1:13:55] the scripture right in the scripture
[1:13:56] revelation 10 verse one and two glory to
[1:13:59] god glory to god look at this look at
[1:14:02] this
[1:14:02] just want to show you something
[1:14:05] here the bible says this and i saw
[1:14:07] another mighty angel come down from
[1:14:10] heaven clothed with a clout
[1:14:12] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:14:14] and his face
[1:14:16] amen uh uh and his face was as it were
[1:14:19] the sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[1:14:22] now now right here this this particular
[1:14:24] scripture brother branham tells us this
[1:14:26] is talking about christ amen this this
[1:14:28] angel this mighty angel is christ
[1:14:31] himself all right now notice verse two
[1:14:33] and he had in his hand
[1:14:35] a little book open now christ is the one
[1:14:39] with the book in his hand
[1:14:41] oh
[1:14:42] glory to god it is christ the one with
[1:14:45] the book in his hand but by here we need
[1:14:48] to understand how did the book get
[1:14:49] revealed to us
[1:14:51] christ decided according to his own word
[1:14:55] that he revealed his secrets to his
[1:14:57] servants the prophets and the prophets
[1:15:00] then reveal it to us
[1:15:02] amen so christ is the one with the book
[1:15:04] in his hand giving the secrets of the
[1:15:06] book to his prophet and now we have that
[1:15:08] in the seven seals that's why he said go
[1:15:12] to the seals
[1:15:14] my god look them over
[1:15:17] and see if you can find fault with them
[1:15:19] don't come with the bridge
[1:15:21] don't come with the the bear
[1:15:23] come with the seven seal book
[1:15:26] that christ himself gave to his prophet
[1:15:30] look him over and find fault there
[1:15:34] let me go on with the rest of this quote
[1:15:36] all right all right all right all right
[1:15:39] aaron in spirit
[1:15:41] all right he says this i challenge
[1:15:42] anybody get those seven seals and look
[1:15:44] them over and find fought with them see
[1:15:46] see because it's given by inspiration of
[1:15:48] god
[1:15:49] it says prior to that i preached on this
[1:15:51] on the seven church ages and then draw
[1:15:53] them out on the blackboard
[1:15:56] in my tabernacle now just just bear with
[1:15:58] me
[1:15:59] amen

[1:16:09] going to get to something here in a
[1:16:10] little bit
[1:16:11] uh
[1:16:12] we're going we're going to talk about
[1:16:13] the anointing
[1:16:15] in a little bit i want to just talk
[1:16:16] about the anointing so you know what the
[1:16:18] anointing is
[1:16:20] hallelujah do you know right now amen
[1:16:24] this is probably one of the most
[1:16:26] anointed messages that you have ever
[1:16:32] heard what you listening to right now
[1:16:36] ain't nobody up on their feet ain't
[1:16:37] nobody jumping and running around the
[1:16:39] building but one of the most anointed
[1:16:41] messages you ever heard

[1:16:48] here and there
[1:16:50] y'all say that's a no it was
[1:16:52] but this right here is one of the most
[1:16:54] anointed messages that you are ever we
[1:16:58] that you will ever hear right now
[1:17:02] all right let me just keep reading y'all
[1:17:03] stay with me amen amen so i wanted to
[1:17:06] just just share he said prior to that he
[1:17:09] preached on the seven church ages and
[1:17:10] draw them out on the blackboard when
[1:17:12] brother branham preached the seven
[1:17:13] church ages god supernaturally
[1:17:16] vindicated
[1:17:17] what his prophet spoke
[1:17:19] and what he did after the church ages
[1:17:21] was over god came into the room and on
[1:17:24] the board on the wall
[1:17:26] drew the very same church age picture
[1:17:29] that brother branham drew on his paper
[1:17:30] god drew it on the wall
[1:17:32] now when that happened there were some
[1:17:33] people that said there was a car that
[1:17:35] came by
[1:17:37] and the lights a man uh in the car
[1:17:39] flashed on the wall and it created this
[1:17:42] this image now that's that's again more
[1:17:45] supernatural than
[1:17:46] than i can even uh imagine you telling
[1:17:49] me where is that car
[1:17:51] i want to see that car that can turn on
[1:17:54] their lights and flash the seven church
[1:17:57] ages on the wall
[1:17:59] they said no it's the holy ghost coming
[1:18:01] to vindicate the word that had been
[1:18:03] preached
[1:18:04] now when brother branham preached the
[1:18:05] seals amen we also had the supernatural
[1:18:09] on display now i'm saying all these
[1:18:11] things to get us to a certain point here
[1:18:13] because you know when we see god
[1:18:15] vindicating his words
[1:18:18] amen then then we see people air in
[1:18:21] their spirits
[1:18:23] after god has vindicated his word you
[1:18:26] gotta guard your spirit
[1:18:30] you gotta guard your spirit you can't
[1:18:33] let people just put anything inside your
[1:18:36] spirit you can't read everything
[1:18:42] you can't be going to every website
[1:18:45] you can't visit every church
[1:18:47] you got to guard your spirit
[1:18:54] because if you don't guard it before you
[1:18:55] know you don't made a mistake in the
[1:18:57] spirit
[1:18:59] you've aired in spirit
[1:19:03] hallelujah see you you know you you got
[1:19:06] your your um uh your body your spirit
[1:19:10] your soul
[1:19:11] right and see that the spirit amen
[1:19:13] that's the realm of things that you
[1:19:15] really you know you can't see it's like
[1:19:17] affections and emotions and and all this
[1:19:19] other kind of ccc
[1:19:22] i mean when you start getting to that
[1:19:23] realm you know memory affections
[1:19:25] emotions uh the devils start playing
[1:19:27] tricks on you there
[1:19:31] and and you're not if you don't guard
[1:19:32] that area right
[1:19:34] before you know your air in your spirit
[1:19:38] and it'll lead you down a path you never
[1:19:40] thought you would go
[1:19:43] but remember if you make a mistake
[1:19:45] there's a way back
[1:19:48] what i want to say here is that uh when
[1:19:50] the seven seals was preached god did
[1:19:53] supernatural things
[1:19:55] amen uh seven angels appeared in arizona
[1:19:58] and told the prophet go back east and
[1:20:01] preach the seals
[1:20:03] you know and out this morning as i was
[1:20:05] reading amen just the story of the wise
[1:20:07] men i was the if you notice in the
[1:20:09] scripture that the wise men came from
[1:20:11] the east
[1:20:12] when they met when they went to
[1:20:14] jerusalem they came from the east they
[1:20:16] went to jerusalem and now now the star
[1:20:18] led them to the proximity as to where
[1:20:21] the christ child had been born
[1:20:23] but is when they got into herod's
[1:20:25] presence and herod went and got the
[1:20:27] scripture
[1:20:29] when he got the scripture began to read
[1:20:31] where christ was fully born then that
[1:20:33] brought them into proximity
[1:20:36] i mean the very presence of sorrow the
[1:20:37] star brought them in proximity but the
[1:20:39] revelation of the word brought them into
[1:20:41] the presence of god
[1:20:44] they were coming from the east
[1:20:47] to the west brother branham was coming
[1:20:49] from the east going out west before the
[1:20:52] seven angels visited him and then the
[1:20:54] seven angels out of the west and tucson
[1:20:56] said go back east and preach the seven
[1:20:58] seals it was the manifestation of
[1:21:00] revelation 10 the angel the mighty angel
[1:21:03] with the book in his hand giving it to
[1:21:05] his prophet to give it to us
[1:21:08] all right stay with me
[1:21:10] glory to god hallelujah now you know
[1:21:15] there are some churches
[1:21:17] that as far as they can go
[1:21:20] is between here
[1:21:24] and there
[1:21:25] that's the only sermon you're here when
[1:21:28] you go to some of those churches
[1:21:30] and it'll get you excited but when you
[1:21:32] get this word
[1:21:34] this revelation word it will anchor you
[1:21:41] it'll anchor you when you start going
[1:21:42] through some things
[1:21:45] glory hallelujah
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] because it's very easy
[1:21:53] to air
[1:21:54] in your spirit
[1:22:00] y'all bear with me
[1:22:02] so uh supernatural things happen when
[1:22:04] the seven angels a man commissioned the
[1:22:07] prophet to go back east and priests and
[1:22:08] seals uh brother branham was concerned
[1:22:11] about what all these supernatural things
[1:22:13] was he start praying amen there in
[1:22:15] tucson i mean in in the mountains of
[1:22:17] tucson arizona and while he's praying
[1:22:19] with his hands lifting the air a king
[1:22:20] sword appears in his hand
[1:22:22] and that king sword happened to be the
[1:22:24] word of god
[1:22:26] not a king but the king's sword
[1:22:29] it was the word of god it fit his hand
[1:22:31] perfectly fit his ministry perfectly
[1:22:33] amen the other thing is that every day
[1:22:35] before he preached the seals an angel
[1:22:37] would meet him daily giving him the
[1:22:39] revelation to seal in the little room
[1:22:44] glory to god
[1:22:45] amen and the other thing where the seven
[1:22:48] angels came down to uh to commission the
[1:22:50] prophet another thing that happened is
[1:22:52] that in the rock of the mountain
[1:22:55] the profile of the prophet was placed
[1:22:58] inside the rock
[1:23:00] god did that
[1:23:02] now i'm saying all these supernatural
[1:23:04] things that happen to show us that god
[1:23:06] was behind this message that we're that
[1:23:08] we're that we're following here
[1:23:11] but people reject the supernatural
[1:23:14] and they're airing
[1:23:16] in their spirit
[1:23:19] stay with me and y'all y'all gonna find
[1:23:22] by the time we get to the end of this
[1:23:24] i'm gonna read it to you right out in
[1:23:25] the bible
[1:23:27] where i got my title from so just stay
[1:23:29] with me don't worry about it don't just

[1:23:36] glory to god here we go turn on the
[1:23:38] light give me this this message out of
[1:23:39] turn on the light stay with me
[1:23:42] you know i don't even i forgot to put my
[1:23:44] timer on
[1:23:45] what time i got here about 11 30 right
[1:23:50] i'm sorry i try not to preach too long

[1:24:07] all right take your time thank you
[1:24:08] brother
[1:24:09] i appreciate that what nobody else gonna
[1:24:12] say brother joseph
[1:24:14] nobody else got they they about shut me
[1:24:17] down already brother joseph i just got
[1:24:19] started but thank you brother glory to
[1:24:21] god
[1:24:22] amen all right stay with me stay with me
[1:24:24] here oh glory now uh this message turned
[1:24:27] on like look at this look at this
[1:24:30] nothing can live natural or spiritual
[1:24:33] without his light
[1:24:35] and his word
[1:24:38] is light and life
[1:24:40] right but when he sends his light
[1:24:43] and makes it known to the people
[1:24:45] and then it is rejected
[1:24:49] then what about that
[1:24:51] right that's what we want to talk about
[1:24:53] this morning is rejecting this light by
[1:24:58] them it's sent to reject it
[1:25:01] just like it was then behold my servant
[1:25:03] whom i have delighted in he is the light
[1:25:06] he's the light to the gentiles he's the
[1:25:08] light to the world he was the light of
[1:25:10] the world but he was rejected that's the
[1:25:12] sad part what we got to get here is not
[1:25:15] just bible history because history has a
[1:25:17] strange way
[1:25:19] of repeating itself
[1:25:21] right amen says and it meets that
[1:25:23] condition every time that god manifests
[1:25:26] his life the word itself rejects that
[1:25:28] light why it's written right in the
[1:25:30] bible each age god has allotted so much
[1:25:32] of his word for each age and he always
[1:25:34] sends somebody to manifest that word
[1:25:38] let's go on a little further jesus had
[1:25:41] been prophesied for 4 000 years that he
[1:25:43] would come messiah and when he come he
[1:25:46] manifested every promise of messiah but
[1:25:48] yet the people of the world the churches
[1:25:51] and so forth know nothing about them so
[1:25:53] cause they they had then got in some
[1:25:55] other thing that kept them away from
[1:25:57] knowing this now he says we'll take the
[1:26:00] natural part what if a man that is born
[1:26:02] here to walk in the light of that son
[1:26:04] amen what god has created for him and
[1:26:07] the first thing you know he shuts his
[1:26:09] eyes now this is what the man is doing
[1:26:12] ain't nobody set his eyes for him he did
[1:26:15] it to himself
[1:26:16] glory to god he shuts his eyes
[1:26:20] not an old man runs into the basement
[1:26:23] now now the man is doing this something
[1:26:25] is going wrong with this man that is
[1:26:27] trying to deny the very existence of the
[1:26:29] s-u-n
[1:26:31] and in order to deny he can't come
[1:26:33] outside
[1:26:36] you can't come outside and come in
[1:26:38] contact with the sun and start denying
[1:26:41] it's too much evidence
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:45] it's too much evidence to prove to you
[1:26:48] that there's an s-u-n
[1:26:51] all you got to do is watch the way the
[1:26:52] plants operate
[1:26:54] you can tell that there's an s you win
[1:26:57] your skin will start telling you there's
[1:26:59] an s you win
[1:27:03] oh hallelujah to the lamb
[1:27:06] look at this now see what happens now
[1:27:08] that the man has to shut his eyes look
[1:27:11] the prophet says this
[1:27:14] uh uh
[1:27:16] he shuts his eyes runs into the basement
[1:27:20] closes the door
[1:27:23] and ain't enough because the sun even
[1:27:24] get through all that
[1:27:28] you're in the basement but there's a
[1:27:30] window in the basement the sun will find
[1:27:32] its way in the basement
[1:27:34] so he got to keep doing all kinds of
[1:27:36] crazy things to try to tell people it's
[1:27:39] no s-u-n
[1:27:41] my god look at him says he uh he uh uh
[1:27:44] runs into the basement close the door
[1:27:46] pulls down the shade
[1:27:49] and even in that you can still feel a
[1:27:51] different presence when the s-u-n come
[1:27:53] in the temperature in your basement
[1:27:55] changes
[1:27:56] when the s-u-n rises
[1:27:59] hey i want to tell you the temperature
[1:28:01] in your life
[1:28:03] should change
[1:28:05] when the eson rises
[1:28:12] and just refuses
[1:28:15] to recognize the sun is a shining
[1:28:18] he denies its privileges
[1:28:21] now there i think there are certain uh
[1:28:24] uh
[1:28:25] benefits that you get from sunlight
[1:28:28] he's denying his privileges
[1:28:30] glory to god and ain't no light ain't no
[1:28:32] light i don't care like at night when
[1:28:34] they start working on the roads and they
[1:28:35] put the lights up that's not good enough
[1:28:36] that ain't good enough i mean you need
[1:28:38] s-u-n light
[1:28:40] look at this he says um
[1:28:42] uh uh oh my that he denies his privilege
[1:28:45] he denies it's warm and raised it's
[1:28:48] life-giving resource he denies the light
[1:28:50] that it spread
[1:28:52] glory spread so he can see where he's
[1:28:55] going where he come from amen
[1:28:59] he denies that
[1:29:01] uh what would you say to a man that
[1:29:03] pulled down the shades or run into the
[1:29:06] basement and closed all all the light
[1:29:09] off everywhere and just simply refused
[1:29:11] to recognize the sun was shining there
[1:29:15] is something
[1:29:17] mentally
[1:29:18] wrong with that person
[1:29:21] anyone knows that a natural mind will
[1:29:23] tell you there is something wrong with
[1:29:25] that person uh something that's happened
[1:29:27] to him he has lost his reasons
[1:29:32] now watch this well so it is
[1:29:35] in the hours that we live when a man
[1:29:38] will cover himself up with some kind of
[1:29:41] excuse to actually recognize the gospel
[1:29:45] light as is shining forth as it is today
[1:29:49] when a man
[1:29:50] deliberately turns away from him goes
[1:29:53] into something and pulls down the
[1:29:55] curtain say i don't believe it there's
[1:29:57] something wrong with that person
[1:30:00] they're aired
[1:30:02] in spirit
[1:30:04] look at this look at this he said
[1:30:06] there's just no way of getting around it
[1:30:08] there is something wrong something has
[1:30:10] happened to him and we find out there is
[1:30:13] so much of that
[1:30:14] today
[1:30:15] now i want to just i want to i'm going
[1:30:17] to just uh maybe stop right there i
[1:30:19] won't go any further on that quote i'm
[1:30:21] trying to get you to see this this
[1:30:23] natural and spiritual type that brother
[1:30:24] branham just gave us
[1:30:26] if the man is trying to deny the su in
[1:30:28] the existence of the suv there's so many
[1:30:30] things he has to do in order to deny it
[1:30:32] so many things he has a he has to
[1:30:34] isolate himself
[1:30:36] he has to go into a basement where no
[1:30:39] pretty much no son can get but if he if
[1:30:41] there's a window there he's in trouble
[1:30:43] so he has to pull the shade down in the
[1:30:45] window and even if you pull the shade
[1:30:47] down you realize sunlight would kind of
[1:30:49] go out the corners
[1:30:52] right i mean there's so much this man
[1:30:54] got to do in order to deny the sun and
[1:30:56] all all if he tells about it ain't no
[1:30:58] sudden they just said would you just
[1:31:00] come outside
[1:31:01] would you just come up from the basement
[1:31:03] you will realize there is a son
[1:31:05] hallelujah now that's natural the man
[1:31:08] lost his mind if he's in that condition
[1:31:10] it's the same thing spiritually when we
[1:31:12] are denying the vindicated word of god
[1:31:16] we've erred in spirit
[1:31:20] jesus spoke these words in
[1:31:22] luke 4.
[1:31:24] this is why i
[1:31:26] read this amen for us on today
[1:31:29] because jesus knew that people would be
[1:31:31] in this condition
[1:31:33] and and and and and i want to tell you
[1:31:35] something that the only person that can
[1:31:37] bring you out of a condition like that
[1:31:40] is jesus
[1:31:42] amen only jesus can actually bring
[1:31:44] deliverance to you
[1:31:46] only jesus can reveal his word to you
[1:31:49] only jesus can do it
[1:31:51] amen now now there were some things that
[1:31:54] jesus said he says he was anointed to
[1:31:56] preach the gospel to the poor
[1:31:59] and and i love this because as
[1:32:01] christians amen not not when i look at
[1:32:04] that scripture it's not that does not
[1:32:05] talk about people that don't have money
[1:32:07] but let's talk about people that get
[1:32:09] poor in their spirit through conditions
[1:32:11] and situations that happen in their life
[1:32:13] one of the people that got poor in
[1:32:15] spirit was a prophet by the name of john
[1:32:17] the baptist
[1:32:18] john the baptist when he when he started
[1:32:20] going through his trials and his
[1:32:21] tribulations and his distresses he as
[1:32:24] he's in prison because he's preaching
[1:32:26] the gospel he sent his disciples to
[1:32:28] jesus say
[1:32:29] are you he or should we look for another
[1:32:31] he was poor in his spirit
[1:32:35] see life has a way of throwing you
[1:32:38] curveballs life has a way of throwing
[1:32:40] you challenges till you get poor in your
[1:32:42] spirits
[1:32:44] and if you're not careful you make the
[1:32:46] wrong decisions when you are poor in
[1:32:48] your spirits
[1:32:54] that's why i think that that song that
[1:32:55] brother solomon was saying too that just
[1:32:58] goes right along with it he never
[1:33:00] promised
[1:33:01] the road um gonna be easy you know you
[1:33:04] ain't gonna have no trials but he gonna
[1:33:06] be there with you guys he goes he's
[1:33:08] going to step in just in time
[1:33:10] all you got to do is just keep
[1:33:11] persevering keep pressing on keep being
[1:33:13] patient just keep waiting on the lord
[1:33:16] oh hallelujah oh glory to god church
[1:33:19] amen he's a jesus said he was anointed
[1:33:22] to preach the gospel the vindicated word
[1:33:25] to those that are poor in spirit
[1:33:28] another thing is that he was sent to
[1:33:30] heal
[1:33:32] broken-hearted that's how people get to
[1:33:35] air in their spirits
[1:33:37] a broken heart can cause you to air in
[1:33:40] your spirit
[1:33:41] oh help us lord a broken heart maybe
[1:33:44] something you thought should have
[1:33:45] happened but didn't happen it can cause
[1:33:47] you to air in your spirit but jesus has
[1:33:51] a word to give to somebody that is
[1:33:53] broken-hearted
[1:33:57] it says he was sent to preach
[1:33:58] deliverance
[1:34:00] to the captives
[1:34:01] amen and and again uh and we'll we'll
[1:34:04] get into all that but but you know a a a
[1:34:07] person that's captive you can be captive
[1:34:09] in your spirit brother branham talked
[1:34:10] about how he went to the cincinnati zoo
[1:34:13] and when he got there and he saw this
[1:34:15] eagle that was trying to fly to get
[1:34:17] above the cage and every time he work
[1:34:19] himself up and get up so high and just
[1:34:21] have to come right back down he'd say if
[1:34:23] he just wished that he had the
[1:34:25] opportunity to go and just take the cage
[1:34:26] off and let that eagle go free and as he
[1:34:29] thought about it saying you know there's
[1:34:30] a worse condition than the eagle in the
[1:34:32] cage
[1:34:33] it says when a son of god
[1:34:35] or a daughter of god is also bound and
[1:34:38] can't be free
[1:34:40] they're in a worse condition than that
[1:34:41] eagle is
[1:34:42] and god god god made the eagle to soar
[1:34:46] into the heavenlies god made you
[1:34:49] to soar in the heavenlies
[1:34:51] but you air in your spirit
[1:34:55] jesus said he came to recover sight to
[1:34:58] the blood and i love this because if if
[1:34:59] he came to recover the sight of the
[1:35:01] blind that means somebody used to be
[1:35:03] able to see
[1:35:06] but they lost their eyesight so in order
[1:35:09] to recover the sight see you had to own
[1:35:11] it first if you lost it you can recover
[1:35:14] it amen if you had sight at some point
[1:35:17] in time that's the only way jesus can
[1:35:19] recover sight if you never had sight
[1:35:23] you can't have nothing recovered
[1:35:28] but if you had it
[1:35:30] if you used to be able to see this
[1:35:31] gospel
[1:35:32] if you used to be able to see this truth
[1:35:35] there's a way out
[1:35:37] what you need to do is meet jesus
[1:35:39] because his ministry is to recover the
[1:35:42] sight of the blind
[1:35:45] the other thing that the bible tells us
[1:35:46] that jesus came to do a set at liberty
[1:35:48] those that are bruised
[1:35:50] you know brother branham say cancer can
[1:35:52] actually happen
[1:35:56] from a bruise
[1:35:58] a bruise is something that occurs on the
[1:36:00] inside
[1:36:01] and then it manifests itself
[1:36:03] on the outside but what jesus want to do
[1:36:06] is bring you healing
[1:36:08] to your inside
[1:36:11] the other thing to say to preach the
[1:36:13] acceptable year of the lord
[1:36:15] and this was the jubilee year and what
[1:36:17] we found out about the jubilee year any
[1:36:19] time the gospel is preached
[1:36:22] you can have a jubilee
[1:36:24] so this morning while you under amen
[1:36:27] this great anointing
[1:36:29] you can have a jubilee
[1:36:33] even at home underneath this great
[1:36:35] anointing you can have a jubilee
[1:36:39] you can experience freedom like you
[1:36:41] never experienced before
[1:36:45] look at this this sermon amen why are
[1:36:48] people so tossed about
[1:36:51] look at this look at this statement
[1:36:52] that's being made here that's why i say
[1:36:54] you know this this is one of the most
[1:36:55] anointed messages

[1:37:01] some people

[1:37:52] some people
[1:37:54] gets the wrong impression
[1:37:57] of what the anointing is

[1:38:33] to god i feel anointed in it
[1:38:38] he said when was the greatest anointing
[1:38:40] ever give to anyone and what did they do
[1:38:43] when they had the anointing
[1:38:48] the greatest anointing that was ever
[1:38:50] given to anyone was jesus christ we we
[1:38:54] have it by the by we have the spirit by
[1:38:56] measure he had it without measure and
[1:38:58] one day he entered into the temple like
[1:39:00] we did this morning amen one day he
[1:39:03] entered into the temple glory to god and
[1:39:06] picked up the school and read and said
[1:39:09] the spirit of god is upon me for he has
[1:39:12] anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:39:13] year to bind up the broken hearts to
[1:39:16] heal the sick gift site to the blind let
[1:39:18] me just add a little something here amen
[1:39:20] before i read a little further in this
[1:39:21] quote this morning we came to prayer and
[1:39:24] and i noticed brother uh jared picked up
[1:39:26] a scripture amen out of the book of
[1:39:29] isaiah to read to the people when you
[1:39:32] stood up here for song services brother
[1:39:34] solomon picked up a scripture out of
[1:39:36] isaiah i believe to read was that isaiah
[1:39:40] oh i'm sorry it was brother jerry i'm
[1:39:42] sorry i gave you the wrong credit amen
[1:39:44] but brother jared picked up isaiah
[1:39:47] jesus christ when it was given to him
[1:39:49] the book to read he picked up isaiah and
[1:39:52] this morning i'm going to tell you
[1:39:54] already ahead of time my title is found
[1:39:57] in isaiah
[1:40:03] glory to god look at this now watch this
[1:40:05] he says uh and now we would think if
[1:40:07] such an anointing was on him that had
[1:40:10] been prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:40:13] would come and there and here he was
[1:40:15] with the type of anointing the full
[1:40:17] blessing and anointed the lord upon him
[1:40:19] we would want to run all over the
[1:40:21] building
[1:40:22] scream and holler but the bible said
[1:40:27] amen he laid down the scroll and sat
[1:40:30] down
[1:40:32] you know you under the greatest
[1:40:33] anointing right now why are you sitting
[1:40:36] down
[1:40:38] and while the word is being poured into
[1:40:40] you you are under a great anointing
[1:40:44] change is happening on the inside
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] and the change that is happening on the
[1:40:50] inside will be manifested on the outside
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:56] oh my
[1:40:58] who ever heard the sunrise
[1:41:03] one of the most powerful things that
[1:41:05] happens on the earth every day
[1:41:07] is when it rises and you never hear it
[1:41:12] but boy i tell you when you sit there
[1:41:14] other other morning i was driving down
[1:41:16] the street and it was you know i was i
[1:41:19] like to play golf
[1:41:21] and i'm getting ready to go play golf
[1:41:22] and man it's dark out there
[1:41:24] and we i see what time my tee time is
[1:41:27] and say man
[1:41:28] we ain't gonna be able to see the ball
[1:41:29] at this this time of morning gonna have
[1:41:30] to set the tea time a little later
[1:41:32] but as i'm sitting there
[1:41:35] they set that tee time because they're
[1:41:37] they're basing their own on projections
[1:41:40] as to when the sun gonna rise now it may
[1:41:42] look dark right now
[1:41:44] but as i just kept riding to the course
[1:41:45] and i got my bag out my car and my i
[1:41:48] start walking up there to go pay my
[1:41:50] green fees when i come back out
[1:41:53] it changed
[1:41:55] just
[1:41:56] like
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:02] and and i'm here to tell you this
[1:42:05] morning mama and daddy
[1:42:07] husband wife
[1:42:09] children whoever you are things are
[1:42:11] changing
[1:42:13] just like that
[1:42:17] hallelujah
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:23] the prophet says that she says uh
[1:42:27] uh the full blessing anointed the lord
[1:42:29] upon him we would want to run all over
[1:42:30] the building and scream and holler but
[1:42:32] the bible said he laid down the scroll
[1:42:34] and sat down and precious words
[1:42:37] proceeded from his mouth
[1:42:39] that's what he'd done under the
[1:42:41] anointing
[1:42:42] look at this the anointing is not
[1:42:44] emotions
[1:42:46] the anointing
[1:42:48] is
[1:42:49] supreme power
[1:42:51] in control
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:56] the anointing in
[1:42:59] supreme power and control like knowing
[1:43:01] exactly what and how
[1:43:07] see that's
[1:43:09] that's what's here
[1:43:11] as we're taking the scripture we
[1:43:12] understand where where we are we know we
[1:43:15] can identify things by by by by the word
[1:43:18] of god we can get encouragement and
[1:43:19] strength from what the word tells us
[1:43:22] and and i'm going to read some
[1:43:24] scriptures here for you in a second amen
[1:43:26] just just bear with me i got okay i got
[1:43:28] 25 minutes bear with me ain't no way i'm
[1:43:31] finished finishing this today but but
[1:43:34] the probably say the anointing is
[1:43:36] supreme power control like knowing
[1:43:37] exactly what and how now now another
[1:43:40] statement that he makes if your religion
[1:43:43] doesn't have emotion
[1:43:46] bury it
[1:43:49] see so so that don't mean take the take
[1:43:51] take the emotion out of the church
[1:43:54] that's not what we're talking about but
[1:43:55] we need to understand that amen if your
[1:43:58] emotions
[1:43:59] are not producing a change
[1:44:03] in your life
[1:44:04] then the sermon never hit the target
[1:44:08] if we can preach between here
[1:44:10] and there and everybody get all excited
[1:44:12] but it don't produce a change in your
[1:44:14] life we miss the target
[1:44:19] we're not here to preach their emotions
[1:44:21] but we're here to preach to your soul
[1:44:27] i want to tell you what the anointing
[1:44:28] come to do
[1:44:30] the anointing comes
[1:44:32] to destroy the yoke
[1:44:35] let's go to isaiah 10. let's go to
[1:44:36] isaiah 10. let's look at this
[1:44:38] lord help me here lord help me here i
[1:44:40] got so much i want to say and i don't
[1:44:42] even know if i can get to it all but
[1:44:44] god knows
[1:44:47] god knows isaiah 10 verse 24 look at
[1:44:50] this look at this
[1:44:53] therefore thus saith the lord god of
[1:44:55] hosts
[1:44:56] oh my people that dwelleth in zion be
[1:44:59] not afraid of the assyrian
[1:45:02] he shall smite thee with a rod he shall
[1:45:05] lift up his staff against thee after the
[1:45:07] manna of egypt
[1:45:09] for yet a very little while and the
[1:45:12] indignation shall cease
[1:45:14] now you're going to go through some
[1:45:16] trials you're going to go through some
[1:45:17] stuff but it's going to stop let me tell
[1:45:18] you every trial got a stopping point
[1:45:24] it got a starting point and it got a
[1:45:25] stopping point what you got to learn how
[1:45:28] to do is just endure
[1:45:33] glory
[1:45:34] for a very for yet a very little while
[1:45:36] the indignation shall cease and mind
[1:45:38] anger in their destruction and the lord
[1:45:40] of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
[1:45:44] according to the slaughter of midian at
[1:45:46] the rock of orb and as his rod was upon
[1:45:49] the sea
[1:45:50] so shall he lift it up after the man of
[1:45:52] egypt and it shall come to pass in that
[1:45:55] day that his burden shall be taken away
[1:45:58] from off thy shoulder and his yoke from
[1:46:00] off thy neck and the yoke
[1:46:03] shall be destroyed
[1:46:05] because of the anointing
[1:46:09] i'm looking for yolks to be destroyed
[1:46:11] even right now
[1:46:12] while we're preaching this sermon i'm
[1:46:14] looking for yokes to be destroyed you
[1:46:16] know
[1:46:17] for me it's not a joy to see people come
[1:46:20] into the house of god and go right back
[1:46:22] out living the same way they were living
[1:46:23] before they came something's got to
[1:46:25] change somewhere just like the sun rose
[1:46:28] with no sound i'm looking for god to do
[1:46:30] a change in somebody no sound
[1:46:34] no emotion
[1:46:36] just something take place on the inside
[1:46:38] and it manifests on the outside and when
[1:46:40] you realize what has happened it will
[1:46:42] produce
[1:46:44] an emotion
[1:46:46] i want you to just look at this
[1:46:48] according isaiah 10 24 the children of
[1:46:50] israel
[1:46:51] were going to bondage like they were in
[1:46:53] egypt this is what isaiah is saying
[1:46:56] god told him not to fear as there would
[1:46:58] be a mighty deliverance
[1:47:00] amen and and in the promise why he's
[1:47:03] given him this promise and told him that
[1:47:04] the yoke are going to be strong because
[1:47:06] of anointing during this promise he told
[1:47:08] him to look back at two events
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:13] two events uh in verse 26 it said the
[1:47:16] lord of hosts should stir up a score a
[1:47:17] scourge for him according to the
[1:47:19] slaughter of midian at the rock of orab
[1:47:22] and as his rod was upon the sea so shall
[1:47:24] he lift it up after the man of egypt so
[1:47:26] so so so what we had to do i mean just
[1:47:28] to kind of understand this prophecy you
[1:47:30] got to look back
[1:47:32] hey man at these two events that god
[1:47:34] could take the children of israel back
[1:47:36] to and i think we can also uh go on the
[1:47:38] same journey when they went back to amen
[1:47:41] what happened in midian at the rock of
[1:47:43] orb this is when gideon's army had been
[1:47:46] raised up
[1:47:47] good god almighty and when we go back
[1:47:49] and just think about what god did amen
[1:47:52] uh there would get his arm gideon was a
[1:47:55] man when you read them in scripture look
[1:47:56] like he was fearful
[1:47:58] and man they were hiding their food and
[1:48:00] they were doing all kind of stuff to try
[1:48:01] to protect themselves from the
[1:48:03] midianites my god and and then god got
[1:48:06] god of visits give him say you mighty
[1:48:08] man of valor
[1:48:10] oh i love the way this comes across
[1:48:12] because you know when gideon was
[1:48:14] standing there and from our eyes he
[1:48:16] didn't look like a mighty man of valor
[1:48:17] but you got to stop worrying about how
[1:48:20] people see you and you have to look at
[1:48:22] yourself how god sees you god called
[1:48:25] gideon we call him a coward but god
[1:48:28] called gideon a mighty man of valor
[1:48:34] you say say well you know if you if
[1:48:36] you're supposed to be so supernatural
[1:48:37] where the miracles we don't we read
[1:48:38] about it but we need to see it now say
[1:48:41] oh i'm glad you asked for the miracles
[1:48:42] because i'm gonna use you to be a part
[1:48:43] of the miracle gideon
[1:48:45] you got to be careful what you ask god
[1:48:47] for you might become part of it
[1:48:51] get him get himself uh okay say take
[1:48:54] your men down here to the water
[1:48:56] getting started got 32 000 soldiers i
[1:49:00] think i can go conquer anything with
[1:49:01] this
[1:49:03] yeah let's go fight he said no no get in
[1:49:04] no no no no no no i need to just make an
[1:49:07] announcement
[1:49:08] ask him if anybody's scared just go
[1:49:10] ahead and go back home
[1:49:15] next thing you know they made the
[1:49:16] announcement and one after one to take
[1:49:18] it off go on
[1:49:20] what is this

[1:49:35] one sermon

[1:49:44] get in we ain't finished we we
[1:49:46] got a little bit more to do
[1:49:49] take them down to the water

[1:50:00] them to the other side now now what what
[1:50:02] some of them did they got prostrate on
[1:50:04] the ground just laying out on the ground
[1:50:05] and drinking water getting it now god
[1:50:07] said if you see them do that put them
[1:50:08] over there and i said if you see

[1:51:05] asking for fleeces and all kinds of
[1:51:07] stuff god gave him every fleece that he
[1:51:08] wanted
[1:51:12] and then the last thing god told him
[1:51:14] said now you still a little discouraged

[1:51:16] just want you to get up one of your
[1:51:17] friends go down into the heart into the
[1:51:19] camp of midian and you're going to hear
[1:51:20] something that's going to encourage you
[1:51:23] he went down there to midian and when he
[1:51:24] got there uh that a guy had just had a
[1:51:27] dream
[1:51:29] and when he had a dream he started
[1:51:30] telling his friend you know his dream

[1:52:00] little bit
[1:52:03] develop your strategy don't wait for god
[1:52:06] to overflow use the little bit that you
[1:52:09] got and develop a strategy
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:14] use what you got
[1:52:16] what's that you have in your hand use
[1:52:19] that
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:29] put a hundred over here and take some
[1:52:31] pots and pictures
[1:52:32] no man we need swords no pots and
[1:52:35] pictures
[1:52:36] we're just gonna make noise on this side
[1:52:38] of those on that side and lamps and we
[1:52:40] just gonna look like we crazy
[1:52:44] they ain't gonna know how many of us out
[1:52:45] here
[1:52:46] and we're gonna defeat this this this
[1:52:48] this this enemy
[1:52:50] because god told us to come down here
[1:52:52] look it wasn't gideon fighting about any
[1:52:53] it was god in gideon
[1:52:55] fighting the battle
[1:52:59] the prophet told him go back go back go
[1:53:02] back and look at what i did
[1:53:04] with midian
[1:53:05] amen at orb go back and look at that
[1:53:08] right and then he told him say uh
[1:53:11] uh uh also
[1:53:12] says and and his rod was upon the sea
[1:53:14] socially lifted up after the man of
[1:53:16] egypt so they had to go back and look at
[1:53:18] what happened in israel when they were
[1:53:20] coming out of egypt
[1:53:22] here you know we we noticed that uh
[1:53:24] it took god the supernatural god to get
[1:53:27] them out of that place he had given them
[1:53:28] a promise that they was going to be in
[1:53:30] bondage for 400 years i told you the
[1:53:32] devil has a stopping point
[1:53:35] can i put it this way your bondage
[1:53:38] has a stopping point
[1:53:43] the air in your spirit
[1:53:46] has a stopping point
[1:53:50] you can only go so far like that
[1:53:53] somewhere down the road down the line
[1:53:55] god gonna turn you around
[1:53:58] i got a confidence in my god
[1:54:00] i got an assurance in my god
[1:54:03] i got a promise from my god
[1:54:10] you say that say
[1:54:11] say moses go get my people out of there
[1:54:13] and
[1:54:14] and moses went marching down there with
[1:54:16] a stick in his hand
[1:54:17] one stick to take over the greatest army
[1:54:20] in the world with a stick in his hand
[1:54:21] but he had a supernatural god that was
[1:54:23] dwelling with him
[1:54:24] and as he threw god said throw the stick
[1:54:26] down and watch it turn to a snake and
[1:54:28] moses oh yeah something's supernatural
[1:54:29] these guys gonna be afraid of this and
[1:54:31] then when he stood there pharaoh say oh
[1:54:33] man
[1:54:34] that's all you got moses man we've been
[1:54:37] doing that for years
[1:54:38] janice and jamers come show moses what
[1:54:41] you got they took they sticks and threw
[1:54:43] them down
[1:54:44] moses saw that but here's the thing
[1:54:46] moses did not get
[1:54:48] frustrated moses did not get taken aback
[1:54:52] if god told me to throw it down he had a
[1:54:54] purpose for me throwing it down now i'ma
[1:54:56] sit here and just wait on god and before
[1:54:58] you knew it moses snake just went to one
[1:55:00] snake open up his mouth and gobbled
[1:55:03] nah it
[1:55:03] snake i i ain't never heard no snake
[1:55:05] eating snake i don't know about that but
[1:55:07] but here here you know most men go and
[1:55:09] gobble don't you think maybe the other
[1:55:11] snake would have thought man i better
[1:55:12] get out of here
[1:55:14] no he sat there and the snake molded
[1:55:16] snake went over and gobbled him saying
[1:55:17] now where your sticks at
[1:55:19] janice and jamboree your sticks are
[1:55:21] inside of my stick
[1:55:25] and you put some more down here we'll
[1:55:26] eat them up too
[1:55:31] god was showing himself on moses behalf
[1:55:36] finally they got to the point and you
[1:55:37] know all the plagues and everything
[1:55:39] falling in egypt death come to the
[1:55:41] firstborn
[1:55:43] first born son they they go through this
[1:55:45] plague and darkness and water turning
[1:55:47] the blood i mean lights and i mean you
[1:55:49] name it flies all kind of plagues that
[1:55:51] they were having following the
[1:55:52] the people in in egypt we just tie this
[1:55:55] please let them people go
[1:55:56] and when they when they left church i
[1:55:58] need you to understand you go back and
[1:56:00] read your bible you'll find that they
[1:56:01] did not leave broke
[1:56:04] now they might have been broke
[1:56:06] while they were dead but the night
[1:56:07] before they left they went and borrowed
[1:56:08] some jews
[1:56:10] they went and borrowed this and i been
[1:56:11] born expensive stuff and then the people
[1:56:13] got to say just leave take our stuff
[1:56:15] with you as well
[1:56:17] they left rich
[1:56:21] that just that's just my revelation i
[1:56:23] don't believe i'ma leave here poor
[1:56:25] now i know
[1:56:28] i'm not preaching you know prosperity
[1:56:30] but i don't believe i'ma leave here poor
[1:56:32] that's just me if they leave poor i
[1:56:34] ain't leaving poor
[1:56:36] and i'm getting ready to go to the
[1:56:37] streets of gold
[1:56:40] i'm trying to come home i'm trying to
[1:56:42] come home but but but uh
[1:56:44] here they they left and as they get
[1:56:47] there to the the the sea
[1:56:49] god had told moses said now don't take
[1:56:51] them a certain land a certain way
[1:56:52] because i don't want them to get into
[1:56:54] battle too early and get discouraged but
[1:56:57] take them this way take them this route
[1:57:00] and as they went towards the sea here
[1:57:01] come pharaoh's army got behind them and
[1:57:04] chastened them and and god had to
[1:57:05] separate with a pill of fire amen that
[1:57:08] he stopped the armies of pharaoh and
[1:57:09] then he allowed the children of israel
[1:57:11] to say now now moses got to spend what
[1:57:14] am i going to do now lord he's saying
[1:57:15] now what you're going to do
[1:57:16] he say don't don't cry to me and speak
[1:57:18] and go forward
[1:57:20] no no no cry
[1:57:22] i know it looked bad
[1:57:24] i know it looked impossible
[1:57:26] but one thing you don't do when it
[1:57:28] looked bad and when it looked impossible
[1:57:29] one thing you don't do
[1:57:31] you don't cry
[1:57:35] see when i was i said that last sermon
[1:57:37] stop stop stop
[1:57:40] stop crying
[1:57:42] yeah you ain't got to cry you know
[1:57:44] god lives up god well i was going to say
[1:57:47] god don't cry but he did cry at the
[1:57:49] grave of lazarus
[1:57:50] but he also stopped crying
[1:57:53] and lazarus came forth
[1:57:57] he said no don't cry moses don't cry no
[1:58:00] no no no nothing
[1:58:02] speak and move forward
[1:58:05] but it's what in the way speak and move
[1:58:07] forward
[1:58:08] and what i noticed here amen in the
[1:58:10] scripture
[1:58:11] uh
[1:58:12] there's a couple of things maybe we'll
[1:58:14] read it
[1:58:16] exodus 14
[1:58:18] verse 13 through 15
[1:58:21] we'll read it and
[1:58:22] according to my time i got 11 minutes 11
[1:58:25] minutes i'm i'm winding up
[1:58:27] praise the lord
[1:58:29] i'm just getting started i ain't we
[1:58:31] ain't even got nowhere yet but just just
[1:58:33] bear with me here in in uh exodus
[1:58:36] uh 14 verse 13 says and moses said unto
[1:58:38] the people fear you not stand still
[1:58:40] that's what some of us need to learn how
[1:58:42] to do
[1:58:43] that was another word that came out like
[1:58:45] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:58:46] lord
[1:58:47] fear you not stand still see the
[1:58:49] salvation lord which he will show to you
[1:58:52] when
[1:58:53] today for the egyptians whom you have
[1:58:56] seen today you should see them no more
[1:58:58] again forever now no they see them again
[1:59:00] no more forever now god never told moses
[1:59:02] to say that moses said that under
[1:59:04] inspiration
[1:59:06] and since he was god's prophet god had
[1:59:08] to back up
[1:59:10] what he said can i say something else
[1:59:12] since you are god's child
[1:59:15] since you are god's brides
[1:59:19] god gonna back up what you say
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:27] moses said unto the people feeling not
[1:59:29] stand still and see the salvation lord
[1:59:30] which he will show you today for the
[1:59:32] egyptians whom you've seen today you
[1:59:33] should see them again no more forever
[1:59:35] next verse uh it says the lord
[1:59:39] shall fight for you
[1:59:41] and ye shall hold your peace
[1:59:43] and look at this verse 15 and the lord
[1:59:44] said to moses wherefore christ now unto
[1:59:46] me
[1:59:47] speaking to the children of israel
[1:59:50] that they go forward now skip down to
[1:59:51] verse
[1:59:53] 16.
[1:59:54] this is what i uh i guess it's the next
[1:59:56] verse and this is where i like but lift
[1:59:58] thou up thy rod
[2:00:01] and stretch out thy hand over the sea
[2:00:03] and divide it and the children of israel
[2:00:06] shall go on dry ground through the midst
[2:00:07] of the sea so so in order for the sea to
[2:00:10] open up moses had to lift his hand up
[2:00:12] and stretch out the rod
[2:00:14] hallelujah it was moses by moses act of
[2:00:18] obedience amen the sea opened up
[2:00:22] and the children of israel crossed on
[2:00:24] dry ground but now let's go to verse 26
[2:00:27] through 28
[2:00:29] moses open it up by stretching out the
[2:00:31] rod
[2:00:32] amen but the same moses the lord said to
[2:00:35] moses stretch out thy hand over the sea
[2:00:38] that the waters may come again
[2:00:40] unto upon the egyptians upon their
[2:00:42] chariots and upon their horsemen so he
[2:00:45] stretched it out to open it up but he
[2:00:47] also stressed it out to close it up
[2:00:51] and moses stretched forth his hand over
[2:00:53] the sea and the sea returned to strength
[2:00:55] when the morning when the morning
[2:00:56] appeared and the egyptians fled against
[2:00:58] it and the lord overthrew the egyptians
[2:01:00] in the midst of the sea the next verse i
[2:01:02] believe
[2:01:03] is that right
[2:01:04] yes uh and the waters returned and
[2:01:07] covered the chairs and the horsemen and
[2:01:08] all the hosts of pharaoh that came into
[2:01:10] the sea after them they remain not so
[2:01:12] much as one of them i want to let you
[2:01:14] know that you have the power to bind and
[2:01:17] loose
[2:01:19] because the bible say whatever you buy
[2:01:20] on earth shall be bound in heaven and
[2:01:23] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[2:01:24] loosed in heaven moses demonstrated this
[2:01:26] power it was him stretching his rod
[2:01:29] he loosed the red sea
[2:01:31] and they walked through on dry ground
[2:01:33] but after the children of israel got
[2:01:35] through on dry ground he stretched to
[2:01:37] rod again and he bound
[2:01:39] the red sea
[2:01:42] and it drowned pharaoh in his army you
[2:01:44] got the power
[2:01:46] to bind and to loose
[2:01:48] but keep your spirit right
[2:01:55] i have a
[2:01:58] little something here that i just want
[2:02:00] to
[2:02:01] make mention of
[2:02:03] give me this last quote then i got some
[2:02:05] scriptures that i'm going to read and
[2:02:06] i'll close
[2:02:07] amen
[2:02:09] this portion of it
[2:02:13] here i want to read from a paradox
[2:02:15] i just been trying to go back and forth
[2:02:17] and show you
[2:02:19] uh it's one thing where we can look back
[2:02:21] at these things and moses
[2:02:23] gideon
[2:02:24] we can see scriptures fulfilled in their
[2:02:26] day but we got to be able to see where
[2:02:27] we at now
[2:02:30] and when we come and we talk about this
[2:02:31] message that god sent us through uh his
[2:02:33] prophet william branham
[2:02:35] that's god fulfilling his word for this
[2:02:36] day
[2:02:38] that that was god's way of fulfilling
[2:02:40] his word and like i said earlier uh we
[2:02:42] we need light we need light on the
[2:02:44] manifested word i mean the word of god
[2:02:46] has to be manifested by the day for us
[2:02:47] to understand what god is doing
[2:02:50] and when we have that light
[2:02:51] we don't want to be like the man going
[2:02:53] into
[2:02:55] the basement
[2:02:57] shutting ourselves off from everybody
[2:03:00] see ain't nobody gonna join you down in
[2:03:02] that basement when you air in your
[2:03:03] spirit
[2:03:04] hallelujah
[2:03:06] right you know oftentimes we want people
[2:03:08] to join our pity party
[2:03:11] i don't like pity parties
[2:03:13] i don't enjoy them
[2:03:15] right i don't i don't like them so so i
[2:03:17] mean it's hard to just kind of get down
[2:03:19] there all you want when you see somebody
[2:03:21] pity party you just want to kind of give
[2:03:22] them something to kind of get them out
[2:03:23] of it just snap out of it snap out of it
[2:03:25] right
[2:03:26] but god doesn't done too much for us to
[2:03:28] have a pity party
[2:03:30] remember everything ain't going to go
[2:03:32] your way all the time that's right
[2:03:34] that's fine all things work together for
[2:03:36] you good
[2:03:37] it may not be good but it's still
[2:03:39] working together for you good
[2:03:42] but you know we look at these things but
[2:03:43] we got to be able to see what god has
[2:03:44] done in our day
[2:03:46] and and and we don't want to reject the
[2:03:48] light that has been given to us for this
[2:03:50] day we don't want to do that got to be
[2:03:52] careful and it's very easy to do that
[2:03:56] when you start airing in your spirit
[2:04:00] mistake in your spirit
[2:04:03] you can recover
[2:04:05] it ain't over
[2:04:07] you can recover from
[2:04:08] it oh god's arms are open why
[2:04:13] god realizes that people will air in
[2:04:15] their spirits
[2:04:17] it's gonna happen
[2:04:19] happen to the best of us
[2:04:21] john the baptist it happened to him
[2:04:25] and you want to know why it happened
[2:04:26] because of his trial
[2:04:29] he was in prison
[2:04:31] and like all i'm doing is preaching the
[2:04:33] gospel
[2:04:34] and because he was kind of in prison
[2:04:36] couldn't see his way out didn't know
[2:04:38] what was going to happen all over he
[2:04:40] preached one sermon one day to this this
[2:04:44] lady that came to church late
[2:04:47] walked into the church
[2:04:49] with her husband her new husband
[2:04:54] because they had a marriage and divorce
[2:04:56] problem
[2:04:57] amen
[2:04:58] and and john had to scream out from the
[2:05:00] pulpit it's not lawful for you to have
[2:05:02] her then kept on preaching the sermon
[2:05:05] and she could just say heroic say oh
[2:05:09] are you talking to me
[2:05:11] i'm gonna have to get him and she she
[2:05:14] she had she had vow in her spirit
[2:05:17] i'm gonna get this man
[2:05:19] and one day she raised up her daughter
[2:05:21] to dress a dress a certain way and to
[2:05:24] dance a certain way
[2:05:26] that's why we believe is we don't do
[2:05:27] this stuff
[2:05:29] no we don't we don't carry ourselves
[2:05:31] like that he say i'm i raise up and say
[2:05:33] i know your daddy i know your daddy he's
[2:05:35] a drunk he's a lush he's a got a love
[2:05:38] spirit on him watch this watch this
[2:05:40] watch this now i want you to dress like
[2:05:42] this put this on put that on and go out
[2:05:43] there and dance
[2:05:46] turn that music on boy she been getting
[2:05:48] a twirl and do all kind of stuff and boy
[2:05:49] that man was so drunk he lusted after
[2:05:51] his own step daughter
[2:05:54] can i tell you all the bible
[2:05:57] lusting after his own step daughter
[2:06:00] and here here you know uh
[2:06:03] get so bad and say whatever you want up
[2:06:06] to half the kingdom you can have it
[2:06:09] girl didn't know what to do with that
[2:06:10] kind of power
[2:06:11] went running to her mama
[2:06:13] mama he say up to half the kingdom what
[2:06:15] should i actually owe up to have the
[2:06:17] kingdom
[2:06:18] tell them you want the head
[2:06:20] of john the baptist
[2:06:22] on the platter
[2:06:24] she went running back out there and said
[2:06:26] uh said uh uh i want the head of john
[2:06:29] the baptist on the platter
[2:06:31] and now he was drunk but when he heard
[2:06:32] that he kind of
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:38] you want me to kill a prophet
[2:06:41] even a drunk king
[2:06:43] was afraid
[2:06:45] to kill a prophet
[2:06:47] now what about people today supposedly
[2:06:49] in their same mind
[2:06:51] they can come against the prophet with
[2:06:53] anything
[2:06:54] call a prophet a liar
[2:06:56] no he ain't a liar you a liar
[2:06:58] and you you just aired in your spirit
[2:07:10] two-minute warning
[2:07:13] can i just uh let me read this this is
[2:07:15] coming from the message of paradox i'm
[2:07:18] gonna leave you with a couple promises
[2:07:21] a paradox he says but we're promised
[2:07:23] according to revelation 10.
[2:07:27] and according to malachi 4
[2:07:30] saint luke 22 17 and so forth that there
[2:07:33] has got to come an ephesians to this
[2:07:35] that means a coming out in exodus
[2:07:38] just like moses was brought out uh god's
[2:07:40] people gonna be brought out
[2:07:43] amen and ephesians says there's promised
[2:07:45] it friends there must come in ephesians
[2:07:47] that these sevenfold mysteries of the
[2:07:49] word of god must be unfolded and it's in
[2:07:52] the landscaping age that this takes
[2:07:54] place i believe that we're there i
[2:07:57] believe we're right in the shadows of
[2:07:58] the coming of the son of god and as
[2:08:01] joshua just before the ephesians raised
[2:08:03] up so did john the baptist raise up just
[2:08:06] before the next ephesians and we're
[2:08:07] promised another ephesians it's
[2:08:10] predicted here in the scripture
[2:08:12] therefore i think that we're living in
[2:08:14] the ephesians age back again we're
[2:08:16] promised that what was left off during
[2:08:18] those seven
[2:08:19] seven ages now you cannot add nothing to
[2:08:23] the book or take nothing from it
[2:08:25] revelation 22 18 says so who will ever
[2:08:29] uh who will ever will add one word or
[2:08:31] take one word his part will be taken
[2:08:32] from the book of life now we cannot add
[2:08:34] a take so therefore we know that luther
[2:08:37] could not get to it wesley and so forth
[2:08:39] the reformers knocks feeling calvin and
[2:08:41] so forth
[2:08:42] on down so forth they didn't get it all
[2:08:45] but what they had was the gospel but now
[2:08:48] in the last days
[2:08:50] we are given the understanding i love
[2:08:53] this promise we're giving the
[2:08:55] understanding by the word
[2:08:58] oh you might have aired in your spirit
[2:08:59] but we're given the understanding by the
[2:09:02] word that we are going to understand
[2:09:06] we're going to understand it
[2:09:08] because it'll come in ephesians age to
[2:09:10] it
[2:09:11] and we're here now
[2:09:13] paradox i'll leave that hang
[2:09:16] because i've just got about 10 more
[2:09:18] minutes and then we'll have a prayer
[2:09:19] line
[2:09:20] now i just
[2:09:25] my timer just went off and i'm going to
[2:09:28] read these scriptures and i'ma close
[2:09:30] i love the way he just said we're giving
[2:09:34] we're giving the understanding by the
[2:09:36] word that we're going to understand
[2:09:39] that's a promise that's looming over
[2:09:40] each and every one of y'all you're given
[2:09:42] the understanding by the word you are
[2:09:46] going to understand
[2:09:50] and notice where he said that in the
[2:09:52] message
[2:09:53] paradox
[2:09:54] you know what a paradox is
[2:09:56] is some something unbelievable
[2:10:01] how did so and so change they used to be
[2:10:03] like this it seemed unbelievable
[2:10:07] but it's true
[2:10:11] i got i got i i want to i want to make
[2:10:13] this statement i'm going to read about
[2:10:14] three or four scriptures
