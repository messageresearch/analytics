the fellowship so I want to just thank you all for them and this was something that kind of came out of our well though it was the the business meeting and the church responded to that and you all I mean that's really real really really good but my hope and my desire is that we can do this maybe twice a year and you know everyone if we start to watch it to invite you bring your family to come and be a part sometimes it's good just to get an environment like that just a fellowship you know you just never know where things might go from there so but uh but we were happy that we were successful

different they met in Florida during during those periods yes there was a nice breeze and I'll just kind of come and wasn't too hot and everything in them and we just really enjoyed up so so so thank you all a man for all that you did they've had to make that a success praise the Lord those of you I did not get an opportunity to just mention happy Easter to you don't want to say Happy Easter a man

you for all the specials for the worship does everything that has happened God we appreciate the atmosphere that is in its place God as we turn our attention now to the word God set capital screen here and God if there's one that needs to Holy Ghost fell over the Holy Ghost God whatever the need is we read into a meter somebody's sick may bring healing in the place today we invite to take complete control over this portion of the service God be glorified be exalted be magnified right here and right now we love you Jesus we praise you Jesus Jesus bless our reading of the word and bless our hearing of the words in Jesus name we ask you no mind standing to your feet with me and then we will read a portion of the scripture I want to read from first John chapter 3 on today a man 1st John chapter 3 glory to God a man first John chapter 3 start here verse 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God but therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him in him so you got to be in him in him is no sin right right whosoever abideth in him sinneth not who service in it hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated certainly also appreciate can't said enough but the services on last week I felt were very very precious a man something special here for the church for services that we did and seemed like the devil didn't like it what he went on a rampage after the after the meekness was over but by the grace of God we're all still standing right here in the same place and all I can say is was a loser man you are a winner by still being here you win huh already God we thank God for for being on the winning side and thank God for victory in our in our lives I wanted to just take for a subject today a man born to destroy a man born to destroy let's just look at a couple of things here a man see here just kind of think about where we want to jump in a man you know we were where we're gonna look at this from a couple angles we just read here in the scripture where it says he that committeth sin is of the devil but the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so here we see Jesus was was brought a man on the scene in order to destroy the works of the devil and and if I could just give you a brief definition it's to ruin a man anything that that was trying to do in your life Jesus not just counter-attacks the enemy Jesus destroys God you know I'm one that I want to see the devil destroyed hey man I want to see him wiped out one day I'm gonna fight my final battle hey man ain't gonna be no mo battling with the devil right it is finally over and you know and you know and and and and and just kind of thinking about battles and things of that nature I was recently listening to a quote where the Prophet was talking about how you know we kind of go from trial to trial and things like that and you know he was uh he was talking about this uh you know because often times we go through trials and we ready to quit we ready to give up we you know we don't understand what our purpose is amen in the midst of that trial but you know he was saying you know there was a soldier one time a leader of the of the army and he and he he he had some soldiers and you know he was the soldiers were coming man these guys was getting wiped out you know they'd show up at one place they get wiped out and he was sending word back so Simmons among soldiers and so the next group would come and they would get wiped out and and but he still lived him and he's still given commands sent me some old soldiers and so you know finally the third group come and say hey look you keep asking for soldiers you lose and all these men you know something something wrong you know here he say he say look I might uh lost some battles but I ain't lost the war say the war still going on hey man so send me some months old just send me some soldiers and then the soldiers coming because they don't heard about all these men dying with him as a man leading a man they heard they heard a little noise in the camp they thought maybe a bullet went flying these guys went ducking and they went hide and running and all kind of stuff in the man say y'all y'all go back and tell them to see me some old soldiers say well you know everybody - they say look I won't mean that's not afraid to die for the cause hallelujah I will free I mean that's not afraid to face the enemy if freedom is worth fighting for that you might as well start fighting if your freedom is worth fighting for you wanna start fight your freedom from sickness your freedom from man say don't send these guys send me men that's really that really want to fight for something and glory to God they ended up winning the war glory to God they lost some battles but they won the war and I want to I want to taste so you know we've got to look at this from a couple different angles because Jesus was manifested to destroy that means to ruin or demolish ruin or demolish that was his whole purpose amen to ruin and demolish see glory God but I want to tell you something as well Satan is trying to ruin or demolish you a man so I would rather be on the Lord's side he ain't never lost one battle I have serious doubts that this gonna be his first battle he ever lost in a he's all-time undisputed undefeated champion of love I doubt he's got to lose this one glory to God so I'm gonna stand on the Lord's side the Bible says in John 10:10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but Jesus said I am come that they might have and that they might have it more abundantly more ready God so the devil is trying to steal kill and destroy amen but Jesus is giving you life and he's giving it to you more abundantly now let's read a little something out of the infallible proof of the resurrection this sermon that the Prophet gives us it says this it says and now when God promised a royal seat that would come forth as a savior it's been the work of our or God's enemy to the devil to try to destroy that seat all the way down it's been the work a man of God's enemy or our enemy the devil to try to destroy that seat all the way down the first thing when the righteous son was born Abel and the unrighteous was born Cain first he slew Abel thinking he was getting that right to see hallelujah for he was standing there when God pronounced everlasting earthly judgments upon the people and upon the Serpent and upon the ground and he promised through the woman would come a seed and this seed would bruise the Serpent's head and the serpent brought and the serpent thought at that seed all down through the eight and he's still fighting it hallelujah amen sometimes you know glory to God if we can just put it like this it's not you that The Devil's coming after but it's what you possess somebody breaking into your house that breaking into your car it's about what you possess not necessarily you a matter what you possess is seed of God come from God are you going back to God and when the devil trying to do is destroy that see how are you yeah alright let's go on a little further he says he's still fighting it then when he slew Abel he thought he got it because he destroyed the only righteous part of the sea the only righteous part of the sea now he never did go after Cain right he went out for a glory to God and it shows that Cain was not Adam son this nature that was inside Cain to even be used in this manner he was not Adam son right Adam was not a murderer no sir how are you by Satan is a murderer he was of the wicked one the Bible declares day man hallelujah he said now now then we need slew and we thought he got it but because he destroyed the only righteous part of the sea then God raised up Seth to take his place a beautiful type of death of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ and then he thought he had him when he got the prophets he thought he had him when he got John but when he finally slew the righteous seed and he was buried on the third day God raised him up from the dead the Lord Jesus hallelujah he thought he had him and will go through this you know you can pull it down there we'll go through this in an again a little bit but you know he's constantly coming after that seed trying to destroy trying to destroy it trying to destroy you know he thought he had Christ but you know and like I say everything I mean sicknesses of the devil I've seen it I mean sickness is an attribute of sin glory to God so whatever you might be battling if the doctors say there's this is incurable Jesus can take care of that yes Jesus wants to destroy a demolished that down hallelujah the same devil is trying to destroy you Jesus supposed to take him out you got to give him a chance amen the one thing that the devil had no matter what he used the one thing he had against all men is its death once he got them in the grave he knew it was over and me thought you said it's over that but God would raise up another man to kind of carry it all and then they'd be getting a launch an attack against the enemy hallelujah but when Jesus came along even death itself lost his sting a man even the grave itself lost its victory the Bible said in first Corinthians 15 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death a man thank God for what Jesus did at Calvary because death itself has been destroyed hallelujah glory to God death itself has been ruined how can you say that brother death I mean even the Prophet gives us a different she won't death he said that becomes a buggy what a slave driver to drive me into the presence of God yes so I see myself a man in the chariot part of this buggy and telling them pull me into the press huh Paul me antenna threatens take control [Music] somebody amen we're not afraid of death that is afraid of us hey man death has been ruined when we look at it a man from the eyes of hope we got that hope through Christ's glory of God and I look at this he says this in the in a sermon God I mean the spoken word its original seed he says this God is taking the elect out of out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself did I I'm starting at paragraph 326 on that I might I might a give you the wrong paragraph 326 God is taking a length out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word hallelujah and it goes on said there comes the headstone crying grace grace Amazing Grace the headstone here you are like this see on there see how it is way white down here and it keeps getting closer closer closer to ministry after out here it's Luther justification justified here comes Wesley sanctified Bunch here comes Pentecostal restoration the gifts now God is taken from their holding out a bunch to make a ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the words there's the bride take her out he goes on setting out Christ was manifested glory to destroy the works of the devil I say a man tonight you believe that yeah said now I can't explain all this I'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the hard place so you won't stay too long glory to God I was reminded a man of the scripture glory to God where he says Jesus say the spirit Lord is upon me and he has anointed me a man to recover the side of the blind a man - you know I can't think of it alright now to find up the brokenhearted it's there in Luke 4 find out the brook I set at liberty those that are in bondage those that about Jesus came to destroy he does not want you in bondage gonna break I mean God don't get no glory come on Odyssey you in bondage praise God remember how the Prophet went to the Cincinnati Zoo and they say he wished she can let all the Eagles go free because he hated sin that eagle constantly trying to get above a Mantha the neck or the case that they had in me always trying to get a bumper winning when he get enough amen I'll strip 'mentally to try to fly above that thing he went in the top over to come right back down many times in life we try to get up out of a situation we're trying to get up out of something that the devil galaxy if we know content say he say just like that he was constantly going up or down we have the same struggles and I like with counseling going up and comes to going down but it's time to break free from that oh all he say if I can just take the from exactly when he was bored to the hospital when you're doing the work he goes on he says this he says Christ was manifested as straw that works to the devil you believe that now I can't explain all this I'm just gonna go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believe that that's why what was he God's Word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done he was not born to do that he was born to be net to destroy the works of the devil now listen now his body is to do the same yes sir his body which is you is to do the same if Christ was born to destroy guess what you were born for born to destroy I didn't say he was born to play PT pact with the devil huh I didn't say you were born to make the dirt devil one of your buddies what are your homies now you were born to destroy that fella and let me give you some piece of advice you better destroy any glory his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that's right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as the Hat was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word nondenominational now a virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the hand that's right say my body can't move until my head tells it to move well what if my head is flesh in my body is concrete haha can't move hair can say move move move move but there there's nothing to send a message to hallelujah and the reason that someone else is bound because there's been nothing to send the message to oh hey man we got our heart of concrete the Bible say you have to take a way out throw many hearts and give us a heart of flesh glory to God if we want to move with the head amen hallelujah we gotta have something a singing station I believe brother Troy was chosen about that he said those three things have to line up when you know say when a ship is moving it's not the man that's up in the top of the tower there that's controlling how to ship moves that man is sending a signal to a man that's all the way down in the Lord level the boat but the man that's in the lower level cannot hear the man that's up at the top they have to use a man in the middle man in the middle is what says the message back and forth if the message is wrong the ship will never get out of the port we got the man at the top the man in the middle and the man at the bottom gotta be all aligned up together with that what God's Word say hallelujah get your spirit aligned with his spirit did something happen all right all right all right he says this it says if my head is Christ and my body says denomination how is it gonna work how can purity and a work together uh-huh I love it brother now tell you I like to preach on some of this for a while the way the body operates is by the hip and the head is the word that's right the head is the word now let me just kind of go on a little further here you know the destroy like I told you a man is to ruin or to demolish and we were looking at how Satan hurt in the Garden of Eden with God gave out the punishments a man after the sin to place and and if you're not aware of what took place in the garden of eatin you know Church is still trying to figure this out hallelujah you go to one church and they'll tell you they ate an apple can I just ask a question anybody ever heard that before a date after Peter um estranged me and he heard a tap alright I heard it too what they I found out that was a lie because the question is if they ate an apple and an apple helped them to realize that they was naked why don't we start passing apples again to help people realize their naked right it was not an apple that they ate another thing about this so-called fruit that they ate right evened up having children come on somebody right right two sons were born Cain and Abel were born a man from something that happened in the Garden of Eden right and if apples cause pregnancy right how come they doing that today right hallelujah amen anybody know how they got here y'all know how y'all got here you know how your mom and daddy brought you here you know how you brought kids here if you got if you know that then you know what happened in the car the beach praise the Lord somebody hallelujah hey man let's tell the truth that shame the devil we hit a destroyer work to the death hi glory to God we want to go a little further with that well how was Kane in a before now he came from the same mama the Bible actually say it was the muggle doll living however it did not say that Adam was the father of all living because he wasn't right there was two children born and guess what they happen to be twins right I think there's this word they use super second nation of something like that right and and recently something just came out of the news where a woman had two kids hallelujah and one was one color and the other was another color so the daddy the man that was married to know that now that's not my son can you imagine being in the hospital and the baby comes to babies comfort in the what is this this is not my boy a little mixture in my blood cuz all that's got a little mix but this this this is a little more than a me try to trick me into make them think that there was paper that is not fake child and when they do blood tests they begin to recognize this is not the father then the mother has to come out and tell the truth being the stories that happen all the time it's not consistent but it does hallelujah and then the mommy I'll say well yeah at the same time a man you know I cheated on you and I got pregnant by somebody else and she will try to make the daddy I mean the hospital think that that was his baby no no no no you gotta you gotta tell the truth I'm messy I'll take care mom but I taking care here Oh hallelujah somebody well if they happen that that's that happening today guess what that's the exact same thing happened in the Garden of Eden yeah oh we gonna go a little deeper Adam had this baby through where how does she get pregnant by the others by something else well Baba say what's a serpent what do you mean well let's look at Genesis 3 and you'll see that there were three people or three items that were individuals are three something that got in trouble is that Alright hey there Laurie to God and then we saw Eve get in trouble we saw Adam get in trouble how come the elephant they get in trouble how come the tiger did get in trouble a man they only got in trouble because Adam was in trouble a man but God dealt with the serpent so what does that tell us that tell us that the servants stood on two feet look just like a man talk just like a man walk just like a man hold the serpent and Eve had conversation was to see they were talking to one another hallelujah somebody Amen before you fall and see the uses start off with a little talk don't go sleeping with people just sleep you start email you start calling you start talking awaits at you should be talking before you know it the devil slipped up on you same devil that slips up on you the one you supposed to be destroy its now destroying she didn't get pregnant this just because something they see what's supposed to do it's okay to say that in church they're right he's committed adultery with the serpent with the serpent now I want to taste some has she done this with in her marriage god what a blessed it but when it's done outside of marriage it's not blessed by God God don't like it God don't like it if it's outside of marriage marriage is honorable yeah and the bed is under fire hallelujah fornication not honorable adultery is not honorable y'all gonna say man that's what the Bible say all right I know I'm in there somewhere already God but but but but as we see these things this is what created the problems and as SSS as s as Cain and Abel was born Kaden was the first one to be born Abel come and they were twins they what they were born in the same time they were twins now here we go as soon as they're born they both religious they both both go to worship they both trying to do something for the Lord but uh but when Cain saw that his offer was not being accepted he had a spirit of anger come over jealousy came over him and he say say he say I mean how can God accept this bloody offering that my brother's given and won't take the fruit of the ground God hack punched the earth why would he why would he accept something from the earth that he had already cursed but God gave Abel Abel revelation says gonna be blood Abel brought blood and in a game at all I

guilty just like that nothing else go to jail because of Association watch who you hang we Came would not have been one of my friends because he was up his father devil and it was his job to try to kill the righteous seat that's all he want to do is kill her actually that was Satan's attempt because he knew that the seat was coming through the Worman and here he saw the right to see Adam's right to see coming through Eve as Abel and Cain reaches out to try to kill him from the beginning of time Satan has always tried to kill the right to see look the enemy tried to destroy the seed and Abel but God raised up raise it up itself if you all remember the story of Moses what was he trying to do kill the right to sea at Moses birth hallelujah amen the devil was trying to kill the righteous see in the red sea glory to God the devil thought he had him there but God made a way for the right to see a man Pharaoh's army coming behind him trying to kill the right to see when the Hebrew boys got trapped in the fiery furnace what were they trying to do trying to kill the righteous see where Daniel winter Lyons they were trying to kill the righteous Caesar when David went out there to face Goliath here the same end we tried to keep them under bondage and kill all the right to see the right to see that the righteous nation of Israel but when Goliath thought he had the upper hand God made a way out of no way I love that church I love that now let me just share one other with you Joshua was born to destroy Joshua was born to destroy a man all at ease all these other ones David was born to destroy Daniel born to destroy the Hebrew boy was born to destroy a man you you're born to destroy Jesus born to destroy we're all born to destroy demolish ruin wipe out the devil Josh was born to destruct destroy now one of the things that God told Joshua as they were going into the Promised Land him saying I don't to make any alliances with these people over there in this land don't do anything because these people a man will actually be cause you ought to do some things you're not supposed to do they'll cause you to serve gods that you're not supposed to serve he say destroy them when you went when they went it - winner - Jericho he told him destroy everything utterly destroy everything except rehab and those that are inside rehabs house but everybody else had to die if they were not underneath the toolkit they had to die my god now you might wonder why does God want to kill all the little babies why would God tell Joshua - go ahead kill all these little babies look look babies from Jericho well I mean just a little baby that's just that's just wrong why would God do something like that you just don't understand see one day these babies grow and when they grow up they're gonna want to know what happened to their mamas and daddies and when they realized you killed a momma's and daddies even though you fed them they'll be ready to destroy you hallelujah already God let's look at this a quote out of presuming the Prophet makes this statement a man a man says after after while when Joshua took the land God told him utterly destroy everything there is don't leave nothing why could you imagine some of them it's all right women picking up a little baby oh isn't he cute look at it he ain't even got teeth yet Joseph said kill it oh that's so me kill it I can imagine right now taking a sword out drawing it on the baby Johnson to kill it the mother said oh I'm a mother I can't kill that baby you must hand it here he says says why it might look cute now but it'll grow up and be just like his daddy you you you can't babysit it's got to be handled not with gloves but bare hand it we want we want to be nice everybody does but what is nice we want to be humble what is humility we want to be full of compassion what is compassion she needs a cement will of compassion pass through two or three thousand people water had babies crippled blind hole with he had compassion what did he do walked over here the father showed him a man that may be prostate trouble or something and healed him and walked away and let the rest of them a man full of compassion now people today are English words turns the people around see that's human sympathy that's not compassion there's a lot of difference between sympathy and compassion there's - there there are two different words all together and we use them the same now the word doesn't use any compassion it's got to be your pain stay with that word no matter how bad it cuts glory how would you think in a destroyed babies and innocent women and things like that so come one little leaven leavens the whole lump that's the same thing that started back there with Eve it looked awful cunning well you'll be washed surely you'll not that he's too good see God is too good to kill you he wouldn't kill you but surely you're not you're not dying but God said you would die that started the whole thing right there see you got to stay with the word regardless hey man then he might not have died right then but they died later on yeah they were broken a man the eternal fellowship with God was broken because of what happened in the Garden of Eden now I want to just kind of shift our attention because there's another gentleman in Scripture that was born his whole purpose for being born was so he can destroy all right God brought this man out his mama's womb his bride can even have kids mom couldn't me have children and one day she got visited by the angel the Lord and I want you to try to stay with me on this because if she got visit by the angel Lord an angel or told us say now you're gonna have a son and I'm gonna give you a son and his whole purpose is it is a gift for these Philistines that's been bringing y'all under captivity and in bondage for years y'all have been in captivity but I'm raising up a boy from your your womb and gave the mama bear specific instructions don't cut his hair right and while he's in the womb don't drink okay Wow while he's in the womb mama don't drink right all right can I tell you you carrying something because the church is also represented as some woman and you're carrying the Word of God yes and since you're carrying the Word of God don't drink don't drink you might harm the baby so smooth you might harm the baby hello somebody told play we're seeing glory we got a man you don't want your baby coming out with some addiction and they get the addiction from the momma hit something they get the addiction from the momma you want a mommy that's gonna take care of her body when she pregnant you can't keep acting like things ain't change something has changed come on somebody we don't understand responsibility that goes with this something that's changed you've got to do better with your body you can't keep doing what you used to do you're not living for yourself no more you living for somebody else [Applause] mama don't drink that's what they are you saying on threat and not only to each other mama - mama mama went home and told her husband and when the husband you know I heard about Islam it's just kinda hard to believe say if that's of God let that let him come back again let the man come back again and while she was either feel you know working here come that angel again and she went ran and got I love him say he's here again he's he's here and he went running back out to the feet he was right there when she say my guest she's gonna have a child this challenge to destroy Philistines that's what his purpose is that's why he's being born and saying say now and I also taught don't drink ha ha so I'm telling you as the husband if you see your wife drinking you need to stop up I don't care what type of craving she has you need to stop of it cuz I'm saying don't drink she's carrying the deliverer you say well I think Carol deliver how you know you might be carrying a freak job well you might deliver a lot of people from see you don't know what to carry you might be carrying a Mary [Music] thank God Mira's mama kept up yeah kept it clean you know why because only a virgin could conceive only virgin could gonna see a man if she wasn't if Mary went a virgin she would have got bypass only virgin could conceive Holly Lee only one virgin in the word today is gonna concede Christ all right all right let me go Samson is his name Samson was born to destroy Philistines huh and in his life we can see where this this characteristic was was all was being manifested through him we can see it one time a man there the Philistines were a little upset about something and they think when they came to where the children Israel were they uh they came with his big old group thousand of them came and they like what do y'all want why are y'all coming against us you know they they have one name on the lips they didn't want to mess with the other people just give us Simpson if you give us stamps and we'll take care we all probably resettle we just want this guy see that enemas trying to destroy him right amen and so so so here is that that stamps to say Sampson told his brother saying I look as long as y'all promise me that job won't do anything to me I'd go into Philistines they said no we're not doing that we're just gonna deliver you so we can get ourselves out of some trouble and you go to these field stuff save two went down a thousand oh right and all of a sudden the Spirit Lord came upon all sansa could find no spear no atomic weapon Oh Simpson found was a Joe Joe Joe poem of a mule that had died some time ago all the man had was a chopper right that's like me taking a microphone and trying to beat off death absolutely crazy [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Loreena Samson Samson took the jawbone first would come up when hit him where I'm hitting the next one hit the next one y'all talk about a man y'all look at these little super hero things they ain't got none no Samson 1000 minutes because the reason he did that because he had the anointing on him ain't promise on him that he was gonna destroy Philistines he did exactly what God called me dude all right one time Samson was going somewhere doing something and a little lion come up a little baby lion more to kind of show how tough he was they're gonna take Samsonite he rolled that raw that Samson and that's Baba say the spear Lord came upon snaps and he took the lion and ripped them into what kind of a man is this and brother branham say Samson did not look like one of these guys that go to the gym and just you know that's full of scare people but now you you know you got on you you bought you've got enough he say he look he was just a real a small man the miracle of it was is that he was a small man right right a little as much he took the line it'll ripped it in half Samson you know got upset because there was a wife that he wanted the Bible call her the woman of Timna and when you know he told her he told her that the Philistines I got a I got a riddle for y'all if y'all get the riddle then I'd give you off some clothing and some stuff like this but if y'all don't get the rid of it you have to give me 30 30 garments of changing garments and they said kay so they gave him seven days and these men come around the woman intimidating new Samson loved her and they use that woman y'all go back and read it they use that woman a man to get the secret from Samson I want I want you to understand how she did it the Bible says she came and she just broke down crying so so brother you've got a read description that woman just come with with this just full of teeth [Music] uncontrollable crying hello somebody [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's what she used don't believe you know these people gonna kill me and you know she just used you just tears coming on down say is this done gave it a secret and before you know what they waited seven days on stamps and on the same day he thought he had seventh day and his love was only one way he loved her to give up the secret but she didn't love him because she didn't keep the secret she gave it to some other people and got rich off of it [Music] so Samson Samson Thompson now if y'all would have been messing with my y'all would have been messing with my hair fun preach the word the Bible if y'all would have been messing with my heckler y'all wouldn't got the riddle right the Samson got upset and winning you know he took off leaving town and everything when he got you got away he was going for a little bit they decided to give his way to somebody else so he coming back to town to get his wife and say oh no we thought you weren't coming back so we gave us the idea what with my wife what Samson got some foxes ties I think 300 of them tiny tails again little more fire cinnamon fields of the Philistines it was upset you no need to thank they weren't supposed to do I'm just talking Samson went to a harlots house yeah and in the harlots house they say well we got him that surrounded it surrounded the harlots house so now when he come out we'll give Samson was not even supposed to be in a harlot yeah but because he was born to destroy God delivered him from a Harless house and he took the gates of the city right put him on his back walked up the hill and say I am NOT gonna be found by y'all right seems the Norton of God that was still on one hand though he was insane some yeah I've been a semester places but the Norton of God is doing what do you think protected you from that accident you should have died a long time ago yeah huh huh there Norton of God is what kept you we should have had your fuel but God may be the reason God kept because you weren't ready to meet him hello scumbag Sampson took those gates and now you know that's it don't you think this man with all his problem that eat him had one more time he goes down into the Philistine now he was born to destroy Philistines see that's why he came playing with them he kept playing with he thought he could maybe play with the pretty ones that's it maybe I can get by with this this will name Delilah Delilah daddy I need her imagine the fights that was going on boy don't you realize the last one trying to get you this would say son don't keep going back

match down there with Delilah he laid in her lap and she start playing games you want to know where his strength you know because this this is not this is not amen you know just to I mean this is not just a you know just to have some head knowledge oh why are you so strong no I have a purpose I'm gonna make money off this secret so would you just tell me where we strip that oh you do this to me won't have any strength so they did that finally some chords or something Samson my Samson Landau cheat sheet maybe tickle him a little bit yeah Samson did Philly starts are part of you he woke up whatever he was tired and broke up now he's free he just went off it is go happy laying in her lap and dealing bike filler starts you go back to sleep again oh if you give these green wits and you do this and you do that never know it I mean I'll be I'll be up I'll be just like any other man is that right Samson come on you kidding you know you tie though handing the rest get the green wished and all this other stuff Samson the Philistines are upon you he wake up and when shake it off and see this Fang was a game you know cuz man like the show to women how strong me so this thing is a game to

making me look like you making me look like what you mean I'm making you look like right what you trying to do to me this woman is trying to kill me you cut my ham to be just like any other man come back over there again laying in the lap asleep invited Samson the Philistines are upon you and he woke up and thought he had he he thought he still had I'm gonna do it like I did the last time this time when he got up he had no strength Samson lost all this trip and Samson found himself bound the the prophecy he kept they kept flirting just say as long as you flirt with the world you gonna lose all your strength right he found himself bound to the thing that he was supposed to destroy all right I'm glad that we serve a god that won't leave us in a condition like that if God orchestrated then you were gonna be born to destroy then guess with you were born to destroy and even in his bondage they took out his eyes and that's the first thing they'd ever want to do you do you take out your spiritual eyesight so that you can see you don't even know what's happened when a man it can't see he can easily be in danger may was standing there just and they brought him to the sporting event they wanted to make sport I said you know we want to have any event today and I think the best thing we can do is laugh at this man that done destroyed all of our religious and here he's sitting there and they just they just they just I mean they don't they don't have gladiators frankly nothing we just want to make fun of Samson people can spin on without him knowing who spit on they can walk up and hit him without a knowing who hit him he can't do nothing about this condition he had a simple prayer and I don't I don't care how bad off you may be this morning if you can give God that simple prayer god I don't know where I'm wrong I know what I did wrong should be the conditioning on me I was born to destroy Phyllis time not find myself just being mocked and ridiculed by these fellas fast Lord forgive me God just once more just let your spirit come upon me and saying I'm willing this time to die with the Philistines found a little lads they look boy I just need some help that can't see so if you just do me a favor you know there's two great columns in the middle of this Coliseum you two great columns would you just leave me to widows columns he come just a little lad it's the little lad that prop Samson back it's the little lad that brought him to the place that he was supposed to be it's the little lad and here comes here comes Samson with the amen with the little lamby I don't know if he told him say my son you might want to get out of here but he said there you see they say lord please just once more but all I did just put us put his hands on the poles kind of like Jesus on the cross put their hands on the pole and saying once my lord saying I'm willing to die with these Philistines was full of would you let you couldn't do that without the anointing you can't do nothing without you just just one more time let me die with these pillows - put his hands on the polling and why didn't worry what maybe one of them come up in what you doing Samson with your hands on some posts you got no strip you forgot you gave up your secret and why do you really kill him a lock begin to grow somebody else come up with a win another quick ridicule in another life begin to grow now and like brother Troy said you can't you can't see when you know you can't feel when your hair is growing you can see it but you came Billy now these fellows are so drunk they don't recognize that the man went from bald head come on somebody from bar I mean scalp and hair beacon in the girls lot bro not a lot crude another Locker and before you seven lots have grown back and he had returned back to the anointing hey ignoring that came upon him and he pushed them things down and Moe Philistines died and Samson death then those that died in his life he was born to destroy and if that's what he's born to do they're not gonna get that out of him through life or death born to destroy I want to read a quote this we just bring this to a close oh Jesus Oh once more the message once more the profit makes a statement he says as the strengths begin to move into those big muscles every fiber begin to twist they begin to feel himself again and he twists it out and and when it did the big wall fell all we need to do today to see these denomination walls fall is get deeply sincere before God to heal these blinded eyes that's been blinded from the Word of God that was stamps ins greatest victory he ever had because he was willing to confess over every enemy first that he was brought up to destroy him oh Pentecost stand up to post this afternoon you post of the duty of God's Word repent and cry aloud Lord God wants more let me tell you something you have better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you that's right bring back the old-fashioned prayer meetings corporate prayer on Tuesday night bring back the old-fashioned prayer meetings the real godly repentance the all-night altar service all Pentecost hear me leave or leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you leave it leave it quickly return back to the word of the Lord away from this Hollywood showmanship turn with your whole heart back to the Word of God turn back to the power of the Holy Ghost you women dressed like women you me an act like men like sons and daughters of God turn Oh turn from this Jezebel system is choking you and you god help us to have true repentance not half-heartedly you can't do it Church we got to make a turn that if we're not careful the same devil that we're raised up to destroy if we're not careful that same devil will destroy us you were born just as Jesus was born just as Samson was born you were born to destroy and you destroy your enemy I encourage to destroy your enemy before he destroys you you know one of Cain's enemies was pride jealousy that destroyed and there's been many in the scripture you know you all remember the story of Saul Saul was told and destroy some Amalekites killing kill all the babies and everything but you know what Saud and he went down there and kind of saved the best and when it comes time for saw to die guess who got solved an Amalekite that he was supposed to kill and malachite had now put a sword in him before he destroys you musicians would you come everybody else just bow your heads let's pray father your word is going forward you don't speak just to speak you specifically ordained words to be spoken that would challenge our hearts do you know exactly where we are you know who we are you know where we've been you know where we're going you know you know all about that so there are times in our life where you would specifically challenges to bring us back to a place where we can accept you Lord our only hope is in you our only trust is in you and father how we even heat we need you we realize that we can't make it without you you have protected us from the hands of the enemy time and time again and God you've done that in order to bring us to a place of complete surrender those that were in Jericho all died utterly destroyed there was only one house that was spared and that was the house of rehab because she had the token own display father I pray that as this word has gone forth that somebody recognize that they don't have what it takes to make it and that they got to bring themselves underneath the covering of the blood of Jesus I trust Lord Jesus that you would now just take control of hearts and then your word would make the difference while your has about I want to just give an opportunity for anyone that might feel past that a date is discernment that was for me and I'm being destroyed by the any might find myself like Samson bound to things that I should not be bound to but today I want to be free and the presence of God I believe what the word says that Jesus came to to destroy the works to manifest the work of God destroy the works of the enemy and the enemy has certainly worked in my life but I want to see him destroy it today if that's you if that's you would you would like to make a turn today as Samson made his turn I want you to slip your hand right where your honor just lift your hand right where you are you want to make a turn [Music] [Music] I'm gonna pray for you but while I'm praying for you I want you to just be sincere from your heart and just kind of talk to the Lord in your own special way tell them how sorry you are tell them how much you need tell them how much you want before I pray I want to give another opportunity you know there's gonna come a day in time where God will replace these services back to us watching on YouTube but nothing will be nothing like watching it in the inn and the heavenly sky because we've had opportunity God gives opportunity God gives chance time and time again today I don't want you to leave here you know that you're not right with God [Music] say brother Jack please remember me in the prayer be be like the thief that was on the cross he said Lord remember me if you want to be remembered today in prayer just lift up you just lift up yeah God sees this Jesus father you see every hand ever lifted you see every hand that has been lifted underneath that hand is a heart God that realizes they're not in the place that they should be so God in this presence they are repenting and asking for your forgiveness Jesus I pray that you forgive them and may you destroy the work of the enemy that's in their life breaking every fetter break every chain father in the name of Jesus we come against the works of the devil right now in the people of God a week we come man Satan to loose God's people and let them go father we pray that today people leave here a man with the burden of sin of being free from a broom obscene whatever it is that the enemy has tried to find it may they leave here today knowing that they are free from that and then they don't have to return to that anymore let them die with their Philistine god I pray in there to resurrect to new life they they begin to walk according to your word Lord living according to your word Jesus do what you said you would do destroy the works [Music] we commit each one into your hands Jesus we love you we praise you we
