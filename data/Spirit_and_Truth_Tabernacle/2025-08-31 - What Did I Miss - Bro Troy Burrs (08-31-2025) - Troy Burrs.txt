That's something when your family come &gt;&gt; to church with you &gt;&gt; to celebrate you. &gt;&gt; True. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That says a lot about our sister Brown. &gt;&gt; No, her children. But I got to tell y'all, y'all ain't her only children. Y'all going to have to share Sister Brown.

I see um Kesha and Ryan. I don't see Caprice. Okay. Praise the Lord. Yeah, we all grew up there together. Amen. So, it's just good to see all of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust the Lord bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; I want you, if you don't mind, we're going to read a quick scripture from John 4 and 22. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to take my time this morning. Is that all right? Man, [Music] quick scripture from John 4 and 22. And it says, "Ye worshiped me. Worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship &gt;&gt; the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. He seeketh such to worship him sir &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and they that worship him &gt;&gt; must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord add a blessing to reading of his word. I had in my heart to first sort of define or explain just a little bit of what makes this church spirit and truth tabernacle different from other churches. There have many churches in the land. We know about past many of them to get here this morning. But in my history of different churches, we realize that a lot of times churches are preaching a white throne judgment rapture. What makes us different is that we're preaching to a first resurrection bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So therefore, our dialogue may come across a little different. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, we're preaching to the lost. &gt;&gt; But we're primarily getting a bride ready &gt;&gt; for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, those that may come up in what we call the second resurrection, &gt;&gt; there'll be a group &gt;&gt; and we preach to them as well. Yes. &gt;&gt; And trust that their life is worthy enough at that time to go into heaven. But there will be a cost to pay for missing that first resurrection. So primarily we preach the gospel to a first resurrection bride. You see uh the prophet explains that there is a garment and some of you sisters know uh we have right over here a young lady that does a lot of our alterations. Some know them, some some don't. But she's right across the street is where her shop is. And uh as a seamstress, we know that you take a piece of garment and you lay it out on the table and uh you lay that garment out and you take what's called a pattern. &gt;&gt; Uhuh. And you take that pattern and you lay it upon the garment &gt;&gt; so that you can cut out the pattern. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God told us that who lays the pattern. &gt;&gt; God lays the pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; He lays the pattern by election. &gt;&gt; Now, if you just so happen to wind up in that pattern, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; you can't be lost. &gt;&gt; Church, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he takes that pattern And he cuts he cuts to make a garment. &gt;&gt; That garment is what is used or go up as the bride &gt;&gt; in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Now the rest of the material is still good material &gt;&gt; but it is set aside for maybe another garment &gt;&gt; that is the second &gt;&gt; resurrection. So I want to be &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You hear a lot of times in um history of church and with our religious circles they used to sing a song after the separation. It was called I want to be in a number &gt;&gt; all around the throne &gt;&gt; after the separation &gt;&gt; from the right &gt;&gt; and the wrong &gt;&gt; I want to be in the meeting &gt;&gt; around the throne. &gt;&gt; Now I want to be in that meeting &gt;&gt; but I don't want to be judged at that meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in that first resurrection, there is something that takes place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it's called a wedding. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And to get in the wedding, you have to have &gt;&gt; the right garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have your dress fixed just right. Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can't come any other way but through the door. &gt;&gt; The story about a man who tried to come through the wonder. &gt;&gt; So when they walk through, they say, "Sir, how did you get in?" &gt;&gt; No doubt he's wondering, "How did he know he didn't have the right garment on?" &gt;&gt; And I want you to know Jesus is that door. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's only one provided way. &gt;&gt; He is that door. &gt;&gt; But if you don't know him, &gt;&gt; oh my. &gt;&gt; In other words, in spirit and in truth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're liable to miss it. &gt;&gt; And you know what? That's not saying that you're not a good person. Right. &gt;&gt; You can be &gt;&gt; justified. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Sanctified &gt;&gt; and filled with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and miss it &gt;&gt; and miss it. I want to title this morning, What did I miss? Lord, &gt;&gt; what did I miss? &gt;&gt; And as a subtitle, &gt;&gt; alterations. &gt;&gt; If you a wedding garment, the first thing I guess the bride would do is the one of the most exciting things in the preparation is uh getting that wedding dress. But that wedding dress, you go and you get measured and all of that kind of stuff. And I don't know a whole lot about this cuz I ain't never got no wedding dress. And I ain't go with nobody to get no wedding dress. But one thing I do know is sometime that thing has to be altered. And when they stand up, they pick out the dress, they step up on this pedestal, and they look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; And generally, it's a mirror with three sections. And they turn and they look and they, "Oh, no. &gt;&gt; This this this this ain't it. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Go get me another dress. Then when they find the one that they just fall in love with, now they give it to the seamstress &gt;&gt; preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it. &gt;&gt; To be altered in the message. um a prisoner uh 58. The prophet says this. Now this little kid had never exactly seen himself in the mirror. He says like that. So he come to a city. Make sure I'm reading the right part. No, go to 56. I'm sorry. He says, "As I preached some time ago at the businessman businessman's meeting in Phoenix, Arizona of the reflection of Jesus, reflecting Christian life." I said I was born up here in Kentucky where it's very primitive, especially back when I was a kid. And this certain little boy never had a home like we have here where we had so many pretty ladies that have to have that have to have to look through mirrors all through the house to just uh to keep their hair just in place and so forth. But he had one little mirror, just a little piece tacked onto a tree outside where the wash bench was, where his mother and father used to wash and comb their hair and so forth from this little piece of old mirror tacked onto a tree. And he goes on and says that that mirror was tacked onto the tree and because he was a kid and he was smaller, he used to have to step up on the little bench. Amen. To be able to see himself in the mirror. And so sometime in order to see yourself in the mirror, you have to step up. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me let me put it this way. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Make it &gt;&gt; my your the God you see. Let me say this. The God you see is the God you get. &gt;&gt; The word see in the Bible means understanding. &gt;&gt; You may have an image of God in your mind &gt;&gt; of what he is. Some place him in the uh effect of some old doey grandfather sitting and bouncing the children on his knee. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. So that affects your perception &gt;&gt; of God. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so my perception of God &gt;&gt; affects my reception &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; The way I see God doesn't change him, &gt;&gt; but it does impact my relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's people. Amen. Often in religious circles, we create create an environment of pressure to act like &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; what we never become. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See uh uh uh &gt;&gt; when you're in season &gt;&gt; sometime we have cycles of liberation [Music] &gt;&gt; only to find out that we uh have been cured for a season and only to find out we're right back where we started from. Sometime we're in cycles. &gt;&gt; Sometime we hate what we like. &gt;&gt; And we like what we hate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus. So, we need to quit what we don't want to stop &gt;&gt; and stop what we don't want to quit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; See, when you're passionate, when you're passionate about your relationship with God, you won't settle for any other alternate. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you're a part of the fabric, &gt;&gt; 99 and a half &gt;&gt; just won't do. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need to make a 100. &gt;&gt; Cuz I want to go up &gt;&gt; in the first &gt;&gt; resurrection. &gt;&gt; And just because you've been dealing with something most of your life, &gt;&gt; come on. Come on. doesn't mean that you have to deal with it all of your life. &gt;&gt; Science tells me that a object in motion &gt;&gt; remains in motion &gt;&gt; till an outside force &gt;&gt; stops it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus is that force. &gt;&gt; See, a cycle is always evolving. It sort of feeds on its own energy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's up and it's down. &gt;&gt; And because of the way it's made, it just comes back around and it's up &gt;&gt; and it's down. &gt;&gt; How many seen the little science thing where you have the two balls and the thing there and it just long once you get it going, &gt;&gt; it'll just keep going &gt;&gt; until somebody stops it. Cuz sometime we find ourselves in situations that we're in cycles &gt;&gt; and we need a supernatural force &gt;&gt; to stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see here that God is a God of alterations. &gt;&gt; Yes. And sometime we can't be altered. A l t e r e d. &gt;&gt; Without the altar. &gt;&gt; A l t a r. [Music] &gt;&gt; See, when we look into that mirror, we step up on the podium. Good, brother. &gt;&gt; The altar. Amen. And we check the right side, the left side, and that mirror has a way that you could even see the back. &gt;&gt; And you say to yourself, &gt;&gt; "What did I miss?" &gt;&gt; Cuz Lord, I want to be right. I want to be to look good for my husband. &gt;&gt; Everything has to be just right. But now when you find that uh something is just not quite right &gt;&gt; and you know it's not quite right, what do you do? You go to the seamstress &gt;&gt; and say, "Fix this." [Applause] So now you have to go where &gt;&gt; to the a t a e r &gt;&gt; to get a l t e r d. &gt;&gt; We can't get altered &gt;&gt; without the altar. And so many times we find that people run from &gt;&gt; the altar. &gt;&gt; We feel that we can just do it ourselves. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I can put a stitch or so in this. No, &gt;&gt; you need to go back to the seamstress. That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, you need to go to the altar &gt;&gt; because something situation we find ourself inh. &gt;&gt; It needs supernatural work. [Applause] &gt;&gt; As human beings and scientists, we we we find ourselves. We're very smart people. &gt;&gt; My God, &gt;&gt; very wise people in this age. And we have all we have things we have counselors and we have self-help books and we have all of these things and a lot of times I can fix it myself. You are trying to bypass the door. &gt;&gt; And you find yourself getting free &gt;&gt; for a season, &gt;&gt; only to find yourself back, &gt;&gt; my Lord, &gt;&gt; where you started from. &gt;&gt; You're in a cycle. &gt;&gt; Lord, exactly right, brother. Tell your neighbor, God is a cycle breaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; God will break disciples &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture here that I read was talking about worship. Now, I did a little research and the first place in the Bible that I ever find a call worship was in Genesis 22 when Abraham had to sacrifice &gt;&gt; his only son, &gt;&gt; not his only son, his promised son. I'm going to read a little from there from 22 Genesis 22 uh I guess the second verse. And he said, "Take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou love. See, Abraham was in a place of tempting and he told him to take that thing that he loved &gt;&gt; and sacrifice it upon the altar. &gt;&gt; The A L T A Right. sacrifice it, told him to get rid of it. &gt;&gt; Now, I can only imagine that was pretty confusing. &gt;&gt; Lord, you I you promised for all these years and now you tell me to sacrifice him. But Abraham was obedient. So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood from the burnt orphaning and rose up and went into the place which God had told him. I hope you in the place God told you &gt;&gt; because see unless you're in the place God told you the miracle can't happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. And Abraham said unto the young men, "Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go up yonder &gt;&gt; and worship &gt;&gt; and come again." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He that worship him must worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. Abraham didn't go up there and take an instrument and start singing and shouting. &gt;&gt; He went up to do the will &gt;&gt; of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the scripture says he went up to worship. So he got up there and uh Abraham built the altar. He laid the wood in order, bound Isaac, his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. That thing that he loved, &gt;&gt; he was willing &gt;&gt; to sacrifice it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz God said so. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we know the story. Abraham drew back his hand to slay the son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham, here am I." See, when you when you take that thing that you love to hate, &gt;&gt; but you hate to love &gt;&gt; and you sacrifice it upon the altar, he'll talk to you too &gt;&gt; and say, "I am here." Sometime we feel so far from God &gt;&gt; that we are so far from God that he can't hear our &gt;&gt; cry. But if you get beside yourself and you get to a place where Lord I want to do your will &gt;&gt; and you know inside eternally inside of you that the things that you love but you know that these things are wrong &gt;&gt; but you don't want to That's right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because you love it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to go to the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lay these things upon the altar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And in process of doing so, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; he'll speak to you and say, "Now I am here." Yes. &gt;&gt; See, you have to you have to get beside yourself &gt;&gt; and lay ourselves on the altar of &gt;&gt; self sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So, want to be free &gt;&gt; of these things that perpetuate &gt;&gt; these cycles in our lives. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You have to lay them &gt;&gt; on the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a cycle is when a person is in a pattern of destructive behavior, &gt;&gt; sir. where I said you experience a season of liberation only to find yourself right back in to captivity. The Bible offers us some insight into this situation. See, there was a woman who needed some alterations. &gt;&gt; There was a woman down in Samaria, &gt;&gt; right? that uh needed some alterations. See, she was in a cycle &gt;&gt; and she needed a cycle breaker. &gt;&gt; See, most people would look at this woman at the well and said she have a relationship problem. Let me let me lay this down first. John 4. I guess I'll start there at the fourth. Jesus said he must needs to go through Samaria. Now, he could have went up another way along the coast there. That was the way of the good Samaritan. The young man uh that was robbed and beat up and left half dead. And they took him, the good Samaritan took him to the inkeeper. He said, "Fix him. take care of him and I'll pay you later. Amen. But she went to this place uh Christ went to the place there in Samaria then cometh to the city of Samaria which is called Saikar. Now I looked up Saikar and when I looked at the definition of Saikar as just a bad place in the city &gt;&gt; and folks he care about Riviera Beach just as much as he care about Wellington [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; maybe there's someone there &gt;&gt; sitting on a whale &gt;&gt; who needs cycles to be broken in their lives. &gt;&gt; True. So we don't avoid that's what if you read the definition of psychology it's a it's the older bad place there not saying river is a bad place but it has that stigma &gt;&gt; back when I was a teenager raw ver &gt;&gt; yeah I got somebody attention then they know about raw [Laughter] So, uh, they were near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now, Jacob, Jacob's whale was there. Jesus therefore being wearied in his journey, sat thus on the whale, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said unto her, "Give me a drink." For his disciples were gone away into the city to by me. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew as of me which am a woman of Samaria? The Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. Amen. In other words, she probably just come down there with her rollers in her hair, paint the picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just coming to get me some water. Don't bother me. I don't even feel like being bothered. &gt;&gt; But she needed some cycles to be broken. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I said that, you know, Christ was talking to her just to pick up her spirit. &gt;&gt; See, if you're going to talk to somebody, first you have to kind of find out where they're at. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't just come and just throw the Bible at them. So in other words, &gt;&gt; what Jesus was doing, &gt;&gt; he was diagnosing her problem. &gt;&gt; Like I said before that many would have thought that well she has a problem with relationships. She may have a a problem. Amen. With a a lust problem &gt;&gt; on the outside looking like looks like what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus here uh uh diagnosing her. In order to break the cycle, you have to get to the root cause &gt;&gt; of the issue. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because if you just sit down and take her to the marriage counselor or the psychiatrist to find out why she keep getting these wrong men, &gt;&gt; they're going to fix the symptom. Right. &gt;&gt; But never got down to the root of the problem. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; So Jesus answered and said unto her, Amen. Let me back up. The woman said to him unto him, "Sir, thou have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep from whence from then uh from whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well to drink thereof himself and his children and his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall never thirst again." Now he's getting her attention. I hope I got your attention this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I shall give him I'm sorry. Whosoever drinkketh this water shall never thirst again. But whosoever drinkketh of this water that I shall give them shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give them shall be in him a well of water springing up &gt;&gt; unto everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Now see the woman saith unto him, "Sir, give me this water." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus said unto her, "Go call thy husband." See, surgery was starting to happen. &gt;&gt; "Go call thy husband, and come hither." &gt;&gt; The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said unto her, "Thou has said, thou has well said, I have no husband, for thou has had five husbands, and he whom thou hast is now thy husband." And oh, I'm sorry. And he whom thou h thou now has is not thy husband. And that saidest thou truly. The woman said unto him, "Sir, I perceive you to be a prophet." Now, now, now, now I want you to notice something. First, he was, "Man, leave me alone." But after he began, &gt;&gt; he first diagnosed her situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; And then he began to feed her the inoculation in pieces. So now we begin to see her eyes becoming open. First he was a man. &gt;&gt; Now she says, "I perceive you to be a prophet." &gt;&gt; So we getting somewhere. Now [Applause] our fathers worship in this mountain. And ye say that in Jerusalem is this place where men ought to worship. Jesus Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father." Now we back at our text. Ye worship and ye know not what we know that the worship uh we know now that we worship and salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. So God is a spirit and he that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, &gt;&gt; when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus said to the woman, "I that speak unto thee am he." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; she he was a man &gt;&gt; at the well, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Then he became, "Sir, I perceive you to be a prophet." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; To the Messiah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, so her problem wasn't a relationship problem. &gt;&gt; Her problem wasn't the fact that she had five husbands. Her problem was a lack of understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Her problem was a lack of revelation. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Her problem was that he hadn't come into the presence of almighty God. So the cycle was perpetuated. Amen. And going from man to man to man to man. And that wasn't her problem. Her only problem was that she needed to know who Jesus was. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That was the thing that broke the cycle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden, she dropped her pot. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And she ran into the city. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Saying, "Come see a man &gt;&gt; thank you." &gt;&gt; Can I paraphrase him? &gt;&gt; Who broke the cycles. &gt;&gt; Come see a man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who delivered me from the cycle that I couldn't get out of. &gt;&gt; Come see a man &gt;&gt; who told me about all my problems. Amen. &gt;&gt; At that point, &gt;&gt; her garment was altered &gt;&gt; in the presence &gt;&gt; of the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; See, she came to the w to the well thirsty, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; for water. Now, I looked into this a little bit. And when you're thirsty, Amen. Thirst is just a form of dehydration. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And uh the first symptom of feeling thirsty may be a little dry mouth &gt;&gt; and uh slightly fatigued. Mhm. &gt;&gt; You might also notice uh some changes in uh your bodily fluids. &gt;&gt; Now, with that first stage of dehydration, you might realize you're thirsty and just say, "I need a glass of water." &gt;&gt; And a glass of water might suffice that. Now you go and get this bottle water that we have today and it don't do it like that real water cuz see science have discovered that what we need is water with things like potassium. &gt;&gt; In other words, we need living water &gt;&gt; to hydrate. That second stage of dehydration you again the symptoms of dizziness, lightadedness, but this one may have some elements of rapid heartbeat. Amen. Now the bodily functions uh begin to decrease. So now it's affecting uh uh uh uh uh your body. Amen. If you ignore that first stage of dehydration, science tells us that if you're already thirsty, if you wait until thirst comes, you're already dehydrated. In that first stage, &gt;&gt; you have to stay &gt;&gt; hydrated. That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to stay hydrated with living water. &gt;&gt; Goes on to that third stage, Amen. of dehydration. Now that third stage of dehydration, Amen. You have the same as the other ones. The lightadedness, rapid heartbeat, Amen. Not sweating. Amen. continued fluid loss, you going to need more than just a drink of water. &gt;&gt; If that third stage of dehydration set in, you going to need a medical professional. &gt;&gt; You're going to need somebody to come and give you an IV. &gt;&gt; See, now it's not so see because you ignore that thirst. Come my mighty Lord. You ignore that thirst the first time. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And then you ignore that thirst the second time. &gt;&gt; That third time you begin to get confused. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I've experienced firsthand that level of dehydration. I was working outside and being electrician, I'm working on a light pole and this light pole had about eight different fixtures on it. I had to bring it down and I had to replace all of the lights and it happened to be that uh uh uh there was trees all around me. There was just a little spot in the midst of a bunch of trees that I can work on the lights. So there was no breeze, nothing but heat. &gt;&gt; Hot. Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm just sweating, but I want to get this done. So I'm working on the first light. No problem. Disco here, disco there, disco there. I had to rewire the ballast. Didn't put the light in. Hold on, y'all. So I'm just working. First one done. Take get down, get off my ladder, go up. Second one done. By the time I got to say the fifth light now, there was eight on this what we call high mass pole. By the time I got to that fifth fixture, I had totally forgot how to do it. &gt;&gt; I just did five. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But by the time I got to that next one, I was totally confused. sitting there looking at the wires not knowing what to do with them. Recognize that something ain't right. &gt;&gt; So I got my and see the dangerous part of it that I was in a am I could have fell out and nobody knew. They wouldn't have realized it until I didn't show up to clock out. &gt;&gt; Where is he? I'm in there laid out. Somebody come get me and take me to the end keeper. But I realized, so I got myself down off the ladder and I went through the trees. My truck was parked right there. And luckily, I had fixed myself a large cooler uh uh uh uh with ice and Gatorade. And I grabbed my cup and I filled it up and I went sat in the truck, cranked the truck truck up and turned the air condition on high and drank my Gatorade. So when I got myself just a little cooled off, I went back and I did another fixture, no problem. But by the time I got to the other fixture, I was confused again. And I went back to my truck, sat in there for about 30, 40 minutes, took my time, went back and I was able to finish job just like that. But I had got to that point of dehy just before that point of deh dehydration where I were going to need some medical attention. But even in that form, that place of dehydration, it didn't take me long to get back into emergency situation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Soon as I went back, I had just enough oil. &gt;&gt; But I didn't have enough oil &gt;&gt; in my lamp &gt;&gt; to finish the job. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I had just enough &gt;&gt; to get to the next fixture. &gt;&gt; So that dehydration, this woman at the well, &gt;&gt; probably was thirsty, &gt;&gt; but a lot of times she was drinking the wrong water. And we may get a little bit of freedom, &gt;&gt; but not enough oil. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; In our lamb &gt;&gt; to take us all the way through the journey. &gt;&gt; See, it goes back to the first part of what I was talking about. You may be a that that that that pattern and that remnant of that pattern &gt;&gt; was cause was called the foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Now see they were all virgin and holy &gt;&gt; good people because they are cut from the original pattern. But that pattern, that fabric that was cut, Amen. from that pattern, that group was called the five wise version. &gt;&gt; And see, they had just enough oil for themselves. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But that foolish version, you see, because they didn't have enough oil, they had to keep uhh they went to the uh wise version say, "Give us some of your oil." &gt;&gt; And they say, "I had just enough to keep myself hydrated &gt;&gt; so that I can get to the end of my journey." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, you're going to have to have enough for yourself. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If mama won't go, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; I got to have enough for myself. &gt;&gt; If children won't go, &gt;&gt; I got to have enough &gt;&gt; for myself. &gt;&gt; If my friend won't go, &gt;&gt; I got to have enough &gt;&gt; for myself. &gt;&gt; You got to have enough oil &gt;&gt; in your lamp. &gt;&gt; Amen. for yourself. &gt;&gt; So we see here that this uh Samaritan woman what was keeping her is she was drinking of the wrong water. &gt;&gt; It'll only last for a season. It gave her enough to make her feel good upon her flesh &gt;&gt; because it says that they they were good and holy, sanctified, justified. &gt;&gt; Feel the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's just enough water &gt;&gt; to get to the next fixture. Then you got to go back. See, there was in a cycle. Yes, sir. So when you begin to break these cycles, she had to understand in the presence of God who he was because what she was drinking of would not suffice her through the end of the journey. Now, if you don't have enough water to take you through the end of the journey, you'll have to come up in the second &gt;&gt; resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, my point today is while you can, the altar &gt;&gt; is ready for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, I'm I I I want you to know that any Abraham had to go to a place and make an altar. &gt;&gt; Find you an altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The altar upon your heart. And everybody come to a place in their life where they have a me moment. &gt;&gt; I may not know you. I may not know the secret things of your heart. &gt;&gt; I might not know the cycles that you're going through. &gt;&gt; I may not know, but I know someone who does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he coming to your well &gt;&gt; to give you a drink of water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That you'll never thirst again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you'll never thirst again. I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; You see, you have to step yourself upon that altar &gt;&gt; and ask yourself, &gt;&gt; "What did I miss?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are your garments sparkling? &gt;&gt; Are they white as snow? &gt;&gt; Are you washed &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you washed? &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many times, Amen. we find oursself just comfortable in the cycle of religion. &gt;&gt; Try to get you to the next fixture. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But it won't get the whole job done. &gt;&gt; I just got to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; Yep. It'll get you to the next fixture, &gt;&gt; but we want to go all the way to the end. Amen. We want to make sure that our garment is just right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The musicians, come stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] See, uh, I don't been through enough trials myself to play church. &gt;&gt; It's God's grace and mercy &gt;&gt; that brought me this far. many years ago when we were coming up in church and as just young children basically. Amen. We didn't have an understanding of these things. But the Lord has blessed us to have a true understanding of the gospel. Now, it ain't bragging when it's true. It ain't bragging when it's true and I'll stand on it. &gt;&gt; I'll hang my soul on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, there's a different kind of word &gt;&gt; that'll get you in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; And I thank God that I'm a part of that pattern. It was by his divine election that he chose me. And it's by his divine election that he chose you. And I know many are just running. But see that pattern that he laid out on that fabric, he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world. [Music] And his mind, his thoughts are perfect. &gt;&gt; And he say not a one of mine will be lost. &gt;&gt; Now you can run, but you can't hide. He will run you down. &gt;&gt; See, that's why you can't look at your friends. &gt;&gt; You can't look at other people around you. It's me, Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, he may not be dealing with them &gt;&gt; the same way he's dealing with you. [Music] &gt;&gt; That woman had a problem. No doubt that she wanted to be free. Tried to diagnose herself and was at her wit's end. Caught in that cycle. She needed a cycle breaker and Jesus this morning is that cycle breaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Dear God, our heavenly father, Lord, you are the ruler of everything, [Music] the king of our thoughts. uh our peace, our comforter. Lord God, you know each one of us by name. Scripture says you can count the numbers of hairs on our head. You know the things that we struggle with in our secret place. Those things that we just don't talk about with nobody else. Lord, may we go into that secret garden, oh Father God, and just commune with you. And Lord, may the cycles be broken this day. This day, Lord. Jesus, you're passing this way. Lord, we had no idea of who was going to be here. Lord God, this morning, oh Father God, those that you have here, oh Father God, I believe you spoke to somebody's heart, somebody needs the garment altered, Lord, may we willingly come to the altar to be made over. Lord, like Jesus, you had said you had a need to go to Samaria. Lord, she no doubt pulled on your heartstring [Music] to because she's a part of that original fabric, Lord. Lord, we ask you, oh Father God, to bless those that hear hear the word. Lord God, meet them at the point of their need, oh Father, give them strength and courage, oh Father God, to say, Lord, what must I do to gain eternal life, Lord? Lord to be a part of that first resurrection. Now Lord as we prepare amen to leave this place but never your presence be with us throughout the day Lord we thank you for all things Jesus name I pray. Amen. Brother Solomon [Music] [Music] Praise the Lord. How many appreciate this the message this morning? Amen. Amen. How many wants to be altered? I know I do. I need help. I look at my life daily and I see my faults. I know I need Jesus. We all have our battles. Nobody perfect. We all going to meet Satan daily. He's going to fight. He's going to point you at your faults. He wants to keep you away from the Lord. So, he's going to tell you you're not good enough. You'll never be good enough. But I'm so glad Jesus said, "Come as you are." If you come as you are, he'll meet you right at the point of your need. Amen. Let's sing this song together before we leave. [Music] Pass me not, oh gentle Savior, hear my heart, oh cry, bow on others, thou are glory. Oh, do not pass it by. I'm crying. Saveior, Savior, hear my humble cry. Oh, and while others thou are calling do not pass. Second verse will let me at thy throne of mercy will find a sweet relief. [Music] kneeling kneeling there in deep conting I'm crying saveior oh savior Hear my humble cry. Oh, and while on others thou are calling to now pass by. [Music] I'm crying savior. Oh my savior here my heart. Oh cry. Oh, and while others thou are alling, do not pass me by. I'm crying. Saveior. Oh, Savior, hear my cry. Oh, and while others [Music] on others do not pass me by. Come on, one more time. Oh, I'm crying. Savior. Oh Savior. Oh Savior. My humble cry. [Music] Oh, and while on other thou are calling, do not pass may by while on others and while on another thou are calling. Do do not. No, no, no, no, no. While another sing while another thou are calling. Do not pass me by. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord, for such a simple message, Lord, that you deliver to us today. We thank you, Lord God, that your servant was able to get himself out of the way, that you were able to speak through him to our hearts, Lord. Father, we all need to be altered, Lord Jesus. We can look in the mirror daily, Lord, and see so many faults, Lord. Father, a person looks in the mirror to see what's wrong, Lord, and they believe what was in that mirror because what the mirror is reflecting is the truth, Father. That mirror is not lying to us, Lord Jesus. It's telling us exactly what's wrong. It's seeing something that we don't see. So, Father, as we look in the mirror of your word, Lord Jesus, we can look and see. Oh, Lord, I'm not where I'm supposed to be. Father, you brought me from a mighty long way, but I'm not what I'm supposed to be yet. And Lord God, we know that we need to be altered, Lord God. Sometime a a high temper, Lord Jesus. Sometime, Lord, I I want to watch TV too much. Lord, I need these things altered. And sometimes, Lord, it's not necessarily sin. But it's a wait, Father, it's getting in our way, Lord Jesus, of our time alone with you. Our time of worship, Lord. Lord, we need to be more in prayer, Lord God. We can we can sing too much, Lord. We can we can talk too much, Lord, but we can never pray too much. So, Father God, continue to deal with our hearts and lives, Lord. We want to be in the image of our Lord Jesus. We want oil in our lamps, Lord God. Father, so that we can make it in that first resurrection and rapture. Lord, Father, we're ready to go home. We see Israel in their homeland. The gospel is getting ready to go back to them and war to the Gentiles that are without the door. When the gospel goes back to the Jews, there won't be one more saved. So, while you're passing by, Lord Jesus, save your children. You promise you'll never lose one. Father, as we prepare to leave this place, but never your presence, Lord, be with your children, Lord. Grant traveling mercies to each one, all of our brothers and sisters that'll be traveling back, Lord, from this from from this holiday weekend. Lord, be with them. Keep us all safe and out of harm's way. Lord, bring us all back at the appointed time we pray. It's in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. All may be seated and our brothers to come and dismiss you at this time. Thou are calling. Do not pass me by. I'm crying. Saveior. Saveior, hear my humble cry. Oh, and while others now are calling, do not pass me by. I'm crying save [Music] my humble cry. Oh, and wow on others now for glory. Do not pass me by. I'm crying save my humble cry and my own mothers thou are calling [Music] You now pass me by. [Music]
