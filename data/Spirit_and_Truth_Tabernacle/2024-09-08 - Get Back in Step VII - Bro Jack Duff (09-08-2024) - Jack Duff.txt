uh to service but you know nonetheless we thank god um one of our sisters had to go to the hospital and last night um and uh the uh enemy was attacking her body and they called me roughly around 10:00 at night and I said we not accepting this package that the devil is sending I said we we are we going to pray amen and um and we prayed for sister Verna and um uh I say let every test come back negative and um and all the tests came back negative and they released her and sent her [Applause] home so we we thank the Lord for that and I I sent brother Jimmy this morning brother um uh um brother Simba read a quote there at the closing of prayer and about applying the token over our sickness and not accepting none of this stuff and uh I sent that to brother JY and said we as brother assemble reading and praying over it I was thinking about sister Vera so I just I applied that token towards her and amen and he text me right after prayer this morning say she's home and she's resting so we thank the Lord for that amen praise the Lord and uh we want to remember brother um quu in prayer he was invited to go down to Homestead and to preach to church there and brother um uh hos went with him to do the interpreting uh so I want to just keep him and pray that the Lord will use him uh for the Saints there in the homestead uh Florida praise the Lord good to have brother DJ

that we just we've been doing for years this Emmanuel that we've been doing for years and and uh but some of the Saints say we never seen no choir uh do do do nothing like that so man we that's just south Florida that's what we that's what we do you know and uh but we just enjoyed ourselves Amen in the presence of the Lord and and and very very uh grateful amen that God gave us that opportunity amen um I wanted to also just uh remember um uh last Sunday and thank God for brother uh brother Jerry amen coming to bring the word of the Lord I shall be changed and he just did a wonderful job I know that we had a few issues with the technology but uh the brothers have been working to try to get that corrected and uh but nonetheless amen it was a wonderful wonderful thought amen that was given to the people of God we thank God for that a amen um I know it was something else I was supposed to announce and like my brother said when you get past 25 the second time man you better write it down cuz it'll come and it'll go and and and and I know that it'll come back at some point in time but nonetheless I thank God for all things amen amen oh um this season um you know I just got uh slam with a bunch of testimonies bunch and most people don't uh don't know that all this is happening in their Church um but uh I I wanted to just make mention that if you are in the market for a house whether it's or an apartment whether it's rental or purchase this is the season for you to get it amen [Music] uh in our church I have heard multiple testimonies of people uh moving and buying new houses and selling houses and multiple testimonies just just start coming just out of nowhere and and brother brother um brother uh oh that was the other thing I was supposed to mention Wednesday night we thank God for Brother Steve amen uh coming to bless our hearts amen we just we just really you know the the the importance of a desire you know and and it was just talking about how how powerful that is and he made a statement there he says you know sometimes um you know you'll take a grenade and you'll throw it and and it just won't go off nothing happened uh it says but the pretty much the contents of what's in there you just leave it there because somebody going to throw another grenade and somebody else going to throw another grenade I don't care how many of them don't go off when one goes off it causes everything else to go off and and that's why I'm sharing with you all testimonies that God is moving this season on houses amen and apartments uh the grenades are going off praise God I'm telling you the grenades are going off so I told my wife I said now you know I I thank God all these natural houses but there's a spiritual house that I'm looking for amen and I'm expecting a big explosion boom [Music] Hall glory to God so this is the season church I I encourage you amen amen step out uh and receive what God has for [Music] you I have um amen the um privilege of dedicating another baby amen this morning and um we're so grateful amen that the Lord has blessed uh brother Maris and sister Jima with a a a newborn and uh praise God praise God and uh sister Jima celebrating her birthday today and you know just what a perfect way to celebrate that you dedicate your own child back to the Lord amen the Lord is good you know he he brought her through amen uh this uh pregnancy there was some some touch and go situations there but uh God watched over her through the entire process and allowed her to bring the baby and uh and we thank the Lord for just uh uh for for allowing Zion Amen to come into our midst and and watching Nova Mama Amen in the process so uh he brought me through this he brought me through that and Lord I'm Grateful hallelujah amen to you glory to God so we will um just read a scripture here and we'll have amen the parents bring little Zion Amen on today praise the Lord amen Luke 8 18 uh Luke 18 we'll read from there verse 15 praise the Lord Luke 18 and uh starting at verse 15 amen the Bible declares and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for uh of such as the kingdom of God and verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein amen and the prophet told us um we dedicate uh we bring them and dedicate them we don't baptize uh uh the babies we wait till they come to an age where they understand uh who Christ is and what Christ did for them in their life uh realizing that we were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity and we all need Christ uh but when we dedicate them amen this is simply an act of just the parents bringing the child back to Christ as he has given the child to them and it's the parents responsibilities to raise that child in a Godly atmosphere that they would come to a a spot in their life where they would recognize that they need God Amen keep them in church uh you know do all you can I mean some sometimes they get old they depart some of us got children that done did that but you know we when we've done everything we supposed to do like like brother brother Steve was saying on on on on Wednesday night like you know God's prayer going to get answered tonight we done did what we supposed to do God going to answer answer that prayer at some point in time and ain't nothing that yall can do to stop God from answering that prayer I don't care how far in sin they go they got to come back it just make your testimony greater that's all I don't care what God got to deliver you from it's just going to make your testimony greater and it's going it's going to set somebody else free when they hear your testimony right so so so uh as parents you just do your best in raising them amen and you leave the rest of it up to God Amen but here you know brother brandom said we bring them and dedicate them any Mothers any church any Creed any color anything else we dedicate all little children to the Lord Jesus Christ as the parents would bring Zion amen at this time praise the Lord amen my my my my my my my glory glory my dressed like Daddy today see this this is all right I I like this let me just read a scripture over Zion um praise the Lord the uh Bible says in Jeremiah 1 verse 4-5 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations amen let's pray over Zion amen this morning [Music] we praying for Zion Israel amen let's pray father we thank you for this father and this mother that you've blessed with uh a child God we know that you watched over sister Jima through this entire process this touch and go and many things that she she endured but God you allowed her to bring life into the world and now we have Zion Israel in our hands family has brought the child back this morning to be given to you and Lord we pray your blessings over Zion Israel father that um you would raise him up for your glory god that he would be used by you he be kept by you watched over by you Lord from this day and Lord to the day you might call them home but Lord we just trust that this would be a life dedicated to the service of God lord May the parents be blessed in every way father they be able to provide for this child and the other children that they have oh God thank you for blessing their home oh God and just ask Lord that you meet every need that they have thank you for Zion Israel thank you Lord that we have a chance to bring Zion back to you we dedicate him today in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all right sister take a picture [Music] bring them in them in oh bring from the fields of sin oh bring yes bring them in oh bring the little ones to Jesus praise the Lord amen we certainly thank God for adding to the church amen he adds from within and he adds from without uh we thank God for all things oh my let me see here um all right there we go okay you all can stand with me uh we will read a scripture musicians thank you all very much and also the specials that went forth God bless you uh for that my God we return on this morning to our uh thought on get back and step and our inspiration of I will restore sayeth the Lord um if you all could put the drum on mute for me put the drum on mute thank you um Joel chapter 1 and uh verse 4 we'll read actually every every instrument because there's a little feedback just put every instrument on mute if you don't mind we'll turn them off later on thank you um thank you my brother Joel 1 and four it says that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left hath the caterpillar eaten over in Joel chapter 2 uh I'll start at verse uh 21 and it says um fear not oh lamb be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things he's doing it right now amen uh Be not Afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the lad ring in the first month uh and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my my spirit upon All Flesh oh my what a promise and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy amen your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood uh before the great and terrible day of the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call The Lord At a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a brief word of prayer dear God we are grateful uh for the ability to read the scripture uh but we realize it takes the Holy Ghost to make the scripture live uh for the time period in which we are living help us to uh rightly divide and apply amen the uh the word of God to our generation and God we pray that even now you take control over every thought that is being presented as well as every thought that's being received get Glory out of this portion of the service God we give you amen the honor may you have the preeminence now in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen again we turn our attention back to get back in Step this is part six amen of um of our journey amen and our inspiration has been our restore saith the Lord um and there's been you know a number of things that um um uh that we have just kind of been walking through amen and as we are uh just kind of turning a corner in this we're we're getting into this third part of the restoration amen and uh brother Quinton Jr had kind of uh started us down a journey here when he was teaching on the gifts and and I know he ain't finished with that so we're going to have to get him back up here to to teach some more till he finish that thought but I knew the Lord had allowed him to step right into where I was headed and uh and now we want to get into this section now I already know that uh the material that I have will I cannot preach it all in one service amen but I I want to uh preach enough to get our minds amen thinking about it uh also I would love for a man to get the conversations in the home talking about it amen because when we talk about him and when we think about him then he begins to draw closer and closer to us hallelujah amen but here let me just start with a quote out of the restoration of the Bride tree uh this very first quote there on the list that I gave you all says and if four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree amen he says do you get it and he says uh amen for God said I will restore it now this is important I remember when we did the Mion Walker service brother Troy was very very uh he was he was he was making sure that we understood that the restoration is not something that any man does this restoration is something that God himself does amen and and if God is the one doing it there is nothing that nobody can do to stop it amen nothing nobody can do to stop it this is a promise from God God it says for God said I will restore it he's going to restore it how by fourth death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second uh John Wesley by sanctification now remember I told you the um the theologians when they when they read these scriptures and Joel their their uh their uh comments were uh we don't really know what this SEC is and we don't really know what this really means you know it's uncertain that's what they were saying but a prophet is given us prophetic a man definitions here as to what this means and I and I've mentioned this before and I'll say it again just by you being a part of a message church and brother brother Simba ask y'all that this morning says are you happy to be in church he says are you happy to be a part of a message church are you happy that you believe that God sent you a prophet are you happy about these six just the mere fact that you are in a message Church you are a part of this scripture you are a part of the restoration you are fulfilling the restoration oh Hallelujah you couldn't you couldn't separate from it if you triy amen because you part of the word how can the word deny the word it can't happen amen so so so here he says by four death messages killed it then four life messes will restore what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost amen what was the fourth the word what the word there uh there were four great prophets now I I'm I'm going keep reading in this but it's very important that we catch what the prophet is trying to tell us he he goes on says one of them Martin Luther now in in the spiritual aspect he's saying uh Martin Luther dealt with certain things when he brought in justification he start preaching that to the church amen and then uh he said he says Martin Luther he began to shine a light that was the light of justification there was a little light uh just a very small strength of justification he says Alone Come Wesley stronger now when when when and what what he's saying here because Martin Luther even though he preach justification Martin Luther was still smoking a pipe right right he was still smoking a pipe even though he preaching justification and then there were certain comments that Martin Luther made that I mean the prophet say he probably should never never said things like that right but but but it it was it it simply it is that Martin Luther was not a prophet amen he was a reformer but not a restorer oh Hallelujah but he was a part of the process yes sir amen and then then when when John wesle comes along he began to preach not just justification but he goes a little further he says sanctification now and sanctification that mean get rid of your pipe huh amen stop smoking oh y'all ain't going to preach fin amen you got to stop smoking in sanctification you got to start living right stop your drinking stop your smoking come on somebody stop your sinning amen a Sanctified life don't do that stop your lusting hello somebody this is what a Sanctified this is even before the Holy Ghost come oh my my my the Bible said the Bible tells us lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets us some things we just got to give up right amen we don't even ask God to take them from us we just give them up but this is what sanctification did sanctification allows us to live a clean life before God amen amen amen we we talking about that the last time that that the woman at the well and Jesus had to tell her you know that that that that that that that the you know go get your husband and come she say I don't have no husband yeah the five you've had were not yours and the one you living with right now it's not yours say what and and and rather than her get upset about somebody revealing her sin you know she say come see a man who told me the things that I done she had the right attitude she could be delivered because she had the right attitude God wants to take care of the sin problem first before he can actually bless us amen you're the b your sometime let me just put it way our blessings are hindered by sin in our life amen and the scripture actually say your sin will withhold good things from you all right I'm going on but this is sanctification amen this is sanctification now look at this he says there was a little light just a very small strength of justification along came Wesley stronger sanctification oh my God and after Wesley come stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet now this is what brother brandham is calling him in another great prophet se but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn on hearts of the children back to the faith of faith of God the fourth light now um we'll we'll we'll we'll come back to some of that a little bit later but um just uh so that I I I I hit this earlier and you know the four death messages were the Palmer worm the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar what the palmerworm did he destroyed the brotherly love and the fruit amen the Fruit of the Spirit uh the Locust ate the leaves of divine Fellowship the korm he attacked the doctrine amen or the Rel or the covering of the church and then the caterpillar comes along and sucks the very life it's the same insect in four different stages now he says for death Messengers which is the Palmer worm the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar those are the four death Messengers but he said for Life Messengers brings amen brings it back into the church and the life Messengers was Luther Wesley Pentecost and then Malachi 4 that's why we thank God for a prophet because we have amen the fullness of the word now let me just make make make it very clear I don't think we should be a church with the fullness of the word but a church that does not have justification I don't think we should be a church with the fullness of the word and a church that does not have sanctification can I go a little further I don't think we should be a church with the fullness of the word and not have the restoration of the gifts right if we going to have justification we going to have s ification and we going to have the words you can't get there with bypassing the gifts sir sir all right all right all right not all brother all right this is where we had it cuz that the gifts were a part of the restoration amen we know people got the gifts amen uh they were using they were they were I mean pretty much out out of control with it amen we realize that but we not we not leaning on that side amen we leaning on the side where God promised to restore these things so they supposed to be in the church all right let me go a little further let me read a little bit this morning Hallelujah here out of the message the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way the unchangeable God now in this previous quote brother brandom said that the uh he call him four prophets they call him four prophets Luther now we know Luther was a reformer but the word of the Lord came to him this is why brother bandam calling him a prophet right but but and and John Wesley was also a part of reformation but the word of the Lord came to him that's why call him a prophet now this restoration of gifts do you realize the man that's responsible amen for the zza Street Revival amen back there they call that man a prophet people called him a prophet William Seymour Hallelujah so brother brandham called him this oh my there there was a certain Revelation came to William Seymour and he he held to that let me just go a little further let me read before I get ahead of myself the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way oh my my God watch this he says now but when Jesus came we found out he was born in a manger so right quick the Jews disagree he didn't come the way he thought uh they they thought he was to come so they just excommunicated him from their fellowship and he was no more in it but watch what he done uh uh he that that didn't stop him when Pentecost watch this now when Pentecost was first born the church was excommunicated and I'm going to give you a little history in a little bit that's going to tie right into what brother Brandon saying here the church was excommunicated too that that didn't stop the message oh my Hallelujah there their message was that they believe the gifts were supposed to be in the church now they focused on the tongues more more more than any other gift but they believe them gifts were supposed to be in the church and even though they got kicked out amen it did not stop it hallelujah hallelujah and in this message we might have been kicked out of some things but it did not stop the truth from being revealed to us and you can't stop God when when God is in something there nothing nobody can do to stop it that's right amen we may be small in number but we're powerful amen when it comes to God and little as much when God is in it Hallelujah glory to God watch it now he says it says when Pentecost was first born the church was excommunicated too that didn't stop the message it goes on just the same Jesus can't be stopped my God who can stop God you can't do it no you can no more do it you you could easy to stop the son but you can't stop God his program is going to move on oh I like that brother I I I'm here to tell you when it comes to the gifts of the Spirit God's program is going to move on and there's nobody can stop stop it amen you can't preach this out of the church amen because it's part of the restoration go on let me go on so it come it it so it come when the churches back there was praying for a Revival it come in an unexpected way he got a bunch of some oneeyed colored man over here in California and William Seymour is this guy that amen that's crosseyed right brother random say he he got a bunch of one one eyy color man over here here in California and a couple of hobos on the street and things like that and filled them with the Holy Ghost and started a fire that look where it's gone to now Hallelujah he says it's the fastest growing Church in the world my God the Pentecostal Church well at that time was the fastest growing Church in the world they had more converts last year than all the rest of them put together yeah that's right our Sunday visitor the Catholic paper said so they reg registered a milion 500,000 what God's word sells on and on his people will never take down their soldiers amen cuz the word of the Living God is burning in their hearts that's right God is sending them things in different places blessing them bringing them on now let's keep our keep on our mind on the word and on God and keep moving on now you know brother Brand's just kind of giv us a slight little history here of the Pentecostal Church 1906 is is when uh a tremendous Revival broke out in California the soua Street Revival amen a a a mighty mighty Revival and and the way that this got started this gentleman brother brandom said he was uh uh uh C he was crossy he call him one out but he was cross out brother William Seymour is the name and uh William Seymour a man was uh very interested in in learning more about the gifts he was reading his Bible and this just kind of struck him about the gifts just being released in the church my God it it bothered him that he didn't see what he was reading in the Bible oh my can I can I just say it it should bother us that we don't see what was written in the Bible being manifested all the time in our midst come on church amen uh I mean this should this this should just be a normal thing and I I just have to be honest I feel like we done preached this so far out the church we don't see it no more I think I'm going to have to go to work too Amen Let me just get thank you my brother let me see I yeah I just feel like amen we done we done preached it so far out and and and let me let me just just you know I'm gonna I'm going to bring a a number of quotes Amen to make sure that we're very clear on this because I know that the fourth stage of the restoration is the word I know that's the fourth stage but we done jump to the fourth stage and we don't we don't even Hallelujah we don't even talk about the first second and third stage anymore but each stage was a part of the restoration and what we see in the fourth state should be all of it amen amen but but this man William Seymour amen he had a desire to see the gifts operating in the church and and again I think the thing that they went to seed on or the thing that that they they they concentrated the most on was the gift of tongues that was the gift that they concentrated on but there was there was eight other gifts and the gift of tongues was actually the the the the eighth of nine Hallelujah glory to God now now here William Seymour had this desire to see God Amen move in this manner because he saw it in the scripture on the day of Pentecost he saw these things and uh now him being a black man when uh back in those times 19 early 1900s there was a lot of segregation lot of segregation that happened amen not only in uh uh not just in the world but even in the church the prophet could not go to certain places amen they go to certain meetings and I mean you heard the brother preaching about it on on Wednesday night he going to Arkansas Hallelujah somebody oh my y'all going to make me get out there and start saying things I don't want to say but it's Spirits in other in in States and but but the Holy Ghost in you is bigger than that spirit all right amen but brother would go to Arkansas and they tell him you can't go over there and pray for that that young lady she she was a a a blind young girl she was black and said you can't you going to cross the racial lines if you go pray for that lady brother Brandon with the Holy Ghost he say I don't care nothing about these racial lines he say I feel the Holy Spirit leading me to her and he crossed the lines and he went over there and prayed for that girl and and and the faith that she had it touched the prophet she say I'm looking for my daddy would you help me find my daddy I just want to go in there and meet the healing man because if I get to the healing man I'll find my own daddy brother BR so you believe that said yes I believe it just get me to the healing man I heard somebody else got healed and I expecting myself to get healed that's why I'm here but help me find my Daddy sir says well you know what I I I I'm the one that pray for the sick you the healing man she say he say no I'm not the healing man Jesus is the healing man she grabbed him she got got a hold of the Prophet said I ain't letting you go she couldn't even see him I ain't letting you go Hallelujah I ain't never heard your voice I ain't never saw you one day in my life but you say you the Healer man you just pray for me right now and I find my own Daddy and with that type of Faith come on come on when brother Brandon prayed for she received a sight just like that Hall oh Hallelujah brother do you realize Pentecost released The Healing Ministry Pentecost did that I'm going read the quote for you in a little bit Pentecost released that brother brandom said that back back there you know the uh in many of us come from you know the Pentecostal ranks I I I might as well just be honest I I come from a a background my family background we we were Baptist on one side and Pentecost on the other side before we came to the message and and you know and I just remember amen the experience at the Pentecostal church was different from the experience at the Baptist Church Baptist Church anything was going on they had homosexuals leading the choir and and playing music in the church and playing them and and and and they drunkers I don't know what why they playing I mean all kind of spirits in in in the Baptist Church and and the Pentecostal Church you wasn't getting away with sin like that when we go there amen uh we we have to we was we was on the cleanup committee we didn't even go to the church but because we was related to somebody that went to the church our grandma went to the church we became part of the cleanup committee and every Saturday we go in that church and clean up you pick up picking up a snot rag here and picking up a snot rag there and picking this up and my God I them people you knew they had church I mean it was no dry eye nowhere in the church crying everywhere you had a little sin in your life they rush you to the altar pray that Spirit off of you hallu you might have come in one way but you you weren't going to leave the same way you came hello somebody if you your skirt was too short praise God they would put a a a Sheed over you huh that that was Holiness that was Pentecost yes sir but over over time they got away from the word the Holiness start going out they still trying to hold on to the gifts but they let the Holiness go but here we're trying to keep the Holiness we trying to keep we we keeping the word we keeping the gifts we keeping it all yes sir amen amenallah amen William Seymour desired to see God it's like I I want to see this and and um you know he heard about a man by the name of William parm that was teaching about the gifts of the Spirit and things like that he had a school that he was teaching it and William parm was saying you know yeah the tongue should be released the tongue should be released in the in the body and he had this school in Kansas that he was teaching but because of the secet ation uh William Seymour got invited to come to William parm school and when he gets there to parm school um I'm sorry Charles parm Charles Charles parm when he get there to Charles parm School uh they told him because of segregation we can't have you come inside the class but you have to sit on the outside and learn we're going to keep the door open while you learn on the outside now let me tell you something if the Holy Ghost can't stop that something wrong with the Holy Ghost yes the Holy Ghost a amen you know back in the scripture when when when when they went to the wedding they gave them all the same robe oh Hallelujah they gave them all the same Ro so there was no differences and the Holy Ghost it g it is pretty much the same spiritual robe that God has given us and it breaks down the Walls amen of race I'm talking about a true Holy Ghost that'll break down racial barriers EXA right and and I know that this message has produced that type of Holy Ghost cuz I've walked into situations where I'm the only black there but I felt so comfortable that's right brother amen because I knew my brothers had the same spirit that I had that's it come on somebody amen that's why I say you know we don't want to this this this church is a a church that's on the word we not we're not we're not making oursel a specific spe ific group no no no no no this just a church that believe the word amen hallelujah somebody oh I'm I might as well say these things because we try to make it something else this is a black church this is the white church this is a Spanish Church no this is a church that believes the word hallelujah and when you got the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll see it that way yes sir hello some somebody William C Mo 1906 gets get he's he's sitting there learning but you know what he wanted to learn the word he wanted he found out there was other people believing the same thing he was believing so he got invited he left the school out of Kansas got invited to go to a meeting in in uh in in in uh Los Angeles California and he gets there to Los Angeles and they invite him to preach and he start preaching about these gifts and start preaching about how he believes that the uh uh you know the true filling of the Holy Ghost will be accompanied with speaking in tongues and he took about two or three services and he preached that and you know what happened after he preached they rose up and said we're going to kick you out you're not welcome to preach here no more when brother brandom said they got excommunicated that's exactly what happened he got kicked out of the church because of what he was preaching but it did not stop this why brother random say it you can't stop God just because he got kicked out of the church didn't mean that it wasn't true can I say it in a different way just because people are kicking this out of the church don't mean that it's not true and don't mean that we're not supposed to have it amen oh my God here you know uh uh William Seymour said you know well they don't want us in the church so they start having little home meetings and they have prayer meetings in their home and and Milkman come by and this one come by and that one come by and they just praying praying praying and before you know it through their prayer meetings the Holy Spirit begin to move the people begin to speak in tongues and I mean and the gifts of the Spirit begin to manifest right there amongst it and brother brand said come in an unexpected way but here God just began to manifest himself amongst these people and and and it got so big that they had to leave the home they had up to 1,500 people coming the service every day good God Almighty they had three services a day seven days a week and and and and and and when they when they would come they say they didn't want to bring in song books don't bring a song book they wanted a fresh song to come right there while they were in service and God was giving people songs like that on the spot Hallelujah you talk about a move of God and now now now I I know that we in the time period now but it'll be it'll almost be uh impossible to have three services a day seven days a week y'all might as well say Amen if if if if I stood up and say we going to have three service a day seven days a week people get a frown on their face I mean you know that's why I say it's almost impos look at where we've come from in a 100 Years A little over 100 years look at where we come from look at where we are oh Hallelujah amen but they were willing to sacrifice I got some some testimonies that I want to read here you know for some people that was there amen um they had a a a a newsletter that they they published called the apostolic faith and Seymour was respons he says those who participated in the zusa Street Revival had this to say the audience was carried into Ecstasy of amens and Hallelujah the audience oh my not just one or two people amen the word but the entire audience carried amen into Ecstasy of amens and Hallelujah they said uh they said the emotion mounted Higher and Higher and the glory of God settled on auza street that was AG car say the fire fell and God Sanctified me that was the man's uh Testament say the fire fell and God Sanctified me so that's what's supposed to happen when the fire god comes down into the church amen it's not just to give you a good good uh Goosebumps and emotion but it's coming to sanctify you watch all the trash out of your life oh I Lord we need more of this father we believe you to be the same yesterday today and forever amen Let the Fire Fall he Jesus yes Lord Hallelujah it says it says the fire fell and God Sanctified me the power of God went through me like thousands of needles Florence Crawford said that the power of God descended upon me and I went down under [Music] it see back in those days people get slain in the spirit y'all I'm just talking about Pentecost right now but back in those days people come to church and you be slain in the spirit you be trying to hold yourself together and before you know you just out on the floor somewhere now I used to criticize that my God God I'm going be honest I used to criticize that and I asked a friend of mine and say where is that in the Bible where people get SL me say Well when Ezekiel got caught a vision Hallelujah when Ezekiel Saw a vision Ezekiel was slain in the spirit John also in the Book of Revelation slain in the spirit when he saw a vision Hallelujah so when I saw it in the word I sto criticizing it amen oh Jesus now I'm I'mma just be honest I I I I would love for God to come down in this place in such a way Brother people slain in the spirit speaking in tongues and my God interpretation of tongues hey I would love to see God do that especially under the right under right under the right inspiration of the word yes sir yes sir now I'm not trying to make it happen but I am telling you if it does happen we ain't going to chase it out of here the power God descended upon me and I went down under it I have no language to describe what took place but it was wonderful it seemed to me that my body had suddenly become porous and that a current of electricity was being turned on turned on me from all sides and for two hours I lay under his mighty power that was William H Durham he said someone might be speaking sudden the spirit will fall upon the congregation God himself would give the altar [Music] call men would fall all over the house like the slain in battle or Rush amen uh for the altar in Mass to seek God the scene often resemble a a a Forest of Fallen trees Frank bartleman they said these meetings continue with intensity intensity for about seven years can you mind go go imagine going to church and every time you went to church the power of God was just moving in the place huh these meetings continue with intensity for about seven years with hundreds of thousands having attended and missionaries been sent out many Pentecostal denominations they trace their Roots back to the soua Street Revival and many individual Pentecostals Trace their spiritual Roots back to the same but look at this unfortunately the emphasis on tongues as the only evidence of filling by the Holy Ghost is unbiblical and leads to error and excess now they they hit it spot on this is why Pentecost is not the stopping right right that's why we don't stop we go to the fullness of the word but in our going there we want to welcome what they have at Pentecost amen truth brother amen amen we want it all church that's for me I want it all not just part of I Want It All hallelujah hallelujah one of the other things that happened because of this this you know the the the uh this unbiblical doctrine of tongues being the only evidence of of of of the Holy Ghost that's that's that's unbiblical and and I'm going read the quote to you I'm going just share it right now I won't read it today but I share it in in future weeks tongues brother brandham helped us to see most of y'all that got shoes that that might tie or whatever sneakers your sneakers have tongues now if you only wore the tongues you wouldn't have a shoe right and see brother Brandon was a man with a seventh grade education that help us understand this you don't go to the store and say can I buy a pair of tongues no you want the whole shoe I want a heel I I I I I want the front front part of it I want the sides I I want the whole shoe to fit on this foot because just the tongues myself is not good enough see we want all the gifts of the Spirit not just the tongues by themselves and see the tongues got to come with an interpreter amen oh my you oh Hallelujah you know the Bible actually tell us that that that that that if a person speaks in tongues that they should pray that they also interpret yes now now what that what that is when the Holy Spirit is coming upon you let me just say these things let me let me just preach these things and be very plain when the Holy Spirit is coming upon you you feel yourself getting ready to speak in tongues it's at that moment you got to say Lord and I I I feel you but if there's not an interpreter here I'm not supposed to say this so if there's no interpreter if you got to anoint me to speak in tongues then you got have to also anoint me to to interpret this because I don't want to be out of my place Hallelujah somebody Lord you got to give interpretation of this father because this is what your word say now I'm going to do my part but you going to have to do your part father yes sir either anoint me to be able to interpret it or anoint somebody else in here sir am let me go on let me go on I'll tell you the truth this is you know I I feel I feel that this this season of restoration we're going to see some things and and and for my young people that ain't never experienced nothing like this in your life I don't want you to be afraid there is not nothing to drive fear you know I according to Joel We read it in verse 28 Joel uh 2:28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit y'all better look at it now for my young people ain't never experienced nothing like this I just need you to let this ain't this ain't brother Jack I'm telling you what God Said in his word I will pour out my spirit this ain't brother Jack's spirit this is God's spirit I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh everybody going to get to experience this he says and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy I I've seen that happen right here in our church I I I I've seen my daughter amen rise up the anointing was so great my own daughter rose up and start prophesying to her sister right there in the seats MH I've seen it sir right but your your your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions God going to move amongst everybody the old men the old women the young men the young women everybody going to have part of this we're preaching it into the church hallu it's been preached out of the church but now I'm preaching it into the church and I know where I stand on the word now and I know this is part of the restoration cuz now some might see this tape and not watch the rest of the series but I'm coming to the word don't worry I'm going to get there yes sir Hallelujah you already know brother brandom said that when they when they when they um when when when the fire fell on the on the soua street they thought that was a long restoration but it wasn't the restoration because the word hadn't come yet they had they needed both for marine and L ring we got them both now with them both what are we going to do with it amen come on let me read let me read a little bit more I'm I'm trying to get here here uh out of the message hear ye him brother random says the Lutheran said the just shall live by faith if you just believe it you got it no that's different it says Paul in Acts 19 said to the to those people have you received the Holy Ghost sent you have believ so that lets lets that out the method is you got it when you shout see and that's not we're not looking just for emotions we talking something to change your life from the inside brother brother brother Jerry said I shall be changed the Holy Spirit Come here to change lives change it from the inside out yes sir my God some of us changeed just enough you know I don't want brother Jack to see me like that who am I I got no heaven or no hell to put you in none amen I am going to preach truth to you and and and and and let me tell you if I do see you dressed a certain way and you're not supposed to be dressed the way if I say something to you then that I got a right to say it to you you know why because you ain't listening to God God the one that was telling you not to do it so then he have to let somebody come and rebuke you is a truth in high why don't you heed the voice of the spirit he then you don't have to go through that with the pastor all right church I'm just doing this cuz I don't want brother Jack no no no no no don't do it because of that do it because it's the right thing to do have you seen the Holy Ghost sensu believe so that let out Methodist said you got it when you shout that is your early Methodist when you shout you got it and they found out many shouted who didn't have it same thing in Pentecost we found out many people spoke in tongues and they was it was devils speaking in tongues yes sir amen Devils they a have no life behind what they was doing none was brother Brandon told us that they went there amongst them Pentecostals and they was having a meeting in the north because they couldn't because of racial uh uh boundaries they they couldn't meet in the South so they had to go up north where the boundaries were not there and when brother Brandon goes there and he say he see this man come in two men every service one Speaking tongues one interpret say I ain't never seen nothing like this not in my Baptist Church he said want more this so let me go talk to these guys went talk to one of them and he say he said man that guy had the best spirit that he like he just attracted to that spirit said well let me go talk to the other guy say oh Lord got to talking to him this man is doing all these gifts and uh he's married with a wife that he had left now he living with a woman that's not his wife and he got kids by the lead that's not his wife and yet he got a gift see that's why see every everything ain't going to go forth here you might have a gift but if you can't live right your gift ain't going forth here that's right amen and then you get so you get so concerned that you you're not concerned about your life you're only concerned about your gift I'm concerned about your life yes sir amen hey your life got to be first your life goes above your gift before you play you got to have a life before you sing you got to have a life before you preach you got to have a life life amen amen he brother brand say say this guy doing he say he say you know what um I I don't want nothing to do with this this the devil this the devil if this man living like this and producing that this the devil I don't want nothing to do with it walked away and then God God took him out to the to the to to a cave and as he's there on in the cave the Holy Spirit oh I just love God the Holy Spirit picked up his Bible with a wind Hallelujah the wind came and took the Bible opened it imagine your Bible closed like this and a strong wind come hallelujah oh my you see the wind just God well the thing of it is is that it just didn't happen no one time he closed the Bible again and the wind comes again and opens the Bible my God God sir and not just open the Bible the the wind opens the Bible to the exact same scripture I believe it happened three times and when when when he when when the wind opened the Bible he start reading and this was out of uh this was Hebrews Lord I I I I'm I'm way out of my notes this not in my not notes I I know it's Hebrews um it might be Hebrews 6 let me just let me let me Lord this was not in my notes let me see where I'm at right now I believe it was yeah I think it was Hebrews 6 amen that that uh and and now see I'm it's it's got me over here Lord have mercy it's hard to read these things and not say nothing go go to verse one Hebrews 6 and I believe this is right and and y'all if I'm wrong I'm sorry I don't mean to be wrong it's just kind of coming to me but I remember the the wind opening the Bible for the prophet while he was there and the Holy Spirit opened it right to this chapter in Hebrews and I believe it's this therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of the Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of the of God and the powers of the world to come now this I say that I say that because we got many that walked away but uh-uh no no no the scripture says impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again into repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God AR fresh and put him to an open shame and this is the verse I believe that was he was pointing out for the Earth which drinketh in the ring that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beare thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned now what brother Brandon was seeing there is that the the rain was going to fall on the just and the unjust the Holy Spirit begin to reveal that so there was one man that was just but there was another man unjust Hallelujah but you know what God does the separating you don't have to worry about that unjust person and and get so you know cuz cuz people see the unjust person and then they start didn't start criticizing Christianity you looking at one unjust person and the rain going to fall on the just and the unjust brother brandom learned that through that scripture the Holy Spirit opened it up multiple times to the same scripture and when he saw that he said okay I see I see what's going on and this why I'm telling you you don't want to be a unjust one manifesting in the gifts y your end is to be burned what you want to be is just a Sanctified life letting the gifts manifest through you but knowing that you clean before God I I I don't I I I done seeing I don't seen uh people possessed with demons reveal secrets of people that's supposed to been preachers walk into the office to come cast the spirit out amen and the demon looked at him you can't cast no demon out of me you can't cast me out so you watch too much TV demon told him that you watch too much TV you can't cast me out pretty much laughed at him Lord sent him out the office in shame a preacher my God lord you watch too much TV you can't and when you start dealing with demons like that you better make sure God you better make sure your life is right with God yes sir amen what would a demon reveal about you you come here to pray you you you know what you did last night let me demons can tell you things like that that's right because the demons was there with you when you did [Music] it y'all ain't going to let me preach but I I'm telling you if we got to have a clean church sanctified group of people yes that way God can move when he wants to move amongst his people oh yes Lord amen let me let me let me let me go back and read a little bit more here now yeah I got to finish this quote I didn't so the Methodist said you got it when you shout that is your early Methodist when you shout you got it they found out many shout it who didn't have it and the Pentecost come along or the restoration of gifts and said when you speak with tongues you got it but they found out many spoke with tongues who didn't have it it says those things are all right but you can never major on a minor now I had to make sure I put that in here because brother Brandon said you can never major on a minor and I know there's so many people take that quote say see that's why we don't really talk about the gifts because you can never major on a minor well you wouldn't talk about Divine Healing either y'all know that sir cuz Divine Healing you came major on a minor amen but look for me I want everything that God had in the scripture I want it all I want Divine Healing I want justification I want sanctification I want the word I want the gifts I Want It All yes sir amen let me go on a little further it says they found out it says uh you can never make on mind that's an attribute of know the Holy Spirit that's right any of those emotions which he says which I believe in every one of them but that's not it yet the Holy Spirit when you receive it is the person of the Lord Jesus dwelling in you and Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them the fruit that their branches Bears tells uh tells what Vine it's in all right I'm going on I want to read from Ephesian Church age couple more quotes here Lord I I got a lot here in my my bag this morning and I'm just trying to get as much out as I can but I know I'll be back we'll find a stopping point soon here in Ephesian Church AG brother Brandon says this how we long for the day when the Crooked roads will be straightened and and I bring this in because we we've had so much confusion in our in in in our message ranks I mean it if people bust out speaking in tongues in some Churches boy I think people just I mean they they they ain't heard a nobody speaking tongues in so long and and we and and if you listen to tapes if you listen to tapes there's tongue speaking in brother Brandon's church now I'm going read a quote for y'all and and and you know not this week but I'mma just I'm I'm getting ahead of myself I'm I'mma read the quote but I might as well tell you brother brandom had a sister in his church he had come to the pull pit and he opened his Bible and he read the scripture and as soon as he read the scripture sister raised up and she started speaking in tongues now here's another thing that we learned through our Prophet that when somebody speaks in tongues you know what the rest of us do we be quiet you don't say nothing you don't move can I can I just say this while we're here young people that's not the time to go to the bathroom when you hear some a tongue go out like that you don't move at all you hold it sir and you just stand still and what we do is we wait on God to give the interpretation so this sister spoke in tongues and uh right after brother Brandon read the scripture and uh so brother Brandon just got silent the whole church knew just to be silent just to wait well he waited for just a a minute or so and he says no interpretation came so he just began to pray and when he prayed he said sis he says um I I know that was God in you you know that that that just causing you to speak like that I know that was God he says the only thing is is that uh the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets and it was just the wrong time that he say the reason it the wrong time that's why no no no uh interpretation came because you actually released it at the wrong time and he said sis when the when this when when I finish my sermon if the Spirit come back upon you I I guar guarantee that's the quote I'mma read it for you I guarantee that there will be an interpretation because it's coming at the right time Hallelujah my God hallelujah was that a prophet rejecting the gifts or was that a prophet just trying to get the church in order so the gifts could go forward amen amen he says I guarantee so so what happens that it's it's at the end of service at the end of service he welcome that after the word is gone forth now not during his altar call if you see the spirit is leading towards the alter call don't hold it hold it hold it see this not a competition to see who can get the gift out first oh come on church that's not a competition can I can I can I can I can I can I just share something with y'all sometime people that are gifted want to dominate the church I'm I'mma just say it I'mma say the truth now they want to dominate the church and if their gift is not accepted they leave they feel led to leave if their gift is not accepted or if the pastor trying to put it in order we welcome the gifts but they must be in order and that's why we have Deacons say to help us keep things in order now if you get upset and leave a church because your gift wasn't accepted something wrong with [Music] you they didn't want to hear me yeah there's a reason people didn't want to hear you CU they knew what was in you wasn't right look at what's manifesting out of you right now look I've Been Around Church a long time and I done seen it happen over and over again gifted people never willing to subject their gifts to the to the word yeah like brother Brandon ran into it y'all y'all come on y'all y'all y'all y'all remember the pastor that told told Brother brandom um brother brand had rebuked his his his member she was fixing up her stockings getting ready for a prophecy and she did it at the same time every service and not brother Brandon he wasn't the only one notic that even his son said that lady back here again that sister back here again and I mean everybody watch her watch her watch her only people empowering her is her pastor and the people in her church and they come out there and brother Brandon trying to have alter call and she take off come outside I want to see you brother Brandon Let It Go the first time second night here she come again you know with a tongue third night brother B Billy Paul said that she back again Daddy said okay I'm got I got something for her tonight she took off in her tongue took off and she had fixed up her stockings fixed up everything before she now why you fixing up everything before you when the Holy Spirit come to you you ain't even worried about none of that but but she she just I'm going to release this I I got a word I'mma release it oh Lord have mercy Jesus he said um okay she stood up brother R sit down sir she looked he said I said sit down yes can't be talking to me I got a word from the Lord sit down with your word from the Lord she was so embarrassed you can probably see a face turn red and like oh my can't believe this man embarrassed me like this who does he think he is then her pastor had to go stand up for her yes brother Brandon you was wrong you telling a prophet that he wrong and you know what brother brandom didn't use no gift on him you know how brother brandom corrected this brother with the word he said brother I'm not wrong she wrong he said no no no God God was finished speaking through you it was time to speak through her now he say he say brother look the Bible say the spirit of the prophets got to be subject to the prophets and I'm in the pull pit getting ready to have a a altar call and she interrupts the altar call three nights in a row say she wrong they left there probably never came back to any more meetings but see anytime you have a person with a gift that cannot bring the gift into subjection of the word then you know there's something wrong with the gift and remember this remember this remember this gifts and callings are without repentance so there's people that can have a gift and really not subject subject to the word am you just can't get moved by somebody's gift make sure the gift is in line with the word that's why you have a pastor to help keep things in line with the word yes sir [Music] amen amen I know what I'm saying here this morning truth I I'm I'm I'm I'm not nowhere where I want to be but I'm I'm PL planting some seeds and and see as I plant the seeds I got to do it balanced cuz we not going to have a church that's just moving all in the gifts and ain't no word hello amen and then we're not going to have a church going to have all the word what's the name of your church and Truth we want spirit and truth cuz that's the father seeking for those to worship Him in spirit and in truth I'm an Ephesian Church age I'm reading the prophet says how we long for that day when the Crooked roads will be straight will all be straightened and we will be with him time without end May that they hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory he that hath an ear to hear what the spirit saith un the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank God I like this thank God in the last age there will be a group RIS up Hallelujah the true Bride of the last day she will listen to the spirit and watch this in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word now when the light comes by the pure word guess what happens and we will we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now this is a thus sayeth the Lord From The Prophet we will return to the power of Pentecost but we're going to do that through amen the return of the pure word woo lord lord lord I believe we got it lined up just right let me um let me I there was one little part here I was trying to get to but I I I'm not going to get there today I'm not I'm not I can save it I can save it oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord there there's there this is just this just full of vitamins that's all I can say y'all uh this is just full of vitamins let me um I I think I'm going to skip down to one other quot and maybe I'll just bring it I I'll leave it here God provided healing for this generation God provided healing for this generation we'll read this and amen and um I I'll just I'll just cut it off amen I was I had to subject just in my notes and I had I had a a sermon that I had developed like months ago you know because I'm been a guest Minister that's what they call me a guest Minister um I forgot I prepared the sermon so I rep prepared a whole sermon yesterday for you all but I had whole another summon on this subject from months ago so that means I got a lot a material and I'mma preach them all I'mma preach them all but I I I sometimes you got to plow a little bit in order to get the seed into the ground and and I was saying to the young people early I don't want y'all to be afraid when you hear somebody speaking tongues and you just you know don't freeze up don't don't don't don't be afraid like what I walked into no that that's that's very normal it's supposed to be a normal behavior in the church a very normal behavior you know and there's been times where the Holy Spirit comeing here and you can just feel the power Rising I know that there's people here that's actually been afraid to let the interpretation go God has given them the interpretation and they're afraid to say anything I don't want to be the one that say it no no no no if God has given it to you you be the one that say it yes sir cuz everybody don't have that gift come on we all gifted differently right I don't play piano so don't put me over there and talk about let's let's have church brother Jack would mess the service up I'm telling you I'll mess it up I I barely barely I mean I can barely keep a beat on the drums barely so don't put me on the drums don't put me on the violin I can sing though give me the mic if you want somebody to sing I'll sing but don't put me in in places where we know the service going to get all messed up know what your gift is and operate in that amen and some of y'all are gifted with the interpretation of tongues I I had something that I was going to read I'm going just say this before I get there because I I ain't got time to read it when we talk about the interpretation of tongues I I want to I want I want to see God I don't want to limit God but I want to see God do it in such a way like they did it in the book of Acts in the book of Acts every man understood in their own language amen amen I got some that understand Africans I got some in here that understand shonah I got some that understand twe some that understand Creole some that understand Spanish and you know you can be speaking in English and then somebody understand it in their native language brother brother Nathan um at his church few years years ago there was a brother he prayed earnestly like brother Lord I go to church I just want to be in church but I can't understand nothing they saying Lord please God help me to understand what he said just help me understand what the preacher saying the brother came to church that day didn't understand anything in the song service but when the preacher stepped forward to preach all of a sudden he stood to his feet the whole service because he heard brother Nathan preaching in English but he was hearing in his native language and he was sitting there rejoicing look God he's the same yesterday today and forever this is what we're looking for God to do in our midst Hallelujah and and I'm talking about a God that just don't do this one time he can do it every time we come together oh Hallelujah let me just let me read this and I'm I'm I'm closing God providing healing for this generation the devil put us in the pawn shop but Jesus redeemed us he's our kinsman redeemer God made flesh kin folks to us in order to redeem us from the course and from the curse of sin and sickness and tonight has sent the Holy Spirit to dwell with the church and show signs and wonders of healing and salvation until he returns again how long was it to last go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature go ye into all the world and demonstrate the power to Every Creature these signs shall follow them that believe how far to all the world and when this gospel is gone to all the world then I will return these signs shall follow them to all the world in my name they shall cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues they take up serpents or drink deadly things it would not harm them and if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover Jesus said that would be the same sign he says just like Moses lifted the brass serpent it was a sign that God was in the camp when the waters was pouring from The Rock and their rock is not like our Rock when the waters was pouring from the rock it was a sign that God was in the camp when the troubled water on the pool of Bethesda it was a sign that God was in the camp when Jesus healed the sick and made the lame to walk and and the blind to seea God was in the camp when Peter and John passed through the gate called Beautiful lifted up the man that been crippled from his mother's womb it was a sign that God was in the camp when the Holy Ghost returned on Pentecost and endued that bunch of people with power it was a sign that God was in the camp so young people don't be afraid when you see God coming to the camp some of the older Saints may have learned how to just uh release themselves underneath that anointing so God could use them for tongues and interpretation of tongues God can use them but you young people if you would just learn to just Release Yourself In God's anointing when he comes cuz I'm telling you he's coming he's coming you're going to see some things you're going to hear some things this what brother Jack was talk no not just what what what brother Jack was talking about this is what Joel was talking about so when you see it don't get don't get alarmed remember one time we had we had tongues and we had interpretation you know y'all yall remember we're still holding on to that one open your mouth wide that anointing was so strong in church that day brother Troy had to close out the service he looked like you want me to close out after that and y'all remember on that day brother Caleb was in church oh yes and he was just crying out oh God oh God I'm telling you when the anointing come it'll just make you do things amen I remember brother Nehemiah I mean the chair still wearing a scar brother Nehemiah just snotting up something underneath that anointing God comes and does things for people that's why we looking for this we we expecting this in the church no we we're not we're not pushing this and preaching this out no we welcome this we welcome the spirit of God to have preeminence amongst his people amen we just want Sanctified lives that's oh my don't get afraid you just learn to yield yourself to whatever God wants to do my God y'all see y'all going to see we're going to see we're going to see but we just got to plant the seed and we know if we plant the right seed when it Waters we know what to what's going to come forth and ain't going to be a church out of order don't worry about it and and let me put it this way I ain't looking for just one person in a church to have this you know what happened on the day of Pentecost you know what the Bible said they were all in one Accord they were all in one mind and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and spake with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance you know the spirit giving utterance I I've been in a situation like that we went to pray for my bath me and brother Troy and brother Smiley and musicians y'all come on I'm leaving I'm leaving uh brother quu we went out there to pray for my Bev and while we sitting there praying brother smile just I'm like brother you all right man you okay bro he just he just kept getting quickened oh I said brother you brother and before you know it while we praying tongues just start flowing out of brother Smiley's mouth it got to spot where he could not control it when he was doing all that he was trying to hold it in but I'mma tell you it get to bubbling so good yes sir no matter how hard you try to hold it in it's coming out I'm looking for us to lose control one day God bless your [Applause] church let's have a word of Prayer father you
