[3:24] amen your confession has to change about
[3:26] yourself
[3:27] amen you're no longer sinners you're
[3:29] saints
[3:30] amen you're not children of the world
[3:32] you're children of god
[3:34] amen

[3:37] the queen of heaven upon the earth
[3:40] amen god bless you amen let's turn to
[3:42] song not psalms but
[3:44] ecclesiastes chapter 12.
[3:54] amen i like to read
[3:57] verses 1
[3:59] through eight then we'll jump down to
[4:01] thirteen
[4:11] amen scripture reads
[4:14] remember now thy creator in the days of
[4:17] thy youth
[4:19] while the evil days come not nor the
[4:21] years draw nigh when thou shalt say
[4:23] i have no pleasure in them
[4:26] while the sun or the light or the moon
[4:28] or the stars be not darkened
[4:31] nor the clouds return after rain
[4:34] amen look like he's losing his eyesight
[4:37] in the day when the keepers of the house
[4:39] shall tremble tremble
[4:41] and the strong men shall bow down
[4:42] themselves and the grinders cease
[4:45] because they are few
[4:46] and those that look out the windows be
[4:48] dark
[4:50] so not only is he blind he's losing his
[4:52] teeth
[4:54] adria said man
[4:57] amen and the door shall be shut in the
[5:00] streets when the sound of the grinding
[5:02] is low and he shall rise up and the
[5:04] voice of the bird and all the daughters
[5:06] of music shall be brought low
[5:09] now he's losing his hearing
[5:13] also when they shall be afraid
[5:17] of that which is high and the fear shall
[5:20] be in the way
[5:21] and the almond tree shall flourish and
[5:22] the grasshopper shall be a burden and
[5:25] the desire shall fail because man goes
[5:27] to his long home and the mourners come
[5:30] about the streets
[5:32] forever or ever the silver cord be
[5:35] loosed or the golden bowl be broken or
[5:37] the picture be broken at the fountain
[5:40] then shall the dust return to the earth
[5:42] as it was and the spirit shall return to
[5:44] unto god who gave it
[5:47] vanity of vanity saith the preacher
[5:49] all is vanity
[5:51] in verse 13

[5:55] conclusion of the whole matter

[48:13] call we were in prayer and i got this my
[48:16] phone started ringing while i'm praying
[48:17] like my
[48:18] people know i'm praying

[48:31] i said what did he say last night we
[48:33] left the fellowship with the couples and
[48:35] we got an accident on our way home
[48:38] he said i think i hit like a
[48:41] a wolf or something
[48:43] i said i said i said why i said hit my
[48:46] car and i just all kind of damaged and i
[48:49] made it home and i said i come on this
[48:50] morning but as i got to indian town
[48:52] again it just seemed like the car wasn't
[48:55] acting right
[48:56] they say so i'm gonna have to turn
[48:57] around and go back and then he texts me
[49:00] back and say
[49:01] i'm gonna be late but i'm gonna be there
[49:03] say so we just expect them to come at
[49:05] any any moment now and we we thank god
[49:08] for just the press
[49:10] amen the saints pressing through
[49:13] um
[49:15] the circumstances
[49:16] and as
[49:18] we were teaching amen out of the book of
[49:20] ephesians you got to be able to live
[49:21] above your circumstances and man don't
[49:24] allow the enemy to get victory in some
[49:26] of these areas in your life so i thank
[49:27] god for the press and i believe there's
[49:29] a blessing in pressing amen so we want
[49:32] to remember
[49:34] these things in prayer uh i will
[49:39] read a scripture here amen and we'll get
[49:42] into the word of god musicians thank you
[49:44] all so much we really really appreciate
[49:46] you all amen god bless you uh amen
[49:52] and uh certainly thank the lord for uh
[49:55] all the specials that went for so if you
[49:57] could just stand with me we'll read two
[49:59] passages of scripture amen and then we
[50:02] will move on
[50:04] in our thought here for today
[50:06] i want to read from the book of job
[50:08] chapter 9
[50:11] my brother solomon
[50:12] was
[50:13] reading out of ecclesiastes and i think
[50:15] he started quoting a little bit out of
[50:17] job and while he was praying there i'm
[50:19] like lord look at that confirmation amen
[50:22] coming right through the song service
[50:24] there so appreciate that
[50:26] this this little thought that i'm gonna
[50:28] have
[50:29] i'm i'm i'm gonna say it like this i'm
[50:32] kind of stepping in some uh
[50:35] uncharted territory
[50:37] uh but i heard brother eugene braun
[50:39] earlier this week just kind of shared a
[50:41] little something it was strange i wasn't
[50:43] even on the call but brother clinton's
[50:46] brother a man called me says did you
[50:48] hear
[50:49] uh them talk about this on something i'm
[50:50] like no i want them to call i didn't
[50:52] hear so i went back and listened to the
[50:53] recording and they said that that that
[50:55] word that word that he spoke that just
[50:57] really got me stirred up i said well let
[50:59] me go look at this word
[51:01] and when i looked at that word i said
[51:03] yeah that got me stirred up too brother
[51:05] and uh so the lord just kind of led us
[51:07] down a certain path and and uh but this
[51:10] thought is is driven from something that
[51:12] brother eugene braun was bringing to our
[51:14] attention on our early morning call uh
[51:17] there starting studying the book of
[51:19] revelation so here
[51:20] um this is job chapter 9 verse 1 says
[51:23] then job answered
[51:26] and said
[51:27] i know it
[51:29] is so of a truth
[51:31] but how should man be just with god
[51:35] if he will contend with him
[51:38] he cannot answer him
[51:40] one of a thousand
[51:42] he is wise in heart
[51:44] and mighty in strength
[51:47] who hath hardened himself against him
[51:48] and have prospered
[51:50] who hath hardened himself against him
[51:52] and have prospered
[51:54] right yeah
[51:56] that's impossible you don't harden
[51:58] yourself against god and think you're
[52:00] going to prosper
[52:01] right who would hurt yourself against
[52:03] him and hath prospered
[52:05] which removeth the mountains
[52:07] and they know not
[52:09] which overturneth them in his anger
[52:12] uh which shaketh the earth out of her
[52:14] place and the pillars thereof tremble
[52:18] which commandeth the sun and it riseth
[52:20] not
[52:23] um
[52:27] rises not and seals up the stars
[52:29] which alone spreadeth out the heavens
[52:32] and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
[52:36] which maketh
[52:38] arcturus
[52:40] orion
[52:43] pleiades
[52:46] and the chambers of the south
[52:48] amen
[52:50] which doeth great things past finding
[52:52] out yay and wonders
[52:54] without number amen turn with me to
[52:57] revelation
[52:58] 8. and verse
[53:01] 1
[53:03] praise the lord
[53:06] revelation 8 and verse 1
[53:09] and it says
[53:11] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[53:15] there was silence in heaven about the
[53:17] space of half
[53:19] an hour
[53:20] amen let's pray
[53:23] lord jesus we are
[53:26] grateful
[53:27] for the
[53:29] uh privilege we have to be able to read
[53:31] the word of god
[53:33] but we know it takes the holy spirit to
[53:35] reveal to us what it is that we've
[53:38] actually read
[53:40] we pray that the spirit of god would
[53:41] come now
[53:42] lord and just open up our understanding
[53:45] and well not that it would just be head
[53:47] knowledge but lord it be something that
[53:49] would draw our hearts closer

[57:14] here and yet they tell us
[57:16] that they look through glasses

[57:22] years of light time
[57:24] way out in there and they're still moons
[57:27] and stars

[57:32] and he sets in the midst of them now
[57:35] watch this he says

[57:49] coming over through the cancer age and
[57:52] on down

[58:16] it says but yet is
[58:18] there oh my i just love this i love this
[58:22] amen uh it it it will just go further
[58:25] than this but he said he says i tried
[58:27] like looking in the observatory he said
[58:28] they look up at them stars and they're
[58:30] trying to look at the zodiac amen and he
[58:33] says
[58:34] he tried to see it but he just couldn't
[58:36] this is what the prophet said he says he
[58:38] says i tried to see it but i can't see
[58:40] it but yet it's there
[58:43] and it says those who are trained
[58:47] know it's

[59:52] those who are trained they know it's
[59:55] there
[59:56] job sign all right now let me uh pick up
[59:58] another little thought here
[1:00:00] out of the evening messenger amen
[1:00:04] praise the lord
[1:00:05] hallelujah uh amen so
[1:00:09] here uh in this quote it says
[1:00:13] that's the messenger of the last days
[1:00:16] the evening light
[1:00:18] is first find that church
[1:00:21] where they will believe the message
[1:00:25] find that church hunt it
[1:00:27] find that church where they will believe
[1:00:29] the message hunted can you read what i'm
[1:00:31] talking about
[1:00:32] hunt where that church is
[1:00:35] that'll even let you come in that won't
[1:00:38] close the door in your face amen and
[1:00:40] then when you do do there then you found
[1:00:44] character now if she will stand still
[1:00:47] long enough to tell her how the bride's
[1:00:49] got to be dressed she's got to be
[1:00:52] clothed stand still
[1:00:54] see if if she could get it oh my now
[1:00:57] watch this it goes on he says look at
[1:00:59] little rebecca
[1:01:01] listening to every word
[1:01:03] her little heart was beating uh he was
[1:01:06] telling her now you sweated it out where
[1:01:08] will i go until i find the character now
[1:01:12] uh you know he's just kind of jumping
[1:01:15] into a story here and i'm kind of
[1:01:16] catching this quote midstream but um uh
[1:01:20] you know abraham's faithful servant uh
[1:01:23] went down there to find a wife for isaac
[1:01:26] and as he was there you know going to
[1:01:29] find a wife he said a prayer is like
[1:01:31] lord
[1:01:32] let the young lady that comes and not
[1:01:35] just offer me water but the one that
[1:01:37] will offer my camel's water as well let
[1:01:40] that be the one that's supposed to be
[1:01:42] the wife amen to isaac and uh and after
[1:01:45] he prayed you know after he said amen
[1:01:47] just prayer here comes rebecca amen
[1:01:50] walking up to the well and she says hey
[1:01:52] here you know let me get you some water
[1:01:54] but also let me offer some water to your
[1:01:56] camels and this was not a light job amen
[1:02:00] this was not just a cup of water amen
[1:02:03] this was gallons and gallons of water i
[1:02:05] believe he had 10 camels and and i
[1:02:08] forget what the numbers are but those
[1:02:09] camels drink gallons of water and if i
[1:02:11] recall correctly she had to go and get
[1:02:14] 200 gallons of water amen in order to
[1:02:17] give that to amen these camels
[1:02:19] hallelujah it showed that she was a
[1:02:21] woman that was not afraid to work
[1:02:25] oh come on somebody
[1:02:27] amen she wasn't afraid to work right now
[1:02:30] now there are there are times we
[1:02:31] understand in life where maybe the wife
[1:02:34] might not work amen she's there raising
[1:02:37] the kids and we understand that but then
[1:02:39] there's other times in life but you know
[1:02:40] what uh it may be necessary for her to
[1:02:43] go to work
[1:02:45] glory to god and we got to find a
[1:02:47] balance and all of that but but here
[1:02:49] rebecca showed a man in her character
[1:02:51] that she was not afraid to work
[1:02:54] hallelujah glory to god but here so
[1:02:57] let's kind of pick this thought up uh
[1:02:59] you know as he's going it says until i
[1:03:01] find character then when i find the
[1:03:04] character then make us stand still long
[1:03:06] enough to get her ready to go to meet
[1:03:08] him oh my what a striking thing
[1:03:12] wish we had a little more time on that
[1:03:15] ready to go meet him says get her ready
[1:03:18] stand still
[1:03:19] to listen to his message of him eliezer
[1:03:22] wasn't speaking of himself but he was
[1:03:25] speaking of the one he was sent from and
[1:03:28] he had the gifts to prove that he was
[1:03:30] sent from him amen he went he wanted to
[1:03:33] clothe her with these things glory to
[1:03:35] god you know how he fixed her up if i
[1:03:39] could just get her to wash a face
[1:03:42] glory amen he said i just felt checked
[1:03:44] on that so i better keep still anyhow i
[1:03:47] said enough you know what i'm talking
[1:03:48] about now listen just stand still now
[1:03:50] look at this he goes and says notice the
[1:03:52] end time messenger his job will be to
[1:03:55] get the saints ready the bride ready for
[1:03:58] the bridegroom that will be his message
[1:04:02] now you want to learn abc's so you can
[1:04:04] study algebra later when those other
[1:04:07] seals on the back is open they'll only
[1:04:11] be revealed
[1:04:12] to them
[1:04:14] now watch this amen when those when
[1:04:16] these other seals
[1:04:18] on the back is open they'll only be
[1:04:21] revealed to themselves talk about the
[1:04:22] seals that are in the scripture
[1:04:25] okay the seven seals will only be
[1:04:27] revealed to the bride
[1:04:28] other people will have the same bible
[1:04:30] that you have and not understand the
[1:04:33] things that you understand amen it will
[1:04:35] only be revealed to
[1:04:39] all them stay with me glory glory glory
[1:04:43] i love to say this amen i said it this
[1:04:45] morning i was teaching i said this
[1:04:47] message that we believe is not an
[1:04:49] alternative
[1:04:51] to another denominational church
[1:04:54] amen this is not just an alternative
[1:04:56] that's not what god sent the message for
[1:04:58] amen this message was to bring us back
[1:05:01] to truth
[1:05:02] this message was to bring us back amen
[1:05:05] to amen the uh what god was looking for
[1:05:08] out of his word uh when jesus had the
[1:05:10] conversation with the woman at the well
[1:05:12] he says he says uh the lord god is
[1:05:15] seeking for those that will worship him
[1:05:18] in spirit and in truth
[1:05:20] hallelujah and we finally come to a spot
[1:05:23] because we receive the revelation of the
[1:05:25] truth we can truly worship god in that
[1:05:28] place not the name of a church but
[1:05:30] there's a special place that you can
[1:05:33] come to in god
[1:05:35] where you are worshiping him in spirit
[1:05:37] and in truth
[1:05:40] hallelujah not just the name of a church
[1:05:42] but a special place in god now which he
[1:05:45] says this it says
[1:05:47] when these other seals on the back is
[1:05:49] open they'll only be revealed to them
[1:05:52] that's right learn abc first what does
[1:05:54] abc always believe christ not to creed
[1:05:57] amen christ see believe what he says not
[1:06:01] what somebody else says if it's contrary
[1:06:04] look at this if a man tells you it's all
[1:06:07] right for you to cut your hair women you
[1:06:09] know he's lying
[1:06:11] amen the bible says it's wrong if he
[1:06:13] says you can be a deacon and still have
[1:06:15] four or five wives he's lying amen
[1:06:18] that's contrary to the word see all
[1:06:20] these other things that we speak of call
[1:06:23] it to the word and see if it's the word
[1:06:27] right
[1:06:28] all right all right so you know as he
[1:06:30] was saying this
[1:06:31] those other seals on the back of the
[1:06:33] book open they'll only be revealed to
[1:06:34] them
[1:06:36] uh i wanted to just make a statement
[1:06:39] uh there are things that only the bride
[1:06:42] will know and others will never know
[1:06:46] let me say it again there are things
[1:06:48] that only the bride will know that
[1:06:50] others will never know
[1:06:53] the bride
[1:06:55] will be able to put
[1:06:57] a man this mysterious scripture puzzle
[1:07:00] back together
[1:07:03] i want to say it again the bride will be
[1:07:06] able to put this mysterious scripture
[1:07:08] puzzle back together amen she will
[1:07:12] understand serpency
[1:07:15] it won't be a mystery to her it'll be
[1:07:18] the truth to her
[1:07:20] amen what really happened in the garden
[1:07:22] of eden she i mean when she hears it
[1:07:24] because she was told praise god that
[1:07:27] they they ate an apple
[1:07:30] she was told that they ate an apricot
[1:07:32] and when she was told that in sunday
[1:07:35] school i mean just getting out of the
[1:07:37] gate in genesis when she was told that
[1:07:39] it never registered with her
[1:07:42] she could never agree with that
[1:07:44] statement an apple caused all of this
[1:07:48] a apple calls every funeral a apple
[1:07:52] praise god amen calls every visit to the
[1:07:55] hospital
[1:07:56] and apple calls every sickness i apple
[1:07:59] caused every pain an apple did this
[1:08:03] it did not make sense to her but when
[1:08:05] she was told that no adultery
[1:08:08] took place in the garden of heat she
[1:08:11] said hey
[1:08:12] wait a minute
[1:08:15] now that sounds like something no no no
[1:08:17] no no what you say
[1:08:19] and then she start tracing that thing
[1:08:21] because you look in genesis you see
[1:08:22] these two different lineages
[1:08:24] why we got the lineage of adam going
[1:08:26] this way and then the lineage of kane
[1:08:28] going another way what is going on then
[1:08:31] she come to find out that the bible said
[1:08:33] that uh cain was of that wicked one
[1:08:36] which mean cain was not of adam because
[1:08:38] adam was the son of god
[1:08:40] so where did cain come from
[1:08:44] there was a relationship that happened
[1:08:46] between the serpents
[1:08:48] amen and eve and now we gotta understand
[1:08:51] the serpent because cause now now i'm
[1:08:53] not in a serpent a snake that's not no
[1:08:55] no no no you missed it you missed it the
[1:08:57] serpent was cursed
[1:08:59] and put on his belly so before he was
[1:09:01] cursing out on his belly he stood on two
[1:09:04] feet
[1:09:06] it began to make sense to her say this
[1:09:08] is what i'm talking about
[1:09:11] this mystery is being put back together
[1:09:14] and if i can get that out of genesis
[1:09:16] then by the time i get to revelation but
[1:09:18] i get uh not known to us as the thunders
[1:09:21] yet so the actions question
[1:09:23] it says no they were revealed in the
[1:09:25] seven seals that's what the thunders was
[1:09:27] about
[1:09:29] right the thunders was to reveal the
[1:09:31] seals
[1:09:32] amen the thunders came to reveal the
[1:09:37] seals
[1:09:38] unfortunately had people coming to this
[1:09:40] mess and trying to make it so mysterious
[1:09:43] know the thunders the seven when people
[1:09:46] actually you believe the seven thunders
[1:09:47] yes of course i do because they reveal
[1:09:50] the seals
[1:09:52] they reveal the seals right it says uh
[1:09:55] um uh the seven thunders that utter
[1:09:57] their voices and no one can make out
[1:09:59] what it was
[1:10:00] john knew what it was now let me just um
[1:10:03] let me just read this let me make a
[1:10:05] statement but he was forbidden to write
[1:10:06] it he said but the seventh angel in the
[1:10:09] days of his sound and the seven
[1:10:11] mysteries of the seven thunders will be
[1:10:12] revealed and the seventh angel is the
[1:10:14] messenger of the seventh church age now
[1:10:16] that's just a quick answer he said the
[1:10:18] thumbs were revealed in the seals now uh
[1:10:20] let me just let me just drop something
[1:10:21] off here real quick
[1:10:23] there's there you're gonna run into
[1:10:24] people
[1:10:25] that are gonna tell you say well now
[1:10:27] brother branham when he preached that um
[1:10:30] he found material from other people
[1:10:33] they're gonna say found it from larkin
[1:10:35] they found it from some other guy
[1:10:37] russell i think or something like that
[1:10:39] and and some of these guys in i'm
[1:10:41] talking about in early uh 17 18 1900's
[1:10:44] whatever
[1:10:45] these guys had actually uh stumbled
[1:10:47] across some things in scripture
[1:10:49] and they actually came to some light
[1:10:52] right but i think even even this guy
[1:10:54] russell called himself being the
[1:10:56] messenger for that day or something like
[1:10:58] that you know but but here it is my my
[1:11:00] question on any of this did god
[1:11:02] vindicated
[1:11:04] no no no no no doubt people are going to
[1:11:07] stumble on things in the scripture yeah
[1:11:09] they're going to get the truth in that
[1:11:10] but did god vindicate it
[1:11:13] right because when god sent his prophet
[1:11:15] in this day he vindicated him
[1:11:18] from his birth
[1:11:20] all the way to his death he was
[1:11:22] vindicating his prophets
[1:11:24] praise the lord so i'm watching for the
[1:11:26] vindications amen in these things and i
[1:11:29] realized brother adam said yes i did
[1:11:31] look into some of this and i was able to
[1:11:33] just put all the pieces together
[1:11:36] glory glory glory glory
[1:11:39] he brought he brought out you know the
[1:11:41] white horse rider and the red horse ride
[1:11:43] and the pale horse rider it was all
[1:11:45] symbolic the black horse rider all that
[1:11:46] was symbolic in scripture but then he
[1:11:48] actually broke it down and told us what
[1:11:50] it all meant
[1:11:52] amen and when those things were being
[1:11:55] revealed that was the thunders out in
[1:11:56] their voices
[1:11:58] now who connected that
[1:12:01] did russell connect that that the
[1:12:03] thunders were other than their voices
[1:12:04] revealing the seals
[1:12:06] praise the lord all right
[1:12:09] give him let me give you another one
[1:12:11] this out of later seeing church age
[1:12:13] and i had to give you a very specific
[1:12:15] search on that uh so just put that in
[1:12:17] and you'll be able to pull it up it says
[1:12:18] this now this messenger of malachi 4
[1:12:22] in revelation 10 7 and i'm hitting
[1:12:24] highlights here because you have to go
[1:12:26] back and read your bible and see exactly
[1:12:28] what he's saying malachi 4 is a promise
[1:12:30] that god's going to send elijah the
[1:12:32] prophet before the great and terrible
[1:12:34] day of the lord and we are
[1:12:35] fellowshipping under the ministry of
[1:12:37] that
[1:12:38] manifestation
[1:12:39] all right revelation 10 7 is going to do
[1:12:42] two things he says this one according to
[1:12:44] malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[1:12:47] children to the fathers
[1:12:49] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:12:51] seven thunders in revelation 10
[1:12:53] which are
[1:12:55] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:12:59] seals amen it will be these divinely
[1:13:03] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:13:06] heart of the children to the pentecostal
[1:13:08] fathers exactly so this is what we're
[1:13:11] fellowshipping under
[1:13:13] this is what this is why we believe this
[1:13:15] message
[1:13:16] all right so just stay with me i just
[1:13:18] want to drop those things off now i'm
[1:13:21] going to um
[1:13:23] i want to get back to abraham's covenant
[1:13:25] confirm y'all just bear with me we're
[1:13:27] going we're going to make our journey
[1:13:29] through this and and i think you'll see
[1:13:30] some things amen remember only the bride
[1:13:33] gonna recognize it
[1:13:35] amen and um uh uh just like you say you
[1:13:38] gotta you gotta be trained to see
[1:13:40] certain things
[1:13:42] hey
[1:13:43] he said job saw it
[1:13:45] so i was looking at that zodiac and i
[1:13:47] was trying to i couldn't see it but a
[1:13:49] train i always sees it
[1:13:53] job saw it
[1:13:55] all right
[1:13:56] watch this abraham's covenant confirm he
[1:13:58] says i want to say something here
[1:14:01] i'm afraid to
[1:14:03] says is it all right brother
[1:14:05] says now you have to watch
[1:14:07] when you're especially with people
[1:14:09] they misunderstand
[1:14:12] now i believe there
[1:14:14] i believe the threes a trinity
[1:14:17] is in one as we know
[1:14:19] now i believe that god has three god had
[1:14:23] three bibles
[1:14:24] if you'll watch
[1:14:26] now the first bible he wrote was in the
[1:14:29] heavens
[1:14:30] the zodiac
[1:14:31] now i know you can get off on the deep
[1:14:35] ends of that
[1:14:36] and you get off on deep ends of anything
[1:14:39] else but truly if you notice the zodiac
[1:14:42] how did it start it starts the first in
[1:14:45] the zodiac is the virgin
[1:14:47] the last in the zodiac is leo the lion
[1:14:51] the first coming
[1:14:53] and the second coming of christ once
[1:14:56] through the virgin next as the lion of
[1:14:59] the tribe of judah you catch that you
[1:15:01] catch the cross vicious scene that's the
[1:15:04] cancer age that we're going through
[1:15:06] everything in the skies declares god
[1:15:11] everything in the skies declares god
[1:15:14] certainly does watch this he says and
[1:15:16] god's people is to look up
[1:15:20] realizing that god is not on the earth
[1:15:23] but he's in heaven he wrote the first
[1:15:26] bible
[1:15:27] oh glory glory glory
[1:15:30] now the second thing he wrote
[1:15:34] enoch in the times of the pyramid now
[1:15:36] yesterday we were sitting out there
[1:15:38] fellowshipping and with the couples and
[1:15:40] brother marquise happened to say
[1:15:42] something about the pyramid i did not
[1:15:44] internet conversation i said he doesn't
[1:15:46] step right into my sermon
[1:15:49] that's glory to god so brother marquise
[1:15:51] this is for you
[1:15:53] the second thing he wrote
[1:15:56] enoch
[1:15:57] in the times of the pyramid down in
[1:16:00] egypt
[1:16:01] i've been there and perhaps many men and
[1:16:03] here women has been there you notice
[1:16:06] those pyramids we we couldn't reproduce
[1:16:08] them they're too great too gigantic
[1:16:12] they're so geographically in the center
[1:16:14] of the earth no matter where the sun is
[1:16:17] there's never shade around them
[1:16:20] and they got
[1:16:21] tons and tons and tons of boulders up
[1:16:24] there
[1:16:25] and that they argued about that once we
[1:16:27] used to debate it in school how they
[1:16:29] built it well the fella the fellow of my
[1:16:32] point said they rolled it up now i want
[1:16:34] to say they still debating today as to
[1:16:36] how those things got built
[1:16:38] they cannot agree with how these things
[1:16:40] were built
[1:16:42] amen uh just take that down just for a
[1:16:44] second amen i was just kind of looking
[1:16:47] at uh just a little bit uh a little
[1:16:49] video here and there uh youtube and one
[1:16:52] scientist is saying this another
[1:16:53] scientist saying that and they just they
[1:16:55] just kind of just their mind just going
[1:16:57] all over the place maybe it's like this
[1:16:58] and they they got material that they
[1:17:00] study in they say they've never found
[1:17:02] any other material like this on the
[1:17:04] earth they have no idea how these these
[1:17:07] things get like this what material did
[1:17:09] they use how did they put this together
[1:17:11] now here's what i like to say i'm in in
[1:17:14] the furtherance of this quote uh the the
[1:17:16] thing i'd like to say we would if we
[1:17:18] would be willing
[1:17:21] to
[1:17:22] listen to a prophet
[1:17:24] and connect our scientific theories
[1:17:27] to what a prophet has spoken it might
[1:17:30] unlock some mysteries
[1:17:32] because we heard what a prophet said
[1:17:34] about what happened in the garden of
[1:17:36] eden
[1:17:37] listen listen listen listen
[1:17:40] if you can believe
[1:17:42] that there was an adam and eve
[1:17:45] based on what you read in scripture
[1:17:48] you need to understand the way you
[1:17:49] believe in that is because you believed
[1:17:52] a prophet
[1:17:55] what prophet did you believe
[1:17:57] moses
[1:17:59] moses wrote genesis and he was not there
[1:18:05] in order to believe genesis
[1:18:08] you have to believe a prophet
[1:18:11] so if a prophet if the prophet moses
[1:18:13] could tell us what happened in genesis
[1:18:15] then a prophet william branham can also
[1:18:18] tell us what happened at the fall
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:27] here a prophet is going to give us
[1:18:29] something if we want to know how these
[1:18:31] things got together how did they put
[1:18:33] this pyramid together how did they do
[1:18:34] that
[1:18:35] one of the great wonders of the world
[1:18:37] these pyramids are like one of the seven
[1:18:38] women's of the world
[1:18:40] oh there's a lot here to say listen let
[1:18:43] me just let me
[1:18:44] just read this and then i'm gonna go a
[1:18:46] little further
[1:18:47] look at what he's saying
[1:18:49] it says uh they debated in school how
[1:18:52] they built it what a fella of my point
[1:18:54] said they rolled it up
[1:18:56] they rolled the roll roll they rolled
[1:18:58] each stone up into place
[1:19:00] well i said why they couldn't
[1:19:03] i know you can't take a box car and
[1:19:05] unload it and set it out on a rail car
[1:19:07] railroad track
[1:19:09] and put enough men around it to push it
[1:19:13] it it ain't unloaded you you can't do it
[1:19:16] i've seen it tried too many times you
[1:19:19] can only put one line of men the next
[1:19:22] line has to push against the next man's
[1:19:25] back
[1:19:26] right so you got man after man after man
[1:19:29] stacking and they trying to push
[1:19:30] something up they say that that don't
[1:19:32] make sense that ain't gonna work it'll
[1:19:33] never be like that so it says this now
[1:19:36] how you gonna push a boulder up yonder
[1:19:39] a half a city block in the air
[1:19:42] that will weigh a thousand tons
[1:19:45] so it just don't make sense now look at
[1:19:46] what the price here's the answer
[1:19:48] what they had then
[1:19:50] was the atomic power
[1:19:53] just like they got now and they built it
[1:19:57] let me finish reading the quote though
[1:19:58] okay let me finish reading um
[1:20:00] and that's what they shook the world out
[1:20:03] of its orbit
[1:20:05] because away from the sun thrown it
[1:20:07] sideways and brought the reigns and
[1:20:09] destroyed the world by water this time
[1:20:11] they're going to throw the same thing
[1:20:13] right straight back into the sun and
[1:20:15] burn it up again just as perfect as it
[1:20:17] can be
[1:20:19] now you know when i ran across that
[1:20:21] quote they say they used atomic power
[1:20:26] i said i went to my my my the smart
[1:20:28] people in my family because i ain't
[1:20:30] smart
[1:20:32] but my wife and my daughter
[1:20:34] they some of the smartest people walking
[1:20:36] the earth
[1:20:38] and i said i said i said look y'all i'ma
[1:20:40] need some help brother branham said
[1:20:43] that they use atomic power
[1:20:46] in order to build the pyramids i say
[1:20:48] what is this what is atomic power
[1:20:51] and they say now i guess we have to go
[1:20:53] back and look at i mean what just
[1:20:55] asks google what is atomic power and
[1:20:57] when we did that atomic power they said
[1:21:00] it's nuclear
[1:21:01] power
[1:21:03] and nuclear power is used to produce
[1:21:06] electricity
[1:21:09] so here i began to think so now if
[1:21:11] brother branham said they use atomic
[1:21:13] power
[1:21:14] and atomic power is nuclear power and
[1:21:17] nuclear power is used to produce
[1:21:18] electricity then maybe they use
[1:21:21] electricity
[1:21:22] in that time because it ain't new
[1:21:29] and i was already thinking that my
[1:21:30] daughter said she said she said see
[1:21:32] there's nothing new under the sun
[1:21:34] i said that's exactly right
[1:21:37] that was my thought pattern there's
[1:21:39] nothing new under the sun so they had
[1:21:42] that in their generation
[1:21:45] they had atomic power they had nuclear
[1:21:47] power they had electricity
[1:21:51] but it was lost
[1:21:54] it was lost and i and i love this
[1:21:56] because you know i don't know if i have
[1:21:57] let me let me i'm just let me let me let
[1:22:00] me calm down
[1:22:09] recently my wife and i had a a visit to
[1:22:11] noah's ark
[1:22:13] i can't remember the city but i know
[1:22:14] it's in kentucky
[1:22:15] they have a replica of noah's ark there
[1:22:19] uh in kentucky
[1:22:21] and
[1:22:22] um so we we wanted to go by and see this
[1:22:26] there uh back in may early may so we we
[1:22:29] drove down there and we it's like man
[1:22:31] it's a huge boat wow we were just blown
[1:22:34] away
[1:22:35] but they had a they showed that the
[1:22:38] noah's ark was uh that actually the
[1:22:40] titanic was three times as large as the
[1:22:42] noah's ark
[1:22:44] now here man has achieved this titanic
[1:22:47] but he also uh made this comment that
[1:22:49] he's got a ship that won't sink and in
[1:22:52] the very first voyage
[1:22:56] it was done in the first forge but here
[1:22:59] god has a man and he tells them pitch it
[1:23:02] in and pitch it out
[1:23:03] right and and when he built this how's
[1:23:05] this gonna make it but it's still
[1:23:07] standing or i believe they say it's in
[1:23:09] turkey somewhere but uh but but here you
[1:23:11] know uh god built something that would
[1:23:13] last forever
[1:23:15] glory to god has a testament that all we
[1:23:17] gotta do is follow god's word
[1:23:19] stand on the word of god we'll last
[1:23:20] forever right but but but here you know
[1:23:23] uh you know we were going through and
[1:23:25] just
[1:23:26] observing it's just amazing some of the
[1:23:28] things if you ever got a chance to go
[1:23:30] see this place
[1:23:31] just the way that um they fed the
[1:23:34] animals the way they clean the animals
[1:23:36] the system that they had in place is i
[1:23:38] mean it was
[1:23:41] it was beyond something we would even
[1:23:42] think about today right but uh but it
[1:23:44] just i mean they were very very wise
[1:23:48] people during that time uh brother
[1:23:50] branham say that that that that uh
[1:23:52] civilization was even more more advanced
[1:23:54] than our civilization so as i was
[1:23:56] talking my wife and my daughter said you
[1:23:57] know it's possible they had computers
[1:24:01] it's possible they had cell phones
[1:24:03] it's possible they had all this but god
[1:24:05] had to destroy it right
[1:24:09] because of all the sin that they got
[1:24:10] involved in
[1:24:12] and you know what we are we're headed
[1:24:13] towards another destruction
[1:24:17] look there's nothing new
[1:24:23] nothing new i don't care what device
[1:24:26] they come up with nothing new
[1:24:29] so you know this this this lady you know
[1:24:31] she saw us there and just observing
[1:24:33] everything she and she asked the
[1:24:34] question she said do you think
[1:24:36] the pyramids we on the ark
[1:24:39] do you think the pyramids were built
[1:24:41] before the flood or after the flood
[1:24:45] and how my wife start conversing
[1:24:47] and i'm sitting there saying
[1:24:49] before
[1:24:52] before
[1:24:53] now i can't i can only tell you by
[1:24:56] prophetic understanding it was before
[1:25:00] and here brother adam said glory to god
[1:25:02] and i i i didn't i i he said that enoch
[1:25:06] built the pyramids and he says he put a
[1:25:08] bible in it
[1:25:11] now not like this
[1:25:13] but just symbols because he understood
[1:25:16] the zodiac
[1:25:18] certain people understood they studied
[1:25:20] these things they understood so he can
[1:25:21] put that in the pyramids and said but
[1:25:23] now we got this written bible that we
[1:25:25] carry oh hallelujah y'all stay with me
[1:25:28] stay with me
[1:25:29] glory to god
[1:25:31] here we see i said i said it was it was
[1:25:33] it was it was written
[1:25:35] amen before and as i thought about it
[1:25:36] said maybe the reason why these
[1:25:38] scientists
[1:25:39] can't understand why the material is the
[1:25:42] way it is on the pyramids and they can't
[1:25:44] they can't figure out we we've never
[1:25:46] found material like this anywhere else
[1:25:47] in the earth
[1:25:48] remember the reason because the pyramids
[1:25:50] was covered underwater
[1:25:52] and that did something to the material
[1:25:54] and this is why you can't figure out why
[1:25:56] it don't look like nothing else don't
[1:25:57] feel it because it
[1:25:59] all disconnected through what a prophet
[1:26:01] said and if you just take what a prophet
[1:26:04] said it might unlock some mysteries
[1:26:10] if we take what the prophet said it'll
[1:26:12] unlock mysteries in scripture
[1:26:16] all right now
[1:26:19] i'm going to read a little statement out
[1:26:20] of the statue of a perfect man
[1:26:22] actually you know what let me read the
[1:26:24] scripture ecclesiastes 1 verse 9 through
[1:26:26] 11 let me read that for you then we'll
[1:26:28] go to the statue of perfect man the
[1:26:30] bible says this
[1:26:32] the thing that hath
[1:26:34] been it is that which shall be
[1:26:38] and that which is done is that which
[1:26:40] shall be done
[1:26:42] that which is done
[1:26:44] is that which shall be done
[1:26:47] the thing that hath been is that which
[1:26:49] shall be see ain't nothing new under the
[1:26:51] sun
[1:26:52] you ain't doing nothing no different
[1:26:53] than what other people did before you
[1:26:56] and what you doing right now people
[1:26:57] gonna come behind you and do the same
[1:26:59] thing
[1:27:00] come on look at look at the animal life
[1:27:02] look at animal life look at look at uh
[1:27:05] uh dogs still do what dogs do they bark
[1:27:09] they've been barking for years they're
[1:27:10] still doing the same cats do the same
[1:27:12] thing cats do they meow ain't nothing
[1:27:14] change and the next cat born he got me
[1:27:17] out and the next cat born he got me out
[1:27:21] come on
[1:27:22] the thing that hath been it is that
[1:27:24] which shall be
[1:27:26] and that and that which is done is that
[1:27:28] which shall be done and there is no new
[1:27:31] thing
[1:27:32] under the sun
[1:27:35] is there anything wherever it may be
[1:27:37] said see this is new it has been already
[1:27:40] of old time which was before us
[1:27:44] there is no remembrance of former things
[1:27:47] neither shall there be any remembrance
[1:27:49] of things that are to come
[1:27:51] with those things that shall come
[1:27:53] after
[1:27:55] nothing new
[1:27:57] nothing new
[1:27:59] thank god we just take what a prophet
[1:28:01] said
[1:28:03] we'll be all right now listen let me
[1:28:04] just go a little further
[1:28:08] two more quotes and i want to break into
[1:28:10] something here statue of a perfect man
[1:28:13] then after that i'll go right into
[1:28:14] blasphemous names now look at this he
[1:28:16] says this
[1:28:17] please
[1:28:19] let it be known on the tape and wherever
[1:28:21] more i'm not teaching this as a doctrine
[1:28:28] as i'm going through this i'm not
[1:28:30] teaching this as a doctrine not pyramid
[1:28:32] doctrine right it says what i'm going to
[1:28:34] say now but i just want to show you
[1:28:38] that by the help of god
[1:28:40] what it really is that the first bible
[1:28:43] that god ever wrote was the zodiac in
[1:28:45] the sky it starts off with the virgin it
[1:28:49] ends up with leo the lion and when i get
[1:28:53] into that sixth and seventh seal
[1:28:58] now i read a scripture out of revelation
[1:29:00] eight one about the seventh seal when it
[1:29:02] opened the seventh seal there was
[1:29:03] silence all right now watch it says and
[1:29:06] when i get into that sixth and seventh
[1:29:08] hill you'll find out
[1:29:10] when that other seal was opened the
[1:29:13] zodiac mark of that place was canceled
[1:29:15] across fish it says and that's the
[1:29:17] cancer age we're living in now reveal
[1:29:19] and the next thing the seal tore off it
[1:29:21] revealed leo the lion the second coming
[1:29:23] of christ he come first to the virgin he
[1:29:25] comes next leo the lion it'll bring
[1:29:29] uh i'll bring this uh he says now i
[1:29:30] don't know whether i'm gonna have time
[1:29:32] this morning i'm gonna do the best i can
[1:29:34] to show you that these steps are in the
[1:29:37] pyramids just exactly the second bible
[1:29:40] god wrote enoch wrote them and put them
[1:29:43] in the pyramid
[1:29:46] and the third god is always perfected in
[1:29:48] the third then he made himself
[1:29:50] his word which is what we're carrying
[1:29:51] now watch it
[1:29:53] watch it just stay with me and i don't
[1:29:55] want y'all to uh uh uh check out on me
[1:29:58] well jack what is this i'm just showing
[1:29:59] you god has been here all alone
[1:30:02] covering all of uh god is vast we serve
[1:30:05] a big god stop limiting this god that we
[1:30:08] serve
[1:30:08] i mean a god that created universes
[1:30:11] not only that the bible say he created
[1:30:13] worlds
[1:30:16] worlds
[1:30:17] right so so so we gotta we gotta we
[1:30:19] gotta we gotta see how big our god is i
[1:30:21] wanna expand your thinking this morning
[1:30:25] praise god
[1:30:26] even when we read scripture amen why did
[1:30:29] job write that job is the oldest book in
[1:30:31] the bible
[1:30:33] and why would job write this what was
[1:30:34] job looking at
[1:30:38] hey i'm gonna just get i'm gonna go
[1:30:40] ahead of myself and just say this
[1:30:44] joe
[1:30:45] saw seals
[1:30:50] but it was typed in stars
[1:30:57] so job could look all the way down to
[1:30:59] this day and and and put it in a word
[1:31:02] that we we just read right over the word
[1:31:04] never really looked at what the word
[1:31:05] really meant
[1:31:06] but i'll get there
[1:31:08] so let me just let me just keep reading
[1:31:11] all right blasphemous names watch this
[1:31:13] watch this
[1:31:16] now notice on this that christ
[1:31:20] god wrote three bibles
[1:31:22] the first bible was in the in the sky
[1:31:23] now we're not making a doctrine of this
[1:31:25] just kind of sharing something with the
[1:31:26] church that's all this is
[1:31:28] we're not going to be coming up here you
[1:31:30] know every week talk about the three
[1:31:31] bibles and trying to break down it no no
[1:31:33] no we ain't doing all of that
[1:31:36] just a little thought for the church
[1:31:38] amen notice on this that christ god
[1:31:41] wrote three bibles the first bible's in
[1:31:43] the sky called the zodiac now if you
[1:31:45] don't know the book of job
[1:31:47] look at it if you don't know the book of
[1:31:49] job
[1:31:50] just forget about it
[1:31:52] because because job is the one explains
[1:31:54] it
[1:31:55] job explain what
[1:31:57] job is the one explains it how that he
[1:32:00] looked up
[1:32:01] and he named those things in the sky
[1:32:05] job looked up
[1:32:07] and he named those things in the sky
[1:32:12] we just read and i'm gonna go back and
[1:32:14] read it for you again just just bear
[1:32:15] with me job named the things in the sky
[1:32:20] and god writing his bible in the sky god
[1:32:23] writing his bible amen through enoch
[1:32:25] enoch was a prophet and he sticks he
[1:32:27] puts it inside the pyramid and then god
[1:32:29] gives us his written word
[1:32:33] he makes it sure that we don't miss this
[1:32:36] it says notice in the zodiac what did it
[1:32:38] start off the first thing in the zodiac
[1:32:40] is the virgin last thing in the zodiac
[1:32:42] leo the line the first coming of christ
[1:32:44] through the virgin the second coming leo
[1:32:46] the lion the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:32:48] now let's look at some of joe's
[1:32:50] declarations just watch this follow me
[1:32:52] here all right

[1:33:11] that faced many tragedies and and here's

[1:33:20] really speaks to the believers today
[1:33:23] how this man responded to tragedy amen
[1:33:26] one of the things said that the sabians
[1:33:28] came and and stole his oxen and his
[1:33:31] donkeys and they killed most of the
[1:33:33] servants that were watching over those
[1:33:34] animals and only one servant escaped to

[1:38:06] this for i know
[1:38:09] that my redeemer liveth
[1:38:11] glory and that he shall stand at the
[1:38:14] latter day upon the earth and though
[1:38:17] after my skin worms
[1:38:19] destroyed this body and brother adam say
[1:38:22] the worm that's going to destroy you is
[1:38:24] already living on the inside of you
[1:38:26] glory to god to those after my skin
[1:38:29] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh

[1:38:38] shall be holding out another though my
[1:38:40] reigns be consumed within me job
[1:38:42] declaring that he's going to see god
[1:38:45] even though the the devil's attacking
[1:38:47] his flesh i'ma still see god in my flesh
[1:38:51] job got a
[1:38:52] a glimpse
[1:38:54] of the resurrection
[1:38:56] brother branham said that job also saw
[1:38:59] some other things
[1:39:01] he's the one that explained these things
[1:39:03] that he saw in the sky he began to
[1:39:04] declare
[1:39:06] even in the midst of what he was going
[1:39:08] through let's go back and pick him up in
[1:39:09] job chapter 9 verse 1 through 10
[1:39:12] job is declaring some things
[1:39:16] hallelujah the bible says then job
[1:39:18] answered and remember now job had a
[1:39:20] couple friends that came to visit him
[1:39:22] while he was going through
[1:39:24] and let me tell you something if you're
[1:39:25] going to go visit somebody while they're
[1:39:26] going through
[1:39:28] try to encourage them
[1:39:31] but joe's friends came to just let him
[1:39:33] know that they thought he was a secret
[1:39:34] sinner
[1:39:36] and i mean
[1:39:37] evidently they must have got together
[1:39:38] because all three of them were just
[1:39:39] sitting there just letting job have it
[1:39:42] and job joe made his statements he said
[1:39:44] i'm not inferior to you
[1:39:46] i ain't got i there's no sin in my life
[1:39:48] i know even job's wife came to him and
[1:39:49] said why don't you uh curse god and die
[1:39:52] he so notice you speak like a foolish
[1:39:54] woman but he didn't call a fool so
[1:39:56] you're just talking like a foolish woman
[1:39:59] saying no no no no i can learn how to
[1:40:00] praise god in the midst even when i
[1:40:02] don't have i can praise them and when i
[1:40:04] do have i can praise them
[1:40:07] watch this job while he's talking to his
[1:40:09] friends he makes this comment and job 90
[1:40:11] says then jose jobe answered and said i
[1:40:13] know it
[1:40:15] so the truth
[1:40:16] but how should man be just with god
[1:40:20] says if he would contend with him he
[1:40:22] cannot answer him one of a thousand
[1:40:24] he is wise and heart mighty in strength
[1:40:28] who hath hardened himself against him
[1:40:29] and have prospered
[1:40:31] how are you gonna harden yourself
[1:40:32] against god i don't believe in god how
[1:40:34] are you gonna prosper
[1:40:39] it says which removeth the mountains and
[1:40:41] they know not
[1:40:42] which overturneth them in his anger
[1:40:45] which shaketh the earth out of a place
[1:40:47] and the pillars thereof tremble which
[1:40:49] commandeth the sun and a rise of night
[1:40:52] and sealeth up the stars
[1:40:55] oh glory which alone spreadeth out the
[1:40:58] heavens and treadeth upon the waves of
[1:40:59] the sea which maketh now watch this job
[1:41:02] is the one that names them
[1:41:07] which maketh
[1:41:09] arcturus
[1:41:11] orion
[1:41:13] pleiades
[1:41:14] and the chambers of the south which do
[1:41:16] with great things past finding out yay
[1:41:18] and wonders without number now you know
[1:41:21] when i had to go and look up some of
[1:41:23] these words what does arcturus mean
[1:41:26] arcturus is the fourth brightest star in
[1:41:28] the sky
[1:41:30] and they say it's in the brightest in
[1:41:32] the constellation of boots it is they
[1:41:34] call it an orange giant and they said uh
[1:41:36] also i'm looking at this uh definition
[1:41:38] the key to the bible it's a brilliant
[1:41:40] star
[1:41:41] near the northern constellation of ursa
[1:41:44] major and they call it the great bear
[1:41:47] and i like this the fourth brightest
[1:41:50] star arcturus because god is found in
[1:41:53] the number four
[1:41:54] amen he was the fourth man in the fire
[1:41:58] come on church amen lazarus was gone
[1:42:01] four days when he came back
[1:42:03] i mean god that number four is the
[1:42:05] number of deliverance and here oh my job
[1:42:08] can see his deliverance
[1:42:11] in arcturus
[1:42:18] orion
[1:42:20] he names it
[1:42:22] amen and orion is a brilliant
[1:42:24] constellation of about 80 stars in the
[1:42:27] southern hemisphere
[1:42:30] so looking at the northern hemisphere he
[1:42:32] can see god he's looking at the southern
[1:42:34] hemisphere and he can still see god
[1:42:39] oh let me go a little further i want to
[1:42:40] talk about pleiades
[1:42:42] but before i get into that let me
[1:42:45] just make a little comment
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] joe 38
[1:42:55] we're gonna pick up something here
[1:43:00] job had gone through all this
[1:43:02] with his friends and joe going through
[1:43:04] in his body job lost his animals but you
[1:43:05] know at the end of the story joe got
[1:43:07] everything back double
[1:43:09] he got double for his trouble
[1:43:11] see satan should have took me through
[1:43:13] that i'm about to get double i'm about
[1:43:14] to get double
[1:43:16] hey hallelujah somebody
[1:43:18] but but but here in job 38 what happened
[1:43:20] is that god has to come down and he
[1:43:24] begins to make some comments to job
[1:43:26] and he asks him some questions he says
[1:43:28] where were you when i laid the
[1:43:30] foundations of the earth
[1:43:32] he says and what are the foundations
[1:43:34] even fastened to
[1:43:36] right it says who laid the cornerstone
[1:43:38] of it job
[1:43:40] right and then he asked job of question
[1:43:41] where were you when the sons of god
[1:43:43] shouted for joy
[1:43:45] and the morning stars began to sing
[1:43:47] together it says god just began to ask
[1:43:49] some questions and then in job 38 verse
[1:43:52] 31 and 32 let's pick it up
[1:43:54] oh
[1:43:55] he asked job a question cans thou
[1:43:59] bind
[1:44:01] the sweet influences
[1:44:04] of pleiades
[1:44:06] or lose the bands of orion
[1:44:10] can style bring forth mazeroth in his
[1:44:13] season or cast thou god
[1:44:16] arcturus
[1:44:18] with his sons so god has this same a
[1:44:21] level a man of understanding that job
[1:44:23] has and he asks for these questions
[1:44:25] about pleiades and arcturus and orion oh

[1:45:14] there was one that actually had seven
[1:45:16] stars in his hand
[1:45:20] glory to god and in his absence those
[1:45:23] seven stars would be reflected light on
[1:45:25] the earth
[1:45:26] seven messengers
[1:45:31] seek him that maketh the seven stars and
[1:45:34] the rhyme

[1:46:22] to see it they'll see it
[1:46:25] and when those other seals on the back
[1:46:27] is open they'll only be revealed to them
[1:46:30] remember that now now here's another
[1:46:32] definition about pleiades that i want
[1:46:34] you to catch
[1:46:36] so uh a a a definition from
[1:46:38] the the astronomy dictionary if i can
[1:46:40] put it that way amen just and it says
[1:46:43] this
[1:46:45] pleiades is a well-known open cluster of
[1:46:47] stars in the constellation taurus now
[1:46:50] watch this
[1:46:52] six
[1:46:54] stars are visible
[1:46:57] to the naked eye
[1:47:02] six so there's it's a constellation of
[1:47:04] seven stars but
[1:47:06] six are visible
[1:47:09] to the naked eye
[1:47:12] what about the seventh
[1:47:14] amendment

[1:48:02] and it was spoken of in pleiades
[1:48:07] oh
[1:48:08] glory to god
[1:48:10] hey the first bible ties to the second
[1:48:13] bible

[1:48:38] of completion
[1:48:40] and they named it player these

[1:48:48] uh
[1:48:48] astronomy dictionary they say six of
[1:48:50] them are visible
[1:48:52] i said my god
[1:48:55] i went to the key to the bible
[1:48:57] this little book that sister michelle
[1:48:58] gave me years ago and i it says that
[1:49:00] this pleiades meant it's a cluster of
[1:49:02] seven stars appearing
[1:49:04] in the constellation of taurus

[1:51:15] astronomy they said six of them are
[1:51:17] visible but the seventh one wasn't i
[1:51:19] said oh my that taught right about
[1:51:21] themselves because when it opened the
[1:51:23] seventh seal they were silenced
[1:51:26] so let me go ahead and read to you out
[1:51:28] of the seventh seal
[1:51:39] the sweet influences of pleiades
[1:51:42] i could have actually just titled it
[1:51:43] that
[1:51:44] but i knew that might have been too much
[1:51:46] so i just made it job's declarations
[1:51:52] the seventh seal
[1:51:53] the brother adam makes this and and i
[1:51:55] want y'all to remember when before he
[1:51:56] even preached the seals this is what i
[1:51:58] mean by the supernatural before he
[1:52:00] preached it no matter what
[1:52:02] people say remember them seven angels
[1:52:04] came down and made the face of christ
[1:52:06] and sent him back to the east in order
[1:52:08] to preach it so so no matter what people
[1:52:11] have come before and actually come up
[1:52:13] and say you know they might have some
[1:52:14] understanding on the white horse ride to
[1:52:15] be amen the antichrist and just four
[1:52:18] different phases of the antichrist
[1:52:19] that's all those horse riders were right
[1:52:21] but uh he says uh uh i said no no matter
[1:52:24] who might have stumbled across that
[1:52:25] first did god vindicate it
[1:52:28] were there seven angels that came down
[1:52:30] make the face of christ that we can look
[1:52:32] at and say okay now this is the time
[1:52:34] that this is to be released and now
[1:52:36] we're fellowshipping on these sweet
[1:52:37] influences
[1:52:39] and we we know this god sent a prophet
[1:52:41] and vindicated his own prophet we don't
[1:52:44] have to vindicate him god already did
[1:52:45] that
[1:52:47] we just believe it that's right
[1:52:49] let me he preached and god sent him back
[1:52:51] with those the visitation of seven
[1:52:53] angels go back and preach the seals and
[1:52:54] every day he walked out to preach uh
[1:52:57] angel would visit him
[1:52:58] and give him the revelation of the word
[1:53:00] for that day
[1:53:02] he said he was going back to some of his
[1:53:04] old notes and god was showing no no no
[1:53:05] not that it just unfold the word of god
[1:53:07] to them every day supernaturally brought
[1:53:09] to us these revelations and there some
[1:53:11] of them will tie to what others have
[1:53:13] said because he's just tying up the
[1:53:15] loose ends
[1:53:19] seven seals he made this comment
[1:53:21] oh my
[1:53:23] god
[1:53:24] now there's some reason god let the
[1:53:26] seven voices be thundered remember the
[1:53:28] thunders
[1:53:29] are the revelations
[1:53:31] in the seals
[1:53:34] the sweet influence
[1:53:37] of plenties
[1:53:40] there was some reason that god let the
[1:53:43] seven voices be thundered
[1:53:46] because it must come
[1:53:48] we find that christ the lamb took the
[1:53:50] book in his hand and he opened the
[1:53:52] seventh seal but you see it's a hidden
[1:53:54] mystery no one knows it
[1:53:57] the seventh seal a hidden mystery no one
[1:53:59] knows it remember that seven star was
[1:54:01] hidden no one could see it no one knows
[1:54:03] it the seven still no one knows it all
[1:54:06] right but it's right along with what he
[1:54:08] said
[1:54:10] no one would know his coming the seventh
[1:54:13] seal the reason there was a half-hour
[1:54:15] silence because that that's connected to
[1:54:17] the coming of the lord and if he would
[1:54:18] reveal any more he would reveal his
[1:54:20] coming
[1:54:21] see some of us want to live a life
[1:54:23] if we knew the exact day that jesus was
[1:54:25] coming
[1:54:27] if we knew the exact day exact time
[1:54:29] that's when we would make things right
[1:54:32] we would live like devils
[1:54:34] until that day and then all of a sudden
[1:54:37] was lying in glory lord i love you
[1:54:40] god know you living like that and that's
[1:54:42] why he gonna surprise you like a thief
[1:54:44] in the night
[1:54:45] nobody know when a thief is coming
[1:54:48] however if you're the bride you are not
[1:54:50] of the night
[1:54:53] so it's not a mystery to you you live
[1:54:55] ready all the time
[1:54:58] all right
[1:54:59] listen
[1:55:03] we find that the christ the lamb took
[1:55:04] the book in his hand and he opened the
[1:55:06] sentence but you see it's a hidden
[1:55:07] mystery no one knows it but it's right
[1:55:09] along what he said no one would know his
[1:55:11] coming
[1:55:12] they also would not know about his seven
[1:55:15] thunder mystery
[1:55:17] so you see
[1:55:19] it's connected together
[1:55:23] that much we have an understanding of it
[1:55:25] today
[1:55:26] because the rest of it is all unfolded
[1:55:28] but this is not unfolded but sitting in
[1:55:31] my room i heard this or not heard it
[1:55:32] rather but seen it unfold to the seven
[1:55:34] thunders
[1:55:36] now that's as far as we can go right
[1:55:38] there and now i trust that each and
[1:55:40] every one of you will serve god and do
[1:55:42] that which is right and love him all
[1:55:44] your life and serve him and god will
[1:55:46] take care of the rest of it even in this
[1:55:48] watch this now and i'm gonna read a
[1:55:50] little bit more even in this having this
[1:55:52] understanding should not cause us to
[1:55:54] live
[1:55:56] um
[1:55:57] these ridiculous
[1:55:59] like i said be a sane christian
[1:56:01] don't go around i mean you know just
[1:56:04] come on you don't have to pray about
[1:56:06] what toothpaste to buy
[1:56:08] you don't have to do that
[1:56:09] get the one on sale and just just just
[1:56:12] just move on but don't don't be that
[1:56:14] type of christian you know
[1:56:16] lord i just need you to lead me god oh
[1:56:19] god come on y'all i mean some things god
[1:56:21] just wants you to just do
[1:56:24] god don't even want you to cry no more
[1:56:25] he wants you to speak right so so so
[1:56:27] it's time to grow up and be a mature
[1:56:29] christian
[1:56:32] and and don't get so high and mighty got
[1:56:35] all these revelations
[1:56:36] but you're so deep in your revelation
[1:56:37] that nobody can fellowship with you
[1:56:40] you can't even fellowship with yourself
[1:56:46] you don't even get along with your own
[1:56:47] self
[1:56:49] that's bad
[1:56:50] nobody and nobody understand you no no
[1:56:53] no no no no no that's not true brother
[1:56:55] branham gave us very clear instructions
[1:56:58] be sane christians
[1:57:00] this day don't make it don't don't cause
[1:57:03] our heads to get puffed up and and now
[1:57:05] we can't even just be normal people
[1:57:08] hallelujah this is just a little food
[1:57:10] for the bride
[1:57:11] when you go back and you read about
[1:57:13] pleiades now it makes sense to you
[1:57:18] job named it
[1:57:21] job looked and saw in the north and saw
[1:57:23] our tourists
[1:57:24] looked over in the south and saw uh
[1:57:26] orion
[1:57:28] then he looked again and saw pleiades
[1:57:33] and then god come and ask him said cam
[1:57:35] now what about fellowship and under
[1:57:36] sweet influences
[1:57:40] of plenties
[1:57:43] i told you brother eugene had me he
[1:57:45] stopped talking about this i said my god
[1:57:47] brother eugene i never looked at the
[1:57:48] scripture like that but this bible
[1:57:50] become a new bible
[1:57:52] especially brother branham said that
[1:57:53] when the seals opened the bible became a
[1:57:55] new book to him i can tie the seventh
[1:57:57] seal
[1:57:59] to job
[1:58:06] god did that
[1:58:08] he just opened it up so we could see it
[1:58:11] and the oldest book of the bible
[1:58:14] seven seals was right there but written
[1:58:16] in the zodiac
[1:58:20] and six of them were visible
[1:58:22] but the seventh one wasn't
[1:58:25] oh that's in our bible too
[1:58:28] let me keep reading
[1:58:32] now we have in the completion here now
[1:58:35] by the grace of god all the mysteries of
[1:58:37] the six seals has been sealed up
[1:58:40] and we understand and know here that the
[1:58:42] seventh seal is
[1:58:44] look at this look at this the seventh
[1:58:45] seal
[1:58:46] is not to be known to the
[1:58:52] uh oh that i think i said something
[1:58:54] about that earlier
[1:58:56] right that only uh when these other
[1:58:58] seals on the back is open they'll only
[1:59:00] be revealed to them
[1:59:04] the bride
[1:59:05] not to the public
[1:59:07] the bride
[1:59:10] now his coming and the hour of his
[1:59:12] coming when the destruction of the earth
[1:59:15] you know he said here what would be the
[1:59:16] sign of his coming in the end of the
[1:59:18] world in matthew 24 there where they
[1:59:20] asked him the question he went down to
[1:59:22] that he told about israel being gathered
[1:59:24] as a nation in the 31st verse of matthew
[1:59:26] 24 31 but when he started off on parable
[1:59:28] seed then you see there learn a parable
[1:59:30] the fig tree when you see it put them
[1:59:32] forth as buds
[1:59:34] why you know it's spring
[1:59:35] nigh you know you know spring is not and
[1:59:38] then when you see this coming to pass
[1:59:40] then you know the time is nigh
[1:59:42] see israel's gathering in his own
[1:59:44] homeland but you notice he omitted the
[1:59:46] revelation of the seventh seal that's
[1:59:48] jesus speaking in matthew 24 he never
[1:59:50] spoke of the seventh seal can i say six
[1:59:53] stars of pleiades were revealed in
[1:59:55] matthew 24 but the seventh was not
[1:59:58] visible right amen
[2:00:01] that's right
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:06] he says see israel's gathering its own
[2:00:07] homeland but you notice he admitted the
[2:00:09] revelation of seventh hill and here when
[2:00:11] the seven seal when he opened it he also
[2:00:13] omitted it again so when brother
[2:00:15] branham's out there preaching it he has
[2:00:17] he's the holy spirit actually says no
[2:00:18] stop right there
[2:00:20] don't go any further than that
[2:00:22] all you can talk about is these seven
[2:00:23] thumbs that connects to these seals and
[2:00:25] just show that they're connected
[2:00:27] together and it's also connected to the
[2:00:28] coming of the lord we're living in the
[2:00:30] coming right now
[2:00:34] now we might not know the very date of
[2:00:35] the hour and look it's no need for us to
[2:00:37] be searching this out
[2:00:39] i mean i know we got people that they
[2:00:41] try to get the exact day
[2:00:42] and oftentimes they miss it
[2:00:45] they tell us this day and then they
[2:00:47] change it
[2:00:48] and then they tell us again then they
[2:00:49] check stop searching for that right god
[2:00:52] ain't gonna reveal that to nobody
[2:00:54] if his prophet didn't share it you can't
[2:00:56] share it
[2:01:01] you admitted the revelation of the seven
[2:01:03] still just oh my
[2:01:04] and here when the seventh seal when he
[2:01:06] opened it he also admitted again see
[2:01:08] so we see
[2:01:10] that it's completely a mystery it is a
[2:01:13] complete mystery therefore the hour is
[2:01:15] not yet
[2:01:16] for these mysteries to be known
[2:01:18] therefore we're this far
[2:01:20] and the rest of it
[2:01:22] will be known right around about the
[2:01:24] time that jesus appears on earth again
[2:01:26] for his bride
[2:01:28] or whatever takes place at that time
[2:01:31] now until
[2:01:33] that time
[2:01:35] let us just all pray
[2:01:38] and live good
[2:01:39] straight
[2:01:41] christian
[2:01:42] lives
[2:01:43] looking forward
[2:01:45] for his coming
[2:01:49] i couldn't i i could i think we couldn't
[2:01:51] find any better advice
[2:01:53] yes we got all of this god has revealed
[2:01:55] it but just live good christian lives
[2:01:58] until jesus comes again
[2:02:00] church i'll tell you i'm blessed and
[2:02:02] looking at some of job's declarations
[2:02:04] and
[2:02:05] looking at how prophet ties it all
[2:02:06] together just helps us see the scripture
[2:02:08] in a different line like i said i'm in
[2:02:10] uncharted territory
[2:02:12] but i should enjoy swimming out here
[2:02:14] like this with y'all

[2:05:18] this morning
[2:05:20] amen the enemy tried to derail me from
[2:05:23] making it this morning
[2:05:25] we had a wonderful time on
[2:05:27] uh last night with the couples and on
[2:05:30] our way home
[2:05:31] i don't know what what i tell you the
[2:05:34] devil's still alive uh
[2:05:36] something ran out in front of us and uh
[2:05:40] kind of messed up the bottom of my car
[2:05:42] and this morning i said well i think i
[2:05:44] still could make it i started out
[2:05:47] and i got on the outskirts of town
[2:05:49] and uh it's just something was scrubbing
[2:05:52] it was the the inner part of
[2:05:54] the bottom part of my car
[2:05:56] ah
[2:05:57] i'm not gonna make it to church
[2:06:00] and i turned around and sent that
[2:06:02] brother jack
[2:06:03] a message i called him he said man i
[2:06:05] ain't gonna be able to make it
[2:06:07] and uh
[2:06:09] but you know my mind started working and
[2:06:12] i said if i could get rid of this little
[2:06:14] piece right here so i went home and i
[2:06:17] got me some slips and i cut that little
[2:06:19] plastic off i say i'm on my way
[2:06:22] i say i'm already dressed
[2:06:25] ain't no sense of staying home
[2:06:29] so i said well they they sing sometime
[2:06:32] for a little minute so i say i think i
[2:06:34] got time
[2:06:35] and by the time i pulled up in the
[2:06:37] parking lot brother troy called me and
[2:06:39] uh
[2:06:40] brother jack was up and i said well i'm
[2:06:42] right on time i get the end time and i
[2:06:44] don't know about y'all but i'm happy to
[2:06:46] be here this morning
[2:06:50] i'm gonna get out the way but but i will
[2:06:53] say this this is the reason why uh it's
[2:06:56] important never to put a period behind
[2:06:58] what you believe
[2:07:01] because the moment the moment you put a
[2:07:03] period behind what you believe
[2:07:05] there's there's where the revelation of
[2:07:07] god stops for you
[2:07:11] right this thing will be unfolding
[2:07:15] way on the other side things that things
[2:07:18] that
[2:07:19] you know even even i've been preaching
[2:07:21] close to 30 years now and i still
[2:07:24] realize sometimes man i'm on the surface
[2:07:28] but i tell you what he took us out into
[2:07:30] the deep this morning
[2:07:33] all right well i tell you i'm sitting
[2:07:35] back there man like like those guys with
[2:07:38] the grapes that they had and took from
[2:07:40] kanan
[2:07:41] and the little grape juice all around my
[2:07:43] mouth and everything else
[2:07:46] i could see brother solomon like
[2:07:48] wow
[2:07:51] that's all right i tell you what i
[2:07:52] appreciate brother jacket and his
[2:07:55] ministry
[2:07:56] boy he be coming up with some things so
[2:07:59] so whatever we do
[2:08:01] just never put a period there just
[2:08:03] always keep a calm up because god i
[2:08:06] believe that in this season god's got
[2:08:09] just so much for us
[2:08:11] just to understand
[2:08:14] i'm glad to be a part of a special group
[2:08:16] of people
[2:08:18] right
[2:08:19] and you are you all too too to know that
[2:08:22] that you're special that god chose you
[2:08:25] before the foundation
[2:08:26] of the world
