[0:12] will you start tonight and the sardis rd
[0:18] zhizn church age here in Revelation
[0:19] chapter three and it was just pull it
[0:25] from the scripture here revelation 3
[0:27] verse 1 through 6 and we'll be
[0:30] discussing tonight this topic on the
[0:33] salutation revelation 3 verse 1 says and
[0:51] unto the Angel of the church and Sardis
[0:55] write these things saith he that hath
[1:00] the seven spirits of God and the seven
[1:03] stars I know that works that thou has to
[1:05] name that thou liveth and our dead and
[1:08] just so that you know tonight we're
[1:10] focusing really on this person and a
[1:13] portion of it where we're really going
[1:17] to dig into the seven spirits of God so
[1:20] this is the the citation of the greeting
[1:22] to this church unto the angel the church
[1:25] in Sardis write these things saith he
[1:28] that hath the seven spirits of God and
[1:31] the seven stars I know that works that
[1:35] thou has to name that thou livers and
[1:38] art dent be watchful and strengthen the
[1:41] things which remain that are ready to
[1:44] die for I have not found that works
[1:46] perfect before God remember therefore
[1:49] how thou has received and heard and hold
[1:51] fast and repent if therefore thou shalt
[1:54] not watch I will come on thee as a thief
[1:56] and thou shalt not know what hour I will
[1:59] come upon the verse for that has a few
[2:04] names even in Sardis which have not
[2:07] defiled their garments and they shall
[2:10] walk with me in white for they are
[2:13] worthy and he that overcometh the same
[2:17] shall be clothed in white raiment and I
[2:20] will not blot out his name out of the
[2:22] book of life but our confess his name
[2:25] before my father and before his angels
[2:30] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:33] the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:36] alright just kind of some review from
[2:44] you know what we did on last week and
[2:48] just kind of going through the seven
[2:53] churches the key thing that we want to
[2:55] bring out here is that these churches
[2:56] did exist and in Asia they did exist but
[3:03] the thing about these churches is that
[3:05] they had characteristics and them that
[3:07] reflect a future H and we're kind of
[3:11] trying to pick up those characteristics
[3:12] in our next slide here but this age here
[3:16] is a number sardis right here this is
[3:20] where this church existed and as you can
[3:23] see the scripture says the mystery the
[3:24] seven stars which that starts in my
[3:26] right hand and the seven golden
[3:27] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[3:29] angels of the seven churches and the
[3:31] Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[3:33] the seven churches so we are dealing
[3:35] with Sardis here which is laying here on
[3:39] on the map alright the age here where
[3:44] let me just get something here
[4:03] you
[4:07] the thus artesian age lasted from 1520
[4:12] to 1750 and it was called the age of
[4:16] reformation which i think is very very
[4:18] critical to where we are even today when
[4:23] we would just kind of get to just kind
[4:25] of thinking about what what really took
[4:28] place like I've mentioned to you all on
[4:30] last week Luther being the messenger to
[4:34] that age and what he did Luther taking
[4:37] the 95 theses an element to the Catholic
[4:40] Church door that actually opened up some
[4:45] opportunity for hate to say it but it
[4:49] opened up the opportunity for like more
[4:53] denominations not that we needed more
[4:56] denominations but what happened before
[4:58] that if you were not capped that you
[5:00] were going to die that's pretty much
[5:02] what was going to happen but when Luther
[5:04] came forth with his teachings and things
[5:07] like that there was a varus just seems
[5:09] to be just like God lifted up the spirit
[5:12] where people weren't killing people for
[5:13] because their faith they were actually a
[5:15] little bit more open to allowing people
[5:17] to express you know just some other
[5:20] views on Scripture and even to this
[5:22] point where we are right now you know
[5:23] for us to express what we're expressing
[5:25] is because of that that door that opened
[5:28] up during the Sardis interchange that's
[5:30] what even allows us to do the gather the
[5:32] way that we gather even right now so we
[5:34] thank god for certain thank God for this
[5:37] age so 15 22 1750 is is when it occurred
[5:43] some of the other things here in that
[5:45] city we brought this out on last week
[5:48] the capital city of Sardis was ancient
[5:52] Lydia the city was at one time very
[5:55] important commercially very important
[5:58] city brother Branham brought that out to
[6:00] us it was said that gold coins were
[6:03] first minted here gold coins were first
[6:07] minted in this place sardis gold coins
[6:10] being first minted there another thing
[6:12] here the city was desolated by our
[6:15] earthquakes and plagues and thus it is
[6:18] uninhabited
[6:19] it's a heap of ruins today all right and
[6:22] finally the thing I wanted to bring out
[6:24] is they had a religion in that city
[6:26] where they worship it was Emperor
[6:29] worship of the goddess ciple and we were
[6:33] bringing out last week how seibel was
[6:36] supposed to be the mother and her son
[6:38] was do eous and what happens that side
[6:41] will begin to get a little bit more
[6:43] worship than her son do eous and this
[6:46] church age so the characteristic that we
[6:48] see there in that church age and how it
[6:50] reflects in the church itself is that
[6:52] Mary began to get a little bit more
[6:54] worship than Jesus right and i think
[6:57] that's still the situation today
[6:59] especially in the catholic church Mary
[7:02] is she gets a little bit more and I
[7:05] think I heard somebody say that on what
[7:08] what son would not honor his mother by
[7:12] doing whatever she asks what what summer
[7:15] not on his mother so they put Mary a
[7:17] little higher than Jesus however
[7:19] according to scripture jesus never
[7:23] actually called Mary Mother you can't
[7:26] find one scripture where he did that and
[7:28] so you know what people are coming up
[7:32] with nowadays and what they've whether
[7:33] distend on for a long time it's been
[7:36] completely wrong but you never see one
[7:38] time where Jesus called Mary his mother
[7:41] brother branham told us that she was the
[7:43] incubator that just brought forth you
[7:47] know the the body of Jesus you know but
[7:50] she was not the mother of Jesus because
[7:53] God Himself cannot have a mother or a
[7:56] father right so all right let's going a
[7:59] little further here we were bringing out
[8:02] some of this I something happened this
[8:05] week I was um I want to bring this back
[8:09] up because i just showed this last week
[8:12] that slide and when i showed it it was a
[8:16] quote where brother branham said let's
[8:18] look at the side by side and so when I
[8:21] saw the quote there in the church age
[8:23] book I said well I want to list it side
[8:24] by side here on the screen for everybody
[8:26] just to kind of get a view of and you
[8:29] know when I did that
[8:31] I had no idea that I was going to get
[8:35] this book delivered to me this week well
[8:40] I bought it the brother George Smith
[8:42] brother branham son-in-law actually put
[8:45] the church age book and a leather-bound
[8:48] almost looked like a look Bible but I
[8:50] but he put in leather bound as a 50 year
[8:53] celebration you know of the church ages
[8:55] and when he put it he turned to the page
[8:57] where this this statement was made he
[9:00] said brother Brandon said let's list it
[9:02] side by side so in this book he actually
[9:04] listed it side by sides and I say well
[9:07] what a confirmation you know I really I
[9:09] really appreciated seeing that but but I
[9:12] what I want to just kind of bring out
[9:13] here is that delius as we look here on
[9:16] this side the earliest he was the Sun
[9:18] God but Cybele she was the moon goddess
[9:23] all right he was the lord of heaven she
[9:26] was the queen of heaven he the revealer
[9:28] of goodness and truth she of gentle and
[9:32] merton mercy the reveal of gentleness
[9:34] and mercy He the mediator she the media
[9:38] tricks he with the key that opens and
[9:41] shuts the gates of the invisible world
[9:43] she with an identical key doing likewise
[9:47] he was the judge of the Dead she
[9:50] standing at his side he being killed
[9:53] raising ascended into heaven she cared
[9:56] their bodily by the Sun and what brother
[9:59] Brandon brings to our attention says now
[10:01] in Rome the stain God has given the
[10:03] title of our Lord he is called the Son
[10:06] of God while she is called the mother of
[10:09] God so you know some of the things that
[10:11] they were bringing forth in this star
[10:13] degen age and some of the
[10:14] characteristics there we're seeing that
[10:15] has has also just been kind of flowing
[10:18] all the way through to even to this age
[10:19] in the Catholic Church that's going a
[10:22] little further here I'm having a little
[10:24] problem with my technology so I'm going
[10:26] to have to just do this this way so the
[10:31] key thing that we want to try to get
[10:33] everybody to see the reason that the
[10:35] characteristics of that we're pointing
[10:37] out here in Sardis the city of Sardis
[10:40] was known for the worship of the female
[10:42] deity dated by the name of sighs oh and
[10:44] that one
[10:45] inside wendys will worship together but
[10:46] by and by in the city of Sardis it came
[10:49] to worship to the worship of cyber alone
[10:52] leaving the worship of Diaz do is out
[10:56] completely and I believe we are really
[10:59] in the same spot again we're seeing that
[11:01] all over again even in this day it's all
[11:04] about Mary and not about Jesus it's not
[11:09] about Jesus if we were to even think
[11:16] about this season that we're in
[11:18] Christmas season Christ has been
[11:21] completely moved out you okay you all
[11:25] see people where they have it used to be
[11:27] Merry Christmas now it's merry xmas
[11:31] right and when you see that X Christ has
[11:34] completely been taken out of the picture
[11:36] now we know by revelation that it was
[11:40] never his birthday in the first place we
[11:42] know that by revelation but for the
[11:44] church world if they those that have no
[11:46] idea are those things if they were just
[11:49] to look at just basic things like that
[11:50] they can see Christ is no longer even in
[11:53] the picture anymore completely removed
[11:55] you know I was I was talking to somebody
[12:00] this week and you know they were since
[12:01] y'all having service on Christmas Day
[12:03] I'm like yeah I mean I didn't even think
[12:07] about canceling church and I'm thinking
[12:09] to say well whose birthday is it anyway
[12:11] I mean you know who would have a este
[12:15] birthday you don't show for the party on
[12:17] a birthday something wrong with that
[12:19] picture right I mean so if it you know
[12:22] it's like he's just no longer in the
[12:24] picture anymore you know it's really a
[12:27] shame of what we see that has happened
[12:30] but these spirits were released way back
[12:32] in this artesian age and we can see full
[12:35] manifestation full-blown manifestation
[12:37] of it here today also why is it
[12:42] important to the sages because as time
[12:44] went on the Catholic Church began to
[12:45] focus on the worship of Mary and getting
[12:48] further from the worship of Jesus these
[12:53] are some of the key statements of
[12:55] scriptures that were made in our reading
[12:57] as
[12:57] were going through the salutation I love
[12:59] some of this brother branham says God's
[13:01] ministries are not in the power of men
[13:03] but of the Holy Ghost God's ministries
[13:07] and not end the power of men but of the
[13:10] Holy Ghost they also said this Paul set
[13:16] the church in order and taught the
[13:17] proper use of the gifts of the Spirit
[13:19] and confirmed that they were to remain
[13:22] in the Turk church till Jesus came now
[13:25] when I saw that I said Lord God
[13:27] everything that you promised in the
[13:30] Bible we want to see that in the church
[13:33] everything you promised the good thing
[13:36] about this statement is that Paul taught
[13:38] how supposed to be done in order and and
[13:41] I think what is happening over the over
[13:42] over time because things got out of
[13:44] order people just got away from the
[13:46] gifts but no the gifts are supposed to
[13:48] be in the church until Jesus come right
[13:51] so we should we should not be looking
[13:54] for anything less if they had it on
[13:56] impending at Pentecost we should be
[13:58] looking for the same thing right here
[14:00] these are the results that that the
[14:02] Spirit of God is supposed to produce the
[14:04] gifts are actually in the church in
[14:06] order to help keep the church in order
[14:08] yeah that's what gifts are for it helps
[14:10] keep the church in order and I tell you
[14:13] what like I remember coming up
[14:15] especially in the Pentecostal church
[14:17] gifts was all over the church when we
[14:20] were coming up Simmons in your life you
[14:23] know who might find that sin you know
[14:27] who could be some mother in the church
[14:28] could be the past it could be you didn't
[14:30] know who was gonna find it right and I
[14:33] but they would deal with it they did
[14:35] what they call pre you through you gonna
[14:38] get rid of that sin or you want to be
[14:40] coming back no more you know because the
[14:42] reason you wouldn't come back is because
[14:43] you wouldn't want to be embarrassed
[14:44] right that desk that's kind of the way
[14:47] it was but those gifts men they kept the
[14:49] church pure and that's what this photo
[14:52] do even right now now it's I don't I you
[14:55] know I think even gifts nowadays you
[14:58] know people want to use the gift to
[15:01] pronounce blessings well that's not you
[15:06] know you're not going to get a blessing
[15:08] all the time especially if citizen
[15:10] all right you can't expect that to get a
[15:13] blessing right but uh but the thing of
[15:16] it is is that people of you misuse the
[15:18] gifts but Paul Paul said to church in
[15:21] order and taught the proper use to the
[15:23] gifts of the Spirit and confirm that
[15:25] they would remain in the church until
[15:28] Jesus comes the church on I'm putting
[15:30] emphasis on it because that's what I
[15:32] that's what I pray for that's one of my
[15:35] expectations that's one of the
[15:38] objectives that's one of the goals
[15:40] that's why I worship in spirit and in
[15:42] truth a man church I mean I'm looking
[15:46] for the whole package not just part of
[15:49] it I welcome it and we know that it's
[15:52] not supposed to be out of order that
[15:53] that's why you're not even say when we
[15:54] have the our prayer time and we've come
[15:57] here at seven o'clock prayer meeting
[15:59] manage them if them gifts get loose turn
[16:01] it in that prayer they are welcome they
[16:04] are welcome at a time like that what
[16:06] Paul taught us that when we come
[16:07] together in a meeting like this that's
[16:10] where you know maybe the gifts don't go
[16:12] for it right in the middle somebody
[16:13] preaching at each and that's not how you
[16:14] do it but we all sitting around praying
[16:16] and you know just just you know calling
[16:19] up on God if you've got to give you out
[16:22] to be in the prayer in the prayer time
[16:24] you brother Branham said come early
[16:27] before everybody got there guess what
[16:29] that's coming too early come in get in
[16:31] prayer let God speak amen and I'm gonna
[16:34] tell you something I believe God gave
[16:37] somebody a gift of speaking in tongues
[16:38] he also get somebody else to gift of
[16:40] interpreter I believe he did that I
[16:43] think sometimes we just get if we get it
[16:45] fear friend and we get afraid to just
[16:47] allow just surrender ourselves to God
[16:49] and just allow God to do what he want to
[16:51] do that's what I think happens right we
[16:54] you know God the God savings were three
[16:57] hundreds of 65 times fear not don't get
[17:00] afraid of God I mean bit let's welcome
[17:01] him less less mindless Jesus you're
[17:05] welcome in this place look he also say
[17:08] this and bring this out seven spirits of
[17:11] God it was spoken up for time in the
[17:14] book of Revelation and that's revelation
[17:15] 14 revelation 31 revelation 45
[17:18] revelation 56 we'll get into that a
[17:20] little bit late
[17:22] but the seven spirits actually referred
[17:24] to one spirit of god working out the
[17:28] will and word of God and different
[17:30] generations and we look at this in
[17:32] Scripture and talk about the seven
[17:33] spirits of God that said these things
[17:36] saith he that hath the seven spirits of
[17:38] God we're talking about actually one
[17:41] spirit that's actually manifesting
[17:43] itself and different generations it's
[17:45] the same spirit manifests itself in
[17:47] different generations look at this any
[17:52] people that is truly the body of Jesus
[17:55] Christ the true church will manifest the
[17:59] same works as did Jesus I like that any
[18:04] people that is truly the body of Jesus
[18:06] Christ we heard that on sunday if the
[18:08] head make it in right if the head make
[18:12] it in the body has got to be coming
[18:14] you're never seen going across some
[18:16] finish line just ahead of somebody right
[18:20] the body's got to be connected to the
[18:21] head that's got to be coming somewhere
[18:23] so whatever you seen happen with the
[18:25] head the body has to follow right so if
[18:28] we see these things and I mean Jesus
[18:29] himself spoke in tongues don't know that
[18:32] Jesus spoke in tongues even on the cross
[18:36] you see where there was a state of me
[18:38] Eli sabak the knee that was tongs that
[18:43] was tongs right so I mean if Jesus
[18:46] himself did it why can't be praise the
[18:49] lord church already god I'm under
[18:54] expectation Lord you know sometimes God
[18:58] gets so good to you know you're one
[18:59] language ain't good enough to praise a
[19:01] man you know you you need a little bit
[19:03] motor you know the praising man so I
[19:08] tell you what I'm just under expectation
[19:11] church that's that's me and I'm gonna
[19:13] keep talking about and harping on it
[19:15] until I see God manifests himself the
[19:19] way that he promised to manifests
[19:20] himself a man all right let's go on any
[19:25] other church that does not have
[19:31] any other church that does not have the
[19:34] Spirit and the manifestations is going
[19:36] to have to account to God that means if
[19:38] we don't have it here we have the answer
[19:41] to God I don't want to answer to God
[19:46] saying that we couldn't get this done
[19:50] but I also don't want to go to God say
[19:53] we just created something that made it
[19:55] happen what I want to do is teach you
[19:59] and and keep everybody under expectation
[20:02] because this is what the the New
[20:04] Testament church is supposed to have
[20:06] right now now what happens that there's
[20:08] some churches all they did was focus on
[20:10] the tongs that's it we talked about all
[20:13] nine gifts wisdom knowledge tongues
[20:19] interpretation gifts of healing all that
[20:23] supposed to be in the body oh oh lord
[20:29] help me you know I think I told y'all
[20:33] about the sister that was a part of a
[20:34] church down in Miami she just felt led
[20:38] to go into hospital rules and pray for
[20:41] people that had cancer that was that was
[20:44] her minister she would go with a husband
[20:46] they were going just pray for people
[20:47] that had cancer and and sometimes why I
[20:50] believe happens that you'd go through
[20:52] certain things in your life and you
[20:53] begin to develop feelings you know for
[20:56] other people that might be going through
[20:57] the exact same thing right so if she's
[21:00] overcome cancer then she gets the
[21:02] feeling you know she's touched by the
[21:04] feeling of somebody else's infirmity and
[21:05] she wants to go out there and pray for
[21:07] them that you know what i want to
[21:08] encourage if God did it for me God can
[21:10] do it for you right but sometimes we
[21:13] just want to wait for you know pastor
[21:15] goodbye pray for him no you pray you go
[21:20] back you know why because these signs
[21:22] will follow them that believe not just
[21:24] the pastor but everybody in the church
[21:25] supposed to be able to do that glory God
[21:28] gonna hear your prayer trust me I know
[21:30] he will I know he will aid man i don't
[21:34] mind going but i wanna i want to make
[21:35] sure you went to pray to and i want to
[21:37] hit a testimony behind it alright last
[21:40] minute if the world takes over the
[21:42] spirit departs
[21:44] those are some key statements that we
[21:46] read here all right let's time go on
[21:49] here as we get into this the salutation
[21:51] there in Revelation 31 just a portion of
[21:55] that scripture says these things saith
[21:56] he that half the seven spirits of God
[22:01] now if you have your Bible I'm going to
[22:04] read for places right there in the book
[22:11] of revelation revelation 14 let's read
[22:14] that revelation 14 brother Branham said
[22:18] there was a this this this statement
[22:20] about the seven spirits was actually
[22:22] made four times in the book of
[22:24] Revelation so revelation 14 says this
[22:26] John to the seven churches which are an
[22:29] age of grace be unto you and peace from
[22:31] him which is and which was and which is
[22:33] to come and from the seven spirits which
[22:37] are before is thrown that's the first
[22:40] place we find it revelation 31 is the
[22:43] next place we find it where it says here
[22:46] and unto the Angel of the church in
[22:48] Sardis write these things says he that
[22:50] have the seven spirits of God and the
[22:53] seven stars I know that works that thou
[22:56] art thou has to name that thou Libous
[22:58] and are dead revelation 4 and 5 let's
[23:04] read that it says this and out of the
[23:07] throne proceeded lightnings and
[23:09] thunderings and voices and there were
[23:10] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[23:12] throne which are the seven spirits of
[23:16] God now on that that that scripture
[23:21] right there that scripture revelation 45
[23:24] brother Branham was preaching a sermon
[23:28] my I can't think of the name of this but
[23:32] it was it was a sermon I think on the
[23:35] book of Revelation I forget exactly what
[23:36] the title sermon but there was a
[23:38] statement made when he was focusing on
[23:41] that scripture and the statement that
[23:43] may I grew up in the message hearing it
[23:46] all the time but the statements made
[23:48] what jeffersonville needs is thousands
[23:52] of live voices thundering out in
[23:54] sweetness of humility well brother
[23:56] Branham made that
[23:57] statement based on that scripture right
[24:00] there revelation 45 you made that
[24:02] statement based on that scripture what
[24:04] Jeffersonville needs and we said you
[24:06] know not just Jeffersonville but even
[24:07] West Palm Beach you know wherever the
[24:10] product Christ we need thousands of live
[24:12] voice Thunder live voices Thunder now
[24:15] and sweetness and humility a man also
[24:18] here revelation five and six revelation
[24:22] five and six this is the last place
[24:25] where it talks about these seven spirits
[24:27] here and it says this and I beheld a low
[24:30] and the midst of the throne and of the
[24:32] four beasts and in the midst of the
[24:34] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[24:36] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[24:39] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[24:42] into all the earth just so that you just
[24:47] just to give you a quick summary 27 eyes
[24:50] represent the seven messengers alright
[24:52] so the seven messengers would also
[24:54] represent the seven spirits of God when
[24:56] you looked at that scripture to seven
[24:58] horns actually represent the seven
[25:00] Church ages and the seven church ages
[25:03] would represent those people that are
[25:04] protecting the word of the Lord they're
[25:07] protecting the word of the Lord our
[25:10] lives are protecting the word of the
[25:12] Lord to aid man all right so i want to i
[25:16] think i want to let me see something
[25:22] here i'd like to read a quote here this
[25:28] is going to be on page 248 starting at
[25:31] paragraph five in your church age book
[25:48] let's see here
[25:56] it says this to begin with scroll down
[25:59] just a little bit on that Yeah right
[26:02] there to begin with we know for
[26:05] certainty that these verses are not
[26:06] teaching a new and contrary doctrine so
[26:08] to script the verses that we just went
[26:10] through revelation alone' revelation 3
[26:12] revelation for revolution 5 it says that
[26:15] it began with we know for certain that
[26:16] these verses are not teaching a new and
[26:18] contrary doctrine to John 424 Part A
[26:21] which says God is a are one spirit God
[26:25] is a spirit but this is like first
[26:27] Corinthians 12 verse 8 through 11 where
[26:29] and we find one spirit manifest himself
[26:32] and nine ways praise god that's the
[26:35] gifts of the Spirit thus we know that
[26:37] the seven spirits of God mean it is the
[26:39] one and the same spirit coming forth in
[26:42] a Sevenfold way now revelation 45 the
[26:45] same seven spirits are called lamps of
[26:48] fire burning before the Lord since John
[26:51] always use nothing but old testament
[26:53] symbols and the revelation we we go to
[26:56] the Old Testament and fine from proverbs
[26:58] 20 and verse 27 that the spirit of man
[27:01] is the lamp of the Lord these seven
[27:05] spirits are found to be associated with
[27:07] man John the Baptist and John 535 was
[27:10] called a burning light which should
[27:12] actually be translated as burning lamp
[27:15] again in Revelation five six to seven
[27:17] spirits are identified at seven eyes and
[27:20] Zechariah 4 10 4 who have despise the
[27:23] day of small things for they shall
[27:25] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[27:27] handles of ruby bell with those 77 they
[27:31] are the eyes of the Lord it is very
[27:33] evident that the word they refers to men
[27:36] thus we see that the eyes of the Lord
[27:39] and this instance are men of course they
[27:41] will be anointed men full of the Holy
[27:44] Ghost for God's ministries are not in
[27:47] the power of men but of the Holy Ghost
[27:49] putting our scriptural discoveries
[27:51] together it is evident that the seven
[27:54] spirits of God refer to the continuous
[27:56] Ministry of the same Holy Spirit and the
[27:59] lives of seven men with whom God
[28:01] identifies himself very closely they are
[28:05] his eyes they are his lamps they who
[28:08] who these seven men are can easily be
[28:11] seen because the next phrase calls them
[28:13] the seven stars which are already known
[28:15] to us as the seven messengers to the
[28:17] seven ages how beautiful that is see the
[28:20] star was meant to reflect light at night
[28:22] for the Sun has gone for the Sun has
[28:26] gone just so the messenger typify daz a
[28:29] star to each age was to reflect the
[28:31] light of the Sun they all did this by
[28:34] the Holy Spirit all right we'll just
[28:38] we'll stop there so what we got here
[28:40] we'll go back to our slide I just I
[28:43] brought out that scripture there on the
[28:46] spot where said the spirit of man is the
[28:48] lamp of the Lord searching all the inner
[28:50] depths of his heart brother branham just
[28:53] made it very clear sit here you're going
[28:58] to have to click Next warm in here what
[29:00] he made it very clear on their step
[29:03] putting it says putting our scriptural
[29:05] discoveries together as evident that the
[29:07] seven spirits of God referred to the
[29:09] continuous minister the same Holy Spirit
[29:11] and the lives of seven men with whom God
[29:13] identifies himself very closely so when
[29:16] we look at the seven spirits there
[29:18] according to Revelation 31 or even the
[29:21] other scriptures that you looked at that
[29:22] we looked at in a book of Revelation
[29:24] when we talk about the seven spirits of
[29:25] God we're talking about one continuous
[29:28] spirit that anointed seven different man
[29:30] for seven different generations or seven
[29:33] different church ages but it was the
[29:34] same spirit annoying each one the same
[29:36] Holy Spirit unknown each one of them to
[29:38] get the job done for that age gave them
[29:41] a ministry that was if I you know I have
[29:46] to use it this way gave them a ministry
[29:48] that far surpassed the other ministries
[29:50] in their day amen you know and brother
[29:54] branham's case he had a ministry that
[29:57] yes there were many other people out
[29:59] front praying for the sick many people
[30:02] doing a lot of things but I tell you
[30:04] what when it when it came to you know
[30:06] he's calling out things in people's
[30:09] lives my never been to the city before
[30:13] don't know anything about it but never
[30:14] even been in this country for speech
[30:17] spot-on with what he was saying only God
[30:20] could do it
[30:21] only God could do that I was listening
[30:24] to a tape today and just listen to him
[30:26] you know just standing there talking to
[30:28] the system say it's a night if I told
[30:30] you something else about yourself with
[30:31] that give you a little bit more
[30:32] confidence than when I'm saying he told
[30:34] her what was wrong with it and then it
[30:36] said would that give you a little bit
[30:37] more confidence then after he told her
[30:38] what was wrong with her it kept talking
[30:40] then he said now what's wrong with you
[30:42] the actor what's wrong with her because
[30:45] of what he was trying to get her to see
[30:46] it's not me telling you it's the holy
[30:48] spirit telling you threw me right I mean
[30:51] but but here he said he said that's
[30:52] right you got you got stomach trouble
[30:54] you got stomach trouble something like
[30:55] that then then he just kept talking to
[30:57] her kept talking to her Demi you know
[30:59] told about I was just praying for love
[31:01] winning odds of things a high note how
[31:03] would he be able to see that and then
[31:05] one person after the next profound the
[31:07] next person coming through the line so
[31:09] that minister was at a different level
[31:10] it was that a totally different level
[31:12] and and if we can't recognize God in
[31:15] that something wrong so I'm wrong we
[31:18] miss it somewhere it just I'm sorry it
[31:23] was it was too many right even if I
[31:26] could one brother even showed me a quote
[31:28] where brother branham got one of them
[31:29] wrong he got one of them wrong and but
[31:34] what would have happened I think he
[31:35] called a person last name they last name
[31:40] was oh my i think the last name was
[31:46] strong but he used a different different
[31:48] name because of what he saw in the
[31:50] vision was a person with a muscle and so
[31:53] he said you know you your last name is
[31:57] this but it was it should have been
[31:59] strong or something along those lines I
[32:01] said brother I'm sorry I i still believe
[32:04] you know I mean cuz ain't nobody else
[32:07] saying no vision with nobody knows no
[32:09] nothing like that then have to turn
[32:10] around interpret what that vision sent
[32:12] in tellapur that's I'm sorry I still
[32:14] believe you know no matter what people
[32:16] try to bring up a produce it's just I
[32:19] see too much God in it to deny that that
[32:23] that this was God I see too much God in
[32:25] it right we had a we had a genuine
[32:27] profit church and like I'm telling you
[32:29] these seven stars b7 ministry seven
[32:32] spirits
[32:33] the same spirit of god and seven
[32:35] different men but God anointed them
[32:36] especially for that age in which they
[32:39] were living especially for that age yeah
[32:41] very specific purpose for doing so all
[32:43] right let's go on to this next so the
[32:47] notice to the seven stars are the seven
[32:49] spirits is in his hand I want to kind of
[32:52] bring that out right here these seven
[32:55] stars are in his hand and the other
[32:59] thing I want you to see this Jesus hand
[33:01] that's holding the sparks it's Jesus
[33:04] Jesus is behind this you can't tell
[33:07] Jesus we can use and who he can't use
[33:11] you can't tell that to Jesus they are in
[33:14] his hand if these these pictures are
[33:17] kind of faded here but actually this is
[33:20] a picture of paul aranea sand and all
[33:23] the different messengers all the way up
[33:25] to you know a brother branham here but
[33:27] these are the seven messengers and you
[33:31] know just just kind of showing depicting
[33:33] what you know what this whole thing was
[33:35] all about the seven stars the seven
[33:37] spirits are in his hand they've noticed
[33:39] the hand means that it signifies the
[33:42] power and authority of God they have the
[33:44] power and authority of God if you all
[33:47] remember Paul when he was talking
[33:51] American divorce Paul made the comment
[33:55] he said this is not this is not the Lord
[33:58] but I there in the book of the
[34:01] Corinthians that this is not the Lord
[34:03] but I now do you realize that God
[34:07] allowed that man to put his but I in the
[34:10] scripture for us to base our faith on
[34:13] when we talk about somebody got the
[34:15] power and authority of God God stands
[34:17] behind that but I and and don't don't
[34:19] let that don't let that throw you off
[34:21] because all the way back in the Old
[34:23] Testament with the prophet Samuel
[34:25] there's a scripture that actually said
[34:27] as a prophet any person that was that
[34:30] was that God called as a prophet God
[34:32] would not let one word from that profits
[34:35] mouth fall to the ground everything that
[34:37] the prophets that got on earn it oh my
[34:40] god honors
[34:43] we gonna have to honor it now if God
[34:48] gave Paul that kind of that kind of
[34:50] authority that he could put it in the
[34:51] scripture I remember when brother
[34:53] branham I'm talking about marriage and
[34:55] divorce and it comes down off the
[34:57] mountains that God gave me a word for
[34:59] the people that's Authority y'all this
[35:03] man had had people that he hadn't even
[35:08] that wasn't even on the earth yet that
[35:11] would be here be responsible for what he
[35:13] said and what they would pick up off
[35:14] that tape church that's pretty that's
[35:16] somewhat that's some Authority right
[35:18] they the hands signify the power and the
[35:21] authority of God you know when brother
[35:24] branham made those comments there and
[35:25] say you know I'm just telling going sin
[35:26] no more then teach your kids they're
[35:28] going to do anything like this they say
[35:30] some of y'all and these conditions
[35:31] because you weren't taught they say but
[35:33] you teach your kids never do nothing
[35:34] like this that was something that was
[35:36] you say God just like God gave Paul the
[35:39] ability to say something his day he gave
[35:40] Moses did Billy say something in this
[35:42] day God has given me the same ability to
[35:44] say something to my people and my damn
[35:46] power and authority of God oh my mm-hmm
[35:53] listen the gospel is preached by the
[35:57] authority of God in the power of the
[35:59] Spirit so these men were all empowered
[36:03] by the Holy Ghost and they all stood up
[36:05] to the world you know you can't help but
[36:09] see that in Luther's ministry man he
[36:13] stood up against the Catholic Church and
[36:15] I believe every one of those uh I mean I
[36:19] Paul standing up against what the the
[36:21] Jews were doing in that day and how they
[36:23] rejected crises stood up against it so
[36:25] you're going to always find that these
[36:26] these these ministers they'll stand up
[36:29] against the world he lodged in his day
[36:31] stood up against jazzy Belle right so
[36:34] the same spirit today that would be a
[36:36] pun brother branham a stand up against
[36:37] denominational Jezebel praise the Lord
[36:40] they were sent or authorized by God not
[36:45] by self or other men they were sent or
[36:49] authorized by God not myself
[36:51] other men if you again you go back and
[36:53] read brother branham's life you know
[36:55] that it was an angel or that called him
[36:56] and I got him to do what what he was
[36:59] doing he would try to run even even when
[37:02] he tried to kill himself God would not
[37:03] allow it God was not allowed multiple
[37:06] times he tried to kill himself but God
[37:08] would not allowed he belong to God his
[37:11] life was in the hand of Jesus and can i
[37:14] tell you something your life is also in
[37:17] the hand of Jesus praise the Lord listen
[37:21] organization is def organization is def
[37:27] if it's any church that's organized i'm
[37:30] gonna i can speak even in the message i
[37:35] have seen people try to organize and
[37:38] i've watched it die I people have tried
[37:43] to build a own little kingdoms they all
[37:45] look you know programs that they had
[37:48] different people following it and I mean
[37:51] arrange certain ministers I watched all
[37:53] that and I've watched it come to a it
[37:57] just dies breaks up falls apart and it
[38:01] just nothing nothing nothing comes out
[38:04] of it organization is death it just
[38:08] can't be any other way if the world
[38:10] takes over the spirit departs if the
[38:13] world takes over the spirit departs now
[38:15] hear of this this quote says the
[38:18] scripture says yet in a little while
[38:19] Jesus says this is john 14 19 yet a
[38:22] little while and the world sees me no
[38:24] more but ye see me because I live ye
[38:28] shall live also because I live ye shall
[38:31] live also now i want to i'm going to
[38:33] bring out a little quote here on this
[38:35] but then i want to go to our church age
[38:36] book and read something else and this
[38:39] this is a quote from the message jehovah
[38:41] jireh it says a little while in the
[38:43] world sees me no more the world there
[38:45] the greek word cosmos which means World
[38:48] Order sees me no more yet ye shall see
[38:52] me for I I being a personal pronoun I'll
[38:55] be with you even in you to the end of
[38:57] the world making Jesus Christ the same
[38:59] yesterday today and forever he remains
[39:02] he raised from the dead
[39:03] the world that unbelievable want see me
[39:06] they won't recognize it but the believer
[39:09] will recognize him because he's the same
[39:12] Jesus that he always was he hasn't
[39:14] changed the same yesterday today and
[39:16] forever now let's stop pick up this
[39:19] quote out of our church age book page
[39:21] 251 in the church age book there's
[39:24] something here that brother Brandon
[39:25] brought to us that we want to we want to
[39:28] get up we want to get this true so page
[39:30] 251 in the church age book it says this
[39:35] says now they had what the world could
[39:40] not have jesus said that when he went
[39:44] away he would send his spirit which the
[39:47] world could not receive that is right
[39:49] the world or world systems could not
[39:52] receive him that is what organization is
[39:54] it is world system showed me a world
[39:56] system church that is full of the Holy
[39:59] Ghost I want to see it if you can show
[40:01] me such a church you have finding a
[40:03] mistake in the word no sir not one of
[40:06] these messengers was organized either
[40:08] either they were put out or got out now
[40:14] what a statement the you know that's
[40:15] made there they were either put out or
[40:18] got out because they were they were
[40:21] convicted of the sin of organization how
[40:26] can the Holy Spirit possibly be in an
[40:28] organization when it is organization
[40:31] that takes the place of the Spirit and
[40:33] denominations take the place of the word
[40:35] remember organization is death it just
[40:38] can't be any other way if the world
[40:40] takes over the spirit departs I know
[40:46] that um that statement that he made
[40:48] their that either people were put out or
[40:51] they got out you remember and the
[40:56] brother branham was coming up and they
[41:00] in the baptist church and they wanted
[41:02] him to I think of ordeno a woman
[41:04] minister he said no I can't do it
[41:06] because I don't see that in the
[41:07] scripture and the pastor to him to
[41:12] either he got to do it or he going to
[41:13] lose his license you say i don't mind
[41:15] giving you my license right now
[41:16] you know because I don't see that in
[41:18] Scripture these you see the same spirit
[41:21] that was in martin luther nailed his 95
[41:25] theses to the catholic church door he
[41:27] got out he got out right when they when
[41:30] they got convicted by what they saw in
[41:32] the word they left the organization
[41:33] alone and they stayed with the word of
[41:36] God so you're going to get put out or
[41:38] you're going to get out amen amen I am a
[41:43] personal witness either you're gonna get
[41:47] put out or you're gonna get down I'm a
[41:50] personal witness if you're not going
[41:52] along what they doing you're going to
[41:54] get put out or you're going to get out
[41:56] one of the other hey ma'am there are
[41:59] many days I would come home ready to get
[42:01] out many of these but eventually I was
[42:05] just put out amen I'm a personal witness
[42:09] I'm gonna tell you I tell you anybody
[42:12] standing for this to put a true standard
[42:14] for this word you just you watch you're
[42:17] going to come to that same spot where
[42:18] you either get put out are you going to
[42:20] get out on your own you get out because
[42:22] you just can't take no more of it you
[42:24] see all the different things that's
[42:26] going on like this is not of god I
[42:27] cannot take any more of it organization
[42:30] typically breeds that you see what the
[42:32] Spirit of God has has actually been
[42:35] moved out or do you know people just now
[42:39] when I said that it's a good act that
[42:45] people can put on Pharisees actors they
[42:50] can they can act like they love you they
[42:53] can act like you know they can act like
[42:55] Christians to you know my god that it
[42:58] just it's a big act but you stay around
[43:00] long enough you're going to realize that
[43:02] nothing to this ain't nothing to this
[43:05] these people will do you is my god that
[43:10] do you think the world of do you bad
[43:11] sometimes the church can do your worst
[43:14] hey man and we'll never even apologized
[43:17] about it praise the Lord church and
[43:21] ain't number the truth I tell you what
[43:23] you stick around long enough just like
[43:25] these messengers I believe any seed of
[43:27] God
[43:28] we'll see with an organization you're
[43:30] going to get either get put out are you
[43:32] going to get out because of your how
[43:34] different you are a man we're the bride
[43:38] of Jesus Christ we can't help but be
[43:40] different amen all right let's go a
[43:42] little further so this is a statement
[43:48] that the brother brandon made says so we
[43:50] see that the seven spirits actually
[43:52] refer to the one spirit of god working
[43:54] out the wheel and the word of god in
[43:57] different generations we're talking
[44:00] about the seven spirits of God that's
[44:01] the salutation of this our vision church
[44:03] H says these things saith he that hath
[44:07] the seven spirits of God so we're
[44:09] talking about the seven spirits of God
[44:11] it's one spirit working out the will of
[44:15] God and the Word of God in different
[44:18] generations brother branham gives a type
[44:22] of this and our reading and he talked
[44:26] about how we can look at the spirit of
[44:30] Elijah it was the same spirit but
[44:35] manifested five different times in the
[44:37] scripture benefits of five different
[44:40] times in the scripture you know four
[44:42] different generations oh my i was having
[44:48] lunch this week with big brother george
[44:51] smith brother branham son-in-law and as
[44:54] we were sitting there talking it told me
[44:57] when he went to Israel a couple times
[44:59] you know he went over and he got a
[45:01] particular tour guide that would just
[45:03] kind of take them around and this guy he
[45:08] he began to look at the group that was
[45:11] that was with brother George II noticed
[45:13] it the way that they were dressed and
[45:15] just different things about them having
[45:16] conducted and carrot themselves and so
[45:20] he just was just looking at him and he
[45:22] said you know usually I different groups
[45:25] come over they try to baptize me in the
[45:27] Jordan River and they try to you know
[45:29] get me to do this and get me doing it
[45:30] they got all kind of beliefs you know
[45:33] and they try not they're trying to
[45:34] convert me you know he's a he's a Jew
[45:36] living there in Israel but they trying
[45:38] to convert me I'm just here trying to
[45:39] give people tour you know
[45:41] trying to convert me and he said now I
[45:44] look at all these groups he say and he
[45:46] said he said I'm he gave everybody
[45:48] instructions that you know you go do
[45:49] this you go do that you your room is
[45:51] over here your rooms over there you say
[45:53] but you you point it brother George and
[45:55] said you come with me and I said he said
[45:58] I've been watching y'all he said watched
[46:00] all these other groups but I've been
[46:02] watching our cigna tell me what what's
[46:04] different about y'all what's going on
[46:05] about y'all he said I want to know
[46:07] because I know it's something different
[46:08] about you and brother George same how we
[46:11] know I really don't know how to answer
[46:14] said no no no I know it's something
[46:16] different about you tell me what's going
[46:17] on they say he said cap tell you what he
[46:21] said he said brother George said he
[46:25] noticed as he went into some of the
[46:27] Jewish homes they would have dinner or
[46:30] or like a feast or something like that
[46:33] and say in every home they always had
[46:35] one empty chair in that empty chair they
[46:40] would leave there while they had their
[46:41] meal and then at a certain time of the
[46:43] mill the oldest boy would actually get
[46:46] up leave the tape and go open the front
[46:48] door of the home and the reason that
[46:51] that ball would do that because they had
[46:52] a not just a tradition but they had a
[46:55] belief that Elijah was going to come so
[46:58] they had an open chair waiting for you
[47:00] Elijah this is what they were doing so
[47:03] brother brother George took him back to
[47:05] that you know and they say Sigma you
[47:07] know how y'all waiting on the Elijah he
[47:09] said what y'all was promised for Eli
[47:11] mean they larger the spirit of logical
[47:13] to come to y'all four times but it's
[47:15] full to come to us once as Gentiles and
[47:17] they saying it's already coming going
[47:19] hey saying happen to be my father in
[47:22] lofts so that's what make us different
[47:27] we would both waiting on the Elijah they
[47:30] say but Elijah has already come to us
[47:32] and already coming and going and say
[47:33] he'd happen to be on my father-in-law's
[47:34] okay I need some more information about
[47:36] this he said i neva know nothing about
[47:37] for cummins of elijah so that jewish man
[47:41] began to look at that and look at that
[47:42] and history and as brother George was
[47:45] leaving and say you got any more
[47:46] information I can have you say yeah at
[47:48] an mp3 player gave it to him brother
[47:50] branham's message on it
[47:51] and that jewish man is sitting over in
[47:53] Israel listening to the prophets message
[47:55] and he heard it brother George said the
[47:57] tape up at a certain spot where brother
[47:59] branham was it was actually given a
[48:02] description of what what certain places
[48:05] in Israel look like and as he was given
[48:07] the description on the tape this man
[48:09] will heard it and he acts for the trophy
[48:11] say has this man never been here to
[48:13] Israel before he said because he's
[48:15] describing exactly the way it's supposed
[48:16] to be he said he'd never been here he
[48:19] said he's telling exactly what this
[48:21] place looks like he never went one time
[48:23] one day that's like the vision preaching
[48:26] by vision brother brother brother George
[48:33] was just you know blown away and this
[48:35] man is like 80 years old now and it's
[48:37] still doing tours i pray that i get a
[48:41] chance to to go on a tour with him you
[48:43] know but he's just been absolutely moved
[48:45] you know by this by this message so what
[48:49] we see here when we talk about the seven
[48:50] spirits of God according to Revelation
[48:52] 31 we can see the same thing happen with
[48:57] the spirit of Elijah if you notice there
[48:59] that's a picture of Elijah being caught
[49:02] up by the chariots you know the horse
[49:06] chariot of fire and and there is
[49:08] throwing this mantle back down to your
[49:09] life shop because in the remember Elijah
[49:12] asked to say look they say what do you
[49:14] all say you're like a large axe whatever
[49:16] you wanna say I want to double portion
[49:17] of your spirit that's what he asks for a
[49:20] double portion of the earth sweet said
[49:22] that's a hard thing you say but
[49:23] nevertheless if you see me when I go
[49:25] you'll get a double portion of my spirit
[49:27] if you go back in Scripture you see
[49:29] Elijah did eight miracles Elijah did 16
[49:34] miracles he had a double portion of the
[49:36] spirit of Elijah amen well that same
[49:42] spirit was promised a John the Baptist
[49:49] was also stabbed that same spirit and
[49:51] we'll pick this up in Scripture are
[49:52] giving the scriptures but John the
[49:55] Baptist was supposed to have that same
[49:56] spirit and actually you all turn in your
[50:00] Bible to Luke 117
[50:19] Luke 117 says this actually since we got
[50:30] our Bibles up let's just start at verse
[50:31] 13 but the angel said unto him fear not
[50:35] Zechariah for that prayer is heard and
[50:37] my wife Elizabeth should bear thee a son
[50:38] thou shalt call his name John and thou
[50:41] shalt have joy and gladness and many
[50:43] shall rejoice at his birth for he shall
[50:46] be great in the sight of the Lord and
[50:48] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[50:50] drink now you know when I read that for
[50:52] myself remember the Brandon drink wine
[50:54] strong drink the the angel told him
[50:57] don't don't defile himself in any way
[50:59] don't do that well that one no odd voice
[51:03] that was a scripture voice John was to
[51:05] the exact same thing right he couldn't
[51:07] drink wine nor strong drink and he shall
[51:10] be filled the Holy Ghost even from his
[51:12] mother's womb and many of the children
[51:14] of Israel shall he turned to the Lord
[51:17] their God listen here verse 17 Asia go
[51:20] before him and the spirit and power of
[51:23] Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[51:26] father's to the children and the
[51:29] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[51:30] make ready a people prepared for the
[51:34] Lord so John the Baptist was supposed to
[51:36] have that spirit on him the spirit of
[51:39] Elijah so we talked about the seven
[51:41] spirits of God it's the same spirit
[51:43] working out God's will and actually
[51:47] fulfilling God's work for that
[51:48] generation it's the same thing that
[51:49] happened with the spirit of Elijah that
[51:51] came at different times here according
[51:54] to Scripture it came upon Elijah pic in
[51:56] plenty Lijah not a third time we find it
[51:59] on John the Baptist well there's a
[52:01] promise here one day that same spirit
[52:04] identify by the same manner of ministry
[52:06] would come upon a man for the end of the
[52:08] Gentile Church age well we found that to
[52:11] be William Branham and that's Malik I
[52:14] four five and six
[52:16] and i just gave you Luke 117 let's go to
[52:18] Malik aathma very familiar scriptures
[52:21] that we are very familiar like I could
[52:25] tell you when I was in I was raised
[52:28] Baptist I cannot remember one we went to
[52:31] church all the time but I cannot
[52:34] remember one service where the pastor
[52:36] ever read from the book of Malachi maybe
[52:39] to talk about ty maybe everybody go to
[52:45] Malachi 3 but a day does go over one
[52:47] more chapter there's a promise there
[52:50] that got put in Scripture that would be
[52:52] very helpful for us to recognize where
[52:55] we are today here in verse 5 but I will
[52:58] send you Elijah the Prophet this is a
[53:01] promise from god I'm going to send you
[53:04] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[53:05] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[53:07] now we know that this is specifically
[53:10] talking about end time in time scripture
[53:14] because John the Baptist ministry did
[53:16] not come before the dreadful date of the
[53:18] Lord all right but this would be for the
[53:21] second coming of the Lord and notice
[53:23] also in verse 6 says that he should turn
[53:25] the heart of the father's to the
[53:26] children that's exactly what John did
[53:28] and that's what revelry I mean Luke 117
[53:31] said he did however it goes on to say
[53:34] this and the heart of the children to
[53:37] their fathers it didn't say John did it
[53:40] didn't say that according to Luke 117 so
[53:42] that was left for this in time that
[53:45] portion of scripture had to be fulfilled
[53:46] in the end time before the second coming
[53:49] of Christ and we have identified william
[53:53] branham as a person that fulfilled that
[53:55] if the scripture identified John the
[53:58] Baptist and we can call this name and
[54:00] show that John the Baptist did that all
[54:03] we don't have to be afraid to call
[54:05] brother branham's name because it's
[54:07] ministry also fulfill these things in my
[54:11] list it says this the heart of the Lord
[54:13] the heart of children to the to their
[54:15] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[54:17] with a curse that is another coming of
[54:23] the spirit of Elijah and the fifth
[54:27] coming
[54:28] is right here and this and the two
[54:33] witnesses and it's actually a larger
[54:35] coming back himself it's not just the
[54:38] spirit of Elijah but its logic comes up
[54:40] that's why you see in the picture Elijah
[54:42] was caught up like a rapture took place
[54:44] for Elijah but God preserved him for
[54:46] he's coming back for a greater I mean a
[54:50] greater work and a greater time and
[54:52] that's after the rapture of the Gentile
[54:55] bride then God against the deal with the
[54:58] juice you find that in the book of
[55:01] Revelation chapter 11 verse 3 through 6
[55:03] now when you're going to look at
[55:05] revelation 11 verse 3 through 6 you will
[55:08] not see the name the Elijah you won't
[55:12] see that it's not there and there's many
[55:16] people still debating as to who are the
[55:19] two witnesses some say Enoch and Elijah
[55:22] some say Moses is Enoch they got all
[55:25] kind of things but the way that you're
[55:27] able to tell who the two witnesses are
[55:29] you can look at their ministries and
[55:31] their ministries tell you what their
[55:34] names are glory to God a man and all you
[55:38] got to do is trace it back in Scripture
[55:40] you see what Elijah did you see what
[55:41] Moses did now you got a clear picture as
[55:44] to who the two witnesses are so when we
[55:49] talk about the seven spirits of God if
[55:51] you want clarity on that you know think
[55:53] about this five cummings of the spirit
[55:55] of Elijah it was the same spirit
[55:57] anointing men at different times for a
[56:01] very specific work guess what the same
[56:03] thing the seven spirits of God it was
[56:04] the same spirit of god Norton seven
[56:07] different men at seven different times
[56:08] for a very specific work that the Lord
[56:11] needed time praise the Lord hallelujah
[56:16] alright this quote says yes the spirit
[56:23] is not seven spirits but one he will
[56:28] always be the same and act the same and
[56:31] the seven messengers will have the same
[56:34] spirit and teach the same word and have
[56:37] the same power and if the church is the
[56:40] true church it will have
[56:41] the very same spirit and word and acts
[56:44] of power that they had at Pentecost by
[56:46] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[56:49] church and there will be tongues I'm
[56:53] saying a man today there will be tongues
[56:57] and interpretation and prophecy and
[57:00] healings and we've already seen the
[57:03] healing part we've seen that and we've
[57:06] seen you know different ones that were
[57:08] speaking tongues we've seen
[57:09] interpretation we've had that happen
[57:10] here the one thing that I would say is
[57:13] that uh you know I just I feel like if
[57:15] we would just allow the Lord to to use
[57:19] this it might happen a little bit more a
[57:22] man but it has happened you just want to
[57:26] see it you know God you welcome to come
[57:28] here anytime every time we get together
[57:30] you're welcome to come in here right we
[57:32] just want to see that we just want God
[57:34] to have his way in this place that's
[57:36] that's that's all I want a man a man by
[57:39] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[57:40] church and there will be tongues and
[57:43] interpretation and prophecy and healings
[57:46] God will be in the midst of her and God
[57:48] would declare himself in the midst of
[57:50] her as he always has hallelujah and she
[57:52] will be unorganized don't forget that
[57:57] praise the Lord praise the Lord all
[58:01] right let's go on a couple more slides
[58:02] here and we'll be bringing this to a
[58:05] close
[58:11] so in this let's see here yeah I do have
[58:27] a quote that I want to read on this
[58:29] particular slide this is our page 251
[58:34] paragraph 3 in your church age book page
[58:39] 251 paragraph 3 on this slide the
[58:46] Prophet says this is as now we can we
[58:48] can see that Jesus Christ is revealing
[58:51] himself through the ages by his Spirit
[58:53] in the messengers they are as Moses was
[58:56] to children Israel as he had the
[59:00] revelation for his day so each messenger
[59:03] had God's revelation and ministry for
[59:05] that day thus when we see that the
[59:07] messengers are in his hand we see the
[59:09] Lord identified himself with these men
[59:11] and granting them its power it is not
[59:14] enough that he has associated himself
[59:16] with the whole church which we saw when
[59:20] he was seen standing amongst the seven
[59:22] golden lampstands nor is it enough that
[59:25] we see the fivefold ministry of
[59:27] Ephesians four apostles prophets
[59:29] teachers evangelists pastors four in
[59:32] each age the church goes astray and it
[59:37] is not just the lady but the clergy
[59:40] group Shepherd's are wrong as well as
[59:43] sheep that's a powerful statement
[59:45] Shepherd's are wrong as well as she then
[59:48] God brings himself on the scene as the
[59:51] chief Shepherd in the ministries of
[59:53] these seven men to lead his people back
[59:56] to the truth and the abundant power of
[59:58] that truth that was thus that was really
[1:00:01] the sole purpose of having these seven
[1:00:03] spirits released at different times it
[1:00:05] was God anointing that man with the
[1:00:07] ministry to bring the people back to the
[1:00:10] truth of the word of God that was a
[1:00:12] whole purpose it was not for people to
[1:00:14] exalt the man it was God using the man
[1:00:16] to bring the people back to the truth
[1:00:18] see that's what that's what the Malachi
[1:00:20] 4 said it would turn their hearts of the
[1:00:23] children back to the fathers was that
[1:00:24] mean
[1:00:25] our hearts back to the word of the Lord
[1:00:27] a man hallelujah listen God is at his
[1:00:32] people all of his people but if any man
[1:00:35] has not the Spirit of Christ he is none
[1:00:37] of his can I just interject something
[1:00:39] I'm a move on here in a second even when
[1:00:42] in a church when we try to bring
[1:00:44] correction a lot of times people don't
[1:00:47] want to hear what the prophets in there
[1:00:49] they'll say don't shove me with the
[1:00:50] property at this should look at the
[1:00:51] Bible say well I don't show you what
[1:00:54] both of them saying right because the
[1:00:56] Prophet actually gave you the
[1:00:57] interpretation of what the Bible said so
[1:00:59] you have there you'll be very clear as
[1:01:01] to what God expects and again that
[1:01:04] wasn't to try to you know to the
[1:01:07] ministry don't use that in order to try
[1:01:09] to force people into a certain another
[1:01:11] yeah that's not what it's all about but
[1:01:13] the Prophet bro brought clarity so that
[1:01:15] we wouldn't know what God was thinking
[1:01:17] about these things a lot of things that
[1:01:20] we just didn't know what God was
[1:01:21] thinking we know you that's why we got
[1:01:23] so there's so many different
[1:01:24] denominations everybody had a different
[1:01:26] thought on that Scripture but when a
[1:01:28] private gives you know this is what God
[1:01:30] was really saying that's why we say
[1:01:32] let's quote what the prophecy stable
[1:01:34] with the prophecy a man listen when
[1:01:37] Moses left the scene jascha was quoted
[1:01:40] what Moses said but Joshua was saying
[1:01:43] exactly what Moses saying he wasn't
[1:01:46] changing it because God had vindicated
[1:01:48] Moses and the same God that vindicated
[1:01:51] Moses vindicated william branham today
[1:01:54] and you know Joshua went exalted Moses
[1:01:57] that one that wasn't it just like we're
[1:01:59] not exhausting brother branham but when
[1:02:01] you got clarity as to what God has done
[1:02:03] in this hour then your heart is open to
[1:02:06] just receive the word a man listen all
[1:02:11] of his people for freedom has not the
[1:02:13] Spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:02:15] he is the word that would be the word
[1:02:16] recognizing the people but he has a he
[1:02:19] has placed a special leadership in these
[1:02:21] men of his own choosing and through the
[1:02:23] determining counsel of his own will they
[1:02:25] appear once in each age it is the same
[1:02:28] spirit in them what a far cry is this
[1:02:31] from the here see of Rome they have a
[1:02:34] man of their own choosing one after the
[1:02:37] other
[1:02:39] non-producing the power of God none of
[1:02:41] Baden in the Word of God each one
[1:02:44] different from the one before him and
[1:02:47] adding what He desires as though he were
[1:02:50] God God is not in it but he is in his
[1:02:53] messengers and he who would have the
[1:02:57] fullness of God would follow the
[1:02:58] messengers as the messenger is a
[1:03:00] follower of the Lord by his word let me
[1:03:03] say that again but he is in his
[1:03:05] messenger and he who would have the
[1:03:07] fullness of god that means if you want
[1:03:09] the fullness of God you will follow the
[1:03:11] messenger as a messenger is a follower
[1:03:14] of the Lord by his burg as many people
[1:03:16] trying to get the fullest of God but
[1:03:18] trying to exclude the Prophet not gonna
[1:03:20] happen no matter how much fast and they
[1:03:24] do how much praying they do if they got
[1:03:26] exclude the prophets message they'll
[1:03:28] never get to the depths of God man let's
[1:03:33] go back to that slide remember he placed
[1:03:38] a special leadership and these men of
[1:03:41] his own choosing and and and through the
[1:03:44] determinate counsel of his own will they
[1:03:46] appear once in each age it is the same
[1:03:47] spirit of them and I want to just make
[1:03:50] sure it appears once anybody trying to
[1:03:52] get you to believe in the eighth
[1:03:54] messenger somebody after brother branham
[1:03:56] as a messenger that's unscriptural
[1:03:59] unscriptural alright so I said this is a
[1:04:04] far cry from the Roman hereish see and
[1:04:08] if you just look at that that's Pope
[1:04:11] Francis on the left and the retired Pope
[1:04:13] Benedict Benedict I believe this the
[1:04:17] sixteenth they were embracing during the
[1:04:20] ceremony and and what brother branham
[1:04:23] just told us in that quote is that you
[1:04:24] know they they don't even agree with
[1:04:26] each other they change things that the
[1:04:28] next pope come in he changed something
[1:04:30] that he don't agree with you at the Pope
[1:04:31] before him they just stayed they treated
[1:04:33] as if they were God himself and some of
[1:04:35] the things that they've come up with
[1:04:36] have actually been against the Bible
[1:04:38] some things they tell you to accept we
[1:04:41] ought to we ought to be open and accept
[1:04:43] this no the Bible don't serious will be
[1:04:45] open and accept that now the Pope might
[1:04:47] say it but God didn't see it we're going
[1:04:50] to stay what God's saying
[1:04:51] listen they have a man in their own
[1:04:53] shoes than one after the other non
[1:04:55] producing the power of God not abided in
[1:04:57] the Word of God each one different from
[1:04:59] 11 before him and Adam what he desires
[1:05:01] as though he were God God is not in it
[1:05:05] alright so I last one for tonight I just
[1:05:10] wanted to bring this out the repudiate
[1:05:12] it and I put messenger versus as well as
[1:05:16] messengers they've always been
[1:05:17] repudiated the Bible said in Revelation
[1:05:19] 31 these things saith he that hath the
[1:05:21] seven spirits of God and the seven stars
[1:05:24] we are certainly living in a day a time
[1:05:28] where the you here mr. minister after
[1:05:32] minister you know we just had a preacher
[1:05:34] right here sunday from Jamaica small
[1:05:36] island like Jamaica and people still
[1:05:39] trying to find a way to repudiate the
[1:05:40] message right there's a spirit that has
[1:05:43] been released in the land today where
[1:05:46] people trying to repudiate the message
[1:05:47] waiting a reputed is they try to try to
[1:05:50] point out flaws in the messenger and if
[1:05:54] I can point out flaws and the messenger
[1:05:55] then I don't have to receive the message
[1:05:58] right that's coming from the messenger
[1:06:00] so they constantly looking for flaws
[1:06:03] look ok this was wrong that one brother
[1:06:05] said that he he couldn't find 16 men
[1:06:08] that that bet that kept fell off the
[1:06:10] bridge so he thought the whole story was
[1:06:11] a lie well he started to some research
[1:06:14] research I think he's found two or three
[1:06:15] people that were you know that died on
[1:06:18] that bridge he just hadn't found 16 but
[1:06:20] he found two or three like okay I guess
[1:06:21] if you keep doing your research you
[1:06:23] probably my final 16 but I don't need to
[1:06:26] find the 16 people when all the other
[1:06:29] visions have come to pass right and and
[1:06:32] not only that that happened nineteen
[1:06:35] thirty something they did not have the
[1:06:37] ability to hold information the way we
[1:06:41] hold information today they just didn't
[1:06:42] have it right and I one brother told me
[1:06:46] to say it take faith for you to believe
[1:06:48] that Moses went up into the mountain
[1:06:50] there's a burning bush and and he heard
[1:06:54] from God and you know and and and went
[1:06:56] back to you know to deliver two children
[1:06:58] Israel how do you know that Bush was on
[1:07:00] fire how you know was there anybody else
[1:07:03] there with Moses
[1:07:05] right was there an twas was was Google
[1:07:07] their Google was not there how do we
[1:07:10] know that that halfway look you know
[1:07:11] what you got to take what Moses said by
[1:07:13] faith if you got to take what Moses set
[1:07:15] by faith and he was a prophet why can't
[1:07:17] you take her brother branham set by fan
[1:07:20] amen but it's it's it's repudiated in so
[1:07:24] many ways people trying to repudiate it
[1:07:27] and I'll trying to find all kana for
[1:07:30] anything they can't find I think they
[1:07:32] wasted a lot of time remember this God
[1:07:35] uses Abraham and he liked Abraham was a
[1:07:40] liar y'all remember when he went down
[1:07:43] and throw that man that that was a
[1:07:44] system that the Bible tell us that then
[1:07:48] he went down and talk that's my sister
[1:07:50] and the man took a BIM electic her for a
[1:07:53] wife and God had to come down and since
[1:07:55] they don't you touch that man's wife he
[1:07:57] said well he told me is it that's his
[1:07:58] sister I know what he told you I want
[1:08:00] you to still go to him and have them
[1:08:01] pray for you Lord you want me to have a
[1:08:04] lion pray for me yes but God didn't call
[1:08:06] Abraham a liar God said I want you to go
[1:08:10] having pray for you because he's my
[1:08:11] profit so it's not what we think it's
[1:08:14] what God thinks God said Abraham was his
[1:08:18] profit even after hit bold-faced lie he
[1:08:23] was a prophet look at this Moses rebell
[1:08:30] but God still used him and I want
[1:08:33] something else I got here by Moses Moses
[1:08:36] kill yet he gave us a commandment thou
[1:08:41] shalt not kill and we follow it but
[1:08:47] Moses did kill so you can't this Bible
[1:08:51] blow your mind right God still expect
[1:08:53] you to follow that word look at Jonah
[1:08:55] there's sobayed but he was still God's
[1:08:57] prophet in the belly of the whale he was
[1:09:00] still God's prophet Samson sin inside a
[1:09:04] harlots house shouldn't have been there
[1:09:08] Phyllis time surrounding become at the
[1:09:11] harlots house picked up their gates and
[1:09:13] took him up to heal he was still
[1:09:15] anointed by God
[1:09:18] even to the point where he lost his
[1:09:20] eyesight and everything else dealing
[1:09:21] with Delilah he lost his eyesight he had
[1:09:24] to suffer from some of the stuff that he
[1:09:25] did but uh but when he prayed Lord once
[1:09:28] more he killed more Phyllis times in his
[1:09:30] death than he did in this life David
[1:09:36] still God's king but he murdered and I
[1:09:40] mean had that man took that man's wife
[1:09:42] got a pregnant and then had them
[1:09:44] delivered his own death sentence to Joab
[1:09:48] what a man but he was still God's King
[1:09:51] and not only that God sent man after my
[1:09:54] own heart lord have mercy look at this
[1:09:58] God used joslyn got used Joseph but the
[1:10:01] key thing I want you to break that I
[1:10:02] want you to remember those with severe
[1:10:05] blemishes far outnumber those whose
[1:10:10] history seem to be perfect all were and
[1:10:13] are his it's not what we think is what
[1:10:19] God thinks man I thank God you look at
[1:10:24] some of the histories of some of these
[1:10:25] people that we have here and God used
[1:10:27] them my you ought to be encouraged we
[1:10:30] all want to be encouraged doc can use us
[1:10:32] to man the noted that we and that he
[1:10:35] loves us just that much study later song
