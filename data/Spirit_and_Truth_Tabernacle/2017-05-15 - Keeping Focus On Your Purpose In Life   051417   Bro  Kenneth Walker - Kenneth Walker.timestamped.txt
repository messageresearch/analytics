[44:42] And then also, you don't have to stand
[44:44] or anything. Just let me read this and
[44:45] then I got a little quote that I want to
[44:47] share with you as well uh that I'll pull
[44:49] up. Amen. Uh uh Proverbs 22 and6
[44:56] the scripture says train up a child in
[44:59] the way he should go and when he is old
[45:02] he will not depart from it. Amen. And
[45:07] mothers have a tremendous responsibility
[45:09] in making sure that the children get
[45:12] trained in the proper way. And uh this
[45:14] is a uh promise to you that no matter
[45:16] what happens in life with your child, if
[45:19] you've done things the way God told you
[45:20] to do it, you can expect that child
[45:22] somewhere down the line to come right on
[45:24] back in line. Amen. So uh we just want
[45:27] to encourage you. I want to read a
[45:28] little something here from the prophet
[45:30] uh uh to you. Amen. On today, this is
[45:33] out of the sermon Elisha the prophet.
[45:36] Amen. Um 1956. Elisha the prophet. Uh it
[45:41] says this uh and here some time ago
[45:47] that I was reading an article where
[45:50] there was a home and five boys was born
[45:53] in this home and as soon as the oldest
[45:56] one got old enough to go to the Navy.
[46:00] Off to the Navy he went. Uh the second
[46:03] one followed the next one until all uh
[46:08] the whole five went away to the Navy
[46:12] and there was no Marines or Navy men in
[46:15] their family. The mother and father
[46:17] couldn't understand just why these uh
[46:20] boys everyone wanted to go to the Navy.
[46:23] Uh there was a real fine combing
[46:25] investigation made of this. And come to
[46:28] find out in the bedroom where these boys
[46:32] uh all was brought up in this bedroom
[46:34] there is a beautiful big picture hanging
[46:36] there of a big ship sailing on a quiet
[46:38] calm sea. And it so impressed the boys
[46:42] as they went to bed at night looking at
[46:44] this picture. It was on their mind to
[46:47] sail that quiet soothing sea. And along
[46:50] the morning uh when they rose, the first
[46:53] thing they could look at was that ship
[46:55] making her way through the quiet calm
[46:57] sea. And it impressed the boys so that
[47:00] each one become a sailor. Now, if a
[47:04] picture of a ship will impress boys to
[47:07] become navy men, sailors of the sea,
[47:09] what ought the picture of the Lord Jesus
[47:12] Christ do? See, always have the right
[47:15] thing before your children. Uh bring up
[47:17] a child in the way that it should go.
[47:19] See, bring it up and teach it right. It
[47:22] certainly it'll certainly won't depart
[47:24] from it. Amen. We want to thank God for
[47:27] mothers that have trained their children
[47:28] the right way. Uh because all of us are
[47:31] products, amen, of our mother's
[47:33] training. Amen. All of us are products.
[47:35] We all been impacted by good mothers,
[47:38] good godly mothers. We've been impacted
[47:40] by it. So, let's thank God for the
[47:42] mothers on today. Amen.

[54:03] [Music]
[54:06] Good to be back this morning. These
[54:08] saints here, you know, had a good time
[54:10] there Friday night. And so, uh, let's
[54:14] pray God. Let me say something help you
[54:16] and encourage you this morning. And I
[54:19] just as I was looking over my thoughts
[54:21] here and being Mother's Day, uh I just
[54:25] want to kind of tie something in here
[54:27] because it it stands out, you know, but
[54:31] uh appreciate you and uh been coming
[54:35] this way for quite a few years and and
[54:39] brother Jack and Erica and saints here
[54:41] that we've
[54:43] been a real blessing, help to us and and
[54:46] so uh brother Jack, his ministry spread
[54:49] out a little bit and so a lot of people
[54:52] that didn't know him know him now. Amen.
[54:54] So, if you got your Bibles this morning,
[54:58] I want to read from two places. I want
[55:00] to read from Genesis
[55:03] the 3 chapter
[55:06] verses
[55:07] 1-8. And then we'll read Isaiah 55 6-11.
[55:14] Genesis 3 1-8.
[55:19] Now the serpent
[55:22] was more subtle than any beast of the
[55:25] field which the Lord God had made.
[55:28] And he said unto the woman, "Ya hath God
[55:32] said,
[55:34] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[55:35] garden." And the woman said unto the
[55:37] serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the
[55:40] trees of the garden, but of the fruit of
[55:44] the tree, which is in the midst of the
[55:45] garden, God has said, you shall not eat
[55:47] it, neither shall you touch it, that you
[55:49] die." And the serpent said unto the
[55:52] woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God
[55:56] that knoweth in the day that you eat
[55:57] there, then your eyes shall be open. Ye
[56:00] shall be as gods, knowing good and
[56:02] evil." And when a woman saw the tree was
[56:05] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[56:07] unto the eyes,
[56:09] and a tree to be desire desired to make
[56:12] on wine, she took of the fruit there and
[56:13] did eat, and give also unto her husband
[56:15] with her, and he did eat. And the eyes
[56:19] of them both were open, and they knew
[56:22] that they were naked. They sewed fig
[56:24] leaves together, and made themselves
[56:25] aprons.
[56:27] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[56:30] walking in the garden, and cool day. And
[56:31] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[56:33] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[56:35] trees of the garden. Now with Isaiah
[56:39] here, Isaiah 55,
[56:47] starting verse six.
[56:53] Seek you the Lord while he may be found.
[56:56] Call ye up him while he is near. Let the
[56:59] wicked forsake his ways and unrighteous
[57:02] man his thoughts and let him return unto
[57:05] the Lord. Return of the Lord now and he
[57:08] will have mercy upon to our God for he
[57:11] will abundantly pardon. Huh? Abundantly
[57:15] pardon. So God wants to pardon. For my
[57:19] thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
[57:20] are your ways, sayeth the Lord. For as
[57:23] the heavens are higher than earth, so
[57:25] are my ways higher than your ways, and
[57:26] my thoughts and your thoughts. For as
[57:29] the rain cometh down, as snow from
[57:30] heaven returneth not thither, but water
[57:33] the earth, and make it rain forth, and
[57:36] it may give sea to the sober, and bread
[57:38] to the eater.
[57:42] So shall my word be that goeth forth out
[57:46] of my mouth.
[57:48] It shall not return to me bored,
[57:51] but it shall accomplish that which I
[57:54] please, and it shall prosper in the
[57:57] things whereto I sent it. Let's just bow
[58:00] our heads. Great eternal God, we're
[58:04] grateful that we can come before you
[58:06] again this morning, dear God, we humbled
[58:08] ourselves under your mighty presence,
[58:10] Lord. The songs have signed and sung,
[58:13] Lord. the worship and wonderful Lord
[58:15] your God that cannot fail Lord your God
[58:18] that Father that gives mercy give
[58:21] kindness and Father Lord you desire us
[58:24] to have more than we were want to self
[58:27] father Lord help us to realize we got a
[58:31] purpose in life father and help us to
[58:34] realize Lord we must finish that purpose
[58:38] we've been called to do father I commit
[58:40] the service into your hands anoint these
[58:43] lips of clay.
[58:45] Anoint the hearts and lives of those
[58:47] that's before me and keep thieves lips
[58:49] from saying anything contrary your word
[58:50] or will for I ask it all in the name of
[58:52] the Lord Jesus Christ and amen. May be
[58:55] seated.
[59:03] Now, my little thought this morning, and
[59:06] I'm going to I thought about you being a
[59:08] Mother's Day here.
[59:11] Keeping
[59:13] focused
[59:15] on your purpose in life.
[59:18] Keeping focused.
[59:21] Okay. Now, if you're a mom this morning,
[59:25] you keep focus on your purpose of being
[59:30] a mother. Huh? Right. Is that right?
[59:34] That's right. Amen. Don't forget. Huh?
[59:38] What a great thing it is to be a mother.
[59:40] Yes, sir. Don't you forget that you keep
[59:42] focused. That's right. What it means to
[59:45] be a mother. You're bringing life into
[59:47] the earth. Amen. Right. And you want to
[59:50] do the best with what you bring forth.
[59:53] Amen. Come on now. And you want to live
[59:56] a life
[59:58] right to be a witness
[1:00:01] to the mother that brought forth that
[1:00:03] life.
[1:00:05] Amen. I was going to go a little maybe a
[1:00:08] little deeper, but I that was just a
[1:00:10] thought to go along with that. I had
[1:00:11] hadn't even thought I sat back there and
[1:00:13] the Lord just brought it to me. Amen.
[1:00:15] You know,
[1:00:17] I pray everybody still got their
[1:00:19] spaceship outside.
[1:00:22] Huh.
[1:00:24] I know seems funny. Come on. But you
[1:00:27] know, we're not from here. That's right.
[1:00:32] If I come from God, I'm going back to
[1:00:34] God. Is that right? Amen. So, I don't
[1:00:38] need no spaceship out there. I don't
[1:00:40] want to go to the moon. I don't want to
[1:00:41] go to any of those places. Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] Cuz we done gone higher than that. Amen.
[1:00:47] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now in in life we
[1:00:51] know that uh there's purpose in life and
[1:00:53] a was a purpose. We look at Eve there
[1:00:56] and the things that happened to her. And
[1:00:59] here I'm going to read a quote here just
[1:01:00] kind of get this thing started to show
[1:01:02] you. Amen. What the prophet said in a
[1:01:05] message called victory day. Yes sir. Now
[1:01:09] listen real close because this is going
[1:01:11] to be for you. You going to leave here
[1:01:14] better off or worse off? All right. Uh
[1:01:17] this is I'm just giving out what the
[1:01:20] prophet said. He's giving out what the
[1:01:22] message said. Yeah. He said he's talking
[1:01:25] about Eve. That's the thing that broke
[1:01:27] the fellowship in Eden is because Eve
[1:01:31] that Eve failed to keep the focus
[1:01:36] or her looking on God's word
[1:01:39] and listen to reasoning. Come on. Now
[1:01:42] that's going to affect all of us. Right.
[1:01:44] Right? You're either going to accept
[1:01:46] what God said or you're going to reason
[1:01:48] against it. And when you reason against
[1:01:50] God's word, you open a door for the
[1:01:51] devil.
[1:01:53] Amen. The reason of the enemy, if she
[1:01:56] just stayed right with what God said,
[1:01:59] that settles it. God said, she didn't
[1:02:01] want to do that. See, she changed the
[1:02:03] focus of her glasses and begin to see
[1:02:06] instead of just one
[1:02:09] one way, there become two ways. Come on.
[1:02:12] Come on. Everybody hear me? Yeah. So,
[1:02:15] some thought comes to you outside the
[1:02:17] word of God. Amen. You're focusing two
[1:02:19] ways, not just one way. Huh?
[1:02:23] But the word of God will produce
[1:02:25] whatever sent forth to do. So you you
[1:02:28] take a hold of the word, it's going to
[1:02:29] produce whatever that word says it's
[1:02:31] going to produce.
[1:02:33] Amen. And so you going to be blessed.
[1:02:35] Amen. If you listen to one voice, not
[1:02:37] two voices. Glory to God. Amen. And it's
[1:02:40] two ways. She said, "Well, now maybe
[1:02:42] that man could be right. Maybe he is
[1:02:43] right." Now, we know God is right and
[1:02:46] maybe he's right. That's just more light
[1:02:48] on what God said. You see, there's the
[1:02:51] same thing happens today, exact right
[1:02:53] back to the same thought. See, see, you
[1:02:56] see two ideas. There's only one. There's
[1:03:00] not a creed. It's a word. God's word,
[1:03:02] God's purpose, God's plan. All other
[1:03:05] plans are no good. And Eve did this evil
[1:03:09] thing. And that's the reason today that
[1:03:11] God in his word never permits a woman to
[1:03:14] be a minister. See, it's just not per
[1:03:17] permitted in the Bible. Amen. Now,
[1:03:22] another quote here I want you to bear
[1:03:23] with me with. We'll get away from this
[1:03:25] for just a minute. He said, "Now, God
[1:03:27] gave us the Bible.
[1:03:30] What we going to do with it?" Now, the
[1:03:33] Bible is the word and the word is God.
[1:03:37] So that is our binoculars. Come on. Huh?
[1:03:42] That word is have binoculars. Is that
[1:03:44] right? That our glasses. That's our
[1:03:47] glasses. But now when we go to looking
[1:03:49] in the Bible and see four or five
[1:03:51] different ways. Well, it needs focusing.
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:56] Everybody been out hunting and you
[1:03:57] couldn't see. You was trying out. You
[1:04:00] thought you seen one and you focusing
[1:04:02] glasses and there's three or four. So
[1:04:05] you have to you have to be focused.
[1:04:06] Yeah. Amen. You can't look at this three
[1:04:08] or four different ways. Amen, brother.
[1:04:11] Cuz your focus away from the original
[1:04:14] work.
[1:04:16] Amen.
[1:04:18] You see,
[1:04:20] he said, "You need focusing. We've got
[1:04:23] to bring the thing to place where we see
[1:04:25] one solemn purpose of God." See, so he's
[1:04:28] given us some binoculars, this word to
[1:04:32] see where we're going, while we're here.
[1:04:35] And we're we're to be anchored in that
[1:04:38] one thing, our purpose. Amen. Now,
[1:04:43] here's here this morning, and we realize
[1:04:46] too, sometimes we wonder why we're doing
[1:04:49] here on this earth,
[1:04:52] but there's a purpose for it. Yeah.
[1:04:54] God don't put you here for just putting
[1:04:56] here you know that after 70 80 years you
[1:05:00] know you just become a bunch of dust
[1:05:01] somewhere huh there is something God
[1:05:06] wants to accomplish in my and your lives
[1:05:10] that's why I stand here at 81 years old
[1:05:12] this morning there's a purpose in my
[1:05:14] life amen I stand here by the grace of
[1:05:18] God and there's a purpose that God
[1:05:20] created me put me here you know I wasn't
[1:05:23] I didn't focus focus on the word for a
[1:05:25] long time. All right. But when he got my
[1:05:27] attention, huh? Amen. He got at my
[1:05:31] attention, then my my focus changed from
[1:05:34] the things of the world, desires of the
[1:05:36] world to serve this word here. Cuz that
[1:05:39] word is what brought me to life. That's
[1:05:41] what word is what brought me
[1:05:42] deliverance. That word is what brought
[1:05:44] me joy. That's what brought me
[1:05:45] happiness. That's what brought me
[1:05:46] stability. It's because I had the word
[1:05:48] of God. Regardless of what the devil
[1:05:50] throw my ways, I'll stand on the solid
[1:05:53] rock. I'll stand on a revelation of who
[1:05:56] he is and who I am. Somebody say,
[1:05:58] "Amen."
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:01] Hallelujah.
[1:06:03] Who wants to look back what you one time
[1:06:05] was?
[1:06:08] You had so much stink on you
[1:06:11] on the filth and the things of the
[1:06:13] world. All right. But now you've been
[1:06:15] cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:06:17] being washed by the water and of the
[1:06:19] word. Hallelujah.
[1:06:22] Not only that, but you're healed by the
[1:06:25] stripes of Jesus Christ. When he looked
[1:06:28] down the cross, he said, "It's
[1:06:30] finished."
[1:06:31] Amen. It's finished. What? The devil's
[1:06:33] defeated. Amen. It's over with. I I I
[1:06:37] have front. I have made the way. When he
[1:06:41] died, I I was in him.
[1:06:44] When he got up, I got up with him. And
[1:06:47] right now, right now, this morning, we
[1:06:49] are sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:06:51] Jesus.
[1:06:53] I'm not talking about our flesh, but I'm
[1:06:55] talking about the real you. Uh, as
[1:06:57] spiritual man or woman. Can you say
[1:06:59] amen? So, there's a purpose in life.
[1:07:03] Need to get focused on why I'm here.
[1:07:07] We're not here to be some some uh
[1:07:10] somebody out here to entertain the
[1:07:12] world.
[1:07:14] Huh? Everybody want to be a movie star.
[1:07:17] Huh?
[1:07:19] And you know I I just uh when you see
[1:07:23] things, brother, you don't want to get
[1:07:25] out here and expose yourself to in in
[1:07:27] things because the flesh is weak. The
[1:07:29] spirit's willing. Yeah. But see, you
[1:07:32] don't want to get in no popularity
[1:07:34] errors.
[1:07:36] Huh? Cuz it'll draw you away from what
[1:07:39] you was focused to be doing.
[1:07:42] That's right. I know a couple of
[1:07:44] hillbilly seniors had a daughter called
[1:07:47] uh her movie name was Hannah Montana.
[1:07:51] Huh? Disney World.
[1:07:55] Amen. And that little girl, huh? Stayed
[1:07:58] in that atmosphere. I don't know why I'm
[1:08:00] going this way. stayed in that
[1:08:02] atmosphere
[1:08:04] and now uh she sure only no Hannah
[1:08:08] Montana.
[1:08:12] Yeah, she's from
[1:08:14] the devil's tucker much, you know. She's
[1:08:17] she's sticking her tongue out. I don't
[1:08:19] know what she was trying to Well, I
[1:08:22] forgive me getting that but anyway.
[1:08:24] Amen.
[1:08:26] Everybody call for duty. You know,
[1:08:30] the word the word eno, there had to be
[1:08:32] an enoic cuz it's going to be a time for
[1:08:35] the bride of the rapture. Amen. But that
[1:08:38] word enix means dedicated.
[1:08:42] So we going in if we're looking for a
[1:08:44] body change, we're going to look to get
[1:08:46] out of here. We're going to have to be
[1:08:47] dedicated. Huh? Dedicated or what?
[1:08:52] Dedicated to a purpose that God put us
[1:08:54] here. We're here representing Jesus
[1:08:56] Christ and eternal life.
[1:09:00] You're really in eternity right now. I
[1:09:01] mentioned this the other night. We are
[1:09:03] in eternal. This world ain't going to
[1:09:05] change. Devil can't destroy this world.
[1:09:08] God will just cleanse it off and they go
[1:09:11] back how it was in the Garden of Eden.
[1:09:13] The lion will lay down with the lamb.
[1:09:16] Huh?
[1:09:18] and whatever you know if you want to
[1:09:20] plant this tree over here over here you
[1:09:23] know tree be planted over here now y'all
[1:09:27] look funny but the prophet said there's
[1:09:29] enough you got the Holy Ghost there's
[1:09:30] enough power in you to speak a world
[1:09:33] into existence uh and go live on it
[1:09:37] see we don't Jesus said huh all power in
[1:09:43] heaven and earth has been given unto
[1:09:46] Huh? And because we're in him, all power
[1:09:50] in heaven and earth been given us too.
[1:09:54] Huh? When I preach, you know, on true
[1:09:57] identification there Friday night,
[1:09:59] trying to identify who we are, why we're
[1:10:01] here, my brothers and sisters, those
[1:10:03] purpose we need to realize. See, even
[1:10:07] even though had the purpose, he had a
[1:10:10] purpose.
[1:10:11] God loves us. It was so bad in that day
[1:10:16] because the sons of God had took the
[1:10:18] daughters of men. The prophet said they
[1:10:19] didn't want them little Israelite women
[1:10:22] had to work out there. Now daughters of
[1:10:24] men, their daughters was fair. Yeah.
[1:10:27] Huh. Right. They some beauty queens. All
[1:10:31] right. Sons of God looked at that said
[1:10:34] huh. Yeah. And the people in that days
[1:10:38] their mind was full of so much filth and
[1:10:43] stuff of the world. Yeah. He repented
[1:10:46] God. He even created man. That's right.
[1:10:48] Bible.
[1:10:50] They got that place. God just made
[1:10:53] almost God sick. Yeah. That I created
[1:10:57] that
[1:11:00] that's what I give life to.
[1:11:04] Wow.
[1:11:06] Wow. But Noah found grace
[1:11:10] in eyes of God. The same way we found
[1:11:14] grace.
[1:11:16] Right now, if you're a child of God,
[1:11:19] you've been justified.
[1:11:22] And justification is if you never did do
[1:11:25] it in the first place in the mind of
[1:11:28] God. What's he looking at? He's looking
[1:11:31] at that little seed
[1:11:33] down in you, the real you. See, you
[1:11:37] carried that seed around a long time.
[1:11:39] Come on. You know, when you heard this
[1:11:41] message,
[1:11:43] you had to bypass your theophony to come
[1:11:45] to this body to be tempted and try
[1:11:48] according to second Corinthians five
[1:11:49] there.
[1:11:52] But look, we bypassed it.
[1:11:55] But that little that little jean seed
[1:11:57] laying in there. You went to all these
[1:11:59] other kind of church. You heard all this
[1:12:01] other stuff. Yeah. Because I'm gonna
[1:12:04] show somebody a mystery. Everything's
[1:12:06] been hid everybody and people are
[1:12:08] following him instead of following me.
[1:12:11] All right. Huh? All right. And so he
[1:12:14] sends this message
[1:12:16] and soon as you hear it, soon as you
[1:12:19] hear this message, you have heard from
[1:12:22] your theology. Amen. That eternal body
[1:12:27] there. Huh? His problem still got hair.
[1:12:30] I'm just waiting on it. Huh?
[1:12:34] All right. If I haven't lost any, I'm
[1:12:36] going to have it, brother. Amen. If God
[1:12:39] knows when a sparrow falls, he knows all
[1:12:41] about us.
[1:12:44] Well, praise the Lord. Anyway, I say God
[1:12:47] knowing all things, you know, but still
[1:12:50] yet
[1:12:52] Noah I I know this ABC stuff, but the
[1:12:55] person,
[1:12:57] do you realize what kind of a man that
[1:12:59] Noah had to be and what God told him to
[1:13:03] do that he was willing to build on that
[1:13:07] ark for 120 years to see it completed?
[1:13:10] He stayed focused. Right? He was God's
[1:13:15] purpose.
[1:13:17] God see this was a thing of a three-fold
[1:13:19] purpose. This is going to be the washing
[1:13:21] of the word. All right. Of the earth.
[1:13:23] Huh? The the word far spirit. It's going
[1:13:29] to go through the three stages. But he
[1:13:31] was he was a man. Yeah. Huh. Had a
[1:13:36] purpose. Amen. And re he had to stay
[1:13:39] focused on that. Come on now. Didn't
[1:13:41] make no difference what the wife said,
[1:13:43] children said, the neighbor said, people
[1:13:44] around everywhere else. He's an idiot.
[1:13:46] He's crazy out here building on this
[1:13:47] thing 120 years and said he goes down
[1:13:50] there and he preaches it's going to
[1:13:52] rain. Ain't you got another sermon? No.
[1:13:55] No. Besides, it's going to rain.
[1:14:00] But he fulfilled Amen. God's purpose in
[1:14:04] his life.
[1:14:06] Glory to God. Amen. Because God's word
[1:14:10] will interpret itself, brother. It
[1:14:13] cannot fail. It will accomplish what
[1:14:16] it's sent forth to do. That word sent
[1:14:19] forth to build an ark. And a man had to
[1:14:22] speak that word, brother. That ark was
[1:14:24] going to be built, brother. Hallelujah
[1:14:27] to God. Jesus. Amen. But what's our
[1:14:31] purpose?
[1:14:32] God put us here. We're his hands, his
[1:14:35] feet, his eyes, his arms. Amen. Uh we're
[1:14:39] spiritual being, but God is a spirit.
[1:14:42] Amen. Jesus said, "When you seen me, you
[1:14:46] seen the father." G. Have I been such a
[1:14:49] long time with you and you don't know?
[1:14:51] Still don't know me. All right. I asked
[1:14:53] you that. Glory to God. Huh? Has it been
[1:14:57] such a long time with you and you don't
[1:14:58] know who it is?
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:04] Oh, Lord. My God.
[1:15:07] Wake up.
[1:15:09] Shake yourself. Who am I that a king
[1:15:13] would bleed and die for?
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:21] Even here old Samuel. Amen. When he had
[1:15:25] to go out and face
[1:15:27] Oh, Goliath.
[1:15:30] Look here. One thing about him, he was
[1:15:34] so focused
[1:15:37] on what he was going to do.
[1:15:40] Huh? If you look at them scriptures
[1:15:43] there, you'll find he didn't say nothing
[1:15:45] negative. It was all positive. Huh? Huh?
[1:15:50] I I'mma take his head off.
[1:15:54] according to looking at situations. My
[1:15:57] brothers and sisters, when you start
[1:15:59] looking at situations,
[1:16:01] you're already defeated.
[1:16:03] You got to keep focused on the word. Is
[1:16:07] that right? So, you can't you can't look
[1:16:11] at them situation, but look, if God has
[1:16:15] ever done something for you, huh, David,
[1:16:19] you jump off the bear and the sheep and
[1:16:20] kill those things. When he went out to
[1:16:24] meet Goliath,
[1:16:26] he stayed focused on what God already
[1:16:29] done. Somebody hear a minute. If God
[1:16:32] heals you one time, he'll heal you
[1:16:34] again. You got the Holy Ghost. God done
[1:16:37] something for you, he'll do it again.
[1:16:40] And when he out there, he did not look
[1:16:42] at situations.
[1:16:44] He didn't look the size of a man. Can
[1:16:48] you say amen? He wasn't looking that. He
[1:16:51] was focused on the word of God. He know
[1:16:53] what God had already done for him. Amen.
[1:16:57] And up there was a Israelite army. All
[1:17:01] kind of armor on their n their knees are
[1:17:04] shaken and everything. Amen. Because
[1:17:07] they wasn't focused on who they were.
[1:17:10] Can you say and they was raining a
[1:17:11] reproach upon the Israel because they
[1:17:14] backed down from somebody or some great
[1:17:16] big something out here and they had all
[1:17:18] kind of armor. But God said, "I'm not
[1:17:20] going to let them be the laughingtock."
[1:17:22] Uh, I send this little boy out. Somebody
[1:17:26] say, "Amen." When God wants to bring
[1:17:29] victory, he'll send whoever he wants to.
[1:17:31] It don't have to be somebody that
[1:17:33] somebody knows a whole lot about. It can
[1:17:35] be a little nobody to the community. But
[1:17:38] if God's called you, God wants you to do
[1:17:40] something, you rise up in the name of
[1:17:42] the Lord and tell devil to get on behind
[1:17:45] you. Amen. I'm going on with what God
[1:17:47] killed me. I'm going to kill the all the
[1:17:49] giants before me that's trying to
[1:17:51] destroy me, put us down, but I'm going
[1:17:53] to kill them all. It don't make no
[1:17:55] difference what comes my way, what kind
[1:17:57] of giant, whatever it is. Amen. It's got
[1:17:59] to come down. It's got to come into
[1:18:01] subjection to the word of God.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah to God.
[1:18:05] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Yes.
[1:18:10] Yes, Lord. Amen. Amen. Let's let me get
[1:18:13] this other quote here for you. Amen.
[1:18:16] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:18:19] He said we must focus our lives
[1:18:23] not on what somebody else says but focus
[1:18:25] our lives to him.
[1:18:27] Our life is be focused to God.
[1:18:32] And he's the word. If we get our lives
[1:18:34] lined up with the word then that word
[1:18:37] and our lives will become the same.
[1:18:40] If you abide in me, huh?
[1:18:43] If you abide in me and my word abides
[1:18:46] you, then you ask what you will, it be
[1:18:49] granted you. Verily I say unto you, if
[1:18:52] you say to this mountain,
[1:18:55] be moved and don't doubt in your heart,
[1:18:57] but believe that what you have said will
[1:19:00] come to pass, you can have what you have
[1:19:03] said. Oh my, not what I said, what you
[1:19:06] said. Amen. It brings it right down in
[1:19:09] the Garden of Eden. Adam could say to
[1:19:12] this tree being plucked up over Eve
[1:19:14] said, "Boy, I like that tree somewhere
[1:19:16] else." Tree be plucked up. Put it over
[1:19:18] there. How's that look now? Eve, that
[1:19:20] looks good.
[1:19:23] That was the position that they had to
[1:19:26] start with.
[1:19:28] Exactly right. Huh? We're children of
[1:19:31] God.
[1:19:32] God can't start things one way and end
[1:19:35] some other way. That's exactly right.
[1:19:37] Amen. I don't care if the world's
[1:19:39] falling apart. I don't care if
[1:19:40] everything's filth everywhere all the
[1:19:42] way around. Huh?
[1:19:45] The final climax we back for. Ain't no
[1:19:48] sin. Ain't no heartaches.
[1:19:51] Huh? And all you to say to that mountain
[1:19:55] be thou removed. What have you had to
[1:19:57] do? But there ain't going to be nothing
[1:19:58] like that there. Uh it it's already
[1:20:01] fixed saying. If I was saved before the
[1:20:04] foundation of the world, had the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost back there in the mind of God, it
[1:20:08] was finished. And you did too. Right.
[1:20:11] Amen. That's right. See what I'm what
[1:20:13] I'm saying, you got to keep focused on
[1:20:16] our purpose in life. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:20] Yes, sir. You got to be there.
[1:20:24] Turn with me if you would to Romans 8.
[1:20:28] Start at 8:28. Come on. Uh,
[1:20:37] all this real familiar scripture, but I
[1:20:39] wonder how many of us believe what we
[1:20:41] read.
[1:20:44] If if we believe all this stuff and all
[1:20:47] this words and promises in the word of
[1:20:49] God, man, you talk about people rolling
[1:20:53] around the floor. Hallelujah. Run,
[1:20:55] brother. My life for 81 years, brother,
[1:20:57] I've done Jericho marches. I've run
[1:20:59] danced. I've done a little bit of
[1:21:01] everything, brother.
[1:21:03] Amen.
[1:21:06] All that was good for a season. Yeah.
[1:21:08] I'm not saying you waste now, but I tell
[1:21:10] you, the money concentration is on this
[1:21:13] word. All right. Cuz a lot of people
[1:21:15] ain't hollers. Huh? Yeah. Still don't
[1:21:18] even have the Holy Ghost. You can't go,
[1:21:21] you can't go by motion whether you're
[1:21:22] having a wife or not. Romans 8:28,
[1:21:27] reopen your scriptures. And we know that
[1:21:30] all things, yes, sir, work together for
[1:21:33] good to them that love God, to them who
[1:21:35] are called according to whose purpose?
[1:21:39] God's purpose. So God had a purpose. Is
[1:21:42] that right? For whom he did forno.
[1:21:45] Also did he predestinate to be conformed
[1:21:48] to the image of his son, that he might
[1:21:51] be the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:21:54] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[1:21:57] he also called. And whom he called them,
[1:22:00] he also justified.
[1:22:02] And whom he justified them, he also
[1:22:05] glorified them. Huh? All right.
[1:22:10] Who is it, my brother, sisters? Yes. God
[1:22:14] can only be glorified in us. Yes, sir.
[1:22:17] Huh? Amen. We're here. We just don't
[1:22:21] know what's in us. The Holy Ghost in us.
[1:22:24] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The life in us.
[1:22:28] Amen.
[1:22:30] Now then he said, "What
[1:22:33] what shall we say then to these things?
[1:22:36] If God be for us, can somebody say
[1:22:38] amen?" Who can be against us? The devil
[1:22:43] cannot move. He cannot touch you except
[1:22:46] God allows it.
[1:22:52] Amen. Right. And if you want to go a
[1:22:55] little bit deeper, greater is he that's
[1:22:57] in you than he is in the world. He that
[1:22:59] spare not his own son, but leave him for
[1:23:01] us all. How shall he not with him also
[1:23:04] freely give us all things? Who shall lay
[1:23:07] anything to the charge of God's elect?
[1:23:09] Who could do that?
[1:23:11] It is God that justifyth. Who is it that
[1:23:14] condemnth? It is Christ that died yet
[1:23:17] rather that is risen again. Who is even
[1:23:19] at the right hand of God? Who maketh
[1:23:22] intercession for us? Who shall separate
[1:23:25] us from the love of God? Tribulation,
[1:23:31] distress, uh-uh. Persecution, uh-uh.
[1:23:34] Phantom, nakedness, pearl, sword, who
[1:23:38] can separation from the love of Christ,
[1:23:40] yet can't be done because it's God's
[1:23:42] purpose for all of these things to be
[1:23:45] with us, brother.
[1:23:47] Amen.
[1:23:49] It says, "As is written,
[1:23:51] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:23:53] long. We are slaughtered as sheep for
[1:23:55] the slaughter. Nay,
[1:23:58] in all these things we are more than
[1:24:01] conquerors." Yes, sir. Through him that
[1:24:04] loved us.
[1:24:06] Now, we're going to ask a question here.
[1:24:09] We get persuaded about a lot of things.
[1:24:12] Come on now.
[1:24:14] How many natural folks here?
[1:24:20] You sisters can go shopping
[1:24:24] and they'll have things dressed up. Boy,
[1:24:26] that thing is really good. There's a
[1:24:30] This thing cost you $100,
[1:24:34] but it's today you can have it for
[1:24:37] $49.95.
[1:24:41] Huh? You say, "Lord, what a deal. I
[1:24:44] getting a $100 dress for $49.95."
[1:24:49] And what it do before you ever came in?
[1:24:52] That's what it cost to start with.
[1:24:59] Yes, sir. But you was persuaded
[1:25:03] to buy it anyway. Yeah. Amen. Now with
[1:25:08] the brothers, you I could go with
[1:25:09] hunting equip and fish and you know all
[1:25:12] that thing. Some be rod reels, you know.
[1:25:16] Oh, this thing a number one. All right.
[1:25:19] You get a whole whale.
[1:25:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. But I'm talking
[1:25:29] about with humans. Amen. But when it
[1:25:32] comes to this, the
[1:25:34] God is trying to persuade us of who we
[1:25:38] are.
[1:25:40] For I am persuaded, Paul saying it, I'm
[1:25:43] persuaded that neither death nor life,
[1:25:47] nor angel, nor prince or powers, nor
[1:25:49] things present or things to come, nor
[1:25:51] depth or height, depth, or any other
[1:25:54] creature should be able to separate us
[1:25:56] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:25:57] Jesus our Lord.
[1:26:00] We're victors. Yes, we are. We got the
[1:26:03] victory. Amen. People out here are
[1:26:06] running the race, they don't know
[1:26:07] whether they going to come in last,
[1:26:10] fourth. Uhuh.
[1:26:13] But a child of God. Amen. He's at the
[1:26:16] victory line, brother. And the thing
[1:26:18] right now, saints of God, if you look,
[1:26:20] if you don't understand what's going on
[1:26:21] now,
[1:26:23] this thing's not complicated now. I can
[1:26:26] see the finish line out there. That
[1:26:28] close. I can see the finish line. the
[1:26:30] world, the system. I could see the
[1:26:32] finish line. I see condition that the
[1:26:34] world's in. I see the finish line. Amen.
[1:26:37] Amen. Now,
[1:26:40] those things, my brothers and sisters,
[1:26:43] we got to stay focused on the word of
[1:26:46] God. Amen.
[1:26:48] Go the scriptures. Let me go to one
[1:26:50] other place. Uh James 1
[1:26:56] verses two,
[1:26:58] three, four.
[1:27:02] Blood of the Lord.
[1:27:05] I'm going to do a lot of reading. You
[1:27:07] didn't sleep too good last night.
[1:27:12] Jump up and shout. I don't care. Wake
[1:27:13] up.
[1:27:17] I said that at brother Stevens one time
[1:27:19] as everybody went out and eat dinner,
[1:27:22] come back and I said, you know,
[1:27:26] sometimes you get sleep in church.
[1:27:27] Sometime I do. But I said before I let
[1:27:29] the devil defeat me, I'll jump up and
[1:27:32] holler at Jesus. I said that and they
[1:27:35] some woman sitting back in the back
[1:27:36] jumped up and said Jesus.
[1:27:41] Amen.
[1:27:44] James 1 verses 2 3 and 4. My brother,
[1:27:50] count it all joy
[1:27:53] when you fall into diverse temptation.
[1:27:56] And we go down. Oh me. Oh my. What's
[1:27:59] going on?
[1:28:01] This happening, that happening.
[1:28:06] County joy.
[1:28:08] If God's control of every situation and
[1:28:11] the prophet God said, "This whole world
[1:28:14] is a proven ground for us."
[1:28:16] He put us here to prove to the devil
[1:28:20] that he's got some children here that is
[1:28:22] going to be victorious. And God made the
[1:28:24] way for us to be victorious.
[1:28:27] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Amen. I done read the book. Come on now.
[1:28:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:37] Lord, joy when you fall and die 10,
[1:28:40] knowing this that the trial of your
[1:28:41] faith workketh patience. Oh,
[1:28:45] patience in this age. Oh, that's unheard
[1:28:48] of.
[1:29:02] I wasn't ready to get eat.
[1:29:06] I was just going to demonstrate a little
[1:29:07] bit.
[1:29:10] And if you don't get that Big Mac out
[1:29:12] there, somebody punch you through the
[1:29:15] window or something. Y'all
[1:29:17] Amen. Amen. People don't have no
[1:29:20] patience. That's right.
[1:29:23] you. Oh Lord, I got to get away from
[1:29:26] this stuff. But let patience have her
[1:29:28] perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:29:32] entire wanting nothing. If any of you
[1:29:35] lack wisdom,
[1:29:38] uhoh.
[1:29:40] Y'all know what that is? Wisdom.
[1:29:44] It means to keep your mouth shut
[1:29:48] instead of talking. Sometime some you
[1:29:51] got to have wisdom. That's the gift of
[1:29:53] the spirit is wisdom. Is that right? If
[1:29:56] you lack wisdom, let him ask of God and
[1:29:58] God and give unto all men and God will
[1:30:01] give it all men liberty. Upgrade it not
[1:30:03] and shall be given him. But if we ask in
[1:30:07] it faith, nothing waving for he that
[1:30:08] wave is like a wave of the sea driven
[1:30:10] with winds tossed. For let that let not
[1:30:15] that man think he received anything of
[1:30:17] the Lord. You got to be steadfast. You
[1:30:20] got to take God his word and go on with
[1:30:23] it. Amen.
[1:30:25] Now,
[1:30:30] this is all about Calvary, brother and
[1:30:32] sister. When it's finished, when you we
[1:30:34] we can go a lot of different ways about
[1:30:35] a lot of different things, but uh when
[1:30:38] it comes down,
[1:30:41] it's all about Calvary. It's all what
[1:30:42] Jesus done pointed one way.
[1:30:46] Look, probably made a statement like
[1:30:48] this.
[1:30:50] I don't care what church you're
[1:30:52] affiliated with, what you believe is you
[1:30:55] meet God one place, and that's under the
[1:30:58] blood of Jesus Christ. And if everybody
[1:31:01] meets that same place,
[1:31:04] huh, it's all brothers and sisters.
[1:31:08] That's a place, right? Huh? Then he said
[1:31:12] in another place, you got to be here.
[1:31:16] place under that name. He put you where
[1:31:19] he put his name place to place for you.
[1:31:22] Amen. Now
[1:31:26] we look at something here.
[1:31:29] Now this a little bit hard.
[1:31:34] We started out with the Lord and God
[1:31:36] wants to fully express himself in your
[1:31:39] life, my life, all of us.
[1:31:43] And if we are just trying to live a part
[1:31:45] life and don't let God have full
[1:31:48] preeminence in our life,
[1:31:51] we are robbing God.
[1:32:00] Why are we robbing him? You won't let
[1:32:02] God express himself.
[1:32:10] I know a little tough, but this ain't
[1:32:13] playing church. We're either going to go
[1:32:16] all the way stay focused on what God
[1:32:19] purposed for us in life
[1:32:22] or we'll wind up just going down the
[1:32:24] drain as nobody.
[1:32:27] I I I'm just telling you the truth. I'm
[1:32:29] going tell you the way it is, my brother
[1:32:30] and sister. I'm not,
[1:32:32] you know, uh, some people just hold
[1:32:35] back, brother. I believe just laying out
[1:32:37] and telling like it is, you know. Amen.
[1:32:40] So,
[1:32:41] we're going to hit you, brother Jack. If
[1:32:43] I get too long, you let me.
[1:32:49] Okay. And I'm going to hit you some more
[1:32:50] things. I hit a few of them. Now, now
[1:32:54] this all good.
[1:32:56] I don't know what you're going to do
[1:32:57] with, but it's all good.
[1:33:00] See, you got to now you we're we're
[1:33:02] focusing on a lot of things. Now, this
[1:33:04] is my thought on this. I'm focused on
[1:33:07] the thought

[1:33:49] what God said about me.

[1:36:26] Christ. Word of my testimony, Revelation
[1:36:29] 12:1. I am daily overcome the devil.
[1:36:35] Anybody can't say amen to that.
[1:36:39] In other words, what you're saying, but
[1:36:41] not saying amen to that. You're saying
[1:36:43] the devil's overcome me every day.
[1:36:47] sir.
[1:36:49] You want to hear that one or you want to

[1:38:32] Well, let me I got it.
[1:38:35] Oh, yeah. Turn to the book of Hosea with
[1:38:39] me.
[1:38:43] Hosea 6.
[1:38:48] And while you're turning, I'm going read
[1:38:50] you a quote. Hosea 6, start at verse
[1:38:55] one.
[1:38:58] Prophet God said message preached on the
[1:39:01] mark of the beast California.
[1:39:05] He said but Cain
[1:39:08] wanted something beautiful.
[1:39:11] Now last I was saying remember beauty
[1:39:14] that's attraction to the eye. The
[1:39:18] Catholic Church long learned that a long
[1:39:20] time ago that through the eyes is the
[1:39:22] gate to the soul
[1:39:26] to make beauty so forth and people fall
[1:39:29] for that. Hollywood learned that a long
[1:39:30] time ago. The devil know him before any
[1:39:33] of you. That's exactly right. That's the
[1:39:35] technique he worked on the same thing.
[1:39:39] Set himself up a more beautiful candle.
[1:39:42] Yeah. Oh, then you go downtown and come
[1:39:47] through, come by old Trump's place here.
[1:39:50] All that beautiful stuff out there.
[1:39:53] Who's behind all that stuff?
[1:39:58] Devil said, "I like something more
[1:39:59] beautiful. I like a bigger church. I
[1:40:01] like big people. I like all this." I
[1:40:06] probably God coming along. He says, "You
[1:40:09] got two or three people God promised to
[1:40:11] be in the midst of you." Huh? He said,
[1:40:15] "That's more scriptural."
[1:40:18] Wow.
[1:40:20] The devil wants quantity. God's looking
[1:40:22] for quality.
[1:40:24] Huh?
[1:40:27] Said more beautiful. That's always been
[1:40:29] beauty. Now, remember this sisters ain't
[1:40:32] it ain't nothing wrong with you looking
[1:40:34] good and your husband that, your
[1:40:35] boyfriend, what nothing wrong that. But
[1:40:37] don't let that beauty overcome you.
[1:40:41] Become a serpent.
[1:40:43] Even the devil after the curse came on
[1:40:45] him, he become a serpent. He's still a
[1:40:47] beautiful creature. Look how graceful he
[1:40:50] can move and how beauty his colors even
[1:40:53] even his curse take away the beauty
[1:40:55] from. Do you think Judas's scar was an
[1:40:57] old drunk?
[1:40:59] Now he's identifying the serpent with
[1:41:03] caller up and combed her. He was a
[1:41:05] slicker. Judas was a slicker boy. Yes,
[1:41:09] sir. Devil's too smart for that.
[1:41:13] He said, "When I went to Pig Alley,
[1:41:16] Brother Mo, when I went to France, we
[1:41:17] thought he was going to see those old
[1:41:19] prostitutes of pig out. Just something
[1:41:20] drug out. Satan's too smart for that.
[1:41:23] The most beautiful women you can ever
[1:41:25] see. See, he's smart. Sin is enticing.
[1:41:29] Sin is beautiful, but it's death."
[1:41:31] That's right. Don't look at beauty. Look
[1:41:33] at truth, not beauty. That's what's the
[1:41:36] matter of the church today is jumping
[1:41:37] from beauty drying. That's right. It's
[1:41:40] getting dead. Don't want to stay long on
[1:41:42] that. I go to preaching on that.
[1:41:46] And he said here, yeah, let me read the
[1:41:48] rest of this. The greatest battle ever
[1:41:51] rages when Eve opened up her mind
[1:41:54] to her reason. That's the flute. It come
[1:41:58] in. That's a channel run down her
[1:42:01] reason. She her soul. She raised her
[1:42:04] eyes
[1:42:05] with sight. Now watch. With sight she
[1:42:08] saw the serpent. He was a beautiful
[1:42:11] handsome
[1:42:15] far better than her own husband.
[1:42:18] He was most substant of all the beast of
[1:42:21] the field. How many know
[1:42:26] that a man is highest form of animal
[1:42:29] life? There is
[1:42:34] He's beast. The prophet God said a man
[1:42:36] without hold no more than beast. You
[1:42:39] think that ain't a beast out here and
[1:42:40] cut a little baby up and put it in a
[1:42:42] oven or something.
[1:42:45] Let a little child go out or wrap it up
[1:42:47] with dynamite blow itself to pieces.
[1:42:49] Kill him.
[1:42:52] Brother, we're living in Satan's Eden.
[1:42:54] Brothers and sisters, you can you can
[1:42:57] take anything you want to. Who gets most
[1:42:59] glory here?
[1:43:02] here, West Palm Beach. Who's getting
[1:43:04] most glory around here? God or the
[1:43:06] devil?
[1:43:08] You know it's the devil. You see him on
[1:43:10] every sign. See him walking up and down
[1:43:11] the street. See him in stores. Huh? And
[1:43:14] they put God out about everything. Well,
[1:43:19] they said he was probably a fair man
[1:43:21] than her husband. He looked like a great
[1:43:23] musler beast in there. How great he was.
[1:43:26] And he was trying to tell her what a
[1:43:28] great thing it was.
[1:43:30] Mhm. And the first thing she did, I know
[1:43:33] you sisters and I know what Jack's
[1:43:35] taught. So I know you got the revelation
[1:43:37] what we went on. She opened up her mind
[1:43:39] when she did human reason called it. Why
[1:43:42] wouldn't that be a thrill?
[1:43:45] Oh my. Amen. Now,
[1:43:52] okay, here we are.
[1:43:54] We're back to Hosea. All right.
[1:43:58] I want to bring you up bring you up to a
[1:44:00] place
[1:44:01] we'll go from here to the book of
[1:44:03] Revelation and not wind her up.
[1:44:06] Look,
[1:44:09] scriptural wise, I said to me Friday
[1:44:12] night, scripture wise,
[1:44:15] scriptures pertaining to us gentile
[1:44:18] people,
[1:44:20] 99% of its history, Yes, sir. it's done
[1:44:24] being fulfilled. Amen. Huh.
[1:44:28] Huh. It's history. The only thing left
[1:44:32] is us getting out of here. Amen. Huh.
[1:44:35] And we see how close it is. Look at the
[1:44:38] world. Look at the condition of the
[1:44:40] world.
[1:44:41] Politics and everything is rotten to the
[1:44:43] core. They ain't nobody tell the truth.
[1:44:46] You know why? It's the devil.
[1:44:50] Huh?
[1:44:54] For the love of money
[1:44:57] is the root of all evil.
[1:45:01] Huh?
[1:45:03] Lord, help me.
[1:45:07] I don't care how big a house you got.
[1:45:10] Prophet said it's just like a three room
[1:45:12] house.
[1:45:14] You go and eat in the kitchen. If your
[1:45:17] wife cooks,
[1:45:20] have fellowship in the kitchen.
[1:45:23] You're going to live room, talk around
[1:45:25] some, you know, and in the bedroom.
[1:45:27] That's a three room house.
[1:45:30] Well,
[1:45:33] how big do you need? Yeah.
[1:45:37] Huh? Amen. You can have billions and
[1:45:39] billions of dollars that will not
[1:45:42] satisfy you. I think I said about
[1:45:43] Solomon the other night. Had 500 wives,
[1:45:46] had all kind of wisdom, but had
[1:45:48] everything. Amen. And he said, Well,
[1:45:52] it's just all wisdom.
[1:45:56] It's it's you know it's quote it brother
[1:46:01] my it's all vanity vexation of spirit.
[1:46:04] That's right. Amen. That's what it is.
[1:46:08] Amen. So
[1:46:11] simple Christian
[1:46:14] prophet God or the Bible tells us that
[1:46:17] God promised to meet our needs. If we
[1:46:19] sought for the kingdom of God and his
[1:46:20] righteousness, all those things had need
[1:46:22] to be added unto us. Not our wants.
[1:46:26] See, it's your wants. It gets you away
[1:46:28] from focusing on the word. I'm just for
[1:46:32] all of us, brother. I've been down the
[1:46:34] road. Amen. If you don't know the Lord
[1:46:36] in here, then I know what you're talking
[1:46:38] about.
[1:46:39] If you done a little bit of everything,
[1:46:41] I know what you're talking about. But
[1:46:43] thank God that man died a long time ago.
[1:46:45] Amen. Amen. Now, let's get down here.
[1:46:50] So, God's looking for something.
[1:46:54] Gentile age over.
[1:46:56] They said church age over. We're living
[1:46:58] in another time. We're in a bride age.
[1:47:02] It's when God's taking a bride. How many
[1:47:05] know that a marriage is a union? It's
[1:47:08] agreement. Huh? And the way you marry to
[1:47:11] God is you've got to agree with it. Huh?
[1:47:17] You got that's the marriage. You're
[1:47:20] married to the wormise.
[1:47:22] Okay. He says, "Come and let us return
[1:47:24] unto the Lord for he has torn and he
[1:47:27] will heal us. He is spitten and he will
[1:47:30] bind us up.
[1:47:32] After two days
[1:47:35] will he revive us. In the third day he
[1:47:38] will raise us up and we shall live in
[1:47:41] his sight. Then we shall know if we fall
[1:47:44] to know the Lord his going from his pur
[1:47:46] as a morning and he shall come unto us
[1:47:49] the rain as a latter and former reign on
[1:47:53] the earth.
[1:47:58] The Jews were blinded
[1:48:01] that me and you could get in. Right.
[1:48:05] Huh. Exactly right. Amen. And even when
[1:48:09] they said, "Let his blood be upon when
[1:48:10] they crucified him and said, "Let his
[1:48:12] blood be upon our hands and upon our
[1:48:14] children." Now, and so they were spread
[1:48:17] out all over Europe.
[1:48:19] But there was a time,
[1:48:22] listen real close, there was a time they
[1:48:25] could only be blessed one place, and
[1:48:26] that was in their homeland. Right.
[1:48:31] God allowed Hitler to do what he did to
[1:48:34] them because they had to force them back
[1:48:38] to their homeland.
[1:48:40] So they killed them, burn them, done
[1:48:42] everything. And if you notice here about
[1:48:44] two years ago when ISIS attacked there
[1:48:47] in France, that was a Jewish people. It
[1:48:52] said a lot of people there in France
[1:48:54] went back to Israel. God allowed that to
[1:48:57] happen because brother that 144,000 has
[1:49:01] got to be there. He done already told
[1:49:03] you. Is that right?
[1:49:06] Okay. Now we find Hosea, you know,
[1:49:12] revive us. Give us a revival.
[1:49:15] Revive us. It takes something to revive
[1:49:18] us. And so his only thing, see, and the
[1:49:21] only way God dealt with them was the
[1:49:22] prophets. Amen. M right. Amen.
[1:49:28] And so we know that two witnesses come,
[1:49:30] two two prophets coming. But to revive
[1:49:33] us on the third day, how many knows
[1:49:37] three is a huh
[1:49:40] number of life, right? Going to ride us
[1:49:43] on the third day. God's going to graft
[1:49:45] them back into the vine. Huh?
[1:49:49] That's a promise of God. And when we see
[1:49:51] all these nations against Israel, huh?
[1:49:55] And now they're fussing whether Israel
[1:49:57] is going to build some more houses or
[1:49:58] not. Everything sitting on a time bomb
[1:50:02] and this thing going to explode,
[1:50:03] brother. Now I want to show something to
[1:50:06] you. Turn with me to Revelation the 11th
[1:50:09] chapter
[1:50:21] start at verse one.
[1:50:29] And there was given me a reed like unto
[1:50:32] a rod, and angel stood, saying, Rise,
[1:50:34] and measure the temple of God, and the
[1:50:37] altar, and them that worship there, but
[1:50:41] the court which was out the temple,
[1:50:43] leave out, and measure it not for he has
[1:50:45] give to the Gentiles.
[1:50:48] And the holy city shall they tread
[1:50:50] underfoot 40 and two months, three and a
[1:50:52] half years. And I will give her to my
[1:50:55] two wizards, and they shall prophesy
[1:51:00] 1,23
[1:51:01] score days clothe and sackcloth.
[1:51:06] These are the two olive trees and the
[1:51:09] two candlesticks standing before the God
[1:51:11] of earth. And if any man
[1:51:14] will hurt them, far proceeded out of
[1:51:16] their mouth that word and devour their
[1:51:19] enemies. And if any man will hurt them,
[1:51:22] he must in that manner be killed. They
[1:51:25] have power. Now what? They have power to
[1:51:28] shut the heavens that rain not in that
[1:51:30] days. Amen. And their prophecy and have
[1:51:34] power over waters turn into blood thing
[1:51:36] Elijah Moses and to smite the earth with
[1:51:40] all kind of plagues as they will.
[1:51:44] And they shall have finished when they
[1:51:46] have finished their testimony. The
[1:51:48] beasts that ascended out of the bottom
[1:51:50] of the pit shall make war against them
[1:51:52] and shall overcome them and kill them.
[1:51:56] and their dead body shall be in the
[1:51:58] streets of that great city which is
[1:51:59] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt
[1:52:02] for also the Lord was crucified and they
[1:52:05] the people in cander and tongues and
[1:52:08] nations
[1:52:09] shall see their dead body three days.
[1:52:13] Now, that could only come into the time
[1:52:17] we're living where they got satellites,
[1:52:20] they got television,
[1:52:22] where all nations can see those bodies
[1:52:25] laying there. Huh?
[1:52:28] It's down here. It wasn't some other
[1:52:31] time. It's now.
[1:52:33] And if you'll notice, let me finish.
[1:52:35] Notice
[1:52:37] those 12 tribes of Israel.
[1:52:40] The last one was a tribe of Benjamin.
[1:52:43] Now look who's the leader over Benjamin
[1:52:46] Net and how you all right? Just
[1:52:48] accident.
[1:52:50] Just one of them things that happens.
[1:52:53] Amen.
[1:52:54] Said and have and shall not suffer their
[1:52:57] dead bodies and put in grave and they
[1:52:58] shall dwell upon the earth and rejoice
[1:53:01] over them. They're going to rejoice over
[1:53:02] these prophets because they've caused a
[1:53:03] lot of troubles. and make merry and
[1:53:05] shall send gifts one to another because
[1:53:08] he true prophet torment them that dwell
[1:53:10] on the earth. And after three days
[1:53:14] and a half, the spirit of life from God
[1:53:17] entered in them. And they stood upon the
[1:53:20] feet and great fear fell upon upon them
[1:53:23] which saw it. And they heard a great
[1:53:25] voice from heaven saying, "Come up
[1:53:26] hither." And they sended up to heaven in
[1:53:29] the cloud and then and the enemy beheld
[1:53:31] him. And the same hour
[1:53:35] was there a great earthquake
[1:53:38] and the temporar the city fell and in
[1:53:41] the earthquake were slain of men 7,000.
[1:53:44] The remnant were a frightened and give
[1:53:46] glory to the God of heaven.
[1:53:48] Now the Bible tells us
[1:53:52] that the angels, four angels from east,
[1:53:56] north, south, west,
[1:53:59] they had to hold back
[1:54:01] the destruction,
[1:54:05] the wrath, the wars.
[1:54:08] They had to hold back until that 144,000
[1:54:13] Huh. receive the same message we got
[1:54:16] right now.
[1:54:17] God's word does not change. Amen. And
[1:54:22] so, brother, this is what we're running.
[1:54:25] This is what I'm trying to get across to
[1:54:27] you. You better stay focused on the word
[1:54:30] of God. You see what's going on earth.
[1:54:33] We've already been warned by the word of
[1:54:35] God. We know we're in Satan's Eden. We
[1:54:39] know we're in insane age. Huh? Look at
[1:54:43] the people's minds now. Totally insane.
[1:54:48] They people dress up like monsters
[1:54:50] something. Huh?
[1:54:53] Amen.
[1:54:55] Well, I don't want to go. I'm going to
[1:54:56] leave that alone. Amen.
[1:55:01] May Let me see one other thought or
[1:55:03] something, but I'm I'm closing.
[1:55:06] I'm closing here.
[1:55:10] Oh.
[1:55:14] Oh my I'm just trying to find one here
[1:55:18] to close on.
[1:55:20] Amen.
[1:55:25] We'll we'll close on this one. And
[1:55:28] Christ is a mystery of God. Right.
[1:55:32] Brother B says, "When I think it makes
[1:55:35] me shiver,
[1:55:37] oh to live with him, going home with him
[1:55:40] to live with him. going home with him to
[1:55:43] live with him forever, having eternal
[1:55:45] life. This God's great mystery
[1:55:51] of love expressed that God and man
[1:55:53] became one. See the whole thing is God
[1:55:56] and man, one. God and man was one there
[1:56:00] and God and man is one here. See what is
[1:56:04] it?
[1:56:05] being fulfilled with his spirit, having
[1:56:08] the preeminence,
[1:56:11] having the preeminence, right? All that
[1:56:14] he done for one purpose. That was God's
[1:56:18] achievement
[1:56:20] that he could get his life in you. He is
[1:56:24] achieved.
[1:56:25] That's God purpose to do that. And that
[1:56:28] might be Christ and Christ in us and all
[1:56:31] of us together one. The Holy Spirit same
[1:56:34] thing revealed to Christ revealed here
[1:56:36] the supernatural cre power of God. Oh my
[1:56:40] God's achievement when he has uh had
[1:56:44] preeminence in mind or mine. So stay
[1:56:47] focused
[1:56:49] my brothers and sisters on what God's
[1:56:51] called us to do. Don't get focused with
[1:56:55] things of the world.
[1:56:57] There's so much disease in the world.
[1:56:59] The hot you ain't got enough doctors.
[1:57:01] Some of these states they ain't got
[1:57:03] doctors things that everything's messed
[1:57:06] up so much people and prices keep going
[1:57:09] up up up.
[1:57:11] But I'll let all that go along. And if
[1:57:14] you stand with me this this evening.
[1:57:21] Amen.
[1:57:24] I just uh appreciate being here and
[1:57:27] brother Jack and family and church and
[1:57:31] uh
[1:57:33] if you would with me this morning
[1:57:37] and maybe a little something was said
[1:57:40] that you know you're guilty of
[1:57:44] while we bow our heads
[1:57:47] and you like to lift your hand say Lord
[1:57:50] that word.
[1:57:53] Search me out. You know my life
[1:57:57] and you want to be better. Let's just
[1:57:58] bow our heads.
[1:58:02] Father,
[1:58:04] Lord, as you serve him, Lord, I've put
[1:58:06] it out here, Lord.
[1:58:09] Might take a little long, Lord. I don't
[1:58:11] know.
[1:58:12] But help us, Father, to keep focused
[1:58:17] upon your word, Lord. Help us not hear
[1:58:20] anything else other than the word. Not
[1:58:22] be focusing on the things of the world.
[1:58:24] Father, it's come of destruction. It's
[1:58:27] coming destruction. God, help us stay on
[1:58:29] your word. Heaven and earth shall pass
[1:58:32] away, but the word of our Lord shall
[1:58:33] abide forever.
[1:58:35] Now, with uplifted hands,
[1:58:39] hands up, my hands up, too. Lord, help
[1:58:42] me stay focused on your word regardless
[1:58:45] of the cost.
[1:58:47] Father, bless this assembly. Bless those
[1:58:50] that attended. Bless the pastor and his
[1:58:52] family.
[1:58:54] Lord, we just love you. We praise you.

[1:58:59] Christ. Amen. Amen.

[2:06:59] life. We certainly appreciate uh brother
[2:07:02] Walker just sharing amen from his heart
[2:07:04] uh to our hearts on today. uh o over the
[2:07:08] um I think it was Thursday uh Thursday
[2:07:13] Thursday Thursday night we were headed
[2:07:15] to um Pinnacle Palms and uh as I was
[2:07:19] just coming out I just noticed all this
[2:07:21] traffic you know uh and and and outside
[2:07:24] of our development there and I said now
[2:07:26] something's wrong with all that traffic
[2:07:29] coming this way there there's something
[2:07:30] wrong uh with that and and I was telling
[2:07:33] my wife I said I don't know what it is
[2:07:34] but something has happened up here and
[2:07:36] and um um called and uh uh brother Troy,
[2:07:42] he went to he was there at Pinnacle
[2:07:43] Polls early. I said, "I'm going to be
[2:07:44] running late because there's a lot of
[2:07:46] traffic here. Something's going wrong
[2:07:47] here." He said, "Oh, oh, I forgot to
[2:07:49] tell you there was a accident, a fatal
[2:07:51] accident that happened there uh on your
[2:07:54] way." And um and uh you know when I I
[2:07:57] kind of come and got around and you know
[2:07:58] saw where the accident took place and
[2:08:00] and I was reminded uh some years ago,
[2:08:03] brother brother Walker and sister Walker
[2:08:05] had come here to visit us and uh they
[2:08:07] got into a really really bad accident.
[2:08:10] uh one, you know, the car was needed a
[2:08:13] lot of work and even had to take Sister
[2:08:15] Walker to the hospital and they
[2:08:17] misdiagnosed, you know, her uh didn't
[2:08:19] realize that she had a a a cracked rib,
[2:08:22] I believe. But they just misdiagnosed
[2:08:24] and sent her right on out. Uh but I look
[2:08:26] back over that and I said, man, the hand
[2:08:27] of the Lord was on them and keeping
[2:08:29] them. Amen. Uh because God has purpose
[2:08:33] for them, right? God has purpose for
[2:08:35] them. and and uh and when you look back
[2:08:38] over your own life and see how God's
[2:08:39] just protected you, how he's kept you uh
[2:08:42] from danger seen and unseen, then you
[2:08:44] know that he has purpose for you. And uh
[2:08:47] keeping the focus on your purpose in
[2:08:49] life is the best thing that you can do.
[2:08:51] So many things happening all around us
[2:08:53] in the news he's bringing out there uh
[2:08:55] what is happening with Israel and you
[2:08:57] know and and don't let these things just
[2:08:59] kind of you know go go by you. Uh these
[2:09:02] are signposts for us to let us know that
[2:09:04] the end is near. Amen. And there's
[2:09:08] coming a day where uh he that's holy
[2:09:10] going to be holy still. He that's filthy
[2:09:12] going to be filthy still. He that's
[2:09:13] righteous going to be righteous still.
[2:09:15] Amen. But there's a rapture waiting to
[2:09:17] bride. So uh church, I'm looking forward
[2:09:19] to it. I want to keep my focus, Amen, on
[2:09:21] what God placed me here in this earth
[2:09:24] for. Amen. Let's praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:26] One more time. Let's give God a hand of
[2:09:28] praise uh for the word spoken to us.
[2:09:32] Amen. We'll have a word of prayer and uh
[2:09:34] we'll prepare to dismiss. Uh I I did
[2:09:37] want to announce uh next uh Saturday
[2:09:40] typically we have our youth service.
[2:09:42] Amen. On next next the third Saturday of
[2:09:45] the month. Uh but next Saturday won't be
[2:09:47] a youth service. There will be a youth
[2:09:50] uh activity that'll be done here but not
[2:09:53] a youth service. So uh just uh keep that
[2:09:55] in mind. and we want all the youth to
[2:09:57] come and we got something that we just
[2:09:59] want to do uh for them just kind of uh
[2:10:01] just just uh fellowship with them a
[2:10:03] little bit. So, uh that'll take place.
[2:10:05] So, we're not necessarily putting a a
[2:10:07] great announcement out there for
[2:10:08] everyone, but for our young people, we
[2:10:11] want to do something for them. So, uh
[2:10:13] next Saturday, uh I believe 6:30 is when
[2:10:15] we usually start. So, let's just keep
[2:10:16] that in mind, uh for next Saturday. God
[2:10:19] bless you. No service Friday night.
[2:10:20] We'll be back on Wednesday night. Amen.
[2:10:22] For service, but no service Friday
[2:10:24] night. We'll be back Saturday for the
[2:10:25] youth amen uh activity and um and then
[2:10:29] the next service will be next Sunday. So
[2:10:30] let's pray. Amen. Father, we thank you
[2:10:32] for uh your word that has gone forth to
[2:10:35] our hearts, God. Something to uh remind
[2:10:37] us that we have purpose. Uh often times
[2:10:41] uh we thank our purpose stops with
[2:10:43] something natural, but God is something
[2:10:45] spiritual. We were created by you uh for
[2:10:47] you, for your glory, for your honor.
[2:10:50] That was the purpose that we were even
[2:10:51] uh that we even exist. So God, help us
[2:10:54] to find that and to bring glory and
[2:10:56] honor to you in everything that we do
[2:10:57] and everything we say. We pray your
[2:10:59] blessings upon brother Walker and sister
[2:11:01] Walker. God, we thank you for watching
[2:11:03] over them over the dangerous highways,
[2:11:05] just keeping them, Father, every time
[2:11:07] they get into the car. And uh Lord, uh
[2:11:10] no doubt the devil would have tried to
[2:11:12] get rid of them a long time ago, but
[2:11:13] your hand has been there covering them
[2:11:14] and protecting them. And we thank you
[2:11:16] for that, oh God. And as they prepare to
[2:11:18] leave, Amen. here this afternoon headed
[2:11:21] back uh home the long drive ahead. But
[2:11:24] God, we pray that you just give them
[2:11:25] traveling mercies. Uh let them make it
[2:11:27] to their destination tonight safely
[2:11:29] arrive awake in the morning and arrive
[2:11:31] home on tomorrow and just pray God that
[2:11:33] you continue to use them for your glory
[2:11:35] and for your honor. Thank you for
[2:11:37] allowing them to pass this way uh once
[2:11:39] more. Uh we just we always appreciate
[2:11:42] when they come, God. It's it's really

[2:11:47] Walker at 81 years old serving God and
[2:11:50] and sister Walker right there by his
[2:11:52] side. God, what a what a blessing it is
[2:11:55] to see that. And just pray God that you
[2:11:57] just continue to keep your hand on them,
[2:11:59] keep them safe and keep them healthy.
[2:12:01] And God, may you just use them for your
[2:12:03] glory, for your honor. Uh bless us now
[2:12:05] as we leave this place but not your
[2:12:06] presence. May all the mothers, Lord, uh
[2:12:09] receive their just due for being godly
[2:12:11] mothers and raising their children uh

[2:12:16] them abundantly. The fellowship that
[2:12:18] they'll have today, the different
[2:12:19] families getting together, Lord, just

[2:12:23] have. It's in Jesus name that we pray.
