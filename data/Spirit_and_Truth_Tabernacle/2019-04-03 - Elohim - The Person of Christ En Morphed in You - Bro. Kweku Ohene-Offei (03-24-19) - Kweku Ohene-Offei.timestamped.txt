[1:14:17] Elohim is Christ and more feet in us so
[1:14:22] let's be on our feet read a little
[1:14:25] portion of the Bible before we go ahead
[1:14:28] if you want to open to Book of Kings 2nd
[1:14:31] Kings chapter 2 verse 1 to 14 is quite
[1:14:36] lengthy but we will do it 2nd Kings
[1:14:39] chapter 2 verse 1 to 14
[1:14:51] second Kings chapter 2 verse 1 to 14 it
[1:14:55] came to pass when the Lord would take
[1:14:57] Elijah into heaven by the whirlwind that
[1:15:00] Elijah went went with Elijah from gilgul
[1:15:03] and Elijah said onto Elijah
[1:15:06] tarry here I pray thee for the Lord had
[1:15:09] sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto
[1:15:11] Him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:15:14] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:15:17] went both to Bethel verse 3 and the sons
[1:15:20] of the Prophet that were at Bethel came
[1:15:23] forth to Elisha and said unto Him
[1:15:25] knowest out that the Lord would take
[1:15:27] away thy master from the head today he
[1:15:30] said yeah I know it hold your peace and
[1:15:33] Elisha said unto Him
[1:15:35] Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the
[1:15:38] Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said
[1:15:41] as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:15:43] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:15:45] came to Jericho and the sons of the
[1:15:48] prophets they were at Jericho came to
[1:15:50] Elijah and said unto Him knowest now
[1:15:53] that the Lord would take away the master
[1:15:54] from the head today and he answered yeah
[1:15:57] I know it hold your peace vs. and Elisha
[1:16:02] said unto Him Terry I pretty he for the
[1:16:05] Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he said
[1:16:07] as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I
[1:16:10] will not leave thee and and the two went
[1:16:13] on and fifty men of the sons of the
[1:16:15] Prophet went and stood to you afar off
[1:16:19] and the two stood by Jordan and Elijah
[1:16:22] took his mantle smooth the waters and
[1:16:24] they were divided heetha and thither I
[1:16:27] wanted to go to those two ways
[1:16:29] heathyr NT that means here and there so
[1:16:32] that the two went over on dry ground and
[1:16:35] it came to pass that they were gone over
[1:16:38] that Elijah said to Elisha ask what I
[1:16:41] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[1:16:43] from thee and Elisha said I pray thee
[1:16:46] let a double portion of your spirit be
[1:16:49] upon me and he said thou has asked a
[1:16:53] hard thing nevertheless if thou see me
[1:16:55] when I'm taking from the it shall be so
[1:16:58] unto thee but if not it shall not be so
[1:17:01] and he came to pass us this thought went
[1:17:04] on and talked that behold there appeared
[1:17:06] a chariot of fire and horses of fire and
[1:17:10] parted them both as sander and Elijah
[1:17:12] went up by a whirlwind into heaven and
[1:17:15] Elijah saw it and he cried my father my
[1:17:18] father the chatter to Israel and a
[1:17:20] horseman thereof and he saw him no more
[1:17:22] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[1:17:25] ran them into two pieces
[1:17:27] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[1:17:30] that fell from him and went back and
[1:17:33] stood by the bank of Jordan and he took
[1:17:35] a mantle of Elijah that for that fell
[1:17:38] from him and smooth the waters and said
[1:17:40] where is the Lord God of Elijah and when
[1:17:43] he also had smitten the waters departed
[1:17:46] hideth Eva and Elijah went over amen
[1:17:50] shall we be seated
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:00] praise be to God God is good yes the lot
[1:18:05] is wonderful
[1:18:06] yes so we're gonna talk about Elohim we
[1:18:10] talk about Elohim Christ in you amen
[1:18:13] the person of Jesus Christ in you we
[1:18:16] want to see how we connected to Elohim
[1:18:18] is he very far from us this is somewhere
[1:18:22] on another planet and we are here on
[1:18:24] earth
[1:18:24] maybe Moon Jupiter Pluto mercury some
[1:18:28] planet someway we want to find out how
[1:18:32] God or the Great Creator the grid ll alo
[1:18:35] him is related to you and I amen the
[1:18:39] other time we spoke we talked about we
[1:18:41] look at a human and Composition that
[1:18:44] basically this human big to have six
[1:18:46] foot press on all six seven person who
[1:18:49] is about 350 when he dies and you
[1:18:52] increment him or her you burn him up
[1:18:54] it's gonna be one spoonful of ash that's
[1:18:57] all there is to it amen so on the flesh
[1:19:00] we do value much if you go to India the
[1:19:04] brain people when they die it's just
[1:19:05] about one spoonful of ash now God to
[1:19:08] this one spoonful of ash as a seed in
[1:19:11] your mother's womb in your father's
[1:19:13] loins and put them in your mother's womb
[1:19:15] to comfort as a baby then you begin to
[1:19:18] eat a calcium potassium the food that
[1:19:21] you eat the corn the potatoes the
[1:19:24] vegetables' they are all the elements
[1:19:26] that is in your body so you eat them to
[1:19:28] build your body up to where to gain more
[1:19:30] weight that is part of the earthly man
[1:19:32] because God wanted to manifest in this
[1:19:35] earth
[1:19:35] so without the ethnic person God cannot
[1:19:38] manifest in the eighth amen
[1:19:40] as we sitting here we've got angels
[1:19:42] around you've got your own guardian
[1:19:44] angel
[1:19:45] you've got Christ in you Jesus Christ is
[1:19:48] here Moses Elijah and other prophet are
[1:19:51] here in the dimension the celestial
[1:19:53] dimension but this eye is limited to see
[1:19:55] about a couple feeds amen but then we've
[1:19:58] got another eye that is what we want to
[1:20:00] talk about so this human composition is
[1:20:02] just about the cosmic light go to cosmic
[1:20:05] light and then out of the cosmic light
[1:20:07] we know that Sun was the first gas
[1:20:09] created the natural things the same with
[1:20:12] the Son of God the logos the pillar of
[1:20:13] fire was the first expression of Christ
[1:20:16] when God began to condescend come lower
[1:20:18] to the eighth so the Sun out of the Sun
[1:20:21] came different light God uses a cosmic
[1:20:24] light to create your body so when you go
[1:20:26] to hospital sometimes we do what they
[1:20:27] take your x-ray x-ray is part of the
[1:20:30] cosmic light we have the carbon hydrogen
[1:20:32] oxygen potassium phosphorus magnesium
[1:20:35] and all the elements about 16 of them
[1:20:38] damage the human body that is to help
[1:20:40] you to contact it to make contact to the
[1:20:42] eighth but and that is what every you
[1:20:45] amen so that is me that is me I'm five
[1:20:50] foot I'm four foot I'm whatever I
[1:20:52] weighed this pound yes at least speaking
[1:20:55] that is you but that is not a true you
[1:20:57] amen that is just about to contact the
[1:21:01] eighth and now that's that human body is
[1:21:04] powered by lesson but let's break it
[1:21:07] down like battery we have life
[1:21:08] flashlights some time we put batteries
[1:21:10] in them to power them to give them
[1:21:12] lights so this human flesh is powered by
[1:21:14] a lesson for batteries now in our time
[1:21:18] or in our generation God in the times of
[1:21:20] in the old paths that used to live to be
[1:21:22] 900 Adam was nine that is something
[1:21:25] right Methuselah was 960 something the
[1:21:27] almost 1,000 years but this time we
[1:21:30] don't grow
[1:21:30] I mean live that long we are given about
[1:21:34] four batteries to live
[1:21:35] now when you get to about twenty five
[1:21:37] the first battery dies of you so strong
[1:21:41] and kicking you could so jump and do
[1:21:43] whatever I want to do maybe up to about
[1:21:46] let's say between forty to fifty the
[1:21:48] second battery goes off you so go to
[1:21:51] batteries and it's a good you saw can
[1:21:53] run and do things you love to do then
[1:21:55] between let's say 50 unless is 75 for 65
[1:21:59] the third battery begin to what dice off
[1:22:02] then you've got only one battery to
[1:22:05] leave if you are blessed to be hundred
[1:22:06] you still go up battery of God's face
[1:22:09] you to give you two batteries you should
[1:22:11] go to batteries more to leave so by
[1:22:14] hundred 115 so it will live up to 120
[1:22:17] let's say all this you want to die you
[1:22:21] pray to die you'll be calling for there
[1:22:25] to come and take you out because using
[1:22:30] iPad and text message which you don't
[1:22:32] have a clue
[1:22:37] I think I've done all that I want to do
[1:22:38] take me from this earth so if not even
[1:22:42] bless you spare your life to be one
[1:22:44] one-twenty one-fifteen
[1:22:46] is a lot I don't want what else do I
[1:22:48] need to do on this planet this planet
[1:22:52] you want to switch out the dense battery
[1:22:54] and go to the other side amen
[1:22:56] and yes just a couple of minutes in the
[1:23:00] eyes of the Lord because if you take
[1:23:02] like a thousand years it's just about a
[1:23:04] day and also the eyes of the Lord so if
[1:23:06] you live to be 100 and 120 it's just a
[1:23:08] couple of minutes in the eyes of the
[1:23:10] Lord amen now this body is just like I
[1:23:13] said it's just earthly element we drink
[1:23:15] the body surf is about 75 to 85% of
[1:23:19] water that's why we need today they
[1:23:20] advise you to drink about eight cups of
[1:23:23] it what you call it a day classes of
[1:23:26] water every day because what I can do
[1:23:28] more for you than medicine can do so is
[1:23:31] the aura is part of that we're part of
[1:23:33] the body system right so that is about
[1:23:35] this body now when you move to the next
[1:23:37] room you've got a spirit man
[1:23:39] which is through in his hand which is
[1:23:41] help you to walk because your body can
[1:23:43] be separated from your spirit the body
[1:23:45] can lie here but if that spirit is not
[1:23:47] in the body it doesn't talk
[1:23:50] it doesn't hear it doesn't move it
[1:23:52] doesn't have a feeling it doesn't speak
[1:23:54] it doesn't smell it doesn't taste
[1:23:56] because their spirit and the flesh the
[1:24:00] flesh is just a clothing just like we
[1:24:01] wear clothing to be able to appear in
[1:24:04] public to be able to go outside
[1:24:06] now this cysteine element is to help you
[1:24:09] contact the earth because it's part of
[1:24:11] the earth it's important to God as long
[1:24:13] as you live here amen
[1:24:15] now that is part of the body desperate
[1:24:17] terrain has also got five senses it's
[1:24:21] got a sense of memory affection
[1:24:24] reasoning imagination and conscience the
[1:24:27] Lord Buddha went in there to help you
[1:24:30] contact the earth to help you remember
[1:24:32] even now when you call imitation who can
[1:24:34] remember the food that you ate to 2017
[1:24:38] 16th August
[1:24:39] who can tell me I had this type of food
[1:24:42] you don't even remember the restaurant
[1:24:43] you win even with that limitation you
[1:24:47] can remember the food that you ate
[1:24:49] you can't even know if you remember the
[1:24:50] place that you were at that time because
[1:24:52] this spectrum is also limited now we
[1:24:56] move to the next higher realm yes it's
[1:24:58] very helpful it helps you to remember
[1:24:59] dreams sometimes a lot show you dreams
[1:25:02] which is of eternal value so you have
[1:25:04] you have a remembrance of that remember
[1:25:06] your birthday remember your family
[1:25:08] you remember please that you went to so
[1:25:10] the Lord blesses with a human spirit to
[1:25:13] also manifest on this earth
[1:25:16] now the next room is the zoo which is
[1:25:19] more important to the Lord amen now
[1:25:22] being pawned by six there were three
[1:25:24] people who came by Plaza the original
[1:25:26] plan of God of course Adam was came from
[1:25:29] the mouth of God by the spoken word of
[1:25:30] God now God step Adam down to Eve mrs.
[1:25:34] Adam she came as what as a hybrid or as
[1:25:37] a clone from the part of the body of
[1:25:39] Adam
[1:25:40] she was loosely speaking white then
[1:25:42] Jesus who came by the original plan of
[1:25:44] God to come and redeem us by the spoken
[1:25:46] word of God
[1:25:47] it means the theory with him is that you
[1:25:49] funny he didn't need the Holy Ghost
[1:25:51] baptism no Jesus was really baptized as
[1:25:54] a gift on to the world as a sacrifice he
[1:25:57] was baptized in the river just taught to
[1:25:59] us a sacrifice unto the world but it
[1:26:02] wasn't bathtub because he was a sinner
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:04] by you and I needed to be baptized
[1:26:07] because we were not born right when we
[1:26:09] were born we were only limited to this
[1:26:11] earth we are grounded here we can go no
[1:26:13] further
[1:26:14] it just like parent grantee our children
[1:26:16] when children misbehave you are grounded
[1:26:18] you can't go out you know going to go to
[1:26:20] the restaurant with me you're not going
[1:26:21] to go to play you have your choice you
[1:26:23] only grounded to do your homework so
[1:26:25] because we are not born right we are
[1:26:27] grounded on this earth amen bye remember
[1:26:31] the story of the Good Samaritan before
[1:26:33] the foundation of the world
[1:26:34] we were not grounded before the
[1:26:37] foundation of the world we were part of
[1:26:38] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:26:40] world u.s. silesia you were a trainer
[1:26:43] you were in him you had a very life and
[1:26:46] thought of Christ remember we read you
[1:26:49] all that time that the thought of God is
[1:26:50] not like your thoughts that you plan of
[1:26:52] a boat building you're gonna build or an
[1:26:55] architect who plans to build a house now
[1:26:58] he matches the house in his mind you
[1:26:59] want to put in there's no more bedrooms
[1:27:01] for the person you want to do this one
[1:27:03] to do this he make a blueprint on paper
[1:27:05] then he translated into reality gas
[1:27:08] thought is not like that
[1:27:10] Gaston is real amen in other was when
[1:27:13] the Bible said that we were in him
[1:27:14] before the foundation of the world is
[1:27:15] not like we're sitting on his mind you a
[1:27:17] beam
[1:27:18] he were a person you were a trainer you
[1:27:22] couldn't cry you couldn't die you
[1:27:25] couldn't even whip you didn't understand
[1:27:27] what is solo you didn't understand what
[1:27:29] is death there was nothing like that in
[1:27:32] that civilization but then for the sake
[1:27:35] of redemption we had to come here you
[1:27:38] have to leave that glory and bypass it
[1:27:40] and come he auntie's death sorrow
[1:27:42] sickness afflictions suffering just name
[1:27:46] it
[1:27:47] all the negatives you can think about
[1:27:48] depression medication and what-have-you
[1:27:51] separation just understand Redemption
[1:27:54] because without that
[1:27:55] no need of redemption it's like you a
[1:27:58] human being
[1:27:58] it would be very surprising for human
[1:28:00] being crying I want to be a human being
[1:28:02] definite is that there's something wrong
[1:28:04] with this guy you already a human being
[1:28:06] if let's say a dog or fish want to be a
[1:28:09] human being
[1:28:09] praying to God Lord why don't you make
[1:28:11] me a human being you know to end your
[1:28:13] life like they are doing I'm I'm under
[1:28:15] the ocean I'm in the water all the time
[1:28:17] but I see him enemies around I want to
[1:28:19] be like them but there's no way humanity
[1:28:21] could be praying to God Lord make me a
[1:28:22] human being you already a human being
[1:28:24] angels of God and prayed to for
[1:28:26] forgiveness of sin they don't know what
[1:28:28] a son is not part india in the
[1:28:30] additionally but you and I were born
[1:28:32] limited on this planet born by the wrong
[1:28:35] bed sex as we explained that it was a
[1:28:38] permissible of God
[1:28:39] sex is what Satan if cross or the
[1:28:42] serpent if cross so but goddess who come
[1:28:45] in on cross what was the wrong way that
[1:28:47] we had so he came to Kaveri look at the
[1:28:50] X the X is what is perverted but they
[1:28:53] look at the cross of Calvary is vertical
[1:28:55] and horizontal so we were kind of stuck
[1:28:59] in the horizontal earth but in the
[1:29:01] vertical person the system mention
[1:29:03] Christ came in and connect with the
[1:29:05] earth to give the Holy Ghost baptism to
[1:29:08] bring us back to where we were before
[1:29:10] the foundation of the world
[1:29:11] amen praise be to God the Lord is good
[1:29:20] so that is that is the solution I
[1:29:23] mentioned that we were before so the new
[1:29:25] birth is what is restoring us back to
[1:29:28] where we used to be it just like this
[1:29:31] repose is here somehow it falls on the
[1:29:36] floor then I pick it back and restore it
[1:29:39] back to its original place so the new
[1:29:42] birth is before the furnish of the world
[1:29:44] where a person of Christ but then you
[1:29:47] separate it from that to come to me and
[1:29:50] redeemed because it was an attribute in
[1:29:52] you amen
[1:29:54] way before the foundation of the world
[1:29:56] the Lord asked who want to go to the
[1:29:58] eighth face Adam said I'll go is that
[1:30:01] what I'm going to do I'm going to set up
[1:30:04] the plan begin their own role
[1:30:06] rather the plan of redemption so Adam
[1:30:08] came to the earth as we know Adam was
[1:30:09] not born as a baby Adam was born just
[1:30:12] like around 30 year old person he was
[1:30:14] where he was the first Adam Jesus was
[1:30:17] the second Adam Jesus began his ministry
[1:30:18] when he was 30 so that was where Adam
[1:30:21] was he didn't have a mother physically
[1:30:23] his father and mother was the pillar of
[1:30:25] fire was God himself
[1:30:26] amen now we were not born that way we
[1:30:29] were born as baby on the ground tried to
[1:30:33] walk crow on the ground for a while
[1:30:34] before we walk right because we are
[1:30:36] limited now Jesus Christ was born as a
[1:30:39] bit before redemption seek he has to
[1:30:41] become part of us to be born as a baby
[1:30:43] although he was one perfect he was born
[1:30:46] through the few funny yes he was one as
[1:30:48] a human being because a human being can
[1:30:50] can't leave a human being amen if
[1:30:53] somebody falls into the water and you
[1:30:55] want to rescue the person you can't
[1:30:57] stand at the bank of the water and
[1:30:59] rescue them you have to what dive and
[1:31:01] bring them out sometimes they bite you
[1:31:03] you so don't even think about it you
[1:31:06] bring them out because they are not in
[1:31:07] their mind right the same way God has to
[1:31:10] dive from eternity deceased dimension to
[1:31:13] this lowest dimension to come and pick
[1:31:15] us from here this hell to suffer just
[1:31:18] like we suffered two footprints to get
[1:31:21] headaches to get rejection to even die
[1:31:24] to be modified so that his life eternal
[1:31:28] life in him that we bypass will come
[1:31:30] into you and I and that brings us back
[1:31:33] to where we are amen so the Holy Ghost
[1:31:35] but brings us back to the original
[1:31:37] position as sons and daughters of God
[1:31:40] amen
[1:31:41] who knows opposed because before a baby
[1:31:45] is born in the womb the baby doesn't
[1:31:46] know what goes on its own away but as
[1:31:49] nas is born the life that God ordained
[1:31:52] for the baby goes into the baby and the
[1:31:54] baby give the first year yeah you see
[1:31:58] suffering what will be scram when they
[1:32:00] are born who cry one is happy because he
[1:32:04] was comfortable in the mother's belly
[1:32:06] now here he is he has to try to breathe
[1:32:08] oxygen for the first time what kind of
[1:32:10] world is this well mine
[1:32:12] so friend begins the afternoon so
[1:32:15] transplant them to crime right the same
[1:32:17] thing we were born in sin shipping
[1:32:19] iniquity and we came to the world suffer
[1:32:21] and all kind of police upon earth was
[1:32:25] planned upon you but then God the Good
[1:32:27] Samaritan who is rich in mercy came down
[1:32:30] to rescue you to bring you back to where
[1:32:33] you are amen
[1:32:34] now when you look at the word when we
[1:32:36] are reading the scripture Elijah has to
[1:32:39] go through the Junction's we come to it
[1:32:40] and I said what Keitha
[1:32:42] sefa what is a old English word means
[1:32:44] here and there if you take a word here
[1:32:47] there here is a GRE the right there is
[1:32:52] th e re the difference is the T the T is
[1:32:55] what they feel funny
[1:32:57] that is a Mason way that is what we
[1:32:59] bypass instead of coming through it feel
[1:33:01] funny we came through what the sixth
[1:33:04] faith that limited as here we couldn't
[1:33:07] see visions we couldn't see the heavily
[1:33:10] dimension there was no supernatural in
[1:33:13] our life yes they feel funny the mind of
[1:33:16] God Christ Himself knew you that is your
[1:33:18] very bin amen there's nothing that is
[1:33:21] not part of creditors go back to Christ
[1:33:23] you are going back to class or you are
[1:33:25] in Christ because you are part of him
[1:33:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:27] amen you had a few funny way before you
[1:33:31] became a sinner way before the stars
[1:33:33] were ordained way before the first
[1:33:35] months in on earth we before adamant if
[1:33:38] we created you with a very life of
[1:33:40] Christ amen that is what the Lord wants
[1:33:43] us to see because sometimes we get the
[1:33:45] devil make has limited to the earth
[1:33:47] because we believed live here for ten
[1:33:49] years twenty years forty years hundred
[1:33:51] years whatever so all our - about the
[1:33:54] earth and things that we see we don't
[1:33:56] think so much about the other side
[1:33:58] because we don't see with our physical
[1:34:00] eyes amen
[1:34:01] just like Thomas when the Lord
[1:34:03] resurrected and so on the brother said a
[1:34:05] lot of resurrected so I won't believe it
[1:34:07] unless I see him in and put my fingers
[1:34:10] in the nails where he was pierced I
[1:34:12] would believe it because you want to see
[1:34:14] spannabis a Caracara you want to see a
[1:34:16] face to face but in the Lausanne Thomas
[1:34:19] don't be what a non-believer right the
[1:34:22] Lord want us to the beam of Christ by
[1:34:24] the new birth is
[1:34:25] you is that dimension that is it true
[1:34:28] you amen when you separate from this
[1:34:31] flesh you can treat this fictional way
[1:34:33] it came from the earth it goes out goes
[1:34:36] back to the earth all the elements all
[1:34:39] the orders shampoo that you use is not
[1:34:41] gonna matter all the clothes that you
[1:34:42] bought all the three pieces of suit
[1:34:45] whatever shoes whatever just name them
[1:34:47] they don't go with you you can't get a
[1:34:50] u-haul to pack your stuff and go with
[1:34:52] you because because you're not gonna
[1:34:55] need them that is just the eighth in
[1:34:56] Maine maybe somebody will inherit them
[1:34:58] or your house and bodies Anderson we
[1:35:01] need them well once we are here but then
[1:35:03] one is separate we are not going to need
[1:35:05] them
[1:35:05] now the Lord by the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:35:07] bring you back to a beam Amen that
[1:35:11] you're gonna need when you separate from
[1:35:12] this life and all you need here was you
[1:35:15] in this life amen that is the person of
[1:35:18] Jesus Christ
[1:35:20] Elohim amen so that is what you were
[1:35:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:25] now Elohim like I said we were part of
[1:35:29] him we were in him but then when we
[1:35:32] separated just for the attribute of
[1:35:34] redemption we went into Amin easier I
[1:35:37] mean it's a means you don't even know
[1:35:38] who you are
[1:35:39] we thought we were part of the world
[1:35:41] because we were born by the world you're
[1:35:43] thinking about the best thing is thing
[1:35:45] to be successful thing to have a future
[1:35:47] have some success story maybe go to
[1:35:50] college Buddha house get a job get a
[1:35:52] profession get married which is good
[1:35:54] because you're a human being you need
[1:35:55] them but then the real eternal purpose
[1:35:58] of God is goes beyond the earthly things
[1:36:02] that we desire which is good and okie
[1:36:04] God give them to us but then the more
[1:36:07] important is what is the heavenly
[1:36:09] dimension that he puts in you and I by
[1:36:13] predestination amen because you cannot
[1:36:16] manifest him without him in you that's
[1:36:19] what he said begin to preach
[1:36:20] seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:36:23] righteousness
[1:36:23] every other thing we give into you see
[1:36:26] the Holy Ghost baptism sink rising you
[1:36:29] make sure that crisis in you know stop
[1:36:31] at Jericho those two part yoga but go
[1:36:36] all the way to Jordan
[1:36:38] Yoda means cross anova Jeremy's new
[1:36:42] birth
[1:36:43] Yoda means that death to the old person
[1:36:46] the old man that we had sittin Lucifer
[1:36:49] the old book of life the old husband the
[1:36:53] old soul the old man just name in the
[1:36:55] old master the control tower that was
[1:36:57] the person who was permitted to me in us
[1:37:00] to show the attribute of redemption
[1:37:02] button at your new birth the pillow fire
[1:37:05] consumed the blow fire is the holy goose
[1:37:07] it consumed that person and then Christ
[1:37:10] is born in you because Christ was in you
[1:37:13] as his seed form even when we are born
[1:37:15] in sin but then it wasn't manifested
[1:37:18] asked as the new person he was
[1:37:20] protecting you it was direct in your
[1:37:22] life but then he wasn't manifested but
[1:37:25] at the appointed time the Word of God
[1:37:26] our was Odin for you comes to you and
[1:37:29] because you've got Christ as his city
[1:37:31] you deep calling for the deep amen
[1:37:34] Christ connecting to Christ because
[1:37:37] there was a part of him Elohim as a seed
[1:37:41] form in you but then by the new birth
[1:37:43] there's a quickening to take all the a
[1:37:46] monisha all that you forgot when you
[1:37:49] became a human being God began to feed
[1:37:51] you back your memory feed you back to
[1:37:54] who you were that you are a daughter of
[1:37:56] Christ you are eternal as goddess Athena
[1:37:58] you are Celestia's goddess Alicia
[1:38:01] you can't die asking God cannot die amen
[1:38:04] now you see how humans die why can't I
[1:38:07] die well let's look at the scriptures
[1:38:10] into into is we have scriptures that
[1:38:12] connected a physical person the human
[1:38:14] person it is appointed unto man once to
[1:38:17] die and after that what judgment that is
[1:38:21] the physical Sistine element that is
[1:38:23] going to break down the compost on thee
[1:38:25] or be rapture whatever when you get
[1:38:28] raptured is gonna break down anyway amen
[1:38:30] Enoch was raptured but he didn't take
[1:38:32] this fledged a celestial dimension this
[1:38:35] year but he dropped his flesh in the
[1:38:37] cosmos and then went to the Silesia in
[1:38:40] like the Elijah was ruptured but it
[1:38:42] isn't a consistent element to the
[1:38:43] Silesia dimension he dropped into the
[1:38:45] cosmos into the gases
[1:38:47] components then they'd feel funny the
[1:38:50] pillar of fire in him went to the other
[1:38:52] side
[1:38:52] amen and then when a poly cup a seven of
[1:38:55] God I think they killed him when was
[1:38:58] about to be crucified the pillow finding
[1:39:01] him spoke out he said Polly cup my seven
[1:39:03] is coming home
[1:39:04] amen he turned into like a DAF then
[1:39:08] became like a ship then he moved to the
[1:39:10] other side
[1:39:11] Steven when they were crucifying him
[1:39:14] Steven yeah he wasn't afraid he was he
[1:39:17] was he did me food the Silesia there was
[1:39:20] tuna in the cell sorry the treasure the
[1:39:22] sustain element they were cast in stone
[1:39:24] but I like a stone on you're gonna fill
[1:39:26] it but then the sitting element has a
[1:39:29] desolation I mentioned has taken taken
[1:39:32] over so that Alicia does even have a
[1:39:34] feeling so he was praying for them Lord
[1:39:37] forgive them don't vote their sins
[1:39:39] against them
[1:39:39] that is love divine that is preferred
[1:39:42] laughs Amen when somebody can offend you
[1:39:45] somebody can do you bad what are you do
[1:39:47] good do you pay you fo and from the deep
[1:39:50] from the sincerity of your heart you
[1:39:52] pray the Lord forgive them don't cut it
[1:39:53] against them don't judge them just
[1:39:55] change them let them see what is what
[1:39:57] love is
[1:39:57] amen and that is what the holy good can
[1:40:00] do for you if you don't have the Holy
[1:40:02] Ghost you can forgive people can hold
[1:40:04] grudges for four years or year she needs
[1:40:07] to me I'm never going to forgive him
[1:40:09] I'll pay him back I'll pray cases upon
[1:40:11] him or her because the old person is
[1:40:14] still there but then when Christ the
[1:40:16] pillar of fire takes over is forgiven
[1:40:18] it's lovin his patience is kind is
[1:40:22] embracing you wish the even lesson I
[1:40:25] don't want your worst enemy could to be
[1:40:28] in hell because you're reading hell they
[1:40:30] are suffering they are going through
[1:40:32] torment people are not happy they are
[1:40:35] always angry they already in hell by you
[1:40:37] what the dimension that is in you you
[1:40:39] want to impart a dimension you want to
[1:40:41] impart the Holy Ghost in them
[1:40:43] so if you come pray for a sinner if you
[1:40:46] can pray for people that have offended
[1:40:47] you if you come from your heart forgive
[1:40:50] those that have done you evil when you
[1:40:52] did them good it's one good sign that
[1:40:54] there's something in you amen
[1:40:56] that's eternity you blessed be the name
[1:40:59] of the Lord the Lord the Lord is good
[1:41:07] now we can look at new birth let's read
[1:41:09] one scripture here by chapter 4 Isaiah
[1:41:19] chapter 4 remarried to one to six I
[1:41:31] therefore one to six he said and in that
[1:41:35] day seven women shall take hold of one
[1:41:37] man scene we will eat our own bread and
[1:41:40] we're our own apparel only let us be
[1:41:43] called by thy name to take away our
[1:41:45] reproach in that day she had a branch of
[1:41:48] the Lord be beautiful and glorious and
[1:41:50] the fruits of the earth shall be
[1:41:51] excellent and comely for them that I
[1:41:53] escape of escape of Israel and it shall
[1:41:56] come to pass that he he that is left in
[1:41:59] Zion and he'll a dream in it in
[1:42:01] Jerusalem shall be called holy even
[1:42:03] everyone - that is written among the
[1:42:05] living in Jerusalem when the Lassa have
[1:42:08] washed away the filth of the daughters
[1:42:10] of Zion and shall have preached the
[1:42:12] blood of Jerusalem from the midst
[1:42:14] thereof by the spirit of judgment and by
[1:42:16] the speed of Benin and the Lord verse 5
[1:42:19] and a lot will create upon every
[1:42:21] dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon
[1:42:23] her assemblies a cloud and a smoke by
[1:42:26] day and a Shannon of a flaming fire by
[1:42:29] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[1:42:32] defence and there shall be a tabernacle
[1:42:34] for a shadow in the daytime from the
[1:42:36] heat and for a place of refuge and for
[1:42:39] the covered from storms and from rain
[1:42:41] amen he's talking about seven women the
[1:42:45] women represent a church they will take
[1:42:47] a hold of one man who is the man Christ
[1:42:50] almost a lot of people know what want to
[1:42:52] marry to Christ but now this we have got
[1:42:55] two groups of women one woman said that
[1:42:56] Lord
[1:42:57] we want to be caught by your name hey
[1:42:59] man we want to be caught by an one who
[1:43:00] caught mrs. Jesus Christ but then we
[1:43:04] were on clothing and eat our food in
[1:43:06] other words we just want to be called
[1:43:08] Christians so that people see us as
[1:43:10] Christians but we don't want their name
[1:43:12] is what it's an identity is the Holy
[1:43:15] Ghost baptism is Christ in you the
[1:43:17] apparel the clothing is not a clothing
[1:43:20] the spiritual uses that the scripture
[1:43:21] uses the natural things to type the
[1:43:23] spiritual things so we were closing on
[1:43:25] the outside the clothing is talking
[1:43:28] about is the gum and the holy goose on
[1:43:30] the inside so now the best one those
[1:43:32] women the seven women when a force women
[1:43:35] force bride first wife of Christ that
[1:43:38] they want to what married to Christ just
[1:43:40] want to call by the name but they don't
[1:43:42] want to pick on the nature the deity of
[1:43:44] Jesus Christ in them and that is what a
[1:43:46] lot of Christianity or for the millions
[1:43:49] and millions of Christians in the world
[1:43:51] about 99% and this category they love to
[1:43:56] go to church they give for charity they
[1:43:59] do different big things they have big
[1:44:01] televangelism tell-tell evangelism and
[1:44:03] outreach overseas and different things
[1:44:06] but is the deity of Christ are they
[1:44:08] wearing the clothes of Jesus Christ or
[1:44:10] they just have the name of a Christian
[1:44:13] the law doesn't want you and I to be in
[1:44:15] a position you want you toward to
[1:44:18] whether clothes the world that is being
[1:44:19] free to you to take it as a wedding you
[1:44:22] and what becomes you and you become the
[1:44:24] weight amen now verse 2 is the branch
[1:44:27] that the Lord wants us to be the branch
[1:44:29] of the Lord the branch of the Lord is
[1:44:32] the one that came from the pillar of
[1:44:33] fire came from the tree where does a
[1:44:36] branch come from is part of the tree it
[1:44:38] branches out to bring the leaves flowers
[1:44:41] seed and fruits to show the beauty of
[1:44:44] the tree so we came from Christ amen
[1:44:47] as a branch we didn't come from from
[1:44:50] from imagination but we came from the
[1:44:52] very hot amount of Christ to manifest
[1:44:55] the glory of the Father here and you
[1:44:57] cannot do it without the Holy Ghost
[1:44:58] baptism because it is Christ to manifest
[1:45:02] Christ amen and you become a tabernacle
[1:45:05] of God you become a dwelling
[1:45:07] lise you become the glory the very very
[1:45:09] glory of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:12] if God want to Bluff the devil he can
[1:45:15] talk that I would I go to West Palm
[1:45:17] Beach look at my daughter's to ensue
[1:45:19] look at my son the devil can see Oh your
[1:45:22] sign because Lord you bless him just
[1:45:24] like Jew you bless him his God job is
[1:45:25] God or the money is God house is God
[1:45:28] wonderful family that's why he loves you
[1:45:30] so well if you want just take his job
[1:45:32] you take this job and even he go to
[1:45:34] church is happy and rejoicing and
[1:45:36] praising God do whatever you want to do
[1:45:38] to him
[1:45:39] because why he's Christ himself amen God
[1:45:43] can't can't can't bet on you God can not
[1:45:46] say gamble but if God want to come we
[1:45:47] can gamble on you amen
[1:45:49] that you can push my son my daughter to
[1:45:51] the corner he so loves me because I am
[1:45:54] him and he's me amen
[1:45:56] is because of you that the world is
[1:45:58] consistent if it's not you the world
[1:46:03] would be blowing to pieces but God has
[1:46:06] got you on this planet is not finished
[1:46:09] with you and I and there may be more
[1:46:11] generations of your kind so the hand of
[1:46:15] the Lord is resting the Lord has not
[1:46:18] brought the judgment has already begun
[1:46:21] do but it does not combinated into the
[1:46:23] finality because you have toward
[1:46:25] manifest him on this planet you have to
[1:46:28] manifest him here on earth before
[1:46:31] everything comes to an end amen blessed
[1:46:34] be the name of the Lord now we can look
[1:46:36] at this new birth in two ways we can
[1:46:39] look it in a form of death and in a form
[1:46:41] of birth we're born face like I said by
[1:46:44] the natural birth through the an act
[1:46:47] which you're going to read some
[1:46:48] quotations here now truth at birth we
[1:46:50] were born as sinners all that we can do
[1:46:53] is be human beings we don't know nothing
[1:46:55] about a supernatural now the second
[1:46:58] birth come and kill the old birth the
[1:47:00] old book when a bubble's a book is not
[1:47:02] referring to a book like we think a book
[1:47:05] is alive like really a book you read
[1:47:06] something from a book to understand the
[1:47:08] documents now this is a book is bringing
[1:47:12] out alive a writing of God amen
[1:47:15] so you a book
[1:47:17] Facebook was not original plant plan of
[1:47:19] God but it was part of the plan of God
[1:47:21] issue his attributes so he permitted a
[1:47:23] book to live for whatever yes then it's
[1:47:26] ended the Lamb's Book of Life which is a
[1:47:29] true you the Holy Ghost baptism the
[1:47:32] attend a person they greet Elohim to
[1:47:34] come and quicken you to kill the old
[1:47:37] book to consume it out of existence
[1:47:40] that's why the Bible said that you had
[1:47:41] justified Santa fide cleanse baptized
[1:47:45] and you have no son somebody can say oh
[1:47:49] I know this man he was he was a thief
[1:47:51] that was caught in the dollar shop he's
[1:47:53] got a criminal record but before God if
[1:47:55] you don't have no criminal record
[1:47:57] because the man that was a thief is dead
[1:48:00] he does admit as this no more
[1:48:02] is consumed out of existence it doesn't
[1:48:04] exist in any dimension so to God you are
[1:48:07] justified profit class and there's no
[1:48:11] record of you being a criminal or being
[1:48:14] a thief but to the world
[1:48:16] oh yes I know this lady she was a
[1:48:18] prostitute to the world to God rehab was
[1:48:21] not a prostitute
[1:48:22] amen she only came to plead a contrast
[1:48:25] so that you Joshua means Java salvation
[1:48:28] can be a severe Amen now that is the the
[1:48:32] Beth we can look also as a death
[1:48:36] da-daddy you dive after that the Babu
[1:48:38] said had died to yourself but Rama she
[1:48:40] said that yourself how can I die to
[1:48:42] myself do I take a machete and cut my
[1:48:44] head no do I go and hang myself
[1:48:46] no that would not give you the new birth
[1:48:48] now not take the presence of God but the
[1:48:51] death is talking about is a supernatural
[1:48:52] death amen that the old person the old
[1:48:56] book the old you the old sue the old
[1:49:00] person that was the old husband the old
[1:49:02] way that was ruling you limiting you to
[1:49:04] the earth that pass will be consumed
[1:49:06] then the new person Christ Himself would
[1:49:10] take your 16 element and recreated Amen
[1:49:13] when you are born again you are not the
[1:49:15] same person I used to be but ROM said
[1:49:17] that you can take a sauna and a saint
[1:49:20] a person that has been born by the Holy
[1:49:22] Ghost Christ is living in them on
[1:49:24] outward sign Deluca layers they are all
[1:49:26] cysteine element they all human beings
[1:49:28] but in the eyes of God even the atoms
[1:49:30] and the molecules of the body has been
[1:49:32] recreated that's what the Bible said
[1:49:34] that you are a new creation when you
[1:49:36] when you are born again Romans 8:1 there
[1:49:39] is no condemnation in them that have
[1:49:41] been taught that are in Christ all the
[1:49:43] old things have passed everything has
[1:49:45] become new amen there's a song that I
[1:49:48] think we know said I'm a new creep
[1:49:52] I'm a new creation I'm a brand-new man
[1:49:57] all things they have passed that we have
[1:50:01] been born again
[1:50:02] more than a conquerer and as who you are
[1:50:07] all things they have passed away you be
[1:50:11] born again so the oceans have passed
[1:50:15] away the old man is gone and is dead
[1:50:18] not only divorce programs that don't
[1:50:20] just divorce him and put him there and
[1:50:22] go marry him back but make sure that
[1:50:24] he's dead and gone he doesn't exist no
[1:50:26] more he doesn't tempt you no more amen
[1:50:29] let's resume few quotations here I want
[1:50:33] to take our time the Lord he is good
[1:50:37] blessed be his holy name let's read
[1:50:46] Bobby is going to be a lot of lengthy by
[1:50:53] the help of God we want to just bring it
[1:51:00] written out so that it ever will not
[1:51:01] tell you that you are not born again

[1:51:10] are him amen
[1:51:11] he wanted to know that he's you he's
[1:51:14] living in you so that when he says I
[1:51:16] want to preach when Jesus was in they
[1:51:20] wanted to stone him right and the Bible
[1:51:22] said that he vanished how did he vanish
[1:51:24] tell me did he run away oh please don't
[1:51:27] throw the stone on me like maybe the

[1:51:39] was he controlled assistant
[1:51:41] element he can break it and put it
[1:51:44] together so when the people were killing
[1:51:46] him it wasn't the time to be crucified
[1:51:47] they have grabbed their big stones rocks
[1:51:49] they're gonna throw him he look into him
[1:51:52] and he brought the system element out of
[1:51:54] existence and the pillow find him went

[1:52:28] sacred thing to God and it's recorded in
[1:52:30] a book God is the author of life do you
[1:52:33] believe that our natural our natural
[1:52:36] life here we have is just a perversion

[2:02:29] tired you have got a human limitations
[2:02:32] you have to
[2:02:33] to get some rest even Jesus after
[2:02:35] preaching he's not died he was fast
[2:02:37] asleep on the boat he was a hundred
[2:02:39] percent human being but then when they
[2:02:41] see begin to when I begin to drown there
[2:02:44] was this boisterous when coming against
[2:02:46] a ship that ever wanted to sing them as
[2:02:48] I am now the pita and cool by then
[2:02:50] didn't happen Holy Ghost baptism because
[2:02:52] Christ has now gone to cover so all the
[2:02:54] Fountain of Life was leaning Jesus
[2:02:56] Christ but Jesus wanted toward put our
[2:02:59] life in them so Peter and CO begin to
[2:03:01] cry and scream Lord we are perishing
[2:03:03] they working from sleep and he said
[2:03:05] peace be still and the wind obeyed him
[2:03:09] and I said what manner of man is this
[2:03:12] he's really the real weirdo how can you
[2:03:16] speak to the winner the wind obey him
[2:03:17] they didn't know that they had a very
[2:03:19] person but I did or Pentecost the loss
[2:03:22] that are ago but I'll not leave you
[2:03:24] comfortless now come back so when he
[2:03:27] died three days he came back is directed
[2:03:29] and then he came a simple of fire the
[2:03:31] same cry seen in Jesus came into them
[2:03:34] and the same people who a coward could
[2:03:37] in a huge sickness couldn't heal
[2:03:39] epilepsy we were fighting among
[2:03:42] themselves would be the biggest in the
[2:03:43] kingdom of God now the Holy Ghost took
[2:03:46] over their flesh the assistant element
[2:03:47] and the women and the men were speaking
[2:03:49] in tongues and the Holy Ghost we're
[2:03:51] baptizing people and they were converted
[2:03:53] sinners unto Christ what made the
[2:03:55] difference
[2:03:56] it was Christ in them Elohim the very
[2:03:59] person of Jesus Christ in the assisting
[2:04:01] element was making the difference Amen
[2:04:03] so the difference in your Christian life
[2:04:05] is not how beautiful how handsome you
[2:04:07] are but is the person of Christ that
[2:04:10] transformed you amen glory hallelujah
[2:04:16] bless with the last the last one when we
[2:04:20] bring it to an end let's read a future
[2:04:22] home
[2:04:28] future home of blessed be the Lord
[2:04:40] future home of the heavenly groom and
[2:04:43] earthly bride
[2:04:56] okay here we feature of 1964 Oh 802
[2:05:01] paragraph 96 now let's see what the
[2:05:04] devil can trick some of us paragraph 93
[2:05:08] some of us might not know whether we are
[2:05:09] born again or not they said a man can
[2:05:11] repent of sins and it's so thinking of
[2:05:13] well maybe if it's an immoral man every
[2:05:16] immoral looking woman he finds is though
[2:05:19] they may be he's a drunkard every time
[2:05:21] he smiles the drink alcohol is thought
[2:05:24] they see but then when he gets satisfied
[2:05:26] that cleanses the desire out of him it
[2:05:29] takes the want of it away
[2:05:30] he can still be tempted but it but he
[2:05:33] takes the want of it away still he's not
[2:05:36] right yet then he's baptized with the
[2:05:38] Holy Ghost and fire cleanse burnt out
[2:05:41] clean up and then put in the service of
[2:05:44] God amen
[2:05:45] now many people can be justified there
[2:05:48] are lot of Christians who are justified
[2:05:49] they are living holy live they are
[2:05:51] cleanse yesterday I don't have the
[2:05:53] person of Jesus Christ in them so now
[2:05:55] being baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:05:57] Christ in water is not enough being
[2:06:00] cleanse washed is not enough but then
[2:06:04] the person of Jesus Christ has to come
[2:06:05] in by this election by the Holy Ghost
[2:06:08] baptism and consume the old person and
[2:06:11] all its works and then recreate you and
[2:06:14] I after the image of Mecca Selleck amen
[2:06:17] so that you become the very person of
[2:06:19] Jesus Christ walking upon earth then you
[2:06:22] become a complete work that God can use
[2:06:24] you but in the justified City s you live
[2:06:27] in the outer door today you are warm
[2:06:29] tomorrow you are cold when you come to
[2:06:32] the church that what is preach you on
[2:06:34] fire when you get out of the church then
[2:06:36] your revive is over because the rava is
[2:06:39] external Reviva when the atmosphere is
[2:06:42] created you are good but then when you
[2:06:44] are by yourself then the alcohol begin
[2:06:46] to thinking or don't you good
[2:06:47] go get me a coho because the old person
[2:06:50] is thought there when you are cleansed
[2:06:53] you are cleansed you don't have the
[2:06:55] desire even for alcohol you don't have
[2:06:57] desire for women and men by yes you are
[2:07:00] not right because the pest
[2:07:01] Jesus Christ is not baptized in your
[2:07:03] heart but then when you become perfect
[2:07:05] when you are perfected is when you cross
[2:07:08] over Jordan like Elijah was fully an
[2:07:11] enlarger he had his courage meant that
[2:07:13] sons of the Prophet told him that your
[2:07:15] master is gonna be taken away from you
[2:07:16] in other words you're gonna die but he
[2:07:18] persisted he persevered and went with
[2:07:21] Elijah even lascia
[2:07:23] Elijah said that I'm going to delay I'm
[2:07:25] going to the Lord is calling me to
[2:07:26] Bethel I don't have time out we got a
[2:07:29] lot missing we take it out since I'm on
[2:07:30] Bethel is a go guy is confession which
[2:07:34] everybody can confess just like seven
[2:07:36] women in Isaiah chapter four they want
[2:07:38] to marry Jesus Christ but they don't
[2:07:40] want to take the nature of Christ in
[2:07:41] them they just want to be church members
[2:07:43] they want to be good people in the
[2:07:45] neighborhood but then when you move
[2:07:47] further to Bethel better means now you
[2:07:51] have word not only confessing but you
[2:07:53] are making a fellowship you are moving
[2:07:55] another step further now put in your
[2:07:57] action in two ways that is so not enough
[2:08:00] to be in Bethel you are cleansed and
[2:08:02] justified but then you have to go
[2:08:04] through Jordan Jordan means crossing
[2:08:06] over to the other side
[2:08:07] you're gonna die supernaturally the old
[2:08:10] desire has to be has to be burnt out the
[2:08:12] old person has to be consumed then
[2:08:14] Christ himself the sixth seal takes over
[2:08:17] Braham so that when you our God calls
[2:08:19] you he post judgment on you not judgment
[2:08:22] to kill your flesh or not judgment to to
[2:08:25] bring sickness on you now the judgment
[2:08:27] to cut the old person the sixth seal is
[2:08:30] a judgment seal it's a battling seal
[2:08:32] it's a consuming so so the CC comes from
[2:08:35] the old person then the seventh seal is
[2:08:38] a relaxing seal it's a still of rest
[2:08:40] it's a still of peace then he become a
[2:08:43] lamp of God
[2:08:44] wrestling you it comes like a lion to
[2:08:47] fight the devil consume that have the
[2:08:48] habits of the world out of you since
[2:08:50] that we have been doing over the years
[2:08:51] sins of the world the demon that I have
[2:08:54] between you
[2:08:55] you see you to do things that are
[2:08:56] contracted the Word of God the sixth
[2:08:58] seal comes as a lion to consume them
[2:09:01] then you cross to Google and Bethel then
[2:09:04] you come to Jordan that is where the
[2:09:07] consuming take place God comes to say
[2:09:10] Lord I'm a vessel for your consumption
[2:09:11] and you consume you and he
[2:09:13] create his image himself in you amen
[2:09:17] and you become a brand-new person and
[2:09:19] whatever you speak is not you speaking
[2:09:22] is the critter in you speaking the
[2:09:24] whether you see is he an amen amen
[2:09:28] because first you were bound to hear you
[2:09:30] didn't have that few fun is not is not
[2:09:32] working manifesting you like you're
[2:09:34] supposed to be but when you move there
[2:09:36] when you die and move to over to the
[2:09:38] other side of Jordan then they feel
[2:09:39] funded illegals the pillar of fire which
[2:09:42] is the same person is not different
[2:09:44] person the Holy Ghost the Bible uses
[2:09:46] different technologies for the same
[2:09:47] thing when the Holy Ghost comes into you
[2:09:49] we call it Holy Ghost baptism when it's
[2:09:52] not doesn't repent and it dies we call
[2:09:55] it the lake of fire it consumed him but
[2:09:57] we want to be consumed here so that when
[2:09:59] you get the other side we are free amen
[2:10:02] shall we be on our feet shall we pray
[2:10:09] Heavenly Father we thank you we bless
[2:10:11] your name for this little pieces of word

[2:10:55] in a manifestation just as you put
[2:10:57] things into creation for that the same
[2:10:59] Authority has been invested in our
[2:11:01] hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:02] to speak it things into creation and to
[2:11:05] take things out of creation because when
[2:11:07] we speak it is not read us speak but
[2:11:09] it's you in us speaking father we love

[2:12:09] preaching of the word this morning the
[2:12:12] Lord praise often amen thank you my
[2:12:16] precious brother Amen a lot of things
[2:12:18] were said in there and man you notice
[2:12:21] when he was talking about how once we
[2:12:25] get to the age of accountability you
[2:12:28] know as a little child you do things
[2:12:30] wrong again you know you're being taught
[2:12:32] not to do things but once you get to a
[2:12:35] point you know you're doing things wrong
[2:12:37] and you hiding and sneaking and things
[2:12:40] like that there's a record that's being
[2:12:43] kept and I like the way he put that it's
[2:12:45] a supernatural record
[2:12:47] it's a record in the mind of God and
[2:12:49] also a record in your mind that keep you
[2:12:53] from until you can you get that thing
[2:12:55] confessed and you go through the proper
[2:12:58] channels it's going to stay there and if
[2:13:01] you die in that condition then there's
[2:13:06] no more hope see right now you're under
[2:13:09] the opportunity of grace
[2:13:12] what a glorious opportunity that we have
[2:13:15] this morning because grace is still his
[2:13:18] the blood is still on the mercy seat all
[2:13:21] you have to do is confess your faults
[2:13:25] confess your sins you know you you you
[2:13:29] know you're doing things that you
[2:13:31] shouldn't be doing you know you're
[2:13:33] living in sin and and and see sometimes
[2:13:37] we go through different things and I
[2:13:38] life in different troubles in our life
[2:13:40] and we wonder well why are we going
[2:13:42] through this and why my battling these
[2:13:43] things and why's this happening that
[2:13:47] turned the hand of Jehovah moving you
[2:13:51] into a place he wants you to confess he
[2:13:56] wants you to go free but he's allowing
[2:13:58] these things these troubles to come into
[2:14:01] your life to put you in a position that
[2:14:03] you can repent and give God your life
[2:14:07] now even after that there's things
[2:14:09] you're gonna go through there's things
[2:14:12] you're gonna go through but see the
[2:14:13] beauty of it and is knowing that even
[2:14:16] mean once you get to do that and you've
[2:14:20] crossed over to Jordan and you know all
[2:14:22] of your sins are confessed and your
[2:14:24] garment is clean there's nothing you can
[2:14:27] do to me because even in death I win see
[2:14:33] so then there's a piece that's the peace
[2:14:36] that passes all understanding but until
[2:14:39] you have that peace then you know
[2:14:41] whether you got that peace of mind let
[2:14:44] every man examine himself you know
[2:14:47] whether you got that peace of mind and
[2:14:49] you know the beautiful thing about it
[2:14:51] God is calling your name if you feel
[2:14:55] that tug on your heart that thing is
[2:14:57] bothering you right now talking about
[2:14:58] saying well Lord I know I did this right
[2:15:01] now there's a battle going on there's a
[2:15:03] battle going on God is drawing you and
[2:15:06] Satan is in your mind
[2:15:08] I don't listen that dad don't do that
[2:15:12] see he wants you to stay by but there's
[2:15:15] an opportunity right now for you to go
