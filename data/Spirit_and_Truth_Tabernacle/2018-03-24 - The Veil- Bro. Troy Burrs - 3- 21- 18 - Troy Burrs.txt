we trust in you for our anchor Lord holes Lord God beyond the veil we're not depending on nothing on on this side on this side on this dimension but our ankle goes beyond the veil and grips or rock lord god that rock is Jesus Lord Lord offer we know that the thing that we cannot see are more real than the things that we can see we ask you to just minister Lord God to your people or God I pray and I accident blessings in Jesus name Amen amen you may be seated and thank you all for a man coming out I should have pray for me we're gonna continue on in the book of Hebrews try and keep it sort of like a teaching so if we may do some read a man but I'm sure I trust it'll be a blessing to you I tell you about the real blessing to me as I was studying it and just looking through the scriptures like these things a man so let us turn on our bibles we're gonna go right there to Hebrews six Hebrews six and we're gonna pick up at the nineteenth verse couple scriptures there and media after that we're gonna flip over to Genesis 1:26 1:26 thank you lord I seen the fraud about amen amen it says which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is with us I'm into where the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec a man which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into interest into that within the veil amen in a in the message that our Hebrews the property really starts to break down a man at the veil so we want to speak a moment and we just want to concentrate on the veil this afternoon the veil amen and uh turn to Genesis 1:26 Genesis 1:26 a man and God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth a man and God said let us make man in our image a man now we see in John 4:24 he said that God is a spirit and he that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so if he made man in his own image what you see with your physical eyes is not the image he was talking about because God is a spirit now if we go over here to the second chapter of Genesis and the seven later on and it says and the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul so now we see that God made man in His image gave him dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air over the cattle and over all the earth then later on he took that earth and formed a body so that that spirit Cantwell in there is your veil now we're veiled in a body after the order of melchizedek with well we're not after the autumn eka that he was after the order of melchizedek but just like look at that we were veiled in a body a man now even that he gave us dominion over that body he gave us dominion over that earth he gave us dominion over everything the sea the fowls of the air and everything that creepeth and crawls upon that earth at that time Adam was control in control he was like an amateur God on the earth until the fall took place and we know that everything that the serpent was cursed a man that the woman was cursed and the earth was cursed a man and that's when the death set in at his body and things changed for Adam at that time Adam had the ability because he knew who he was he had the ability he knew what God wanted him to do and what God didn't wanted to do but after that he had an enemy because that veil was no longer sanctified because it was cursed now he had to fight his literal self his own flesh and we're veiled this even the Prophet said here the veil is the flesh and the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face-to-face in my listen he says in this church the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels now I want to say that like this in this church the veil is what keeps us from physically seeing that angels at every chair we know that the Bible says that our and Hebrews that he will never leave us nor forsake us now we hear that but our faith has to to take us beyond the veil to see that he's right there with us all the time we see that the scripture says in Psalms 34 several tonight that the angels of the Lord are encamped around about those who fear Him that means that there are literal angels encamped around you everywhere you go but the veil hinders you from seeing it we're in a veil of flesh this flesh this body is was is is can only contact this earth these five senses of see taste smell touch and hearing to give us contact with this earth in this dimension and well see in our in our and in some in our minds that we want to think that here we know that God is always watching but we put God on a throne way above somewhere and say that he's looking down and he's watching everybody know he is right next to you you just can't see him he is right besides you as you travel the highways the prophet of God was talking about he says up that accident that you barely avoided God was literally not figuratively right there we have to be able to open our eyes these are the things that a prophet was able to see and Express to us in this hour that if we can ever get a revelation that it's not some far-off mystical something other that it is literally right here God is here there are angels here right now right now and he wants to shine a light from it looks like wonderful to see people have a mind and a thirst to come to the house of the Lord I believe we ought to come to church five days a week and go to church go to work two things and a perfect society that's the way it could have a much better society that would be all right with me because he when I come to the house of the Lord it gives an opportunity for the light of the gospel to shine on the dark places of my life so that I have an opportunity to repeat and once I repent that literal body is there on the mercy seat making intercession and it is cast into the sea does forgetfulness never to be remembered no more never to be seen so anytime oh Lord I can be in the presence of Almighty God just show up the dark places I remember as a child we used to go to the dentist we go to the dentist's you had your shoe this red dye appear to show all of those places where you haven't been rushing to good and you chew it up - thank you my man I've done like I got ended I knew I was coming to the dentist today so I well I got got all in it true that look I feel you show you - look mirror oh boy what it shows the places that you list that you might unknowingly shine a light on those spaces that you need to give a little more attention how many that glad for that all we won't it's funny to hear him say well done my good and faithful servant so God who is rich in mercy gives us each day another opportunity to be in his presence so that he can fellowship with us that was his desire in the beginning every evening he came down and he's a Adam if they fellowship in the cool of the evening see the children of Israel in the wilderness they had to eat of the vent of the manna every day they couldn't save it it had to be fresh every day a revelation had to come every day they had to feed on the provided word every day and we can't get a revelation or something one time and think that that is going to sustain us it has to be a fellowshipping around the things of God every day every day we wake up every day before we lay out here to bed we must spend time with the Lord to show the dark places always abiding in the things of the Lord amen now we talking about this veil the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their position standing by the seats what keeps us from seeing him we are here behind a veil behind a veil and that veil is flesh we are sons and daughters of God we're in the presence of God amen but the veil of flesh is what keeps us out of his presence but through the soul and the spirit by our faith we know he's watching us and he's standing right beside us and he's here now let us look at second Kings the sixth chapter in the seventeenth verse a man second King six chapter 17 verse Reed's here and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee that she opened his eyes well let me go back so I can lay a little platform here of what I'm talking about I meant to start from the egg and the king of Syria award against Israel and took counsel with the surface saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent into the king of Israel saying beware thou pass not such a place for the Syrians are come down and the king of Israel to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of the Syria was so troubled and the king and he called his servants and said unto them will ye show me which of us is the king of Israel and one of the servants said non my lord o king but Elisha the prophet and that is an Israel tell us the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in my bedchamber and he said go and spy where he is and that I may sin and bring and bring him and it he was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore he said to the horses and chariots and great hopes and they came by night and compassed about the city and when the servant of the man and of God was risen early and gone forth behold a host compassed about the city both with horses and chariots and his servants saying unto Him alas my master how shall we do and he said fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened his eyes and the young man of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elijah and when they came down to him Elijah prayed unto the Lord and said smite these people are crazy with blindness and he smoked them with blindness according to the Word of God now we see two things happen here he took the veil from the young man's eyes or he can see that there were Church that the angels was encamped around them and then he turned around and blood in his enemy so they couldn't find it now isn't that a perfect type of what's going on today the veil is being ripped moved from I that we may see Christ and others that continue to scholars and marking and continue to hold to their Creed's are continually being blinded continually being blinded let us look at Luke 24 Luke 24 chapter xiii verse amen Luke 24:13 amen and behold two of them went the same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem of about threescore furlongs and they talked together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason Jesus himself drew near and went with him and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that ye have one with another as you walk and our sad and one of them whose name was Cleopas answering saying unto him thou art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they say unto Him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and were and word and before God and all the people and not a chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him but we trust we trusted that he had been trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yeah and certain woman also of our company made an astonished which were early at the cell feature the supporter and when they found found not his body and came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went into the supporter and found it even so as the woman has said but it about him they saw not and they said unto them o food and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all not Christ have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and being and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures and things concerning himself and they drew near unto him drew near unto the village whether they went and he and he made as that as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meet with them he took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to them and when their and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished from their sight and they said one to another didn't our hearts burn within us while he talked to us by the wayside and while he opened to us description Amen so we see that these two fellows the first thing is that they was walking and they were fellowship and around the things of the Lord they wasn't just have a no idle conversation but they was astonished at the things that had happened and they was just reminiscent of the good old days when Jesus walked the earth and the things that he done fellowship and around the things of God and in the midst of that conversation the Lord Droon in when you yourself fellowshipping with one another talking which was with one another and having conversation and your conversation is on the Lord there's no mistake about it my brothers and sister he draws near many times when you you are talking to different ones and different things you can feel a man the atmosphere change during the conversation that is when he drew right in and joined into the conversation a man a man stinking not giving a given a testimony a man let's go to the message reaction to an action 5908 10 a man 59 0 18 and I'm a depend on you but so I don't have to look at it in my phone I don't have a little fancy gadget okay the flip and things like that but I get there I'm sorry paragraph 28 a man you love the Lord Amen what I'm trying to get us a seat search is that the promise we hid in this veil but we we must use our faith eyes to look beyond the veil and see what's really going on around it meant to see what God is trying to give us - Amen that a man and that it's when we come to church and become the church let's not come to church lackluster let's not come to church as it's just another service because the God is here the presence of the Lord is here and he's here to meet every need but he you have to you have to recognize it see when you recognize when you can when you can look the hallelujah when you can look beyond the veil and recognize your faith muscles increase see when you step out of this flesh when you get out of self and and and and and and and step into that spirit realm your by faith and realize who you are who he is and that he's right here just begging you let me in he wants to do it the head of it you want it but we have to get out of flesh we have to press beyond this veil this is not hope that this who we see is not us it is just a veil that we we use to go to work and to contact things on this earth in this realm but we have to be able to to by faith go beyond this veil where we're seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus and have a revelation of that and there's no thing can be held from us when we get that revelation amen thank you sister and if you're sure that you're born of the Spirit of God and you have the Holy Ghost the promise of God is yours I don't care what the devil does you can still rest assured faith takes it on faith takes an unmovable stand faith cannot rest upon the shifting sands of man's theology but it takes a solemn stand on the rock of ages' which is unmovable there it rests with assurance no matter what comes or what goes my faith holds how sick I get how contrary it looks and how this is my faith and how contrary looks and how this is my faith is anchored within the veil and nothing can move it now you can't Bluff it you got to have it last pastor say your life speak so loud but I can't hear what you're saying you can't Bluff it and he knows and he also knows when you got it your heart your heart condemns you you're not not in you're a Christian you have a right to every promise that God made in this book it's yours no matter what the consequences is what the outcome you don't look at your you don't look at that you look at your faith and God gives you gives you to that promise to the promise then it stands there nothing will move it a man how she must have felt she met every requirement she met every requirement that God told me to do the barrel is down to one little handful of meal and the cruise is just a spoonful of oil enough I'm sorry hold on sister you messed me up then you were doing good going back you're lucky I mean that's you know like not going back it's bad that's right then they brought down a little for a cruise the ball gets a spoonful of oil enough to make okay yeah but God not this is what I wanted to get to a man occurs a spoonful of all enough to mix it but God was setting and angels on every bedpost watching to see how she was going to react if you're sure that it's God and you've met every requirement that God required you to do you've met every scripture that you know you love him you've been baptized you've been filled with the spirit and you've got the assurance in your heart that God will do it Jim just hang on God would bring through God would bring you through he would never fail hold on God would bring you through hey man how it look to a Christian okay that's it right there but I wanted to say that any time God is putting you through a test the Prophet was talking about how he I think he worked out but he was talking about this uh pipe Factory and and and in the pipe factory they make these pipes and they have to pressure test these pipes and so they take these pipes and me put caps on them and they fill them with so many pounds of pressure and if that pipe fell and he throw it to the trash she put it up on depression anytime you begin to go through something and God is putting you under pressure God is he he was here he was testing the shooting my woman he was watching to see how she react putting her in a situation to see what was she gonna trust God or not when God is dealing with you and putting you under that pressure he is getting ready to use you for something he is getting ready to give you a testimony and he's just cuz everything must be tried and proven he said bring me gold tried in the fire hey man that he may they use it's a revelation let's let's read that I think me see if I got it written down here and I don't think idea a man but he talked about their revelation gold trying to fight and he said by of UI sounds a man that he put on your eyes that your eyes may be open and see he was talking about their that they used school Greeks back in his day when your eyes let's go to go it to the heart system go to the heart 5801 12 evening paragraph 20 5801 12 the paragraph 20 a man we have to look beyond the veil a man that's when Christians get sore eyes now we going to get in who thinks it when they're asleep and the things of the world their eyes get sore you look at too much television maybe into how it take makes your eye sore and we use to make all this grease and and rub it massage it into the eyes and until their eyes come open oh but just in the spiritual realm God has some holy oil the Holy Spirit and it massages the heart with the power of his resurrection until the spiritual eyes can fly open and see the glory of the Lord oh how we need an a massaging that our eyes of our understanding might be open then another thing when our eyes come open you can see you might hear but your eyes come open you can see and then when the eye is oak and the eyes open up we can see the goodness of the Lord there's many times God has walked with you he kept you from that ray and man that's all right he kept you from that Rick he brought you from that hospital and you go on as if who was like that hog under the apple tree that's a southern expression you know that hog under the apple tree the apples were beat down on his head all day long and he will just grab them and eat them and never look up to see where they're coming from that's the way many Christians do all the blessings of the Lord falling all around them and they never get on their knees to recognize that it comes from God say what a pity amen so we see that that was angels are always with us a man says now watch close now God swore oh oh which hope that we have as an anchor of the soul both steadfast which entrance into it which which the Veil the veil God came down veiled in flesh to do what to show himself they meant he had to hide because he couldn't see him and he hid behind that veil and the veil was who Jesus not me that doeth the work but my father he said My father dwelleth in me I were the father that worketh and I work is here Oh - here he is here here he is a the veiled one walking in the flesh God Emmanuel God with us God was in Christ reconciling the word to himself here he is walking around now he came down and made a sanctification a provision appropriation that through his death offered pay the price of sin that he might come by and dwelling us again then the faith that he is a veiled see then the faith that we have is a veiled faith or a veiled person therefore we don't look at the things that we see in this Veil the veil this rail has education these things speak it's a scientific thing but the Spirit of the Living God dwells in here calls those things which are not as though they were if God said so there there is your veiling when it is now someday he raised his veil up not born of a woman by sexual desire a man a man we see Amen blow it out a blessing there we see that he came down in that veil let's turn to Roman's 6 chapter a man Romans 6 chapter Romans the seats chat amen and remember when we was biting Genesis and we said you read the scripture and that he's God made us in his image of the Spirit amen and then he failed us in flesh okay so it says here what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto and to death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed and henceforth we should not serve sin now I want to stop there and I want to go back and I want to say quickly remember that he gave he gave Adam Dominion and I made a point thank you brother I made a point to emphasize he gave him dominion over the earth he gave him dominion over his over his own faculties and over his body but we see here that knowing is that the old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that here for he shall not serve sin and he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death has no more dominion over him see when the fall we've lost that Dominion but the the reconciliation of Christ amen through the resurrection amen reconciled us back with them because the price was paid he came down and manifested himself in our human flesh amen so that he can pay the penalty of sin so that we might be able to enjoy the riches and fullness of life with him Dave man but he had to be veiled in the sinner and that human flesh that same failed a man that are free from sin now if we be dead in Christ believe that we also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the day it dies no more death has no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he lived he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness or to seeing but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from alive from dead and I'm sorry unto unto seeing don't get rich neither year your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto seeing but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but grace what then shall we sin because what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace he says god forbid know ye not that to whom ye yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thankful that he were servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that the doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin ye became servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members and servants unto righteousness unto holiness for when ye are the servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit haggi then what fruit had ye then in those things thereof hee wherefore ye are not ashamed amen so what fruit if you have in those things well ye are now ashamed from the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and both service to God he have your fruit on holiness and the N is everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord amen so we see Church that these members that that God gave was dominion over at one time this freshly veiled a man in the garden at the fall we lost a minion we lost control of it a man but see through the reconciliation of Christ he came down and veiled himself amen in this same flesh and paid the penalty of sin and give us an opportunity amen that we had Dominion once again over this earth through Christ Jesus amen but it's going to take a man our faith and it's going to take a revelation a man is going to take us a a constant renewing of our spirit amen to be able to overcome this flesh amen because if we don't feed on the things of God and stay in his presence let me take yourself in this fellatio this place should take you over amen because it's sinful it's sinful and until it drop off amen and we take on a new body we're gonna have to fight we're gonna have to fight until we leave here we're gonna have to fight until we leave here but the the the the the price have been paid the price has been paid he had he has no more no more sting of a man of the the he stuck his finger in in the wrong one and and and and it's over with a man so it's appointed on the man wants to die amen and that death has already taken place see but what he didn't realize that that one had that the the ability to raise himself up amen and and when he rose up heroes us up with him a man he paid the penalty so my whole point you know it's just let's let us let us crucify this flesh a man Crewson crucify this flesh and and just get out of the veil and be able to look beyond it there because he we have a representation of representation above a man to see everything that the very fact that you hear the very fact that God called you and if you have a mind to serve the law show that you have a representation from above a man that this is just a this is just your veil but you have a real representation on the other side a man that is waiting for you to just step right into it just waiting for you to step right into it it'll happen either by death or even or by by the rapture but this this this is corruption of put on this mortal put on immortality amen it will step into another body amen that don't have these same feelings and have these same hang-ups and things that we have to go through here on this earth amen so just continue to love one another a man with all your heart love the Lord with all your heart amen and this and and and to just look at one another see one another but look beyond the veil we have to in even in the situations that we go through we have to be able to look beyond the situation look beyond the situation it may look like it's one thing in front of us but see God is doing something in that situation we have to find we have to find a purpose of God in every thing we'd go through there's a purpose there you may have balls maybe giving you a hard time of something you may be going through that got you just upset stand back find the purpose of God in that thing because this death he's watching you it's just a test and anytime anytime he sees fit to put you through a situation to put you in a pressure cooker he's doing it because he has something for you to do but you must be tested reminded of the situation there with the Prophet how Cathy's young couple and they was acting all unseemly they're in the house of Lord trying to distract them and just it's being very rude and in the service and the angel of the Lord spoke to the prophet and said they're in your hands you can do what whatever you say whatever you speak it'll happen and he said I forgive you he passed it to him it was a test God was testing him to see if I can trust you with this power I can trust you with this it was a test even the Prophet had to go through the pray was in the pressure cooker the we're and the pressure cooker as well he's always there that's my that's the whole if I don't get nothing across that's the whole point that I wanted to get across that he's here he's here he's here he's always with you he's always watching you he's always caring for you he's always taking you through but we have to be able to get out of this and look beyond the situation that's in front of us get out of flesh have tomato communist if you've gone through something and or somebody upsets you what you take five minutes you say a five minutes first and any changes they pray for seven minutes for that person your heart to change just seven minutes he said God may show you something that that person is going through and you have compassion for and you have compassion for God maybe wanting to use you to help that person out of a situation see Saints we talking about adoption here we're talking about let's go on to perfection we all of us have a job to do as the body of Christ brothers answers your life your daily walk your daily life you it is you are a representation of you you are God all two feet God wants to be here again in this veil through us but we have to we have to get out of our carnal thinking that's why we have to keep our minds renewed daily on the way because he God has a way and and and and I'm a witness to this he has a way of the very thing you could be studying something you can we just go through the Bible or whatever you could be listening at a message and and you can something I message that very thing and the very thing that you just heard twenty minutes ago you can apply to something right now you can apply to a situation right now you're going through something maybe at work maybe in the grocery store or whatever that you just heard something and it's fresh in your spirit and boom here's the situation he's a situation we must constantly understand and fellowship over what with him email patter testimony that he won't would go we have to have a testimony that he walked with him daily we don't ever put it daily everything we do god help me not to just if we can just get that he'll be getting ready to coming up in
