comtable for everybody but let's just try to get through it amen and and let me tell you I know a place a lot harder than this amen and you don't want to go there amen so uh but let's just endure praise the Lord Let's uh let's let's let's let's read from the book of Hebrews amen and also the book of First Corinthians uh on today and um I do appreciate all the specials amen the the worship uh everything that's been done in the name of the Lord Jesus amen we're very very grateful uh for that uh Hebrews 11:8 amen is where I would like to read from and then also we'll take a passage from uh 1 Corinthians uh chapter 2 amen uh the Bible says by faith Abraham when he was uh called to go out into uh a place place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out uh not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country uh dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise uh for he looked for a city which hath found ations whose Builder and maker is God Amen uh let's turn over here to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and uh we'll catch it at verse 9 amen hallelujah um the Bible declares but as it is written I haveth not seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him uh but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God uh for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God uh now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray father we are grateful for the privilege and opportunity we have to gather in the house of the Lord we are grateful for the anointing that has been here through the song service and through the specials uh we uh appreciate Lord all that has happened and now as we prepare to enter into uh the word of God for today we trust that the spirit would take control over every thought not just the thoughts that are being presented but the thoughts that are also being received uh we pray father that um every spirit that is against your spirit would come underneath control of the Holy Spirit even right now and uh Lord we just ask that you look upon the saints that were not able to make it out today uh pray that you give them strength and we also uh heard the prayer requests early for brother Reagan uh family the Parker family they're preparing for a service today God we ask that you would just go before them in strengthen them and help them uh during this time and God we pray that you would carry them is our prayer in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen amen we uh certainly thank the Lord um just uh be here and I want to take a little thought uh this morning I I call it a little thought we'll see how far we can get in it but uh we want to uh preach on the city uh whose Builder and maker is God Amen the city whose Builder and maker is God and um I have been um you all are aware that I I typically teach on uh Wednesday mornings with a a group of brothers and we we teach through the Book of Revelation uh something that started and and uh so I've been just kind of I I think I jumped in starting at Revelation chapter 3 and and now I'm uh up into revelation 22 and just been I think I I've already accumulated about 184 lessons uh through the Book of Revelation and um and I just finished the whole series there in uh Revelation chapter uh 21 and so it's just kind of been in my heart just to share a little bit I think I probably took about 12 or 13 lessons from uh from that chapter and I wanted to start bringing some of it to the church and um you know so I'm kind of uh jumping in in in in in a place there I'm not really at the beginning and uh kind of almost at the end but I I think I'm going have to go back and bring yall some of the things from the beginning but uh nonetheless let's just just kind of let's kind of you know try to get on the scene uh I I'm going to start here with a quote out of future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride uh the first thing well let's let's just let's Coast let's go with this amen the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride says this uh notice that Jesus said in John 14 now says going to prepare a place says oh what will it look like did you even think now bride what it will look like so Jesus going says he's going to prepare a place but what will it look like he says he says it is uh prepared and designed by the Divine uh architect what will that City look like now I'm going to talk about it for a few minutes the Divine architect has prepared it designed it and look he designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride uh what's it going to look like could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able how he builds and puts everything every little thing justs exactly to her touch just what she' like amen now you know I I I like that because uh here here in um in in in in in West Palm Beach over in see this is called West Palm Beach where we live but on the other side a bridge amen it's called Palm Beach and uh and there is a there's a story you know there's a a u um a museum that's there now it's called the flagin museum but uh this Museum or this it actually was a house that was built for a man when he was getting married you know his wife uh he was going to give a gift to his wife and she said you know what I would like to have is a is a little Cottage By the Sea and uh his wife said I want a Cottage By the Sea so this man went and built a 25,000 sq ft home and called that his Cottage By the Sea as a gift for his wife Hallelujah now if that man could think to give his wife a Cottage By the Sea and make it 20 thou 25,000 Square fet what you think God thought about usall if you ever get a chance to walk through amen flag Museum and that's just the mind of a man doing that for his wife and thinking about every detail that he wanted give to his wife but but for us God has God has also thought about every detail that he wants to give us every little thing you like God going to have it there oh I don't I I I I I I tell you the truth I'm looking forward to every little thing you like God going to have it there amen for the prophet he had a horse he had a dog you like a dog you like a god going to have it there every little thing you like God will have it on the other side amen the quote goes on say now the Divine architect has designed a new city where he will with he where he will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the Apostle said Eye Has Not Seen ear has not heard or neither has it ever entered the heart of man he says let's see if we can probe into it just for a moment see what it's going to look like the divine architect has designed this for his beloved see oh what a place it must be when divine nature Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute that's attribute that's been divinely predestinated by a Divine God who is the Au of a Divine Life what will that City look like think of it he goes on a little further he says remember it's not heaven John John said I saw it coming down out of heaven is to be on earth see not this Earth that's going to pass away it's a redeemed Earth glory to God God didn't say he's going to raise up a new generation he's going to redeem the one that's here not going to raise up a new generation he redeemed the one that's already here he ain't going to make a new world it's this one right here he's just going to burn it off cleanse it like he did you Hallelujah and I like I like the way he said that you know the same way you through the stages of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost to Earth go through the same process now you know like I said I'm I'm kind of starting almost at the end I'm not here at the beginning but when I go back to the beginning we're going to bring out some of those things how the earth goes through the same process that you went through he says his plans must forever remain now you know as we kind of probe here this morning just to kind of look at this city whose Builder and maker is God uh you know I um I was just you know just thinking about the word you know just just City in itself and you know and um often times you know in life we have uh different cities that we put on our bucket list that we want to go visit come on somebody right you know in certain cities I mean we hear so much about it and then we get this you know this just desire like you know what I think I want to go there I want to go see that City I mean everybody else talking about it I'd like to go and see that there A lot of times people create bucket list and there's a number of things that they put on it one thing some people do is they want to learn another language that's on their bucket list amen I remember my wife going to school and amen at uh uh one of the the the like the the local local schools here they had a night class and she wanted to learn Creole and she went she took Creole classes amen and and so she wanted to learn another language amen right in school they forced us to learn a little Spanish and I got a few words but I don't know amen I I I don't know too many uh anymore but learning other language is on The Bu bucket list learning an instrument amen people have that on their bucket list uh in education people want to finish school or or go on and get a master's degree or a doc a doctor degree these are things that they have on the bucket list they want to achieve certain career goals or attain a certain salary and one of the big things people put on back bucket list is to travel they travel from City to City and I was just looking amen at Google and they they were just saying um uh the top 10 tour cities amen that they have now you know what I found is that the list changes depends on which website you click on because uh uh and I think it depend on who giving you the money to put they their City out there on that list because one one one uh one one website I looked at said Orlando was a destination city I said Orlando how did Orlando get on the get on the list but a lot of people come from all over the world to see Mickey Mouse but Paris is a destination city Dubai is a destination city Amsterdam is a destination city Madrid or ROM or London uh Munich Berlin Barcelona even New York these are cities that people want to go to hallelujah hallelujah amen now you know as I just kind of went through that list there was only one city here in the US and and even if you desired to go to New York uh that was this this top 10 uh uh cities if you desire to go to New York from here amen all you have to do is just get in your car and start driving 95 Hallelujah take 95 North you'll run right into New York if you wanted to fly you just get purchase an airplane ticket and you would go if you want to take a train you can do that Hallelujah glory to God but but these other cities that I called out because you live here in the US you just can't jump on a plane and go visit these other cities you can't jump on a plane and just go to Rome you just can't jump on a plane and go to London hello somebody you can't jump on a plane and go to burlin you got to have some other extra preparation come on somebody I'm I'm I'mma preach it anyhow amen but but here's the thing you don't just jump on the plane and go think you going to get through the airport to get into that City you going to need a passport come on somebody you going to need something extra to get you into that city right Oh Glory to God and and and what I was looking at here passport is an official document issued by the government hallelujah hallelujah this mean you can't make up your own passport hallelujah what I'm trying to say you can't make up your own way to get to heaven you going to need an official passport to get there you going to need the token praise God it's a token that's going to get you there but see the passport is given by the government amen and and and the definition say an official document issued by the government of a country to one of its citizens and varying from country to Country authorizing him or her to travel to foreign countries and authenticating their identity I like this amen it authenticates their citizenship amen it also gives them a right to protection while they are abroad and and it's also a right to reenter back into your country you going to need a passport in order to reenter back into heaven you come from God you got to go back to God I hope along the way you don't lose your [Music] passport cuz you going to need this to get into this city who's building make is God in some place is amen is not just a passport but you need a visa your passport ain't good enough but but the Visas and endorsement on the passport indicating that the holder is allowed to enter the holder is allowed to leave and the holder is allowed to stay for a specific period of time in the country yes sir Hallelujah when it's time for you to go you better get out the country come on glory to God Amen because the Visa allows you to stay for a specific time amen all right all right all right in order to go to heaven we're going to have to make sure our documents are in line you know we just can't go just because we think we can go amen but you going to have to have your documents in order if you if you leaving amen leaving the us trying to go to a foreign country your documents got to be in order and let let me tell you something you applying for a passport it you you don't get it in a one day's time it it it take a little while I I mean our precious sister uh and they and you have even when they doing the Visa it's a person checking they spot checking everything on the passport and anything that look funny come on somebody sister Shalom just went through it right anything look funny why on why am I looking at a young girl but on this passport come on somebody it says male but I'm looking at a little girl what y'all got going on in here and that that I meet over there they said we don't play those games here I don't care what y'all do in America but you ain't doing that here say she going to have to go on back home praise the Lord but every every details got to be exact when they're looking over that passport before they Grant the Visa everything has got to be in in alignment and it's the same thing with God everything has got to be an alignment you a you ain't going to heaven because your mama going to heaven you ain't going because your daddy going you ain't going because your pastor going do you have your passport your heavenly passport glory to God Amen even when you go to other country they just not let you go in because you with me they want to see your passports come on somebody that pass what is a token the baptism of the Holy Ghost glory to God look at this brother brandom makes a statement here in the message Jehovah Gyra we want to talk about this amen this this this this city it says here in the message Jehovah Gyra says and Abraham saw the cities of his day ER of Chala and he knew that because there was something in him calling there was a city that was different whose building and maker was God and God seeing that in Abraham told him separate yourself now come on out now I want to just uh pause here amen and just kind of talk about some of the requirements for making it to this city amen one of the requirements for you to get to this city is that you're going to have to separate yourself hello somebody amen you you going to have to come out of some things by yourself things that you've gotten yourself involved in you got to come out of it amen different people that you're hanging around you got to separate yourself from those people Abraham left everything behind yes sir in order to find the city whose building make it was God Abraham left everything behind you going to have to do the exact same thing Abraham did come on somebody you can't bring uh you can't bring the world with you not in this city you can't bring the things of the world with you as you're going on this journey you got to leave these things behind and at some point in time you got to cut off that friendship if you want to go to this city come on somebody he say he says told him separate yourself now come on out all right he says um now Abraham one thing I want you to notice he obeyed God's word to the letter that's what we going to have to do obey God's word to the letter always remember that that's my message you must obey the word anything contrary to it leave it alone it may look good but don't reason against God's word amen that's the first thing Satan did was reason against God's word to eat and she and she never doubted it she just reasoned Satan reasoned it and that's the way they do today isn't it reasonable that we should do this isn't it reasonable if it's against God's word leave it alone it's the the voice of Satan anything going against God's word you got to leave that thing alone and you have to make the choice that I'm going to separate myself from this I'm going to follow God's word that's what Abraham did that's exactly what we have to do as the children of Abraham this next uh sermon here and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy amen the prophet tells us uh but now but when you have separated yourself from the things of the world and I like that because often times our prayers is God would you please deliver me from this and God would you please take this away from me and God would you please do this and and God just sometimes looks sits back and he looks at you and says no what about amen you laying aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets you the reason that we pray that prayer we like to try to put it on God he just ain't delivered me yet no that ain't God's fault God want to see how much you love him are you willing to lay it down amen actually if he tells you in the scripture to lay aside every sin and way that means he has already put the Power inside of you Amen to give that thing up hallelujah what if I was to say you can answer your own prayer just by giving it up all right amen when you separated yourself from the things of the world crossed over that separating line and are sojourning in a Strange Land a land like you wasn't in uh in the beginning with the people that you never associated with in the beginning then you become a spiritual Jew look at that look at that it said uh the same way that Abraham by faith left his country left his people aen went into a Strange Land with strange people you have left your people left the World Behind left your Associates behind crossed over through the blood of blood of Jesus Christ and are sojourn us seeking for a city whose build and make his God like Abraham's pilgrims along with him dwelling in tents churches fellow citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven hes of all things through Jesus Christ see we have crossed over separated now that's got to be your testimony before amen you begin to make this journey uh to this city whose building makers God you going to have to separate from some things you going to have to give some things up just like Abraham did when he began to look for the city whose Builder and makeer was God now um I want to just read a scripture here revelation 22 verse 1-5 glory to God I'm going to kind of turn some Corners in in this sermon here today but by the grace of God I believe will get the gist of what is being said by the Holy Ghost uh revelation 22: 1-5 let's just look at this really quickly the Bible amen says and he showed me a pure River uh of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on other on on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner fruits and yielded a fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations now I want you to just kind of uh follow that the scripture says that uh the Tree of Life which bear 12 man of fruits and yielded her fruit every month uh F first it was on either side of the river now this tree is grown on both sides of the river now that's a very strange tree if it's got trunks on both sides of the river because it's bearing fruit on both sides of the river amen but it's got trunks on both sides of the river come on somebody amen so there there there there's a little bit more Happening Here than than what what what the eye can actually see glory to God I I can go ahead and tell you that amen by the time we get to this spot there is a full complete Union that has happened with the Lord Jesus Christ amen so one part of the tree amen is the male part and the other part of the tree is the female part it's the bride and Christ there dwelling together bearing fruit in this city amen wow amen amen glory to God if you go back and listen to the message the bride tree you'll see brother Brandon has brought that to us and we've been restored back to a certain place only the bride can claim this amen all right let me just keep reading I I'll get into this more as we as we uh go through the weeks says and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads now I'm going tell you you're not we're not waiting till we get there before our names are in his for in in before his name is in our foreheads right now his name is in our foreheads now that's not some tattoo in the head not like the 666 that people looking for in the hand and in the head that's not what the scripture is talking about amen when it talk about 666 on the hand it's what they work for they work for the denomination amen when it talk about the 666 in the head that's all they think about is what the denomination want but when they talk about his name being in our foreheads we only think about what the word wants for us right now that's the way we think amen glory to God Amen look at this it goes on to say this amen and there shall be no night there and they shall need no candle neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever now I'm going to just drop a little question off here amen that I think is important the next scripture I want to read is John 8:12 but um my my my scripture I mean my my question is uh if Jesus identifies himself as the light of the world amen we're going to prove this in uh the beginning of scripture in the middle of scripture and what we're just reading here in uh in Revelation the end of scripture Jesus himself is the light of the world he is the light of this new city he is the light the lamb is the light thereof that's what the Bible tells us the lamb is the light thereof my question is amen uh if you reject Hallelujah if one rejects the light of their day how can they expect to live in the city where the lamb is the light can I ask the question again if one rejects the light for their day how can they expect to live in the city where the lamb is the light right I can just tell you right now you won't live there no sir here's another requirement you got to receive the light of your day if you want to live in the city where the lamb is the light that's right amen put away some things and then accept the light for your day I'm giving you some good clear instructions on how to get to this city amen whose building make is God all right here John uh 18 I mean John 8:12 says this then Jesus then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so Jesus himself is the light of the world now now let's just kind of go back and and follow I said we'll find him amen as the light in the beginning we'll find him as light in the middle of the scripture we'll find him as light over here in Book of Revelation 22 amen he's the Lamb of he's the light of the city the lamb is the light thereof now Genesis 1 let's go there Genesis 1 verse 1-4 and we'll see Christ as the light amen he is the light of the world and who whoever follow him shall not walk in darkness but have the the light of Life Genesis 1 says this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and look at this and God said let there be light and there was light and look at this verse four says and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness now the unfortunate part here is that most people don't realize when God said let there be light that was not s you in light right because the s u in light did not come until the fourth day amen the Bible says that God made two great lights one to rule the day and one to rule the night one was amen the sun and the other was the moon hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so so this light here in Genesis 1:3 was not s n light but this light in Genesis 13 is s o in light Glory Glory hallelujah amen this is the pillar of fire that came out of God Amen the logos that came out of God the same thing that led the children of Israel through the night amen as they were going through their 40-year Journey this is what came out at that point in time this is the same light that took a picture over the prophet's head come on somebody this is the same light that Paul ran into on the road to Damascus amen and when Paul ran into the light on the road to Damascus text who art thou Lord talking to the light come on somebody and the light spoke back to Paul the light is still speaking today the light told Paul I am Jesus so this was the Lord Jesus coming out in a form that we can actually identify him yes sir amen truly he is the light of the world he was the very first thing that came out of God and when we get to Genesis 21 and 22 we see he's the last thing sitting down on top of the city the lamb amen is the light thereof of the city so the first thing come out is the last thing that comes down onto the city hallelujah oh I like this truly he is the light of the world at the beginning we see him as the light in the middle of the Bible we see him as the light he's found in Psalm 23 amen he's in Psalm 23 can we read Psalm 23 glory to God Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul glory to God he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and somebody might say brother Jack where you see him as the light in Psalm 23 let me just read a quote for you amen this is coming out of the message law Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah how I thank the Lord for this amen this city where the lamb is the light says we would like to think in the terms tonight of this wonderful letter of the Apostle Paul as we believe is not determined yet by SC Jess who wrote the book of Hebrews but believing that it was St Paul how he was trying to show and he was more or less using he was being a typologist here he was trying to show that show what the law was a shadow of good things to come and not the very image or the very things itself it was just a shadow and many times I've heard people quoting the 23rd psalm and saying they yay though I Walk Through The Dark Shadows of the Valley of Death if you'll notice it isn't the dark shadow amen it's the shadow right it says dark isn't in it the shadow of the valley of death now it cannot be dark and yet have a shadow it cannot be dark and yet have a shadow glory to God for there has to be a certain percent of light yes sir before it can be a shadow if it was perfectly dark there would be no Shadow so yay though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death now there has to be enough light to make a Shadow if it was dark in here my shadow would not be on the pull pit but being that there is light then it makes a shadow rightall come on somebody so death is dark in a certain way but it's only a shadow amen the Valley of the Shadow death so there has to be a certain amount of light in death oh I like that statement there has to be a certain amount of light and death to make a Shadow aren't you happy that that's so that there's a light in the valley brother sister I I don't know no other light that can meet me in the valley and cause a shadow to death he is that light praise God I'm so glad even in life we have a light and even in death we have a light amen he's the one that creates the light he's the one that creates the shadow for death because of him being the light in the valley that's why a lot of Believers when they going across the other side it's I mean you hear testimonies they shaking hands with people before they get there and greeting people like man I mean it's it's like they look forward to crossing over our precious brother Billy Paul and and I I shared with the church on Wednesday night if you weren't here amen I would tell you go back and listen to the tape on Wednesday night amen I I share some information that might be helpful for you because like like brother Solomon said his his his his father-in-law just like oh my brother Billy Paul gone yes he is and the other thing I can tell you is that what people have been waiting on has already been fulfilled sir I ain't going to share it today go back and listen to the tape that's right hallelujah amen I I just I just pray that people get they get their s together I mean it's it's going home time it's all I can tell you I mean it's going home time I I I it's going it's going to happen a lot faster than what we think and and people waiting for Los Angeles to go under that might happen when the bride is going up that's right come on somebody all right but but don't don't wait for that don't wait for I mean give your heart give your heart to the Lord now what if you have to cross over into the shadow of death you want to make sure that there's a light there to meet you right brother amen all right amen amen all right Revelation um 21 1: 22-2 this is at the end of the scripture and this is how we know that he is the light from the beginning to the middle to the end Jesus Christ himself is the light amen uh verse uh verse 21 in Revelation uh 21 says and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it amen and the city had no need of the Sun s u n had no need of sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in in in in the light of it and the Kings amen uh of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it my question again if one rejects the light for their day how can they expect to live in a city where the lamb is a light amen all right let's go on to look at a few more quotes here amen this is coming out of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom in the Earthly bride uh brother Brandon makes a statement here and and and here's the the beautiful part about this oh let's just read it let's just read it it says Jesus gone to repair with Divine hands a Divine City Divine architect for divine bought and PE people for a predestinated people he's going to prepare Abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose building makeer was God that Prophet knowing it was somewhere now when Abraham took off looking for this city amen whatever um God allowed him to see caus this man to just leave everything behind I mean he was this man was 75 years old he was all settled and he was living in a great City but he's like no that the city that I just seen I got to go and find this place can you imagine him telling his wife that we leave when we're going to look for this city whose building maker is God his wife said now what's the name of the city I don't know the name but I know it's there and we got to go we got we got to leave here but we got to go walking he'll lead us he'll tell us where to go we got to leave yes sir he walked by faith and it's the same way we're going to have to walk by faith once you get a good glimpse of what this city is all about hey I'm going tell you something there is no City in the earth that is like this city I don't care what the top 10 destination cities are for tourist there is no City in the earth that will ever compare to this city whose building make us God I'm going to try to give you some dimensions in a little bit but there's no City ever will compare to it you tell me one city that got streets of gold tell me one that's got it that you can walk down streets go y your house is made in Gold Hallelujah transparent glass come on somebody say the prophet say parks and and all kind of things up along the h a mountain a mountain side you you living along a mountain like this come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah we got some great things to look forward to amen look at this now look at what it says here Abraham went looking for it says Abraham was looking for it and professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city who building makeer was God that Prophet knowing it was somewhere John saw it coming down but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then that he was convinced it was here right then it says why he met MDC and who is MDC the king of this city the king of Salem the king of Jerusalem New Jerusalem Abraham met MC after the battle right serving him communion praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Abraham gave his tithe to MDC amen Abraham said if I met the king the city got to be here somewhere look at this look at this look at this look at this he met MDC the king of it and give him a tithe which had no father or no mother he had no beginning of life nor ending of Life Abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up oh I like that like I like let me it says where the city will be raised up the holy Mount of the Lord where the redeemed the live om my that time just don't stop nowhere in time after a while we're go to Eternity now what brother random says that Abraham met MDC in the very same spot where the New Jerusalem will be and you want to know where that is where they're having a war right now look they fighting over land but I by Revelation cuz we're looking into spiritual things oh y'all are you with me they fighting over land that's not even theirs both sides that land belong to the bride oh Hallelujah there's going to be a New Jerusalem place right there amen the Jew the the the Jewish uh Jewish Nation can have it for right now but you know what it's going to be cleansed it's going to be purged you know also in the Bible I don't have time to go through all these things but it's there in the book of uh uh it's it's it's in the Book of Revelation it talks about um the two witnesses I think going to be they're going to die in the streets of Sodom it uses the term of Sodom right they're going to die in the streets of Sodom where our Lord was crucified now we know where our Lord was crucified right he was crucified in Jerusalem come on somebody but but when the when the Bible in the Book of Revelation says they're going to die in the streets of Sodom one brother asked me and said what you think that mean I said well I'm just looking at through spiritual eyes if it say they're going to die in the streets of Sodom that means homosexuality going to be on a rampage in Jerusalem and this is why it's going to have to be cleansed it's going to have to be purged it's going to have to go through a justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost process yes sir because there going to be a New Jerusalem for us what when we talk about a new jerus we talk about a whole new atmosphere oh I'm talking about you'll never be tempted no more it won't be no devil to tempt you oh you'll never fall again there's nothing to fall to Hallelujah somebody amen I mean all that negative stuff that you done experence that you ain't got to worry about that no more bills to pay I'm talking about your your your lord and savior I built you a house brother Brandon went to his house on the other side when his daughter say we'll be I'll be waiting on Billy say Mama's up at the house she say Brams ain't never had no house where you got one here oh that ought to make you want a shout every detail God know that you desire a house if you never get one on this side you got one waiting for you up there oh Hallelujah everything you like going to be there everything than Abraham met him met him on the and took communion in the literal spot where the city will be raised up he goes on to say this he says Oh Holy Mountain there will be streets of transparent gold ain't no City like this city Avenues and houses and Parks if you want to read it Revelation 21:18 the tree of life would be there 12 different manner of fruits that's revelation 22 one each month will be bore on it the people that eat these fruits they'll change their diet every month and it's and it and look at this now remember my question if one rejects the light of their day how can they expect to live in a city where the lamb is light here's the answer to the question amen he says they'll change their diet every month as for only the Overcomers yes sir do you did uh he says do you know that that it isn't for denominations if you reject a light for your day you cannot expect to live in a city where the land is the light you have to separate some from some things you got to separate from your denomination you got to separate from your denominational thinking you got to separate from the things of the world if you want to go to that City whose building maker is God this is only for the Overcomers do you know that it is it isn't for other denominations you say you mean that brother Brandon and look at he going to take you right to the scripture let's turn to Revelation two just a minute amen y'all y'all can do you can turn to it there we we'll we we'll pick up the rest of the quote but turn to Revelation 2:7 you'll see exactly where he said where he got this from this is not for everybody everybody ain't going to make it to the city glory to God not if they not willing to separate from some things of the world and they're not willing to accept the the revealed word for their day you can't make it to the city the city is only for the O Overcomers and the Bible declares that Revelation 2:7 is where he's referring to he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat so the Overcomer is giv amen this reward to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God only the Overcomer will eat in this [Music] city all right let's go back to the quote amen we like to put things right there in the word right all right let's finish reading what he says for only the Overcomers do you know that it isn't for the nomin ations he said you mean that brother random let's turn to Revelations 2 just a minute and find Revelation 2:7 says let's find out whether it's really uh the truth or not Revelation 2:7 reads like this and he that hath an ear uh let him hear what the spirit now remember he's not talking to the Jews now this is the church the Gentiles my he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches to him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God it goes on uh uh in this in this in this quote it says Overcomers only that overcome the Beast overcome his mark That's Catholicism not just that protestantism denominationalism who overcame the beasts his Mark the letter of his name he have a right to the Tree of Life to enter into the gates where nothing that defiles can ever go in amen see think of of it now just a minute now as we as we go just a little bit further tree of life will be for the Overcomers only the leaves would be for the healing of the Nations that is the kings that live in there bringing their honor when they bring their honor in and Lay It Before the Throne of God just like the outside the 11 tribes brought in every one of them attempt to Levi when they bring their honor into in in into from the Blessed land and that they'll reach from the Tree of Life break off a Hol Leaf a tree of life tree of leaf a tree of life leaf and they'll walk out together there's no more war everything's at peace the leaves are memorial for the healing of the nation and you know here's the thing um this war that that that just kind of broke out I heard a little report it was saying that Israel was in the middle of signing a peace treaty with another nation and uh and as they were just coming to the signature part here these bombs start dropping on them and uh and and and it just reminded me of the scripture when they cry peace peace sudden destruction let me tell you there will there will be no peace until Jesus comes they going to keep fighting over this land but the land is actually preserved for the predestinated the Overcomers will be there in that land hallelujah hallelujah it's a good land I'm telling you it's flowing with milk and honey glory to God let me uh let me just go on a little further here go to questions and answers I want to read something just try to give you a description of the city my God Parks Avenues streets of gold uh I don't know about you but like here in in in in in in Florida I like it when it become mango season but we only get it once maybe sometimes twice a year but most time once a year summertime is when that when it when it when we get those get the mangoes but when we get to this city I don't know what fruit you like but every month you getting something every

all over the world but don't forget there's a city whose's building makers God it's a greater city than any City you ever visited on this Earth amen make sure you got your passport now am here in this message questions and answers on on on Hebrews Prophet makes a statement here and it says when the thousand years are expired on this earth oh my when a thousand years are expired on this Earth then the Devil comes up and the second Resurrection comes the resurrection of the unjust The Gather a great Army like the Sands of the sea and they come up to Compass the camp of the Saints and when it does god reigns fire and brimstone out of the heavens and destroys them and John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and and when when we get that past the way it it's it just means the the atmosphere changes not completely annihilated but the atmosphere changes amen no more sin because the one that's that that that's actually uh causing you to do the things you do that that influence is no longer there been been thrown into a lake of fire Hallelujah glory to God but amen the whole atmosphere changes watch this now it says uh uh and it come come up to Compass the camp of the Saints and when it does god reigns fire and brimstone out of heavens and destroys them joh and John said I saw new Heaven and new earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth was passed away and there was no more sea my God now in order for to not be any more sea this has got to be a massive City no more sea no more oceans all that's gone right watch this now he says and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride ad D for a husband there you are watch this it says the lamb and the bride will be there forever there'll be a new Earth watch this one millions and millions of square miles no City like this millions and millions of square miles oh my the city the Bible measures out the city of 15,000 square miles it says it's 15,000 miles long 15,000 I mean I think he means 1500 1500 but when you start calculating all that if you uh uh in in uh and and building and things like you start calculating that it it comes out to Millions even billions when you start calculating but it's 1500 square miles it says 1,500 15,000 mi W 15,000 mil and again it's 1500 it says that's exactly the description the Bible gives of the city no wonder there's no more seed there was no place for it oh there'll be such a beauty and in there there's a fountain right at the Throne of God that flows Before the Throne there's a tree on either side of the River of Life and this tree dwells uh in this tree dwells 12 man of fruit and yields its fruit every month now I want to just uh pause just for a second let's go back and just pick up in scripture really really quick we'll go back to Revelation uh 20 uh one and just kind of pick up a few scriptures here then I just want to uh just show you something praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's pick up verse one Amen in Revelation 21 says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband now there's there's there's something in there that I can't get into today but I'm going to come back and talk about that amen and there's a place where brother brandom said comes down like a comet comes down like a comment but I can't touch it today amen he says and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying about behold the Tabernacle of God is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them

to make it to this city amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things glory glory and I will be his God and he shall be my son but look at this but the fearful and unbelieving so you can't reject the word or reject the light for your day and then expect to live in a city where the lamb is the light but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable that you know and let me just put it this way there are certain sins that people commit that are a an abomination in God's eyes so you can't you can't continue to live that type of lifestyle and then expect to go to the city where the lamb is the light you have to walk away from certain things in this life amen cuz that that it will not be on the other side hallelujah amen amen it's it's what we call a perverted love and God God is pure love not perverted love amen a man can't love a man like that and a woman can't love a woman like that hello somebody amen amen you married talk about you love somebody else you a lie that's right that's a perverted love hello somebody we got to get rid of these things here if we want to go to the city whose building maker is God that's right all right but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers my God and mongers y'all don't know what that is that's a man going from one woman to the next woman to the next woman to the next woman he's a monger and that type of man that's not going to be going to heaven true amen look in heaven we ain't going to have to watch our Wives come on somebody you got to get rid of that Spirit right now hello somebody I'm just reading the Bible wh mongers and S Sorcerers practicing witchcraft hello somebody amen and now let me tell you another thing about witchcraft um Saul was just disobedient to the word of God and his Disobedience amen was compared to Witchcraft that's why I started off by saying we got to obey just like Abraham obey your disobedience is actually compared to Witchcraft yes sir amen amen hello let me keep reading amen if you want to know who going to make it and who ain't going to make it the Bible's pretty clear all right says uh uh Sorcerers and idolators and all liars there's another one hello you just finished lying talk about you going to the city whose building maker is God you better make them things right amen amen get rid of that lying spirit amen hallelujah amen and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now let me just um think I want to catch something else here at the end let's go to verse uh 16 and um it says in the city liar four square and the length is as large as the breath and he measured the city with the re 12,000 furlongs that's 1500 uh feet 12,000 fongs the length and the bread and the height of it are equal um and I think I got that 1500 I didn't I didn't bring my note on that uh but but here uh it goes on it says um and he measured the wall thereof in 140 and 4 cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the Angel and the building of the wall of it was it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like unto glass the city was pure gold like unto glass no City like this city and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the First Foundation was Jasper thei Sapphire the thir chaldon the fourth and emerald the fifth sardonic the sixth sardius the seventh crystalite the eighth barrel uh the ninth a topaz the 10th uh uh Crystal prus 11th Jason 12th amethyst and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was was uh of one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass goes on and the city had no need of the sun nor the moon to shine and for the glory of of of God did lighten it light it lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut all by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory bring the glory and honor honor of the nation into it and they shall in no wise enter in and their shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life only the predestinate only the Overcomers no Liars nobody uh a living an abominable lifestyle and sisters the way that we dress even brothers too the way we dress can be an abomination in God's eyes so if you want to if you want that lifestyle you don't want to go to this city who's building maker is God amen amen I wanted to just inject something here brother Brandon has has explained that this is 1500 miles and he says he says it would be millions and millions of square miles millions and millions of square miles um I want to go to my my slide there um and I want to just explain something here now um this slide just kind of talks about the five layers of the Earth's atmosphere now that's just and I just you know five is a number of Grace but you know the the the earth is made up of these five layers here I mean the atmosphere and like I said the atmosphere is going to explode it's going to blow up all of this right here what you see brother Bram say they going to shoot a missile through that and blow it all up right I don't have time to read all that today but what we have here is the troposphere that's the first level down here at the bottom the troposphere now uh and and what we have here and just just so you understand that troposphere usually it says 0 to 12 to 18 kilm I got to convert it to miles that's about 0 to 7 miles high is a troposphere now notice here on this little picture what what flies in the troposphere is hot air balloons they get that high and even airplanes passenger airplanes can get into the troposphere you can't even see an airplane fly you can see it get off the ground but when it get above the clouds you can't even see it up there and it's only roughly 7 Miles High the stratosphere is this next area and you know let me just let me just um read a couple things before I go further the troposphere is the lowest portion of the atmosphere and it is where the vast majority of weather is found is found in the troposphere right the other thing they say um the the top of the troposphere is called the tropopause which is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere jet streams are Ty typically found in the tropopause the tropopause is generally an isothermal Zone where temperatures remain constant with altitude now the next one is the stratosphere you go from the troposphere to the stratosphere now that's anywhere from seven miles to 31 m miles high right and um this is also called the ozone layer this is where ultraviolet light from the sun is absorbed by ozone particles and convert it to heat they say commercial aircraft generally fly in the lower levels of the stratosphere so commercial aircraft can get here troposphere and then lower levels of the stratosphere that's as high as a plane can go I'm going a little further after the stratosphere we get the mesosphere all right the mesosphere and now this is anywhere from 31 to 50 miles high and meso means middle the metos spere mesosphere is responsible for protecting the Earth against asteroids and space debris and is where the objects tend to burn up it's in the mesosphere they say neither military nor commercial aircraft can fly in the mesosphere due to the lack of air mass so military aircraft can't even get up into this area the mesosphere and that mesosphere again 31 to 50 miles above the Earth's surface it keep going look at this it goes into the thermosphere now it was the thermosphere is roughly anywhere from 50 miles to 440 Miles High remember I told y'all brother bradam said this in the scripture he said this city is going to be 1500 miles high 1,500 miles wide you youve never seen a city like this city watch this the thermosphere is where uh uh the they say the Carmen line can be found which defines where outer space starts which is uh roughly 62 miles above sea level some satellites including the International Space Station orbit the earth in the thermosphere but it goes higher the exosphere right and here the exosphere the highest point in the exosphere is 6200 miles anywhere from 440 mil to 6200 miles the exosphere is the highest uh most outer layer of the atmosphere where the air is extremely thin it is the transition between the Earth's atmosphere and the vacuum of space brother said God feels all all space so out beyond the exosphere the highest that they can get they got they got the the the the the space shuttle of spaceship going up and even the satellite up there in the exosphere that's as high as they can go but this city that we're going to is actually twice the size of what you're looking at there man has never I has not seen Ear Has Not Heard nor has it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those that love him for the Overcomers you can't even see sometimes sometimes they say the the the the space shuttle comes in View and I and you'll see it out there or the space station they say you see all you see is just a light out there just something just just you don't you have it's it's massive when you get there but it's just a little light but this what we getting ready to go to and now now I want you to understand 00 Miles High 1500 miles wide brother Brandon say that the the the width is like from here Florida all the way to Maine all the way out to Indiana somewhere even past Indiana he said this city is so huge that you going to see it from everywhere on the Earth but when we get there church no Liars no abominal you got you struggling with the way you dressed now don't worry don't worry you ain't going there to struggle you got to overcome something now and and God and when we talk about overcome we not talking about God picking you up and P and pulling you through something and pushing you through it and at the other end saying blessed is he that overcomes it's going to be some stuff you got to give up now if you want to make it to this city whose building maker is God when I when I start looking at this little chart I say wow I mean as far as I can see with my eyes pretty much here in the troposphere that's as far that's as high as I can go but God 1500 miles higher than anything I can see on this Earth church I'm going to tell you this is a massive City there's never been a City established like this one and you talk about a bucket list amen get your passport ready get get your passport if you need a visa get your visa right and and look when you when you filing for a passport you got to get your papers turned in quick cuz sometimes it in used to take about 6 weeks to get it back but since Co yeah yeah it take a little longer to get things back you better make sure your house is in order let me finish reading the quote here out of out of questions and answers oh hallelujah hallelujah the prophet tolds us it it's going to be millions and millions of square miles this city that we're getting ready to go to and it says this there's 24 Elders there's the bride there's the the uh 44,000 Temple unit he means 144,000 oh brother we're going somewhere things lay ahead for us the 20 and4 Elders the 144,000 Unix the bride sitting with Christ the bride sitting with Christ my home sweet home Amen to think that I have a privilege of going there and and you have a privilege of going there look at this Why Oh My My My My why would you choose to walk in this darkness and see no light and die and go into chaos and become nothing for when light takes its supreme authority I told you he was the light at the beginning in Genesis he was the light in the middle in Psalms he's the light in the end in in in Revelations but when light take its supreme authority there's no place for Darkness am go find where the darkness went when light comes that's when it's when all things are turned back to God Darkness had a beginning Darkness has an end light never had a beginning uhh or it never has an end God never had a beginning or never has an end so someday the whole debauch world with all of its sin and its beauty so-called and all of Fanatics and Sensations and all of his Glamour and everything will fade out into nothing and it'll be no more I want to tell you uh Paul says this in the book of Hebrews here we have no continuous City and I don't care you know once you once you uh take off one of these cities on your bucket list I've been to London I've been to Rome I've been here once you knock a city off your but bucket list all you keep doing is looking to put another one on the bucket list once you accomplish something you look to try to accomplish something more right but here you know uh we we have no consy nothing here lasts forever nothing but I tell you what when we get there this is an eternal City this is an eternal City this one you want on your bucket list now now when you go to Google they won't put this one at the top of the list you got to put it there the city whose's building Mi is God all of his Glamour and everything will fade out into nothing it'll be no more it'll be no more no more thought of it said even it won't even come into the remembrance anymore there'll be nothing to ever compare to this great City I I I I I I all I could do is just try to present it to you there's something awaiting us something much greater than you can ever even imagine Church don't get so uh bogged down with the things of this Earth don't get bogged down with the things of this Earth it means nothing brother brandom talked about how he would you know he would go to a certain go maybe visit somewhere and uh go on a trip somewhere and then he'd go back and go back to home and home has changed the the the maybe a place where there was a school now they got a shopping mall or maybe they used to have this and now they got that I remember you know where where we meeting at right now where I grew up at man this you this used to be the boonies we never thought we'd be out here we thought that's that's oh that's way out there now it's just a skip and a hop and they just keep going further and further west next thing know we'll be in the cane Fields right but but but it it shows that nothing lasts forever everything will keep changing but no matter what man does on this side it does not compare to what God has in already already prepared for us you must be ready to go you got to separate from some things yes yes if you want to make it to this city you got to give up some stuff hallelujah hallelujah this is only for the Overcomers and and I tell you what I I I was listening the brother Capers there this morning and and I was just thinking to myself when we get to the other side and I hear that voice singing bu land yeah brother Capers you made it Hallelujah brother Capers made that and and and and and as he was just singing this morning I like it tied right into my sermon because that's that's where we're headed and and we long for it there's nothing on this Earth that that should keep us here oh don't get wrapped up and tied up everything here going to be just destroyed it's going to be a new Heaven A New Earth oh my my my my my Hallelujah God bless you Church the city whose Builder and maker is God Amen let's have a word of Prayer father we are uh grateful we have the privilege Lord Jesus Lord to be able to see uh into what you have in store for us what a glimpse Lord God that we can we can get like Abraham got a glimpse in he was so convinced after he saw it so this City's got to be here is greater than than where I'm living at right now I'm willing to forsake everybody I'm willing to leave my family behind I got to go I got to got to go find this city and there after a great battle him recovering uh lot on his way back that's when he met the king of the city that he was looking for MDC Lord he he met him Lord Jesus and uh and and it just Lord it uh it's a blessing because the prophet tells us the exact same spot that he met MDC is the exact same spot where this city will raise up from Lord we're looking we're looking forward to it this this world is not our home and there's nothing father here that can hold us nothing can keep us father I just pray Lord Jesus that you would help us father to to set our affections on the things above not on the things of this Earth Lord this this means nothing this all this is going to pass away but let us set our affections on the things above we can't can't wait to get out of here Lord joining father with the other saints that have already gone home and father maybe it's things that will never get here on this Earth but you know the desires of our heart and father you have already promised that we'll have it on the other side everything we love Lord that's what you told a prophet everything he he loved and everything ever loved him you had given to him on the other side and believe with him sharing that father as our Prophet Lord his job was to get a bride ready Lord You've also given us the same promise that everything we love and everything that ever loved us will see on the other side help us Lord Jesus to prepare our hearts get our p ports ready our spiritual passports our visas whatever is necessary let us get it prepared so we can enter this city the city whose Builder and maker is God it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the Lord glory to God amen amen God bless you I'll turn the service back over to uh brother Solomon uh um and also I I do need to meet with
