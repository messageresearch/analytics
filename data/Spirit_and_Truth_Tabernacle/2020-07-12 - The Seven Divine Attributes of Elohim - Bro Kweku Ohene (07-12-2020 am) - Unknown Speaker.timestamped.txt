[9:48] open my mouth so I'm gonna the
[9:55] atmosphere
[10:00] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[10:07] no I was listening to the radio as I was
[10:11] riding I believe it was on Thursday and
[10:15] there was a minister speaking and he
[10:17] took two scriptures and he put them
[10:19] together said if you confess me before
[10:23] the people something to that nature it
[10:26] slips on my mind right now I'll confess
[10:29] you before my father which is in heaven
[10:32] and then over in Luke it says I'll
[10:34] confess you before the angels of God he
[10:38] said so Jesus Christ is the word so
[10:41] whenever you put the word on your mouth
[10:43] and you begin to confess it before men
[10:46] then God employs his angels to bring it
[10:49] to pass so he puts the angels to work
[10:53] when Jesus goes and confess you before
[10:57] the Father and before the Angels and I
[10:59] thought that was something because if
[11:02] God gives you a command like our pastor
[11:04] gave us the word back last year over
[11:08] your mouth and I will feel that that was
[11:10] a word of God to us so when you begin to
[11:12] obey that word you start speaking that
[11:14] word now God employs the Angels to go
[11:17] forth and then the Angels begin to move
[11:20] brother Caleb gave a awesome testimony
[11:21] about when we felt the presence of a law
[11:25] coming to a little business meeting that
[11:27] we were having and he said I will not
[11:30] lack and then God employed the angels
[11:33] because he confessed him before men
[11:36] while he was confessing before one of
[11:39] them was a sinner one was a nominal
[11:40] Christian and then there was a believer
[11:43] there so he confessed this before men
[11:46] and then the angel of the Lord was
[11:48] employed to put a thousand dollars at
[11:49] his feet so you put the Word of God upon
[11:53] your mouth don't be ashamed of him
[11:55] before me and confess the word Amen if
[11:58] God has given you a promise by His
[12:00] stripes I'm healing you are sick you
[12:03] confess that before the doctors God went
[12:05] for the angels to bring it to pass he's
[12:08] a lord man he's worthy to be praised

[31:02] this season I have been getting texts
[31:06] from everywhere just different people
[31:08] that have been feeling symptoms and and
[31:11] and and things that nature last night I
[31:13] heard from from brother Jeff a member of
[31:16] the Jeff banks and he said that his
[31:18] chest just began to tighten up on him
[31:20] and he wanted to go back to the hospital
[31:22] and you know just just have them check
[31:25] things out and and as he you know he
[31:27] went there to the hospital you know he
[31:32] said that the the doctors did say that
[31:34] he actually had the virus and I told him
[31:36] brother we just gone we gonna believe
[31:38] God alright because I know that soon as
[31:41] you go with a symptom they gonna give it
[31:43] to you 90 you're gonna get it because
[31:46] they gonna give it to you but you you
[31:48] can refuse it a man that the box of
[31:50] rattlesnakes that the devil try to send
[31:52] you away you say send it back I'm not
[31:54] taking it and so he act we prayed with
[31:57] him and we know that at the initial
[32:00] phase of this for the Jeff was filling
[32:03] something in his body and and and he
[32:06] went in and and they they said that they
[32:08] didn't they didn't see anything but he
[32:10] said well I just got free rent for about
[32:12] two weeks a man at the hospital I said
[32:15] that's the way to look at you gotta have
[32:17] the right right mental attitude when
[32:18] you're going through things right and
[32:20] you know so he was just I said God
[32:23] brought you through before I know he'll
[32:24] do it again and and so he just solicit
[32:27] our prayer is also sister Cheryl and she
[32:31] said I'm T Abigail they weren't feeling
[32:33] their best but they asked for our
[32:34] prayers and and also sister kid kash
[32:38] Neda she asks for our prayers who she
[32:40] hasn't been feeling her best so every
[32:42] symptom that
[32:43] we are refuted the name of the Lord
[32:47] Jesus Christ when rebuking it in Jesus
[32:50] name
[32:50] so let's remember these Saints of Prayer
[32:52] got another purpose from South Carolina

[32:58] of theirs they said if she doesn't have
[33:01] a move of God she won't make it through

[36:40] [Music]
[37:00] I was in prayer this morning the
[37:02] scripture just kind of came to him and I
[37:04] wanted to read it to us
[37:09] Isaiah
[37:12] fifty-four Isaiah 54 just a quick
[37:17] scripture I want to be
[37:18] [Music]
[37:23] starting at verse one here says Stingo
[37:29] baron
[37:31] now that's dis not here break forth into
[37:36] singing and cry aloud now that did not
[37:39] now that dis not travail with child for
[37:42] more are the children the desolate than
[37:45] the children of the merit wives they had
[37:47] the Lord
[37:49] and the way brother branham brings this
[37:51] to our attention
[37:52] it's you're gonna have more in
[37:53] denominational churches that you're
[37:55] gonna have in the bride's all right but
[37:59] it says the verse says enlarge the place
[38:01] that I tent and let them stretch forth
[38:04] the curtains of thine habitation spare
[38:08] not lengthen my course and strengthen
[38:10] thy States for thou shalt break forth on
[38:14] the right hand and on the left and my
[38:19] seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make
[38:25] desolate cities to be inhabited
[38:27] praise God this scripture was given to
[38:32] me and it just kind of came back to my
[38:35] spirit and
[38:36] it was a scripture that I believe was
[38:38] for even us expanded into a new church
[38:42] into school I wrote this down somebody
[38:45] gave me a stink and told me to write the
[38:47] scripture down and put on the stink and
[38:49] just kind of declare some things and I
[38:53] wrote it down in 2017 I declared I
[38:57] declare that we were having to church
[39:00] into school and I declare that we would
[39:02] have a resources amen in order to
[39:05] accomplish this and you know and as I
[39:08] looked at how I wrote things down God
[39:10] has done like the first three things
[39:12] that I wrote down God has already done
[39:14] and the part where he said resources I
[39:16] just begin to think about the building
[39:18] fund account I said God you have blessed
[39:19] us with resources so we can make
[39:22] something happen so the next step for
[39:25] this is that that's the new church in

[45:08] the Lord is always good he always has
[45:10] something for us
[45:11] and the Lord will never leave it lead
[45:14] you to a situation that has not already
[45:15] equip you for though you might not know
[45:18] he said keep you but when the situation
[45:20] arises you would know that this equip
[45:22] you he leaded Joseph to us different
[45:26] situations he equip him before he led
[45:29] Hannah
[45:30] through certain situation she equip
[45:31] Aaron he played a Samson through a
[45:34] situation where he faced a lion when he
[45:37] didn't plan to fight a lion but at the
[45:39] right time the Bible said that anointing
[45:41] of the Lord move on Samson the anointing
[45:44] was in him but then it wasn't our
[45:46] knowing him onto the situation came and
[45:48] when the situation arose the anointing
[45:50] came from within out and then took care
[45:53] of the lion amen so the same Lord the
[45:55] same device with you and whatever
[45:57] situation you are going through now is
[45:59] already equip you and it's prepared you
[46:01] for it
[46:02] Amen when I begin to think about what a
[46:06] minister went into prayer and something
[46:09] came upon my had about seven compound
[46:11] attribute of Jehovah but as I kept
[46:14] stating and praying it was modified to
[46:16] change it today the attributes the
[46:19] servant divine attribute of Elohim amen
[46:22] because their servant before the servant
[46:25] they should be an eighth
[46:26] there should be a zero to start counting
[46:28] from one through seven so the seven
[46:31] attributes has to come from some way and
[46:34] all of them came from Elohim amen
[46:36] so we want to without wasting time let's
[46:39] pick out scriptures and look at how
[46:45] those attributes manifest in your life
[46:47] and we know that God is not God of
[46:50] history he did things in the history
[46:51] which we recollect and read from the
[46:53] Bible to build our faith to seven as an
[46:56] example but I didn't and in history if
[46:59] it ended in history then the scripture
[47:01] should be taken from the Bible Hebrews
[47:03] 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[47:06] history today right now and forever
[47:10] future amen so God is not God of history
[47:14] he was God of history but he's not God
[47:17] of history in the time of Abraham in the
[47:20] time of Wesley in the time of granham he
[47:23] did what he could do in the time of our
[47:24] fathers he did what he needed to do but
[47:28] then is the same God the same
[47:30] Elohim the same Christ Jesus the same
[47:32] mechanic the same son of God son of
[47:35] David son of man right in our time
[47:37] writing you manifesting what he promised
[47:40] manifest for this day amen glory
[47:42] hallelujah so we want to talk about the
[47:44] seven divine attributes of Elohim seven
[47:50] divine attributes of Elohim and Elohim
[47:53] is the eighth is the zero and eight amen
[47:57] let's start a little foundation before
[47:59] reading scriptures Elohim means the soft
[48:02] assistant one is a Hebrew word wait LLL
[48:04] o him we modified it in English to be
[48:07] able to sit in our
[48:08] tank but an original where it means the
[48:10] soft assistant the surface system one
[48:13] the one who doesn't need anybody's hope
[48:15] to exist it doesn't need oxygen to exist
[48:18] it doesn't need ventilator to exist it
[48:21] doesn't need a doctor
[48:21] to exist it doesn't need a medicine to
[48:24] bought a house for him he done it
[48:25] doesn't need a creator because he
[48:28] himself is the creator amen
[48:31] he's the Elohim so is the Almighty is
[48:34] the all-powerful all sufficient soft
[48:37] assistant one
[48:39] that is Elohim amen and in him is every
[48:42] fountain of every blessing comes from
[48:45] Elohim all the blessings that you can
[48:47] look around creation itself came from
[48:50] Elohim without him nothing will exist
[48:53] amen both good and bad nothing can exist
[48:57] without Elohim permitting it amen and
[48:59] what we see as good and bad is all
[49:02] designed to work for the profit of
[49:04] Elohim amen
[49:06] just like let's say when we began this
[49:09] year we talked about year 2020 I
[49:11] remember but I preached on it that is
[49:13] even beyond 2020 vision 2020 2020 is
[49:16] just up to 2020 but is way beyond is in
[49:19] eternity on engine amen
[49:22] so we started the year nicely then we
[49:25] heard about some virus in China you know
[49:27] coming from the news some viral
[49:29] somewhere from different angle which we
[49:32] never thought of this virus coming to us
[49:34] or any part of the world then or too
[49:36] soon this virus begin to hit different
[49:37] part of the world everywhere on the
[49:40] planet in the u.s. just the motor
[49:42] continent and then this virus took over
[49:44] the world
[49:45] amen as if there is no God as if God is
[49:49] not in control as if God is sleeping and
[49:52] something over to him no amen if you
[49:55] read Isaiah chapter 45 1 through 7 si
[49:59] I'm the Lord I created good and I do
[50:01] evil I the LORD do all these things
[50:04] amen so there's not nothing as an angel
[50:07] of the Lord standing right upon the
[50:09] earth amen
[50:11] who is permitting this to go on for
[50:13] divine attributes amen glory hallelujah
[50:16] to the Lord amen glory hallelujah
[50:26] there's nothing we know that a prophet
[50:28] professor about it that is there was
[50:30] going to be a disease that the doctors
[50:33] would not have any anti due to it they
[50:35] wouldn't have a clue what to do to do to
[50:37] it the America books will end when those
[50:40] disease comes on earth because you can
[50:42] read order for my city cause that's my
[50:44] area or the medication thousand and plus
[50:47] none of them can treat this virus or the
[50:50] science is the big one on the planet
[50:52] all over Europe Africa Asia America just
[50:55] name them sad America none of them can
[50:57] fathom where this disease is coming from
[51:00] because he's beyond the beyond amen is
[51:03] what ello implemented for eternal
[51:06] attributes amen
[51:07] you are asked why do why does Elohim
[51:09] permit that why doesn't we enjoy
[51:11] daughter blessing let me use this for
[51:13] example you know Israel in the year
[51:15] around 1940 40 46 48 something begin to
[51:19] happen we know the world war we know
[51:21] what happened to Israel millions of them
[51:23] were killed that one scripture for that
[51:25] Israel will go back to her homeland
[51:28] so for Israel to go back to a homeland
[51:30] god I mean allow a man called a Hitler
[51:34] to arise a dictator and he was even a
[51:37] half job he had he was Jewish himself
[51:39] but then he slaughtered the Jews like he
[51:42] was slaughtering animals just to foreign
[51:45] scripture Israel to be uncomfortable in
[51:47] the Gentile world and go back to
[51:49] Jerusalem to for food richer email when
[51:53] the lot himself was born before that
[51:54] there was a lot of scriptures that
[51:55] Rachel was crying and mourning for her
[51:57] children but they were not found a lot
[52:01] was born we know the story of the three
[52:03] wise men who were ordained to go and
[52:05] worship the Lord and they passed by the
[52:07] King as a he wrote one of the King when
[52:09] he heard said Wow if there's a king born
[52:11] let me know so I can worship Him but
[52:13] they didn't know his heart he was
[52:15] looking at this political Kingdom that
[52:17] Wow so there's going to be a king
[52:18] greater than me I got to take care of
[52:20] this skin so he was deceiving the white
[52:22] man where the wise men but then the lord
[52:25] elohim being with them didn't name
[52:27] everything so he disclosed it to them
[52:29] that don't go back to Herod go by
[52:33] another way and when he saw that he has
[52:35] been tricked
[52:36] they have been more clever and he was he
[52:39] was anointed to forfeit a scripture
[52:42] there Rachel thousands of a children in
[52:44] other was the Hebrew children were
[52:46] slaughtered and Herod commanded that any
[52:48] child looking at historic seas looking
[52:50] at data looking at solicit data based on
[52:53] the data he might be under two years so
[52:55] all the young boys are boys from
[52:57] two-year and under less to cure them so
[53:00] there's the cutest begin to take off
[53:02] those little kiss so that is my before
[53:04] food a scripture that
[53:05] that sons and daughters of rich ritual
[53:08] was crying and mourning for children but
[53:10] they were not the kids were killed
[53:12] amen so it was part of the Scriptures
[53:14] yes it wasn't good part that you want to
[53:16] you wanted to happen but as part of the
[53:18] Scriptures so that it would be fourfold
[53:20] amen because the Lord God is with a law
[53:23] of contrasts the Lord permits the good
[53:25] he permit the bad he permit a bath so
[53:28] that it could be manifested if you never
[53:30] got sick you didn't never need a healer
[53:33] amen you didn't need to verify but if
[53:36] you got sick before that is what you can
[53:38] appreciate Jesus the Rafah in your life
[53:41] the great doctor and the great physician
[53:43] in your life amen
[53:45] if you never be distressed before where
[53:47] you've confused why you couldn't sleep
[53:49] where you couldn't your heart is in
[53:51] turmoil
[53:51] you never enjoyed peace when you can
[53:54] sister and you can see peace all around
[53:56] internally and externally but because
[53:59] we've gone through grief and you've gone
[54:00] through a distress and perplexity of
[54:02] time you can appreciate a piece of
[54:04] Christ in your heart you would even
[54:06] appreciate the new wave if you were not
[54:08] we were not born in sin and iniquity and
[54:11] we were telling lies without even
[54:13] thinking about it you are doing things
[54:15] without thinking about it
[54:16] somebody was motivated with motivating
[54:18] from the inside to do sin but then there
[54:20] was a time someone else took over
[54:22] destroy that the one who was motivated
[54:25] to do evil and then there was a piece
[54:27] that you've never experienced in this
[54:28] dimension and you got to know that
[54:30] behold I am the Lord amen glory
[54:33] hallelujah so begin of this year I will
[54:36] talk about a blessing that was coming
[54:38] the year 2020 all the changes or the
[54:41] organizational groups politics everybody
[54:43] knew there was something going to happen
[54:45] but we never anticipated that it was
[54:47] going to be a coronavirus but God is
[54:50] using the coronavirus to bring their
[54:52] blessing to really divine attributes to
[54:54] manifest on earth amen
[54:56] because the Lord looks beyond our goose
[54:59] and our bus he lose at his word being
[55:02] four-fold
[55:02] what I was good or when I was bad amen
[55:05] so the word of the Lord is he an amen
[55:08] but you have been ordained to fulfill
[55:10] the divine part of the weight that is
[55:12] your blessing amen
[55:13] so let's read Genesis chapter 22 verse
[55:17] 14
[55:18] let's pick the face attributes Genesis
[55:22] 26 22 14 if you want to be on our feet
[55:26] we can blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:34] Genesis 22 14 glory hallelujah to the
[55:41] Lord okay let's go back a story about
[55:44] Abraham let's go back to 12 or like 10
[55:49] an Abraham straight forth his hand and
[55:51] to the knife to slay his son and the
[55:55] angel of the Lord called out him out of
[55:57] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[56:00] said Here I am Here I am I and he said
[56:03] lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do
[56:05] thou anything unto him for now I know
[56:08] that thou fearest God seen that scene
[56:11] thou hast not withheld thy son thine
[56:14] only son from me and Abraham lifted up
[56:17] his eyes and looked and behold behind
[56:19] him a ram caught in a thicket by his
[56:22] horns and Abram went and took the RAM
[56:24] and offered him up for a burnt offering
[56:26] in the stead of his son verse 14 and
[56:29] Abraham called the name of the place
[56:31] dov'è Jireh as it is said to this day in
[56:34] the amount of the Lord it shall be seen
[56:36] an angel of the Lord called unto Abraham
[56:39] out of heaven the second time and said
[56:41] by myself I sworn said the Lord for for
[56:45] because thou hast not that has done this
[56:47] and has not we held thy son thine only
[56:50] son that in blessing I will bless thee
[56:53] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[56:55] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[56:58] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[57:00] I seed shall possess the gate of his
[57:02] enemies amen
[57:03] shall we be seated glory hallelujah viii
[57:07] invested and in thy seed shall all the
[57:09] nations of the earth be blessed because
[57:11] thou has obeyed obeyed my voice amen
[57:15] so the Lord before he could manifest
[57:17] Jehovah Jireh in the life of Abraham
[57:20] there was supposed to be a trial because
[57:23] if there was no need for Brom to need a
[57:25] ram to neither good a mountain good
[57:28] whatever it is RAM then there was not I
[57:30] was not going to be any Java Jarrah has
[57:32] to be
[57:32] the scene but there should be a
[57:34] situation where Graham should come to a
[57:36] distress situation where he has to take
[57:38] take the life of his only son that he
[57:41] had prayed for years him and his wife
[57:44] Sarah since they married at at a tender
[57:46] age maybe they married around less 18 16
[57:49] you know dose time didn't go to school
[57:51] they didn't have to go to high school
[57:53] and college you know get a job and
[57:54] August and so they didn't have
[57:56] television they didn't have technology
[57:58] or they need is what just Marie start
[58:00] your family life and they married they
[58:02] were nobody than you and I they were not
[58:04] different from you and I they were other
[58:05] worshipers his father was Abraham from
[58:08] the Bible means they were triplets if
[58:10] you go to the Bible when you read Abram
[58:12] he said they were born three of them
[58:13] Abraham I think two of his brothers lost
[58:16] father Terah they were actually triplet
[58:18] if you go today
[58:19] read from the Bible so they were just
[58:22] normal people but God ordained him for
[58:24] money for an eternal purpose so the Lord
[58:26] called him from his people and shown him
[58:28] a land he didn't assume the land but is
[58:30] that good where I'm going to show you by
[58:32] faith because the attribute of faith was
[58:34] embodied in Abraham so though he was
[58:37] another worshiper nothing was in him and
[58:39] there was a situation for the law to
[58:40] manifest it so the Lord called him and
[58:42] by faith he moved following the Lord he
[58:45] didn't matter eyes mystics amen he made
[58:47] a bunch of them but the Lord doesn't
[58:50] look up to the mystic he look up to the
[58:52] seed and a calling in your life amen
[58:55] the mystic will be taking care of amen
[58:57] so it doesn't matter how many miss this
[58:59] meat and how many you ever make the lost
[59:02] Colin doesn't I mean the law doesn't it
[59:04] doesn't make it the positives of God in
[59:07] your life I used to say that there's
[59:09] nothing good you can do to deserve
[59:12] eternal life and you cannot commit
[59:14] enough mystic to only treat your eternal
[59:17] life amen
[59:18] there's nothing you can do that eternal
[59:21] life in you will be unelected it does
[59:24] not happen amen
[59:25] so don't let your Mystics the past
[59:27] mister which is no video Mystics amen
[59:29] the one who these dudes and think is
[59:31] dead and gone amen you are just occupant
[59:34] of this Tabernacle he did all those
[59:36] mystics for to learn and experience but
[59:39] then you have a new occupant Jesus
[59:40] Christ who transform you and change you
[59:43] a
[59:44] so the past wasn't you Amen so it
[59:46] doesn't matter how you think about
[59:47] Abraham you've heard a lot yes he made a
[59:49] lot of mistakes but that didn't that
[59:51] didn't again the calling of the Lord in
[59:53] his life so there was a time that the
[59:55] Lord told Abram after living for ninety
[59:58] something years and his wife was almost
[1:00:01] 90 years or 1,900 they had a son Isaac
[1:00:04] they were happy the joy of their life
[1:00:05] and one day the Lord came to him the
[1:00:07] angel of the Lord came to him Abraham
[1:00:08] take your son your only son and go and
[1:00:12] sacrifice for him as a sacred gray and
[1:00:14] sacrifice for him
[1:00:15] sacrifice him for me how would you do it
[1:00:18] just like looking at year 2020 Oh a year
[1:00:21] is going to be a great year of grandeur
[1:00:22] blessings coming and will behold corn a

[1:05:34] talents to to to to explain the
[1:05:38] attributes yamadera is gold gold is what
[1:05:41] date gold is glittering something that
[1:05:45] shines in even in the mists of darkness
[1:05:47] if you have seen gold before Africa we
[1:05:50] used to do with my my grandmother had
[1:05:51] gold and even in the mists of darkness
[1:05:54] when you have a pure gold you can you
[1:05:56] could see are there good glistens you
[1:05:58] could see the shine you could see the
[1:05:59] date in the gold and the natural type
[1:06:02] the spiritual in the mists of your
[1:06:04] darkness there's a date that's a good in
[1:06:06] you Giavotella recite in your tabernacle
[1:06:09] so at a time when you are going under
[1:06:12] there's nothing good coming out of the
[1:06:13] situation
[1:06:14] Giavotella comes up from within you
[1:06:16] ensure that you are made up of gold amen
[1:06:18] glory hallelujah amen
[1:06:21] that's your duty dov'è Rafa the Gila
[1:06:24] that is Jesus Christ with no cavalry
[1:06:26] amen

[1:06:45] help you but there's somebody in you
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:49] there's still small voice the one does
[1:06:51] feed the still small voice the one that

[1:07:00] I applaud fear not he's the one who

[1:07:05] so in the mists of those darkness he
[1:07:06] comes from within out and tisk of your
[1:07:09] situation it could be emotional
[1:07:10] psychological spiritual mental what
[1:07:13] about his sickness but as somebody else
[1:07:16] when the doctors give you up where the
[1:07:18] doctors don't have the medic medication
[1:07:19] and diseases they can find the diagnosis
[1:07:21] the java java Rafah the gila who find
[1:07:24] the diagnosis in a time of the prophet
[1:07:26] ministry a lady came to the prophet and
[1:07:28] she has a backplane they have dance
[1:07:30] edges open surgeries nothing could help
[1:07:32] this lady and as the prophet was talking
[1:07:35] to the lady she saw the lady at a
[1:07:37] younger girl maybe one of those that
[1:07:39] Shalom or one of them is it shallow your
[1:07:40] daughter yes and she said oh okay I see
[1:07:43] you becoming younger person you jump
[1:07:45] from a wall oh I can see you a plane
[1:07:47] around with your friends and you jump
[1:07:49] from a and you had a displacement of
[1:07:51] your disk but because you are young
[1:07:53] nothing physically happened and as you
[1:07:55] grew up now is become complicated the
[1:07:57] doctors can't find it cook the countries
[1:07:59] it they have done or the surgery they
[1:08:01] couldn't fix it but that says the Lord
[1:08:03] you are healed amen
[1:08:05] glory hallelujah to the Lord Jehovah
[1:08:09] Rapha the HeLa
[1:08:10] let's read Exodus 15 20 20 X 15 20 the
[1:08:16] scriptures say a lot maybe those we can
[1:08:18] read we can reduce you write them down
[1:08:20] and read them at home but let's try and
[1:08:22] read Exodus 15:26 to buttress our feet
[1:08:27] so that when you are sick you can call
[1:08:29] on the Lord it doesn't matter what
[1:08:30] sickness it is you can call on the Lord
[1:08:33] the Jaffa Rafa who reciting you to the
[1:08:36] your sickness amen
[1:08:38] when the doctors give up your family
[1:08:39] member or give you up you can rejoice
[1:08:41] and dance that I'm a daughter of Jesus
[1:08:43] Christ I'm some of the Living God it's
[1:08:46] not my time I'm not going
[1:08:48] amen I'm gonna stay right here on eight
[1:08:50] and manifesting amen so Exodus 15:26
[1:08:56] Exodus 15:26 and he said if that would
[1:09:03] gently hicking hecan't to the voice of
[1:09:05] the LORD thy God and we'll do that which
[1:09:07] is right and inside and we'll give ear
[1:09:09] to his commandment and keep all his
[1:09:11] statutes
[1:09:12] I'll put none of these diseases upon you
[1:09:14] which I have brought upon the Egyptians
[1:09:16] I really be in the same time for I am
[1:09:20] the lord that he let the Amen so he said
[1:09:24] it's not going to put you over Rafa he's
[1:09:26] not going to produce cases upon them but
[1:09:28] peradventure by chance you contract
[1:09:31] Korona contract a virus you contract a
[1:09:34] bacteria you contract meningitis it
[1:09:37] doesn't matter what your contract I am
[1:09:39] the Lord your healer amen I heal you
[1:09:42] amen I'll heal you from all second is if
[1:09:45] your cup runs dry and the supplier I'll
[1:09:48] supply for you amen so you don't have to
[1:09:50] feel amen
[1:09:51] you have to work faithfully with a lot
[1:09:53] you have to walk I mean not right but
[1:09:56] know that God is in you amen know that
[1:09:59] you are attend a person and you are here
[1:10:01] for eternal purpose nothing can take
[1:10:03] your life sometimes you pray you believe
[1:10:06] the Lord the Urraco not happen instantly
[1:10:08] there are certain diseases or sickness
[1:10:10] that you pray doesn't mean it doesn't
[1:10:11] mean you don't have faith it doesn't
[1:10:13] mean the law doesn't listen to your
[1:10:14] Freya but the Lord has a bigger
[1:10:15] testimony for you amen
[1:10:17] let's use William Rand for example
[1:10:19] William Bramley stomach problem which we
[1:10:21] know for years when sometime it's this
[1:10:24] is like something he's eating his
[1:10:25] stomach and it sprayed me what there was
[1:10:28] a time he said he prayed for people was
[1:10:29] doing a prayer line pray for cancers
[1:10:31] were dropping people were getting healed
[1:10:33] the dead were being he will raise but
[1:10:36] after that he couldn't even get up from
[1:10:37] to walk because of a stomach pain is not
[1:10:41] something that comes you couldn't
[1:10:42] describe it it's like something eaten
[1:10:44] his intestines and he prayed and
[1:10:46] believed the Lord me work it is healed
[1:10:48] when he pray for them people
[1:10:50] problems were solved thousands and
[1:10:52] millions of them but one day he went to
[1:10:53] pre and this demon which was like a
[1:10:56] squirrel came out he was trying to enter
[1:10:59] his mouth it hit a target and he was
[1:11:01] delivered and when that deliverance came
[1:11:04] his face was drawn on iraq according
[1:11:06] this state but he went home grab a
[1:11:09] camera went back to take a picture and
[1:11:11] there was his face drawn on a rock
[1:11:14] amen ordinarily I wouldn't have June his
[1:11:17] face on a rock had not been that
[1:11:19] situation but for believe in his healing
[1:11:22] even though he was going through the
[1:11:23] pain he was seen as symptoms he was
[1:11:25] going to read from D to D different
[1:11:27] times but it was a time when the Lord
[1:11:29] said I am your healer amen and he to the
[1:11:33] sickness away from him he never suffered
[1:11:35] from that sickness the rest of his life
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] so a situation that could be lingering
[1:11:40] on it doesn't mean Allah doesn't care
[1:11:42] he's even new situation Mountain your
[1:11:43] feet higher and higher and higher and
[1:11:46] higher that you believe in just like
[1:11:48] your father Abraham
[1:11:49] just like your mother Sarah that you
[1:11:51] believe in that the Lord promised you is
[1:11:53] faithful to fulfill their promise glory
[1:11:55] hallelujah to the Lord amen
[1:11:57] it could be a live situation it could be
[1:11:59] al something you need in your life it
[1:12:01] could be whatever
[1:12:02] Berenice you want a child it could be
[1:12:04] wonder husband you want a wife you want
[1:12:06] grandchildren you want a job you want a
[1:12:08] house we want a change we want a school
[1:12:10] whatever you want they are all part of
[1:12:13] the promises for your life amen
[1:12:15] it might not happen the very hour you
[1:12:17] pray but it doesn't mean the Lord has
[1:12:19] turned a blind eye to it no he's letting
[1:12:22] the attribute to you come out stronger
[1:12:23] and stronger and stronger so what you
[1:12:26] believe that even though I don't see the
[1:12:27] child here maybe I admire you for 20
[1:12:29] years I've been seing the child but I
[1:12:32] have a child of children amen and I and
[1:12:36] I've seen I've seen a situation where
[1:12:37] copper mine for years
[1:12:39] the woman was past 50 the man was past
[1:12:42] 50 and one day the woman miss have no
[1:12:45] man strapped Rodan she was thinking
[1:12:46] what's going on they went to do their
[1:12:48] tests she was pregnant she said my lord
[1:12:50] do you think it's true do I have a baby
[1:12:53] in my womb is every day said she has a
[1:12:57] husband do you think there's something
[1:12:58] my womb is I said don't you believe it
[1:13:00] that a lot has done it for us is I
[1:13:02] believe it
[1:13:03] but because it's lingered too much was
[1:13:05] so happy overjoyed that she could even
[1:13:07] believe that for real for rather
[1:13:09] something there's a baby in my womb
[1:13:10] she brought for this baby and I remember
[1:13:13] was in college we took a pitch ended the
[1:13:15] whole church is a big church about six
[1:13:17] hundred we took a picture with her
[1:13:18] sister and the husband and the baby went
[1:13:20] it was dedicated but as that was past
[1:13:22] fifty before she had the baby that was
[1:13:26] around 2000 to 2001 so the Lord is
[1:13:30] anything hard for the Lord there's
[1:13:32] nothing difficult for the Lord it
[1:13:34] doesn't matter the situation it doesn't
[1:13:36] matter how long you've been sick it
[1:13:38] doesn't matter how long you've been poor
[1:13:39] it might have been jobless it doesn't
[1:13:42] matter how long you've suffered the Lord
[1:13:45] is Jehovah Rapha amen the Lord is the
[1:13:50] one who heals all our sicknesses amen
[1:13:53] let's go to LEM give some more
[1:13:55] scriptures we don't have time to read
[1:13:56] all of them as a chapter 4 verse 5 maybe
[1:14:00] let's read this one Isaiah four and five
[1:14:05] slandered over alpha minded I scripture
[1:14:11] praise be to God
[1:14:28] praise be to God
[1:14:34] glory hallelujah amen permit me to read
[1:14:40] a whole scripture as a at a fall in that
[1:14:42] day seven women shall take hold of one
[1:14:45] man saying we will eat our own bread and
[1:14:47] we're our own apparel only let us be
[1:14:49] called by thy name to take away our
[1:14:51] reproach that was the seven th Ages when
[1:14:54] the force changed the false bride I
[1:14:56] wanted to marry Christ but he didn't
[1:14:58] want the name of Christ
[1:14:59] what is the name date date the gold it
[1:15:02] didn't want Christ to live in hey so
[1:15:04] only I want to be called a Christian I
[1:15:06] want to be called a church person but I
[1:15:08] don't want the Holy Ghost baptism I
[1:15:10] don't want the message for the hour I
[1:15:11] don't want to assert a message of the
[1:15:13] day I don't want to accept your mess
[1:15:15] messenger but I just want to be called a
[1:15:17] Christian I want to be a normal for my
[1:15:19] Christian amen
[1:15:20] because if I if an otherwise a party
[1:15:23] would not look good on you it would be a
[1:15:25] reproach so I want to be like a woman
[1:15:26] who is not married so when you are
[1:15:29] married
[1:15:29] okay misses something but meanwhile she
[1:15:32] doesn't respect a husband
[1:15:33] meanwhile the husband is running around
[1:15:34] with other women but at least she's
[1:15:36] caught misses so that is what the church
[1:15:38] wanted and in that dish had a brand by
[1:15:40] the second verse is that in the dish had
[1:15:42] a branch of the Lord now this the loss
[1:15:44] the branch coming from the Lord this is
[1:15:46] the true vine
[1:15:47] this is the true bride a true life of
[1:15:49] Christ must manifest in her character in
[1:15:52] that dish added shad a branch of the
[1:15:54] Lord be beautiful and glorious and the
[1:15:56] fruits of the earth shall be excellent
[1:15:58] and calmly for them that are escaped of
[1:16:00] Israel and it shall come to pass that he
[1:16:02] that is left in Zion and he died minute
[1:16:04] in Jerusalem shall be called holy even
[1:16:07] every one that is written among the
[1:16:08] living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall
[1:16:10] have washed away the filth of the
[1:16:12] daughters of Zion and shall have
[1:16:14] preached the blood of Jerusalem from the
[1:16:16] midst thereof by the spirit of judgment
[1:16:18] and by the sweat of Benin and the Lord
[1:16:20] will create upon every dwelling place of
[1:16:22] Mount Zion and upon high assemblies a
[1:16:24] cloud and a smoke by D and a Shannon of
[1:16:28] a flaming fire by night for upon all her
[1:16:31] glory shall be a difference amen Giovani
[1:16:35] see the one who defend you amen the Lord
[1:16:38] is your defense
[1:16:39] amen and a versus a and there shall be a
[1:16:42] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[1:16:44] from the heat for a place of refuge and
[1:16:46] for
[1:16:47] covered from storm and from rain that is
[1:16:50] your protector Giovanni see amen
[1:16:52] glory hallelujah so he defends you how
[1:16:55] do you do how do you think of yourself
[1:16:57] when you go to sleep no do you know when

[1:27:02] okay les 3:23 downs and allah said unto
[1:27:05] him peace be unto thee so now because of
[1:27:08] the stories on that we are not not all
[1:27:10] of us are used to be so I'd like to go
[1:27:11] give a little background let's read from
[1:27:14] verse 19 when Gideon was in distress he
[1:27:16] was one of the judges in Israel and God
[1:27:19] went in and made ready a kid sorry and
[1:27:21] Gideon went in and made ready a kid the
[1:27:24] angel of the Lord came to announce his
[1:27:25] ministry that you should save Israel and
[1:27:28] he said me Who am I I am the least and
[1:27:31] so let's look at the conversation and
[1:27:33] Gideon went in and made ready a kid and
[1:27:36] unliving kicks of an ephah of flour the
[1:27:39] flesh he put in a basket and he put
[1:27:41] their broth in the pot and brought it
[1:27:43] out onto him under the oak and presented
[1:27:45] it and it and the angel of the Lord said
[1:27:47] unto him take their flesh and their own
[1:27:49] living kicks and lay them upon this rock
[1:27:51] and pour out their broth and his dessous
[1:27:54] then the angel of the Lord put forth the
[1:27:56] end of the staff that was in his hand
[1:27:58] and touch the flesh and only wind kicks
[1:28:00] and they rose up a fire out of the rock
[1:28:03] and consume the flesh and the living
[1:28:04] case then the angel of the Lord departed
[1:28:07] out of his sight and when Gideon
[1:28:09] perceived that he was an angel of the
[1:28:10] Lord Gideon said alas o God our Lord God
[1:28:13] for because I have seen an angel of the
[1:28:15] Lord face to face and the Lord said unto
[1:28:17] him peace be unto thee fear not thou
[1:28:20] shalt not die then Gideon built an altar
[1:28:23] there onto the Lord and called it Jewish

[1:37:09] righteousness glory hallelujah to the
[1:37:11] Lord the Lord our righteousness he's a
[1:37:14] very righteousness because you and I
[1:37:16] could not manufacture our own
[1:37:17] righteousness when we are born in sin
[1:37:19] but a lot took care of all our sins
[1:37:21] iniquity the old person was dead and a
[1:37:23] lot of washed us from all our sins of
[1:37:26] commission and omission and allowed
[1:37:28] himself step into your flesh took over
[1:37:30] this flesh and this rage became his
[1:37:32] tabernacle glory hallelujah we can look
[1:37:34] at a scripture from Jeremiah 23 sixth
[1:37:38] blessed be the name of the Lord Jeremiah
[1:37:41] 23 16 our Lord is killed the Lord is
[1:37:50] good Jeremiah 20 20 23 16
[1:38:06] right that's the geometry 3 system that

[1:38:13] of the prophecy that professor unto you
[1:38:16] they make you VIN they make you vain
[1:38:19] they speak a vision of their own hat and
[1:38:21] not out of the Lord our mouth ok so
[1:38:26] that's just the Lord but a lot himself
[1:38:28] is your righteousness
[1:38:29] let's read also Romans 3:20 22 Romans
[1:38:32] 3:20 to Romans 3:20 - blessed be the

[1:38:51] them that believe for there's no
[1:38:53] difference for all have sinned and come
[1:38:56] short of the glory of God
[1:38:57] the Lord Himself give us his
[1:38:59] righteousness is that even the
[1:39:00] righteousness of God which is by faith
[1:39:02] of Jesus Christ is not a righteousness
[1:39:04] that you created yourself but the Lord
[1:39:07] by faith give you that righteousness
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:10] because the Lord is what ought of
[1:39:11] righteousness so when he lives in you

[1:39:16] is any suit and everything heat is
[1:39:19] called a suit he may be dry clean it he

[1:39:45] garment and a lot is come true and they
[1:39:48] take the taking of the needs of those

[1:42:23] the Trinity of God is Christ manifest in

[1:42:32] the 35 is it kill for a 35 they solve a
[1:42:36] system one Java Shama Shama is the Lord
[1:42:40] is present and that color is the color
[1:42:43] of fiery the amber color when the Lord
[1:42:45] applause fire comes it comes in
[1:42:47] yellowish amber but before the lot of
[1:42:49] present yellow is a color of death
[1:42:51] you have to die first before that God
[1:42:53] can show its brilliance the god has to
[1:42:56] pass through fire and put yourself going
[1:42:59] through distresses if you look at the
[1:43:01] element gold go doesn't have a feeling
[1:43:03] is just an object but I look at you
[1:43:05] going through distress and times tryouts
[1:43:07] and afflictions going through prod of
[1:43:09] cunha virus where it goes through much
[1:43:11] restrictions where your finances are hit
[1:43:14] but in those times the Lord is refining
[1:43:17] you now when you go to the other side
[1:43:19] you shine like wad like a gold the the
[1:43:22] cut off crisis manifested the physical
[1:43:24] presence is yours
[1:43:25] there's free job blessings are all yours
[1:43:27] because God has to pass you to before he
[1:43:29] gives you power and authority the Lord
[1:43:31] has to put his Carter first in you we
[1:43:33] have a lot of leaders without character
[1:43:35] I don't want to name that you can name
[1:43:37] millions of them I can do that we have
[1:43:39] political leaders religious leaders clay
[1:43:41] statically this family leaders which do
[1:43:44] not have a cutter of Christ and you know
[1:43:46] that it's turmoil but induce would cut
[1:43:48] off Christ their life is sweet and
[1:43:51] peaceful and loving and kind because
[1:43:54] it's not them as a human being but is
[1:43:56] Christ United in them as flesh amen
[1:44:00] Christ and his weight glory hallelujah
[1:44:03] to the Lord blessed be the name of the
[1:44:05] Lord the Lord is so amazing the
[1:44:08] blessings of the Lord you look at the
[1:44:09] word Jehovah the original word is we can
[1:44:11] even pronounce that you might bite your
[1:44:13] tongue if you try to do it their
[1:44:14] original what is poured if you put in
[1:44:16] English GVH you if you want to if you
[1:44:19] want to pronounce it I don't know if you
[1:44:21] can't do it give you I don't know if you
[1:44:23] want to do that so the original word
[1:44:25] cannot is it's so mysterious so we have
[1:44:27] to use English weight to make it you
[1:44:29] have a like sing it like we're a DJ e or
[1:44:32] je h VA h VA so the lord is is a mystery
[1:44:38] yet he manifests himself in simplicity
[1:44:40] the great mysterious god who are played
[1:44:43] in the time of Abraham to Isaac
[1:44:46] moisés when it came there were clouds
[1:44:48] there were pillars of fire they're worth
[1:44:50] endurance there were lightnings you
[1:44:52] after wanted to die because if the
[1:44:54] presence of God calm the human nature
[1:44:56] has not bought to receive it so the Lord
[1:44:58] has to break himself down called the
[1:45:00] holy goose come and hide in you and
[1:45:02] living you speak as a still small voice
[1:45:05] speak three or pasta speak through your
[1:45:07] brother speak through ministers and it's
[1:45:10] so simple that you can receive it you're
[1:45:12] not going to run away when you see by
[1:45:13] the jack but then if the people of fire
[1:45:15] come visibly you might not be able to
[1:45:17] contain it
[1:45:17] even if your own guardian angel shows
[1:45:19] himself to you maybe you might pass out
[1:45:21] so he knows how much you can contain so
[1:45:25] you do with you in that angle if he can
[1:45:27] appear to me we find you appear to you
[1:45:29] you can appear like a human being
[1:45:31] just like the Brahms why he came as a
[1:45:33] human being put his arms around him
[1:45:35] comforted him and then went back to the
[1:45:36] pillar of fire so you I a pillar of fire
[1:45:38] before you came on earth
[1:45:39] I wondered I'm going nuts before you
[1:45:43] drop as a human being before you made
[1:45:45] your first mistake
[1:45:46] before you begin to give your first cry
[1:45:48] you yell out God when babies are born
[1:45:50] you were a pillar of fire you a part of
[1:45:52] Christ you were him and it's you amen
[1:45:55] and it put you here to manifest him and
[1:45:58] nothing can touch you until it's done
[1:46:01] all done with you amen you are a tenor
[1:46:04] as a tenor can be even your flesh is
[1:46:06] atena until the Lord is finished with it
[1:46:10] until your flesh your human body is
[1:46:14] antenna I can bear witness that you have
[1:46:17] died long ago many instances actually
[1:46:18] I've been living here but the law
[1:46:20] library Jack said your purpose what
[1:46:22] carries you write your purpose that God
[1:46:24] has ordained for you protects you so the
[1:46:27] purpose God has for you is your
[1:46:28] protection and so you have to walk with

[2:14:24] Jesus and I just appreciate how he uses
[2:14:28] his different ministers a man we thank
[2:14:31] God for you brother quick who god bless
[2:14:33] you a man hallelujah amen and that's you
[2:14:38] know
[2:14:39] a little pray line there that we had I
[2:14:42] tell you sometimes you just have to as
[2:14:46] the Lord is moving you just got to move
[2:14:48] with him but I was just thinking to
[2:14:50] myself you know what others just coming
[2:14:52] up and standing in the gap for whether
[2:14:54] family members or church members of
[2:14:56] whatever it is remember that when
[2:14:59] brother Branham went to it was overseas
[2:15:02] and I forget this the exact think it was
[2:15:04] Finland but a little boy was healed he
[2:15:06] was raised from the dead by being hit by
[2:15:08] a car but there was another little boy
[2:15:11] that God didn't show him in the vision
[2:15:13] that was also involved in the accident
[2:15:14] and the ancient Lord showed up until the
[2:15:17] prophets say now if you want to see that
[2:15:20] boy healed then you gonna have to do
[2:15:22] something and he told me I have to eat a
[2:15:24] certain piece of candy the candy was so
[2:15:26] bitter he said brother branham's begin
[2:15:29] to eat him he spit it out he said naw if
[2:15:30] you don't eat that can to get it down
[2:15:32] and that boy won't be healed sometimes
[2:15:34] you have to stand in the gap for
[2:15:35] somebody else right sometimes if you
[2:15:38] want to see something happen you got to
[2:15:39] do something different right so I just
[2:15:41] believe that we're gonna see what what
