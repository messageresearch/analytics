where Jesus had been to this person's house the man that was paralyzed couldn't walk but he went to the meeting at the house where Jesus was got there they didn't have rules and get him in so he acts as friends to take them to the roof and they began to just take that roof apart and they dropped the man down inside of the presence of the Lord I was just digging itself you know the story of such magnitude and one that just gives us so much strength and encouragement it happened in a very humble place right it did happen in a meeting where there was fifty thousand people gathered it's just a little house meeting just a few people gather but seems like our Lord does its best work well it's just a few people gather a man so I pray tonight that you would come under expectation and just just

our knives but we had some church and new album we had Church glory they're gone but I thank God for my precious friend and a man he'll be coming to minister for us tonight in a little bit I also want

Jennifer back with us she's been away for a little bit but she's back and so good to have her back amen in the house of the Lord tonight praise the Lord so a man we're not going to take too much time we we were we wanted to dedicate this service tonight to preaching on the word and then we wanted to have a prayer line and initially what I want to do is a man I know that everybody certainly welcome to come to the prayer line but but the the first one is right after the minister comes from under these anointing the first ones that I would like to come into the Carolinas those that have really really you know you know that you're going through something really tough you need or you need a touch from ground I'm not talking about a headache I'm talking about you got something we just saw God heal cancer here in our church and we praise the Lord and man it's not the first time that he's done it he's done it before but you know we were we were there brother Nathan and our sisters wanted prayer and he'll share it a little bit later on but we saw God humor we saw got healer and and when we saw that we just felt like there was a spirit was moving a man at this time and when the angels trouble in the water that's when you got to jump in right that's when you got to jump in so we wanted to just invite anybody was sick in their bodies I've called people that I knew had cancer and I invited them to come out and you know and even though they might not have been able to make it there's there's some that was telling me sometimes you're going through your body state you just attacked you so much and he just you know even it starts changing the way that you're looking the way you feel about yourself and sometimes people just don't want to come a man because of that but you know we can still pray for them in anyway you know that the word of the Lord can go right where they are and bring healing to their body if they're open to it so tonight a man will have those that are really initially at the start of the prayer line we want those that you know that you're going through something a man and you need God to really touch your body we want you to come into prayer line first and a man we want you just to come and take your time and just let let brother Nathan pray with you and for you and then you know those that like I got a little something I'm going through my body my leg been bothering me about three months I want to get prayer tonight you know but but I want to give first space to to those that I know that might have something like serious a lot more serious than what I'm going through but I believe God's concerned about Amy in every case tonight even if you come with faith I believe God can heal you and the other thing that we would teach her in this church a man you don't have to be a Christian to get your healing you don't have to be a Christian to get healing you don't but if you want to keep your healing then you got to become a Christian amen that's why Jesus said go and sin no more alright cuz if you want to keep your healing you've got to become a Christian but in men we just want to open up this we just were just concerned about people tonight and we want to we just want to pray for years the Lord would allow amen our precious brother just to deal with those situations and and we're not here to try to push people down and knock them down and and in the name of Jesus not just gonna be a simple word of Prayer you become a simple faith you don't have something your faith your faith is so simple if you sat down in that chair without checking to see if we're gonna hold you you don't know if we took the screws out a lot but you sit in that chair knowing you had confidence that that chair hold you come with confidence tonight nor your God can heal you and will heal you come with that type of confidence you got faith and as the minister's preaching the Word of God may he elevate your faith tonight Amen let's just welcome Amen brother brother Nathan [Music] let's just go back to the song water what a beautiful name it is the name of Jesus and we want to give brother Nathan free course he is a singer and preacher hey Manny

man that same service there was a man that died in the middle of the service for the West Cohen brother Ferguson but the Billy Paul went back and prayed for him he came back to life they took him out back try to get him some air he died again they prayed for him he came back 16 years later he's a deacon at my church and hey man amen and one of our he's one of our associate ministers as well he preached for us Wednesday night while I was out of town so God still God a man he's still the healer he's still Hebrews 13 and 8 amen I'm gonna try and I say try because it depends on the Lord if he has a different plan we'll go with his plan not mine but I'm gonna try not to preach very long tonight because the prayer line but I want to just take a little thought here for a little bit and then I want to read you some scriptures and quotes in the line of thought for healing since we're gonna have a prayer line with the help of the Lord tonight I want you to first turn with me if you would to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 and just want to look at one verse there tonight brother Branham taught us that Satan hates this book and the book of Revelation more than any other books in the Bible because the book of Genesis tells us where he came from and all of his tactics what what we see today the evils in the world today started back in Genesis and the book of Revelation shows him where he's going to wind up at so he hates these two books Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul I want to speak to you tonight with the help of the Lord on the architect of our bodies the architect of our bodies let's just bow our heads together your heavenly father Lord as we approach your throne again tonight Lord feeling your presence here is the songs of Zion we're sang and roar just feeling an atmosphere of worship to be able to come together Lord and the scripture teaches us that where your Spirit is there's Liberty Father and Lord what a blessing it is to have liberty and freedom in the spirit Lord to have the truth that we've rallied around in this age Lord that that there's been a restoration of the word back and those things that have been lost down through the ages yet they were right there in the pages of our Bible all along but yet in this age there's been a restoration back to the original truth we thank you for that father we thank you for eyes to see and ears to hear father we thank you Lord that you've given us a love for the truth because the Bible teaches us that there would be many in this last day that wouldn't have a love for the truth and they'd be turned over to evil thoughts and they'd be turned over to believe a lie instead of the truth because they didn't love the truth but we thank you for a love for the truth in this age Lord we thank you for placing that down in our hearts Lord we need more of you tonight or there's many here that are sick and body and order that have scars whether they be physical or emotional or spiritual whatever it would be Lord as they come through the prayer line tonight I just ask that you would touch each one Lord and give them a touch from you in a way that only you can Father are our hands as human vessels are a poor substitute Lord for yours but yet we're taught that you have no hands but ours no lips but ours no feet but ours Lord if you're gonna do work down here on earth that you work through the body of Christ which is present here in the form of your bride Lord and that if someone's going to be encouraged Lord that she'll use a person to go and encourage them if somebody's going to be healed you'll use a person to go pray for them or to lay hands on them lord if and whatever it would be father you're still using the body tonight Lord and it's a body move of believers around the world not just in West Palm Beach or not just a New Albany Indiana but the have a body move in this age that you're still moving Lord in China and Zimbabwe in South Africa and up in Europe and down into Australia and all over the world father there's members of your bride that are working together Lord to try to get us ready Father for that day that's approaching when you would come back for its Lord and we just want to make our hearts ready tonight father if there's anything that would be I'm pleasing to you in our life Lord may we lay it aside tonight and if there's things that have hindered our walk with you and we recognize that Lord maybe they prevented us from getting into the fellowship that we should have with you father help us to lay them aside tonight and to run quickly to you father the author and finisher of our faith we give you the glory and the praise for the testimonies that we believe will come forth from this service tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you can be seated tonight the Bible says here that God formed man of the dust of the ground now originally if we go back to the very beginning it tells us in Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and when God began to speak there was nothing there had never been anything God was out in eternity and we think many times in our humanistic way we think in measures of days and weeks and months as we just sang about we think of you know we can imagine a hundred years pretty easy a thousand years is really hard for us to grasp but we can think back into history for a thousand years or even back to the beginning of time but to think of eternity it's really hard for our human mind to grasp it that there never was a beginning there never was an end that God in His infinite power was out there in eternity with his own thoughts and there had never been light he was dwelling out there in darkness but one day he begins to speak and when he begins to speak these thoughts that he had in his mind throughout eternity God's not like us he doesn't learn something new every day he can't change and make a better way than what he did in the first place but God in his in his eternal thinking he had these thoughts but he had never vocalized them and he he had held this in his thinking he had never spoke it forth because it wasn't time yet and he knew that at least spoke these thoughts they would spin into existence and one day he recognizes that it's time for a light to come into existence and he said let there be lights now he didn't have a Zippo lighter he didn't have a flashlight he didn't have a spotlight he didn't have anything to produce this light except his spoken word but when he began to speak the word weather had never been light before life began to burst forth and separate the darkness from the light it's still doing it today light is still dividing the darkness from the light and he begins to speak and I'll skip ahead a little bit and read Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear that means when you look around the room tonight you can look at your own hand you can look at these walls you can look at the seat you can look at the carpet you can look at this leather-bound Bible or this wooden dansker whatever you would look at anything you can see visibly with your eyes was formed by things that were invisible by things which we couldn't see you Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that we can't even see faith produces things that aren't even tangible to us faith produces things that you know it's even hard for us to imagine but faith goes out and proclaims that brute venom teaches it this way he said that God believed his own word and that was what produced it when God spoke it forth he believed his own word and when he said let there be light there was when he said let there be a heavens and let there be an earth he didn't have timbers he didn't have plaster he didn't have nails and screws he didn't have anything if we were to go and build something we could tangibly go down to Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever you have and we could pick out the boards that we thought were the best and we could pick out the best drywall and we could our most brothers could I'm not a very good carpenter but some brothers can begin to design something they could build up walls and they could make you nice pillars for you know to support while ceilings in your homes and they could begin to design all this and you can sit back and think oh my there's the gift that God has gave them to be able to build but God when he went to build he didn't have any materials to build with he couldn't go down to Lowe's or Home Depot and buy him some dust he couldn't go down to Lowe's or Home Depot and buy him a tree or buying the flower or buying some grass he couldn't go down and get grass seed and fertilizer but he began to speak and the first lanes of grass and the first trees and the first tangible things the first speck of dust begin to come into existence where it had been invisible a few moments before but the spoken word of God began to go forth and he began to create dust and some of you sisters do your best to keep it out of your house it's a creation of God he began to speak dust particles and sand particles and dirt particles and he began to speak and where there was nothing hid begin to form and it began to form the first tree and from that tree there was the seeds in these trees that he spoke forth that would be in every tree down through the ages what was needed was in these original trees that he planted every piece of grass that covers the face of the earth I don't know how big he started with I don't know if he started with the football field I don't know if he started with the one by one square or one blade of grass but every seed that would ever need to be for grass for all of the earth was in that original grass that he created every seed for every son and daughter of God that would ever be was in that first man that he created and all I know today in this age you know people divided over race and over culture and over jock geographic location but every one of us was in that first man that God spoke forth and created at the seed for every man and every woman that would ever live was right there placed in the Garden of Eden and God speaks it and there was nothing but he begins to form man out of the dust of the earth now I don't know about you if we were to go out here you know we in Indiana about every third year we get enough snow to make a snowman you probably don't get enough snow to make a snowman in 50 years but but about every three years we get one you know if you go out and make a snowman but he made man out of the dust and if you was to go out here and get you some dust and begin to pack it together and get you some water and you make it the best that you could make it and it would probably look like a mess and you go out and get you a carrot for a nose and some sticks for a hands and some sticks for legs and you set it out there and you know it might resemble somebody might be able to say you know that kind of resembles a human being but I don't know what it is it looks like a mess but when God began to speak and to be able to create this a man from the dust of the earth where there was nothing and he takes a handful of destiny says and there's a man standing in the garden with the same amount of teeth that you have maybe more depending on how many you've lost with the same amount of bones that you have with the same amount of arteries and car puzzles and the same amount of brain cells the same lungs the same heart everything that you have God just goes let there be [Applause] he didn't hatch him as an embryo for nine months he didn't have an incubator that he could raise him in he didn't grow him up from a little tiny cell and into a baby and then to a teenager he speaks and hears full-grown man standing in the garden God formed the man of the dust of the earth where there was nothing to form him with he couldn't go down like some of these guys do you know under harvest a kidney from somebody and and put in somebody else and he couldn't go down to a heart transplant there was no heart there was no kidney there was no nothing to form it from but he takes the dust of the earth and he says let there be and there was now I'm gonna read you some statistics here about the human body if some of your doctors or nurses or things like that you may already know this but it says I'm gonna read a few from Wikipedia first it says almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements oxygen carbon hydrogen nitrogen calcium and phosphorus 99% of your body is made up of those six elements now recognize there's some of us here that have more of those elements and some of us that have less of those elements because there's more or less of us here than somebody else but we all have these same six elements within us oxygen carbon hydrogen nitrogen calcium and phosphorus 99% of your body is made up of those six elements down about 0.85 of the rest of you is composed of another five elements potassium sulfur sodium chlorine and magnesium and all eleven of these of these elements are necessary for you to have life you take any one of these elements you take the calcium out completely or the phosphorus or the potassium or the sulfur any of these eleven elements you take it completely out of the human body and you will cease to exist as far as a life a breathing living body now there would still be a shell of a human being laying there like we've taken put in the graveyard but you couldn't have life without these eleven that are necessary now the remaining elements which I guess would be 0.15 elements of your body are trace elements of which are more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary of life so God when he put this together he was very specific he didn't just randomly and haphazardly put it together and then when the next person came out you know this wouldn't had a little bit more of this and that went a little bit more of that he places all of these elements in the human body that are necessary for life now people want to teach us about random selection and evolution and things like that but I'll be honest with you I don't have enough faith to believe all that I don't have enough faith to believe that we that all this just randomly happened and that you're just randomly sitting here tonight because you know some speck crawled out of the mud 50 million years ago and it begins to evolve gradually I've got a little bit more confidence in the human specie than that and you know some of some people you know it makes us wonder sometimes but we have a little bit more confidence than the human specie than that and just see even let's just do away with the human race and not even look at that right now but to look at nature and to look at the solar system to look at galaxies and to look out in the vast expanses of space and bodies and solar systems and Suns and stars and moons and in God places this earth just the right distance away from the Sun that we won't burn up any places it's just close enough to the Sun so that we won't freeze and he puts a rotation to where there can be changes in the climate and changes in the seasons and so that brother Nathan wants to come evangelize Florida around November and December January and and he places all this in a cycle and the Sun will rotate you know or the earth will rotate around in its orbit and it'll cross around the Sun in a specific pattern in the year and it'll spin itself around in a 24-hour cycle and you know the watches no matter how good to watch you get after a few days or a few weeks or a few months it's gonna be off a few seconds or a few minutes or fast a few minutes or a few seconds but it keeps perfect timing has never missed a beat has never missed a second except for that time that Joshua said son stand still and the spoken word of a man stopped in earth that God had put into Herbet orbit because it wasn't the man that was speaking it was God that was speaking through the man no man can do that if you can go out here tomorrow and prove it to me there's no human being that can produce that but it was the spoken word of God being quickened through the human lips of a man and so God places all this now if you were to go and you were to buy a Swiss watch you know maybe several thousand dollars and you were to take it apart into little bitty pieces in the frame and and the band and the glass cover and each gear and each each little band and needle and and every little hand and all that and he was to take it apart into a hundred tiny little pieces and you was to take a little silk bag and put it in that and he was to sit there and shake that in a bag for about five million years could you expect to open that out and the watch speed not only put together the way that it was designed to be but then it would be keeping perfect time and with the correct time I don't have that much faith but that's what these people yes what a lot of college professors will teach you that all this just happened randomly and it was just random choice but if it takes an intelligent design to make a faulty watch that will lose a few seconds or gain a few seconds how much more would it take an intelligent design to create a solar system in a world in a moon and a Sun in a galaxy that keeps perfect time and perfect rhythm and that he would place at Earth in a certain area that where it wouldn't burn up and yet it wouldn't freeze up and where we had just enough just enough of pressure on it that you wouldn't suffocate but yet that you wouldn't just float off into space somewhere that there would be enough gravity that would hold your feet on the earth so you wouldn't just fly off out into space but yet not so much gravity that it wouldn't just crush you into the ground that it would have just enough oxygen to where you could breathe but not so much oxygen that we would just combust and all these different elements that God would place in our atmosphere specifically so that we could live on it I don't have enough faith to believe that it just happened randomly but just as it would take an intelligent design to create a watch so to create a are to create a house it takes an intelligent design to be the architect of these bodies that are so complex your body is composed of 206 bones by adulthood after some bones are fused together you have approximately 320 pairs of bilateral muscles that means you've got a 320 on this side and 320 on that side that they act you know the arms on your left arm act like the arms on your right arm and vice-versa 320 pairs of bilateral muscles now some of you you know some of these are more defined than others as you know but but they're still you got the same amount of muscles the small intestine in an adult is about 23 feet long and the large intestine is about 5 feet long if all of your arteries and your veins and your capillaries in your human circulatory system were laid in to end how many how long do you think the length would be anybody want to guess a couple football fields okay anybody else five miles anybody else 60,000 miles you go and search it on Google when you get home tonight if you were to lay out all of your arteries and your veins and your capillaries it would be 60,000 miles stretched Indian some of you haven't even drove your your little minivans that far 60,000 miles and God places it and winds each capillary and each artery into each place that it's supposed to be this architect designs this if we were to try to divide to design 60,000 miles you know Trump's trying to build a wall that's just a few thousand miles long and it's gonna take forever to build if he ever gets it built and by the time he does there'll be a bunch of Mexicans on pogo sticks that will figure out a way to get over it but God plays 60,000 miles of arteries and veins and capillaries in your body and he didn't just throw them in there you know brother some of the brothers you know they'd have different types of jobs my daddy's a plumbing contractor and he you know he he puts pipes and things together in homes and and brother Troy he's an electrician he takes wires and he puts them through places but if they were just to jam all these wires into the wall and just jam about you know 50 yards of them in there and then turn on the light switch and expect it to work nothing would happen because every every wire has to be connected to the right circuit and to the right breaker and it's got to go to the right outlet if you're going to expect a response and God wires 60,000 miles of arteries and capillaries so that your heart can pump and move things to the right place at the right time so that you can breathe and they say it's just as random selection I don't have that much faith your brain is made up of a complex network of billions of nerve cells called neurons and the number of neurons is estimated at roughly a hundred billion I know a lot of people think I have less than that but approximately a hundred billion neurons in your brain through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God now you think about each one of us here how many how many millions of miles of arteries and capillaries if we put just everybody in this city together then you think about all the state of Florida then you think about all the United States and all of the world as a whole how many millions and billions of miles of veins did God have to place into this one seed in this man that it would come forth and it would produce and reproduce and reproduce and yet it wouldn't you know it wouldn't after 50,000 people say sorry this is just this is all there is to it everything was in those original seeds that God had placed back there at the beginning now you take a tape and you make a copy of a copy of a copy after a few copies it gets to where you you can't even hardly hear it or don't want to be around it but God made a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy down through the ages and it's still working the way that he intended it to work the impersonation of Christianity 1957 brother Branham says remember here's encouragement for you people that's to be prayed for he's talking to you tonight for you people this to be prayed for if the Holy Spirit by brooding made the physical being who is the ARCA he says who is the architect of our bodies Oh God made people see it the Holy Spirit gave you your appendix your eyes your nose your mouth your hearts he goes on a little further he says if God did that without you having any say-so in it you never said make me thus who taking any thought could add one cubit to his stature but if he made you thus without you having anything to say how much more can he threw his routeing give you a choice if he could bring brother Troy here brother Troy couldn't pick you know and say I want to be a NFL football player son or I want to be a jazz musician son or I want to be a a Hollywood star son because I want to be able to have all the finances that I needed and he couldn't pick which family he was going to be connected with he couldn't pick what color hair he was gonna have what color skin he was gonna have what color eyes he was gonna add how tall he was gonna be how short he was gonna be what size shoe he couldn't pick any of that God just placed him here and if God could bring you here and give you an appendix and the eyes and a nose and a heart lungs and all that without you having any choice in it how much some more when something begins to break down in your body you say oh brother Nathan pray for me doctor says I have diabetes doctor says I have cancer doctor says have liver failure doctor says I have kidney stones how much more when some of these things begin to break down can you want you to have a choice and you say God I need your help you can say God I need your help when he was back there and your great-great Grandaddy somewhere as a seed that came down through your history of your genealogy you can pick back there and say God I need your help God I need you to get my great-great-granddaddy with my great-great grand mama so they can have my great-grandparents and they can have my grandparents and then my parents can meet you know at some restaurant and they can fall in love and they can have me god I need your help to get me here you couldn't say all that but God coordinated all of that and brought you here and placed you here without you having any choice in it how much some more can he do for you now that you can say god I need you God I need your help I recognize that I'm a needy person tonight I need your help tonight there's a story that's told back in the days of Henry Ford that he had a great warehouse and and there was a boilermaker in this warehouse a great boiler rather and and they were having some problems with it getting into work and so they hired this this famous boiler maker to come and work on this great boiler in the steam room that they had and he comes in and other men have tried to work on it they went back and they looked at the original diagrams of the boiler and they couldn't figure it out and so they called for this great renowned boiler maker to come in and he walks around the thing and he listens to it for a little while and he goes over to his tool bag and he unzips it and he gets out just a little bitty hammer and he comes over and he taps on the side of the thing and it begins to chug and the sputter and to run perfectly normal and he goes home and he mails the company a bill for $1,000 and they called the man they said sir we have a problem with this bill they said we know the amount of time that you were here and we would like you to send us an itemized bill to explain to us why this was so expensive that you would come in and spend five minutes downstairs and send us this bill for $1000 and so he sends a Mack a bill and he said $50 for the service call time and 950 dollars for no and where to knock nobody else could do it $50 to go and knock on the thing but nine hundred and fifty dollars for knowing where to not now doctors do their best and we're not here to belittle doctors I thank God for doctors I believe that God heals through doctors I believe that God heals through medicine he heals through loud the heals through music he he heals through touch he heals for many different things in many different ways but it's God that ultimately gets the glory for whatever it would be if you go down here and you fall and you slip on the sidewalk and break your arm you don't go to the doctor and say doctor can you heal me you say doctor can you set my arm and then God comes and does the healing yeah if you get the flu and you go to you don't go to the doctor say doc I've got the flu can you give me some medicine to heal me he gives you some medicines to try to fight off those bad antibodies and things in your body and then once that begins to clear up it's God that comes and brings in the healing they can give you something to clean the germs off they can give you something to try to fight off whatever it is but it takes God to produce the healing and so what God does where many of us you know no matter how good are our motives would be or how good our intentions would be we don't know sometimes exactly where it is that we need to knock we know we know we can explain about the human body and the doctor can give you this and tell you to try that they can try to diagnose but sometimes it takes God just to come by and knock at your heart and say I already healed you I already healed you hey man I paid a price that nobody could pay I came and I knew right where to knock because I was the architect of the original thing in the first place I'm going to share with you a few testimonies tonight to try to build your faith and and my we've seen some incredible things over the years that God has done in this age and but I want to just bring it right down to the last couple of years some things that we've seen God do in our church this isn't the give Nathan Bryant Maury this is you give Jesus Christ glory we have a watch-night service a few years ago and there's a young man that he comes to our church now and attends regularly and he sings specials a lot at our church but his name is brother Isaac Webber and he was just visiting for I think it was the first time he'd ever visited our church that night and he'd been in a car wreck I believe just a couple days before and in the car wreck he had broken his foot and he came in on crutches with a big cast on our big boot wrapped around his foot and he came in on these crutches and at the end of this watch night service we had a little prayer line and he came up for prayer and at the end of the service he laid down his crutches and he walked out of the building perfectly home amen amen [Applause] if there's a man that can do that I want you to show him to me it's not something a man that can produce I can't do that if I could I'd go down to every hospital that I could find and there would just be people coming out with broken feet healed but it wasn't me that did it it was Jesus Christ that did it we've got a sister we just read the quote Jesus said can any man by taking thought add to his stature you know could you just think real hard and say all night I'm six foot four but I'd really like to be six foot six and add to your stature we can't do it we can't do it but there was a sister that comes to our church she's from Germany originally but she moved here years ago and her and her sons come to our church her name is sister burek Huli and she for 20 years her leg one of her legs had been 2 inches shorter than the other and so she wore a lift in her shoe for 20 years we sometimes we come up and we get prayed for and if it doesn't happen like that but sometimes God doesn't like that we've seen God do that and sometimes it takes a day sometimes it takes five days sometimes it takes five years for Abraham it took 25 years for the promised son to come into view but he he looked at those things which were not as though they were and they can make fun of him and say grandpa Abraham the father of many nations where's that verse boy it's been you know 15 years where's the at he said it's more of a miracle now than it was 15 years ago they said all my he's crazy going down here and buying baby clothes at Babies R Us and here he is he's old and his wife's old here he is a hundred and his life's 90 and they didn't even have children back when they were kids yeah how is he gonna have a child now he said it's more of a miracle now than it was 20 years ago twenty four years ago by a father of many nations how you doing all my the promised sons aren't the way anytime now he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but he just kept going so this sister for 20 years she had struggled with this physical situation in her body where one leg was two inches shorter than the other and she came up at our fourth of July meetings prayer and and see we've just laid hands on her and prayed for just a simple prayer and she went back to her seat and a couple of weeks later she text messaged me said brother Nathan I want to share a testimony for 20 years I've had this two-inch lift in my shoe and I was able to take it out because my legs are exactly the same length now amen amen we still serve a God of Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not a changeable God he's an unchangeable God what he did on the shores of Galilee if he's not able to perform the same tonight then he got weaker somewhere not my god he's still able if he could if he could heal the blinded eyes back there on the sands of Galilee he can do it tonight if he could raise the dead back there and when Lazarus came forth that had been dead for days we saw him do the same thing 16 years ago in West Palm Beach and the man's still alive tonight he's still the same God sister sherry virgin a sister that goes to our church seat came up for prayer about a year ago or maybe two years ago now she had a.m. she had had some test run and her numbers showed that she was in the pre leukemia stages that hurt her bled her white and blood red cells the numbers on him had elevated to a spot to where they said she was pretty leukemia and needed to start having treatments for leukemia and she came up one Sunday morning we had prayer for and she went back for the follow-up and they said your numbers are perfectly normal Amen sister Sizemore an elderly lady at our church just a couple months of those she came up for prayer and she was going to have to have surgery on her legs because her primary arteries in her legs had become so blocked that she couldn't have she didn't have any circulation in her legs and they were gonna have to do surgery and she went in to have the surgery and they did some final testing on her right before the surgery and they found out that after prayer her collateral arteries which are normally arteries that are closed had opened up and those arteries had bypassed main arteries in her leg on their own and she had perfect circulation amen amen so God can do bypass surgeries in fact God performed the first surgery in Genesis chapter 2 there where he took from the side of Adam and he created a wife and he sealed his side back up he didn't have to use stitches he didn't have to use pain medicine there wasn't any scar he didn't have any side effects he would except he got a wife I guess that was a side effect but that was a real side effect brother Jack [Laughter] God did that perform the first surgery so he's still he's still the great physician tonight brother Joel one of my deacons brother Joel Hammond basak he had worked at a hospital for many years and and he had began to feel some pain in his leg and he thought he had a blood clot and they went for some testing and they found out it wasn't a blood clot but they diagnosed him with hepatitis B and after testing it I've got the paperwork if you'd like to see it sometime they they said anything greater than a 12-point o in this number whatever it was for hepatitis B was a positive and he his reading was a thousand point oh so he was an extreme positive and he came up for prayer on a Sunday morning and we rebuked that demon of hepatitis and prayed for him and he went back for the follow-up to see kind of how long he'd had it and how fast it was progressing and they said mr. Harun basak we cannot find any of the hepatitis B DNA in your body they said not only that but our tests show that you're immune to hepatitis V a man when God does something he does it right he doesn't do something halfway Amen if you got that picture of Olivia a harem basset show the first of the first picture Olivia harem bastard she's about my little boy Philips age she's 9 or 10 years old and and she was they took her to the chiropractor and they said that she had scoliosis if you can see here there's a 54 degree curve on her spine and her hip here where it's supposed to be straight in line with this vertebrae her hip was way off and then there's a curving here of this in this way and she was two inches shorter than they should be and they diagnosed her with scoliosis and we had prayer for and I've got the recording of the prayer still I told the church I said the x-ray shows because they just had it on a little flip phone at the time the picture so I was explaining it to the church I said the x-ray shows that our backs like this but we're gonna pray that it's going to be like that and a few months later they went for a follow-up and this is the x-ray the second one there should be another photo technology is a blessing and a curse thing amen but you you can imagine what its gonna be or I wouldn't be showing the picture Lot's wife she's pulling that up I'll go a little bit further this the same little girl her sister had had a deficiency she had an iron deficiency where her numbers were extremely low and they were gonna have to put her on supplements and things for her iron and we had prayer for her and she went back to the doctor and her numbers every follow-up visit since her iron numbers have been perfectly normal amen god knows what he's doing there should be a third one but it's okay if there's no I can show it later on this if anybody wants to see it there should be a third picture I may have it on here I can pull it up no I don't have that one on here well let's go ahead his sister Tanya for now and maybe she can pull that one up later her sister Tanya November 2016 we were here preaching and she came up for prayer and her shoulder she had arthritis and bursitis of the shoulder and she had bone fragments in the shoulder and she couldn't move her arm about any higher than this and couldn't move it back it would cause her extreme pain and she came up for prayer and that night she went home and began to iron their clothes for Sunday and when she did she was a recognized you know I could move the iron back a little further than I could and she'd begin to take her arm and move it like that and she was able to move it can you still move it like that sister Tanya praise the Lord amen God's good she came for the Labor Day meetings and she was supposed to have some treatments they had diagnosed her with cancer she had a cancer on the top of her head we we have these things back home they're called Buckeyes that it was about the size of a Buckeye on top of her head right now a hairline there and and they had said it was cancerous and they wanted to start doing treatments and so she came she said let's move it back a week I've got some meetings I'm wanting to go to and so she pushed the appointment back a week and she came for prayer and she came up at the end of the Sunday night service and we had prayer with her and so the sisters of the picture sister Tanya before and after this was about 24 hours after that the after prayer this is the before and that's the after a man God is good god is good he's still the healer she went back to the doctor and they they said we think still think you should have some treatments and she said what can you do a PET scan they said it it doesn't even show up on a PET scan that there's any cancer I said God doesn't do something 99% he does it all the way a man he does it all the way the picture of little Libya if they can't get it it's her the spine is perfectly straight now as far as the 54 degree curve her hip is in line now the sideways curb that you saw there in the first picture there was still a little bit of a curve there but her chiropractor said that the just basic treatments through him will correct that and he said he gives a hundred percent chance of a hundred percent recovery a man a man there's that there's the corrected x-ray there her back work was curved as straight her hip is straight and there's just a gradual curve that way but he said just his treatments will correct that God's good God's good before we go into the prayer line tonight I just want to read you a few things to boost your faith we've shared some testimonies that we've shared how that God is the architect of our bodies but I want to read you a few things that his word says because we have to have a foundation somewhere to place our faith and we believe that the Word of God it's infallible when he speaks something it has to be and when he speaks something he's not a respecter of person if he heals one person and this another person approaches him on the same word with the same amount of faith if he doesn't heal the other person then he's unjust but the problem is many times it's just we don't approach him with the same faith that somebody else had approached him with Isaiah chapter 53 verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed not we might be not we hope to be not we should be we are healed third John chapter one verse two says beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth so that's what brother Jack was talking about earlier you don't have to be a Christian to get healed but you have to be a Christian to get set it is to stay healed to stay healed he told the woman he didn't say you know God just loves you and you go off and do your sin he said go your way and sin no more amen mark chapter 16 verse 17 says these signs shall not a hope so now - maybe these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover hey man when somebody comes up for prayer anymore we've seen God do so much I don't wonder can't he do it I just expect a miracle a man I expect a testimony because he said they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that's a promise amen either that's the truth or it's not the truth but we've seen it confirmed too many times we know that it's the truth Amen if we can approach it on the basis of faith that God I believe your word is true and I believe that it's already a finished work at Calvary brother Nathan doesn't have to heal me brother Jack doesn't have to heal me in fact they cannot even if Jesus Christ was here in a physical body himself he couldn't heal you it's something that he already did he doesn't have to come and die for us again to save us he doesn't have to come and die for us again or take stripes for us for our healing he's already did it hey man if I came and I had a brand-new car that God had blessed me with I said brother Jack you got God just laid it on my heart to give you the keys to this car I couldn't come back a year later him say old brother Nathan could you give me the keys to the car how hard he gave him the keys to the car amen he already healed us he's already saved us you just have to accept what he did for you Saint John chapter 14 verse 12 verily verily I say to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do not I might do not I'll think about it I will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it now all these is on the basis of faith hey maybe you can get up here and just quote scripture but if you don't have faith it won't do you any good no matter how annoying that I am or how much God would give me a gift to pray for the sick or whatever it would be if you don't have the faith to receive it what good is it going to do you Amen Jesus he went into the city of Galilee in the earth into the region of Galilee into the city of Nazareth that he was from and it said the Bible says you go check your Bible and see if it doesn't say this he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief wasn't that he didn't have the power wasn't that he didn't have the faith but they didn't believe it how is he going to help somebody that didn't believe it in the first place Matthew chapter 18 verse 18 verily I say to you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done unto them he goes on to say of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them doesn't have to be a big crowd doesn't have to be great large amount of numbers wherever there's two or three in his name he's in the midst that means that he promised he'd be here tonight that means that he promised that if we would show up in his name that he would show up mark chapter 11 verse 22 Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith he's not just talking about physical go healing he's not just talking about salvation he's talking about whatever mountain is in your way maybe it's a mountain of you know a spouse that's not a believing spouse maybe it's a mountain of the backslidden child maybe it's a mountain of a job that you got fired from maybe it's a mountain of unemployment whatever the mountain is if you say to this mountain be moved and be cast into the sea and it might not happen today might not happen tomorrow but as soon as you say it and believe God's Word some of that mountain begins to fall off of the back of it might just be a teaspoonful might be a five-gallon bucket full but the mountain begins to move right then therefore I say to you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them but the Brent says this and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1958 the Word of God will defeat the devil anywhere any time or any place he will defeat the devil that's how Jesus defeated him when he was here on earth when Satan came to him and began to tempt him he said it is written it is written he could have spoke the devil out of existence with his power he could have spoken to a saint you know until I'm gone from the earth in a physical body I'm gonna confine you to Mars and just leave me alone stop driving me crazy but he didn't do it because he wanted you to know that the same way that he fought the devil you can fight the devil the same word that he used you can use it'll defeat the devil anywhere any time or any place he will defeat the devil and the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it the way God wrote it and accepted in your heart God will make that word become life st. Paul says in Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 that he's the high priest of our profession Jesus Christ is the high priest of our profession that word profession if you look it up in the Greek lexicon it's the same word it's interchangeable with confession that whatever you confess with your mouth brother Branham says and show us the father 1959 God will make your body obey your confession you go out of here and say all mine worse than I ever have you better be careful God will make your body obey your confession you say oh my I just don't think I'm going to make it brother Troy I just I just don't know if I can keep serving god there's so many temptations out of here you better watch what you confess with your mouth but you go out of here and you begin to confess I'm healed oh I may still have symptoms but they're just lying Vanity's I may still have aches and pains but it's just a lie of the devil I'm healed I'm healing it's already a finished work at Calvary God will make your body obey your confession oh my see and he's the high priest of our confession before you can be healed you have to confess it first you have to believe that you're healed and then when you believe you're healed God makes your body obey your testimony your confession rather he says again who is God 19:50 your testimony will bring you right into it going Jesus 1963 he says now right out in front of you stands a person just like he was a few minutes ago you were sit down here but there is a well person standing there in other words he's saying as you come into the prayer line you're here in a sick body but visualized at the other end of the platform that there's a well body standing there there's a sick you here at this side but there's a well you standing on that side stands the person just like he was a few minutes ago you were sick down here but there is a well person standing there Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right beyond it now you just by faith as you close your eyes walk right into that well body see then just keep on walking just keep on going Saint Paul teaches us in Acts chapter 19 verse 11 to 12 it says they took from the body of Paul because so many miracles were being wrought by him when he was laying hands on people and things they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons and laid them on the sick and when they would take these prayer cloths and things from the body of st. Paul and lay them on the city it said that diseases departed them and evil spirits went out of them James chapter 5 verse 14 says is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray for him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raised him up and if he have committed these sins they shall be forgiven him so when you healed you're forgiven too but you can't go back out and do all the same sins that you used to do leave it right here leave it right here and walk on don't sin no more but give God the glory say I'm not only healed I'm delivered I used to be bound by a nicotine demon I'm delivered of it I used to be bound by alcohol demon whatever it is drug demon lust demon whatever it is I'm free tonight I mean not only healed I'm delivered oh my that's why we believe in anointing with all and praying for the sick and laying hands on I'm anointing with all these things it's a commandment in the Word of God to do these things with the promise that the sick will be healed now it's not that there's any it's not that there's any healing quality in this oil if there was we'd get a whole bath tub and just baptize people in it it's not that there's any healing quality in my hands if we was let's go down to the hospitals and I'll just lay my hands on everybody it's not that there's even healing power in the prayer cloths that have been prayed over about 90 minute God it's not that there's healing power in the little piece of cloth if there was let's let's go down to the you know the the diseased in the sick written let's just lay that on them but it's obedience to God's Word that brings it to pass it's not my hands it's not the cloth it's not the oil it's not the prayer the words that I would say over you it's that we're obeying God's Word he said if you do this this is what's going to happen if you pray if you lay hands on them and oil with oil all these things if you do these things this is the result they shall be healed so we come in obedience to his word said God this is what you said and we're doing what you said now you come and back up your word if you can approach him with faith tonight let me tell you he will back up his word we've shared the testimonies of it we've seen it over and over again some chapter 103 verse 1 says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits there's some benefits to this who forgiveth all thine iniquities Oh but I used to do this brother Nathan oh but but last month I fell and I stumbled and I did this and Satan's beat me up over who forgiveth all thine iniquities Oh everybody say all but what about this over here what about what I did 15 years all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases what but what about cancer but what about tuberculosis what but what about diabetes what about this all all that is eases cancers no more than him than a toothache hepatitis B is no more to him than a headache he's God amen he doesn't have to sweat a little harder to heal cancer than he does a headache he's God he just speaks the word and it goes Exodus chapter 15 verse 26 of the musicians would come he says I am the Lord that healeth thee he's still that same God tonight he's a present help in times of trouble he's
