[0:01] Amen. Let's open our Bibles to Psalms
[0:03] 46.
[0:07] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[0:10] the Lord this Friday night.
[0:16] Praise the Lord. Psalms 46 reads, "God
[0:19] is our refuge and strength, a very
[0:22] present help in trouble. Therefore will
[0:25] not we fear, though the earth be
[0:28] removed, and though the mountains be
[0:30] carried into the midst of the sea,
[0:32] though the waters thereof roar and be
[0:34] troubled, though the mountains shake
[0:36] with the swelling thereof. Salah, there
[0:39] is a river, the streams whereof shall
[0:42] make glad the city of God, the holy
[0:44] place of the tabernacles of the most
[0:46] high. God is in the midst of her. She
[0:50] shall not be moved. God shall help her.
[0:52] And that right early, the heathen rage,
[0:56] the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his
[0:58] voice, the earth melted. The Lord of
[1:01] hosts is with us.
[1:04] Excuse me. The God of Jacob is our
[1:06] refuge. Salah. Come, behold the works of
[1:10] the Lord. What desolations he hath made
[1:13] in the earth. He maketh wars to cease
[1:16] until the end of the earth. He breakth
[1:18] the bow and cutth the spear and sunder.
[1:20] He burneth chariot chariot and in the
[1:23] fire. Be still and know that I am God. I
[1:27] will be be exalted among the heathen. I
[1:30] will be exalted in the earth. The Lord
[1:32] of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[1:36] our refuge. Salah. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:39] hearts.
[1:43] Almighty God, it's by your grace, Lord,
[1:45] we stand here tonight in your presence,
[1:47] Lord. Father, you watched over us all
[1:49] the day long, Lord Jesus. And you
[1:52] allowed us to come into the house of the
[1:54] Lord to worship you, Lord. And Father,
[1:56] we desire, Lord, to see you and you
[2:00] only, Lord, to hear from heaven, Lord.
[2:02] Father, we'll be careful to hear you
[2:04] when you speak, Lord. We're listening,
[2:07] Lord God, for every word you will say to
[2:08] us tonight, Lord. You know what we have
[2:10] need of, and we need more of you. So we
[2:14] pray for a fresh outpouring of the Holy
[2:16] Ghost tonight, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[2:18] have been taught, Lord. Therefore, we
[2:20] have the mechanics. We want to see the
[2:22] dynamics in the midst of us tonight,
[2:24] Lord. We're looking forward to the
[2:26] supernatural God being supernatural
[2:29] amongst us, Lord. So, Father, as we
[2:31] surrender ourselves to you, Lord, we
[2:33] pray continue to anoint the musicians,
[2:35] anoint this congregation, anoint brother
[2:38] Nathan and all of our brothers and
[2:39] sisters that'll be listening in. Lord,
[2:42] we want to be in one accord that you may
[2:44] have perfect preeminence in our midst.
[2:46] We love you, Father. We praise you and
[2:48] thank you for all things. We commit all
[2:51] things to you now in the name of Jesus
[2:52] Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen and
[2:55] amen. Amen. Let's give our God a hand
[2:58] clap of praise.
[3:03] Made a way.
[3:09] Say you
[3:11] you made a way. And we're standing here.
[3:17] And we're standing here
[3:21] only because you made
[3:25] a way.
[3:32] Standing here,
[3:37] not knowing how we'll get through this
[3:41] test.
[3:45] But holding on to faith, you know best.
[3:53] Nothing can catch you by surprise.
[3:58] You've got this figured out. You're
[4:03] watching us now.
[4:09] But when it looks as if we can't win.
[4:14] Oh,
[4:16] you wrap us in your arms and step in.
[4:24] and everything we need you.
[4:29] You got this in control. And now we know
[4:35] that you you made a way
[4:43] when our backs were against the wall
[4:47] and it looked as if it was over.
[4:51] But you you made a way
[4:58] and we're standing here
[5:02] only because you made
[5:06] a way.
[5:13] Now we're here
[5:18] looking back on where we come from
[5:25] because of you and nothing we've done
[5:32] to deserve the love and mercy you've
[5:36] shown. But you
[5:40] is strong enough to pick us up now.
[5:58] When our backs were against the wall
[6:02] and it looks as if it was over. Lord,
[6:06] you you made a way and we're standing
[6:13] here and we're standing here
[6:17] only because you made you move
[6:21] mountains.
[6:24] YOU CAUSE WALLS TO FALL WITH YOUR POWER.
[6:31] Perform miracles.
[6:35] There is nothing
[6:39] that's IMPOSSIBLE
[6:43] and we're standing here
[6:46] only because
[6:50] oh you move mountains you call walls
[6:55] with your power
[6:59] perform miracles
[7:05] There is nothing
[7:08] that's IMPOSSIBLE
[7:12] and we're standing here
[7:16] only BECAUSE
[7:19] YOU
[7:22] CALL
[7:26] in your power
[7:28] perform miracles
[7:34] and there is nothing.
[7:38] That's impossible.
[7:42] And we're standing here
[7:45] only because you made
[7:49] say you you made a way. I don't know
[7:56] how, but you did it. You made a way.
[8:02] I don't know how much you need.
[8:09] I don't know how much
[8:13] you
[8:15] don't know how

[8:33] Say I don't know why.

[8:47] Say you you made a way.
[8:55] And we're standing here
[8:58] only because of you. And we're standing
[9:02] here
[9:04] only because

[9:10] here
[9:13] only because you made
[9:17] the way.

[28:10] very very uh dear friend of mine and uh
[28:14] came and uh he's been coming for years
[28:17] you know coming um and um you know over
[28:22] uh over the years the Lord has used this
[28:25] ministry here in this area for many of
[28:27] the saints. Uh God has just answered his
[28:29] prayer for for many. And um as we were
[28:33] just I was preparing my lesson for
[28:37] Wednesday night, I um I was looking at
[28:40] my notes on on Tuesday night and and as
[28:43] I'm going through my notes, I saw this
[28:44] testimony there of something that
[28:46] happened that Brother Nathan prayed and
[28:49] my my wife had lost her telephone and we
[28:51] couldn't find it. and he prayed a prayer
[28:53] that was connected to what we were
[28:55] teaching on on Wednesday night and and
[28:58] all that kind of came back to me and I
[28:59] said, "You know what? I forgot that
[29:01] brother Nathan was coming and and um you
[29:04] know, I knew that we were having a
[29:05] service, but I just didn't put together
[29:06] to have this time where we could have a
[29:09] a prayer line. Uh and uh so uh I got
[29:12] that out to you all late and I do
[29:14] apologize for that. But I will say this
[29:17] that um uh those that were able to come
[29:20] and those were that were able to

[29:26] want to stand in for somebody else,
[29:29] that's that's that's perfectly fine as
[29:31] well. Uh I believe God honors um uh that
[29:35] type of faith as well. And uh but I
[29:37] wanted to read a a quote and and I'm
[29:39] happy to have uh Brother Phillip, it's
[29:41] Brother Nathan's oldest son, Amen. and
[29:44] with us uh tonight as well. Praise the
[29:46] Lord.

[29:52] quote, something that I was looking at
[29:53] today and um out of the Patmas vision
[29:57] and if you would just put in the
[30:00] information
[30:02] uh let me just use another illustration.
[30:08] Let me just use another illustration.
[30:12] Um, we should see this coming out of the
[30:15] Patmas vision. Um, brother Brandon makes
[30:19] a statement here
[30:22] and what he's um
[30:25] uh
[30:28] he's talking about getting into the
[30:30] spirit and uh if we were um able to, you
[30:35] know, just get into the the spirit like
[30:37] I say the first step there is getting in
[30:39] the spirit. uh if we get into the right
[30:42] channel, the right spirit, the right
[30:44] anointing,
[30:45] I want to tell you it's unlimited what
[30:47] God can do uh in our midst tonight. It's
[30:50] all in how we approach the service. Um
[30:53] you know, if if if I would have if if
[30:59] um if Brother Brandham was still uh uh
[31:02] around and I would have come on
[31:04] Wednesday night and say, "Brother
[31:05] Brandon going to be here on Friday
[31:06] night. He going to be praying for the
[31:08] sick." folk would have tried to get
[31:10] everybody
[31:11] into the house of the Lord, right? I
[31:14] mean, they would have they would have
[31:15] went through great extremes to get
[31:18] people to the house of the Lord, no
[31:19] matter what the condition was. If I
[31:21] would have said Jesus Christ himself was
[31:24] going to be here, folk would have got a
[31:28] cot and put their friends on a cot and
[31:30] brought the cot to the church. If they
[31:33] couldn't get inside the church, they
[31:35] would have towed the roof off.
[31:38] Th this is what happen when we when
[31:40] we're in the right channel, the right
[31:41] spirit, right? And uh but you know, I I
[31:45] realize sometimes, you know, things, you
[31:48] know, a little different, but we want to
[31:49] kind of approach it because God is using
[31:52] brother Nathan's ministry and he would
[31:54] use anybody here. He used my ministry
[31:56] and any of the other brother's ministry
[31:57] here uh if we all came in the right
[32:00] spirit. So, I want to just read this,
[32:03] Amen. this quote here um for you just
[32:06] before he would come and preach. I want
[32:08] you to just get yourself in the right
[32:10] spirit for God to do something tonight.
[32:12] I don't think this this service is by
[32:13] chance. I don't think it's by accident.
[32:16] Uh some of y'all been dealing with
[32:17] little things here and there for a long
[32:19] time. Tonight can be your night that
[32:20] it's over.
[32:22] Now I'm going to read the quote and the
[32:24] quote going to tell you that it's over.
[32:25] Watch this. Says, let me just uh use
[32:28] another illustration. Suppose you need
[32:30] healing.
[32:32] says, "What does the word say?" Well, we
[32:35] have all read it countless times, but
[32:37] did not get in the spirit when reading
[32:40] it. Did we ask God for his spirit to
[32:44] teach us the real truth of it? If we
[32:47] did, we would call the elders,
[32:51] confess our sins, be anointed and prayed
[32:55] for, and that would be that. All right.
[32:59] So he says we would call the elders. And
[33:01] that's what the scripture say. If
[33:02] anyone's sick among you, let him call
[33:04] for the elders of the church. Actually,
[33:05] we stop doing that. We don't even call
[33:08] anymore. But you call and you ask for
[33:11] prayer. The other thing says that you're
[33:13] supposed to do is be anointed with oil.
[33:15] The prayer of faith would save the sick.
[33:17] They shall pray the prayer of faith. And
[33:18] the prayer of faith would save the sick.
[33:20] And the Bible says that they shall
[33:21] recover. Right? This is what this is the
[33:23] scripture. He says, "But we got to get
[33:25] into the spirit of what the word is
[33:27] saying to us if we want to see the
[33:28] results of what God promised to us." He
[33:31] says, "If we did, we would call the
[33:33] elders, confess our sins, be anointed,
[33:35] and prayed for, and that would be that."
[33:38] He says it might not come immediately,
[33:44] but in his spirit,
[33:46] it is all
[33:49] over.
[33:51] I'm telling you, if we would come
[33:53] tonight and accept this, I don't care
[33:57] what it is. After tonight, you can
[34:01] declare it is over.
[34:04] It is over.
[34:06] It is over.
[34:09] Hallelujah to the lamb of God. And and
[34:12] and I'm I'm declaring it. And when you
[34:13] if you're standing on behalf of somebody
[34:15] else, stand with that promise that it is
[34:17] over. After you come through that prayer
[34:18] line, it is over. No matter what the
[34:21] doctors say, right? No matter what
[34:23] report you hear, it is over. You must
[34:26] declare that. You must decree that out
[34:28] of your own mouth. We brother brother
[34:30] Solomon had sent a quote out uh early
[34:32] today and and and I I don't um it was
[34:36] just some something where brother
[34:37] Brandon was saying sometimes your back
[34:38] is against the wall and and and what God
[34:41] is expecting you to do when that happens
[34:42] is you to open your mouth and begin to
[34:44] speak speak your way out of what you're
[34:46] in.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? Speak your way out
[34:52] of what you're in
[34:54] cuz you have that type of power inside
[34:56] of you. Right. My demons move at what
[35:00] you say. Just like they moved at what
[35:02] Jesus said, demons move at what you say.
[35:05] And sometime God have to let a little
[35:07] tension come so you can exercise your
[35:10] authority as a son and as a daughter of
[35:13] God. Amen. So tonight I'm I'm I'm under
[35:16] expectation that God is going to meet us
[35:18] here. Uh and uh when when it's time for
[35:22] uh the prayer line uh to happen, we'll
[35:25] have everyone coming down this right
[35:26] aisle. um the the deacons will anoint
[35:29] you and then we'll have you pass through
[35:31] and um and and and you know just come
[35:35] expecting to receive be in the spirit as
[35:37] you come and you know I think the rest
[35:39] of that quote
[35:41] uh there was some other instructions
[35:43] that he said here
[35:46] uh
[35:50] okay yeah let's let me finish reading
[35:51] this says it might not come immediately
[35:53] but in his spirit it is all over there's
[35:55] no other court of appeal
[35:57] God will fulfill his word. He says, "Oh,
[36:00] we need to get in the spirit and and
[36:02] then things will be done." Don't go
[36:04] through the acts first.
[36:07] Get in the spirit and then go through
[36:10] the acts and watch what God will do. So,
[36:15] don't go through the acts first. That's
[36:17] not getting you in the spirit, but
[36:18] really get in the Lord, this is what you
[36:19] promise. I'm coming according to your
[36:21] word. You say they will lay hands on the
[36:22] sick and they shall recover, God. And
[36:25] I'm coming according to what you said.
[36:27] And if you come with that type of
[36:28] attitude, it's over. It is over. Praise
[36:33] God. Let's stand. Amen. And let's uh
[36:36] prepare our hearts to receive
[36:39] uh God's servant tonight as he would
[36:41] come. Amen. In his own way. Amen.
[36:48] I once was
[36:51] lost.
[36:52] Oh, but now
[36:57] I'm found. Oh, was blind,
[37:02] but
[37:04] now
[37:06] I see.
[37:10] Come on, everybody sing an amazing
[37:12] grace. Amazing
[37:17] grace, how sweet
[37:33] like me.
[37:38] Oh, I once
[37:43] I was lost.
[37:46] Oh, but now
[37:49] I'm found.
[37:52] Oh, I was blind,
[37:56] but now, oh, thank God I'm free.
[38:01] Let's sing it this way together. Praise
[38:04] God. Oh, praise God.
[38:09] Praise God.
[38:12] Praise God.
[38:15] Oh, praise God.
[38:18] Oh, praise God.
[38:22] Praise God.
[38:25] Praise God.
[38:31] Oh, praise God.
[38:35] Praise God.
[38:38] Oh, praise God.
[38:41] Praise God.
[38:44] Oh, praise God.
[38:48] Praise God.
[38:51] Praise God.
[38:56] Amen. And amen. He's worthy of our
[38:58] praise. Praise the Lord.
[39:02] Amen. Thank you, musicians. God bless
[39:06] you. Psalm 107, if you want to go ahead
[39:08] and turn to it. You pray for my voice
[39:11] tonight. As you can tell, the enemy has
[39:14] been fighting with that all day. But
[39:16] boovil,
[39:18] &gt;&gt; amen. I already told brother Jimmy on
[39:21] the way in, but brother Troy, my dad
[39:23] sends his greetings and he said he's
[39:25] having a hard time eating all that food
[39:27] at Hubers by himself, so he needs you to
[39:29] come help him.
[39:31] Amen. Good to be in church tonight.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly appreciate Spirit and
[39:38] Truth Tabernacle and we have uh as
[39:41] brother Jack said, it's been a long
[39:43] time. I did my math wrong. He was at our
[39:46] church here not too long ago and I did
[39:48] my math wrong on it. I had the right
[39:49] year but I did the wrong math. But 2001
[39:53] is when I met brother Jack and uh we
[39:56] came in the brother west goes there and
[39:58] he was leading songs and brother Trevor
[40:00] and I got to meet him and got his email
[40:02] address and we started fellowshipping
[40:04] and sending quotes back and forth to one
[40:07] another and he came out of a very
[40:09] different background than me and brother
[40:11] Trevor came out of a very different
[40:13] background than us and and yet we we
[40:15] kept fellowshipping around the word and
[40:17] said you see this the same way. Praise
[40:19] praise the Lord. And so it was a just a
[40:22] wonderful fellowship that way, getting
[40:23] to know each other. And then uh he
[40:26] started having us in to preach for him
[40:28] and then he'd take us around to
[40:29] different different places when brother
[40:32] Trevor and I were just young
[40:33] evangelists. And so we've appreciated
[40:35] his support over the years. Brother Jack
[40:38] has dedicated multiple church buildings
[40:40] for us and and he's he's loaned us an
[40:43] organ player for a while now. and he's
[40:46] been we we we uh brought an organ all
[40:50] the way to Florida for him one time and
[40:52] so amen. It's good good that brothers
[40:55] dwell together in unity. So we've
[40:57] certainly appreciated our brother and
[41:00] and love him and and the whole Duff
[41:03] family and all of you that we've got to
[41:04] know and my is glad to come in here
[41:07] brother Solomon singing. I love the gift
[41:09] that that the Lord has given him. And
[41:11] &gt;&gt; so it's just we're we're thankful for
[41:13] good friends and I know many of you have
[41:15] traveled many miles over the years
[41:17] coming to our meetings and things and we
[41:19] we always enjoy seeing everyone and and
[41:22] certainly good to be with you again.
[41:24] It's an honor and a privilege.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Psalm 107 and verse 20. He sent his word
[41:33] &gt;&gt; and healed them.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And delivered them from their
[41:36] destructions.
[41:38] Oh, that men would praise the Lord for
[41:41] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[41:45] to the children of men.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe God still moves like
[41:49] that.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; He sent his word and healed them.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I've seen in my own
[41:56] ministry over the years, one time right
[41:58] here in West Palm Beach and several
[41:59] times at our church back home, not even
[42:02] lay hands on somebody, not even pray for
[42:05] them, just be reading scriptures and
[42:07] quotes about healing and somebody be
[42:10] healed in the building instantly.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent his word and healed them.
[42:15] And so we believe that there's still
[42:17] healing power in the name of Jesus. And
[42:20] that if you can just anchor your faith
[42:22] in the word.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we're going to have a prayer
[42:25] line tonight, Lord will. And but I
[42:26] believe you can be healed before the
[42:28] prayer line even happens.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Lord
[42:33] Jesus, truly, Lord, it's it's an honor
[42:36] to be back in West Palm Beach again with
[42:39] brothers and sisters of like precious
[42:40] faith. Lord, how many fond memories that
[42:44] we have over the years being here and
[42:46] brother Jack and the different believers
[42:48] coming our way. Lord, we we love them
[42:51] and we we thank you for their
[42:53] fellowship. And Lord, so many
[42:56] testimonies and memories that we could
[42:58] share is would take up more than a
[43:00] service just in that. And we're thankful
[43:02] for it, Lord. We're thankful, Lord, many
[43:06] times. times that we've laughed
[43:07] together, times that we've cried
[43:09] together, times that we've worshiped the
[43:11] Lord together. Lord, we're just
[43:13] thankful, Lord, for friends like this.
[43:16] And I thank you for this atmosphere,
[43:18] Lord, for your presence. Lord, I pray
[43:20] that you'd be with us tonight, Lord. And
[43:22] just take complete control of the
[43:24] service, Lord. Help me to get myself out
[43:27] of the way so that you could speak
[43:28] whatever it would be that you would have
[43:30] me to say, Father. And Lord, we just
[43:33] commit the service into your hands for
[43:36] your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:38] Christ. Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated
[43:41] tonight. And I would just ask uh my
[43:45] sister-in-law from Delaware had text me
[43:48] um before the service actually on our
[43:51] drive here and had had requested that we
[43:53] remember their granddaughter in prayer.
[43:55] My brother Allan and my sister-in-law
[43:58] Denise up in Delaware. They have a
[43:59] little granddaughter named Payton. and
[44:02] she uh she was born uh with some of the
[44:06] enzymes that produce your muscles and
[44:09] muscle strength and things. She was very
[44:11] very lacking in those. And so she's had
[44:14] to have enzyme injections and surgeries
[44:16] and different things. And they just did
[44:18] a surgery here a few months ago that
[44:20] they were expecting to really help
[44:22] improve her walking and things, but
[44:24] instead it's actually set her back a
[44:25] little with her walking to where she's
[44:27] having a hard time walking unassisted.
[44:30] And so they just requested that I'd ask
[44:32] the church um while we were here for you
[44:34] all to be praying for her as well. And
[44:37] my my I know I hope you can suffer
[44:39] through with my voice tonight. It's uh
[44:41] if you'd have heard it this morning, it
[44:43] sounds really good compared to what it
[44:44] was this morning. So thank the Lord for
[44:46] that. And I didn't know how we were
[44:49] going to make it through tonight for
[44:50] sure. But the Lord is faithful.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's He's never let me down. I've
[44:55] let him down many times, but he has
[44:57] never let me down. And I'm thankful for
[44:59] that. We want to look at this thought
[45:01] for just a little while tonight. And
[45:03] with the prayer line, uh Lord willing,
[45:05] at the end, we'll try to keep it just a
[45:06] little shorter than normal. Um that's
[45:09] not a promise, that's an attempt. But uh
[45:12] we want to look at this thought of the
[45:14] simplicity of divine healing. And I got
[45:18] that from a quote. We I was looking at
[45:20] this thought of simplicity uh with the
[45:23] church back home for several weeks. And
[45:25] and we went into this as well. And I
[45:27] when I was looking at this thought of
[45:29] simplicity, I I picked up this quote in
[45:32] at thy word Lord in 1954. Brother Bam
[45:35] says, "The simplicity of divine healing
[45:38] is such a simple thing." The simplicity
[45:43] of divine healing is such a simple
[45:46] thing. And uh in this thought of
[45:48] simplicity as I was talking to the
[45:50] church back home, I I was thinking along
[45:53] these lines that I as pastors, you know,
[45:56] we get questions from people and we're
[45:59] always open to that and and brother Jack
[46:02] no doubt gets many as well and and as
[46:04] you know, he's traveled all around the
[46:07] world at this point and you make
[46:09] connections overseas and other states
[46:12] and countries and and so sometimes not
[46:15] even from our own congregations, But
[46:16] we'll get questions from people in
[46:19] Canada or India or different places and
[46:21] and and so uh we're always open to try
[46:24] to help with a question. But I find that
[46:27] a lot of the questions that get asked
[46:30] really as far as along as we are as
[46:33] message believers, they shouldn't even
[46:34] be questions that are being asked
[46:36] anymore. And I think part of that is
[46:38] sometimes it's the lack of teaching that
[46:41] you go other places and and people, you
[46:43] know, recognize, well, this this
[46:45] brother's solid in the word and and so
[46:47] they ask a question, you think, how have
[46:49] they never heard these things before?
[46:50] Other times it's not on the ministry,
[46:53] but maybe they're sitting right under a
[46:54] really good solid minister, but they're
[46:57] not they're not listening
[46:59] and they're, you know, checking Facebook
[47:01] or checking their stock prices or
[47:03] checking their uh social media or
[47:06] whatever it be uh in the service instead
[47:08] of really entering in and seeing what
[47:11] the Lord would have for them. And so
[47:13] then they ask a question, you think, I
[47:14] know I know they've said under things
[47:16] and heard I I I get questions from my
[47:18] own congregation. And I think I I
[47:20] preached five services on this last year
[47:22] and I know you were at some of them, but
[47:24] people sometimes aren't paying
[47:25] attention. And sometimes that's just the
[47:27] enemy. Sometimes it's not intentional.
[47:30] Sometimes they've got something going on
[47:31] at work or at at school or something and
[47:34] they're trying to enter into the service
[47:35] and the devil's just bombarding their
[47:37] mind. Oh, but you've got this meeting
[47:39] tomorrow or you've got this test
[47:41] tomorrow or you got this or you got
[47:43] that. And so many times uh we we fail to
[47:47] really catch what is being done at the
[47:49] service the word that's going forth and
[47:51] the atmosphere and things because the
[47:53] devil tries to get us so distracted and
[47:55] our attention spans anymore sadly you
[47:58] know people go they they don't want to
[48:00] watch them uh you know used to you'd
[48:02] have to preach on people for watching
[48:03] movies all the time anymore they they
[48:05] don't have the attention span hardly to
[48:06] watch a movie that they're watching
[48:09] shorts on YouTube 10-second shorts and
[48:11] on to the next one I'm bored with this
[48:13] one it's been 9 seconds let's move on to
[48:16] the next one and then we expect to
[48:18] preach for 50 minutes or an hour or an
[48:21] hour and 30 minutes or however long you
[48:23] know the brother preaches and the people
[48:25] to receive it and sometimes people's
[48:27] attention spans is just difficult. So, I
[48:29] was preaching Sunday morning and I
[48:32] looked out and I saw, you know, you'll
[48:33] have people fall asleep in church and
[48:35] sometimes it's somebody elderly that's
[48:37] struggling with that or sometimes it's
[48:39] somebody that has a medical condition
[48:40] that they're struggling with it or
[48:42] sometimes it's because they stayed up
[48:43] till 4 in the morning on their phone and
[48:45] and they didn't sleep good before
[48:47] service that night and and so, you know,
[48:49] we'll have people not off. But I looked
[48:51] out on the congregation Sunday morning,
[48:53] there was about five people asleep
[48:55] simultaneously.
[48:57] And I'd never seen that before. I've
[48:59] seen maybe two people asleep at the same
[49:00] time, but five people that I saw, you
[49:03] know, just asleep. And so I said,
[49:04] "Goodness, I'm gonna have to do
[49:06] something different this morning. I'm
[49:07] going have to run down the aisles or
[49:08] something to get your attention." And
[49:11] then when I said that, everybody, you
[49:12] know, oh, they were they were they were
[49:14] awake then the rest of the service
[49:15] trying to
[49:17] So, uh, you see different things that
[49:20] people face. But I I wonder many times
[49:23] if the reason why some of these
[49:26] questions are asked is because we've
[49:28] taken something that should have been so
[49:30] simple and over complicated it. And when
[49:34] you see that, I'm going to read you a
[49:36] quote. Well, let me just skip ahead a
[49:38] little bit here. And I want to go ahead
[49:39] and read that quote right now if I can
[49:41] find it. Brother Benham says um he makes
[49:45] this statement. He's he's in a prayer in
[49:48] Revelation book of symbols in 1956 and
[49:50] he says, "God, may we never never be
[49:55] guilty of making the gospel so
[49:57] complicated to people that they think it
[50:00] was a man instead of God." In other
[50:03] words, let's not make it so complicated
[50:05] that people look and say, "Oh my, what a
[50:07] great teacher brother so and so is or
[50:09] what a you what a deep preacher brother
[50:12] so and so is or whatever." And many
[50:14] times when we do that and you see I I
[50:16] was talking with brother Danny Steman. I
[50:18] had preached for him Wednesday night on
[50:19] the way here and we got a chance to go
[50:22] to lunch on Thursday and I was talking
[50:24] to him and we were talking about some of
[50:26] the different things that rise up that
[50:28] are just absolutely cultish but they
[50:30] rise up in the name of the message or
[50:33] associated with the message. And it's
[50:35] not we don't just see it here in the
[50:37] States. You see it in Africa. You see it
[50:38] in Trinidad. You see it in India. You
[50:41] see it in Canada. You see it in South
[50:43] America and somebody will raise up uh
[50:46] some personality or somebody that has an
[50:48] ID or whatever it be. And they form
[50:51] these little personality cults and then
[50:54] they think they're somebody and they
[50:55] have to have something a little
[50:57] different than everybody else to get
[50:59] their attention. You hear brothers make
[51:01] statements like, "Oh, nobody teaches
[51:02] this the way that I teach it." And I
[51:05] that scares me a little bit because if
[51:08] nobody else is teaching it that way,
[51:10] well, the word hasn't changed in a long
[51:12] time and God is still the same
[51:14] yesterday, today, and forever. So if God
[51:16] is not quickening it to anybody else,
[51:19] then it may be somebody that's quickened
[51:21] it to you besides God.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Uh you may have Eve's interpreter trying
[51:26] to give you some type of explanation.
[51:29] and and people I've seen it. You know,
[51:31] we have the purest word that has been
[51:34] since St. Paul and the Lord Jesus were
[51:36] here on the face of the earth. And then
[51:38] because of denomination and tradition
[51:41] and creeds, the word got watered down
[51:43] for 2,000 years. And then we had a great
[51:47] restoration in this age, the most purest
[51:50] word that we could imagine. and that
[51:52] brought us out of our traditions that
[51:55] brought us out of our denominational
[51:57] creeds and man's ideas and traditions
[52:00] and and and brought us back to the
[52:03] authority of the word and a resurrected
[52:05] Lord Jesus, not a God of the past, but a
[52:08] present tense Lord Jesus. The message
[52:11] lifted him up out of history and proved
[52:14] that he wasn't just back there on the
[52:15] shores of Galilee, but that God is still
[52:18] present tense today. And then to go from
[52:20] that and and to have that type of
[52:23] restoration and then for us to just try
[52:26] to take it back into something got to
[52:27] have something extracurricular to try to
[52:30] be different and try to bind the people
[52:33] back to some man's idea or some man's
[52:35] opinion or some tradition. It's
[52:37] heartbreaking, friends. And you see it
[52:40] and you see people fall for that hook,
[52:42] line, and sinker when we have a pure
[52:45] word in its simplicity. And then people
[52:47] come up with all kinds of ideas and all
[52:49] kinds of conclusions and try to tell you
[52:51] you can be a message believer and be a
[52:53] polygamist or you can be a a message
[52:56] believer and do all this and do all
[52:58] that. Or or that that to be a message
[53:00] believer, you've got to do this, this,
[53:02] and this. And to have the Holy Ghost,
[53:04] you have to sit under their ministry.
[53:06] and you have to come through this and
[53:08] you have to do this and you have to meet
[53:10] their 10 steps of whatever their
[53:12] expectations are. But the Bible says if
[53:15] you want to receive the Holy Ghost,
[53:17] repent and be baptized in the name of
[53:19] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[53:22] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[53:24] the Holy Ghost. So when somebody says,
[53:26] "Well, if you aren't affiliated with us
[53:28] or you don't go to our church or you
[53:30] don't sit under our ministry or you
[53:31] don't see this doctrine the same way we
[53:33] do, then you're not bride." Well, that's
[53:36] just a fear tactic.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; They want you to be afraid that if you
[53:39] don't do what they're doing, then you
[53:41] may just not be bright. And I've seen
[53:43] people even just recently fall away to
[53:45] things like that because in the world
[53:47] they call it FOMO, fear of missing out.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; And there's people that are so afraid if
[53:53] I don't do what brother so and so says
[53:55] or I don't attend this church or I don't
[53:58] believe this doctrine, then so and so
[54:00] said I can't be bribed. Well, um, you
[54:03] know, not just so and so, but the Lord
[54:05] Jesus said the elect cannot be deceived.
[54:09] Amen. And he also said the Bible said
[54:12] that how to be saved, how to receive the
[54:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And so when
[54:17] somebody comes to me and says, "You got
[54:18] to do it some other way." I think
[54:20] something's wrong with the formula.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; They're adding something to the formula.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; It won't come out the right way.
[54:31] And so we want to keep it the way that
[54:33] it was in the simplicity of it.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; God's a present help in time of trouble.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're all right, brother. I was
[54:58] just going to lay him.
[55:00] Now
[55:02] the simplicity
[55:04] of divine healing is such a simple
[55:07] thing.
[55:09] Many of the things in the word are so
[55:12] simple and then people over complicate
[55:15] it to where I get questions not just
[55:19] randomly but over and over youth camps,
[55:22] family camps, our own church.
[55:25] I get questions like, "Brother Nathan,
[55:28] how do I know that I have the Holy
[55:29] Ghost? How do I know that I've been
[55:32] saved? Brother Nathan, what about this
[55:35] doctrine over here? What about that?"
[55:37] And it's because people have tried to
[55:39] over complicate the simplicity of the
[55:43] word.
[55:45] Uh, you know, if we take it back to
[55:48] salvation, you know, Billy Graham had a
[55:51] a very good program on just getting
[55:54] people to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[55:55] getting them saved. Very simple.
[55:58] Accepting what the Lord Jesus did for
[56:01] you on Calvary, accepting the the paid
[56:05] sacrifice that his blood is sufficient
[56:08] for you. It's the same for healing.
[56:11] Brother Brandham said, it's a dual
[56:12] atonement. healing and salvation that
[56:15] the blood of Jesus Christ paid for that
[56:18] 2,000 years ago. Your healing is already
[56:21] paid for. You don't have to be good
[56:23] enough. You don't have to be right
[56:25] enough. You don't have to be smart
[56:27] enough. None of those things. It is a
[56:29] paid work at Calvary.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; There was nothing you could do to save
[56:34] yourself. That's why you needed the
[56:36] blood of Jesus.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; So, somebody said, "Well, if I could
[56:38] just be good enough, you can't be."
[56:42] Brother Bram said he was talking to
[56:44] brother Charlie Cox's dad. Brother Brham
[56:46] called him Papa Cox and he said, "Papa,"
[56:49] he said, "why don't you come down and
[56:50] get baptized." He said, "Oh, Brother
[56:52] Brandham, I would if I could just be
[56:54] good enough." And brother Brandham said,
[56:55] "If you can find where you can go to get
[56:57] good enough, you let me know because I
[57:00] need it, too."
[57:00] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; No way we could be good enough. And he
[57:03] said, "Brother Brother Charlie's dad
[57:05] there, he was still smoking cigarettes."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Wow. and he came down and baptized him.
[57:10] And he said a lot of people gave him
[57:11] grief about it because he said, "Here he
[57:13] is still smoking cigarettes and getting
[57:15] baptized." He said, "You get baptized
[57:17] and the cigarettes will take care of
[57:18] themselves."
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And so he baptizes this man and the man
[57:23] begins to get sick and he's in the
[57:25] hospital and somebody goes and gets him
[57:27] a pack of cigarettes and brings them to
[57:28] him and he said, "Don't bring me no
[57:30] more. I don't want it anymore." And the
[57:31] Lord just took it from him.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we get the cart before the
[57:36] horse. The Philippian jailer said, "Men
[57:39] and brethren, what can we do to be
[57:41] saved?" And brother Bam said, "We would
[57:42] have told him, don't do this, don't do
[57:44] that, don't do this, don't do that." And
[57:46] he said, "That's not what Paul did. He
[57:47] told him what to do." And he knew if he
[57:50] did what he was supposed to do, then the
[57:52] things that he wasn't supposed to do
[57:53] would take care of themselves.
[57:57] Yet I wonder many times around the
[57:58] message and I I I see it especially in
[58:00] our young people. It becomes a burden
[58:04] and and we're a little off topic but yet
[58:06] we're not totally off topic.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Uh it becomes a burden to the young
[58:10] people because we look at our young
[58:12] people who have grown up in the message
[58:15] but maybe haven't had a real experience
[58:17] with the Lord Jesus yet. they haven't
[58:18] been filled with the Holy Ghost. And we
[58:21] look at them
[58:22] and we expect them to act like they have
[58:25] the Holy Ghost
[58:27] &gt;&gt; when they don't have the Holy Ghost yet.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we make little
[58:31] Pharisees out of them. That's right.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And not only our children, but sometimes
[58:36] new converts, they come in and we want
[58:38] to tell them, "If you'll just stop
[58:40] cutting your hair and if you'll just
[58:41] stop wearing pants and you'll just stop
[58:43] smoking your cigarettes and you'll just
[58:45] stop painting your nails and you'll just
[58:47] stop wearing your shorts and you just
[58:49] stop take those earrings out." And we
[58:51] tell them all these things and we give
[58:52] them the scriptures for it. And many
[58:54] times they do an outward work, which is
[58:57] that's nice, but they do an outward work
[58:59] before there's been any inward work.
[59:04] And then we wonder why a year later we
[59:06] find them back in the world.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Because they got tired of pretending
[59:14] &gt;&gt; because brother said a Pharisee meant an
[59:16] actor
[59:17] &gt;&gt; to act that you're something that you're
[59:19] not.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And I believe we should do all those
[59:22] things. I think if somebody comes in has
[59:24] a question, I see the sisters wearing
[59:25] these long dresses. Why are they wearing
[59:27] those? I think we should take a
[59:28] scripture and show them to them. But if
[59:30] we just beat them over the head with the
[59:32] word when they first come in, uh then
[59:34] first of all, if we even convince them
[59:36] that that's right, we're just convincing
[59:38] them intellectually. And people I found
[59:41] in in the 14 years that I've been
[59:44] ministering, I found that pe most
[59:47] people, the vast majority of people are
[59:49] not stupid.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Now, there's some people that, you know,
[59:54] we just we don't even need to go there.
[59:56] There was a small percentage of people,
[59:58] they're just they're just stupid. But
[1:00:00] the vast majority of people are not
[1:00:02] stupid.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And many times we insult their
[1:00:04] intelligence by acting like they're
[1:00:06] stupid.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Right, brother?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; But somebody will come into a church
[1:00:09] like this and they can look around and
[1:00:11] see pretty quickly how you believe.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; They can see how the sisters dress.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; They can see how the brothers dress and
[1:00:18] cons and conduct themselves. They can
[1:00:21] see how you treat one another and how
[1:00:23] you have church order, which in this day
[1:00:25] and age is my what a what a miracle that
[1:00:27] that is. And they see what you're
[1:00:29] emphasizing on. They see, brother Jack,
[1:00:31] get up and refer to a prophet of God and
[1:00:34] read quotes and read scriptures and talk
[1:00:36] about the right way to baptize. They
[1:00:38] don't have to be here very long until
[1:00:39] they know, hey, I I see what they're
[1:00:41] saying.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to push it down
[1:00:43] their throat. And then if there's
[1:00:44] something that's hungering in there,
[1:00:46] then that will raise up in there and
[1:00:48] they'll say, "I I want more of this."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; And they'll begin to ask you, "What
[1:00:52] about this? What about that?" You've
[1:00:54] seen them come in like that. And when
[1:00:56] they do, then that is an inward work
[1:00:58] that will produce itself on the outside.
[1:01:01] But what we don't want is just to get
[1:01:04] educated Pharisees
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; and just, you know, they look like a
[1:01:08] believer on the outside, but on the
[1:01:10] inside they're still doubters and they
[1:01:12] still want to do all the other things
[1:01:13] that they used to do. And and and so I
[1:01:16] believe that we need to create an
[1:01:18] atmosphere as believers to where it does
[1:01:22] it isn't so deep. Now, I know sometimes
[1:01:24] we we have we teach on things that
[1:01:26] sometimes it's good to go back through
[1:01:28] and talk about the seals and things like
[1:01:30] that, but I believe, you know, at our
[1:01:32] church, I I've tried to tell our
[1:01:34] brothers, look, if you plow so deep that
[1:01:36] you've got to be in the message for 40
[1:01:38] years and have a, you know, 701 degree
[1:01:41] in message theology to understand what
[1:01:43] you're saying, you're going to lose most
[1:01:45] of the people. I had a brother preach
[1:01:47] here a while back for me and even some
[1:01:49] of our minister brothers came to me
[1:01:50] after service and said, "What was he
[1:01:52] saying?
[1:01:55] cuz he tried to preach so deep. Well, if
[1:01:57] our minister brothers aren't catching
[1:01:58] it, I guarantee you 98% of the rest of
[1:02:01] the congregation isn't catching it. So,
[1:02:03] what good did it do? Made him look like
[1:02:05] he must be real deep. He must be real
[1:02:07] smart. But what good did it do? What did
[1:02:10] it help? And I found, you go back and
[1:02:12] listen to tapes. I've been listening to
[1:02:14] tapes as far back as I can remember. 3,
[1:02:16] four years old. I remember as a little
[1:02:18] boy uh 8 years old, 9 years old, I would
[1:02:22] take my allowance that my dad was giving
[1:02:24] me. Dad didn't want me to go to to a
[1:02:26] public school or a private school. I I
[1:02:28] was the baby by far and he was very
[1:02:31] protective of me and mom had taken me to
[1:02:32] this Christian school and we kind of did
[1:02:35] an interview there and she liked the
[1:02:36] curriculum and and liked the people and
[1:02:38] she wanted to put me in that school and
[1:02:40] dad didn't want me to go there and mom
[1:02:42] looked at the curriculum and it was
[1:02:43] actually a homeschool curriculum they
[1:02:45] were using. She said, "I think I could
[1:02:46] do that." And so I wanted to go and be
[1:02:49] with young people and things like that.
[1:02:50] He said, "Look, if you" This was in
[1:02:52] 1987, I guess. He said, "If if you'll
[1:02:55] stay home and let mom homeschool you,
[1:02:57] I'll give you $10 allowance a week."
[1:03:00] Well, had I known what I know now, I
[1:03:03] would have negotiated up
[1:03:06] because that Christian school was a lot
[1:03:08] more expensive than her buying the
[1:03:10] curriculum and doing it at home.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But in 1987, none of my
[1:03:15] friends had a $10 allowance a week. So I
[1:03:18] said, "All right."
[1:03:22] And so I had that allowance. And
[1:03:23] sometimes I'd go down, I'd buy something
[1:03:25] at the store. I I'd go down I I like
[1:03:27] Michael Jordan at the time. I'd go down
[1:03:29] and we had a we had a uh oh, it was a
[1:03:32] Ben Franklin store. And you could buy
[1:03:34] the cards in the packages or they'd have
[1:03:36] some of the special edition cards
[1:03:37] already out of the package and put in
[1:03:39] little protective cases and you could
[1:03:41] buy them for more. I go down and spend
[1:03:43] my allowance on that sometimes and
[1:03:44] different things and I've still got a
[1:03:46] lot of Michael Jordan cards that I'm
[1:03:48] hoping are going to be worth a lot of
[1:03:49] money someday. But they're still sitting
[1:03:51] in my shed stacked up in little
[1:03:52] protective cases and and uh not that I
[1:03:56] want anything to happen to him, but I
[1:03:57] just hope they're worth something
[1:03:58] someday.
[1:04:01] And so,
[1:04:03] but sometimes I'd take that allowance
[1:04:05] and about nine miles from our house was
[1:04:07] Voice of God Recordings. And we'd go
[1:04:09] down there and at the time I didn't know
[1:04:11] it was going to be my wife's
[1:04:12] grandmother, but but my wife's
[1:04:14] grandmother, sister Dodd, she was the
[1:04:16] secretary at the desk there. And when
[1:04:18] you'd come in the building, her desk was
[1:04:20] on the left there, and there was a
[1:04:21] hallway and a staircase, the old voice
[1:04:23] of God there, and and the quadrangle
[1:04:25] years ago. And then to the right, they
[1:04:27] had this big open room. And around the
[1:04:29] room they had these big metal drawers.
[1:04:31] Were you ever there back then, Brother
[1:04:32] Jack, when it was like that? And you'd
[1:04:34] go over and they had them 47 started
[1:04:36] over here in the left corner and it
[1:04:37] wrapped all the way around these
[1:04:38] drawers. You'd pull out these big metal
[1:04:40] drawers and they had cassette tapes in
[1:04:42] there. And I remember going and pulling
[1:04:44] out those drawers and sometimes I'd have
[1:04:45] to stand on my tiptoes to peek in the
[1:04:47] taller ones and picking out some of the
[1:04:49] cassette tapes and going over there and
[1:04:52] laying them down and buying them with my
[1:04:53] own allowance. And I want to say it was
[1:04:55] a good investment.
[1:04:57] It was a good investment because I still
[1:05:00] remember some of the tapes we I played
[1:05:02] here at the church recently. Uh Word
[1:05:04] Made Flesh India Trip report and I
[1:05:06] remember that tape specifically and
[1:05:09] Jubilee Year and One in a Million and a
[1:05:12] few of those cassette tapes. I remember
[1:05:13] picking out and buying with my own
[1:05:15] allowance money and I listened to them
[1:05:17] and I listened to them and you know what
[1:05:19] the Bible said? Raise up a child in the
[1:05:21] way it'll go and it won't depart from
[1:05:23] it. And so even as a 8-year-old boy or
[1:05:27] 5year-old boy or whatever it be, I
[1:05:29] remember hearing things, hearing quotes,
[1:05:31] hearing and I wasn't understanding it
[1:05:33] all and I wasn't retaining it all, but I
[1:05:35] was retaining some of it and I was
[1:05:38] understanding some of it. And so I I
[1:05:40] remember that and and I I think back and
[1:05:42] I realize the way brother Brandon
[1:05:44] presented things, he had a seventh grade
[1:05:46] education. The way that he presented
[1:05:49] things was so simple that uh you know a
[1:05:52] a a grade schooler could receive it and
[1:05:55] understand it and we could grasp it. And
[1:05:58] he would talk about you know he he would
[1:06:00] talk about great deep things like the
[1:06:02] Godhead and a seven-year-old could sit
[1:06:04] there and say that makes sense because
[1:06:07] he was bringing it in a simple way.
[1:06:10] Jesus when Jesus had his ministry here
[1:06:12] for three and a half years you know what
[1:06:14] it said it didn't say kphosis and all
[1:06:17] the theological society said oh we love
[1:06:19] your preaching it said the common people
[1:06:22] heard him go
[1:06:27] simple way that the people could
[1:06:29] understand and not go over their heads
[1:06:31] and so I'm afraid many times we over
[1:06:34] complicate the word and sometimes we use
[1:06:37] great terminology and things and people
[1:06:39] sit there and scratch their head and
[1:06:40] don't even know what we're talking about
[1:06:42] when it's the simplicity that really is
[1:06:45] is what catches our attention and really
[1:06:47] sticks with us. Brother Beam says in God
[1:06:49] hiding himself in simplicity in 1963, we
[1:06:52] stumble over simplicity. That's how we
[1:06:56] miss God is by stumbling over
[1:06:58] simplicity. Now, I don't know how
[1:07:01] Brother Jack and the other minister
[1:07:02] brothers are, but for me, uh, you know,
[1:07:05] sometimes you'll get a sermon that the
[1:07:07] Lord is laying on your heart, and the
[1:07:09] devil will just beat you over the head
[1:07:11] about it. And usually it's because it's
[1:07:14] something simple, and the devil will
[1:07:16] say, "That's so simple. Everybody knows
[1:07:18] that. Nobody needs to hear that." And uh
[1:07:22] those are the sermons that usually I
[1:07:24] tell the devil, you know what? you were
[1:07:26] wrong last time,
[1:07:28] so you're I'm I'm betting you're wrong
[1:07:30] again.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; But some of those simple sermons like
[1:07:34] we're looking at tonight. The simplicity
[1:07:36] of divine healing. Well, that's simple.
[1:07:38] That's something that we all should
[1:07:39] knowe quite a bit about. But we're
[1:07:41] having a prayer line at the end of the
[1:07:43] service. And so when we do that, I like
[1:07:45] to have something that's just grounding
[1:07:46] us on simple faithbuing things about the
[1:07:49] word. And I find those sermons. Now,
[1:07:52] you've got some people that you you
[1:07:54] preach some a little bit deeper uh
[1:07:56] teaching type sermon. You've got a few
[1:07:58] people they'll migrate to that and
[1:08:00] they'll say, "Oh, praise God. That was
[1:08:02] that was great. That was one of our
[1:08:03] favorites." But most of the people I
[1:08:05] find, I'll preach something that the
[1:08:07] devil has beat me about for days that is
[1:08:10] so simple and so unnecessary. And I'll
[1:08:12] get up and preach that. And I'll have
[1:08:14] text message after text message and
[1:08:16] people meeting me in the parking lot
[1:08:17] saying, "Brother Nathan, you have no
[1:08:19] idea how much we needed that."
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; The simplicity.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Now, over the years, we've looked at
[1:08:27] things on the family, you know, siblings
[1:08:30] and parents and children and spouses and
[1:08:33] different things, different relations
[1:08:35] there and and and different things on
[1:08:37] the family that Brother Brandon brings
[1:08:38] out and and different personal
[1:08:40] experiences and things. And we've looked
[1:08:42] at that over the years. But as I was
[1:08:44] looking, we were on a little series on
[1:08:45] Wednesday night on encouragers. And I
[1:08:48] began to look at some things on the
[1:08:49] family. And again, the devil beat me up
[1:08:52] so bad. And and you know, I really
[1:08:55] didn't have I felt like quite enough
[1:08:57] material for that first sermon. And he
[1:08:59] said, "You don't even have enough
[1:09:00] material for a sermon, and you don't
[1:09:02] have anything to say." And that we just
[1:09:04] had everything that could go wrong went
[1:09:06] wrong at the house that day. And and you
[1:09:08] you know, then he began to beat me up.
[1:09:09] you're not even the right attitude to
[1:09:11] bring something like this. And and he
[1:09:13] just poured it on all day. And I I
[1:09:16] almost multiple times, Brother Jack, I
[1:09:18] almost backed out and said, "You know
[1:09:19] what? We'll just play a tape tonight or
[1:09:21] I'll see if one of the brothers has
[1:09:22] something on their heart last minute."
[1:09:24] Almost backed out multiple times through
[1:09:27] the day. And I got there and I said,
[1:09:28] "You know what, Boo Devil? We're going
[1:09:30] to preach this anyhow."
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And I had a sister meet me. I went
[1:09:34] downstairs after service to my office
[1:09:35] and I had a sister meet me before I
[1:09:37] could get to my office and she said,
[1:09:38] "Brother Nathan, my husband and I have
[1:09:41] been praying for two weeks that you
[1:09:43] would preach a series on the family."
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And I got a text before I got in my car
[1:09:48] and a brother said, "Brother Nathan, my
[1:09:50] wife and I have had to make some
[1:09:51] decisions for our children and we've
[1:09:54] been praying about it and trying to
[1:09:55] believe that we're making the right
[1:09:57] decisions, but the devil was just trying
[1:09:58] to make us uncertain about it. And you
[1:10:00] went through each decision we made in
[1:10:03] that sermon and confirmed everything
[1:10:05] that we were doing.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So boo devil.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's the simple things.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, when it when it's a
[1:10:20] friendship,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; when it's somebody in need.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; So, and sometimes we don't have the
[1:10:27] words. Sometimes somebody's going
[1:10:29] through a divorce or they've had a a a
[1:10:31] child die or a spouse die or a parent
[1:10:34] die or something and they're going
[1:10:36] through something. Well, well, what
[1:10:38] words do you say at a time like that?
[1:10:39] You can send them scriptures and quotes
[1:10:41] and but what do what do we say? We don't
[1:10:43] have the words at a time like that. Or
[1:10:45] maybe somebody's gone through a
[1:10:46] devastating, you know, something a a
[1:10:48] catastrophe, a house fire, or or they've
[1:10:51] they've uh had a loved one backslide, or
[1:10:54] they've, you know, uh had had some type
[1:10:56] of a situation in in their life. They
[1:10:59] they've got an, you know, the doctor's
[1:11:01] pronounced them that they have an
[1:11:03] incurable, as far as the doctor would
[1:11:05] say, disease or, you know, all all types
[1:11:07] of bad news that could hit them or or or
[1:11:11] whatever it be. they get a bad report on
[1:11:13] their mental state or whatever. And and
[1:11:15] you know, sometimes we don't have the
[1:11:17] words to say at a time like that, but I
[1:11:20] found just a simple action like showing
[1:11:23] up
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; and being there for him,
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; going and visiting them when they're in
[1:11:28] the hospital
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; or just going and sitting with them and
[1:11:31] I I don't know what to say, buddy, but
[1:11:33] I'm here for you
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; in a time like that is something that'll
[1:11:37] stick with them more than all the words
[1:11:39] we can say. That is simple. I told our
[1:11:42] boys when they started work, and I
[1:11:44] wasn't I'm not a prophet. I wasn't
[1:11:46] prophesying, but I'm on that spectrum.
[1:11:48] This I'm not in the stupid spectrum.
[1:11:51] Amen. I may not be the smartest, you
[1:11:53] know, I may not be the sharpest tool in
[1:11:55] the shed, but I I do know a few things.
[1:11:58] And I told our boys, they started
[1:11:59] working at Chick-fil-A, and Philips
[1:12:01] moved on to another job, and Nathaniel's
[1:12:03] moving up there, and he's become a
[1:12:05] trainer, and they're wanting him to be a
[1:12:06] manager. And Philip's at a Jersey
[1:12:08] Mike's, and they're wanting him to be a
[1:12:09] manager there. And and so I told the
[1:12:11] boys when they started, I said, "Look,
[1:12:13] you don't you don't have to be the
[1:12:15] smartest person at the job there." And
[1:12:17] and and you don't have to you don't have
[1:12:20] to work yourself to death. If you will
[1:12:22] just show up
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; and put a smile on your face
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; and be agreeable,
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; you have a great future in the business
[1:12:31] world ahead of you
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; because people are doing everything they
[1:12:34] can out here just to get somebody to
[1:12:36] show up and not treat their customers
[1:12:39] nasty.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; So just showing up is is a pretty good
[1:12:43] thing.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's that doesn't just go
[1:12:46] for that doesn't just go for jobs. Hey,
[1:12:49] I'm thankful somebody showed up tonight.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful when we get up to preach
[1:12:54] that we're not just preaching at polls
[1:12:56] and balloons and pictures on the back
[1:12:58] door.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful there was more than that,
[1:13:04] Brother Solomon.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful there were some breathing
[1:13:13] people in the seats.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful you showed up.
[1:13:20] Oh my.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful,
[1:13:25] you know, that I had parents that would
[1:13:27] show up when I needed them. You know,
[1:13:30] when you're a kid and you're trying your
[1:13:32] best, maybe you're have going through
[1:13:34] having a graduation or having a maybe
[1:13:37] you're in baseball, little league or
[1:13:39] whatever it be. It's it's nice when your
[1:13:41] parents just show up or the grandparents
[1:13:43] or whoever it was. Now, they may not be
[1:13:45] the greatest. They they may not have
[1:13:47] been a basketball player or baseball
[1:13:49] player, whatever. They may not be able
[1:13:50] to coach you through and give you all
[1:13:51] the wisdom in the world, but just
[1:13:53] showing up, there's something about it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's encouraging. So, I'm thankful for
[1:13:58] people that show up.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You hear phrases that people say,
[1:14:02] especially older older people. I'm not
[1:14:04] going to point out anybody specifically,
[1:14:06] but maybe maybe Sister Burrs or Sister
[1:14:09] Mima, you might hear them say things
[1:14:11] like, "Those were simpler times. All
[1:14:14] right.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Those were simpler times.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And and they that that's something that
[1:14:21] they're they're nostalgic about. Oh, it
[1:14:23] was just a time where you could sit on
[1:14:25] the front porch and you knew your
[1:14:27] neighbors names and and you know, people
[1:14:30] would walk by and wave and say, "God
[1:14:32] bless you." And and you know, there
[1:14:34] wasn't all the road rage and and all
[1:14:36] this and people going out of their
[1:14:37] minds. Those were simpler times.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The simplicity. People make statements
[1:14:42] like, "Give me the simple life."
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; What do they mean? They mean they want
[1:14:47] to move to an island off of Florida and
[1:14:50] just sit on their front porch and watch
[1:14:52] the ocean roll in.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Give me the simple life.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Just give me or or give me a, you know,
[1:14:57] a front porch swing or a rocking chair
[1:14:59] and and a cup of coffee and, you know,
[1:15:02] hey, so a cup of coffee and and your
[1:15:04] Bible and some time with Jesus. There's
[1:15:06] hardly anything that can replace that.
[1:15:09] That's pretty simple. Most people can do
[1:15:10] that. Maybe you don't have a oceanfront
[1:15:13] view. Maybe you don't have a front porch
[1:15:14] swing. Maybe you have a little 3x3
[1:15:17] balcony off of your apartment. Or maybe
[1:15:19] you have a little uh 12 by 12 cement
[1:15:22] patio back of your house or whatever it
[1:15:24] be. But you can still take your coffee
[1:15:26] and your Bible and spend some time with
[1:15:28] Jesus out there. And those simple times,
[1:15:31] that simple life is some of our greatest
[1:15:33] memories. Some of the most relaxing,
[1:15:35] most enjoyable things. We we love taking
[1:15:37] our family on vacation and doing nice
[1:15:39] things and and you know sometimes we
[1:15:41] spend probably more money than we should
[1:15:42] on those things. But some of our our
[1:15:44] best memories are not always things or
[1:15:48] are not always expensive things for
[1:15:50] sure. But you know what I love more than
[1:15:52] about anything except the presence of
[1:15:54] the Lord. One of the things as far as in
[1:15:56] the natural that I love more than about
[1:15:58] anything is a beautiful fall day back
[1:16:00] home. Now I know here you know but
[1:16:02] sister sister Bers knows what I'm
[1:16:04] talking about. when the leaves begin to
[1:16:05] change back home. She's been there in
[1:16:07] October and seen it and took some leaves
[1:16:09] home. Just a beautiful fall day.
[1:16:12] Something about it. Uh, you know, a good
[1:16:14] cup of coffee. You know, that's not very
[1:16:16] I mean anymore it's a little expensive
[1:16:18] maybe, but but it's not it's not
[1:16:20] something that's going to bankrupt you.
[1:16:22] There's something about it's just
[1:16:23] something simple, but it can be a good
[1:16:24] experience. Going for a walk or going
[1:16:27] for a drive. My son Philip, he gets that
[1:16:29] from me. He just sometimes if he's
[1:16:31] stressed out, he say, "Dad, I'm going
[1:16:33] for a drive. All
[1:16:34] right.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You know, a little bit of gas money, but
[1:16:36] it's not going to it's not going to
[1:16:38] shock the bank.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Just something simple. Going to a park
[1:16:41] and walking around.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Going We like to go and walk around.
[1:16:44] That's another thing Sister Birds and
[1:16:46] Sister Cobb have have have experienced
[1:16:49] going to the some of the festivals back
[1:16:51] home and walking around. Simple things
[1:16:53] like that. the simplicity and we we're
[1:16:56] so busy and so hectic and got to go here
[1:16:58] and got to go there, but but sometimes
[1:17:00] just the simplicity to slow down and
[1:17:03] stop and as we would say, smell the
[1:17:04] roses,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; breathe in through the nose and out
[1:17:07] through the mouth.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; There's a simplicity of it about
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; God hiding himself in simplicity.
[1:17:13] Brother Bam says, God does not reveal
[1:17:15] himself in greatness as we call
[1:17:18] greatness. God, when he came in human
[1:17:21] form, he didn't come as some great
[1:17:23] massive king with a crown on his head
[1:17:26] and great flowing robes. He came as a
[1:17:28] baby in a manger in a stinking stable.
[1:17:32] It was so simple. It wasn't what we
[1:17:34] would consider great. Brother Ben tells
[1:17:36] us we in the sermon uh perfect strength
[1:17:39] through perfect weakness, he said we
[1:17:40] need to master this thought of human
[1:17:43] ability.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; He said it's not it's not what we can
[1:17:46] do. God doesn't need your ability. He
[1:17:48] needs you just to be obedient to him.
[1:17:51] The Bible says it's through the
[1:17:52] foolishness of preaching that people are
[1:17:54] saved. You realize, you know, to most
[1:17:56] people this seems foolish. There's a guy
[1:17:58] up here uh you know, just just talking
[1:18:01] to you. Uh you know well what did he
[1:18:04] have a did he have a curriculum to go
[1:18:06] off of? Did he have something written
[1:18:07] out and prepared? No. It seemed like he
[1:18:09] was just rambling to me. But we sure
[1:18:11] enjoyed it.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. and a man get in a channel
[1:18:14] and just get up here and maybe the
[1:18:16] devil's beat him up all day about it,
[1:18:18] but get up here and get into a certain
[1:18:20] channel and the Lord maybe take him
[1:18:21] through things that you're going through
[1:18:23] in your church or your family or your
[1:18:25] personal life that he don't know
[1:18:26] anything about but that you knew that
[1:18:29] God knew and maybe things that you
[1:18:30] haven't told anybody. I you know we
[1:18:33] there's been times brother Jack has
[1:18:35] experienced it. I've experienced it
[1:18:36] different brothers where you're
[1:18:37] preaching and you think why on earth am
[1:18:39] I going down this path? This was not the
[1:18:41] path I had planned. And then somebody
[1:18:43] come to me. I had a pastor tell me
[1:18:45] recently. He said, "Brother Nathan, I'm
[1:18:47] sorry that I got quiet on you in the
[1:18:49] service there." He said, "It wasn't that
[1:18:51] I wasn't enjoying it." He said, "I just
[1:18:52] had to be careful not to amen too loud
[1:18:54] because you were actually entering right
[1:18:56] into conversations and things that I'd
[1:18:58] had with some people in the church."
[1:19:00] Amen. Well, he didn't tell me that and I
[1:19:02] didn't know. And I'm not a prophet. I
[1:19:04] didn't say this person said this and all
[1:19:06] that. No, it was just God got me in a
[1:19:08] channel for a minute to where somebody
[1:19:10] could say, I know that that brother
[1:19:12] doesn't know that. But God was mindful
[1:19:14] of my need.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The foolishness of preaching.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; When I am weak, St. Paul would say, then
[1:19:21] I am strong. Brother Bannon would talk
[1:19:23] about perfect strength through perfect
[1:19:26] weakness. It seems so strange. I was
[1:19:28] reading to the church a scriptural a
[1:19:30] scripture here recently where the Bible
[1:19:32] says Jesus says it over in the New
[1:19:34] Testament. They're quoting David. He
[1:19:36] He's talking about the, you know, how
[1:19:38] the people were walking after him saying
[1:19:40] hosanana and all that and they asked him
[1:19:41] to be quiet and he said, "Don't you know
[1:19:43] that that David in the Psalms says uh
[1:19:46] that that praise is perfected by babes
[1:19:48] and sucklings." But if you go back and
[1:19:51] actually read what David said, now if I
[1:19:52] quoted it the way Jesus quoted it, you'd
[1:19:54] get mad at me, but Jesus knew the bigger
[1:19:57] picture of what it was talking about.
[1:19:58] David actually says that strength is
[1:20:00] perfected by babes and sucklings. And if
[1:20:04] we had a little baby here tonight and we
[1:20:05] brought it up here and then we had
[1:20:07] whoever here works out the most, you
[1:20:09] know, and and they're pretty strong
[1:20:11] things and I I brought up the little
[1:20:12] infant baby and brought up that great
[1:20:14] big burly man and said, "Which one of
[1:20:16] these do you think God is perfecting
[1:20:17] strength through?"
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; We would pick the opposite.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; David, when he was to be anointed,
[1:20:23] Samuel picked everybody before he picked
[1:20:25] David.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; In fact, David's dad didn't even bring
[1:20:28] David to the anointing ceremony because
[1:20:31] he thought it won't be him. No reason to
[1:20:33] bring he we don't need to bring him all
[1:20:34] the way in from taking care of the
[1:20:36] sheep. It won't be him for sure.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; His own daddy didn't see the potential.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were looking at the
[1:20:43] stature of man. But God said, "But I
[1:20:46] look at the heart on what's on the
[1:20:47] inside."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And so this strength is perfected by
[1:20:52] weakness. It's so the opposite of the
[1:20:54] way that our mind works. But brother
[1:20:56] Brandham tells us he said from that time
[1:20:58] 1960 he said we want to follow the
[1:21:01] simplicity of the Holy Spirit.
[1:21:05] Sometimes I don't know about it in your
[1:21:07] life but in my life sometimes the Holy
[1:21:09] Spirit will impress us to do something
[1:21:11] that is so simple that we argue with him
[1:21:14] for a while because we think that can't
[1:21:16] be him.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That's too simple.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; But God works in those simple ways.
[1:21:23] sometimes is just call that person that
[1:21:26] that maybe you know maybe there's even a
[1:21:28] little friction between you and them but
[1:21:29] you know they're really going through a
[1:21:30] struggle and just call them or text them
[1:21:33] and say hey I just want to let you know
[1:21:35] somebody's praying for you today
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; and maybe you think that is so simple I
[1:21:40] my they they won't receive that or they
[1:21:42] don't need that or they wouldn't receive
[1:21:44] it from me and the Holy Spirit just keep
[1:21:46] impressing it on you go ahead and call
[1:21:48] that person or text them and tell them
[1:21:50] that you just want to let them know
[1:21:51] somebody's praying about you today For
[1:21:53] all you know, that person, you know, we
[1:21:55] think that's simple, but the devil may
[1:21:57] be bombarding that person mentally to
[1:21:59] where they're about to give up on
[1:22:01] everything because they think nobody
[1:22:03] cares about me. Nobody loves me. If I
[1:22:06] just disappeared from the earth, nobody
[1:22:08] would even notice. And then they get a
[1:22:09] text and somebody says, "You're on my
[1:22:11] heart today. I'm praying for you today.
[1:22:14] Somebody loves you. Somebody cares about
[1:22:16] you." And they think, "Oh my, I guess
[1:22:18] the devil was a liar after all." Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; My
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; We're running out of time, so let me
[1:22:26] skip ahead here. But brother Bam talks
[1:22:28] about Tommy Osborne. And brother Tommy
[1:22:31] was another evangelist and and he had
[1:22:33] been to the meetings there in Portland,
[1:22:35] Oregon at the same meetings where the
[1:22:37] where the uh uh the insane manuh had run
[1:22:41] down there and and told Brother Bam he
[1:22:43] was going to break every bone in his
[1:22:44] body, the maniac there. and his wife saw
[1:22:47] that happen and and and Tommy came down
[1:22:50] to the meetings there and and he said
[1:22:52] look he said brother Brandham he said
[1:22:54] you think God's given me a healing
[1:22:55] ministry and brother Brandham said Tommy
[1:22:58] every man that's called to preach is
[1:22:59] called to pray for the sick and he said
[1:23:01] but look don't go after fantastical
[1:23:03] things he said you see that old oak
[1:23:05] sitting over there and Tommy said which
[1:23:07] one he said the Baldwin over there and
[1:23:09] he was talking about brother Bosworth
[1:23:10] brother FF Bosworth he said you go sit
[1:23:13] under him for a while he knows more
[1:23:15] about script scriptures on divine
[1:23:17] healing than any man on the face of the
[1:23:19] earth. And brother Tommy did that and
[1:23:21] brother Bham runs into brother Tommy a
[1:23:23] few few years later and he's coming back
[1:23:25] from meetings overseas where they've
[1:23:26] been having healing revivals. Well,
[1:23:28] brother Bham's gift and brother Tommy's
[1:23:30] gift were very different and very
[1:23:32] different styles of ministry. Brother
[1:23:33] Brandham would go and under the
[1:23:34] anointing and a gift of prophecy and and
[1:23:36] a prophetic gift there and seeing
[1:23:39] visions and discernment things, he would
[1:23:40] be so weak from the meetings and things.
[1:23:42] where they'd have to drive him around
[1:23:44] for a while and try to get him to come
[1:23:45] out from under that anointing. Brother
[1:23:47] Tommy comes back from overseas. He says,
[1:23:49] "Are you tired, Brother Tommy?" He said,
[1:23:50] "Not at all." He said, "How why not
[1:23:53] having all those meetings over there and
[1:23:54] things?" He said, "Brother Brandon," he
[1:23:55] said, "I just get up and I just read the
[1:23:58] scriptures on divine healing and I just
[1:24:00] tell the people that's what the
[1:24:02] scripture says. You can accept it or you
[1:24:04] can reject it, but that's what the
[1:24:06] scripture says." And then he said, "I
[1:24:07] just go over and walk over and sit down
[1:24:10] and watch people begin to stand up and
[1:24:12] accept it by faith." And he said, "Then
[1:24:14] me and my wife go down and walk along
[1:24:16] the beach and rejoice and praise the
[1:24:18] Lord for what he did that night and go
[1:24:19] back to our hotel room." He said, "I'm
[1:24:21] not tired.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; My call me to that kind of ministry,
[1:24:25] Lord."
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon makes this statement. He
[1:24:30] says early spiritual experiences 1952.
[1:24:33] Tommy Osbourne is one of the most
[1:24:34] powerful evangelists in the field today
[1:24:36] in the realm of divine healing because
[1:24:39] he knows the word of the Lord in the
[1:24:41] Bible. Again, faith without works is
[1:24:43] dead. 1953. He knows the Bible and know
[1:24:46] what God says. And God has endued him
[1:24:49] with a knowledge of the Bible that ties
[1:24:52] Satan to where he just can't move by the
[1:24:56] scriptures. And he tells us multiple
[1:24:58] times, but this is from door to the
[1:25:00] heart in 1958. The word will defeat the
[1:25:03] devil anywhere,
[1:25:06] any time, under any conditions.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I like when when the Bible and when
[1:25:14] brother Brandham uses that word any
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; or when they use words like all, all
[1:25:20] things are possible. I'm the Lord that
[1:25:23] health all thy diseases. So that means
[1:25:26] no matter what else comes out or what
[1:25:28] they name it or what takes place, it's
[1:25:30] going to fit under the category of all
[1:25:33] thy diseases. I know it's hard for us to
[1:25:35] understand in some of our circumstances,
[1:25:37] but the Bible said, "All things work
[1:25:40] together for good to them that love the
[1:25:42] Lord." And brother Bam tells us, he
[1:25:44] said, "The word will defeat Satan
[1:25:46] anywhere." That means West Palm Beach
[1:25:49] included uh at any time under any
[1:25:54] conditions.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; So in 2025,
[1:25:57] regardless of what your condition is,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; the Lord will still defeat the devil by
[1:26:03] his word anywhere, any place, under any
[1:26:06] conditions. He tells us in investments
[1:26:09] in 1962, it's the simplicity of just
[1:26:12] accepting what he has said and seeing it
[1:26:17] made a reality. Now, I'm just going to
[1:26:20] read you just a few scriptures here and
[1:26:23] on healing and then we're going to have
[1:26:26] word of prayer and then we'll have
[1:26:27] brother Jack come and see how he wants
[1:26:29] to to have a prayer line. But let me
[1:26:32] just read you these things. These aren't
[1:26:34] going to be any anything I don't think
[1:26:35] I'll read anything new tonight that
[1:26:36] you're going to say, "Oh my, I've never
[1:26:38] heard that before." Well, then you need
[1:26:39] to read your Bible more, but I I don't
[1:26:41] think we'll read anything tonight that
[1:26:43] you're not aware of. But just it's good
[1:26:45] to be reminded of those things. Peter
[1:26:47] said, uh, I'm just paraphrasing it, but
[1:26:49] he's basically what he's telling the
[1:26:51] church there is as long as there's
[1:26:52] breath in his body, he's going to bring
[1:26:55] to their remembrance what the word has
[1:26:58] already told them. And I believe any
[1:27:00] true minister of the gospel, that's our
[1:27:02] job to keep pointing people back and
[1:27:04] saying, "This is what the word says."
[1:27:06] Stay with that. Amen. Brother Bram said,
[1:27:08] "You, you have the light, now walk in
[1:27:10] it."
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Exodus 15:26, "I am the Lord that health
[1:27:17] thee." That's a promise.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Psalm 103:1, "Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:27:24] soul, and all that is within me. Bless
[1:27:26] his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:27:29] soul, and forget not all his benefits.
[1:27:32] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities. Who
[1:27:36] health healeth all thy diseases. Who
[1:27:39] redeemth thy life from destruction. Who
[1:27:42] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[1:27:44] tender mercies. Who satisfieth thy mouth
[1:27:47] with good things, so that thy youth is
[1:27:50] renewed like the eagles. Isaiah 53:5.
[1:27:55] But he was wounded for our
[1:27:57] transgressions. That means yours and
[1:27:59] mine.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:28:06] him. And with his stripes we are healed.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Read your name in there tonight.
[1:28:13] That's
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; My I I I feel I wish I could have
[1:28:18] preached more tonight, Brother Jack, but
[1:28:19] my voice was holding me back. But with
[1:28:21] scriptures like this, you feel like you
[1:28:23] could run through a troop and leap over
[1:28:24] a wall whether you have the voice to or
[1:28:26] not.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:7. This was the first
[1:28:31] commission that Jesus gave to the
[1:28:33] disciples. As you go preach, saying,
[1:28:36] "The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal
[1:28:38] the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
[1:28:42] dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have
[1:28:45] received, freely give." Now he's
[1:28:47] crucified, buried, and risen. and he's
[1:28:50] getting ready to ascend. And he tells
[1:28:52] them what we call the great commission
[1:28:54] or the last commission in Mark 16:1 17,
[1:28:57] which is very similar to the first
[1:28:59] commission. These signs shall follow
[1:29:01] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:29:05] cast out devils.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:29:09] shall take up serpents, and if they
[1:29:11] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:29:13] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:29:16] sick and they shall recover. Amen.
[1:29:20] That's a promise tonight.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we're having a prayer
[1:29:23] line. The the great commission is they
[1:29:26] shall lay their hands on the sick and
[1:29:28] they shall recover. James 5:14. Is any
[1:29:31] sick among you? Let him call for the
[1:29:34] elders of the church, and let them pray
[1:29:36] over him, anointing him with oil in the
[1:29:39] name of the Lord, and the prayer of
[1:29:41] faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
[1:29:44] shall raise him up. And if he have
[1:29:46] committed sins, they shall be forgiven
[1:29:50] him.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads together.
[1:29:54] Amen. How many
[1:29:57] How many would slip up your hands and
[1:29:58] say, "Brother Nathan, I have a need
[1:30:00] tonight. I have a need in my life. Maybe
[1:30:03] it's financial, maybe it's spiritual,
[1:30:06] maybe it's physical, maybe it's a family
[1:30:09] need. Whatever it be, the Lord sees that
[1:30:10] need. Heavenly Father,
[1:30:13] Lord, as I I've tried to get into the
[1:30:16] channel, Lord, that you would have me to
[1:30:18] go down for this service tonight and
[1:30:21] just tried to get myself out of the way.
[1:30:24] And I thank you, Lord, for helping my
[1:30:27] voice, not knowing, Lord, even entering
[1:30:30] into the service tonight, how we were
[1:30:31] going to get through, but you're
[1:30:33] faithful and you're true. And Lord, I
[1:30:35] pray that the the simple words that were
[1:30:38] spoken tonight, Lord, and kind of a
[1:30:40] chopped up message of different
[1:30:41] directions that it wound up going, I
[1:30:43] pray, Lord, that it'd be a help. But I
[1:30:45] pray that it'd go, Lord, beyond the
[1:30:48] minds of the people of just an
[1:30:49] intellectual conception, but that it
[1:30:51] would sink down into the very soul of of
[1:30:54] the people, Lord. They would recognize
[1:30:56] the the quotes in the scriptures that
[1:30:58] we've read tonight. They're they're
[1:30:59] true. And may they accept them for their
[1:31:02] individual needs, Lord. Maybe it's
[1:31:04] emotional healing. Maybe it's physical
[1:31:06] healing. Maybe it's spiritual healing.
[1:31:08] Maybe mental healing. Whatever it would
[1:31:10] be, Father, you know the need. You know
[1:31:12] the circumstance. And I pray, Father,
[1:31:15] that you would just, Lord, each one,
[1:31:18] whether they they receive it in their
[1:31:20] seat there or whether they come through
[1:31:22] this line, I pray, Lord, that you would
[1:31:24] speak to the needs in their life. I pray
[1:31:27] Lord that you'd comfort them and give
[1:31:29] them a faith that it's settled, that
[1:31:31] it's a finished work, and that they can
[1:31:34] have confidence in you that even now
[1:31:36] you're working on both ends of the line
[1:31:38] to bring forth, Lord, what their need
[1:31:40] is. Maybe it'll come very differently
[1:31:43] than they've expected or that they could
[1:31:45] even imagine that you would work out the
[1:31:48] need. Maybe it'll the outcome will be
[1:31:50] different than even that they're praying
[1:31:52] for because of their own limited uh view
[1:31:55] of what you can do. But Lord, whatever
[1:31:58] the outcome will be will be so much
[1:32:00] better than anything we could think or
[1:32:02] hope or imagine. Lord, as your prophet
[1:32:04] would say, there have been times when
[1:32:06] he'd pray and ask you, and you'd say
[1:32:08] yes, and other times he would pray and
[1:32:10] ask, and you'd say no, but that your nos
[1:32:13] were even better than your yeses once he
[1:32:15] found out that was your perfect will for
[1:32:17] his life. And Lord, we want your will,
[1:32:20] Father. There's sometimes that you don't
[1:32:22] let us have what we're asking in the
[1:32:24] exact season because you have something
[1:32:26] better laying down the road for us and
[1:32:28] you're going to bring it about in a way
[1:32:30] that's different than we could have ever
[1:32:31] imagined or planned. But Lord, we trust
[1:32:34] in you tonight. We've seen you in our
[1:32:36] life, Lord. Times I've prayed and begged
[1:32:38] and asked you for something and it
[1:32:40] didn't work out exactly the way that I
[1:32:41] had planned, but to come to find out
[1:32:43] later, Lord, what you had was better
[1:32:46] than the way that I was asking. and you
[1:32:48] just winked at my ignorance and it went
[1:32:50] right over the type the top of my own
[1:32:53] self-will, Lord. And your grace was
[1:32:55] sufficient, Lord. Your sovereignty, your
[1:32:58] mercy to us. Lord, I pray that you'd be
[1:33:00] with us tonight. Be with each
[1:33:01] individual, each family. Lord, may we go
[1:33:04] from this building a little closer to
[1:33:06] you than when we came in and with
[1:33:08] testimonies. Lord, thinking back here
[1:33:10] recently, sharing some of the
[1:33:12] testimonies of things that you've done
[1:33:14] over the years at our church back home
[1:33:16] and different places, Lord, that I've
[1:33:18] traveled and testimonies and miracles
[1:33:20] and things that by your grace we've seen
[1:33:23] and so many of them were right here at
[1:33:25] Spirit and Truth, Lord. So many things
[1:33:28] that you've done for us. So Lord, we
[1:33:30] come knowing you're not a respector of
[1:33:32] persons and knowing that the same God
[1:33:34] that has come on the scene before can
[1:33:36] come on the scene again tonight. We give
[1:33:38] it to you, Father, for your glory in
[1:33:42] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:33:45] Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:33:49] Bless you.
[1:33:58] I want to say I've got God has blessed
[1:34:00] me with a lot of friends and more than I
[1:34:03] deserve minister brothers and and
[1:34:06] precious Christian brothers around the
[1:34:07] world but this is one of my closest
[1:34:09] friends. I love him and appreciate him
[1:34:12] too.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless you.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] Thank God for the word uh of the Lord on
[1:34:19] tonight.
[1:34:21] Um, I just actually just coming out of
[1:34:24] the gate, Brother Nathan was speaking uh
[1:34:27] to something that just happened, a quote
[1:34:29] that I read you all um uh at the
[1:34:33] beginning of the uh before he preached
[1:34:36] out of the Patmas vision. It was a quote
[1:34:40] that I was actually answering the
[1:34:43] question of a minister from Pakistan.
[1:34:48] And uh he was asking me some question
[1:34:51] and you know and and and I was um I said
[1:34:55] f my first response is like brother do
[1:34:58] you have a church age book because uh
[1:35:01] that question is is answered right there
[1:35:04] in the church age book. I mean, it's if
[1:35:06] you if you read that church age book,
[1:35:08] there's no way you would not understand
[1:35:10] what that verse means because it's right
[1:35:13] there in the church age book. So, I I I
[1:35:15] have to give them a source. I don't want
[1:35:17] to be the source,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; right? I I mean, uh you know, I'm
[1:35:21] talking about Pakistan. Can you imagine
[1:35:23] getting questions all over the world
[1:35:24] like that and trying to trying to answer
[1:35:26] them all? It just, you know, you can't
[1:35:27] do it. So you have to lead people to the
[1:35:30] source where they can get their answers,
[1:35:31] you know, and uh and then they depend on
[1:35:34] the same God that I depend on, you know,
[1:35:36] but uh but he came right out of the gate
[1:35:38] just speaking directly to me and even
[1:35:41] got all the way down to the end and his
[1:35:44] sermon was on the simplicity of divine
[1:35:47] healing. So, we all was feeling that um
[1:35:50] you know, well, he's going to pray for
[1:35:51] the sick. And you might think that uh
[1:35:53] well, that's not something I'm really
[1:35:55] dealing with, so I'll I'll just bypass
[1:35:57] tonight. Well, then he he says, you
[1:36:00] might have a financial need,
[1:36:02] right? And then he said, you also might
[1:36:04] have a a sickness or you might have
[1:36:06] something else that you're dealing with.
[1:36:08] Uh maybe somebody need prayer for a job,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; right? May maybe somebody need prayer
[1:36:13] for their business. whatever the need is
[1:36:16] tonight. I think if you can mix your
[1:36:18] faith
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; with what God just spoke to us tonight,
[1:36:22] then we can see a change in our
[1:36:24] situations. And as I read the quote
[1:36:26] earlier, if you come in the spirit, not
[1:36:29] worked up, that's what we're talking
[1:36:31] about. But come because God has made you
[1:36:33] a promise. And I am standing on that
[1:36:36] promise. Uh for those that are in
[1:36:38] business and your business, like I I'm
[1:36:40] going to stand up here tonight because
[1:36:41] of my business. I lost some hours, but
[1:36:43] I'm I'm believing God to restore all
[1:36:45] that and some. And uh but and and the
[1:36:49] promise that I'm standing on is that
[1:36:50] Lord, you told me that whatever
[1:36:54] I did was supposed to prosper,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; right? That's what he said. Right.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; So if that's what he said, then that's
[1:37:05] what I believe
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to do it. do everything
[1:37:09] God has asked me to do and then I'm
[1:37:11] expect him to do the rest. Amen. So,
[1:37:14] whatever you have need of tonight, I'm
[1:37:16] gonna have the musicians uh come and
[1:37:19] just play uh something softly uh for us.
[1:37:22] Amen. On on tonight and um and then
[1:37:27] those that would just like to have a
[1:37:29] prayer, uh we're going to have you line
[1:37:31] up here on my right side. uh the deacons
[1:37:35] will anoint you, but you can line up
[1:37:37] right over here on my right side. And uh
[1:37:40] those that are not going to come for
[1:37:41] prayer for anything, just keep your
[1:37:43] heads bowed. You can sing along um to
[1:37:46] the music that's being played. But just
[1:37:48] let's just um pray for those that are
[1:37:50] coming through the line and uh let's
[1:37:53] just um believe God that people going to
[1:37:56] receive what God has for them tonight.
[1:37:59] Just anything softly. Only believe is
[1:38:01] fine. Only believe.
[1:38:08] later.
[1:38:11] And also if uh the musicians wanted
[1:38:13] prayer um you also are welcome to come
[1:38:16] in uh um individually. Amen. Praise the
[1:38:21] Lord. Um praise God. Praise God. Amen.
[1:38:49] That's right.

[2:35:26] Hallelujah.
[2:35:32] Amen.
[2:35:38] You know, um I read that that quote a
[2:35:41] little earlier and just want to repeat
[2:35:43] what God's prophet told us. If we get
[2:35:45] into the right spirit,
[2:35:48] um it says it might not come
[2:35:51] immediately,
[2:35:52] but in his spirit, it is all over. It's
[2:35:57] all over.
[2:35:59] Whatever you came in this line with
[2:36:03] tonight,
[2:36:05] I want you to believe that it's all
[2:36:07] over.
[2:36:09] If you don't mind, just turn around and
[2:36:10] testify to somebody. Say, "It's all
[2:36:12] over." Tell them. Tell them out of your
[2:36:14] mouth, "It's all over.
[2:36:17] It's all over.
[2:36:20] It's all over.
[2:36:23] It's all over.
[2:36:26] Glory to God. It's all over.
[2:36:29] Amen. Get ready for change
[2:36:33] because it's all over.
[2:36:36] My God. My God. My God. My God. My God.
[2:36:42] And I'm here to tell you ain't nothing
[2:36:44] too hard for God.
[2:36:47] Amen. Just get in the spirit and believe
[2:36:49] God for Amen. What you came up here
[2:36:52] tonight with
[2:36:54] just you'd be surprised. Amen. at what
[2:36:57] was what was in this room. But I just
[2:37:01] believe the way that the Holy Spirit did
[2:37:03] things that he he he he he took care of
[2:37:06] some things tonight. And and there are
[2:37:08] some people that are going to leave here
[2:37:09] and they're going to see immediate
[2:37:11] results.
[2:37:14] They're going to they're going to have
[2:37:16] quick testimonies.
[2:37:18] Somebody going to be coming on Wednesday
[2:37:20] night to testify about something that
[2:37:21] happened on Friday night. Lord, let it
[2:37:24] be me, Jesus.
[2:37:27] Amen. So, I'm going to see immediate
[2:37:30] results and and when you when you see
[2:37:32] that, just be let your faith just get
[2:37:34] ignited and know that God has not forgot
[2:37:37] about you. I reminded Brother Brand, I'm
[2:37:39] praying for them two sisters in the
[2:37:41] prayer line that night and and um you
[2:37:43] know, and as they they you know, they
[2:37:45] they got the prayer and they they went
[2:37:47] on home and it seemed like there was no
[2:37:49] change. Seemed like there was no change.
[2:37:51] But then since they were neighbors in
[2:37:54] the same neighborhood living there, uh
[2:37:56] the angel Lord one night decided just to
[2:38:00] pass through that neighborhood. And uh
[2:38:03] and as he passed through, one of the
[2:38:04] ladies was just uh you know, just up in
[2:38:07] her house shouting while the other one
[2:38:08] was down at the home. She's like, you
[2:38:10] know, I used to not be able to eat and I
[2:38:12] was just so afraid because everything I
[2:38:14] eat would just come right back up. But I
[2:38:15] just felt so hungry. I wanted to eat.
[2:38:17] and she just began to start eating and
[2:38:19] and things that she knew that would
[2:38:21] cause the stomach to get upset. She
[2:38:22] start eating those things and uh she
[2:38:25] said, "Ain't nothing coming up. I don't
[2:38:26] know what's going." She said, "I've been
[2:38:28] healed and said, you know, I wasn't at
[2:38:29] the meeting, but I mean I wasn't it
[2:38:31] didn't happen at the meeting, but it
[2:38:32] happened after the meeting." I mean, and
[2:38:34] I got I got here. She said, "I'm going
[2:38:36] to go up here and tell my neighbor what
[2:38:37] just happened to me." But by the time
[2:38:38] she got there, the angel Lord had
[2:38:40] already beat her there. Hallelujah. And
[2:38:44] when she began to testify, come to find
[2:38:46] out that her neighbor also got healed at
[2:38:48] the same time she got healed. God knows
[2:38:50] how to bring Amen. an answer to your
[2:38:53] request. If you would just confess that
[2:38:56] it's all over. No matter what the
[2:38:58] symptom is, it's all over. Even if your
[2:39:01] bank account begin to decrease a little
[2:39:03] bit more, tell that devil, it's all
[2:39:06] over.
[2:39:08] I can only go up from here.
[2:39:12] GLORY TO GOD.
[2:39:14] AMEN.
[2:39:16] AMEN. THE GREATER THE TESTIMONY, the
[2:39:19] more HE AFFLICT, THE GREATER THE
[2:39:20] TESTIMONY.
[2:39:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord. But
[2:39:24] let's just let's just go trust in God. I
[2:39:26] don't believe this night was amen by
[2:39:28] accident. I believe God for ordained it
[2:39:31] before the foundation of the world that
[2:39:33] this night would be. Amen. I'm expecting
[2:39:35] to hear some powerful testimonies.
[2:39:38] Praise God. I I I I I believe it. I
[2:39:41] believe even people that was online
[2:39:45] that was not able to make it, I believe

[2:41:03] assigned the angels, Lord, to go and to
[2:41:06] bring an answer to every request that
[2:41:09] was brought here tonight. And as it was
[2:41:12] read to us in the scripture, you sent
[2:41:13] your word to heal. So those that were
[2:41:16] not even here tonight, God, we are
[2:41:18] expecting that the word has gone forth
[2:41:20] to them over the airways and over the
[2:41:23] internet, Father, Lord, to bring healing
[2:41:25] to their their circumstances and
[2:41:27] situations, knowing there's not one
[2:41:29] thing too hard for our God. So Lord, we
[2:41:32] look forward to hearing the testimonies
[2:41:33] of praise that would come forth, amen,
[2:41:36] from uh these requests that were given
[2:41:39] to you, Lord. And uh we ask that you
[2:41:41] would strengthen your servant, Lord.
[2:41:43] Brother Nathan, we thank you for him
[2:41:44] just yielding himself. And God, just
[2:41:47] allowing you to use him just once again.
[2:41:50] And Father, we pray that you would just
[2:41:51] restore all that was given out tonight.
[2:41:54] And Lord, as he just gets a little rest
[2:41:56] on tomorrow and prepares himself,
[2:41:58] Father, for Sunday morning, pray that
[2:41:59] you would meet us here, God, in a very,
[2:42:01] very special way. Give traveling mercies
[2:42:04] to the saints, oh God, as they prepare
[2:42:06] to leave this place, but not your
[2:42:07] presence. May we all leave strengthen
[2:42:09] and encourage, Lord, in the name of
[2:42:12] Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[2:42:16] Amen. The brothers will come at this
[2:42:18] time. Amen. To dismiss you. God bless
[2:42:21] you. Amen.
