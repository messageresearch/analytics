minutes that I won't take too much of your time I just wanted to express my appreciation for service song and last Sunday and now we work it would be here we went to the funeral there and st. Augustine celebrate the life of for the home of round and kind of made some last-minute decisions to go into 10 there are many that sign the card for sister Browne also gave role offering and then there to hurry we certainly appreciate that and while I was away brother Troy just stepped right in and carry the service just want to thank him they thanked for that I was early bless a man by by the service then looked on the video and we had a full house and say well wasn't what a blessing you know what I would have what a blessing you know just to see the Saints in service one last weekend so I was just very grateful not just for the trip at all than all the brothers that just kind of stepped up and did what Amen what we do have a spirit of true Tabernacle and just everybody followed them to the places they ban I think they call it next man up and that's that's the way y'all was handling things and I was just very very grateful brother Solomon just handling the service incorporating the visitors that y'all know how I am you get a gift in here don't let him leave here without sharing some of the gifts so brother Solomon got them all a man worked out and worked into the service handling sunday-school horse and a man very very grateful thank you so much for the Solomon god bless you man raised alone man and I wanted to also Jesse because there's a number of things that's just in my heart and I wanted to also express my appreciation for brother Jerry a man owned on Friday night where he was alone as as one of the things we have a little privilege that we have amongst brothers we send out a man every other Tuesday and one of those things that we have on a prayer list is that either God was sin help or raise up help they met in the church and and I'm seeing God raised up some help in the church and the event brother Troy and man brother brother Jerry just raised enough to help and and we're very very grateful a man but for what the Lord is doing and you know so I last I think last week when I saw the service on the video one of prayers that I've always had I never wanted this church to be built a man on me a man on me and things that makes I want the church be built on word Christ because it's not about me it's about him and church ought to be able to still go I mean without a hitch when brother Jack not around and and and and I never wanted to be where people all they come to church for brother Jack here right we don't want to be that way either but what I saw last week I'm like god this is this is the fulfillment of what you know what I've been praying for and God allowed my eyes to see that you know I'm very very thankful for that so and there's just so much more that's that's that's in store let's see God doing and and I'm just I'm blown away I'm absolutely blown away who knows what the Lord has in store for a song but we're gonna be faithful advancing his call amen so thank you all so much I have a card in my office after service I'll put it out we have a cart for sister Rebecca Brian's a man in New Albany Indiana she lost her grandmother recently before that she lost a cousin of hers to a very tragic accident he was cutting a tree at astonished property and as he was cutting the tree the look the saw again or the chainsaw got lodged in the tree and he went to his truck to go get a tool to get the saw out and while he's on the way to the truck the tree fell on him and and he he perished and you know in 37 years old I believe was his age and you know just left thank you the child or two behind and their family has gone through a lot recently so we got a little card we once been her and just you know express our condolences to her family they met in their losses and so I had that those that didn't get a chance to sign it on Friday night I'll have it outside and you can sign it just to sit her condolences Levin what are we thinking about in every lover and I were praying for so please please keep that in mind after the service and I think I don't know if I heard the announcement but we have a couple things happen we got a you service coming up on this Friday is that right we have that announced okay so you service this Saturday at 7 p.m. and brother thinks we'll be here to speak for us remember the digs we'll be here so this Saturday at 7 p.m. he'll be here and he's also going to speak next Sunday morning as well so we look forward to having him they met here and then also coming up the following weekend I have been invited to speak at brother ramiz church on a Saturday night there for the Rhenish Church in Hollywood Florida and uh believes at six o'clock that I have to go to that service of anyone that would like to go would certainly love for you to come and even be a part of that service will never be the following Saturday a man was doing the second if I'm not mistaken we'll have service there brother ray me and Hollywood Florida so keep that in mind Amen all right well praise the Lord we will read our scripture a man so that the see everybody in the house of the Lord Amen all today and then God bless you musicians thank y'all so much appreciate you man praise the Lord praise the Lord I will read from Galatians chapter 4 and then Galatians chapter 4 my lord I will start at verse 21 and everyone standing that can stand and man with us Galatians chapter 4 and starting at verse 21 Amen praise God man it says tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law what is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise which things are an allegory praise the Lord for these are the two covenants the one from the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is Hagar for this Hagar is Mount Sinai and Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written rejoice about barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travellers not for the desolate hath many more children than she which have a husband a man list will stop our reading there I think a little bit later on I want to pick up a little bit more than that that that chapter but we'll stop there for now let's just have a word of Prayer and now we will go into our thought for today father we thank you for the opportunity we have to stand in the presence of the Lord to read the Word of God to hear the word of God it's certainly a man a grand privilege as we come this day we pray that the Holy Ghost would take control over this portion of the service as we have felt your presence through the worship through the specials amen now through the word and now we ask God that you would just take control of our environment we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated so since I missed last Sunday hey man I'm have to give my mother's dang sermon today a man and just a little something that I had in my spirit that I wanted to share with you all and I believe God's timing is always perfect a man and what he does he's always perfect what I think I want to do here my lord a couple of things in my spirit y'all just bear with me a man as we go through this brother Jerry brought a scripture on Friday that Ben it hit me like a ton of bricks and and I wanted to just kind of go back to that I think what he was sharing connected a lot with what brother Troy was sharing on last week and and we haven't we have a responsibility you know I'll be open and honest with you all there you know with with the the turn of events with you know some of the things that's happening right here in our and our myths and our own families and things like that hopefully can be read between the lives but some of these things that are that are happening we see certain spirits that have come into the land today and and oftentimes you know actually you know before I preach the message containment I was a little sensitive to you know just just the condition I didn't want to offend anybody not intentionally that's not what we're trying to do intentionally right if preaching the word offends you then you got to get back in line somewhere right but but you know there there's a there's a you know I know sometimes some I've seen preachers do it where they intentionally go after certain things or certain people that's that's that's one thing and I don't think that's right right but then on the other side I think that you know when certain things happen or or are happening we have to have a defense right and if sometimes it has to come forth from the pulpit but it's not uh you know something to to hurt somebody you know that that's that's not the objective and what we're what we're trying to present but if we could warn somebody then then we want to do the best that we can there so you know there's out there some things I felt like the Holy Spirit was sharing with us on last Sunday you know through brother Troy sermon and then picked it up again on Friday night and brought it through brother brother Jerry and you know I know brother Troy was kind of hitting a man just just how the devil operates how sneaky is you know how if soul plan is just to get worship and folk and go to church every Sunday and not realize that they actually worshipping Satan and not God in church right I mean that'sthat's how slick he was know and don't think I'm alright because he was seeking worship in heaven right so so I think if you can try to get it in heaven what you think you're doing Church right so so so you know sometimes you have some honest people honest hearted people very I mean pure in their motives and an object of some other month not all of them are but some of them are honest and you know and they would they would um you know they reduce some things but I'm doing that don't realize that they way out of the will of God right don't go and realize that you know and and and and unfortunately you know we all we can do just see what the word say you know because there's many people that would ask is like you know if they doing the best they can and you know maybe they just don't believe the message you know but they're doing the best they can't say that's that's reasoning that's what Satan used wouldíve reasoning is what reasons why you go to the hospital reasoning is why children are born a man and Hart liebe reason is why we go to work every day reasoning produced this right if we would have just stayed with the Lord we were reasoning produced war right reasoning produced sickness reasoning produces a lot of negative things that we you know we would another experience it's even if evil just stay with the word but so so we can't approach this thing we reach that we ought to say over the worst and I'm gonna tell you now you know you can be we will talk about this in some school you can be very Amen sincere you can be a foolish virgin sincere virgin clean right you can be you can be all of that and still be lost right so we don't want to be foolish virgin we want it we want to be wise a man in this hour what we're doing so you know brother brother Jerry hit this scripture out of second Thessalonians 2 it I'm a oh I didn't even give you all my title amen the title is another woman's bosom so let's let me let me try to get to that though if I can't I got that you know praise the Lord second because second Thessalonians to a man the 2nd Thessalonians lordy God a man so this is a brother Jerry hit this and I just wanted to read this real quick and then I got a quote I want to try to slip in there with y'all on this so if you if you you know the second throw these second Thessalonians to brother Brandon brings out a lot of that in the first steel you know because he's dealing with the man of sin and and just the stages of that man of sin and how the Pope is involved in that stage you know and you know and and actually what most people don't realize because you know again tie these things together for the Troy hit it last week the you got denominational people preaching against the Catholic Church publicly because they can see according to scripture that the Catholic Church was called the great they can see that and preach it but the Bible also say that the hat harlots children and don't realize that they wanted a children and every child eventually goes back to his mama it's Mother's Day on tell about Mother's Day every child gonna go back to its mother and we don't realize that spiritually and then the church nominal is going right back into the Catholic Church and have no idea that it's happening Oh glory to God how you gonna make it when denomination we already know that we're denomination head it to they going back to where they come from because they did not come from God all right Church so I mean we gotta we gotta just you know apply to you with that and one of the preachers told me say brother we have a responsibility you know as the priests we got to keep the people from leprosy that's my job and in order to keep you from less leprosy I gotta isolate some stuff all right and I'm not coming against that's not that I don't love people I love them and I love you too and when I'm isolating that's protect you and them right that's that's what we're doing here so you know I hope you can you know understand my spirit please second Thessalonians 2 verse 10 through 12 it says and with all deceivableness big words big words deceivableness right of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth they might be saved right that they might be saved so so just than that that those words alone that one verse we realized salvation is found in the truth and we know Christ is the truth we know that we know Christ as the truth but you know what people say is that salvation found in Christ any man but Christ is the truth oh he said it he said I am the way but truth and the life's of you looking for Christ you to have to find him in - [Music] glory to God listen so so because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and you know you know in those day if they didn't receive the truth they weren't safe in Moses day if they didn't receive the truth they weren't saved and it's the same time if you're not gonna receive the truth today how can you know no you might thank you safe but you don't understand you're under this next verse yeah you thank you safe oh my that's that's heart y'all you think you see you act like you said you can impersonate Christians demons can impersonate Christians let me go on say and for this cause because they won't receive truth right the love of the truth for this cause God shall send them before about how evil spirit from the Lord evil spirit not that your God shall send them because you're rejecting his truth God shall send them strong delusion now here's the problem the strong delusions that you you actually think you're Christian that's the delusion you really think you're Christian and you think at the end all of us don't get in some kind of way nodding I work that way no I mean the the the seed of the bondwoman is not err with the freewoman all right let me go home since when is called God's are sending from the loose initiative that they that they should believe a lie and not only that that they share that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now I got I got a lot to to stay here and Lord just helped me to get to get to all of this you know what I'm gonna go to this part right now I was gonna save it so later I'm gonna go ahead and hit it right now I'm going to the seed is not air with the shucks now let's let's look at this I'm paragraph 70 a man with the C does not air with the shucks now I want you to notice this and Lord that y'all just bear with me there wouldn't notice Sarah the tassel had that had the pollen the Jewish nation raised from her from out of cerebral Isaac through Isaac brought Jacob Jacob brought the patriarchs and through the picture patriach brought forth the nation Mary the Virgin's faith produced a true spiritual see Word made flesh see the three women three women that this seat was carried through in his trunk I'm Hagar Sarah and Mary alright he's using them as types and if I could just use it he's using them as allegories okay I'm gonna just leave it like that and I got to go back and try to hit it a little bit later but brother branham is bringing to us an allegory Paul brought to us an allegory right when in Galatians 4 when Paul used a statement which things are an allegory right I mean that that means there's a there's a there's something here but there's a greater meaning behind it and I'm just symbolizing it this way right so he's using so when you look at woman in Scripture you got to think Church because every woman is an allegory to the church there's a greater meaning there hallelujah right and so so so when Paul is bringing that Paul is giving us this allegory even tells us you know very clearly who Hagar was says she was Mount Sinai right she was Mount Sinai elite leave that leave that leave that quote there that's fun I'm I gotta go into spirit justly so y'all just bear with me here please bear with me but he said hey guys Mount Sinai in Arabia and what this is is that that's where they received the Ten Commandments all the commandments from the Lord this is where they got Commandments right the law okay Paul Paul Sam Hagar represent the receiving the law all right but Sarah was an allegory or a type of Jerusalem the free woman all right and then what happened at Jerusalem a man went with the free run free free woman that's where Christ the true promised learn that Isaac but Christ the true part a son brought grace oh yeah right so we thank God but a low but we needed great and this is what Paul is trying to get the people to see hallelujah and even before he brings them to that he acts from in verse 21 it says he that desire to be under the law well what is he saying because you know I was under a man bondage when I was in denomination hallelujah but I come to freedom when this word was revealed to me Oh glory to God so polina want to go back to the nomination I'm going back to the law all right let me go let me go on let me go woman all right so this quote here that I'm reading out of the sea does not air with the ship he says the three women three three women that that this sea was carrying through one of them was actually Abdal tree all right so Hagar relationship with Abraham was an adultery all right under polygamy and it was legal back then it's not legal today Amen but but but so under under adultery action adultery under polygamy the second when he brought forth Isaac under from from on Sarah he said the second was a free woman and the third one had no sex affair at all but by faith she believed the Word of God Hagar Sarah boasts Aaron Hagar was six but Mary was virgin by the power of the promised Word of God that's right he goes on to say the stump Hagar two wives doubted the promise but watch what's that brought forth when Hagar the second wife of Abraham which was just i absolutely a concubine wife but she broke up the man what kind of man was he the Bible said he was a wild man he lived by his boat and no man would conquer him look at this he was untamable I'm convertible unruhe generated oh my god so so so so Ishmael produced by Abraham is a man it's uncomfortable oh my god see this is my you know and if I could just you know just kind of take you back my brother branham say when in Revelation where save Jesus stands at the door and knocks that was true the entire age and that one just to an individual that was some hour to our age because that ain't the denominational age will never be converted untamable listen I regenerated listen he cannot be tamed he was a wild man because he was other contrary to God's Word and if y'all just you know I ain't tellin number the truth the denominational Church they produced a while untamable Christians stuff that going inside the church that would have never happened years ago I'm Tama when you start talking to them they got every excuse as the right here for their life if not it's not what the Bible says what my bishops thing you know your bishop got a love spirit that's why he want the sisters up there dancing like that mister truth in their hand he got a lot spirit that's why he that's why he won them up they're running around but we call their self praise dance minister minister what brings a lot of church right but you know I mean you start looking at some of these things and and you know it's unattainable and it just keep getting worse and worse I mean I you know I was listening to one preached so I'm just like okay let me see you me got a pretty good-sized rhythm see what this guy gonna say here you know he just only going on and they tell the story and the next thing you know that man start cursing I'd say in the pulpit and the people just eat it up grinning and smiling and and thank God for it sir this is your church look when they get raided are in the church something went wrong somewhere sir supposed to be holiday without playing briefs a preacher like that hand guy ain't even be in the pulpit a man but untamable uh nun convertible they can't even be converted now I know they go to the altar like they are getting converted but if you have been converted your life will change and this I'm telling you what when we talk about these women here because hey God gave birth to something alright hey God gave birth to something and Sandra gave birth to something right but about what Hagar gave birth to was untamable I'm convertible I'm regenerated alright he could not be tame he was a wild man because he was other contrary he was other contrary to God's birth I'm going on and anything that's contrary any preacher any lay member any church that's contrary to God's Word when you reject to the truth right if you can turn to God's Word will bring forth oh wow adulterous bunch of worldly Hollywood it cannot stay with the unadulterated word because it's not even including the promise y'all know name number the truth every suitor somehow to leave they go to do the things of the world they can't even live holy no more candy really hold it afore you see pictures posted all over that you can't even live oh you can't you you try but King do it because he rejected the word they put the pressure on you right you know I mean you know you know things that you didn't do now you then wear makeup now wear it now and I'm comfortable glory to God you know I know some people get comfortable just a winner when a wedding is established that's when they feel that they can put some stuff on I'm not sure what scripture you got that from I don't know what Bobby you reading and even Jezebel didn't do it at weddings she did it all the time all right and so the only woman I've knowing the bar but I did it is Jezebel that's that's all when I found them you found somebody else that you cannot identify with as a Christian all right amen as a church member you can do those things but as a Christian you can't okay I'm going on I'm going on we not trying to produce that we trying to produce a bright for a rapture okay I got to go wrong I'm all mixed up in my notes but I must move forward a man a man we talk about another woman's bosom okay so now now let me go back here to another little quote here and I'm a slip around this is god of the evil age the god of the beige trying to bring this just this scripture of second Thessalonians 2 verse 10 through 12 back around and here and and god of this evil the god of this evil age the Prophet says now back through there you belong other ages you belong to denominations you belong to this that or the other what happened to the denominational stock it dries up the spirit keeps leaving and going on and it heads up in a seat you see and the temptation of both heads back the same way it was at the beginning notice don't don't don't I do not forget it now as John first John four five and six if you want to put that down he puts it the spirit of error now before I go further than that quota I have to let you read first John four or five or six then you understand the quote see this is what happened this is this is why we offer a lot of folk all mixed up because they didn't stop to read where the was getting this wrong he just gave you a scripture right all you have to do is stop reading the scripture now you can understand the next statement that he's about to make now look at this first time four five and six now look at this he says they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world heareth you wait a minute let me let me let me let me let me let me read that again they are of the world therefore speak day of the world and the world heareth them the bride is not listening to it but the world I hear you the denominational world alright Church we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God what a probably pulled it from he that is not of God heareth not us all right hereby I hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error so it's two spirits working in this last day and you gonna have to be able to decipher which one is the truth and which one is a pair all right because if you're not careful you give your baby to another woman's bosom and I think that's bad right well I mean here this woman went through all these labor pains and I mean couldn't eat certain things or her body was craving for stuff she didn't even like right but because the baby was asking for it the momma would go through great extremes to make sure the baby was satisfied and then go through all that and then all the pain of labor right to go through all the pain of labor and then I'm gonna give my baby to another person no no no I keep my baby praise the Lord I'm kidding I did all that I'm gonna keep this one praise the Lord search Amen I mean he used to be ashamed for a woman I want to give up a child women want to have children that was that was was a blessing for them right if a woman that have a child in the Bible days and that she felt really really bad that's my hand I was praying the way she would friend I gotta have a child and when God blessed her with a child now she did give up her baby but not to another woman she gave up her baby to God and Mama's you gonna give up your baby give your baby to God don't give your baby to another woman all right and I'm a retailer cool so y'all know where I got that statement from just stay with me please so now we understand there's these two spirits the Spirit of Truth in the spirit of error so the Prophet now goes on the stateís he says as John first John four five and six if you want to put that down he puts it the spirit of error Eve never just simply walked out willfully say I don't believe in God no it was an error she believed it was the error that that's what happened with E and you if you just look at the whole thing with everybody that has done what they've done it was an error I mean cuz where did it come from I mean you had never we've been around here for 30 40 years and everybody just everybody loved the Lovelace words right but all of a sudden error got released in the land the spirit of error and before you know it now we're compromising with the error I'm already gone hallelujah what really got we start compromise we start giving it you know giving up a given ear to it not me I closed my I closed my spiritual womb a long time ago I I'm not a man a man a man he I don't bend that done that got me a t-shirt to tell you where I've been I know what it's like in denomination you're not taking me back praise the Lord Amen not does not to be a member hey man come on somebody emember all right they put that chat all they want to glory to God amen I found something much greener alright listen hey glory to God amen so it says it was an airship leave Satan never come out and said oh well that's that's not even the Word of God that's not even a word of God he admitted it was the Word of God but he put his own interpretation to it which God plainly told them not to do it what does this do so when they put their own interpretation to it it makes a strong delusion for the people to believe a lie and be damned by it now if you want to read it 2nd Thessalonians 2 11 all right as I have as I have about quite a few scriptures here and we won't be able to read them all one now and then I'll give them to you as it hasn't seemed strange that you question it or something and we might put it down and read for your goods now he's gonna throw a scripture he might not read them all but he gone through a scripture and what you need to do is go back and read it alright and as you read it it's gonna be real good he know what he's talking about it's been vindicated and all up sometimes people have no idea but probably the Prophet is preaching by a vision not just no regular preacher here it's a vision gone going forth and he preached about a vision matter ain't just showing him everything that just line it up to make sure we got to stay and rightly divide it so literally say says making a strong delusion as the Bible said it would second Thessalonians now this man of sin would come into existence and set in the temple of God as that what brother trolls talked about last week this member coming to existence said in a temple of God showing himself he was God and cause the people to go into strong delusion to believe a lie and believe it and would be damn fine that's the same thing he did to Eve he never told her the word wasn't right but give her strong delusion that she believed a lie the spirit of delusion is of the devil Devils now working in the children of disobedience disobedient to what once the children of the state disobedient to like heed was at the beginning their disobedient to the true Word of God now that's that's powerful y'all right because Eve miss you know don't eat from that tree right don't either eat from the tree when I was getting the evil that's what he's telling and in fact in this it's plain simple people eat from the same tree today it was not a physical tree it was a spiritual tree and when you're taking google over the Bible what tree are you eating from plainly did not all you're still gonna use Scripture right but it's the spirit of air with the scripture and that's not that's how that's how the devil slip see right there through the spirit of era and people going to not realize that they worship him the devil he died slipped him a lot oh my god he gave him father's sudden the Holy Ghost and they back time to think they doing something we got no hundred baptized the wrong way all right I'm trying to get to this now bear with me so he says here disobedient to what was the rest of children of this day disobedient to life Eve was at the beginning the true Word of God that's right now if you will want to get that let's turn to it the Ephesians two just a minute because it seemed good that we I'll stop just a minute if if you're in no big hurry and read some of this three some of this Ephesians two one two and says in you has he quickened who were once dead and trespasses and stands we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world a to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit now that worketh in the children of disobedience but we're not walking that way anymore amen we're walking according to the Word of God all right let me uh let me go further here aid man I think I want to pick up a scripture at this point in time Genesis 16 Genesis 16 all give us this allegory a man and what an allegory is it's a story a poem or a picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning and man it's a story a poem or a picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning and so when we pick up here a man Paul talking in Galatians about the allegory again in Galatians 425 he says Hagar was Mount Sinai right in Arabia and that's where they received the commandments or they received the law and Mount Sinai but then in verse 26 of Galatians 4 he says Sara a man was type in Jerusalem because she was the free woman that brought forth the promised son and Christ is the true promised son and he brought grace they got law under Hagar but they got grace under Sara praise the Lord that's what we're trying to say here but now let's pick up this because when we start looking at again these women we in scripture we want to think of the church all right we want to think of the church when we look at these women in Scripture now let's pick up let's pick up this now give us is 16 now before we you know just read this first first understand that God has visited Abraham God has told Abraham that I mean here he is 75 years old does not have a child but God tells him that you're going to have a son you're gonna have a son and I'm gonna give you a son by Sarah your wife I'm going to give you a son and so Abraham and Sarah are going on for a number of years on this promise that God has given them and roughly a man 11 years has gone by and and no son has huh right they got to promise 11 years ago and no Sun has come and they're getting older if I could just say the biological clock is ticking and because Sarah's biological clock is now ticking a man she feels the need to assist God right she wants to help God right I know what he said 11 years ago and and I want I want there's some things that I watch ups the first thing I need y'all to see is that Abraham had a son by Hagar whip seeing that you will understand that Abraham representing the father did not have any problems he could have children at 86 years old so the problem was not with father Abraham father you understand that the problem is not with dogs the problem has always been with the church that no one had a problem Abraham never had a problem he didn't even either body changed he was produced in children at 86 let's pick it up these things are written for a reason right and we start looking at this Abraham never had no problem he never had no issue at all and he should have known that you should have known that sooner students instruct a man like oh I got no problem with my body but you know you don't produce this this this wild child you know in all honesty this is where the Arab nations come from Ishmael and God actually promised to I'm gonna raise up you're gonna have 12 boys and you know and they look just you know when you look at Ishmael and Isaac they kind of look alike because there are Isaac line here comes these twelve boys from Jacob right I mean but by age spell also had 12 sons right and instrument' was going to be like our OVA nations and stuff like that too God made him some of the similar promises oh my god but there's a scripture there where I'm gonna try to get to it and read it oh Allah I can't read nothing let me let me y'all give me Genesis 17 let me go there right now Genesis 17 I want you to understand something here Genesis 17 verse 18 look at this 7 Abram said unto God all that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed right God never changed his promise I'm gonna brought Ishmael on the scene but I told you Sarah don't have a child right Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son of deep and thou shalt call his name Isaac John even had his name picked out right amen and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his teeth after him oh my god and as for Ishmael I have heard thee but if the whole I have blessed him Oh y'all stay with me I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly well Prince's shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but my covenant Oh Lord Jesus right uuugh go to this Jensen that search they might have blessings many of them will have blessings they will even feel the power of God they would experience the president god bless my coveted my covenant is not there but he said my covenant will I establish with Isaac we does not looking for blessings we want to come lit right but my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall parent to me at this cent time in the next year you know I'm just going on a little further here she covered it something powerful God established a covenant you know you look at this whole thing amen Isaac was a perfect type of Christ you know we know that so many things that happen kind of in his life Isaac being a perfect type of Christ Isaac Isaac was to someone we talked about this covenant being establish with Isaac I start looking at it Isaac was the one to be sacrificed not Ishmael God say I bring Isaac Ishmael wouldn't know where to be found bring Isaac Isaac was the one to be sacrificed on Mount Moriah not Ishmael there's a covenant in Isaac listen look at this so Isaac is brought to Mount Moriah to be sacrificed Isaac is the one that's packing the wood on his back as they went up Mount Moriah right Isaac is the one that's acting asking his daddy you know you remember it took three days to get the Mount Moriah y'all know about them threes it took three days to get the Mount Moriah and here Isaac is going to Mount Moriah amen to be sacrificed by steady not knowing what was happening and when you begin to ask questions like that and I see the wood and I see the fire but where is the sacrifice and his daddy spoke by faith that God would provide not for himself but God will provide here a sacrifice and a ram came out of nowhere had to stop Abraham from from Lauren his hand on Isaac and Garcia I know that you were you faithful and you that I know that you love me and it's that place where God established the terms Jehovah Jireh our provider right and that RAM that was there on the mountain represented Christ a male lamb hallelujah and by the grace of God God led Abraham to the same mountain that Christ would die on when he came to earth where he gave His life our sins Isaac was where the Covenant was see through Abraham we got Isaac through Isaac we got Christ and we're Abraham's seed because of Christ so that the lineage the Covenant the lineage even I mean where where Christ was going to be born came through Isaac not through Ishmael oh my god there'll be a great people but the promise is not coming through them the promise is coming through Isaac watch Isaac can I put it this way the prom is coming up through denomination but through the pure Word of God rap Jim not coming through denomination through the pure Word of God truth okay can I go a little further God acts for awesome to be sacrificed not Ishmael it was Isaac that packed the wood on his back as he went up and mount I went up Mount Moriah Isaac was the one that was obedient unto death just like Jesus was obedient to death and the Prophet says and through Isaac was the seed of Abraham through Isaac come Christ and through Christ comes you right and the other and I just wrote this down Christ came salvation came Redemption came restoration came through the lineage of Isaac not Ishmael praise the Lord the Covenant was through Isaac alright let's go on back here amen and just pick up a couple things here Oh Lord Jesus alright Genesis 16 now I was gonna read this and deviated remember everyone no problem with Abraham Abraham gave forth he brought forth Ishmael so we know he can have children at 86 if he can do it at 86 he can do it at 100 phrase alone the problem was never with Abraham the problem was always with Sarah and she the one recommended this thing well we came ready to see right now she the one brought this home Sarah's doubt Sarah's compromise and now you know come on now let's just let's just let's get on the scene for a little bit then we got husbands and wives here now if God were to give you a promise as a husband that you know he you don't have face to face talk with God and he said you're gonna have you're gonna have a son and you gonna call his name Isaac and Syrian wife come bare now you're gonna believe that you're gonna hold on to that you're gonna go home and share it with Sarah and you know what you know there's going to be multiple conversations not one this same there's no after the 11 years we've been waiting for you let me hear it ain't nothin happenin and Abraham I believe this is the way God gonna do it I think it took multiple conversations to break Abraham down Oh Lord Jesus cuz cuz I'm gonna tell you if you're not careful it's going to be multiple conversations and they're gonna use that to break you down that's why you got to stay with the word every time and if you use the word they'll stop talking to you they'll stop they'll leave you alone if they know they go get the words but where they are looking for is where than where's the weakness and once we can identify witness then they coming i'ma tell you I don't hear from nobody amen cuz we know you didn't know what they're gonna get you're gonna get the word no no no we ain't got time to sympathize we talked about rapture and we closed it down we ever been praise the Lord all right a priest identified leprosy quick out you can't hurt somebody all right come on let me go over here here in and-and-and-and-and Genesis 16 I want to pick this up because look at this now Sarai Abrams wife there have no children and she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai said unto Abram behold now the LORD hath restrained me from bearing now you gonna put this on God when God made you a promise the LORD hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my Mane it may be that I may obtain children by her period I mean this conversation been happening for a little bit then the Bible say and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarai because you know they've been talking about this for a while and I'm sure he said no no that's not the way God said do it no but no I'm telling I mean Abraham you know when they went ahead he did it and look at this and Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her made Egyptian after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife look at it and he went in unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and Sarai said unto Abram I mean it's already a problem and you know just just at the conception there's a problem all right a problem has already started so verse 5 says if so right-center Abram my wrong be upon thee I have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes the Lord the Lord judge between me and but Abram said unto Sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand due to her as it pleaded thee and when Sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face now let's go on and the angel or found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way up way to shore amen and he said Hagar Sarai's me whence came this down and where the wilt thou dole and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai III I'm you know now there's a lot in here but I'm gonna have to inject this too because we're not preaching this way and I know I got I got I got loved ones that are better that of trap and with the spirit of error right but I but but when I leave when I went when Moses left Egypt he didn't even cows hooked behind and when I'm leaving for a rapture this third Exodus I don't plan on leaving my family behind me and gotta make sure if he meant so he met Hagar at sure God will make sure gotta meet my family at sure glory to God Amen hallelujah allegories types Amen but I'm calling them right all right the bride will not be deceived somehow someway that thing oh I got a quote on here on read it brother Branham saying and somehow someway they sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb and got with his majestic fingers well it unravel all the knots God with his majestic fingers will unravel all the knots so all the questions that they have you might not be able to answer but God can and God will unravel all the knots I'm looking forward to that alright let me let me go on here alright so verse 18 says Hagar Sarai's me which came is doubt and whither without though and she said I plead from the face of my mistress Sarai and the angel the Lord said on her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands now this is where I'm getting my thought from another woman's bosom because Sarah's plan was to raise this child as a home that was Sarah's plan I'm gonna raise you yes I'm gonna give you Hagar and then I'm gonna raise them as my own child right and uh and she didn't realize that the child that was actually being produced was an unattainable child a regenerated child oh wow child this is what you get when you try to help God out right that but if she does that's way too old god she would have got her promise no matter how long it took but she tried to help out and she ended up with this unruhe generated but yet he got some minister to Sarah and gave her child so another woman's bosom I'm carrying I'm producing it I'm doing all these other things and you're gonna have me give the child back to this woman God say I want you to do that I see how i'ma tell you you came when you got some matter with that type of sphere to untamable spirit they not gonna stay around the word they'll leave all right let's go on and read something here for you oh my god oh my god oh and listen I want to go to the scene is not air with the show and this is paragraph 136 oh my so he says see Sara the church handpicked Hagar the church handpicked Hagar it didn't work did it no her hand-picked group won't work today either doctors and PhDs and LEDs don't do it all the carriers fail he says Luther fail as Hagar dent what the hey guard ooh hey God gave her son to another woman's bosom that's right to raise her child Hagar did that gave her circle only Son to another woman's bosom not his mother to raise him so that's the same thing Luther did when he gave his son justification over to the denomination to fool with you get that C so it when you when you when you oh my III mean as a parent I could not take my children's at the nomination neither join up I'd be giving my giving my giving my children to another woman's bosom they get life from Christ all right listen he said so that's the same thing Luther did when he gave his son justification over to the denomination to fool with that's exactly to raise him up Wesley fail the same way as salad did doubting the supernatural birth being the baptism of the holy ghost as Sarah did at the oaktree when Wesley was introduced to the supernatural when the Pentecostal age come on and West was introduced to speaking in tongues and all this they laugh to make fun of it all your Church of Christ and you so call you Baptists see these allegories right says since all you Baptists and Presbyterians and every one of you turn your nose up on it and win away from it right what did you do Wesley you saw your child to an organization and at diamond Parish that's exactly right but the word true where it went right on it didn't stay in that organization to move right on into Pentecost and such some more with it it was more it was a more mature son like the seed that fell into the womb and after a while it started in the backbone then to have lungs and then and have head and feet and after a while it comes to a place it was born that's right so that's how the church has matured the same way so brother Branham this just kind of struck me when I was listening to this message the seasons not able to shut how Hagar when she gave her son to Sarah to be raised she was given her son to another woman's bosom right and brother Branham was bringing it back how the church today went into doubt denominationalism they gave their child to another woman's bosom and and and I want to bring it a little closer to home because here we have this pure unadulterated words and what we're doing is and we got people leave in this pure on the dirt road on adulterated work going back to another woman's bosom mmm and I'm gonna tell you I didn't give my child to that I gave my child to the Lord and I'm expecting Amen the same way that Hagar I'm sorry the same way that Hannah gave her child a Lord God blessed her for that you know it's hard to give you a child to another woman's bosom you know that it's very difficult for a woman that's really in love with a child to just give it to another woman to raise I mean no this is my child I'll take care of that with I'll do that I got that I mean even you know we so bad nowadays because you know it used to be even if somebody back of my day the other people didn't have a right to chastise you but after it says sighs you've got to go tell that mama what you did hello somebody just don't check stop don't say nothing don't and you might get now you know you're not the mama I don't mind your doing what you did but you need to inform me as to what's going on because I I'm mama all right right but nowadays we don't we don't let nobody touch our children right I mean and and and and I understand ever summer needed a little a little pop everyone so let me get surprised let him get surprised standing next to a mother the church is something and say something and you know because you know it was it would hit first apologize later all right they said Wow and it just it just was automatic right the whole neighborhood would whip you right but but you know but and it was okay like that but but you know nowadays we got we got you know other young people rising up Nate you know because they want to go out at night hello had the baby who whose baby is this well if it's your babies your responsibility you're not gonna give it to your mama's bosom mama would you watch my baby while I go out no no no no no no you forgot you're going out days was over you got responsibilities now and if you didn't want responsibility you should've did what it took to get responsibility hello amen keep that baby in your bosom all right let me go on let me go on and but what mothers were really you know mothers that you know they they they look to raise their own children you know they they them they didn't think about abortions and nothing like that this is my child I'm gonna raise my child right but it's not easy it's not easy for a real mother to give her child to another woman's bosom it's not easy right Amen there's even when you a real mother have a problem dropping their kids off at a daycare and back in my day Wayne had no cameras to be watching what's going on at the daycare people can't even get work done got a little window opening in the top of the screen on the computer and they said looking at what's they got they I mean they put that IP address in and they looked right at that camera this with my toilets all day that's a real mother they concerned about their child but you got some others that have dropped that child off and ain't looking at nothing it was a nice babysitting service for him but a real mother is hot for her to give her child to another woman's listen a couple of mothers in the scripture I talked about Hannah that was Stamey's mother she made a promise that if God gave her son she would give that son back to the service of God right she wasn't giving it to another one but she was giving it back to God I remember brother Branham sharing the story of the mother dear and when Burt blew that whistle that old crew hunted he blew that whistle sounding like a little fawn say the mother did just rolls up out of nowhere look the deer look look the the hunter right in the eyes that ain't going nowhere cuz my baby is in trouble so that's the mommy there's one take care of her child and she would face death if she had to in order to take care of a child right also you know I thought about the woman in Berlin and King Solomon's date King Solomon he did they come together with him these ladies and had two children one later and slept on her child at night and killed a child stole the other ladies child put it underneath them and the little I quit my child let you got my child he said no that's my child they just argue and fuss about the child let's go before King Solomon got before King Solomon King said okay I tell you what I don't know which one of y'all right and whose child it is he said I'll tell you I bring this sword and say I'm gonna take the towel and I'm gonna split this child right in half and you can have half of and you can have half of it and one later say yeah that's right split it in half and the other they said no those finish she can have the child if Solomon King Solomon said I'm not to say brother Solomon but but King Solomon a man because he is a king to a man King and priests but they said that King Solomon to keep keep when he heard the woman say no don't doing say now I know who the real mother is because no mother will want to see a child go through something like that the other mother had already killed one child and didn't mind killing anymore he said I found the real mother give it to her see it's hard for a woman to give her child up that's why she was stupid Stalin she wanted to give up she's gonna fight for her child listen to this I thought about the woman in Elijah's day Elijah's date who stopped the product a child had died from a heat stroke and she went running looking for the Prophet you know I thought you told me that I was gonna have a son and you know when you're told you said and all that came to pass but I I told you I didn't want to be let down prophet see what she wouldn't let him go said he's in the house he'll take my rod and go lay it on the chassis no no no no no I'm not ain't got no faith in your rot and I got no faith in your servant but I want you to come you come and see about my child see it's hot real mother when the real mother's like that amen it's hard for her to just give her a child to some other woman's bosom I got one more real mother I want to talk to you about that had to give up her child but not to another woman and I want to read this out of X's 2 verse 1 through 3 says this not bringing home here in a second I cut it all up but I pray that you all receive a meant something today Exodus 2 verse 1 through 3 it says there went a man of the house of Levi and took the wife a daughter of Levi and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months notice this because there was persecution happened at the time that that Moses was born they were looking for all the children we're gonna kill him on every every child that was under two years old every male child they were going to kill but here this this mother is hiding her child three months hiding can you imagine Moses crying for a bottle and when you start crying for a bottle harder the mama trying to get a bottle to them as fast as possible cuz she don't want any finding no neighbor to hear that huh hot Sun is in here crying cuz they might give the secret away that she got a boy in here you can imagine how close they probably got to Moses being discovered look at verse 3 and when she could not longer hide him that's why I said it's very hard for a real mother to give her child up to another woman's bosom but when when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it was slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers bank so uh rivers breathe so here you know yoshi-p I found say I can't I can't keep him no mo if I keep him I'm gonna lose something but if I can just give him back to God then God can do something with her and she gave up her son to the now river not to another woman's bosom but she gave them to the now river and in trusted God parents sometimes you can't do no more than what you can do but once you give them to the hands of God God is able to take up a little further here Moses ended up in amen in an outrigger and before you know it Moses got into that that little arc and that arc ended up down in pharaoh's court they found a little baby Pharaoh's I believe sister found a little baby and and say you know when I'm a raise this child is my own now now Moses mother didn't give her to Pharaoh's sister that's not what Moses mother did but because she gave with a God when she made it when when Moses made it down there Miriam have to see him naked in and when they picked him up out of the you know out of out of this artists and that we need somebody that's capable of actually feeding this baby because ain't none of us had no children right we don't keep them that's our own right but we need somebody to be able to feed this baby and because mothers Moses mama trusted God with hot shock she end up getting a job in the corner Farrow to raise her own child she never gave ourselves another woman's bosom she raised her own child and there's some things we just can't do some things we just can't handle right now but I'm not giving them to another I'm not giving them to denomination I'm giving them the God and when you give it a gaga got a we're giving it back to you I got a couple of things I want to read it yeah I want mine right just give me this I want to read from this quote out of Mother's Day because your mothers that have gone through some things a man and I was thinking to myself there many mothers that could look and see that the families are not where they want them to be but I want to encourage you this morning I want to tell you God will fix it gotta fix it so this is a quote out of Mother's Day that says this then we we see him as we will we see it then we see him and we will not be as we are now we'll know how to love him more will not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him well well he will be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the mortal bodies then then we'll have a body like his glorious body will know how to worship Him and when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deforms straighten out Oh we'll understand then while his power healed us the question that's been in our mind how can he do it what with this somehow mysteriously they all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our will it be this how could it be somehow or another majestic fingers will just untangle unravel those knots see I mean we got some folks in some knots right now but somehow someway majestic fingers will untangle he can do it through a dream he can through it do it through somebody send him a prophecy right he got a way of doing things he can send a dark kick-butt majestic fingers will untangle unravel those knots and it will fade into one big crown of love then we shall see him then we shall be like him then we shall worship Him then we should we shall see mother as God wants her mother this is my momís mother would not be complete there without her family and giving them to another woman's bosom I'm taking them with me mother would not be complete there without her family because the greatest time of all her life is to see the children around the table and all of them healthy and happy and the see her pour the coffee or whatever she does maybe your mama like tea right amen whatever she does and fixes supper and her and dad sat down why that's the happiest time and Mama's life see her kid is all at home don't be missed in that day let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link that every spoke be in the wheel and when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity what a day that will be then we'll understand Church I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to that and I can't wait you know and I just love how God would allow the Prophet to make a statement like that in the message of Mother's Day what an encouragement to the months so I was reading a little something on the internet 21 statements about Mama's and this is gonna be in 21 statements y'all bear with me Billy suddenly said I don't believe there are Devils enough inhale to pull a boy out of the arms of a godly mother Billy Graham said to many women have too much leisure time for their own good they have time for criticism gossip fault-finding and complaining they have time for idle games and laid to much attention to the things of the flesh they there are other women who have too little time for the enduring things of life they are too busy flitting about doing this and that they have great activity and much doing but they lack time for building Christian character both kinds of women to idol that the to idol and the too busy need to take time for meditation and quiet repose and prayer to God they need time to cultivate their souls that in turn they may cultivate their children's lives DL moody said the impression that a praying mother leaves upon her children is life long perhaps when you're a dad and going your prayer will be answered the Billy certainly said there is more power and a mother's hand than in a king scepter Lin Yutang says of all the rights of a woman the greatest right is to be a mother George Washington said my mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw all I am I owe to my mother I attribute all my success in life to the moral intellectual and physical education I received from her I wonder how you got a physical education from his mama and rejection and rejection there never was a woman like her she was gentle as a dove and brave as a lioness the memory of my mother and her teachings were after all the only capital I had to start life with and the only and on that capital I had made my way Thomas fuller for a wife a wife take the daughter of a good mother hello any young man for a wife take the daughter of a good mother if you're looking for a wife but watch up mama if she got a good mama you're probably gonna end up with a good wife for a wife take the daughter of a good mother all right also Booker T Washington says and all my efforts to learn to read my mother shared fully my ambition and sympathize with me and aided me in every way she could if I have done anything in life worth attention I feel sure that I inherited the disposition from my mother Abraham Lincoln all that I am or ever hope to be I owe to my angel mother John MacArthur to be a mother is by no means second-class men may have the authority in the home but the women have the influence the mother more than the father is the one who molds and shapes those little lies from day one a Chinese proverb there's only one pretty child in the world and every mother has it a Jewish proverb a mother understands what a child does not sing our prophet William Branham said when motherhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broken Donna Maddox Cooper said when you were small in just a touch away I covered you with blankets against the cold night air but now that you're all tall and out of reach I fold my hands and I cover you with prayer this author is unknown but it says a mother's love has the ability to forgive even the most difficult child Henry Ward Beecher said the mother's heart is the child's schoolroom Mildred B Vermont said being a full-time mother is one of the highest salary jobs since the pavement is pure love Henry Ward Beecher said again the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother Abraham Lincoln says I remember my mother my mother's prayers and they have always followed me they have clung to me all my life the last thing by our Prophet William Branham says a good Christian mother is a treasure to a human heart that's never forgotten no matter what your children go through they remember mama and at some point in time God come take the majestic fingers and unravel and untangle all the knives I got confidence in that and I'm looking forward to it that's my Mother's Day sermon god bless you all [Applause] what's that word of Prayer your God we are so appreciative of your word and just thinking here on the Prophet Lord just kind of share some things with this and my prayer is that we got would be alive and alert to what the Spirit is trying to speak to us in this hour the mother's father's they have so much that they're going through sometimes a family just get into disarray trying to hold on with everything we got but the best we can do is just hold to your word no matter what we see no matter what we hear we got to just stay with the word because it'll bring it out it'll it'll take care of it it will settle it the word knows and God if we could just be faithful we'll win the battle so Lord Jesus my prayer is that you just help us to to do all that we can a reminder of Jesus when he was on earth Satan came attacking him and attacking him and all he said was it is written it is written it is written and the Prophet told us that Jesus overcame the devil with the word he didn't use any supernatural power anything like that he just used the word that's the same thing that we use in order to overcome the enemy father help us we're not giving our children over to a denominational bosom the Lord we've raised them amen in this word we're going to continue to raise them his word there's there's a great attack against this word and as I was just sharing a little earlier the attack is not on the Prophet the prophets coming down that's not where the attack if the attack is actually on us to get us to disbelieve so God help us to have faith and to hold on with everything we got so we hold to your promises you will bring in the past we don't need to help you out like Sarah did with Hagar we don't need to help you out just let us be faithful and just holding on to you per your blessings upon each mother they would leave here encourage and strengthen no matter what it is that they might be going through with children God made a leave encouraged and know that you will somehow majestically work it all out this is the mighty name of Lord Jesus Christ that I pray amen and amen can we give the Lord a hand a priest for the Solomon you
