even need this key talks about a store that's closed I'm just grateful nothing right you know what I'm done look I'm finna here with this now I'm here with this cuz during that week the first person on contact was brother Troy hurt he was just on my heart so heavy and I went he wasn't there I went to his house he was at home and I was like but the first service I went back I held on the word pastor preached he preached royal priests now the very first service back and you know now the very first time said welcome home and it felt like home and I can really say it feels like home because now I'm not just part of the message so but I just wanted to end with this because to me now everything has to have a point in the purpose and brother Jack read these scriptures and I've held on to him ever since that day but it just meant so much to learn the first message coming out was royal priesthood it says wherefore laying aside all malice on dial off hypocrisy dog envy and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be we have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom he come as into a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious gay also has live installed our middle upon spiritum houses house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted our by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in description behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and have that believe of him shall not be confounded until you therefore which believe he is precious but until them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head head of of the corner in a corner any stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient swear to also they were appointed but he our chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation they could kill you people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light within times past were not people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have pain place the morning certainly appreciate brother Garin and just saw that the Lord is doing why do you stand on Morita a quick scripture and then I'll let you be seated a couple of things I just need to say in and we will move on I'm going to Matthew 18 that's one verse actually Matthew 18:18 ladies our Lord says this barely I said to you what subbing each of five on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and the Lord added lessons reading of his bird let's just pray over the word of dr. my father we thank you for they men the ability to read the work that made a holy spirit not just bring something to us spiritually this understanding here tonight may believe encouraged and strengthened thank you for everything that has happened here tonight and I expect you that would just take control of this fortune or services works in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you can be seated I just needed to quickly to share a couple things with you you know a number of years ago I was I was in church and just a young man certainly going to church but I wasn't saved I wasn't a Christian man I wasn't a Christian I was going to church but I went to a church when I was invited by some friends to church one night and they were playing this movie at the time I believe is called the burning hail something like that and and I went to see this movie and you know when I saw all these people inhale I said lord I don't want to go you know so I need to get my life right and you know that night I went to the altar and I got things right you know at least I thought I'd be all right but uh but by God's grace tonight not the pastor that was a man of that church that night he happened to be sitting here tonight and I'm so grateful a man to see him here tonight [Applause] hold on - and I let it go a man who got swept away with some ups and things there in the world you know but I'm glad he didn't let me drown many he took again a man we're so so grateful and again I want to say thank you to everyone that's come to be a part of these services this has been the first time doing this underneath the tent like this and I feel like it's been a tremendous success a man just the tiniest giving her testimony here just a little while ago and now she gave her testimony and was talking about how the Lord didn't I showed her the pictures around sister steamin called holding act and she was in and inside my happen to be inside and she said brother Jack does that supposed to go to your turn to say yes yes she does to say well I believe you know what she'd just shared and said got a I got a condition here my body and would you pray for me right now because I believe God and so Jimmy is there and other genuinely hands on her appraisal name and unexpected [Music] [Music] start spreading from here four things that happen underneath this tent and you know just I want to quickly a man just share our our our thing a man was light the fire again and you know we took that from a particular pole out in the church age book and you know just something that God's prophet made a statement he was quoting revelation 2:4 says nevertheless I have someone that somewhat against thee because thou has left my first love right and he made a statement are gone alone that he say history keeps repeating itself and the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see fires fading in the next and the third generation members may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and when you look at that that situation it seems very hopeless right because when you get down to the fourth generation there's there's just no vestige of the original flame right the thing that the thing that lit the fire the generation before and the generation after that their fires were lit but but when it got down to the fourth generation which is where we are right now when it when we talk about this message Amen this fourth generation they've let the fire go down right and and and but the good thing about this is that it's not left in that condition because the rest of the crew says then car likes to fire again right so there comes a time where we we will see a man the the the the original flame I believe God can light the fire and that's what this is all about it's just been spotted yeah tell your neighbors just gonna start just man but I'm not going to take too much time a man tonight I want to I want to just focus a little bit on something here III brought this this card with me tonight and man this car represents something here but what what what it happen here we we do outreach there at the church and we had some the place that we go to do outreach we were went a couple of months ago when we were not able to get into the building that we don't do outreach in and they had put a current reader on there and that the door would open less you had a current reader so one of the residents had come down and they just happened to be coming by at the same time we were there and they they said oh we let you in okay but I need to find out how do I get one of those cards myself so I can get in and I emailed the office and they said okay sure you can you know just stop by you can get a card so we went and we got the card you know and the card is what gives us access to the building a man the card is what gives us access a man but but I want to talk on tonight if I can on the subject of override the man override praise the Lord just just bear with me here for a minute a man as I thought about this little thought tonight a man I thought of sometimes our sisters can go to the store a man and shop a little bit and when they they get to the store they get to the clearance rack now the thing about sisters that's different from brothers brothers go to the clearance rack a man they thinking about what they can get right but when a sister goes to the clearance rack she's not thinking about herself but she's actually thinking about the other sisters [Music] dealer price that you just can't pass up social media [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because you just experienced [Applause] so I'll just feel tonight that somebody might need an override spiritually God wants to give you an override and I override a work in your favor but if you seek you need an override if you insinuated overrides hallelujah son I go over to God and when you get the override the override works in your face right I was looking a man at this story in John chapter 5 this is the story of the man that was sitting at the Pool of Bethesda yes and and you know everybody can't give you an override the cashier wouldn't have been able to do it right the cashier didn't have enough authority high enough power but but the manager had the ability to be able to give an override right and as seen let me let me also just kind of drop this off because the definition for override a madness is the use of one's authority to reject or cancel a man is the use of one's Authority or and another another definition is to interrupt that action typically in order to make to take it to manual control right so if it's an automated device and you interrupt the action in order to take it to man control because you want to override the automatic action hallelujah glory to God either yeah I think everybody here if you have not experienced the Lord Jesus as your Savior you were going in the wrong direction one day but he gave you an override he walked up with a little bats and he took a strike and your life been different ever since because the override always works in your face you know I mean I just I just all the testimonies that I was here here tonight Saints that experience it overrides glory to God glory to God I mean when brother Gary got his job back that was an override when sister Tanya went to the doctor and she told her doctor you know pretty much before you touch my body this thing gonna be taken care of [Laughter] [Music] illumise from our watch everything looking at this this man and you know we know the scripture tells us here that he was sitting at this this Pool of Bethesda let's read it after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is that Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches and these lay a great multitude of impotent folk a blind hawk with it waiting for the moving of the waters so the process is to wait for the angel to come down in trouble of water and history tells us that when the waters were troubled the first person to jump into the waters was the person that was healing okay but let's go on here verse 4 says for the angel went down at a certain season into the pool and trouble the water who said with in first after the troubling of a water and stuck I stepped in was made a hold of what sort of a disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 in eight years now the key thing I want you to understand that this man has been in this illness longer than Jesus has been alive this man has been in this condition for a great many years right so so so here you know we can see verse 6 says when Jesus saw him live and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto Him wilt thou be made whole now this is a personal conversation with the Lord Jesus now let's just keep on reading he says verse 7 of the impotent man asked him sir I have no man when the waters trouble to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steps down before me right so first he's saying I need help for somebody to help me but I'm strong enough to counter do some things on my own right so so the problem is the man didn't know who he was talking to right so jesus said to him rise take up thy bed and walk now at first I said then immediately the man was being hope and took up his bed and woke and on the same day was a second and when I looked at this man's condition being there 38 years with this condition and all the times that the angel told no water this man was never able to get into a magma water and have this situation taken care of whatever the situation might have been this man was never able to get that accomplished but when Jesus showed up on this day and being the talk directly with this man what Jesus did was buy a pass process right here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to change his name you just think about your own personal testimony yes the window the override this what I call the grace college as we all have experienced it we all needed it the man you were we were all shaped in sin right we were we were born born us in shape to the knick with it we came into the world speaking of life and if you say you didn't come that with you man right now but we need a grease we need an override Jesus Christ is the only one that can give us that look how happy that the cashier can't handle it I need your manager yeah cuz your manager got a set of keys your manager got a coach just type in there and when your manager finish this thing don't change my doctor came to it but I knew Jesus my words could be words but I knew Jesus it gave me override I want to tell you something this override is something that every generation can experience parents if you're believing God for you for you and for you for your children maybe they've walked away from certain the Lord a man named baby you just don't give up on nobody you never know when they gonna get the override car but I'm reminded of the story of had it right and how had it right had given some money in the offering and God's prophet decided to go back and give him out of money saying no she shouldn't she shouldn't give that lady way too poor to have to give money like that and I she said I he said I'm gonna go back and give that lady this $20 this you know within a depression and I'm gonna think this lady should be cheating that she she she's lost a husband yeah just she got way too many responsibilities giving $20 in the offered a I'm gonna give it back and as he was on his way to Holy Spirit told me say now when Jesus was on the earth and he saw the woman coming two pence that he stopped her from giving her two pigs he said no no no he said well if I didn't stop her then don't you stop letting down he says okay okay you know I won't stop and he went to the house and set out and and had a little meal and they said no until God has dropped down in that place where people's face was inside the place we need another Norton right but their faces were in the plates and that was they were in the place just sitting there and he was telling the testimony of how God had allowed him to speak a couple squirrels into existence and rather than a Hattie right criticizing Hattie right said that's nothing but Ruby say the same God that provided a ram for Abraham it's the same God that provided squirrels for me and as lessee said he said he had it and I said that's nothing but the true receipt I'm not too sure if they had it right thus saith the Lord what ever you acts for right now you can she looked around she saw a sick parents she saw sister that was there I've been praying for many times that had been healed and said whatever your acts was she was poor I said whatever you asked me I said what should I ask for sad you say I can't tell you what that's why I don't know I don't know what to tell you x-ray said but I do know this much that whatever you act for you gonna get right now whether it was a million dollars she could have had it right then you know and the Prophet couldn't tell her what to ask for right and I'm so she said she said she said well what what I don't know what to ask when she looked around and she solved but two points and then two boys was sitting there just give them yes laughing unconcerned and you know they eat with a tremendous anointing like that they sitting there laughing alright but here here here here too you know they say whatever you ask much so she look that she looked the sar-21 just say I got something I wanna add stuff on they say go ahead and act and you have it right now she said I want the salvation of my two boys she asks for something internal yeah I want the salvation of my two boys and right there on the spot [Music] [Applause] [Applause] listen to be overwritten yeah your sickness can be over there your condition can be overridden as Jesus Christ wants to give you that tonight that's what like the fire again is all about I'm going to accent the musicians coming Advanta me we want to just give opportunity tonight before we go there's somebody here tonight that brother Jack I need that I need that override your one tonight may be in sin but you want to walk out on the devil and give your heart to the Lord Jesus he's here tonight to meet you here tonight in urine sequence and won't hands laid on you because the Bible tells us that if we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you can have an override tonight before we leave this place we want to

down underneath his tent Oh God that I walked out on Satan and no longer a man of my bounds that's the bet that lifestyle but tonight I am a new creature because Christ has set me free why they say
