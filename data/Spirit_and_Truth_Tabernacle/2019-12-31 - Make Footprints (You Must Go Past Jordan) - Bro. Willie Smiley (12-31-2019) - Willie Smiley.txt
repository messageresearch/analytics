========================================
[Music] praise the Lord how the musicians come at this time if you always just turn in your Bibles we'll just open tonight this portion of service amen go back to 2nd chronicles chapter 20 I'll just finish reading from there praise the Lord God is good god is good god is good man 2nd chronicles chapter 20 amen verse 3 it says in Jos have I feared and said himself to seek the Lord and proclaim to fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah that came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Lord before the new court said O Lord God of our fathers are not thou God in heaven and rule is not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee so it's art not thou our God who ditched drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel and gave us it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein and have built the essentially therein for that name saying if when evil cometh upon us as a sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee and our affliction then thou wilt hear and help and now behold the children of Arman and Moab and Mount Sierra whom thou wouldest not let Israel in vain when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not he's just reminding god of his promises says behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of our possession which thou has given us to inheritance o our God would thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but eyes are upon thee and all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children then upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah the son of an ayah the son as I yield the son of man an ayah a Levite of the sons of a staff came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye o Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you a man be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's a man he says tomorrow go ye down against him oh they come up by the clip of zzzz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Jimmy well you shall not need to fight in this battle set your sails stand ye steel and see the salvation of the Lord with you o Troodon Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against him for the Lord will be with you it goes on the Santa house affair bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the habitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of color of the core Heights stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and this is 2nd chronicles 20/20 says and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of the court as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so young so shall you be established believe his prophets so shall he prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed fingers unto the Lord and that should praise the beauty of his holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the Lord for His mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord Amen singing to praise the Lord set ambush myths against the children of our mom Moab and Mount Seir which were come against Judah and they were smitten for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an in what help to destroy another and when Judah came toward the rocks towers in the wilderness they looked into the multitudes and behold there were dead bodies falling to the earth and none escaped and I love this and when Joseph and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches when the dead bodies and precious Jews a man with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off of themselves more than they could

many years ago father and brother Jack on a Friday night we was on our way to church talking about the things of the Lord and before we could even get this far the enemy tried to take us out on a rollover accident the car was totally demolished but we came out of it Lord God almost unscathed just from bruises on one hand so we just thank you tonight Lord God thank you for the little things that you do for us Oh God things that sometimes we are mindful and we just appreciate you appreciate the Saints from Bible truth coming out and being in fellowship tonight we pray that father we could say something to be encouraging in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen amen man let us get our Bibles out tonight we want to look in the book of Joshua we appreciate being here kind of at the lab brother take sign he would say hello I didn't say nothing I was I was cut I wasn't kidding about that but I thought I would uh I thought I'd get that out there right quick you know I love the fellowship and I enjoy I enjoy brother Jack and I enjoy you all and I don't mind going but I I like this folks to come and shout on our carpet also so y'all give me one second hey I'm just trying to find something right quick we're gonna be reading from Joshua chapter one tonight it's also good to have my wife and two of my kids with me tonight the other four adults and they just living in different places just keep them in prayer just to came by and satisfy the day it was good to see him and his wife today we want to started Joshua chapter 1 verse 1 it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord speaking to Joshua the son of nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people until the land which I do give unto give to them even to the land to the children of Israel every place that the soles of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the Great Sea towards the going down of the Sun shall be your coach there should not be any man be able to stand before the all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake in thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall of our divided inheritance the land which I swore until their fathers to give them only be how strong and courageous that thou may observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turned out from it from the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper with so ever thou goeth this book of the law shall not depart out of our mouths but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may us observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not a commander to be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou shalt go I thought I'd keep that jacket on but I'm starting to sweat I want to use I want to use as a little subject it's something that we priests on on Sunday morning and we trust that up we could be a blessing to you all tonight Saints that that hurt hurt me Sunday y'all just pray for me y'all might know where I'm going to you might not know you just never know where you're gonna go once you get anointed I want to use as as a a topic make footprints and just as a subtopic you must go past Jordan but B I want to maybe just for a few moments just lay a little foundation and trust that the Holy Spirit and just lead us tonight and help us by His grace I was telling the same song I was telling the Saints on Sunday morning I said you know I'm starting to you know watch people and look things and and it's it's becoming troubling because what you start finding here is a lot of times I was reading a young fella I kind of known him for a long time and you know and reading some up some posts I was like it just is just seeming like people are getting to a place where they don't even believe the Bible anymore we're trying to mix scripture with you know our own understanding which despite what sense for us not to lean to our own understanding that right is you know God is his own interpreter then right we we know the Prophet he preached the message God being his own enterprise yeah interpreter he interpret his word by bringing his word to pass you know when he spoke in Genesis he said let there be let there be the manifestation was the interpretation God interpreted his own word by bringing his word to pass right you know whatever God says he's gonna do that's what he's gonna do I don't be a little slow for a minute but I will pick up some steam out them in a while and but what we find it is is is you know the intellectual mind is trying to change God's thinking right if God if God says it's going to be a rapture there's gonna be a rapture if God says this there's gonna be judgment upon the earth that's gonna be judgment upon the earth right we could we could look back in Scripture and see where once the people got themselves to two of us a spot where they they no longer wanted to heed to the things of God and got promiscuous and all of that God gave them my opportunity and then when when he was turned down and rich was rejected what we find is is that God Amen judgment like in the days of Noah right he said he sent judgment upon the earth right so you know one of the things in the hour I feel even even I'm thinking about a statement that the Prophet made in his ministry he said the angel told him or God or having my being I don't have a quote I'm just kind of you know top of my head he says if you could get the people to believe and you know he you know the rest a sane understand before you things of that nature but you gotta be able in ministry to get the people to believe believe the word right right I mean getting the people to believe the word right amen that's key you say well that's simple it's not simple it's just not as simple as that because you could look at the history of Scripture and see where people don't believe the word right right and sometimes sometimes even you know you know the word being in its simplest form you still find people not believing right I will say this I think God for predestination tonight I think God for the foreknowledge of God I thank God for being in the mind of God before the foundation of the world amen all of us ought to say amen to that tonight because of you if you was not a part of God amen back then and it's mine right you'll never be a part of that right and that's no injustice because God places every individual on free moral agency right and give every man choice right every man is given a choice whether you will or whether you won't that's up to you I made my choice I made my choice to follow Jesus you know they say I'm going all the way just to see him alright the one who suffered and died from me I'm starting to feel real good tonight Amen I hope y'all came to have chest so to me that's that's him that's very very very very important it's getting people to believe that the Word of God not new just the words of a man but the Word of God we know man is is God's ancient yeah right like like Moses Moses was God's ancient yeah Moses was God's mouthpiece to the people yeah is that right ain't been you know one time on Mount Sinai God spoke to the people they said oh no no no no no no we we don't want him to speak to us like that that was just too much for Humanity God thundering amen on the mountain and everything you know that's just too much that's okay okay you know I'll give you a veneer I'll make another Avenue I'll anoint a man and and he'll he'll be my voice right Moses Moses was was the the the the voice of God to the people is that right so y'all got wait me that's far I'm turning I'm trying to get us to see something tonight this it's important for us all right if we're never gonna be victorious if we're ever gonna overcome it's important for us to believe the world emotions is fine as much as I enjoy shopping as much as I enjoy running around the church right I realize you know were selling the same I remember when when the children of Israel pharaoh and finally let the children of Israel go and and you know they got to the Red Sea Moses had already prophesied that you know the the enemy that they saw they won't see no more things of that nature and they got to the Red Sea they panicked they panic and realize that the enemy the enemy was they didn't realize a man it was a satyr they didn't realize Amen that God was fulfilling his word right those wasn't just the words of a man those was the words of God the prophecy on the lips of a man the enemy you see you won't see him no more after this this it'll be all over you would have thought they'd believe seeing all of the supernatural that had taken place amen in the beginning the frogs and the fries and all of their all of those different types of things the Death Angel moving in the land and and and and you know Moses telling the pilot token and just all of those different things you would have thought that they would have believed then I have enough confidence not necessarily in the man but in in the voice the words that was spoken through the lips of the man right they come out and they realized man they came out they was probably happy that was exciting right you know going along and they got to the Red Sea all right not really knowing God's plan Moses was following the leadership of God lead leading the people right and and they could look back and see the enemy coming behind them right didn't know God's plan fear feels a killer to the church right amen but you know what God showed himself mighty in the Mint's drownded the enemy y'all with me tonight drowning the enemy according to promise right see what they feel my understand from the beginning because of a prophecy God had given in Abraham there were people of promise marrying them marrying and the sisters limb that grabbed the tambourines you know sometimes we come here the sisters get all excited they be grabbing tambourines and running all around the church and everybody be shouting and things of that nature all right right then the very next trial God already showed them he was on the scene to prove his word the prophet priest message Amen proving his word right God the whole scene was God proving his word right he's all Abraham your people are sojourn in a strange land you know for a specific amount of time he said but i'ma bring them out by mighty hand right a man did didn't he was God did it with Moses his mother I mean you can see the plan of God unfolding itself right in my head you can see the plan of God unfolded itself even when when when Moses was a runaway prophet God was still in the midst see one thing about it God's Word cannot and will not a man come to know whatever God said Amen he's able to perform it it can't fail I'd rather be standing on the Word of God tonight cuz we know this is gonna pass away but the Word of God it will not fail is that right glory to God you could you could see the vindication of God's word God interpreting his word right God proving his word amen God sending Moses on the scene amen was was God proving his work Amen God keeps his word we different we as human beings we don't always keep our word all right right please come up I'm not hitter you know I'm a pretty some victory tonight but it is what live with our best in Texas a lot of times we we just can't keep our word right hey man but that ain't go God God God keeps his word right God definitely keeps his word and then but what we find is right like we say you you would think that people would just automatically believe the Word of God with all of the supernatural and you can see it through the history through the ministry of the Prophet things of that nature right people don't just always just believe the Word of God we cry we shout we do all of these different things but then the moment pressure comes the moment situations come we lose sight on the word of God is that right right glory to God the children of Israel they saw God in their myths right got right out there and and and you know they needed a little water they started complaining they had the smitten rock that Cassady just minutes Moses's ministry was it was a ministry if you just study Moses as minister right and it wasn't it wasn't Moses but it just showed you where a people of promise of people that should have believed to Amen the Word of God did believe the Word of God is that right right because every time they was faced with a challenge they rebelled they complained a journey that shouldn't have took him about a short period of time end up taking them years why it was because of the the unbelief right it was it because of God cuz God keeps his word because one cannot fail if God's got a raise up a whole nother charge we go in some with us do that that's gonna keep his word if God say somebody's going over into Canaan somebody's going over the Cana right but if you look at if you look at I'm gonna kind of go back and forth and maybe I'll pick up 2019 and tie it all in here and we were gonna run out of here tonight Jesus but y'all just stay with me if you if you if you look at if you look at Moses as Minister I was I was just kind of I was kind of just thinking about some things and thinking about Moses is ministry I was like man Moses his ministry was just so filled with rebellion right right all right the rebellious people right a ministry that you know no no real order trying to get the people lined up in an order and this one raises up oh you ain't the only holy man who made you some Authority got some Wang Ali out there so I'll stop I'm going somewhere right but if you look at his ministry right and you would think with all that the people were seeing they would have had a trust they would have had a confidence in Moses and just followed Moses his ministry seeing the power of God seeing it the cloud by day and you know fire by night and all of that but man that minute streamed it with them o fighters and and and just all of that man it was terrible it was terrible for a group of people right it was so bad Moses was so so Zechs right with with the people that they caused Moses to see but you but you just got to thank God for the sovereignty of God I mean Moses were lost in that but its gesture just to show you you know what was happening right in in a ministry and you see this a lot of times in ministries it's got to accomplish right it's got to accomplish the thing that is set out to accomplish right in the midst of all of that God was you know God was raising up a church that I believe right supernaturally right right Amen when you find that people will not believe gamma-rays a folk that will be leaving that's description you're right no matter how much I believe it is dad's gonna be some people that's gonna believe the Word of God right right amen there's gonna be some people that believe the Word of God see amen see God God's gonna prove his word man God's Word cannot fall to the ground right Moses that calls Moses Moses to to to sit Moses God in the flesh but it shows us something a man in ministry also right it's important for us to allow God to be in control of this was also right cuz cuz most got soul that see good man you bunch of devils shut up you know you know he start getting the flesh that I realized and what about him it was God it was it was God being the provider sometimes we get lifted up we think it's because we're smart because we're educated because we've gone to school in education it Amen not have a job educated people will skid row your finest a lot of focus educated with no jobs and no money come on Moses got beside himself Hey you bunch of Devils it's like God like whoa whoa whoa Moses but you know what that that's the humanistic part of a man right but but it shows us something because you know we human beings as shepherds come on y'all breeze with me yeah I mean we're human beings Shepherd's but we gotta realize a man there's a colony and it's so important for us not to get in the flesh no matter what right because you get offended you get hurt right you feel step down that's that's the human part but it's still amen you know it's important for us to have the right kind of character to try to do the best that we can I'll keep going y'all like y'all keep praying for me I'm trying to get out of here right sometimes you find Shepherds they they get to a place and then they get the fighting and fussing and you start losing the objective when you start doing that right it's our job in spite of of everything to try to lead the people amen to a rapture is that right it was Moses job to cuz we find the difference in to two parts coming out of and going into their right amen and see you know as long as as long as they were just kind of going round and round and round and round y'all got to quiet about that wasn't that was it the promise being fulfilled being in the desert right disorder rebellion that wasn't the promise but God is smart God is smart - now see God God wasn't going to allow all of that to go into Canaan y'all don't oppress with me now Chloe God allowed him to walk and walk and I'm old fighters that with all of that unbelief when a lot of that stuff dad off right then God took Moses right amen God took Moses and he says okay watch this shift right watch watch the change that was getting ready to take place right amen after Moses Moses goes off the scene now now God start to deal with Joshua right right cuz let's keep something in mind God keeps his word right see you know we meet we coming out of old another year and listen you know 2019 was was a difficult year I don't know what it was for y'all but it was a difficult year for me right it's sometimes it felt like kind of time to make the donuts at times time like you know y'all Floridians y'all know what it's like to get stuck in sugar saying you get stuck in this fed and no matter you know you feel like you go up you go back you put it in Drive and you try to hit it and just bar down you put it in reverse you hit it it's just part down and you keep on trying and you keep going up and back see Jess for you thank you for the get out amen you get stuck go back you think you better get out of this situation so you get stuck again and then you get frustrated and you get vexed and then you just stop it and the more you stop it the more you go nowhere the more you hit it you hit vex you get out to you walk around it you wanna keep the Holy Ghost at your head your vet stuff right but then you know what God always makes the way God God you know one thing I realized God keeps his word and proves his word in the most simplest ways in the simplest things sometimes this is something simpler other day a wife was going somewhere in a taxi lady came to pick up and later the back that we got a little walled in my driveway pyrite is here even me I know it's there I will try to back up because you can't hardly see it I always do a three-point turn so I could just drive out straight cuz I'm in Ireland I'd have been I've been where she was so you know I learned and but you know what a neighbor came over he had a strap I ain't had none to pull out with really and he came up with he said game with a little pool that's God sometimes I saw we need somebody with a strap hook up to hook up to the car and pull you out you know it was the pulling out time for the church glory to God God tells tell Joshua how much time my god [Applause] Joshua God speaks to the Joshua he says now after the death of Moses my servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake and adjustable the son of nun Moses Minister saying write Moses my servant is dead now these this this next verse is so key right right amen cuz goddess keeps their Scott to keep his word yeah right the people got to go forward they were going nowhere for about 40 years right they wasn't going nowhere it was like the Prophet the promise was that way right and God had to keep his word yes see he says now therefore arise right it's time to move go over this joy you know Jordan represents death right Jordan you know it so it was so important for the the Church of the Living God to dock to the past right Moses Moses was dead upon them forty years right amen it's like God was saying that's finished come on church amen rise up now when you cross short and that means you gotta leave all that behind you write all of that failure thousand years of just whining and complaining all that kind of stuff it's like man you know crossing Jordan means that you're going over into a new experience right new times but joy listen Jordan is a place where you got to die you got to be willing to put all of that behind you put it all behind you it's a new season now right it's a it's a new season it's a new day it's a new time fresh experiences right come on fresh experiences where we're headed towards what God has has promised us right hey man go cross joy it's a must right you let's go cross Jordan right it's a what's better what I meant is proceed to be better come on see because if you look like you know Moses yet it came out right thanks listen they got the complaining so much about me and and you know like people with people in church a lot of times where they be like where the past ain't I ain't getting fed the man feed you so much to you you'll just get sick me come out your ears and you gotta find a hole dumb excuse we tired it's like bread right we tired that's a selection people sometimes you can't please people [Music] hey there light bread that wasn't enough they wanted me gods like oh come and get you off so much me y'all ain't gonna know what to do with this meat come on y'all preach with me somebody sometimes the pastor trying to give you exactly what you need but we feel like that ain't enough daddy is exactly what you need exactly what you need see you know one thing I've learned running Jack over the years right people people want all of these mysteries and stuff because mysteries don't deal with no life mysteries just kind of it's from here did the make us the make us puffed up to make us feel like we got something that we could go in and fight and beat somebody down with right come on but what we need is something that'll come right because that's what the mess is supposed to do we need we can quote what he said but can we live what he said [Applause] some of y'all got a better memory than me I could probably quote some of this stuff by Batum I can't but to me that's not that important I understand thee the gift is the ability to get myself out of the way if I could get out of the way God can speak God can say some stuff God can do some stuff what he said rise up right a man and go pump Jordan right the wilderness is Fitness going around and all the rest is that's finished that's done with right listen church if we ever go to rapture night it's a lot of ways we could preach this right is a lot of ways like a priest is all right I can preach the three stages of his grace is a lot of ways which I'll just stay with me right where people transitioning how many say man today we're people that's moving we gotta be moving so we it's like no more just wandering around in the wilderness up and down all this unbelieving you know disobedience rebellion and it's like okay we gotta we gotta rise up we got to go cross Jordan right this was a this was a different group of people this was a group of different group of people you know I look at this church a lot of the faces I see today some so we got some old-timers you you always have some Caleb's all right come on you go you go have some Caleb's at stake true yeah hey man you're gonna always have them but it was it was a new group that I raised up it's not okay Joshua amen the promise still got to be fulfilled so right the promise to be fulfilled so Joshua Moses is dead those things is dead this is a new day this is a new time listen I want you to understand something but the same way I was with Moses I'ma be with you to say was we true because of his word in the mists of everything that Moses went through all the ups and downs and ease it out with mouse I want you I want you to be strong and courageous just like I was with Moses I'm gonna be with you what this is powerful I just you know what I can trust this I can't trust a whole lot of other stuff I can trust the world he says listen my foundation was for a reason you gotta believe what God has said he said I will never leave you nor forsake in you people silence and no challenge I will never leave you your pocket no money in your pocket will never leave you I won't leave you I won't forsaken you right dirty god that's the thing what God has said I won't leave you I won't forsaken you period you can trust in that you can count on that you can count on God will you can't count on me glory to God I'm feeling like preaching now amen when you can't count on your brother with your brother ain't got no money you can still say I won't leave you I won't forsaking you won't be alone you see sometimes we feel like when we going through something you you oh you ain't never by yourself first of all the Bible say he campaigns is about them that fear him gosh I ain't gonna leave you are you go forsaking Oh see that was God the nice sister burrows keeping his word God keep brother try say other two cars they might have didn't have God so that's why they caused was all too long [Applause] Oh God says that's my child away all

Jordan right all these people until a land which I do alright give to them listen church dad already knew that it was a land their right Moses sitting a group out Caleb and Joshua and a bunch of unbelievers they grapes so big not have mercy I just kind of can't imagine that to me it took to me an epochal how could you walk it and believe how could you come back and say we like we like grasshoppers when God said listen there's a land sit some men over there and experience it and tell them to come back and give a good report to gave a good report Oh - Tim gave evil reports thank God for Caleb to tell the other just shut your mouth fried y'all just shut up right you would think but just just think you have to thank God for predestination right Amen with the twelve all of the experience they saw the land right they had the grapes and then come back and say we can't do it right they see they were the ten was looking at human instrumentality I mean we should sing that song all the time when I first got saved right oh my he says Amen I giving it to him third verse every place that the soles of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses right now why it's a quote from God keeping his word he says the Lord thy God is with the West though so ever I'll go it that's comforting right I need that as a shepherd I need that as a man I need that in my everyday life right amen because we you know we faced with we faced with just different things right things could be going good today you could have a job today and you might not have a job tomorrow right he says no matter what it is how hard it is how great that obstacle is that doesn't even matter right if it's down to the value of the cells of death the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou go with right it don't matter how you know 20/20 it might get dark sometime but it don't matter God is with us right with women we're moving towards something right you know what church I don't believe this is the year just going around Toledo just going around in the same old service right amen amen I believe in fresh experiences for the year cuz see you got it you got it you got a lead 20 19 behind right you got a holiday you can't sit around in 2020 and try to figure out 20 19's mistakes and and challenges and all of that you just got to say man let bygones be bygones I'm looking to cross over it just some new experiences right I might have some new battles but I already know that a man he's promised there never leave me not forsaken me see I'm connected to a promise amen he says oh how oh how Joshua will cook all Israel together sit stand here and watch the glory of God watch see - we be too busy depending on man look into man and that's that's why we don't go nowhere we don't experience the kind of victory that we we should be experienced it's all about some great preachers right mister prophet he said watch the glory of God I could say that too right what's the glory of God now I'm a believer now y'all don't y'all don't have to believe y'all could go out of here tonight you know in unbelief and mind battles and and all of this stuff man 2019 is done for me right I'm crossing over into something new something fresh some victory come on he said stand here and watch the glory of God watch this God is with his word amen I like this God made the promise God is with his word all this is about God right just this is God's plan tradition this is not a maze book right come on this is God's book God use Manitou to write but this is God's book this God's book of promises God's book of redemption God's will to the redeemed glory to God he said God said to Joshua every place that the souls are your foot sets that's yours right that's right huh every place that's right now now I'm not a high school graduate I know we got some College grass here some smart folk here but I'm smart enough to understand every place education to understand every place glory to God every place that the soles of your foots scent was this that yours but can we believe that God made the promise God already said what are you gonna do he already said is yours but can we believe that we're really smelling my solace again can we believe that right it's yours I'll give it to you right he said if it's for salvation if it's for healing if it's for more blessings if it's for anything they watch this that God promised the God promised right make footprints see this is our problem we don't take no steps see you gotta keep his word you got apply to your life right if he said every place that the souls that don't mean you can stand still see God God is ready outside of the Saints God be sitting sitting back like he be getting like he be like oh my god what I'm just I just can't wait I just can't wait to do it but they won't make a move they won't make a move God be sitting there picking his teeth yeah you know you know how you get an impatient impatient child or something be sitting there like oh god mama come home come on dad that's kind of like God like take the word see it's almost like the profit of guy he was he make made a little statement I was thinking about this he was saying he could have a dream or vision or whatever it might be of a certain thing that's gonna happen he says but you know what if I had supposed to be over here he can't go put it over there it's got to be put there amen by another way right he came even though he saw he like this hat is out of place this hat need to beat it but he can't do it see God has given us the promise right amen God has given us his word but see this is us and then we start complaining to God and I feel like man going on any cherish come on glory to God and God said but do

neighbors say Happy New Year - yeah every new year happy new year make flip press [Music] make footprints [Music] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus if a sermon was not for anybody else I know it was for me tonight just a couple of things Lord Lord Lord knows why he has certain things to be said and which testimonies he wants shared at what time and and everything and you know the Lord blessed us in 2019 with with a business and I know the Lord will if he blessed us he's blessed us with employees and all kind of thing and I said Lord we just need some old customers and and I have to go from pretty much one place to the next place just trying to introduce the business to people and let them know what we do and everything and they're what we call cold visits but as a believer I walk into the visit with a particular scripture in my heart and that scripture is that wherever the soles of my feet were tricked Goff said he gave it to me so I just say Lord I thank you for the customers that end right here and I thank you for giving me customers right here god hallelujah so I'm going into 2020 making footprints you got the step on it if you want it to be yours come on somebody you you just can't sit back and do nothing you got to step on it if you want it to be yours hallelujah good God Almighty you're looking for our house you'd better step on it you looking for a car you better step on him we're looking for a business to be blessed to better step on it oh Jesus a mansion it's something that we got to do with all of this right and I just don't think God just saying say things just to be standing brother brother smiley said something that was very powerful yet so simple says it's just hard to get people to believe the word it's all God wants you to do just believe the word [Music] and I'm gonna tell you all something that that testimony shared about sister Nellie you know just we are we are we're holding on believe in God for y'all everybody here heard church next door yes and we have to have service like this all the time it just is just be overflowing it into the sanctuary place and the way that the landlord here in this this is just place has done it they bring all the churches and put them in one little corner and we got to try to you know over-talk one another with this music and everything else makes it very difficult sometimes very challenging now I know God uses a man our being here for his glory even heard actually surrender what was her name sure yeah she said to tell you how she was a high school classmate of yours and she said tell Gina I said hi so I'm telling Gina she said but you see I saw on Sunday and we were just fellowship with a little bit and and before she could leave out of our presence she said you know in some skirts be walking out of that church I say huh it's some skirts be walking out that church praise the Lord I'm glad that they notice it right God God God have us here for a reason we understand that said but Lord you know we praying and believe in you for something more in and what you've done for us over the past couple of years we can't help but believe you for the impossible somebody had text me on Monday and they say you know that church that you believe in fun it was just so we keep our faith ain't man in God until till God say otherwise and brother smiley coming here tonight he didn't know that that happened right and he come and share this testimony about somebody that had a cash offer i'ma taste them if God got something for you then God got something for you and ain't nobody can step in and take it from you so I'll say I believe that well I'm holding on to that and I'm just gonna believe words [Music] I don't know what's gonna happen between now and then but I'm sure I add more to the testimony I just I'm just making footprints that's all I can do hey man I just I appreciate that so I don't think I don't think God spoke these things haphazardly I think God had a way of encouraging our hearts just just only believe Church no matter what it is that you're facing only belief I didn't know the extent of the damage to my mother's car I didn't know amen and they said that the other cars were worse off but when I heard about the accident I was actually already praising God in advance for her new car I was already thinking God in advance for her new car that's the God we serve right amen amen amen man so you know it was a Satan you can have that you want that you can have that God got something much for me phrase alone and I'm gonna be driving that to church we're gonna going somebody you know we gotta learn a man to just worship in the midst of whatever we going through you know why because all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Church before we leave tonight I just wanted to read a quote over you and they meant also a scripture if I can brother smiley was kept referring to this and I just felt it appropriate to read this the scripture I want to read actually not the quote first of scripture gonna be first it's got to come from Philippians chapter 3 as we press into 2020 a man thank God for 2019 but not yet sweet at twenty glory to God verse 13 says brother and brothers brother smiles tell us that we got to forget about what we went through in 2019 and then move on into 2020 don't worry about the things of the past but let's move forward and gone and the Bible says brother not counting out myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before and I love this is not gonna be easy but we press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus amen I'm gonna press search I'm gonna press I'm gonna press I just want to read over you the redness the last two years and one thing I have one thing I have noticed is that as I've read this quote of the church God has done exactly what the quote see is a man and I'm believing God never born again this years we read this over you from the message Revelation chapter 4 the Prophet preached this in 1960 amen on a New Year's Eve service it says so many is glad and so how many is glad and happy the Lord spared you through another year say here we are coming up to the end of the ribbons and pray that God will forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings since now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and blissful and healthy that I can wish to you he says copy with you may you grow both physically amen and spiritually come on and financially glory to God and materially everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do is speak those words over you church be blessed physically he'll be blessed spiritually he'll be blessed financially and you will be blessed materially hallelujah let's pray father in the name of Jesus how grateful we are Lord for bringing us into this new year thank you for the trial and every tribulation that you gave us victory over in 2019 but as we have faced 2020 we realize Lord there'll be new trials but God the season has changed the way the Word of God was brought to us tonight we realize a man that the season it changed it was time for Joshua which represents the Holy Spirit to take the people over into their promised land and father as they were entering in the promised land it wasn't easy he had some battles that they had to fight they had to fight they many had to walk around jericho and and you brought the walls down low but they had to make they had to make four footsteps Lord and as they went to fight I you gave them a strategy that that worked oh god and he defeated I what when it came time for Joshua to speak to the son they were at work in battle so father you realize that to do the miraculous when we get busy for you know dawn hallelujah so we're not gonna run from the trials we're not going to complain about the trouble but lo we're gonna learn to worship you and the list of whatever we're going through we believe you Oh God and we got confidence in the cop that we serve Thank You
