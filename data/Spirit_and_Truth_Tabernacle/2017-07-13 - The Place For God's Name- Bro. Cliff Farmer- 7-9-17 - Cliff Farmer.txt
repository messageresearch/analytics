Thursday night I did this one free seven sport last night it doesn't feel good why I live with mobile design travel roads and why she put social to receive to Google and otherwise we go build why in fact I think something that like Oh still does it make sure both other guys come on because that's really um got it make sure we've got time if you know on I anniversary last yearís oh that's old sir Chester went out together align amends ten years of that compares all right but we've been very 33 years I only go once we got it yeah it's good to be here with coral snake I was tell me that it's a good just well guess we'll read gone we gonna read your way good run with chapter 16 just kind of an honor to be here with yet man all the preachers listen town why do you think me around 16 and one observe the month of I did and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God for in the love of a bit the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by nine that's how therefore sacrifice the Passover ensue the Lord God of the flocks and I've heard watch this in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name then you can receive just the thought that it kind of come on bit yesterday be crucial before but it just sit there know yesterday this really came strong only so this is what we're going to do this morning all right or preach a message this morning I want toilet the police for God's name the police for God's name I just for a minute I want to do a foundation because I you know I don't believe that there's any word of Scripture that is written just to be written all right I don't think that it was written by chance but I believe that every word of God is for a reason I believe every word the brother Branham said it's for reading another thing we didn't say this when I found this message the search was over all I remember when I found this message there was no more looking I'm not looking for another message I'm not looking for another project I got what I needed I got what I want everything I have full rapture give me and within this book one of the word enough the times wider he say observe the month of so the month of Abib is the first month but how much of a bit is the fourth month all right you see what I'm just angry at you okay the fourth month for us would be the month of April but it is the first month and so when you look at what it says the first month is you go back into grief in the table it's the scripture on the table sir you go back and it must be a bit clearer the meaning is the month of gear for me so what we realized is that we'll see this place and then the month of ear forming begins the next month the seas have reached on the end of March the sea has a big place to begin the fourth month which was written at worst mark which was the month of the year but the [Music] from the [Applause] breach the token this is the month that you can begin to hear understand see this but people didn't know what he was all these we can open up the door and the night after the absolute this is the beginning of the eighth month brother Brandon breaches the wedding ceremony [Music] this scripture takes us observe them up with Amira this is from the first month after the seed is read and it ends in verse two innocence overlordship choose to please his name the prophet of God took us from just a seat all the way to the marriage supper of the wild was papal different became he says they called basil was spiritually minded by election like we said this is so great thank you in your branch does not even desire 17th verse 1 and when Abram was ninety years old and not the Lord appeared on the table instead of the hill I and the Almighty God what would you do if somebody walked up to you you've never seen him before then should I and the all-mighty God but y'all are the old mighty God that's six into this building this morning yeah how excited are you Church you know I would search you like the guy or you don't watch again but it doesn't it told you all some did you vote for me no these are my I don't care my Air Force one helicopter is comin to your backyard and I'm leave supper at your house now you know what I asked this at my church you know what they said is exact we would tell you know offered you a lot you [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] oh my god walk before me and be that perfect he didn't say what with me all right okay come over even properly he didn't say follow me okay he didn't say what the Sun yeah before me I didn't ask you that's the letters Abraham they own this place and don't let him say as for me the whole night woman is with E and F is watching you [Applause] [Music] the search page [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Abraham's [Music] time that was a good chair and they had the CIA the board they had I don't know the item whatever for the Golden Gods Britain they had everybody looking for and they couldn't find him and he was just sitting there yeah we're done and you know something that nobody else knows so God has changed your name to the I guess top it's a witness protection program I was looking to scripture the other day when it says he shall happy in the time of trouble you're happy in just forbidding now look at that word hi because I think of hide in the pavilion like he's covering you up but it says the meaning of the word hide it says to hide away as a treasure away from anyone who would see it God's looking at you like a treasure at this point and so he's hit you in a place what the devil can you do you say my brother he's been fighting oh yeah he goes by yeah but he don't get you all right crazy man the manager says we're from the big checker God's looking for him out and please the adoption of morning it changed his name from Abram to Abraham Abraham comes from the word elahh him got some name he associated his name with God's name God is Elohim how many know that the great Jehovah the oldest efficient on the self existing one and what did he do he took the ATM of his name and placed it on the Abraham saying because he was Abraham God is the father of all and Abraham is the problem nations Rory L AM father of all Abraham father of Nations Racing position arey he said that after his church received the Holy Ghost after they went through the testings now far we don't like we don't like Texans I don't want but you know I was doing through some let me to think I try out a second move see sometimes we hear the preaching and it all sounds good that sounds great but sometimes we just get down and talk about some real stuff yeah we all get ready to quit yeah so you would probably surprise you disappointed if I told you to call me the truth a month ago rojack I said I said you see me excited this morning do you see me happy but a month ago I set my masterstroke we was sitting outside the church now some rotated I'm quitting oh he said you couldn't what I said well not God so I'm quitting preaching well y'all looking really go hand they was no sin in my life all right well I was tired I was weird I was worn out I said those days are getting tougher go buddy I said I'm traveling [Applause] my favorite dessert food all right amen so what in the world like no you got your wife every day sir here's the problem when we get in that place and we're ready to quit we saw refusal divorce of encouragement I went through such a stage of depression that I wouldn't answer any phone calls and I told my wife I said no one inbox me over no one I've got an Intel I got a friend on this whole earth some of the friends I had both friends walking away from this message the only fella shake my head with a watch this message and now they're walking away and I'm wit I give up Master said well what you going to do did you really think you can quit because everything he said you quit you'd be the most miserable man in the face of the earth but we don't want to be tried but we don't want to be rude [Applause] the boss I work for now he's up I voted one time I said you know what I said you're good you're good at boss I said I won't say I said you are as brutal as a you know what he told me then it's the first six months that I worked for I hated I mean I could not stand them in because nothing I could do was give up and it was about the end of six months he called me in the office he could all talk to you for them he said I've been pushing you for six months I need to know how they call my office because our store was was doing better on a percentage how they restored was doing better than any other store in the country we got about 200 stores so they called him in to talk and say it for usually and he said number will relate on a few ground rules that he was doing he said but let me tell you one of the biggest reasons I am we're on that and why our company is worth that he said my assistant is the best in the company online and he was saying before the vice president the president all these people in the company and he said my assistant and this morning I was going through some things and I came here and the Lord gave me a message this is last year in October I went home and I preached it and see every every person in this church is important whether you think you are like I said I'm slowing down just to get really from him you're important whether you feel if not I preached this message at home and I call though Jackie told him about it when we got through my pastor said to the book didn't he said now once again I was young sorry talk about me okay but my pastor was the book that he said I've never heard anything like that before he said that his maturity he said that men could speak to that bad has built this church so I called rojak I said well Jack I got to tell you this I'm going to give you some credit I said I preached the message at home I put and people are still to this day coming up through their telephone that message and I called Oh Jack I said I got the inspiration set in your office and until you have it then you want to preach a note it was just a load [Music] [Music] okay she loves me back be still and know that I am God yeah you know when you take that word you searched me but I know I do a little bit like this when you break it down but at Scripture we just take that word and it says this piece of your beating you in your place for you to be in that [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] this course many an array about the Spirit of God they are the sons of God where you have not received the spirit again a bondage again to fear but he have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry oh man I never even heard that songs when we started out the old so the spirit itself bears witness without fear that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ you sent me that we certain reveal that we may also be glorified together what I recommend the sufferings will just read the time I was going to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and we're sufferance is misfortune calamity the afflictions listen to this that Christians don't brood for the same cause which Christ feared he said why am I going through this affliction the same reason he did why they spitting in my face the same reason they didn't email why am I being crucified on the job crucified it's true everything around me for Giovanni because he was who survived will bring a resurrection in your personal life the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory and that we're glory says it means the kingly Majesty of the Messiah God most around you has a king and you should worry about with a hemophiliac Rahman you still wonder if the insurance will get paid you so learn if you have a child overcome well I represent with me in my song in a place of power when I make this statement he said after we overcame before the foundation of the world he said when the angel what your name is you wrote with you know weird rubber roller play music in Pikeville and your old neighbors book Genesis 32 24 I'm not finished and I'm I love that

see this fall we see this failure God's looking at you and saying you are Prince well who is a prince a child of the king I'm gonna try one of their relations for ones that now I say that that error as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant don't meet the Lord of all understand when you just in that stage of challenge you are still Lord of all let's come on to work with us yeah somebody raise your hand it feels like you uh you're the weakest Christian in the church everybody any goodness the one who raised your hand alright your Lord Baal [Music] you wanna word this one you go to the bar I said I feel I feel we took me alone I feel about you our Lord o all power is within you see here's the thing there's no authority there because of the child but everything is yours but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world that was this guy this guy was bound you know some made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law now that was Jesus lady was Jesus again there goes the bullet sometimes 1963 he put a little man in the photo see anything clear time was full run out and was little man back there ever again for what the law written through the halting other a real word and because ye are sons God hath set forth the spirit of his son into your hearts cry well somebody say ah I am no more no more I'm certain this ain't work you ain't coming to church and it being work you and chemicals [Music] he said when you knock apart the blood and what if Jesus Christ were dead God's chosen place of worship he said safety live only in the place of his choosing in the Lamb and in the name of the Lamb no it was a Maryland man he got a fair amount of church see when his name not her name what was he going to meet the people with under was now in her name but in his name the way rejecting this message is rejecting your sacrifice rejecting your land but he said that the provided place of worship was in Jesus and yeah I don't know if y'all placing it back here but not in re right now we're facing where they say no more suppose Jesus he goes to the Father forgive me for dime not to use but that's I thought really Ukraine was like so appalled leads down the trial right hold up her dog I know where it goes but when Jesus come to his adoption he looked at him and he said when you see me you've seen the father it was when she just come to the place of adoption the only body on earth that God was dwelling in was that woman so when that man was the only living representation of the Spirit he said when you see me you've seen the father alright gonna move I thought y'all kind of with over the time so when a man marries a woman he places his name upon that woman so if I was to say when you've seen me you've seen my day all right me and my dad is that a meeting together my dad mom will settle in front of me yeah my wife right here and I got a little nervous happen I do i I'm used to playing music and I fight really gets hurt I'm preaching on all the hands are always blue and understanding that it's kind of white shirts I
