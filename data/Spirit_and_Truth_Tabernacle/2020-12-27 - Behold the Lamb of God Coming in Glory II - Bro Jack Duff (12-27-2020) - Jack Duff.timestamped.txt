[53:06] having to deal with you know testing
[53:08] positive for
[53:09] uh covey that was not my death sentence
[53:15] all right and and we need to know that
[53:17] the devil can't do no
[53:18] more than what god allows him
[53:22] i was i was i was uh listening to a
[53:25] brother
[53:26] brother eugene braun he was speaking
[53:27] this week and
[53:29] he made a statement he says you know god
[53:31] actually controls
[53:32] both sides of the equation
[53:39] i just want you to know that he said now
[53:41] it was god
[53:42] that had a promise in scripture to say
[53:44] i'm going to raise up a deliverer
[53:47] for my people in egypt and i'm going to
[53:49] send moses
[53:50] god himself was sending moses into egypt
[53:54] god gave him supernatural signs that he
[53:56] could use when he went down there to
[53:57] egypt
[53:58] but because he works on both sides of
[54:00] the equation god also told moses i
[54:03] will heart in the heart
[54:08] i'm gonna harden the heart of pharaoh he
[54:10] can't do this on his own i got to do
[54:12] something for him
[54:13] to make him do what he do so i'm gonna
[54:16] harden his heart and i'm also gonna send
[54:17] you i got both sides of the equation
[54:20] all i'm trying to let you know is that
[54:21] all things gonna work together for goods
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] it's going to work together for good it
[54:30] may not feel good but it will work
[54:32] together
[54:33] for good hallelujah
[54:37] when you just when you just relax and
[54:39] just let god be god
[54:42] all right amen i'll tell you that the
[54:44] devil can go no further
[54:46] than god allows
[54:49] amen amen
[54:53] i praise god all right
[54:56] all right so uh that was free
[54:59] i just want you know god working on both
[55:02] sides of the equation
[55:04] both sides all right um
[55:08] uh the other thing i meant i mentioned
[55:10] to y'all
[55:11] after that powerful service that we had
[55:14] i say now the devil don't like this
[55:17] and the devil gonna attack i told the
[55:18] church i told them before
[55:20] the attack even came but i also said
[55:22] we're going to have a victory
[55:24] and do you know that you know the devil
[55:26] went right after the the shepherd
[55:29] why does he go after the shepherd
[55:31] because the sheep will
[55:34] praise the lord right but the devil lost
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] we on the winning side we're not going
[55:44] to be defeated
[55:45] these brothers picked up the ball and
[55:47] just kept going i said praise god
[55:49] advancing the church so we we thank god
[55:52] for all things amen god is god is in
[55:55] control
[55:55] church and he brought us through 2020
[55:58] and as the
[55:59] the lord terry we're looking forward to
[56:00] come through 2021 as well
[56:03] amen all right all right so i want to
[56:05] just read a scripture here
[56:08] from the book of john amen chapter
[56:11] uh three we'll just read verse 26
[56:14] through 30.
[56:29] um the bible says
[56:32] um and they came
[56:37] unto john
[56:41] i said unto him rabbi he that was with
[56:44] thee beyond jordan
[56:47] to whom thou bears witness now we we we
[56:49] we're not reading this again today but
[56:51] we for the last few uh sermons
[56:55] that preach on uh vendor uh
[56:58] vindicated truth we talked about how
[57:01] when jesus came to john
[57:03] in the water to be baptized in him jesus
[57:06] was actually vindicating john's ministry
[57:08] by coming to john
[57:10] uh they had questions for john as to who
[57:12] he was and by jesus coming to john it
[57:15] vindicated
[57:15] john's ministry but by also that that
[57:18] act
[57:19] occurring uh john was vindicating who
[57:21] jesus was
[57:23] okay and uh so here you know these
[57:26] people
[57:26] they called it they were there at church
[57:28] they saw what happened
[57:30] they saw saw jesus come to john
[57:33] and came unto john and said unto him
[57:35] rabbi he that was with thee beyond
[57:38] jordan
[57:39] to whom thou bearest witness behold the
[57:42] same baptizer
[57:45] and all men come to him that means ain't
[57:47] nobody coming to your church
[57:50] nobody coming to your church no more
[57:51] john your ministry is dried up
[57:54] praise the lord and and he done stole
[57:56] the members
[57:59] praise the lord see this is what this is
[58:02] what they're trying to create a problem
[58:03] but watch john
[58:04] watch john jonas and said a man can't
[58:08] a man can receive nothing except to be
[58:10] given him from heaven
[58:18] you yourselves bear me witness that i
[58:21] said
[58:21] i am not the christ but that i am set
[58:24] before him i told you all that
[58:27] and then and then then i love this he
[58:29] that hath the bride
[58:32] is the bridegroom so it
[58:35] the one that's that got the bride that
[58:38] that's the bridegroom
[58:40] it says but the friend of the bridegroom
[58:44] which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth
[58:48] greatly
[58:49] because of the bridegroom's voice this
[58:53] my joy therefore is fulfilled
[58:57] [Music]
[58:59] john goes on to say this he he he
[59:02] he he praise god
[59:06] not me me me me me but he
[59:09] he he must increase
[59:13] but i must
[59:16] hey glory to god it's it's it's got to
[59:19] happen i
[59:20] must decrease so that christ can

[1:03:19] eliza had to go get a bride for isaac
[1:03:23] amen so brother brandon's ministry was

[1:03:26] isaac to jesus christ
[1:03:30] because he is the real isaac bless it be

[1:03:40] have a ministry in genesis 24.
[1:03:43] your ministry is to water the word of

[1:04:40] scene giving this information and
[1:04:42] telling the church we're looking for him

[1:04:46] two together amen
[1:04:48] since we believe he will come that is
[1:04:50] according to his word
[1:04:52] it will be at the end time which it is
[1:04:55] time
[1:04:56] now for to see it he will be correctly
[1:04:59] dedicated to the word
[1:05:00] as they have always been indicated by
[1:05:02] god's word
[1:05:04] and the vindicated god will
[1:05:07] vindicate what he preaches to be the
[1:05:09] truth
[1:05:10] when god takes a picture with him and
[1:05:12] amen and now they got it there in
[1:05:14] washington dc that's god vindicating him
[1:05:17] amen every time at the end of a sermon
[1:05:19] he's calling out these different
[1:05:20] conditions of people
[1:05:21] that's god vindicating him you know
[1:05:23] vision after vision that was fulfilled
[1:05:25] god vindicating him
[1:05:26] praise god all right uh he says um
[1:05:29] um god will vindicate what he preaches
[1:05:33] to be the truth
[1:05:34] as he did elijah for it is elijah coming
[1:05:37] make him ready for the mount zion
[1:05:39] rapture
[1:05:41] elijah coming making ready for the mount
[1:05:44] zion
[1:05:44] rapture praise god he says um
[1:05:48] jesus said in the last days it would be
[1:05:50] like lot's time
[1:05:53] and uh you know that's just where
[1:05:54] homosexuality is completely out of
[1:05:56] control
[1:05:57] and and we're there amen
[1:06:00] you you television watches
[1:06:04] praise god when you turn on your
[1:06:05] television and you know
[1:06:07] you got one you turn it on praise god
[1:06:09] it's the truth in it
[1:06:10] you see them commercials that they
[1:06:12] presenting nowadays i'll be sitting in
[1:06:14] the restaurants and they had a tv on and
[1:06:16] i'm i'm like wow i mean they they it's
[1:06:19] blatant now
[1:06:21] right these these the homosexual
[1:06:23] relationships are just blatant they're
[1:06:24] making our kids see this type of stuff
[1:06:26] they used to hide this type of stuff now
[1:06:28] it's blatant all out in the open
[1:06:30] it still don't mean god's accepting it
[1:06:33] i don't care how many laws you pass to
[1:06:36] try to make
[1:06:37] man accept it you will never get god to
[1:06:40] accept it
[1:06:42] amen hallelujah glory to god
[1:06:47] all right so he says um uh in the last
[1:06:50] days
[1:06:51] uh it would be like lot's time his
[1:06:53] preaching will be with the spirit and
[1:06:55] strength line
[1:06:56] of god's word because so much has been
[1:06:59] called god's truth
[1:07:00] many will misunderstand this true
[1:07:02] messenger i god
[1:07:03] wrote here p r o p h e
[1:07:07] c i mean a p h e c prophecy
[1:07:10] because uh because so much has been
[1:07:12] called god's truth by
[1:07:14] fakers many true ministers will
[1:07:16] misunderstand that messenger
[1:07:18] well let's go on this is and and and i
[1:07:20] just love it because the
[1:07:22] by by the angel lord telling the prophet
[1:07:24] to pick up his pen and write
[1:07:26] the angel was writing prophecy and it
[1:07:28] said many true ministers will
[1:07:29] misunderstand the messenger
[1:07:31] we are seeing that even today true men
[1:07:34] of god that god has used
[1:07:37] their ministries have been a blessing to
[1:07:39] the people but
[1:07:41] now they're forsaking the word of god
[1:07:42] because they
[1:07:44] misunderstand
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] they misunderstand praise the lord amen
[1:07:52] so
[1:07:52] you know they misunderstand the
[1:07:53] messenger and i and i
[1:07:55] i have to tell people this the message
[1:07:57] is not bridges
[1:08:01] the message is not bridges that's not
[1:08:03] why we follow the message because some
[1:08:05] men fell off a bridge
[1:08:08] that's not the message right the message
[1:08:12] is not about a bear
[1:08:15] that is not the message if that's what
[1:08:17] you're looking for you have missed the
[1:08:19] message
[1:08:20] but the message is the revelation of the
[1:08:22] word of god
[1:08:24] that has contested us out through the
[1:08:26] mouth of a prophet
[1:08:29] that's what we're following amen it's
[1:08:32] the revealed truth of the word of god
[1:08:34] hallelujah amen glory to god i i wasn't
[1:08:37] there to see
[1:08:38] no bear i'm probably not gonna ever be
[1:08:40] there to see a bear
[1:08:41] so that don't bother me at all that
[1:08:43] that's that's his personal testimony
[1:08:46] and god dealt with him personally about
[1:08:47] it but that's not the message
[1:08:50] there's nowhere in the scripture where
[1:08:51] god say uh look for a bear
[1:08:54] look for a bridge that ain't even in the
[1:08:56] scripture but i am looking for an elijah
[1:09:01] praise god hallelujah to the lamb of god
[1:09:05] he says but uh many true ministers will
[1:09:07] misunderstand that messenger
[1:09:09] as the end time prophecies will repeat i
[1:09:11] believe
[1:09:12] as the first forerunner came from the
[1:09:14] wilderness and cried
[1:09:15] behold the lamb of god the second
[1:09:18] forerunner
[1:09:19] will probably do the same by pointing
[1:09:21] now look at this
[1:09:23] the second forerunner will do the same
[1:09:25] by pointing the people
[1:09:27] to a word born brought
[1:09:31] now you would think the second four
[1:09:32] runner would actually point the people
[1:09:35] amen uh to something else maybe it was
[1:09:37] maybe maybe this quote would say
[1:09:38] something like the second forerunner
[1:09:40] would point the people to jesus
[1:09:43] hallelujah but actually if you really
[1:09:45] look at the quote that's exactly what it
[1:09:47] said
[1:09:50] it said word born bright
[1:09:53] word is capitalized in the beginning was
[1:09:57] the
[1:09:58] and the word was and the word was with
[1:10:02] god and it also said the word w-o-r-d
[1:10:06] became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:10:10] now most people want to leave it only at
[1:10:13] christ
[1:10:14] but the word has also become our flesh
[1:10:19] and i want to tell you something it is
[1:10:21] dwelling among us
[1:10:22] right now we ain't waiting for it to
[1:10:24] come it is already here
[1:10:27] that's why the prophet points the people
[1:10:30] to a word born
[1:10:31] bright he's talking about you this
[1:10:35] morning
[1:10:37] look at this pointing the people to a
[1:10:39] world born the bride of christ
[1:10:41] will be pointed to the skies at the
[1:10:44] appearing of jesus screaming behold the
[1:10:46] lamb of god
[1:10:47] will come forth from his lips god help
[1:10:50] us to be ready for this near event
[1:10:51] i better leave it from right here and i
[1:10:54] just you know quickly
[1:10:55] i want to go back i gave you some things
[1:10:57] last week but i want to repeat them
[1:10:59] today
[1:10:59] because i got to point the people to the
[1:11:01] word born brides
[1:11:03] i need you to know who you are you're
[1:11:05] not here by accident
[1:11:07] you're not here by chance you were

[1:12:24] certain germ that's in the sperm
[1:12:26] to strike the egg and when it strikes it
[1:12:29] brings forth
[1:12:29] life man you are a miracle you're not a

[1:16:35] glorified in his presence positionally
[1:16:38] placed here on earth
[1:16:39] for a purpose to do the will of the will
[1:16:41] of god you see your position

[1:16:46] that your name was
[1:16:46] indelibly wrote amen with the blood of
[1:16:50] jesus christ because
[1:16:50] when your name is wrote indelibly that

[1:16:54] it cannot be erased
[1:16:58] i want you to get that your sin can't

[1:17:25] the works of the devil let me go on here
[1:17:28] a little further amen
[1:17:30] uh i want to uh
[1:17:33] just bring a couple couple thoughts in
[1:17:36] my god this is out of the message
[1:17:38] proving his word
[1:17:41] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:44] says now we see now we say he's raised
[1:17:46] from the dead
[1:17:48] i didn't say it the word here said it
[1:17:51] they said he raised from the dead he
[1:17:53] says he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:55] forever
[1:17:56] you believe that he promised these
[1:17:58] things to happen in the last day
[1:18:00] that the same son of man will be made
[1:18:02] manifest
[1:18:03] now remember that was not jesus
[1:18:07] talking to abraham there that could
[1:18:09] discern the thoughts in sarah's mind
[1:18:11] behind
[1:18:12] him that was not jesus see he had not
[1:18:15] yet been born
[1:18:16] but it was a man in human flesh
[1:18:20] that abraham called elohim the great
[1:18:23] almighty
[1:18:25] jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:18:28] sodom now watch close
[1:18:29] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[1:18:31] the coming of the son of man
[1:18:33] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:18:36] hallelujah amen not no more as a church
[1:18:40] see not no more i say the bride is
[1:18:42] called see
[1:18:43] in the days of the son of man will be
[1:18:45] revealed what to join the church to the
[1:18:48] head
[1:18:48] unite the marriage of the bride
[1:18:52] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:18:55] through
[1:18:56] this now bridegroom call goes back to
[1:18:59] amen matthew
[1:19:00] 25 i believe that's uh brother brother
[1:19:02] troy hit a little bit of that
[1:19:03] amen where you have these these ten
[1:19:05] virgins five were wise and five were
[1:19:07] foolish
[1:19:08] now they all had lamps
[1:19:12] read the bible they all 10 of them had
[1:19:15] lamps
[1:19:16] glory to god the problem was
[1:19:19] a man that when they lamps went out
[1:19:22] they didn't have extra oil amen
[1:19:26] they were all pure they were all
[1:19:29] virtuous
[1:19:30] and as far as living is concerned amen
[1:19:33] but the one the one the foolish ones
[1:19:35] was missing something hallelujah now
[1:19:38] brother branham tells us that they were
[1:19:40] missing the holy spirit
[1:19:42] glory to god we can go a little further
[1:19:43] than that and say you know because the
[1:19:45] holy ghost
[1:19:46] uh is also the vindicated word
[1:19:51] the amen the holy ghost is also the
[1:19:53] truth of the word of god it's not just a
[1:19:55] feeling on your flesh
[1:19:57] but when you truly got the holy ghost
[1:19:59] the holy ghost agrees with the word
[1:20:02] why does the holy ghost agree with the
[1:20:03] word because the holy ghost
[1:20:05] wrote the word
[1:20:08] amen amen the holy ghost ain't going to
[1:20:11] disagree with what he wrote
[1:20:12] oh hallelujah somebody
[1:20:16] amen the holy ghost gonna say amen to
[1:20:18] his word that he wrote
[1:20:21] so when you got the holy ghost it will
[1:20:23] cause you to come in line
[1:20:25] with what the word says
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:28] not just a feeling on your flesh amen it
[1:20:31] goes beyond that
[1:20:32] my god his word is spirit and life
[1:20:36] all right all right all right now stay
[1:20:38] with me here the bridegroom call
[1:20:41] right uh be ready because the bridegroom

[1:21:00] you to catch that the job of brother
[1:21:02] branham

[1:21:07] this is why the bible says amen uh
[1:21:10] uh the hearts of the children will be
[1:21:14] turned to their fathers
[1:21:15] that means our hearts are supposed to
[1:21:18] fall in love

[1:21:21] supposed to do that
[1:21:24] watch it now watch it watch these things

[1:21:33] together
[1:21:34] oh glory the church has to be the word
[1:21:38] he is the word and the two unites
[1:21:40] together and to do that
[1:21:42] it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:21:44] revealing of the son of man
[1:21:45] not a clergyman i don't know uh do you
[1:21:48] see what i mean
[1:21:49] it's the son of man jesus christ will

[1:45:18] and said a man can receive
[1:45:20] nothing except to be given him from
[1:45:22] heaven ye
[1:45:23] yourselves bear me witness that i said i
[1:45:25] am not the christ
[1:45:27] but that i am sent before him he was the
[1:45:30] forerunner
[1:45:31] of of jesus first coming he was a
[1:45:33] forerunner
[1:45:34] according to malachi chapter four god
[1:45:37] would send an elijah
[1:45:39] amen there were two one was going to
[1:45:40] turn their hearts or the fathers to the
[1:45:42] children
[1:45:43] the other was going to turn the hearts
[1:45:44] of the children to the fathers john's
[1:45:46] ministry came
[1:45:47] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:45:49] children look at this
[1:45:51] john says um i'm sent before him he
[1:45:54] that half the bride is the bridegroom
[1:45:58] it says but the friend of the bridegroom
[1:46:01] which standeth and heareth him rejoi
[1:46:03] heareth him rejoiceth greatly
[1:46:06] because of the bridegroom's voice this
[1:46:08] my
[1:46:09] joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:46:12] now i just wanted to break in just a
[1:46:14] little bit on that friend
[1:46:15] of the bridegroom amen john john was
[1:46:18] identifying himself
[1:46:20] amen hearing the scripture say i'm not
[1:46:23] the bridegroom
[1:46:24] but i am a friend of the bridegroom
[1:46:28] hallelujah amen now
[1:46:32] i just picked up something off the
[1:46:33] internet here
[1:46:35] uh there there's a this article's titled
[1:46:38] an eastern wedding feasts i won't read
[1:46:40] the whole thing
[1:46:41] amen but just a little something to
[1:46:44] inject in here
[1:46:45] jesus referred to his coming as a
[1:46:48] wedding feast
[1:46:50] in several places in the gospels uh to
[1:46:53] grasp
[1:46:54] his second coming one needs to
[1:46:56] understand the prophetic portrayal
[1:46:59] of the eastern wedding feasts all right
[1:47:03] now he says a wedding in israel
[1:47:06] was a joyous occasion
[1:47:09] that could last as long
[1:47:12] as a week a wedding in
[1:47:15] israel was a joyous
[1:47:19] occasion that could last as long
[1:47:22] as a week now a week has
[1:47:26] seven days praise the lord somebody
[1:47:31] amen and what god sent us was seven
[1:47:34] church age messengers
[1:47:38] we are in the seven church age called
[1:47:40] out of it i should say
[1:47:41] amen so we're at the close of the day
[1:47:44] now hallelujah
[1:47:45] if a week lasts seven days and a
[1:47:47] marriage lasts for seven days christ was
[1:47:50] marrying a
[1:47:51] gentile bride the seven church ages was
[1:47:54] to the gentiles
[1:47:56] hallelujah we are in the marriage right
[1:47:59] now and this
[1:48:00] is a joyous occasion
[1:48:04] hallelujah let me go on amen it says our
[1:48:08] community members
[1:48:09] prepare with prayerful expectancy not
[1:48:13] only because their regard for the couple
[1:48:15] but also because each wedding symbolized
[1:48:18] the cleansing of sin for the nation of
[1:48:20] israel when they as a body
[1:48:22] were to be married to their coming
[1:48:24] messiah my
[1:48:25] each aspect of the formal preparations
[1:48:28] represented a part of their time
[1:48:30] um part of their entire redemption it
[1:48:33] was such a significant occasion for the
[1:48:35] community
[1:48:36] that some prepared by fasting
[1:48:39] when they whenever they get married when
[1:48:41] they get married in israel some of the
[1:48:42] people actually prepare for the marriage
[1:48:44] ceremony
[1:48:45] through fasting look at this they
[1:48:48] prepare by fasting
[1:48:49] prayer and washings hallelujah now i
[1:48:52] want to skip this and go down to this
[1:48:54] other little section
[1:48:55] they said now um my glory glory glory
[1:48:59] says the parents of both the groom and
[1:49:02] the brat
[1:49:03] in the eastern culture the marriage
[1:49:06] plans
[1:49:06] included three distinct stages now one
[1:49:10] of these stages they say the first was
[1:49:11] the arrangement
[1:49:13] that's the first stage the arrangement
[1:49:15] of the marriage
[1:49:16] my god now look at this statement
[1:49:18] parents
[1:49:20] could make the arrangements for the
[1:49:23] marriage of their children
[1:49:25] before the children were even born
[1:49:28] glory to god in the eastern amen
[1:49:31] traditions
[1:49:32] parents would sign a contract
[1:49:35] saying my son will marry your daughter
[1:49:37] when they get of age
[1:49:39] before the children are even born they
[1:49:41] are already signing the contract that
[1:49:43] they will be married
[1:49:44] and what i'm trying to say god
[1:49:46] predestinated
[1:49:48] before you was even born that you would
[1:49:51] be married to him
[1:49:53] oh hallelujah ain't no
[1:49:56] devil can stop this because the devil
[1:49:59] didn't start this
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] before you were born you were already
[1:50:06] married
[1:50:08] so that's why when you leave here you're
[1:50:10] going to the wedding supper
[1:50:16] you you didn't you did you didn't
[1:50:17] stumble into this i mean this
[1:50:19] this message by mistake glory to god
[1:50:23] glory to god now i want to i want to i
[1:50:25] want to uh
[1:50:26] just just just just say this it says it
[1:50:29] was exceptional
[1:50:31] for the bride and groom to meet face to
[1:50:32] face before the wedding feasts
[1:50:34] the easterners believed that the love
[1:50:36] between a couple is set in motion
[1:50:38] during the final exchange of the ten
[1:50:40] pieces of silver during the wedding
[1:50:42] feast
[1:50:43] and that their love is more like a
[1:50:44] predestined
[1:50:46] divine union between a brother and a
[1:50:48] sister
[1:50:49] it says the dowry to be paid by the
[1:50:52] father
[1:50:52] from the household accounts administered
[1:50:54] by the mother of the groom to the family
[1:50:56] of the bride it's also negotiated during
[1:50:59] the arrangement period so
[1:51:01] you know now in our in our uh culture
[1:51:04] we don't have dowries but sometimes in
[1:51:06] some of the the um
[1:51:08] uh the saints from africa they do have
[1:51:09] dollars hey man you gotta pay something
[1:51:11] for that young lady
[1:51:13] now y'all most young men ain't gonna
[1:51:14] waste their time
[1:51:16] if they ain't got no dowry praise the
[1:51:19] lord you're gonna have to pay something
[1:51:21] amen they try to make it very very they
[1:51:23] want that fellow to
[1:51:24] to feel it the decision that you make we
[1:51:27] don't want you to just
[1:51:28] up and leave it one day when when when
[1:51:30] when things get tough
[1:51:31] so we're gonna we're gonna hit you in
[1:51:33] the pocket
[1:51:35] praise god amen right i mean yeah
[1:51:39] you're gonna have to invest in this
[1:51:40] wedding praise the lord church
[1:51:43] hallelujah glory all right so now i want
[1:51:45] to just kind of bring this this next
[1:51:47] little paragraph
[1:51:48] in it says um now
[1:51:51] let me let me just keep reading it says
[1:51:53] um uh the diary to be paid by the father

[2:01:08] i want to just read this last quote
[2:01:12] oh jesus maybe i might have time for a
[2:01:14] couple more let me just read something
[2:01:16] here
[2:01:17] i want to go back to the pergament
[2:01:19] church age and i'm at paragraph 176.2
[2:01:23] this is the ending of our
[2:01:26] journey and pick up your pen and write
[2:01:30] i say step into the vision catch this
[2:01:34] vision and step into it you have been
[2:01:36] called to be the bride of jesus christ
[2:01:39] had a wedding brand of grace slipped on
[2:01:41] your finger before you was even born
[2:01:46] a contract an arrangement had been made
[2:01:48] that you wouldn't be married to christ
[2:01:51] hallelujah if if i tell you anybody
[2:01:54] the greatest uh marriage ceremony that
[2:01:57] you can be a part of
[2:01:58] is being married to christ
[2:02:03] hallelujah here uh in the in the permian
[2:02:06] church age the prophet says this
[2:02:08] and i shall say the angel of the lord
[2:02:10] speaking through the prophet and pick up
[2:02:12] your pen and write
[2:02:13] says the last day messenger will appear
[2:02:16] in god's appointed time
[2:02:20] it's the end time now as as all know
[2:02:23] that israel is in the homeland
[2:02:25] anytime now he will come according to
[2:02:27] malachi
[2:02:29] when we see him he will be dedicated to
[2:02:31] the word
[2:02:32] he would be indicated pointed out in the
[2:02:34] word revelation 10 7 so that's
[2:02:35] it's there in scripture that god
[2:02:37] promised this right
[2:02:39] and god will vindicate his ministry he
[2:02:42] will preach the truth as did elijah
[2:02:44] and be ready for the mount zion showdown
[2:02:48] many will misunderstand him because they
[2:02:49] have been taught scripture
[2:02:51] in a certain way which they consider
[2:02:54] truth
[2:02:55] don't mean it's the truth you just
[2:02:56] consider it truth
[2:02:59] because you've been taught that way
[2:03:01] right when it comes against that
[2:03:04] they will not believe even some true
[2:03:07] ministers will misunderstand the
[2:03:09] messenger because so much has been
[2:03:10] called god's truth by deceivers here's
[2:03:14] the last paragraph
[2:03:16] but this prophet will come
[2:03:19] and as the forerunner of the first
[2:03:21] coming cry
[2:03:23] behold the lamb of god that taketh away
[2:03:26] the sin of the world
[2:03:28] even so will he no doubt cry out
[2:03:31] behold the lamb of god coming in glory
[2:03:37] he will do this for even as john was the
[2:03:40] messenger of the truth to the elect
[2:03:43] so is this one the last
[2:03:46] messenger to the elect and word
[2:03:49] born bright

[2:14:54] church i'm identified with every bible
[2:14:57] character
[2:14:58] i'm identified with their glory and
[2:15:00] their shame and here we find ourselves
[2:15:02] identified
[2:15:03] in the story of isaac finding his
[2:15:05] rebecca
[2:15:06] in order to get his rebecca they needed
[2:15:09] an eliezer
[2:15:10] because isaac himself could not go down
[2:15:13] into that land
[2:15:15] he found himself an alien found himself
[2:15:17] a friend
[2:15:18] of the bridegroom amen we had one in our
[2:15:21] day yes
[2:15:22] his name was william marion branham but
[2:15:24] once the bro
[2:15:25] once the the friend of the brock room
[2:15:27] hears the bridegroom's voice
[2:15:29] speaking with the bride he knows his job
[2:15:32] has been done
[2:15:34] and that's what's going on now that's
[2:15:35] why the bible says the spirit and the
[2:15:37] bride
[2:15:38] say come amen amen behold the lamb of
[2:15:41] god
[2:15:42] coming in glory god richly bless your

[2:16:00] say before we have word of prayer i have
[2:16:02] enjoyed our journey
[2:16:06] and step into the vision i have
[2:16:09] thoroughly enjoyed
[2:16:13] being able to preach to you and and
[2:16:16] and uh i probably don't say this
[2:16:20] enough but it's something about
[2:16:22] preaching that spirit and truth
[2:16:23] tabernacle
[2:16:25] there's something about the saints here
[2:16:26] and and i've you know i i have
[2:16:29] experienced it myself just you all come
[2:16:31] with an expectation and your hearts are
[2:16:33] just ready to receive the word and
[2:16:36] um it just really helps it really helps
[2:16:38] when you've got people pulling on the
[2:16:39] word of god
[2:16:41] some places you go and you don't have
[2:16:42] that pool you're just kind of standing
[2:16:44] there
[2:16:44] lord give me something you know but but
[2:16:47] but when you come here and saints
[2:16:48] entering into the word and
[2:16:50] saying amen it just really really
[2:16:53] makes it easy to preach and this this
[2:16:56] year this journey of stepping to the
[2:16:57] vision just
[2:16:58] just sermon after sermon that the lord
[2:17:00] gave us uh i was just

[2:23:03] hand clap of praise
[2:23:08] praise the lord praise the lord
[2:23:10] hallelujah
[2:23:12] what a message amen amen
[2:23:16] before we go i want to let you have your
[2:23:18] seats brother josue
[2:23:20] come and give your testimony praise the
[2:23:23] lord
[2:23:28] i bless you church love the lord
[2:23:33] it's wonderful when we uh recognize who
[2:23:36] we are is it
[2:23:38] it is um
[2:23:41] this morning as i was praying
[2:23:45] i felt led by the holy spirit to ask
[2:23:48] brother jack if he can
[2:23:49] allow me to share this testimony and
[2:23:51] it's wonderful how god does things
[2:23:53] because
[2:23:54] um he said that he would and then
[2:23:57] i guess as the service went it wasn't
[2:24:00] the time but i believe that
[2:24:01] god wanted me to hear something just to
[2:24:04] confirm to me
[2:24:05] how great that testimony is and it's a
[2:24:08] very
[2:24:09] small testimony but there's a scripture
[2:24:11] that that says
[2:24:12] better is little with the fear of god
[2:24:15] than great treasures and trouble there
[2:24:19] some
[2:24:20] so that's kind of like my
[2:24:23] the testimony is so small but yes so big
[2:24:26] you know
[2:24:27] and and and we have to uh find god in
[2:24:30] those little things and i believe that
[2:24:32] if you can't
[2:24:33] um see god on a day to day basis
[2:24:36] things that that he does for you then
[2:24:39] i mean people are just waiting for a big
[2:24:41] thing we got a big house we got a big
[2:24:43] job yeah it was god but
[2:24:44] just those little tiny things that he
[2:24:46] does on a daily basis i think they're so
[2:24:48] important
[2:24:49] and there's a scripture in colossians
[2:24:51] that that says that whatever you do
[2:24:54] in in in in in in words or indeed
[2:24:57] do it in the name of the lord and and it
[2:25:00] also says
[2:25:02] with thanksgiving you know so i always
[2:25:04] have that in thought
[2:25:06] every time i'm doing anything um
[2:25:09] yesterday the lore allowed us to to have
[2:25:12] some fellowship me and mandy
[2:25:14] and we we went to this restaurant and
[2:25:16] we've been there uh
[2:25:17] many times and and if many of you know
[2:25:20] how our
[2:25:22] our the way we eat and stuff and it's
[2:25:24] kind of difficult when we go to places
[2:25:26] it's just
[2:25:27] like we we to figure out something to
[2:25:30] put together and then when we put our
[2:25:31] order
[2:25:32] most of the time they mess it up you
[2:25:34] know or they can't get it right they
[2:25:36] don't understand what we're trying to
[2:25:37] say
[2:25:37] so um yesterday when we went to the
[2:25:40] restaurant
[2:25:41] um and we sat down before we even
[2:25:44] did anything um i just told man the
[2:25:47] house
[2:25:48] let's let's just pray you know let's
[2:25:50] just ask god
[2:25:51] let's just thank god for giving us a
[2:25:53] chance to to fellowship
[2:25:55] and and and to be here so let's just
[2:25:58] pray so we
[2:25:59] bow our heads and we pray you know we
[2:26:01] thank god for
[2:26:02] for allowing us to be there we thank god
[2:26:04] for giving us a chance to fellowship
[2:26:06] together and enjoy each other's presence
[2:26:09] and
[2:26:09] and and after we finish praying now we
[2:26:12] just started talking and i started
[2:26:14] she shared a couple things with me and i
[2:26:16] was sharing with her how
[2:26:17] on the way there i had a customer of
[2:26:20] mine called me and and he
[2:26:22] he told me that there was a little
[2:26:23] problem with the horse you know
[2:26:25] something was going on or whatever so we
[2:26:27] start i started talking to her about
[2:26:29] that and i said man i
[2:26:30] i can't believe man i remember what i
[2:26:32] did to the horse i remember
[2:26:34] um how i put the shoes on you know like
[2:26:36] like i just i just
[2:26:37] hope that that that it like it
[2:26:41] doesn't become something else and then
[2:26:42] she said why don't we
[2:26:44] why don't we pray over the horse's foot
[2:26:46] you know and i said well praise the lord
[2:26:48] you know like the
[2:26:49] the lord told us to open our mouth why
[2:26:51] because we can't put limitations on god
[2:26:53] so even
[2:26:54] the got a little problem let's
[2:26:56] pray over the horse's foot and
[2:26:57] if if there's something there we believe
[2:26:59] that god can
[2:27:00] can can fix it so we let's pray
[2:27:04] so we pray over the host's foot and when
[2:27:07] we finish praying
[2:27:08] we start we kept talking and and and i'm
[2:27:11] telling mandy i said man
[2:27:12] they always mess our order up you know
[2:27:16] they are gonna they're probably gonna
[2:27:18] mess up the the
[2:27:19] the the the my pasta
[2:27:22] they're gonna mess up your pizza like
[2:27:24] they're not gonna put her on right we're
[2:27:25] gonna have to send it back
[2:27:26] and she's like why don't we
[2:27:30] pray over the over our meal let's pray
[2:27:32] over the food
[2:27:33] and this is where this testimony became
[2:27:36] so big to me
[2:27:37] because i felt that the same thing that
[2:27:40] happened to
[2:27:41] eliezer happened to us last night
[2:27:44] and without me even thinking about that
[2:27:48] this happened last night so i said les
[2:27:51] the waitress she was kind of confused
[2:27:53] when she was taking the order
[2:27:54] and and and we're like man she's messing
[2:27:57] it up definitely
[2:27:58] just get ready to send it back
[2:28:01] we say let's pray over it so we grab we
[2:28:03] grab our hands
[2:28:04] and we start praying i said heavenly
[2:28:07] father i mean you just
[2:28:09] we we've literally said like five words
[2:28:11] and
[2:28:12] in the middle of the prayer the waitress
[2:28:14] came back
[2:28:15] and interrupted our prayer and we we
[2:28:17] look at her and she's like
[2:28:19] i just wanted to tell you guys that i
[2:28:21] went to the
[2:28:22] chef i told him exactly how you wanted
[2:28:25] the order i
[2:28:26] make sure that they get it right i went
[2:28:27] to the pizza maker i told him how she
[2:28:29] wants to be
[2:28:30] and i was like we me and amanda looked
[2:28:32] at each other and we're like
[2:28:33] the lord know it's what you're in need
[2:28:36] of before you even ask
[2:28:38] so we had a concern something in our
[2:28:40] heart just something as small as
[2:28:41] our meal being right and before we even
[2:28:44] finish the prayer like it happened with
[2:28:45] eliaser
[2:28:46] when we opened our eyes she was right
[2:28:48] then the prayer was already answered
[2:28:51] i wanted to share that with you guys
[2:28:53] because it was something so small but
[2:28:54] yet so big
[2:28:56] and then we can look at each other and
[2:28:57] say man god is with us here
[2:28:59] i believe that he did that because he we
[2:29:02] he was pleased we did everything in the
[2:29:04] name of the lord
[2:29:05] and we were giving god thanks for
