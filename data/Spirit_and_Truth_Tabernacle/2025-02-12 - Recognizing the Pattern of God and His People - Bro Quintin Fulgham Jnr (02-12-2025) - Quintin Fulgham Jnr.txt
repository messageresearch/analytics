us to join us tonight today um Y and is it Janiah Janiah and that's her daughter Janiah so it's it's great to have y'all with us so we are going to get straight into the word um we are going to turn to turn our Bibles to um 1 Corinthians 11:1 and then we'll also be reading Joel 2:24 so just say Amen once you uh once you get there all right and 1 Corinthians 11:1 reads be ye followers of me and this is Paul speaking even as I also am of Christ and then uh Joel 2 we're going to read uh chap we're going to read Joel chapter 2 we're going to read read verse uh 24 just say Amen once you get there and it reads in the floors shall be full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil so may the Lord add a blessing to his word as you're as you're seated today so the message that the Lord inspired me to speak today the title of it is uh recognizing the pattern of God and his people with the subtitle of who are the Christian of today right so brother Jack has given us the theme of the year which is a year of overflow and I've been really enjoying enjoying the way how brother Jack has led with this theme how he's uh we all want a physical over uh overflow right we want God to bless our businesses God to bless our health God to bless our jobs uh but brother Jack really has been focusing on a spiritual overflow right uh and how the spiritual overflow has got to be the first thing when you have a spiritual overflow you'll find that the physical stuff gets taken care of and that's just the way that God has uh patterned things so uh in this message of recognizing the pattern of God and his people we have to understand how God works and God always works in a specific set of ways so when God um when God God showed that it would have to be a blood offering in the beginning when Adam and Eve sent that means it would have to be a blood offering again it have to be a sacrifice so God couldn't change his way of doing things so when Cain brought a offering it wasn't that God was trying to hurt his feelings it was just God couldn't go contrary of what he already approved of all right which is a pattern and I looked online of what a pattern is and a couple of definitions that I have is an arrangement or sequence regularly found in comparable objects another definition was a set of instructions to be followed in making a sewn or knitted item so you're in order to get uh that uh something that you a particular thing that you want to uh sew a design or something you're following a particular pattern to get that design another definition is an example for others to follow that is a pattern and another definition is to give something a form based on that of something else right so you're basing a pattern based off something else and a pattern essentially allows to you to help you to identify a thing right what a thing is for example of shape if I were to have let's say uh four lines Drawn Together you would be able to identify that that was a square and if I had a uh if I drew a curved shape uh uh totally around you would say well that's a circle so patterns help us to identify what something is so we'll know what it is uh and not only are patterns seen in like uh concrete objects like that but they're also seen in behaviors you can find patterns in people's behaviors which can can help you to avoid certain people or know to go towards certain people based off their patterns and so patterns are um patterns so you'll notice that smart people take advantage of patterns in order to be successful right so let's say you wanted to be rich what's the best thing to do in order to be rich follow someone who's already rich right someone who's already gone through and gone through the ups and downs and you see that they're rich which means that it's not something that's imaginary that you're trying to speculate you see this person is actually rich so if you could for example give this person some Google glasses with a camera and be able to watch what they're doing every single day you know maybe you would see when they wake up first thing the morning they'll go online or they'll read the newspaper and they'll read some Financial art articles or look at the market and then you would see as they go to the grocery store they go shopping you know they always buy the stuff on sale so my dad's a big Financial person and he loves to find a sale I'm I'm almost the complete opposite I'll spend money right but my dad is very very good at finances so he always is looking for the sale so if you're looking at this rich person he's always trying to get the sale buy one get three free right that's how he is right that's how that's how people are when they want to uh uh obtain riches right um also you would see is that when the person's paycheck comes in you will see they will allocate some of their money towards the rent to buy food then they will allocate some money for savings and then they will allocate some money for other Investments and if you kept watching this person's daily movements and the daily week you would see he does the same thing every single day he does the same thing every single week every month it becomes a pattern and when you follow that pattern you'll find that in your own Financial life that you'll get better as well right because you're following someone uh Studies have also Studies have been shown and our studies are used because they help to identify patterns so for example stud say that if your parents your mom and dad are college educated you're more than likely as a kid to be educated as well right that's a pattern um studies also sh studies also say that if your parents are in a successful marriage it's more than likely that you'll end up in a successful marriage and why is that is because as a kid you're constantly looking for patterns in life so let's say for example you have a daughter and she's sitting at The Breakfast Table Right and she sees her mother you know cook food for her husband and come bring her come bring the food to her husband and kiss him on the cheek and tell her uh tell him that he loves her when she sees that she's going to try to emulate that in her own marriage right and so and let's say there's also a son at the table and before the husband goes to work he gets up and you know he plays with it tickles his wife or whatever and kisses her and everything and says you know you're the you're the best woman in the world right when that son sees those behaviors he was going to want to emulate those behaviors for his wife as as well and just as that is true the opposite is true so if you have a son and he sees a man constantly yelling at his wife always uh kind of downplaying his wife and being mean to her more than likely when he gets into a relationship he'll do the same exact thing to his wife and if a and if a daughter sees a a wife constantly uh nagging to the husband or just trying to tell him you need to do this this and that more than likely she'll grow up and be exactly the same thing so it's a pattern that people pick up on um a pattern that uh that these young ones pick up on and a lot and that's why sometimes you know when you're around certain people and you wonder why they act a certain way right and a lot of times they may not know it themselves but they've picked up on something when they were younger and now they're emulating what that pattern was which is why it's important that we meet the Lord Jesus Christ when God comes into the life all that ceases you don't have to worry about the person's uh what they've grown up in or the behaviors or the genetics that they have all that ceases to exist when Cod comes in right so now that's the physical side of stuff and we love the physical side of things but we want to also look at the spiritual side of patterns right because before you can receive an overflow of blessings God one of God's uh requirements is you have to be a genuine Christian God will only bless a genuine Christian and we're going to get into that later because there's a difference between a blessing and just receiving an increase God will give you an increase but you can have an increase without being a blessing as we see in the story of the Rich Young Ruler when God came up to him and presented him with the word right he rejected the word it didn't say he got worse the Bible says he got better right he got an increase but that's not the type of increase of genuine Christian wants a genuine Christian wants an increase where they can say Amen to the word and God can come and bless them as well that's what a True Believer is looking for so we have to ask ourselves what is a Christian right and what's the pattern that God deals with his people so going back to 1 Corinthians uh chapter 11 we're going to read the first three verses to kind of see what Paul uh establishes with that thought of uh being uh uh of being a Christian so we'll do go back here read that so 1 Corinthians 1 says Paul says in the first chapter be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ now this is interesting we have to kind of take a pause here and look at kind of break down what Paul has said here because the definition that the world uses today as a as a a what a Christian is is someone that follows Christ right but here Paul says follow me right God says follow me not to directly follow Christ so we have to realize that there's got to be something very very very special about Paul in order for him to be able to say something like that right and we have because we have to realize that this was during a time where you know you had Peter you had John you had James you had uh other fivefold ministers uh that were in the ministry right and these were righteous men all filled with the Holy Ghost right so what makes Paul different from these people right and this is just this is just the Bible right so Peter didn't say I mean Paul didn't say follow me and Peter or follow me and a group or follow me and a church he said follow me singular right he identified it as a singular right so just by the Bible we can identify that during that time right the pattern of following with Christian was to follow you had a follow a special man which this in this case was Paul and as Paul you follow Paul it meant that you automatically were following Christ right so we have to recognize also that because a lot of times people have trouble with following a man a lot of times people have a lot of debate and a lot of uh um issues rise up when people say to follow another man and it's hard for us to Humble ourselves but the thing that we have to realize is that Paul didn't pick himself right Paul wasn't the one that picked himself God had to come and pick Paul and in fact Paul wasn't even trying to serve God the right way he was going the opposite way and God said no this is going to be the man that is I'm going to I'm I'm going to use this man in order to show people the way for what this day and age is so right Paul didn't pick himself so anytime you see a big messenger it is not someone that has picked him self God has picked them that's just the Bible right in verse two uh it says now praise you brethen that you had that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you and I like that word ordinance here because I looked up some of the definitions of what an ordinance is and it's a piece of legislation one of the definitions is a piece of legislation enacted by Municipal Authority another definition is an authoritative order or a decree and the last one is a prescribed religious right so what that says is the things that this person says comes with authority right and the thing with authority is usually it it has to come from one person right that's that's some of the that's some of the beliefs that the kings of old if you if you read your history and stuff like that the kings of old had full authority meaning that they were the only ones in charge and when they spoke a word that word had to come that was it no one else could debate it right so this Paul this person that we are uh that we're looking at now had a a level of authority where he could say something that could be an authoritative order of course you know based off of Christ right yes sir so I want to kind of take a take a moment to kind of just tell a little testimony because we also have a prophet in this day right we also have a prophet in this day who lived a life and also gave decrees and also told us things and how to live and I kind of want to tell a story how just to kind of mirror off that where Paul was saying I praise you brother that you remember me in all things um we were out with the youth and we were at this place called pette we was out with the youth kind of um you know letting the youth enjoy themselves and stuff and I was going up to this little um this little food truck and I was going to order me some food and there was someone in uh that was in front of me so I was waiting in line and the person moved and I came in next and there was this young kid uh This Tall Young kid that was standing next to me and as I was beginning to order my food cuz I was next and line he just burst right beside and just started talking to the cast register didn't even look at me didn't acknowledge me or nothing like that and I'm just sitting here like oh my goodness like I'm just sitting here just kind of looking like are you really doing this he didn't look at me he didn't say anything to me and the cast register is kind of looking at me like like he didn't know how to react as well and so I remember I started to get upset cuz I'm like all right this is messed up like how you going to sit up here and just this butt in front of me I'm sitting here waiting out in the sun and you just going to come up here and just so I'm getting upset I'm getting hot and upset and um after the kid he helped the kid out and he walked away and then the cashier started to say some negative things about the situation and I can remember uh in my heart I remembered how the prophet talked about Elisha right and how when Elisha those kids came and they started making fun of the prophet and he spoke a word to them and the she Bears came and tore him up I remember the prophet said that wasn't the right way to act so then I looked at the kid and I said you know what I forgive you right I said I forgive you he said I don't know maybe you w maybe he wasn't raised the right way maybe his parents never told him anything like that but I said I forgive you for doing that right so I need we need an example for this age in order for us to help point us to what it is to be Christlike right the prophet came and revealed to us that what Elisha did was wrong I've never heard any other religious person or any other denomination read the Bible and say that what a prophet did was wrong right so and we're going to continue now to verse three it says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so here um Paul is further lay laying out this pattern of a head and a body right and so Paul has positioned himself as not not not the head but he's still representative of what God God's word is supposed to be on earth and how we're just following him and it's just a pattern it's just a pattern between these things we we can't come on Earth and do things ourself we need someone to come and lead us we need someone to guide us that's why in your household you know when the father is the head of the household it's his job to kind of take care of things you know and the wife is there to kind of support him right it's uh and that's just the way the uh the pattern that God has uh used right so what the scripture is saying is that Paul was picked by God to be the head of that time right and we know during our time that a man was picked to be the head of our age in order for us to follow as well right and so but the problem seems to come is that when you talk about these things during this age uh people struggle with believing it even though it's something we literally see in the scripture we just read in the scripture an example in Paul and how God used Paul but nowadays it seems to be of it seems to be a struggle for people to believe that a man can come down that God can take full control of and to lead the people into all truths right uh you know a lot of times people will put it into a logical sense where you know they'll say you're just following a man right or this is just a man's uh opinion was just a flesh for man or they say you're worshiping a man they'll say that you're in a cult uh um but my response would be that would be idolatry anytime you worship a man anytime you worship any object or if you worship a man it's considered idolatry right and my question was when Paul said follow me as I follow Christ was that idolatry for Paul to say so right if it was idolatry for Paul to say so why did God keep it in the word amen why did God keep it in the word the Bible says that God shares his glory with no one you see so you have to make sure the scriptures are running in continuation when you have your thought process to make sure you have an expected outcome right so there's got to be something to God having a messenger and getting his hands on a man right for Christians to follow and what I like how Paul said this thing is that Christians cannot follow Christ directly right during this time and age that we're living in Christians don't follow Christ uh follow Christ directly now there will be there will come a time right where you will follow Christ directly just stay with me because sometimes it sounds a little weird there will be a time where you will follow Christ directly right in the new Heaven and a new Earth the prophet said there won't be any more preaching there won't be any needs forh prophets there'll be no need for the fful ministry just going to be you and Christ directly but that day isn't today right that day is not today and that's why it's important to follow the light of your day and that has to be the key theme for any believer is following the light uh uh for your day that has to be your theme and everything you do every I don't care any kind of Christian Endeavor that you have going to church worshiping God reading the Bible always remember that you have to follow the light for your day what is the for our day right and it always comes through a man right in the beginning when Adam was on Earth he didn't need any restoration he was the spoken word of God right he didn't need ministers he didn't have to have people to tell him to be baptized and all this kind of thing he was the direct spoken word of God so that was a different time or it was a different scenario right Adam was all all already perfect and we're going to get to that later so God sending a messenger with the life of the day isn't anything new it's not anything new that he hasn't done before but it does seem strange to people uh in this time and the problem with a lot of the churches today is it's it's a problem that they always had through history right they have no problem following what God has done they've got no problem following what God will do in the future but when you're asking where is God in your life right now no one has an answer they always talk about what he's done they always talk about what he's going to do but what is he doing in your life right now right they fail to see what God is doing during their time and we're going to turn to the message God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same uh preaching 63 I'll give her time to pull it up to kind of see what the prophet said about this paragraph 113 through 114 all right there we go and it reads the prophet said it is strange to think how that God does such a thing as that God will hide himself in simpli so simple that it'll cause the wise to miss it a million miles and then turn right back around and that some simple thing in the Simplicity of his way of working and and reveal himself right out again right it's a pattern and it's a simple pattern it's not it's not difficult to understand I thought it made a text that we might study this before we get into the great teaching of the Seven Seals many miss him by the way he reveals himself and I love how the prophet said before you get into great teachings before you get into the deep things make sure you know how to see Christ make sure you have a uh you have like to be able to recognize them or when you get into the seals you just get all confused and then you cause other people to be confused and all a sudden we're back at square one again right so the prophet continued to said in 114 he said now men has their own idea own ideas of what God ought to be and what God is going to do and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he is doing and I like how the prophet said that word ignoring which means you recognize something there but you just choosing not to see it amen see see that's the way they miss it they look back and see what a great thing he done but they fail to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and what he's referring to is the pattern how God sends a messenger a man in order to get his church in line right see and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and here here here here's a uh the key part right here why you need a great messenger and nine times out of 10 is already happening right around them and it's so simple that they don't know it so everybody wants to get into the seals not knowing some of this stuff is they looking for things to happen not knowing how do you know it hasn't passed how do you know it's not currently happening people don't know what time it is and it's scary do you know not what time it is because the coming of the Lord is a real event amen it's a real event right so we're going to continue on with with this thought of the pattern cuz we want to start looking at these key things in the pattern so that we know how to recognize where God is in order for us to be ready right and we want to look at this pattern that Paul has stated and compareed to see how God interacted with God in the beginning and I know I've been preaching a lot about Genesis in uh in the Book of Genesis but I tell you this as long if you're following the light for your day and you want to live a Christian Life you want to be blessed you want a life that's not full of stress and turmoil and all that kind of stuff if you read the first two chapters of Genesis of how God originally designed things it takes away a lot of headaches it takes away a lot of Heartache it takes away a lot of stress because God always points back to that that's why when the Pharisees came to Jesus Christ and they said hey uh Moses wrote us a letter for divorcement Jesus Christ response was it wasn't so from the beginning what was he referring to he was referring to back to Adam and Eve there was no such thing as divorce right God never instituted divorce he was referring back to that time if you live during this time you you you'll you'll save yourself a lot of heartache and trouble right so now Adam was a beautiful example of what a Christian is to be and that's why I love to talk about him right he had God which was the representation of his head and Adam of course was the body and we're going to see how Major Prophets or these Messengers these end time Messengers that we have type to the way that God dealt with Adam in the beginning because like we said about a pattern God has to do things the same exact way God's got to treat everybody the same exact way it's nothing new here right so when we look at this pattern there's two things we want to we there's two things that we want to recognize first one is the head right and the head will always follow a particular pattern and the head is always a person right it's always a person two is the body that's the second thing and by following and by the body following the head you'll see that it will follow a particular pattern as well these things have to dovetail together that's why when God when God sent a messenger it's because he expected there to be a people to receive that message he didn't send that message for no reason that's why he told the disciple if you guys want praise the stones will raise up in Praise something has got to receive the message someone has got to receive this thing there has to be another recipient on the other side of God's message in order to bring the word of God to pass because the Bible says God can't lie all right so we're going to look at these different elements and we always have to start with the head because the body has to follow the way of the head so if you noticed um biologically um when you move move your hand or when you move your foot you're actually what you're doing is in your mind you're telling your foot to move and you're telling your hand to move and it starts from the head and then the body acts accordingly so we always got to start with the head first and then you get a response from the body right these patterns have to Dove tell each other now this isn't an all-inclusive list about about these types and stuff but there just some things that I believe God has inspired me to kind of say um and the first thing the first element that we're going to look at is a head must have thus saved the Lord right a head has to have the word of the Lord and nothing else it can't have an opinion and it can't be mixed with any other ideas it can't be mixed with any other words it has to be thus sayith the Lord and the re and the body pattern that follows that is the body has to receive the message right they've got to receive the message the second element that we're going to look at is the head always comes with a message of warning right they always come with a message of warning and warnings are perspective depending on the cut how the recipient is cut out right meaning a warning is actually good news for a Believer right when a warning comes to a Believer is actually good news to them right or if I can say it this way a Believer should not be afraid of the coming of the Lord if when people are talking about the coming of the Lord that makes you afraid there's something wrong with the way you've been cut out right the coming of the Lord is bad news for the unbeliever right it's a bad news for unbeliever but the but the but the believer takes that message a different kind of way they prepare themselves a different kind of way and the last thing we're going to look at is uh aead is a Onan message it's only one person that comes it's only one person that's on the scene and the body only responds to that one person the pattern of the body follow they stand behind that one person they won't stand behind anything else right so we're going to start our journey now in Genesis uh 215 going right back to the beginning right Genesis 2:15 through1 17 and we're going to read this and kind of type these things so verse 15 says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden to Eden to dress it and to keep it verse 16 says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die all right so here we see a great example of a thus sayith the Lord now God didn't say thus save the Lord because he is the Lord all he did was just give the word but when a Prophet comes on to the scene a characteristic theme you'll see with them is they'll say thus sayith the Lord which means it is the voice of God right it's a uh when a when a prophet says thus sayith the Lord and something comes to pass you got to listen to that person because that shows that God is backing that man and that is the voice of God right so now God was the word here that I said but when a major prophet or a messenger comes on to the scene the word is fully with them God had already proved that when uh Moses uh when Moses had come onto the scene um and I'll turn I'll turn and read this uh verse right you don't have to turn to it though uh it's in um Exodus 4 uh chapter 16 and uh chapter yeah not chapter 16 chapter 4 verse 15 and 16 and I'll just read this and it says and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth he's talking about Moses and Aaron and I will be with thy mouth and his mouth and will teach ye teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and what did God say to Moses and thou shalt be to him instead of God right so now God has elevated Moses into this position and we all know that Moses was a major messenger for that time now if you read over in Psalms uh and this is a verse that brother Solomon likes to uh uh say a lot of times it says ye are Gods right and it's true it says you are children of the most high but when you look at that Bible First when it says God's it's little G but when God spoke to Moses here in verse 16 it's big G which means that it's God's word God's word is with this man you may be a Christian you may be anointed but God has a particular position and place that he's put this person uh um in control and that you have to consider what his word was right so now Adam and Adam and his wife they were God's children when God put him into the garden he created them and he wanted them to um uh furnish the garden and take care of the garden take care of the garden they were his children but the thing was they didn't know what tree to eat from when God spoke these words to them they had to be instructed on which one was okay to eat and which ones they could not eat right though they were God's children so we see a a pattern with these Special with these Special mer these special Messengers uh the word is with them right God had the word God had the instruction of the day and and how they were to act in the garden right it wasn't with Adam it which represented the church right the word was with God and God had to instruct the church this is how you act in the garden right so when a messenger comes and speaks a word it's nothing different than what we've already seen in the Bible how God has treated Adam and I can predict the way you receive a messenger is how you would act if you was in the garden if you can receive a messenger for the day that comes with thus saith the Lord it'll be a glorious time in the garden but if you cannot receive a message from the me a message from the messenger of the day it would be turmoil in the garden right so they were even though they were children's of God they didn't they start to be be instructed and we want to further kind of show this thing is that when Adam and Eve fell uh I was talking to my dad earlier today and he was uh he had a conversations with uh with his neighbors and they was talking about a word having a really good time in a word and one of the things they came across was the question that they had the topic they were talking about was why wasn't Cain's sacrifice accepted and my dad was kind of showing them that you know when Adam fell what did he do he went to get some fig leaves put him on himself and he put it on his wife and then God came around and said Adam where are you and he saw them fig Lees and he took them off right Adam didn't know what to do to please the Lord he needed God right in order to tell him what to do in order for him to be accepted Adam didn't have it in himself even though he was God's son all right so these Messengers they come to tell us what to do not to bully us or anything like that but just to show us what is acceptable to God right you would meaning you wouldn't know how to accept god without a messenger you wouldn't know what is acceptable to God without a messenger you wouldn't know what it is to be a Christian you wouldn't know what pleases God and what not pleases god without being instructed how to do it a lot of Christians try to do it but God uh if God rejected Cain's way and Adam's way then he'd have to reject your way today as well right so you can't please God with your own thoughts and Adam wasn't trying to do put those figes on cuz he was trying to be disobedient he was really trying to fix the situation so it takes more than just sincerity and trying to be a good Christian it takes the word the exact thus sayith the Lord this is what please God regardless of your feelings right so when the word comes forth to this special messenger the body also has a work to do or a pattern to follow so when God spoke these words to his children when he told them uh to eat from this tree and not to eat from that tree there was no questioning after what God had said right meaning Adam response to what God Said was amen God said don't do this and do that go Adam said amen no questioning no argument so you see he just responded to the word and just received the word as it was my question is how come when a prophet now comes into our day and says something all of a sudden there's always a debate wow wow if we're following the pattern of God and we're trying to be like Adam who was the original Christian when God spoke a word that settled it but nowadays when a prophet will come on the scene or someone uh this messenger speak a word now there's always a struggle there's always a struggle of reasoning about what he said and the problem that we have with that is mixing mixing is what has created this problem the world today is mixed with Believers make Believers and unbelievers um the prophet typed today to uh Sodom and gomorrah's time where Abraham represented the believer lot represented the make believer and Sodom and gomorah represented the unbelievers right and the key thing that God said to uh for Abraham was to separate yourself when God called Abraham Abraham brought lot trying to mix God didn't call for a lot though and that's what a lot of us try to do when God gives us the word we try to mix the word with something else and all it does is Just Cause issues because when God brought lot along it said all their people was fighting each other until God until Abraham finally said you know what I'm going back to the original word lot choose where you want to go I'll go the opposite opposite direction when they separated themselves from each other notice God came to visit Abraham that's right when he fully separated himself right to the word of God he came to visit Abraham right you got mixing uh you got mixing in the church world uh you have mixing in your own with your own ideas the prophet told the story of the Indian who said you know I find that there's always a battle in my head there's a white dog and then there's a black dog and brother brandom had uh asked him a question he said well which one wins he says the one that I feed the most all right so in order to get rid of the mixing you got to feed the white dog the most and just feed on what he wants to eat and that'll bring about the promise that you're looking for right so before we can receive the word or receive what a prophet a major prophet for our day has to say has to say we need a body change right we need a body change because our body have been mixed with so many generations and you can look at your past Generations in your history and you may have people in your life that you're not uh uh particularly proud of and you got all those genes mixed inside of you so we need a born again experience just as Adam was cuz Adam wasn't brought to the World by sex he was spoken Adam was the direct spoken word of God which means God could trust Adam to say Amen right so we need a born Born Again experience in order to be able to receive the word for our day right and you say well why is that important because your overflow may come in a particular way that you're not seeing and if you can't say Amen to the word how are you going to receive it right for example you know you pray and you're like Lord I want to be rich I want money I want a million bucks or whatever God's like okay I got you you're my kid I got you and so when your next paycheck comes in after you pay finish paying your ti after you finish paying your offering after you finish paying the rent got the food kids taken care of and now you looking at your little portion like this is my money God comes around and Taps your shoulder hey take that money that you got and when you when you when you're walking out through the week I'm going to inspire you who I want to give you that money too and you're sitting here like what this is my money amen this is my money but what God is trying to do is he's trying to see can he trust you right cuz when you can then say Amen to the word in the way that God delivers it so now you're going down the street and you see the guy and God's like this the person I want to get I want you to get that money to you're like man I was really going to do I was going to buy me a boat with this money I was going to buy me a new motor or you know a go-kart or something right I was going to do something with this money but because you've got a new birth and can say he Amen to the word you can then hand that money over you hand it to the guy God says thank you goes on his way 6 months down the road he comes back knocks on your door says hey you know when you gave me that money my business was going under now we're successful and I want to give you some money uh to thank you for that thing so now you received your overflow it didn't come the way you thought it was but because you said amen to the word by a new birth God could work with you amen so it's important for us to be uh it's important for us to be um born again and what I said is nothing that is not scriptural because it's just like the uh the shemite woman when uh Elijah came and told her hey man bake me a cake she's like look we about to take these two cakes and die like we already got I already got our Graves dug up in our Stones we about to eat these cakes and he said no feed me first and when she said amen to the word she got an overflow yeah is it not the word right so we need a new birth to be able to say Amen to whatever God comes down and says we just want to respond I don't understand what it is amen the new birth says I don't care what it I don't care about my understanding of it I'm just saying Amen to the word right God always knows how to take care of his kids right um so and that's where that's where one of the biggest problems that we uh that we kind of that we kind of find today is that when God gave adam that word of what to do what tree to eat from and what tree not to eat from you notice that his wife was inside of him it wasn't until she came out afterwards that in the next verse so when Adam said amen to the word his wife was on the inside she said amen too right and this was one creature it wasn't two people right and so when when Eve when God took uh his wife outside of him we notice that Adam took care of his wife Adam loved his wife she didn't lack anything she didn't have anything that she needed to go extra to do God Prov uh Adam God and Adam provided her a place to stay and gave her food um the the Bible says there was gold there you know ladies love diamonds she had probably diamonds as big as watermelons right that she could every girl that wants to get married at engagement they want a diamond she probably had diamonds as big as watermelons as much as she could see right so she had everything for her not only that the prophet said on the cool of the evening God will come down and fellowship right so God brought his wife to come and fellowship with the Lord she had everything but somehow it wasn't enough and I'm telling you right now without the baptism hold of the Holy Spirit the word will not be enough for you you need a new birth you need a new chain you need God to come inside of your heart what the what the new birth is is God coming inside of your heart and you going back inside of God and now you're one creature just like it was in the beginning with Adam so that now when God speaks a word you say Amen even when you're struggling the Bible says that Christ uh he'll say amen for you on the inside right and it ensures that you'll get to your destination when you get weak Christ will come around and say oh no no no he says amen we believe the word God is always looking at the head right that's why when God came to Abraham and told him you're going to have you're going to have a child and Sarah laughed behind the tent Prophet said God would have took her out but she was connected to Abraham's amen right and when you receive the baptism the Holy Spirit your amen is connected to Christ and Christ has already said amen to the word right you have nothing to fear amen we're talking about God's pattern here and what it and uh for believers uh and so the next thing that we want to look at is with a major prophit is God sends them with a message of warning right so we've had great reformers in the age we've had great men that have come and reformed and given us different kinds of messages and stuff you know we had Luther right Luther was a reformer but he couldn't warn us because he didn't know what time it was we had Wesley God uh God sent Wesley to come and reform but Wesley couldn't warn us because he didn't know what time it was we had Pentecost and great men in the Pentecostal experience but they couldn't warn us because they didn't know what time it was right Luther's group Luther's group they were justified by faith they said we ain't believing in the Catholic Doctrine we justified by faith go home and smoke a pipe and be okay all right true and it was the word for that day Wesley's group could shout hey we've got it we've got it God is with us go home and crack open the here all right uh Pentecost speak in tongues coming to church speaking in tongues and then go to work that same day and curse their co-workers out all right and they could they could sleep around with people in the church and the next day come to church prophesying just living any old kind of life doing any old kind of thing right no we needed a prophet to come with a warning message right not just gifts not just great IDE ideas but we needed a prophet to come with a a warning message and in the restoration of Pentecost they had prophets they had the fold Ministry they had prophets they had teachers they had pastors they had evangelists but it wasn't enough right we needed someone special to come uh and reveal not only reveal the seals to us to tell us that we're in the end time but to make sure we were ready for the coming of the Lord which means that we were living right for his coming right that's why the prophet comes he says don't drink or don't smoke or don't do these things it's because he's trying to prepare you for the coming of the Lord right we needed to know when the end time was or where the end time was to be able to be right before when God comes here because uh in Past Times you go to a lot of churches everyone reads their Bible and everyone's always talking about the coming of the Lord that ain't no secret everyone always preaches get ready for the coming of the Lord the Pentecostals re preach the coming of the Lord but the problem is does your life prove that the Lord is coming which is what God is looking for God is looking for your life to speak that he is coming not just profession right because the problem with the denominational church is they'll profess the coming of the Lord is and do the same thing that the world does so now the warning message has no effect it doesn't mean anything because you doing the exact same thing we're doing you see what I'm saying they uh they'll they'll drink smoke and do all these kinds of things and not live a life it shows that they don't they don't believe the coming of the Lord uh is here but the believer will dress right she'll act right when this messenger comes comes in he's not just going to give him a message just to tickle their ears and get blessings and all these kinds of things no he's going to warn them of the coming of the Lord and you'll see that this group will act different they'll respond different in situations when they're when uh great temptation is brought their way they'll respond the right way people will wonder what is different about these people right right their lives show they believe God is coming right their lives show that they believe God is coming right and so remember we're watching for patterns here so did God warn Adam and Eve that God give him a message of warning he sure did he told him that if you eat from this tree you'll be successful and if you eat from that tree you will not be successful a messenger always has to have a a warning message and a warning can have multiple purposes because in Adam's day he didn't need a restoration as we said before he was already perfect he was always perfect but a warning also come so that you can keep your blessing you got to be warned to make sure you stay uh uh once you've been restored that you keep your blessing uh and we can look in the Bible at The Prostitute when she was on the ground and people were getting ready to Stone her to death and Jesus came and he sat down and he said the person without sin throw the first stone and they all walked away and he said where are your accusers neither do I accuse you right that was a restorative restoration message that restored her back right that restored no matter what she did in her life no matter what mistake she had in her life that message when God said I neither do I judge you that restored her back to a Adam condition right but God ain't ended there God didn't stop it there the next thing he said was go and send sin no more right so what he did was he brought the original message you can eat from this tree but you cannot eat from that tree he brought her the message in order for her to stay in that restorative uh position that she was in so we needed prophets to come to keep us on track and we're going to talk about en closing we're going to talk about the last element in this pattern is that it is a Onan message right this is a onean message God doesn't send multiple people with different kind of ideas that's why you have some people that believe in the baptism of the the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost right it's not three God it's not three Gods it's one God it's one God with one message right God's voice in the garden was only one voice there wasn't another voice right it doesn't matter how many motivational speakers are during this time or phds or religious leaders or religious ideas cuz everybody seems to have a word from the Lord nowadays right everybody seems to got a word from the Lord everybody seems to hear something from God but this group right here they've patterned theirselves after the word that if anyone speaks something outside of the messenger that God has sent they won't receive it right no matter how much the uh serpent tried to come to Adam whatever he told Adam Adam never believed what he said Adam never believed what he said right so there's the there there's the pattern that that's the pattern for a Christian a Christian follows the messenger of their day as they follow Christ and this is why we believe in the message of the hour this is why we believe God sent a man William brandom as the prophet of our age in order to prepare us for the coming of the Lord to teach us what it is to live right we wouldn't know what to do we wouldn't we wouldn't know how to live we wouldn't know how to act we wouldn't know how to respond to the word we wouldn't know how church order was supposed to be we wouldn't know how to say Amen to the word we wouldn't know how to love our neighbors and and not just love people that loved us but love people that don't loved us the prophet said you know if someone wanted to kill you even if they wanted to kill you you should be able to love them back right we needed a messenger of that day to come down and uh speak those words to us so just to reiterate what we've gone over so one the messenger has thus saved the Lord as God did have in the beginning brother brandham came with thus saith the Lord right and he proved it right in the body which was Adam or Christians they received the word just as Adam did in the beginning right we're talking about the pattern of what a Christian is today the second thing is the messenger comes with a warning that causes the Christians to not only be uh prepared for the coming of the Lord and to get in the step but to stay in Step just as God did in the beginning with Adam and Eve and just as Adam did Adam took heed to the warning in the beginning and the Christians of the day take heed of the messenger right in order to stay in step and the third thing is the messenger is a oneman message it's not two groups or anything but God was the only person with the word of the Lord in the garden he was the only person that could bring the word of the Lord and the Christians today only receive that one voice they won't receive any other voice and I I I I I'll end it in this as cuz brother quu has a great uh testimony of how he came came to the church I believe he was on his school he was going to school and uh he saw sister Amanda and he saw the way that she was dressed and that attracted him right not not no worldly attraction but just a a a Christian attraction right and so he went up to her and said you know where do you go to church and he asked her these questions but then he asked her the most important thing who is your messenger and when she said brother brandham he said this is the church I want to go to this is the pattern of a Believer a Believer is not just attracted to and it's good it's good to come to church it's good to wear the right clothes it's good to live the correct life it's good not to drink and not to smoke and all these things those stuff is good it's good to have a it's good to live a holy life but who are you following who is your messenger amen all right we'll end it in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Lord your word has come forth oh God Lord we know that it's only you oh Lord God that can bring Revelation oh Lord Jesus as Peter when you ask the question of who they thought you were oh Lord God and Peter said the correct thing oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord you said flesh and blood has not revealed that to you but my Father which in heaven has and Upon This Rock will I build my church oh Lord God lord you have a church that is built on Revelation oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we know Lord God that we cannot live this word without you oh Lord God lord we can't say it's it's it's it's a struggle for us to say Amen is some things oh Lord God but Lord we're dependent upon your grace oh Lord God lord if there are those that have not been born again oh Lord Jesus Christ help them oh Lord God receive this free gift oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord no one has to pay for it oh Lord God you don't have to you don't have to work for it oh Lord Jesus Christ you just said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ and this birth would come oh Lord God which would make us a new creature oh Lord God we will be able to recognize the messenger you sent in our hour we will be able to recognize the message that he said oh Lord God we will be able to say Amen to all the word oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord that will prepare us oh Lord God for when you come again oh Lord God and when you create your new the new heavens and the new earth oh Lord God and there's no more sin oh Lord God we would be a people that would be comfortable living there oh Lord God whatever you would say oh Lord God we would end it with amen oh Lord God whatever Direction you would have oh Lord God we would end it with amen oh Lord God lord I pray that the message comes across oh Lord God lord you see those in the audience oh Lord God they have they have needs oh Lord God some of them have Wayward kids some of them want a deeper relationship with you some of them are sick in the body Lord I ask that you would touch them oh Lord God I ask that you would be with them oh Lord God Lord help them to realiz help them to be a genuine Christian oh Lord God and that as the first step would take care of all the disease oh Lord God in the beginning when Adam was this perfect example of a Christian there was no disease Lord there was no sickness oh Lord God there was no fear oh Lord Jesus Christ you had everything there for him and you were his protection oh Lord God and as we receive your word today oh Lord God according to your pattern you have to treat us the same oh Lord God I ask that you will bless bless the uh rest of the service in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Applause] amen trous job well praise the Lord my God what a word I was sitting there just thinking you know uh brother Billy Paul was said best if God thought it the prophet said it that settles

he was talking about the uh in Luther's day being justified and smoking and Wesley's day being Sanctified and drinking beer and the day of Pentecost um yeah speaking in tongues and going out and committing adultery and the very thing God told the prophet when he first came to him don't smoke Don't drink don't defy yourself with women for there will be a work for you to do when you get older don't be like Luther don't be like Wesley don't be like Pentecost there's a work for you to do when you get older so he he said a lot of things and we want to feed that white dog as much as we can
