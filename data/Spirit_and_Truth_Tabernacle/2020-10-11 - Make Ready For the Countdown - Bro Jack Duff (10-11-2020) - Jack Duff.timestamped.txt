[51:21] hath made herself
[51:24] ready and to her it was granted
[51:29] that she should be arrayed in fine
[51:33] linen clean
[51:36] and white for the fine linen is the
[51:40] righteousness
[51:42] a man of saints and he saith unto me
[51:46] right blessed are they which are called
[51:49] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[51:52] and he saith unto me these are the true
[51:56] sayings of god amen the lord of the
[51:59] blessing to the reading of his word
[52:00] shall we bow in a word of prayer father
[52:03] we are grateful
[52:05] for the privilege and the opportunity we
[52:07] have to stand in your presence
[52:09] uh we trust that the holy ghost would
[52:12] take complete control
[52:13] over uh our thought here today
[52:18] you would get all the glory and all the
[52:19] honor uh from it
[52:21] you would bless our uh coming together
[52:24] you would speak from heaven to our
[52:27] circumstances and situations
[52:29] and god that you would be glorified and
[52:32] magnified
[52:33] in this place we're careful to give you
[52:36] all the honor on the glory we
[52:38] have felt your presence amen through the
[52:40] worship
[52:41] also through the specials and now god
[52:44] may we feel your presence through the
[52:46] preaching of the word of god
[52:49] uh we take every spirit that's against
[52:51] the spirit of god underneath the control
[52:53] of the holy spirit even right now
[52:55] it's in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[52:59] amen god bless you can be seated
[53:11] praise the lord um so we want to just
[53:14] use
[53:14] for a title today uh
[53:18] make ready for the countdown
[53:21] amen make ready for the countdown
[53:25] um as uh the church
[53:29] knows we have been working our way
[53:32] through
[53:32] a vision and um being that this
[53:36] year uh 2020 a man
[53:40] i considered a year of vision amen
[53:44] uh but uh i think it's something greater
[53:47] than
[53:47] just my uh my personal
[53:50] a man vision that i might have for
[53:52] myself uh
[53:54] uh if i had a a career that i was
[53:57] chasing a man it's greater than my
[53:59] career
[54:00] amen uh the business that the lord has
[54:03] allowed us to get
[54:04] uh started it's greater than the
[54:06] business
[54:07] amen uh and whatever it is that you are
[54:11] a part of
[54:12] uh we are trying to elevate the church
[54:15] to a place where they begin to recognize
[54:19] uh that god's vision is the greatest
[54:21] vision that we could be
[54:22] pursuing praise the lord amen
[54:26] and uh so we have been working our way
[54:28] through uh
[54:29] a number of statements that have been
[54:32] made by the angel of the lord
[54:34] when he told the prophet to pick up his
[54:36] pen
[54:37] and write and uh we just been uh taking
[54:40] a journey for this entire year
[54:42] uh paragraph by paragraph uh through
[54:44] this and uh we have uh
[54:46] found a man a little subject out of one
[54:49] of the other paragraphs that we'll
[54:50] address in a little bit uh but we found
[54:53] a little subject that we want to talk
[54:54] about today make
[54:55] ready for the countdown amen for the
[54:58] countdown so
[54:59] uh if you don't mind let me just start
[55:02] this sermon by
[55:03] giving uh a few quotes from the message
[55:06] that the prophet preached the first
[55:08] first will come from the message the
[55:10] countdown and then my second quote will
[55:13] come from
[55:14] a message countdown brother branham
[55:15] preached this multiple times but here
[55:18] he says amen uh in 1962 he says god
[55:24] uh i think uh it should be 1125 e
[55:27] amen uh it says god has got a new
[55:30] system praise the lord he said it's not
[55:34] the old system it's a new system
[55:37] he's bringing his church up and now this
[55:40] is the key
[55:41] statement that is being made here uh as
[55:44] he's bringing the church up
[55:46] glory to god if you just look at that
[55:48] pyramid over here to my right
[55:50] uh we have uh the church starting off in
[55:52] the days of
[55:53] paul a man uh in the in in the church a
[55:56] church age of ephesians the ephesus
[55:59] church age
[56:00] and it works its way up the left of the
[56:02] next church age to smyrna this is
[56:03] gentile church ages after jesus had come
[56:06] amen up because jesus came to the jews
[56:09] amen he came to his own his own received
[56:12] him not
[56:12] but paul has begun to try to bring the
[56:14] gospel to the to
[56:16] the jews the jews which was rejected
[56:19] so paul made a statement there in the
[56:20] book of acts it says we turn to the
[56:22] gentiles
[56:24] and since that day god has been working
[56:26] with gentile
[56:27] church ages amen until where we are a
[56:30] day
[56:31] today where he he started with paul went
[56:33] up through ephesus
[56:34] and arenas was the messenger to smyrna
[56:37] and then martin the messenger to
[56:38] pergamos and then
[56:39] columba the message to thiatera luther
[56:42] martin luther was the messenger to
[56:44] the church age of sardis and then john
[56:46] wesley
[56:48] messenger to the church age of
[56:49] philadelphia and then we got elijah
[56:52] according to malachi chapter 4 god said
[56:54] i will send you
[56:56] elijah before the great and terrible day
[56:58] of the lord
[56:59] now it's up to you to determine and amen
[57:02] to have it revealed to you who elijah is
[57:05] amen it's not the physical elijah
[57:08] according to scripture
[57:09] amen the spirit of elijah is used
[57:12] five different times praise god we must
[57:16] know where we stand
[57:17] amen when it comes to the word of god
[57:20] amen hallelujah amen
[57:22] your feelings can trick you your
[57:24] emotions can
[57:26] trick you but when you standing on
[57:28] scripture
[57:29] ain't nothing the devil can do against
[57:31] you praise god
[57:33] amen upon this rock i'll build my
[57:37] church and the gates of hell will not
[57:39] prevail
[57:41] but elijah goes amen he's a messenger
[57:44] sent to the church age of laodicea
[57:46] and the word laid to see itself means
[57:49] people's rights
[57:50] hallelujah if this is not an age and
[57:52] time where everything got rights
[57:55] cats have rights dogs have rights
[57:57] children have
[57:58] rights amen everybody got rights
[58:02] praise god this is the age where we
[58:04] needed god to speak to us
[58:06] so we have this but notice amen this is
[58:08] like a pyramid
[58:10] and at the bottom is very wide but as it
[58:12] gets closer and closer to the top
[58:14] it gets narrow now let's read this quote
[58:17] it says um god has got a new system it's
[58:20] not a whole system it's a new
[58:22] system he's bringing his church up
[58:24] they're getting
[58:25] smaller in minority
[58:28] all the time so when you're looking for
[58:31] some great move of god today you're
[58:34] gonna find it in some small place
[58:37] hallelujah god doing great things with
[58:39] with a few people
[58:42] all right now hallelujah they're getting
[58:45] smaller in minority all the time
[58:48] they did in the days of noah hallelujah
[58:51] they did in the days of lot they always
[58:54] do till they get very
[58:56] very very small i like this but still
[59:01] that little grain of god
[59:03] is still moving on and as they get
[59:06] smaller guess what happens
[59:08] they get more powerful and powerful
[59:13] all the time so you can just come to
[59:16] church and somebody starts singing
[59:18] you're not even feeling well in your
[59:20] body hallelujah
[59:22] without somebody even laying hands on
[59:25] you
[59:26] come on somebody amen the anointing will
[59:29] strike you
[59:30] and bring healing to your body why
[59:33] because the church
[59:34] is getting more powerful and more
[59:37] powerful
[59:38] and more powerful all the time
[59:41] demons are leaving because the church is
[59:44] getting more powerful
[59:46] people are being delivered because the
[59:48] church
[59:49] is getting more powerful the sick can't
[59:53] stay

[1:04:42] astronauts and you know when they
[1:04:45] send people to that space station they
[1:04:47] there about himself
[1:04:49] hey man they not they i mean maybe a
[1:04:50] group of them might go here and there
[1:04:52] but most time when people go there there
[1:04:53] by themself
[1:04:54] and and when we talk about going into
[1:04:56] this realm with god you got to leave
[1:04:58] some things behind
[1:05:00] you know when when abraham went to find
[1:05:03] the city whose building maker was god
[1:05:06] abraham had to leave some stuff behind
[1:05:09] he had to leave some family members
[1:05:11] behind he had to leave some good friends
[1:05:13] behind
[1:05:14] because when god calls you god
[1:05:17] calls you
[1:05:21] and and in order to identify yourself as
[1:05:24] abraham see you're gonna face the same
[1:05:26] trial
[1:05:28] you're gonna have to leave something but
[1:05:30] i tell you this
[1:05:31] if you leave something you'll gain
[1:05:34] something
[1:05:37] he goes on to say and remember
[1:05:40] amen in order to get to be an astronaut
[1:05:42] they had to get in a tank
[1:05:45] and they can't control themselves it
[1:05:47] takes
[1:05:48] a radar power and if i can just say
[1:05:51] dynamics
[1:05:53] it takes a radar power and atomic power
[1:05:57] to lift him out beyond space and then
[1:06:00] he's controlled by a tower
[1:06:02] glory it says glory god spiritual
[1:06:05] astronauts is the same
[1:06:07] they come into a tank into a place into
[1:06:10] a body
[1:06:10] and that body is the body of christ then
[1:06:13] it's not them it's not
[1:06:15] it wasn't john glenn it was the tank
[1:06:17] that he was
[1:06:18] in it was the machine he just sat there
[1:06:23] glory he didn't do nothing he just had
[1:06:27] the real
[1:06:28] pure courage to get up there and say
[1:06:31] it's right because science has proved it
[1:06:34] now john glenn can just get in the tank
[1:06:37] and trust what they had done with
[1:06:38] science to say
[1:06:39] if i get in they going to bring me back
[1:06:41] to earth i'm going to make this orbit
[1:06:44] around earth and i'm gonna come
[1:06:45] right back down to where they say i'm
[1:06:47] supposed to land he had
[1:06:48] confidence he had faith in that brother
[1:06:51] i have put my faith in the word of god
[1:06:54] i put my confidence on what god said in
[1:06:58] his
[1:06:58] bible praise god amen
[1:07:02] amen i know that this message will get
[1:07:04] me home i know that it's the right thing
[1:07:06] because god promised it
[1:07:08] according to scripture
[1:07:11] that's why i believe the way i believe
[1:07:14] all right all right all right all right
[1:07:16] all right
[1:07:17] okay let me skip on here i'm going to go
[1:07:19] to spoken words original seat
[1:07:21] amen i'm going to paragraph 437
[1:07:24] on this praise god hallelujah
[1:07:28] hallelujah my my my it's so hard for me
[1:07:31] to skip some of these things that i that
[1:07:33] i have for you
[1:07:34] uh on today but i i'm i'm trusting that
[1:07:37] the lord will help us
[1:07:38] uh let's go for it this is uh we we
[1:07:41] dealt with this for the past two weeks
[1:07:42] but now i'm going forward
[1:07:44] amen and this thought this again is the
[1:07:46] angel telling the prophet pick up your
[1:07:47] pen and write and these were the things
[1:07:49] that were written and they were
[1:07:51] concerning the bribe
[1:07:52] the church the bride amen uh for this
[1:07:55] day
[1:07:55] he says concerning the word and the
[1:07:57] bride amen so here we are
[1:07:59] uh picking this up and we're i want to
[1:08:02] say we are
[1:08:03] living it amen we're walking into this
[1:08:05] vision that god has we're stepping into
[1:08:08] it glory to god
[1:08:09] and and i i i find it uh quite
[1:08:12] uh supernatural that as we're going
[1:08:15] through this series
[1:08:16] god actually gave a man a supernatural
[1:08:19] uh vision to the church by way of a
[1:08:21] dream
[1:08:22] and the dream correctly interpreted his
[1:08:24] vision so i know i know we're on the
[1:08:26] right path
[1:08:27] i know god's got us right where he wants
[1:08:29] us and and i hope as a church that we
[1:08:31] can catch what god is doing in this hour
[1:08:34] amen so look the prophet makes this
[1:08:35] statement he's right picking up his pen
[1:08:37] he's writing
[1:08:38] he says how can you tell them he's
[1:08:40] talking about the two churches i mean
[1:08:41] the two spirits
[1:08:42] within the framework of the church
[1:08:43] always remember there's a false spirit
[1:08:45] and a true spirit
[1:08:47] in midst in the midst of the church
[1:08:49] glory to god
[1:08:51] don't don't look outside amen looking
[1:08:53] for the devil do something outside
[1:08:54] he comes into the church he actually
[1:08:57] wants worship from the church
[1:09:00] and i'm i'm gonna share a quote with
[1:09:02] y'all today some of the sisters may not
[1:09:04] realize
[1:09:05] certain things you do amen you actually
[1:09:08] worship the devil and don't even realize
[1:09:09] it
[1:09:12] praise the lord i'm gonna share a quote
[1:09:15] with you today amen there's certain
[1:09:16] things you do
[1:09:17] there's a struggle that you have praise
[1:09:20] the lord
[1:09:21] amen a struggle to want to paint
[1:09:23] sometime
[1:09:25] and when you fall to that struggle you
[1:09:28] actually worship the devil
[1:09:30] i'm going to give you the quote when you
[1:09:33] fall to that that temptation you're
[1:09:35] actually worshiping the devil
[1:09:37] you actually show in on your body
[1:09:40] that you love the devil more than you
[1:09:42] love god
[1:09:44] you saw it on your fingernails you show
[1:09:47] it on your toenails
[1:09:49] and then you take pictures like that
[1:09:55] and the devil just sit back saying see
[1:09:57] see god i got him
[1:09:59] he always wanted worship and he'll use
[1:10:03] your body to get
[1:10:05] it all right
[1:10:09] praise the lord church it's it's the
[1:10:11] truth in the heart so
[1:10:12] amen i i'm trying to tell you got to
[1:10:15] make ready for this
[1:10:16] countdown amen hallelujah let me let me
[1:10:19] finish this now he says
[1:10:21] how can you tell them give them the word
[1:10:23] test
[1:10:24] how can you know it speak the word see
[1:10:26] what the word see what they say about it
[1:10:28] if they don't believe the word they have
[1:10:30] no seed turn in them
[1:10:31] they are of the evil one and deceive you
[1:10:35] as the first bride was deceived and the
[1:10:38] second bride was deceived talk about
[1:10:40] adam and eve
[1:10:41] and then talk about uh the children of
[1:10:43] israel uh coming underneath moses
[1:10:45] teachings
[1:10:45] they were deceived they wanted a king
[1:10:47] rather than go with the gospel amen as
[1:10:49] he was sending through a prophet
[1:10:50] he said as the the second bribe was
[1:10:52] deceived they
[1:10:53] all deceive us of the third bride which
[1:10:56] is representing us
[1:10:57] by hybriding the word or trying to
[1:11:01] glory to god amen tell you don't mean
[1:11:03] that no more hybrid the word of god
[1:11:05] amen god never plays signs ahead of his
[1:11:08] word
[1:11:08] amen that's a scorcher god never plays
[1:11:11] signs ahead of work now you got to get
[1:11:12] what the angel's trying to tell you
[1:11:14] because people will see miracles and and
[1:11:16] great manifestations of the spirit and
[1:11:18] i'm telling you it is the genuine holy
[1:11:20] spirit causing them to do what they do
[1:11:22] but it does not mean anything if it's
[1:11:24] not in line with the word of god
[1:11:27] amen hallelujah that's the thing that we
[1:11:30] want to watch because god never played
[1:11:32] signs ahead of his word
[1:11:34] amen that's a scorcher god never played
[1:11:36] signs ahead of his work
[1:11:37] they were added for proof of the word
[1:11:40] but the word
[1:11:41] is first glory to god
[1:11:45] to prove it elijah said to the woman
[1:11:47] bake me a cake
[1:11:48] first then watch the miracle happen come
[1:11:50] to the word
[1:11:51] first then watch the miracle the c word
[1:11:54] itself is what the holy spirit energizes
[1:11:57] now i'm going forward amen we were there
[1:11:59] for two weeks now let me move forward
[1:12:01] amen in this next paragraph
[1:12:03] says how can a messenger sent from god
[1:12:06] just believe some of the scriptures
[1:12:07] and not all the words have you got a
[1:12:09] prophet telling you that it don't mean
[1:12:11] that no more in the scripture
[1:12:12] that prophet is not from god amen
[1:12:16] not from god how can a messenger sent
[1:12:18] from god
[1:12:19] just believe some of the scriptures and
[1:12:21] not all the word deny part of it look at
[1:12:23] it says the true prophet of god will
[1:12:25] proclaim the word
[1:12:27] in the last days and notice what he says
[1:12:30] denominations
[1:12:31] will hate him so truth anyhow
[1:12:35] denominations will hate him he will not
[1:12:38] pull any punches on them he will be like
[1:12:41] he was
[1:12:42] when he come at the first coming of
[1:12:44] christ you generation of vipers
[1:12:48] now now now i'm i'm reading to you what
[1:12:50] the angel told the prophet say he says
[1:12:52] when this messenger come
[1:12:53] now here he is the messenger writing
[1:12:55] down what the angels say
[1:12:56] and brother branham if the angels say
[1:12:58] now he's not gonna pull no punches and
[1:13:00] when i read to y'all this quote
[1:13:02] about worshiping the devil not even
[1:13:04] realizing that's brother branham not
[1:13:06] pulling any punches
[1:13:07] now now most churches that you go to
[1:13:09] they won't quote things like that they
[1:13:11] won't say
[1:13:12] things like that they're against that
[1:13:14] because they won't
[1:13:15] hallelujah they just want people in the
[1:13:17] church
[1:13:18] glory to god amen we want people but we
[1:13:21] not just any people we want the bride
[1:13:24] all right let me go he says he will not
[1:13:26] pull any punches on them
[1:13:28] he would be like he was when he come in
[1:13:29] the first coming of christ you
[1:13:31] generation of vipers but the
[1:13:32] predestinated
[1:13:34] will hear and not only that when they
[1:13:37] hear it guess what they're going to do
[1:13:38] and we'll make ready
[1:13:41] [Laughter]
[1:13:43] glory when we hear this we're going to
[1:13:46] make
[1:13:46] ready for the countdown the royal seat
[1:13:50] of abraham's faith like him
[1:13:51] holding to the word of god regardless
[1:13:56] for he was predestinated now i want to
[1:13:59] just take
[1:14:00] my time here so let's just let's just
[1:14:02] let's just
[1:14:03] uh bear bear with me just a little bit
[1:14:05] glory hallelujah now
[1:14:08] um i read to you here out of genesis
[1:14:11] i'm sorry revelation 19 let us be verse
[1:14:14] 7 says let us
[1:14:15] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:14:17] him

[1:14:21] and his
[1:14:22] wife hath made herself
[1:14:25] ready the wife has to make herself
[1:14:29] ready i'm just kind of meditating on the
[1:14:31] scripture and
[1:14:33] and uh you know and also this quote here
[1:14:35] where brother branham i mean the angel
[1:14:37] lord say
[1:14:38] you know the uh the say they will they
[1:14:40] will hear his voice the predestination
[1:14:42] will hear and make ready for the
[1:14:43] countdown
[1:14:44] uh that that that that's that's the the
[1:14:47] same thing is what the scripture says
[1:14:49] my sheep hear my voice and a stranger
[1:14:51] they won't follow
[1:14:52] i preached to y'all a few weeks ago
[1:14:54] about um amen
[1:14:57] impossible deception impossible
[1:15:00] matthew 24 24 says if it were possible
[1:15:04] it would deceive the very lead and then
[1:15:06] i told you when i came to
[1:15:08] understand his message i rested on that
[1:15:11] scripture
[1:15:12] i i i claim that i am one of god's very
[1:15:16] elect
[1:15:17] and it's impossible for me to be
[1:15:19] deceived
[1:15:21] hallelujah impossible right so

[1:15:27] hear it come from god's prophet

[1:19:31] sisters in christ
[1:19:33] if you're dressing it's not up to the
[1:19:35] occasion
[1:19:37] of the word of god then everything else

[1:19:46] your dressing has to be according to the
[1:19:48] word of god
[1:19:50] you can go through all that other stuff
[1:19:52] but it won't mean nothing if you come in
[1:19:54] without a dress
[1:19:57] everybody waiting to see what this dress
[1:19:59] gonna look like and do you know the
[1:20:01] dress is something hidden

[1:23:13] to be dressed appropriately
[1:23:15] amen amen amen so you know here we got
[1:23:19] to understand that we're
[1:23:20] we're getting married to christ and the
[1:23:21] scripture tells us let us be glad
[1:23:23] and rejoice for the marriage of lamb has
[1:23:25] come and his wife hath
[1:23:27] made herself ready now when it says have
[1:23:30] made herself ready that means you got to
[1:23:32] do some things
[1:23:34] all right all right let me just read
[1:23:36] something here to you
[1:23:38] glory glory glory glory uh this is out
[1:23:41] of the
[1:23:42] um the message
[1:23:45] oh my lord the marriage of the lamb
[1:23:50] there's some things you got to do now
[1:23:52] the prophet says this he says
[1:23:54] so many says if the lord will take this
[1:23:59] evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:24:03] or from gambling or from lying
[1:24:06] or stealing i'll serve him if god will
[1:24:09] take these things from it then i'll
[1:24:11] serve him
[1:24:11] now look at what he says he says but
[1:24:14] that's up to you
[1:24:16] there's not a thing where you ask god to
[1:24:18] take it from you this is a thing where
[1:24:20] you actually give it up
[1:24:22] the scriptures say lay it down let you
[1:24:24] got to lay aside that mean i'm holding
[1:24:30] it in my hand
[1:24:32] i got it in my hand but the bible say
[1:24:35] lay aside
[1:24:36] every sin and every weight that so
[1:24:39] easily
[1:24:40] besets you so here i got it in my hand
[1:24:43] and you praying
[1:24:44] god take this from me but while you're
[1:24:46] praying you just grabbing more and more
[1:24:48] god
[1:24:48] take this from me god take this from me
[1:24:51] he can't even pry your hand
[1:24:53] open to get it out of your hand so what
[1:24:56] the scripture tells you to do is
[1:25:00] it's not god taken from me you're
[1:25:03] smoking you're drinking you're cursing
[1:25:05] you're lying
[1:25:06] you're stealing you're cheating you got
[1:25:08] to lay it down
[1:25:15] say that's up to you he said that's
[1:25:17] something you see
[1:25:18] you got to do something too it says uh
[1:25:21] they that overcome shall inherit all
[1:25:23] things
[1:25:24] that mean you gotta have something that
[1:25:26] you overcame
[1:25:27] if you're gonna inherit something you
[1:25:29] got to have something in your life to
[1:25:31] overcome
[1:25:32] praise god he says uh uh they that
[1:25:35] overcome
[1:25:36] you have power to do it i like that
[1:25:41] some of y'all say i'm too weak to do it
[1:25:42] pastor no you got power to do it
[1:25:45] amen but you must be willing to lay it
[1:25:48] down see
[1:25:49] she has made herself ready i like that
[1:25:52] word
[1:25:54] says you see god could not push us
[1:25:56] through a little pipe
[1:25:58] pull us out on the other end and then
[1:26:00] say blessed is he
[1:26:01] that overcometh you had nothing overcome
[1:26:04] you
[1:26:04] he just pushed you through but you got
[1:26:07] to make a decision
[1:26:08] for yourself i have to make decisions
[1:26:11] for myself
[1:26:12] in doing that we show our faith and
[1:26:14] respects to god
[1:26:16] now when you make a decision to follow
[1:26:18] god follows work you are showing your
[1:26:20] respect to god
[1:26:22] now can we go back now i want to read
[1:26:24] this to you
[1:26:25] glory to god all right
[1:26:28] all right yes i think it's appropriate
[1:26:32] amen uh all right so as i was just this
[1:26:36] week i was just blessed by some of the
[1:26:39] uh tapes that i was listening to and
[1:26:40] this is a message god is evil age
[1:26:43] i'm starting at paragraph 89. now
[1:26:45] brother branham
[1:26:46] makes a statement in that sermon he says
[1:26:48] you know uh it was no
[1:26:50] other age like this age i want you to
[1:26:54] understand
[1:26:54] what you're battling in this age is all
[1:26:57] the spirits
[1:26:59] from every other age amen they have they
[1:27:03] have uh
[1:27:04] accumulated right or not
[1:27:07] and seemed like they almost multiplied
[1:27:09] but every spirit that paul was battling
[1:27:12] amen every spirit that iranians martin
[1:27:14] columba luther wesley
[1:27:16] all of those spirits have rules i mean
[1:27:18] have come to the top
[1:27:19] in this age so i i realize that what
[1:27:23] we're battling is not easy
[1:27:25] amen we're going through things that
[1:27:27] people have never gone through
[1:27:28] other agents that never had to go
[1:27:30] through these type of things other ages
[1:27:32] didn't have to worry about some of these
[1:27:33] scriptures that we have to
[1:27:34] we have to bring up every once in a
[1:27:36] while because they just had that thing
[1:27:37] under control
[1:27:39] hallelujah but now we're we're fighting
[1:27:41] things amen
[1:27:43] uh um my that you know it's going to
[1:27:46] take
[1:27:46] almighty god it's going to take the holy
[1:27:48] ghost to keep you
[1:27:52] now what why he's watch what he say here
[1:27:53] in this message god that's hebrew 8.
[1:27:55] he says now let's watch it be manifested
[1:27:59] he says he is making a better world for
[1:28:02] them to live in so this is
[1:28:04] this is what uh satan is doing satan
[1:28:05] always wanted worship
[1:28:07] it says he's making a better world for
[1:28:09] them to live in by his
[1:28:10] knowledge apart from the never failing
[1:28:12] word of god but by his coming together
[1:28:15] in denominations increasing intellectual
[1:28:18] and scientific and so forth
[1:28:20] he is making a better world for man to
[1:28:22] live in
[1:28:23] and ignoring the promise of god that the
[1:28:26] only time the world will
[1:28:27] will be fit to live in is in the
[1:28:29] millennium
[1:28:31] so no matter what you get amen on this

[1:28:35] i mean the house that you get the car
[1:28:37] that you drive
[1:28:38] amen this world will be never fit to
[1:28:40] live in until we actually come to a
[1:28:41] millennium
[1:28:42] time amen he says you know my opinion
[1:28:45] he's made a better world
[1:28:47] to sin in instead of living

[1:34:27] look at this and she loves him for it
[1:34:29] loves who

[1:35:38] take the air out of the room
[1:35:40] what i'm trying to do is give somebody
[1:35:42] something to live with
[1:35:45] when you leave the room you got
[1:35:47] something to live with something to
[1:35:49] think about
[1:35:51] because maybe you ain't looked at it
[1:35:52] from this angle before
[1:35:55] a prophet is telling you what god's
[1:35:57] thinking i'm gonna go a little further
[1:35:58] let me just finish reading the quote
[1:35:59] then i'm gonna share something with
[1:36:00] y'all i'm gonna share something with you
[1:36:02] let me finish reading this and she
[1:36:04] believes him
[1:36:05] and she loves him for it she hates god
[1:36:09] her own actions prove she does she
[1:36:12] says she she says
[1:36:16] she loves him hallelujah but she loves
[1:36:19] satan
[1:36:20] what a statement she worships
[1:36:24] the god of fashion
[1:36:27] the god of the world amen the hollywood
[1:36:31] goddesses
[1:36:32] she loves him but she hates the true
[1:36:34] word of god
[1:36:36] which is the which is the only true god
[1:36:39] there is
[1:36:40] so we get our examples from what what
[1:36:42] people do on instagram
[1:36:44] we get our examples from you know some
[1:36:47] model or something like that we
[1:36:48] and some of these people that you're
[1:36:49] looking at they done photoshopped them
[1:36:52] to
[1:36:52] they they don't look like that you if
[1:36:55] you saw them in real life you'd be like
[1:36:56] oh my
[1:36:59] man you just you just chasing it don't
[1:37:01] do that chase god
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:08] it says uh legalize it in the churches
[1:37:10] there's no harm our women can do this
[1:37:12] that or the other but in the presence of
[1:37:14] the living god she's not even permitted
[1:37:16] to come
[1:37:17] lest she's repenting amen see he is the
[1:37:21] god
[1:37:22] of worldly beauty he is talking about
[1:37:24] satan
[1:37:25] satan she wants to look beautiful and he
[1:37:28] is the god of beauty
[1:37:29] from the beginning he can and has
[1:37:31] achieved by his knowledge in science
[1:37:33] and materials to make beauty for his
[1:37:35] this model age this modern age rather of
[1:37:38] evil it's made beauty now you go back to
[1:37:41] the beginning those two churches that
[1:37:42] was established in
[1:37:43] in in the garden of eden uh cain had a
[1:37:46] church
[1:37:47] and abel had a church abel's church was
[1:37:49] just messy
[1:37:50] bloody a bloody mess but cain's church
[1:37:53] was a
[1:37:54] church of beauty you understand
[1:37:57] it was a church of beauty so that same
[1:37:59] spirit that was in
[1:38:00] genesis is still living today and when
[1:38:03] we
[1:38:04] fall to that spirit we actually give
[1:38:06] worship to the devil
[1:38:08] and not even realize it
[1:38:13] you ain't gonna hear that in most
[1:38:14] churches but a prophet tells you that
[1:38:19] recently
[1:38:27] i went to get something to eat
[1:38:30] pulled up in the drive-through and as i
[1:38:33] pulled up in the drive-through
[1:38:35] um a young man was taking my order i can
[1:38:38] hear by the voice that this was a young
[1:38:40] man

[1:38:43] he's taking my order
[1:38:45] and um you know we get to
[1:38:49] what i want and you know and it tells me
[1:38:52] the price that it's going to be and says

[1:39:50] to figure some things out
[1:39:54] now now the reason you laughing because
[1:39:56] you know that's not
[1:39:57] normal
[1:40:01] it's not normal to see no man do nothing
[1:40:03] like that
[1:40:04] now that that shocked me i mean i know
[1:40:07] i'm talking to a young man and you stick
[1:40:09] your hand down and i'm seeing it wait a
[1:40:10] minute what
[1:40:11] what doesn't happen there's a spirit
[1:40:13] that jumped on this young man
[1:40:15] some kind of way hallelujah glory to god
[1:40:19] now i want you to understand that the
[1:40:21] way that that young man when he stuck
[1:40:23] his fingers out
[1:40:24] and it shocked me
[1:40:28] sister when you do it it shocks god
[1:40:35] right it wasn't normal for that young
[1:40:38] man to do that
[1:40:39] and it's not normal for us no matter
[1:40:41] whether we're human i mean a woman or
[1:40:43] man that's not normal
[1:40:45] society has made it normal
[1:40:49] but the same way i responded to this
[1:40:51] young man is the same way god responds
[1:40:53] to you
[1:40:57] how you know that because you weren't
[1:40:59] born that way
[1:41:01] you weren't born that way you weren't
[1:41:03] born with all them colors on that's what
[1:41:04] i said see when you when you when you
[1:41:05] take
[1:41:06] paints wear paints
[1:41:09] someone's got the thing we don't
[1:41:11] overcome we i ain't wearing nothing on
[1:41:12] my face i
[1:41:13] i'm i'm i'm beautiful just as i am
[1:41:16] someone's got to that but boy when it
[1:41:18] get to them fingers
[1:41:22] amen church and when they get to them
[1:41:24] fingers we start struggling with fingers
[1:41:30] toes we struggle with our toes
[1:41:35] really that's that's all the devil got
[1:41:37] to offer you
[1:41:38] is toenail polishing fingernail polish
[1:41:41] you can't overcome that
[1:41:46] it's because you serve the god of
[1:41:47] fashion
[1:41:49] and i'm going to tell you if you want to
[1:41:50] overcome the god of fashion you might
[1:41:52] just need to get off instagram
[1:41:55] you might just need to shut down your
[1:41:56] account because it's it's it's it
[1:41:58] bothers you
[1:42:01] you get influenced by all this stuff
[1:42:03] right i mean you and you just see
[1:42:05] somebody with it
[1:42:06] i mean you know used to be a time now we
[1:42:08] got multiple colors on multiple fingers
[1:42:10] and it just
[1:42:11] what is it now and and i'm telling when
[1:42:14] you see it
[1:42:15] on i mean this young man nails was at
[1:42:17] the i don't know i'm
[1:42:18] what is what is this young man that's
[1:42:21] not
[1:42:21] normal young man's supposed to be out
[1:42:23] there working with bricks and
[1:42:25] and all kinds of stuff you don't have no
[1:42:27] fingernail polish doing stuff like that
[1:42:30] but but i had to think about it i had to
[1:42:32] really think about this
[1:42:33] the way it shocked me with him is the
[1:42:36] same way god is
[1:42:37] shocked by our sisters when they do it
[1:42:40] every
[1:42:41] time you do it you can see christ
[1:42:45] wincing
[1:42:49] i'm talking about making ready for the
[1:42:50] countdown i ain't there yet but let me
[1:42:52] let me just work through this
[1:42:54] let me work through this it says i i i
[1:42:56] wrote some notes that says
[1:42:58] i i uh i must admit that it didn't seem
[1:43:01] natural to me to see this young man
[1:43:03] you know doing what he did i was really
[1:43:05] caught off guard as i was not expecting
[1:43:07] that
[1:43:08] it seemed like a mild form of perversion
[1:43:12] right and and then i thought to myself i
[1:43:15] can't
[1:43:16] say that makeup fingernail and toenail
[1:43:19] polish
[1:43:20] are feminine i can't say that and not
[1:43:23] masculine
[1:43:24] why because i think the world we live in
[1:43:27] has made is acceptable
[1:43:29] and made it feminine i said but after
[1:43:33] pondering over the quote that i just
[1:43:35] read
[1:43:35] i realized the same shock i experienced
[1:43:38] in
[1:43:38] seeing this young man in this condition
[1:43:41] is the same
[1:43:42] shock that god has when he sees his
[1:43:45] daughters
[1:43:46] in the same condition
[1:43:50] the quote says that we show a love for
[1:43:51] satan when we paint
[1:43:54] rather than showing a love for god by
[1:43:56] not painting
[1:44:00] amen
[1:44:05] lord thank you amen
[1:44:08] we getting weeds out i told you i told
[1:44:10] you we're gonna get weeds out
[1:44:12] now you know and when i say things like
[1:44:13] that i know i got babies in christ
[1:44:15] and i got i got some that's been around
[1:44:17] for a long time and i know my babes you
[1:44:19] know they're going to learn
[1:44:20] i'm not trying to come against them in
[1:44:22] any way that's not what
[1:44:23] that's not when i say things like this i
[1:44:25] can't apologize for the word
[1:44:27] but i'm not trying to hurt people i'm
[1:44:28] not trying to do that i'm trying to help
[1:44:30] people
[1:44:31] and and you know sometimes i was
[1:44:33] thinking about this you know when you uh
[1:44:34] when you got kids at home
[1:44:36] and you got a child at maybe five years
[1:44:39] old
[1:44:39] and then you got another one that's 15
[1:44:41] years old and maybe something goes wrong
[1:44:43] in the house
[1:44:44] praise the lord right now when you talk
[1:44:46] to that five-year-old you're gonna say
[1:44:48] it a certain way
[1:44:50] praise the lord amen and the
[1:44:52] fifteen-year-old gonna hear you how you
[1:44:53] say it to the five-year-old
[1:44:55] and then the 15-year-old expecting you
[1:44:58] praise god to talk to them the same way
[1:45:01] but then after you finish reprimanding
[1:45:03] the five-year-old don't do that johnny
[1:45:06] don't do that now i mean look i'm gonna
[1:45:08] give you a chance now next time you do
[1:45:10] something like that
[1:45:11] you know it's gonna be different
[1:45:12] repercussions you understand johnny
[1:45:14] yes daddy yes
[1:45:18] now bill boy
[1:45:22] i'ma tell you now johnny gonna hear you
[1:45:26] talk to bill
[1:45:26] a different way than you talk to johnny
[1:45:29] praise the lord right
[1:45:31] and it's because you already had that
[1:45:33] talk with
[1:45:34] beetle you already told him next time
[1:45:37] it's gonna be so now he has reached next
[1:45:42] time
[1:45:45] and some of y'all don't reach next time
[1:45:48] spiritually you don't reach
[1:45:49] next time so so i have to say
[1:45:52] things to try to get your attention you
[1:45:55] are
[1:45:56] worshiping the devil when you do that
[1:46:04] you say you love god you say it
[1:46:08] but you've proven that you love the
[1:46:10] devil more
[1:46:18] alright
[1:46:22] pause for effect
[1:46:29] let me just read something here but i
[1:46:30] had to get that in today now this is
[1:46:32] gonna be a two-part sermon don't worry i
[1:46:34] got the i got the first part the real
[1:46:36] good part i got that out the way already
[1:46:38] glory to god
[1:46:41] i want to just read the scripture here
[1:46:43] acts 15 14.
[1:46:45] i want to read this amen acts 15 14.
[1:46:50] uh here the bible says
[1:46:54] simon have declared how god
[1:46:57] at the first did visit the gentiles
[1:47:00] to take out of them a people for his
[1:47:03] name
[1:47:04] amen so god visit the gentiles to take
[1:47:07] out of them now not all the gentiles
[1:47:09] gonna make it
[1:47:10] you understand i just went through this
[1:47:12] this this church age from
[1:47:14] from from paul all the way up to this
[1:47:16] day god dealing with the gentiles
[1:47:17] but not all the gentiles gonna make it
[1:47:20] glory to god
[1:47:21] amen but god is going to call out of the
[1:47:23] gentiles
[1:47:25] of people amen for his name
[1:47:28] this this this group that is calling out
[1:47:30] of gentiles this people's name
[1:47:32] these are people that got to make
[1:47:33] themselves ready for the countdown
[1:47:36] hallelujah amen now i wanna i wanna
[1:47:38] underst i want you to understand
[1:47:40] there's three exodus that that that that
[1:47:43] will occur
[1:47:43] amen the first exodus according to
[1:47:46] scripture back in the book of exodus
[1:47:48] amen was god bringing israel out of
[1:47:52] egypt now i need you to understand egypt
[1:47:54] is a type
[1:47:55] of the world glory to god so when god
[1:47:59] brought israel out of
[1:48:00] egypt he brought them out of the world
[1:48:03] and when god brings you out he brings
[1:48:06] you out of the world
[1:48:08] so you don't hold on to things in the
[1:48:10] world no more look at this he said it
[1:48:12] says
[1:48:13] uh the pillow fire of of bringing israel
[1:48:16] out of each it was called
[1:48:17] amen a nation out of a nation
[1:48:21] amen brother branham also said this was
[1:48:23] a natural
[1:48:24] exodus out of the natural the second
[1:48:26] exodus
[1:48:27] was christ also the pill of fire and i
[1:48:30] love that because
[1:48:32] when when paul was on the road to
[1:48:33] damascus
[1:48:35] amen paul had a conversation with the
[1:48:38] lord jesus christ it was a great
[1:48:40] light that was shining over paul and as
[1:48:42] paul began to talk to this great light
[1:48:44] he said who
[1:48:45] art thou lord and the light itself spoke
[1:48:49] back to paul and said i am
[1:48:52] jesus so the light that led the children
[1:48:56] of
[1:48:56] israel out of egypt was jesus christ in
[1:49:00] the form of light
[1:49:01] and paul met that same light on the road
[1:49:05] to damascus
[1:49:06] but that light also had a body
[1:49:11] oh hallelujah now i need you to
[1:49:14] understand why it had a body
[1:49:16] amen because it's the same way amen uh
[1:49:20] i was gonna read this a little early but
[1:49:21] but but when we're sharing the word
[1:49:23] amen the seed word has to pass through
[1:49:27] the body praise god i like that
[1:49:32] the c word has to pass through the body
[1:49:34] somebody gonna have to tell you about
[1:49:36] this
[1:49:37] amen you might get a dream you might get
[1:49:39] this but somebody gonna end up telling
[1:49:41] you something
[1:49:42] somebody's gonna tell you they're
[1:49:43] experiencing when they're telling you
[1:49:45] their experience
[1:49:46] the seed is passing through the body
[1:49:51] hallelujah glory to god amen so so paul
[1:49:54] met this light on the road to damascus
[1:49:57] and the light was identified
[1:49:59] as jesus christ now i want you to
[1:50:01] understand that same light
[1:50:04] took a picture with his prophet
[1:50:09] in this day and they recorded it they
[1:50:12] got it on they got on on camera
[1:50:14] and it's the only supernatural being
[1:50:17] that has been
[1:50:18] put on camera and they have it there in
[1:50:19] washington dc
[1:50:21] and um this
[1:50:24] the library of congress they have it
[1:50:26] there so you know when we talk about you
[1:50:28] know
[1:50:29] um brother branham being amen the
[1:50:32] prophet and all that
[1:50:33] look god vindicated that we don't have
[1:50:37] to vindicate that
[1:50:38] god already did that oh yes
[1:50:41] amen god already did it so so so that
[1:50:43] same pillow fire that paul
[1:50:45] saw the same pill of fire that moses saw
[1:50:48] is the same pill of fire that took his
[1:50:50] picture above the prophet's head and
[1:50:52] it's hanging
[1:50:53] in washington dc
[1:50:56] that's for the third exodus because in
[1:50:58] the third exodus
[1:51:00] it's amen it's the same pill of fire
[1:51:02] taking the bride
[1:51:03] out of the church glory to god
[1:51:06] amen uh the first one took israel out of
[1:51:09] egypt
[1:51:10] the sacrament took amen the church out
[1:51:12] of judaism to
[1:51:13] judaism and now the third one is to take
[1:51:16] the pride out of the church
[1:51:18] call the people for his name it's the
[1:51:21] spiritual
[1:51:22] out of the spiritual which is also the
[1:51:24] bride coming out of denominations
[1:51:26] the bible say come out of her my people
[1:51:30] revelation 18 4. and you all are
[1:51:32] experiencing that and not even realizing
[1:51:34] you are part of a vision
[1:51:38] all right let's read this out of
[1:51:42] god in this evil age paragraph 35.
[1:51:45] i want to just read a little bit here
[1:51:48] and
[1:51:49] we might find a way to cut off and then
[1:51:51] uh i'll be back
[1:51:53] praise the lord lord i said it god thank
[1:51:56] you jesus
[1:51:57] it's it's sad it says it's off me now
[1:51:59] it's off me huh
[1:52:01] you talk about somebody that's free i'm
[1:52:03] free
[1:52:05] free at last free at last
[1:52:09] thank god almighty i'm free at last
[1:52:15] i hate the devil i just got to expose
[1:52:17] him wherever i can
[1:52:18] amen amen he wants some worship you
[1:52:20] ain't going to get nothing here
[1:52:23] amen you ain't going to get nothing here
[1:52:25] praise the lord
[1:52:27] praise the lord praise the lord praise
[1:52:29] the lord
[1:52:30] all right all right this god is evil age
[1:52:33] amen
[1:52:34] now uh the prophet says what would god
[1:52:37] call a people
[1:52:37] out of this evil age for his name why
[1:52:40] would he do that
[1:52:42] the reason is to try her so god
[1:52:45] calls the people out for his namesake
[1:52:48] and the reason he calls him out is to
[1:52:49] try
[1:52:50] her watch this his bride
[1:52:54] when she is made manifest then tried
[1:52:58] been proven proved to satan
[1:53:01] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[1:53:04] be at the end
[1:53:06] watch this as a seed starts in the
[1:53:09] ground it comes up through caries
[1:53:11] the life of it but it ends up the same
[1:53:13] seed that uh that it was
[1:53:14] when it was in the ground when it went
[1:53:16] in the ground and the same way the seed
[1:53:18] of deceit fell in the ground in
[1:53:19] eden is the same way it ends up in the
[1:53:22] last days
[1:53:23] just as the gospel was when it fell to
[1:53:26] denomination at night see a rome
[1:53:28] it ends up in a super organization
[1:53:31] just as the seed of the church fell back
[1:53:34] there with the signs and wonders
[1:53:36] and the living christ among them it ends
[1:53:38] up in the last days
[1:53:39] under the ministry of malachi 4
[1:53:44] and restores back again the original
[1:53:46] faith that was once given i say amen to
[1:53:48] that
[1:53:49] look at this he says we find now
[1:53:52] this evil age the reason god
[1:53:56] called you the reason god revealed this
[1:53:59] message to you the reason god i mean
[1:54:02] some of y'all got
[1:54:03] powerful testimonies as to how you
[1:54:05] entered through these doors amen you
[1:54:08] know it's nothing but almighty god
[1:54:10] that placed you here but the devil been
[1:54:13] fighting your testimony
[1:54:14] but i want you to understand the reason
[1:54:17] why god
[1:54:17] called you uh and i got good news in
[1:54:20] this amen
[1:54:21] i got real good news when we get this
[1:54:23] reason god
[1:54:24] got confidence in you yeah he sees you
[1:54:27] struggling
[1:54:28] he sees you falling sometimes but his
[1:54:30] grace is there to pick you right back
[1:54:33] up why because he got confidence
[1:54:36] in you that you will not be like eve
[1:54:40] look at this look at this he says we
[1:54:42] find now this evil age is approved to
[1:54:44] satan
[1:54:45] she is not like eve glory
[1:54:48] and that she is not that type of woman i
[1:54:51] like that statement
[1:54:52] satan i'm not that kind of woman the
[1:54:55] reason that i don't do this and i don't
[1:54:57] do that
[1:54:58] is because i'm not that kind of woman
[1:55:01] you can't try me like that you can't
[1:55:04] speak to me like that
[1:55:05] because i'm not that kind of woman
[1:55:10] you got to be able to speak back to the
[1:55:12] devil no seeks and i'm not that kind of
[1:55:13] woman
[1:55:15] hallelujah glory to god he says she is
[1:55:19] not that type of woman
[1:55:20] and she will be tried by his word
[1:55:23] the bride as adam's bride was tried by
[1:55:26] the word
[1:55:27] glory and adam's pride believed every
[1:55:30] bit of the word all but confused
[1:55:32] on one promise she believed everything
[1:55:35] but got confused on one little thing
[1:55:38] and i don't want you to get tripped up
[1:55:40] on one little thing
[1:55:42] i want to expose the devil i want you to
[1:55:44] if there's nothing else you get from
[1:55:46] this message today
[1:55:47] i haven't really got to my topic yet but
[1:55:50] there's nothing else you get
[1:55:51] when you decide to paint
[1:55:54] you're actually bringing worship to the
[1:55:58] devil
[1:56:02] that's what the prophet told us when you
[1:56:04] do that
[1:56:06] it brings worship to the devil praise
[1:56:09] the lord
[1:56:11] all right all right now
[1:56:14] now look there was only one woman in the
[1:56:16] bible
[1:56:18] that painted her name was
[1:56:21] jezebel is the truth jezebel was a pagan
[1:56:27] idol worshiper so we should not take our
[1:56:31] example from jezebel
[1:56:34] amen church i don't care who doing it
[1:56:38] i don't care who's standing the pulpit
[1:56:39] with it on
[1:56:41] if it's against the word of god then
[1:56:43] it's against the word of god
[1:56:44] bottom line
[1:56:47] and god wants some people that's gonna
[1:56:49] stay with his word
[1:56:51] regardless of how they feel
[1:56:54] well they gonna pick at me so let them
[1:56:56] pick at me they picked that
[1:56:58] noah right hey they picked that jesus
[1:57:03] they i'm sure they picked that paul and
[1:57:05] peter hey man there was some there were
[1:57:07] some some boys that picked at a prophet
[1:57:09] one time
[1:57:10] called them old ball head going up old
[1:57:13] paw head
[1:57:15] speaking of the prophet now he had the
[1:57:17] holy ghost
[1:57:18] so he did something that you shouldn't
[1:57:20] do he called two she-bells
[1:57:23] two shoes come out the woods and just
[1:57:25] tear em up damn the pieces
[1:57:27] 42 children died just like that
[1:57:30] because the prophet didn't have the holy
[1:57:32] ghost that's why you need the holy ghost
[1:57:33] to
[1:57:34] control your temple all right
[1:57:38] all right let me go on she would be
[1:57:40] tried by his word the bride as adam's
[1:57:42] bride was tried by the word
[1:57:44] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:57:47] the word
[1:57:48] all but confused on one promise that
[1:57:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:57:53] forever today see
[1:57:54] but failed on one promise under the
[1:57:56] temptation of the enemy
[1:57:58] face to face let's go on and now the
[1:58:01] people that's called
[1:58:03] for call for his name of course is his
[1:58:06] bribe
[1:58:07] she is coming contact again by the same
[1:58:09] thing not by just denominational truth
[1:58:11] or something
[1:58:11] but every word god want to know are you
[1:58:13] going to follow every word
[1:58:16] from the beginning of the bible man was
[1:58:18] given the word of god
[1:58:20] to live by one word misinterpreted
[1:58:24] a man called satan and the person of an
[1:58:27] animal called the serpent
[1:58:29] satan in this person could talk to eve
[1:58:31] and
[1:58:32] misinterpreted the word to her and was
[1:58:34] lost
[1:58:35] see it must be every word
[1:58:39] you're not gonna make it to heaven
[1:58:42] unless you
[1:58:42] following every
[1:58:46] word i want to say it again
[1:58:49] you can come to church any any way you
[1:58:52] want to come
[1:58:53] but we talk about going to heaven
[1:58:57] i'm going to preach like this every
[1:58:59] sunday but sometimes you come in you
[1:59:01] just get by
[1:59:02] then you leave church and
[1:59:07] you you take it off on sat saturday
[1:59:10] night
[1:59:12] come to church on sunday with it i mean
[1:59:14] without it
[1:59:15] but my god before monday hit
[1:59:21] the truth in it high look they ought to
[1:59:24] go out of business because they
[1:59:25] shouldn't be getting your money no more
[1:59:28] because i am telling you every time you
[1:59:30] walk the aisle
[1:59:32] pick it up put it in your pocket you're
[1:59:34] giving the devil some glory
[1:59:41] and he just sitting back and looking at
[1:59:43] god like i told you
[1:59:46] ain't got nothing i got them with polish
[1:59:54] polish god that's all it takes for them
[1:59:57] polish
[2:00:05] you got to make the devil fight a little
[2:00:06] harder than that
[2:00:18] when we stand on malachi 4 being
[2:00:21] the fulfillment they've been fulfilled
[2:00:23] by brother branham brother william aaron
[2:00:25] branham
[2:00:26] we're being tried by the word i want to
[2:00:29] tell you all something when we went
[2:00:30] through this
[2:00:31] this great uh falling away recently a
[2:00:34] lot a lot of folk just
[2:00:35] man you just thought that they had this
[2:00:37] message they were holding on to it but
[2:00:38] there was a big fall in the way
[2:00:40] some of them came after you some of them
[2:00:42] are trying to get you to explain some
[2:00:44] things
[2:00:44] but you're still sitting here today i
[2:00:46] want to tell you when you were going
[2:00:47] through that trial
[2:00:48] you had been tried by the word
[2:00:52] you were being tried by the you didn't
[2:00:54] realize it but you have been tried but
[2:00:55] the the trials was were you gonna hold
[2:00:57] on to the promise
[2:00:59] even when you couldn't explain it
[2:01:04] even when you can explain it i mean you
[2:01:06] know when when when the disciples was
[2:01:08] there and jesus preached this really
[2:01:10] hard sermon because i'm gonna tell you
[2:01:12] i read a quote at the beginning i said
[2:01:14] the church is getting smaller and
[2:01:16] smaller and smaller
[2:01:18] because some of y'all right now like i
[2:01:20] ain't coming back here
[2:01:30] they will fight you but it's not me i i
[2:01:33] i like the way brother john said
[2:01:35] brother sean said it i'm not picking on
[2:01:37] you
[2:01:38] i'm picking off you right
[2:01:42] i'm just trying to help you praise the
[2:01:44] lord somebody got to tell you
[2:01:46] why not me right so so
[2:01:49] you know uh um um you know uh
[2:01:52] the the the thing of it is that you know
[2:01:54] people were were pulling here and
[2:01:55] pulling their and and
[2:01:56] and it was a it was a trial to you to
[2:01:58] see whether you would stay with the word
[2:02:01] when when they did the disciples jesus
[2:02:03] preached the sermon and say um
[2:02:04] lest you eat in my flesh and drink my
[2:02:05] blood you have no part with me
[2:02:07] oh lord i mean the disciples like
[2:02:11] amen jesus because you saying it but i
[2:02:14] don't know
[2:02:15] what you just said and then then it eat
[2:02:18] my flesh what
[2:02:19] wait a minute couldn't explain that next
[2:02:21] thing you know
[2:02:22] uh 80 people it was a church of 82.
[2:02:26] yeah yeah 82 i think and um i said the
[2:02:29] first group got up and jumped up and say
[2:02:32] we out of here we ain't van we ain't
[2:02:34] we're in cannibals we're not eating no
[2:02:35] people we
[2:02:36] we they didn't even try to even
[2:02:37] understand spiritual what was being said
[2:02:39] we're not we're out of here left and and
[2:02:42] maybe maybe some of the disciples
[2:02:44] looking at them and
[2:02:45] you know and and uh going like man that
[2:02:47] was my buddy we had good fellowship what
[2:02:49] in the world what happened
[2:02:51] oh my good jesus you know and peter you
[2:02:54] know peter usually always say
[2:02:56] something but this time peter didn't say
[2:02:58] nothing and maybe one of his friends
[2:03:00] said peter what you're gonna do
[2:03:02] peter you heard what he just said peter
[2:03:05] come on man
[2:03:06] you can't be come on your daddy taught
[2:03:07] you better than that i don't know what
[2:03:09] to do but i'ma stay right here
[2:03:10] so jesus looked at him say um will you
[2:03:13] also go
[2:03:15] say oh my lord what now what am i
[2:03:18] supposed to do with that
[2:03:19] jesus jesus then then peter finally says
[2:03:21] let me say
[2:03:22] lord only you got the words of eternal
[2:03:24] life
[2:03:25] i ain't going nowhere
[2:03:29] and you think jesus would say amen to
[2:03:31] peter
[2:03:34] i mean after the church just got shook
[2:03:36] down
[2:03:38] 80 can you imagine that there's a church
[2:03:40] of yeah
[2:03:41] 82 people 70 left
[2:03:44] and i'm going to tell you the 70 that
[2:03:46] left work signs
[2:03:47] wonders and miracles
[2:03:53] but because of one sermon
[2:03:59] out of all the eating bread and fish and
[2:04:02] everything like
[2:04:04] one sermon calls them folk to leave
[2:04:12] but the church got more powerful
[2:04:16] i'm talking about there was some power
[2:04:17] in the church peter could walk by
[2:04:20] folk and they get healed in his shadow
[2:04:25] church got more power peter couldn't
[2:04:28] explain it
[2:04:29] if he said i ain't going away i ain't
[2:04:31] heard no preaching like this before
[2:04:32] i'ma stay right here with this whether i
[2:04:34] can explain it or not and i'm gonna tell
[2:04:35] you when you couldn't explain to people
[2:04:37] why you was holding on to what you was
[2:04:38] holding on
[2:04:39] you were being tried by the word
[2:04:45] when you stood on revelation 10 7 being
[2:04:48] the fulfillment uh
[2:04:49] been but fulfilled by william mary and
[2:04:51] branham you are being tried by the words
[2:04:54] hallelujah when you stand on water
[2:04:56] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[2:04:59] christ
[2:04:59] you are being tried by the word
[2:05:02] praise god amen when you declare to
[2:05:05] others that there
[2:05:06] isn't three gods but it's one god
[2:05:09] servant in three
[2:05:10] offices you are being tried by
[2:05:13] the word you have no you have an
[2:05:16] understanding that jehovah of the old
[2:05:17] testament
[2:05:18] is jesus of the new
[2:05:22] you're being tried by the word when you
[2:05:24] stand on deuteronomy 22
[2:05:26] 5 and you refuse to put on garments that
[2:05:31] pertain to a man
[2:05:34] you've been tried by
[2:05:37] the word
[2:05:43] and today when you decide i ain't
[2:05:44] painting no more
[2:05:46] because the only woman in scripted ever
[2:05:48] used paint
[2:05:49] was jezebel she's found in second kings
[2:05:51] 9 30 and i want to tell you
[2:05:54] when i look at her when when the prophet
[2:05:57] said
[2:05:57] paints they use paints jezebel might
[2:06:00] have painted her face
[2:06:01] but i'ma tell you that painting produced
[2:06:03] spirits that went to other places
[2:06:06] so when i look at paints today i look at
[2:06:08] makeup i look at toenails
[2:06:11] i look at fingernails and i also look at
[2:06:14] tattoos
[2:06:21] leviticus 19 28.
[2:06:25] let's read it i'm talking making ready
[2:06:31] for the countdown i ain't got y'all into
[2:06:33] this into the
[2:06:34] shuttle yet but before you can get in
[2:06:38] the shuttle we got to get some stuff off
[2:06:42] you
[2:06:44] maybe you didn't read this in the bible
[2:06:48] let's read it ye shall not
[2:06:51] make any cuttings in your flesh
[2:06:56] for the dead
[2:07:00] nor print any marks
[2:07:03] upon you who own your body
[2:07:08] i am the lord who made your body
[2:07:12] who designed your body
[2:07:15] so see when it come to tattoos we don't
[2:07:18] do that either
[2:07:19] as believers i was at a christian
[2:07:23] bookstore one time and i heard somebody
[2:07:25] say
[2:07:26] it's just so therapeutic for me to get a
[2:07:28] tattoo
[2:07:31] what bible are you reading you are in a
[2:07:34] christian
[2:07:35] bookstore what bible are you reading
[2:07:38] talk about is therapeutic
[2:07:39] you just went against the word of god
[2:07:45] but we have a lot nowadays i i was i
[2:07:47] mean i was going to a big church huge
[2:07:49] church
[2:07:49] and one of the pastors he used to always
[2:07:51] have tattoos so when they brought this
[2:07:53] scripture to me
[2:07:54] just explain that thing wait no i don't
[2:07:55] mean that no more what part of not
[2:07:58] printing any marks on your that i mean
[2:08:01] that's so plain and simple that i don't
[2:08:03] i think anybody can get that
[2:08:06] it don't i'm gonna put it this way it
[2:08:08] don't even take a revelation
[2:08:12] it don't even take praying about it it's
[2:08:15] just what it say
[2:08:18] and i i like i like this you should not
[2:08:20] make any cuttings in your flesh
[2:08:22] for the dead comma no
[2:08:30] now to print any marks is not even for
[2:08:31] the dead printed marks means
[2:08:33] no print any marks upon your flesh
[2:08:40] i'm the lord
[2:08:44] now i know saints come to the lord
[2:08:47] they hadn't read these scriptures before
[2:08:49] and they got tattoos
[2:08:51] all over their body i'm not telling you
[2:08:53] to go

[2:09:35] done
[2:09:36] amen praise the lord
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:44] shall we pray
[2:09:49] father uh we have
[2:09:53] heard your word you sent us a prophet
[2:09:57] that would share
[2:09:58] truth with us to help us to see
[2:10:02] the spirit behind many of the things
[2:10:04] that
[2:10:06] are leading us spirits behind things
[2:10:09] that
[2:10:10] are attacking us and lord you told us in
[2:10:15] your word blessed is he that overcometh
[2:10:17] and we realize that there has to be
[2:10:19] something that we will overcome
[2:10:24] sometimes lord is the
[2:10:29] sometimes it may seem like it's very
[2:10:30] little things
[2:10:32] but god has got to be something so
[2:10:33] somebody it might be smoking to another
[2:10:35] it might be drinking
[2:10:37] to know that it might be lust to another
[2:10:40] it might be
[2:10:41] uh figuring out polish to nail polish
[2:10:43] makeup
[2:10:45] so many other things lord that we we
[2:10:47] fight with we struggle with but god you
[2:10:49] have given
[2:10:51] a confidence in us
[2:10:55] you told us that we're going to overcome
[2:10:56] and somehow someway we will
[2:10:58] we're not going to give glory and honor
[2:11:00] to satan
[2:11:02] his wicked devices his plan has been
[2:11:05] exposed
[2:11:07] father our job is to rise up and
[2:11:09] overcome it so lord i pray
[2:11:12] that if a heart has been touched by the
[2:11:15] word of god
[2:11:17] that that heart would god just
[2:11:20] begin to repent right where they are
[2:11:23] while they're in your presence
