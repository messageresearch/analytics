presence of the Lord a man I don't know what both be planning during the week but when it's Church time y'all need to plan to be a church because you never know when God gonna stop in and do something then last night God just kind of stopped in and did a little something for us and man we were just very grateful if some of y'all just enjoying the benefits from what we're started on last night and a man and you know it's good that you get in but I want to here helping to create that a man help create that so we we just we just appreciate the Lord amen musicians I'm not gonna hold y'all up but this is this is one of them a type of Norrington's where you get in it's hard to get out right I mean you just sang keep singing and keep saying it and just just to join the presence of the Lord and then we caught one the waves last night halleluyah halleluyah but there's everything that's been done in the name of Jesus has just been just their own right a man god bless you thank you musicians I appreciate you all let's give the Lord a hand for our musicians a man and a man let's let's get our Bibles we'll read a scripture in man or two I I'm so glad to see a man JJ and ELISA a man this morning so good to see them a man is in service praise the Lord [Applause] always a blessing always a blessing to see him and I know we had a couple of visitors that I heard their names and so glad to have them here and in fellowship as well on this morning and man yesterday I got a call from someone that was asking about when service was starting and when they called me they were speaking to me and Creole and didn't understand that I don't know that many words and in Creole and I wasn't sure if they they made it here not I don't know if they were or you know callin wrong Church what I just told him what time service started and I just left it in God's hands if you know if it was the wrong Church God knew why he did that so you know we praise the Lord for for that a man and a man we just we just appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm gonna I'm gonna turn a man to actually turn with me to James chapter 1 a man James chapter 1 and we'll we'll just read a scripture from there praise the Lord James chapter 1 and I think the song a couple songs the song that we opened the service with a man why should I feel discouraged his eyes on the sparrow that that was I think time right into the sermon then you have God alone you know no matter what I'm going through he's still God and and if if you're a Christian a man Ginuwine Christian you got something you going through everybody in here got something that going through you know because like brother Branham told Billy policy because if he was just complaining about the devil always after me saying that's a good thing so I say why is that a good thing that the devil always after sake because if he always after you that mean he don't got you he's still chasing you alright so keep that devil on the run run until they get tight alright Amen thank you but let's read here too much on my monitor just turn it down just a little bit and let's let's go here to verse 2 says my brother encounted oh joy when you fall into divers temptations that's many a man you go you go from one trial to the next trial to the next trial and what you supposed to do when that happened is actually put a smile on your face you supposed to count it all joy my car stopped working oh praise God hey when you when you and when you get when you get a revelation you're gonna start thanking God you're gonna catch a vision of your new car then you're just gonna be smiling and the devil gonna be looking that's like why are they shopping shopping because the Bible says count it all joy my brother him count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trial of your faith worketh patience but let patience this is the this is key statements let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering so don't ask today and start doubting tomorrow right nothing wavering no matter what you hear just don't waver in your faith so he that waiteth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and stalks you got a such a anchor down right for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord so when you're wavering you'll never get anything from God never right says a double minded man is unstable in all his ways a man so you want to keep the faith no matter what it is that you're you're going through I am I'm gonna I'm let's have a word of Prayer and I'm gonna read another scripture a man after that just kind of set a background for where we will what we'll deal with on today but let's just have this word of Prayer father we we are grateful for the anointing that is in the house today and God when anointing is like this coming to the house is unlimited what you could do in the midst of your people so God as we enter into a man just thought for today the less the ears that were here bless the mouth that would speak got hot I saw behind the Carlstedt none of us would be seen but may Christ be on display today and Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen amen and if we could just turn over to Genesis 30:1 I want to use that for context and and and our title for today is unwanted circumstances amen unwanted circumstances and if we all were to be honest we all have those things in our life things that happen that Amen we just don't want right a man and I know the Bible tells us to count it all joy but a man sometimes it's difficult when you have a circumstance that's just not comfortable right it you know it presents a challenge right it's not just going along with a man the flow but it feels like I'm swimming upstream right rather than just kind of going with the current and and all of us Amen at different times in our life we get these unwanted circumstances y'all just hold your finger on Genesis 30:1 I'm coming to that a man and a little bit we will use the story of Jacob as a background for this but unwanted circumstances a man let's look at this a quote out of the sermon Elijah and the mill offering Elijah and the meal offering a man glory to God is that right okay you know it says this in Germany they got they got a picture they call it the cloud picture it's a competitor this great picture of the crucifixion at Forest Lawn in Los Angeles the great picture it so it's as wide as this building is a cross they had to build a building around the picture many of you have seen it but this in Germany is called the cloud Dane I believe is called and when you when you get off from a piece and look at it oh it looks hideous looks like angry clouds are mixing around one another like that as the light reflects on it and look look like the clouds are moving as the way the pictures made to reflect the lights makes it look like the cloud and angry storm coming to tear up everything and then you're told by the guy won't close up a man and just keep watching it right because from a distance when you're looking at it it looks like it's just a bunch of angry clouds right but as as as the guy tells you walk closer and just just keep watching it it says when you get real close to it it isn't clouds it's angel's wings beating together rejoicing it's a blessing in disguise meant and I want to tell you this morning you have an unwonted circumstance in your life but that unwanted circumstance no matter what it is if it's financial trouble if it's advanced sickness in your body if it's something going on in your family it's a man it's an unwanted circumstance but it's also a blessing in disguise man it's all in the way that you look at it hallelujah glory to God see so he goes on the city says maybe your sickness tonight maybe your sacrifice to come out here was just a blessing in disguise meant the angels of God are here present to join their wings together and rejoice because it's written in the scripture that the angels of heaven rejoiced when one sinner repents thinking that but thus saith the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his grace cannot be exhausted and he's willing to give you anything your heart's desire amen so you know as I was looking at this you know we all have it you know different things that happen but I have I have noticed in my own just in my own life that you know when we have unwanted circumstances often times God is using that in order to birth something else hallelujah to the lamb of God and then God is used and it just to burst something else and and you know I was I was just kind of reflecting on a couple of things that happened one was this week you know one of the one of the one of the brothers had an unwanted circumstance he was on his way home and as he was on the way home his tire just just went flat on him just like that just going and and and I don't know what happened he had called me but I didn't get the message a man in the in time you know and then when I finally called him back he said I'm already home I'm already home passed I said well what happens he I called me at Obon and they came and got me off the side of the road now and I'm home I say well praise the Lord for that you know rather than sit out there and just kind of complain right he said I took I took matters in my own hands I got me uber and I'm already home I'm good and then you know then you know what what I realized is that on the next day within 24 hours the same brother that had a man a flat tire where the devil thought he would have discouraged him that he had one flat tire but on the next day he was blessed with four newer tires seat seat seat seat it was a it was it looked like that I wanted circumstance but it happened to be a blessing in disguise meant color everything that happens God is using that to bring glory to himself so stop giving the devil credit start giving the devil abraham any glory and honor God and shoes in that for his glory hallelujah so you gave me one flat tire but I got full newer tires that's where you got it you got it you got to talk back to that devil right I was reminded you know of something here you know that the sisters prayer meeting and the brothers prayer meetings that and then we had we had prayer that sweet lord knows we had some prayer this week we come out here and we were just you know we were just we you know we were next-door the brothers was there praying and you know we didn't we didn't know who all was just going to show up but you know I out of nowhere you know brother Kenny walked in and he came in with company and when he came in with company he had a son with them and he say he said my son-in-law called me and said he wanted to go to church and I told him about the prayer meeting but I can't tell them where the prayer meeting was besides just tell them we had prayer me and said I'd get back with you in a couple days to let you know you know about it so rather than brother Ken and get with him the son-in-law actually taxed him and said hey you said something by prayer meeting you said something like Church on on Tuesday night I want to go it showed that he wanted to be here so brother Ken they drove all the way down and picked him up had to drive 25 30 minutes to go get him went all the way down and got him and brought him to prayer and when he got into a certain street he turned on having someone say oh we go on the brother Jack search he said yeah that's where the prayer meeting at they say okay we praise the Lord he came in and when he got here that northa was just so powerful amen I mean everybody just coming in turn in and create an atmosphere say ah I don't know what God might do in a place like this and before you know I said do you want to pray say yeah I got something to be I got something to pray about I mean I need this he just broke out him to a prayer with everybody as I say my god what is God doing I wanted circumstances hallelujah and one of his son wants a circumstance that his job ended on that day but had he been working he would not have been able to make it to prayer it was an unwonted circumstance but it was a blessing in disguise Mitch lord I thank God for that you know the whole whole premises of the prayer amen the whole premises of the prayer was was birthed out of an unwarranted circumstance it was birthed out of unwanted circumstance and you know I mean we as some of us might not realize that but it was it was something that I wanted that happen in my house I don't want that but it happened but look at what I produce hallelujah say i'ma tell you something you don't have some unwanted circumstances in your own life but even in the midst of it just know it's a blessing in disguise meant God gonna use that for his glory so count it all joy all right let's go on let's go on so here you know I just wanted to make a couple statements here I wanted circumstances will always give birth to a blessing that's something I want you to remember I wanted circumstances will give birth to a blessing Wednesdays y'all gonna bring y'all pins and y'all paper and y'all gonna catch what the Lord saying y'all I wanted circumstances will give birth to a blessing that's why James can say counted all Joey all right stay with me stay with me Old Glory God uses unwelcome unwanted circumstances to draw us closer to him right it's an opportunity for an attribute of God to be expressed and then the relationship becomes more meaningful when when new attributes are expressed from God hallelujah you began to know him on a deeper level when those attributes expressed sickness amen produces the attribute of healing sin produces the attribute of redemption and mercy right and see what mercy is it's pitying and compassion towards the distressed I know I was distressed and I needed some pity I needed some compassion but my skin produced the attribute of redemption and mercy listen backsliding will produce the attribute of restoration come on somebody bondage will produce the attribute of deliverance a broken relationship will produce the attribute of reconciliation that produced the attribute of the mighty Conqueror and let me tell you something else when divine love is projected and comes to us in it produces the attribute of sovereign grace hallelujah and grace is what we call God's favor I don't know if any of y'all ever experienced that but grace when you say I'm walking underneath the grace of God you just told somebody I'm experiencing God's favor when there was chosen to produce the Christ child and then the angel said Mary you are highly favored hallelujah no matter what you're going through I don't care how big and how bad that trial is you are still highly favored in God's eyes and the trial did not come to break you but the trial came to actually build you up Oh glory to God count it all joy Church count it all joy let's look at this look at something here that's the sermon resurrection of Lazarus stay with me here today he says Lazarus took sick theologians believe he died with him urges of the lungs that I don't know the Bible don't say nothing some of the writers said it was alright he got sick and sometimes God tries your faith do you believe that every son that cometh to God must be tried think it not strange the fact that fiery trials come because it's not it's only done to perfect your faith draw you closer they're worth more than go to you your trials are worth more than go to you alright that of them when these things begin to take place Mary Martha sent and said have Jesus come back and pray for him and Jesus just ignore their call he went to another city far away well well then they sent again he still ignored their call sometime when you pray you feel the same way Mary and Martha that God just ignoring your prayers but in the midst of in the midst of you going through something like that you got to realize God is using that to actually strengthen you right he's not trying to come and defeat you but he's trying to strengthen you and see and often times when you're going through these are the times where we're we're spoken word this kind of comes out of your mouth you begin to say things by faith hallelujah you begin to speak things by faith and and the problem is is that when you when you release it out of your mouth that's the seat that's being planted and when you plant that seed don't dig it up with your doubt right just because it didn't happen overnight don't dig it up with your doubt you keep holding on to what you said out of your mouth and watch that thing come to pass no devil can stop it no devil can stop it especially when God spoke it however use somebody already got unwanted circumstances will produce a blessing in your life let me give you a couple of people that have some unwanted circumstances there was a father and mother that had a child come up and one at all his his inheritance before his parents died he wanted his inheritance and he wanted to leave and he was going to go out into the world and just become his own man not to those parents just wasn't unwarranted circumstance but when that boy got out there and a man and the Bible said that he was involved in riotous living he was doing things that his parents would not be pleased to know that he was doing it brought shame on the family name to know that that boy was out there doing stuff like that right but but but but what God did is letting the board get to a spot where all he could do is look up he got so low that all he can do is looked up he found himself living a man not not only not only living a pretty much paycheck-to-paycheck I was doing that but he got to a spot where you know the job was so low and in certain jobs I mean as a as a as a Jew as an Israelite he was not supposed to take that job but he got into a situation so low he had to take the top where he feeding pigs and as he give up that feeding pigs he looking at what the pigs eat and they say I'm sorry hoping that what they eat is better than what I'm eating he started eating the same thing the pigs were eating God let the man get so low it was an unwanted circumstance in his life but God was choosing that thing to become a blessing when he realized how low he was he said even the service in my daddy's house they live better the way I'm gonna let me get up from here go back to my daddy's house God will use unwanted circumstances to drive people back God will use those circumstances to drive them right back into expresses here comes this boy you know daddy and Mama praying for him and looking for me one day they see him walking up and mine when it comes back that I want to circumstance introduce the blessing and the boys like when they get back to dad and said daddy I'm not even worthy to be called your son I don't did this and I did that I don't embarrass you or embarrass the family just let me be a servant assigned to a house and an indenter said no no no no no no I don't care I don't care what you've done you can never be a servant because she was born a son and if you were born a son you gonna die a son a man that is your status that is your position you always be sudden his I want a circumstance produced a blessing they kill the fatted calf they gave him a ring of gold they put him on a rope and they reestablish it position as son and not servant this was reconciliation and restoration the unwarranted circumstance produced that in and reconciliation and restoration what about David he has some unwanted circumstances in his life he was disrespected by his father and disrespected by his brethren he got hired for a job that he did not apply for he was recommended for the job and you know sometimes you can some of you go through I want to circumstance on the job you know God gave you that job you know God gave to you I heard you give the testimony in touch about when God gave you that job and if God gave it to you years ago when to be taken away you just gone through unwanted circumstances it don't change the testimony God gave you it's your job and don't you let no devil drive you away from what God bless you live don't let the devil take it from your guy can I tell ya it's just an unwonted circumstance see what David got on this job he didn't he don't apply for this somebody recommended him and and they recommend him because of the anointing that was in his life so you got certain things inside of you that's why they want you in the place that they got you because of what you have inside of you but when you get there you can't expect that the devil ain't gonna try you it comes sitting with a trial here he hired to play for Saul but Saul got other plans and it's all done kill this man and while they got that javelin in his hand David just playing away just and probably knowing that service like that he just playing like I don't know what well just a Norton Oliver and chaplain saw so take that gentleman through it and why he playing he dodged and javis now you know modern-day Davis modern-day Davis would take the javelin out the wall who you throwing this at you create some unwanted circumstances but David David what he did after he saw that you know the jab and everything he I mean god blessed him with the job that they had but he had to go through but understand why he was going through god was perfecting his character David was called to be King David slept him you know in the king's house but but one night you know he had to tell his wife I better get out of here because your daddy comes rather he already done through javelins at me hit I did this not nineteen I concocted a plan to get why the man sleeping I want to go get him so they had the trick Solomon and make it look like David was in the bed sleeping he done jumped out a window went running somewhere it cause David a sleeping case David was the pre anointed king while he was sleeping in case should have been on the throne but he was in caves twenty something years in case sleeping in the fields there were that cut it got so bad as the pre anointed king one time he kidney or asleep among his people Ezra he had to go to the that the Phyllis time awed me and take residence unwanted circumstances but to understand one day when Saul died David actually became king of Israel and when it became king of Israel amen to say he was the greatest king outside of the Lord Jesus Christ he was the greatest king they have a rule in Israel but had David not gone through those unwarranted circumstances had he not go through those trials that he would have never learned how to be a great king see he understood he watched all in the weights all head of them set me say I'm not gonna be like that so maybe you can watch your boss maybe we can watch that co-worker amen and you can look at saying I don't want to be that type of co-worker and one day when God promote me I am NOT going to be that kind of boss but you have to go through some unwanted circumstances so your character can be developed stay with me here today Jesus was rejected of his own lied upon by false witnesses Jesus even prayed to God that the bitter cup would pass but but God still allowed him to go right through this unwarranted circumstance he was crucified under capital punishment a man he died probably the worst death that any man could die when he was nailed to a cross his hands and his feet but what the Bible tells us is that a in Hebrews 5:8 say though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so sometimes God is actually drawing you to a closer relationship in him by the things that you suffer hallelujah but but even after Jesus withdrew this Amen that the great thing that happened he was raised on the third day in power were to sit on the right hand of the Father he went through a lot but yeah he got exalted to a high place my god brother Branham say he was so hot I'd have to look down on earth he was exhausted so high he got to look down on earth but when he came to earth he was so low that he had to borrow they met a woman to be bearing it I mean I want to be birth then had to bear a bar a tomb to be bearing in but he was exhausted so high a man that he had to look down on the earth glory to God glory to God he learned obedience through the things he suffered can I go with one more here Joseph has some unwanted circumstances is that right Joseph has some unwanted circumstances that occurred in his life he was hated by his brother him because he was spiritual he was placed in a pinch a man then sold by his brother he became a servant or slave in Potiphar's court a man but Potiphar happened to be captain of Pharaoh's guards and we're gonna read something about this a little bit he was lied on while he was asleep he was thrown into prison but then he was raised into power can we read just a little bit about Joseph Amen and Genesis 39 stay with me here today sometimes we have some unwanted circumstances but God is still in control a man he's God a man in the good times and the bad times he's always gone let's look at something here in Genesis 39 just a couple scriptures a man will read verse 1 and 2 and then we'll skip to verse 20 through 23 james's 39 look at this says and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar and officer of Pharaoh captain the guard and Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites which had brought him down wither and verse two says the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian now let's also skip over here to verse 20 in the same chapter now in between verse 2 and verse 20 what happened is he's in part of his house Potiphar's wife lies on him and says that he came in and tried to do something that he never did and he ended up having to go to prison and then because of this live that this woman told on him now he found him eight men first as a slave he sold into slavery he's in part of his house and the Bible say the Lord was with him now we see him he's headed to prison and the Bible's going to tell us that the Lord is with him I don't know what you go through but I'm telling you right now the Lord is with you my client working brother Jack the Lord is with you they give me trouble on a job the Lord is still with you look at it verse 20 look at this and Joseph's master took him in and put him in prison a place where the Kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison but the Lord was with Joseph it doesn't seem right that God is with me and I'm going through all this stuff that I'm going through it don't it just don't make any sense but the Bible says but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison and the cube of the prison committed to Joseph and all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the the doer of it the keep of the prison look not to anything that was under his head because the Lord was with him and that which is that which he did the Lord made it to prosper oh I gotta tell you something you are a Sea you a seat a man your predestinated seat right and I need you to understand that when when people take you through all kind of nonsense and they try to bury you when they try to bury you remember your seat and if you bury a seed what its gonna do it's gonna grow so no matter what you go through you supposed to grow and get stronger you suppose a kid better not bitter but bad seeds go when their planet they grow and that's what you're going through a process of growth how could this be that the Lord was with them the man is soul a man as a slave in the Potiphar's house the man is in prison and it says the Lord is with them I want you all to think about this how can the Bible say that the Lord is with with Joseph in slavery and also in prison and I'm a jest i'ma just i'ma beat it to the beat you to the punch the reason God can say this cuz da can already see that in Oh God God can already see that in and in and here's here's another good thing is that if God can see the end then all things are working together for good and your purpose for being in part of a house is because it's intentional your purpose for being at whatever job you wear is because it's intentional your purpose are going to prison is because it's intentional not know exactly what he's doing come on somebody it's an unwonted circumstance but God is behind it's my blessing in disguise why why would the Bible say that he got sold to Potiphar officer in pharaoh's court why now you know all the people down there buying slaves think about all the people that's buying slaves but God had it where he allowed social to be sold to Potiphar now officer in Pharaoh's court and I hate it no no no no no I'm a block you from barn Joseph and I'm a block you from Brian Joseph and I'm a block you know I know you might be raising the price up they might be having an option here and it's guy said I just I just got the hat no no no you can't have him I'm gonna have him in Potiphar's house I want him to go to part of his house oh come on somebody y'all work with me and there's a reason that he's at Papa's house at an officer of the court because when things when an unwanted circumstance occurs in Potiphar's house then it's gonna allow him to actually go to Pharaoh's prison because you understand there are other prisons to go to God is saying that no I don't want yeah you go go to prison because in prison I'm gonna sheep you I'm go mo Chiu I'm gonna make you into the man that I need you to be but I don't want you to get that experience in somebody else's prison you got to go to pharaoh's prison do you understand what god is doing now is so much brighter down [Applause] because this is yeah that's what Ababa can say the Lord was with Joseph you've gotta get had this thing already orchestrated usually when you when you read the stories to me we don't read it too many times but you know I'm gonna Bible reading plan I just they just give you one chapter at a time you can't read ahead in the story you gotta act like you don't know what's going on but when you're not a story and you just read parts of you just English chicken hissing oh my goodness I mean look at what they ain't gon be for Charles talk it was a bunch of unwanted circumstances oh my god I mean III remember his dream and he saw his brothers and coming to bow before but you know when Joseph actually got to a man becomes second in charge and he was he was kind of tricking them boys and and making them think that he didn't own a language Brian just was standing there and and before you knew it the boys the boys ran I mean without him even asked him they ran after Joseph his bow down and he said now we just come to offer gifts we come to do too his dream was for fear and nominees television sometimes you don't know what you're going through it you stepping right into the vision you're walking right into a prison oh my god I remember brother Wesker used to share the story the man that man he was outside his house it just burned down burned down firemen they're coming and they putting him he's all this stuff that he of them had for years it's gone and rather the man sitting out there with a sad face he kind of step on the sidewalk everybody they say well what is it he said why can't you praise God at a time like this he said I'm praising God for my new house you know the devil tried to take sister brownout few weeks ago and accident after church she was that communion service and after she left chameleon the devil tried to take that Jess Jess Jess Jess mama her own business somebody just did something in traffic that they wanted supposed to do unwanted circumstance low cerca they they

budget say it's hard I'm not looking at the price this is what I got for in my budget so he they worked everything out and when it when they when they finally got things worked out he said now I got a trade in that I want to give you I hope I'm stealing all this Thunder but sometimes you need to hear things like this because this is a season if you're going through in with your car get ready for your blessing and I'm trying to anoint your faith you got it I don't want to circumstance but it's a blessing in disguise men from Stevens a winning jump the car and got it there and they had the total copter right across the street I don't know if the salesman saw the college taxes just let off the tow truck crossed the street he say he knew he could crank it just enough to pull it in there say here go the car but I want a trainee [Applause] well I'm talking about my Jesus I'm telling I'm trying to tell you how to turn your unwanted circumstance into a blessing here here brother seems they pulled along say that got a car there so he'd know that they don't got one don't one got one gonna go very fast let's say that we want so much down and say you said we're gonna give you $200 for your car you say all the money gotta pay for this car got to get more than 200 I just can eat more they say well they said well it really served you know this and I say I know all them problems but I need more than effort for my car so to say how can you come up with this much cash now he say nope but I got a car and nobody they didn't take him seriously but he said that because he couldn't take that car back out so he set them just waiting just just waited see you and I'm gonna tell you something when you're going through trials you need a song one of them song says I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting on the Lord I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting on the Lord he just just sitting there just waiting and they they saw he wasn't going nowhere he's a big guy he ain't moving so the guy that's gonna run out of finance numbers it coming soon man I've been paging you and trying to get you to my office nobody came to get you said man you ain't been paging me that's okay I'm just waiting on the Lord anyway cuz just come on in the office and say you know we know that you paid that money for that car and you know we're gonna give you 200 but I tell you what we're gonna do now we want to get you in this car we're gonna give you 1,500 for your car and then that would that get you an say yep that'll do it [Applause] and drove off the lot with his MKZ now don't get me wrong I ain't telling everybody to go get a MKZ all right tell everybody to do that amen there was a method to all that madness but I'm just trying to show you that there is there's a blessing in disguise meant when you're going through God is moving in the atmosphere mean in this in the season blessing we coughs when y'all see sister Brown coming we're cut out that was another blessing y'all saw star last year was such a tiny got hookup there's a seeds in cars and I don't mean everybody go get a car I say that line I ain't say that don't go right there and put yourself in some debt that you don't need all right say that I sister sister Michelle testified about a new car you know why she a new car cuz the devil get hook up you know it's just a bag in the car because the devil hit her car you want to know why brother Steven got a new car cuz his car put him down yours are still running so we tryna we gonna kill covetousness too [Applause] so don't look at what God yeah that's what I'm reading a blessed night all right but when you're going through a trial and some of y'all going through some serious trials look for your blessing a man don't give the devil no credit at all he's a liar and everything he speak is a lie all right where am I I wanted to tell you all about Joseph Joseph had unwanted circumstances that put him in and-and-and-and in slavery and then put them in the Pharaohs prison and those all that was designed by God the reason that Baba could say the Lord was with Joseph it's because God knew he had to put Joseph in a certain place and order for him to build relationships with certain people had he been in any other prison he would have never met the butler he would have never met the Baker he would have never met these people and and the reason I say he built relationships because when you go back and read the scripture you'll see that Joseph's Kingdom saying ah man why y'all so sad today how can he recognize their attitudes huh because he knew man we always joke and we always giggle you're always doing this ribbet but why y'all so sad today both of y'all sand right I mean he has a relationship with these men that said naw I got y'all some be this way I mean and notice this even though Joseph is in prison he's still choking even though Joseph has gone through he still got a good attitude he don't like his condition so when he tells the man their dreams they give them an interpretation of the dreams one is real good one it's really bad but it still give the interpretation even saying that when you when it when it when it when it when he bring you back into your position don't forget about me that mean he don't like his unwanted circumstance none of us like I don't want a circumstance I say don't forget if I'm just just touch make sure you let him know that I'm down here I'm down here unjustly but I'm tell you if you wait on God now see had he been released at that time oh come on he had that God had to make it look like he was forgotten I hope y'all whip me this morning God had to make Joseph think that he was forgotten because God had a better position I don't want you to just be free from prison I got something up my sleeve here and if you just let me work this thing out you might become boss you might get promotion to boss second in charge if you let me work this thing guys Joseph Joseph sit there and he say he said man they they forgot about me they forgot about me two years later two whole years later here he is and and he don't he don't even forgot about everything too but here come on order rushing into the prison rushing in hey you need to clean yourself up you got to go before February for what what what's going on what's out doings are you going before Pharaoh right now say okay all right God then showed him no dream God didn't give no vision and he just maybe just took its first shape in years and he come running up to Pharaohs and I just yeah yeah I know I preached this recently but it's just in my spirit all over but he he he come running up to Pharaoh and like well what is it what is it well you know I had this dream and I was asking all these people around me and nobody I was able to interpret the dream and in the butler the butler your friend the butler yeah I thought he forgot about me yeah but your friend said that he remembered you was in prison and and we sent the gift to say because they say you know you interpreted his dream and the bay dream and it was it was spot-on so if you could do that for them can't you do the same for me but in the midst of these thing now I'm gonna give glory to God it's not me interpreting dreams but it's God in me that does these things y'all need to stop right there you think you don't got somewhere because of you it ain't you is God in you sometimes you got to stop and give God the praise I didn't either and watch I didn't watch the whatever this football game was the national championship but I was told that the second-string quarterback from Alabama I mean got into the game and brought the team back and they won the game and at the end of the game I heard the boy was on national television and he said my mama told me not to do this and my daddy told me not to do this but I want to give God some glory praise the Lord for young man gonna do something like own national television you can't cut that it's running live but sometimes we need to stop and just acknowledge God God is the one did this here here here Joe Joe cigar got you know if it's you got to give it to me if it's a God say okay you start sharing that dream and they shared the share something else is okay both of these dreams are the same thing and Joseph forgetting interpreting and at the end of his interpreting you say now what you need to do is get yourself a wise man that will help prepare Egypt in this time of Plenty because the time of famine is coming but you need a wise man to kind of oversee some things and make sure that they can prepare for the famine so he's turned around on his way back to prison [Applause] and I could just see Pharaoh say uh fellas fellas fellas y'all couldn't get the interpretation but this man just came in and in just a few minutes time told us exactly what was gonna happen is there a wiser man in the kingdom then he if there is for y'all shown to me because I'm not gonna let this man go back to prison when I know he can be a help to me it's just a nobody while to stop where you add Joseph stop stop stop you the man and see had he had had had he come out two years earlier he would have been ahead of the dreams he would have been ahead of some stuff had he come out two years earlier so God had to make it look like he was forgotten it was an unwarranted shock out - but it was a blessing in disguise me no no no no no no no this is the man Pharisee and in my kingdom and this is what I like he he wouldn't just no I mean he went he went from being prison I mean slave prisoner vice-president slave well actually we can go back even further than that hate it put in a pit sold into slavery by brothers and so you got a yo-yo I'm stuck in this story I got so much more to say but I I'm stuck in here but but but but but but when you got to when you read the script you got to be able to read between the lines because when he finally gets back to his brothers when they found when he realized that they don't change Judah Judah none change you do the same one that came with the plan to sell him now I said no no no I we can't leave Benjamin here because if Benjamin don't go back my daddy gonna die and and and I can't I'm sorry I I have to be the one to take his place when Joseph see that and Sababa distill out shop and and before they before they tell him that they say they said you know our system caught up with us and you know and when we saw our brothers face see I mean and see when they they don't take that in the previous chapters but but when they saw them they can just see his face and the anguish like I can't believe y'all would do me this way my own blood I could y'all do this to me oh my god but then when I saw his face you know that that looks stayed with them it stayed with them and and and now now it's coming back before them and here they standing before Joseph don't even realize it but see the unwanted circumstance of a famine a dream that God show up Pharaoh that was gonna happen that unwanted circumstance of a family salmon brought a family back together again and I wanted circumstance reunited an entire family Joseph Joe Joe Joe Straus was there and he promoted and he's doing all the stuff they need to do to prepare the people for the famine but the famine just didn't affect Egypt but all the surrounding areas and Here Come his family you know numbers anything that y'all y'all y'all y'all spies all y'all spies oh you know and imma prove yo imma prove yo said T you know he said he put him in prison for a few days and didn't say I tell you what i'ma leave one of y'all here and y'all go back and get y'all younger brother when you bring him back then y'all can y'all can see my face say uh they went home told daddy daddy this meeting and let us see him until we bring Benjamin back and they say Mariana got Joseph now y'all and left the other boy why y'all even told him who

from him told his wife please everybody just get away broke out in tears can you imagine the scene this unwanted circumstance what it produced at this time and they just sitting there like he speak our language he then see that's it yeah and then he just had to reveal himself I don't know I mean he might have had on a nice one of Egyptian wigs or something maybe the Egyptian garments he didn't look like an Israelite but here here here by the time he'd take it all off and say brother oh my god see when your heart has been changed when you don't going through some unwanted circumstances in
