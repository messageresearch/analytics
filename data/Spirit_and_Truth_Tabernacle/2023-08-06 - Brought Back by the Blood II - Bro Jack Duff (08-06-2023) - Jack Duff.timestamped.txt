[39:29] not only a faithful deak and a faithful
[39:32] Minister a faithful song leader
[39:34] it's a faithful brother and friend
[39:36] amen I just want to give a little
[39:38] testimony about the trip over to uh
[39:41] over to Dubai
[39:44] it's a beautiful place
[39:45] [Music]
[39:47] but it's a heat that's hellish
[39:51] that's the closest I want to get to Hell
[39:54] feeling the heat like that you will pay
[39:56] a price and I'm feeling that in my body
[39:58] right now you know we were out on the
[40:00] desert I guess it was like 118 during
[40:02] the day in 99 at night
[40:04] you know you're doing all that sweating
[40:07] got back in the car and uh the uh God he
[40:10] had the air right on me I just got sick
[40:12] and been fighting that devil since
[40:14] but
[40:15] we had a nice trip over to Dubai when we
[40:18] got got ready to go through immigration
[40:22] they stopped shalom
[40:24] on her passport they put a m for male
[40:28] instead of female on there and over in
[40:30] an Arab country they don't play that
[40:34] you come over there with that
[40:35] foolishness you spending 18 years in
[40:37] jail
[40:38] they'll stop you at the gate
[40:41] so they were sending Shalom back
[40:44] to what they call desk one so Naomi went
[40:47] back with Shalom to that's one actually
[40:48] we all went back to desk one
[40:52] and as we got back there we were sitting
[40:55] and waiting and then I told Naomi I'm
[40:58] gonna go ahead and get the luggage she
[40:59] told me to take Josiah and her that's
[41:01] what that's with me so we went out side
[41:04] of immigration once you go outside of
[41:06] immigration you cannot come back in
[41:09] so we went on the other side of
[41:11] immigration and uh first thing I know to
[41:14] do is pray so I began to speak to the
[41:17] Lord about these situations you know
[41:19] right in the airport Arab country but I
[41:21] bow my head and I pray
[41:23] then I text Brother Jack because I know
[41:26] once I talk to my Lord he's given me a
[41:28] Shepherd so I'm going to contact Brother
[41:30] Jack and let brother Jack know what's
[41:33] going on over here
[41:34] and I don't remember if it was me or
[41:36] brother Jack put it in the group with
[41:38] the brothers now I know when the
[41:40] brothers begin to pray
[41:41] things begin to change
[41:43] we go to war every other Tuesday night
[41:46] and we know that the sisters go to war
[41:47] every other Tuesday night so I know
[41:49] things begin to happen
[41:51] so I was sitting on a luggage and I sat
[41:54] there and I said my wife and daughter
[41:55] would come through those Gates
[41:57] so I sat there about 30 minutes just
[41:59] watching the gates with expectation
[42:01] waiting on my my wife and my daughter to
[42:04] come through the gates
[42:06] but he is an on-time God he may not come
[42:08] when you want him but he'll be on time
[42:12] so I stood up and I went to the gate
[42:14] Naomi uh she called me and she said look
[42:17] they getting ready to send me and Shalom
[42:19] back
[42:20] so they took us back to departure and
[42:22] they're getting ready to send us back I
[42:24] said how what are you going to do when
[42:25] you get back I have the keys with me
[42:27] you'll be stuck at the airport
[42:29] so I went to uh the man at the uh where
[42:33] they they scanned you coming out I said
[42:34] look they're getting ready to send my
[42:35] wife and my daughter back because of a
[42:37] mistake on the on the passport
[42:40] and um I need to get her the keys
[42:43] so he called somebody and two gentlemen
[42:45] came out they told my children to stay
[42:47] and they took me to the back when they
[42:50] took me to the back they said what is
[42:52] actually going on so I expressed to them
[42:54] what was going on and Naomi sent me a
[42:57] text she said look I just tried to get a
[42:59] hold of a consulate in Miami they sent
[43:01] me over to the Embassy I spoke to
[43:02] somebody in the embassy they said that
[43:04] they cannot do the paperwork that we
[43:06] need until Monday morning but they're
[43:08] going to send us back
[43:10] so I expressed this to the gentleman
[43:12] they said who did she talk to
[43:15] I said uh she talked to somebody at the
[43:17] embassy he said hold on
[43:19] the other gentleman he pulled me aside
[43:21] he said stand next to me
[43:22] so I stood next to him while the other
[43:25] guy got on the phone he started talking
[43:26] to whoever was on the phone he started
[43:28] pacing up and down for about 10 minutes
[43:31] the guy
[43:33] part of me he came and stood next to me
[43:35] and the other guy got on the phone he
[43:37] said stand right here next to him so he
[43:40] went on he started talking
[43:42] he came back he said things are in place
[43:45] we're waiting on the embassy to make
[43:46] their move so you stand right here I
[43:49] said My Two children are still on the
[43:51] other side and my wife and my daughter
[43:53] they're down here in departure he said
[43:55] just stand here we'll get your children
[43:57] so they went and got Josiah and Hadassah
[44:00] and brought to them to where I was
[44:03] and after that it was just a waiting
[44:05] game
[44:06] so as we waited after about almost an
[44:10] hour
[44:11] we see Naomi and Shalom coming
[44:13] then it's Naomi Shalom would come and
[44:16] then the other two gentlemen they came
[44:17] back from some big meeting over there
[44:19] and when they came back from the meeting
[44:21] they said come up to the front
[44:24] so they called me up to the front I had
[44:26] to become a guarantee for Shalom and
[44:30] then they sent me around paid this
[44:31] little fee come back they stamped my
[44:34] passport took my passport gave me a
[44:36] printout of my passport stamped it and
[44:38] stabbed shalom's a letter and they said
[44:41] wherever you go you use this for your
[44:44] passport but we need you to come back
[44:46] Monday to pick up your passport
[44:50] so we did everything else we actually
[44:53] got back to the hotel about three in the
[44:55] morning then the wedding was supposed to
[44:57] start at 10 started a little late
[45:00] [Music]
[45:02] five hours
[45:03] five hours we we had a church service
[45:06] first then we had a wedding
[45:09] so the next morning I sort of overslept
[45:13] so we went later that evening the guy
[45:16] told me you have to come back in the
[45:18] morning you can't come here at this time
[45:21] so brother Jack had given me some
[45:23] instructions take somebody with you that
[45:26] can make calls for you and take a
[45:28] brother from from the church well I
[45:30] didn't find a brother from the church to
[45:33] go with me so me and my wife we actually
[45:35] we went back up to immigration
[45:39] when we get to immigration
[45:41] we sat there for a while and then they
[45:43] told me
[45:44] your wife must stay here you have to
[45:47] come to the bank
[45:49] so they gave me instructions on where to
[45:51] go so I went back to the back
[45:53] and here I am in the office with the
[45:56] head people of immigration
[45:58] so as I'm talking to the people in
[46:00] Immigration I said I'm here to pick up
[46:01] my passports this was the instruction
[46:03] that was giving me said sir you cannot
[46:06] pick up your passport you have to make
[46:08] um
[46:09] you have to make an uh an appointment
[46:12] with the consulate here
[46:15] so he said you make the call from right
[46:17] here so I kept trying to call trying to
[46:20] call I couldn't get through he said you
[46:22] go to the website make an appointment
[46:23] because you can go no further until you
[46:25] make an appointment so I went online and
[46:29] I kept trying to put it
[46:30] and he said he asked me when we were
[46:33] leaving I said Thursday morning
[46:34] they don't have an appointment I won't
[46:36] have an appointment with them until
[46:37] Monday morning
[46:40] he said stand right here
[46:42] he walked out he went down the hall he
[46:44] came back and he had he got the top man
[46:47] in immigration
[46:49] and he began to speak with the top man
[46:51] and the man asked me what was the
[46:52] situation and I told him when we were in
[46:55] the United States we found out that
[46:57] there was a mistake on my daughter's
[46:59] passport so we went to get a new
[47:04] passport for her and they said even if
[47:06] we even if we expedited this passport
[47:08] she would not get it back in time but
[47:10] what you need to do is take her birth
[47:11] certificate so we did what we were told
[47:14] I said she was born a girl she's a girl
[47:16] now
[47:17] I said um
[47:20] I brought up her birth certificate they
[47:22] said it don't matter what the birth
[47:23] certificate says it's what the passport
[47:25] says
[47:26] but the the gentleman that was over
[47:28] everything
[47:29] he said let him through
[47:30] [Music]
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:40] and when he said let him through there
[47:42] it was a big weight that
[47:44] that came off my shoulder you know I had
[47:46] been meditating on on a quote that
[47:49] brother Brandon was talking to the
[47:51] people he said you know sometimes God
[47:53] just want to prove to his children he
[47:55] has muscles
[48:01] he said every man every father feels
[48:04] that way sometimes they'll go around the
[48:05] children they just Flex a little bit he
[48:07] said I like to do that with my girls
[48:09] flexing they say daddy you have such big
[48:10] muscles he said God loves to do that
[48:13] sometimes he allows situation to rise
[48:16] just to flex his muscles and show who he
[48:18] really is
[48:19] so when I was standing there and I made
[48:21] my declaration my wife and my daughter
[48:23] will be coming through here it was right
[48:25] after I said I'm a Son of God I don't
[48:26] care where I am I'm a Son of God and if
[48:30] I'm a Son of God I'm not going to get
[48:32] frustrated with what's going on
[48:34] I'm just going to speak and wait for it
[48:36] to come to pass my wife and my daughter
[48:38] came walking through them doors it may
[48:40] have been around three three o'clock in
[48:42] the morning but they came walking

[1:02:51] Journey continues with brought back by
[1:02:56] the blood
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:59] the Bible says but now in Christ Jesus
[1:03:01] ye who sometimes were far off mate are
[1:03:06] mate 9 by the blood of Christ for he is
[1:03:11] our peace who have made both one and
[1:03:14] hath broken down the middle wall a
[1:03:17] petition between us having abolished in
[1:03:20] his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:03:24] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:03:26] to make in himself of Twain one new man
[1:03:30] so making peace and that he might
[1:03:33] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[1:03:37] the cross having slain an enmity thereby
[1:03:40] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:03:43] father we thank you for all that you
[1:03:44] have done in this service thus far and
[1:03:47] as we have gathered in this place uh
[1:03:50] Lords because we want to all closer to
[1:03:52] you we pray that you would take control
[1:03:54] of the word now not only has this been
[1:03:57] preached but also as it is being
[1:03:59] received father we pray the Holy Ghost
[1:04:01] would help us to see what it is that you
[1:04:04] want us to see in your word today and
[1:04:06] got me you get all the glory all the
[1:04:08] honor and all uh the praise we take
[1:04:10] every spirit that is against the spirit
[1:04:13] of God underneath the control of the
[1:04:15] Holy Ghost even right now it's in Jesus
[1:04:18] name we pray amen and amen God bless you
[1:04:23] you can be seated
[1:04:31] praise the Lord amen we started a little
[1:04:35] journey a couple weeks ago on this
[1:04:38] sermon brought back by the blood amen
[1:04:43] and uh I kind of left you uh in limbo on
[1:04:48] on a statement and hopefully today we'll
[1:04:50] get there to be able to kind of help
[1:04:52] clear it up but
[1:04:54] um
[1:04:55] we could never
[1:04:58] uh talk enough about what the blood of
[1:05:01] Jesus has done for us
[1:05:04] amen uh if we ever got a true
[1:05:07] understanding of the power of the blood
[1:05:12] amen and and
[1:05:14] um I I know for myself uh God had to
[1:05:17] give me a revelation of it just through
[1:05:20] a little vision and uh and what happened
[1:05:22] to me I was in prayer one time and I
[1:05:25] sincerely just wanted to get on my knees
[1:05:27] and just pray and seek the Lord I had
[1:05:29] that desire and as I'm praying it just
[1:05:31] seems like uh Satan just stopped
[1:05:33] bombarding my mind with everything that
[1:05:36] I did wrong uh every every wicked and
[1:05:39] evil thing I did Satan would just bring
[1:05:41] it back you did this you did that you
[1:05:43] did this you think God gonna hear your
[1:05:45] prayer after you did that I'm like my
[1:05:47] goodness he just had me in a spot where
[1:05:49] I felt like ain't no sense in me praying
[1:05:52] and uh you know and when I got to that
[1:05:54] spot God just kind of opened up my uh my
[1:05:58] mind a little bit he just gave me a
[1:05:59] little vision I got a glimpse of the
[1:06:01] blood and when I just saw the blood I
[1:06:03] realized there was nothing
[1:06:05] against me
[1:06:08] because I have been washed in the blood
[1:06:12] right and and when I when I realized
[1:06:15] that my I got a breakthrough in my
[1:06:17] prayer and uh and the devil was finished
[1:06:19] at that moment and I'm gonna tell you
[1:06:22] not only in that prayer but every prayer
[1:06:24] after that
[1:06:26] the devil was done in my life there was
[1:06:29] nothing oh come on somebody the Bible
[1:06:31] said there is there is therefore now no
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:37] there is therefore now
[1:06:40] no condemnation
[1:06:43] right so when I when I really and only
[1:06:46] the blood could put me in a position
[1:06:49] where there is no condemnation
[1:06:54] together
[1:06:55] brother you talk about the devil finish
[1:06:58] and when you get a true Revelation what
[1:07:00] the blood of Christ has done for you I
[1:07:03] don't care what your past is the blood
[1:07:06] makes you a new creature
[1:07:09] the blood makes you a new creation
[1:07:13] come on somebody the blood wipes away
[1:07:16] your past
[1:07:18] we read a quote on on the last time
[1:07:21] brother random say it's like it's like
[1:07:23] Clorox and having a man just a little
[1:07:26] drop of ink
[1:07:27] and they say you take that drop of ink
[1:07:30] and then you just drop it in the Clorox
[1:07:32] it says it was the ink I mean you get
[1:07:35] ink on your shirt you in trouble you get
[1:07:38] ink on your dress you in trouble that
[1:07:40] ink stain will stay there but if you put
[1:07:42] ink and Clorox
[1:07:45] he said that the ink disintegrates in
[1:07:48] the chloride he say that ink actually
[1:07:50] becomes the Clorox the Clorox is just
[1:07:53] that strong that it changes the
[1:07:56] chemistry of the ink
[1:07:58] come on somebody and he said that's the
[1:08:00] same way it is with the blood of the
[1:08:03] Lord Jesus it changes the chemistry of
[1:08:05] things
[1:08:06] it changes the way we think about things
[1:08:09] it changes the way we approach things
[1:08:12] the blood changes everything
[1:08:19] so I was reading this quote out of
[1:08:22] condemnation by representation because
[1:08:24] this is where my thought actually came
[1:08:27] from a man and you know this is a to me
[1:08:29] a very powerful sermon uh that brother
[1:08:32] Brandon preaches there's a lot of things
[1:08:33] in there that he says uh but but but uh
[1:08:37] he's just bringing out a lot you know
[1:08:39] there and uh and when he made this
[1:08:41] statement about the blood inside the
[1:08:43] sermon it just really blessed my heart
[1:08:44] condemnation by representation he says
[1:08:46] this Jesus died that he might breathe
[1:08:50] back
[1:08:52] oh my I love that that he might breathe
[1:08:55] back oh Hallelujah only the blood can do
[1:08:58] that
[1:09:00] he says only through the chemistry of
[1:09:02] the blood of Jesus Christ can breed back
[1:09:06] again a person that won't vary one word
[1:09:09] from what God Said
[1:09:11] now now this is important Jesus died so
[1:09:13] he might breathe back bring us back to
[1:09:16] this spot we won't vary from not one
[1:09:18] word that God says he says uh Eve showed
[1:09:21] her weakness amen the church showed what
[1:09:24] what she did she said well maybe you're
[1:09:27] right maybe God won't hold me
[1:09:29] responsible because uh we'll say what
[1:09:31] difference does it make as long as I'm
[1:09:32] baptized what difference does it make as
[1:09:34] long as says oh that shows you need
[1:09:36] another breathing when you're
[1:09:37] compromising with the word you need
[1:09:39] another breeding he says that shows that
[1:09:42] something's got to come back to you to
[1:09:44] bring you to a faith that what God Said
[1:09:46] not one jot or one Tittle shall pass
[1:09:49] from God's word till all is fulfilled
[1:09:51] let every man's word be a lie and his be
[1:09:54] true Christ came that he might breathe
[1:09:56] back by the Holy Spirit it says oh
[1:10:00] brother as we sit together now in
[1:10:01] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy
[1:10:04] Spirit breathing upon us like we are now
[1:10:06] breathing back I just love these words
[1:10:10] breeding back taking away the rubbish of
[1:10:13] theology
[1:10:15] amen and that that's so important to me
[1:10:17] the blood the blood is what brought you
[1:10:20] out of denomination
[1:10:22] can I say this The Blood also keeps you
[1:10:25] out of denomination
[1:10:28] the blood brought you out of the world
[1:10:30] Amen the blood keeps you from the things
[1:10:33] of the world
[1:10:36] a man breathing back taking away the
[1:10:38] rubbish of theology taking away the
[1:10:41] rubbish Of The World man-made doctrines
[1:10:44] having forms of godliness deny the power
[1:10:47] that thereof breed it back into an
[1:10:49] unadulterated faith in God Amen he says
[1:10:53] uh Jesus that same say oh I know it is
[1:10:56] written but you know it said thou shall
[1:10:58] eat Jesus said and it's also written
[1:11:00] it's also yes it's written in that that
[1:11:02] he'll do this and you shall term these
[1:11:05] it says if you are the Son of God you
[1:11:06] can perform a miracle here before me and
[1:11:09] turn these songs into bread let me see
[1:11:10] you do it he'd be minding Satan see the
[1:11:15] shrewdness of God there it's written man
[1:11:17] should not live by bread alone see him
[1:11:19] right with the word he he defeated Satan
[1:11:21] every time right on the word he stayed
[1:11:25] with the word and if he came to breed us
[1:11:28] back to Sons and Daughters of God like
[1:11:30] he was at the beginning how can we get
[1:11:32] away from the word then
[1:11:36] how can we ever get anywhere till we get
[1:11:38] back to the word the Holy Ghost came to
[1:11:41] breed us back now you know I went
[1:11:43] through some things there when you talk
[1:11:45] about breeding uh they have this thing
[1:11:47] they call it uh selective breeding and
[1:11:50] this is where they bring certain animals
[1:11:52] together try to make stronger and better
[1:11:54] faster bigger better animals when they
[1:11:56] do selective breeding come on somebody
[1:11:57] and you know and and they're on to
[1:12:00] something there right because when
[1:12:01] brother Branham uses the term breeding
[1:12:03] back it's the word that came amen and
[1:12:06] connected with us and through the
[1:12:09] connection word God is breathing back
[1:12:11] Sons and Daughters of God and he said
[1:12:14] only the blood can bring us back to that
[1:12:17] position the very thing that Adam lost
[1:12:20] in the beginning the blood takes us back
[1:12:22] to it
[1:12:24] you know before seeing it was perfect
[1:12:26] Fellowship in the garden
[1:12:28] no headaches
[1:12:30] no no no no no no hospital visits amen
[1:12:34] didn't have to worry about anything it
[1:12:36] was just a perfect condition that that
[1:12:38] Adam and Eve walked in before sin came
[1:12:40] into the god the blood takes us back
[1:12:43] into that condition
[1:12:46] hallelujah hallelujah that's why we
[1:12:48] ought to thank God for this for the for
[1:12:50] the blood you can have peace right now
[1:12:52] in the midst of whatever you're going
[1:12:53] through he is your peace
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] amen this this this this this this
[1:13:00] uh when we talk about the blood I just
[1:13:03] want to make the statement since the
[1:13:05] beginning of time
[1:13:06] God has required blood to satisfy the
[1:13:10] dead of sin
[1:13:12] now you know
[1:13:14] um as I was thinking on this you know
[1:13:16] just a little bit more you know they was
[1:13:18] telling me well I read a little
[1:13:20] something about you know uh uh sharks
[1:13:23] when they when they smell blood
[1:13:25] that that shark if he smells blood then
[1:13:28] he he's on the attack right he's looking
[1:13:30] for something to attack when he smells
[1:13:32] blood but but it just kind of it just um
[1:13:35] a thought kind of crossed my say hi to
[1:13:37] shark's mind because of sin because of
[1:13:41] the fall of Man how the shark operates
[1:13:43] like that but God when he sees blood
[1:13:48] it actually stops him from attacking
[1:13:52] come on somebody it it's a total
[1:13:54] different thing in the mind of God it
[1:13:57] stops a man God from acts it stops to
[1:14:00] destroy an angel from coming into the
[1:14:02] land when God sees blood
[1:14:06] oh Hallelujah it stops uh uh I mean even
[1:14:10] brother Brandon when he had the
[1:14:11] experience of of seeing the the blood of
[1:14:14] Christ as a bumper for his sins he say
[1:14:16] those black spots that were leaving the
[1:14:18] Earth amen says if they were to come
[1:14:20] into the presence of God he would have
[1:14:22] been done for just one spot make it into
[1:14:25] the presence of God he would have been
[1:14:27] done for but because the blood was there
[1:14:29] as a cover the blood was there as a
[1:14:33] bumper
[1:14:34] it was his protection
[1:14:36] not only his protection but it's our
[1:14:38] protection
[1:14:41] since the beginning of time God has
[1:14:43] required blood
[1:14:45] to satisfy the dead of sin
[1:14:47] amen and and I want to you know just
[1:14:51] kind of take us back on this journey
[1:14:52] through the Garden of Eden because we
[1:14:54] realize that Adam and Eve fail Adam fell
[1:14:57] willfully so what happened there in the
[1:14:59] Garden of Eden he did this willfully Eve
[1:15:01] was tricked she was deceived by amen the
[1:15:04] serpent who was anointed by the devil
[1:15:06] glory to God they committed this
[1:15:09] adulterous act there in the Garden of
[1:15:11] Eden amen that was the problem it was
[1:15:13] adultery in the Garden of Eden amen and
[1:15:16] when that adulterous act took place
[1:15:18] glory to God Adam and Eve recognized
[1:15:21] that they were out of fellowship with
[1:15:22] God and when it was time for church that
[1:15:25] night God would come down every evening
[1:15:27] Amen in the cooler the evening he would
[1:15:29] have fellowship and a church service be
[1:15:30] set up and my what a wonderful service
[1:15:33] they would have but this one day God
[1:15:35] shows up for church and his congregation
[1:15:37] is not there
[1:15:41] something happened to his congregation
[1:15:43] now they ought to know that God knows
[1:15:45] exactly where they are let me tell you
[1:15:47] something you can't hide from God
[1:15:49] and you can't run from God God got a way
[1:15:52] of tracking you down he left certain
[1:15:55] situations occur amen and then he brings
[1:15:57] you back into his presence
[1:15:59] amen it's the love of God Amen so so
[1:16:03] here Adam and Eve they're they're
[1:16:05] running amen from God and in the Garden
[1:16:07] of Eden and God just began to ask a
[1:16:09] question Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[1:16:12] now he he didn't have to ask that
[1:16:14] question like God didn't know where they
[1:16:15] was but he needed Adam to kind of own up
[1:16:18] to his mistake
[1:16:19] own up to what you've done and even when
[1:16:22] he began to ask Adam question he never
[1:16:23] really owned up to it the one the woman
[1:16:25] you gave me did this
[1:16:28] he put the blame on God the woman you
[1:16:31] gave me caused me to do no no no no no
[1:16:33] she she was she was uh I mean she was so
[1:16:36] beautiful to you Adam right you called a
[1:16:39] woman you you even gave a name and
[1:16:41] everything she was so beautiful to you
[1:16:43] Adam you knew you said now you're gonna
[1:16:45] blame it on God for giving you this
[1:16:47] woman no no no no no well e what you
[1:16:48] what what happened in the god well the
[1:16:50] serpent that you come on now this y'all
[1:16:53] can't keep passing the buck like this
[1:16:54] own up to what you've done
[1:16:59] and when they came to church they came
[1:17:01] dressed a little different
[1:17:05] they they had a fig Leaf tied around
[1:17:08] them and God God said now where where uh
[1:17:11] where you get this understanding from
[1:17:13] why are you dressed like that coming to
[1:17:14] church well uh we uh we found out that
[1:17:18] we were naked a word they never used
[1:17:20] before
[1:17:22] a word they never expressed before but
[1:17:26] this is new vocabulary we are naked how
[1:17:29] did you discover that you were naked
[1:17:32] brother Branham said see they had a holy
[1:17:34] Veil
[1:17:35] that they couldn't recognize that they
[1:17:37] were naked but now today there is an
[1:17:40] Unholy Veil and then then the land of
[1:17:43] seeing churches they don't realize they
[1:17:45] are naked
[1:17:47] spiritually naked
[1:17:50] good God almighty but it said he says
[1:17:53] look here he say he says uh Adam what is
[1:17:56] this what's going on it's like well you
[1:17:58] know that all this happened and and say
[1:18:00] look that that fig leaf that you got
[1:18:02] that ain't gonna do it that ain't gonna
[1:18:03] do it that ain't gonna get it fixed
[1:18:05] now this did not surprise God when
[1:18:07] anytime anything go wrong God is not
[1:18:10] surprised
[1:18:12] I need you to understand God God is not
[1:18:15] in in a tizzy trying to figure out what
[1:18:17] he gonna do God already knew what he was
[1:18:19] gonna do
[1:18:21] it was only a man a part of his great
[1:18:23] plan
[1:18:25] so there was a statement that was made
[1:18:27] here and I want to read it out of
[1:18:29] Genesis 3 and 21.
[1:18:31] glory to God
[1:18:36] God was requiring blood all the way from
[1:18:39] Genesis
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:43] and and and and after God realized that
[1:18:45] their their their their their fig Leafs
[1:18:48] weren't going to do it
[1:18:49] this is what the Bible say unto Adam
[1:18:51] also and to his wife
[1:18:54] did the Lord God make coats of skins and
[1:18:58] clothe them
[1:19:00] so so here we have god making a man
[1:19:03] coats of skins and he's giving them
[1:19:06] closer you're gonna need this
[1:19:08] in order to to get yourself you know if
[1:19:11] you want to be appropriate now and
[1:19:12] coming to church you're going to need
[1:19:14] this hello somebody
[1:19:16] I mean when you want to come to church
[1:19:19] you got to come come under the blood
[1:19:22] the covering of the blood if you ever
[1:19:24] want to come into the presence of God
[1:19:25] you're gonna have to come under the
[1:19:26] covering of the blood
[1:19:30] Hallelujah and he's telling them he said
[1:19:32] he said now you're gonna you're gonna
[1:19:33] we're gonna need these coaster skins now
[1:19:36] now this is this is important to me
[1:19:38] because the prophet tells us
[1:19:40] amen first of all we got two prophets
[1:19:43] talking let me put it this way the
[1:19:45] prophet Moses tells us that God gave
[1:19:49] them a man coats of skins that's what
[1:19:51] the prophet Moses tells us come on
[1:19:54] somebody but then the prophet William
[1:19:56] Branham
[1:19:57] goes a little deeper than what Moses
[1:20:00] said and let me tell you they're going
[1:20:02] to the same mind of God and bringing
[1:20:05] these things forward to us
[1:20:08] and God's Prophet told us that what
[1:20:10] these coasts of skin that's all the
[1:20:12] Bible said close to skin
[1:20:14] what skin
[1:20:17] can so a prophet tells us today that God
[1:20:20] used a lamb
[1:20:22] took a lamb took the skin off the lamb
[1:20:26] bleeding bloody skin of the Lamb wrapped
[1:20:29] it on Adam and when they're going to
[1:20:31] church they can feel the blood hitting
[1:20:33] their legs
[1:20:35] they can feel the blood dropping on
[1:20:37] their feet
[1:20:38] hey you ought to feel the blood this
[1:20:41] morning
[1:20:43] you are the field of blood every day
[1:20:47] the bleeding blood of Jesus
[1:20:53] he says it was a lamb that God took
[1:20:57] and he took the skin off the lamb and it
[1:20:59] gave it to Adam and Eve
[1:21:01] come on somebody
[1:21:03] glory to God and I like to say it like
[1:21:06] this if you can leave the prophet Moses
[1:21:08] can talk about coats of skins and Moses
[1:21:12] was not in Eden
[1:21:15] if you can believe Moses then you can
[1:21:17] also believe William praying him because
[1:21:19] he had the same prophetic office
[1:21:22] to tell us what happened there in
[1:21:24] needing why would it be a lamb
[1:21:28] why would God take a lamb
[1:21:31] because God knew that there was a lamb
[1:21:33] sling before the foundation
[1:21:37] of the world and there was a lamb that
[1:21:40] was going to be slain at Calvary so God
[1:21:42] slew a lamb in the Garden of Eden amen
[1:21:46] it was just amen a type of what he was
[1:21:48] gonna do at Calvary he wrapped Adam and
[1:21:52] Eve in Blood and he's rap you and me in
[1:21:56] blood
[1:21:58] we've been brought back praise God by
[1:22:02] the blood
[1:22:03] Adam could come to church because of the
[1:22:07] blood
[1:22:08] he could come to church because of the
[1:22:11] blood you are here today
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:15] because of blood
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:24] you can come here dude and have that
[1:22:26] blood
[1:22:29] Adam I want you to come to church
[1:22:33] but you can't come in a fig Leaf like
[1:22:35] that
[1:22:36] you're gonna need this
[1:22:38] wrap yourself in this atom
[1:22:40] and come on back let's have some church
[1:22:51] in the book of Exodus God talked about
[1:22:53] blood
[1:22:57] they were getting ready to take an
[1:22:58] exodus
[1:23:00] they were leaving Egypt
[1:23:03] they were leaving the things of the
[1:23:05] world
[1:23:06] come on somebody amen but before they
[1:23:09] left there were certain plays that
[1:23:10] dropped amen and and the last plague was
[1:23:14] the plague of death
[1:23:16] and and the way God set up is then I
[1:23:18] look now uh this play gonna come now
[1:23:21] y'all seen all the other ones and and I
[1:23:23] mean rain uh you saw frogs you saw uh uh
[1:23:27] lice you saw you saw all kind of stuff
[1:23:30] right he says now now you saw me turn
[1:23:32] you turn turn The Ward into blood you
[1:23:34] saw it he said you know what I mean
[1:23:36] business
[1:23:37] now here's the last one this is going to
[1:23:40] be the plague of death now here's what's
[1:23:42] going to take somebody gonna have to
[1:23:43] take some blood and put it on the on the
[1:23:44] top of the door and on the sides of the
[1:23:47] door say it now when this when the angel
[1:23:49] the death angel passes through the land
[1:23:51] the house that has the blood on it is a
[1:23:55] house that would be spared
[1:23:58] Hallelujah
[1:24:00] glory to God let's pick it up here in
[1:24:02] Exodus 12 verse 5 through 7.
[1:24:05] the house that has the blood is the
[1:24:07] house that's going to be spared
[1:24:10] if you don't have blood the firstborn
[1:24:12] son is good as dead
[1:24:14] from the house of pharaoh to the to to
[1:24:16] every house that was in Goshen
[1:24:20] this is the one plague that everybody
[1:24:21] was impacted by some of the other
[1:24:24] plagues it was only in Egypt Goshen was
[1:24:26] was free but when it came to blood
[1:24:30] everybody
[1:24:32] had to apply
[1:24:35] whether he was in Egypt or in Goshen you
[1:24:37] better make sure you have blood
[1:24:43] Exodus 12 Hallelujah
[1:24:45] it says your lamb shall be without
[1:24:48] blemish
[1:24:49] a male of the first year so you just
[1:24:52] couldn't go off of God anything it had
[1:24:54] to be your best
[1:24:55] right your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:24:58] a male of the first year you shall take
[1:25:00] it out from the sheep or from the goats
[1:25:02] he says and ye shall keep it until the
[1:25:05] 14th day of the same month and the whole
[1:25:08] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[1:25:10] shall kill it
[1:25:12] in the evening don't not in the morning
[1:25:15] but you kill this lamb in the evening
[1:25:17] and when you kill an evening and they
[1:25:20] shall take the blood
[1:25:21] and strike it on the two side posts and
[1:25:24] on the upper door post of the house
[1:25:26] wearing you they sell wearing they shall
[1:25:29] eat it so so here they had a commandment
[1:25:31] before they were going to leave Egypt
[1:25:33] before The Exodus was to occur they had
[1:25:35] to take the blood from the lamb and put
[1:25:37] it on the top of the door and on the
[1:25:40] sides of the door and I don't care if
[1:25:42] you just freshly painted your house
[1:25:49] last week I just went out to Home Depot
[1:25:54] and I got fresh paint and then the
[1:25:56] profit gonna come up with this
[1:25:59] put blood on my door with this fresh
[1:26:01] paint job look I mean I don't care God
[1:26:04] didn't care what you had just done to
[1:26:05] your house you better have blood
[1:26:09] and sometimes you know Daddy can get a
[1:26:12] little attitude with the prophet
[1:26:14] you know what I mean Daddy can get mad
[1:26:16] at the prophet private said this Prophet
[1:26:18] said that Prophet said this Prophet said
[1:26:20] that but see look look the firstborn of
[1:26:23] the household was the one that's gonna
[1:26:24] die so I can see the boy going to his
[1:26:27] daddy
[1:26:28] that I know you got problems with the
[1:26:30] prophet
[1:26:31] but daddy this ain't gonna affect you
[1:26:36] my question is do you love me
[1:26:40] I'm your first born son do you love me
[1:26:45] well if you love me whether you got a
[1:26:47] problem with a prophet or not because
[1:26:50] this thing happened the prophet saying
[1:26:52] it that thing happened the prophet said
[1:26:54] please please happen Prophet said water
[1:26:56] turned to blood and turn the blood I
[1:26:58] don't seen everything the prophet said
[1:27:00] come to pass
[1:27:02] nah nah he said put blood up there where
[1:27:05] the lamb at that
[1:27:10] we're gonna slay the Slam in the evening
[1:27:12] everything the prophet said we gonna do
[1:27:15] it
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:19] save that lamb
[1:27:21] put that blood up on the door say okay
[1:27:23] now I can rest in peace
[1:27:26] I can go in here and lay down because I
[1:27:28] know I've done exactly what the prophet
[1:27:30] said
[1:27:33] and when the death angel came through
[1:27:35] the land the houses that did not have
[1:27:37] that blood applied you heard screams
[1:27:39] coming all through the homes
[1:27:41] Pharaoh's home there and loud screaming
[1:27:43] coming from there his his firstborn son
[1:27:45] is gone the heir to his throne is gone
[1:27:49] because they did not apply blood
[1:27:52] see God God always wanted this Blood to
[1:27:55] be applied even today even today I want
[1:27:57] to read this this this quote out of the
[1:27:58] message token uh God God wants the blood
[1:28:01] to be applied even today we must have
[1:28:03] the blood
[1:28:05] hallelujah look at what the prophet says
[1:28:08] here in the sermon in the token
[1:28:10] it says now if you get that in Genesis 4
[1:28:13] 10
[1:28:14] then in Hebrews 12 24 start reading in
[1:28:17] Hebrews 12 24 the blood of Jesus
[1:28:20] speaketh better things than that see
[1:28:24] Abel he was a righteous man he died he
[1:28:27] died innocent because he was in the way
[1:28:29] he was in the way standing for the real
[1:28:31] Revelation he had he spoke it cried out
[1:28:35] the Justice blood of Abel cried out
[1:28:38] against Cain amen because Cain slayed
[1:28:41] his brother all because of a blood
[1:28:43] sacrifice amen Abel cried out against
[1:28:46] Cain amen but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:49] not only cried out
[1:28:51] it redeemed amen it speaketh better
[1:28:55] things it makes you Sons and Daughters
[1:28:58] it hides you the blood of Jesus
[1:29:01] it hides you from the wrath of God
[1:29:06] oh my my I just I just I I you know uh
[1:29:11] um when when Moses was getting ready to
[1:29:14] go back down into Egypt to take uh to to
[1:29:17] to go back and bring Deliverance to the
[1:29:19] children of Israel the angel Lord came
[1:29:22] seeking for Moses
[1:29:24] and and I mean a prophet the angel came
[1:29:26] to kill the prophet that had just been
[1:29:28] ordained to go down to Egypt and as a as
[1:29:31] an angel coming to kill the prophet uh
[1:29:34] the wife realized that Moses forgot to
[1:29:37] do something
[1:29:39] Moses was supposed to take his boys and
[1:29:42] circumcised them boys
[1:29:44] and even got to do it so the wife found
[1:29:46] a rock
[1:29:48] come on somebody
[1:29:50] I found himself a couple rocks and she
[1:29:51] circumcised her own boys and then took
[1:29:54] the skin
[1:29:56] threw it at her I had a husband's feet
[1:29:58] said brother Bram said what a wife
[1:30:01] what a woman that Moses chose for a wife
[1:30:04] took the skin and threw it down at her
[1:30:07] husband feet and then she made this
[1:30:08] sense you're a bloody man to me
[1:30:14] see it was blood God was requiring blood
[1:30:17] right but uh but it stopped the Angel
[1:30:20] God from destroying Moses amen now look
[1:30:23] let's let's go on here he says you see
[1:30:25] the blood he says the blood is what eyes
[1:30:28] hides you from the wrath of God right it
[1:30:31] says the blood of Abel could not hide
[1:30:33] Cain but the blood of Jesus came
[1:30:36] amen so Cain come out today if you've
[1:30:39] been a persecuted against the word and
[1:30:41] say the days of Miracles past this thing
[1:30:43] is all nonsense the thing is crying out
[1:30:45] the blood of Jesus Christ uh cries out
[1:30:48] but there's forgiveness in this if
[1:30:51] you'll just accept it wish we could stay
[1:30:53] a little while on that blood speaketh
[1:30:55] better things and it goes on says
[1:30:58] believe for safety

[1:34:39] with your anointing upon me he will do
[1:34:41] it
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:46] I believe that
[1:34:48] God has always required blood
[1:34:52] I was looking
[1:34:54] a man at this uh
[1:34:57] scripture and
[1:35:01] yeah I think I'll bring it in now
[1:35:04] um
[1:35:06] John 1.
[1:35:18] and the next quote I'll go to is out of
[1:35:20] uh invisible Union of the bride of
[1:35:22] Christ but John 1 just a few verses here
[1:35:28] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[1:35:31] and the word
[1:35:34] was with God
[1:35:36] and the word
[1:35:39] was God
[1:35:41] see then we don't have three three
[1:35:43] different gods
[1:35:44] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:35:46] was
[1:35:48] with God
[1:35:50] amen and the Word was God
[1:35:53] amen the same word he says uh the same
[1:35:57] was in the beginning with God so what we
[1:35:59] got to understand is that when um when
[1:36:02] when God dwelt Alone just just just the
[1:36:05] self-existing one amen uh in order for
[1:36:08] him to be identified with the human race
[1:36:10] he had to come in a form that would
[1:36:13] allow people to be able to see him like
[1:36:15] we can't see the wind we can see the
[1:36:17] effects of it especially when it
[1:36:19] hurricane season we see we see the
[1:36:21] damage from wind but you can't see when
[1:36:23] you can feel it but you can't see it but
[1:36:25] God wants to be in a position where he
[1:36:27] can be seen identified by people that's
[1:36:30] God that's God right and um you know so
[1:36:33] so God had to take on a form in order to
[1:36:36] be able to be identified in that form
[1:36:38] that he took on was what we call Logos
[1:36:41] or light
[1:36:44] Pillar of Fire
[1:36:46] so when we talk about the word was with
[1:36:49] God Amen the word is actually the logos
[1:36:52] or the pillar Fire or the light hello
[1:36:55] somebody right the same pillar fire that
[1:36:58] we see on brother Brandon's pictures
[1:36:59] that was what God was talking about here
[1:37:01] in this scripture amen we can identify
[1:37:04] the presence of God right he says the
[1:37:07] beginning was what was the word and the
[1:37:09] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:37:12] so even when God God being a spirit
[1:37:14] takes on the form of light is still God
[1:37:17] and I like the way brother Quaker put it
[1:37:19] just God condescending
[1:37:21] God stepping down
[1:37:24] you know I I'll never forget that sermon
[1:37:26] brother Quaker preached but he you know
[1:37:27] he's telling us that you know you can't
[1:37:29] go and just take your cell phone and
[1:37:30] plug it into the FPL power plant
[1:37:34] where all the energy at you you walk out
[1:37:36] there in that energy field if you want
[1:37:38] to you will not come back
[1:37:41] so they have to step it down they take
[1:37:43] it from there and send it into
[1:37:44] transforms you can't go touch that
[1:37:46] Transformer it's too much power in there
[1:37:49] he says so they have to step it down
[1:37:50] from the transplant and run wires into
[1:37:52] your house
[1:37:53] right and then when they get into your
[1:37:55] house they got to break a box on that
[1:37:56] and they break it all down to get into a
[1:37:58] socket but it's all coming from one big
[1:38:00] great power source but God had to step
[1:38:02] it down so it would be effective for you
[1:38:06] even in the word God had to step down
[1:38:09] his Revelation so it'll be effective for
[1:38:10] you
[1:38:11] oh my God Amen it take time to catch up
[1:38:14] to God
[1:38:17] and there was a quote in the church Ace
[1:38:19] book that brother Randall say even the
[1:38:21] things that we do know
[1:38:23] it's infinite testimal that means it's
[1:38:25] this small everything you know compared
[1:38:28] to what God knows you know this much
[1:38:35] infinite decimal
[1:38:38] makes a Smith Fox feel really really
[1:38:40] small In God's Presence we should we
[1:38:42] should feel small now let me go on in
[1:38:44] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:38:46] was with God and the Word was God
[1:38:49] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:38:51] now watch this
[1:38:52] all things were made by him and without
[1:38:55] him was not anything made that was made
[1:38:57] and him was life and the life was the
[1:39:01] light of men
[1:39:03] now let me just move to verse 14.
[1:39:06] glory to God because it it tells us that
[1:39:09] God's stepping things down now all right
[1:39:12] he says and the word that logos that
[1:39:15] light
[1:39:16] that was in the beginning the word was
[1:39:19] made flesh
[1:39:21] all right and dwelt among us and we
[1:39:24] beheld his glory the Glorious of the of
[1:39:26] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:39:29] grace and truth so what happened this
[1:39:31] logos it was still God it wasn't a
[1:39:35] different God it was the same God that
[1:39:37] was just changing his form so man could
[1:39:39] identify
[1:39:41] but that same body I mean that same
[1:39:43] logos took on a body of Flesh
[1:39:46] and that was the Flesh of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:49] Christ
[1:39:50] that that that that that logos became
[1:39:53] flesh in order to die for your flesh
[1:39:57] now there's a statement that brother
[1:39:58] Brandon makes it I just want to bring in
[1:40:00] here in The Invisible Union of the bride
[1:40:02] of Christ and I just I just like it I
[1:40:04] like the way he describes this
[1:40:07] he says what is sin
[1:40:11] is unbelief
[1:40:13] he says unbelief in what
[1:40:20] I need to underline these things
[1:40:22] unbelief in what
[1:40:26] unbelief in the word
[1:40:28] that's sin all these other things are
[1:40:31] attributes of sin smoking drinking uh
[1:40:33] partying and all this other those are
[1:40:35] attributes of sin but it's unbelief in
[1:40:37] the word that's what sin is
[1:40:39] Hallelujah be careful in that right I
[1:40:42] believe in in what the word unbelief in
[1:40:44] God which is the which is the word pure
[1:40:47] unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon

[1:47:23] the church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:47:26] spirit because the life is in the blood
[1:47:28] that's the baptism the holy ghost that
[1:47:30] baptizes us into his body that
[1:47:31] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[1:47:34] word denomination won't ever touch that
[1:47:36] it's a revelation she knows it so did

[1:47:43] hallelu is she ordained she's ordained
[1:47:45] not to fall she won't fail she's
[1:47:48] predestinated to it blesses the man who
[1:47:50] God will not impute sin you ministers
[1:47:53] know what I'm speaking of a couple dozen
[1:47:55] you sitting here see blessed is the man
[1:47:57] who God will not impute sin David
[1:48:00] now you know brother Brandon makes that
[1:48:02] statement the church is the blood of
[1:48:04] Christ by the spirit and as I was
[1:48:05] telling you the last time I was
[1:48:06] preaching oftentimes if you just study
[1:48:09] brother Branham in his ministry
[1:48:11] oftentimes you'll see that God will just
[1:48:13] kind of Quicken little thoughts to him
[1:48:15] and he'll jot those thoughts down and
[1:48:18] he'll just take that thought and then
[1:48:19] he'll just preach it
[1:48:21] right and and oftentimes now he made
[1:48:23] that statement but you now what
[1:48:25] scripture is he referring to when he say
[1:48:28] the church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:48:30] spirit
[1:48:31] he don't actually give you a scripture
[1:48:33] quotation to go to but the Holy Ghost
[1:48:35] allowed him to say that now let me just
[1:48:37] take a little further this is why the
[1:48:39] importance of having the fifo ministry
[1:48:41] right because a teacher would come and
[1:48:44] take that thought what the prophet just
[1:48:46] said get into the same channel or the
[1:48:48] pastor or the offenders will come again
[1:48:50] into that same thought and go back hey
[1:48:51] wait a minute that connects here
[1:48:58] so I got a little scripture because you
[1:49:00] know
[1:49:01] I'ma just be honest you know years ago
[1:49:04] the Lord had told me
[1:49:06] this has been over 20 years
[1:49:09] the Lord had told me it says uh and I
[1:49:11] was a faithful uh
[1:49:14] Sports Page reader
[1:49:16] of the newspaper he hasn't even got an
[1:49:19] accident one time I hit a lady in the
[1:49:20] back because I was reading the sports
[1:49:22] page
[1:49:25] hit I think she had a nice Mercedes I
[1:49:27] done ran right into oh Lord ma'am I'm so
[1:49:29] sorry
[1:49:31] I'm reading the sports page now people
[1:49:33] read their cell phones
[1:49:35] while they driving hello
[1:49:38] you got to be careful with this type of
[1:49:41] stuff the devil's just setting you up
[1:49:42] for something really really bad
[1:49:44] amen I I get caught myself sir I say
[1:49:47] Lord please forgive me God
[1:49:49] put that thing away put in your trunk if
[1:49:51] you have to put in your trunk
[1:49:53] amen you can't get to it and then I know
[1:49:55] you got your phone connected to it and
[1:49:57] you're trying to answer the phone no
[1:49:58] don't do none of that just let it go
[1:50:00] they can wait
[1:50:01] amen hello Hallelujah somebody
[1:50:04] amen I know that's good preaching
[1:50:07] anytime you get quiet like that you know
[1:50:09] you into something
[1:50:14] but um
[1:50:16] I was there and I was very you know
[1:50:18] faithful and reading my newspaper and
[1:50:19] then one day I was going down to pick up
[1:50:21] my newspaper outside when I reached down
[1:50:23] to pick it up
[1:50:24] uh I got it to go back inside I Heard a
[1:50:27] Voice say if you read your Bible's Faith
[1:50:28] because you read that newspaper you'll
[1:50:30] be much further up the road
[1:50:32] not stop
[1:50:35] I said now okay first thing I know the
[1:50:38] devil will not encourage me
[1:50:42] to read my Bible
[1:50:45] so I know that was not the voice of the
[1:50:47] devil
[1:50:48] but that was the voice of God speaking
[1:50:50] directly to me if you read your Bible as
[1:50:53] faithful as you read that newspaper can
[1:50:56] I say this if you read Joe Bob as
[1:50:58] faithful as you get on Instagram
[1:51:00] as papers you get on Facebook as Faith
[1:51:04] as you get on tick tock
[1:51:08] you'll be much further up the road
[1:51:14] so that day I I say well you know what I
[1:51:17] ain't even know what day of the week and
[1:51:18] what day of the month or what day of the
[1:51:19] year well I started right there and
[1:51:21] getting myself a Bible reading plan and
[1:51:24] I start reading the Bible through every
[1:51:26] year
[1:51:27] and I've been doing it since that time
[1:51:29] and let me tell you something since that
[1:51:31] time every time I go through the Bible I
[1:51:32] always find something that I ain't seen
[1:51:34] before
[1:51:37] but but by doing that
[1:51:40] I can look at a quote like this from the
[1:51:42] prophet and not get offended by what he
[1:51:44] just said
[1:51:45] I can see a connection in the Bible
[1:51:47] because I've read the Bible
[1:51:49] when he says that the church is the
[1:51:52] blood by the spirit
[1:51:54] let me just
[1:51:56] read the scripture out of Leviticus 14.
[1:52:04] the church is the blood of Christ
[1:52:07] by the spirit because the life is in the
[1:52:10] blood
[1:52:13] and I don't know if we get that
[1:52:16] because we thank God for the blood
[1:52:18] but do you realize when you get washed
[1:52:21] in the blood
[1:52:23] you become the blood
[1:52:28] you're bleeding
[1:52:30] you you've everywhere you go it's just
[1:52:33] the blood is coming out of you
[1:52:37] but this type of blood you don't need to
[1:52:38] pay a visit to the hospital
[1:52:42] this blood will bring Salvation to your
[1:52:44] loved ones
[1:52:46] it'll bring healing to the sick
[1:52:48] it'll bring Deliverance to the bound
[1:52:53] this the type of blood you can apply and
[1:52:55] and cause the devil to turn your
[1:52:57] children loose
[1:52:59] come on somebody
[1:53:02] here Leviticus 14 verse 1.
[1:53:05] and the Lord speaking to Moses saying
[1:53:07] this shall be the law of the leper
[1:53:11] in the day of his cleansing
[1:53:15] he shall be brought unto the priests
[1:53:19] and the priest shall go forth out of the
[1:53:22] camp
[1:53:22] and the priest shall look and behold if
[1:53:25] the plague of leprosy be healed in the
[1:53:28] leper
[1:53:29] then shall the priest command
[1:53:32] to take for him that is to be cleansed
[1:53:35] two birds alive
[1:53:39] and clean and Cedar Wood and Scarlet and
[1:53:42] hissing and the priest shall command
[1:53:44] that one of the birds be killed in an
[1:53:48] Earthen vessel over running water
[1:53:52] so one bird has to die in an Earthen
[1:53:56] vessel
[1:53:58] Christ had to not just be logos form but
[1:54:02] he had to take on a body of Flesh so
[1:54:05] that he can die as an Earthen
[1:54:08] vessel
[1:54:12] when Christ was coming Christ was coming
[1:54:15] to get a bride two birds connected one
[1:54:20] one one one bird has to die come on
[1:54:22] somebody but let's watch what happens
[1:54:24] here amen uh verse 5 says this and the
[1:54:28] priesthood command that one of the birds
[1:54:29] be killed in an Earthen vessel over
[1:54:31] Running World ask for the living bird he
[1:54:35] shall take it and the Cedarwood and the
[1:54:39] Scarlet that Scarlet should remind you
[1:54:42] of rehab because she put a Scarlet
[1:54:44] thread out her window that was her token
[1:54:49] come on somebody right amen it says a
[1:54:52] scarlet and and the hyssop and shall dip
[1:54:56] them
[1:54:57] so the living blood has to be dipped the
[1:55:00] dip dipped them and the living bird in
[1:55:03] the blood so the living bird has to be
[1:55:04] dipped in the blood of the Dead one
[1:55:08] come on somebody amen the living bird in
[1:55:12] the blood of the bird that was killed
[1:55:13] over the running water and he shall
[1:55:17] sprinkle upon that is to be cleansed
[1:55:19] from the leprosy seven times and shall
[1:55:22] and shall pronounce him clean and shall
[1:55:25] let the living bird loose
[1:55:30] into the open field when you're going to
[1:55:33] school
[1:55:34] you're going into the open field
[1:55:37] when you go to work you're going into
[1:55:40] the open of field
[1:55:41] when you're going to business you're
[1:55:43] going into the open field but before you
[1:55:45] went into an open field guess what
[1:55:47] happened you got dip
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:51] you got dipped in the blood of the Dead
[1:55:54] mate
[1:55:55] and now when you go into the open field
[1:55:57] you're just carrying the blood
[1:56:00] and every time you flap Them Wings the
[1:56:03] blood is
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:06] dripping dripping dripping
[1:56:14] you become the blunt
[1:56:16] you're the blood of a dead mate you're
[1:56:19] carrying the blood
[1:56:26] marriage of the Lamb brother random
[1:56:27] makes this statement
[1:56:33] but did you ever notice what the real
[1:56:34] church is supposed to do
[1:56:37] in the Old Testament when they had the
[1:56:39] sacrifice to kill one bird and put the
[1:56:41] blood upon the other the dead mate and
[1:56:44] it flew across the Earth spreading the
[1:56:46] blood of the Dead mate
[1:56:47] when the church becomes
[1:56:50] the real bride
[1:56:52] of Jesus Christ
[1:56:54] she'll carry
[1:56:57] the blood of Jesus
[1:56:59] with her
[1:57:01] oh Lord Jesus let us get that God
[1:57:05] because you know there's many in church
[1:57:06] that many preaching sermons about the
[1:57:08] blood today they preaching Oh The Blood
[1:57:10] did this the blood the blood pulled me
[1:57:12] out of denomination
[1:57:15] the blood pulled me out of the world
[1:57:18] the blood that same blood that they
[1:57:20] preaching about it keep me out of it
[1:57:24] and the other thing I come to find out

[2:01:50] uh Christ is the mystery of God reveal
[2:01:53] brother random makes a statement here
[2:01:55] and I'll end it right here he proves his
[2:01:57] resurrection life then as he vindicates
[2:01:59] himself she the bride is an independent
[2:02:02] from all others she's an independent
[2:02:04] woman a great Speck of bird that's
[2:02:05] different from all others you remember
[2:02:07] the Bible on that The Great Speckled
[2:02:09] Bird what we just read in Leviticus
[2:02:11] seven I mean Leviticus 14. it says uh
[2:02:14] the great speckle bird she had his name
[2:02:17] she had his life how did they speckle
[2:02:19] the bird
[2:02:20] they were both white and they were poor
[2:02:23] they pulled the head off of one bird and
[2:02:25] drained the blood out upon the other
[2:02:27] bird and the other bird was speckled
[2:02:29] with the red blood and it flopped its
[2:02:31] wings like this and the blood cried
[2:02:35] holy holy holy as it bathed the ground
[2:02:39] so Christ the dead mate put his blood
[2:02:42] his blood from his life into US carrying
[2:02:46] his blood crying holy holy holy unto the
[2:02:51] Lord it's an odd looking bird
[2:02:54] sure it is but she the bride is
[2:02:57] identified by him and she's independent
[2:02:59] from all others keep thee only unto her
[2:03:02] as long as you both live keep thee only
[2:03:04] to him the word no adultery not one sign
[2:03:08] of denomination see we've been brought
[2:03:09] back by the blood the breeding is to
[2:03:12] breeders out of denomination back to the
[2:03:15] super Church
[2:03:16] come on right he says he says um uh keep
[2:03:19] keep thee only to him the word no
[2:03:21] adultery not one sign of denomination
[2:03:23] not one sign of creed no adultery at all
[2:03:25] the word in him alone on Christ the
[2:03:27] solid rock I stand on other grounds is
[2:03:29] sinking Sands said Eddie uh
[2:03:32] says that's in Christ the word he was
[2:03:35] the word he is the word and the church
[2:03:38] becomes the word by him making her part
[2:03:40] of him he is the word the church becomes
[2:03:43] the word by him by what Christ did we
[2:03:47] become the word a man making a part of
[2:03:49] him and that's the word again
[2:03:53] personally identified by him his
[2:03:56] property alone amen she is Redeemed by
[2:03:59] him
[2:04:00] redeemed through him redeemed for him
[2:04:03] and for him alone that's right that's
[2:04:07] what the devil is howling about howling
[2:04:09] about that is being revealed
[2:04:13] the devil don't want you to know who you
[2:04:15] are
[2:04:17] but because I was washed in the blood I
[2:04:21] became
[2:04:22] blood
[2:04:25] let's pray
[2:04:29] father
[2:04:32] we're grateful for the word
[2:04:35] we're grateful that you sent us a
[2:04:37] prophet Lord to share your mind with us
[2:04:41] and oh God we would never know these
[2:04:44] things but as he reaches into the mind
[2:04:46] of God as we said Moses had the ability
[2:04:49] to reach into the mind of God
[2:04:51] and to write the entire book of Genesis
[2:04:54] he was not there
[2:04:56] he was not there but yet he wrote all
[2:04:59] the contents of it and he brought it to
[2:05:02] us we believe it
[2:05:04] and Lord you allowed your Prophet today
[2:05:07] to go back and just even Lord just give
[2:05:09] a little bit more clarity to what Moses
[2:05:11] saw and what Moses presented to us and
[2:05:14] we believe that as well God
[2:05:16] even helping us see that by the spirit
[2:05:19] we are the blood only through what
[2:05:22] Christ did just like we're able to take
[2:05:24] it right back to scripture in Leviticus
[2:05:26] 14 and and see the prophet even showing
[2:05:29] the types there
[2:05:31] we thank you Lord of what you've called
[2:05:32] us to and let us not be ashamed when we
[2:05:35] go back to work we go to school wherever
[2:05:38] we go let us not be ashamed Lord to
[2:05:40] carry this Blood it is a privilege
[2:05:43] Lord to carry the blood of Jesus
