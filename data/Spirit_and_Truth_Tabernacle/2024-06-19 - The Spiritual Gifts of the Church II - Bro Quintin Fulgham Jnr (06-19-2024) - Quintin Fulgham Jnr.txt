prayer and uh take our seats and it reads now concerning spiritual grips brother Brethren I would not have you ignorant Lord Jesus Christ we come before you oh Lord God lord we know oh Lord that only you oh Lord can give us the interpretation of your words and the intentions behind it oh Lord God Lord there have been people through the years that have gone through Seminary school from young to old oh Lord God and haven't been able to get an ounce of your wisdom oh Lord God and your Revelation oh Lord God but Lord you you decided before the foundation of the world oh Lord God that there would be a group in Florida oh Lord God and there would be peculiar people that you would pick out oh Lord Jesus Christ that we may not be the smartest in the world we may not be the greatest in the world we may not have many riches oh Lord God but Lord you saw us in loved us oh Lord God and because of that word of love that you spoke to us oh Lord God you had to reveal yourself to us oh Lord God you had to pour your knowledge and your wisdom oh Lord upon us oh Lord God to help us to understand what your expectations of us in life are oh Lord God in order for us to be healed oh Lord God in order for us to be delivered oh God lord the loved ones oh Lord that are still lost in the world oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we're praying to you oh Lord God but Lord I know you're revealing to us that we are the light for them oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord we can only get this light as you reveal it to us oh Lord so Lord we ask that you bless this little uh little lesson today oh Lord bless the people Lord God whatever needs that they have on their hearts and their soul oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord You're the same Jesus Christ when you walked on the earth oh Lord God you're the same Jesus Christ when you were in the prophet of his age oh Lord God and oh Lord we're so thankful that your spirit has not changed oh Lord Jesus Christ it still wants to operate through the people Lord God so whatever needs they have on their minds their souls their their worries oh Lord God if they can't even speak a word let the worries reach you oh Lord God let the fears reach you oh Lord God let the stress reach you oh Lord God and speak a word and Minister over them oh Lord God oh Lord we ask it oh Lord God in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may all have your seats now um so we're going to continue this uh little topic on we we'll uh go a little bit more further into the gifts a couple more gifts to um kind of get a revelation of what these things are and I love how Paul says uh for us how he doesn't want us to be ignorant of how these gifts work right because it's by Revelation that you have to receive something anytime anytime you want to receive something from God you first have to have the revelation of what it is and then you have to also have to have the faith to be able to use to uh uh receive that from God that's right all right and so in Matthew um uh 13:15 I'll just read this real quick it says for these people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed least at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted and I should heal them and I'm so thankful that you know we believe the Bible but not every verse is for us right and so these people right here uh uh of course Christ is talking about how they don't have the understanding they don't have the knowledge they don't have the wisdom and the faith to be able to receive from God so I love how Paul puts a little uh uh um a little verse in there for us so we're not ignorant about how these things work so that we can understand how to get our healing how to get our deliverance right so we're going to uh read 1 Corinthians 4-10 uh 1 Corinthians 12 4-10 just to kind of go over the spiritual gifts once again and it reads now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to um profit with all uh for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues so we have to expect that all these gifts are in the church and the prophet said the local church because a lot of times people want to push these gifts off onto great men and we appreciate Great Men We Appreciate Ministries uh I know brother Wesco has a great gift of faith and we know brother or Roberts in the past had a great gift of faith and we know a lot of these ministers out here have good GS good gifts of Faith but a lot of us can't get to them but that doesn't mean that God still can't reach you which is why the prophet said he places all of these local gifts inside of the church so that you have access to God 100% of the time right during the time of Jesus Christ a lot of people couldn't access him because he was in one body but when he died and split his Spirit Out Among the people he made himself more accessible so that there is a and I like that I like the um um I like it because now we can access him we can talk to him we can commune from and we can get something out of him at any time and we don't have to uh worry about you know going and getting a prayer card or going to meet so and so at their house but we can pray hey Lord I know that you have a a particular gift in this church now and I would like to use this gift in order to uh to get a result right so what we're going to do we're just going to recap what we learned uh last week in regards to the gift of knowledge and wisdom we'll just do this real quick uh so the purpose of wisdom was to give instruction in order for you to have a lasting uh uh and to have lasting results for both spiritual and natural things right so that's why when Jesus said unless you eat of My Flesh um eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you won't have uh life with me and that life he was talking about was everlasting life so it was wisdom to give instruction in order to receive everlasting life inside of your soul right and then we also know of Solomon Solomon used the gift of wisdom and also of discernment and we see used the gift of wisdom in the situation it's a popular story about how um he used uh the two mothers were fighting over the child uh and Solomon used the gift of wisdom in a peculiar way just like Christ had did when he asked he said let me get the sword and I'll cut the child in half one of the mothers he could uh one of the mothers he was using that wisdom to pull what was inside of the people out and so one of the mothers said okay yeah go ahead and cut it cut it in half and I'll take one half now that was a representation of something that was Notting but then the other mother said no just give her the baby in order for in order for it to live and then with that gift of wisdom that Solomon had he was able to point out okay this is the true one right here right and that's exactly what Jesus Christ did when he gave out his words of wisdom because the unbelievers when they heard that word they walked away and said this man is crazy then he went to his disciples he said will you also leave me and Peter said a beautiful thing he said where else are we going to go thou has the words of life amen so he accepted that wisdom and Christ was able to recognize who the true ones were right so that's wisdom and um the purpose of knowledge is to allow us to get closer to God that's the whole reason that we have knowledge and we know that knowledge is not something um you learn uh Jesus told Peter when he had asked a question he was trying to get something out of people he had asked them a question which is uh a question means you're trying to receive some kind of knowledge back and Peter gave the right answer and CHR was and Jesus Christ was able to perceive that flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which in heaven had given has given you these things and he gave Peter the keys to heaven right so that knowledge that Peter had had given to God brought him closer to God right so he got the keys to get closer to God right and so these gifts are not used for personal gain right that's an important thing that we have to uh understand even as we get more Church uh more people in the church because a lot of times PE that's why I say that's why Paul says I would not have you ignorant because a lot of times you know Gentiles come into church with their culture now they're gifted but they come in their culture and the gifts start messing up the church right right uh I I remember brother Smiley uh told me one time when I said this before he said gifts can get you in trouble and that's usually how it happens that's usually how a church starts to break down is when there's not a uh an order of gifts right and you start getting impersonations and all these things and all of a sudden the church is in just in uh distress just like it was during the time with the children of Israel right so gifts are not to be used for a personal gain and the gift of knowledge is not for you to walk around uh acting like you know everything or or even if you do know everything it's not for you to be kind of puffed up in uh in your spirit um because the problem with that and why knowledge is very very important because Paul had received Revelation and he also had a little issue he was going through and he was praying for God to take it away and God said no I can't take this thing away because it'll puff you up because you're getting all this knowledge so knowledge makes you feel and become God and when you get around people that don't know and you begin to say what you begin to say they can feel a lot more smaller they start to feel more distant uh distance away from you because they don't know what you know and and it's and it's like you're putting yourself in the position of God uh having dominion over the people but God never wanted us to use that kind of used knowledge in that way because when he came down he came in a Manger right and he had his gift of knowledge was beyond just a gift of knowledge and he had all knowledge but he walked with the common people he didn't wear the fancy clothes and all those things anyone could approach him and he had the knowledge of all things inside of him and so that's how God wants us to uh be when we have our gifts is to be humble so that people can approach us and it can be used correctly and we're not trying to get we don't have an agenda out of it where we're trying to get some kind of gain or oneup on uh a person all right so we're going to continue our journey now into um the gifts we're going to turn to 1st Chronicles 12 and read uh verses 9-1 to go to our uh go to the next gifts that are in the church oh yeah Corinthians sorry and it and it reads uh to another Faith by the same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the gift um to another the working of Miracles so we're going to talk about um so now these three G these three gifts I've done I've done my studying in the message and I found that they they work pretty similar as far as a as a result uh which is usually trying to get some kind of healing right so we're going to continue and start with uh this gift of faith so we all know that faith is a substance it's the evidence of something uh you don't see it but you believe that you have it right and all of us have faith every single one of us has Faith right if you are in the stature of the the perfect man you've received the baptism the Holy Spirit faith is included in that so Faith isn't something you learn about faith isn't something that you try to think up about it when you receed the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have a Measure of Faith right that just that that just uh uh that should bring you some uh uh assurity that that you have the ability to access anything that you need from God right so um um we're going to turn to um the message faith is the substance and uh it's a 47041 two in paragraph 20 and we're going to see what the prophet had said about this and I'll just start reading it while she pulls it up says now here now here not long ago I'll give you a little story of someone who came to someone who came so you can see what faith is and I'm just going to read this little first part right here faith is a gift of itself you may have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith and it's important to understand these things because a lot of times you can trip yourself up if you don't know how what what the difference is between your faith and a gift of faith right and you can kind of get yourself in a Sit situation where you believe oh I believe for my healing but I'm not healed yet and oh I don't have Faith no you've got faith you just got to know how to operate it which is why the the Holy Spirit comes into the church to teach us these things so that we can receive from him and we don't doubt him right so um we're going to continue on um so Romans 12 uh3 reads uh and I'll just read this quickly it says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think so number one no no matter whatever gift that you have no matter whatever measure that you have everything that has been given to you has been by the grace of God and you can't be any bigger than yourself you can't be any smaller right so it says but to think soberly according as God ha dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so God has given you a Measure of Faith each one of us has a different Measure of Faith right and it can seem kind of peculiar when you're cuz when I was when I first became a Christian in you're reading these things it can it can kind of seem kind of weird like okay I have faith there's a gift of faith like what do these things all mean right um and it shows why we have to have knowledge of stuff in order to receive from God so each of us has been given a Measure of Faith then also you have this uh gift of faith and I like to use an analogy to uh describe how these things work right so we all have different heights in the church right everyone some people are tall uh some people are short right now let's say there's a shelf that's 8T in the air and you have a blessing up there with your name on it right your blessing is right there what your name on it it's yours but let's say you're only 5'5 right now you're 5'5 so no matter how much you try to reach no matter how much you try to jump you ain't going to be able to get it yourself right but you got to remember the blessing is for you amen so how do you get it see God always provides a way you just got to put your you got to put your mind inside of his to understand how to get it right so now just because you can't get to that blessing uh that doesn't uh it shouldn't change your desire to want to get the blessing right it's yours it's got your name on it right so let's say you know you're 55 and you look to the left and you see someone who's s foot right now this person is seven foot and you have to understand that height is something that the Bible talks about is no one can add a stature to himself faith is your height is something that God has determined predetermined for you so some of you are tall some of you are short and no matter what you can't change it right so you you look to the left and you see someone who is s foot tall and you go over there and this is the key thing to remember you're not short enough to be able to reach the GU at s foot no matter what you'll always have enough height in order to reach somebody else right you're always going to have enough Faith to reach God in order to get what you really need from him you're never h and that's the thing that the enemy likes to come and bat on our head is oh you just ain't got enough Faith oh you're just not this you're just not that and it's just nothing but a it's nothing but a lie that's why that's why Paul could say death where is their where's your sting like you're just bluffing it to me because I know that I've received Christ I have faith and everything that I have need of I can I may not be able to get it with my own faith but I can reach out to something else that can get it for me right and so and that's why you know a lot of times people get discouraged they say because their faith is too weak weak and you got to get that weak uh word out of your vocabulary you got to get that weak word out of your vocabulary it is true that your faith may be small right and uh and I have and uh I think the prophet will talk about later on in the message because you know I have to we have to tell each other the truth you know a lot of times people like to throw like oh yeah I'll give you big Faith you may not have big Faith you may not have big Faith as uh uh someone else has or or a big Faith as somebody else has but when you have the baptism Holy Spirit no matter how small it is you still have a a Measure of Faith right so that's what the Bible talks about having a Measure of Faith but in Jesus said that if you have the faith of a mustard seed right you can move mountains now how that mountain is moved well that's up to God so we're going to turn to the message it shall be it shall be even um she can pull it up and I forgot the year so I can probably just read it it shall be even as it was told me and this is um a message that the prophet preached and I'll just go ahead and read uh this verse 65 says maybe you might not and also when he talks about this thing um it's going to it's going to tie into when we get to healings and miracles as well says maybe you might not have the spontaneous Faith to bring something uh just a miracle right to you like right quick like some people man they just speak and it just like it just pops right in there right in their lapse and people can get discouraged when they see that because they're thinking well why is not that happened to me that's right exactly that don't mean that you can't get whatever you need receiveing yours may take a little bit more time but the end result is you've got it that's the most important thing is that you got amen amen he said here you may not have that kind of Faith but Jesus said if um if you had the faith like a mustard seed you could you could sa this mountain be moved and by and by it will come to pass by and by will come to pass it wouldn't vanish away but by and by it will come to pass right um so your so your faith your faith is never and that's why we kind of got to we got to kind of shift our minds into the way God sees it and how how the way God designed us your faith is not small enough that you can't anchor on to something right you got to keep that in your mind that I may have a small Faith but I can anchor on to something that can help me to get whatever I need so that going back to the example of that five5 guy he can go up to that seven he can go up to that SF footer and he can tap on the shoulder his hand is not too short enough now his hand may not be able to reach that top shelf but he can still tap on that guy that 7even foot and say hey there's a box up there can you get it for me the seven footer looks up there he's like no problem just easy Faith just reaches it down comes down and then gives it to you and that's what a gift of faith is that's what a gift of faith is in a church there are individuals in the church that when they say stuff it just they just know they just believe it and know how to receive it you might be struggling uh to receive it but you can come to this individual and say Hey brother I got a need can you help me pray brother I have a situation can you come help me pray and then that can help come bring the blessing down into your own hands Glory right praise God and that's for healing that's for that's for uh anything that you uh that you that you uh might have need of right um so um you might be um you might be praying for for a new job right some people are looking for a new job the market might be tough um but your faith might not might not be enough for you to get that job but it doesn't mean that you can't you can't you can't receive it right you might need to get a hold of some brother or sister that has that gift of faith which is why God put it in the church and he said if two would touch and agree on one things I would do it right two would touch so you have to have two you have to have someone that has this gift of faith and you got to have this individual that he may not be able to have it but God wrote Provisions in there for those that even if you have small Faith you can still receive from God Amen you can still receive from God right we're not we're not we're not walking around like chickens we're not walking around like weak Christians we know exactly what we have God has given us the knowledge in order to be able to access him and when we walk according to his word he has to fulfill it right he has to fulfill it so that's the reason why we have to identify where the gifts are in the church we have to identify where the gifts are in the church that's why restoration of the gifts was so important to God because it's how he operates within the local church know the prophet couldn't be in one uh um be in one location simultaneously Jesus Christ himself couldn't be in a one location simultaneously but the gifts the restoration of the gifts was uh was was a way that God could reach everybody right reach everybody need so if you're going through some kind of issue you a have to oh well I need to uh wait to wake up to call the prophet to see if I can get some healing no no no You' got Gifts of healing right inside of the church you ain't got to worry about waiting on it and you can have someone that you can uh reach out to to help you uh get that healing that you want so you know and uh as going back to the example we can all identify who the tallest people in the room are and we can identify who the shortest people are we know who the strongest people are we know who the weakest people are and that's just the natural and the natural types the spiritual we should be able to identify those that got big Faith right we should be able to identify those that have faith to to move mountains that spontaneous Faith because they're there right amen so we need to identify the gifts and and that's why identification is is very important in restoration amen right because when we get our new church you know and me I'm not looking for 5,000 member church or a 10,000 member church right we want members that have been identified in the body of Christ which means they have a gift they have the Holy Spirit to help them live the life and to use the gift and operate the gift so every Sunday we're going to church and we ain't going to a club we're not going to a zoo we're not going to some place where you know cuz the gifts get out you know you have people coming church and the gifts get all out of order and it just causes the church to fall you know people start to impersonating gifts which creates jealousy and then people start using gifts in a way that is uh uh um with lusting spirits and you start breaking families up but no we want a church that people have been identified and restored back to their original position all right so then we can all be blessed and stay blessed all right so we're going to go through and uh look at some of these examples of a gift of gifts of faith I think we're just going to go through one it's uh the Queen of Sheba um preached in 60 0710 and we're going to read paragraph 17 I believe um yes oh wait yeah that's the one yep so it reads here now I believe that these Ministries that have we have that we have today across the world one different from the other I was watching brother or Roberts just a few moments ago in room they have a television in the room in there they have for me and that's amazing how the prophet was still he still looked at people even though they weren't in the message but yeah he still was considering them and like yeah man I'm just I'm interested in this person's Ministry and what they're doing for the Lord uh um and so he said and I was I heard them announce that or Roberts and I went over and turned the television on they did and I seen or oral praying for a little sick baby from up in Canada had a bad eye and I believe the parents was Catholic and brother Roberts in his real way of Faith he slammed his hand down on the little baby and prayed for it and the little baby was healed and he says here now that's a real gift of faith that brother Roberts had so the prophet wasn't I'm glad that we that I'm glad that God could get hold of a man that wasn't jealous jealous with the gifts of feeling and seeing someone else doing it but no he said no man that's a gift of faith over there that's a real gift of faith Opera over there even though he wasn't the one doing it and that's what we want to see in the church brother right right all right and we're going to continue and it says and we know that brother Jack Cole he used to have a little Anvil laying by the side of his desk somebody come up with glasses on he take the glasses off and break them with the hammer throw them over have crunches he take their crunches first and chop them up throw them away he burnt every bridge uh there they had only one Jack C and so he's talking about this man's gift of faith where he just hey look I believe you're healed and I ain't trying to see nothing else right he was determined but what I'm trying to hope to get though we've got or Robertson here we got Jack Coen here you know amen you know and when I get to the age where I start wearing glasses I want to be able to go to you and you break my glasses up so I can so I can see all right amen so so those are the gifts that is what to that is what the gift of faith is and what it is used for in order to help the church out right right and so we're going to talk about the next uh gifts that we have in the Bible and we're going to go back to 1st Chronicles 12 uh 9 through1 oh Corinthians yeah 1 Corinthians 12 um 9-10 and we're going to start from to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the uh the working of Miracles right um and so I group these two together because they they serve the same purpose in uh trying I believe in uh trying to bring uh some healing to somebody right uh so we we all appreciate how the prophet performed Miracles but the thing the thing I love about Jesus is when you get in a relationship with God you won't be dependent upon a man you you appreciate what God has done through man's but when you have Christ in in your life you realize that his Spirit does the same thing everywhere that's why the prophet could say that you know if you got the baptism the Holy Spirit and you can cut up and act up and this person got the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they living right there's something wrong we love his spirit because if it operates the same in one it does the works in one person it does it in all people right so to understand the gifts of healing we have to first understand what healing is right so we're Triune beings uh we have a body a spirit and a soul and what healing does it's pretty simple uh healing just brings you back to a desired state right healing brings you back to whatever desired state that you had uh and now there's a difference between the Bible says here uh the uh between Gifts of healing and then there's also a Divine gift which comes through the land and the prophet had a Divine gift of healing you know some people can kind of get these things twisted up but he but um I believe he explained it as he would get vibrations if he would touch someone's hand and he would see the sickness on on their wrist that's right and they pray for them the vibrations would go the sickness would go away and then he knew that they were healed now that was a Divine gift of healing only the prophet had that right uh it's a or it's a ordained gift before the foundational the world and only one person has that gift and God uses that as a basis to not be worshiped but for you to develop faith in healing all right because the gift is no longer here amen that gift is no longer here but has God stopped healing no well no all right so that gift is just to use to help build your faith in God to receive what you need to receive right amen um and so um then there's the gifts of healing which is uh the prophet described as uh many ways of healing um and what we need to understand uh the next thing that we need to understand is what happens during a healing and a miracle and for that we're going to turn to the message healing which was preached in 53 904 uh we're going to start from paragraph uh 24 and I'll just read a little bit of it and kind of skip over some of it so it's not too long so it reads now Believers here's what's the matter with you you're afraid to take the initiative you're afraid to stand and claim your god-given privilege see the devil actually leaves and when he goes out then you feel better for a few days and then after a while you say I'm getting sick about 72 hours of real case less it's a miracle just a Vine so here he's making a distinction between miracle and healing now there's a difference between Gifts of Miracles and Gifts of healing does anyone know that there are two different gifts altoe now healing when the regular procedure that person will get good just a real good just a real good for a few days and then they get then they get real sick what's the matter that big lump of cancer in there is dead tissue no life in it it'll begin swelling swelling and know you get sick we're going to skip all the way down to 26 paragraph 26 says in plain words where the simplest child would understand and the only way I know to put it it'll rot as it's laying right there there rotting in your body when it when it does your heart stream your bloodstream is being purified by your heart and it picks up that and causes sickness and headaches and know you can't stand up hardly and and and this is this is a beautiful thing because you have to understand brother brandham didn't go to medical school and a lot of doctors may not know how to explain this come on brother but he had a Divine gift of healing and a knowledge given from God to be able to see these things and come and explain them to us so that when we go to the doctors and we're not feeling well we don't get scared oh doctor it doesn't look like you're getting any better but we have doctor Jesus that says just hold on hold on the healing is coming all right and so it read as we continue it says and the person immediately the patient weak in faith there goes that word weak again will say I lost my healing all right why God's not that kind of a father oh man you can't lose your healing Jesus purchased it it's yours when Jesus prayed for Peter said I pray that your faith fail notah right so that's something and and I and I love it because that was Jesus Jesus was a representation of what we should be and he realized Jesus realized he was strong in faith and he looked at Peter and he was like I'm praying that your faith doesn't fail and what was told to Peter was when you receive when you get converted go and strengthen your brothers so we all should be at a point where we want to see where um cuz we know that people's Faith Can waver and can weaken and don't be ashamed of as uh uh when you're in that kind of a situation don't be ashamed to not want to go to brother and say hey I'm just having a moment of weakness don't try to fight it all on your own go to someone that can pray for you just like Jesus prayed for Peter right and we know that um um by faith we know that um I can't remember can't remember what sister it was but she said I know Jesus that whatever you ask of God God will do it but now we're the Jesus of today and people that are in Weak of Faith should be able to come to us and say hey I'm going through this right now but I know you're a real Christian I know that when you get on your knees and when you pray God's going to do something right we should have the exact same testimony as that says I pray that your faith not fail not his morals CU they did and it's important to understand that is because the currency in the church is not morals or righteousness the currency to receive things from God is faith faith alone that's why the prophet said you know you would have people that been going to church for years just righteous living they come up to the prayer line and can't even get can't even get healing for a toothache but you'll have a prostitute or a druger will come right up no morals at all but believe what they see and leave back uh healed right and it's also it's just to show that it's not it's your uh your faith we want to live a righteous life right we do want to live a righteous life and God requires it but the element of faith is a little bit separate right uh in order for us to uh receive from God right so we're going to continue this now now when you go now let me show you what takes place excuse me for saying let me show you we're going to get little details in this I didn't mean that I don't mean that I could show you nothing but I tell you the best of my knowledge what I see in the realm of it so this Prophet is looking in the realm he's looking beyond the realm of your sickness and he's able to see these things that doctors can't see that me and you cannot see and me and can identify them and it's and it's not F it's not for you to worship a man but it's for you to appreciate the gift God gave him so that you could have faith in your healing that you could understand these things and understand and know that okay even though I might feel bad you know so and so prayed for me but I but I but I still feel bad that doesn't mean that you're not healed that doesn't mean that you're not healed right right he says that when that cancer goes out when it's cast out you see the very evidence of everything that was of the Son of God and his and the leading of his people working and showing his signs and miracle and that demon is pronounced gone and you feel as gone and then in 2 or 3 days you start doubting again the very faith that taken it out unbelief will bring it back again wow right so it is true that you can receive your healing from God right but as brother Jack had preached if you want to keep your healing there's where righteousness comes in when you live righteous to God it shows that you believe God and when you keep believing God you keep that faith in order for you to always be healed all right praise God so um so what exactly are the gifts of healing now that we kind of understand what healing is and we need to understand exactly what these gifts are so I want everybody in here to raise your hand everybody raise your hand and say I'm Healed I'm heal he say I healed I'm Healed say I'm Healed I'm healed amen see your healing was already purchased 2,000 years ago praise God amen you're already healed Glory it's not some it's not some great gift it's not some great person it's not some uh uh necessarily the hands and all these things you were already healed 2,000 years ago when Christ hung his head on the cross it was a finished work all right it was a finished finished work right so all all the gift of healings or these gifts of healing all they come to do is to stimulate your inner man to say I am healed and then when the Inner Man says I am healed it's over there's not enough devils in Hell there's not enough doubt there's not enough uh uh issues not I mean the doctor could explain your symptoms away he could give you back a report but once you know that inner man has said amen to the word of God God will bring it to pass amen amen no it's it's not someone that's touching you with hands but it's your faith that's doing it all right it's your faith that's doing the work so we're going to turn to the message why I'm praying for the sick uh preaching 54 0314 wow and we'll start at um paragraph 28 and it reads here I've been interviewed at Mayo brothers twice so they say we don't profess to be healers Reverend Brandon we only profess to assist nature there's only one Healer that's God right God is the only here and that's correct no Minister can heal you no there's people who claim to have gifts of healing Gifts of healing don't mean you heal people it only means you have the faith in the word right you only have faith in the word and we're going to go drop down to 32 and he says here God works in many different ways to heal the sick it's it's important to understand this because God has a particular way of doing things and you have to get in channel into that in order to receive from God cuz God's not a liar if God says you're healed you're healed am now however that happens that's on him right but God is not a liar all right so God works in many different ways to heal the sick sometimes preaching the word sometime amen sometime a neighbor sitting by you he just lay his hands over you feel like he should do so God always do that what whatever a born again child of God feels to pray for the sick that's the Holy Spirit moving in you to do so no matter who's going to pray for the person you go ahead and pray for them and that's important no matter who's going to pray for the person you go ahead and pray for them anyhow amen oh yeah um my God and this is actually um just to kind of paraphrase it I want to take too much time but this is actually to paraphrase because brother Jack brought this story up of a woman that was wanting to get some healing for her baby and this one lady just felt she's like man I just feeling my conscious like God wants me to pray for this child right so I just want to say a prayer for that child and the funny one of the funny things that I find about it is the lady that had her child pray for and this is why we need the knowledge of God to come in and show us how God operates because the funny thing is she still went up to the prayer line right that's why Paul said I don't want you to be ignorant of the spiritual gifts because when she went up to the prayer line there's nothing the prophet could do he didn't say a prayer he didn't he there was no prayer he said he said he just he just looked at a child he said hold on a second your child's already healed that's right right you know so oh so the moment that that lady that sister had submitted herself to the Holy Spirit touched a child the work was already done Amen in the meeting of the Prophet that's right so like I said we appreciate the Great Men of God right right but the gifts are in the church operating amen whether there's a prophet or no Prophet the gift of healing is still there for us to use it's the same Holy Spirit glory amen so we have to um so we have to let people know how these things work or else people get frustrated and there's where because you don't lose your faith right you don't lose your healing you don't lose your faith but you can weaken your faith your faith can be weakened by not understanding how God is doing things so God's got to kind kind of come and give a word to encourage you doing that to know that uh uh you still uh um have your healing right and it's important if uh god um gives you the gift of healing that you're using it for his glory and we're going to turn to uh the message s we would see Jesus preached in 61 0208 and this is why I said in the beginning of the sermon uh gifts are not for personal gain and you have to be careful about these things uh and a lot of these things because you're born in the message you are receive a lot of light but you may be able to tell these things to help other people out that are in certain situations um and it reads just like what Charley Fuller said down here one time brother Fuller he said I believe in these gifts and I believe in these great gifts of healing too but said they're Gifts of healing but God is going to make them answer at the Judgment bar for commercializing it wow and I believe so he's right there yes sir don't commercialize God he can't be commercialized but God will make you pay for what you're doing the way that you use it so you know a lot of times we we'll laugh at you know people or not laugh but we may poke fun of people you know to tell evangelist that they say you know give me $500 to seed your blessing or give me $1,000 for your healing uh you know if no one's nobody's going to go to a buffet where there's no food right so these people are actually doing the work of God right these people are getting healed but the problem is they're doing it from a place like the people are already beat up people are already sick the people are already going through and now they're using their gift in order to take advantage of these people in order to take their resources but the problem is uh Christ already paid for the healing it's already been paid right so it's a h h it's a um it's a a mockery to the gospel right um so now um as um we'll get ready to close in a in a few so we'll we'll touch on these Miracles real quick so now Miracles are just are are just that right so we've got the gifts of healing Miracles are just that they happen instantly it's a Divine Move of God God comes right on the scene and changes things around it's done in a way where it's you just can't explain it doctors can't explain it no one can explain it God just comes down on the side and that process of you having a wait fore healing God bypasses all of that and just brings you uh uh up into a place of restoration just like that and you'll notice um I don't know if you would call us a miracle or not but a lot of times when you were saved there were some things you just stopped you just quit right there there are some things when you got saved uh the Holy Spirit came into your life it was over drinking smoking all that you just stop all that while there are other things where God kind of got to help you to kind of get healing from that thing and we and we thank God for the patience and healing to know it's still a finished work but some things you kind of got to go through because a lot of times people will struggle with stuff and they'll just think like man I'm just not a Christian it's like no you got to get your healing and you got to let it let it let God do it the way that he wants to do it right let the Lord do it the way he wants to do it the but the biggest thing is in your heart you have to have a desire not to do it that's the key we don't we don't want the desire to do these things and that's the key thing and when God sees that God can work with you all right so it's important how uh God to understand the mind of God how it gets operate uh because another another important thing that you got to remember with faith is you also have hope right now you can have the faith to receive Miracles but you can also have hope for miracles as well and those are two different things you can hope for a miracle but hoping doesn't promise you you get a miracle you don't hope for healing God paid for that you already healed you don't have to hope oh well I wonder if I'll get healed or not or I wonder if God's going to help me not no hope is not applied for healing your faith is automatically attached to Healing God has already healed you it's a done work now for a miracle that's something that you can hope for God can give you the faith for you can also hope for it because the Bible says that there are workers working of Miracles that are in the church right so we're going to read the message experiences um 471 1207 and start at paragraph 22 um let me see no we're going to actually start at uh paragraph 23 if you can pull it up but I'll start reading and it says here a little boy he was so pathetic the little fell come by and I might just tell this it's hanging there in the auditorium now a little boy with braces over his legs he come through the he come through the polo he said brother brandom he said will you say the prayer for me I said yes and his mother was there and I and and I said she said if you'll just say the prayer for him brother brandom and I said all right sister and I said now you're not she said I do not desire a miracle right I do not desire a miracle she said I just desire you to say the prayer and I had the prayer for the little boy just a moment and laid hands upon him and brother uh brother sister two nights after that the little boy was standing at the door the entrance where I come in his braces hanging on his back he was standing there see the Simplicity the uh uh humbleness of the mother said no brother brandom I can believe God I don't have to see any outstanding Miracle said I can believe God and I love that about the woman because it shows us Gentiles we're not gift Seekers and that's where Pentecost gets it wrong they're always looking for gifts they're always looking for a miracle they're always looking for a blast blessing but as but as Gentile full word bride Lord however you want to do it Lord it may not be a miracle I may have to sit here and suffer my bed for seven days but Lord I still believe you are a Healer Hallelujah right that's the thing uh um that we that we love about uh being Gentiles now God but God still uses Miracles now and we're going to turn to the Great Commission um uh message Great Commission and read chapter 13 so I kind of wind this up and it reads here it says I have seen prayer perform Miracles yes in this last day in this Modern Age that we're living in I've seen more miracles that Jesus Christ did in my meetings than I've read in this entire book so the miracle the working of Miracles are still in the church so it's the workers of Miracles it's the gifts of healing all of these things are are inside of the church and just to kind of add an extension because these are the these are the spiritual gifts but healing can come through the song leader if brother Solomon is inspired to sing a particular song right A lot of times we're always focusing on the message like what is the what what is what is so and so going to preach what is so and so going to say but God may give you healing right through that song service it'll be just a simple song it'll be just one line right but if it speaks to your heart for your situation is God trying to use a gift to reach to you right um I believe one of the uh one of I believe um another gift of healing uh I believe mothers are are like healers in the home right mothers have uh healing gifts in the home I remember one time I don't know if I had a cold or was a flu in Georgia but I just felt horrible and I was just on my bed but my mom came into the room and got in a rocking chair right by my bed and she started just patting my forehead and I wasn't I wasn't healed instantly but you just felt better because she was right there and that's what a gift of healing does you may not get an instant healing it may not happen instantly you still may be suffering but at least you know something's there that's still kind of holding you right and so that's how these gifts are supposed to be used in the church and God has God has made you and created you in a way to be able to have a particular gift and in order to bless somebody else so that's why we have to get ourselves out the way that's why uh one of the most important things that I mentioned in the last message is you got to have love right um one of the things that I've noticed is that people that have gifts and I talked about it people always want to use gifts but you can use gifts without love you can use gifts without love but the problem of it is sometimes God wants to use love without a gift right um I know I'm the type of person you know I like to have a lot of knowledge and stuff I believe God has blessed me and sometimes you know I'll be in a position where I'm trying to figure my way out of a situation that I'm dealing with and it's like no no no you need to put that to the side and just bear with these people and really show them love and that's why Paul came in there uh and talked about how though you have uh all know all Mysteries though you have knowledge you have faith to move mountains right you have all these gifts you can prophesy I mean you come in church and you prophesy blessings for everyone every single week but if you don't have any love right it doesn't mean anything so that's what we want to uh pray for church and closing we want to pray that God give us more love God give us more understanding for how you do things God help us to understand where the gifts are located and I mentioned this before we don't we don't we don't want people streaming we need people in the church we need the gifts all in the church so we can identify and know and use them so that when we're going through our problems we can call on God and God can be the same yesterday today and forever amen amen so we'll go close in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Christ Lord You've you've spoken your word Lord God lord we know that that all knowledge and all wisdom and all understanding it comes from you oh Lord God and it's a revelation and a gift oh Lord Jesus Christ that you've given us oh Lord God there are people oh Lord God that are struggling for healing there are people in the hospital right now that don't know if they're going to make it or not not knowing that you died 2,000 years ago and the healing is already done they just need the faith to be able to anchor on to it but you chose us oh Lord Jesus Christ you chose us to be able to receive and and to get from you oh Lord God lord sometimes we do admit that our faith may be weak oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord help us to recognize what these gifts of Faith are the gifts of Miracles the gifts of healing oh Lord God lord we may not be strong enough to uh um to have the faith to pray for our wayward Sons and Daughters oh Lord God but Lord we can hold our hand we can touch and agree with someone in a church that may have gone through the same thing and they've got the faith to believe it oh Lord help us to identify those individuals oh Lord that we can touch and agree that you can do the same thing if you did it for them you can do it for us as well Lord God oh Lord just restore the gifts in the church oh Lord God let love be the focal point oh Lord Jesus Christ and bless us oh Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen praise the lord well we thank the Lord for the word um um tonight um so much brother Quinton was sharing there that um uh man I could take off and preach a whole another sermon uh but I I did want to say this one of the things I just felt the Holy Spirit was emphasizing through him is that we have this ability as gifts um and identifying and recognizing uh gifts letting the Holy Ghost kind of do that not um not us doing that ourselves but but it's God has a way and I I put it this way God has given each one of us already something but it's us yielding and letting him just get the glory out of it that but um the the thing of it is he says being able to go to a brother that got this gift of faith like brother I just I know I got faith uh but I just need just a little little extra help and being able to you know get somebody can reach a little higher than you can um the the thing of it is is it goes right back to brother McBride's sermon that we are all connected right and and see how you know what the devil wants to do is bring little petty things into the church to keep the people disconnected and I mean and that brother the sister that you're getting disconnected from is the one that got the gift that you need but the enemy's job right is to disconnect us we got to fight the devil every little thing that the devil's trying to do we got to fight that I heard while I was away I heard brother Troy make a statement um I don't do this person that's the devil that's trying to come in amongst the people no we do everybody right that's my brother that's my sister and brother brandom said we might not hang like that but still we Brothers and Sisters in Christ right but but but we got to understand that uh uh if if we lose the connection right that's that's what's the Restorations all about to bring that connection back in place because these gifts operate accordingly you know I tell you I was just I'm I'm sitting there and and you know the other thing I'll tell you about the gift of um um of of healing and a gift of miracle and it say the Bible say gifts gifts but um you know uh the I remember years ago um brother colan had preached the sermon he said and there was there's what we call instant Miracles and then there's also span of time Miracles they're both Miracles but just some happen like we say a word of prayer right now and it's done but then there's others that we say a prayer right now you still go home with symptoms amen but you yet believe God that he has done uh what he promised that he was going to do and uh you know so you know he he you all know the story brother brandom told the ladies that come into the prayer line and they were prayed for and they went home and uh Weeks Later weeks later uh just said that um the angel came through the neighborhood to ensure amen that they receive what they were prayed for and the lady didn't know why but she start feeling a little funny where she used to not be be able to eat she said I just feel I feel led to eat and she got some of the worst stuff that she knew would upset her stomach and she start eating and didn't feel nothing eating a little bit more didn't feel nothing next thing you know she's praise God I'm I've been healed and and and that was a span of time right so so so when she um you know she said I'm going up to tell my my neighbor what just happened to me now why is she going to say that in order to encourage that other lady Faith but when she got there there was a Revival already happening in the house hallu and and and both of them have been healed in the same neighborhood glory to God brother sister why can't all of us get our healing all of us get our delivering if if the Angels passing by then do not pass me by [Music] but this is this is what we need we realize we connected like that and we got to fight that devil every little thing he try to no no no that ain't you know that ain't even Christian right that a even Christian you got to fight that amen that's right praise God now you know that sister calling you and you won't pick up the phone I'm going just let it go to voicemail you ain't even doing nothing pick up the phone and just say God bless you all right no I'm I'm man the preacher and preach that was that was some good word here tonight I'm I I I'm telling you I I I I thank God I thank God I thank God I uh oh you don't lose your healing or your faith but you can weaken your faith and um I just quickly want to say this brother brandham told us that um when we limit God to doing things uh only in one way actually you paralyze your faith and this is why you know if you expecting a check in the mail because maybe you got one before you got a unexpected check in the mail and now the way that you look for God to do things is always get an unexpected check in the mail you limit God and you weaken your faith now I'mma say something here I'mma say something y'all going to get these announcements for me but I'mma say this I'mma say this I'mma say this I'm going to take a big step I'm I'm y'all get y'all ready y'all ready okay I come from a day in time where people used to feel led yes sir yes sir they used to feel led to just give you a 20 or

testimonies or prayer requests amen I got one here I got one there any the other I got one there praise the Lord okay let's start here brother H praise the Lord God bless you all um I think I maybe like two minutes and I'll share a small testimony and I promise you that I I did not plan to share this testimony but I I believe that God god um when there's a desire in somebody's heart he'll make a way and um lately I've been like really busy back there with like my kid you know it's different when you come to church with your kid then when you don't you know I like church I like to be all all in the message but it's it's kind of hard so I I know that on the way here God provided for for little joose Not to Come As much as I tried for him to come and provideed Abby to drive so on the way to church I I was got to read a word you know and I was telling the girls that sometimes you know if you have a desire in your heart and you set yourself up you can actually like you know change the service you know so I was reading in Matthew 12 and it kind of just connects because it was talking about when Jesus was doing some stuff on the Sabbath and the the Pharisees were telling him some stuff and he tried to like run away and and it said that the a multitude took off with him and and it said that they were all healed and and I was telling the girls I was like sometimes you got to look a little more and it says they were all healed so like think about it like all they were all healed it doesn't say who or what but that's not my testimony I was just wanted to say that because then it just kind of goes into this and then as soon as he started um talking I think he went to the second quote like something just came over me real quick it was like like right there like you sharing this testimony right now you know and and I promise you I didn't didn't I mean I I like sharing testimonies I can't because I'm back there and and my mind is not anytime I've shared testimony like the Lord literally has kind of like said all right you go ahead and share it but um talking about faith and talking about healing um so about a month ago maybe maybe a month and a half you guys know what happened to Joseph that all the time you know so we were all together the whole day and on on the way back we get back to the house and um and um the girls were wi us and sister Armon was at the house we were like riding their bikes or something that day and um and and and we were going to go somewhere to feed the animals or something like that and we left the house and Joseph stayed in the house and right after we left Mandy called me and she's like man Joseph like he's he's in the floor right now like he said his head his head is pounding I mean exactly exactly the same way before he's gagging he he says he can't he feels like his head is going to explode and I was like oh really like are you serious and she's like yeah serious I was like well we're about to do this and we're going to come back home soon as I get back home I'm going to take off we're going to go to the hospital you know so I believe that she prayed for him when she was at the house and when we got back to the house he was in the floor in the bathroom like he's like I can't I can't do this my head is going to blow up you know so at that moment you know um I I I believe that my faith kicked you know I was like I don't care if your head falling off like there's nothing wrong with you right now bro we're we're about to go to the hospital and they're going to tell us that there's nothing wrong with you and we're coming right back here and and I told Harmony and Abby and Linda I say right now we're all going to stay here and I talked to them about a couple scriptures and I said the Bible says where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus that that that he'll be in the midst of that and he said where two or three two two touching agreeance that he will do just that so we're going to pray right now we set him right there and we all prayed like all together and I took off to the hospital and and and and war strategies you preach war strategies so I got a couple of those you know and I remember even brother Quin Junior one time he was preaching and he said that when something happens and the way that you act towards when that happen that that strengthens your faith and that all the time when that happened like I don't know if I ever shared the full testimony but we were like I I it doesn't matter what's going on right now I told Joseph I said Joseph they right now they said that you have three things in your head but there's nothing in your head the Lord already told me on Thursday and I tried calling you and I told you that the Lord said that there's nothing wrong with you you just have to go through this so that has strengthened my faith already so war strategies I get in the truck I say Mandy prayed we already prayed I'm about to hit up brother Jack real quick Hey Brother Jack this is going on right now we're not to the hospital you know would you join us in prayer and and I remember one little thing that brother Jack prayed that even lifted up my faith even higher And he as he was praying he said may this whatever it is that's going on May this thing uh uh be annulated go away and never come back that's what he said and I said amen never come back and we're going to know we're going to see if this is time is going to tell if this is going to come back or not so um to we keep driving to the hospital he's like his head is like I'm talking about even till the moment that I parked he's like I can't I can't my head is going to like it feels like it's going to explode and I was like bro there's nothing wrong with you right now we go into the hospital go in there and the the doctor comes and he starts checking them and and he starts doing like normal sign checks not like putting him in the machine and he starts checking and and as he's checking like within like 15 minutes of him checking he said you know there there's he there's nothing wrong with him I said what are you talking about like so what I want to explain here is like inside of me I'm like all right amen You Preach there's nothing wrong with him but then outside also as being a dad and having knowledge of what happened before I said you're not going to come and just look at his eyes and press on his head and tell me there's nothing wrong this happened before and and there was three tumors or or or or sis in his head like like he's like man I know what I'm doing if he has something wrong he would be doing this he looked at his eyes and he pushed Joseph back like like lift him back up and it it all looked like like like and he's like there's nothing wrong I said well if there's nothing wrong when you put him inside that machine okay and the Machine shows nothing then we're going to walk out of here like fine he's like it's not good to put children all in there I said I I understand but this is not the first time that we're coming here so back and forth so I don't prolong this we got to the point we called Mandy having explained to her and we both agreed we said we understand and we we believe that but we're going to check called brother Jack I told him what was going on he's like that's smart do that and he went they went in there they came back Joseph is already like within like 20 minutes of that he's feeling a little better you know we had gave him some ibuprofen or something I was like man when you have a a tumor in your head don't ibuprofen it's GNA make you feel better you know so um as soon as uh the doctor walked out I'm talking to him and he's like man I'm feeling a little better and I was like Joe Joe you're feeling a little better and I don't care where anybody's faith is at my faith is is in that whatever you didn't do that cuz you were playing around you did that cuz something was happening in there and whatever it was we prayed for it we it went away mom prayed we prayed and when brother Jack prayed he say it's never going to come back and we're going to we're going to stay with that so we went over there they took that the doctor's kind of looking at us like look you guys came over here for nothing this kid had nothing I said well they anybody can think whatever they want I know how he was acting I know what happened before and God healed him and and I wanted to I was like that was like on a Monday or Tuesday I think it was on Tuesday I was like man I'm coming to church they' been testifying how I'm I'mma share that testimony and and I guess it wasn't time to share and and God just set me back there with my son and I couldn't even barely can say Amen to the word but today I promise you all that I didn't have any plan I didn't plan to make it sound all good and the Lord just told me today is the time and it show how with the message how it was in the spirit of uh uh the the gifts of of faith and all that and I believe that God gives you faith I believe that God uh uh go makes you go through something to strengthen your faith I believe that if you don't do what the word says your faith will get will weak and it will will so I just wanted to share that with you all and and to to let you know that God is still healing we we we stay with the word and and and he'll do just what he said he [Applause] would amen we thank the Lord for touching our brother Joseph and proving that he is a Healer amen God bless you sisen I just want to give God uh thanks for two things one I was out in my yard today doing uh cutting my grass and of course we had 25% or more chance of rain and it started to rain maybe about 30 minutes while I was out and I was like Lord please you know hold up the rain so I can do my yard and like that the rain was gone I was able to do my whole yard and and then some so I thank God for that he's done it before and I thank God that he did it again today um also I I was prayed for um my blood pressure which I've had issues with my blood pressure and I told my doctor I'm like I'm just not one to be dependent on medication I don't want to be on this medicine for the rest of my life so she was like well you know I can help you get off well I'm not going to first get totally on for her to help me get off I take it I I try to monitor my pressure and I take it when I need it but I've seen low blood pressures that I haven't seen before like 117 and stuff like that when it's been 160 and 1 40 and I'm just believing God that he will regulate it it's been kind of going up and down but I'm just believing God for a total healing in unstable blood [Music] pressure amen we will stand in faith with you assist we certainly believe God

was a good time thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you so sister Britney sister Brown God bless you church God bless you um at work I may not that's the scripture that says we are written Epistles read of all man and I don't think I know how I dress but I see other people are noticing it too and I have been several of the I work at a hospital and several of the one of the clergymen he came up to me he said you know the way you dress he said I can tell you a Christian and he says I'm going to need you to go around to the hospital and tell these employees how to dress and I said uh okay um and I it this one lady another coworker um she works on a different floor and she was coming up to me and she was talking and she almost cursed and she was like oh I'm sorry I I I know you different I know you're a Christian I need to watch How I talk around you and there are a lot of people who tell me that was like there is something different about you you don't talk and walk and act like these people here at the hospital there's a light and I want to just thank God and and I want that light to continue to shine because in a place where there is darkness and I see sick people I see people dying all the time people always come to me and say can you help me can you pray for me and and again people have to watch the way they talk around me they can't talk any kind of way cuz they sense that and they like oh I'm sorry I I slipped up and I may have cursed around you I apologize please forgive me so I just want to thank God for that and just continue to let my light shine where I work praise the Lord amen amen sister Brown there thank God I just want to give God praise that today I I missed a real bad accident and uh a car actually just I'm driving along and a car just flew out in front of me crossing over in front of me trying to get to 95 I was on North Lake and when I hit my brakes they scrubbed so hard I mean I came so close to that car and I'm just so grateful and thanking God that I said look I don't have time for no accident I'm going to get my food praise the Lord but I truly thank God for his grace amen thank God for watching over our sister that's

of prayer amen as we just prepare to uh dismiss tonight uh father we just thank you for your word that has come to us um we just appreciate father this uh this journey through the gifts and Lord just um how you just place this in brother quinton's heart we know this is part of the restoration and um um um that the prophet actually taught us about so just hearing how you're just leading him through you know some of this is a real blessing uh to the church and father I just pray that uh you would just continue to anoint them and and and and and and use them for your glory god we have um a number of testimonies that have come here tonight and just how you have proven yourself uh you you touch uh brother Joseph and God you even prove through the doctor's reports that uh what was spoke by faith became reality in his life so we thank you for manifesting yourself Lord uh on his behalf and uh thank you for providing for uh uh brother um Maris as well as we heard the testimony you providing for brother Jerry uh we just thank you for for moving in that way uh God we also uh thank you Lord for touching sister Virginia and her body and God we We join her in faith believing that this will stabilize and that she won't have to be uh Lord worried about the medication thank you for being with sister Britney and giving her conviction that when nobody else is looking she's still living a life that is pleasing in thy sight that others would notice oh God that she is a Christian May her light continue to shine uh in the midst of that environment and Lord we uh we ask that you would also look upon brother Garren he has uh an opportunity and uh he's just LE stand open that if this is your will everything will work out perfectly fine the hours will be just right there will be no uh having to uh miss church or anything like that because of it but Lord everything will just work out fine so I pray that you would go before him and that you God would just direct the conversation uh as he enters into it our precious sister Michelle be traveling we pray that you would be with her God watch over and keep her and just bring her back lord uh when uh she returns and uh I know that also sister Tina and and sister cob be traveling give them traveling mercies as well and uh just pray father you just continue to watch over uh your people may and we thank you for watching over sister Brown uh it could have been a really really bad accident but God you you kept her thank you for uh being with sister Sean there on her job you've opened up this door and it's the devil's job to try to drive us off of our Mountain but we're going to stay right there amen until you say otherwise so God I I pray your blessings upon each and everyone thank you for all that came out to the house of the Lord as we leave this place but not your presence give us traveling mercies those that have streamed we thank you for them joining but God I agree with brother Quinton uh the gifts is hard to depend on a gift over a stream uh the gifts have to be in the church Lord so we pray that you'd open up a door for the people to be able to be in fellowship and God May the glory of God just continue to be manifested in our midst keep us until we're able to come back together again on Sunday morning it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord God bless you [Music] [Music]
