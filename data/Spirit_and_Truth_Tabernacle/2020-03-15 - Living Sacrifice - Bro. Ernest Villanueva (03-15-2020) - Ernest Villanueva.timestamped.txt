[1:07:49] thank God for that creative
[1:07:52] the right spirit for we start at one
[1:07:58] three ingredients from our assembly
[1:08:00] floor down brother invidual
[1:08:04] brother it is a venturi message he met
[1:08:09] brother Brent when he was just a little
[1:08:11] boy he was that many of his meetings
[1:08:13] he's so much of the supernatural then
[1:08:16] when he started the minister he was uh
[1:08:18] he was up north when there and so he
[1:08:24] invited the red to come down go
[1:08:28] that began a relationship and spanned
[1:08:30] over decades and brother many times to
[1:08:35] speak at his churches he traveled with
[1:08:39] and into wilderness many wonderful
[1:08:42] stories this is when Angela took place
[1:08:46] intended
[1:08:48] services so he has been a wealth of
[1:08:51] information and inspiration to me and
[1:08:54] he's 85 years old now and he's he just
[1:08:58] had open-heart surgery a couple of years
[1:09:00] ago and he's walking a little bit slower
[1:09:02] but the mind is still razor sharp he
[1:09:05] wanted to bring greetings to you and I
[1:09:07] want to say this has been a wonderful
[1:09:10] weekend and I feel like I don't know
[1:09:14] brother Jack and I have not met or said
[1:09:17] that to be as a mystery I've heard so
[1:09:21] much about it over the years and I said
[1:09:23] I can't believe Florida traveled in
[1:09:25] Florida
[1:09:26] many of the brothers are Florida but
[1:09:29] somehow I've never been down here thank
[1:09:32] you brother for this wonderful
[1:09:34] supernatural hospitality and met many
[1:09:37] ministers yesterday in the ministers
[1:09:39] meeting I didn't know and assemble was
[1:09:42] there with us we had a wonderful time so
[1:09:46] I'm gonna have you just be seated for
[1:09:47] just a moment I want to just give you a
[1:09:54] short testimony very very short and my
[1:09:57] testimony is that I am involved in a
[1:10:03] divine spiritual supernatural romance
[1:10:07] with our Lord Jesus Christ there has
[1:10:14] been a divine incarnation that has taken
[1:10:17] place in my life and has taken me on a
[1:10:20] mystical journey filled with drama
[1:10:23] intrigue mysteries and every day I wake
[1:10:27] up I know that were one day closer to
[1:10:31] being with our Lord Jesus Christ at the
[1:10:33] wedding supper and anything that we go
[1:10:37] through down here it's going to pale
[1:10:39] compared to the rewards that are waiting
[1:10:42] for real children
[1:10:44] god I think about the Apostle Paul many
[1:10:47] times in Paul he was beaten with 39
[1:10:51] lashes he got that five times three
[1:10:54] times he was beaten with rods he was
[1:10:57] shipwrecked and he was stoned and left
[1:11:00] for dead right and he picked himself up
[1:11:02] and he brushed himself off and he said
[1:11:04] okay where's the next meeting and he
[1:11:07] headed to the next meeting and much of
[1:11:10] his time is spent in jail and then Paul
[1:11:14] he says this light affliction all right
[1:11:20] worketh for me a far greater reward and
[1:11:24] war now when we compare our life and
[1:11:28] whatever trivial trials and challenges
[1:11:31] that we go through when we compare that
[1:11:35] to the prophet of God for that first
[1:11:38] church age we we don't have any problem
[1:11:41] in fact we know we're the spiritual rich
[1:11:44] get rich kids in this generation
[1:11:46] and we've got technology on our side
[1:11:50] we've got the word on our side we've got
[1:11:52] the message on our side we've got
[1:11:54] brothers and sisters we would we are we
[1:11:58] are in such a state of intrigue and I
[1:12:01] want to say this message to me
[1:12:03] it has energized and supercharged and
[1:12:06] electrified and illuminated it has
[1:12:09] stimulated activated motivated revelry
[1:12:11] to me I cannot even begin to imagine and
[1:12:16] God has allowed me to be on the
[1:12:18] religious merry-go-round I spoke on
[1:12:21] Friday night I was in the Catholic
[1:12:22] Church the Baptist Church Assembly of
[1:12:25] God focus or businessman Bible School
[1:12:27] UPC
[1:12:28] so so I have got a real clear
[1:12:32] understanding of the religious world my
[1:12:35] friends I can tell you the religious
[1:12:37] world has taken an invasion of insanity
[1:12:40] into the religious life into our
[1:12:43] political world and the business world
[1:12:46] into the music world into the sports
[1:12:48] world it is insanity on steroids
[1:12:53] No Satan Satan his desire in the
[1:12:57] beginning he wanted to be worshipped
[1:13:00] yeah and today he has that same desire
[1:13:04] and he does not care where he gets his
[1:13:07] worship from if he gets its worship in
[1:13:11] the Catholic Church or the Baptist
[1:13:13] Church or the Mormon Church or the
[1:13:15] Moonies or Jehovah Witnesses if he gets
[1:13:18] worship and people who are atheists
[1:13:21] agnostics if he gets worship from the
[1:13:23] music world that gets worship from the
[1:13:26] sports I does not care where he gets his
[1:13:29] worship from as long as he can keep you
[1:13:32] from thus saith the Lord and we need to
[1:13:39] every day make sure our priorities are
[1:13:43] right it's gotta be God first then then
[1:13:47] family and work and the things that we
[1:13:50] have to do we all have responsibilities
[1:13:53] I know that word responsibility it's a
[1:13:56] compound word
[1:13:56] it's response-ability so responsibility
[1:14:00] is having the ability to respond and
[1:14:05] do you have the ability to respond to
[1:14:09] what God has done in this thing do you
[1:14:13] have the ability to respond to the fact
[1:14:15] that in this building there are
[1:14:18] supernatural beings in this building
[1:14:20] that in this building everything that
[1:14:23] we've ever said or done or thought and
[1:14:26] every thought that we've ever had the
[1:14:27] motive the objective everything has been
[1:14:30] recorded and it was recorded and known
[1:14:34] before the foundation I work by
[1:14:36] foreknowledge in predestination and God
[1:14:39] puts us here today on free moral agency
[1:14:43] the greatest power that God puts into
[1:14:46] our hands is the power of choice we
[1:14:49] decide we decided what we're going to do
[1:14:52] and we have a myriad of choices you made
[1:14:55] thousands of choices every day you wake
[1:14:58] up what time we gonna wake up and you
[1:15:00] start preparing yourself and you get on
[1:15:02] the highway and you're on the road
[1:15:04] am I gonna slow down am I gonna move
[1:15:05] over and you're aware and your mind is
[1:15:08] racing at a million miles a minute you
[1:15:10] don't
[1:15:11] but it's scanning scanning scanning
[1:15:13] scanning they say the average person has
[1:15:16] about 10,000 thoughts and they go
[1:15:17] through their mind but the problem is
[1:15:20] 9,000 of those 10,000 thoughts are the
[1:15:23] same thoughts they had yesterday and
[1:15:26] this is the rehash in a rehash in a
[1:15:29] rehash and or we have of the news you
[1:15:32] know and who are the celebrities in the
[1:15:35] world and work work things family thing
[1:15:39] but God gives us the opportunity to have
[1:15:42] fresh thoughts every day he's put us
[1:15:45] he's given us the opiate of his word and
[1:15:48] I am super intoxicated know the world
[1:15:52] they are intoxicated in many areas of
[1:15:54] life but I am intoxicated with reality I
[1:15:58] do not live in a fantasy world I deny
[1:16:02] the fantasy world so that's just a
[1:16:07] little testimony Who I am what I believe
[1:16:12] I was telling brothers brother Jack that
[1:16:15] the Bride of Christ she has a very
[1:16:18] delicate balancing act all right we have
[1:16:22] to be holy and happy right and humble
[1:16:26] right and for me sometimes people
[1:16:30] misunderstand me because I'm so happy
[1:16:31] and I'm so excited and this message
[1:16:35] reverberates in me and when I go to
[1:16:37] church I'm right at the front room I
[1:16:39] want to be at the spot where the glory
[1:16:41] comes up
[1:16:43] and a whole group of young people now
[1:16:45] that are coming down because they want
[1:16:46] to be on Ernie's room you know listen in
[1:16:50] May I'm going to be 70 years old I still
[1:16:57] feel I still it's impossible to
[1:17:00] understand how did I get the 70 years
[1:17:03] old but I don't feel any different
[1:17:06] I still have excitement I still have
[1:17:09] enthusiasm I still have energy and I
[1:17:12] know that energy comes from a
[1:17:13] supernatural force and you know if you
[1:17:17] have a light here and and the light
[1:17:19] might look good I have a beautiful shape
[1:17:21] might have a beautiful design but until
[1:17:23] that light is plugged in to the source
[1:17:25] is not going to be any light come in and
[1:17:28] the Bride of Christ you have been
[1:17:30] plugged into a supernatural divine
[1:17:33] source with awesome results yeah Bride
[1:17:38] of Christ on display he is a walking
[1:17:40] talking supernatural encyclopedia
[1:17:43] walking down the road good things that
[1:17:45] you know the things that you see the
[1:17:48] things that you understand you are the
[1:17:51] divine spiritual supernatural
[1:17:55] aristocracy of God they might think
[1:17:58] they're the royal family over there and
[1:18:00] in here and they've got the kings and
[1:18:02] the queens and the princes of the pre
[1:18:03] all make-believe frogs and you the the
[1:18:10] revelation is for us to believe what God
[1:18:14] said we are
[1:18:15] I better get to the word let's stay
[1:18:20] let's stand to our feet all right I just
[1:18:24] pray that someday I'll be able to come
[1:18:26] back and be able to spend some time with
[1:18:29] you and get to know you and also brother
[1:18:34] Quentin thank you so much for the
[1:18:36] hospitality and be able to stay in your
[1:18:39] home and if sometimes when you meet
[1:18:43] somebody sometimes you don't really know
[1:18:45] who they are but when you when I heard
[1:18:48] brother Quentin pray today I said that
[1:18:51] there's there's a man he's so humble
[1:18:54] when I came to his house you know he
[1:18:56] didn't talk much and sometimes when I go
[1:18:59] to a meeting after a meeting I go out
[1:19:02] and I kind of sit down and and some fifo
[1:19:05] said well well brother Ernie something
[1:19:06] rise and no one he said well you're not
[1:19:09] saying much I said well I already know
[1:19:12] what I know
[1:19:13] I want to find out what you know so it
[1:19:18] helped sometime to be a good listener
[1:19:20] but when I heard brother Quentin pray I
[1:19:22] said there's a man that's elevated in my
[1:19:25] on every part of the body of Jesus
[1:19:28] Christ
[1:19:29] every part is a gift every person is a
[1:19:32] revelation to
[1:19:34] when I meet them when I feed off their
[1:19:36] spirit and I feel that atmosphere
[1:19:39] because we're creatives and when we
[1:19:41] create the atmosphere I want to create a
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost happiness if we can open our
[1:19:47] Bibles I'd like to invite you to look
[1:19:50] into the Book of Leviticus and we're
[1:19:52] going to read in chapter 2 and verse 1
[1:19:58] before we read let's let's talk to the
[1:20:01] Lord father once again we thank you for
[1:20:08] the privilege of coming together the
[1:20:11] privilege of being able to read your
[1:20:14] word to be able to read between the
[1:20:16] lines of what you have revealed to us I
[1:20:19] prayed today father that you would that
[1:20:21] you would help each one here myself the
[1:20:24] ones that are that are here to here help
[1:20:27] us father to hear exactly what you want
[1:20:30] us to hear and then give us the faith to
[1:20:33] be able to manifest what you make real
[1:20:35] to us today we ask all this and your
[1:20:38] precious and holy and wonderful and
[1:20:41] awesome name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:45] you know in many churches today most of
[1:20:50] them don't even go to the Old Testament
[1:20:51] because that's the Old Testament where
[1:20:54] in the New Testament
[1:20:56] that's law were under three and they
[1:20:58] miss the majesty and the beauty of the
[1:21:01] types and the shadows that are lying
[1:21:03] here so in Leviticus chapter two verse
[1:21:05] one and when any will offer a meat
[1:21:09] offering unto the Lord his offering
[1:21:11] shall be a fine flour and he shall pour
[1:21:14] oil upon it and put frankincense thereon
[1:21:16] and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons to
[1:21:19] priests and he shall take their out as
[1:21:21] handful of the flour thereof and of the
[1:21:24] oil thereof with all the frankincense
[1:21:26] thereof and the priests shall burn the
[1:21:28] memorial of it upon the altar to be an
[1:21:31] offering made by fire of a sweet savour
[1:21:33] unto the lord god bless you you can have
[1:21:36] your seats now I would encourage you
[1:21:41] sometime in the near future I would
[1:21:43] encourage you to sit down and read or
[1:21:48] listen to brother Branham speaking about
[1:21:50] Elijah and the meal offering and I trust
[1:21:54] today that maybe you'll be able to see
[1:21:56] some things and read between the lines
[1:21:58] because this this subject I have studied
[1:22:01] it intensely I have been like a
[1:22:04] supernatural detective I wanted to I
[1:22:07] wanted to glean every nugget out of what
[1:22:09] was being said here so first of all when
[1:22:12] the offering is said we're not going to
[1:22:14] read the whole chapter but I'll just
[1:22:16] give you the highlights when the meal
[1:22:18] offering had to come first of all had to
[1:22:21] be fine flour now brother random talks
[1:22:24] about a device they had back there he he
[1:22:26] called it a verb
[1:22:28] bu RR and brother branham mentions at 28
[1:22:31] times and a burr they could take that
[1:22:34] meal and they could grind that meal and
[1:22:36] every piece of meal came out exactly the
[1:22:40] same size so it had to be fine flour
[1:22:43] then the oil had to be put on it oil is
[1:22:46] nourishing and then there had to be
[1:22:49] frankincense added to it a little
[1:22:51] further on in the chapter
[1:22:53] we're told don't burn any leaven in
[1:22:56] there and don't burn any honey in there
[1:22:59] and make sure you add the salt into that
[1:23:03] offering so the fine flour the oil no
[1:23:07] leaven
[1:23:07] no honey frankincense and salt and so
[1:23:11] that this is this is laying out a
[1:23:13] pattern it's laying out something that's
[1:23:15] going to take place in the future
[1:23:17] you know Genesis it's a gene chapter
[1:23:20] everything that started in Genesis it's
[1:23:22] coming to harvest right here in
[1:23:24] Revelation and God has privileged you
[1:23:27] and I to live in the most exciting times
[1:23:30] a son or daughter of God has ever lived
[1:23:33] on this planet and the other thing is I
[1:23:36] can tell you right now with absolute
[1:23:39] certainty it is later than it has ever
[1:23:42] been before brother Branham said when he
[1:23:46] was here was three minutes to midnight I
[1:23:48] wonder how many seconds to midnight it
[1:23:50] might be so again we're laying down the
[1:23:53] pattern of that meal offering the fine
[1:23:56] flour the oil no eleven no honey
[1:24:00] frankincense and so now we can turn over
[1:24:03] to the book of first kings we're going
[1:24:08] to start reading at verse 16
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:16] first came 16 and we're going to start
[1:24:20] reading and find out a little bit about
[1:24:25] what happened just before Elijah showed
[1:24:28] up all right in chapter 16 verse 29 and
[1:24:35] in the 38 year as the king of Judah
[1:24:37] began they have the son only to reign
[1:24:40] over in Israel and they have the son of
[1:24:42] Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria 20
[1:24:46] and two years know first thing is this
[1:24:49] was an Israeli king not a pagan King but
[1:24:53] an Israeli King the king of Israel the
[1:24:56] king of God's people and they have the
[1:24:58] son of Omri did evil in the sight of the
[1:25:02] Lord above all that word before him
[1:25:07] that's sinking a have did evil in the
[1:25:11] sight of the Lord above all right that
[1:25:15] were before him and he came to pass as
[1:25:19] if it had been a light thing just a
[1:25:21] little thing for him to walk in the sins
[1:25:25] of Jeroboam the son of Nebat that he
[1:25:27] took to wife Jezebel of pagan right uh
[1:25:32] even the daughter of F Bale king of the
[1:25:36] cydonia --nz and went and served bail
[1:25:39] and worship
[1:25:40] you have a king of history of going
[1:25:43] marrying a pagan white and going to
[1:25:45] serve her pagan gods and he reared up an
[1:25:49] altar prevail in the House of bail and
[1:25:51] he built it in Samaria and a have made a
[1:25:55] grove and a have did more to provoke the
[1:26:00] Lord God of Israel to anger than all the
[1:26:04] kings of Israel that were before him so
[1:26:08] that lays a little foundation of what
[1:26:11] happened just before first King
[1:26:14] seventeen and Elijah the Tishbite who
[1:26:17] was in the happiness of Gilead said unto
[1:26:19] Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth
[1:26:22] before whom I stand there shall not be
[1:26:25] do nor rain these years but according to
[1:26:28] my word now we don't have a lot of
[1:26:30] history about Elijah he just showed up
[1:26:33] it just comes on the scene why because
[1:26:37] of sin because God's people were
[1:26:40] worshipping pagan idols and Elijah comes
[1:26:43] on the scene and he says as the Lord God
[1:26:46] liveth there's not going to be rain
[1:26:49] until I come now when when there's no
[1:26:53] rain friends there is a drought where
[1:26:56] there is a drought there is a famine
[1:26:58] where this famine there is hunger where
[1:27:01] there is hunger there starts coming
[1:27:03] insanity in the world we're seeing a
[1:27:06] little bit little traces
[1:27:08] friends of mine send me pictures of
[1:27:10] what's taking place in New York when
[1:27:12] their governor declared a state of
[1:27:14] emergency and said you might be out of
[1:27:16] work for six months you know what that
[1:27:19] did to people
[1:27:19] they headed out for the nearest door
[1:27:22] they emptied the chef's they were
[1:27:24] fighting in the streets the police had
[1:27:26] to be called people will walk you with
[1:27:28] their shopping baskets and other people
[1:27:30] are coming and grabbing things out of
[1:27:32] their shopping basket because of the
[1:27:34] fear of of no food and the word of the
[1:27:39] Lord came unto him saying get thee hence
[1:27:41] and turned the eastward and hide thyself
[1:27:44] by the brook Cherith that is before
[1:27:46] Jordan this is the quietest place in the
[1:27:50] whole country now you have to put on
[1:27:53] your spiritual thinking cap now I'll say
[1:27:55] your supernatural thinking cap to
[1:27:57] believe this next part all right and it
[1:28:01] shall be that thou shall drink of the
[1:28:03] brook and I have commanded the Ravens
[1:28:07] the birds write defeat thee and so he
[1:28:12] went and did according unto the word of
[1:28:13] the Lord for he went and dwelt by the
[1:28:15] brook Cherith did before Jordan and the
[1:28:17] Ravens brought a breaded flesh in the
[1:28:19] morning and bread and flesh and the
[1:28:21] evening and he drank of the brook now
[1:28:24] let me ask you friends what bakery did
[1:28:28] the birds get that bread from
[1:28:32] where'd they get the flesh and Elijah
[1:28:36] he's got room service every morning the
[1:28:39] birds show up with his breakfast
[1:28:42] everything the birds show up with the
[1:28:44] supper and for three years and six
[1:28:48] months Elijah is up there just having
[1:28:51] fellowship with God for the random sin
[1:28:54] God wanted three and a half years of
[1:28:56] constant fellowship with his God
[1:28:59] now in the meantime down in a halfs land
[1:29:03] famine is starting to strike and there
[1:29:07] is all points bulletin out for Elijah
[1:29:11] the king said you find that man find out
[1:29:14] where he's at everything was going fine
[1:29:17] in the country until that guy showed up
[1:29:20] get the military get the police get the
[1:29:24] SWAT team get everybody out there find
[1:29:27] that man and bring him here and so
[1:29:29] they're out there and they're looking
[1:29:31] and they're walking and no doubt with a
[1:29:33] lot not a lot of water and food their
[1:29:36] electrolytes maybe start going down and
[1:29:38] maybe they start moving a little bit
[1:29:40] slow and then they come they come to the
[1:29:42] play they come to the mountain there
[1:29:44] we're in the brook Cherith is up there
[1:29:46] and they know that's the driest place in
[1:29:50] the land there hasn't been any rain for
[1:29:52] three years there can't be anything out
[1:29:54] there and we're not going to take our
[1:29:56] energy and our strength we're not gonna
[1:29:58] waste it going up there
[1:30:00] and here's Elijah just having its
[1:30:02] revival just him and gun yeah driest
[1:30:05] place in the land why it is place in the
[1:30:09] land and Elijah and his god just haven't
[1:30:12] finished
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:20] so he went and did according unto the
[1:30:23] word of the Lord where he went and dwelt
[1:30:24] by the brook Cherith then the before
[1:30:26] Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread
[1:30:27] and flesh in the morning and bread and
[1:30:29] flesh in the evening and he drank of the
[1:30:31] proof and now it came to pass that the
[1:30:33] brook dried up because there had been no
[1:30:36] rain in the land and the word of the
[1:30:39] Lord came unto him saying arise
[1:30:42] get this error path which belongeth in
[1:30:44] Sidon and dwell there behold I have
[1:30:49] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[1:30:53] thee now at this time do you think the
[1:30:56] widow woman knew what was going to take
[1:30:59] place in her immediate future the answer
[1:31:02] is no she did not know so he arose and
[1:31:09] went to Sarah path and when he came to
[1:31:11] the city the gate of the city behold the
[1:31:13] widow woman was there gathering of
[1:31:15] sticks now like I told you I encourage
[1:31:18] you to read that message about Elijah
[1:31:24] and so I want to describe to you what
[1:31:28] was taking place there bubbles out there
[1:31:40] and it's discovering galaxies and it
[1:31:42] keeps on going it keeps on going it
[1:31:44] keeps on going but God has given to us a
[1:31:49] prophet scope and that prophet scope God
[1:31:53] can take that prophet scope and he could
[1:31:55] turn him back he could turn him sideways
[1:31:57] he can turn him whatever way he wants
[1:32:00] and we have confidence in that prophecy
[1:32:02] and so here's here's his his vision he
[1:32:06] went there and he saw this woman he said
[1:32:10] she was weary unable to sleep all night
[1:32:13] she was tossed about because of this
[1:32:15] great tragedy big tears dripping from
[1:32:18] her eyes this is not just a man's
[1:32:20] thoughts friends for many weeks
[1:32:24] she had only one meal every three or
[1:32:28] four days think about for many weeks one
[1:32:34] meal every three or four days her
[1:32:38] husband had been lost in the battle for
[1:32:40] the Horde he trusted God and gave his
[1:32:42] life for the cause of Israel her ragged
[1:32:45] nightgown was just about gone her
[1:32:49] sleeves were all ragged and her arms
[1:32:52] sticking out of them
[1:32:53] she lived decent and honorable and met
[1:32:56] all of God's requirements but still the
[1:32:59] Lord remains silent her shoulders were
[1:33:01] stupid as she sat in her rocking chair
[1:33:05] shedding big tears and looking at her
[1:33:08] starving baby her cheek bones sticking
[1:33:10] out her arms frail and she sat ringing
[1:33:14] her bony hands her bones were dwindling
[1:33:17] away as the flesh goes from them she
[1:33:21] knew that only a handful of meals stood
[1:33:23] between her and death and then he drops
[1:33:26] the sin she wasn't going to eat of the
[1:33:29] case she was going to make she was going
[1:33:32] to feed her little boy and put him in
[1:33:35] her arms and die
[1:33:37] all the while friends there is a
[1:33:39] prophecy out there that she's being
[1:33:42] prepared the day care of Elijah that
[1:33:45] when he comes now here's a little boy
[1:33:47] the little boy was three or four years
[1:33:49] old he was unable to sleep over twenty
[1:33:52] minutes at a time because of his hunger
[1:33:55] he had on a ragged nightshirt
[1:33:57] he had sinking cheeks his eyes were
[1:33:59] turning yellow and a prophet of God
[1:34:02] going there and looking and see seeing
[1:34:05] that and coming back to this to take the
[1:34:08] Bible and make the word live to us
[1:34:11] his eyes were turning yellow and he was
[1:34:13] holding his stomach as he asked his
[1:34:16] mother if she was ready to cook
[1:34:19] a little cake no this is not all in one
[1:34:22] message friends this is good brother
[1:34:24] branham love telling about elijah in
[1:34:27] this blue so it's wolf and all
[1:34:29] throughout the message then he talks
[1:34:32] about the conditions in the land the
[1:34:34] whole nation was starving and in a
[1:34:37] terrible condition
[1:34:39] the people in the city of centre path
[1:34:41] were starving to death screaming for
[1:34:45] water it was a reflection of sin and
[1:34:49] immorality as the woman looked down the
[1:34:51] street she heard the people cursing and
[1:34:54] carrying on I believe there's a lot of
[1:34:58] that going on right here in our time and
[1:35:01] think of what's going on in China and in
[1:35:04] France and Italy in Spain and all the
[1:35:07] countries that are being shut down you
[1:35:10] did the only thing open at some of those
[1:35:12] stores is the supermarket's and the
[1:35:15] pharmacies everything else restaurants
[1:35:18] closed bars closed thankful for that
[1:35:20] but every stores closed everything is
[1:35:23] shut down and the people are locked in
[1:35:26] they can't go out of their country
[1:35:28] nobody can come in their country it
[1:35:32] never felt or experienced anything like
[1:35:35] that before so now the the widow woman
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:42] the widow woman now she's there and
[1:35:45] she's got a couple of states that she is
[1:35:49] prepared and when he goes there he sees
[1:35:55] her carrying the sticks he says to her
[1:35:58] when he comes to her he says hey thanks
[1:36:02] me a drink of water I'm gonna go quick
[1:36:05] we just just hit that fetch me a drink
[1:36:07] of water yes now think about this water
[1:36:10] is the most precious commodity in that
[1:36:13] land and here a perfect stranger shows
[1:36:16] up
[1:36:17] Elijah walks into the vision he sees
[1:36:19] what God had showed him maybe he sees
[1:36:21] defense the house he said this is a
[1:36:23] place here's that widow woman and if she
[1:36:25] walks over give me a drink and the Bible
[1:36:29] says as she was going to fetch think of
[1:36:33] she was ready to obey the first part of
[1:36:37] the message and she was going and then
[1:36:40] he said Oh bake me a cake in my hand and
[1:36:45] bring it to me and that stopped her she
[1:36:49] said well I've only got a little bit of
[1:36:53] meal and a little bit of oil
[1:36:56] and I'm here gathering two sticks - six
[1:36:59] not three six not five six - six
[1:37:03] no she's gathering the two sticks that I
[1:37:05] may go in and prepare it for my son and
[1:37:09] die hopeless no future
[1:37:13] nothing since she had no ability to
[1:37:16] think of survival she knew she was at
[1:37:19] the end of her Road Eli just says bait
[1:37:26] me that came first right and thus saith
[1:37:31] the Lord your meal will never run out
[1:37:34] your oil will never
[1:37:36] now and she went and did it and she and
[1:37:39] her and her household didn't eat many
[1:37:41] day for the meal the oil never run out
[1:37:44] you know that first cake that she built
[1:37:47] I want you to lock this down in your
[1:37:49] heart front after that first cake that
[1:37:52] she baked and gave to Elijah every
[1:37:56] single cake after that it was a miracle
[1:37:59] cake everyone a miracle cake a miracle
[1:38:05] cake a miracle she knew there was
[1:38:08] nothing there she knew and she was ready
[1:38:11] to die God has saved us 1200 plus
[1:38:17] miracle case every message it's a
[1:38:21] miracle cake I've never read one of them
[1:38:24] that is not a masterpiece brother Brad
[1:38:31] spoke about Jesus in perfect faith he
[1:38:33] said but Jesus lived in a world that no
[1:38:36] one known about he was an odd person he
[1:38:38] lived in a world of perfect faith that a
[1:38:40] perfect God of which he was if we lived
[1:38:42] in a perfect faith of a Christian in
[1:38:44] what we are we'd be a mystic to the
[1:38:47] world the people wouldn't understand you
[1:38:49] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[1:38:51] said you would do what he forbid you'd
[1:38:53] not do and if people began to say you'd
[1:38:57] be a mystic I'd encourage you to go into
[1:39:02] the dictionary look up the word mystic
[1:39:05] identified myself the definition of a
[1:39:09] mystic is one who seeks after and
[1:39:12] attains direct intercourse with God now
[1:39:19] there's many around the world they think
[1:39:21] their mistakes in India in Africa in the
[1:39:25] Caribbean you got a lot of mystics you
[1:39:28] go around to some of these some of these
[1:39:30] gypsies over there and they hang out
[1:39:33] there come here we'll tell you a fortune
[1:39:35] they all think they're mystics and
[1:39:37] people are deluded by that you're a
[1:39:41] mystic for
[1:39:43] you're here for a purpose of the Bride
[1:39:46] of Christ is naturally spiritual
[1:39:48] normally supernatural you're
[1:39:51] super-sensitive to the supernatural
[1:39:54] that's a real world and God has given
[1:39:56] you entrance into that world brother
[1:39:59] have said no man seeks after God but
[1:40:01] once God finds us then he says now
[1:40:03] diligently search after me searching my
[1:40:06] word search for my life search for me
[1:40:09] and let my character be transformed into
[1:40:12] you let a metamorphose take place in
[1:40:15] your life right now in Luke chapter 4 or
[1:40:18] 14 we'll start reading about Jesus
[1:40:21] actually in verse 13 and when the devil
[1:40:24] had ended all the temptation he departed
[1:40:28] from him for a season four season and
[1:40:34] Jesus returned in the power of the
[1:40:37] Spirit unto Galilee and there went out a
[1:40:40] fame of him to all the regions above him
[1:40:44] they'd heard about the miracle they'd
[1:40:46] heard about him confounding the wise of
[1:40:49] all the religious leaders it was the
[1:40:52] buzz going on there everybody wanted to
[1:40:55] know everybody heard about this guy
[1:40:57] named Jesus verse 18
[1:41:06] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:41:10] been brought up home boy makes good home
[1:41:15] boy comes home all the natives have
[1:41:18] heard about him they watched him grow up
[1:41:20] they watched them they knew him and has
[1:41:24] this custom was he went into the
[1:41:26] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:41:28] up to read write and when there was
[1:41:33] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:41:35] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[1:41:37] the book he found the place where it is
[1:41:39] written he went to the specific verse he
[1:41:44] didn't read the whole book of Isaiah he
[1:41:47] wasn't he wasn't unsure he went right to
[1:41:50] this scripture the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:41:53] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[1:41:55] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:41:58] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:42:00] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:42:02] the recovering of sight to the blind and
[1:42:04] set at liberty them that are not to
[1:42:07] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:42:11] glorious worth wonderful words I'm sure
[1:42:14] those people especially the rabba they
[1:42:16] were very familiar with the scripture
[1:42:19] and and young Jesus comes there goes to
[1:42:22] the synagogue stands up and he reads it
[1:42:24] right now try to put yourself in this
[1:42:29] picture this great drama that's going on
[1:42:32] and he closed the book and he gave it to
[1:42:36] the minister and he sat down and the
[1:42:39] eyes of all a ll all them that were at
[1:42:45] the synagogue were fastened on him
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:52] that's what we've heard about and now
[1:42:53] now he's here yeah
[1:42:55] expectation anticipation and he reads
[1:42:59] description right and then he says this
[1:43:04] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:43:10] ears Messiah the one the one that
[1:43:16] hundreds of prophecies has been spoken
[1:43:18] about by Isaiah and Ezra in Ezekiel and
[1:43:22] Jeremiah hundreds of prophecy they're
[1:43:25] all saying Messiah is coming Messiah is
[1:43:27] coming Messiah is coming Messiah is
[1:43:29] coming and here he shows up and all
[1:43:36] there have witnessed and wondered at the
[1:43:39] gracious words which proceeded out of
[1:43:41] his mouth and they said is not this
[1:43:46] Joseph's son what's the answer no was it
[1:43:51] Joseph's son it was God's Son that's
[1:43:54] right and he said unto them you will
[1:43:57] surely send to me this proverb physician
[1:43:59] heal thyself whatsoever he had heard
[1:44:02] done in Capernaum do also hear in my
[1:44:04] country in other words he says you're
[1:44:06] waiting for a miracle you want to see
[1:44:09] some signs don't you he said verily I
[1:44:14] say unto you no prophet is accepted in
[1:44:20] his own country
[1:44:23] did America receive her prophet no
[1:44:29] millions followed brother Brendan great
[1:44:32] man has risen up a month since we've
[1:44:35] heard about him flocked to the meeting
[1:44:37] flocked to the stadium flocked to the
[1:44:39] racetracks around the world but then
[1:44:42] 1958 he preaches the seed of the serpent
[1:44:47] and identified many serpents and the
[1:44:51] Serpent's went away they all walked away
[1:44:55] brother Ram said don't try to feed
[1:44:58] Pentecostal baby up with denominational
[1:45:01] babies don't try to feed them
[1:45:03] supernatural things it's too rich for
[1:45:05] them it makes them sick at their stomach
[1:45:08] and this is what happened in Jesus day
[1:45:11] but I tell you the truth many widows
[1:45:13] were in Israel now he comes right - he
[1:45:16] picks from Leviticus then he goes to
[1:45:18] first kings and a little with a woman
[1:45:20] many widows were in Israel in the days
[1:45:23] of Elias
[1:45:24] when the heaven was shut up three years
[1:45:27] and six months we know exactly how long
[1:45:30] there was no rain and a great famine was
[1:45:34] throughout all the land all right but
[1:45:38] unto none of them was Elias sent unto
[1:45:41] Sarepta a city of Sidon unto a woman
[1:45:45] that was a widow right her husband was
[1:45:49] dead he is served in the army he was a
[1:45:52] Gentile warrior he died and now a widow
[1:45:54] is left then he finishes and many lepers
[1:45:58] were in Israel in the time of Elias to
[1:46:01] profit and
[1:46:02] them was cleansed saving naman the
[1:46:07] Syrian right now what's what's the
[1:46:10] response and all whatever you see all
[1:46:16] think about all all they in the
[1:46:20] synagogue which when they heard these
[1:46:24] words were filled with wrath Oh anger
[1:46:31] outraged who does he think he is taking
[1:46:39] the holy book of Isaiah and say that
[1:46:42] that scripture has been fulfilled right
[1:46:45] here in our synagogue and they rose up
[1:46:50] and they thrust him out of the city and
[1:46:54] led him under the brow of the hill where
[1:46:58] in their city was built that they might
[1:47:01] cast him down headlong that's how they
[1:47:06] reacted when the prophet Jesus showed up
[1:47:10] they wanted to kill him but he passing
[1:47:17] through the midst of them went his way
[1:47:19] he just walked past them bye-bye
[1:47:24] they didn't know what happened to him
[1:47:26] but I'm sure that they were angry and
[1:47:29] full of wrath and outrage for long time
[1:47:32] after that so then we can turn over to
[1:47:35] Matthew we're going to read Matthew
[1:47:52] I love the word when it comes alive and
[1:47:55] our brother Bram says do you like to
[1:47:58] read between the lines between the lines
[1:48:03] do you know this message the message
[1:48:06] that we know come from God out of the
[1:48:10] 6.7 billion going on to seven pretty
[1:48:13] well eight billion in the next probably
[1:48:15] 20 years 99.99% of the people in the
[1:48:22] world have never heard this message and
[1:48:26] I could I could probably add another
[1:48:28] nine on that but I don't want to over
[1:48:30] estimate you say oh how can that be well
[1:48:33] in China 1.5 billion people Christian it
[1:48:37] just regular Christianity
[1:48:38] it's just a minut percentage of the
[1:48:42] population not talking about message
[1:48:44] Christianity in India 1.5 billion people
[1:48:48] Christianity a little tiny group of
[1:48:52] Christians the rest of our Hindus and
[1:48:54] Buddhists and Muslims so we said well
[1:48:57] brother a 99.99 I don't believe it that
[1:49:01] that this is that doesn't sound possible
[1:49:03] yeah it's true
[1:49:05] you take the six billion people in the
[1:49:08] world and 99.99% have never heard this
[1:49:13] message and you know talk about
[1:49:15] responsibility I know that I may be the
[1:49:17] only son or daughter of God that many
[1:49:20] people ever come eyeball-to-eyeball with
[1:49:22] you may be the only opportunity that
[1:49:25] person has to hear about this great
[1:49:28] supernatural opportunity that God has
[1:49:30] placed in front of us so Matthew 27 in
[1:49:37] verse 26 I'm gonna read this real quick
[1:49:39] you know I can read fast I came from
[1:49:41] Providence which is right between Boston
[1:49:43] and New York I know how to read fast and
[1:49:45] I want to preserve time so they released
[1:49:48] he Barabbas unto them and when he had
[1:49:50] scourged him he delivered him to be
[1:49:53] crucified so the first thing they do is
[1:49:55] they they scourge him they get
[1:49:58] 39 lashes and those people Roman
[1:50:02] soldiers they were masters of torture
[1:50:04] they had to be they called them a
[1:50:05] Lichter and it was a strap with LED
[1:50:08] balls at the end of it and little shops
[1:50:10] Radz and they would take that whip and
[1:50:12] they'd crack that whip and they would
[1:50:14] pull it back and the flesh and the blood
[1:50:16] it would just pour out of these people
[1:50:19] so the first thing they did was they
[1:50:21] gave them 39 lashes then the soldiers of
[1:50:26] the governor took Jesus into the common
[1:50:28] Hall and gathered unto them here's
[1:50:31] another word the whole band of soldiers
[1:50:35] not just one not a couple the whole band
[1:50:38] of soldiers surround Jesus and they
[1:50:44] stripped them and put on a scarlet robe
[1:50:47] and when they had planted a crown of
[1:50:50] thorns they put it upon his head and the
[1:50:52] reed in his right hand and they bowed
[1:50:55] the knee before him and mocked him
[1:50:57] saying hail King of the Jews and they
[1:51:00] spit upon him and it took the reed and
[1:51:03] smote him in the head and after they had
[1:51:06] mocked him they took the robe off from
[1:51:08] him and put on his own garment to him
[1:51:10] and led him away to crucify in other
[1:51:12] words they tortured him they beat him
[1:51:16] they spit upon him they ripped his beard
[1:51:18] out of his faith they kicked them put
[1:51:21] that rag around his head and walked
[1:51:22] around sucker-punched him okay bang tell
[1:51:25] us who that bang who hits you that time
[1:51:27] bang the whole band of soldiers they
[1:51:31] were going to make an example out of
[1:51:33] this man Rome was going to make an
[1:51:36] example of anybody that would come
[1:51:38] against Rome the Jews were going to make
[1:51:40] an example he was going to be brutalized
[1:51:44] tortured beyond anything that we can
[1:51:47] imagine even Herod and Pilate that hated
[1:51:50] each other they came together around the
[1:51:54] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and then of
[1:52:00] course Simon of Cyrene comes and and
[1:52:03] when they had come under place called
[1:52:05] Golgotha that is to say the place
[1:52:07] skull they gave him vinegar to drink and
[1:52:10] mingle with golf and when he had tasted
[1:52:12] thereof he would not drink there they
[1:52:16] crucified him and part of his garments
[1:52:18] casting Lots that it might be filled
[1:52:20] which was spoken in the word they parted
[1:52:23] my garments among them and upon my
[1:52:25] vesture did they cast lots and sitting
[1:52:29] down they watched him there you know
[1:52:35] like I said these these Roman soldiers
[1:52:37] they would desensitize to torture and
[1:52:41] brutality it was an everyday thing for
[1:52:44] them
[1:52:45] crucifixion public execution they did it
[1:52:48] all the time when they took the
[1:52:50] murderers and the robbers and they took
[1:52:52] them there no doubt many of them
[1:52:54] demon-possessed you know demon-possessed
[1:52:56] people they possessed sometimes four or
[1:52:58] five the normal strength of a human
[1:53:00] being and these people are getting ready
[1:53:02] to be killed
[1:53:03] knowing the torture that's ahead of them
[1:53:04] no doubt they're screaming picture in
[1:53:07] your mind how they're mocking and
[1:53:08] cursing and begging and pleading you
[1:53:10] know to be spared from death nobody
[1:53:13] wants to die especially that way and
[1:53:15] those soldiers maybe had to have three
[1:53:17] or four of them pulled down the arm
[1:53:19] until they dealt with that arm and hold
[1:53:21] down the other arm and hold the feet
[1:53:23] down all the while it's like a nightmare
[1:53:25] experience is going on for this person
[1:53:28] that's getting ready to be crucified the
[1:53:30] Roman soldiers didn't care they didn't
[1:53:33] laughed about it it was exercise they
[1:53:35] enjoyed it these people they were
[1:53:37] crucified they were lower than dogs they
[1:53:40] were like the exterminator the Orkin man
[1:53:42] going out there and just exterminating
[1:53:44] all these people so now they never saw
[1:53:49] one like Jesus Jesus in Leviticus we had
[1:53:55] to have the fine flour
[1:53:57] Jesus was the bread of life that came
[1:54:00] down from heaven and the oil the
[1:54:04] anointing of God was on this vessel so
[1:54:08] he had the word and the spirit and you
[1:54:10] mix the word and the spirit and then no
[1:54:15] leaven jesus said beware the
[1:54:17] of the pharisee don't put any leaven in
[1:54:20] here and maybe you've got some leaven
[1:54:23] that maybe needs to be purged out of
[1:54:25] your life maybe maybe the leaven of
[1:54:28] sports or music or business or some kind
[1:54:30] of a habit or any anything that's less
[1:54:33] anything that you've got above your
[1:54:35] priority with God it is Lenin and the
[1:54:38] Bible says no leaven strip out the
[1:54:41] leaven and don't put any honey in there
[1:54:44] because when he is applied to honey
[1:54:47] it gets sour and so we don't want to be
[1:54:50] honey Christian we don't want to walk
[1:54:51] around well you know praise the Lord
[1:54:53] glory to God yeah everything's fine you
[1:54:56] don't want to be one of those people
[1:54:58] Jesus was a real man of God you need to
[1:55:01] be a real son or daughter of God with a
[1:55:03] revelation in your heart happy holy
[1:55:06] humble serious nothing artificial in you
[1:55:09] nothing phony nothin put-on no no
[1:55:12] make-believe friends God's given to us
[1:55:16] you need stand you can stand knowing
[1:55:18] that you are a supernatural entity here
[1:55:22] on this earth with a mission from God
[1:55:25] there has been a divine incarnation in
[1:55:28] the life of a real believer in this
[1:55:31] message I hope that's you I hope what's
[1:55:33] happened already if it hasn't happened I
[1:55:36] pray that it will happen so now no
[1:55:39] leaven and no honey and there had to be
[1:55:42] salt because salt was a preservative it
[1:55:45] made sure that at the meal it didn't go
[1:55:48] bad now Jesus he's the bread of life
[1:55:50] that comes down from heaven the oil is
[1:55:53] upon him he said no leaven no honey and
[1:55:57] salt salt as a preservative and Jesus
[1:56:02] had the preservative he could fulfill
[1:56:05] his mission the crucifixion that was the
[1:56:09] crowning glory of Jesus life public
[1:56:13] execution that was the squeeze for him
[1:56:17] even in the garden of gethsemane he felt
[1:56:19] that squeeze yeah if it's possible let
[1:56:22] this depart from me but nevertheless not
[1:56:25] my will but thine be done so the salt
[1:56:29] was there that preservative was there
[1:56:31] and then like the little water woman
[1:56:33] gathering the two sticks when Jesus went
[1:56:36] there he laid on the cross and he
[1:56:39] stretched out his hands and he waited
[1:56:41] for the nails to come those soldiers had
[1:56:44] never seen anything like that before
[1:56:46] they never saw a lamb come to the club
[1:56:49] and just lay down and surrender his life
[1:56:52] and then they crucified him now in
[1:56:56] Leviticus were told there's four ways
[1:56:58] that you can prepare this meal offering
[1:57:01] number one on the altar number two in
[1:57:04] the oven number three in the frying pan
[1:57:06] or number four in the pan now sometimes
[1:57:10] you go through a trial it's known only
[1:57:12] to you and God that's like an altar
[1:57:16] experience you go through something just
[1:57:18] you and God you deal with then sometimes
[1:57:20] it goes like it gets a little bit hotter
[1:57:23] and the of it's like an oven experience
[1:57:25] and you know maybe against you maybe
[1:57:27] your family maybe a pastor
[1:57:29] maybe only a few know this Greek trial
[1:57:32] maybe in your body maybe in your
[1:57:34] finances maybe in your family but it's
[1:57:36] an oven experience and you couldn't see
[1:57:39] you couldn't see the effects of the heat
[1:57:40] and the other night then but the effect
[1:57:42] of the heat it was having an effect on
[1:57:44] that meal then it can go to the pan now
[1:57:49] in the pan you can pretty much see you
[1:57:52] know that thing it's starting to get
[1:57:53] heat up so maybe your trial is not a
[1:57:56] halter trial or other trials maybe
[1:57:59] you're in the pen but Jesus was in the
[1:58:06] frying pan experience it's like a piece
[1:58:09] of bacon you put a piece of bacon on the
[1:58:11] frying pan and put the heat up and it
[1:58:13] starts bubbling you can see the effects
[1:58:16] that he's having on that piece of meat
[1:58:18] down there and Jesus he was in the
[1:58:21] frying pan experience he was the meal
[1:58:24] offering anointing with oil no leaven no
[1:58:27] honey and he had the salt to preserve
[1:58:29] him the other ingredient the meal
[1:58:35] offering it was frankincense
[1:58:38] frankincense was the most costly and the
[1:58:42] most fragrant perfume they had in those
[1:58:45] days and the secret of frankincense it
[1:58:48] did not release its aroma until he was a
[1:58:52] bride and so Jesus had he was
[1:58:56] frankincense the hotter his trial gut
[1:58:59] the sweeter the sweet of the aroma came
[1:59:02] and he just he just there but before the
[1:59:05] world the Lamb of God slain for all
[1:59:08] those who had lived and died before that
[1:59:11] that were in God's mind all those that
[1:59:14] were in the future it was a finished
[1:59:16] work now now the Bible said there were
[1:59:20] two thieves crucified with him they were
[1:59:22] thieves they were getting what they
[1:59:24] deserve and some people think well there
[1:59:28] was a good thief and a bad teeth don't
[1:59:31] they were both these I just want to read
[1:59:38] that to you and when they had come into
[1:59:43] the place called Golgotha that is the
[1:59:45] place of a skull they gave him vinegar
[1:59:48] to drink mingle with oil where he had
[1:59:50] tasted thereof you would not drink and
[1:59:52] they crucified Him and part of this
[1:59:53] garments casting Lots then it might be
[1:59:55] filled which was spoken of by the
[1:59:57] Prophet so even on the cross prophecy is
[2:00:00] being fulfilled on the cross and sitting
[2:00:06] down they watched him think of the scene
[2:00:09] people sitting around looking at
[2:00:12] somebody
[2:00:13] in agony could hardly even her he was so
[2:00:16] brutalized the body was so wounded and
[2:00:19] beaten and cut blue probably swollen
[2:00:22] face swollen black and blue and they put
[2:00:30] over his head as accusation worse this
[2:00:32] is Jesus cannon Jews then were the two
[2:00:35] thieves crucified with him one on the
[2:00:37] right and one on the left and they that
[2:00:40] passed by reviled him wagging their head
[2:00:44] so it was like a it was like a a circus
[2:00:47] it was just there and the people walking
[2:00:48] by them know it's wagging their heads
[2:00:53] here's their own God and saying thou
[2:00:59] that destroys the temple and buildest it
[2:01:02] in three days save thyself so they're
[2:01:05] putting the the misconception of what
[2:01:07] Jesus said they're casting that oh you
[2:01:10] said you can build a temple and three
[2:01:12] day go ahead if thou be the Son of God
[2:01:16] come down from the cross likewise also
[2:01:21] the chief priest the chief priests
[2:01:25] mocking him right there at the cross
[2:01:27] high priest all decked out beards just
[2:01:32] right
[2:01:33] robes just wrapped around them walking
[2:01:38] around holy man so call looking at their
[2:01:42] Messiah
[2:01:52] the thieves also which were crucified
[2:01:56] with him cast the same in his teeth both
[2:02:01] of them
[2:02:02] cursing mocking at their fellow one that
[2:02:07] was being crucified with them both of
[2:02:10] them but something happened friends I
[2:02:17] but this is my own thought now he runner
[2:02:20] by brother Jack
[2:02:21] I believe that thief on the right was
[2:02:25] the first one that experienced the third
[2:02:29] pull of Jesus ministry he never saw sign
[2:02:33] he never saw miracle he never saw all
[2:02:36] the all as he saw was this man suffering
[2:02:40] next to him being executed ready to die
[2:02:43] and something happened to that thief and
[2:02:45] he said he said remember me when you
[2:02:48] come into your kingdom remember he was
[2:02:52] mocking he was mocking and he was
[2:02:54] transformed on the cross by the life
[2:02:57] that he saw and the atmosphere and the
[2:03:00] anointing and revelation came and Jesus
[2:03:03] said this day you will be with me in
[2:03:08] paradise never got baptized never went
[2:03:14] through the sanctification
[2:03:16] never went through all that but he was
[2:03:19] there in paradise here you are getting
[2:03:24] two now from the sixth hour there was
[2:03:26] darkness over all the land unto the
[2:03:27] ninth hour and about the ninth hour
[2:03:29] Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli
[2:03:32] Eli lama sabachthani that is to say my
[2:03:35] God my God why has thou forsaken me some
[2:03:38] of them that stood there when they heard
[2:03:40] that saying this man called for Elias
[2:03:42] and straightaway one of them ran and
[2:03:44] took a sponge and filled it with vinegar
[2:03:47] and put it on a reed and gave him the
[2:03:49] drink the rest said let be areas
[2:03:53] screaming let me
[2:03:55] don't give him any relief let us see
[2:04:01] whether Elias will come to save him and
[2:04:04] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[2:04:07] loud voice yielded up the ghost
[2:04:11] he died from grief died from a broken
[2:04:15] heart yes here's something you'll never
[2:04:21] get the true revelation of a prophet of
[2:04:23] God's insight and behold the veil of the
[2:04:28] temple was rent in twain from the top to
[2:04:30] the bottom and the earth did quake and
[2:04:32] the rocks rent over at the temple that
[2:04:35] veil that was there at the holy place
[2:04:37] that God supernaturally split that thing
[2:04:40] at a time of Jesus crucifixion you know
[2:04:44] what they did they just went replaced it
[2:04:46] see they got a new one or they sewed it
[2:04:49] up that had no idea why that happened no
[2:04:54] dumb desensitizing frozen immobilized
[2:04:59] paralysed the truth sitting right in
[2:05:01] front being crucified right in front of
[2:05:04] them and the grace were open you'll
[2:05:11] never hear this one friends and many
[2:05:13] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[2:05:16] the Old Testament Saints arose and came
[2:05:21] out of the graves after his resurrection
[2:05:24] and went into the holy city and appeared
[2:05:27] on the many now taking out my profits
[2:05:29] coke now my profits cope said that when
[2:05:32] those Old Testament Saints came up
[2:05:35] Abraham and Sarah walked over there
[2:05:37] and they said well Lord would it be okay
[2:05:40] if we took a whistle-stop tour around
[2:05:42] Jerusalem and see how how things have
[2:05:45] changed since we've been there and she
[2:05:47] goes no it's okay we're gonna be here
[2:05:49] for 40 days you just go ahead
[2:05:51] so Abraham and Sarah they just walking
[2:05:53] around Jerusalem revealed walking around
[2:05:57] and they could appear and disappear just
[2:06:01] like Jesus so Jesus fulfilled it started
[2:06:07] in Leviticus fine flour the oil no
[2:06:12] leaven
[2:06:13] no honey salt frankincense two sticks
[2:06:16] Jesus comes he's the bread of life come
[2:06:19] down from heaven anointed with the Holy
[2:06:22] Ghost strip out all the unbelief strip
[2:06:25] out all the leather don't be in make
[2:06:27] believe it don't be a put on don't put
[2:06:29] any honey in there and make sure this
[2:06:31] salt Colossians says let your speech be
[2:06:34] always with grace seasoned with salt
[2:06:37] that you may know how to answer every
[2:06:41] man and then while Jesus was was being
[2:06:46] sacrificed not on the altar not in the
[2:06:50] oven not in the pan but on the frying
[2:06:53] pan there hotter that trial gut the more
[2:06:57] brutality the more those people cast it
[2:06:59] in his teeth the sweeter that
[2:07:01] frankincense God that he brought it up
[2:07:05] and that frankincense has been a balm
[2:07:07] that has for 2,000 years has been the
[2:07:11] anointing and the sweetness of the Holy
[2:07:13] Ghost being made manifest in real sons
[2:07:16] and daughters of God so now I'm coming
[2:07:20] down to you and me right here right here
[2:07:26] this is my meal right here your body
[2:07:32] your body that's your meal and Hebrews
[2:07:35] 13:8 said Jesus Christ the same
[2:07:38] yesterday today and forever and so our
[2:07:42] lives have got to be patterned after
[2:07:44] that your body your life and that body
[2:07:47] has got to be anointed with the oil of
[2:07:50] the Holy Ghost it comes in and then the
[2:07:53] stripping comes I call it the stripping
[2:07:56] before the equipping and there's gotta
[2:07:59] be it's gotta be that leaven is gonna
[2:08:02] come out o all the popularity all the
[2:08:05] beauty all the stars all the heroes by
[2:08:08] everything in your life that you put
[2:08:11] before God it's gotta be riff die and
[2:08:13] you become a real son of God
[2:08:15] no honey in there and then the salt has
[2:08:19] got to be applied
[2:08:20] unfortunately friends there's many that
[2:08:22] we have known through the years I've
[2:08:24] known many of them walked in this
[2:08:26] message for 30 years and they did not
[2:08:28] have the salt he that endures until the
[2:08:32] end the same shall be saved and they
[2:08:35] don't lack the salt and they went out
[2:08:37] and are fighting against God fighting
[2:08:40] against truth trampling the blood of
[2:08:43] Jesus Christ under their feet and not
[2:08:45] even know it as I said Friday night when
[2:08:48] the revelation this message comes it
[2:08:50] comes supernaturally and I seen it leave
[2:08:53] and when it leaves somebody at least
[2:08:55] supernaturally the man that I used to
[2:08:58] know the man that I heard preached for
[2:09:00] thirty years he's not there anymore not
[2:09:04] there all the knowledge all the
[2:09:06] experience all the so-called revelation
[2:09:09] and all the messages he create all the
[2:09:11] places he went all all the power and
[2:09:15] influence he had over people it's gone
[2:09:17] it's gone brother Branham said in the
[2:09:20] last things and things have Ananias and
[2:09:22] Sapphira would return and I don't doubt
[2:09:25] we're gonna have people drop over dead
[2:09:27] but when I look at these people I have a
[2:09:29] look right in their eyes and God spoke
[2:09:31] to me you are looking at Ananias right
[2:09:34] now dead dead while he's walking dead
[2:09:39] while he's talk we're just going back to
[2:09:41] Jesus we're just going back to the Bible
[2:09:42] well
[2:09:44] three is enough ever been you we just
[2:09:46] got a love everybody blind miserable
[2:09:51] wretched that's right poor and naked so
[2:09:55] now you identify here here your life
[2:09:58] into the meal offering Romans twelve
[2:10:01] says I beseech you therefore by the
[2:10:04] mercies of God that you present your
[2:10:07] body a living sacrifice a living center
[2:10:13] a lively sacrifice energized
[2:10:16] supercharged Electrify preach and
[2:10:26] sometimes I feel like I'm in the Land of
[2:10:28] Nod I would hate to say it but sometimes
[2:10:35] it feels like I'm speaking to the chosen
[2:10:37] frozen so now how about your trial now
[2:10:44] because every son and daughter of God is
[2:10:47] gonna be tested and maybe right now
[2:10:51] maybe right now you are in a alter
[2:10:55] experience a challenge in your life
[2:10:58] ultra challenge and maybe just you and
[2:11:01] God
[2:11:01] maybe you're wrestling it out just you
[2:11:03] in the Lord and sometimes it gets a
[2:11:06] little bit hotter and it gets a little
[2:11:08] bit bigger maybe your body gets
[2:11:10] challenged or your family get anything
[2:11:12] that happens and the trial gets bigger
[2:11:15] that's the oven oven trial and then
[2:11:19] maybe it gets real bad maybe some of
[2:11:21] your children maybe you backslide maybe
[2:11:23] your children back sir maybe they get in
[2:11:25] trouble with the law something bad
[2:11:27] happens and that's like a pain
[2:11:29] experience everybody in the church knows
[2:11:32] about your whole family knows about
[2:11:36] keeps coming then sometimes your trial

[2:13:06] spirit of fear power
[2:13:09] so much network power comes from the
[2:13:12] Greek word Dunamis you shall receive
[2:13:14] power dynamite the message came to take
[2:13:22] the fear off for the people here you are

[2:14:07] have been arrested for taking the gospel
[2:14:10] to their people our pastor was arrested
[2:14:13] a bunch of people from our church in
[2:14:15] China all arrested for taking the gospel
[2:14:18] to the communist nation so now you're in
[2:14:22] that trial that frying pan experience
[2:14:25] hotter than you've ever had it before
[2:14:27] and what has to happen you're a living
[2:14:30] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God and
[2:14:33] the frankincense kicks in all the heart
[2:14:37] of that tribe yes the closer you draw to
[2:14:39] God the more you depend upon him the
[2:14:42] more takes you listen to you the more
[2:14:44] you pray the more you're encouraged by
[2:14:47] the other people Saints here you are
[2:14:49] boiling away
[2:14:50] the frankincense comes out the sweetness
[2:14:54] sweetness of the Holy Ghost comes out
[2:14:56] you're in the inner inner chamber in the
[2:15:00] Holy of Holies brothers do you like to
[2:15:02] be with somebody who's been in that holy
[2:15:04] of holies and they come
[2:15:05] and there's just something about it I
[2:15:07] appreciate brother Jack for giving me
[2:15:10] the ability to stay home on a Saturday
[2:15:12] night and study because a lot of times
[2:15:14] I've been dragged out all day Saturday
[2:15:17] and they want to show me this attraction
[2:15:18] and dismounted and this old they want to
[2:15:21] drag me up my brother Jack man of God
[2:15:24] understand I stay home on Saturday
[2:15:26] raised a little brother-brother bread
[2:15:29] said a man should dwell alone before
[2:15:32] they come to this point find a thing
[2:15:36] that final thing I want to drop that I
[2:15:38] want to reach something to you we have
[2:15:42] oftentimes thought about Mary and little
[2:15:47] girl 15 years old
[2:15:50] an innocent humble country girl a virgin
[2:15:55] and the angel
[2:15:57] kinder all right and the angel tells her
[2:16:01] of God's plan
[2:16:02] she said be done to me according to thy
[2:16:06] word does she received it you know that
[2:16:11] little innocent 15 year old humble
[2:16:14] country girl she had to go to her fiance
[2:16:16] yeah she had to say Joseph I still love
[2:16:20] you all right I still want to marry you
[2:16:22] but I'm gonna have a baby right and it's
[2:16:27] not gonna be your baby
[2:16:30] now Joseph did the Bible says being a
[2:16:33] good man he wanted to put her away
[2:16:35] Friday and the angel comes to Joseph and
[2:16:40] tells dose of the plan and Joseph's on
[2:16:43] board so we thought about those things
[2:16:46] many I encourage you to think about
[2:16:48] those things deeply
[2:16:49] and think about how Mary had to go to
[2:16:52] her mom said mom guess what you know I'm
[2:16:56] gonna get married but I'm already with
[2:16:59] child yeah think about how mom and dad
[2:17:02] received anybody here had a daughter 15
[2:17:05] years old you could imagine you had
[2:17:08] three of them could you imagine one of
[2:17:09] the 15 years old say daddy I gotta tell
[2:17:13] you something
[2:17:14] no you better you better sit down for
[2:17:16] this you might better take anti-anxiety
[2:17:22] pill keep your clothes fine because I'm
[2:17:25] gonna drop it on a bomb and Joseph he
[2:17:35] had to tell his mom and dad they were
[2:17:38] you know we're getting married and
[2:17:40] you're looking forward to one day being
[2:17:42] grandparents and a babies on the way but
[2:17:46] it's not mine what there's a real people
[2:17:52] it was a real little girl and a real man
[2:17:56] and a real mom and dad and maybe they
[2:17:59] had brothers and sisters and aunts and
[2:18:01] uncles and cousins and they had all the
[2:18:03] people and everybody they bore the
[2:18:07] scandal Joseph and Mary were scandalized
[2:18:10] the rest of the world didn't understand
[2:18:14] that's too supernatural for them and
[2:18:16] when Jesus came he was scandalized he
[2:18:19] had the bear that we proved everywhere
[2:18:21] that family was there they are there's
[2:18:23] that girl probably impregnated by some
[2:18:26] Roman changer he's an illegitimate child
[2:18:29] back in those days of you or
[2:18:31] illegitimate child that was a scar on
[2:18:36] your life and the people around pretty
[2:18:43] heavy-duty isms that God would come to a
[2:18:46] virgin and she would conceive
[2:18:49] supernaturally and her husband had to
[2:18:52] have angel come to him and they bore the
[2:18:56] shame the scandal the reproach their
[2:18:59] whole life and Jesus became that sin
[2:19:04] offer he became the meat offering but
[2:19:07] now here's where I want to finish
[2:19:10] speaking about the word I kind of read
[2:19:11] something to you
[2:19:12] a gift that God gave to me I want to
[2:19:14] share it with you but here's the bottle
[2:19:18] for you for this day the very thing
[2:19:22] thing that happened to Mary happen to me
[2:19:26] has happened to brother Jack has
[2:19:29] happened to all the brothers and sisters
[2:19:32] here that believe this message you have
[2:19:34] been supernaturally impregnated with God
[2:19:38] see you bury the work you'll walk me
[2:19:42] around you've got a higher form of the
[2:19:44] word in you you're not a regulated word
[2:19:47] thus saith the Lord you've got a
[2:19:49] vindicating word you're getting ready to
[2:19:51] walk into eternity and you must be the
[2:19:57] living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[2:20:02] God for this day that scripture 1st
[2:20:06] Thessalonians 4 1st Thessalonians 4
[2:20:14] remember what happened when Jesus was on
[2:20:16] the cross and he cried with a loud voice
[2:20:19] and yielded up to go and the dead came
[2:20:23] out of the graves after his resurrection
[2:20:25] Paul speaking
[2:20:44] this is this is your body
[2:20:47] Paul says but I would not have you to be
[2:20:49] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[2:20:51] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[2:20:54] others which have no hope for if we
[2:20:56] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[2:20:57] even so them which are asleep in Jesus
[2:21:01] will God bring with him for this we say
[2:21:06] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[2:21:09] which are alive and remain under the
[2:21:10] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[2:21:13] them which are asleep for the Lord
[2:21:15] himself shall rise descend from heaven
[2:21:19] with a shout with the voice of the
[2:21:21] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[2:21:23] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[2:21:25] we which are alive and remain shall be
[2:21:29] caught up together with them in the
[2:21:30] clouds to meet the Lord so shall we ever
[2:21:34] be with the Lord and if Paul drops us in
[2:21:36] wherefore comfort one another with these
[2:21:42] words
[2:21:45] when Jesus when the meal offering that
[2:21:49] on the cross became the sacrifice that's
[2:21:53] when the dead in Christ came out in this
[2:21:56] day when the Bride of Christ becomes
[2:22:00] that living sacrifice the widow woman's
[2:22:04] secret to her success was her
[2:22:06] willingness to sustain Elijah to sustain
[2:22:11] the word and her meal never ran out her
[2:22:14] oil never ran out and so tonight you and
[2:22:18] I we are that little widow woman yeah
[2:22:21] talk about that when a woman had
[2:22:24] problems before I came to this message I
[2:22:27] hope you don't mind this but I was a
[2:22:29] walking talking spiritual skeleton
[2:22:32] walking down the road I had no meat on
[2:22:35] my bones
[2:22:35] I didn't have any muscle I had a I was a
[2:22:39] Catholic I had Baptist at PCL UPC
[2:22:42] assembly at all it was
[2:22:45] nourishing it didn't put any revelation
[2:22:48] on but God allowed that light to keep on
[2:22:53] coming and keep on coming and keep on
[2:22:55] coming and keep on coming and moving and
[2:22:58] when that came it changed everything
[2:23:01] here here's what had happened to me I
[2:23:04] can I can nail it right down to the day
[2:23:06] and the hour it happened to me I was
[2:23:08] listening to a discernment line and I
[2:23:11] said brother Jack one of her brothers
[2:23:13] are used to work for me he went all
[2:23:15] through the message they put together
[2:23:16] about seven hours of discernment just
[2:23:19] brother Brennan in the discernment line
[2:23:20] telling people who what when where why
[2:23:24] I'm sitting there and brother Branham
[2:23:26] said now sister I don't know you and you
[2:23:30] don't know me but there is one here who
[2:23:33] does know you and he does know me said
[2:23:37] now when he and his spirit comes in me
[2:23:44] and my spirit goes away and he gives me
[2:23:50] a temporarily resurrection by my spirit
[2:23:54] and he wants to use my body and I'm so
[2:23:58] happy to load it
[2:24:00] [Applause]
[2:24:03] I understood then hey son of man
[2:24:08] revealing the son of man I never got my
[2:24:13] eyes on a man I love the Prophet I love
[2:24:16] the office of a problem I love what he
[2:24:18] brought I love him with all my heart but
[2:24:21] it was Jesus Christ
[2:24:23] that was the continual fixation of my
[2:24:25] life and it was Jesus Christ speaking
[2:24:27] through a prophet in this day like he
[2:24:30] did with Moses like he did with Isaiah
[2:24:32] like he did with the season and no
[2:24:37] generation has ever had the voice of
[2:24:40] their prophet recorded recorded they
[2:24:46] couldn't even read back in those days
[2:24:47] brother Jack they had they stand there
[2:24:50] and the high priest wouldn't read it to
[2:24:52] him they said for our they sit there
[2:24:54] couldn't read illiterate this is my
[2:25:04] electronic highway to heaven I'm never
[2:25:13] bored I'm never lonely I am being
[2:25:16] supernaturally entertained

[2:25:27] this it will be their electronic highway
[2:25:30] to hell talk about the gift of God you
[2:25:36] know I'm all done all done preaching
[2:25:38] with me a gift God gave to me when I was
[2:25:40] traveling one time and a lot of times

[2:25:45] sometimes you go to these you travel the
[2:25:47] plates into 24 hours from the time you

[2:25:52] so you get a lot of time on your hand
[2:25:54] and run the brown room he had a little
[2:25:57] truck you might have seen it so I
[2:26:03] decided to do that and I was thinking if
[2:26:08] it wasn't for this message and I hope
[2:26:11] this locks down on you if it wasn't for
[2:26:14] this message and I wrote down how would
[2:26:17] I know that was my topic so here's all
[2:26:20] the things that I wanted to know except
[2:26:23] for the message I wouldn't know that it

[2:26:26] wouldn't know that Abraham and Sarah
[2:26:28] would change back to a young man and the
[2:26:30] young woman I would know that King Saul

[2:31:36] my friends brothers and sisters I want

[2:31:42] just want you just to just meditate for
[2:31:46] a moment maybe the musicians can come
[2:31:49] just meditate on a moment of who you are
[2:31:54] where God has brought you from where
[2:31:58] he's brought you to and your eternal
[2:32:01] destination the streets of gold travel
[2:32:06] like a thought never be bored not for
[2:32:10] one iota of an instant of time because
[2:32:13] there'll be no time you'll never be born
[2:32:16] eternity is a long time friends you
[2:32:20] don't want to miss that
[2:32:21] that's for you knowing that we're dying
[2:32:32] creatures speaking to dying creatures in
[2:32:43] Dorne
[2:32:56] the world has the world and we see words
[2:33:30] come from we see you spoke to John on
[2:33:35] the Isle of Patmos and you spoke about
[2:33:38] that little beast that would come up out
[2:33:42] of the earth look like a lamb but it was
[2:33:48] the American Buffalo America has always
[2:33:52] been pregnant with being a hat we've had
[2:33:57] George Washington's Abraham Lincoln good
[2:34:00] men but now we have come to a place
[2:34:04] where brother instead of time would it
[2:34:06] go on for 50 years the whole world would
[2:34:09] be in total insanity father we know this
[2:34:12] for your words you spoke these words to
[2:34:14] your prophet your prophets golden and
[2:34:16] you knew there would be a people right
[2:34:18] here in West Palm Beach this day you
[2:34:22] knew that that myself and brother Jack
[2:34:24] would come in contact and I'd be invited
[2:34:26] to meet his people and everything is in
[2:34:30] perfect order nothing takes you by
[2:34:32] surprise Lord we bring today
[2:34:35] for those that are in divine attendance
[2:34:37] that they would seriously consider
[2:34:40] making themselves that living sacrifice
[2:34:45] in ways perhaps they haven't done up to
[2:34:48] now maybe getting rid of the leaven in
[2:34:50] their lives maybe committing themselves
[2:34:53] to a personal intimate supernatural
[2:34:57] fellowship an intimate relationship with
[2:35:01] you if that's your preference brother
[2:35:04] Branham said perfect faith you can
[2:35:06] receive salvation right in your seats
[2:35:10] you receive healing your seats we don't
[2:35:13] have to make a big display of this good

[2:43:48] couple of things that I just need to
[2:43:49] mention real quick
[2:43:52] that our neighbors here the
[2:43:58] a catering company that came to us and
[2:44:02] they had this big old thing that they
[2:44:05] did to fix food for somebody and it got
[2:44:08] cancelled I don't know if it was because
[2:44:09] of coronavirus or not
[2:44:12] I don't know folk was afraid to gather
[2:44:14] but they cooked all this food and
[2:44:16] couldn't take it to where they were
[2:44:17] going to so guess guess what they gave
[2:44:19] it to they all fasted
[2:44:28] but we do have containers to go and I
[2:44:31] know everybody not doing the damn you're
[2:44:33] fast subduing different fastest fast
[2:44:35] endure three o'clock and then they he
[2:44:37] you know so whatever happened whatever
[2:44:40] fast use and we're not limiting it to
[2:44:41] the data fast for whatever faster doing
[2:44:43] is fine but they did they were big
[2:44:46] brought this to us and we're grateful
[2:44:47] they considered us and so after service
[2:44:51] to having table set up police take
[2:44:54] something and take it home put it in the
[2:44:56] refrigerator put it in the freezer do
[2:44:57] whatever you need to do amen just to
[2:45:00] preserve it by the police
[2:45:01] please take what they brought to you
[2:45:03] brought to us also sister Tina found out
[2:45:09] some information the school district of

[2:45:18] district families however there are
[2:45:20] designated schools that would be open

[2:45:43] information and some of the items that
[2:45:45] will be there so you can you can you can
[2:45:47] just see what that is on the board and
[2:45:49] then on top of that to know where it's
[2:45:52] going to be you have to go to the school
[2:45:53] district website to find out what's
[2:45:56] going to be and so thank God that
[2:45:59] they're trying to do something just to
[2:46:01] help the people now now you know if we
[2:46:03] do go out there and we're in sunny
[2:46:05] situations Church go prayed up
[2:46:09] because a folk of just doing some really
[2:46:13] strange things
[2:46:16] told us that people are insane and when
[2:46:19] you're going to famine type conditions
[2:46:21] and like this you know people get hungry
[2:46:24] you know grabbing groceries out of
[2:46:26] people's carts and you just get all kind
[2:46:28] of stuff we don't want to see on the
[2:46:30] news that one of our saints got in a
[2:46:32] fight right then you now we got a frying
[2:46:36] pan experience going on do you
[2:46:39] understand what I'm saying hey man I
[2:46:41] would say some be out there like that if
[2:46:43] somebody come and take your you take
[2:46:46] something from you pray for don't sit
[2:46:50] there and fuss and fight with people
[2:46:51] just you know I mean I remember the
[2:46:53] Brandon he had his clothes stolen one
[2:46:56] time out of it was they were driving
[2:47:00] through a neighborhood and and somebody
[2:47:01] in the suitcase fell out the car and he
[2:47:04] thought the clothes was stolen it was
[2:47:05] going on so brother Graham say you know
[2:47:07] what that's fine where we got it maybe
[2:47:10] they needed it more than ideas so just
[2:47:13] have that type of spirit right maybe
[2:47:15] they needed it more than I did you can
[2:47:17] have it it's fine
[2:47:19] provide for me God got a raise it
[2:47:24] that'll bring me groceries
[2:47:28] you understand glory to God
[2:47:31] Gaga got a bird room service do you
[2:47:36] think do you think Amazon got something
[2:47:41] dark out raisin
[2:47:46] hallelujah buddy but as saints
[2:47:49] we don't want to be out there acting
[2:47:50] like that
[2:47:51] so soak up rate up it matters understand
[2:47:54] that you have a lot of people that are
[2:47:56] just desperate and they just don't have
[2:47:58] to hope that you have so don't fuss and
[2:48:00] argue and fight don't do it let people
[2:48:03] see Jesus the same Jesus that was on the
[2:48:06] cross that just didn't create us victim
[2:48:09] then they'll say a word just let him do
[2:48:11] whatever they need to do that's the way
[2:48:13] we want to act them during this season
[2:48:15] so you know these things we'll go we'll
[2:48:18] go to the store and all kind of stuff
[2:48:20] but you'll have the opportunity to be a
[2:48:21] light in the midst of all this darkness
[2:48:23] and I encourage you to take advantage of
[2:48:25] the opportunity to have a man but uh but
[2:48:28] we don't want frying-pan experiences
[2:48:30] because when our Saints lost a cool
[2:48:34] you know we talk better than this we're
[2:48:37] trying to subscribe to be the statue of
[2:48:39] a perfect man perfect woman and God
[2:48:41] that's what God has called us to so amen
[2:48:44] we encourage everybody to apply those
[2:48:45] principles
[2:48:46] so just remember those two things a man
[2:48:49] as we leave tonight brother Ernie will
[2:48:53] be preaching in Boynton Beach brother
[2:48:56] James Church so keep him in prayer made
[2:48:58] man and like he said earlier there's
[2:49:01] some brothers there in China that have
[2:49:03] been arrested because they were
[2:49:05] distributing Bibles and we want to keep
[2:49:08] those brothers in prayer brother Donny
[2:49:12] Reagan we pray for him a little remember
[2:49:15] to keep him in prayer as well and just
[2:49:17] just just Saints although we need our
[2:49:19] prayer
[2:49:21] and you all just remain prayerful during
[2:49:23] this season don't let the devil draw you
[2:49:25] into anything that a man don't let him
[2:49:28] throw you into fear whatever you do
[2:49:32] it may God is in control God is in
[2:49:35] control
[2:49:36] and so whatever happens is gonna happen
[2:49:39] and and there's things that we we can't
[2:49:42] control but I want to just read the Word
[2:49:45] of God Psalms 91 is your protection
