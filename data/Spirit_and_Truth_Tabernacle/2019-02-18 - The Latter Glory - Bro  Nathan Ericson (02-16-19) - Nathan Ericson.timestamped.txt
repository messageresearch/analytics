[47:48] appreciate a man that on this morning as
[47:51] we just saw took our hearts to receive
[47:54] the word of the Lord a man that's that's
[47:58] what we all come here for brother Nathan
[48:03] will be speaking this morning last night
[48:06] he and his wife and his daughter they
[48:09] flew in about 11:30 last night
[48:12] and probably got the bed and maybe a
[48:14] little after 1:00 and I know just being
[48:17] a speaker sometimes at different
[48:20] services you kind of get in and late and
[48:22] late at night and then you got it kind
[48:25] of trying to feel the atmosphere out and
[48:27] see what your gonna preach the next
[48:28] morning and you know I just pray that
[48:31] God would just use them I think
[48:33] sometimes as ministers when we get into
[48:35] a fix like that then it helps us to get
[48:40] ourselves out the way because the
[48:42] greatest gift is getting yourself out
[48:45] the way and so this one I believe we're
[48:48] gonna hear from having anybody believe
[48:50] that hey man let God use his gift but
[48:54] you have to pull on the gift to get out
[48:56] of it what you need this for anybody
[48:58] need anything all right you got to pull
[49:01] on it to get what you need this move the
[49:03] center field

[49:07] Eric center to the bull pit on this
[49:10] morning it man as the Lord would just
[49:13] use him for his book he raps and said

[53:25] of scripture to me because to me this is
[53:28] revealing to us what was in God's heart
[53:31] at the beginning amen
[53:34] the book of Genesis shows us what was at
[53:36] the beginning but this chapter here is
[53:38] showing us what was before the beginning
[53:39] what has been in God's heart all along
[53:42] and what he's trying to bring us to as a
[53:44] people what God has desired the prophet
[53:47] of God said that God in love desired a
[53:50] family of his own amen amen
[53:53] so let's just read this precious little
[53:55] bit of Scripture here these first four
[53:56] verses and I saw a new heaven and a new
[53:59] earth for the first heaven and the first
[54:01] Earth were passed away and there was no
[54:03] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[54:06] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[54:08] of heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[54:10] for her husband and I heard a great
[54:12] voice out of heaven saying and here it
[54:15] is behold the tabernacle of God is with
[54:19] men and he will dwell with them and they
[54:22] shall be his people and God Himself amen
[54:27] shall be with them and be their God and
[54:29] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[54:32] eyes and there shall be no more death
[54:33] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[54:36] there be any more pain for the former
[54:38] things are passed away
[54:40] amen what precious words let's just pray

[56:57] real hero of mine and and I'm a product
[57:00] of youth ministry and youth camps and
[57:02] things like that and so brother Danny's
[57:04] ministry has been one of the most just
[57:07] one of the most influential tools of God
[57:10] in my life and so we appreciate him this
[57:13] family in church amen well let's uh amen
[57:18] why don't you turn with me to just lay a
[57:21] foundation this morning to the book of
[57:23] Haggai if you can find it
[57:26] Agee I Chapter two I don't mean to joke
[57:29] too much this morning I'm just making
[57:30] myself comfortable this morning but
[57:33] Hagee I the second chapter and if the
[57:35] Lord will help me this morning what I
[57:36] have on my heart is just a little simple
[57:38] thought on the latter glory
[57:41] the latter glory so may God bless the
[57:44] reading of his word and just help us to
[57:46] deliver it the way he has in mind but
[57:49] we're gonna take a foundation here in
[57:51] the book of Haggai the second chapter
[57:52] and we'll read the first 9 verses there
[57:54] and what's happening here in the
[57:56] scripture is this is a time of
[57:58] restoration the children of Israel have
[58:00] been in captivity and so God raised up
[58:04] as a rubble who had come back to read to
[58:07] bring a work of restoration under the
[58:09] authority of a king so you see it's a
[58:12] type and it's a shadow of the day that
[58:14] we're living in a time of restoration a
[58:16] time of restoring the house of God's
[58:18] worship and so that's the day that we're
[58:20] living in but I want to pull something
[58:22] out of this out of this type that just
[58:25] has really struck me recently and and
[58:28] just let the Lord kind of deal with it a
[58:30] little bit this morning but in the
[58:32] seventh month in the 21st day of the
[58:34] month came the word of the Lord by the
[58:36] Prophet Haggai saying speak now to
[58:38] zerubabbel
[58:39] the governor of Judah to Joshua the high
[58:41] priests and to the residue the people
[58:42] saying who is left among you that saw
[58:45] this house in her first glory now that's
[58:47] referring to Solomon's Temple which at
[58:50] this point in time had been destroyed
[58:51] when the children were taken into
[58:53] captivity this is Solomon's Temple and
[58:56] how do you see it now this is the new
[58:58] temple how do you see this new temple is
[59:00] it not in your eyes in comparison of
[59:03] Solomon's Temple as nothing yet now be
[59:07] strong o zerubbabel saith the Lord and
[59:09] be strong Joshua the high priest and be
[59:11] strong all you people of the land stay
[59:13] at the lord and work for i am with you
[59:15] saith the lord of hosts according to the
[59:17] word that i covenant it with you when
[59:19] you came out of egypt so my spirit
[59:21] remaineth among you fear ye not for thus
[59:24] saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a
[59:26] little while and I'll shake the heavens
[59:27] and the earth and the sea in the dry
[59:29] land and I'll shake all nations and the
[59:31] desire of nations shall come and I will
[59:34] fill this house with glory saith the
[59:37] Lord of Hosts the silvers mine and the
[59:40] gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the
[59:41] glory of this latter house shall be
[59:45] greater than the former amen
[59:47] say at the Lord of hosts and in this
[59:49] place will I give peace saith
[59:51] Lord of Hosts amen Cuse amen to the
[59:54] reading of the word all right so what I
[59:56] what strikes me about this chapter of
[59:58] Scripture here is that I was reading
[1:00:01] this through the lens of the message and
[1:00:03] and through the light of the message
[1:00:06] it's showing that this is a type of the
[1:00:07] day that we're living in a time of
[1:00:09] restoration and so the children of
[1:00:11] Israel have come and they put their
[1:00:12] labor they've given their lives for the
[1:00:14] message of their day and they they just
[1:00:16] they put everything they had into the
[1:00:18] cause and they've they've they've just
[1:00:20] labored and worked and given their lives
[1:00:22] for this work of restoration trying to
[1:00:24] build up the temple that was torn down
[1:00:26] amen by the enemy now now but you find
[1:00:29] here that in the scripture that that
[1:00:31] there's something in the hearts of the
[1:00:33] children when they begin to look at this
[1:00:34] temple that's been restored and then
[1:00:36] they begin to compare it to what God had
[1:00:38] done in the past they've begun to make
[1:00:40] comparisons to the Temple of Solomon and
[1:00:43] you know how the scripture speaks of
[1:00:44] Solomon's Temple how it was so big and
[1:00:46] beautiful and it was full of treasure
[1:00:48] and it was impressive to the eye and it
[1:00:50] just had a glamour to it and it had a
[1:00:52] beauty to it that this new temple didn't
[1:00:55] even though even though they given their
[1:00:56] everything to it yet it was a humble
[1:00:59] house and it was a it was a simple place
[1:01:01] and there wasn't there was nothing about
[1:01:03] it that would be have any beauty that
[1:01:05] would be pleasing to the eye amen and it
[1:01:07] actually brought a discouragement on the
[1:01:09] hearts of the people because they began
[1:01:11] to look around at what God had done and
[1:01:13] they were looking at the outward signs
[1:01:15] and they were looking at the outward
[1:01:17] circumstances and it caused a
[1:01:18] discouragement because they were making
[1:01:20] comparisons to what God had done in the
[1:01:22] past yet not realizing the glory of what
[1:01:25] was happening right in their myths amen
[1:01:27] oh I think we're gonna have church this
[1:01:29] mornin amen because the God raised up a
[1:01:31] prophet to tell the people to take
[1:01:33] comfort people of God but even though
[1:01:35] you look at what God's work and it looks
[1:01:37] humble it looks small it there may not
[1:01:39] be the crowds that there used to be
[1:01:41] there might not be the big buildings or
[1:01:43] the or the big ministries or all those
[1:01:45] things but he said there's coming a
[1:01:46] greater glory
[1:01:48] Amen into this house say man and I
[1:01:50] believe what the if you read in the
[1:01:52] scripture you'll find that the glory of
[1:01:54] that house that was so much greater than
[1:01:56] Solomon was one day than this humble
[1:01:58] little temple the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:00] would come in a body of flesh and walked
[1:02:03] through the front door that temple amen
[1:02:05] and the personal presence of Jesus
[1:02:07] Christ was a greater glory than Solomon
[1:02:09] because a greater than Solomon had come
[1:02:12] through his temple hey man hallelujah
[1:02:14] and I believe today that a greater than
[1:02:16] Solomon is here amen the thing that is
[1:02:19] so striking about how the Prophet would
[1:02:21] t preach that a greater than Solomon a
[1:02:23] greater than Solomon Amen or was that
[1:02:26] was what it was it was witnessing to the
[1:02:29] fact that you know with Solomon's to
[1:02:32] think the way he brought out is
[1:02:33] Solomon's ministry was so great you know
[1:02:35] and how he would he would have wisdom to
[1:02:37] discern and bring the right answers and
[1:02:39] things like that and it brought the the
[1:02:41] world to Solomon the world came to
[1:02:44] Solomon to feed on that that first pole
[1:02:46] in that second pole Amen hallelujah but
[1:02:48] brother Branham said when Jesus came it
[1:02:51] was a greater than Solomon that had come
[1:02:53] to his people and the world totally
[1:02:55] missed it amen amen they came to Jesus
[1:02:57] when He healed the sick they can't do
[1:02:59] him when they when he looked into the
[1:03:00] hearts of man but when he said he must
[1:03:02] eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:03:04] amen and began to open up the word to
[1:03:06] his people they could not receive it
[1:03:08] amen but it was a greater glory to be
[1:03:11] associated with that word even though
[1:03:13] the world miss it it was a greater than
[1:03:16] Solomon amen and I'm so glad this
[1:03:19] morning to be gathered with you people
[1:03:21] here the bride of Jesus Christ amen the
[1:03:24] world doesn't see you the world's not
[1:03:26] looking at you but there's a presence in
[1:03:29] your myths there's somebody in this
[1:03:31] temple amen
[1:03:34] oh my I'd rather be in this Omega Church
[1:03:37] than the biggest mega church amen I'd
[1:03:40] rather fellowship with the bride of
[1:03:41] Jesus Christ amen amen and no a man
[1:03:46] whose presence I'm in the thing that
[1:03:49] made it so glorious was the coming of
[1:03:51] the Messiah the desire of Nations come
[1:03:53] into his temple
[1:03:54] amen that's why brother Brennan said the
[1:03:56] beauty of a church is the character of
[1:03:58] the people not the building not the you
[1:04:01] know not the programs and nothing you
[1:04:04] know not the numbers and things like
[1:04:05] that but it's the character in other
[1:04:07] words the life that's in the people is
[1:04:09] the beauty of the church and Christ is
[1:04:11] the beauty of this church amen amen
[1:04:13] because it's his life his character his
[1:04:16] nature living in you
[1:04:17] oh my know you not that you are the
[1:04:20] temple of God amen and that the Spirit
[1:04:23] of God dwells in you if any man defiles
[1:04:25] that temple him shall God destroy why
[1:04:29] because the temple of God is holy which
[1:04:33] temple you are amen
[1:04:35] now I want you to see something that the
[1:04:36] temple of God is a holy house amen it's
[1:04:39] a holy temple amen not because of what
[1:04:42] you are not because of the house that
[1:04:44] you're living in brother this flesh is
[1:04:46] serpent seed it's not redeemed amen it
[1:04:50] can't be it can't be reformed it's
[1:04:52] fallen nature flesh but there's
[1:04:55] something on the inside amen there's a
[1:04:57] life on the inside and because he is
[1:05:00] holy you are holy hey man
[1:05:03] amen that's why the Bible said I would
[1:05:05] that men everywhere would lift up holy
[1:05:08] hands say man there's nothing about this
[1:05:10] flesh that's holy nothing about it
[1:05:12] that's that's godly or righteous amen
[1:05:15] but because of a holy God living on the
[1:05:17] inside we can lift our hands this
[1:05:19] morning
[1:05:20] and it's a Rollie worship under God you
[1:05:23] can lift up your voice you might not be
[1:05:25] able to sing your way out of a wet paper
[1:05:26] bag Amen but it's if you lift up your
[1:05:29] voice to God it's a sweet savour in his
[1:05:31] ear Amen because why because it's the
[1:05:34] holy worship in a holy temple Amen
[1:05:37] tabernacling a holy God praise God you
[1:05:41] also as lively stones you've been built
[1:05:44] up a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[1:05:47] to offer up spiritual sacrifices which
[1:05:51] are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[1:05:55] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ the
[1:05:58] Bible says you are accepted in the
[1:06:00] beloved amen if you're in Christ you're
[1:06:03] accepted this morning you're holy you're
[1:06:05] the temple of God amen oh my so don't
[1:06:09] fear the enemy because him that would
[1:06:10] harm that temple him shall God destroy
[1:06:12] hey man
[1:06:14] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:17] ci what I want you to see is that
[1:06:19] everything that we're teaching around
[1:06:21] this message everything as we read the
[1:06:24] there in Revelations 21 what was in
[1:06:26] God's heart
[1:06:27] amen above all things was to make his
[1:06:29] habitation with a family in the
[1:06:31] beginning he was alone with his thoughts
[1:06:32] amen but when his thoughts have all
[1:06:35] become manifest Amen then he can gather
[1:06:37] with them and gather them together and
[1:06:39] have a fellowship with those attributes
[1:06:41] there they were in a mystery for him but
[1:06:43] today they've been manifested amen
[1:06:45] all the prophet of God said you are
[1:06:47] nothing less than the physical
[1:06:49] manifestation of the attributes that
[1:06:51] were in God's mind at the beginning amen
[1:06:54] but he has desired to speak you into
[1:06:55] this time and this place Amen that you
[1:06:58] could be expressed so why so that he
[1:07:01] could have set the ship with you amen oh
[1:07:04] that's why the camping of the bride and
[1:07:06] the statue of a perfect man and the
[1:07:08] restoration of bride tree in the bride
[1:07:10] age and the Seventh Seal and the third
[1:07:12] pole and all those things brother the
[1:07:14] reason there preached the reason they
[1:07:16] had to be open Amen is for one purpose
[1:07:19] and that's to tabernacle the presence of
[1:07:21] God in the
[1:07:22] seven people not to make a bunch of
[1:07:25] intellectual quote corners Amen people
[1:07:27] who can yeah people who can quote all
[1:07:29] the quotes and spiritual scientists and
[1:07:32] break it down and analyze it but to
[1:07:34] bring forth of living people that are
[1:07:36] manifesting the attributes of God so
[1:07:39] that he can have personal residence in
[1:07:42] his tabernacle this morning hallelujah
[1:07:47] amen it's not to build adoption in the
[1:07:50] stature of perving they're not to make
[1:07:51] superhero Christians or or big
[1:07:53] ministries or big people or some kind of
[1:07:55] a Pentecostal idea like that but it's to
[1:07:58] make a humble holy amen consecrated
[1:08:01] temple to the Spirit of God amen when
[1:08:04] the church has cast him out amen when
[1:08:06] he's on the outside knocking on the door
[1:08:08] there is a bride that was predestinated
[1:08:11] to receive him amen and that's why it
[1:08:17] looks so humble that's why it looks so
[1:08:22] small that's why many people are
[1:08:24] discouraged brother Jack amen because
[1:08:26] they're looking at the house amen and
[1:08:29] not the God that's in the house amen
[1:08:33] because he's hiding himself behind a
[1:08:35] veil again amen all can you imagine in
[1:08:38] the Old Testament how the very pillar of
[1:08:40] fire the Shekinah glory of God amen
[1:08:42] would live amongst his people behind
[1:08:45] badger skins just imagine some dirty old
[1:08:48] badger running around the desert you
[1:08:50] know one day he's running around eating
[1:08:52] worms and locusts and things next thing
[1:08:54] you know he's tacked up on the wall
[1:08:56] tabernacling amen and the the pillar of
[1:08:59] fire oh what a what it's foolish to our
[1:09:02] minds to think about that amen but
[1:09:05] brother Branham preached that that back
[1:09:08] then it was badger skins but today by
[1:09:11] the unveiling of God amen
[1:09:13] the the glory of God is behind your skin
[1:09:16] that's what the message came to reveal
[1:09:19] was the presence of Jesus Christ but not
[1:09:22] only his presence but where he is
[1:09:24] present at today
[1:09:26] Amen how do I know he and then you ask
[1:09:28] me how I know he lives he lives within
[1:09:31] my heart
[1:09:32] amen all and it's foolish to the eye
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:35] maybe we'll deal with it tomorrow
[1:09:36] morning but it's the foolishness of God
[1:09:38] the scripture says Amen it's beyond all
[1:09:41] of our imagining amen because we look at
[1:09:43] ourselves we look at the veil that's
[1:09:45] there always the problem looking at the
[1:09:47] veil and the humility and the frailty of
[1:09:50] the veil amen
[1:09:51] but but oh my but see that's the reason
[1:09:55] he chose that veil amen
[1:09:57] he said my strength is made perfect in
[1:09:59] weakness my grace is sufficient for you
[1:10:03] and I've chosen the weak things of the
[1:10:05] world the mean things of the world the
[1:10:07] lowly
[1:10:07] amen the poor the uneducated amen the
[1:10:10] unknown that's who I've chosen that no
[1:10:13] flesh may glory in my presence oh my but
[1:10:17] if the presence of God is living with
[1:10:19] you amen then it's a greater glory than
[1:10:22] even Solomon's Temple it's a greater
[1:10:25] glory than it was in those badger skins
[1:10:27] why because we're we're just a little
[1:10:29] bit closer to what God is desired that
[1:10:32] he would dwell with his people and God
[1:10:35] Himself would be their God God chose you
[1:10:39] not in spite of your humility but
[1:10:41] because of it he hides himself in
[1:10:44] simplicity in humility Amen a humanity
[1:10:47] so this bride she might not be the
[1:10:49] biggest or the brightest Amen but but
[1:10:52] she is the temple of the Lord and that's
[1:10:55] what a message will reveal to you that
[1:10:56] you are the temple of his presence amen
[1:11:00] now how do you become that temple amen
[1:11:03] you got to come just like Solomon's
[1:11:04] Temple now and Solomon's Temple you know
[1:11:07] they built it up big and beautiful and a
[1:11:08] whole lot of work went into it there was
[1:11:10] a whole lot of fountain they laid a
[1:11:11] foundation you know and they they had a
[1:11:13] lot of effort they had a lot of works
[1:11:15] and things like that and that was all
[1:11:16] contributing to that cause because it
[1:11:18] made a it made an impressive show you
[1:11:21] know it made a Mencia you know and then
[1:11:27] they dedicated it to the Lord and they
[1:11:29] had all kinds of fine prayers and
[1:11:31] offerings and things like that and they
[1:11:33] although all the religious works and the
[1:11:35] religious rituals and things like that
[1:11:37] that was all Wonder
[1:11:38] amen but you know there was temples all
[1:11:40] around the world temples all around the
[1:11:43] world you know that were bigger than
[1:11:44] Solomon's and probably and maybe more
[1:11:46] beautiful and and held more riches and
[1:11:49] amen and and more Fame but but there was
[1:11:52] something about that temple had to come
[1:11:53] to a place amen
[1:11:55] the Bible said when the when Solomon had
[1:11:57] made an end of praying when the praying
[1:11:59] was done when the church attendance was
[1:12:01] over amen when all the singing was over
[1:12:03] with something had to happen in that
[1:12:05] temple the fire of God had to come down
[1:12:08] from heaven and fill it up and fill it
[1:12:11] up right man and that's what it's got to
[1:12:13] be for every Christian life when the
[1:12:15] brains over with when the church
[1:12:16] membership is all done have you come to
[1:12:19] the place where the fire of God has
[1:12:21] filled you up and made you the temple of
[1:12:24] the Holy Ghost amen the fire came up
[1:12:29] from heaven and it consumed the burnt
[1:12:31] offering in the sacrifices and the glory
[1:12:33] of the Lord filled the house amen and
[1:12:37] the priest could not enter amen
[1:12:42] into the house of the Lord because the
[1:12:45] glory of the Lord had filled it up amen
[1:12:47] if you ever come to the place till you
[1:12:49] get baptized with this fire till the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost is living in you as a temple
[1:12:54] not it moved on your flesh not it blew
[1:12:56] past the front door but it came and made
[1:12:59] its residence in your heart amen then
[1:13:02] there's no more mediator you don't need
[1:13:05] your pastor anymore to pump you up every
[1:13:08] Sunday morning you don't have to run to
[1:13:10] the Deacon every time you got trouble
[1:13:11] you don't need the song leader to stamp
[1:13:13] his feet and get a fire going there will
[1:13:15] be a fire all the time
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:19] Amen that holy fire not a strange fire
[1:13:23] your ideas won't work anymore your
[1:13:25] opinions won't work anymore the way you
[1:13:28] were raised in your background and the
[1:13:30] way your daddy used to tell it and the
[1:13:32] way your old pastor in the denomination
[1:13:34] used to teach it that won't do it
[1:13:36] anymore
[1:13:36] because it's not your house anymore
[1:13:40] hey man but it's his house it's full of
[1:13:45] his fire amen burning up for God see all
[1:13:50] the beauty and all the sacrifice and
[1:13:52] everything would have been in vain if
[1:13:53] God didn't fill that house Amen you know
[1:13:56] there was pyramids in Egypt that made
[1:13:58] Solomon's Temple look tiny hey man but
[1:14:02] they were full of dead people but
[1:14:06] Solomon's Temple was full of the life of
[1:14:08] that pillar fire glory to God glory to
[1:14:14] God
[1:14:15] hey man I want you to see brother
[1:14:17] Branham said once a year that high
[1:14:18] priests had to come into that temple and
[1:14:20] he had to be dressed a certain way oh my
[1:14:26] now at the priests house the priest
[1:14:29] could dress how he wanted he could walk
[1:14:31] the way he wanted he could do whatever
[1:14:33] he wanted long as he was in his house
[1:14:36] but when he came to God's house he had
[1:14:40] to be dressed a certain way he had to be
[1:14:44] anointed a certain way they had to be
[1:14:47] anointed with that perfume of the Rose
[1:14:49] of Sharon had to run down to the hem of
[1:14:51] his garment
[1:14:52] amen not just a sprinkling I had to be a
[1:14:55] full baptism amen and on the end of his
[1:14:58] garment he had a bell and a pomegranate
[1:15:01] and he had to walk a certain way amen to
[1:15:06] make that play a song
[1:15:09] a man there's a whole lot of people out
[1:15:11] here in these denominational churches
[1:15:12] they got a good song amen but see he had
[1:15:16] to play a certain song amen a certain
[1:15:19] song and he had to walk a certain way
[1:15:22] because when his walk was right it would
[1:15:25] cause that Bell to play a song that was
[1:15:28] holy holy holy unto the Lord amen now
[1:15:32] listen now when you get a revelation of
[1:15:36] the presence of Jesus Christ if you ever
[1:15:39] really say this see this minute this
[1:15:41] message that's the day legalism will die
[1:15:44] amen because it's no longer amen do's
[1:15:48] and don'ts and rules and regulations but
[1:15:51] you will understand that there are
[1:15:53] things that we don't look at because
[1:15:55] these are his eyes there are things that
[1:15:57] we don't do cuz these aren't his hands
[1:15:59] places we don't go cuz these are his
[1:16:02] feet it's his temple his tabernacle
[1:16:06] glory to God but I would rather full of
[1:16:10] the fire of God I would rather be full
[1:16:12] of his glory than to be some grape a
[1:16:14] Hollywood Palace some great dad Egyptian
[1:16:18] to a man I want to be a living temple
[1:16:21] full of a living God amen so I'm gonna
[1:16:25] walk a certain way I'm gonna dress a
[1:16:28] certain way speak a certain way what's
[1:16:31] he doing he's approaching the Shekinah
[1:16:34] glory oh the real fellowship and he had
[1:16:39] to make a noise and the only way the
[1:16:44] congregation could tell he wasn't dead
[1:16:46] is because they could hear the noise
[1:16:51] amen I tell you when the church lets off
[1:16:54] its noise there's something that happens
[1:16:56] as Shores the world because everywhere
[1:16:58] the Shekinah glory is there's a noise
[1:17:02] I tell you if there's a Spirit of God in
[1:17:05] you there will be a noise there will be
[1:17:07] a reaction there will be something in
[1:17:09] your heart to respond to the word Amen I
[1:17:13] don't care if you shout I don't care if
[1:17:14] you dance I don't care if you sit there
[1:17:16] real quiet and cry but there will be a
[1:17:19] reaction it will be some dead religion
[1:17:22] but there will be something in your
[1:17:24] heart to respond to the word and honest
[1:17:27] and a genuine reaction to the word Amen
[1:17:32] because word recognises word Amen the
[1:17:35] Spirit of God recognizes the Spirit of
[1:17:38] God Amen something on the inside I'll
[1:17:41] say Amen to the word Amen what that is
[1:17:44] that's that fire in that temple what am
[1:17:46] I talking about the quickening power not
[1:17:48] emotion this morning but power
[1:17:50] quickening power that can bring you to
[1:17:53] life all we need that quickening power I
[1:17:56] know we got so deep and we got so mature
[1:17:58] and we got so educated in the message
[1:18:01] till we can't shout no more
[1:18:06] Amen but listen here now brother branham
[1:18:09] said quickening power open the seven
[1:18:11] seals and clicking power will let us see
[1:18:15] his coming
[1:18:16] so until you've got under that
[1:18:18] quickening power you haven't even seen
[1:18:21] the message yet yes amen amen
[1:18:27] it's got to have the quickening power to
[1:18:29] bring that seed to life amen all my we
[1:18:33] got to where we can teach this message
[1:18:34] so good and I love teaching
[1:18:36] amen I love teaching amen but we've got
[1:18:39] it too we taught it so perfect it'd be
[1:18:41] like we had the body of Jesus Christ
[1:18:43] laying here just as perfect as when they
[1:18:44] laid him in the tomb but until the
[1:18:46] Spirit of Christ comes into the body of
[1:18:49] Christ
[1:18:49] it's never gonna live but if that
[1:18:52] quickening power the race Christ from
[1:18:54] the dead dwells in you it'll live it'll
[1:18:58] do the works of Christ it'll live the
[1:19:00] life of Christ it'll have the nature of
[1:19:02] Christ that's what we need in this day
[1:19:04] amen we got the mechanics just right but
[1:19:07] just one time let those dynamics strike
[1:19:10] I meant that perfect teaching and then
[1:19:13] what kind of a church would it produce
[1:19:15] amen hallelujah amen whoa oh I know
[1:19:22] we're beyond Pentecost you know we are
[1:19:25] more than that he said we got all that
[1:19:27] plus amen but the reason we need that
[1:19:29] plus what we got amen is because they
[1:19:32] had all the steam but nothing to apply
[1:19:34] it to Oh am i but I'm so glad a prophet
[1:19:37] said in 1965 amen he said that I believe
[1:19:42] that Pentecost began without an ending I
[1:19:45] believe it's to all people all times all
[1:19:50] places that the Pentecostal blessing
[1:19:52] should always remain and what is the
[1:19:55] Pentecostal blessing it's the evidence
[1:19:58] of the resurrection
[1:20:00] you asked me how I know he lives he
[1:20:03] lives within my heart he never gave me a
[1:20:06] message amen and got me all educated and
[1:20:09] got it all worked out in my mind and
[1:20:11] sent me out to work it out on my own
[1:20:12] amen but God never sends a message and
[1:20:15] then leaves it up to man to bring it to
[1:20:16] pass
[1:20:17] God is his own interpreter hallelujah
[1:20:21] amen I still gotta preach tomorrow so
[1:20:23] don't pull it all out Amen but God's his
[1:20:26] own interpreter amen we get so much like
[1:20:28] Moses till Moses knew the message to
[1:20:30] such a place till he was raised in it
[1:20:33] his momma taught it to him all his life
[1:20:35] and he knew beyond a shadow of doubt
[1:20:37] that he was to be that deliverer
[1:20:39] amen but he got impatient and he got in
[1:20:43] what brother Graham called intellectual
[1:20:45] faith now brother Ram didn't say
[1:20:46] intellectual faith was wrong but he said
[1:20:48] it was a first phase Amen this is why
[1:20:51] are people still toss about he said
[1:20:52] there's two phases first one's
[1:20:54] intellectual and the second one's by
[1:20:55] experience Amen there wasn't anything
[1:20:58] wrong with his intellectual faith the
[1:20:59] problem was he got ahead of God's timing
[1:21:01] because it wasn't up to Moses to deliver
[1:21:04] the people a man God was gonna do the
[1:21:06] deliveries amen so Moses got to thinking
[1:21:10] wow you know I just got it seems like we
[1:21:12] got such good teaching we got such a
[1:21:14] good understanding seems like there
[1:21:15] ought to be something happening seems
[1:21:18] like we oughtta well you know we ought
[1:21:19] to hold some meetings or get some
[1:21:20] brothers together we oughtta we got to
[1:21:22] do something we got to do something amen
[1:21:26] amen just like the seven thunders took
[1:21:29] the message and said you know we got to
[1:21:31] do something
[1:21:32] Amen or perugia would take a part of the
[1:21:35] message and say we got to do something
[1:21:37] we got to do something but it was before
[1:21:39] God's time amen
[1:21:41] so Moses went out and I put all his
[1:21:43] human effort into making something
[1:21:45] happen killed himself warned Egyptian
[1:21:47] what a deliverance amen and it took 40
[1:21:50] years in the backside of the wilderness
[1:21:52] through tests and trials and things to
[1:21:54] beat all that pride out of him till he
[1:21:56] got to the place where brother Bram said
[1:21:58] he came before that pillar of fire and
[1:21:59] when he met the pillar of fire he met he
[1:22:02] knew the message he cut his teeth on a
[1:22:05] message Pew he was raised in it he was
[1:22:07] like me he was a message brat
[1:22:09] amen but nnn and he knew all about it
[1:22:12] Amen but he had to come to a personal
[1:22:15] experience with the pillar fire rather
[1:22:17] Ram said a man has no right to stand
[1:22:19] behind a pulpit and preach unless he's
[1:22:20] met that pillar fire personally but he
[1:22:22] didn't leave it with the ministry said
[1:22:24] anyone who wants to call themselves a
[1:22:26] Christian must come to a personal
[1:22:29] experience with God and when he did
[1:22:33] brother Brahim said something so
[1:22:35] wonderful he said there at that pillar
[1:22:37] fire his faith was anointed it was
[1:22:42] anointed amen and then it was a one-man
[1:22:45] invasion hey man oh we can't do away
[1:22:49] with this quickening power brother
[1:22:50] sister that's our only hope it's the
[1:22:53] only way we're gonna fulfill now we're
[1:22:55] not doing away with the word they'll be
[1:22:56] the word and no we want to go my way
[1:22:59] we've not gone further on from the
[1:23:01] message we've gone further in today amen
[1:23:04] and it's more real now than it ever was
[1:23:06] by the quickening power that's what I
[1:23:09] believe I'm not putting it off in the
[1:23:11] future I'm not looking to what God into
[1:23:14] the past I'm looking for that latter
[1:23:15] glory hey man there we found the topic
[1:23:19] again hey man oh how do I know people
[1:23:21] think that we're too mature for those
[1:23:23] Pentecostal blessings hey man till they
[1:23:25] get all we're so mature you know till we
[1:23:27] can't have all those things hey man I'll
[1:23:29] tell you something that's not mature
[1:23:31] that's old it's barren it's dried up
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:35] I tell you Sarah she was every bit the
[1:23:37] Bride of Abraham amen but until she was
[1:23:41] restored back by the earnest of the
[1:23:43] inheritance restored back to her youth
[1:23:46] she could never bring forth the promised
[1:23:48] son which is the coming of the Lord and
[1:23:50] I tell you this bride unless she's
[1:23:53] restored back to the faith of the
[1:23:54] Pentecostal fathers she will never bring
[1:23:58] forth the coming of the Lord she won't
[1:24:00] do it hey man she's got to be restored
[1:24:03] but she won't be like these Pentecostals
[1:24:05] who've got that youthful exuberance and
[1:24:07] they got that energy and things amen but
[1:24:09] they won't take the seed but this bride
[1:24:11] will not only go back to her youth she
[1:24:13] has received a seed it's been sealed
[1:24:16] into her womb the seed word of a pure
[1:24:17] message
[1:24:18] man Oh am I in an hour the quickening
[1:24:20] power has brought that seat to life and
[1:24:23] it's growing and it's pushing out and
[1:24:25] then and it's advancing it's happening
[1:24:28] right before your eyes brother sister
[1:24:29] but if you're looking at the veil you'll
[1:24:31] miss it all together just like the world
[1:24:33] has missing but Christ is here in his
[1:24:36] bride and he's showing himself to be
[1:24:39] alive and soon and very soon the very
[1:24:43] rapture will come right out of the womb
[1:24:44] of Sarah oh my but we got to be like
[1:24:49] Mary a man or men you ever compare Sarah
[1:24:53] and Mary there in the word how they both
[1:24:54] had the same thought how could this be
[1:24:56] Sarah said how could it be seeing I know
[1:24:59] not a man you know I never went to Bible
[1:25:01] School you know we I never heard of
[1:25:03] these big these great teachers and
[1:25:05] things and these people got such
[1:25:06] revelation you know and I just I just
[1:25:07] humbly believe the message best I can
[1:25:09] you know how could it be me brother Jack
[1:25:11] hey man how could it be the angel said
[1:25:13] fear not with God all things shall be
[1:25:16] possible
[1:25:18] amen Mary said how can it be seeing I
[1:25:21] know not a man fear not Mary with God
[1:25:24] all things are possible
[1:25:26] so you've got to come to a place where
[1:25:29] you stop wrestling with this message and
[1:25:31] start believing it for a change amen if
[1:25:33] it says you're an invincible army why
[1:25:35] don't you take God at His Word one time
[1:25:37] and say be it unto me according to thy
[1:25:41] word
[1:25:41] I'm looking at this batch of skin and I
[1:25:44] don't see it and I can't understand it
[1:25:46] but something in my soul believes it
[1:25:49] something about me I just got thee O
[1:25:52] that the audacity to say maybe that
[1:25:54] could be me maybe I could be that bride
[1:25:57] that invincible army maybe I could
[1:25:59] fulfill the mission the Ministry of
[1:26:01] Christ everything he said about this
[1:26:04] bride Oh could it be me I've got to
[1:26:07] believe it could for with God all things
[1:26:10] are possible
[1:26:11] amen amen glory amen that's why we want
[1:26:17] the spirit moving in the church we want
[1:26:18] the quickening power poured out we want
[1:26:20] to see the supernatural we want to see
[1:26:22] people get born again amen
[1:26:23] you know I found out well I just got one
[1:26:25] little baby there that found out when
[1:26:27] that baby was born there's something
[1:26:28] about when a baby's born everybody
[1:26:30] around gets new life amen
[1:26:31] my life totally changed amen grandpa and
[1:26:35] grandma their lives changed and mama's
[1:26:37] life sure changed there was a whole lot
[1:26:39] of change happening in the family when
[1:26:42] the baby was born and that's why when we
[1:26:44] got altars full of young people being
[1:26:46] born again that does something for a
[1:26:48] church and then because it shows that
[1:26:51] we're not gathered around a dead
[1:26:52] religion amen but it's still moving and
[1:26:55] still working and still pulling and it's
[1:26:57] still leading us on to the rapture
[1:27:00] amen amen but we got to the place where
[1:27:03] we're so mature and so such quote
[1:27:05] quoters and so dignified till we got
[1:27:07] like brother Adam said it be like a
[1:27:08] woman who doesn't want to bring forth a
[1:27:10] child because it would mess up her
[1:27:12] figure it would take away her dignity it
[1:27:15] would take away your pride you know her
[1:27:17] bishop status you know and and so he
[1:27:20] said that that's the way the church is
[1:27:22] today they don't want any of now this is
[1:27:26] 1964 or five so this is after the
[1:27:29] opening of the word he said she don't
[1:27:32] want any of those looping hollering
[1:27:34] tongue talkin Pentecostal young uns
[1:27:37] runnin around cuz it would certainly
[1:27:39] embarrass her it would certainly bring
[1:27:42] her shame in the community everybody
[1:27:44] would look down on her church because
[1:27:46] they're so many mature they're so
[1:27:48] Pentecostal hey man hey man when I
[1:27:51] married my wife or when my married me
[1:27:54] and and came down to my church somebody
[1:27:57] pulled her aside this was a message
[1:27:58] believer said ho you don't want to go
[1:28:01] down that little Amish Pentecostal
[1:28:03] Church down there can you imagine
[1:28:06] Amish Pentecost I don't know if they
[1:28:10] they couldn't figure out if we were to
[1:28:12] bound or to free but
[1:28:14] amen but you know there's something in
[1:28:16] my heart Amen people might look down on
[1:28:18] it but I'm so happy to be associated
[1:28:21] Amen with that young thriving bride of
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ amen oh and and there's
[1:28:28] somebody watching over her
[1:28:30] amen there's something you know every
[1:28:31] time there's a real fire of God amen
[1:28:34] there's always a chance of wildfire now
[1:28:36] amen now that people like to use a quote
[1:28:39] well I'd rather have a little wildfire
[1:28:41] than no fire at all you know of course I
[1:28:43] want their real fire amen but you know
[1:28:46] the only time you got to worry about a
[1:28:47] wildfire springing up if is nobody's
[1:28:50] tending that fire amen brother and said
[1:28:53] this bride won't go into fanaticism
[1:28:55] because there's a mama Eagle that's
[1:28:57] hovering around the waiting to catch her
[1:28:59] amen
[1:29:00] oh the devil don't care which side he
[1:29:02] gets you on if he can't make you dried
[1:29:04] up and formal he'll take you off in a
[1:29:05] fanaticism and he doesn't care which did
[1:29:08] she gets you into amen but there is a
[1:29:10] bride that'll go right down the middle
[1:29:12] the road of this message she's not going
[1:29:16] into fanaticism amen but the devil won't
[1:29:18] steal her joy he won't take that shout
[1:29:21] out of the camp
[1:29:22] why because everywhere the Shekinah
[1:29:24] glory is there's the noise hey man I
[1:29:27] know it might have been silence when
[1:29:29] that seventh seal open but that's
[1:29:30] because he was down here and wherever
[1:29:32] Jesus is there's noise glory to God I
[1:29:37] believe he's here this mornin somebody
[1:29:40] ought to ring those joy bells
[1:29:42] hallelujah he's here he's there
[1:29:45] that's more than a superstition that's
[1:29:48] more than a church tradition it's the
[1:29:50] reality of his presence but you don't
[1:29:53] see him because he's hidden hey man you
[1:29:58] know they're back there on Azusa Street
[1:29:59] when the Pentecostal outpouring came
[1:30:01] I've read the testimonies aware where of
[1:30:03] young people children they were children
[1:30:05] at Azusa Street and I've read their
[1:30:07] stories how that when they the Shekinah
[1:30:09] glory would come into that building so
[1:30:10] thick like a cloud until the children
[1:30:13] played hide-and-seek in the Tabernacle
[1:30:15] in the Shekinah glory what a glory what
[1:30:18] an outpoint
[1:30:19] and there were people that would testify
[1:30:20] of how that pillar of fire well they'd
[1:30:23] be out on the street and watch the
[1:30:24] pillar of fire go up and down over that
[1:30:26] building amen amen but it seems like
[1:30:29] they don't see that around the
[1:30:30] Pentecostal churches anymore and they
[1:30:32] wonder where it went and they're waiting
[1:30:34] for it to come back but I know where it
[1:30:36] is
[1:30:37] I believe that glory gathered itself up
[1:30:40] and it appeared to us above the head of
[1:30:42] a prophet in Houston of indicating a
[1:30:45] message but it didn't stay there with a
[1:30:47] prophet but I believe that pillar fire
[1:30:50] tongues of fire went out men and possess
[1:30:53] the Tabernacles of spoken word children
[1:30:56] of God and today we're bearing about in
[1:30:59] our bodies that very Shekinah glory the
[1:31:04] world doesn't see it and sometimes we
[1:31:06] don't see it but it is nothing but the
[1:31:09] truth it's nothing about the truth I'm
[1:31:12] not waiting for a prophet to return I'm
[1:31:15] not waiting for a great revival to
[1:31:16] strike America I mean that brides
[1:31:18] revival because why I've been revived
[1:31:21] I've been brought to life there's a life
[1:31:23] inside of me just like Sarah just like
[1:31:27] Mary oh just like Eve but this one won't
[1:31:30] fall
[1:31:31] she can't amen hallelujah hallelu
[1:31:36] yeah hallelujah amen
[1:31:40] see if your pride is in yourself you've
[1:31:43] missed the humility of his presence if
[1:31:45] it's about who you are and your ministry
[1:31:47] and what you can do
[1:31:48] brother Anna said in perfect strength by
[1:31:50] perfect weakness he said there's one
[1:31:52] thing that we must master and that's the
[1:31:55] thought of human ability one little
[1:31:58] thought that you've got any ability a
[1:32:01] man I thought when I started preaching
[1:32:02] you know because I was educating went to
[1:32:04] school and things like that and have
[1:32:06] common intellectual type of personality
[1:32:08] well I thought the Lord would be able to
[1:32:10] use that you know and I thought how
[1:32:13] naive you know I I thought well you know
[1:32:15] Lord surely you know you'll let me you
[1:32:17] allow me to just you know break things
[1:32:19] down that way or whatever it would be
[1:32:20] you know whatever you want Lord but
[1:32:22] surely you'll be able to use something
[1:32:23] and he hasn't yet because it's not the
[1:32:27] human ability but God is his own
[1:32:30] interpreter now if it's it's the
[1:32:33] humility of his presence amen
[1:32:36] oh that's why if we ever get so stuffed
[1:32:39] up and so self-righteous and so educated
[1:32:42] and intellectual around this message
[1:32:44] amen you need an outpouring you need
[1:32:47] something Amen you need get under the
[1:32:49] the movie in the spirit sometime and
[1:32:51] break that off of you you got to get
[1:32:53] like David amen till he got to dancing
[1:32:55] he got the revelation of God's presence
[1:32:57] being restored amen which brother am
[1:33:00] tied to the opening of the seventh seal
[1:33:01] amen and that revelation didn't cause
[1:33:03] him to get stuffed up he didn't go get a
[1:33:06] big tall chair and say look at me how I
[1:33:09] open up bro how I brought the opening
[1:33:10] the word and brought the ark back in and
[1:33:12] look how I can teach and preach and all
[1:33:13] these things no he got to dancing he got
[1:33:17] the victory Amen and he had to dance
[1:33:19] amen and believe in his own family look
[1:33:21] down on him amen until all those kingly
[1:33:23] robes of dignity fell off hey man oh man
[1:33:27] if you ever get to the place brother
[1:33:28] sister to get to be such a stuffed shirt
[1:33:31] around this message till your Joy's gone
[1:33:33] till you can't be moved by the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost
[1:33:36] I tell you wouldn't hurt you to get down
[1:33:38] a roll on the floor a little while till
[1:33:39] all those worlds of dignity fall
[1:33:41] oh my people Mitel down at Mary with
[1:33:45] that baby in her arms brother and said
[1:33:46] it didn't make any difference what they
[1:33:48] thought she knew whose son that was and
[1:33:51] so is every believer that accepts God's
[1:33:53] Word into their heart I don't care what
[1:33:55] the system say you know what it is
[1:33:58] you were there it happened to you amen
[1:34:04] let them call you Pentecostal Holy
[1:34:06] Roller fanatic whatever they want let
[1:34:08] them call you a cult and man followers
[1:34:10] any of these things they want to you
[1:34:12] know what happened you know who you were
[1:34:14] and who you are now you knew what it was
[1:34:17] like when that message came off the
[1:34:19] pages and into your hearts that's what
[1:34:23] we need around the message is
[1:34:25] eyewitnesses a man there's hardly
[1:34:27] anybody left alive that wasn't as an
[1:34:29] eyewitness to what God did through
[1:34:31] brother Branham but we've still got
[1:34:32] witnesses in this bride a man a man
[1:34:35] never met the Prophet but they meant the
[1:34:37] one that was with that prophet they met
[1:34:40] that pillar of fire amen
[1:34:46] eyewitnesses of a Living Word Bible says
[1:34:49] we all with open face are beholding in a
[1:34:52] glass amen
[1:34:54] beholding in a glass the glory of the
[1:34:56] Lord now that's a mirror
[1:35:00] you're beholding the glory of the Lord
[1:35:02] in a mirror amen and and now and we're
[1:35:07] but now as we behold as it's revealed
[1:35:10] now for them back for Paul it was dark
[1:35:14] amen but see we've got a little more
[1:35:16] light so we're seeing a little more
[1:35:18] clearly and as the picture becomes more
[1:35:20] clear the Bible says we're beholding in
[1:35:23] a glass the glory of the Lord and we are
[1:35:24] changed into the same image from glory
[1:35:28] to glory by the Spirit of the Lord by
[1:35:34] the Spirit of the Lord that's why I want
[1:35:37] the moving of the Spirit amen not just
[1:35:39] to feel those emotions which I love
[1:35:41] which are wonderful but I want to be
[1:35:44] changed into this image Amen when I feed
[1:35:47] on this message I hope you're feeding on
[1:35:49] this message amen I want to feed on it
[1:35:52] until I begin to change
[1:35:54] begin to see that chain I began to see
[1:35:56] that glory begin to appear when I look
[1:35:59] into that mirror not looking at the
[1:36:01] flesh but just enough light that I could
[1:36:03] see what's in the inside amen if you oh
[1:36:07] if all your religion isn't bringing a
[1:36:09] change in your life it's all in vain
[1:36:11] it's all in vain believe this message
[1:36:13] fifty years if you want to if it never
[1:36:15] changed you Amen you might as well been
[1:36:17] on a barstool amen amen you in a hurry
[1:36:22] this morning I want you to know that
[1:36:24] there is a Antichrist spirit working
[1:36:26] amongst the churches today brother
[1:36:28] Graham said there was a last plague
[1:36:29] coming it was a plague of spiritual
[1:36:31] death it's a pale horse rider
[1:36:34] now that horse isn't riding against the
[1:36:36] Catholics he's not riding against the
[1:36:38] Pentecostals he's already killed them
[1:36:40] but that pale horse rider is riding
[1:36:43] against the bride of Jesus Christ he
[1:36:45] would like nothing better than to put
[1:36:46] you in a message pill and keep you as
[1:36:49] dead and starchy informal and worldly as
[1:36:52] he can get you and make you think that
[1:36:54] because you belong to a church because
[1:36:57] you associate with the message because
[1:36:59] you've got a real good pastor that
[1:37:02] everything's all right amen but brother
[1:37:04] oh my I'm so glad that spirits not going
[1:37:08] to deceive the elect it's so deceitful
[1:37:10] that it can sit right next to you're a
[1:37:13] true believer amen and you can't tell
[1:37:16] the difference but today we're in
[1:37:17] manifesting time amen and those seeds
[1:37:19] are beginning to be revealed that's why
[1:37:21] many people have fallen away from this
[1:37:22] message amen because they couldn't just
[1:37:24] compromise and sit on the edge anymore
[1:37:26] but it's getting tighter and tighter
[1:37:28] amen but somebody somebody's gonna leave
[1:37:33] this thing somebody's gonna live this
[1:37:35] message
[1:37:37] a man not just be a church member I tell
[1:37:40] you there's no salvation in the
[1:37:41] association of the message there's no
[1:37:44] salvation in the name of object offer or
[1:37:47] Nathan Eric cent or or William Branham
[1:37:50] but there's one name given under heaven
[1:37:52] whereby men may be saying the only way
[1:37:55] to be identified by that name is not to
[1:37:58] have a picture on the wall amen but to
[1:38:01] have that image of his glory refill on
[1:38:05] the inside the tabernacle deity of God
[1:38:11] Dan is not in heaven it's in yo
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:18] hallelujah oh Christ is in his breath

[1:38:23] tabernacle of his presence a man that
[1:38:25] Shekinah glory that presence amen the
[1:38:28] message that came to us was Christ a
[1:38:31] person hallelujah
[1:38:36] hey man amen hey man it's the message
[1:38:41] the message isn't things that happen
[1:38:44] wonderful things that happen 50 60 years
[1:38:47] ago I love hunting stories but the
[1:38:50] messages and hunting stories it's not
[1:38:53] all these things brother oh why did God
[1:38:56] sent a prophet you ever ask yourself
[1:38:57] that question
[1:38:58] you know I this this is some real to me
[1:39:01] because I told you I was raised in the
[1:39:03] message and spent about 20 years on a
[1:39:05] message Pew before I ever asked myself
[1:39:07] the question what is the message
[1:39:10] a man cuz to me it was a lifestyle and
[1:39:15] it was traditions and it was the
[1:39:17] Association of churches it was certain
[1:39:19] things that we were taught certain
[1:39:20] doctrines that we hold dear that's all
[1:39:23] that it was to me hey man but I'm so
[1:39:25] glad for that light
[1:39:27] a man that would reveal who it was that
[1:39:29] was speaking me through that prophet a
[1:39:31] man who it was and what it was that he
[1:39:34] had pre decimated me to be amen
[1:39:36] I don't believe in and in taking this
[1:39:39] message amen and just put it on a
[1:39:41] pedestal you know
[1:39:42] and you can you can sit there at home a
[1:39:44] week after week day after day and play
[1:39:46] it over and over and over and over and
[1:39:48] over and over and over and over again
[1:39:49] amen and you know all you'll ever hear
[1:39:51] is your own opinion bouncing back and
[1:39:53] forth most the time amen but see I
[1:39:55] believe in a message that lives that's
[1:39:58] why I believe in a fivefold ministry
[1:39:59] that's why I believe in coming to church
[1:40:01] that's why I believe in Peter I want a
[1:40:04] Living Word a man not some dead letter
[1:40:07] amen you got it figured out here it's
[1:40:10] the spirit and the truth in this
[1:40:13] Tabernacle hallelujah all right
[1:40:17] amen because that's what the message
[1:40:20] came to produce we're not trying to take
[1:40:22] it and twist it into something else

[1:40:30] amen you say well I don't believe that
[1:40:32] well 1964 brother Brown said of you God

[1:40:41] church that's so completely anointed

[1:41:14] is where we're living today its Christ
[1:41:16] in you the hope of glory that great
[1:41:19] mystery amen amen I think we might have
[1:41:21] to come back over some of these things
[1:41:22] at another time because I really want to
[1:41:24] dig into that but but see so don't let
[1:41:27] anybody take your place don't let it
[1:41:31] don't leave it for somebody else to feed
[1:41:32] on this message don't move it for
[1:41:34] somebody else to have it reveal you know
[1:41:36] I got we got to a place where people
[1:41:38] have taken it things in a fanaticism
[1:41:40] they take the message you know the
[1:41:41] preach Perugia preached seven thunders
[1:41:42] appreciate for false doctrines and
[1:41:44] things like that or and do all these
[1:41:46] things it's made people almost swear
[1:41:47] they don't wanna oh we don't want to
[1:41:49] preach the deep things we don't wanna
[1:41:52] you know we don't need all those
[1:41:53] mysteries and things like that we just
[1:41:55] need you know let's just preach baptism
[1:41:56] the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal
[1:41:58] blessing things like well then what
[1:41:59] would separate us from the Pentecostal
[1:42:01] church amen but see we've been given
[1:42:03] something more than what they had but
[1:42:05] let me tell you brother sister the deep
[1:42:07] things is a scare word of the devil it's
[1:42:10] nothing about a scarecrow there are no
[1:42:12] mysteries left in this word Amen all my
[1:42:16] because a prophet came and the mysteries
[1:42:18] of previously hidden truth but today
[1:42:20] it's been revealed to a bride Amen it's
[1:42:23] not deep it's not complicated it is open
[1:42:26] and available to every anointed child of
[1:42:29] God I don't care how young you are how
[1:42:31] old you are
[1:42:32] Amen oh my I don't care if somebody who
[1:42:34] called himself a teacher came and tried
[1:42:36] to open it up and left you more confused
[1:42:37] than when he started
[1:42:38] hey man there is a real word that is
[1:42:40] avail this message is for you all right
[1:42:44] I can't hold it back this is your land
[1:42:46] Joshua don't you know Moses my servant
[1:42:49] is dead he's dead amen
[1:42:52] now they're waiting for him to come back
[1:42:54] but he ain't coming back but don't worry
[1:42:56] Joshua as I was with Moses so I am
[1:43:02] but if you want to take the land now
[1:43:06] then you've got to remember the word of
[1:43:09] Moses don't look to the left don't look
[1:43:13] to the right but look at this word don't
[1:43:16] get on the television no don't go to
[1:43:19] joel osteen don't look for the
[1:43:21] charismatic don't look to the
[1:43:23] Pentecostals look to the word of my
[1:43:25] prophet and as I was with that prophet
[1:43:29] I'm gonna be with you and you're gonna
[1:43:30] take this land that's why I say because
[1:43:34] people you know you can preach you can
[1:43:36] preach that we got more than God sent a
[1:43:37] prophet you preach that all around the
[1:43:38] country if you want to and everybody
[1:43:40] will rejoice amen buddy kind of find out
[1:43:43] that a lot of times what I'm saying is
[1:43:45] not what they're hearing because what
[1:43:47] they're hearing is well we got more than
[1:43:48] God send a prophet that means my opinion
[1:43:50] has marriage that means I can take the
[1:43:53] message and the parts I don't like I can
[1:43:55] kind of Reason them out and do things
[1:43:56] that's not the way I'm going at it
[1:43:58] brother I've not gone further on from
[1:44:00] the message I've gone further in
[1:44:02] everything that William Branham
[1:44:05] prophesied I believe that I am part of
[1:44:08] that bride that's called the fulfillment
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:12] hallelujah where is the Lord God of
[1:44:16] Elijah amen
[1:44:19] where is the Lord God allow a Utah you
[1:44:21] know when when that great prophet Elijah
[1:44:23] was taken off the scene amen there was a
[1:44:26] little I show there that had followed
[1:44:28] that prophet he had followed him
[1:44:29] everywhere he went he listened to him he
[1:44:32] leaned on him that was his prophet and
[1:44:34] the line should type not an eight day
[1:44:36] messenger but he typed the bride of
[1:44:37] Jesus Christ
[1:44:38] a man and that bride when that prophet
[1:44:40] was taken off the scene he begun to
[1:44:42] go through a mourning period and again
[1:44:45] ago it began to cry out and say oh my
[1:44:48] father my father the chariots of Israel
[1:44:50] horsemen in there he was crying out God
[1:44:52] you took our prophet what are we gonna
[1:44:55] do now amen well they raised up a whole
[1:44:57] bunch of what they called the sons of
[1:44:59] the prophets the school the prophets
[1:45:00] they said well let's go look for him
[1:45:02] amen read the ante they're still looking
[1:45:04] for her
[1:45:05] a man they got a plane waiting for him
[1:45:07] and everything else they're looking for
[1:45:08] him to come back a man Elijah said will
[1:45:10] you go look for it if you want to but
[1:45:13] I'm gonna stay right here I'm gonna stay
[1:45:15] right here where he left me and I'm just
[1:45:17] gonna get to thinking about things
[1:45:19] you're gonna look for him I'm gonna sit
[1:45:22] and that mourning period came to an end
[1:45:24] and something came on the heart of
[1:45:26] Elijah a man until he began to read I
[1:45:28] remember when that prophet preached the
[1:45:31] mighty God unveiled I remember he
[1:45:34] preached to me the restoration of the
[1:45:36] bride tree I remember when he preached
[1:45:39] these things the masterpiece he preached
[1:45:41] about me he came and found me in that
[1:45:45] denominational field that I was in and
[1:45:47] he took the mantle of a pure word and he
[1:45:50] put it on my shoulders well he didn't
[1:45:52] fit me then amen but well I wonder what
[1:45:54] would happen if I took the word that
[1:45:56] prophet preached and just try it on one
[1:45:58] more time and he put it on he said hey
[1:46:01] that fits pretty good
[1:46:03] a man and something came on his heart a
[1:46:06] man when everyone else was looking for a
[1:46:08] prophet to come do it for him a man
[1:46:10] something came on the heart of Elijah
[1:46:12] where is the Lord God of Elijah and he
[1:46:15] took the mantle of that message it
[1:46:17] couldn't have been his mantle it
[1:46:19] couldn't bend his old his old hole or
[1:46:21] his old or his old rake or any of his
[1:46:23] old gardening implements he took the
[1:46:24] mantle of that word and he had the
[1:46:27] confidence to take it in his own hands
[1:46:29] and strike the water and a few ever
[1:46:32] brother/sister get to the place where
[1:46:34] you take this message for yourself take
[1:46:37] it into your hands realize that it's for
[1:46:39] you realize that the presence of Jesus
[1:46:41] Christ is for you realize you are the
[1:46:42] tabernacle of his presence today realize
[1:46:45] that Christ working through a bride
[1:46:46] today strike the water and one of these
[1:46:51] days we're gonna take that word a man
[1:46:56] will strike it so pure that bride will
[1:47:00] say it just like he said it the spirit
[1:47:03] and the prophet and the bride saying the
[1:47:04] same thing and the River Jordan old part

[1:47:10] be no more almost here brother sister

[1:51:29] formation of the bride that's to be
[1:51:33] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:51:35] living let's stand you know in the Old
[1:51:39] Testament they had that tabernacle the
[1:51:44] God came and spoke through his prophet
[1:51:45] he said if you want to worship me you've
[1:51:49] got to come and worship me in the place
[1:51:51] where I've hidden my name you'll find
[1:51:55] that God's provide a place in other
[1:51:58] words where I've put my nature his name
[1:52:00] is his nature his life and he hides it
[1:52:03] in the earth
[1:52:04] and if you want to worship me said
[1:52:05] you've got to come to that place where
[1:52:07] I've hidden my name brother sister his
[1:52:08] name's not behind badger skins today
[1:52:11] amen it's not being expressed through
[1:52:14] that Jesus that walked the shores of
[1:52:16] Galilee amen his name isn't being
[1:52:18] revealed it's not being preached by a
[1:52:21] prophet today named William Branham but
[1:52:26] he's hidden himself in a bride that's
[1:52:29] called by his name now if you want to
[1:52:32] worship Him that's where you've got to
[1:52:34] approach him if this world wants to come
[1:52:36] to God they've got to come through you

[1:52:41] maybe we'll deal with it more Lord
[1:52:42] willing but I want you to see now you

[1:52:52] it's a life amen amen he wants to hide
[1:52:55] himself in you in this world so that
[1:52:57] everybody who comes in contact with you
[1:52:59] has an opportunity to come to Christ now
[1:53:02] that won't work with your opinions it
[1:53:05] won't work with your ideas you know it's
[1:53:09] so glorious it's more it's a more
[1:53:12] glorious thing that we could ever hope
[1:53:14] for on this earth that we could never
[1:53:17] hope to achieve something so great not
[1:53:20] even a Pope or a priest could could
[1:53:23] could hope to truly fulfill this
[1:53:26] ministry oh but it's worth everything
[1:53:29] amen and that's so I'm what I'm asking
[1:53:31] you this morning
[1:53:32] what is it worth to you to be that
[1:53:34] temple to be that tabernacle to have
[1:53:37] that that name of God that nature of God
[1:53:39] hidden up in you to be called by his
[1:53:41] name identified with that message to be
[1:53:43] that pride to me it's worth all my hopes
[1:53:46] my dreams my ambitions my desires
[1:53:50] maybe somebody by lifted hand and say I
[1:53:51] I want to surrender all that I am to
[1:53:54] this i lord I want to be your temple

[1:54:10] morning Lord I want to be that temple I
[1:54:12] want to be that Tabernacle Lord and it's

[1:54:18] would hinder Lord I give it all to you
[1:54:21] Lord for this glory the sufferings of
[1:54:24] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:54:26] compared Lord I pray as we're entering
[1:54:28] into this weekend Lord when the message
[1:54:30] is going to be preached Lord with power
[1:54:32] and demonstration that father we would
[1:54:34] just empty everything out Lord and
[1:54:36] become an empty house Lord

[1:54:40] I pray O God may every heart make a
[1:54:43] consecration Lord in their own way in
[1:54:46] their own heart to you Lord we offer up
[1:54:48] all that we are all that we have Oh
[1:54:51] all that we ever will be Lord is yours
[1:54:53] it's only by your grace Lord there's no
[1:54:56] flesh here that wants to glory in your
[1:54:58] presence Lord but the glory is yours
[1:55:00] then the glory then the power then the
[1:55:04] kingdom Lord we dedicate this temple now

[1:55:13] be with you we certainly appreciate the
[1:55:28] Lord Jesus and how he's used our
[1:55:31] precious brother this morning I couldn't
[1:55:34] think of a more fitting message to start
[1:55:37] meetings off with what would it be if we
[1:55:42] went through all the fasting on the
[1:55:43] prayer all the preparation
[1:55:48] and if God himself did not come down
[1:55:50] then Phyllis people sacrifices that you
[1:55:54] all made to get here many have spent my
[1:55:56] money just to get here but we want God
[1:56:00] to come down and fill his people I want
[1:56:05] to encourage your church as we approach
[1:56:07] these the next few services of
[1:56:11] everything let's let's approach it they
[1:56:12] met with the reverence respect that we
[1:56:15] want God to do something special for us
[1:56:16] and then I believe he'll meet us here is
[1:56:20] our just absolutely blessed so so
[1:56:22] blessed I'm still in this statement we
[1:56:25] have not gone further on from the
[1:56:28] message we've gone further in
[1:56:32] I'm stealing that not further on we're
[1:56:38] going further in and starting to
[1:56:40] recognize who we are I'm Lou you that's
[1:56:43] what the whole thing was all about right
[1:56:45] and he's talking about you didn't even
[1:56:46] leave a hole in a glass darkly now is
[1:56:49] see you know we're now is starting to
[1:56:50] see some things just becoming more clear
[1:56:52] to us you know when
[1:56:59] Abraham says humble servant Eliezer
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:04] eleazar's responsibility was to go and
[1:57:07] get a bride for Isaac Eliezer was not to
[1:57:12] try to convince a man Rebekah to follow
[1:57:18] but Elie's was trying to get him to you
[1:57:21] know didn't recognize the hey there's
[1:57:23] something great a bit beyond me and when
[1:57:25] you get there you'll see what I'm
[1:57:26] talking about this was not about trying
[1:57:30] to just follow brother branham that's
[1:57:32] anytime you hear saying and I've seen
[1:57:34] this recently we're not here trying to
[1:57:35] exalt a prophet but understand then what
[1:57:37] God did through the Prophet is extremely
[1:57:40] important it's talking on the phone with
[1:57:42] her precious brother and we were talking
[1:57:43] about Joshua and Moses and you know and
[1:57:46] when when the Bible said Moses my
[1:57:49] servant is dead right but he also told
[1:57:52] job Joshua this book of the law
[1:57:56] shall not depart we're out of your mouth
[1:58:00] so I'm sure Joshua was saying just like
[1:58:03] brother Nicholas and the Prophet says
[1:58:05] brother Branham said in Joshua's day he
[1:58:09] would have said Moses say in our day got
[1:58:16] to know where you act bless do you know
[1:58:23] but he got today just it was all in it
[1:58:25] brother but I but he got he got to
[1:58:27] talking about Aaron some of us might be
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:34] these terms that people use it well we
[1:58:38] go back and look at the story of Mary
[1:58:40] when the angel moved her with the word
[1:58:43] and he he pronounced and announced
[1:58:46] something that had never been done
[1:58:48] before if she said she said what matter
[1:58:51] of salutation but she kept having a
[1:58:59] conversation if you wonder what tackler
