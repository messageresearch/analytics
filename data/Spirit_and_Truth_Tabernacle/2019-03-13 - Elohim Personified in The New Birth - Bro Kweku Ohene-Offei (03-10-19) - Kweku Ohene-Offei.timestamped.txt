[32:24] [Music]
[32:28] she was mentioning about the food
[32:30] yesterday and want you all to just
[32:33] continue to keep sister Verna and her
[32:36] family her uncle a man who she brought
[32:42] the church just right there before
[32:43] Christmas if think it was a week before
[32:46] the Sunday before Christmas every time
[32:51] he comes
[32:51] elder Jameson of Jimerson I always kind
[32:55] of share the testimony I walk into his
[32:57] church one one Saturday afternoon
[33:00] Saturday afternoon they were playing the
[33:03] fiddle and burning hell and I remember
[33:07] seeing that and seeing what hell was
[33:09] gonna be like
[33:10] [Music]
[33:19] out of fear you know God don't serve
[33:22] them like that out of fear but uh but we
[33:24] went and you know it's just something
[33:26] that planted a seed in my heart and I
[33:29] always give a lot of credit to that man
[33:31] doing that that night they're just
[33:33] things starting to get me to where I am
[33:36] today and I'm very grateful after that
[33:39] so keep up keep her family in prayer he
[33:41] went home to be with the Lord he was at
[33:43] his penis and you know and he's just a
[33:46] real precious man every life that he
[33:48] could pretty much come in contact with
[33:50] he touched her some some some way so
[33:53] keep up keep the family prayer in there
[33:56] Daniel awesome I was there
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] family members was speaking to me and he
[34:03] made a comment to me setup said the
[34:06] young the only thing is bending between
[34:10] your prayer being prayed and God
[34:14] providing the answers to that prayer he
[34:16] said because you know doctor do it say
[34:18] but only things down in between that is
[34:20] your level of patience and I said
[34:25] there's a prophecy of what but I say
[34:28] what wisdom because oftentimes when
[34:31] we're waiting something from the Lord if
[34:33] you don't come in on time we try to help
[34:35] remind right I know I'm guilty of that
[34:38] that's why I can say that because I'm
[34:40] guilty of it but my prayers a lord
[34:43] helped me to receive but instead to me
[34:45] there a man that just just be patient
[34:47] kind of under control then God and
[34:50] everything under control
[34:53] when God is given some teeth and God has
[34:55] given something to you
[34:57] you ain't got a worry buddy
[34:59] you gotta fret about it you just you
[35:02] just wait on it you just wait on hey man
[35:05] can I can I just read y'all a scripture
[35:08] this just my scripture a man this my
[35:11] scripture that I there's something that
[35:14] I'm holding on to and then we don't
[35:18] forget the announcements and everything
[35:20] else and very just praise the Lord
[35:29] and
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] it's gonna be in the Book of Jeremiah
[35:42] three
[35:45] and we just violently
[35:50] I always get this mixed up I know it's
[35:54] in Jeremiah neither gotta find it here
[35:57] reduce and then I will service Jeremiah
[36:02] 32
[36:04] Jeremiah 3241 Jeremiah 32 and 41
[36:11] so what God gave me that bastard and
[36:14] shared with me that the only thing
[36:16] standing between my prayer being
[36:19] answered
[36:20] for every answer is just my level of
[36:23] patience and then think on the scripture
[36:26] baba says yay I will rejoice over them
[36:30] to do them and I will plant them in this
[36:36] assuredly with my heart and with my
[36:41] whole suit that's old in old today I
[36:44] don't want to get ahead of god I'm gonna
[36:46] get too far in front of a man I just
[36:48] want to just patiently wait for him to
[36:50] fulfill what he promised a man that's
[36:53] for our new church in school hey man we
[36:56] put that script to right in front of us
[36:58] say man so he's saying I'm plan us a man
[37:01] surely and all we got to do it just
[37:03] waiting he'll do it he's gonna be Joe
[37:05] solar so do as good without blaming us
[37:07] assuredly so that's what he said if he
[37:10] said it then he'll bring in two pence
[37:13] let's go with we have some announcements
[37:15] that I just need to make mention of a
[37:17] man and I got a a prayer request and
[37:21] will also appear for this morning's

[38:11] moussaka from Paris will be preaching
[38:13] there and won't be chill tonight and
[38:16] we'll be starting our corporate fast a
[38:19] man we don't want to miss quality data
[38:22] fast because I want to give everybody
[38:24] the freedom to just do you know a lot
[38:28] with each or some might wanna do the
[38:29] data fast that's perfectly fine some may
[38:33] want to just pass like
[38:34] today maybe three o'clock or something
[38:37] like that
[38:38] you know and still want to eat what you
[38:40] don't leave a just fans some may want to
[38:42] do some you know some other types of
[38:44] faster soda juice only fast and you know
[38:46] whatever whatever way the Lord leads you
[38:48] we want to want you to be free to do
[38:50] that but we just want everybody to be
[38:52] involved in some type of fasting for
[38:54] those 21 days up to a man right before
[38:58] Easter our Easter services don't forget
[39:01] when this when that's coming
[39:03] and our services will have our Good
[39:05] Friday service with standard night
[39:07] service we will have a sunrise service
[39:10] we won't have prayer that morning of
[39:12] your sunrise service and then our
[39:14] regular service oh no I'm stunned once
[39:16] it happened during Easter but we try to
[39:18] do this amen every every year right
[39:22] before Easter
[39:22] 21 days we do it when they fast now the
[39:26] other thing the reason I was pretty is
[39:28] because everybody should be involved
[39:30] right when when Esther went forward and
[39:36] the King she asked for the entire nation
[39:39] to go on a fancy right she knew how
[39:41] serious this matter was and she said
[39:44] with everybody please just fast at least
[39:47] for three days for me right and I and
[39:49] I'm not saying don't eat no food for 41
[39:52] days eat just fast
[39:55] if you do Dania fast you can eat all the
[39:57] time you just don't eat sweets and meats
[39:59] and treats and things like that but uh
[40:02] but you know justjust just try to find
[40:04] something that that will agree with your
[40:06] body and you know you say well my
[40:09] brother Jack I can't do it doctor doctor
[40:11] when the doctor when the doctor the man
[40:15] and the doctor asked people to fast you
[40:18] know they don't have that well Yes
[40:19] Doctor
[40:20] yes you can really have a serger they
[40:22] want you to fast before the surgery
[40:24] right you can't go in there where the
[40:25] food's coming and you have no problem
[40:27] you don't tell doctor my Medicaid so if
[40:31] God asks you to use the doctor all
[40:33] doctors all right so when he actions to
[40:35] do it everybody should be involved in
[40:37] Korver fans everybody finds something
[40:40] fast it's a part of our Christian a man
[40:43] to only do as Christians the action
[40:46] burrito Scripture Jesus saved Winky fast
[40:50] so jesus knew that we were gonna do it
[40:52] it sometimes I say wait you fast do it
[40:55] this way so so we know that this is a
[40:57] part of what Christians do when we want
[40:58] to do that so 21 days before Easter
[41:01] we'll get started and then start March
[41:03] 29th
[41:04] one through April 18th
[41:07] nice little celebration and then we'll
[41:10] do our Easter services but the week
[41:12] after that we're gonna have a church
[41:14] picnic we will give you more information
[41:15] about that but that'll be April 27th so
[41:18] put that on your calendar when we
[41:19] haven't having a church pick
[41:22] also I wish happy birthdays - sister hot

[54:01] become life and becomes we thank you for

[54:15] in Jesus Christ in me free the Lord is
[54:27] good amen
[54:29] whenever the Lord it's been wonderful
[54:31] that the word each and every word
[54:34] there's actually only one free travel
[54:35] jack that features Jesus Christ because
[54:39] I've been looking at the continuity of
[54:41] the messages over the time that has been
[54:43] coming one will break into another to
[54:46] break into another to break into another
[54:47] and be coming I mean I don't know how to
[54:51] describe it
[54:51] whatever I'm said that the Word of God
[54:53] is like a roman candle when you you
[54:56] light one it explode and bring forth
[54:59] another candle it explode so I want to
[55:01] find out what is special about candle
[55:03] because we know candles when they Bend
[55:04] they kind of get consumed so what kind
[55:07] of candle does it you light it any
[55:09] breeze fold into another candle and
[55:11] another candle so when I read it look at
[55:14] a roman candle is not that Canada we use
[55:16] it's like an explosion something has got
[55:18] an explosive like a fishing bump when
[55:21] you throw one it was split and goes into
[55:23] a cascade of reaction and that is the
[55:26] word of God I was looking at the word of
[55:27] God from their brothers brother Dwayne
[55:30] but a Nathan rather poor but I Israel
[55:33] but a jack brother brother Jerry is
[55:37] where does add a little meeting the way
[55:39] it jumps into one another breaking from
[55:41] one another to one another and so under
[55:44] for how the law does say Amen because if
[55:47] the Holy Ghost is not a man
[55:48] because when God was delivered by Jack
[55:51] the other brothers were not they but the
[55:53] message was just breaking into one
[55:55] another
[55:56] it is wonderful man glory hallelujah I'm

[1:00:18] chapter 8 so when he was so when he
[1:00:23] didn't know the Lord when he was quaking
[1:00:25] he thought he was doing at a service of
[1:00:27] course had a mental knowledge of great
[1:00:30] Elohim the god of Moses who appeared to
[1:00:32] Moses who was in order prophet and his
[1:00:34] other people speaking something contrary
[1:00:36] to what he knew so he began to persecute
[1:00:39] them drag them to - I mean to their
[1:00:41] death and do whatever he wanted and one
[1:00:44] day a pillar of I appeared to him and a
[1:00:46] voice came from this light it says sauce
[1:00:49] so why do you persecute me
[1:00:50] and right away he began to realize that
[1:00:53] oh I thought I was going drink at a
[1:00:55] service God is speaking
[1:00:58] contrary to the law of Moses they were
[1:01:01] breaking the laws they were breaking the
[1:01:02] Sabbath so I was dragging them to court
[1:01:05] and killing them and persecuting them
[1:01:06] Lord I was the US service he said
[1:01:08] persecuting me Amen because they are me
[1:01:11] amen and I am them amen
[1:01:15] that is the same Elohim the same god of
[1:01:18] Moses the same God of Abraham the same
[1:01:21] God of Noah who has come down in the
[1:01:24] skin of his people amen
[1:01:26] so when you touch them you touch me the
[1:01:29] grid I am glory hallelujah and that
[1:01:33] message did something to brother Paul he
[1:01:34] turned from Saul to Paul he became a new
[1:01:37] man amen a brand new man in Jesus Christ
[1:01:40] and that is what we're gonna talk about
[1:01:42] we're gonna talk about Elohim
[1:01:44] personified the new birth amen Elohim
[1:01:49] personified and I try to look at a word
[1:01:51] personified it comes from the word
[1:01:53] person to impersonate to epitomize to
[1:02:00] embody to incan it to come in a human
[1:02:04] form so Elohim coming in human form is
[1:02:07] what he called the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:02:09] the new breath revelation of Christ is
[1:02:13] not something mysterious but it's a real
[1:02:16] person God Himself Elohim gritty turn
[1:02:20] add a few funny coming down picking your
[1:02:23] cysteine element my cysteine element and
[1:02:25] manifesting himself amen now let's take
[1:02:29] the human body and break it down because
[1:02:31] that is a thing that we know this human
[1:02:34] body that we see is just a lot of piece
[1:02:36] of earth amen it doesn't amount to
[1:02:38] nothing is made up of sitting element
[1:02:41] limbs if I can try to name them we are
[1:02:43] made up of cosmic lights and calcium
[1:02:47] Leblon just see if I can go in order
[1:02:50] amen we have cysteine element which is a
[1:02:53] cosmic cosmic light Bram said we are
[1:02:55] petroleum Petaluma has got four elements
[1:02:57] carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen so
[1:03:01] that is the first four elements then
[1:03:03] we've got some ions we've got some
[1:03:06] sodium we've got potassium we've got ion
[1:03:10] a magnesium calcium manganese then we
[1:03:14] got some negative ions as well that is
[1:03:16] the chlorine fluorine sofa and
[1:03:19] phosphorus iodine
[1:03:21] that is why sometimes student can be
[1:03:23] anemic when you anemic they give you
[1:03:25] pregnant women when when they pregnant
[1:03:26] they give them ion because it's part of
[1:03:29] the element of the body now when you
[1:03:31] take this body's about 65 to 85 percent
[1:03:34] water so when you bend somebody who is
[1:03:36] about six foot tall and as much as with
[1:03:40] a cigar when you bend a person is going
[1:03:42] to remain about just a spoonful of ashes
[1:03:45] that is what we can amount to as human
[1:03:47] beings
[1:03:47] the rest is gases the cannafest put and
[1:03:50] go back to the world to the cosmos so on
[1:03:52] the human side we are just one spoonful
[1:03:55] of ash that is what we are with it
[1:03:58] doesn't matter how much we clean this
[1:03:59] body it doesn't matter how handsome or
[1:04:01] how beautiful you are it doesn't matter
[1:04:03] how ugly you are
[1:04:04] that is about just one spoonful of ash
[1:04:06] that is all we amount you when you go to
[1:04:09] Asia India you know the about 2 billion
[1:04:12] 1 billion people so they don't have
[1:04:14] enough leads to bury people so when they
[1:04:16] die the increment and they bend them and
[1:04:18] they just put your ash in a battle for
[1:04:20] your grandkids and great-grandkids to
[1:04:22] come and not look at it though does just
[1:04:24] my grandad my great-great granddad one
[1:04:27] spoonful of ash so nothing that is the
[1:04:33] sister element we are made up of now
[1:04:35] when car let's go back to the man of God
[1:04:37] the Lord before the foundation of the
[1:04:39] world
[1:04:39] you are not cysteine element before the
[1:04:41] foundation of the world where Christ
[1:04:43] amen you were part of Elohim you were a
[1:04:47] China you are not a human flesh you were
[1:04:50] not asked you a celestial body you were
[1:04:53] a person before the foundation of what
[1:04:56] you existed not in this physical flesh
[1:04:58] but the celestial fish flesh amen that's
[1:05:02] luscious a person it has a voice is what
[1:05:06] body just like you it doesn't grow old
[1:05:09] it doesn't get tired it doesn't get
[1:05:11] confused it doesn't get attacked it
[1:05:14] doesn't scream it doesn't it can't get
[1:05:16] sick it cannot even die that is the true
[1:05:19] you amen so let's read some reboot of
[1:05:23] the scriptures let's read some quotes
[1:05:24] here to look at something here let's go
[1:05:27] to the church age book this man in
[1:05:33] charge
[1:05:34] an exposition of the seven th ages
[1:05:36] Desmond in church in book Nabu Brahma
[1:05:39] has given us the difference between the
[1:05:41] thought of God and our thoughts
[1:05:43] sometimes we can think of something
[1:05:44] let's say you want to go to Miami
[1:05:46] is it a which we can use is the i-90 95
[1:05:49] south north south so you your plan is
[1:05:53] got your GPS everything go go you've map
[1:05:55] out I'm going to iron on i-95 south to
[1:05:58] Miami now you get there there was a
[1:06:00] student so they block the hole of i-95
[1:06:02] now what do you do probably can use a
[1:06:04] local essence I don't know they had
[1:06:05] local SS here you have to reroute to
[1:06:07] somewhere else so your thought didn't
[1:06:10] manifest because of what condition of
[1:06:13] let's say accidental road block that is
[1:06:15] your thought and my thought but that is
[1:06:17] not a thought of God Lord Elohim has got
[1:06:20] only one thought that is Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] and nothing stood before his thoughts
[1:06:25] his thought is he and amen so let's go
[1:06:29] to the reading it it a not thought of
[1:06:32] God is there now watch carefully before
[1:06:35] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[1:06:36] before God was God Elohim was Elohim God
[1:06:40] is an object of adoration and no one was
[1:06:43] there to worship him so he was at that
[1:06:45] time only potentially God he was only
[1:06:48] known as attend a spirit the bride was
[1:06:50] already in his mind and let's see the
[1:06:53] man of God yes she was she was assisting
[1:06:57] in his thoughts and what about those
[1:06:59] thought of God they are Atena are they
[1:07:02] not the eternal thought of God let me
[1:07:06] ask you at the thought of God it Atena
[1:07:08] if you can see this you see many things
[1:07:11] God is unchangeable in both essence and
[1:07:14] behavior we have studied that and
[1:07:16] proving that already God is infinite and
[1:07:19] his abilities
[1:07:20] so therefore he as God must be
[1:07:23] omniscient he if his omniscient then is
[1:07:26] not now Lenin he doesn't add to his
[1:07:28] knowledge no is he taking counsel avail
[1:07:31] himself nor is he at any time adding to
[1:07:34] his knowledge if he can add it to
[1:07:36] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[1:07:38] then he's not omniscient he doesn't know
[1:07:40] all things the best we could say is that
[1:07:43] sometime he will be that is in the
[1:07:45] future
[1:07:46] that is not Scripture he is only seeing
[1:07:49] he has never had a new thought about
[1:07:51] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:07:53] already had and always who have and
[1:07:56] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:07:58] he's God
[1:07:59] amen that's the thought of God are
[1:08:02] eternal they are real they are not
[1:08:06] simple like a man with the blueprints
[1:08:08] that he has drawn up and which one day
[1:08:10] will be translated into substance and
[1:08:12] form but they are already real an
[1:08:14] antenna and a part of God amen
[1:08:17] so the thought of God is not just like a
[1:08:20] thinking something you have imagined
[1:08:21] here the thought of God is a substance
[1:08:24] the thought of God is the logos what is
[1:08:26] the logos the loco si did feel funny
[1:08:29] it is Elohim himself amen before you
[1:08:32] drop into the flesh you were a tenor you
[1:08:35] didn't even know what is and what isn't
[1:08:36] you didn't know about it what is
[1:08:39] salvation you don't know about it just
[1:08:41] like somebody who's never been to
[1:08:43] hospital before is always already always
[1:08:45] had a perfect health
[1:08:46] it doesn't know about the injection
[1:08:48] taking medication it's a mystery to that
[1:08:50] person so in that thought in that
[1:08:53] dimension you were perfect beyond even
[1:08:55] perfect so he didn't know what about
[1:08:58] Redemption we didn't understand so do la
[1:08:59] so don't worry
[1:09:00] one day I'm going to send you to the
[1:09:01] earth and you can understand Redemption
[1:09:03] so he sent Adam to the earth and jump in
[1:09:07] Adam he began to manifest himself the
[1:09:09] Lord tasted the earth he was worshipped
[1:09:11] he became God angels were worshiping him
[1:09:13] but he had more attribute of a severe of
[1:09:15] a redeemer of a king of a friend of a
[1:09:19] brother of a sister of a pasta but it
[1:09:21] was nothing there was no need at that
[1:09:23] time to manifest so he was only worship
[1:09:25] and having fellowship with Adam now to
[1:09:28] make him a Savior something has to be
[1:09:31] lost
[1:09:31] amen so he created man in a way he began
[1:09:36] to steadily me go back to electricity he
[1:09:38] wanted to have fellowship
[1:09:39] take literacy I don't know where we get
[1:09:41] a power house from I don't know here but
[1:09:43] then back in Ghana I know we get
[1:09:45] electricity from water and when you go
[1:09:47] to the power station if you try to get
[1:09:50] into it it will fry you and roast you
[1:09:53] and twist you so you can do that if you
[1:09:56] said I'm going to charge my cell phone
[1:09:57] take your cell phone you go to the power
[1:09:59] see
[1:09:59] and you want to connect it you're gonna
[1:10:01] get fried you're gonna get twisted so
[1:10:04] it's not gonna happen now this same
[1:10:07] electricity they bring it in the
[1:10:08] allotted Transformers in a high voltage
[1:10:11] if it's ok I'm going to check my click
[1:10:14] my cell phone or my my laptop on the big
[1:10:17] high voltage you're gonna get roasted
[1:10:19] and fried it's not gonna happen you
[1:10:22] can't do that
[1:10:23] okay this step it down further even to
[1:10:25] the powerhouse so it's a rocky I'm gonna
[1:10:28] charge my battery gonna cook my right
[1:10:30] take your rice cooker go to the power
[1:10:31] house I want to cook my rice here maybe
[1:10:34] the press could ask you I would want to
[1:10:35] say goodbye to the world if you plug it
[1:10:39] is gonna fry you a roost you and toast
[1:10:41] you
[1:10:41] but then the same electricity one day
[1:10:43] step it down to hear what 110 voltage in
[1:10:48] a British day you said to 220 now you
[1:10:50] can plug in your cell phones cook your
[1:10:53] rice do stuff do order you want use it
[1:10:55] for the organ and the instrument the
[1:10:58] same with a great antenna in all the
[1:11:00] Elohim integrity antenna when he
[1:11:02] manifests himself the whole earth would
[1:11:04] be will be going to an elation to
[1:11:06] nothingness
[1:11:07] if the glory of the Lord comes now he
[1:11:10] want to you want to generate this earth
[1:11:12] will be cooked are we or the planet or
[1:11:15] the universe could be splashed into
[1:11:18] nothingness that is how big he is so
[1:11:23] enough form there's not me can't even
[1:11:26] job into a human being
[1:11:27] look at even when in the time of Moses
[1:11:30] he came to us Elohim you can ask Jehovah
[1:11:33] Java means God with his family so he
[1:11:36] wanted to befriend a man so he stepped
[1:11:38] out even a lot of feather down and I
[1:11:40] appeared to Moose is the nature of
[1:11:41] Israel what happened it was is a Moses
[1:11:44] we cannot stand this because before he
[1:11:46] appears there was stand up it was so I
[1:11:51] mean so so horrible people were crying
[1:11:53] their faces down
[1:11:54] so Moises please go and talk to this
[1:11:58] guard and come and tell us because we
[1:12:01] can't stand it be good not that without
[1:12:02] Parrish
[1:12:03] so the lost are okay now I will come in
[1:12:05] the form of a prophet so he boarded a
[1:12:08] simple of fire murdered himself in a
[1:12:10] profit and job into Moses Moses
[1:12:13] acquainted with a pillar of fire on
[1:12:14] Mount Sinai and you come back his face
[1:12:17] the glory of the Lord shone in him even
[1:12:19] though one day they afterward cover
[1:12:21] Moses because the LOA the presence of
[1:12:23] Elohim was so glorious in him so they
[1:12:26] had to cover him to be able to speak to
[1:12:28] the trough Israel even has to step in
[1:12:30] software that down so the loss of our
[1:12:32] Moses you would have a prophet your
[1:12:35] brother Aaron will be a prophet so Moses
[1:12:37] who speak to the high priest Aaron then
[1:12:39] Aaron will step it down to the people I
[1:12:41] transform and now the people say ok the
[1:12:43] law said the Lord thy God is one don't
[1:12:46] have no other Idol ok yes Roger that in
[1:12:50] the military budget outside them do that
[1:12:53] so the Lord our God is holy do not
[1:12:56] contaminate yourself with idols Raja dad
[1:12:59] we salute you we're only taking the Lord
[1:13:02] is one God
[1:13:03] don't I mean love the Lord thy God with
[1:13:06] all thy heart and love your neighbor as
[1:13:08] yourself
[1:13:08] it's a Roger that I ticket Moses I
[1:13:10] believe it with all my heart so the
[1:13:13] logical step himself so down in a form
[1:13:15] of 110 voltage so that we cannot have
[1:13:18] connection with him glory hallelujah
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:28] blessed be the name of the Lord so but
[1:13:31] then in his attribute as a severe
[1:13:33] because if when nothing is lost so he
[1:13:36] has to bring in this guy called Lucifer
[1:13:39] sit and as we know him to bring
[1:13:42] something that could be redeemed to
[1:13:43] cause a fall so Satan is doing his job
[1:13:46] as he was Odin to do amen
[1:13:49] sedan is not only to bring to bring
[1:13:51] salvation no he was Odin to bring
[1:13:53] destruction death and so that the Lord
[1:13:56] Himself will bring word Redemption and
[1:13:58] healing and transformation amen
[1:14:00] so when we were born we were not born
[1:14:02] three people istic Adam he was born by
[1:14:04] the spoken word of God Adam didn't have
[1:14:06] a mother he was born from the mouth of
[1:14:08] God amen
[1:14:10] Adam began to stab himself down to Eve
[1:14:13] who was what a little bit lower than him
[1:14:16] he was part of the spoken word but not
[1:14:18] all written as cooking Word of God so he
[1:14:20] stepped in so down now the Lord was
[1:14:22] trying to achieve something and now they
[1:14:24] were supposed to bring for their
[1:14:25] children just like their father Elohim
[1:14:27] by the speaking of the way by the
[1:14:29] preaching of the way but then that is
[1:14:32] where the Lucifer the devil came in and
[1:14:34] introduced introduce what he called sex
[1:14:36] what is sex look at the spelling of sex
[1:14:38] x s e x s represents satan e represent
[1:14:44] if X represent cross sit and Eve cross
[1:14:48] so it's rough God crossing by the spoken
[1:14:53] word
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:08] praise be to God so so Satan cross with
[1:15:15] Eve and that changed the program kind of
[1:15:19] chin the program instead of crossing
[1:15:21] with a spoken word sit and cross with
[1:15:24] Eve because it means mother of all he
[1:15:28] was supposed to be the mother of only
[1:15:29] sons of Adam and the sons of God but now
[1:15:32] there was a cross crossing with Eve has
[1:15:34] introduced something beyond the original
[1:15:37] arena plan of God but is forward for
[1:15:40] redemption seek so sit and eat cross now
[1:15:43] what happened when Satan crossed with
[1:15:46] Eve it brought forward sin what is sin s
[1:15:49] I n s represents Satan I in and nature
[1:15:55] sittin is now in our nature that is the
[1:16:02] way he injected himself into this earth
[1:16:04] because he want to express himself just
[1:16:07] as God was expressing himself you go
[1:16:08] back to Isaiah said the devil kind of
[1:16:11] ruse himself trying to be even more than
[1:16:13] Christ so you also cross with Eve to be
[1:16:16] able to manifest himself but he didn't
[1:16:18] know he was fulfilling the law of God he
[1:16:20] didn't know that he was making their way
[1:16:21] forgot to be a savior he thought it was
[1:16:23] something against the Word of God but he
[1:16:25] was paving the way that great Elohim
[1:16:28] will become a savior who manifests
[1:16:30] attribute amen just like that just like
[1:16:34] a sick person when you go to the
[1:16:35] hospital the doctor is happy he went to
[1:16:38] medical schools got a lot of loans to be
[1:16:40] almost a million so when you go to even
[1:16:43] if you do have a tooth ache is going
[1:16:44] okay we gotta put these teeth they pull
[1:16:46] your teeth so that he can have dollars
[1:16:48] to pay a student loan
[1:16:51] so you give that dentist some time that
[1:16:53] doctors do procedures that uh knows I'm
[1:16:55] in America for that or what happens
[1:16:56] doctors and pharmacists and nurses do
[1:16:59] procedures that is not necessary but I
[1:17:02] need their money they need the money
[1:17:03] from your Medicare what if whatever care
[1:17:06] to take care to run a hospital to run
[1:17:08] their business so when you bring your
[1:17:10] business they are happy for you
[1:17:11] I've got his patient the ticket teeth is
[1:17:13] okay you got a grill it
[1:17:15] Nexxus man come back they do some
[1:17:16] cleaning what do you do you pay money
[1:17:18] come back every I got to change these
[1:17:20] teeth I got to put something there so
[1:17:22] that is to give me a job to do so Satan
[1:17:24] was making a way for God to be a savior
[1:17:26] without knowing blessed be the Lord amen
[1:17:34] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:17:37] the highest of heaven so now sit on has
[1:17:41] got himself in nature now let's go to
[1:17:43] the message praise be to God
[1:17:47] let's go to the nature sorry the message
[1:17:49] sauce that I in prison let me look at a
[1:17:52] flat graph so see imprisoned I think
[1:17:56] they have the okay lemme read from here
[1:17:58] they have it already blessed be the name
[1:18:00] of the Lord now let's see what happened
[1:18:02] what happened to the human race and what
[1:18:05] God was trying to achieve blessed be the
[1:18:08] Lord he is wonderful Amen so that I
[1:18:12] imprisoned is this awesome prison 1963
[1:18:16] now paragraph 44 marami is talking about
[1:18:19] this so we made up of three things right
[1:18:21] a human body is a unit but and when you
[1:18:24] break it down you couldn't talk about
[1:18:26] the flesh that we see here when you go
[1:18:28] beyond the flesh you see the spirit then
[1:18:30] the spirit after the spirit see that the
[1:18:32] so now the body is just to contact the
[1:18:35] earth this flesh because it's part of
[1:18:37] the earth the potassium the calcium is
[1:18:40] what have fellowship with the earth now
[1:18:42] the spirit which is the next higher step
[1:18:45] is to be able to what control you look
[1:18:47] at me moving my hands is not my that is
[1:18:51] moving itself if I lay my my arms here
[1:18:54] they shed is not going to move but when
[1:18:55] I move the shell is gonna move so the
[1:18:58] same way this flesh system element has
[1:19:00] to have a spirit he must pray to control
[1:19:03] him
[1:19:03] so the humans but that has got constant
[1:19:05] memory affection imagination and
[1:19:08] reasoning con truce this flesh its
[1:19:11] giveth this it's got a control tower so
[1:19:14] the flood that you are thirsty good
[1:19:15] rains on water you need some race that
[1:19:17] is about the ethany it's going nothing
[1:19:19] to do with eternal life amen
[1:19:21] now the next higher step is the soul
[1:19:23] that is what God is working on the so is
[1:19:27] the highest control tower in the body
[1:19:29] the body the spread in the Sioux the
[1:19:32] soul is where your your destiny lives if
[1:19:35] I've got you're born again you have got
[1:19:37] the Holy Ghost then you are in heaven
[1:19:38] you are sitting in heaven right now
[1:19:40] but then if you are still in sit on if
[1:19:42] cross then you don't even know who you
[1:19:44] are you are so on the other side you are
[1:19:47] a sinner you haven't recognized yourself
[1:19:50] amen glory hallelujah so now there so
[1:19:54] let's read a little bit for the profit
[1:19:56] program 44 but the soul is that's who
[1:19:59] that is in the sea the soul is what God
[1:20:02] is working on see if he can get that
[1:20:04] nature desperate desperate to agree with
[1:20:08] him then that nature dies the nature and
[1:20:11] the love of the world dies when we talk
[1:20:12] about the world is not talking about the
[1:20:14] moon the Stars is talking about Satan
[1:20:16] Satan is type as the world worldliness
[1:20:20] and Christ is top as the logos the
[1:20:23] weight so the world the love of the
[1:20:25] world the devil in in you in me before
[1:20:29] we're born again that is that is the
[1:20:31] love that you have the love of the world
[1:20:32] so if you love the world or the things
[1:20:35] although all the love of God is not in
[1:20:37] you the Holy Ghost is not in you see a
[1:20:39] man must be born again
[1:20:41] see this nature has to die and the
[1:20:44] nature of God comes in and lives in you
[1:20:46] and God is the only thing that there is
[1:20:49] the never did begin or never can end 45
[1:20:52] so therefore he has partnership you
[1:20:55] allowed that way God is a businessman
[1:21:00] inform accompany he comes from eternity
[1:21:03] and from a company with assistant
[1:21:06] element less from a business company
[1:21:08] partnership for eternal life so he said
[1:21:11] he has partnership you see taking this
[1:21:13] everyman God reflected himself back in
[1:21:16] day he became a man when it became
[1:21:19] Christ Jesus he was God see God was in
[1:21:22] Christ lived in him reconciling the
[1:21:24] world to himself and through that
[1:21:26] perfect man each one of us imperfect
[1:21:28] that believed God and has asserted that
[1:21:31] become the perfection of him 35 now the
[1:21:35] so that I in prison so that are
[1:21:37] imprisoned the soul of a man is not a
[1:21:39] body of a man so the soul is not a flesh
[1:21:42] it's the soul and the soul is something
[1:21:45] that is the nature of the spirit let's
[1:21:47] keep that point the soul is the nature
[1:21:49] of the Spirit amen
[1:21:51] and then when the nature of a man when
[1:21:53] we are dead the scripture play little
[1:21:55] tells that we are dead and our lives are
[1:21:57] hidden God through Christ soon there by
[1:22:00] the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your
[1:22:03] body died when you are born again this
[1:22:05] body didn't die
[1:22:06] it wasn't your spray die or him as
[1:22:08] president died you so can go about and
[1:22:10] room about do whatever I need to do it
[1:22:12] was the nature of your spirit which is
[1:22:15] your soul which died see the nature
[1:22:19] which is the SU the nature of your soul
[1:22:21] is God if you are born again amen if
[1:22:26] it's not it's of the world anything that
[1:22:28] has a beginning has to end therefore the
[1:22:30] only way you can have eternal life is to
[1:22:33] have a life that never did begin and
[1:22:35] then your life did begin when we were
[1:22:37] born when God breathed the breath of
[1:22:38] life into your nostrils you became a
[1:22:40] living soul otherwise when God put the
[1:22:42] human spirit in you and I've already had
[1:22:44] eternal life amen
[1:22:46] it was a few funny but then to be
[1:22:48] manifest on earth God by the spoken word
[1:22:51] spoke created a dust mote at him like 30
[1:22:54] year-old man jump into it but in a human
[1:22:57] spirit to contact earth to control the
[1:22:59] earth to control the sistine element so
[1:23:02] he bred he stepped down from the high
[1:23:04] voltage tension to something like a
[1:23:06] transformer
[1:23:07] something lower then so that he can
[1:23:09] control
[1:23:10] Rudi's
[1:23:10] and relate creation or death amen so now
[1:23:14] the soul is what God is waking porn
[1:23:17] amen God is not trying to make you more
[1:23:19] handsome or more beautiful you can do
[1:23:22] that yourself
[1:23:24] amen what God has done for you yes
[1:23:26] already done for you God is not trying
[1:23:28] to make you more rich to make you get
[1:23:30] more money so they can buy a jet plane
[1:23:32] and take vacation go for a vacation plan
[1:23:35] no that is what a program of God but
[1:23:38] God's program is what to save you
[1:23:41] because bring a death and also bring a
[1:23:44] marriage we read some other quotation
[1:23:47] one instant by the nature I was in us
[1:23:50] true sit and eat Crossin a brought death
[1:23:53] in us and that word that death that
[1:23:56] spreaded in the zoo is permitted from
[1:23:59] God is tempura is not Atena so God comes
[1:24:03] in by the Holy Ghost baptism of fire
[1:24:05] consuming fire the message has been
[1:24:06] coming the fire of God comes in and
[1:24:09] consume it supernaturally you don't die
[1:24:12] physically you Slough you don't even
[1:24:13] know how it happens if you ask me when I
[1:24:15] was born again I don't know the precise
[1:24:17] date and time I don't have a clue it was
[1:24:20] a supernatural way that as you hear the
[1:24:22] word from brother Jack you hear from the
[1:24:25] ministers supernaturally without even
[1:24:28] you been conscious you realize that I've
[1:24:30] no longer the person I used to be
[1:24:35] first you wear only one foot person all
[1:24:38] that you know is the earthly things
[1:24:39] drink wake do the things that human
[1:24:42] beings do but then when the supernatural
[1:24:45] consume the old person consume the old
[1:24:47] nature of the spirit consume the old
[1:24:49] book consume the osoo then Christ comes
[1:24:52] in him comes in by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] baptism you begin to sit in Supernatural
[1:24:57] the angels of God began to manifest to
[1:24:59] you because you have become old the wife
[1:25:02] of the clean amen

[1:25:26] to make a run out of it and I don't need

[1:32:04] you do about this devil in you and I
[1:32:06] said you want to give your life to God
[1:32:07] and I Bible for my student you want to
[1:32:10] read up Word of God I said mister I
[1:32:12] can't read Bible if I do that I'll
[1:32:13] betray my mom my mom raised me over
[1:32:15] witness so I cannot read Bible and so as
[1:32:18] you want to keep your mom's doctrine
[1:32:20] that you don't even practice and keep
[1:32:22] the devil in you
[1:32:25] now she realized she's got a devil in
[1:32:27] her and she said that that would this
[1:32:29] also this old nature manifesting even
[1:32:32] against her own world because you don't
[1:32:34] control yourself
[1:32:35] the soul is a control tower so if I'm
[1:32:38] not born again you can have the
[1:32:39] atmosphere of the word when you are
[1:32:41] sitting here you can that anointing will
[1:32:44] be on you but I when you get out there
[1:32:46] there must I tell you that also you
[1:32:48] think you are you are a Christian you
[1:32:49] think you a believer you a joker go get
[1:32:52] me some alcohol my old girlfriend I mean
[1:32:57] she loves you take a call call a take it
[1:33:00] from Colin do this or maybe better jack
[1:33:03] is going to see me I don't want my
[1:33:05] sister to see me no they're not going to
[1:33:07] see you do it in secret so then you do
[1:33:10] it in secret and you come back you feel
[1:33:13] condemned because that man is not dead
[1:33:15] it's all alive that husband is the one
[1:33:18] who is controlling you so you are not
[1:33:21] your cell phone you can be under the
[1:33:22] anointing of believers of a family and
[1:33:24] be so holy but then when you are by
[1:33:26] yourself then this guy comes out that I
[1:33:30] am the control tower
[1:33:32] do this for me go into prostitution for
[1:33:34] me don't even believe the message
[1:33:36] William Bramley is what he said is not
[1:33:38] truth because you had it intellectually
[1:33:41] amen but one day I am the grid I am that
[1:33:45] is I am draw senior let me use another
[1:33:48] example in the days of Abraham there was
[1:33:51] this young man a parents came to see
[1:33:52] Barbra ham
[1:33:53] it's about Abraham we do understand our
[1:33:55] son was engaged to a young sister but we
[1:33:59] don't know what happened he just left
[1:34:01] his young sister without even even
[1:34:03] telling nothing she doesn't like her no
[1:34:06] more sober Bram said I well your son
[1:34:09] need to be born again and of course
[1:34:11] parents our parents did they were upset
[1:34:12] about Braja that's a problem pastors
[1:34:14] face the repressive want to solve your
[1:34:18] problem you have said receive when it
[1:34:19] gives you the solution said no but a
[1:34:21] problem I'll make you to understand a
[1:34:22] son has been baptized correctly in the
[1:34:24] name of Jesus Christ in water baptism he
[1:34:27] has a good testimony in the church he's
[1:34:28] got his place abrupt saying yes your son
[1:34:30] is been baptized he's got a good example
[1:34:32] is not being a worldly person he heard
[1:34:35] the testimony in the church even a
[1:34:36] position a church but is that on Troy
[1:34:38] your son is born again advice that he
[1:34:40] doesn't touch a woman it doesn't marry
[1:34:42] because going to make a hell for that
[1:34:45] gift for that woman and for himself and
[1:34:49] so not a very begin to slow-dance a look
[1:34:52] you upon again and your wife is born
[1:34:54] again it is not you
[1:34:55] abram trace them to their roots that you
[1:34:57] a Germanic Germany pop wad they can stay
[1:35:00] at you and they don't respond they are
[1:35:03] indifferent Irish drunken fastens to win
[1:35:07] and killing African full of blood or
[1:35:10] distance all of us have got that nature
[1:35:13] through the Adamic nature sitting across
[1:35:15] in us so damaged I seen you but it's not
[1:35:19] nice and now is no longer your Irish
[1:35:20] Irish spirit and so your German is not
[1:35:23] your African is your American but it's
[1:35:25] your Christ in you
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:29] it is the Holy Spirit in you it is a new
[1:35:32] birth that has made you love any kind
[1:35:35] non suffering patient charitable
[1:35:39] rejoicing holy it is their cry see you
[1:35:43] by your son has got it all intellectual
[1:35:45] is a good persons tried to do something
[1:35:47] good but in his nature the old old
[1:35:50] nature he's not been regenerated he's
[1:35:53] not been been out he's not been consumed
[1:35:56] so that man is thought day and he
[1:35:58] doesn't even know how to say sorry he
[1:36:01] just left his girl just I don't want you
[1:36:03] no more
[1:36:04] and maybe the girls going through
[1:36:05] emotional pains and it doesn't mean nose
[1:36:08] to see sorry but he's religious he is a
[1:36:11] message believer what is the difference
[1:36:15] the difference is the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:36:18] amen glory hallelujah let me give
[1:36:28] another illustration when I was in high
[1:36:29] school I went to high school which is
[1:36:31] he's got a long history it was
[1:36:33] established by the British in 1876
[1:36:36] it's an old Methodist school so when we
[1:36:38] go there and they give you a rain tation
[1:36:39] they tell you that don't just pass
[1:36:41] through the school
[1:36:42] let us go pass through you nothing as
[1:36:45] another sunny statement because there
[1:36:46] was a lot of things that we do in your
[1:36:48] school they teach you how to be a leader
[1:36:49] to be a gentle man how to approach your
[1:36:52] horizon broaden your horizon so many
[1:36:54] things so don't just go through the
[1:36:55] school without participate in activities
[1:36:57] join a club they have different ensigns
[1:37:00] right and a debating Club and the school
[1:37:03] has produced a lot of world leaders the
[1:37:06] first African United Nations
[1:37:09] secretary-general Kofi Annan was went to
[1:37:10] the school so they tell you that be
[1:37:13] don't let the school don't pass through
[1:37:14] the school by ladies who pass through
[1:37:16] you don't pass through the message but
[1:37:19] let the message of the hour the Holy
[1:37:21] Ghost not just even passing through you
[1:37:24] but let it become you amen
[1:37:27] if you just go through the message oh
[1:37:29] yes I've been in a message for thousand
[1:37:30] years I Hunter William Brown
[1:37:33] it doesn't make no difference that was
[1:37:34] not afraid of that I'm the one dying
[1:37:36] heretic william brangham i was his shoes
[1:37:38] it doesn't make no difference I've been
[1:37:40] in the church I was I was there when
[1:37:42] bura bura bura Jack started a church
[1:37:44] that wasn't afraid of that it's a pack
[1:37:47] of history oh I'm a church member pay my
[1:37:49] tithe that is good that is a Christian I
[1:37:51] come to church every day is good but
[1:37:53] then if that death Christ has not been
[1:37:57] born in your heart then the life of
[1:37:59] Christ cannot be produced from your
[1:38:01] heart so jesus said he must be born
[1:38:04] again the new birth is the most
[1:38:07] important thing in the life of every
[1:38:08] believer amen
[1:38:10] when the Holy Ghost comes into you it
[1:38:12] consumes the old person it consumes the
[1:38:15] devil then recreates you or your
[1:38:17] ancestry the cases in your life or the
[1:38:20] demons of lying and all kind of demons
[1:38:22] consume them then recreates you then
[1:38:25] your spirit becomes get a new master get
[1:38:27] a new suit get cried Jesus in you get
[1:38:30] the Holy Ghost in you then your flesh
[1:38:32] has got a new boss now the boss in the
[1:38:34] house the occupant is a clean person if
[1:38:37] you go to a place that before--not tidy
[1:38:38] that does the place is all no tide is
[1:38:40] unclean unkempt but then when a new
[1:38:42] occupant a new a tenant goes any happy
[1:38:45] to please he tidied the place renovated
[1:38:47] please make everything brand new and God
[1:38:50] comes in and to undo what the devil has
[1:38:53] done destroy the old person and then
[1:38:56] bring back the original what you were
[1:38:58] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:59] because before the foundation of the
[1:39:01] world
[1:39:01] you ain't Christ if are not part of
[1:39:04] Christ you can't go to him
[1:39:05] and crisis a person that is Elohim
[1:39:08] personified in you amen
[1:39:10] let's read a little bit here glory
[1:39:15] hallelujah to the Lord the Lord is good
[1:39:20] blessed be the name of the Lord let's go
[1:39:22] to crisis revealed in his own word the
[1:39:29] mystery of God revealed 63 oh seven to
[1:39:32] eight let's read a bit the Lord is good
[1:39:50] alright let's go to paragraph paragraph
[1:39:58] 154 Christ is revealed in song word
[1:40:01] paragraph 154 now God wanted to have
[1:40:05] express himself completely programmatic
[1:40:07] efest to express himself completely God
[1:40:09] in Christ
[1:40:10] second to have the preeminence by this
[1:40:13] in his church the church is not the
[1:40:15] congregation is you individual you and I
[1:40:18] in his check which is the body the bride
[1:40:20] so he could have the preeminence to
[1:40:22] express himself through them and thirdly
[1:40:25] to restore the kingdom to it's rightly
[1:40:27] position that fell by sin and by Adam
[1:40:29] back to where he worked in the cool of
[1:40:32] the evening with his people talk with
[1:40:34] them and fellowship with them amen
[1:40:37] so God has got three purposes toward to
[1:40:40] express himself completely in Christ
[1:40:42] which he started doing from Adam on to
[1:40:45] this day but any want to have a personal
[1:40:47] relationship with you throughout their
[1:40:50] preeminence not ever have any
[1:40:51] preeminence not you have any preeminence
[1:40:53] not sitting having a preeminence not
[1:40:56] your ambitions and go have any
[1:40:57] preeminence but Jesus Christ the person
[1:40:59] of Christ won't have a preeminence in
[1:41:01] your system element amen
[1:41:03] by the Holy Ghost baptism Amen so that
[1:41:06] you become a partnership with him you
[1:41:08] become one with him and he walk in your
[1:41:11] earth to manifest is the glory
[1:41:13] hallelujah let's look at another
[1:41:16] scripture here let me read a data on
[1:41:19] Kaveri 60 on i-25 data on Kaveri
[1:41:24] paragraph 46 so there was a requirement
[1:41:27] for sin the requirement was death death
[1:41:31] was the panel
[1:41:31] see and this we could go into great
[1:41:34] details because I do not believe that is
[1:41:35] but one death there's one life and I
[1:41:38] believe a mother has eternal life can
[1:41:40] never die
[1:41:41] amen and I believe there's a complete
[1:41:44] and halation of the cidade sense for the
[1:41:46] Bible said that is Sudarsan it shall
[1:41:48] surely die
[1:41:49] not a man the Sioux doesn't it so Satan
[1:41:53] must surely die to be completely
[1:41:55] destroyed amen
[1:41:57] so that is what the Sudha's and they saw
[1:41:59] that drinkin is not a sin fornication is
[1:42:02] a lesson but the person that is you
[1:42:06] Satan they saw the old nature the nature
[1:42:09] of the Spirit the unbelief the unbelief
[1:42:12] is the root of some medicine in a person
[1:42:15] does it a sin the fornication that
[1:42:17] drunkenness is just an attributes of
[1:42:20] what comes out of he who that is in you
[1:42:23] so the Prophet preached a message he
[1:42:25] that is in you who is he that is in you
[1:42:27] is in Christ or is it the devil amen a
[1:42:32] little further from talking the message
[1:42:34] talking 60309 oh one and paragraph 82
[1:42:38] say and now how could there be a more
[1:42:40] perfect sacrifice than God Himself
[1:42:42] becoming the atonement himself paragraph
[1:42:46] 83 because all of us were born by six
[1:42:49] sit and Eve cross and therefore the life
[1:42:51] that is in there is of the world and
[1:42:53] that life would not stand it's a thing
[1:42:56] that is already judged and condemned you
[1:42:59] can bring it before the Lord you can
[1:43:01] patch it up there's no way to patch it
[1:43:03] up there's no way to smooth it out
[1:43:04] there's no way to make it better
[1:43:06] it's got to die amen and Eddie for that
[1:43:10] and a substitute a life of Jesus Christ
[1:43:13] has to come into you which is the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost
[1:43:16] gasps tooken that you have accepted the
[1:43:19] blood of His Son Jesus amen so the token
[1:43:23] is when God gives you the token it's
[1:43:25] just like a man marries a woman he gives
[1:43:27] a ring as a token so when God is married
[1:43:30] to as the first husband that ever dies
[1:43:31] out of us then Christ comes into us and
[1:43:33] he give you a token a ring what is the
[1:43:35] ring the Holy Ghost but Elohim
[1:43:38] personified in you
[1:43:40] Jesus Christ living in your letter F and
[1:43:44] what the RAM said what is the evidence
[1:43:46] of the Holy Ghost baptism is it because
[1:43:48] you speak in tongues that is a gift is
[1:43:50] it because you prophesy that I give is
[1:43:52] it because I preach no but when you have
[1:43:55] a clear understanding of the way
[1:43:57] what can give you clear not standing it
[1:43:59] is the Holy Ghost in you which can give
[1:44:01] you a clay understand you don't have to
[1:44:03] know other ministries or in a Bible but
[1:44:05] you have a clear understanding of the
[1:44:08] word of god when god himself is
[1:44:10] personally reviewed in you because is
[1:44:13] what is a personal relationship Christ
[1:44:16] the eternal person partnership in you
[1:44:18] and you become a truthful beam you also
[1:44:21] a human being you Saguna being a human
[1:44:23] flesh but then there's apportioning you
[1:44:25] that is a supernatural that is Christ
[1:44:27] that is the eternal spirit that takes
[1:44:30] your flesh and become the flesh of Jesus
[1:44:32] Christ blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:44:36] let's read a efficient chapter - you

[1:46:00] have risen up together and made us sit
[1:46:03] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:46:05] Jesus that is the believers position
[1:46:07] amen sitting in heavenly places it
[1:46:10] doesn't mean that your system element is

[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:07] and we certainly thank the Lord for his
[1:51:11] precious word on today just sitting
[1:51:16] there and listeners brother quick who
[1:51:19] was talking about electricity and how it
[1:51:22] had to start there at the power plant
[1:51:26] you know I just didn't just just kind of
[1:51:29] stepped down bring it through a
[1:51:30] transform and you still came touched
[1:51:32] that transformer now you get fried and
[1:51:35] you're saying after keep stepping it
[1:51:37] down to the get it all the way to just a
[1:51:39] little 110 volt or 220 outlet or
[1:51:41] something like that now you can finally
[1:51:43] get something plugged in and as they
[1:51:44] said that all love then he he he stepped
[1:51:48] down and he brought to us the definition
[1:51:51] of sex I've never heard nobody put it
[1:51:56] like that before
[1:51:57] SPX he stepped that thing all the way
[1:51:59] down so that we could handle it
[1:52:02] same and Eve CNS Satan is in our nature
[1:52:18] I say brother that - yes that's alright
[1:52:21] it helped you really think about where
[1:52:24] you are and I'll tell you this if you're
[1:52:26] if you're struggling in any area in your
[1:52:29] life
[1:52:30] God doesn't want it to be that way the
[1:52:32] example that he used with that magnet if
[1:52:37] you notice once he took the magnet and
[1:52:40] he set it on top of the other magnet
[1:52:43] there was not enough power in the lower
[1:52:46] magnet to keep it in the condition that
[1:52:49] it was in right and it was bringing the
[1:52:57] fact of the word here today to cause you
[1:52:59] to rise from the condition that you're
[1:53:01] in hallelujah when that that lower
[1:53:05] magnet was there a man noticed the lower
[1:53:08] magnet did not pull the upper back that
[1:53:10] down but only the upper magnet could
[1:53:14] pull the lower magnet up it was a
[1:53:16] stronger magnet it was a greater man
[1:53:18] right and God is just trying to pull you
[1:53:21] out of whatever condition a situation
[1:53:23] with and once I got connected became
[1:53:25] partners there was not going back down
[1:53:28] again
[1:53:30] I'll tell you what that was all right to
[1:53:32] me yes
[1:53:33] I say braids God
[1:53:41] we really really appreciate that a man
[1:53:44] on today personified in you this song is
[1:53:53] a song of surrender
[1:53:56] as the brother was saying today you know
[1:54:00] oftentimes we can't even pinpoint when
[1:54:03] something changed we just know things
[1:54:05] begin to change with every week every
[1:54:09] day every hour all I encourage you to
[1:54:13] just keep surrendering Agathe though
