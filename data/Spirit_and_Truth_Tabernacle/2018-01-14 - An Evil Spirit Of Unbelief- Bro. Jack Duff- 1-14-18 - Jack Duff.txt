this stall a man with us confronting opposition the opposition and we just were just very grateful just for some of the things that he brought out I was just looking at one of the things you know sometimes we just go right over the top of scriptures and and he hit this thing where Paul made the statement follow me and he just written it you know Paul said follow me and and we always quote follow me as I follow Christ yes he said that too but before he said that he said follow me and what a what a what a powerful statement you know because you know the Prophet told us just think what's on the books turn on the tapes don't come up with not now just just follow me all right I mean God gave me something for you just take this and use it you know but but unfortunately folk don't want us they don't want to see that no more I have some better tell me don't tell me what the prophet seen don't tell me and I'm sitting there just kind of listening you know as the as the hottest coming across it man my spirit is totally different than than your spirit you can say don't tell me but I'm saying please tell me alright don't don't give me your thoughts tell me what God said through His Prophet all right because they already vindicated all right so we don't we don't we just don't want a whole bunch of you know just just stuff going on we want to know what let's dust saith the Lord right and we thank God a man for a message that he's given us to give us clarity in this hour and you know brother brother Henry where's brother hear me okay praise the Lord you know I was telling y'all brother Henry is up in Palm Bay and he was there listening to the radio and brother Henry was listening and he had moved down here from Boston area Massachusetts area he was up there we've been here for a little while and they say just didn't know that there was any message churches in the area so he just got the radio long got the radio on and the radio plan and and as he listening you know he say although suddenly heard brother branham see [Music] he's saying how long I think this man just said on the radio brother branham said is that I don't maybe I missed it maybe I missed it I don't know I'm gonna have to keep listing turned it back on again here brother Branham says hey hold on this man this man is saying brother brand I'm saying I said if man preaching the message so you know he just said got all the information and not next thing you know he start going to the website and see this was so important Church every every everything we do here is important right I mean he went to the website saw the videos and he started looking at the service before he came all right looking at the church he scoped it out like yeah this and he start color says he said brother I just you know I'm coming I'm coming first of the year I'm gonna be there say I just I just I just need to be there call back home to Trinidad to tell some people you find some people that believe the message drove an hour and a half to get here see my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow so yeah I mean that's the thing God just speaking you know his word and and and and as we're getting things out there on the airwaves you never know who's listening and and who's who's looking for something so we're just so happy to have your brother Henry amen God God richly bless you a man got richly bless you praise the Lord man it always feel good to get around some folk that that see things the way you see you know it you got you got spirits that agree with one another if I could just be honest this message has taken us places that we would have never gone it's connected us with people that we would have never known and sometimes you know I'm gonna tell you just just I remember you know years ago when we would go places if if we didn't know who it was that we were looking for when we got there let's say we were flying in and we didn't know who it was that we were looking for when we got there we just take one of them smoking bird books and just hand it up hold it up like this and when we hold it up like that man the average person gonna look at us and be like what in the world ain't doing we could holding up but all of a sudden you see somebody come out the crowd god bless you you do you you don't met a familiar spirit hallelujah in church I tell you you know that that's it and it just put a smile on your face that you amongst believers because you know this word will keep you no matter what your nationality is when you start talking this message it goes beyond your nationality don't care what country you come from America Africa you know Canada it doesn't matter where you come from this right here go beyond that glory to God we thank God for this word that he gave us hey man it's done more for me than a man I could ever imagine and and I'm holding to this a man I'm holding to this so I believe Jesus loves me and that's why he said this word to me amen because it loves me just that much just that much all right Church I'm not I think we got all the announcements and everything out of the way and I don't think I need to announce anything for those we did get everybody's giving statements produced so if you have not received your giving statement I think we have some that will give out today those that have received them yet just make sure you see us and we'll give you yours today a man giving statements for 2017 and don't forget the meaning of to our annual meeting we have some things that we need to talk about here for the church and we want all the members to be present they men we only do this once a year so please be present for for that I thank God for brother Quint and I was I was telling him you know when he he he travels he has a he's a businessman I mean when it was first moving down right before he moved down brother Quentin was over in China I say brother you're China's a yeah I'm in China doing some business then I come back from China had to go to Africa like wow I said that's it that's the blessing God was just you know put him in some real special places but but I was actually brother Quentin you know we have a business meeting a man every year on this on this fourth Friday in January and any they say I'll be there so you know no he put his plans around God's place and that's what I'm talking about when you honor God first God will honor you hallelujah hey man so whatever you do don't let the blessings overtake you now a man but but but enjoy what God got for you realized in a vanity you know he just wants you to George before he calls us away so what but we thank God for that that one announcements that was not there we will have a service on Saturday night that we do third Saturday we try to do you service and and we want to have a you service this Saturday night Amen I didn't put it out on the on our website but I'm letting the church knowing you can let others know but Saturday night and we're gonna try to keep going you know with with what we have been doing I kind of got off a schedule there a little bit but we want to try to keep things going and and you know I'm just you know there's a there's a lot that has happened there's a lot that has happened one of one of the things that I had in my heart for the youth services I wanted to give young man opportunities a man to minister and speak you know just just you know maybe maybe the only time they got a chance to speak was at the church so I would try to you know through that here but we we we have a special diets just being honest with you we have a diet that we eat a man we have we have some food that we eat and and and I can tell what you serve in a man I can tell what you're serving now just because you pick up the Bible reason scriptures don't mean you saying what the Bible said all right now yeah I better be careful about this just because I'm gonna pick up a bar but you better be careful but are they really saying what the Bible say they've got something injected in there alright so you know we just we got to be a little careful in that area and and and and I mean I have preached some youth services before so I don't have no problem preach them again a man alright so but that's you know we we're going back to what God gave us and we're gonna keep doing these youth services praying that God will raise up help and I see God raising up help right here in our midst and and we're grateful for the help y'all pray for the help not pray for the help that we don't like that devil don't like nobody to get not here helping as soon as it soon as they do something but it that would be right there but you know you got like I said you're the batter you know you're not here to look cute you you need a fight and soon as it they will throw something then you got to be ready to counter-attack that demo they don't unload everything in your pack you know don't don't don't don't go back at the camp with weapons unleash all lap down the tail go back to get some more ammunition you know but but we're not gonna be afraid instead we're gonna stand up we're gonna we're gonna do all we can a man in the name of the Lord Jesus so alright i'ma let y'all go musicians thank y'all so much hey man appreciate appreciate you all a man we will stand and we will read a scripture own today and I'm not sure what's your name my brother Christopher I know you've been here before okay good to have you again Christopher yeah very very good to have you again a man I'm reading we're going back to our thought from last week and I'm reading from Hebrews 3 verse 12 through 13 and I want to maybe bring in you know just a couple other things here one of the other things I've noticed about brother Troy in his and his thought that he prayed a prayer there was like Lord let me just kind of get into a man the same channel and so a lot of things that he was bringing if you go back and look they were reiterating some of the things that were said in Bible study reiterating some of the other things that was said and not just in the preaching and that says a lot okay because if you have some times in ministry or you have different people that you know working together in ministry if they pull an apart then that divides the church but when they working together it keeps everybody United right is long glory to God sometimes there's a message in the message and we got to be sensitive to these things right but I appreciate that brother Troy I really appreciate that it was good to see that we as we starting out this new year we just trying to get all the right people in the right places and you know because god got great things in store and I mean before we leave here we go we're gonna get the devil some Fitz that's our plan give the devil some Fitz a man I rang Hebrews chapter three and I read from verse twelve and thirteen on last week I read that again this week take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God all right but exhort one another daily this is this is important exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin a man for we have made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end so we're looking at this this this this evil heart but I'm kind of changing the title a man today to evil spirit a man of unbelief not just evil heart but evil spirit of unbelief and if you would just turn with me to a man a passage of Scripture I got I got a couple that I need to read y'all just bear with me i'm i want to go to first seventy or eighteen and then second thessalonians to first samuel 18 verse 10 just one verse here first samuel 18 and look at this it says and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from God came upon us all and he prophesied in the midst of the house and David played with his hand as at other times there was a javelin in Saul's hand let's just stop there maybe towards somewhere in the sermon will pick up 2nd Thessalonians and bring that in - but we want to title it today an evil spirit of unbelief and evil spirit not just an evil heart but an evil spirit of unbelief that's supposed to have word of Prayer father we're grateful for this time to be able to hear your word thank you for the anointing that has been in this place thank you God for all that has been done and we trust that the Holy Ghost would now take us further in the gospel that you got will reveal your truth to us that you got with have your way in the midst of this portion of the service we take every spirit that's against your spirit underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now encourage every heart in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated we want to again take for our subject an evil spirit of unbelief because that's that's what this really is a man it is it's a spirit right and last Sunday I was telling you how we were we were gonna get our flying here but we're gonna get our guns trained and we're gonna try to attack a spirit right because uh you know if we can get the spirit you know cast out then the people of God can be free and sometimes you have to be able to see things you know from from the scripture you know perspective but we we want to do the best we can to help us to see those things I want to start with a quote here today out of the message Christianity versus Dollar Tree Christianity versus Dollar Tree something that God's prophet tells us here and I want you to try to catch this a man says I was reading here where one came to I believe it was Iranian or Martin won some of the Bible students that's better versed in this and this then I'm had a gold crown on his head white robe own shoes and late with gold and said I am the Christ confess me that Saint wouldn't do it that real prophet of God stood there waiting and they said two or three times up to him I'm the Christ confessed me he said our Christ don't come like that it says that's right you got to know the word stay on the words see the great battle is at hand now we play church for years and years but the hours come now that when jamjam breeze and Janice will withstand Moses as the Bible sent they would now notice what the Prophet is telling us say this is the hour where Janice and Jambres will withstand Moses as the Bible said they would and it's going to be a spiritual battle I'm a just I'm gonna drop this off for you a them further proof that brother branham's ministry is also a type of Moses ministry I'm saying something I know it's gonna be a little deep for everybody but Moses said the Lord your God will raise up for a prophet like unto me that actually has dual meaning and man that was revealed multiple times it was fulfilled in the Ministry of Jesus Christ it was also fulfilled in the Ministry of Paul and it was also fulfilling the Ministry of William Branham and further proof that brother branham's ministry fulfills that is when you see the spirit of Janice and Jerry's will standing the Prophet that lets you know that's exactly in the word alright let's go on a little further it says Janet who says now those hours come that jammers Jambres and Janice will withstand Moses as the Bible said they would and it's going to be spiritual battle my it's going to be spiritual battle conflict Oh see we have to confront the opposition right it's going to be spiritual battle conflict they'll be they'll they'll be just they'll be just continue on the denominational Church will just move right on into the denomination and go on the way it goes but I mean the real true believer it's coming to that battlefield you know the denominational Church is not feeling what we feel it and then they have no idea what these things is that that's really going on the true believers coming to the battlefield we actually in the battle a man but this is the key thing say you better be versed and know what you're doing why because for you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know I'm gonna work with that you better be verse and know what you doing that's why everybody can't be going to believe the Sun everybody can't go to see kita truth everybody can't be at websites amen sometimes you get the reading of thanks and the Holy Spirit will tell you stop you better listen to the Holy Ghost because if you keep reading that stuff you yourself will take on an evil spirit and not even know it I'm just I'm just being honest because everybody goodness evil spirit they got it two years ago and I'm saying that I'm saying something without saying something these are key words two years two years if somebody starts saying I just I mean two years ago I started two years what everybody all of a sudden got this revelation two years ago that didn't happen to me two years ago amen two years ago I went full time ministry right so I mean but I don't know what I bet when you hear key words like that two years ago that is that showing that an evil spirit has come in you were you were entertaining something that you should not have been entertaining and see sometimes you know we you know we got to be careful Church I gotta be I gotta just let the church know these things you can't you you can't try to take on these battles yourself hallelujah Amen you know even in the Army they Spain they trained certain men for certain things if you ain't never drove a tape don't try to kill it I take mine and try to defend us right Amen you got to know your place and if you don't have the answer say I don't know where we can get the answer but why they keep avoiding the pulpit you can tell this a spirit and variance and there's evil spirit produces things it produces things it produces a very very hard heart [Music] extremely hard heart you know and you know I mean I was just reading a quote here just yesterday brother these brothers was accident by the Brandon it was in church order he was asked him how do I'm certain things that the brothers they were just promoted are actually performed officers Deacon yeah they were actually Saints to do certain things and other people would get upset with them and some of them just stopped coming to church because the Deacon acts gonna do something and they so they just they just got mad evil hearts weaken hearts right and and and so brother Brandon told the brothers say they say are we out of our place so you know what's funny he said he said no no you're not out of your place that's exactly what you're supposed to do as the Deacon of the church do it that way and it says I will you know we'll get those things straightened out with them you know but you know but what happens is that that you know as people kind of take on these these spirits he say he say the same way that they get mad at you they get mad at me all the time you y'all know why people get mad at me y'all know why huh I'm the one I'm the one that got to see it when nobody else won't see it I'm the one that's forced to see it and because I say it you offended all our acts is that just showed me in the Bible where I'm wrong that's it now don't get me wrong I mean I'm able to be corrected I was corrected a precious sister corrected me one time and I'll never forget it I thank God for her corrected me now I'm saying that and I must say this too so you don't get a spirit on you know he was good I don't think that everybody could just run up and correct now don't don't think that otherwise I wouldn't be the pastor all right stay with it stay with it but but but a sister told me one time she said she said you know pastor the Bible say that the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God that's all she said James 1:20 past that's all just she didn't try to interpret it she just gave it to you know the Bible say that the wrath of man does not work the righteous of God I start reasoning okay thank you sister and what that was telling I can get up here and and and I'm not doing this I'm not get up here to just be mad and say things to people that's not that's not mine and now when I preached I do raise my voice that's just who I am if I was in Baptist I grabbed my ear and I was saying my sermon to you if I was still a Baptist come on I grab me an hour sing that thing to you but that's not God called me out of that and he brought me here so a lot of times I preach out you know I go up and down they constantly walk peaking all over the place everywhere I go to like brother Jack man we can't keep up with you know the decibels that that you I'm sorry that's the way God made me some preachers get up in it just you know just coast right alone don't they never raise their voice That's not me something yeah let's you all the time that's not me I just go up and down like this and you never know when I'm going but I'm trying to take you up with me all right but but church when we look at some of these things without what I want you to see is that you can you you you need to be versed right Oh Lord Jesus don't don't don't don't you know if you're not versed if you a babe in Christ don't go out there to the websites you're babe in Christ don't do that and and now you come back telling us what what the Prophet meant you just got here no don't do that don't do that right we've been following this for a number of years don't don't don't do it like that right so so here you know you know when even even a a believe that's been around for years can take on an evil spirit and not know it now the way you know it's an evil spirit watch the actions by their fruit you shall know them so that's how you know no no no no that ain't the Spirit of God that's not even in the word that right no that ain't no no that's an evil spirit now you might not be able to go and tell us about that cast I bet he was for no you can't do it like that you can keep praying but also know that the same way that the devil got them he's trying to get you so just don't give no no I'm not gonna pay no attention to that I mean you know there there's just even recently there was something that I was I was reading and you know I was just getting ready to study on it and I felt the Holy Spirit ever saying uh stop right there don't go no further with that so no okay I'm gonna just stop right there I'm not gonna look at that anymore because these fears are released in that and you open up your womb to stuff that you just never imagined that you'd open up to and not now you got questions in your mind but you open your womb to that listen that's what happened to Eve when she sent there listening and kept listening and kept listening that and notice she was listening when Adam was not around when the pastor was not around she was researching without the pastor that's what she was doing and then she got the research research without the pastor she thought she got a revelation and she brought it to the pastor introduced it to a pasta now he willfully went out and did what he did but he knew it was wrong all right Church listen this you better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to his word don't believe it stay with that word now I'm gonna skip down go to paragraph 82 on that he says so many people today are opening their hearts to the wrong thing he says you get a spirit all right you get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word listen saying the days of miracles is past there's no such things such thing as this or that remember that's a devil under the disguise meant of Christianity oh I hope the church here it is you can own mind you have Devils out there in personating Christians right it's a devil on the disguise meant of Christianity god help us as help us when we get down to this and after bit that you see it that it's an evil spirit in the disguise of Christianity it taught sweet humble salt I mean you know I've had people brother I'm so open to fellowship with you you got such a good spirit I'm so open a fellowship to you with you at any time I'm so open I'm saying fellowship I'm open to answer your questions but I throw I told the person I told multiple food since all y'all got all these questions that get everybody together and settle the questions at one time but I can't be having individual meetings with everybody you know what you're trying to do drain me you're trying to drain me I'm not gonna be drained like that if people won't help I'm here to help but I'm not gonna let you drag me and especially if the questions are going nowhere I'm just I'm just being honest there's some questions that you know that I hear it ain't got nothing to do it the prophecy it's got to do what you heard one preacher say that you different with that preacher that in between me and you I mean me you and the preacher that's between you and the preacher but don't bring that to me alright tell me what you disagree with the Prophet and I want to go a little further with that the prophets the prophets responsibilities was to restore truth right here is his responsibility was to restore truth right so so you know when I look at that I mean God said the prophet not to talk about Amen a lot of unnecessary things but he came to talk about what happened in the Garden of Eden cuz somebody told me that you know if they say well then got nothing to do my salvation say okay okay you're saying gotten under yourself as y'all just bear with me hold on I'm going so if they say say so you ain't got nothing said but but when you get safe the first thing they give you is a Bible where you gonna turn to in your Bible to start reading Genesis look I hit the Garden of Eden somebody gotta explain to you what you just read because if you ain't got the picture right in the beginning you can't end up with a right in the end so yes what happened in the garden is just not important it's important everything in the script is important we want to just extract Calvary but that's not what God did he put it all in there right don't just try to take and just put it yes we thank God for Karen but there was other things happen after Calvary and you know and this one hit me I'm just I'm coming I'm coming back I'm coming back but this one just hit me last night because I said something about you know you got it you got to believe the word for your day you got except to work for your date so when I got a problem with that okay all right I understand and say well Moses you're not living in Moses day you're not living in Noah's day you're not living even in the days that Jesus walked the earth you're not living in John the Baptist team you're not living in Paul's day so what day are you living in now you don't have an answer to that but I do and I got a Bible answer my Bible answers that I'm living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and when he shall begin to the mysteries of God would be finished that's what they I live in I can identify my day according to the scripture so when you see that they want to take that word day away they take in revelation 10 7 from you I remember sister told me this I guess I couldn't find my name in the Bible she said oh your name is all over the Bible brother Jack so every time you see you he was talking to you I said oh yeah thank God I didn't need to see my personal name I just needed to see you so when he said behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day he might not have been talking to you but he was talking to me that's why I think of it is it might not be for you it's for me hallelujah can I keep going so many people today are opening their hearts to the wrong thing be careful you get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word saying the days of miracles has passed there's no such things as this or that I'm at the same quote paragraph 82 remember that's a devil under disguise meant of Christian 'god help us when we get down into this after bit then you see it then it's an evil spirit and disguise men of Christianity but it isn't the Spirit of Christ because the Spirit of Christ comes to the to the word every time he can't deny his own word now I want to just give a little example of an evil spirit okay that can overtake somebody and them not realize that it's an evil spirit religious religious church-going folk but could actually take on an evil spirit one time brother Branham was having some meetings and as he was there praying for the sick there was a boy with epilepsy that come up to be pray for him and brother Branham said you know he start praying to a man in spirit just one ghost like man it's just something wrong here so they start looking around the audience and as he looked over the audience he saw this group people in the audience with their heads up and if they say please put your head down he said please reverence you know what God is doing this moment please put your head down don't don't have your head up have their head up anyway heydo so didn't the pastor of this group right let's see I'm leader a man of God good man had great intentions he just didn't believe this but with his with his good intentions taught his congregation that they did not have to put their head down when when the Prophet actually put the head down he said we don't have to do it he'd say this is a public place and we can do whatever we want to do the brand Imam he says okay and he prayed you say lord please don't let this child suffer because of their irreverence and it told a spirit that was in it I said man you and he cast a spirit out so we can cast evil spirits out and he cast the spirit I said now he said now I'll tell you what you got to come out of this child but you are free you are free to go to them that are irreverent can I can I can I tell y'all something because of how how how how real this message is I would rather for you not to come to church and be irreverent then the come and sit here and be irreverent I rather if you just don't come right because you never know when something like that could happen to you but when that spirit left when brother Branham gave the spirit I say you can you certainly have access to go into whoever's irreverent twenty eight people at one time was bound with epilepsy and they brother Bram say I'm not even praying for him he said oh I got the cold here he said God allowed that spirit to come on now either keep statement God allowed that spirit I'm saying something now God allow that spirit now let's go back and look at Samuel look at this because this just kind of you know huh you know God God is a good god nothing bad about God you're right ain't nothin bad about him but these evil spirits can't come from God woo no that's heavy listen and it came to pass verse 10 say first time you 18 percent and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from God came upon us all and any prophesy in the midst of the house and David played with his hand and as as at other times and there was a javelin in Saul's hand now I want to just just stay with me you know on this you know we don't we gonna break into this in a little bit but you know last week we were just kind of sharing how brother branham made a statement how their hearts were hardened just like it was in the time of Joseph and so forth right you talked about how the hearts were hardened right and and and when we went back and we looked at Joseph we noticed that the hardened heart does a couple things a hurting heart will hate a hardened heart cannot speak peaceably amen and in this particular situation we're set with Saul he had a heart hurt or he had an evil heart and that heart became a jealous heart mine and and because of his jealousy he was trying to slay David now you mean remember now remember before a day that came into Saul's presidents David had already been pre anointed the King Oh God he was already pre in order the king now Saul may not have known that David was the pre anointed king but he was slow or Satan inside us all trying to destroy the PIA anointed king Oh hallelujah right so oftentimes you might not realize about they they know that just like he knew and maybe he didn't know but God knew David was coming to power God was gonna use data for great things guess what God wants to use this for great things but it's an evil spirit trying to destroy the box trying to stop the bra it's an evil spirit trying to do that oh my god see we coming against the spirit church I mean we man we love people we love people but we hate spirits hate them hate them and I'm not ashamed to admit I hate spirits I mean I don't like to see people get entangled with bad spirits and you know one of the worst fears that a person had happens a religious spirit it's terrible it's terrible but listen a hardened heart or evil heart will become a jealous heart now and what happened here was saw you know this evil spirit that were coming and anoint him at different times men they'd have to get somebody said look we need some American play some music I said I mean they couldn't stand up in his presence it wasn't it one when this man he just he just lose it oh my god he weren't able to kind of keep his emotions under control I'm talking real good because this is what happened to people when they get II was feeling I mean they just all over the place they they totally imbalance with the emotions that they just can't control themselves it's the devil anointing them right the devil nor them and then the devil get them so worked up then they start making bad decisions they start doing I mean it's a devil all alone and we're trying to catch that Devil out here this man this man Saul had this feared on them say they say look that the people around him cement you soul you so bad off we gotta find some matters of knowing it with music that can play and they just need to play in your presence and maybe them spirits to calm down so if David didn't apply for the job David didn't apply for the job but what David did David they were just out there just playing as me like you normally do and somebody recognized that this boy is anointed sometimes just walking around and man this guy is anointing hallelujah say wouldn't it wouldn't it be so nice that you could create an atmosphere if you couldn't do it at home can you do it at church that we can create an atmosphere for people no man this place is anointed and that if you coming here at one speed you gotta leave free he say he say he say you say they said man we know somebody and it wasn't just one person multiple multiple people hurt David play so this kind of North to say Saul we need to get this guy here let him play for you I guarantee them spirits to be cast out of you and and and David Saul get all in a fix you don't know what's giving what's getting ready to happen he got that javelin in his hand and maybe people on Singlish javelin once we say any time he did that jab in something ready to happen y'all better run for cover right and here you got that javelins damage they said no it's David start playing that heart and play that music mistaking of that that spirit calm down he put the javelin down but one day because of jealousy Dave was sitting in his presence and and you know he had come up with some some scheme a man about you know if you go and uh if I mean you go in your slaves so many Philistines and you know we'll I'll give you a give you my daughter to wife and our son David go and slay double the amount that he gave up and the ladies come back with that song the sisters of the church returned into Saul's Church with a new song they was freshly inspired solace latest thousands and may be solved as the oh yeah glory hallelujah so let's latest thousands and each and he just demand that's a wonderful song and then then then they they changed an ad of the second verse and when they added a second verse say but David solace latest thousands but david that's latest ten thousands and when we Nate when he heard but David say that evil spirit ain't that old song right - II wanna kill David the same man just broke him deliverance now he wants to kill that evil spirit did that say you were spared from the Lord now wait a minute if there's from the Lord if it's from the Lord God must have purpose I can tell you already what God's purpose is he has another king yet God already had moved on from song he had another king and and and David was gonna be that next king let me let me just let me work with this a little bit more the evil spirit from the Lord because I can't just leave you it's not gonna it's not gonna work the way I'm I'm gonna let it work i'ma tell you why that evil spirit from the Lord happened with Saul because God had another king but today there's an evil spirit from the Lord second Thessalonians chapter 2 and I also I want to leave you like that cuz I know some of y'all but just might not catch everything I'm saying the reason that the evil spirit comes from the Lord is because the evil spirit has to have permission before it can do what is doing so the last place that a god is permission was in the presence of the Lord 2nd 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 look at this verse 1 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand verse 3 let no man deceive you I like this by any means by any means not nothing don't let them deceive you but let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God now I want you to just kind of understand this and and and don't get me wrong when I read this I mean you know sometimes things happen let me I've heard it many times somebody you know what rise up a man and and and feel that too I mean they go from one message Church to another message Church I want you to get it they go for one message church to a another message Church and what the people would say is that they went out from us because they were not of us they went from one message church to another message church and you are miss applying the scripture so I'm not doing that but I am trying to help you see that this is an order for God's Word to be for feel and evil spirit has to come from the Lord to bring it to pass and unfortunately people don't realize that it's an evil spirit when when it when it got started on the websites it was an evil spirit behind it and they had no idea and and that's right you know I'm sorry I'm for me I'm not I'm casting I'm casting all I'm casting away evil spirits specially when it comes to those that I love the Prophet told me well he didn't tell it to me but but the angel told him and I'm taking that if the angel told you then he must have been talking to me - because you said it secret things belong unto the Lord our God but once they reveal they belong unto us that's what the Bible's saying if you want to keep that a secret you should've kept it a secret but soon as you revealed it I'm taking it for myself [Music] into telling me you see all that you love and all that ever loved you God has given to you they're gonna be on the other side I might not know how they're gonna get there but I must know my promise if you say they're gonna be I'm looking for so I'm not putting I'm not putting my loved ones in this I'm telling you the spirit that is in my land today sometimes people get wrapped up and stuff and don't know what they wrapped up into they just don't understand the God is able to deliver and if it wasn't for God's grace I would be all wrapped up not only that and that does grace some time we tempt God y'all know how we tiptoe let me see what they saying let me see if I can let no no no no no don't don't do it don't do it look too many people don't went down too many and you are not going to be able to withstand them you're not best thing you can do is pray that's just your greatest weapon not your intellect your prayers can I go on a little further here I want to read that that's 70 70th week of Daniel a quote here where brother Brandon brings us in I'm just kind of tying all these thoughts together if we can I'm gonna go back and show you how you know that spear got to get permission that scripture down somebody might have to help me find that one but I want to go and find micaiah a mastermind I might have to help me find that one and I'll get it but let me read this quote the 70th week of Daniel brother Adam said now a revelation 13:14 Jesus in Matthew 24 warned them of it and image them to the beasts Paul the second Thessalonians the second chapter third and fourth verses let's get it see Paul what he says here about it that great holy spirit on this great prophet of the Lord see what he said about it in the last day and thest and second Thessalonians the second chapter is what it is alright sermon began with the third verse I believe it is alright let's read now listen close everybody how many believes that Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit watch here let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first he's trying to get it out of their head that he's coming right then so there's got to be a falling away from the church first see come over in the Laodicean age and that's that man of sin be revealed the man of sin and unbelief in the Holy Ghost the man of sin that's what brother Branham call unbelief and the Holy Ghost unbelief be revealed the son of perdition like Judas was the treasurer of the church who opposes and exalts and stuff above all of that's called God or that is worshipped so that be as God sitteth in the temple of God brother is their personal Earth outside the Vatican that does that where is it at and notice now there is a there's a great falling away right there's always this great falling away before something tremendous is about to happen and if I can just go back and use Judas he fell away before Jesus went to the cross right he fell away and you know and here here we're gonna have the same thing kind of happened today a great falling away glory to God it's an evil spirit in order for God's Word to be fulfilled this evil spirit has to anoint somebody in order to bring it to pass can I go and just bring that out to you amen let's first kings wet 22 thank you very much first Kings 21 22 all right I found it thank you so much for forgetting that amen see you know we read the Bible we believe the Bible hey man I'm giving you the quote from the Bible first Kings 22 hallelujah I like this now I'm not gonna read the whole chapter but let me just try to find exactly where I want to be yet this is um oh yeah verse 35 I think is where where is that says okay thank you a man I forgot to look this one up y'all say first Kings 22 okay alright I had 20 21 okay thank you very much yeah I think I got to go before that we're in the book we in the book so let me let's start at verse 13 when I'm without what I'm showing that these evil spirits that they can come from the Lord but their purpose for coming is God has certain things that he needs to fulfill my an order for David to become king an evil spirit came from the Lord to get Saul all out of whack now I got something else to say about song so die with the spirit all that's all made it [Music] Saul still made it with a evil spirit on him because when he died what Saul did he told he said we don't kill all the wizards and witches and everything we're gonna get them out of there he said we burned all of that we found anybody doing their gonna die but when Saul could not hear from God he went and found himself a woman a man that had familiars that worked him for me his spirits and she called up the spirit of Samuel she curled it up and she say she say wait a min you deceive me you the king and you dressed in disguise and you you do you deceive me I'm not supposed to be doing so I say so what you see say I seek God's coming up they said what do you look like start this problem with the problem I said that standard please call him up from me shame it came up said why you wake me on my wrist talking to him it's a you say okay by this time tomorrow still a prophet already dead but still a prophet come back and say say by this time tomorrow you and your sons will be with me so wherever samuel was saul with an evil spirit went to the same place and if so make it then I know everyone that belongs to me gonna make it okay that that right there give it Dabo my own battles with everything that you've been allowed to do you still couldn't separate them but I'll show you how powerful Greece is the man died with an evil spirit the last thing he did was working something evil went to battle and died now his death it wasn't good it wasn't good don't lord it even in his death because people you know got this thing well you know if a man commits suicide you know he's not gonna make it well you read your Bible that's why you got to read all your Bible because you read one chapter it look like Saul committed suicide and if you stop there you'll go around preaching Saul committed suicide and you know what if you just aim that you'll be exactly right on that Scripture but if we take you to the next look in the next chapter you see a story was told about this young man say and he come telling David said no no no I got the throne I got the kid I got I got this up this this this the crown I got all this man here you know I'm David it's all yours I'm bringing it to you like he had done something David said I tell me the story say I saw Saul and he hit following sport but he did not die and he asked me to slay him anything they say mmm-hmm you did what yeah he asked me to stem and I sprayed him I made sure he was dead and I took his crown and I brought it straight here to you David he was looking for position David began to accent some questions now who you were you from who you people we Amalekites malachite these were the same people saw was supposed to stay and because he did not slay them guess what God allowed when the malachite to come back and slay em so you better kill your mama cocksman for your Amalekites before your malachite kill you you better kill them but here Saul didn't do that but but salt salt here this man so he didn't die a man kill himself he tried to but it wasn't successful another a malachite killed him and David David even and all that grief David was not happy that Saul died that's why you know you can't get up talk about no they went out from us because he was not of us you don't do nothing like that you don't you have the Spirit of God some people rejoice seeing somebody fall you got a devil on you you got an evil spirit you don't rejoice in that like that the Angels rejoiced when people repent how you come rejoice when people fall but here you know look at this and I don't even know where I was I don't lost myself I'm Gary I was getting ready to go I'm going back to Makai but I was saying something else there but yeah the suicide stuff so Dave I mean Saul did not commit suicide right so so when you say we say and I'm so glad I that's why so I'm good to go to church y'all go to church you don't know when you hear other preachers not just your pastor get to meetings and go out there and hear things I went to a meeting last year and the brother got to preaching about suicide and how how folks say out you know you can't make it less you I mean if you commit suicide you ain't gonna make it there cuz the Bible say thou shalt not kill say now you got to be careful yes the Bible just say that should I kill but there was a man that made it that committed suicide who Sampson now wait a minute I am not condoning people committing suicide see I'm sorry I raised it up every once in a while I am NOT sitting here condoning it I come I catch that evil spirit and don't sit there and well brother Jack see it don't you do that and if you if you if you don't tell God that's right you said that do that you might not make it but I'm just telling you how that you've got to make sure the scripture aligns with Scripture it's the grace of God hey man you don't know who's gonna get it who ain't gonna get it amen see so you know but when you look at something like that you know Samson Samson said you know God let me die with these Philistines and when he pushed them pilis samson died i was suicide that's what it was they meant it was not murdered it was suicide all right I'm back over here in 1st Kings I'm talk about these evil spirits that come from God evil spirits Eve's fear from the Lord a man and there's many others that I could read but here I want to talk about this evil spirit brother Branham makes a statement said he said look at job a perfect manner just man God permitted the evil devil to come upon him and chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit see so evil spheres God uses evil spheres many times to work out his plan and his will God uses the evil spirit to work out his plan and his will I'm going on but you know one time in the Bible there was a man that was sinning in the church he was sleeping with his mother-in-law that's just downright wrong sleeping with it it's in the book of Corinthians he was sleeping with his mother-in-law and and Paul had to set things straight Paul had to set it straight said no you don't you don't do nothing like that and and just let him come to church or just let him just you know no no no no no no we got to get this thing straight right so so Paul Paul Paul said said what y'all need to do is turn him loose turn him over to the devil and what happens that God will God will relief in evil spirits own that may say you know what happened we cover people too much under the blood we cut them under the blood so our prayers come sometimes some people you gotta stop praying for when you don't turn them over to God let God handle it and say say what God would do yield he'll release an evil spirit to go bring that person right back to where they supposed to be evil spirit will chase them later on that same man that they did that to over the next chapter the next book he repented and he was back in line after an evil spirit come on oh that happened brother band have talked about I'm going but you know he talked about how this church did that one time that the son preaches boy sometimes preachers have a lot of problems but the preachers boy had had a problem with his daddy in and he didn't want to get things right and the daddy tried to talk to him I know I'm making that right they went some other deacons Western I ain't making nothing right I don't care I'm not doing it they've tried to talk to him about what he was doing it was wrong and and so the daddy came and said I'd give that boy just such a such a time to come come back to church and make that thing right if he don't we gonna turn him over to the Lord his own boy and he stood up there they gave they looked at the watch okay as at this point in time we turn in store and so over to the Lord everybody start praying for him his own boy say all of a sudden few weeks go by few months go by boy ends up in the hospital and when he got to the hospital doctors had no idea what was going wrong with big trying to figure we don't understand what's going on go get his daddy well what what what does daddy got to do it is we gotta try to figure the gold get his daddy you know what just go get his daddy daddy come to the room doctors walk out daddy I'm sorry that's what he was up at the back going on about his business had he not repented he would have died right there then let me tell you something God got a weird getting hold of people he can give you a dream if you neglect the dream you got other ways you can put your flat on your back and you'll be calling for somebody would y'all come pray for me cuz ya'll believe in divine healing brother Branham used to had in prayer cloths anybody got one of course yes of course because I got a evil spirit I'm here to help you and I realize a number the devil made you do what you did that ain't Jude that's the devil ain't coming against you I'm coming against the devil I love what brother Shawn I said he said I ain't picking on you I'm picking off you so I'm back over here how evil spirits can come from the Lord yeah y'all bear with me and I'm gonna read this and I think I got one more quote to read and I'm I'm just it's all chopped up I feel but nonetheless I think that the message got home all right look at this and and evil spirit income would come from the Lord but it has a purpose for doing that let's read first first Kings 22 let's start at verse 13 a man anytime you see a man something like this occurring God is doing that for a reason is to work out his wheel a man is to work out his will so here it says in verse 13 the messenger that was going to call Micaiah and just to step this up a little bit they had already a have want to go to battle and he had all these prophets about 400 of them come up and they they were saying and even even Jehoshaphat was with them so the two kings of Israel was divided but here the two kings Jonathan here a habit come together and they decided they're gonna go to battle together Jehoshaphat you know he should have prayed first before he got out there right but here he didn't pray first and and then he actually acts before you got involved if we got connected as he should have prayed first but before I went to Bali say is there a prophet that we can hear and four hundred I'm coming let's dance the Lord you know all I mean just my god you can imagine the service that they had let's tell the Lord you're gonna destroy take these horns with us you can destroy you're gonna do this to time do that you're gonna be victorious and 400 of them said the exact same thing so hostile that said wait a minute 400 men saying the exact same thing something wrong with this picture he actually means it at least one more profit and they have tried to hide that profit evil spirits try to hide that profit I mean I yeah there is one but I hate him evil spirit will hate truth I hate him you hate him why cuz everytime we prophesy he always prophesied against me every time you know I'm just letting you know right now watch this man gonna be against us everybody else that go this men gonna be against us just go get him let's pick it up and the messenger that was going to call mkhaya 70m saying behold now the words of the Prophet declared good unto the king with one mouth let thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good so see there coaching him on what to say but a true prophet don't say what men tell him to say and micaiah said as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak so he came to the king and the King said unto enter him macaé shall we go against ramoth-gilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the other king notice I mean he just ain't even pray about it none yet going prosper now you know what something coming out of McKay's mouth even 1/2 knew even a hab knew that that one right look at what happened here it says I go across for the Lord shall deliver them to enter unto the hand of the king and the King said unto Him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord now he notice he never used the name of the Lord just going prosper oh my god verse 17 he said I saw all Israel scattered apartment Hill as a sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said of Jehoshaphat did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil see some people are like going to churches like that where they're gonna get told the truth [Music] and they said here thou therefore the word of Lord I saw the Lord sitting on the throne his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left all the hosts of heaven all the angels everything there look at this and the Lord said who shall persuade a hat that he may go up and fall that Rhema feel yet there was a scripture that was already promised for this to happen right he was already it was spoken against that I mean the dogs gonna lick up his blood and all of the kind of stuff would happen some kind of way that had to be that had to come to pass and in order for God's Word to be fulfilled evil spirit made it happen and for evil spirit made it happen in the days of 8 1/2 if an evil spirit made it happen in the days of Saul to get him off the throne and evil spirit will come along the day it comes people to fall away let me go on verse verse 20 says the Lord said who should persuade II have that he may go up and follow that ramoth-gilead in one setting mr. banner and another set on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto Him where with let me tell you let me just drop this off with y'all it's not that God didn't know how to get this done just understand how things happen in the spiritual realm right since then the Lord said unto Him where with and he said I will go forth and I would be a lying spirit and the mouth of all his prophets what one spirit of knowing that 400 prophets I would be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade them and prevail also go forth and do so got permission from God the lion spirit needed permission the evil spirit can I tell y'all something when y'all going through stuff on your job them spirits got permission got permission before they even came to you they had permission and the reason God allowed them because you were just like Jobe in his eyes go ahead and do it go ahead and do it they will not curse me the devil can't do nothing to you without God's permission and then when he do it let me tell you another thing he got boundaries stopping points say you can you can you can touch his family you can touch this but you can't act his life you can get sick but you can't take his life stopping points verse 23 now therefore behold the LORD hath put a lying spirit look at that the Bible say the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these that prophets now it was a notice micaiah stand the Lord put this spirit there no the spirit actual permission and God said you can have permission just like brother Branham gave permission for them at the Epilepsy to go into them twenty-eight people if we behold the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these my prophets and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee but Zedekiah the son of Janina went near to see he if I'm not mistaken yeah this is the one that he said Akaya is the one that had his forms you find him in verse 11 he had the horns he had did something so magnificent and now now now he'd been told that he was a liar a line prophet so look at what the line prophecy a seal Spirit will hit you strike you down with an ax consumption - jimana went near and spoke Macario on the cheek and said which way to went the spirit little hard for me to speak unto thee you can tell you ain't got the right spear you hittin preaches you didn't hit the prophets you know you ain't got the right spirit you know this ain't come from God my guys never hold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into inner chamber the heart that still and the king of Israel said take Makai and carry him back I'm - I'm on the governor of the city and and - joash the king's son and say thus sayeth the king put this fellow in in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace now hey you know he figured he would punish him for speaking thus saith the Lord you don't know when when the pastor's speak through people try to punish the past all right I hope you can read between their lives look I got other ways we got to just see what God says say what it's worth seeing right man what kind of church you want to go to a church with sinking huh a church where people just do whatever they want to do and only way the hell amen being I have no no no praise the Lord I'm being nice today I'm being real nice today but I see everything I ain't crazy I'm being nice I'm being hospitable but I see everything hallelujah glory to God and like I said I'm getting rid of Eastern bread of affliction he came ready to go to prison he gave me and he still won't stop talking like I said if thou return at all in peace the Lord have not spoken about me and it's that harken of people every one of you on his way to prison pretty much terms that you're gonna make it back from the battle and and what my kind said you're going to read they have died in the battle even trying to disguise himself but God saw and had an arrow just come out of nowhere and he died fulfilling the Word of God and an evil spirit helped bring that thing to pass so I see a great falling away it's an evil spirit helping to bring that thing to pass I want to just read one quote cat alone kind of lengthy but I think it would be very helpful this is out of the message Ephesians sure change and I want y'all to see something this brother branham brought something out there and I'm just gonna read it I'm gonna try not to make too many comments but hopefully you can have your spiritual you can see right in there and and pick up on these things no less I have somewhat against these quoting revelation 2 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the Spirit is not speaking to the original Saints in Ephesus alone when it's when we're talking about Ephesians two I'm sorry revelation two for that scripture nevertheless I have somewhat against it because left that first level the Spirit was not just speaking to those in Ephesians church age all right this was this was a message actually coming all the way down to our age now look at this nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love to understand this time must realize that the Spirit is not speaking to the original sex of Ephesus as long this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all the generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself and the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there being there there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame okay all right y'all start counting generations from the time the Prophet was here to where we are right now and see what's going on I mean it's getting to a point where people trying to actually act as if God never sent a prophet if they could erase his name they would that's an evil spirit thank God even people in denominations acknowledge they acknowledge his ministry but here you got people are still my god and so I'm Betsy the people that were close to there at that time what they saw is not what we saw we're believing it just based on what we heard right but but there were some people that saw some things that you'll never be able to convince them you'll never be able to convince but as that group is dying off there's another group coming up and the ones that unfortunate did not get a chance to experience it they're fading they're fading and you know whereas the generations go by is gonna be more and more fading all right stay with me stay with me not everybody gonna fade and the fourth generation a man but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original thing then God lights the fire so even though it might fade this is what I'm looking for God to light the fire again amen so thank God likes to fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than is there any truth to apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with the truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptist Methodist etc that is exactly what they are - they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire ain't staying right with Garland yeah you may love God but the original fire guy has died down and they're not the same anymore can I just keep reading the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade instead of that church being on fire with God it has cooled off and become a bit formal that is what is happening that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formula the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought to them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them people don't want to be identified as Christians anymore they just want to go right along with the rest of the world amen my god sisters want to put on the pants and wear to make wear the earrings they want to be like the world glory to God look around look around look around we don't do that amen right I mean and it's just it's a shame you know you know when you start you start seeing this spirit just kind of released amongst the people right you start seeing that's not that's not who you are that's never been who you are you won't accept it from the world you'll never get it from the church never cuz we don't believe that amen praise the Lord I mean I see stuff posted on Instagram I'm not liking that I'm not liking that you in pants ain't got nothing to say on that but pray that's what I do I pray when I see stuff like that somebody I mean here you know the pastor following you you know that why you gonna post something like that somebody posting curse words and stuff the pastor following you other believers are following you you want us to read that nonsense you need to watch what you post if you can't do it for yourself do it for others and if you can't handle it thing why don't you just get off line and what you're telling me is you can't stop following me I can do that but the Holy Ghost won't stop calling you and he can do a lot more damage than I can and when you end up flat on your back somewhere then then let's see if you stand tell the pastor to stop following me y'all better stop playing with God you have to live a life 24/7 never I'm coming home I'm coming home these some time I got to do things like this I love I love I love this I love God and I love helping God's people a man look I'm going on I see he said there is exactly what they are - they're they're not Christians you have to you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them are not right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they're not the same anymore oh I'm fun that's okay needed to say it again the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out and the spirit all begins begins to fade and instead of that the church being on fire with but with the fire of God it has cooled off from become a bit formal that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit form of the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of him thus that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king list that they demanded a king to be like the other nations my god you know they demanded a king to be like the other nations the brother branham told us how to do Church 20 I'll stay with me they were just kind of fold this right here brother branham told us how to do church order he told us to give a song leader up there let the song leader sing a few songs didn't agree to come out and and all those things like that he didn't tell us to have a priest team you know what appraised income from looking at other churches and see we want to we want to em and and what what happens eventually go from the praise teams do we have the sisters leading the service and if you don't stop there you have the sisters preaching free the Lord so somewhere you got to have a stopping point and we're not gonna cross this line but oftentimes we look at what other people do and you and tell me the circus this song sir is not anointed we ain't got no wind got no praise team but it's still anointed well what's the matter what happened praise team you go ahead we just not doing it here what's the matter with not happening what's the matter what doing it the way the prophecy man Lorna God see the brace team went to a praising dance team it stopped being just a little you know people up in worship and now we got people twisting these bodies and we got choreographed dance sin we got all those things praise the Lord we don't praise dance here no we don't we do not there would be no praise dancing none now I mean it's one thing and don't get me wrong now I know that the Saints were made they do sprung up do ba everybody be jumping that's not praise dancer that's just that's just worship right we didn't practice that none of us were at home we even have to come together so now let's get this you know when they say sprung up man you not know practice we just everybody came to church and they saw you know and or you know you or you'd get a Pope ooh you know I mean that that's not praise Allah that just work that's what we do in worship but it's no practice today I mean let's take it practice that's when you know you know moved over to something different praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God Amen all right and if I took you to Africa and the way that they dance you couldn't you couldn't handle it right brother deeds came back and showed us one and one of the dances hey he say he was just telling singing said brothers now that one practice is just one man the whole congregation was not doing that but one man come down he start walking on and you look at like what in the world is feather he just that's how he works so I brother big brother they say well brother what this is me and he had only one in the cognition to it he got his own he's in his own spirit he even acts nobody to practice that hey hey now when I do this now it went like that he had his own personal revelation what he was saying say what I'm trying to what I'm trying to see you gotta know Africa cuz they don't have what we got bottom don't have what we got my god I could tell y'all some stories I'm trying to get home but but but he say you say what that mean to me is that he's a big big God I can't handle him he's so big see it meant something to him it was own personal revelation it's personal dances personal way of expressing himself to God and shouting you can shout there's more than Boyan event that song for the psalmist thing it was it that was that was that blood son that should it that somebody should have just cut up in him I mean should have cut ah rugs all stuff didn't and man man we should have saw holes in the carpet from that song y'all know shouting one of the oldest oldest ways of worshipping God that there was I'm talk about before we even came to earth because the question was asked where was that when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sing together so don't let nobody take your shout if there ever was a time to shout this is the time now yeah if they get one y'all let that thing go please stop being so reserved up in here look I think I told somebody got been too good for me to be too quiet [Music] [Applause] y'all get that feeling just let it go then they'll work around it so high so need to just keep on singing all right I'm gonna get this out you know you got to stop with it come on with somebody glory to God if I had one y'all won't stop me from getting it on tape right I don't practice I don't try I just can't get it I can't get it but if I had one boy y'all would be able to stop me I'm gonna let y'all know right now that maybe that's why God didn't give me one because I I will disrupt the service hallelujah sometimes you know and you see other people shout it just you try to get a little piece of hallelujah alright let me finish this up Church come on come on come on hallelujah where was I had on that quote man the king I see thank you very much so that was it the second generation was coming on I was just like Israel okay are they demanded King to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway now when they started trying to be like everybody else they actually rejected God that's some evil spirit don't realize the heights but they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it is that long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially you will never see some people wearing pants never still wearing makeup and see I got a message that I got a preach on that about conviction right because that people lose that conviction now but they do have it because when they get around you like old Lord they get right they try to avoid you and all the other kind of stuff because they do have some type of conviction when people stop calling you they don't want to hang out with you no more something going wrong somewhere Amen because they know you ain't gone you ain't gonna put look look if garden gave me nothing else if I don't even understand the message I know that dressing like that ain't right glory to God hallelujah hey man hallelujah we don't dress that way not the sisters from this church not under this pastor we don't dress that way amen glory to God let the church say man somebody's hey man so yeah if you want me to sing it I sing it to you they put in a choir instead of singing on the Gulf in themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a moment and ran and ran it by man they soon began to read books what read books that weren't fit to read they stopped reading a Bible they read another stuff right let's read books or if I could just say they read websites they go to websites that they should be going to spiritual websites stay there stay there stay there I'm going on with the stay some began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and ghosts came in and took over the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the Spirit was gone oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes is about all that is left paragraph 89 - - is where I met a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great apostle of love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God and first John 5:3 he says for this is a love of God that we keep his Commandments his word one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ let me say it again one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ so often people think they're going to find Christ you actually just left them and what happens that you don't have to go pick them up where you're left people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they love God but not obeying his word oh the Ephesian Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so subtly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big you can see it out there in the open it is under cover and they're bringing it by way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late that is an evil spirit of unbelief that is coming in so subtle and destroying so quickly Church I advise you a man like the proper setting this first quote that we read so you've got to be versed to know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to the word don't believe it you stay with that word god bless you let's pray father this is a hour that's so series and how the Holy Spirit wants to continue to warn the church there's an evil spirit and as we just brought out sometimes that that that spirit has to get permission from God in order to be able to produce the fulfillment of Scripture we can see it all around us not only see it all around us but we are impacted by what we see loved ones that are impacted some that just do not know what the devil is doing but God help us to to receive revelation and instruction that in doing so we would be able to withstand and discern the attack of the enemy in this hour I'm so glad that uh Saul might have had that evil spirit a Saul still made it so glad that but your profit share these things with us that we could have hope in this tower God we we won't give up hope even when we're gets hope we still believe in hope help us to stand firm understand true on the Word of God not to isolate a separate ourselves but to continue to be who you've called us to be and Father and being that that we might win some to Christ we trust Lord that something was said hearts would be edified hearts would be a man Lord Fayette and Lord Jesus we could we could we could walk out of here and that we got could take warning to these things that are going on all around us if there's one that's not living the way that they're supposed to be living amen and your presence Lord let him take warning to these things help us look to align ourselves but the hour is too late for us to play games with the devil it's time to live right we must live right some Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you Jesus glory to God amen amen song says I will be what you called me to be I say yes Laurent yes I agree with your words I agree with what's been revealed from Genesis to Revelation I want to live it I want to express it and I want to just be a church member but I want to be the Bride of Christ Church I invite you let's stand two feet that's brothers Solomon prepared to come and close this out

God and lower for us to turn our backs on the word of God that was spoken in this our Lord is still a word that came from you and we must believe we must feed on the word the spoken word in this age we're so grateful Lord God that you sent a prophet on way you promised and you promised it to us Lord and you fulfilled your promise we're so grateful Lord God for ministers that still saved what the prophet said and father I'm so glad to be amongst people that believes what a prophet said and father I pray that you continue to fortify us behind your word Lord when we listen to the tapes when we read your word father may that word sink down into the depths of our souls and we become one with it written epistles read of all men Oh God may you have complete preeminence in your children and word that we just heard Lord God may we meditate on these things Lord and father may we just go out and be the light of this world Lord being continue to be salty Lord God that people may see Jesus Lord and in yarn for you Lord Father we surrender Lord we just ask for God that as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence but you abide with your children again lower part your spirit of fresh for you people we love you we praise you and thank you Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ amen god bless you brothers and sisters our brethren will come and dismiss no I agree by these I hear [Music] passionately is to be what you call me to me and that's what I will be [Music]
