may we leave change forever more in your Pres presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to turn to the Book of Joshua the first chapter the Book of Joshua the first chapter and amen we've just been here in a bit of a a a study and series on on walking in the promises of God and just want to share a little portion with that to you tonight in Joshua chapter 1 and verse number six it's a very very familiar reading to us in Joshua 1 and: 6 be strong and of good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest I love that that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest not that thou mayest be in defeat but thou mayest Prosper now this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shal make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen notice all these blessings are promised to those who can stay with the word if you can stay with the word you can prosper and you can have good success in the book of First John chapter 1 1 John chapter 1 another very familiar reading 1 John chapter 1 and verse number five the Bible here says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is ly amen and in him is no Darkness at all now if we say that we have fellowship with him and we walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light I love that word walk it means to progress if we progress as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here tonight I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I would take a title tonight I want to speak to you on this thought of walking in the light of prosperity and success amen walking in the light of prosperity and success brother Bram would say in 1952 he said and I stand as Moses of old now we all know he fulfilled both a Moses commission amen as well as a Joshua Commission he said I stand as Moses of old standing in the breach for the people God bless this people bless the pastors and churches every church that is cooperating even those who are not cooperating that are indifferent he said God I don't pray for nothing else but they might see this marvelous happy glorious privilege that Christians have and walk in the light amen that they would see this glorious happy amen marvelous privilege that Christians have and walk in the light now I find it very amazing that as Believers amen that we have been called amen out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light now you all know that we are not here tonight just as church members or just amen as religious people but we are here amen as Believers and I believe that Believers are the children of the day amen they are not the Children of the Night in other words amen we are not walking in the darkness of this hour amen but rather we are walking in the light where God has called us into then therefore tonight I can say to you amen that we are the children of the light now amen Believers are the children of the day they are the children of the light let me say this Believers amen are not just professors amen but Believers are possessors in other words we're not here just professing the promises of God but we are here as a generation to possess the promises of God and you all know that a prophet of God said that the promises of God Amen would not be easily handed to the church but rather when the promises of God are revealed it is the declaration of war that if you are going to possess it you're going to have to fight for it therefore we have a clear understanding tonight amen that footsteps means possession in Joshua 1:3 he said every place amen that the soul of your foot shall tread upon amen that have I given unto you amen as I said unto Moses now I love that word there that Joshua uses into this land amen do you all know that land actually was territory amen their inheritance was their territory in other words they had no inheritance in Egypt that's why they had to come out of Egypt but there was a promise land where there were borders but inside those borders was their inheritance he said now Joshua was over there walking around after he crossed over Jordan amen then he began to eat some of the old corn he said now look Joshua amen give him a vision and said now my servant Moses is dead amen now rise and go over this Jordan amen thou and all the host of Israel and the Lord thy God will be with thee no man amen shall stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses amen so will I be with you amen I don't have time to slow down and preach all these ears but I just want to say this brother said the most powerful thing to Joshua amen was the Revelation that as I was with Moses amen so will I be with you he said why was that such a powerful Revelation he said because Joshua knew all the mistakes amen that Moses made amen but in spite of all the mistakes God never left Moses and it become a comfort to Joshua amen that if Moses made mistakes but God stayed with him amen I will make mistakes but the same God Amen that stayed with Moses amen will stay with me I want to say to you tonight friends we are not here amen trying to reach sinless Perfection we are perfected through the blood of Jesus Christ listen we will have failures we will have shortcomings we will make mistakes hey but I got good news for you amen as I was with Joshua amen so will I be with those who will follow Joshua into the territory or into the land amen only be good courageous amen do not be discourage just keep moving on I will be with you every place you set the souls of your feet is a possession for you he said Footprints means possession brother and what the church needs tonight is some more Footprints amen what the church needs tonight is some more Footprints over here on this land amen don't you hang around Jordan too long amen let's get out of here and let's see what we got every time that he made a footprint amen it was a possession he said Brothers It's Time For Us Amen to make Footprints we cannot stay right here in the same camp amen the fire is moving on Amen let's move on from glory to glory amen from Bible experience to Bible experience let's unfold and open up our hearts let's raise up our hands to God amen let's keep Saye amen let's stay in the Bible don't you get outside of that word amen you stay right there in the word amen can I say this to you amen sometimes we can stop and look back and brother Jack we can remember the good old days amen I just tell you amen since I've been here this week I've been thinking amen about some of those first times I ever come down here amen some of y'all remember the first time we was over there in the choir of the fire amen and the power of God fa and the Holy Ghost move but can I say something we can't go back there amen yes God was there amen but the same God that was there amen is right here tonight amen you say well we're not in that building what difference does it make amen the same Pillar of Fire amen that world through that building is right here tonight listen as long as there's a land amen there's an inheritance to possess don't you sit down and say I wish I could go back the God that was there is the god that is here Amen brother Jack I couldn't help it I pulled up on the parking lot there Sunday morning amen over at rapturing Faith amen and I just about had to hold the tears back amen thinking about all those conventions I told brother Mike I said I I I remember here it felt like the walls was breathing in this place amen but can I say this thank God we don't have to look back to Memories we don't have to paint a fire of what happened 10 years ago but there's a Joshua generation on the face of the Earth tonight and we refuse to sit down we refuse to quit possessing our inheritance and I'll just go ahead and say it the best days are not behind us they're just ahead of us amen there's more Giants to slay there's more testimonies to have there's more healings to take place there's more prodical to come home there's more miracles to be manifested there's more Revival to be had there's more Revelation to be received oh come on Joshua generation as I was with Moses so will I be with you only be strong and very courageous Hallelujah you say well I wish it could be handed to me amen anything that's handed to you thank you brother or given to you amen you don't appreciate it but when you fight for it come on when you fight for it you appreciate it more God told Moses he said I give you Palestine I swept out all the houses and hung up the curtains you just go right up in there and live wouldn't that have been it they never would have enjoyed it they never would have enjoyed their inheritance had they not fought for it now I know that's hard to wrap our minds around amen but we'll never enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost unless we had to fight for him brother B said see amen I'll give it to you now listen it's full of giants you will have to fight every inch of the way but every place that The Souls of your footsteps amen that's a possession so you go and take it and sure as I was with Moses I will be with you I'll say this to you tonight church I believe it's time amen for the Joshua generation Amen to walk around in the land of our inheritance amen and see what we are air to we are air to more than we've allowed the devil to tell us we're air to right the devil says we can only have this much I say we can have as much amen as in the land or the territory that God has ordained for us to have now when you start studying this how many knows amen that in the Old Testament amen there was a Joshua amen we all know in the Old Testament there was a Joshua but do you know if there was a Joshua there had to be a Caleb and do you know in this day we're living amen there is a Joshua and there is a Caleb again brother said in the church age book said now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs dead he said now Jehovah means jeh Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader so there was a Joshua who represented a prophet that would come to the generation amen that would leave the church the same way amen that Paul it in the beginning but there was not just a Joshua brother Jack there was a Caleb and Caleb represented those amen who stayed true with Joshua brother said did you notice God did not move Israel or let her go into the promise land until it was his own appointed time he said now the people might have put pressure on Joshua and said the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua you're all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly amen something is wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them I love this he waited for a clearcut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership amen now that's a powerful Point Church that God would place not part of the leadership ship amen but the full leadership into Joshua's hands because he stayed with the word and God could trust Joshua but not the others amen so it will repeat in this day the same problems amen the same presses so Joshua's responsibility amen was to stay with the word and to lead the people into the land but Caleb's responsibility was to stay in step with Joshua brother B said keep in step with Joshua that's right get the new grapes and the new Pentecostal wine he said get drunk on it let's go forward let's follow the steps of our great leader and Conquer brother them footsteps means possession let's just keep walking into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what will happen back there and what somebody else is doing are you hearing me keep your eyes on Jesus amen the Joshua the leader just keep moving on into deeper depths and higher Heights until you possess everything that God promised you in his word he said all men cannot receive this this is hid to the eyes of the world and it is foolish to them but those who are born and elected to eternal life they believe it and we see the hour that we're living let's go forward remembering this that we have something behind us listen we talked about it we have some good days behind us and yes Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're in those days he said but there's something behind us amen but there's something in us and he said there's something before us amen something behind us something in Us and something more for us he was he is and shall come he's the same Jesus that was is the same Jesus tonight and he's the same Jesus that shall come let me let me sound a trumpet to you we don't have to paint a fire amen and try to warm our young people by a painted fire we don't have to talk about 20 years ago and 30 years ago and 40 years ago I say we ought to be birthing some testimonies amen right here out of this church amen give our young people some landmarks in their generation listen as we live amen we're going to possess the land we're going to possess testimonies we're going to possess victories we're going to say powerful manifestation let me just say this but we're going to have to do some walking we're going to have to do some walking amen used to be an old brother back home in Tennessee he'd say it's time to quit sitting on the premises and start walking on the Promises I'll tell you I think it's a good thing friends Amen to quit sitting in the church and saying well let brother Jack go get it or let sister Erica go let somebody go get it you know I say get up and go get it yourself you want the joy of the Lord go get it you want your victory go get it you want your peace back go get it you are under an anointing of Joshua hallelujah amen you you you see it all over the place in the age we're living and there's a bunch of advertisements amen how much walking do I have to do to lose weight Amen to have to walk a mile or two miles or or five miles drop 10 pounds y'all know what I'm talking about amen can I say this to you that's in the natural amen but what about in the spiritual you say how much walking a have to do brother B said look at Hebrews he said by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they walked around them seven days but said before one rock ever come out of the building of the walls of Jericho amen Joshua walked around the walls he was shouting the victory now can I just say something to you as long as Israel was under the dispensation of Moses they were on the defense amen the enemy chased them to the Red Sea the enemy chase them out of Egypt but when they come underneath Joshua they move from the defense to the offense in other words it was no longer the enemy chasing them but the Gars now them chasing the enemy come on church amen they didn't chase Joshua away from the walls of Jericho Joshua would chase them to the walls of Jericho and they ran inside those walls but you know what Joshua said he said you can run but you can't hide he said we'll tear them walls down to get to you bunch of devils you will not hold God's people hostage any longer and there is a five-fold Ministry on the earth tonight who is not backing up Amen to the assaults of hell we're not backing up to the powers and the pressures of this age we got a sword in our hand and we're going to go forward and deliver God's people hallelujah I say addictions can't have you I say habits can't have you I say Cancer Cannot have you you are a part of a Joshua gener ation we have been anointed to take back everything Hallelujah I may not see it but I see the Victory and if I can see the victory I know the walls were coming down walk around those walls seven times seven days brother said but he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise that God made how much can you walk around that wheelchair direct quote how much can you you walk around that cancer how much can you walk around that sin shouting the victory that God gives the promise when you can see him who is invisible when that pulsation comes into your heart oh my brother Jack and begins to pulsate I'm the Lord who Health all thy diseases when you can see that everything else weakens away before the first rock ever mov moves before the first symptom ever leaves if you can just see the promise of God if you can just see the promise of God it will literally weaken away he said Joshua looked at the Unseen and he walked around those walls believing it would happen it all depends on what you're looking at can I say something to you you just keep walking God will do the opening God don't need you to worry about how it's going to open he don't need you to worry about how it's going to change he just needs you Amen to put on your walking shoes and walk in the promises of God and testify things you do not see you do not feel you do not reason you do not imagine but in your soul there is a super sense controlled by the six sense and you believe it's going to happen you have his word and his blood is to take care of it everything that he put in the atonement asirs we have it by faith and watch what takes place it will work let me go on and say this amen that Joshua listen they had a vday under Moses at the Red Sea but Joshua had a vday amen at the River Jordan amen at Joshua had a vday at Jericho there he is in the month of April probably a mile across Jordan amen mountains up there the snow is Mountain all over the plains the river was spread and no doubt the enemy said now God Amen is quite a general isn't he let his army right up here the time of spring when the Rivers had its worst when it's the worst time to cross and then lead his army up there and lead them to cross no he said God lets disappointment happen to show Victory how many's ever been disappointed you thought you finally had the answer you thought the Breakthrough was finally there man this is the Shouting Time day amen but then all of a sudden everything you thought worked out amen collapsed right in your face can I say this you only see that those things amen that seem to be burying you and upsetting you they are trials they are things but to stand still and focus your glasses on the word of God and speak the word and just walk forward that's all there is to do said we all get to a time we say God I don't know what to do I'm up against it here here's what he says speak the word and say Lord I believe and just start walking forward and God does the opening up of the sea you just keep walking he said another place dear God may we not fret now after this and remember that these trials and things come upon us are only done because God loves us he gives it to us because he's got confidence in us he believes that we have faith and love for him listen that we'll be able to overcome it right there is Caleb's confession when he came up to the mountain there was the sons of anoch there but what did Caleb say we are well able to overcome it give me my Mountain my my my my may we not fret and stew about it may we just walk up there and speak the word and walk forward the Seas will open and the V days will come may this be one of the greatest V Days of our time so we are commissioned under Joshua who has the full leadership of God Amen to lead Caleb into the land we are commissioned to keep in step with Joshua even though the land is full of giants God now let me just say this to you we got to walk forward with undying faith in the word can I tell you where our victories come from our victories come by the word can I say something to you our weapon is the word brother B said our weapon is not carnal worldly things our weapon is Holy Ghost weapons amen I'll say this to you our weapon is praise amen our weapon is worship our weapon is Thanksgiving unto God our weapon is the preaching of the word our weapon is the laying on of hands our weapon is the casting out of the devil our weapon is spiritual but it is Mighty unto God to the pulling down of strongholds well glory to God you have been equipped with the most powerful weapon that has ever been placed into the hands of man and it's called the word of God you know what Paul said he said the word Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick it is powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it is piercing even to the dividing the sun of Soul and Spirit of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the fals and intents of the heart I love what a prophet of God said he said the sword is plenty sharp so you don't have to worry about when you get there is it going to be sharp enough to slay the giant the sword is plenty sharp it goes beyond the physical it goes into the spiritual realm and picks up the thoughts of the heart and reveals them the spirit of God the word of God he said now that word will cut in there if there's enough arm behind it to push it in it'll find its place and cut every promise out and give it to you if you just got the strong enough arm behind it amen the sword pick it up in an arm of faith can you take this instruction grip it tight and hold on to it notice we're no longer on the defense we on the offense and walk into the face of the enemy walk into the face of the enemy how can that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God so you take the sword of the word and every promise belongs to you so pick it up in a strong hand of faith and walk forward if you need healing cut it out with the word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you need salvation every promise in the Bible is yours now can I just say what a prophet said he said it's laying back in there and Satan is trying to hide it but take the sword and push through the darkness until the light of God shines in upon your soul and you have the promise God glory to God you need a strong hand of Faith you need a strong arm of Faith to pick up the sword of the spirit and face your enemy and drive the sword right into the face of your enemy and stand there and let the light of God Amen shine in upon your soul you say preacher what is the light of God brother B said the light of God is none other than the pillar of fire he said Israel got Palestine for a land and they left the old land down there they got Palestine it was a land flowing with milk and honey yes sir what did they leave they left the hot Sons under the Taskmaster down in Egypt what did they get for leaving that warm sunshine down there what did they get for leaving that warm sunshine down there they got to walk in the pillar of Fire's light Glory leaving that hot sun down there to walk in the light of God's Pillar of Fire he says what an exchange oh wouldn't you like an exchange like that well it's the same thing today you walk out of the light of this world the things that's of the world Amen to walk walk in the light of God Amen I don't have the picture maybe you can put it up there amen the pillar of fire over brother R's head amen can I make an announcement to you that Pillar of Fire amen is not in a filing cabinet Washington DC tonight amen that Pillar of Fire amen is not in a tomb in Jeffersonville neither is it in a grave in Jerusalem but I propose to you tonight that the pillar of fire is right here in West Palm Beach Florida it's right here in this building tonight come on Church we're not following a man we are following the pillar of fire and I know if there's brother Jack if there's anything I get in trouble for amen more than anything is preaching about this picture but I am not ashamed to be identified with the only Supernatural photograph that has ever been taken in the history of the world can I just preach a second that right there offends a lot of people you know why because they thinking has only come this High all they can see in that picture is the fact there's a man in it but can I tell you what my Bible said my Bible said let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you and if the mind that was in Christ being you it will bring every thought subject to the knowledge of God listen my thinking has gone beyond the fact that there is a man in that picture I thank God for my Joshua I thank God for my Prophet but above his head was the same pit of fire that led Moses that led Paul that led William random has returned in this Joshua generation come on Caleb put your walking shoes on pick up your sword your headship is here the general is here the captain of the host of the Lord is in this building tonight and he's not leading you away from your enemy he's leading you to your enemy well somebody shout hallelujah he's leading you to your enemy now I can preach right there check this Exodus 13 amen if you'll follow this line I'll be an enemy to your enemies I'll be an adversary to your adversaries I will be in your midst and I will cut off your enemy I Will Bless th bread and th water and I will take sickness away from thee what a blessing is on Caleb who can stay and step with Joshua to somebody say well I don't think that picture belongs in the church well pray tell me if we won't put it in the church where will we put [Music] it can I preach a second somebody say well are you saying every church has got to have one no I tell you what it boils down to it really don't boil down to whether you got one in the church or not it boils down to your attitude towards it I've been in mess Church church and they belittle it and make fun of it and call it a bunch of idolatry well let me say this this is one country boy that's still got enough guts to stand and say that is the logos of God that was in the beginning has come to the ending let me say this plain as a prophet said it he said and the logos has a part and the part of the logos is none other than the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother Jack how could I believe that I'm a part of the L God and be ashamed of it I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is the power of God under salvation I've done exchange my denominational ways all right we got rid of our denominational ways to walk in the light of God we threw it aside now come on church we threw it aside to walk in what a prophet taught right now some of y'all can fellowship with me on this brother brother Gary was sitting today telling me about how years ago amen the brother and sister Wesco came in the message and amen I get to thinking about that amen some of our elders years ago amen sister Ella God bless you amen come in this lot years ago and here we are some 20 30 40 years and now all of a sudden we got all kinds of YouTube preachers and all kinds of YouTube teachers amen that are coming before us and saying you can't believe a prophet here and you can't believe him this was his opinion and this was his idea you know what I say I say leave me alone I'm Caleb I'm sorry I'm Caleb and you know what I say Amen I'm just dumb enough to say it if it brought us this far it's going to take us the rest of the way hallelujah amen if our Baptist ideas were worth getting rid of 30 years ago what makes them any more valuable tonight amen if our Pentecostal Traditions were worth forsaken 30 years ago what makes them valuable tonight I know that devil and it's real this is not a man's message this is the message of the King on we come out of the world to walk in this light amen now I heard people they say well amen I don't like this and I don't like that and I don't like but you know brother Jack I've come to realize as as human beings you have a right to preach and teach whatever you feel God is leading your heart to teach brother B said if brother never wanted to teach Jehovah Witness Doctrine let him teach it that's right but can I say something take your Liberty to teach what you feel to teach but just don't call it for message all right when it directly contradicts what a prophet said and don't put pressure on me to believe your interpretation listen I'm not a dummy I can read what a prophet said you can read what a prophet said you can go in your homes and listen to the tapes you can hear Joshua speak to you and tell you where you belong and tell you what you belong in come on Church don't you let nobody lead you away from the voice of Joshua you are Caleb somebody say well can I preach he told me to take my Liberty somebody say well amen we don't believe in this we don't believe in what brother said there okay I don't have a problem with that amen just acknowledge that brother brandom said it but you don't feel to follow what he said instead of putting pressure on us calebs who were trying to take our mountain and keep in step with our Joshua is that okay we come out of the world to walk in the light of God and it leads us to the promised land I love what David said he said thou Hast delivered my soul from Death now will thou not deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the living another place David says I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I love this so the Believers are walking before the Lord in the light of the living as well as in the land of the living which means by the jack for none other than walking in the truth David says in Psalms 8611 he says teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name John says it like this he says I Rejoice greatly that I found of my children walking in the truth as we have received a commandment from the father again he says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth I love what a prophet says in Jubilee year for a man that comes to truth and fails to walk in truth all right then he has according to the scripture he's blasphemed or rejected the whole holy spirit of God and is a p pass the day of redemption again I can bring the truth but if you reject it and walk away I know the Bible says if you do that then there's no more remission of sins till you come and make that right again that's exactly right so if you see truth you walk in truth the minute you see truth is the minute you put on your walking shoes that's a direct quote and you start walking in the truth bam comes in 1965 on a subject called marriage and divorce and he says I'm going to try tomorrow if the Lord willing to speak on the subject there are two schools of thought see and may God help us to know what is truth just to know what's truth so we can walk in the truth and in the light now if we walk in the light that means we are walking in the light of the hour or the light of the age brother now I hope this is okay in first John he said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin in Shalom 64 he said to me I want to see what is Promised for the day I want to know what the lot of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the Ro am I praise God now listen friends we have already come through Luther's light and Luther walked in justification light Wesley walked in sanctification life amen Pentecost walked in the restoration of the gifts life but listen the prophet of God said we're walking in a higher light or a greater light we are walking in the light of the fullness of the revealing of the word he said now notice here he is okay he was the word made light or became light the word in that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets of old spoke of him and here he come and Vindicated he was the light of God's spoken word all the prophets had said had been fulfilled in him so the prophets back here come on Church the prophets back here was Zacharias and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Daniel and Malachi and brother they were speaking of the word the Messiah becoming flesh but here is Jesus the word made flesh and what they spoke back there is now fulfilled in his flesh come on now there was something behind him but now there's something in him what was behind him was now manifested in him and there was something more in front of him glory to God he did not say let's go back to Moses let's go back to Ezekiel you know what the Bible said the Bible said for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and to sit down at the right hand of the father at the Throne of majesty on high you say what was before him I'll tell you what was before him was the word made flesh in his bride there is no two lights there is no three lights there's only one light there's not Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian amen Christ is the light and he is the light is the life and the word manifested is the light of the hour can I say to you what a prophet spoke of you is now fulfilled in your flesh that's right can I tell you something he said something about you he said there would be a people who would live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with them can I say this I'm not looking for that I'm looking at that he said there would be an invincible Army I'm not looking for that I'm looking at that he said as the world gets more worly the church would get closer to God he said while the world is becoming worldly the church is becoming powerful I'm not looking for it I'm looking at it yes sir the word manifested is the light of the hour he said we are to be the children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word are you ready for this the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it all right come on the Bible said so again there is something wrong with your experience when you say that you love God and refuse his word no man he says can come to me except my father draws him see no man will never see it it's that predestinated seed and that only is going to receive it but we've come to that place again the Bible said you are the light of the world now let me just say what a prophet said if that's okay in this hour that we're living in I know it is I'm just I'm just preaching in this hour we're living in I know where I'm preaching in this hour we're living in now the a Vindicated word of this hour Pentecostals you say speaking in tongues and so forth that was the day of Pentecost that was the light of that hour then see this is another day he's the light of the hour today can I say what a prophet said he did not say it the gift is the light of the hour he said he which is the person which is not a gift but he's The Giver is the light of this hour don't get mad at me I'm not following a gift I'm not following A Gifted person thank I is this okay I believe in the gifts but the gifts have got to be judged right now let's just say what a prophet said he said the G it's amazing homeron gory one time homerline gory told me one time he said brother Andrew he said I find it amazing everybody in the church has a gift till you have a back room he said then all of a sudden there's no gifts he said everybody loses their gifts when you put them in order now come on church either we believe the message or we don't but a prophet said that demonology comes in the church through the gifts open on the floor now you know why that is don't you it's cuz somebody prophesies or sees something or interprets something and they want you to follow it and because it's under the anointing nobody wants to judge it well let me say this a Prophet is not judged if he's a word Prophet but anything outside of a Vindicated Prophet must be judg by the word come on church let your hair down and let's preach a second we used to judge Spirits by the word we used to try motives of men and objectives and directions we used to check it by the message but I tell you what happens is it changes who's doing it and then all of a sudden we change who's checking it let me say this this message is not a respector of persons I don't care if it's a big preacher a little preacher a housewife or a Sunday school teacher we've got to come back to what Joshua taught and stay in step with Joshua I remember I used to say preacher your way out your Lim am I really though I was in I was in a service one time amen one man stood up and spoke in tongues there were three different written interpretations of the one tongue now amen I hope this is okay three different interpretations of one tongue you know what they did Brother they hung the three interpretations up on the bulletin board and the Pastor said now whichever one comes to pass is the direction for the church one of them was about a storm one of them was about a great Victory and one of them was about a was about an issue in the church now I'm sorry I'm not very good at being political or being diplomatic so just don't stupid me you know because I didn't come from from Ahab I came from Elijah I went up to the pastor very respectfully and I said brother which one are we going to follow amen we got three different directions listen friends we don't need three different directions we for the first time have an absolute come on Church brother I tell you what I better hurry I tell you what happens is nine times out of 10 the devil will use a gift in somebody's life to get you into a spirit of confusion and fear and you'll begin to question whether I'm a Believer or not am I doing what God called me to or not but can I say this my identity as a Son of God as a Caleb of this generation is not relying Upon A Gifted person my identity has come from the word of God when I heard the word of God and recognized it was Eagle food I heard from my theophany listen I'm going to keep on walking with Joshua that's exactly right that's exactly right that brother Sean Martin told me one time he said I hope this okay brother Jack he said back when we was in Pentecost he said I needed a gift every day he said I needed my pastor to have a word over me I needed my pastor to see something but when I come to the message he said I finally found a place of stability now it's not a gift it's the giver yes we believe in the gift but the part of God said there's what the evidence of Holy Spirit is is believing the word of God when it's manifested he was the word manifested let me just say this to you when you receive that word into your soul and the word becomes your absolute on your good days you're a child of God and on your bad days you're a child of God when you're sick you're a child of God when you're broke you're a child of God there's nothing the devil can do to change your identity as a child of God see what I'm saying is the light of this hour is not a glare of another age brother said they're living in a glare of another light what is it it's a false light it's a reflection he said you have a mirage you know what that is it's a reflection of the sun on the hot desert and it reflects a false light and makes it look like water and when you get there there's no water there he said that's what a glare is and something that's promising and you never get to it oh my my goodness do you realize the greatest robbery that ever took place in the history of the world was done by a false light brother said a $7 million Scotland yards hold up he said they can't figure it out he said you know how they done it by a false light they put a light on the railroad track I love this word he uses caution on down till it come to a red light and stop them he said there the robbery taken place at the right place a false light gave the greatest robbery that Nations ever know it robbed the nations of the greatest hold up the greatest robbery it was done by a false light he said oh the false lights yes it could cost the church the greatest robbery had ever had cold denominational Creeds brother will not rap in a Vindicated word grain listen friends but the light has come brother said when the light comes he said God has declared in the skies he he's declared it in his word he's declared it on the paper he's declared it amongst the people can't you open your eyes and see the hour these are they that Testify the truth this is the light of the hour he said listen with a great watch the great ecumenical move it's going into the council up there now just forming an image of the beast in Revelation 17 exactly what it said it would do you Pentecostal people going to sit still for that and go into it the forcing hour has come my God now is the time to rise and trim your lamp and shine with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power another place God has a way of forcing the issue sometime now you all know the quote by heart National Force will put Israel in the Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches listen but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward my word is spirit and life listen she'll recognize her position in the word amen praise God then she's in Christ will put her in her place and no National Force will do it the power of God will raise the bride right into Glory exactly right let me let me tie this up here and say this arise Caleb arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee look at this word light you know what it means it is the light of prosperity it is the light of instruction all right brother said look in Joshua 1:7 that thou mayest Prosper Glory whether soever thou goest then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous then Thou shalt have good success Joshua remembered his commission let not the book of the law my word depart out of your mouth in other words Joshua I don't care what the tribe says what the clergy says you stay with this word can I can I leave this with you church I don't care what YouTube says I don't care what some preacher says I don't care what some reprobate says I don't care what some Theologian says you stay with this word for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous look what David said he said blessed is the man that walketh not I got two minutes in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seed of the scornful listen his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night listen whatsoever he doeth shall prosper he's planted like like a tree by the rivers of water bringeth forth fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and what soever he doeth shall prosper can I can I leave my notes for just a second in closing can I say something to you you can only Prosper as much as you can obey Joshua amen amen amen as much as you can obey the word is as much as you can prosper it's the light of instruction and the light of prosperity see brother said like this he said what is it he said Prosperity always runs people that's a hard thing to say but Prosperity takes a man away from God he said but listen that's what America's done is they have turned down their heads that's what the church has done he said but Lord in our great Prosperity he said Satan blowed his poisonous Breath Again the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as the Holy Spirit there's no such a thing as the new birth but Lord God he said walk in on your promises and show to your people that you still live and save them from the breath of Satan the Lord is with Joshua God Caleb stay and step amen with Joshua I was I'll leave this with you I was I was flying the other day from I was actually was over in Orlando we was there for a few days on vacation with my in-laws and I left early and flew up to Georgia to preach a watch Night Service and brother Jack you know how it is on New Year's you're always preparing and trying to find the mind of the Lord to end that old year and bring that new year in and I'm just flying on the airplane I'm reading through some some sermons of brother Brams and listening to a tape and I heard brother say these words he said now here's my New Year's message and I just Paul the tape and I said Lord I said you gave brother Braham a New Year's message and you know they say here's my New Year's message Shalom or we go in the light of his resurrection I said Lord I got one question tonight I'm going to deliver a New Year's message I said Lord what would my New Year's message be to this people I'm going to speak to and brother Jack as clear as I'm talking right now a voice spoke in my heart and said these words said go tell my people just keep walking am now now come on preachers cuz you know what I'm talking about you think well that's real simple you know I mean I mean that you go tell somebody just keep walking they're going to say well that's real simple and it's clear as day Spirit of the Lord because just you know how you argue with God sometimes I said Lord is that really is that really going to is that really going to edify somebody just to hear the words just keep walking and then I thought you know what I'm real dumb the Lord spoke that to my heart if he gave it to me it's for a reason I said Lord I'll go save it and you know what I did I looked in the message brother Jack and I got to reading and I typed those words in just keep walking and as I was reading that I said Lord I come across where he said footsteps means possession I come across where he said the land is yours go fight for every inch of it he said every place you can put your foot on I said Lord that's walking I said but there's got to be something about this just keep walking and about that time I heard brother say this he said now you're coming through here with cancer he said but the Lord heals you he said God has already healed you he said now just keep walking right exactly right he said now just keep walking and as he said that I read another one you know what he said Brother Gary he said you got a kidney trouble he said but the Lord heals you amen just keep walking and these words just grab me I about had to shout all over that Delta plane these words grab me it's the only way you can get well is just keep walking I said my Lord let me listen that again he said it's the only way you can get well is you just got to keep walking let me can I can I leave you with my New Year's message spirit and Truth Tabernacle just keep walking just keep walking you say brother Ed I'm in a hard way right now just keep walking it's the only way you can get well it's the only way things are going to change if you sit down ain't nothing going to change but if

success just keep walking Glory Hallelujah God don't promise a fire bed of EAS don't don't you falsify a Christian and don't you falsify the message by telling them everything's going to be all right there's nothing going to harm him there's no trouble coming that's wrong he said God promises Grace to endure every trial it's the grace we look at God somebody say this with me just keep walking keep walk if I just keep walking the conditions are going to change if I just keep walking the conditions are going to change if I got any Witnesses here tonight that says that's the truth if I just keep walking after a while the conditions are going to change brother Andrew I'm in a trial keep walking brother Andrew I feel like this is the hardest trial of my life just keep walking yes sir yes sir we prove it to you by the scripture Daniel chapter 3 you know what the Bible says in the in the in the hottest trial of the three Hebrew Children's Life me prove it to you the prophet of God said it like this he said they stood before the king he pronounced judgment they heated the fire seven times hotter you know what he said brother Gary he said they walked to the fiery furnace brother they didn't push him to the fiery furnace they walked to the fiery furnace you know what they opened the door brother Jack and they didn't push them in there they walked into right right right they walked to the greatest trial of their faith they walked into the fiery furnace that was heated seven times hotter and here's the amazing thing when they got in there they didn't sit down and have a pitiful poor me party and wowy wowy woo my Bible says they were bound hand and foot but they still found some way to walk around all right to walk around in their trial they walked to the fiery furnace they walked into the fiery furnace they walked around in the fiery furnace the Fourth Man appeared and loosed them from their shackles listen if I tell you this will you believe me just keep walking cuz if you walked to it you walked into it you walked around it here's the greatest thing about it they walked out of it Hallelujah their conditions changed because they kept on walking they possessed their Victory by their footsteps listen friends tonight our lord Jesus is the antitype of the son of prosperity he has risen from the dead and is alive here Among Us and as Divine evidence someday we're going out of this world of trouble and sin we're Satan and all of his power is at and we will be free from him forever pise God just keep walking you love him tonight how many say I'm going to put on my walking shoes I'm going to put on my walking shoes it's time to walk almighty God we bow our hearts in your presence tonight Lord we thank you for the anointing that's in this building Lord we thank you for the liberty of your word and the presence of your spirit here father I realize that this word is more than just the ideas of a man but Lord It's the Divine instructions Lord It's Joshua coming to this generation this Caleb Lord now father we're not looking for another Joshua we're not looking for another leader we have received our Joshua our promised land is in sight yes Lord we've come to the first and second pool we've crossed the Jordan into the third pool where all the promises of God are laying now Lord I know there's many Giants in this land lord this land is full of giants but before the land was full of giants you had a Joshua in mind to put the full leadership into Joshua's hands and Lord you picked out a Caleb that would follow Joshua into the promised land father I rebuke every voice that would try to pull one of these calebs out of the light of this hour father I rebuke every influence of the enemy that will try to get them to sit down and quit walking and start questioning their weapon start questioning their position start questioning who they are in the economy of god father I rebuke that devil in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ father I speak your word light has come now Lord if they can surrender to this word if they can get underneath the headship of Joshua if they can obey the instructions of this word they can succeed and prosper in this land lord we believe your word is true we believe you're the god that is with us in even this hour Lord I pray a special blessing for our brother Jack and his family Lord I playay I pray a special blessing for this assembly oh God lord all the years of faithfulness oh God lord all the years they've held the vision of this message in this community Lord through the hard times through the struggles Lord they stood true to your word Lord I'm asking you dear God may you come down in battle as you did for Joshua Lord may you go before him oh God lord you have the perfect place picked out Lord you have all things in your economy Lord we surrender to you father I pray where the devil will try to stand before them Lord may they pick the sword of the word it's plenty sharp enough oh God and may they drive the sword in the face of the enemy and say we will not sit down we will not give up though the doors may be shut in our face we'll praise God in the hallway till the next door opens because we are Caleb and we are well able to possess our inheritance bless every member of this assembly oh God bless every home Lord bless every young person Lord may they move into every promise that you've made Lord may you expand their borders may you expand their territory Lord may they put on their walking shoes and may they start putting footsteps may they start putting footsteps on the

your time brother Jack we we thank you for allowing us to common Amen to speak to the Believers here once again we love you with all our heart we love you the love of the Lord amen keep pressing the battle amen the best days are not behind you Caleb stay with Joshua God bless you brother Jack would you come amen amen God bless you my my my my my turn around and tell your neighbor just keep walking walk amen just keep walking my God my my my my my amen amen praise God praise God can be seated just for a little bit we certainly appreciate um brother Andrew Amen on tonight and and um he just kind of had me going back down U Memory Lane when we when I first came in contact with him um I believe was there in uh North Carolina and we were ministering some meetings together and um you know at that time I think he was 18 you know 16 16 wow uh and uh you know preaching and you know and just thinking about you know just uh his sermon tonight and just how he had to make different stands on the word of God to stay with what Joshua said and uh as he was reading that quote from the church age book um it was the angel Lord that told uh brother Brandon to pick up his pen and write and said let us stand like Joshua and Caleb and uh so the angel identified it wasn't even brother brandom identifying but it was the angel that identified who Joshua was and the angel identified who Caleb was right and uh so the angel told us that it's it's Caleb that stays with Joshua Joshua would come as an end time leader uh which would be the ministry of brother Brandon and you know so he just you know just I know as there's a a big thing uh that hit a lot of the young ministers uh but brother Andrew kept walking amen and and and I'm I'm very very very happy you know just to see how the Lord has just um uh brought him through all of that and you know just also just still using him the scripture I wanted to just share uh cuz he walk the title was walking in the light of prosperity and success and and uh we we we receive that as we uh follow this message that God gave us and there's a scripture that I just want to uh just um share 2 chonicles 20 and 20 amen um really really quick 2 chronic 2 Chronicles 20 and 20 amen it says this um and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established but we're going Beyond just being established we're talking about prosperity and success and the the rest of the scripture says believe His prophets and so shall ye Prosper so uh you know I I know that as we are just following this word we'll see amen the benefits that come from following a prophet we've already experienced those benefits and there's so much more that God has uh in store for us I I just thank God for the word and and I thank thank God for his examples amen that the Lord just Ed them to just kind of share I mean uh that that that that that example of the a prophecy go forth in the church and three different interpretations of one prophecy that lets us know that something is not in alignment with the word of God now God gives the gifts to the church God uses God that was a part of the whole restoration but it's got to be done in order if it's not done in order it just creates chaos in the body and and and when it creates chaos that's when you get people not wanting it around in the church because um I hate to say it but sometimes gifted people not able to subject themselves to the word and if you can't subject a gift to the word then there's a problem the word is the highest thing that we have in the church um you know brother random actually said that the the closest place uh uh on Earth to Heaven the closest place on on Earth to Heaven is what happens here behind the pulpit what is spoke to you behind the pulpit so it's very important that we keep the word at at in in the highest place it's supposed to be and that's above every gift and uh and if a person with a gift can't say Amen to that then there is a problem praise the lord we say Amen to this word we thank God for it we appreciate brother Andrew let's say praise the Lord for our brother hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm going just keep walking I'm going walk right into my blessing amen I I like I like the way he said that cuz as you keep and that's just like a a Florida ring any of y'all know anything about a Florida ring especially during not this time of year CU this is this is unprecedented uh but but but during the summer when you get a Florida rain um it could be dropping hard on this side but if you just keep on driving and you get to the other side Dres I don't know what but you you but you just can't stop where it's rainy you got to keep pressing through right so amen we we thank God for the rainy weather we thank him for the dry weather but but we going to keep walking till we walk right into our blessing amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm I'm encouraged tonight I'm strengthened by the word of God strengthened by the word of God anden let me have tonight's um uh

Moses and God to be able to see things like that according to scripture not that we exalt a man but Lord we realize what you are doing in these men and Paul made a statement he said follow me as I follow Christ and father that's exactly what we're doing in this hour following this word because we know you are the one behind the word you said my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they would not follow so we hear your voice God we see your manifestations and we got compl complete confidence in this message that has brought us this far will certainly take us on on into a Rapture Lord is
