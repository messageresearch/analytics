[Music] time here towards a goal and I'm gonna just tell you I'm grateful for what I see the Lord I'll do one that I made so I'm very great great-great grateful because there was a time that I wouldn't be able to come up here to give reports like this but every month is positive amen if you just give a dollar that's positive we're not going back we going forward right now so I but we thank God for everyone that's been contributing and they met through what they can to help us do walk to on our own building and for the Lincoln coming here and he was just he was preach about the building

year-to-date towards that goal is twenty one thousand five hundred sixty nine dollars and 63 cents let's give God praise back this year year-to-date what's been received amen and pledges is twenty one thousand five hundred $69 we've also put the money in an account where it can gain some interest and thus far what we've received an interest is four hundred thirty-five dollars and forty cents causing our net to be twenty two thousand five dollars and three stand for this year praise gone man so church we thank God for where we are and amen we gonna keep pressing forward one of the things when you look at numbers like that all I see is positive all I see is positive like I said cuz there was a time we just didn't have and that right so I see positive another thing I feel that as we

prayer prayer prayer multiply it right we thank God for the interest but then got nothing on what my god can do you ain't even see injuries hallelujah but you know but we under we on the expectation for God to do something incredible amen amen something incredible we got our eyes on a building that they just can't get sold it just can't get so we're gonna keep doing what we're doing and we know that you'll do what you gonna do so it may y'all just keep it keep keep it in prayer but I I just I just believe it's GOG on something incredible Amen God and and I'm just just coming I feel this way my god let me see the building like that and I'm like Lord this is nice and if God does not allow me Laos to have that then I'm expecting something nicer that's just what my faith in God if you say no to that then I'm expecting something greater than that praise God Church so it may let's stay encouraged let's stay faithful a man and God will do what what only God can't do a man let's just prepare to welcome brother Leighton my brother Layton just to give you all up - he's from the Jefferson Jefferson Villa Indiana brother Ling was here in West Palm Beach Florida 18 years ago and brother Layton dropped dead they met in the service at brother West Coast Church he was gone for seven minutes God raised him up 18 years ago and he's back in West Palm Beach preaching the gospel amen the same place he died we read of Lazarus and things like that we got a modern-day Lazarus right here a man in our very in front of us he was telling me a metal yesterday he was telling us testimony to young lady she was in the medical field and as she was uh she just just feared out why he talking staring and she like she's expecting something to be wrong with his mind because he was gone for seven seven nine seven minutes and she said you you must be alright I was staring at your eyes and everything seemed fine eyes she said she said God did this God is the one that did this you know when God do things into it perfect man but you know versus you say yeah I mean I'm looking at you see everything the fines and yeah cause I don't leave no no no no you don't leave nothing short so we're happy to have him a man here just Minister the gospel to us on this morning and we just want him to have its way one of just take it take its time a man just having a woman lead him to speak to our hearts in and feed his wife have a song and so you don't know if they'll share that but also IMAX brother Layton just you know he has him and his wife I've had the experience of being you know in the prophets meetings as well as just a number of the things that we hear on tape of different that you might hear brother ran a call-out they knew these people personally you know some of them still living so much but they're able to just share testimonies witness and I told him we don't have anybody here it's a graffiti note to a talk like that I say so please take your time and maybe just share a few things with us three men on today's so want to just invite him to come a man at this time let's stand to our feet a man let's just receive what the Lord has [Music] may see grace sweet sound [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] see [Music] [Music] [Music] let's be seated Thank You magicians you don't understand up there we go maybe we should have kept the musicians thank you brother Duff for that introduction I'm not worthy of that but God is certainly good to us and we've enjoyed our time we went we came from Jeffersonville and traveled to Byron Georgia for a wedding our nephew got was married to a young sister from Byron so brother Yancy asked me to speak there and I'd already called brother Jack before that but no was that far we'd like to come on down well I told him we'd be down last Monday and so we'll be leaving on the seventh but he got it Kenny Wampus so he had us coming in on the seventh instead of leaving on the seventh so but you know the Lord works things out his way and it was nice seeing brother Westco and his folks over Wednesday night I agree we had a wonderful time here and then went to brother jeans Thursday and oh my tow brother Jack because I preached three times on this trip and I'm so wore out the Lord is really the people have really pulled and to be honest it was the same sermon in all three all three churches I've just had it on my heart the importance of prayer I appreciate it brother Morris Bryant's in Sellersburg our priesthood at our church in our home church Sarat brothers Nathan's and priests you to brother Yancy's and preached it here and preached it over brother Jean so preached that same sermon five times but it's not the same sermon same scriptures same quotes but God leads you the different thoughts for different groups because he knows what each one needs but we've had quite a time and it's really maybe because I've gotten older but it really has the spirit being in the spirit like that has really drained me so I told brother Jack I'm not gonna preach real hard I don't I don't think that's after that importance of prayer it was some of it was kind of a hard my called a hard sermon you know kind of get on to the people and I don't I well anyway the Lord knows what he's doing so again trust it whatever was said was was great but Brenda and I went over some things yesterday and you know even for us you don't stop and think about different things that you've seen and heard really until you get to talking about it or somebody else does and all of a sudden that comes to your mind oh I remember this now remember they remember it's buried back there somewhere it's like the computer they say when you delete something it's not really deleted it's there you just you just have to have be a technician or whatever to know how to get into that computer in and dig those things out so it's kind of the way we are with with our minds sometimes it's there but the Lord has to bring it to the thought but sister Layton and I have we were about jump ahead of one of these we were we were married in February of 64 and we spent our honeymoon at brother branham's meetings down in Bakersfield which is where the area where I was from and I was from a little town outside of Bakersfield little town and one even of town but as a little spot in the road called weed patch and it was a weed patch so but we had that's where we raised it's a bunch of our keys and a bunch of Oh keys and you know came from there from into California to work and that's where my folks were most of them are from Oklahoma Brenda's family they were from Oklahoma and and in Arkansas so all just a bunch of country folks that God has brought along and we're really blessed so we spent our our honeymoon in the meetings in my it was really really wonderful to see brother be able to see brother Branham that was Bakersfield then we went to the Visalia meetings after that but I went to Vietnam and Brenda attended more meetings than I did came home when we were able to sit under the hey brother Douglas McHugh's his church we set and listened to brother Brandon by way of the telephone hookup and back then the long-distance telephone call cost a dollar a minute that was a lot of money back in 64 65 and you know so we really didn't they didn't start the listing on the phone until just a few a few minutes before brother random maybe like the last song they would would kick it in and then sometimes they didn't even have all the prayer line on there because it was getting expensive so they'd cut it off but nonetheless we heard the message but we got to talking about things yesterday and brother Duff asked if we would share a few things I'd like to start with with one Brenda's dad brother Mayfield brother Lawrence Mayfield gave his heart to the Lord in 1947 in Arkansas in brother Browns meetings and he went up repented went up went through the prayer line at that time he was still smoking but he went outside took his cigarettes out of his shirt pocket threw him under the car never picked him up again but only did he do that he went back into the meeting and I believe this is before the days that they had prayer cards but he was able to get back in the prayer line and go through it a second time and wooden brother branham got to him for some reason he stopped and he looked at me says what can I do for you brother and he says what brother branham he said I just wanted to come and thank you for what you've done for me and I'd like for you to pray for me that I would go all the way and brother Ram turned to the congregation and he says wasn't there ten lepers that were cleansed and yet only one returned to give thanks [Applause] that's not on tape Fitz brother Mayfield's testimony but then brother Brandon prayed for him and he went all the way he died in 90 years old still believe in the Word of God still follow the teachings of the prophet of God for our date then his time went along in 1959 in San Jose while brother Brandon was there they went to the meetings because they were from the San Jose area so they went there and brother Roy borders who was brother branham's campaign manager at that time attended brother McHugh's his church along with sister Helen borders his wife and brother borders was able to get since that's where that Mayfield's went further borders was able to get brother Branham to the back of the building where brother Branham came out at and he was able to speak to him for a couple of minutes or so and while I don't know what they talked about even brother Lawrence didn't remember but the one thing that he did remember was while they were standing there talking brother Branham you know he was standing beside him he said step a little closer brother so reached already put his arm around brother Mayfield and he said I was nervous and he said I looked over brother Branham and he said you know brother Branham I gave my heart to the Lord in your meetings and 19 everybody said he just said 46 brother Branham looked at him and said no brother it was 47 my point being to give you a deeper thought into that if you can go from 47 to 59 that's 12 years and then try to imagine how many people were in the meetings in those 12 years the times we need to have 10 20 30 40 thousand people in meetings how many of those people went through in 12 years how many people went through the prayer life right so how would that man know it was 47 instead of 46 because he was preaching in 46 if I remember I brother Mayfield didn't tell him it was Arkansas he just said I gave my heart to the Lord in your meetings of 46 and brother Branham said no brother was 47 well we know who did that it wouldn't be man it was the God everything he brought it to him so then many of you may or may not have heard there was a story and brother Billy has told it far and wide of a man that took the church age book to work and gave it to his Foreman and the man read it I don't know if he read it all but he read enough of it he brought it back and he gave it to the man and he said here's your book back he said I don't want that book anymore and he asked him said well why not he said because that man in that book called me a vulture the man looked at him he said well that's strange he said that man in that book called me an eagle yeah well that man was Brenda's daddy brother Mayfield so just goes to show you we never know let's see in night April of 1965 sister Layton and her family I was over in Vietnam they went down to Los Angeles and tended the meetings down there and my son received march/april yeah my son was about a month old my oldest son and he was having troubles having normal bowel movements and brenda was having some problems from the birth they wouldn't think she got a prayer line and went through the line a brother branham didn't tell her her name or they'd say he was just like a fast line so he prayed for and they were both healed so now we've had some relatives that we know I'll reaches some quotes on these on in 1957 on a message entitled God in His Word in Oakland California brother Ram says this here's a lady said this will settle it for the whole group of you now that should have done it right there this will settle it for the whole group of you if you can believe lady if we're strangers to each other and God knows both of us do you believe the Lord can help me to know what your trouble what's your trouble and would you believe it said you're suffering with a nervous condition I just watched something take place you had an operation that's right and it was a throat a throat Gorder now maybe some of the younger ones don't know what a goiter is but it's kind of like a tumor or cancer it's a big ol thing it'll hang it's just a big big knot that hangs off under the skin of your throat or wherever would be so you have a throat border and it never had an operation and it never did do right he said that's right you live in a rural district don't you you want me to tell you what your number is you live on Route one don't you and your box is 480 that's right your name is Lily Qualls is that right so return home and be made well in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you believe now literally qualls his sister Layton's cousin she's still alive she still lives in Tucson in fact we just talked to her daughter yesterday because we had to clarify who another another person was the next one I'm gonna read we couldn't remember which Phillips it was we'll even talk to her our uncle in Jeffersonville and he thought it was no he did say was Harrison's but nonetheless let me read this one on 1964 God's provided way in Bakersfield which is a meeting one of the meetings we were in so I know there's no need of me asking you how many ever seen that light let's see you've seen the picture of it let's see your hands that's ever seen the picture of it don't you see it right there see it's another dimension it's over that lady and she's suffering with trouble in her legs and back do you believe that God can heal you sister what did you touch you don't know me but you touched something if the Lord Jesus will tell me who you are will you make excuse me if the Lord Jesus will tell me who you are will that make you believe better you're mrs. Philips that's right stand to your feet all right I'm a total stranger you raise your hand if that's right I've never seen her in my life what did she touch go talk to the woman afterward pains are all gone now you're all right you can go home and be well that woman was named hazel Phillips and it was burned his aunt on another one on 1957 and God in His Word same place brother Branham says this we are strangers to each other are we lady you have on glasses that's one of the things that you want to be prayed for is your eyes that's right then you're real nervous and here's something I see up here's something I see show up it's something in your mouth it's a sore in your mouth and you want prayed for that's right that's a hidden thing people would say well sure she had on glasses you believe me to be his prophet mrs. Phillips would if you would believe with all of your heart you could be healed do you believe that jessimae Phillips I mean that's right all right return to your home now be made well the name of Jesus Christ jessimae Phillips that's Brenda's aunt she is alive today and lives in Jeffersonville I just talked to her husband oyel yesterday - trying to make sure some of these the one I've read before that mrs. Phillips who it was he thought it was her husband named his Brenda's uncle Harrison so hazel Phillips's was that one all right the next one excuse me 1965 I have heard but now I see and I have forgot to look where that one was but anyway there's a lady sitting right back there looking at me now with the goiter another one a goiter in her throat ladies sitting next by sitting next to her that she'll understand the lady there has high blood pressure also that's right the leading cities the ladies sitting next to her she has a trouble too and she's not here she's from Arkansas is that they're missing it he said mrs. Phillips believed on the Lord Jesus Christ to be healed do you believe in with all your heart and accept it right now then you can have it that mrs. Phillips was Brenda's grandmother and yes she was healed another one back in 1957 here you him in Oakland now I'm just - must speak with the man as our Lord did with the apostle's when they he met them and with the woman said it seemingly that he is going from me the audience still pick up my voice and I see that the man is disturbed about something he's extremely nervous but his nervousness is a worry that he's having and that is because oh he's shadowed and it's a cancer that's right it's a cancer and that cancers on your left shoulders you believe me to be his prophet then you're in the presence not of your brother but you're in the presence of him mr. Phillips do you believe that mr. Ali Phillips that's right that's your name that's right believe it now then come let us pray Holly Phillips that's why all his brothers and sisters called him now how would he know that his name was olive after the olive tree Olive Philips burner was one of the few the calling of olive the rest of them call him Ali but brother Adam called him Ali and Brenda remembers the the cancer on his shoulder and he was in brother Ali brother Phillips was healed 1964 when their eyes were opened they knew him now this one's I wasn't there but I know the woman because this woman he's gone speaker was my pastor before I came into the message little Church I was raised in her grandfather actually started the the the church and we patched the first Jesus name Church of wheat patch and then when he passed away Rita and Darryl Doss and his granddaughter and her husband they took it over native who kind of first time ever heard of it like that way but they were co-pastors but she was a minister and boy could that woman preach the dead were raised eyes were open dummy miracles done and she could preach I mean she could preach and God did use allow it and use it and worked miracles as brother Branham said it was his permissive will and not his perfect will but she went through the prayer line and brother mem says this lady or the lady is suffering with trouble with her eyes that was pretty obvious because she was pretty much cross sighted and she wore glasses so like he said about em Jesse you know the heel you can see he's got glasses on okay she has trouble with her eyes but she not only wore glasses she had trouble with her eyes she had trouble with her eyes and bits bothering her and she's got back trouble that's bothering her and she's nervous extremely nervous right isn't that right if that's right and raise your hand say another thing you're you're a minister of some sort but you're you're like you're a woman preacher that's what it is now believe with all your heart and go and you can have what you asked for that woman's name was Rita Dawson co-pastor of the first Jesus name Church and wheat patch California which was my pastor before because I was in the service at that time and we just come into the message was down there for the meetings and anyway we spent our time read and I spent our time at their house and attended the meetings and they went to him also I said I wasn't there I was too there I'm sorry it was done that was February of when we were there all right some things have been told because I've been blessed to leave Tucson after I'm sorry to leave California after I got home from the service and I always thought it was not always but here recently I've come to realize something I come home from Vietnam the last time and I got it we got into San Francisco on September the 1st Brenda and I left San Fran left California on September the second and we got into Tucson on September the 3rd I left home Jeffersonville on September the first he came to West Palm I died and was resurrected on September the 2nd on September the 3rd I went back home to Jefferson I'm not trying to make any spiritual out of that I just thought it was the date this struck me just what since we've been on this trip wasn't brunettes talking to somebody and I went oh you know 18 years of 500 somebody turn on light just does it mean anything spiritual no I'm not saying that I'm just saying it just struck me you make out of it what you want I just think it's kind of neat let me see in speaking and living in Tucson I was we were blessed to to get to know a lot of the the brothers that brother Graham speaks up you know brother Collins of course pastor of the tabernacle but he was wasn't a pastor when when we were Tucson but we got to know him brother Hickerson which brother branham talks about he called him hick we all did and brother Roy Roberson brother Roy borders oh my brother brother Soph Minh brother Fred Saltzman brother Welch Evans and sister Evans trying to pull these names up I should roll him down brother wheeler brother Carl third of what Brenda Brenda Carl Carl Williams right Full Gospel businessman brother Carl yes brother I'm talks about Sidney Jackson we had him in our home several times and just treated his wife Sarah and precious people a brother blood going blank up here Blair brother Blair brother man speaks in him the one where the little boy was electrocuted brother brother Blair prayed for him and he was resurrected brother Richard Blair his wife is still alive she lives in Tucson I mean in Jeffersonville so we were you know that and many others we were brother brother sister man we were blessed brother green brother Douglas McHugh's brother man speaks as what was our pastor in California and then then in Tucson have removed there for a while we went to brother greens and we built a church and those of us that came from California went there and no no disrespect to brother green we just went because those are pastor but we did enjoy our time with brother green he was quite quite an amazing man which I had the memory he did but anyway my point was I've heard a lot of different stories about brother Branham and I I wish I could I wish we had cell phones so you could have recorded them back in those days but and we didn't write them down and things but certain ones stick with you one of my think that that impressed me from everybody was the fact that brother Branham was the most humble man they'd ever met I'm both loved everybody and it was true they all said you couldn't tell us his enemies from his friends if we only we could all do do that but one thing they saw about Hummel now we all know brother Branham talks about how he could walk and he community walk miles and miles and miles on the power lines and stuff as and in the Conservancy and so forth and he could out walk anybody in the hunting or the fishing party and but brother Branham was always whenever climbing mountains and going camping or getting up going up to there's a place he was always the last one up the mountain and when they came back down he was always the last one down the mountain and he did that because he said he told him he wanted to make sure that everybody got up and back down safely nobody left behind nobody hurt so even though he could out walk him he let everybody beat him one of the other things that I thought was neat brother Green was telling me about that that brother branham when they would play darts he and brother branham he said brother Adam never did win since brother green said he always he always lost but then he said we got to noticing that when brother Brandon would be over there be over by himself and just throw it at the dartboard himself he hit a bull's eye every time so he said Billy's that purpose in my heart cuz he told me this I purposed in my heart that I'm gonna make brother Branham win he's what you know what he's had to get up here and I throw it - he'd throw one he said I could even make him win city wasn't competitive so you know like with a gun I mean now that he did that for his Spurs hunting and stuff he was a probably one of the best shots you ever heard of but yet he wasn't boastful were you know he didn't use it to make himself some big fellow so that's fine but I got one the last one I'll tell which is I told it to the pastor and we all I laugh every time I tell it it's a story of the of the onion sandwich the wild turtle and David wood as it banks Woods son and brother David is still alive he's in Jeffersonville they was on a hunting trip and sitting around a fire you know of a morning getting ready to go hunting and so forth and when they got ready to leave brother Brennan stood up put on his coat and David and Ronnie Evans and Ronnie and I were real close brother well Kevin's son we were real close friends and he told me this story because he was there with it with him and said that David hollered out at brother branham's and oh brother branham he said I fixed you a sandwich and I put it in your coat pocket so brother him said okay David said thank you and off he went hunting well is the day went long brother Adam decided it was time to eat he sat down under a tree somewhere and he pulls out that sandwich and lo and behold he's got a great big thick slice of onion and two pieces of bread the onion sandwich and he ate it he liked onions but that's still I don't apparently I would what he was expecting but thank God they got back to the camp and brother Ram didn't say anything the day progressed the evening and all the brothers they all sat around the farm they would talk and they would talk and have a good time to jump over to one thing first but before it goes here they always said it that when they were doing that they didn't when brother Brad would reach over and pick up his Bible and stand up and walk around to the other side of the fire everything changed everybody got quiet and then he would spend the next half hour hour to whatever he wanted to do and just talk to the brothers well this at that time this night he hadn't done that but they were sit around just having a good time a bunch of brothers together and the boys got tired I think they were 17 something like that 16 17 right in there in 18 but Ronnie and Ronnie Evans and David wood decided they were gonna go to bed so they went to the 10 they told her buddy goodnight and as they got to the tent well excuse me before that time earlier in the evening I forgot one part brother Brown looked over after a while and he told David he said David I'm gonna get even with you for that onion sandwich David just left yeah sure brother Ram ha ha yeah yeah yeah yeah you know how young guys are oh yeah sure you are so the evening went on nothing else was said they have is just having their fellowship the voice said good night they went to bed and they just kept talking so them didn't say anything and they skipped oh I don't know how long it was but the boys were asleep so brother Brandon gets up he goes over to where he had hidden this wild turtle whatever they call him tortoise turtle whatever it is and he picks it up he goes in the Tim and David was late David was laying there and had his shirt off and he's laying there and he was sound asleep so brother Ram takes his turtle and drops it on his chest grabs that sleeping bag and pulls it up over his head zips him up in there and he walks out goes back sits down by the placard a few minutes later David finally gets out of that sleeping bag and he comes out his chest is all scratched up and he's kind of bleeding not real bad but you know you it's kind of thin in there and your chest will bleed pretty easy and brother I'm just stood over there just he hauled he said I told you I'd get even with you black or that onion sandwich people say wait you say this man is a prophet and he'd done that yeah he was a man listen this is what I appreciate about meeting all of these men and I heard these dogs a lot of stories which I can remember at this time about brother Branham I found out that he was a man 100% man just like you and I yeah the same feelings he you know he was happy and he was sad he was on the mountaintop and he was on the you know he went through all kinds of things just like we do he lied to was a man of life black passions are lying and so forth so listen it was a man yeah but he was he was in the office of a prophet but that man loved to tell jokes he liked to pull pranks he liked laughing he was it he was a husband he was a father he was a brother he was a friend he was a minister he was a prophet but he was all of those offices but he was a man but in the office of the prophet of God sent to this age so the Prophet did I think any less of him because of this thing about the terms of why he shouldn't have done that I don't know I might have done worse than that I don't know but I'm just saying I thought it was funny yeah hey they didn't pull any more pranks on brother Adam I tell you what yeah it was funny and it didn't injure him in that sense it just scratched him up yeah yeah I'm sure we've some husband scratched worse than that and that you know he scratched him up and he bled a bit and brother Ram then everybody thought it was funny brother grant thought it was funny so yeah it was it was good so my point was that he was a man because I've been around long enough to see a lot of people are most people I should say they've never had these opportunities that Brendan I did they that they get the opportunity I mean the idea in their head of the bullpen and a man standing in the pulpit expounding on the Word of God revealing the Word of God as a prophet of God and they've got a one-dimensional view that's God's prophet and that's all they can see but if they will listen he would say funny things in his servant ya know he would tell funny things that happen but most of them they ignore all of that and they're so concentrated on on the offices that he was in that they forget that he was a man yeah I mean it was a man that said it tell him I'm not here because he got so stressed out he doesn't he couldn't handle it it'd be so busy but he had to go make that right that showed that the Holy Ghost it was ending what he made it right when he couldn't even pray for the baby because that was hanging over him and he had to go make it right I was concerned about the man having less respected he's I have even more respect for you because you would come and make it right and then God answered his prayer yeah but I'm just so he was a prophet but he was also a human being and he also filled all of these other offices I know my great grandson told me one time he says you're different when you're church that's what yeah I'm different because I'm a deacon and I'm a minister but I'm stand at the door or or or upon the platform as a deacon I'm the policeman of the church when I'm in that office I got to be in that office right when I'm behind the pulpit preaching I stepped from a deacon I'm not a deacon now I'm a minister I'm out on the field I'm an evangelist and I go overseas I'm a missionary if I'm teaching a class I'm in the office of a teacher yeah I said but when I'm home I'm grandpa all right and I'm a husband and I'm dad but at the same time you want to talk about the Bible I shift gears and I go back into being a preacher or a teacher I said yes I am different active because I have to act or going to the office do you think a policeman can be a policeman 24 hours a day he's hired 24 hours a day but when he comes home mama don't want to hear this stuff about hey lady you're doing this and hey lady you're doing they stop doing it hey you're my sweetheart you're my husband you're my lover you're my friend let's be that way you're gonna stuff up over there are wrongs now if some of a burglar comes in you get that if you stay under that always of a policeman see but when you hear your daddy and your house night sorry you've got a fulfill that office we've got to go from one and sometimes it sometimes it's hard to shift from from one to the other but if you do what you have to do all right trust that you like those few things that we had to say a few things we've seen and don't don't do as it's been said I served this with the pastor don't take it as as it's been said boy which one do I preach on Jack anyway don't uh don't take it as it's been said before overladen really thinks he's something but he get no I didn't say all that to think of somebody I just said it the pastor asked me to share some of these things and Brendan I talked about him and we looked ahead to go find some of these quotes because I knew where they were but I didn't you know you don't just carry him now I got him I guess so I'll have him the point is I said because I'm your brother and I just want to share some of the things not because I'm anybody because I am your brother don't make me anything except blessed God bless me by being able to meet these men and talk to them and be friends with them and know them and here are a few things and there's people probably out there like 80 bits Kohi knows a whole lot more and I did dude Jer hear the one about brother branham driving through the mountains without his hands on the steering wheel say so I mean paddy bisko's seen a whole lot more and I have Billy Paul seen more than any of us so he you know I'd love to hear his stories over and over and over and over they never get old but brother Eddie tells the one about brother Branham they were driving through the mountains in Canada brother Ram started pray and he said next thing you know he said brother branham's this way and they'd he said I looked over he said I dared him to say a word he said just sat there didn't even move and that car is just going around the curves the mountain brother rambling say for about 15 minutes driving up through there brother Hammond had his eyes closed praying and his hands up and then also when his done he took the wheel start never said a word just like you know I was going I don't really know be honest I don't know why kill a man that was before Tesla I just thought of that one time I put a man in space and we've had a man in space for 2,000 years although it's not a 10 liter by Tesla man we had a Tesla drew by the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] all right you raise the Lord all right friends I trust that'll encourage you I'm not gonna preach a hard sermon this morning I've already did that Wednesday night and I'm told brother Jack Anderson Mentos those three sermons that same sermon three times with the Spirit of the Lord falling on me like it it's just it's taken a lot out of me oh I could preach it again but you know what I think I just kind of like to cruise through this morning if the Lord let me I think I'm gonna preach on because been singing these songs about our great God or he's if what was the first song you lit waymaker yeah yeah waymaker never changes never know you know just wait maker the several songs that kept they both sermons were live up I had one two of them here Berta said well I got one entitled God super mall Berta said well I didn't get to go shopping so maybe you ought to preach that one I've seriously thought about it then the other one is time and space our Great God or how great our is our God however you want to call it and you just keep going back to that one how great is and he said though some of the songs that were saying this morning I thought you know Lord if that's it then we'll start with that one if you don't like that one can stop me I'll go to the other one you know I had that happen up at brother Leopards right I was preaching up there spent a long time ago I was preaching up there for brother Palmer lipfird in Middletown Ohio and I was just preach in and just I just wouldn't get anywhere it all sudden I just stopped and I said you know what folks this isn't gonna work so I just pulled out my notes one another for another sermon and started with that one that's what the Lord wanted I'd say one time I've ever had that happen to me but I do I try to to follow him and I know you've had much better preachers and I in here so just bear with me if you'd stand we'll try to get right into this it's already what five after 12 already oh my I better hurry brother Jeffrey let's see what time service tonight Oh so I preached to force everything right no I'm just kidding with you let's approach the master before we do this Heavenly Father as we come now and try to settle down and break the bread of life to your children we spoken of brother Branham and the things that that he has happened and some of the things that we have seen and the things we know that as we talk to people before so it wasn't the man that did those things it was you you using the man and in him tore through him that you did him it wasn't Moses that brought water from the rock it wasn't Moses that opened the Red Sea it was you it wasn't Moses it brought flies and fleas and turned the waters of blood or split the city in darkness and and all these things the miracles that were done Moses did him yes Lord but it wasn't the man Moses it was you man they did it and father that's the way it was with his was excuse me Lord that's the way it was was brother branham when he walked the face of the earth it wasn't the physical man that did it it was you living in the man no more than if the any one of us here was to pray for someone and they would be healed we didn't heal him you did it but you used man to do these things now father we come this morning after telling some things that we've seen and heard and people that we know that was healed and some of the services to raise you up before the people because it was you may you get the glory from those stories and father's we come with this little sermon is a lesson you take control I've already committed myself and and whatever you wanted me to say unto you unto you the Lord helped me to move out of the way and you just take it and you get the glory for it and I thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen I want to read Genesis 1 and then I want to read Hebrews 1 Genesis 1 the first five verses and then what I did here with my Hebrews but I've got Hebrews 1 1 through 10 but I've only got the second verse I think I made a mistake and just what is to the second alright in the beginning God created the heaven and earth okay Wow I see brother Jack you know we all make mistakes and an amazing Hebrews 1:1 all right then we go to John 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and word was God in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in Hebrews 1 and said verses says hath in these last days spoken us to and to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world and world's and may God at His blessing to the ends of his word may be seated please many times I looked this over and I still realized I typed in a couple of things but that's all right Lord knows all about it one thing when I was in the service and I still like to do it to find but you know I looked at that motel room last night and talking about this little message with Brenda I said we could just turn out all the lights get rid of all the light pollution around the city we could really see the stars one thing I enjoy being on a ship in the Navy was we could get out in the middle of the ocean or the only lights you can see it would be the ones on the top of the mast and you talked about seeing some stars you know if you can get out away from the city whether it's in the mountains or the desert and get away from all the city lights or light pollution as they call it you can really see the handiwork of God and so I want to read a quote then I'm trying to just wait and see where the Lord wants me to go with this as the eagle stirreth her nest in 1960 brother Branham says this go out some night and look up at the solar system see that's what I like to do go out some night and look up at the solar system he said here's some time ago I was taken up to Mount Palomar that's in California and there through a glass you could see a hundred and twenty million light years of space figure it up how many miles is it and how how many and how fast does like travel a hundred and ten 20 million years of light space and beyond that was still moons and stars and world's How Great Thou art How Great Thou art [Music] now I feel better so brother Graham said figure it up - when I started on this little little lesson this little sermon now if anybody in here is better at math than I am and probably most all of you so if I made a mistake on my numbers just as I say take me for what I mean not for what I said all right but I've tried to get them correct the speed of light is 186,000 282 miles per second that's about 670 million 616 - 629 million miles in an hour all right it's about 16 billions 794 million seven hundred ninety nine thousand and 99 miles in one day while truckers can't even do that a lifetime yeah and that's about six trillion miles in a year that light will travel no brother Ram said spoke of looking through a telescope and seeing a hundred and twenty million light years and he said and beyond that was still just think as far as they could see now this is back in the sixties now they got the Hubble and I don't know how far they claim they can see with that but farther and they've seen a lot of amazing things but he said and beyond that was still stars moons stars moons and worlds yeah and he said how great thou art how great thou art on true Easter seal in 61 he says now if you'll notice I was standing here not long ago at Mount Palomar California and I was noticing that the telescope that can see a hundred and twenty million light-years of space now think a hundred and twenty million light-years of space how many miles that would be broken down to yet but yet heaven is so many billions and billions and billions of light-years beyond that till it's not even thought of how would we get there it's the travel it'll be like with the mind it'll be so fast it'll be faster you can think of heaven and that's how quick could be there Jesus after he was resurrected came right through the walls right through the doors and stood and eat boiled fish and honeycomb hallelujah speed no sooner than life had gone out of this body and were in the presence of God younger we only know his feet inches yards miles and so forth we're in this earthbound system but what when we leave here brother oh my what a time now we talk about the speed of light 186,000 + miles per second six trillion miles in a year if you're gonna go 120 million light years out there I wish I had a blackboard or some but I can't do it you'd have to look at it this way how far is that 720 quin trillion miles 720 with 18 zeros I didn't even know that number existed said that would be equal if my figures are right that would be equal to taking 15 billion 69 million 66 thousand five hundred and fifty five round trips to the moon back we couldn't live that long if you're gonna do a round trip of it you're gonna go out 120 million and come back 120 billion and I just figured this one out last night ask Brenda what's after Quinn trillion why you look it up there is a number after Quinn trillion but I did Bob was a million dollars boggles me let alone this of this size okay and I see round-trip of 120 million light years how many miles that's 1 sextillion 440 Quinn trillion miles my Lance and beyond that right just think brother branham told us before they even had the Hubble and before science really knew he said there was men ian's of solar systems out beyond and then they found that out yeah they're finding more and more I was explaining to Brenda last night when I looked out the window I said just think when we look up and we go out and we look up in space and even with the telescope when they take that telescope and they look up in space do you realize that they're limited on what they're seeing out there they may starting to telescope ever how big that thing fits over their eye but when he gets out there sure it may be multi millions of miles across right there but they're looking there what about up there what about down there about over there what about over there what about down there what about down there see they're seeing one I don't know what word I say dimension I don't think it's that mentioned I look at one quadrant one area but they've got all the space and if you turn that telescope and look here then what about all of that over there what about all that over there you're looking in that area and what you're seeing is all those stars yeah all of those planets all of those moons all of those solar systems that are out there and yet it's it's it's in a great big I guess I've got it right space is like a great big bubble or a great big ball but it isn't without even brother branham said but we've often wondered if you go if you could travel fast enough and far enough and get to shall we say the end of space over there that back wall what's beyond that nothing all right cuz God didn't make anything beyond that but when we talk about how big space is time and space and travel then I want you to think of this Brigham says and then the Bible says that God fills all of time and space that's how great God is how did all of that get there oh one great big explosion really well maybe it was an explosion but not the way they explained it it may have exploded all for something and exploded all for God's hands and he blew it out through there as brother branham described he watched that thing go down through there to fly through space seize it for about a million miles then he reached out there and he stopped it yeah he liked where that one was so then there was another one and another one and another one so they say in the beginning here's the point oh you know I was raised that way oh god made heavens on earth in six days all right no he didn't and to beginning God made the heavens and the earth and then after that he formed what was on the earth that was six days we all know that I think all of us do but how much time did he take he could have known it I believe in one split second if he wanted to but he took his time and he drew that map out there he laid it all out in it everything is just there and every star every planet every Sun hangs in its place and does not move out of its place brother man said about one planet out there be it ever so far moved out of its orbit and started moving it would upset the whole thing now apply that spiritually to you in the church if you will keep your place think about it everything will work just like he's supposed to but if you step out of your place it's gonna upset the whole church it upsets the whole operation of God it's like myself I'm a minister but in my home church I'm a deacon I cannot take out of deacon and step over say well I'm gonna be pastor we've got a pastor God didn't put me in there to be pastor he didn't send me down here say all right brother Jack God send me down here you're out and I'm in will guess what brother Layden God need more couple things on that one cuz I'm Cillian you see how it is that's the way the planets are that's the way God's church operate brother branham taught us that don't try to take the other man's position stay in a position where you were called if you're a sole leader and not not that bastard then stay some leader if you're a deacon to stay a deacon if you're a pianist or musician say a musician if your trustee stay a trustee if you're a prayer warriors take a prayer boyer you're the pastor stay the pastor stay in your position and stay in prayer as I said the other night and the church will work in harmony but what if one person get out of line step out of their position and it takes the whole thing and turns it into a tumult it just won't work right because something said it's like going down the road with that we your tires have to be balanced they put wheels our have weights on the wheels in and they got that harmonic balancer where they can spin it and they know where to put it exactly where to put the weights on now most of the men know that maybe the women too anymore they're so smart with these things but and that was a compliment not another but you're on a tour of your mark but the thing is I'm saying it's one of those weights be it ever so small come over that wheel and you can tell it with yours if you're paying attention you can tell it when you're driving because something doesn't feel quite right you get just that little vibration in the steering wheel well I can happen in a church have you pay attention to stay tuned into God and tune into where you're going and what you're doing you can feel something's not quite right something's a little nervous something's happened I don't know what maybe don't know exactly what it is Omar then what do you do you go back to Wednesday night pray pray pray pray I gotta say tonight one brother I'll be alright but I'm just saying if we've got to stay where God puts us no it's not even in my note so don't ask me why I don't know that was for his brother Nathan said I don't know what that was for alright listen let me go we get back on track we're talking about how far to travel Oh my point is can you imagine just in your mind our great God how great is he I told Brenda as I talk about all that time point what but about that and dad and that girl they'd seen that area what about all the rest of this that you can't even see what's out beyond what that telescope will see what are they gonna come up with that telescope that brother Brian said they could look through that and they'd look around and because light bends and because a space is not it's not without in they'll look and they'll be looking and they'll be looking at the back of their head I read here a few years ago where they said they've already found a planet out there that they believe it is exactly like Earth I've brought to my mind other oh I wonder if they are looking at earth but they just don't realize it but they need something a little stronger we'll see I could be wrong it's just my thoughts on that that in hand twenty dollars against you some deed maybe as an eagle Woking sarpy true Easter seal 1961 I've already read that one didn't I so many miles broken down and that that figured out and break it down that's what got me on this and I said I did that or the best I could so let's do the world falling apart the world is again falling apart in Shreveport 63 now Einstein I was listening to a lecture of him here the other night in New York City that he made in one of his last lectures and he was talking about a constellation a little galaxy it was out in the in the constellation and he said if man started through space traveling at the speed of light and he said what is that a 8000 or something somebody said 100 6,000 all right 186,000 miles per second it would take him a hundred and fifty million light years to get there he found eternity then he said to come back it would take him another hundred another hundred and fifty million of years which would be 300 million years and the space that he was gone from Earth would only be about 50 years that's Einstein said there you are broke into attorney oh my the greatness of God and when he made the whole solar system do it you're saying most of us sitting on earth don't realize when we look up and we see all of these stars and we think it's saying it is wonderful do you realize all you're doing is looking at our part of the galaxy it's a Milky Way and you can have the Milky Way and you say well here it is there's the Milky Way but guess what we're down here we're down right down down here in this little neighborhood then we got all the rest and what's out beyond that and what's beyond that and what's beyond that and all of it God Himself made by his own word spoken into existence and he started learning I don't know how many millions billions trans or Quinn trans or sex trillions of years it took but it God had a no beginning no end so we don't have to worry about that but he made it all friends that's what I'm trying to get it he is such a great God that he could do all of that and I asked Britain I said then why is it if we can ever catch that vision that idea that revelation if you would I don't mean ideal in that sense with that revelation and that vision of how great God really is that he can make all of that then we can't even get healing for a headache we can't darn get increase my faith God and I can get whatever I need for whatever I said whatever I need he said what so ever you desire whatsoever you have need of speaking in faith believing and I will bring it to pass here we Center you oh I don't know I don't know you know I know God healed brother so and so on I know he heals sister son sir but what about me well what about you he's a great gunner you his child if you're his child he will heal you he will bring it to pass where there's today tomorrow next week next year he said I will do it what we have to do is hold the faith that no matter what it looks like what brother branham teaches don't look at the symptoms look at the author look at the promise look at the words God said I am THE LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases he said I am THE LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases and he will do it but you have to hold on to reach out there grab that thing and hold on to it don't let go of it keep it there I don't care you say well it's a bottle half empty or half full why don't carries got water in it lot see it's 50 well now then it must be half full it doesn't matter which way it goes it's got water it's like I told her son-in-law of mine that was slated been dying man that being the other pasture locally he was laying there he says oh and he told us so over the years oh but I blaspheme the Holy Ghost ania I can't I can't serve God I can't be saved because I blaspheme how did he blaspheme some some women it said some derogatory comment about something about the Lord about the Bible and he read a variety about it he belly blast famed I said well tell me something Cody I said do you want to serve God he's laying in the hospital it'll die do you want to serve God he said well yeah I want to serve God I said tell me something you say you blaspheming then why do you bother he carried one that little pocket of New Testament read it and read it and read it and read it and read it and read it over and over that's it you would say you want to serve God yeah and you say you blaspheme yeah then why you bothered reading the Bible well I like to read it together but you blaspheme what good is reading the Bible gonna do if you blaspheme you say you got there why do you bother carrying it man come on think about it as if you blaspheme yeah and you want to serve God yeah that's it brother branham tata said if you ever try speed the Holy Ghost you wouldn't care because the story of the woman the last thing just sit there or stand there watch her mother fried and is it a skillet in hell like on a hot skillet I wouldn't bother her a bit then I said and yet you tell me you want to serve God as a new heaven blaspheme you may have told them women all but maybe they deserve it but you did not make fun of the Holy Ghost they were wrong and you told him in no uncertain terms maybe you were right maybe you were wrong but you did not bless him because if you had you would want to serve him well about that time the little nurse earth of what you call a door what if she comes in with this big old thing sets a big pitcher of water on there on his table across his lap the pastor looks at that water and he looks into you know Cody he said servant God just like that water there's a glass sitting there and then that carafe or what have you call that thing he said you could either tell you reach out there and pour you a drink you're in a desert diet of thirst you can pour yourself a drink and take it and live or you can sit there and look at it and die right there thing was three months later he went home but he had three months he come out of that hospital he went he worked for American eyelid I have islands oh boy it's gonna be good American Airlines he was a steward where God like the Union steward he was known as a troublemaker because he didn't take no guff off of the off of the the establishment he fought for everything he'd give you know they're the rights accorded the rules he just boom when they didn't like seeing Cody come but in that next three months that he had he went back he went to everybody he could think of that he'd never rolled through brought him to I made it right he witnessed for God everywhere he went he read his Bible can still read his Bible but he lived a different life he talked to different life he acted a different life and I did this funeral and it was 400 people are almost all up from his work and everybody every one of the company said there was something different about Cody he changed said we don't know what happened but something happened to him and he changed it was not the same man he was before he went into that hospital because I preached and told him you wanna know what it was it was cause he accepted Jesus Christ and on the inside was the Holy Ghost and he had changed because of that and you want to do that you want to be like him then you accept the same God that he did [Applause] but he went home but I don't gonna see you again what is it it's what you're looking at and how you look at it the same people that can hear the same message we haven't said huh oh well you know I know there's a look at it and live because they believe it they can pick up the same Bible to read the same scripture and get a different interpretation a different idea or decided don't apply to them or don't apply anymore but the same God that made the universe humph team billions or trillions or quad trains or sex trades or whatever it was years ago it's still the same today they say his word doesn't change and he don't change what brother Graham said world falling apart again he says then this astronaut the other day now most of you weren't even alive during this time 1963 they talk about Russian astronaut that send a cosmonaut up and he got up there and I remember this reads headlines in the paper Roshan an astronaut said he couldn't find God in space couldn't find him on the earth either this astronaut the other day flying over around over Russia there and he said he's seen no God angels and Brent said how ignorant can people be he said when when God and the whole system whole solar system he bloated off his hands and he sits so many million light-years beyond that Wow to sing God's it's beyond everything he's made there somewhere out there that is the seed of God and that's where he's at but being out there he's still here yeah because he fills all the time in space and he knows what we needed when we needed it how we need it and he is a long time God all right and the whole thing is upheld by what by his power and his word and every start is as the quote I was referring to and every start has to hang in it in its place yes sir then was humble enough taking of God then he was humble enough to come down and be made one of us to die for us we're without excuse if one of them stars what happened to move from its socket from its orbit where it is at if it would move it would affect the whole solar system this whole system would must turn exactly the same for one depends on the other Sun state about the Church of God whether it's a local assembly here or the world assembly across town where the whole assembly no kotoba focus down in Bullington every local assembly in Jeffersonville we've all got to be working insects working together and plywood what are we Sam what are we uh what's our orbit around the Word of God we've got to stay around and stay that everybody's gotta stay in this place everybody's got to stay in this place everybody's gonna do what they're supposed to do they've gotta stay with that word of God and constantly mood in the spirit of God in the leading of God he is so great that he has set the church in order but the churches sometimes refuses to get in order they want to step out and do their own thing they want to step out into well I think I've got a better way well that was that was the old devil zeal no Satan's old thing - I've got a better way I'm gonna lift myself up and I'm gonna be like God your nose he didn't say he was gonna be God he said I'm gonna be like cut through the most high well he couldn't he be like him alone with him so he had a pervert his word to do anything but that's the way the many of them are even around the message for instance is why the other night I was telling the people staying with watch you her stay with the taste stay with the Bible stay with the revealed word stay with that no matter what I don't care who preaches it with me me her brother brother Doug or any other ministry comes through if it rings off with this little off sound you're not quite sure get back to the word and find out maybe you misunderstood maybe the brother misunderstood but something if it's not ringing right it's got to be checked out know what brother man preach on the uncertain sound we've got to make sure we're all in tune with the Word of God into but the Spirit of God doing what God wants when God wants it and how God wants if he's a longtime God he expects us to be on time we've got to move in unison with him about all these spirits and several he's in here about that I see we read this one it's a paradox in 64 down here in Tampa said a few days few weeks ago I was in New York City at the Mars auditorium and I heard this tape of Einstein talking about that of that galaxy how how many if we left here and when I think was 150 million light-years of travel and traveling at the speed of light would take us 150 million years to get over there and then 150 million years to get back now you know how fast light travels and just think of it a hundred and fifty million years light years what if you'd run a row of nines around the world around and around and around the world you'd never break it down in years just nine nine nine closer closer all around the world you couldn't break it down to news four just like I think like travels what is 186,000 miles a second and a Lightyear and so forth in 300 million years trying to pair it up as you and you know how long then it'd been gone from Earth to 50 years Wow it's hard to hard to comprehend in this you can travel 300 million light-years and whoops get back up there I lost my place I keep doing that ever soft all right maybe that's good they said um who is who is God in Cleveland in 1950 brother man said he is so first he is he was God Jehovah and out of him said just picture now a little drama so you can get it let's let's see some coming coming out of space where there's nothing and make it a little white light like a mystic light like a halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the Father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God let us notice this now I have to make this before going back into it just like a little drama here for you for a moment in order to get one point to you what is in our midst tonight I could ask that what's in our midst this morning if we just enter into it and in there so now see this is like a little child playing before the door it was the son of God the logos he didn't say it was a little child he said was like a little child and I can see him there and he spake that's why he said that's why in the first I said in the beginning was the word words lose God Word was God and he made everything but then you go there he said and by Christ he made everything so the light which was God so himself in that light that was God that was a part of God it was that light from there spoken and made everything let there be light he said there was nothing but there was something happen and an Adam turned there and began to whirl around this away and the son come into existence and he said let there be said there's the authority where did it come from I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was light and I could see a piece of it fly off like that it was a meteor in a few hundred a few years or a hundred million years if you want to call it and it's circle way out and I see him standing there watching it and it falls down in here and he stops it after it falls for a few million years he'd listen hang there in orbit here goes another one flying off the Sun and it goes over that it hangs down and he stops it what's he doing writing his first Bible notice the first human beings at once looked up into the heavens he put all the stars in the heavens the zodiac starting off with the Virgin in him with Leo the Lion first coming of Christ the second coming of Christ came by the Virgin came again by as the Lion of the tribe of Judah there he put his first Bible and back in those days the Ancient of Days they looked at those things there and he's got his Bible wrote here and he wrote it in the heavens that man would look up and realize that Jehovah the Creator lived above and I can see him and he looked at that and I can see him to speak this speak this world hanging there as an as an icicle whatever it was on the way whatever it was way away and he moved it over there and I can see this little light go out now we got to now the father and out of the father came the light the Sun and I can see that light moving over and pulled the earth over here near the Sun to dry off and begin to raise the waters up and separating the land from the water and so forth oh my think of it God Himself doing all of this making things said where did it come from I don't know but he believed his own word were they created it of nothing but he knew that he had the power to do it he was all mighty Jove at that time he wasn't God he was Jehovah he was at all self-existing one that existed within himself until he made something to worship Him what do you got worship then he became our God see so we go down through this then this God this great God that brother Graham kids talk about this great God that the Bible and all the prophets keep talking about this great God that we say we worship this Great God that we say we believe in yet we can't reach out and believe for what sometimes not a to thing not a headache not a handi not a leg a wheel didn't feel a little but I've got cancer well what's that cancer - God oh but I've got I've got children on drugs what is that - God oh and I've got children that's an alcoholic well tell that to Rosella she was still here God delivered a full blown out in the hallway that that doctors and all of the clinics and everything else they couldn't do a thing poor turn Russ and you're hopeless get on out of here but when she came across God's prophet and he discerned God showed him what it was and he discerned that in there and then he spoke the word she was pure because God that made the body can cleanse it and cure it soon and he did and she lived pouring from that day forward to seek God can do these things I talked to a brother the other night he was here he said about how 40 years ago he he overdid he OD it starts he overdosed himself the same thing I guess he OD they brought him back to life with narcan back then he said but after then he gave His life to Lord he's been serving God see God done Liberty from the drugs yeah teeth dog can deliver from alcohol he could deliver from drugs he can deliver from headaches he can deliver from cancers he can deliver coiners as we've had about put eyesight back in he can even give you the color eyes you want sat told the sisters down ate brother in Boynton Boynton Beach and brother jeans the two sisters come up with real bad eye trouble pulled out their little prayer cloths that I carry and I said listen I want to tell you said I had this this part of this brother branham suit and part of it's about another piece that brother Brandon prayed over and I three pieces sew them together and another one his brother Joseph brother Billy and brother Collins prayed over I said I had this in my pocket and when I would tail Salvador and sister Maldonado came up and she said brother late and I need you to pray for me she's not going blind in both eyes I'm 95% blind with macro degeneration yeah both eyes not one both eyes so I took my side and we were standing outside the church and I just put the put the call from one I pray this short prayer put it on the other that pray a short prayer and as he got to heal the woman's eyes on restore our eyes two months later I get a letter from my interpreter saying the woman can see that was Almighty God see all I'm saying is what is it we have to believe we say we pick it up and we say oh I believe God's Word do you we're talking about a great God that created everything that there is if we could just sit and to sit quietly go outside and sit on your patio or on your porch or in your backyard or or or go down to the ocean and sit or go to the park and sit sorry especially early in the morning go down I'd love to get up with it so whether it's not so hot and sit on them sit on the the back porch that's where I got that's where that what about the the importance of prayer came to me I was sitting out there looking and listened to the birds chirping and and watching the the things go on and looking at the grass and looking at the trees and all the different things and the weeds and then all these different things that was created and thinking about how great God is and how much we loved him and how much it all said it serve rollabout about the important the prayer you see all of this but are you praying enough but are you praying enough are you doing enough prayer are you just going to your life I know they're all God I'm guilty Lord God I'm guilty forgive me and this ridges messy just came the other couple whatever it was month or so ago and since then I've been trying to preach it and preach it and preach it every time I get a chance why to get God's children to wake up and realize we have got to pray and I'm not going back into that message but that's the one thing that most of us don't do enough oh then we've got to pray as I told a mere Wednesday night you want a revival to break out in this church of those you that weren't here then go to prayin yeah call it on God I earnestly get desperate get down and get desperate and pray and pray and pray let's see what God will do as I told the pastor you want that church building over there go to pray in I told Brenda I'm not even gonna mention that but I guess I am say do you want that church building over there alright go to pray and ask God for the same God that made this earth could give you that do you realize it helping Jefferson better but New Albany where our churches we went through three churches before we got ours they then started in his home then he moved it to the Women's Club those aren't churches or just places but then we moved to the storefront and turn that into a church yeah then we had them we went to the Methodist Church who's gonna buy it they sold it out from under us well God must had some better force that's a very thing we all said well we don't get this when he's got something better that was on a Sunday you know Monday we three of us it seen the building Orion now think about it on a Monday after Sunday the next day we seen them come a think this this now two others already call me well praise God just go get it [Applause] in between we had to go to the optimist club her and brother Donny Reagan boy brother Donny Reagan was there for that meeting Oh wonderful meetings even though was it the optimist club who's still God was there that's what counted not the building yes so then we we got that building we had to share it for a couple of months with the report of the Latter day Saints I think it was so we had to share it you know meetings off and on but but we made it do it once we bought it it was ours listen we own I don't know we've mad a hundred people at that time but I'm bragging on God what he does we're sitting in the optimist club and brother Nathan told the people what we needed we raised $30,000 in one night 10,000 10,000 in cash and another 20,000 promised one man took it out of his IRA and gave it to him and said you don't even have to pay it back I'm gonna pay it use it to pay my ties off as we go along will deduct every time that this battalion that's my tithing okay what are you gonna do I know the I got a loan app and said all you have to do is take your time just pay it back as you can I don't even know who the two men were none of my business 30 I'm not here to preach because once you see what I'm trying to do is build your faith he's serving great God our brother man to say somewhere on tape and I don't know where so anyway he talked about if you're needing money he said God can lay I'll cross the other side of the world or the other side of the country lay it on somebody's heart and one day you walk out to your mailbox and there's a check in there sure brother Joseph was one to fix up Stillwater's camp didn't have the money to do it that brother from the Ukraine I think it's the countries from hope there was Hannah had been having trouble with his crops it was gonna go broke because his crops kept failing his crops kept failing he promised God that if you'll restore my crops and let me make you do good my crops and so forth I will support anybody you want me to support I'll help him miss god help him and help him he come down to Jeffers a pill for some reason I can't remember I know my wife does but I can't remember right now and he was sitting there and he brother Joseph came over and got to talking to him and he looked at my brother Joseph and he says what can I do for you brother Joseph he said I'm glad you asked thank come with me sure took him out to the lake he told this is my vision this is what I want to do he said do it I'll support it everyone here every year every year every year every year he's supporting it he says why people go to camp free cuz he's supporting it and he supported all the other stuff so what is it God has a man someplace somewhere or a group of people that you really wanted God can give it to you but what is your buck I told the pastor what's your reason for one night you gotta have the right reason it's not to walk around say well look at us that's wrong look what God did for me I mean we're really somebody we're really special we ain't nobody might be five or six foot of the dirt that's all it is and when we plan to send the ground we know better than the rich man and he's no better than us see I'm serious but when God this great god I've been telling you about when you get sincere when you get serious when you get desperate this great God will come on the scene he did what he tell them what he tells sister Hedy right he said you would ask anything you want anything you want a million dollars gonna put it there you want to what your sister healed she'll be healed she's out with my boys the one thing you would last through eternity the salvation of her two sons money would be gone the sister would die sooner or later a new here maybe get sick again but the point is she wanted to salvation to her boys so why do we want a bigger church because we want a place that can be dedicated to God so we don't have to listen this up I was here when they first started worldly garbage going on they want to call it church a church but it sounds kind of like I mean does forgive me look they're worshiping God the only way they know how okay so we are in reality we should feel sorry for them they don't see what we see they don't have what we had Lord can you save them that's what that's the way I really feel God I I'm sorry they have to go through that listen my grandson Whitney's got a little girlfriend he would okay place up there called southeast Christian oh that's farther undermine southeast Christian yeah grab your coffee and your doughnuts and go able to sit down in the sanctuary and drink your coffee and eat your doughnuts come as you are do as you want wear what you want shorts halters whatever you know I'm into shorts tank tops just have your coffee put your money in the offering plate rock and roll music hard rock music acid rock music whatever kind of hard rock rock rock rock there's nothing no Christianity about it just devil music is all this and yet that's what they like third they're trying to worship God in that and what'd she tell Andrew said do you like this don't you like that music he said no she said why he tried to explain to her about singing the right type of hymns from the heart that that really worship and lift up God saying bring down let's break down the Holy Spirit she said but that music will bring the spirit down it'll bring spirit all right but she didn't get it but you know yeah I feel sorry I pray for I want her to see what we see here's the problem her great granddaddy was a minister under brother Branham but her granddaddy got away from it her mama got away from it she's away from it and her mama admits I'm wrong yes you are she's Brotherly I know I bribe didn't raise them in church I should have I roll as it yes you are I need to be taken to church I said yes you do Andy I said you detain go full have you don't ma'am you don't to come to our church go to some church get a full gospel church and go to it get them girls in church where they learn how to dress right an act right top right can be right run around looking like some street partner go man it's a long way from I miss each other I said all of these different things like this because we have got to work together in the will of God you want to church till God you wanted Towe God why you wanted we want a place where we can go and gather together without having to put up with a lot of other stuff we're going to be dedicated to you or the service in your service to sing and worship and preach the Word of God and win souls and then you got once we get there you bring in you and to the church day you bring a man but you do your part to get a man and let him do the rest of it listen when we got our little church we had like 50 70 only about 75 people once we got the church win two years r up to 200 [Music] not because it's proselyting or you know because people just want to come they want sunday school that's right they won't bring their children I want this and what they what they want most of all is be able to worship God in spirit for the head and truth dr. bud listen shouting this great jumping is good running is good speaking in tongues is good clapping your hands is good we're gonna need all this down that's good but it's the Word of God is gonna keep you up you can go to a ball game and do all that stuff you go to a ball game and get so excited you can't even talk but what is it when you come to church what is the Spirit of God moving on you then that's wonderful that's what we want we want the Spirit of God to move we want to hear man here we don't want just a bunch of emotion running around what do you want the Holy Ghost better better view then you can't contain it like I said you got to blow the steam off somewhere maybe you gotta jump up and down then jump up and down you gotta shout this shop you feel like do it yeah I don't know what you gonna do I told brother Jack I stand on the platform in our church sometimes I some over there you those have been turned on by myself on that bench when Nathan stopped there that would I don't want this praising God my hands up and all the sudden other oh that was me speaking in tongues nobody knows about me and him yeah but say that that's the way it is I'm not saying that you others they may be speak in tongues louder and I do that's fine I'm gonna get slapped I'm not against him jumping no jumping he love don't jump any higher than your live I used to run it don't run any faster than you can live either I'm gonna get chaton but don't shout any louder anything more than what you live if you live the life and you've got a dedicated Holy Ghost build life then you worship God however you want to hey you took a camera and went down through there just danced his heart out to his wife make money do you think that some watch this and here we go again see there is a time and a place for it and then there's the time to replace what God loses nothing but the Word of God and repentance is done and he leaves his tongue and signs and partners and miracles are done why because he's a great God about as far off my message as the moon is from the earth who's that feller so does anyone know pre-charge [Applause] paradox I read that one okay who is God and Cleveland I think I read that one I'm not sure okay so I keep hitting this thing and it moves I don't watch it moves on me then I get lost that's a child yes I read that one right in his first Bible okay all right who is Melchizedek that read that one no goddamn more Fame asked in the pillar of fire goddamn or faiien him in a man called Jesus God in more freight in his church hello Saints well hundred make you shout got it more from you in his church but it's a holy God what one is the Holy Ghost I've heard bees all over the Holy Ghost and God we meet no no what is God he's spirited what is God he's holy oh did you know wandering one still makes to Holy Spirit oh we I know we Pentecost call him the Holy Ghost well he's not a ghost in that sense but he is the Holy Spirit we understand what he's saying right God in us God with us God in us God above us the condon sending god god that was so great that he could come down amongst us think about it God they created all of this God they've done all of this yet he come in a human body because he loved us so much that he knew because of the fall of Adam and Eve that he we couldn't make our way back on our own it had to be one brothers head had kinsman redeemer he had to come down and become a kinsman redeemer a human being and suffer like we suffer the same temptations the same things that he went through and yet loved me and you so much that He gave His life for us and hung on a cross but then he proved he was God like brothers and when he died he was man and it proved he was man but when he resurrected he proved he was God that same God thing what'd he do then he ascended up on high cities very spirit down to the church on the day of Pentecost so they could be filled with his spirits and live his life and that's what we're supposed to do the same God that made the whole creation of heavens and earth and stars and Suns and moons in solar systems and planets and then come down to this earth here and dried it off and put all the trees and and everything else that we see in the plants and the animals and everything else on here that same God then became one of his own to bring us back into fellowship with him yeah and then people want to sit home on Sunday mornings say well I don't know if I can get up and make it down there and listen to some man I don't blame him for not listening to me but the point is go to church in fact I just heard brother man say this morning go to church somewhere so listen one at the motel go to church somewhere all right he came down then up there there was no up there holy no one can touch him he settled upon the mountain and even if an animal touched him out he had to die but God come down and changed his tent and came down and lived with us became one of us we held him the Bible said in first Timothy 3:16 without controversy there's no arguments without controversy great is the mystery of God for God was manifested in the flesh handled with hands eat meat drank water god slept God cried God was one of us beautiful typed in the Bible that God was above us God Witness and now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person God came down became flesh and died the death in in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get it for fellowship God loves fellowship and that's what that's that's what he made man fit the first time for was to fellowship God dwelt alone with cherubims and now notice he made man and man fell he came down and redeemed man because God loves to be worshiped and to bury God means object of word God means object of worship and this that comes among us as a pillar fire is something that changes our hearts is the same God that said let there be light and there was light he's the same yesterday today and forever mine it's the same God that me had been created everything the same God that we go to for the Holy Ghost the same God that we go to for prayer the same God that we go to for every need he's the same God today as he was back then he's the same God that created flies and pleased and turned the city in the darkness he's the same God that brought water from the rock he's the same God that separated the waters and let the children of Israel walk through he's the same God that rolled back Jordan he's the same God that did that created that the fish in the and the bread in fed 5000 there's the same goddess it cast your net out on the other side oh my god we we fished all night cast it out there anyway they get it almost sunk their boat they had so much fish it's the same God the same God that walked down to the grace of my dream of Lazarus and resurrected Lazarus we now save God it came down and in West Palm 18 years ago and resurrected me in Gothic doing all of that this is the same guy that walked in top with William Branham cousin same God I'm a walking talk with you if you got the Holy Ghost business ain't God today it was yesterday and we're not looking off way out younger somewhere except for the resurrection in the rapture but we're looking at what is God doing for me today well it's God doing for you today what does God want you to do what do you want to do what do you have Nita it's the same Almighty God how great this God is if we came to serve if we really do believe him and we really do say to really do serving then you tell me what it is that we can ask that he won't do for us us not but you have not because you ask not yes not because you don't believe you know reach out and grab faith and hold on to it no matter what that looks like hang on to there's a God you promised God you promised God you promised but that's all in Wednesday night I have trouble with my kidneys here I'll put share this for about three years ago I take it so much pain medicine from my back that it damaged my kidneys they were down to like 50 or 60 percent of a function the doctor told me so what are they gonna do nothing no medication they nothing they can do with it maybe replace him but one time for that so I would we went to a service at the church there and we had to I forget who was in what I've got prayed for from that day forward

year or the next year or the next year I hung onto it because if he just said it's better if he said it worse I'm still healed see that's what we've got to get so you have a need you hang on to God because he is Almighty God he is a great God he's a wonderful God he's not dead he's not uncaring He loves us and he cares for his children and he promised to do things for us from healings to providing our needs whatever need yes we all have needs let's ask God about it let's quit saying oh well I'll pray there now hope like I said the other night I have to repeat this one too it just popped in my mind listen I was in the church one time and I'm gonna call names you'll probably know it but the point is the past little sister come up preparator faster when I learned he prayed for her and she went down he was down that side she's about halfway back to her seat he says now let's hope that God heals her I looked at other children my wife and I said hope really Oh message preacher said let's hope that God heals err no sir if you prayed the prayer of faith then you send us as we know we thank God for healing I don't want anybody that haven't got faith I don't want to crane for me huh you don't really believe it go sit down I want somebody let's breathe together so I'll just go before the throne of mercy and let's get mercy he promised it oh my my see here got hit explain let me read this one I think I'm about done he said and I said then God the greatest that filled all of time and space hello City and came down to one little journey to the womb of a woman and then I said we are when are we saved today Jesus no I did something wrong man and then I said what are we saved today when are we saved today okay Jesus was neither Jew nor Gentile because the ink was only produced the egg only produced the flesh the blood had the life the Bible said we are saved by the blood of God see he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God therefore when we come to the altar and we put our hands by faith on his head and feel that the tearing and the agony at Calvary and confess our sins that we are wrong and that he died in our place you see I said the blood that that lamb could not come back upon this the blood the blood that cell that cell was broken and the life that was let loose and breaking this then this blood cell of the Lamb could not come back up on the water because it's an animal and it could not coincide with a human life so God Himself became a kinsman redeemer he became a human so that he could be the sacrifice and that blood the blood of God because it was created is what washes our it's the blood of God see the almighty God who fills all time and space the old mighty God who made everything there if it is as I said the solitary Sun every star every planet every solar system every Rock every blade of grass every every animal everything that you see all mighty God did all that that same God is mindful of his children and he wants to do for you brother Brennan said in another place he said God wants to heal you more than you want to be healed not to help out how much can we want to be healed over laying there sick think about that but if you you best be everything but then you wants to be healed but Almighty God was to heal you more than that so we're dudes reach out by faith and accept that healing because by my stripes you are healed not by hope by faith in my stripes in my word in my promise I will heal you how great is our God oh how great is our God he said greatest God who has ever heard Oh brain is his word this hour he said he rolled back the waters of the mighty Red Sea and he said I'll lead you put your trust in me Joe said Behold God is great and we know him not what we knowing now neither can the number of his years be searched out and since the psalmist David said for the Lord is a great God and and a great king above all gods and brother brems said on the fifth seal said now let me just let me review just for a minute what makes God greatest because he can make himself so simple that's what makes him great God is great and he can make himself in such a simple form that the wise of this world can't even see him they can't find him because he makes himself too simple now watch and this in itself is the mystery of the revelation of Christ see that this in itself that there can be nothing greater than God and you can't make anything as simple as he makes himself see that's what makes him I think who would have thought God made a way for you and I to come back into fellowship simply by becoming us dying resurrecting ascending and sending back your spirit and yet people read the same Bible say well there's three gods oh there's four gods oh there's two gods or there's no God of the Bible contradicts the message contradicts this contradicts then I don't find it what it is is a failure of them to get down and know the same God that we know and get the revelation and get the balance in the word it says this over here and this over here and this over here and when you run them through there you find out oh now I see what it means but you see he is a great God who is moved by the infirmities of our sickness he's moved by our needs he's moved by our desires but we have to make sure our desires line up with his word so that means healing that means salvation that means your mom your dad your children your brother's your sisters your neighbors your enemy all of them you've got to have the Holy Ghost you've got to have that then you can bring the other sin then you can live such a life that maybe they hopefully I said maybe I'm sorry you want to live such a life that they want to be like you so I've tried to tell Andrew I said you want this little girl that you think you love you want her to be a Christian then you live such a Christian life that she will want to be like you you don't go over to that territory you bring her to yours see we've got to that goes for me you've any other you want your mom and dad your children anybody live such a life that they want to be like you is brother I said be salty so they'll get thirsty live the life if they won out I want to be like that brother I want to be like that sister oh my help sweet they see how wonderful they are you know not because they stand up here and talk the message all day long or talk to my mom but it's because that lived like as brother Graham told us he said you know the Sun control more water out of the earth and up into the atmosphere then the pumps can do it and do it quietly that's the way we need to be we need to be like the Sun live such a life that that they'll want to come up and be like us and we don't have to be noisy if we listen don't go misunderstand me there's a time to talk to them about things but you know what the most important thing is being lived like what Paul said you're a written epistle read of all men if I stand up here and preach this gospel and I don't live it who wants to be like me think about it same thing goes for you for me for all of us we've got to but when I'm trying to get across this morning is we're serving a great God that will answer our prayers if we will pray earnestly it will pray sincerely even desperately and ask him for things and believe it that's it he said whatsoever you asked and people stop there well I asked him it but he said in faith believing did you believe or did you just ask did you ask him just hope or did you really have faith and if you really have faith then you'll have that revelation that God you promised it and I'm accept that promise I've got a revelation you said find my stripes you are healed you said s whatever you wanted my name in the faith believe it I'll do it then Lord I'm accepting that in you you've got to do it because your word said so and you don't why I gotta I gotta quit God is so good to us don't you love him yeah well Brenda now that I'm done preaching you want to peerless sing this song we were gonna sing it the first that I forgot about you thought you got away with it all right wow she's coming let's bow our heads real quick father I Love You Lord Jesus and appreciate you thank you for helping me I don't know what all these words were for I went far and wide from from some of the things that I had on the on the list to speak up but father I've learned to just follow you maybe there was someone sitting here that needed it I don't believe it felt on empty hearts are empty ears so Lord you take in and in my mistakes and my stuttering the Lord you taken to straighten it out to the people I did this for your glory not for me Lord but for you and for your children thank you for opening this door that I can speak to the to the cream of the crop Lord some of your children that's on this earth for now now God you'd be with them lead them guide and bless them encourage them and provide everything they have need of I give you praise honor and glory for your love and your kindness to me and to them in Jesus Christ's name Amen you're gonna turn so brother Jack would sing this I think we got a blanket eyes enough he started that you know here's amazing thing sometimes when you go places you don't know if we was ever brother Dan success tell me about it we sang this song after church Sunday evening no sunny afternoon brother come up friend he says where did you get that song she's a butcher here wheatmadge California he says yeah I've been there so he called me of all the places he had wheat patch how many people ever heard of weed patch California about 15 miles out of Bakersfield South in fact um you know the the actor and singer James Dean from back in the 50s that's where he was killed right there that supposed to be a four-way stop sign somebody didn't stop he got killed off anyway we patch California of all places and if they're that brother he do the same arena narrow Dawson he knew different people I knew another of all things come from California to to Indiana to Georgia and here's a guy that didn't live there but he'd been there many times and do the people oh wow okay we're gonna try and sing on the day on the day of Pentecost is what it's called [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] or they [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh it's [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it hasn't changed a bit it's still genuine it's old yet it's new let's do this before I turn it back to brother dev speaking of our Greek god his creation his power what he wants to do force anybody here need the Holy Ghost this morning let's do that first anybody need the Holy Ghost if you want to come if you have you've repented and you don't think you have it we'll do like we did it brother jeans will lay hands on you that scripture lay hands only receive the Holy Ghost if you haven't repented then get your life straight and this is a good time to do it right in the morning the evening whatever is you're in this church service brother if you haven't repented you haven't been baptized and I urge you to find a place to get to do that and I know you're new and the Binda in the way and so forth but you've got to like we said Wednesday night and you were here you heard the message about praying and praying getting desperate with God my trying to embarrass you now so if I do forgive me but we've got to I'd rather be embarrassed here and have to stand for him and think I'm gonna go in and get embarrassed I said step aside I never knew you sure let's not be bashful or embarrassed here I don't have embarrassed by me up there but we've got that it's only way you go do you got to get with him and really get serious with God and get though he goes and this here's the thing about it I told the sisters down there wanted he get it getting the Holy Ghost is not an emotion it's not people the openness I was raised in Pentecost I understand what what what people think sometime in Pentecost and some of these religions they think you got a jump and shout run and holler and speak in tongues you like to speak in tongues every prove you got the Holy Ghost Devils speak in tongues the Holy Ghost is not something comes in emotion but when you get it it will bring emotion seeking it brings emotion to because it make you cry and snot and yell and scream and holler to get desperate for god I've got a having a gun Avenue gotta have it gotta have it see but when you can it he said what what is I got told them sisters I said you know what the evidence says the Holy Ghost isn't one of them says not really I suppose is your simple it's believing every word of God and see people forget that because for look the devil leaves his message he plays every word of this Bible he's read the back page - we win he loses he knows it so just alone sin I believe it so does the devil but he fares and trembles believe in every word and living it the devil can't live it's believing it in because you do shame you widely believed it down in here to become a revelation then it's just like my unlikely that the Lamb that produces the wolf he don't have to manufacture his brother Manto's he did he's just Peter I have to go I gotta make more no it's just it's just there I don't have to get it I get up here that a server and start talking and God take hold of it I've done that before too it's just something it just happens we psyche receive the Holy Ghost ones if something happens like I'd like to tell people an example is you go to you you went to church every you sought God for the Holy Ghost and you weren't sure if he got it or not that's what that one man did where he went for preacher - pretty sure appreciate future they finally saved him brother Branham he said they've had it all the law you mean I've had it all along but I didn't jump I didn't shout it in Howard its make it does it but you have it so you go to bed you come here and it'll said you go to bed to get up the next morning y'all something different something different about me I don't understand it God but their son I don't want to run with them guys anymore or those gowns I don't want to go over here do this anymore I don't want to do that but I just feel such a love Radisson I love you sue me I just want to serve you that's all I'm gonna make you happy I want to please you there's something different I don't want to do all that stuff anymore then you realize what happened you got it all cleaned out you turned it around cleaned up your life and you said Here I am I'm a clean vessel door now come and fill me [Music] and he did it and you realize the only thing that bezel is for looks that bomb is no good unless I open it as one person while one purpose first that's me that I have one purpose is to serve my god that's what it's a served up it's not even I have to listen I don't come to church because I have to sing I don't live a good life because I have to I didn't stop lying stealing sheep lusted all these other things because I had to something in me I wanted to there was a love and me for price my wife when I realized what he done for me I want to serve Him I don't want to hurt him I don't want but if I do make a mistake [Music] gives me so you see that's what it when you didn't y'all said you realized oh I must have the Holy Ghost there's something different about me I don't want all that junk out there anymore all I wanna do is serve God not that I have to I want to I desires to please him see I believe all the word and I live it I'm a ring breath mr. rhythm oh man I realize that I've drank and smoked person I do all that I want to it's a thing that is the one who's been taken out that's it brother it's when you don't want it anymore all said you realize all that is gone oh I want to do this please my lord Wow I mean it's that simple relate yep but of course now the new birth isn't always that easy sometimes takes a lot of cry a lot of praying a lot of beating on the older whatever it takes this inside manner we have now earthly worldly spirit till he dies out and we're a new preacher but we've got to get rid of that old worldly spirit that was in there that guy that wanted to lust after all the women or chase all the men and lions team cheering super-steel and spoken and all these things that are that the world do all these places where you're not supposed to go do all these things you're not supposed to do as Christians and then all of a sudden when that's gone you realize something that's happened you've got a new spirit in there because he said I'll take out your nose Stoney spear dental stony-hearted you can do it he's nothing I'll put my spirit in there so you get a new spear and then he puts his spirit in there that's what it is so brother when you get to that point and then you know so when you've come to the point where you've pleaded opposite got that far now but I know I need something else you reach a point you say I'm ready then he said so that's beauty Barry are you that far and you're ready why don't you go Tech if
