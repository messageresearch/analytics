[51:41] book written
[51:43] within and on the backside sealed with
[51:46] Seven
[51:47] Seals and I saw a strong Angel
[51:51] Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy
[51:54] to open the book and to loose the seal
[51:56] thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in
[52:00] Earth neither under the
[52:03] Earth was able to open the
[52:06] book neither to look there on and I wept
[52:12] much but because no man was found worthy
[52:16] to open and to read the book neither to
[52:21] look their
[52:23] own and one of the elders saith unto me
[52:27] weep
[52:28] not Behold The Lion of Judah has

[53:07] wipe away all your
[53:12] tears
[53:15] amen
[53:19] um I want to go
[53:23] back and um trying to just see here in
[53:25] the order
[53:27] that I want to read these scriptures

[53:30] scriptures to read that's going to sort
[53:32] of tie this thing together and
[53:38] uh Luke the 13th
[53:47] chapter
[53:50] uh and the 25th
[53:54] verse when Once the master of the house
[53:56] is risen upon has shut
[54:00] the when Once the Master of the House is
[54:03] risen up and has shut to the door and ye
[54:08] began to stand
[54:11] without and to knock at the door saying
[54:15] Lord Lord
[54:17] open unto
[54:19] us and he shall answer and say unto
[54:23] you I know you not when ye whence she
[54:28] are then shall ye

[54:32] say we have eaten and
[54:36] drank in thy presence and thou H has
[54:40] taught in the
[54:43] streets but ye shall say but he shall
[54:47] say I tell you I know you not when ye

[54:55] iniquity
[54:58] there shall be
[55:00] weeping and nashing of
[55:03] teeth when ye shall see Abraham and
[55:07] Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in
[55:10] the kingdom of God and you yourself

[55:17] out and they shall come and they shall
[55:21] come from east and
[55:23] west and from North and from South and
[55:26] shall sit down in the kingdom of God now
[55:30] I want you to notice the new two
[55:32] contrast of the previous scriptures that
[55:34] I've read there's one
[55:36] group amen that uh there was much
[55:42] weeping and there was another group that
[55:44] God told to weep not right for The Lion
[55:49] and the tribe of Judah has
[55:53] prevailed amen so there'll be a group
[55:55] weeping
[55:57] and there'll be another
[55:59] group that he told to weep
[56:04] not I want to be in that group that he
[56:06] say weep
[56:07] not
[56:09] Hallelujah and dry up every
[56:12] tear but
[56:14] amen uh I want
[56:18] to go back and uh
[56:22] read another scripture here
[56:27] that our pastor has
[56:29] been
[56:31] reading read it from Luke the fourth
[56:36] chapter he was taking it from Isaiah
[56:42] 61 and he came to Nazareth where he had
[56:46] been brought
[56:48] up and my God as his custom
[56:56] he went into the synagogue on the
[56:59] Sabbath
[57:01] day and stood up for to
[57:05] read
[57:07] now I want to I I have
[57:10] to
[57:13] address it was custom right yes sir for
[57:18] him to go to church on Sunday
[57:23] right that was customary
[57:28] right and it's still customary
[57:34] today amen
[57:36] [Music]
[57:38] so there we have a
[57:41] scripture on what the pastor was talking
[57:44] about on
[57:45] [Music]
[57:46] Wednesday that a lot of times
[57:49] we there are times when we have our Ox
[57:52] in the ditch and we have to but a true
[57:55] Christian
[57:56] come on wants to go to
[58:00] church amen right wants to be in
[58:05] [Music]
[58:08] fellowship with the Saints and with the
[58:11] Lord so you see here even
[58:15] Jesus went to
[58:17] church no doubt he was
[58:20] [Music]
[58:22] busy no doubt he had other things to do
[58:26] right oh yes but it was custom come
[58:30] on to go to church on Sunday yes
[58:36] sir and
[58:39] he uh went there and he read and there
[58:44] was delivered unto unto him the
[58:48] book of the
[58:52] prophets and when he opened the book so
[58:56] the priest gave him the
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] book and obviously the book was closed
[59:02] when he gave it to him all right it took
[59:07] him to open the
[59:11] book and he
[59:14] said when he had opened the book he
[59:17] found the place where it is
[59:20] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[59:24] me
[59:26] because he hath anointed
[59:29] me to preach the gospel to the
[59:34] poor one he has sent me to heal the
[59:40] brokenhearted
[59:43] two to preach
[59:47] Deliverance to the
[59:49] captives and recover sight to the
[59:54] blind to set at
[59:57] Liberty them that are
[1:00:01] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:05] Lord and he closed the
[1:00:10] book and he gave it again to the
[1:00:13] minister and sat
[1:00:16] down and all eyes all the eyes the eyes
[1:00:20] of all them were in the synagogue fasten
[1:00:25] upon him
[1:00:27] now I notti want you to notice that he
[1:00:29] came for a specific reason he was
[1:00:34] identifying who he was and what he was
[1:00:37] coming to do yes sir amen
[1:00:41] yes but see just like the people then I
[1:00:44] believe a lot of times people today miss
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:49] it we we we we take these things and a
[1:00:52] lot of times we look at them literal but
[1:00:55] that there was a spirit application
[1:00:57] there yes sir yes sir that the people
[1:01:00] couldn't understand
[1:01:04] right and he closed the
[1:01:07] book and gave it back to the to the
[1:01:11] priest so the book was
[1:01:13] closed he opened the
[1:01:16] book then closed it again cuz it wasn't
[1:01:20] time for the book to remain open there
[1:01:23] had to be some things take place yes sir
[1:01:26] true
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:36] amen I want to read another a little
[1:01:39] passage of scripture
[1:01:44] here amen John
[1:01:47] 21 says after these things Jesus showed
[1:01:51] himself again to the disciples at the
[1:01:53] Sea of tiberias and on this wise he
[1:01:57] showed he
[1:02:01] himself there were to there were
[1:02:05] together Simon Peter Thomas called dimus
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:10] Nathaniel and Kaa in Galilee and the
[1:02:13] sons of
[1:02:15] Zebedee and two others of the disciples
[1:02:18] Simon Peter said unto them I go
[1:02:24] fishing they said unto him we also go
[1:02:27] with
[1:02:28] thee they went forth and entered into
[1:02:31] the ship
[1:02:33] immediately and that night they caught
[1:02:36] nothing I know how that
[1:02:39] feel but when the morning had come Jesus
[1:02:43] stood on the
[1:02:44] shore but the
[1:02:46] disciples knew not that it was
[1:02:52] Jesus Luke 24 starting at the 27th
[1:02:57] verse and beginning at Moses and all the
[1:03:00] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:03:03] the scriptures and uh things that
[1:03:06] concern
[1:03:09] himself and they drew nigh unto the
[1:03:11] village where where uh the village there
[1:03:14] went and he
[1:03:17] made as though he would have gone
[1:03:22] further but they constrained him saying
[1:03:26] abide with
[1:03:28] us for it is toward the evening time and
[1:03:33] the day is far
[1:03:35] spent it's toward the evening and the
[1:03:38] day is far spent right and he went in to
[1:03:41] T with them now I want to bring
[1:03:43] something out very important in this Pat
[1:03:45] of the scripture amen as he walked with
[1:03:48] them they constrained
[1:03:52] him they didn't just have haard the say
[1:03:56] it stay with us all right brother and
[1:03:58] let it just
[1:04:00] go come on they constrained him yes sir
[1:04:04] yes that's a strong word yeah
[1:04:08] they I stay with
[1:04:11] me pass me
[1:04:14] not oh gentle
[1:04:17] savior
[1:04:19] am don't stay I'm enjoying this
[1:04:26] Hall this conversation that we're having
[1:04:29] uh is blessing me stay for a while yes
[1:04:34] sir amen and they con straighten them
[1:04:37] they wouldn't take no for an answer
[1:04:39] that's right yes sir oh my
[1:04:43] Hallelujah are you constraining
[1:04:46] him to come
[1:04:48] in and abide with you yes Lord and it
[1:04:51] came to pass and he sat at meat with
[1:04:54] them and he took bread and blessed it
[1:04:57] and break it and gave it to
[1:05:00] them then their eyes was open Hallelujah
[1:05:03] and they knew him yes yes yes yes yes
[1:05:07] but first before they could get to this
[1:05:10] point they had to invite him in Lord
[1:05:14] have mercy hallah yes sir right amen
[1:05:18] they had to constrain
[1:05:21] him come and break bread with us
[1:05:26] now you see the the ones before time at
[1:05:28] one they knew him
[1:05:30] not oh my God but now because they as
[1:05:34] constrained him to come in abide with us
[1:05:40] their eyes was open
[1:05:43] Hall there are a lot of
[1:05:46] people they're not constraining
[1:05:49] it the doors
[1:05:52] closed but they got things to do that
[1:05:55] they they they they too busy oh
[1:05:58] my they're not desperate
[1:06:01] enough they're not constraining
[1:06:05] him come in and abide with me that I may
[1:06:10] know you
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:13] amen because see you can't understand
[1:06:16] the things of God Amen without having
[1:06:19] him on the
[1:06:24] inside now I could tell you but I want
[1:06:26] to read
[1:06:32] it the prophet said now man in his
[1:06:35] carnal
[1:06:36] condition and his mental
[1:06:39] conception he always pulls himself away
[1:06:42] from God it's been that time since the
[1:06:47] beginning see means to understand
[1:06:53] Jesus except the man be born
[1:06:56] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:03] God so man is bound in a
[1:07:07] prison behind their ecclesiastical
[1:07:13] walls and it's
[1:07:15] man he puts himself under
[1:07:20] bondage under his through his traditions
[1:07:25] and that has been since the world began
[1:07:29] and he is shut up in a prison
[1:07:34] house amen bear with
[1:07:42] me amen so we
[1:07:44] see man cannot understand
[1:07:48] god without the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:50] Ghost
[1:07:56] in the message indictment the prophet
[1:07:59] said I'm not indicting the
[1:08:03] sinner he said I indict this bunch of
[1:08:08] clergy he said I indict this
[1:08:11] generation for crucifying the Lord
[1:08:15] again Jesus now that's in our day but we
[1:08:19] know back that 2,000 years ago the same
[1:08:22] thing happened yes sir
[1:08:25] They Crucified our
[1:08:27] Lord now there was a there's there was a
[1:08:30] a a
[1:08:31] pre H uh crucifixion
[1:08:37] Ministry which which which which which
[1:08:39] would fall under the first pool and the
[1:08:43] second pool it drew big
[1:08:46] crowds it drew big crowds and the people
[1:08:49] followed him and they was just all so
[1:08:51] happy with
[1:08:54] him amen
[1:08:56] but once it went it began to the the
[1:09:00] ministry begin to
[1:09:02] change to the opening of the
[1:09:05] word see he had to be
[1:09:10] crucified he had to be the first wave
[1:09:13] sheath yes sir amen amen he had to have
[1:09:17] the first resurrection Amen in other
[1:09:20] words it was the
[1:09:24] inoculation amen it was the medicine
[1:09:26] that was needed to take us out of of the
[1:09:29] bondage that we were in that's right
[1:09:31] amen amen but
[1:09:34] see like any good
[1:09:36] pharmacist yeah amen because sometime
[1:09:39] medicine is mixed with a little bit of
[1:09:42] good and a little bit of
[1:09:44] poison see because it has to kill
[1:09:48] something and and feed another all right
[1:09:52] so it's it's a balance a balance said we
[1:09:55] got brother brother Quake who back there
[1:09:57] he's a pharmacist so you depending on
[1:10:01] the person some of the things that
[1:10:03] they're already have the condition that
[1:10:04] they're already in the weight things
[1:10:07] like that it has to be tweaked for the
[1:10:10] individual
[1:10:13] sir a little bit wrong way you can kill
[1:10:16] a
[1:10:18] man but if it's just
[1:10:21] right it'll bring healing to your soul
[1:10:26] amen amen but Jesus was so
[1:10:30] confident he took his first inoculate he
[1:10:34] was the first taker of the medicine all
[1:10:37] right he said I'll take it
[1:10:40] first amen and he
[1:10:44] did he
[1:10:46] crucified laid on hung out on the
[1:10:49] cross
[1:10:51] amen and was
[1:10:54] resurrected M
[1:10:57] amen so we
[1:10:59] see amen I want you to
[1:11:02] imagine this man
[1:11:05] Barabas who amen was a
[1:11:09] radical amen probably put together some
[1:11:12] of the first
[1:11:15] protests on on and feel like through he
[1:11:19] was going to change things through
[1:11:22] carnal means
[1:11:25] so they sharpen
[1:11:27] swords to go on the
[1:11:30] offense to
[1:11:32] fight and I was looking at it I think
[1:11:35] they said he killed a centurion
[1:11:37] Soldier he was a
[1:11:40] murderer and he was found
[1:11:44] guilty amen yes sir they locked him up
[1:11:48] in
[1:11:49] prison they took him
[1:11:52] down in Chains of bondage
[1:11:57] but as OB Barabbas was sitting there
[1:11:59] behind the Prison Walls waiting on his
[1:12:04] execution one day he hear the soldiers
[1:12:08] come chains
[1:12:11] rattling dragging their Spears on the
[1:12:15] ground he knew that this is
[1:12:19] it fear begin to grip him I'm sure at
[1:12:23] that time over rabs begin to think on
[1:12:25] his
[1:12:26] ways
[1:12:28] sir maybe said at that point I would
[1:12:30] have done things
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:34] different so they open the jail
[1:12:37] bars open the door and read him his
[1:12:43] pardon oh the rabbit was stood there
[1:12:46] stunned wait a
[1:12:48] minute what's
[1:12:51] happening he say you're pardon you can
[1:12:54] go free
[1:12:57] and this man was
[1:13:00] guilty and he knew he was
[1:13:03] guilty said the people chose
[1:13:07] you and he said see that man hanging
[1:13:10] Yonder over there on that
[1:13:13] cross
[1:13:15] bloody
[1:13:19] beaten gobs of spit hanging from his
[1:13:23] face he took took your
[1:13:27] place my
[1:13:29] God he took your
[1:13:32] place and we walk around in bondage
[1:13:36] today oh but he took your
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:42] place he took your
[1:13:46] place the prophet was talking about amen
[1:13:50] through
[1:13:51] Traditions we're put in a prison house
[1:13:59] he said many times tradition shuts off
[1:14:03] the people people before God can ever
[1:14:06] have a chance to get to
[1:14:08] them and reveal himself to
[1:14:15] them now the prophet said now a man is
[1:14:18] in a prison God said that a man was a
[1:14:24] prisoner so until
[1:14:26] something has happened to that
[1:14:32] man that before the certain thing called
[1:14:36] the new birth ever
[1:14:38] happened was the man he cannot no ways
[1:14:42] understand or ever understand
[1:14:46] God or never have knowledge of
[1:14:50] God though the word speaks
[1:14:55] his mind can't comprehend
[1:14:58] it because it's a human
[1:15:02] mind he got to have the mind of
[1:15:07] God Amen so you have to be able to
[1:15:13] hear you have to be able to hear in
[1:15:15] order to
[1:15:18] understand many times we come to
[1:15:21] church and we we we we can't hear God
[1:15:25] because our ears our ears are
[1:15:28] closed what am I
[1:15:32] saying these ears are for
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] listening but your heart is for
[1:15:39] receiving yes sir yes
[1:15:42] sir no more than this microphone this
[1:15:45] microphone has no intelligence to
[1:15:48] it I can't think with my ears right true
[1:15:52] I can't see God with my ears
[1:15:56] I have to be able to take these things
[1:15:59] and as the god uses these things he's
[1:16:02] using his mic to amplify my voice but
[1:16:05] the words are coming from my
[1:16:07] heart the words are coming from the word
[1:16:10] of
[1:16:11] God Amen and it has to keep going
[1:16:15] through these different faculties in
[1:16:17] from my mouth to your ears and down into
[1:16:20] your heart before it's
[1:16:23] real exactly amen
[1:16:26] yes it has to be decoded and put back
[1:16:30] together in your heart then you can say
[1:16:36] Amen so the listing you're trying to
[1:16:39] receive it in your
[1:16:42] heart but without the Holy Ghost you you
[1:16:46] can't even receive it in your heart like
[1:16:48] I say you come to come to
[1:16:51] church and you hear the preacher say
[1:16:54] certain things
[1:16:55] and you're looking at the
[1:16:57] man and there all of these things that
[1:17:01] are are hindering you from receiving it
[1:17:04] in your
[1:17:07] heart see the devil will come between
[1:17:10] the time it leaves my
[1:17:13] mouth and go through all of these things
[1:17:15] sometime it gets distorted that's
[1:17:19] right our sound Engineers can attest to
[1:17:22] that that if everything is not connected
[1:17:25] just right that sound will be distorted
[1:17:27] and you can't receive the
[1:17:30] message amen the Devil is a distorter of
[1:17:35] sound yes he
[1:17:37] is before it ever gets to your heart
[1:17:40] he's trying to distort it why how
[1:17:43] through something that happened you come
[1:17:45] maybe a little upset he's trying to
[1:17:47] distort the S right
[1:17:50] on and keep it from getting into your
[1:17:53] heart M amen all wounds that you may be
[1:17:58] carrying amen amen it's kind of like a
[1:18:01] cord that's pitched amen that would
[1:18:04] distort the message from getting to your
[1:18:06] heart my God
[1:18:10] Amen things that may have happened
[1:18:12] throughout the week that's why you have
[1:18:15] to come to church pray
[1:18:18] up amen with your heart clear so that
[1:18:22] there's no Distortion amen right L and
[1:18:25] you can receive what God is
[1:18:30] saying so we see these
[1:18:33] men
[1:18:36] amen went into the
[1:18:38] house and spake with
[1:18:41] Jesus and upon that upon leaving they
[1:18:45] knew who he
[1:18:47] was I'm reminded on Mount
[1:18:52] Transfiguration when uh Elijah Moses
[1:18:55] Jesus
[1:18:57] appeared the first thing they wanted to
[1:18:59] do was make another
[1:19:02] denomination yeah but he they was he
[1:19:05] stopped
[1:19:06] them and said this is my beloved
[1:19:09] Son here ye him right now they only had
[1:19:13] one
[1:19:15] commandment was to
[1:19:17] hear yes sir oh my that's the only thing
[1:19:20] they were commanded to do is to
[1:19:23] hear but let me REM mind you you can't
[1:19:25] hear amen if there's a cord
[1:19:31] disconnected you can't hear if there's
[1:19:34] nothing amen something that's cutting
[1:19:36] off the path come on Amen you can't hear
[1:19:41] neither can you
[1:19:43] understand in this hour the things of
[1:19:46] God that's
[1:19:49] true he wants you to be with those with
[1:19:53] that crying group
[1:19:56] oh but unless you can understand and
[1:19:59] hear the voice of
[1:20:02] God there'll be no
[1:20:06] change now there's many
[1:20:08] voices there's a loud voice of
[1:20:12] politics in the
[1:20:16] land that's why he said I indict the
[1:20:20] clergy of this
[1:20:22] day because they are putting people in
[1:20:29] bondage they're clogging up the channel
[1:20:32] yes sir amen and the people don't know
[1:20:34] what to
[1:20:37] believe and the problem is it's anointed
[1:20:41] yes
[1:20:42] sir it's
[1:20:45] anointed and it sounds
[1:20:49] good but it's like two microphones
[1:20:52] speaking at the same time you can't make
[1:20:54] out nothing
[1:20:58] you can't hear the voice of God because
[1:21:00] you're trying to decipher which one do I
[1:21:02] hear I can't hear I hear them
[1:21:04] both and it's
[1:21:09] confusing and God is not the author of
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] confusion but you have to come with your
[1:21:17] ears
[1:21:20] open God is speaking in this hour
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:25] and he wants you to know him
[1:21:30] amen but there's too many
[1:21:35] voices
[1:21:39] amen he say they deny his
[1:21:43] word amen they deny his power they deny
[1:21:48] his
[1:21:51] Creeds amen and and take amen a
[1:21:56] intellectual
[1:21:59] conception remember Eve was no longer
[1:22:02] fortified behind the
[1:22:04] word the pure
[1:22:07] word there was no
[1:22:10] Distortion but she got from behind it
[1:22:14] and listen to the devil's lie right amen
[1:22:18] and caus all of the trouble that we're
[1:22:20] in today that's
[1:22:22] right amen cause all the weep and I I I
[1:22:26] no doubt that the first weep amen is
[1:22:30] when Adam and and and and and and Eve
[1:22:32] realized they lost a
[1:22:36] child there was
[1:22:39] weeping but before that there was no
[1:22:41] weeping didn't even know nothing about
[1:22:44] cry there was no
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:47] hurt every day was joyous and happy yes
[1:22:52] sir but God is going going to wipe all
[1:22:55] the tears
[1:22:57] away and I don't believe sometime when
[1:23:00] you hear things like that I say when
[1:23:01] time heals all things this is going to
[1:23:03] be an eternal
[1:23:07] wiping there'll be no more hurt no sir
[1:23:10] my God there'll be no more
[1:23:14] pain but you have to be able to hear him
[1:23:19] amen amen
[1:23:28] the prophet said
[1:23:30] here why are we so tsed about
[1:23:34] 81 now you truly have two different
[1:23:37] mental
[1:23:38] faculties you have one of them that's in
[1:23:42] your
[1:23:43] head by your brain and the other one is
[1:23:47] operated in your heart which is called
[1:23:51] your
[1:23:52] soul your spirit
[1:23:55] and your soul now they are very much in
[1:24:00] disagreement many times when the head
[1:24:03] seems to say something the soul wonders
[1:24:07] at
[1:24:08] it if it's not right but when it comes
[1:24:12] to the soul the head seem to take a step
[1:24:18] back
[1:24:20] amen so you have to be able to hear
[1:24:24] amen with your heart yes
[1:24:27] sir word says He that has an
[1:24:31] ear my word and believeth on him that
[1:24:34] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[1:24:38] not come into condemnation but pass from
[1:24:42] Death unto life he that
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:49] heareth
[1:24:52] amen hear my he he that hears my word
[1:24:56] and believe Faith cometh by
[1:25:00] hearing and hearing the word of God now
[1:25:04] I'm not talking about hearing with your
[1:25:06] ears you got to get past that yes
[1:25:10] sir this is a for listening your eyes
[1:25:13] are for
[1:25:14] looking and not
[1:25:17] seeing your
[1:25:19] ears areer
[1:25:21] listening but not hearing right
[1:25:25] your
[1:25:26] heart this is where it's trying to get
[1:25:29] to not from your brain a lot of people
[1:25:31] think science feels that that that that
[1:25:34] the goes to your your eyes and into your
[1:25:37] brain and it kind of stops there no
[1:25:41] that's where the devil
[1:25:43] at that's
[1:25:46] right you take a mental conception but
[1:25:50] the control tower is in the heart yes
[1:25:52] sir
[1:25:55] Lord created in me a clean
[1:25:58] heart that I may know you in this
[1:26:04] hour
[1:26:06] so we have
[1:26:08] to amen
[1:26:11] uh I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:26:24] now we see that there's a post
[1:26:27] Resurrection
[1:26:29] Christ uh post-resurrection
[1:26:33] Ministry and uh let me read the
[1:26:35] scripture here and at the end of the
[1:26:37] Sabbath as it began I'm I'm sorry
[1:26:40] reading from Matthew 28 uh first chapter
[1:26:43] and at the end of the Sabbath it began
[1:26:44] to Dawn toward the first day of the week
[1:26:48] and Came Mary Magdalene and the other
[1:26:50] other Mary to see the sepulture
[1:26:55] and behold there was a great
[1:26:58] earthquake and the angel of the Lord
[1:27:00] descended from heaven and came and
[1:27:04] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[1:27:07] sat upon it his countenance was like
[1:27:10] lightning and his reignment white as
[1:27:14] snow and for fear of
[1:27:17] him the keepers did
[1:27:20] shape and became as dead men
[1:27:24] and the and the angel answered and said
[1:27:27] unto the
[1:27:28] women fear
[1:27:31] not for I know that you seek
[1:27:35] Jesus which is
[1:27:38] crucified he is not here for He Is
[1:27:42] Risen as he said come and see the place
[1:27:46] where the Lord
[1:27:52] lay amen he had risen
[1:27:54] I want to go on to uh same message why
[1:27:57] we so talked about amen
[1:28:04] uh I'm not sure which paragraph it is
[1:28:08] start out with uh then he taken
[1:28:12] me uh from
[1:28:15] there the prophet was talking about the
[1:28:18] vision that he
[1:28:21] had said he taken me from there and I
[1:28:24] seen a great huge
[1:28:27] tent I never seen such a
[1:28:30] tent and it was packed and lined
[1:28:32] everywhere with
[1:28:34] people and I walked out and looked like
[1:28:38] I was standing above the people looking
[1:28:42] down and I just made an altar call and
[1:28:45] hundreds of uh people were
[1:28:48] weeping and
[1:28:51] rejoicing after they had accepted the
[1:28:53] Lord Jesus as their
[1:28:56] Savior and I looked and then heard a man
[1:29:01] get up saying call the prayer line and
[1:29:04] the people begin to line up on this side
[1:29:08] the left from where I was looking down
[1:29:11] toward the platform and they lined up
[1:29:14] the way uh the way
[1:29:16] up down the street for a prayer
[1:29:21] line now notice the vision was
[1:29:23] portraying him as a healing campaign and
[1:29:27] the great tent meeting amen was going on
[1:29:31] Amen so I noticed to my left which would
[1:29:34] have been to to the left which would
[1:29:36] have been my right if I was on the
[1:29:39] platform a wooden building and I seen
[1:29:44] that
[1:29:46] light that all they have the picture of
[1:29:51] you know uh that's always in the
[1:29:54] meetings and I seen that like leave me
[1:29:58] and go into that building and go into
[1:30:01] the building and a voice said to me I'll
[1:30:04] meet you in
[1:30:08] there that'll be the third
[1:30:12] pull and mean now we know that the third
[1:30:15] pull was the opening of the word which
[1:30:18] of course is the highest order of a
[1:30:21] prophet I said why
[1:30:24] he said well it won't be a public
[1:30:30] show and I came
[1:30:34] too amen so it won't be a public show in
[1:30:38] this
[1:30:39] hour
[1:30:41] amen it has to be a
[1:30:45] personal relationship between you and
[1:30:50] God it has to be personal it has to you
[1:30:54] have to go into that
[1:30:57] building amen it has to come into you
[1:31:01] right right enter that secret chamber
[1:31:05] right sir amen for you to be able to
[1:31:08] understand what's going on in this
[1:31:11] house
[1:31:12] amen into that chamber of your heart you
[1:31:16] must receive him he's knocking at the
[1:31:20] door in order to understand and this how
[1:31:24] where we're at and where we're going you
[1:31:26] must have an open
[1:31:28] door you must receive him into your
[1:31:31] heart amen he says I'll meet you in
[1:31:37] there amen bear with
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:42] me so we
[1:31:45] see we must go beyond the
[1:31:49] camp amen
[1:31:55] amen bear with me
[1:31:58] here amen you
[1:32:02] must constrain
[1:32:04] him to come in and dwell with you you
[1:32:08] must constrain him Amen to come in and
[1:32:12] be your
[1:32:15] gu Amen to be able to understand the
[1:32:18] things of God in this hour other than
[1:32:21] that you're just presuming yeah amen
[1:32:24] you're just guessing and every time amen
[1:32:27] something happens amen you're up and
[1:32:29] you're down and you're up and you're
[1:32:31] down why because you're trying to to
[1:32:34] live this life up under a mental
[1:32:37] conception amen it's much like the
[1:32:39] children of Israel amen when they had
[1:32:42] left Egypt amen and they was in the
[1:32:45] wilderness amen and and and God Reign
[1:32:48] spiritual food in due season amen but if
[1:32:52] they didn't get there early enough
[1:32:53] enough amen it it it dried up amen and

[1:39:54] and at that time yes uh in Phoenix
[1:39:57] 1965 amen he preached that
[1:40:01] message Millions on
[1:40:03] earth look Millions on Earth that didn't
[1:40:06] receive it when Jesus was
[1:40:09] here but how thankful that we should be
[1:40:12] this
[1:40:13] morning to know that we have the direct
[1:40:17] evidence and the Bible proofs that we
[1:40:21] are included in the great Resurrection
[1:40:25] morning that's uh a morning coming
[1:40:29] not that great
[1:40:31] Easter we have the earnest of it right
[1:40:35] now and in our mortal
[1:40:38] bodies the predestinated ones are first
[1:40:42] of course to be
[1:40:44] quickened when the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:40:47] claim its own amen later on in there he
[1:40:51] says that you knew that the message was
[1:40:55] turning amen things were going to be
[1:40:58] different amen it was no longer a public
[1:41:02] show amen but it was for the bride yes
[1:41:05] sir amen but you have to go in amen
[1:41:08] behind the
[1:41:10] veil he said I'll meet you in there and
[1:41:14] in there I'll I'll reveal to you amen
[1:41:18] the secret things I'll show you who I am
[1:41:22] amen you dwell in the presence of
[1:41:24] almighty God yes sir
[1:41:27] amen and he'll wipe away all of the
[1:41:31] tears from your eyes and give you amen a
[1:41:35] a new a new song
[1:41:39] Amen but we see amen that there's going
[1:41:43] to be
[1:41:44] weeping there going to be wailing amen
[1:41:48] but for that group amen that went beyond
[1:41:50] the veil amen he's going to wipe away
[1:41:54] all your tears there'll be no more
[1:41:57] weeping amen but you must go Beyond the
[1:42:01] Veil you must press you must constrain
[1:42:04] him to come in and abide amen what in
[1:42:09] Easter amen the resurrection amen there
[1:42:13] was a resurrection 2,000 years ago amen
[1:42:16] but you see that today amen when the
[1:42:19] word of God was being revealed again the
[1:42:22] same thing was happening yes sir amen
[1:42:25] there was a there was a first and second
[1:42:27] pull of the prophet's
[1:42:30] Ministry amen but when amen it came to
[1:42:33] the revealing of the word people pulled
[1:42:35] away
[1:42:38] right true the same thing that's why he
[1:42:41] had to indict this generation yes sir he
[1:42:44] said for crucifying the word aresh
[1:42:49] right
[1:42:50] amen but there was a a group of people
[1:42:55] 2,000 years ago that re he revealed
[1:42:57] himself to I'm not dead but I've
[1:43:02] risen walking among the
[1:43:05] people amen and the same thing is
[1:43:07] happening today anden the word is being
[1:43:10] revealed and our God lives our god
[1:43:15] reigns but if you're not careful the
[1:43:17] devil will get in and to start the
[1:43:19] message
[1:43:24] and you won't be able to receive it the
[1:43:26] most important thing right now amen is
[1:43:29] to have the the the the God on the
[1:43:33] inside so that he could a amen uh
[1:43:36] rightly divide the word of
[1:43:39] Truth you can't understand it until then
[1:43:43] right because you without the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] your mental conception is nothing to
[1:43:51] God nothing to God you can't understand
[1:43:55] his
[1:43:56] ways well why can't I do this why can't
[1:44:00] I wear short pants and why can't I B my

[1:44:14] morning he came to deliver and set the
[1:44:16] captives free amen amen amen and only
[1:44:19] the word of God is going to be able to
[1:44:21] set you free amen
[1:44:24] I'm not talking about just the caral
[1:44:25] conception that I'm talking about the
[1:44:27] pure and adulterated word of

[1:44:47] act right how to
[1:44:50] dress how to carry yourself right come
[1:44:57] on to deliver you from the bondage what

[2:00:34] hallelujah
[2:00:35] amen what a
[2:00:38] sermon praise the
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:45] Lord as our brother was preaching I
[2:00:47] couldn't help but think of the story The
[2:00:49] Prophet was talking about when cut down
[2:00:52] a a tree and that log lays there it can
[2:00:57] lay there for a while and finally it'll
[2:00:58] begin to
[2:01:00] rot but sometimes you can cut the very
[2:01:03] same tree down it'll fall in the
[2:01:06] water where the spirit is moving and the
[2:01:08] word is going forth that very same tree
[2:01:12] that was going to rot eventually will
[2:01:14] rot twice as
[2:01:16] fast so when you come into the presence
[2:01:19] of the
[2:01:20] Lord You must enter in you can't just be
[2:01:23] a hearer of the word you must be a doer
[2:01:25] of the word you must be a lier of the
[2:01:27] word you can't compromise with your
[2:01:31] life there's nothing on this Earth worth
[2:01:34] going to hell
[2:01:36] for if I had to make decisions between
[2:01:39] wearing shorts and going to heaven I'll
[2:01:42] choose Heaven every
[2:01:44] time for for a sister wearing makeup or
[2:01:47] going to heaven or cutting your hair out
[2:01:49] or brothers having long hair it's not
[2:01:52] worth going hell over give that stuff up
[2:01:56] smoking cigarettes drinking running
[2:01:58] around it's not worth going to hell over
[2:02:01] that's only for a
[2:02:03] moment when that moment is
[2:02:07] done I don't know how long you'll be in
[2:02:09] a burning fire but you're going to be
[2:02:10] there it's not worth it but why not come
[2:02:14] to the Lord get to know him have peace
[2:02:18] when you lie
[2:02:19] down when you're going through you got
[2:02:21] peace peace because Jesus is right there
[2:02:25] inside that control to amen let's give
[2:02:28] the Lord another hand clap for using
