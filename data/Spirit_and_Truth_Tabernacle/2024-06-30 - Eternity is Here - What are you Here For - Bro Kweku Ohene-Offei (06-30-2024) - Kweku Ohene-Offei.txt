that has started here in our area um the uh pastor's brother Jude Charles he has come here a couple times visiting with a a few Saints but they just started a a work I heard that it started really a year ago but they just had like some in inauguration Services over the weekend and um and I went by just to kind of pay greetings to them and and I I told them and said well since I was born here in in West Palm this just feel like my home it is my home say I want to come as a neighbor and uh welcome you to the neigh neighborhood man and and and the other thing I mentioned uh to them I was telling my wife we were I was driving down the street um uh I guess Thursday and I was looking there was a building being erected um in Adam Royal Palm and as I was looking at the building I said man that looked like that could be a Chick-fil-A you know but they didn't got they don't have no signs up as to what the building's going to be I said that looked like it could be a Chick-fil-A and then I said to myself well that's a little close to the Chick-fil-A down the street and uh as me and her began to talk said you know what Chick-fil-A could put another Chick-fil-A right next do to it and both of them would be full say if Chick-fil-A can do that why can't the bride of Christ do that amen amen and both of them be full amen all right so we just thank God Amen for what he's doing and and

they come from and uh just how the Lord's been raising them up and and using them for his his work uh I'm very appreciative amen God God God bless you praise the Lord amen amen uh can I kind of remind me of my my kids amen they um um playing for each other and and all that just y'all got yourself a little ban appreciate them so much amen thank god um before we would uh enter into the word of the Lord on today I wanted to just uh take a moment to uh uh just read a scripture and then also we we voted at the beginning of the year for um a deacon amen uh and brother Simba had received a uh a vote to be Deacon here in our church and I'm I'm grateful amen uh that the numbers are adding uh and we've had brother Troy for uh some time and and uh brother Simba you know decided to take the uh responsibility we brought it before the church and um and he was voted on but we uh wanted to just do an official ordination amen of uh brother Simba on today and I wanted to just kind of read the scripture relating to what was done out of 1 Timothy chapter 3 amen 1 Timothy Chapter 3 The Desire um here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle so everyone's aware is that uh the Lord will bless us with uh four deacons and four trustees uh uh that's what the brandom Tabernacle had and I said well that's and brother brandom say he had two on each door and uh and him and the assistant pastor was watching the back door uh but with that's our desire and just to see the Lord just um slowly but surely um providing you know all the different people in their different positions uh we're grateful for that and and it's not just you know just trying to put people in a spot but we want to make sure that they have a calling for that area otherwise if they don't have a calling for that area then um it just becomes a problem amen so we're not just shuffling people in positions but uh you know the character has to be watched and brother brother brother Simba has been with us for a while amen him him and his precious wife and and we've had the opportunity just really watch both of their characters because we realize when God calls a man he also calls his wife and typically he uh gives the wife certain characteristics that just kind of go right along with with the what the where the husband's already is and it just it it it you can see it just flows amen it's not something that we have to make happen and I know that um you know we we saw these things in brother Simba a long time ago but we had to wait for the Lord Lord to to do to do this amen uh in his own good time and and and and and um even from last year when we preached the theme of yielding to the perfect will of God uh at the beginning of the Year brother Simba say well brother we going to yield to the perfect will of God and we'll see whether this is this his will for us to do this we'll put it up to the church for the vote and let the church decide and if the church decides then we'll know it's the will of God and um he hadn't said this but I re recognized something after you all voted and um and they yield it uh there was some paperwork they had been waiting on and it had been released after the [Music] vote it was some very specific things that they were waiting on and I watched that right after the vote after they yielded and after you all voted it was released Lord amen hallelujah amen so so I I just believe God has uh ordained this amen and um and as a church we just keep moving forward uh with what God is doing in our midst so let's let me just read amen out of 1 Timothy uh chapter 3 and uh I want to read verse uh 8 starting at verse 8 and um when I finish reading this there is a Word document that I I want to bring up it's called spirit and Truth Tabernacle offices you'll see it it'll soon as you go to word it'll already be at the very top so just pull that up for me um here in verse 8 it says likewise must the deacons be grave uh and and this means be honest amen be honest uh not double tongue not giv to much wine not greedy or filthy looker uh holding the mystery of the faith in pure conscience uh and let these also first be proved so this particular portion of the verse is why we uh we do the vote and then we give a few months of proving and uh and then we we do the ordination so every Deacon that will have um they they will have to be proven uh because that's what the scripture says okay so uh it says let them also first be proved uh then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless uh even so must their wives be grave or honest right not slanderers um they they they the wives can be in everything you understand your name coming up in everything you in this situation you in that situation no you can't do that as a Deacon's wife right sometime you have to just learn to hush and and just say thing you're going to get information but you can't say nothing or it can only be given to certain people like the pastor right but you can't be taking that all over the church amen a Deacon's wife cannot be a slanderer okay uh it it says this um so so the thing of it is when you're watching people like this you watch you watch things from way back you know I mean you look years back and sister Ruth we ain't never heard her name coming up in nothing amen ain't never heard her name coming up in nothing right you can see God was working on both of these people okay he says this um wise beg grave not slanderous sober and this is the key faithful in all things and and I know that they have a young family and they they will be challenged in some things and that's why we that's why brother Troy was doing everything he can to try to get help around some of our young families amen we want to succeed we really want to succeed right so so we got to help one another we're connected to one another amen praise the Lord but here you know the scripture says faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well just just with that alone uh we realize that if a Brother's been married twice and if it if his and his other wife is still living he can't be a deacon in a church there's other roles he can he can play but he can't a deacon in the church so and if a man is single not married he can't be a deacon in the church praise the Lord there's other roles he can play but it can't be a deacon in the church sometime you that brother right there he ain't married don't that's not none pray for him to get married amen then God can take him to the next level amen all right um it says the Bible says this um let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children in their own houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and a great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus I want to just read this um uh brother brandom laid out the offices of the church so that you understand what the office of the deacon does here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle um I don't want the deacons to be figureheads what I mean by that is just holding a title but not doing uh anything with the job and there's churches where you the Deacon that's just a that's just a figurehead but we we want to we want our deacons to be empowered to do exactly what the prophet said that they should do and here and when they laid this out at at brandom Tabernacle I kind of took that and just scroll down to where it says the office of Deacons I took that and just uh made it here for spirit and Truth Tabernacle it says the office of deacons as elected according to the word of God and again the church has to vote on the office of a deacon uh as elected according to the word of God and the manner of spirit and Truth Tabernacle is to act as an office of spiritual assistance to the pastors so uh understand that when spiritual things are happening in the church uh I have to go to those deacons and talk to them about those things and spiritual things they may know about they'll come to me and talk about but we all spiritual matters we have to kind of work uh together on all right so uh uh act as an office of spiritual assistance to the pastors they are to assist the pastors on all of his spiritual activities they're giving free speech and presenting to the pastors any program or benefits that would bless the general spiritual welfare of the church now I've seen churches where uh the pastor wants to be the only one making decision he don't want anybody to speak into that here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle I want the deacons to be able to speak into things and together we come up with a a solution but uh they have the free speech to be able to bring uh things and present it to me uh like even right now you all might not have known this but uh even the way that we've been doing uh communion the deacons have been behind a lot of that and and talking about how we probably should do that amen uh I've been like let's do it every month like brother wait brother let's we might have to worry about we got to worry about this got to worry about that they speak into it you know what I do humble myself amen and if I can humble myself to the deacons guess what I expect the rest of the church to do humble yourself amen hello somebody amen all right uh so here it says um uh they're given free speech and presented to the Pastors in the program of benefits that would bless the general and spiritual welfare of the church they must be apt to teach now this is very very important to me brother Brandon put that there now the scripture doesn't specifically say it like that it says the bishop must be apt to teach and the bishop is none other than the local Pastor in the church but uh but but brother brandham added this that they must be apt to teach so uh here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle our deacons you will hear from them periodically that's why you hear from Brother Troy all right uh because this is a part of their responsibility they got to be able to stand up here and deliver the word of God something happened to the pastor the Deacon should be able to kind of car help carry the church on so I I got to make sure they train properly I got to give them opportunities to stand here behind the pull pit all of that got to be done yeah it's not an um it's this is not an easy job trying to spread this out amongst all the ministers it ain't easy and then and then then have enough time for me to kind of get my thoughts out there too right but we have to do these things and God will give us wisdom amen uh as we go in order to be able to get every gift used but it says here they must be apt to teach ready to assist a pastor or associate pastor on every Duty we have called to do so they shall assist in sering communion they shall be acting ushers in all services they shall police the church in keeping civil order and conduct they shall assist in taking local offerings and um they shall oversee the spiritual conduct of the church and working with the pastor and one another on spiritual problems and matters of the Saints there they shall be ready at any time to assist the need of every saint who is burdened and in need of spiritual consultation so um right there is that if there's a specific need spiritually that somebody's dealing with you have every right to contact your Deacon you have every right to contact your Deacon the same way you contact the pastor you can call the Deacon and talk things over with them and get a word of prayer from the Deacon yes sir amen right so um this this is this is what we're doing is sharing the responsibility it don't all fall on brother Jack's shoulders we are a mature church I want to just say it like that so there was a time where everything fell on my shoulders but no we need to kind of start moving some of those things off we got our deacons here and then what you don't want to do is try to create this thing where I got my favorite Deacon so I only go to this one Deacon no don't do that we got deacons so use them equally sir all right Church all right so here uh it says uh the saint who is burdened and in need of spiritual consultation or general welfare so if somebody have a very specific need you know I I I I need a bill paid I need this I need that go to to the deacons Amen Let the deacons kind of sort through that right cuz we've had people come I remember one time a sister came here and my she was getting ready to run through the church with all her needs she was getting ready to she was getting ready to kind of take everybody out and nobody knew what was going to happen but I had already called and I I got her name from other people and they told me she did this in our church she did this in our church she did I say she ain't going to nobody house to stay at nobody house not here and uh so you know and she didn't have no room for a hotel we got a van here sis that you can stay in amen I had to do it like that because I knew she was trying to plant seeds amongst the Saints and she going to give a a nice SB story Saints every sob story ain't true so we got people here that can listen to the story and then the deacons will listen to it and they get a little something they'll come they'll come and they'll okay this is what I heard so then we'll work that thing out praise the Lord but we here to protect the church amen we're here to protect the church that's that's our job so uh and and the and the the more we grow the more s stories all right amen don't don't we ain't crazy y'all amen but but these are the things so we we watch everything why they connecting to this what what is going on here all right amen okay so um here the the prophet says they shall be ready at any time to assist the need of every saint who is burden in need of spiritual consultation on General Welfare they have not the right to act upon any program of promotion without agreement with one another right the pastors or the trustees if the program they're considering doing involves Church funds so if if funds are involved then it has to go through the trustees and the trustees have to speak into that amen even I take my financial decisions through the trustees praise the Lord amen uh they will be responsible for God for their conduct and manner of service according to the word of God and here the prophet says they shall not have meetings among themselves with without the pastor or associate pastor present amen so this just keeps amen everybody honest amen if somebody get to the Deacon we got to get rid of the pastor we just got to get rid of the pastor can't y'all have a meeting to get rid of the pastor meet with the pastor well they going to have a meeting with me to tell me that you said they trying to get rid of you all right that's so we we don't do things that way we we keep it all honest amen and that that God Amen could just be glorified in everything that we do so brother Simba we want to invite him to come up and we just want to lay hands on him amen and and pray uh over him uh we just thank God for our precious brother um and uh just just all that he has done here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle uh I would say that this man has been an asset he uh not not not a liability but he's been an asset since the very first day he walked through these doors and uh you know I I met him through email um years ago he reached out to me and he says um uh he had never been there at West Palm Beach and he and he and he reached out to me and says I I see you have been to my home country and I said yeah he said I was just you know just wanting to kind of get to know you and fellowship with you a little bit and and uh and we would just go back and forth and and email and then I invited him to uh one of the meetings at brother Westco that he had he came to that meeting and uh and he left the meeting with uh a desire to relocate uh to West Palm Beach and in his company when he relocated here in his company he was the before covid he was the first person person uh in the company to be able to work remotely and the reason that he told the people that he wanted to come to West Palm Beach was that he said there's a church there that I'm connected to and he says my wife my wife to be is going to be moving there and I want to be there with my wife so when they heard him say there's a church there they say hey there a church you want to go to in West pal Beach they said we got to make a reasonable accommodation oh my for you to go to church good amen so that's what actually brought him here to West Palm Beach right and uh and like I say since he's been here has been an asset and we thank God for brother Simba M andami let us have a word of prayer amen over our precious brother father we thank you for this day Lord this time uh that we get an opportunity to ordain our brother Lord as a Deacon here in spirit and Truth Tabernacle God it's been a journey and we've watched your hand your Mighty hand move uh through every step of this journey as he and his precious wife have come to this place to surrender uh to this call and to be used by you Lord uh in this assembly we thank you that they've yielded to the call right here and God we ask that you would just use them for your glory and for your honor God we know that you are the one that ordained him before we did you called him to this place and father even the people have recognized that through their vote so Lord we trust that as he joins uh with brother Troy and they become uh United as a team that God they would be the eyes amen and the policemen Lord of this church and God that they would just be um Lord that they would be excellent uh in the work that they perform uh for the Saints Lord we just trust oh God that you would get the glory out of their lives and father we just honor you as you honor him Lord and and his wife oh God in in this call we just trust oh God that you would get all the glory from from this decision Lord we praise you and we thank you and we ordain our brother because we see that you have called and we identify with the call that you've

him uh we thank God for brother Troy been holding it down and uh you can see amen that uh brother Troy just kind of move around and whatever the Lord need that's what he do um uh for some of the reason that he actually you know he's always been a a musician it's always been um used play bass guitar when he first came back um drums he get up here and cut loose in a song service and if you need him to preach he'll will he'll preach for you but um just grateful for the example that that that brother Troy is setting when when when he and I were younger we um we used to look at people like uh brother Capers and brother Stanley brother Coleman and and all those brothers and we used to just like man we one day it's going to be our turn and we going to have to we're going to have to step up and do what we have to do and um um and um you know just in watching them we realize that we had to be the example for the next generation and some of the things that we talk about because we're in our mid-50s and we know that the Lord Jesus uh promised according to scripture that he gives us three score and 10 and with giving us three score and 10 if that were to be true and that's all God gave us then that gives us about 15 14 15 years so we have to lay everything we can into the Next Generation and this is why we push so much right trying to get the the next group ready to go brother brother we need you and uh and and and and and I mean God called you here for a purpose so I'm glad to see these young men kind of stepping into their RADS and doing what the Lord is calling to do but

simple scripture that goes like gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice father bless your word into our hearts in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you and take your seat and we want to talk on a a theme or the title eternity is here what are you here for and I'll repeat it eternity is here what are you here for and that title was next uh during my last trip to Mexico uh when I was going I will tell you I'll give you the testimony I wanted to give a a slight PowerPoint but technology has not been good with these days my computer is almost 10 years old I can't even install uh Microsoft Office on it I got two brand new computers I bought on sales last year for to take to Ghana one for my niece one for my church in Ghana I turn them on they don't turn on so I need to get a new computer and I'm in the process of getting one so forgive me if I couldn't make slides today so I'm going to go purely old school brother I told myself quu John the Baptist didn't have PowerPoint slide he didn't have a laptop he didn't even have a a Bible to to preach from all right but they had Christ on the inside to inspire him to preach amen so we are not confined to technology computers and slides and PowerPoints the only confinement is the Lord Jesus Christ so we're going to go old school amen so I want to give a little testimony about a trip that I went to Mexico it was May 25th through May 28th I think it was Saturday the pastor invited me about probably 8 month ago it was one no sorry it was 53rd anniversary of the church so I was there last year after my graduation it was a wonderful time so he said brother H I'm going to invite you to be the main speaker so he informed me already pray about it we pray the Lord open the door everything so just I had something that I needed to do so I put it before the Lord Lord something personally if you accomplish this then I know you've made a way for the trip so the Lord provided everything was successful but then just before I didn't buy my ticket because of that just before then when I was about to buy the ticket uh I live I'm on the FL first floor the the the guest bathroom in my apartment begin to leak water coming from the second floor to my bathroom the guest bathroom I said no I can't leave this and I travel so H to me the long s Shir was back and forth back and forth for the ho is ho Association they want to take they don't want to give out so they push it on the person leaving on the second floor so it just took a it took a toll so I told the brother the pastor in fact it look it looks I'm not going to make it because I can't leave water draining I don't know what is going to happen so it need to be fixed or at least something to be done before I could leave and he sent a message back almost crying we communicate mainly through text message and and audio said brother I've invited people from around Peru Colombia different part of Mexico and uh I'm going to pray that the Lord will make a way for you to come and so he couldn't take no so we went and the the prizes were going through the roof it was moving from I think around 500 to 600 $ 800 now it's almost $1,000 so H the meetings were Friday Saturday Sunday and so I think the the apartment was going to be fixed the leaking was going to be fixed on Friday so I said brother it looks like the earliest are even com in Saturday and the next day the the meetings are going to be over so if you don't mind this year let's skip it and God will it next year so I sent an audio text message to him and I thought okay everything is over I went back home I was in town and I pray Lord what do you want me to preach put up on another servant's heart to preach so I just like wash my hand off it so I was there I was the kitchen when he called we don't usually do calling we do texting and audio so he called this I said brother if you come Saturday is perfect you can be here in the morning and you can preach Saturday and Sunday because we can let you go I said Lord whatever be your will so I just went to the computer took my laptop bought the ticket $1,000. 34 34 $1,000 $134 and said it's okay Jesus Christ gave his life to it so if it's your word for me to go you will take care cuz I said the end of the month is coming if your family don't visit you your bills will always visit you the bills will always come they don't slack brother but I said Lord whatever be your will let it be so I bought a ticket and then give the brother information that I'll be coming Saturday I'll arrive I'll have to go through Houston Texas and take another flight from Houston to verac Cruz so I'll get there by 11:30 and uh all is set so no problem so we went and I had to do preparation and I had only 3 hours to sleep and I said when am I going to sleep and when am I going to wake up so Lord you do it all the time so I'm going to listen to messages I'm not going to go to sleep and then a day before I couldn't really sleep that much because of different things so for 2 days and I said well if I fall asleep the angel of the Lord will wake me up so I'm not worried I listen to messages and I fell asleep and the Lord woke me up amen and I don't use I'm not an alarm person since high school it doesn't work for me when the AL larm Rings I'll just turn it off and go back to sleep so so I learn early I'm not a larm but thank God I have an angel of the Lord God has given you that will take care of everything and sometime we can go beyond the limitations of the Flesh and allow The Sovereign Lord to take over and he'll do what he does AM and he I don't worry when I go to sleep I go to sleep sometime as late as 4:00 a.m. and I wake up when I need to wake up so it does it doesn't matter so we went sometime I think brother Jack was talking about sometime you don't know what go behind the scene you only look at brother Jack brother Troy brother Smiley brother brother brother Jerry brother Quinton Jr brother quu and all the preachers coming to preach but what the scene you don't have an idea what goes on you only see the word coming but then they've made a covenant with the Lord to gather God's people so sometime they will put their own family they will sacrifice their family some people be preaching to you while their children are walking on the streets while their children are not in the Lord but they will preach for you to have eternal life and you got to pray you got to be thankful to the Lord and pray for them and know the sacrifice that they have sacrificed for you to hear the word of the Lord to bring you where you are amen amen so by God's grace I got there 11 around 11:30 they pick me up I couldn't even go to the hotel we just went to the the meeting is in the the where the ministers live they have a big acres of land their father the old Pastor bought for them so they build their houses around but then about 250 to 300 people so they have they build a tent and then they cook around the same place and they feed the people and they have meetings around and I learned something something that how they incorporate the the children in the services the case about let's say lind's age somewhere even 10 they were the one the parents the mothers who cook the food and then after the service they condemn the place Chang into a dining room and then the children were serving food they put on mask 12 years 14 15 and they were the one who were doing the serving wow and I said said what said is true he said if the kids are not young enough for the devil to use them then they are not too young enough for the Lord to use them so so the earier and I heard brother talking about the children theer we get them to to be in the things of the service of the Lord the better because they become parts and passs of their lives because if they don't do nothing sitting there just listen to the word they get to a place it's in them to do something and the friends and influences will get them to do something in the world that they are not supposed to do so I think it's high time we get them to do incorporate them in the in everything in music in everything that they can that they can learn from the scratch they know that they are part of Christ they are part of brother Jack Ministry just like he's not the only one it's just he's passing the Baton to them so even as children they can do the little things that they can do and that will keep them growing that I'm part of the church I can I can stram on the guitar I can I can play torine I can sing I can dance and their church choir is like three generation the pastors his children he has a triplet boys and one of them is the song leader and then their children the little ones they are part of the church choir so when they are singing the the first generation Second Generation and the little ones they were all part of the singing it's just I said God is good I've learned this this is great because children are part of the Jesus said that let the children come unto me for their angel their theophanies see the face of my father and so the children are part of the services of the Lord amen Glory Hallelujah we thank the Lord so I when I went I didn't have a sermon sometime the Lord has taught me that so I don't worry when I don't have a sermon before going sometime the sermon is waiting for you where you going to preach so I went I didn't have a the pastor asked me do you want to preach Saturday I said I think I'll do Sunday cuz I'm just worn out two days I haven't had sleep so I need to kind of kind of I mean uh get my strength back and then we can do Sunday so Saturday one brother was preaching from Colombia and as he was preaching that's where the title uh eternity is here what are you here for and I was just looking and just came just like that and I told one Pastor from Cancun I said brother brother John I've got my seron now I believe I've got what I'm going to preach tomorrow so we preach just I don't have the pictures to show you but I'll just just describe it as much as I can we preach I preach uh the Sunday morning and I preach on the title that I give it to you eternity is here what are you here for so I give the mic to some of the people like tell me brother Mark tell me what are you here for tell me what are you here for and everybody give their answer most of them and so God has got a purpose for your life am I'm not talking about just coming to church but your life on Earth eternity is here on Earth it is working around you but what are you here on Earth for church we spend like two at most 3 hours here but what are you here on this Earth for amen so after my testimony I'll go to that amen Glory Hallelujah and so we preach I just had one two scriptures Psalm 50:5 and Isaiah 2:2 Mountain on top of the mountain I talk about the Covenant the Lord made through the major Covenant we have in the Bible the law started from actually Adam because God gave condition to Adam that's right if you do this I'll do this if you don't do this so that was a covenant of law but then Moses was the one that was chosen to write it put it into writing and to establish it so the law ran through the Old Testament the law was like the male form the policeman that will arrest you for all the things that you do wrong right there was no Grace in the law amen but then the Lord would bring another attribute in the New Testament called Grace Grace is the mother the father and the mother amen and Grace and law combined you get the origin you get love love is the one that existed before the foundation of the world all those attributes in us but there's no law in eternity nobody does wrong in eternity nobody smokes drinks over speed to put a law there that you can't dream the Angels cannot fly at certain distance there not it doesn't exist right brother because there's no sin right there's no unbelief there's no doubt there's no Disobedience amen so those attribute of sorry Grace was in eternity but not it couldn't manifest in eternity cuz there's nobody to receive Grace theis don't need Grace they don't sin they don't even understand what is sin our civilization here is different from what is on the other side amen amen like faith we have to have faith to get things done Angels do not have to have faith it's just part of their life it's just like it's part of your life to be a human being to eat faith is just it's just all over so we have to go from our Dimension to deep into that dimension and bring the faith into manifestation but Angels don't have to have faith amen it's just part of their lives if an angel of the Lord a theop want to move from here to Canada he doesn't have to buy ticket be on the flight he just break himself down and he in Canada that's right if Angel of the Lord has to be in Russia the angel has to just by thought he's in Russia amen if he has to change himself into the shape of a sheep their bodies are just Eternal wow the clo they wear is not like our cloth that we pick from here angel of the Lord let's say brother brother Solomon sitting there his cloth is part of him amen his cloth is seamless it doesn't have crisis because it's part of his body and he can change the cloth into Jans into whatever form he can be he can change into into into pill of fire pill of smoke into rainbow into into whatever any form that the angel of the Lord the theop because it doesn't have the limitations of the flesh amen but then the same faith is for us and we have to reach out to grab that faith and to bring it into manifestation sir glory to the Lord Almighty so we talk about how Grace H came after the law yes sir and then that was from time of Jesus Jesus broke the grace remember how he gave the woman at the well he gave her grace H the woman the The Prostitute that he met at Simon's house he gave he gave her grace so he brought Grace and then the grace was an answer to the law but before Grace Grace is you've really done something wrong but Grace is being extended to you right you deserve to go to jail but then the judge is giving you Grace but then love sweeps away everything amen love is you live beyond law and Grace all right so Isaiah chapter 2 said there's a mountain in the last that will be established on top of the on on top of the mountain there's a higher Covenant that is beyond law the Old Testament and and Grace the New Testament That's The Testament the Lord broke it to William Braham to give it to you and I is a covenant of love amen love divine for you that you God bring you out of your condemnation and put you in a standard where things that you used to do is below you amen yes sir you don't go back to eat your vomit anymore that's right because the Lord has cleansed you from that vomit and you live that vomit life and then you live a life Sanctified holy life of Jesus Christ glory to the Lord Almighty amen so I preach and after that I give it some testimonies and how the trip went and after the brother said said brother do you know you preached for 3 hours I said I didn't have an idea I didn't know say you preached 3 hours the first one hour was when you talking about the trip how the Lord made the way all the obstacles but the second two hours were absolutely not you you were somebody else took over I could feel it I could see I saw myself diminishing wow when I enter the channel because the Brothers they pray they prayed and the expectations and I preach only one sermon wow I bought ticket traveled pay over $1,000 to preach one sermon Sunday morning 3 hours and then return I think on the Tuesday but after I preach One Pastor from Peru when I I said brother it looks like I know you but I don't really I'm not sure whether we are friends maybe in technology I don't know but you look very familiar maybe I saw you before the foundation of the world you look very familiar to me he said brother before I came I came for this trip there was a quat I've never seen it in in the message before the Lord open my eyes to it and probably I'll let us bring that quot if just for I'm not preaching on that but just to show you that when the Lord put something on your heart do it amen and I'll bring it to the seron that I'll preach I'm not going to keep you long but I want to just line some things up for us amen that the Lord has you here on this Earth for a purpose some of you are the only person the Lord has called in your family and reveal Jesus Christ in the form of William Brams may it to you amen there's nobody in your family that believe anything like you amen maybe somebody they are not even Christians but the Lord has made you a Christian and it's not easy for you but you are the light you are Jesus Christ to the rest of the family exactly right you are the first fruits the Lord is using to wave you in your family to bring the rest of them to Christ amen and that is the Eternal purpose God ordained you you could be a sister you could be a brother it doesn't matter it could be a youngster it could be an adult God has ordained you for that purpose and that is your Eternal purpose on this Earth and that's what you have to seek to do wow the will of the father amen yes sir I will okay I oh I think uh let's go to sorry sister uh let me give you it's uh let me give me one moment prise Lord hallelujah go to uh 6112 61-1 2 24 paragraph 34 yeah 6161 December 24th says we see Jesus and it's paragraph 34 amen so God has got a purpose the Pastor said brother I reached was talking about the three Testament of the Lord he said brother I've never seen that quote in the message but just before coming a couple of weeks I just ran into that quot and said what does it mean I don't have an idea and you just came from United States and preached under the three Covenant of the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah yes he said when I see what those men and women went through to went through with back there and see to maintain this same gospel and when they preach and when they preach he said men and women and said they preach so not only the men doesn't mean that women come to the puet no he's talking about preaching with your life amen we all preach with our lives men and women alike amen the F for ministri is for the men but then when it come to preaching with our life which is even greater than the great than standing here everybody preach with their life so he said what they went through to maintain this same gospel and when they preach uh this gospel the same thing that happened in the Old Testament New Testament and then it just exactly the same so that gives it one two three Witnesses every word is established the same God that that dealt with the old Prophet dealt with the apostles and dealt with the Prancing Brethren and here is here he is today dealing the same with his people with the same signs same wonders same gospel same power same God everything with three as a witness to us that this is the truth this is the truth God given it in three Testament see that is history and said let's go a little bit further said the Bible so God is deing with three Testament so your Testament we are Beyond first and New Testament and we're going to see here what the prophet said paragraph 36 said the Bible is the history of what God was see the history of the Old Testament the New Testament is the history of the New Testament amen so from Paul to to to seven Church ages the New Testament was history he said 308 said and then n and the nen Council and fathers and post nen council is the history of the church then and now history is making on just as it was which this history will never be written no is too close to the coming now and I think I'll probably uh leave it there amen so God has got three Testament the law Grace and love amen the Old Testament the New Testament is that is a history it's just history we are beyond the New Testament said said if God did it to pause people how much more us so you you are a higher Cen than Paul that's why Paul said that there are certain things that we see through glass dimly when I was a child I I spoke like a child but when he which is perfect is come everything will be unveiled and the Perfection came at the end of the seven Church ages where God sent a prophet to unveil the mind of God completely to us amen it's not about William Braham it's not about brother Jack it's not about quu it's about Christ and you personally amen it's not about what you read on the internet what somebody says about William Braham or Jesus Christ or message that is somebody's thinking but what has God revealed to you about the message of the hour amen have you received the Holy Ghost through this message I don't think you can leave this message if you have the Holy Ghost if God deals with you personally it's not a church coming right it's a calling personally to you that call you personally and reveal himself to you amen but if you come int and you just join a church then somebody can Offset you and you go yes sir it was revealed to Ruth something about Naomi and Israel and even Naomi couldn't separate Ruth from her amen because it was a personal revelation to Ruth but for a sister-in-law Opa it was an intellectual so she gave Naomi a kiss and returned to idol worship by you who has been called the Bible say many are called but few are chosen if you are one of the chosen that Jesus Christ not William Braham you never saw William Braham but Jesus Christ himself revealed himself to you through the message that he sent nothing can dissuade you amen amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so the Pastor said brother I read this quotes just a couple weeks before coming and I didn't have an idea and the Lord sent you here he said brother he put his arm around he said come to Peru and preach this gospel we need in Peru and I Lord I know why I had to pay $1,000 and just fight my way through to go to Mexico to preach one sermon and return back to the US but that's the what in doing the will of the Lord sometime it's easy to do things sometimes when the Lord try you like Abraham had only one sonow that he pray for 25 years for him and Sarah to get her son and the Lord said Abraham take your son Isaac and go sacrifice him for me will you do that if you can't even believe his word how can you sacrifice your son I in one sense is not easy but one sense is easy nobody's going to kill you when you believe Jesus Christ you can even go and stand and preach Jesus Christ nobody will nobody doesn't nobody cares but in certain times to mention the name of Jesus Christ could be a death warrant that's right that's right they can open the womb of your wife yeah and ask you to laugh if you don't laugh they cut your head or they throw you to Lions to eat you up they can kill your husband and ask you to denounce Jesus Christ that's right and those women were going into those uh death with singing with rejoicing with praises that they are even counted worthy to die for Jesus Christ that is what God is asking us to do is asking you to live for him he died for us but asking us to live he want to borrow your flesh and living his life to reflect himself in your flesh and that is why we need one thing the baptism of the Holy Spirit without that we are not going nowhere we can believe all we want we can shout all we want but if you don't have the Christ on the inside the control tower to control your flesh to direct you anything can blow you around Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so I think that is Jalem SE glory to the Lord and and it was just amazing and the brother the pastor was his heart was fulfilled and I realized that God put upon his heart so he said brother you don't know what it means to us for you to be here it means a whole lot and when you the the songs the song that they sing will lift you up from your chair wow I dance like I never danced before they are worship and the songs oh my goodness when they sang in I said Lord I can't I'm going to be like David praise God David Dan and took his outer garment it doesn't mean he didn't stri himself naked but in the East they have outer and inner garment it's just like having your jacket and then your shirt and and pants so David took his jacket outer garment and just dance to the Lord amen and so when it calls for it just praise the Lord amen if you can dance in clap to to praise the devil when you get converted why can't you dance to praise the Lord hallelujah If You Can Dance a bricks like Michael Jackson when you were in the world why can't you dance to praise the living Christ why are you shy about your brother and your sister Just Dance your brother can follow you up amen if you feel like dance dance if you feel like shouting shout if you feel like praising the Lord praise the Lord if you feel like saying hallelujah say hallelujah if you feel like amen say Amen you are free in the house of the Lord hallelujah amen not only in the house the Lord but in your home in your kitchen in your living room in your bedroom you can dance and rejoice I have my little tambourine when I get in this I just do I'm not a singer brother Jack brother Jack and some of the brothers are brother Smiley brother Troy they are blessed with double portion they have singing and preaching Ministry with me I'm not part of the singing Ministry I will even try to go there but I can make Melody unto the Lord Glory so I can take my sometime I take my tambourine and just rejoice and praise the Lord and just thank the Lord amen just the lord loves when you love him we only want to receive the love from the Lord sometime we use the Lord people write a prayer request pray for me when they are in need when they are sick but they don't want to give their heart to the Lord amen right we are using him when we need him it's just like somebody who doesn't care about you oh brother give me some money you give it to him you won hear for him 3 month give me some money he's just using you he'll never call you to say Mark how are you how is your family he only calls you send you message when he need dollars that is using the person and some of us are like that to the Lord we use him and the Lord out of his kindness he gives and gives and gives and gives but one day you're not going to use the Lord anymore and I want to come to if I should call it a sermon that's what I want to preach and I want my second let's go to Isaiah chapter 2 sorry chapter 60: one and two I think one and two would do prise God Isaiah chapter 60 in my country Ghana when you preach they categorize your someone into three three areas they either call it oh the brother the pastor preach a Faith Message preach fa to to elevate the people or they will say You Preach you preach a life message something that touches on on life or you preach a mystery and I just want to spend a little time to talk about life I'm not going to speak any mystery but I want to hit on life with something that happened to a brother uh recently amen that our decision here being here is a privilege Amen Brother come on God calling you to receive the Holy Spirit my brother my sister is a privilege amen and your life the skin that you wear in actuality is not for you it's a borrowed vessel that you're going to use on this Earth amen up to a time and God has a purpose Eternal purpose for your life yes sir which you have to recognize and accept glory god to fulfill that purpose amen and some do not accept that purpose do they recognize it and unfortunately their lives are cut short before the allotted time wow and I don't think it's the Lord who cut your life short but the devil cut your life and I I will break it down for you amen let's read Isaiah chapter 60 if somebody has opened it you can read it for me oh okay it's right here put arise Shine for that light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee please continue for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee praise to the Lord so what is the darkness part when you talk about darkness is death death has got sin unbelief torment it's all encapsulate as one darkness and the light is what Christ it's life eternal two things that we have to make a choice to pick one of them if you don't pick the other one the other one is a default if you you refuse Darkness you default to life if you refuse life the default is death and darkness and that's where the word is amen there's Darkness upon the Earth there's death upon the Earth in politics in religion all over around the world the only life is in Christ Jesus amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord and God has given you brother Maris thank you for your song he said I don't want to chase uh what the world chases is that right take first things first that is take Christ first amen amen it's just right on time amen so make sure you take life first because this life that you have is Grace it's a borrowed Glory you might think you're going to live 100 years as was saying that we give human given 70 years and everything after that is Grace you might not know when your time and my time will come the Lord has given you Grace to accept him life eternal into your heart amen but if you choose to refuse light then Darkness rest in your heart Darkness come upon you right there's a brother somewhere who recently passed away he gave his life to the Lord he pick the message going to church even through him that's why I was talking about it turn it you know how I preached in Mexico is going to be a little different here amen because God has got exactly what he need for this local assembly what they needed was given to them and sometime I see preach messages like token I think five times but if you follow the track of the message it's the same line of thought but different places that he preached I think California Jasonville it went around different because the local need of the church is different from what is in what is in Indiana amen so there's something that I think the Lord is pushing my heart ordinary I wouldn't preach I'll leave brother Jack to preach that sermon he's the pastor but I I'll preach it as an advice I'll call it a life message or an advice that if you are not if you have not given your heart fully to the Lord my brother my sister give your heart fully to the Lord I'm not going to preach no mystery but I'm going to touch something I will touch on our life that if you have not amen giving this life to the Lord Jesus Christ to be the control tower give it to him amen because sitting here is a privilege hearing this gospel is a privilege having a pastor is a privilege having Godly Parents is a privilege having people Elders around you is a privilege but if you don't take that privilege as a Grace as a love as what God has planted in your life and you walk over it today walk over it next year one day will come you woke over it the last time amen so this young brother to pck the message and through him he had wife and children even he dedicated his children in the church in the message he he was coming from a Muslim background not a practicing Muslim so they pray they don't practice it but they were like generally coming from Muslim so he came to church his cousin received the message and then they receive it and this brother's younger brother received it he likes to evangelize and likes to preach so this brother dedicated his children to the Lord coming with wife but somewhere along the line he stopped going to church wow of course anybody can get discouraged even Jesus got discouraged when he wanted to go to Calvary so Moses and Elijah Angels Came to strengthen him so there's nothing wrong if you get discourage that's why B Orin brother brother brother Troy and brother brother SM Simba right and brothers and sisters will encourage you so pastors Brothers ministers went to encourage him brother I mean what's going on what the problem and it went on for couple years now he took to drinking a friend will come with motorbike and pick him and they go drink he's got wife and four children they go drink and have so-called good time and he kept going so he got to a place they desire even to visit him was gone because he didn't want anybody to come around him he just chosen that path his younger brother everybody his father who are not even messy Believers because he was like a lie to the parents and through him the parents are getting closer they begin to lie the message but he went straight back to the to the world and a couple of just like probably less than two weeks his friend he was even according to the father he was a little bit drunk when his friend came to pick him with his motorbike they went to drink and when they were coming they were driving just Reckless they were two of two or three of them were drunk and they were in somebody's Lane and they were hit and one of the person's intestines gashed out two people died on the spot and and two were a little bit conscious broken foot and things like that ambulance picked them and the hospital said no we cannot we are not equipped to manage so they need to take them to another Advanced Hospital and even according to the story his wife was there he was now conscious and they were including each other that they will be fine they they will make it but then when the ambulance came they took two people and they left the other guy so the wife is why why are you leaving my husband your husband is gone and this is a brother 38y old brother with a wife and and four children and left the wife and four children because of alcohol wow drinking and that's why I want to advise you like I I W call it even a message but I want to advise us that this life is not for you if you give your heart to the devil sex drugs cocaine marijuana now marijuana is is is what in the state when I was living school it's still federal law doesn't legalize marijuana it's not a medic medicinal substance so uh state law state police can let you go but federal law federal police can arrest you for possessing marijuana people have been in jail I think the governor of Maryland recently released thousands of people who have been jailed for marijuana because Marana is like is like candy they have a g they are in everywhere they are chocolate different things and I be surpris even you come in the restaurant if you go to restaurant you want your your soup to be tinted with marijuana they can do it for you cuz it's everywhere medical medical marijuana you can smoke it you can sniff it you can do it chocolate you can make a tea you can make a soup whatever you want to do in marijuana it's everywhere yeah it's and people people in high positions I metet people a lady was telling me she works at a bank and said I've been doing it I've been doing it for years but you know now I'm thinking about my heart because the research is saying that it affect your heart so you can do marijuana you want you can do there's one drug that is killing the youth I forgot the name fno thank you it's killing people just left and right it's coming from Mexico from China through Mexico and they drop it here Chicago people are dying like rats it's a St story and this a real time human beings so for you to be here my brother my sister for you to have a pastor for you to have preachers for you to have who have sacrificed Psalm 50 verse 5 who have made Covenant with the Lord our Lord Brother Smiley say Lord when before the foundation what do you want to do he said Lord I'll be a pastor in okobi I'll preach your gospel brother jaav what do you want to do I'll go to West Palm Beach to pre the gospel and the Lord ordain this men and women here amen God didn't hand me of the Lord sisters who can who can who connect with Jesus Christ who have got Christ on the inside to guide you onto godliness and you refuse and you let the devil sweing death to you what you don't know is that there's death behind alcohol drugs sex life you are not married to people and living anyhow with them amen it's death but you won't see the death immediately it's hiding that's right go and send some Demon give him alcohol you take the alcohol you are high you think you have got you are the stronger strongest person when people drink they think the whole world is under them they they walk like this you think like you are you are way on top of the another planet and when they do drugs get your cocaine and weed I see people on the street they like that's right so what what is he seeing that I'm not singing then another that cocain has just taking his brain to another planet he's seen things that is funny H but as he take push cocaine into his body he's destroying his kidney he's destroying the liver it w be long his liver is going to die out kidney failure and then people have to work and taxpayers money has to help those people but you don't know death is painted so so beautiful like rose flowers pick it you don't know that there a bum that will detonate at the right time so if you let this life this country clubbing cocaine marijuana cigarette amen alcohol sex whatever you let it to that is a spirit that is going to lead you to die amen give me John 10:10 if if I'm right he said H let's give Jesus Christ came to give life abundantly the devil came to he said the devil came to is it the devil the devil the the devil came to Satan right to kill to steal the thief thank you the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it abundantly so Christ is here to give you eternal life am but sometime eternal life doesn't look flashy it's just simple it might even look boring going to church is boring why do I go to church wear lung scared wear dressed up it's boring I can just get my jeans wear my shorts go to Club go have some fun go to the beach you know with my girlfriend boyfriend whatever and go have fun church is so boring these are old folks they don't know what they are doing I want to have some there's life out there go and have life can go to Miami Beach you can go to wherever you want to go west pal Beach Beach go and drink alcohol but there a spirit of death God is so patient God is Not Like Us that you want to have a quick judgment God hasn't even judge but you know what he does he gives you Grace and I'm going to tell you something every son and daughter of God before you have you came on this Earth you've got an angel that was with you amen and when you draw from your mother's womb that angel is with you now the angel of the Lord Is Holy that is the angel that is Beed to you to be with you the rest of your life that angel is Holy the moment you start drinking the first time you start fornicating you put a distance between you and your angel that's right and you keep doing things you drink you smoke you put cocaine you distance yourself from the angel of the Lord so now you don't have any feeling of guilt you can do whatever you want nothing your conscience is what is here is hot onion so you can you can do whatever put on more drugs take cocaine put on alcoh drink alcohol nobody there's a time God will just leave you alone the angel of the Lord completely separate himself and now the Death Angel that's when the death angel steps in put more whatever you like to do because it gives you pleasure flesh things of the flesh the lust of the flesh the pride of life and the Wess of the spirit so you want to do your drugs you want to drink your alcohol and then the angel of the Lord is way away from you he doesn't it's not like he on the us to illustrate when you offend the angel or when you do something evil the angel will just like be on the tree when you repent it come no this not he's gone and tell the Lord your son your daughter doesn't listen and then the death angel will just come now that is what he wanted to do the ultimate is to kill you sometime not only killing you spiritually you already been dead all along but finally he want to slaughter you and death overtake you when you Le his just like my pre that brother was in my church in Ghana he wasn't somebody stranger to me and I said this when I heard it I said the brother is very quiet he doesn't he he wasn't he was not even drinking when he was in the world but then when he received Christ and he didn't receive the fullness of Christ he didn't go to see the Holy Spirit and he wouldn't come to church doesn't want nothing he's got his friend that they ride motorbike and go do their drinking he never expect that he was going to drink and they were going to death wow so my brother my sister do not joke with God God is Not mocked if you want to if you choose death choose death and you know that death is waiting for you sometime the time the Lord has allotted for you won't fulfill it you are destroying your organs with alcohol even people that live healthy life look at the food they make for us they put so much hormone in the food that the food that we supposed to eat and grow healthy the food is killing us how much more you plus putting drugs alcohol um uh fent what's the name of that drug F fentol and things into your system you are directly destroying your life and the demon demonic Spirit angels of death they will push you drink more alcohol take more drugs and you die people down on the streets so brother my sister I know a brother I was a student this brother went to Japan he was smart when I mean technology he knows them way said i' I don't even use it I have in first second third I don't use it second and third he knows technology just like that and the problem is alcohol a pastor gave him a place to leave even the pastor's own place he'll still sneak and go and drink alcohol and then he left and one evangelist gave him a place he has a shop made a shop for him like Hey do your your repair stuff and then get your daily bread he will still sneak and go and drink alcohol even student help him he how he died he died they have to use trash card take him and bury him he died they found him somewhere so if you don't let God take over your life if you don't see the Holy Spirit and you just be walking about in church going and coming without having Christ taking that decision to I want people don't love the Lord some people they just use the Lord right they don't even want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right right they don't want to be called seen as Christians outside if they have a need they come to CH to get healing they come to chch to get the job they come to church to get whatever they need but then they go back to the world they don't want to be seen as Christians they don't want they don't love Jesus Christ and you have to fall in love with him it's a marriage just like naturally you see a woman or a man and fall in love with him or her same thing spiritually you as a human being not everything God will come and scoop you and and do for you he's make giv you a choice to make your choice to love him to receive him for him to have preeminent in your life just like a man leads the wife with love God will lead you with love but if you don't love the Lord and you want to go in the world you let the things of the world H the pride of life Paul put it in that form the Wess of this life the lust of the flesh sex and and and drugs yes those that give you satisfaction you are digging your graveyard you are digging six foot to deep yourself in that's right and this is this is a real we are real time human beings we need to make real times decision for the Lord Jesus Christ because as the life Angel is going about the camp Death Angel is roing and who to to to devour if you let him so I'm not going to pre too long like I said I just want to advise I'm preaching just a live message and just a little advice that maybe it's for somebody is for all of us that let us young people receive the Holy Spirit let that become your desire don't just like to be appeared beautiful and nice but have the beauty of Christ on the inside don't just come with your parents go back and forth it's a personal decision that your pastor cannot make it for you you have to make your own decision to receive the Lord Jesus Christ you have to have the desire that I want to be born again you have to have desire Pastor Jack I want you to pray for me brother brother Smiley I want want to pray for me to receive the Holy Spirit I want my Dions to pray for me brother Troy brother brother Mark H sisters pray for me to receive the Holy Spirit you have to have that personal desire that love for the Lord Jesus Christ and if you don't do it and as you go a time will come the devil will send a little demon that's how demons work sometime they don't throw everything at once you're going to see the trick just like a catching a fish you just leure the fish a little bit and the fish coming before he realize is on the hook and the devil will lead you little desire and desire sometime we want to paint our nails that's right what are you painting your nails for who are you going to attract as a child right do you know the person that painted his her nails Jezebel right her lips right she had a motive she wanted to attract juu amen seduce jeu but the Lord has put in the heart of J to kill her she couldn't seduce je je said just drop her and throw her down down so everything has got a spirit so that we put certain things on our what do you call it those col they put it on the ears and you look like a cat you a human you're not a cat that's right you put a spirit that sometime when somebody can't even look in your face you don't know you have got you inviting demons into your life you are throwing away your guardian angel you are separating yourself you wear dresses that you're not supposed to wear God has got dresses for men cloth for men and cloth for women am amen and you want to show yourself for the world for demons for people to last after you you are inviting demons into your life you are inviting the death angel to come and I mean sip your life away from you but if you can invite Jesus Christ he's here now sometime you know what the Lord does he can give you 5 years when you start slipping off the Lord is patient he might give you today's what 20 20 today's date is what 30th right 30th June 2024 it can give you let's say 30th June 2030 you have six or five years and you do whatever you want you don't feel no condemnation remember sweet 16 talk about the young lady in his church this young lady was privileged to have the prophet of God as her pastor a man that can Swit from this life and see things in eternity he can be in the us and see what is going on in Russia you can be in the US and see the war that was going on in Korea this was a pastor a man Jesus Christ incarnated in and he said sweet 16 he didn't mention the name said sweet 16 let let's call it sweet 16 said what do you see in this boy he said he she he smells good his feet his Fe smell good that's a childhood craziness nice feet smells good R said that's a CeCe a man that a man that perfumes himself men men don't perfume them women do that a man that perfumes himself to everybody can turn around and smell you that is a SP of CeCe all right all right and say oh I love him he said you he doesn't he doesn't love your religion your doesn't love what you stand for and it doesn't stand for what you and your stand for what do you see this boy but guess what happened s went to premature premature grave because of sex last on the flesh she didn't live long so my brother my sister don't let the devil lure you because it is real it's happening real time people dying because of unbelief because they wouldn't fall in love with Jesus Christ and at the same time people are having life eternal and rejoicing it doesn't mean Christian don't have problem you have problem but even if you die for the Lord that's a blessing amen so I will I I my that's what I have for today and uh the Lord bless you and let's be on our [Applause] feet shall we pray our Lord we thank you for the L you've opened to us father Lord may you sink into the hearts of where you have ordained the word to be Lord Jesus take us from death take us from unbelief from everything that the enemy Le your sons and daughters with that having a mind that we don't see not having the spiritual mind of Christ that we see those things as life when is actually death sentence death warrant that the enemy throw upon your people father Lord may you Open the Eyes of each and every one of us all around Lord Jesus to make a choice to make choices for you to receive you in our hearts that we be transformed and receive life Everlasting we thank you for the love that you given to us we give all the glory and honor to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you may take your seat [Music] being in um in church for many of my years I know that um when God gives a minister a sermon like that he's not doing that for um just for no reason God knows that there is I'm I'm a I'm I I believe there's somebody in this room even today that God was speaking to um brother brother brother quu just you know just just being led of the spirit and and just talking about eternal life is here but what what are you doing what are you doing with it uh and I think um uh from the youngest to the oldest we have to we have to make decisions he talked about a man that was 38 years old you know what happened this man's already got married the Lord's blessed him with a a wife and he got you know he's got kids and but yet there's a pull pulling this man out into the world right and uh so the the pit pressure is something that's not only the young people facing but even older people face this right and we have to make a decision as as to whether I'm going to live for God or not all right and um um just um U no matter what age it is you have to come to the conclusion that you're going to live for god um I want to say this just as I was listening to brother brother quick who sometimes as young people we get enough Holy Ghost to satisfy Mama and Daddy I want to say that again we we get enough Holy Ghost to satisfy Mama and Daddy and and and what I mean by that we learn how we supposed to dress we know how we're supposed to act we learn all these things but deep down on the inside that that real desire to serve God is just not there and uh and what you have to come up with is not something that's just going to please Mom and Daddy cuz Mom and Daddy Ain't Got No Heaven or Hell to put you in right you have to come to a decision that I'm going to serve God regardless of what my mom and daddy do right and you got to come to a spot where you love God more than what Mom and Daddy love God but um I I believe the Holy Spirit I believe the holy spirit spok amen through brother quu today the scripture tells us this as many as believed on him to them he gave power to become Sons and Daughters of God and uh and I want to just say if you would just yield your heart to the Lord just a a simple prayer amen God I know that you were speaking to me thank you for warning me today because you know what you could leave here and go out there and do exactly what that man was doing and lose your life you can lose your life just that fast and uh one thing I found about a death death don't have age limits to it it's it's not just for the old people but death comes if you just pick up your newspaper and read the obituaries there's young people dying every day right and uh and and you know there there's some sometimes you look at some of the older sanction like when my you know if uh like he said after the 70 is just Grace right and so many of our Saints have already made it past 70 God's been very good to them and you would think that you might you might think I got longer to live than what they got to live but some of them going to outlive you because you wouldn't yield to the Lord there's a quote that he he was it came to my mind look on the in the in the table app search just put five years from now 5 years from now just look for that and there's a quote where brother Brandon begins to talk about 5 years from now you could be here and 5 years from now you could be there and 5 years from now all because of your decision that you made today I want to just I want to find that I know if if you don't do a direct uh search you can just put 5 years from now and then put spitune SP p i t t o n I believe uh it'll come up and I just want to read that quote um this God this God this God Amen the song was in my heart I put it in my notes amen the day I surrender all I wanted wanted to sing that but I didn't know how but I'm going to sing it now because uh this is something that we need to come to a place of surrender just 5 years from now put it in direct uh quotes 5 years from now okay what's the title of the [Music] sermons go to ashamed I believe and uh pull that one and then do five it's going to say something like 5 years from now you could be in a barroom cleaning Tunes so 5 years from now you could be here and 5 years from now it says something like that inside the quote I believe it's in the message of Shame and if so just pull that one up for me but I want to I want to read that amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus for speaking to us thank you God thank you God um when I was a young man there was times in my life where I thought I was saved and I had you know made confessions and things that but my life was not lining up with what the word of God was telling me I should line up with and uh and you know when you would go through seasons of life and then you have to come back and repent all over again and then you think I got it right I got it right and then your life don't line up again uh it was only uh uh probably after the third or fourth time that I really got it right and uh and that's where I know God did something on the inside and and the desires change uh I wasn't sneaking from church going back and listening to that music that I was supposed to be listening to I wasn't doing the things that I know Christians weren't supposed to do and you know when I'm not around my parents I'm doing something no those days was over with right and I want to encourage you you know young people uh if there's anything in your life God is calling it out today I'm telling you the holy ghost was here not just here but even online somebody online might might have need to hear exactly what this brother said today amen did you find it Sis okay hold on I'll get it uh the word spitune I think it's SP t t o n or or it uh SP p i t o o n okay 5 years from now spit tune and don't put it in in a direct quote don't put it in a direct was it by faith Moses okay 5 years from today put it in that way 5 years from today I'm sorry thank you thank you so much by faith Moses is where it is thank you Amen in his presence daily and uh all right I just want to read [Music] this by faith Moses all right thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen ah surrender [Music] all I surrender all oh all to thee my blessed Savor I Surrender [Music] oh all right let me read this the prophet says and it may be this morning that there'll be men and women sitting here that'll make your final Choice it says you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now he says and what you choose now will determine what you'll be 5 years from today says 5 years from today you may be a missionary all because of a sermon like this that you heard today you may be a missionary from that says 5 years from today you may be a renowned Christian or 5 years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision just 5 years today you may be cleaning may be cleaning spatoon in a barroom that's ashes right it says 5 Years From to day you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a woman a man or woman that's a that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ 5 years from today you may be in glory gone in the Rapture because you made your choice today and it says but you got to choose and don't look at what you see and he was talking about the things of the world and we just want to you know all the the the the the way that we dress the the fingernail polish the toenail polish the you know all the things of the world we all of that type of stuff we we we want to please people in the world it's not pleasing God he said but you but you got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith and he goes on to talk about how Abraham had to choose by faith faith and you know and just so many Moses had to choose by faith the Rich Young Ruler failed to choose by faith and he ended up in hell I I I I just encourage you I advise you don't let the devil still eternal life is here he's a eternal life is a person and he is here to give it to you but it's your choice he's not going to force himself on you it's your choice to accept the Lord Lord Jesus Christ let's just sing a course of this song Let's stand to our feet amen and
