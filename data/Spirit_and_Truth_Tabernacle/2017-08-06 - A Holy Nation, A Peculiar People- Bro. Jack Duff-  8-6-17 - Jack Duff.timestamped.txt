[5:20] a new song play skillfully with a loud

[5:25] the earth is full of the goodness of the

[5:34] the breath of his mouth you drove of the

[5:42] lit up to death in his storehouses let
[5:46] all the earth fear the Lord that all the

[47:38] a scripture we again going back to first
[47:42] Peter chapter 2 and we want to read from
[47:46] there just just kind of working our way
[47:48] through this and just enjoying our
[47:50] journey a man as we go and I just been
[47:55] asking the Lord to help me not to move
[47:59] through it too fast I want to try to
[48:00] find that every Leggett in here and and
[48:03] polish it and and you know and just just
[48:05] you know hopefully to be something I've
[48:07] benefited spiritually but but there's
[48:10] there's much much here a man much all
[48:13] through the Word of God but so let's
[48:15] just pick this up here in 1st Peter
[48:17] chapter 2 verse 1 wherefore laying aside
[48:21] all malice and all guile and hypocrisies
[48:25] and envies and all evil speakings and
[48:30] man as newborn babes desire the sincere
[48:34] milk of the word that you may grow
[48:37] thereby
[48:38] if so BG have tasted that the Lord is
[48:42] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[48:46] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[48:49] chosen of God and precious ye also as
[48:54] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[48:59] house a holy priesthood so even as we're
[49:01] going through this this journey
[49:03] the Word of God is actually building us
[49:05] up a spiritual house calling us to this
[49:09] holy precinct right a holy priesthood to
[49:12] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[49:16] to God by Jesus Christ Lord okay let me
[49:21] keep going wherefore also it is
[49:24] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[49:27] in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect
[49:30] precious and he that believeth on him
[49:34] shall not be confounded unto you
[49:37] therefore which believe he is precious
[49:39] but unto them which be disobedient the
[49:42] stone which the builders disallowed the
[49:44] same as made the head of the corner and
[49:47] a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[49:49] offense even to them which son by the
[49:51] word being disobedient wearing - also
[49:54] they were appointed but ye are a chosen
[49:58] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[50:03] nation a peculiar people that ye should
[50:08] show forth the praises of him with
[50:12] called you out of darkness into his
[50:16] marvelous light that's your personal
[50:19] testimony what he did for you right
[50:20] since which in time past were not a
[50:23] people but are now the people of God
[50:26] which had not obtained mercy but now
[50:29] have obtained mercy and then the Lord as
[50:34] a blessing to the reading of his word
[50:35] let's just bound world of Prayer God we
[50:38] are grateful for the privilege to be
[50:42] able to read the word but we know it
[50:44] takes the Holy Ghost to help us to
[50:46] understand what it is that we're reading
[50:49] well we look at Peter writing such words
[50:52] as these God we just stop and just
[50:56] really meditate and really reflect on
[50:58] what is he trying to say to us and now
[51:01] we pray that as we go through this
[51:03] thought that you would just speak to our
[51:05] hearts help us all to get ourselves out
[51:07] of the way that we can hear from heaven
[51:09] even on today thank you for everything
[51:11] that's happened thus far in the service
[51:13] be the worship the special that was
[51:16] member of the troy lord I pray that you
[51:18] just bless a man each and one thing each
[51:21] and every one thank you for the sisters
[51:23] Lord and what they're doing with the
[51:25] music and God would just appreciate what
[51:27] we see you doing in our midst we know
[51:29] that only you could do these things so
[51:31] we pray father that you would now
[51:33] blesses that we enter into the Word of
[51:36] God for today it's in Jesus name we pray
[51:38] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[51:45] amen so today we will just take our
[51:51] thoughts on a holy nation a peculiar
[51:55] people
[51:56] amen a holy nation a peculiar people and
[52:01] we will just kind of work through this
[52:05] just a little bit the as we were just
[52:09] reading there in the scripture first
[52:11] Peter 2 verse 5 it said you also as
[52:16] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[52:21] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[52:24] spiritual sacrifices acceptable got to
[52:27] God by Jesus Christ and you know I just
[52:30] want to kind of start out you know our
[52:32] thought we're kind of bringing you know
[52:35] still some things from last week you
[52:38] know when we're talking about the royal
[52:39] priesthood you know and we're bringing
[52:42] some things from that they were trying
[52:43] to go forward a little bit and just make
[52:45] a little connection here I mentioned on
[52:48] last week that you know that fault when
[52:50] you talk about royal priesthood there
[52:51] are multiple different channels that you
[52:53] can go in and one of them that I
[52:55] mentioned but you know didn't go into I
[52:58] like to just try to take a little time
[53:00] to try to try to hit that Amen on today
[53:02] but when we talk about you know this
[53:05] when we think think about the priesthood
[53:07] we have to go back and start thinking
[53:09] about Old Testament right we cannot get
[53:13] away from from what what what occur
[53:15] there in the Old Testament amen and and
[53:19] there's a number of things that can be
[53:21] said there you know what one of the key
[53:23] things is you know today that the the
[53:25] women and ministry is something that's
[53:27] dominating you know
[53:30] land right all over the world people
[53:32] believe that everybody is called a
[53:34] preach and everybody's not called to
[53:35] preach but and the way that we the way
[53:38] that we keep our types right the way
[53:41] that we keep our our New Testament view
[53:43] right because the New Testament does not
[53:45] eliminate the Old Testament Amen but but
[53:49] what we got us types and shadows and and
[53:52] all we got to do is look back at the Old
[53:54] Testament and see what God established
[53:55] there we can keep the pattern going
[53:57] right hey man Jesus had come to do away
[53:59] with it he come to magnify it right you
[54:03] know I mean you know and the way that we
[54:05] we can look at that is one statement you
[54:07] know Moses tone say thou shalt not
[54:09] commit adultery right that's what that's
[54:11] what Moses said but Jesus comes along
[54:13] and magnifies that and he said he says
[54:17] he that look at the punna woman a man
[54:19] and lust after her in his heart he has
[54:22] committed adultery already
[54:23] he never even touched a lady right he
[54:26] never laid hands only just his eyes were
[54:29] laid his elated either and that was
[54:32] committing adultery already so Jesus
[54:34] magnified the law not not excluded the
[54:38] long that's not what happened right so
[54:40] when we look at this you know even when
[54:42] we talk about research you know you go
[54:44] back you look and the priesthood was
[54:46] only men right it was only men in the
[54:50] priesthood glory to God so so that's how
[54:53] we know that if it was men back in that
[54:56] time as priests we not talking about
[54:58] being a judge
[54:59] we loved Deborah was a judge but she was
[55:01] not a priest handling the fire of God
[55:04] handling the Word of God only the police
[55:07] handle that oh my god anybody that was
[55:11] not a priest I would try to have that we
[55:13] get in trouble with God you all remember
[55:15] when you know they went to get the ark
[55:18] amen and they went down into into the
[55:20] land of the Philistines because that you
[55:22] know the people that got away from the
[55:23] God God in the days of our a lie and you
[55:26] know and the sons don't think so that
[55:28] our end up down there in the land until
[55:30] sighs when they went to go get the ark
[55:32] david is bringing the ark back home
[55:33] right you know I'm sorry I might have
[55:36] that mixed up but I know David went
[55:38] since to go get the ark to bring it back
[55:40] home and when he's bringing it back home
[55:41] there was a man that reached
[55:43] to touch the art and when that man
[55:45] reached out to touch the art that man
[55:47] dodged right not anybody just couldn't
[55:51] do that I know nowadays we got anybody
[55:54] touching the art but it was it was not
[55:56] that way in the old testament if a man
[55:59] test your can he was supposed to he
[56:01] thought I don't care how good his
[56:03] intention was it was not based on good
[56:08] intentions based on what the line of God
[56:10] said God said only the please pick carry
[56:14] the ark hallelujah so that's the way it
[56:18] was you know back there in the Old
[56:19] Testament and when when we look at you
[56:22] know these things a man I want to just
[56:24] kind of bring out because we talked
[56:26] about a priesthood we have to reflect on
[56:28] you know what occurred there in the Old
[56:30] Testament the priesthood started with
[56:32] this lit with Aaron and his sons amen
[56:35] Aaron and his sons come along when God
[56:37] called Moses as the Prophet the bring
[56:40] delivers to the children is rayul then
[56:42] he raised up Aaron Moses's brother
[56:44] oh my there's a lot to be said right
[56:47] there
[56:48] amen you know you know you hear people
[56:50] always talking about that's a family
[56:52] church that's a family church data you
[56:58] know as a family do this and fans it's
[57:00] just a family Church you got to be
[57:02] careful with that statement because when
[57:04] you really look back in the Bible that
[57:06] the tooth of Israel were family the
[57:11] twelve sons of Jacob Amen the children
[57:13] Israel they were brothers they were
[57:15] family that was a family church right
[57:22] glory to God so you got to be very
[57:24] careful with you when you make
[57:25] statements like that and sometimes just
[57:27] the devil trying to come against people
[57:29] but all you know less light and malice
[57:31] and landside envying lay aside all that
[57:33] stuff because that's not what we're
[57:35] talking about hallelujah but you know
[57:37] went went went went with it when they
[57:39] were coming along here Aaron a man is
[57:41] ordained to be a man a priest he was the
[57:45] high priest in that day and you know his
[57:47] sons ordained to be priests as well now
[57:50] when we look at this scripture a man in
[57:52] 1st Peter to father says he also has
[57:55] lively
[57:56] homes are built up a spiritual house a
[57:59] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[58:02] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[58:05] Christ you just can't offer up anything
[58:07] you want to offer up
[58:09] it's got to be according to the Word of
[58:11] God because Aaron's sons got in trouble
[58:14] for offering a strange fire those boys
[58:19] died because they offered the wrong type
[58:21] of fire to God I mean people ain't dying
[58:24] today
[58:24] physically but they certainly find
[58:26] spiritually because they're all for
[58:28] their own sacrifices to God you got to
[58:31] offer to God where he wants a man we
[58:35] can't be like King right Cain Cain
[58:38] thought he could come with his offering
[58:40] in that time and say you know this is
[58:42] some fruit of the field and this is you
[58:44] know this this looks good this was
[58:45] beautiful I'm gonna present this to God
[58:47] God did not accept what Cain had to
[58:50] offer and even today I can tell you God
[58:52] is not accepting a lot of stuff that
[58:54] people are offering even though they do
[58:57] it in the name of Jesus it's not being
[58:59] accepted we want to offer to God a man
[59:02] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[59:06] by Jesus Christ now listen in the Old
[59:09] Testament you know when they when the
[59:12] priests would you know that their duty
[59:13] was to serve to intercede on behalf of
[59:17] the people Atlanta you know the kind of
[59:20] take the sacrifices that the people
[59:22] would bring in and they were offered as
[59:24] sacrifices to God it was it was the
[59:26] priest duty to do these things amen the
[59:29] priest kind of stood in the gap there
[59:31] you know it was the priests duty after
[59:33] to handle these things God established
[59:36] the priests to take care he established
[59:38] the Aaronic priesthood to take care of
[59:40] that now I look at it uh you know we
[59:43] brought out last week au Uzziah being a
[59:48] king he was not supposed to take the
[59:50] office of a priest but he did and when
[59:54] he did he got in trouble with God he
[59:56] didn't die but he did get he was
[59:58] stricken with leprosy because he took on
[1:00:00] the office of a priest now in Old
[1:00:02] Testament he could not take on that
[1:00:05] office being a king because God
[1:00:07] established in a certain way that nobody
[1:00:10] to cross those lines but in the New
[1:00:12] Testament that thing has changed because
[1:00:14] the blood of Jesus Christ makes the
[1:00:16] difference the reason we can call
[1:00:19] ourselves Kings the reason we can call
[1:00:21] ourselves priests is because we've been
[1:00:23] washed loose in the blood
[1:00:28] hallelujah don't you ever ever take for
[1:00:32] granted what the blood has done for you
[1:00:35] listen now so in Old Testament a man was
[1:00:39] preached in a certain order that people
[1:00:41] would come God established a certain
[1:00:43] place for people to bring their their
[1:00:46] sacrifices they have to bring it to the
[1:00:48] temple they have to bring it a man you
[1:00:51] know the temple was designed a certain
[1:00:53] way when they had to get there and you
[1:00:56] know and that that was where God would
[1:00:57] meet them so it within the congregation
[1:01:00] of Israel God had a certain place that
[1:01:02] he would meet them and they they knew
[1:01:03] the glory of God was there and what
[1:01:05] would happen they would go to the temple
[1:01:07] the temple was designed with three
[1:01:09] sections they add the outer Court of the
[1:01:12] temple a man they had the inner Court of
[1:01:15] the temple and then they had what we
[1:01:16] call the Holy of Holies or also called
[1:01:19] the most holy place amen now what would
[1:01:23] happen in the outer court they had a
[1:01:25] brazen altar for all the burnt offerings
[1:01:27] so when a person seen a man they would
[1:01:30] come and bring their offering a man to
[1:01:32] the priests for him to kill a man the
[1:01:34] offering and God would accept that
[1:01:36] sacrifice the personal mission for the
[1:01:38] thing God would accept that and he would
[1:01:40] actually lay the since only animal that
[1:01:42] was being offered hallelujah some man
[1:01:45] would come with his animal and when you
[1:01:47] came to you know when you came there
[1:01:50] before the priests you could not pick
[1:01:51] out your worst animal you had to bring
[1:01:55] God your best if you bring in a lamb you
[1:01:58] had to bring him your best one without
[1:02:00] spot or wrinkle you had to offer that to
[1:02:03] God Amen don't come to God with your
[1:02:06] leftovers come to God with your best
[1:02:11] hallelujah amen you know so here that
[1:02:14] you know they were they were coming and
[1:02:16] went when when the worshiper would come
[1:02:18] with his lamb and and then he would give
[1:02:20] it to the priest and the priest which
[1:02:21] would take the neck
[1:02:23] the lemon and slice it and the blood
[1:02:25] will come out showing that it was going
[1:02:27] to take blood to rid us of our sin it
[1:02:31] was going to take look and only the
[1:02:32] blood of Jesus could rid us of my taste
[1:02:34] blood is what God accepted right so here
[1:02:38] you know the worship were coming then
[1:02:41] then we lay their hands on the only lamb
[1:02:44] and and and actually lay their hands on
[1:02:46] the lamb they're transferring their sins
[1:02:47] to the lamb and the priest lays the lamb
[1:02:50] and God accepts that sacrifice for sin
[1:02:53] so the priest was serving they were
[1:02:55] interceding eat on behalf of the people
[1:02:58] now listen so the priests when they went
[1:03:00] out they what they what they were they
[1:03:02] were they were grown up the burnt
[1:03:04] offering I mean the brazen altar for the
[1:03:05] burnt opens they have elaborate air for
[1:03:07] washing and the priest would accept and
[1:03:10] then all for the sacrifices on behalf of
[1:03:13] the people listen in the inner court
[1:03:15] which is also called the holy place
[1:03:18] there was a golden altar of incense the
[1:03:22] table of showbread and a golden
[1:03:25] candlestick and and there the priest
[1:03:28] would enter daily to intercede on behalf
[1:03:32] of the people as they offer Amen
[1:03:34] instance which was which was really
[1:03:36] prayer that was going up before God it
[1:03:38] was representative of prayer the priests
[1:03:41] are the ones that would offer the prayer
[1:03:43] oh come on church this is this is why I
[1:03:47] was selling saying last week we come
[1:03:49] amen on Sunday morning as priests when
[1:03:53] we come on Tuesday night we come ask
[1:03:55] reason because you know you got love
[1:03:58] with that that are in a condition where
[1:04:00] maybe they can't get a prayer through
[1:04:01] the gods may be not in the place where
[1:04:04] God would accept their prayer hallelujah
[1:04:07] but we come amen because we've been
[1:04:09] washed in blood amen when you come God
[1:04:12] not looking at your sin God see the
[1:04:15] blood of Jesus Christ amen you got rats
[1:04:19] in and that's red blood and read through
[1:04:22] red makes white
[1:04:25] hallelujah glory to God Church so so God
[1:04:29] not looking at he's looking at what a
[1:04:31] finished product of what he's done with
[1:04:32] his blood over you through you in you
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:36] better washer they loose from everything
[1:04:39] thank you Jesus
[1:04:41] so when we come we come as priests
[1:04:44] hallelujah and you know just just kind
[1:04:47] of looking at this amen when the priest
[1:04:51] was going to that inner court and it
[1:04:53] offered the incense before God they did
[1:04:55] this daily in the mornings and in the
[1:04:57] evenings amen they win and they did they
[1:04:59] offered that incense and it was just it
[1:05:01] was prayers that were going up that
[1:05:02] that's what this was it was just a
[1:05:04] prayers the instance that was going up
[1:05:06] before God and God just accepting that
[1:05:09] but when it came to the Holies of Holies
[1:05:13] or what we call the most holy place and
[1:05:16] there was a mercy seat and also the Ark
[1:05:20] of the Covenant and the Ark of the
[1:05:23] Covenant were the ten commandments that
[1:05:25] God had give him a man Moses on the
[1:05:27] mountain you know when he gave them that
[1:05:29] he placed it inside this mercy seat and
[1:05:32] the high priest was the only person that
[1:05:35] could go inside this place and he only
[1:05:38] went in once a year on the Day of
[1:05:40] Atonement and only the high threes
[1:05:43] anybody else that was not the high
[1:05:46] priest that was going inside this place
[1:05:48] it was certain death hallelujah glory to
[1:05:53] God once a year on one day out of the
[1:05:56] year
[1:05:57] a man which was the Day of Atonement the
[1:05:59] high priest would approach this place
[1:06:01] now I want you to stay with me here amen
[1:06:04] just a little bit I want to bring in a
[1:06:06] couple things because we're talking
[1:06:08] about being a royal priesthood
[1:06:10] now when you when you when you really
[1:06:12] begin to think about what those priests
[1:06:13] have been doing the sacrifice that they
[1:06:15] had to make I mean daily they were
[1:06:18] sacrificing on behalf of the people you
[1:06:21] can see why they couldn't go to work
[1:06:23] right they couldn't go out and get a
[1:06:25] normal job like everybody else the
[1:06:27] Levites has a stay there and all for on
[1:06:29] behalf of the people daily now now that
[1:06:31] the problem that happened back in that
[1:06:33] time underneath that Aaronic priesthood
[1:06:35] one of the big problems that even though
[1:06:38] a person would bring their sin offering
[1:06:40] to God and they had offered to the
[1:06:42] priest they were they were they would
[1:06:44] they would stand there put their hand on
[1:06:45] that animal see the blood transfer amen
[1:06:48] their sin transfer
[1:06:50] to that mantel through the blood that
[1:06:51] was sacrificed but yet the desire for
[1:06:54] seeing still was in them so here they
[1:06:59] might leave they'll go out and they
[1:07:00] think they've done their duty but the
[1:07:02] desire for sin is still on the inside of
[1:07:05] them that's why we needed the Holy Ghost
[1:07:08] the Holy Ghost takes me these fire away
[1:07:11] and when you been baptized with the Holy
[1:07:15] Ghost and you can call yourself a royal
[1:07:17] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:07:22] people if the Holy Ghost that sets you
[1:07:25] apart you can't be holy without the Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost you can't be holy you can you can
[1:07:34] try to be holy but it is impossible for
[1:07:37] you to be holy without the Holy Ghost in
[1:07:39] your life you just go through motions
[1:07:42] hallelujah glory to God let's just kind
[1:07:45] of let's look at this a little bit amen
[1:07:47] a couple things that the prophets in and
[1:07:50] you know I'll read one but another amen
[1:07:53] when you were when you were a Levite and
[1:07:58] you were offering sacrifice
[1:08:00] he's on behalf of the people the thing
[1:08:03] of it is that you had to be born of that
[1:08:06] tribe
[1:08:07] you could not be of the tribe a man of
[1:08:11] Benjamin or the tribe of a fan or gather
[1:08:14] you can be one of other tribes and then
[1:08:16] try to take on the job you know of the
[1:08:19] Levites who can do that you had to be
[1:08:21] born of that lineage in order to make
[1:08:24] offerings on behalf of the people you
[1:08:27] had to be born of that lineage and in
[1:08:30] order to be a royal priest of God you
[1:08:33] have to be born again alright look at
[1:08:39] this believers out this I'm reading
[1:08:42] something here a man just from the
[1:08:46] Prophet says I Aaron when he went into
[1:08:50] the holiest of holies once a year he had
[1:08:53] to wear a certain kind of a garment and
[1:08:55] he had to be anointed and he had to take
[1:08:58] blood with him is that right and on the
[1:09:01] hem of His garment
[1:09:02] he had a pump
[1:09:03] and so this is the day of you know the
[1:09:06] Day of Atonement that he's going into
[1:09:08] the holiest of Holies now-now-now when
[1:09:11] he went in a man noticed he had to be
[1:09:13] dressed a certain way when it goes into
[1:09:16] the Holies of Holies it causes him to be
[1:09:18] dressed a certain way right
[1:09:20] he had to be anointed he had to take
[1:09:23] blood with him a man and all on the hem
[1:09:26] of his garment he had a poly granite and
[1:09:28] a bale of pomegranate and a bale and he
[1:09:31] and as he walked he had to make that
[1:09:34] play oh my god see as he walked a man in
[1:09:39] this industry had to make that the bells
[1:09:41] play holy holy holy unto the Lord now as
[1:09:46] he walked into this most holy place this
[1:09:49] is what he made the Bears play I want
[1:09:52] you to see something it's hard
[1:09:53] meaningless trying to my thoughts all
[1:09:55] over the place but I've got it I gotta
[1:09:57] inject these things amen
[1:10:00] since Jesus came we don't have this
[1:10:03] place anymore when Jesus died the temple
[1:10:06] veil was rent torn in two and we don't
[1:10:09] have this place anymore it was death if
[1:10:11] a man went in and he was supposed to go
[1:10:14] into that place back in that day but in
[1:10:16] this day and this day it is death if you
[1:10:19] stay out
[1:10:21] so God and calm you just of your church
[1:10:24] limba God and calling you to stand in
[1:10:29] the outer court darling call you to
[1:10:32] stand in the inner course but God wants
[1:10:35] you to go all the way in until the
[1:10:37] Holies of Holies
[1:10:40] hallelujah somebody so people satisfy
[1:10:43] test being on the outside but God wants
[1:10:45] you to come all the way on the inside
[1:10:48] he's called you to be a part of a holy
[1:10:51] nation a royal priesthood
[1:10:54] oh come on search so this goes deeper
[1:10:59] and deeper and deeper and enviable so
[1:11:03] just to ask you look at your own life
[1:11:04] and see where you can go deeper with God
[1:11:08] look at your own life now I mean that

[1:12:29] amen to today's time the reeds the
[1:12:32] reason we can even call ourselves royal
[1:12:35] priesthood is because of what the blood
[1:12:37] of Jesus Christ did
[1:12:38] that's why amen so when we go back we
[1:12:41] get these Old Testament acts we want to
[1:12:43] bring them forth so we can see where we
[1:12:45] are today
[1:12:45] we're no longer under the Aaronic
[1:12:47] priesthood brother Branham say we're
[1:12:50] under the priesthood of Melchisedec milk
[1:12:54] the Melchizedek Priesthood is where we
[1:12:56] are now
[1:12:58] hallelujah hallelujah all right let me
[1:13:01] let me just go on a little further and
[1:13:03] in this pendants quote believers out
[1:13:05] this he says he had the pomegranate
[1:13:07] Abell and he walked and as he walked he
[1:13:10] had to make that play holy holy holy
[1:13:15] unto the Lord now now now now now that's
[1:13:19] what the the high priests actors doing
[1:13:21] the reason that the bells will ring
[1:13:22] that's how they knew the man was still
[1:13:25] living if the bells stop ringing they
[1:13:27] knew maybe there was something in his
[1:13:29] life
[1:13:31] I mean the bells stop ringing can I just
[1:13:35] say this way what causes a bell to stop
[1:13:37] bringing in your life huh why's the
[1:13:42] bells stop ringing in your life we need
[1:13:45] to hear the bells amen we want we want
[1:13:47] to hear noise glory glory to God we want
[1:13:53] to hear the noise run around and say
[1:13:56] free you should see we should hear amen
[1:13:58] every once in a while we should hear
[1:14:01] glory to God every once in a while we
[1:14:03] need to hear the noise they let us know
[1:14:05] that to Lennon we want to know that you
[1:14:15] living with some time in the Word of God
[1:14:17] get good see it's okay to say Amen Matt
[1:14:21] you know it's alright I mean when we you
[1:14:23] know this is going to be the quietest
[1:14:25] place that you'll ever be right here
[1:14:28] where you are right now if you go to
[1:14:29] hell which I hope you don't let if you
[1:14:32] go it's going to be weeping and gnashing
[1:14:34] of teeth right but if you go to heaven
[1:14:38] it's going to be joy unspeakable and
[1:14:40] full of glory come on somebody so the
[1:14:46] Word of God can't to get good to save in
[1:14:49] somebody hallelujah we want to hear the
[1:14:54] bells ringing glory to God not now if
[1:14:57] you come to church like this you know
[1:14:59] one brother told brother Branham say you
[1:15:02] know them people just be shouting and
[1:15:03] all kind of stuff in church and say hey
[1:15:05] man you say brother that that just scare
[1:15:07] me so I just I feel I feel very
[1:15:10] uncomfortable when they do that he said
[1:15:12] what'd he say I enjoy it when they do it
[1:15:14] they say I enjoy it you know he said
[1:15:17] he'd say well he say he'd say you know
[1:15:19] if you if you if you if you are go to if
[1:15:21] you go to heaven it's going to be so
[1:15:22] much noise up there

[1:15:26] buddy you know if you go to hell it's
[1:15:28] gonna be noise I'm saying it's the
[1:15:29] quietest place ever be saying you got to
[1:15:30] enjoy with people when people are
[1:15:32] pulling on the Word of God
[1:15:33] it actually makes it make it easier the
[1:15:36] service become easy with everybody begin
[1:15:38] the pool Oh glory and it also shows that
[1:15:42] your life is holy holy holy
[1:15:44] Willie sometimes the reason we can't say
[1:15:47] a man
[1:15:49] the reason the bells stop ringing
[1:15:51] because we don't let stand get in there
[1:15:54] somewhere
[1:15:54] come on somebody but if you keep the
[1:15:58] thin out your bells are keep ringing
[1:16:05] listen listen he says he says um and as
[1:16:09] he walked he had to make that play holy
[1:16:11] holy and holy unto the Lord and only way
[1:16:15] that they know that the man was still
[1:16:17] alive that God hadn't slayed them back
[1:16:19] there in behind the curtain because it
[1:16:21] because that noise they can hear the
[1:16:23] bell ringing I tell you the only way I
[1:16:26] know there's any life in the church when
[1:16:29] a little noise get started somewhere you
[1:16:32] know just a little a man once in a while
[1:16:34] or a little something you know make a
[1:16:36] little noise Amen you got a license from

[1:16:46] right
[1:16:46] hallelujah say some of them say what
[1:16:48] brother branham is emotional well I can
[1:16:51] scientifically prove to you anything
[1:16:53] without emotion is dead so if your
[1:16:59] religion hasn't got any emotion in it
[1:17:01] bury the thing that's right cuz it's no
[1:17:05] good instead a man we thank God for a
[1:17:09] little emotion amen we think up or you

[1:19:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:26] and forever we're talking about the
[1:19:28] priests a man we're talking about the
[1:19:30] priests talking about that air ironic
[1:19:32] priesthood but that now is done away
[1:19:35] with now because of the blood of Christ
[1:19:38] a man we have been called to this royal
[1:19:41] priesthood we are holy nation a peculiar
[1:19:44] people and y'all just bear with because
[1:19:46] like I said I want to I'm transitioning
[1:19:48] you know into all of this so I might not
[1:19:50] be able to get all the way to you know
[1:19:52] my full thought today but just think
[1:19:54] about the words right holy nation
[1:19:57] peculiar people peculiar strange strange
[1:20:04] that that's who we are the Bible says
[1:20:08] that's who we are we don't act like
[1:20:10] other people we don't dress like other
[1:20:15] people when we walk we walk holy holy
[1:20:20] holy unto the Lord our sisters got this
[1:20:24] covered
[1:20:25] and they got that covered and that's not
[1:20:28] too tight and that's not too revealing
[1:20:30] even even the brothers got things
[1:20:33] covered that's not too tight that's not
[1:20:36] too revealing got a text from brother
[1:20:38] say brother you know I'm changing my
[1:20:40] whole wardrobe right because it's how I
[1:20:44] want to walk this walk holy holy holy
[1:20:48] unto the Lord come on a man yes it's
[1:20:53] gonna cause you to dress Wang brothers
[1:20:55] to put up their shorts to put on their
[1:20:57] long pants yeah I believe this holiness
[1:21:01] is certainly a lifestyle Amen it's a way
[1:21:05] of life this this holiness that's only
[1:21:07] inside should be reflected on the
[1:21:10] outside come on somebody amen you know I
[1:21:15] mean cuz you know people try to redefine
[1:21:16] holiness nowadays Amen but if you really
[1:21:20] holy on the inside it's gonna manifest
[1:21:22] itself on the outside you can look like
[1:21:25] the world and be holy you can't act like
[1:21:28] the world will be holy God holy means
[1:21:30] separate it a man so if you looking just
[1:21:34] like the world how you don't say you
[1:21:35] holy come on church it may cause us to
[1:21:41] be a holy nation and I tell you I'm not
[1:21:44] ashamed of this I'm we going to be
[1:21:47] peculiar we're gonna be strange that's
[1:21:49] exactly who we are sometimes you know
[1:21:51] people that say why y'all do this right
[1:21:53] we a holy nation a peculiar people and
[1:21:57] trust me if you ever get the baptism the
[1:21:59] Holy Ghost you also become a holy nation
[1:22:02] and a peculiar person praise the Lord
[1:22:07] it's real simple all right let me let me
[1:22:08] go on let me hear Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:11] yesterday today and forever he makes
[1:22:13] this statement
[1:22:19] he says this but now in the Old
[1:22:25] Testament there was three ways of
[1:22:26] knowing the message so back back there
[1:22:27] and Old Testament was still bringing
[1:22:30] that type over hey man there's three
[1:22:32] ways of knowing the message first it was
[1:22:34] the law that's the Word of God all right
[1:22:37] the second it was a prophet so if you
[1:22:39] want to know whether it was right just
[1:22:40] look at the Word of God if the Word of
[1:22:42] God tell you is wrong it's wrong no no
[1:22:45] no questions about if the word says is
[1:22:47] wrong is wrong hey man now we try to
[1:22:50] compromise with it and you know I heard
[1:22:53] somebody say yesterday you know people
[1:22:54] try to say well you know that was
[1:22:56] written for that time that devil is a
[1:22:58] liar got it right now just for that time
[1:23:02] God has given you his thoughts for all
[1:23:04] time and what you got to do is apply
[1:23:07] yourself appropriately Amen well that
[1:23:09] that was set for that time no no no if
[1:23:11] you if you really looking at the script
[1:23:13] you got to go back and line up to what
[1:23:14] what Israel was doing in the Old
[1:23:16] Testament if you come here our holy
[1:23:18] priesthood how you going to be a part of
[1:23:19] our holy priesthood and not know what
[1:23:21] the original priesthood was like all
[1:23:24] right come on church say man it's real
[1:23:27] it's real simple
[1:23:28] listen so so it first is the law second
[1:23:31] it was a prophet and third was a dreamer
[1:23:35] and then they had a way of proving that
[1:23:37] oh my right whether it was just exactly
[1:23:40] right or not now in the erotic or
[1:23:43] Levitical priesthood on eros breastplate
[1:23:47] had 12 stones and it's not exactly known
[1:23:51] by the scholars whether it was a
[1:23:52] reflection of the 12 stones together or
[1:23:54] a certain sacred life that when a
[1:24:00] prophet prophesied or a dreamer told his
[1:24:03] dream or whatever it was and these
[1:24:06] supernatural lights didn't flash on this
[1:24:09] wall was called was called Durham
[1:24:12] Thummim and if this supernatural light
[1:24:16] didn't class and give witness to that
[1:24:18] well then it was a wrong no matter how
[1:24:20] true the Prophet was or how real the
[1:24:23] dreamer was or whatever the revelation
[1:24:25] was it had to be witnessed by the Urim
[1:24:28] Thummim if it wasn't it wasn't true
[1:24:31] any scripture scholar knows that so you
[1:24:34] know just just to break that down when a
[1:24:36] man would have a dream or you know a
[1:24:38] profitable prophesy day become before
[1:24:40] the Urim Thummim era it was
[1:24:42] Aaron's breastplate him being a high
[1:24:43] priest this was his breastplate when
[1:24:46] they were tested when they were prophesy
[1:24:47] get dust half the Lord the Lord said
[1:24:49] this everybody turn it just look at that
[1:24:51] your own thumb it's at your own thumb
[1:24:53] him then slash that man was as good as
[1:24:56] dead and if the dream of said something
[1:25:00] and that I mean you know they're what
[1:25:02] the Lord say you had a dream okay all
[1:25:04] right all right
[1:25:07] no no flash get the rocks right get the
[1:25:13] rocks he was dying right it they
[1:25:15] wouldn't even give him a second chance
[1:25:16] to prophesy all to tell a dream he was
[1:25:19] dead immediately they didn't lay games
[1:25:22] with that so when you when you when you
[1:25:23] prophesied or you gave your dream it had
[1:25:26] to have to reflect the supernatural
[1:25:28] light had to go off the problem is we
[1:25:32] don't have one of them today because
[1:25:33] I'll tell you what if we didn't have
[1:25:34] worth it'll be a lot of dead people in
[1:25:39] the church right a lot of dead folk in
[1:25:42] the church and I mean nowadays people
[1:25:44] take prophecy like in it a prophecy
[1:25:47] ain't never come to pass
[1:25:49] it's been years for the public saying
[1:25:51] coming back
[1:25:52] and they still holding on I mean I've
[1:25:55] been waiting on this one prophecy
[1:25:56] somebody told me I'm looking for this
[1:25:58] man he got something pepper half he's
[1:26:02] full to be a very wealthy man he's
[1:26:04] supposed to give me a lot of money left
[1:26:08] sound right I went to another church
[1:26:11] they prophesied and told me and I'm
[1:26:13] waiting to say God don't give you a city
[1:26:16] why would God give me a city why why do
[1:26:20] I need a city I don't need a city
[1:26:24] anybody you know and then Oh Lord this
[1:26:26] to give me sits in you know all you got
[1:26:30] to be a man is a is a visitor in some of
[1:26:37] these searches you fear business first
[1:26:39] time they ever saw you you immediately
[1:26:42] go get Papa title
[1:26:44] or prophesy - immediately I see I mean
[1:26:49] you just you just watch our people do
[1:26:50] this type of stuff like Lord night you
[1:26:52] don't come on now come on you know you
[1:26:54] you don't be wanting to go and then just
[1:26:55] have a critical spirit and things like
[1:26:57] that but but the church has gotten away
[1:26:59] if we got back to these biblical
[1:27:01] principles people wouldn't be just so
[1:27:02] quickly prophesied if they knew that
[1:27:06] somebody has some stones waiting on them
[1:27:09] what you say thus saith the Lord
[1:27:12] alright watch the day you're them some
[1:27:15] of them flash that was it
[1:27:17] they was good intent how am I
[1:27:20] but today church we don't have that we
[1:27:23] got something else let's just keep
[1:27:24] reading
[1:27:25] ho glory to God so you got you got your
[1:27:28] own personal urine Thummim Amen said now
[1:27:34] in the Aaronic priesthood or the
[1:27:35] Levitical priesthood the priesthood that
[1:27:37] priesthood was done away with and the
[1:27:40] urine Thummim of that time ceased but it
[1:27:44] but in this new priesthood the Bible is
[1:27:49] God's room Thummim Oh glory to God
[1:27:54] churchy uh uh you know things be
[1:27:56] happening and you'd be one of them that
[1:27:58] you know I'll just you know just just
[1:28:00] hearing a testimony and you know people
[1:28:03] share things with you and you try to see
[1:28:05] how that thing register with the
[1:28:06] scripture you what's that revelation is
[1:28:11] that that's not reflect that's not
[1:28:13] coming out the Bible right that that
[1:28:15] thing the lights didn't flash you can
[1:28:19] tell quickly whether lights flashing on
[1:28:20] the inside of you right I mean like know
[1:28:23] that revelation ain't sounding just
[1:28:24] right where are you getting that from
[1:28:26] what's the source with this no no no no
[1:28:28] no no I want to go back to the Bible
[1:28:30] what the Prophet said all right listen
[1:28:35] it says um he says uh but in this new
[1:28:39] priests of the Bible is God's Yoram
[1:28:41] Summum and if a revelation comes a
[1:28:44] prophet prophesize a church is
[1:28:47] established of doctrine is made and it
[1:28:50] don't clash on the Bible then it's wrong
[1:28:52] this is God's Yoram something we must
[1:28:55] listen to the word I'm just an old fan
[1:28:57] good enough to believe that the Bible is
[1:29:00] written by inspiration and I believe
[1:29:02] every word of it is God's Living Word
[1:29:04] and you can you can rest your eternal
[1:29:06] destination on any word that's written
[1:29:09] in the Bible so seeing in Moses day
[1:29:14] Aaron's day they have that year I'm
[1:29:17] Thummim that Aaron wore you know on this
[1:29:19] breastplate
[1:29:20] but in that and underneath that precip
[1:29:22] somebody say something that they say the
[1:29:24] Lord told them if that if that those
[1:29:26] supernatural lights they're not reflect
[1:29:28] they did not listen to it and today we
[1:29:30] don't have that the supernatural lights
[1:29:32] on Aaron breastplate but we do have the
[1:29:34] supernatural Word of God and if it's not
[1:29:37] flashing with the Word of God don't you
[1:29:39] accept it hey man
[1:29:43] all right listen in the Old Testament
[1:29:47] one must be born into a certain lineage
[1:29:49] to tribal Levi to become a priest
[1:29:51] but the day one must be born again to be
[1:29:54] part of the royal priesthood once we
[1:29:58] have received the Holy Ghost we become
[1:29:59] part of a holy nation a man the Holy
[1:30:04] Ghost is what's break is what breaks
[1:30:06] down the barriers of our national
[1:30:09] heritage I like that the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:12] what breaks down the barriers of our
[1:30:14] national heritage you know because you
[1:30:16] know sometimes people based on the
[1:30:18] country they're from based on maybe even
[1:30:22] different parts of the country even in
[1:30:25] the United States people take on
[1:30:26] different spirits there's national
[1:30:28] spirits and the reason I'm this way is
[1:30:31] because we always do no no no no no no
[1:30:33] no no no when the Holy Ghost comes in it
[1:30:36] takes your natural national heritage out
[1:30:38] and it makes you a part of a holy nation
[1:30:42] oh not to not the nation that you were
[1:30:46] born is you come a part of a holy nation
[1:30:49] and when you become part of this holy
[1:30:51] nation it causes all of us all the
[1:30:54] citizens of this kingdom we dressed like
[1:30:56] we from another Kingdom we put to your
[1:30:59] people we look straight no matter who we
[1:31:02] are where we come from we think we
[1:31:03] become with the Holy Ghost we become
[1:31:05] part of this holy nation listen we talk
[1:31:11] the same with
[1:31:11] comes to the work we dress the same we
[1:31:14] act the same because God's people have
[1:31:16] always been strange now you know I was I
[1:31:20] was as I was just been meditating on the
[1:31:22] stock
[1:31:22] I just been kind of following some of
[1:31:24] the Saints here and there you know with
[1:31:26] my Instagram account and I'm watching
[1:31:28] thinks they preaching a sermon before I
[1:31:31] even get there brother Jerry posted
[1:31:34] something you know this week I'm like
[1:31:36] man he already in my notes and sister
[1:31:39] the only poster seller she in my notes I
[1:31:41] was like but that's that I was telling
[1:31:43] brother Trevor that he said that's that
[1:31:44] that's a new definitional help me preach
[1:31:46] I help me preach all right and and and I
[1:31:53] like that all right because we all kind
[1:31:55] of get in the same channel we realize
[1:31:58] what God is calling us to amen
[1:32:01] I mean and you know just have to remind
[1:32:03] you remember right now you reign with
[1:32:05] Christ you have dominion over sin you
[1:32:08] have dominion over the world
[1:32:10] you have the amendment dominion over
[1:32:12] your flesh and you also have dominion
[1:32:16] over the devil glory to God Church we
[1:32:21] are a holy nation a peculiar people I
[1:32:23] want to read this quote that sister
[1:32:24] Naomi put out there I thought it was a
[1:32:26] blessing amen this is out of reject it
[1:32:29] King listen to this
[1:32:30] glory to God he says this but the people
[1:32:33] had come to a place where they wanted to
[1:32:35] change this program they looked upon the
[1:32:38] Philistines and the Amalekites the
[1:32:40] Emirates the Hittites and the other
[1:32:41] nations of the world and they have seen
[1:32:44] that they had Kings that rule them and
[1:32:46] govern them and guided them and fought
[1:32:48] their battles and so forth and this
[1:32:50] seemed to be that Israel wanted to
[1:32:52] pattern themselves like these kings and
[1:32:55] like these people now that's the same
[1:32:56] things happen to the church where they
[1:32:58] looked on the other denominations and
[1:33:00] they want it to be like them right and
[1:33:03] that's why they've taken on those
[1:33:04] different spheres of the different
[1:33:06] denominations right because they want to
[1:33:07] be like the original denomination which
[1:33:10] was Catholic they wanted to stay in
[1:33:11] hierarchical structure and you know if
[1:33:14] anybody in my age and older
[1:33:17] we know when I used to go to church and
[1:33:20] you see that the you you always could
[1:33:23] tell the the
[1:33:24] Catholic priests from all the other
[1:33:26] preachers if it was a Pentecostal or a
[1:33:29] Baptist or you know a Lutheran or
[1:33:31] something like that you can always tell
[1:33:33] the Catholic when it was a little
[1:33:34] different the way he dressed himself
[1:33:36] right he had he had a collar on he had
[1:33:39] all kind of stuff that he was wearing
[1:33:41] and he always looked a little different
[1:33:43] than the other preachers but nowadays
[1:33:46] even in the end the Pentecostal rings I
[1:33:49] mean you got they want to make sure that
[1:33:51] you know that they're preaching they got
[1:33:54] the collar on they got the the the gold
[1:33:58] thing inside they pocket you know all
[1:34:00] that means something all of that means
[1:34:03] and oh you let a leather fella Jeff got
[1:34:06] got got he just got caught a preached
[1:34:08] yesterday and he thank you really all
[1:34:12] that now he feel like he came preaching
[1:34:14] till he come out in a row and he come
[1:34:18] out in that robe and he sit there in
[1:34:19] that chair and you just you just you
[1:34:21] know who the preacher is it's the man in
[1:34:23] the road right I mean all that stuff is
[1:34:27] Catholicism that's come right inside of
[1:34:29] church and you can't tell the difference
[1:34:31] anymore hallelujah but we're peculiar
[1:34:34] people strange folk we don't wear rules
[1:34:37] and all that other kind of stuff to try
[1:34:40] to make ourselves look if you know my
[1:34:43] holiness is not it's not just the rule
[1:34:47] that you wearing holiness Amen yes
[1:34:49] holiness does deal with your everyday
[1:34:51] dress right hold I believe holders deals
[1:34:55] with that but I think also the way that
[1:34:57] people try to make themselves holders by
[1:34:59] putting on all these clothes of priests
[1:35:00] with it's calling and I mean it just let
[1:35:03] them make you holy that don't make you
[1:35:05] whole just because you dressing like
[1:35:06] that don't make you holy if something
[1:35:08] that comes out of your heart and the
[1:35:10] other thing you got to realize it's not
[1:35:12] your holiness in the first place and
[1:35:14] it's the holiness of Almighty God and
[1:35:16] the way you became whole is because you
[1:35:19] received the Holy Ghost let's read the
[1:35:27] seem to be that Israel wanted to Pat
[1:35:29] themselves like these and like these
[1:35:31] people like these kings and like these
[1:35:33] people but it's never been this is
[1:35:35] important thing it has never been in any
[1:35:37] age God
[1:35:38] intention for his people to act like the
[1:35:41] people of the world now listen to that
[1:35:43] again it's never been in any H God's
[1:35:49] intention for his people to act like the
[1:35:53] people of the world or to be governed or
[1:35:57] controlled like the people of the world
[1:36:01] God's people is always has been a
[1:36:05] peculiar people a different people a
[1:36:08] call down a separating altogether
[1:36:10] different in their actions in their ways
[1:36:12] in their manner living than what the
[1:36:15] people of the world has their appetite
[1:36:17] for things and all that their makeup is
[1:36:20] has always been contrary to the things
[1:36:22] that the people of the world desire now
[1:36:26] that's how you know where you're part of
[1:36:28] this holy nation destroy your priesthood
[1:36:29] is when your appetite is unchanged right
[1:36:33] if you got if you still got desire a man
[1:36:35] to you know to try to fit in with the
[1:36:37] world something wrong with your
[1:36:39] experience amen you know I know
[1:36:42] sometimes we you know people get ashamed
[1:36:44] of what God's done for them and and they
[1:36:46] want to fit in with their family they
[1:36:47] want to fit in with their friends you
[1:36:49] know they just they just want to fit in
[1:36:50] but you don't realize you already fit in
[1:36:53] you fit in with us you understand you
[1:36:58] fit in with us you so you don't have to
[1:37:00] fit in with them because you fit in with
[1:37:02] us glory to God I mean I know sometimes
[1:37:05] the sisters to fit in they put on a
[1:37:07] little fingernail polish right to fit in
[1:37:10] that you know that their shortness up in
[1:37:12] short manner I mean you know you can't
[1:37:14] do that just to fit in that's not God's
[1:37:16] people never have done that
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:20] that's why I'm so careful of my posting
[1:37:23] that you're not going to get double
[1:37:24] messages from me you're not going to get
[1:37:26] a message like I'm in the world and then
[1:37:28] another message like I'm in I'm in God
[1:37:30] know it's going to be one message
[1:37:32] although I'm in God right I mean it's no
[1:37:36] it's no it's no you can't you can't be
[1:37:39] double minded you can't live on both
[1:37:42] sides of fence you can't do that you
[1:37:46] know I remember at school get ready to
[1:37:48] start again I remember a man a situation
[1:37:51] one time
[1:37:52] my life and man one year I was in school
[1:37:54] not man I want to be like everybody else
[1:37:57] I'm out there acting like everybody else
[1:37:59] and doing this like everybody else's and
[1:38:01] I had my you know I called myself a
[1:38:04] breakdancer back then and all kind of
[1:38:06] stuff and you know I mean you just you
[1:38:08] know you could go through these
[1:38:09] different phases but I remember going
[1:38:11] through that summer and God had done
[1:38:12] something special for me and when God
[1:38:15] did something special for me like no I
[1:38:17] knew right then I had to make a choice
[1:38:19] that I that I couldn't you know I
[1:38:22] couldn't go back and be the same guy was
[1:38:24] the year before otherwise the devil
[1:38:26] would have got the victory over me so I
[1:38:29] remember you know I said Lord up you
[1:38:31] know what I'm have to just I'm gonna
[1:38:33] have to be a Christian now you know what
[1:38:34] and being a Christian I had to change my
[1:38:37] associates I could hang with the same
[1:38:42] friends I had a year before I had the
[1:38:44] fire some new friends I mean they might
[1:38:47] have been a I mean other guys that was
[1:38:49] Christians they might not have went to
[1:38:51] church with me but if they was Christian
[1:38:52] they believe this Bible I was trying to
[1:38:54] hang with them I don't want to hang with
[1:38:57] my office because I knew if I got around
[1:38:59] the old friends a little pressure from
[1:39:00] the host it was it would pull me into
[1:39:04] places that I did wanna do and then I
[1:39:07] find myself retention all over again I
[1:39:09] got tired of living that kind of
[1:39:11] lifestyle
[1:39:12] so I had to let some of them friends go
[1:39:14] and I'm gonna tell you just take a just
[1:39:17] a little bit of a stand just a little
[1:39:20] bit they will let you go if you can't
[1:39:26] take a little bit of a stand they will
[1:39:28] let you go but if you don't in the world
[1:39:33] you know I'm gonna do this on sunny but
[1:39:35] that's just Sunday the other six days of
[1:39:37] the week I do something else no no no no
[1:39:40] we are a holy nation a peculiar people
[1:39:43] people are to see the difference in you
[1:39:45] and that's an everything you do not not
[1:39:48] just your sunday sunday morning face but
[1:39:51] that's an everything you do we
[1:39:53] Christians 24/7 them them priests had to
[1:39:59] offer
[1:40:00] morning and evening every day the
[1:40:03] priesthood they was offering sacrifices
[1:40:06] what we got to do the exact same thing
[1:40:08] 24 hours a day seven days a week we're
[1:40:11] interesting for others glory to God all
[1:40:15] right all right
[1:40:16] god never intended for his people to
[1:40:19] look like the world to act like the
[1:40:20] world he never intended he always wanted
[1:40:23] us to be separate always wanted to be
[1:40:25] different and that's just the way it is
[1:40:27] can't help that not even trying to
[1:40:29] change it
[1:40:29] now I want to tell you something you're
[1:40:33] gonna be somebody's fool you're gonna be
[1:40:40] somebody's fool
[1:40:42] that's what brother Jerry told us in his
[1:40:44] posts you're gonna be somebody's food
[1:40:47] now you got to choose whose fool you're
[1:40:49] gonna be one man walk around walk down
[1:40:55] the street in California had that sign
[1:40:57] on his back he said he just walking down
[1:40:59] said I'm a fool for Christ had a big
[1:41:02] sign on the front I'm a fool for Christ
[1:41:05] never I looked at him last phantom but
[1:41:08] then when you got past him you looked on
[1:41:10] the back he asked the question whose
[1:41:12] fool are you some are some are signs say
[1:41:21] I'm a fool for the devil devil just make
[1:41:24] me do whatever and I just do it
[1:41:29] he made me dress this way he made me
[1:41:31] talk like this even I just do it don't
[1:41:33] be that kind of fool be a fool for
[1:41:35] Christ Oh somebody a man all right let
[1:41:40] me let me let me pick up this side of
[1:41:41] the oddball because that's what it means
[1:41:44] amen when we talk about being a holy
[1:41:46] nation a royal priesthood we are we
[1:41:49] strangely we act funny we look funny yes
[1:41:53] that is the truth
[1:41:54] but God is pleased with it and the
[1:41:57] reason is art is because Society goes
[1:41:59] against it but the Bible speaks for it
[1:42:04] and we try to stay with the Bible right
[1:42:06] but Society speaks against it that's why
[1:42:08] ah because everybody else out there
[1:42:10] doing something else but I'm not doing
[1:42:13] it because everybody else doing it my
[1:42:16] parents just saying well if your friends
[1:42:18] jump off a bridge you're gonna jump with
[1:42:19] them
[1:42:21] and we process that from a natural
[1:42:24] standpoint right but we also need the
[1:42:27] process that from a spiritual standpoint
[1:42:28] because some if your friend if your
[1:42:31] friend is going to live a life that's
[1:42:32] gonna take them to hell you're gonna
[1:42:33] live the same life and go with them amen
[1:42:39] that's for the young people for you go
[1:42:41] back to school think about it because
[1:42:42] you are a holy priesthood a holy war
[1:42:46] priests and a holy nation amen that's
[1:42:49] who you are
[1:42:50] I'm telling what the scriptures say you
[1:42:51] are and ain't no way you can go back
[1:42:54] into that old lifestyle anymore once you
[1:42:58] get free you better stay free let's look
[1:43:01] at this
[1:43:02] the otball I want to read since then I
[1:43:06] thought by reading this and thinking
[1:43:09] thinking on this place up here this
[1:43:12] coming my mind says Paul saying I have
[1:43:14] become a fool Paul making the statement
[1:43:17] and you you know you would find that in
[1:43:19] 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7
[1:43:22] through 14 Paul a great leader of that
[1:43:25] day he makes a statement I have become a
[1:43:29] fool a great religious man religiously
[1:43:34] the knew so much about the Word of God
[1:43:36] but he makes that statement I think that
[1:43:39] that's something that we have I mean
[1:43:41] when we had a real true experience with
[1:43:43] God we have the same type of statement I
[1:43:46] have become a fool for Christ listen I
[1:43:51] have become a fool see now that's a very
[1:43:53] strange thing for an apostle to say I
[1:43:55] have become a fool now a fool is a
[1:43:57] person that really isn't in their right
[1:43:59] mind and how would this apostle say such
[1:44:02] a thing I've become a fool and thinking
[1:44:04] of this group no doubt that in the eyes
[1:44:06] of the people on the other side you've
[1:44:09] become a fool you have become what we
[1:44:13] would call today v oddball no doubt but
[1:44:16] what people think of that of you and
[1:44:18] remember that on the other side there
[1:44:21] are bowls not just depends on how you
[1:44:23] look at it right I mean they looking at
[1:44:25] you as an eyeball but I look at them and
[1:44:26] say y'all are most right since their
[1:44:30] eyeballs to see so you have to you have
[1:44:32] to be
[1:44:33] Matis fool so I'd rather be a fool for
[1:44:36] Christ see God said his people were a
[1:44:39] peculiar people are a chosen elected a
[1:44:43] royal priesthood offering spiritual
[1:44:45] sacrifices to God that is the fruit of
[1:44:48] our lips giving praise to his name you
[1:44:52] got to choose whose fool you're going to
[1:44:53] be listen to this there's some time ago
[1:44:55] this little sense of humor I hope it
[1:44:57] doesn't break the fine spirit that's in
[1:44:59] here just come on my mind it was brother
[1:45:01] Troy the Full Gospel businessman was
[1:45:04] telling about this he said I was
[1:45:07] thinking of this for this young young
[1:45:09] singer here that's just come to the Lord
[1:45:11] he was working in he's a meat cutter and
[1:45:14] he was working in a butcher shop and
[1:45:15] this was a German there and he and he
[1:45:19] just kept talking to talking to him
[1:45:21] about the Lord and this German couldn't
[1:45:23] couldn't talk English very well they
[1:45:26] said well he come come on to the
[1:45:27] meetings that you need the baptism of
[1:45:29] the Holy Ghost and I'm saying the same
[1:45:30] thing you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:33] Ghost he said so the old Dutchman want
[1:45:35] him to know that he was a Lutheran you
[1:45:37] see he was he was all right he you know
[1:45:39] they say when you come on up and you
[1:45:41] visit us once my god just get to the
[1:45:44] service once it says and so they came
[1:45:46] across a bunch of perhaps oddballs
[1:45:49] - as we call it you see and and that
[1:45:51] night this German man received the
[1:45:53] bachelor oligos one service the man
[1:45:56] walks into one service and received the
[1:45:59] Baptist when Holy Ghost what an
[1:46:00] atmosphere huh right it says in the next
[1:46:03] day he was cutting meat and speaking in
[1:46:06] tongues and singing he was having him a
[1:46:08] regular Jubilee we talk about God
[1:46:11] changing phone so after a while the boss
[1:46:15] of the factor come I said Henry say
[1:46:17] what's the matter with he said Oh glory
[1:46:19] to God said I got saved he said why I
[1:46:22] said where you been so you must have
[1:46:24] been down there with that bunch of nuts
[1:46:26] he said listen say yes glory to God
[1:46:31] said I was down there with with a bunch
[1:46:33] of nuts he said you know if you didn't
[1:46:36] have the nuts says you take take like
[1:46:38] the automobile that comes down the road
[1:46:39] and you take all the nuts out of it you
[1:46:42] what you got but a bunch of young now
[1:46:46] the man can speak in
[1:46:47] where he was trying to say you got a
[1:46:48] bunch of junk you need nuts to keep that
[1:46:51] thing together
[1:46:52] the reason the family is staying
[1:46:55] together cuz you got some nuts inside
[1:46:59] the family that don't mind living for
[1:47:01] God and when things go wrong you go
[1:47:04] right to the night there's another
[1:47:10] tightness hang up for you a little bit
[1:47:13] either keep it together
[1:47:15] you take the nut pocket or fall apart
[1:47:19] glory to God glory to God
[1:47:21] a man Church I'm so glad I'm a knight
[1:47:25] you don't be a fool but you got to
[1:47:28] choose whether you're gonna be a fool
[1:47:30] for Christ or fool for the demo say what
[1:47:33] you got but a bunch of young that's just
[1:47:36] about right you take the nut side
[1:47:37] anything that takes that to a whole
[1:47:40] thing together the world gets in such a
[1:47:44] place and turn the turmoil and the
[1:47:46] church gets so sold up in worldly ISM
[1:47:49] and denominationalism and so forth till
[1:47:52] it takes some time to nut the whole
[1:47:54] thing together that's right if they
[1:47:55] don't have it we don't have it we don't
[1:47:57] have the church now we can think of that
[1:47:59] subject just for a few moments Paul said
[1:48:01] I have become a fool or a nut now you
[1:48:04] have to become somebody's nut you can
[1:48:07] either be a nut for the world or a nut
[1:48:09] for Christ I you know you came v in
[1:48:14] between there is no in-between there is
[1:48:18] no when it's when you die if you live in
[1:48:21] for God you go to heaven if you're not
[1:48:23] living for God you go to hell there is
[1:48:25] no in-between glory to God
[1:48:27] right you I mean he it goes on to stay
[1:48:30] one day in California was walking down
[1:48:32] the street there was a man he had a sign
[1:48:33] on front of him set like this I'm a fool
[1:48:35] for Christ on his back he had a sign
[1:48:36] that said now whose fool of you see so
[1:48:39] so we asked him on it that you have to
[1:48:42] be somebody's fool you got to make a
[1:48:45] choice now I'm going to tell you it's
[1:48:47] the Holy Ghost that gives you strength
[1:48:48] in order to be able to walk around a man
[1:48:53] like a holy nation a a man a peculiar
[1:48:58] people it's the Holy Ghost that give you
[1:48:59] strength to do that
[1:49:00] and for every young person you know
[1:49:03] heading back in school don't be ashamed
[1:49:06] of what God has done for you don't be a
[1:49:09] dolt don't don't don't don't don't don't
[1:49:10] don't be ashamed he has pulled you out
[1:49:12] of darkness and put you into his
[1:49:15] marvelous light the other person still
[1:49:17] walking in darkness
[1:49:18] but since he's done that now he wants to
[1:49:20] use your life amen
[1:49:22] he he I mean when he called when he
[1:49:24] called Israel he said you know y'all
[1:49:25] gonna be my peculiar treasure my special
[1:49:28] people I'm gonna do special things for
[1:49:30] y'all y'all gonna do things together and
[1:49:31] I'm not doing for any of the other
[1:49:32] nations God calls him out specifically
[1:49:35] in the same way he called him out as
[1:49:37] he's calling us out making us a holy
[1:49:40] nation that's nothing to be disappointed
[1:49:42] about when a man finds a bride a man he
[1:49:47] finds he looks all through the world and
[1:49:50] he finds one woman that he feels is
[1:49:52] going to be the woman a man for him and
[1:49:55] when he makes that proposal to her he's
[1:49:58] not looking for nobody else to fulfill
[1:50:00] you know that I mean his heart saying
[1:50:02] this is the woman that's for me and I'm
[1:50:04] totally satisfied where the young lady
[1:50:07] that receives that proposal she's not
[1:50:09] ashamed that the young man acts hurt
[1:50:11] especially she loves him that's the man
[1:50:13] that she want to be with right so I mean
[1:50:16] in it and if we really want to be with
[1:50:18] Christ we don't have to be ashamed to be
[1:50:21] a holy people right we don't have to be
[1:50:24] ashamed a man to be a you know a
[1:50:26] peculiar people holy nation a peculiar
[1:50:29] people we don't have to we like to be
[1:50:30] ashamed we can hold our heads up high
[1:50:32] amen because God has made the difference
[1:50:35] in my lives
[1:50:36] all right glory to God let me just say
[1:50:39] something here and we'll we'll come out
[1:50:41] a man here today when we talk about this
[1:50:46] holiness we got to be very careful
[1:50:51] because you know as I bring him the tune
[1:50:55] of Israel there was a quote in the
[1:50:56] Philadelphia interchange I won't read it
[1:50:58] all but brother branham you know makes
[1:51:00] it very clear that the the Jews got to a
[1:51:05] point because God had called them you
[1:51:09] know to a specific places you know and
[1:51:11] when I'm sharing with us is that God
[1:51:13] certainly has called us
[1:51:14] they say you are chosen generation a
[1:51:16] royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:51:19] peculiar people that you should show
[1:51:20] forth the praises of him that called you
[1:51:22] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:51:24] but when we when we realize who we are
[1:51:26] in Christ we got to be very careful and
[1:51:29] always stay humble before God because
[1:51:32] the Jews got to a place when God called
[1:51:34] them out and made them a elected or
[1:51:37] selected a chosen nation that they were
[1:51:39] if the brother Branham says that they
[1:51:41] say the Jews have always called
[1:51:44] themselves the children of God it says
[1:51:47] it said they got to a place where they
[1:51:50] begin to exclude everybody else they
[1:51:55] begin to exclude everybody else
[1:51:57] now we're not we're not the life that we
[1:51:59] live in is not to exclude anybody but
[1:52:02] this life is actually to include other
[1:52:04] people amen but we realize that that you
[1:52:07] know when when when when we want we
[1:52:09] don't want to walk around with us
[1:52:10] without with our chest acad our heads
[1:52:12] upper you know where we got such a
[1:52:15] manner
[1:52:15] arrogant spirit about that that's not
[1:52:20] what this is to produce is not the
[1:52:21] bridge you know brother man so you got -
[1:52:23] you got a void a person with an arrogant
[1:52:25] spirit oh my god you actually got to run
[1:52:29] for your life when you see a person with
[1:52:31] a spirit of arrogance you got to run
[1:52:33] from them and unfortunately I think the
[1:52:35] church has come to that point sometimes
[1:52:37] we get that arrogance spirits but that's
[1:52:40] not why we try we're not trying to
[1:52:42] exclude anybody we're trying to include
[1:52:44] everybody but now when we include you we
[1:52:47] need you to understand with this little
[1:52:49] bag you know I felt about I said boy I
[1:52:50] tell you what I say because of what the
[1:52:53] blood has done to make us kings and
[1:52:55] priests you know if the devil himself
[1:52:59] got washed in the blood you know that
[1:53:02] devil himself would not be the devil
[1:53:05] anymore the devil would be my brother in
[1:53:09] Christ if he was washed in the same
[1:53:13] blood I was like we're not trying to
[1:53:15] exclude we try to include but you got to
[1:53:18] go through the process you can't be a
[1:53:22] holy nation you can't be a peculiar
[1:53:24] people if you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:53:28] see brother branham say you know you
[1:53:32] could tell the person that god you can
[1:53:33] talk to about two minutes and find out
[1:53:35] whether they got of the night you found
[1:53:37] out what they spirit feed on he said you
[1:53:39] go to a man's office see what he got
[1:53:42] picked up on the wall what type of
[1:53:43] pictures he got up on his wall you can
[1:53:46] tell whether the man with his feet know
[1:53:49] so now you can got to go to the office
[1:53:51] you just pick up their cell phone and
[1:53:54] you start sorting through you listen to
[1:53:57] the music that they listen to right amen
[1:54:00] and you know if if you're if you're if
[1:54:02] your child can't just walk in and just
[1:54:04] give you their cell phone
[1:54:05] you know something wrong right there hey
[1:54:10] man if they just can't go through that
[1:54:12] you can go through that I ain't got no
[1:54:14] problem with it now some of them get
[1:54:15] real bold and they oh yeah I'm gonna let
[1:54:17] you go through and take me down here
[1:54:18] something the Holy Ghost will always
[1:54:20] show you all right somebody a man the
[1:54:25] Holy Ghost will pick that bank up
[1:54:27] revealing like that what is this you're
[1:54:28] not you like acting like a holy nation
[1:54:31] you're not acting like a peculiar person
[1:54:33] you're doing the same thing they doing
[1:54:36] come on somebody I don't even know all
[1:54:38] the artists nowadays but young people
[1:54:40] y'all better not be going back to learn
[1:54:41] that music you know you're out your
[1:54:46] iPhone your your droid your iPad it
[1:54:49] shouldn't have the same music that the
[1:54:51] world got in it yours should be praise
[1:54:53] and worship exalting Christ now we don't
[1:54:56] got this blended stuff now can I tell
[1:54:59] you our you know bless blend it now I
[1:55:01] mean and that we got we got what we call
[1:55:03] gospel rap that's from the devil and
[1:55:07] when we start bringing all those things
[1:55:09] together right that's that's it if you
[1:55:10] if you listen to the beats from the
[1:55:12] world and listen to the beats of the
[1:55:14] church which one is different if some
[1:55:18] time I ain't got to be rap it can be
[1:55:20] just a Kurt Franklin song Kurt Franklin
[1:55:23] you know man what soon as he came out
[1:55:25] with stump that somebody should have
[1:55:27] knew right there something is wrong with
[1:55:29] this man so spirit behind this if they
[1:55:33] can play this music in a club and in a
[1:55:36] church is not something wrong
[1:55:38] you know something wrong the glory God
[1:55:41] don't come down and this we supposed to
[1:55:43] be a peculiar people we don't act like
[1:55:46] the rest of the world hey man I mean you
[1:55:49] know I you know and even you know when
[1:55:51] you when you just listen to this that
[1:55:52] the the first thing he say out the song
[1:55:54] for those of you that think gospel music
[1:55:56] has gone too far
[1:55:58] pretty much they say you ain't heard
[1:56:00] nothing yet and that was just the
[1:56:04] beginning of it never a whoa what do you
[1:56:06] what'd he say was you should have turned
[1:56:09] the radio off right then we get that
[1:56:13] stuff in our spirit but we'll peculiar

[2:01:40] environment if you if you'll peculiar
[2:01:44] person you spoil the act to kill you you
[2:01:46] supposed to look peculiar act acute
[2:01:48] useful to be useful to be in a certain
[2:01:50] place in Christ where they don't even
[2:01:51] want you at the party
[2:01:52] I can I say that again you supposed to
[2:01:58] be at a certain level in your walk with
[2:02:00] Christ where they do not want you at the
[2:02:03] party because they don't have paqu you
[2:02:09] bring light and darkness
[2:02:11] all right Church I'm talk about this
[2:02:14] with church people
[2:02:15] used to look like you new church vote
[2:02:18] when you saw them they they came in they
[2:02:20] I mean just by the way that they dress
[2:02:22] is the way they care of themselves and
[2:02:24] you know no no we can't do that in front
[2:02:26] not folk don't care okay because
[2:02:28] they haven't seen so much costing so
[2:02:30] much clothing so much fate you know the
[2:02:32] law it preaches the drinking and
[2:02:38] preachers doing all kind of stuff that
[2:02:40] that you know it's totally against God's
[2:02:43] Word
[2:02:43] I had a preacher just confess the other
[2:02:45] night about something they did I say no
[2:02:48] you didn't say that in front all these
[2:02:50] people that's all did what going to
[2:02:55] conventions and and and and and and
[2:02:58] cheating on their wives it's supposed to
[2:03:00] be a preacher going to convention with a
[2:03:01] bunch of preachers make cheating on
[2:03:02] their wives at the convention and folks
[2:03:05] just go to that church like it ain't
[2:03:06] nothing God calls us to be holy I tell
[2:03:16] you what I I realized it's the Holy
[2:03:18] Ghost that's making the difference let
[2:03:20] me just finish reading a couple things
[2:03:21] here and i'ma come out
[2:03:25] I'm in the Philadelphia Church H I'm in
[2:03:29] paragraph 290 2-1 there's a scripture
[2:03:36] there that goes along with this age this
[2:03:38] revelation 3 7 says unto the angel the
[2:03:41] church and Fidler's up here write these
[2:03:42] things and he that is holy he that is
[2:03:44] true he that hath the key of David he
[2:03:46] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[2:03:47] shutteth no man open it he that is holy
[2:03:50] is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:52] look at this says a man of that age and
[2:03:55] even today we're making the same mistake
[2:03:57] as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue
[2:04:00] form of worship so in the Philadelphia
[2:04:03] age they were taking refuge in the
[2:04:05] church it is not joining a church that
[2:04:08] counts the life is not in the church the
[2:04:12] life is in Christ this is the record
[2:04:15] that God had given us eternal life and
[2:04:17] this life is in his son and he had he
[2:04:20] that hath the son hath life and he that
[2:04:21] hath not the son hath not life man is
[2:04:24] made holy by the spear
[2:04:26] it is the spirit of holiness that raised
[2:04:29] Jesus from the dead and that end Wells
[2:04:32] us and makes us holy with His Holiness a
[2:04:36] man I'm going down to paragraph 292 -
[2:04:40] for he says I'm saying I'm so I'm so
[2:04:44] glad that my holiness is not of myself
[2:04:47] I'm glad that I am in Christ with all of
[2:04:51] his wonderful attributes of
[2:04:52] righteousness imputed ya imparted unto
[2:04:54] me blessed be God forever Church I tell
[2:04:58] you what we have a we the Holy Ghost has
[2:05:01] made a tremendous difference in our
[2:05:03] hearts and if you've never experienced
[2:05:05] the baptism Holy Ghost you ought to be
[2:05:07] crying out to God Lord let me have let
[2:05:10] me have that the Holy Ghost is what
[2:05:12] makes a difference you even this quote
[2:05:16] that I just read you know they were the
[2:05:19] Jews back there were taking refuge that
[2:05:21] they were just you know had a synagogue
[2:05:23] they were joining the synagogue they had
[2:05:25] a form of worship I was telling earlier
[2:05:27] we're doing some things and that's great
[2:05:29] but God trying to take us further in him
[2:05:31] a little deeper right don't don't just
[2:05:34] stop at where you are God wants to go
[2:05:36] further deeper I mean get you so lost in
[2:05:40] him that the devil can't find you that's
[2:05:43] what God wants to do so church I want to
[2:05:45] encourage you please a man go all the
[2:05:48] way with God I mean this is the blood
[2:05:51] the blood amen it looses from our sins
[2:05:54] but it's also placed us a man in a
[2:05:56] position where we can be kings we can be
[2:05:59] priests Peter says the chosen generation
[2:06:02] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[2:06:06] peculiar people amen this is who we are
[2:06:09] don't be ashamed of who we are less less
[2:06:12] walking all that God got for us
[2:06:14] amen I want to encourage you god bless
[2:06:17] your church let's like word a prayer
[2:06:18] amen
[2:06:20] this morning thank you Jesus father we
[2:06:26] are grateful Lord for of the word that
[2:06:32] that is called us we're grateful for the
[2:06:34] blood that is washed us and looseness
[2:06:38] and it keeps us as your prophet taught
[2:06:42] us the blood didn't save us but
[2:06:45] certainly the blood is what's keeping us
[2:06:48] it was it was grace that saved us but
[2:06:52] the blood is now keeping us and father
[2:06:55] and my prayer is that as we've been
[2:06:58] watched in this blood that we would not
[2:07:01] be ashamed of who we are
[2:07:04] yea we are different the Bible says that
[2:07:07] we're supposed to be different we are a
[2:07:08] holy nation we are a peculiar people we
[2:07:12] do strange things it's totally against
[2:07:15] what the world does but yet it's what
[2:07:18] you've called us to we don't have to be
[2:07:20] ashamed with that we don't have to be
[2:07:23] ashamed and God we we are we were
[2:07:26] inclusive not exclusive we want to see
[2:07:28] other people get washed in the same
[2:07:31] blood and see their lives change just
[2:07:32] the same way it changed ours Satan has
[2:07:36] so much to offer the people Satan has so
[2:07:39] many tricks and so many things Lord that
[2:07:42] he just wants to present to the people
[2:07:43] in and oftentimes we're just not
[2:07:46] spiritual enough to kind of catch what
[2:07:48] the devil is doing but I pray that the
[2:07:49] Holy Ghost would anoint our
[2:07:51] understanding that we would recognize
[2:07:54] every trick of the devil that Lord we
[2:07:57] will walk according to your word this is
[2:08:01] a very unique place to be a chosen
[2:08:05] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[2:08:07] nation a peculiar people very very
[2:08:12] special place to be and let us never
[2:08:16] ever be ashamed to pray O God that you
[2:08:21] would help us Lord especially youth as
[2:08:23] they prepare to go back into school God
[2:08:27] the devil going to be right there
[2:08:28] waiting on them got all kind of stuff to
[2:08:31] offer to them and got my prayers that
[2:08:33] you would give them strength daily God
[2:08:37] to overcoming enemy just as the priest
[2:08:39] with daily offer the sacrifices of the
[2:08:42] people and daily stand in the gap Lord
[2:08:45] we want to daily keep the young people
[2:08:48] in the prayer we want to see them daily
[2:08:50] father live a
[2:08:52] - your word god it's a it's not Lord
[2:08:55] sometimes and it's every day we got to
[2:08:58] walk this walk our lives has got to cry
[2:09:02] out holy holy holy unto the Lord not
[2:09:08] unto Mama's not unto Daddy
[2:09:10] but it's unto the Lord not unto pastor
[2:09:13] it's unto the Lord helped us got to live
[2:09:17] that kind of life we ask it all in the
[2:09:22] name of Jesus amen praise the name of
[2:09:33] the Lord
[2:09:35] amen I pray that God would give each one
[2:09:40] especially I youth given strength the
[2:09:43] Prophet told us that in this day is some
[2:09:46] well actually he said in his day said it
[2:09:50] was one way for him but he said the next
[2:09:54] generation will be 10 times worse for
[2:09:55] that chip that next generation and now
[2:09:57] we're beyond that day and so I would
[2:10:01] just you know I think it's been
[2:10:02] magnified 100 times worse for young
[2:10:04] people today to try to get through some
[2:10:07] of the things they're going through and
[2:10:08] we you know to the youth we don't it's
[2:10:14] not that we ignore amen and don't
[2:10:18] understand you know the trials and
[2:10:20] tribulations that they're going through
[2:10:21] we realize is the same devil with the
[2:10:24] same tricks and we realize it's going to
[2:10:26] take the Word of God and experience with
[2:10:28] God amen to overcome the enemy once we
[2:10:32] see state the intensifying his attack
[2:10:33] God also promises to intensify his
[2:10:36] attack so all we need is the true
[2:10:38] experience with God and that's what
[2:10:40] takes care of amen that's what gives us
[2:10:43] the victory amen let's say amen stand
