say amen amen thank you musicians amen I appreciate it was going to try to sing a little song but my wife said don't you to do [Music] it amen so uh I won't attempt it this time but I want if you take take your Bibles um have a I'm GNA read one scripture then I'll let you sit because I have a lot of scriptures here that I I want to read amen we'll start Revelations the 5th [Music] chapter amen starting at the first verse and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seal thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much but because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of Judah has prevailed and the root of and of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof you may be seated the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his [Music] word i' like to title this message weat not [Music] and if I give an inspiration he's going to wipe away all your tears amen um I want to go back and um trying to just see here in the order that I want to read these scriptures that I have he bear with me I have a few scriptures to read that's going to sort of tie this thing together and uh Luke the 13th chapter uh and the 25th verse when Once the master of the house is risen upon has shut the when Once the Master of the House is risen up and has shut to the door and ye began to stand without and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you I know you not when ye whence she are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drank in thy presence and thou H has taught in the streets but ye shall say but he shall say I tell you I know you not when ye are depart from me ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourself thrust out and they shall come and they shall come from east and west and from North and from South and shall sit down in the kingdom of God now I want you to notice the new two contrast of the previous scriptures that I've read there's one group amen that uh there was much weeping and there was another group that God told to weep not right for The Lion and the tribe of Judah has prevailed amen so there'll be a group weeping and there'll be another group that he told to weep not I want to be in that group that he say weep not Hallelujah and dry up every tear but amen uh I want to go back and uh read another scripture here that our pastor has been reading read it from Luke the fourth chapter he was taking it from Isaiah 61 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and my God as his custom he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read now I want to I I have to address it was custom right yes sir for him to go to church on Sunday right that was customary right and it's still customary today amen [Music] so there we have a scripture on what the pastor was talking about on [Music] Wednesday that a lot of times we there are times when we have our Ox in the ditch and we have to but a true Christian come on wants to go to church amen right wants to be in [Music] fellowship with the Saints and with the Lord so you see here even Jesus went to church no doubt he was [Music] busy no doubt he had other things to do right oh yes but it was custom come on to go to church on Sunday yes sir and he uh went there and he read and there was delivered unto unto him the book of the prophets and when he opened the book so the priest gave him the [Music] book and obviously the book was closed when he gave it to him all right it took him to open the book and he said when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor one he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted two to preach Deliverance to the captives and recover sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and all eyes all the eyes the eyes of all them were in the synagogue fasten upon him now I notti want you to notice that he came for a specific reason he was identifying who he was and what he was coming to do yes sir amen yes but see just like the people then I believe a lot of times people today miss [Music] it we we we we take these things and a lot of times we look at them literal but that there was a spirit application there yes sir yes sir that the people couldn't understand right and he closed the book and gave it back to the to the priest so the book was closed he opened the book then closed it again cuz it wasn't time for the book to remain open there had to be some things take place yes sir true amen amen I want to read another a little passage of scripture here amen John 21 says after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias and on this wise he showed he himself there were to there were together Simon Peter Thomas called dimus and Nathaniel and Kaa in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of the disciples Simon Peter said unto them I go fishing they said unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into the ship immediately and that night they caught nothing I know how that feel but when the morning had come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus Luke 24 starting at the 27th verse and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures and uh things that concern himself and they drew nigh unto the village where where uh the village there went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward the evening time and the day is far spent it's toward the evening and the day is far spent right and he went in to T with them now I want to bring something out very important in this Pat of the scripture amen as he walked with them they constrained him they didn't just have haard the say it stay with us all right brother and let it just go come on they constrained him yes sir yes that's a strong word yeah they I stay with me pass me not oh gentle savior am don't stay I'm enjoying this Hall this conversation that we're having uh is blessing me stay for a while yes sir amen and they con straighten them they wouldn't take no for an answer that's right yes sir oh my Hallelujah are you constraining him to come in and abide with you yes Lord and it came to pass and he sat at meat with them and he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them then their eyes was open Hallelujah and they knew him yes yes yes yes yes but first before they could get to this point they had to invite him in Lord have mercy hallah yes sir right amen they had to constrain him come and break bread with us now you see the the ones before time at one they knew him not oh my God but now because they as constrained him to come in abide with us their eyes was open Hall there are a lot of people they're not constraining it the doors closed but they got things to do that they they they they too busy oh my they're not desperate enough they're not constraining him come in and abide with me that I may know you [Music] amen because see you can't understand the things of God Amen without having him on the inside now I could tell you but I want to read it the prophet said now man in his carnal condition and his mental conception he always pulls himself away from God it's been that time since the beginning see means to understand Jesus except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of [Music] God so man is bound in a prison behind their ecclesiastical walls and it's man he puts himself under bondage under his through his traditions and that has been since the world began and he is shut up in a prison house amen bear with me amen so we see man cannot understand god without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the message indictment the prophet said I'm not indicting the sinner he said I indict this bunch of clergy he said I indict this generation for crucifying the Lord again Jesus now that's in our day but we know back that 2,000 years ago the same thing happened yes sir They Crucified our Lord now there was a there's there was a a a pre H uh crucifixion Ministry which which which which which would fall under the first pool and the second pool it drew big crowds it drew big crowds and the people followed him and they was just all so happy with him amen but once it went it began to the the ministry begin to change to the opening of the word see he had to be crucified he had to be the first wave sheath yes sir amen amen he had to have the first resurrection Amen in other words it was the inoculation amen it was the medicine that was needed to take us out of of the bondage that we were in that's right amen amen but see like any good pharmacist yeah amen because sometime medicine is mixed with a little bit of good and a little bit of poison see because it has to kill something and and feed another all right so it's it's a balance a balance said we got brother brother Quake who back there he's a pharmacist so you depending on the person some of the things that they're already have the condition that they're already in the weight things like that it has to be tweaked for the individual sir a little bit wrong way you can kill a man but if it's just right it'll bring healing to your soul amen amen but Jesus was so confident he took his first inoculate he was the first taker of the medicine all right he said I'll take it first amen and he did he crucified laid on hung out on the cross amen and was resurrected M amen so we see amen I want you to imagine this man Barabas who amen was a radical amen probably put together some of the first protests on on and feel like through he was going to change things through carnal means so they sharpen swords to go on the offense to fight and I was looking at it I think they said he killed a centurion Soldier he was a murderer and he was found guilty amen yes sir they locked him up in prison they took him down in Chains of bondage but as OB Barabbas was sitting there behind the Prison Walls waiting on his execution one day he hear the soldiers come chains rattling dragging their Spears on the ground he knew that this is it fear begin to grip him I'm sure at that time over rabs begin to think on his ways sir maybe said at that point I would have done things [Music] different so they open the jail bars open the door and read him his pardon oh the rabbit was stood there stunned wait a minute what's happening he say you're pardon you can go free and this man was guilty and he knew he was guilty said the people chose you and he said see that man hanging Yonder over there on that cross bloody beaten gobs of spit hanging from his face he took took your place my God he took your place and we walk around in bondage today oh but he took your [Music] place he took your place the prophet was talking about amen through Traditions we're put in a prison house he said many times tradition shuts off the people people before God can ever have a chance to get to them and reveal himself to them now the prophet said now a man is in a prison God said that a man was a prisoner so until something has happened to that man that before the certain thing called the new birth ever happened was the man he cannot no ways understand or ever understand God or never have knowledge of God though the word speaks his mind can't comprehend it because it's a human mind he got to have the mind of God Amen so you have to be able to hear you have to be able to hear in order to understand many times we come to church and we we we we can't hear God because our ears our ears are closed what am I saying these ears are for [Music] listening but your heart is for receiving yes sir yes sir no more than this microphone this microphone has no intelligence to it I can't think with my ears right true I can't see God with my ears I have to be able to take these things and as the god uses these things he's using his mic to amplify my voice but the words are coming from my heart the words are coming from the word of God Amen and it has to keep going through these different faculties in from my mouth to your ears and down into your heart before it's real exactly amen yes it has to be decoded and put back together in your heart then you can say Amen so the listing you're trying to receive it in your heart but without the Holy Ghost you you can't even receive it in your heart like I say you come to come to church and you hear the preacher say certain things and you're looking at the man and there all of these things that are are hindering you from receiving it in your heart see the devil will come between the time it leaves my mouth and go through all of these things sometime it gets distorted that's right our sound Engineers can attest to that that if everything is not connected just right that sound will be distorted and you can't receive the message amen the Devil is a distorter of sound yes he is before it ever gets to your heart he's trying to distort it why how through something that happened you come maybe a little upset he's trying to distort the S right on and keep it from getting into your heart M amen all wounds that you may be carrying amen amen it's kind of like a cord that's pitched amen that would distort the message from getting to your heart my God Amen things that may have happened throughout the week that's why you have to come to church pray up amen with your heart clear so that there's no Distortion amen right L and you can receive what God is saying so we see these men amen went into the house and spake with Jesus and upon that upon leaving they knew who he was I'm reminded on Mount Transfiguration when uh Elijah Moses Jesus appeared the first thing they wanted to do was make another denomination yeah but he they was he stopped them and said this is my beloved Son here ye him right now they only had one commandment was to hear yes sir oh my that's the only thing they were commanded to do is to hear but let me REM mind you you can't hear amen if there's a cord disconnected you can't hear if there's nothing amen something that's cutting off the path come on Amen you can't hear neither can you understand in this hour the things of God that's true he wants you to be with those with that crying group oh but unless you can understand and hear the voice of God there'll be no change now there's many voices there's a loud voice of politics in the land that's why he said I indict the clergy of this day because they are putting people in bondage they're clogging up the channel yes sir amen and the people don't know what to believe and the problem is it's anointed yes sir it's anointed and it sounds good but it's like two microphones speaking at the same time you can't make out nothing you can't hear the voice of God because you're trying to decipher which one do I hear I can't hear I hear them both and it's confusing and God is not the author of [Music] confusion but you have to come with your ears open God is speaking in this hour [Music] and he wants you to know him amen but there's too many voices amen he say they deny his word amen they deny his power they deny his Creeds amen and and take amen a intellectual conception remember Eve was no longer fortified behind the word the pure word there was no Distortion but she got from behind it and listen to the devil's lie right amen and caus all of the trouble that we're in today that's right amen cause all the weep and I I I no doubt that the first weep amen is when Adam and and and and and and Eve realized they lost a child there was weeping but before that there was no weeping didn't even know nothing about cry there was no [Music] hurt every day was joyous and happy yes sir but God is going going to wipe all the tears away and I don't believe sometime when you hear things like that I say when time heals all things this is going to be an eternal wiping there'll be no more hurt no sir my God there'll be no more pain but you have to be able to hear him amen amen the prophet said here why are we so tsed about 81 now you truly have two different mental faculties you have one of them that's in your head by your brain and the other one is operated in your heart which is called your soul your spirit and your soul now they are very much in disagreement many times when the head seems to say something the soul wonders at it if it's not right but when it comes to the soul the head seem to take a step back amen so you have to be able to hear amen with your heart yes sir word says He that has an ear my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but pass from Death unto life he that [Music] heareth amen hear my he he that hears my word and believe Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God now I'm not talking about hearing with your ears you got to get past that yes sir this is a for listening your eyes are for looking and not seeing your ears areer listening but not hearing right your heart this is where it's trying to get to not from your brain a lot of people think science feels that that that that the goes to your your eyes and into your brain and it kind of stops there no that's where the devil at that's right you take a mental conception but the control tower is in the heart yes sir Lord created in me a clean heart that I may know you in this hour so we have to amen uh I don't want to get ahead of myself now we see that there's a post Resurrection Christ uh post-resurrection Ministry and uh let me read the scripture here and at the end of the Sabbath as it began I'm I'm sorry reading from Matthew 28 uh first chapter and at the end of the Sabbath it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week and Came Mary Magdalene and the other other Mary to see the sepulture and behold there was a great earthquake and the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his reignment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shape and became as dead men and the and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not for I know that you seek Jesus which is crucified he is not here for He Is Risen as he said come and see the place where the Lord lay amen he had risen I want to go on to uh same message why we so talked about amen uh I'm not sure which paragraph it is start out with uh then he taken me uh from there the prophet was talking about the vision that he had said he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a tent and it was packed and lined everywhere with people and I walked out and looked like I was standing above the people looking down and I just made an altar call and hundreds of uh people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior and I looked and then heard a man get up saying call the prayer line and the people begin to line up on this side the left from where I was looking down toward the platform and they lined up the way uh the way up down the street for a prayer line now notice the vision was portraying him as a healing campaign and the great tent meeting amen was going on Amen so I noticed to my left which would have been to to the left which would have been my right if I was on the platform a wooden building and I seen that light that all they have the picture of you know uh that's always in the meetings and I seen that like leave me and go into that building and go into the building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull and mean now we know that the third pull was the opening of the word which of course is the highest order of a prophet I said why he said well it won't be a public show and I came too amen so it won't be a public show in this hour amen it has to be a personal relationship between you and God it has to be personal it has to you have to go into that building amen it has to come into you right right enter that secret chamber right sir amen for you to be able to understand what's going on in this house amen into that chamber of your heart you must receive him he's knocking at the door in order to understand and this how where we're at and where we're going you must have an open door you must receive him into your heart amen he says I'll meet you in there amen bear with [Music] me so we see we must go beyond the camp amen amen bear with me here amen you must constrain him to come in and dwell with you you must constrain him Amen to come in and be your gu Amen to be able to understand the things of God in this hour other than that you're just presuming yeah amen you're just guessing and every time amen something happens amen you're up and you're down and you're up and you're down why because you're trying to to live this life up under a mental conception amen it's much like the children of Israel amen when they had left Egypt amen and they was in the wilderness amen and and and God Reign spiritual food in due season amen but if they didn't get there early enough enough amen it it it dried up amen and it went away amen but the prophet say take some of this mana and put it over there into the ark amen where where was it in the presence of the Shina glory amen and it was sustained so you have to get to a point where you go beyond justification see because the Ark of the Covenant amen was in the amen it's not enough to just come to church right amen I hear many people in this hour saying I'll just stay home that's not going to help you I'll read the Bible on my own amen and just have a real good time that's not enough amen you have to go beyond the camp right amen you have to go beyond the outou of Court you have to go beyond the inner Court you have to go beyond the veil in this house amen where the table is spread and the Mana is still fresh Amen in the presence of God under the Shina glory amen it from a fountain that never shall run dry right Amen in order to understand God in order to understand who you are in order to understand the time that we're living in it must be a revelation amen but we have to go beyond the camp amen we see amen that there's many things amen the prophet said that you see a Christian once he get be beyond that camp amen once he begin to to live in that inner Court he said your anchor must be anchored in the veil Beyond the Veil you may see turbulent times on the sea amen and there's many ships around amen and they all kind of anchored one may be anchored over here one may be anchored over there amen but I want my anchor in the interval amen hallelujah because that's where the solid rock is hallelujah your ankle must hold and grip a solid Rock Amen you must have a sure Foundation it's not enough to take your ankle and throw it at a bed of sad amen you're just going to drift with the wind and trying to find your way back okay well where where did I leave God and the devil begin to confuse you amen and and because you're no longer Amen in the right place yeah amen you begin to believe a lie my Lord because it's all a l look I don't know if you ever been out on the ocean that all looks the same yes sir true over here looks pretty good I guess I'll stay right here it all looks the same maybe over there you may be miles off but you got to have your anchor Beyond the Veil where the solid rock is amen and your ankle must hold and grip that rock therefore amen when the Winds of bows roll amen you know your anchor going to hold amen so what happens man you when those times come you can stand and say I know who I [Music] am I know where I come from that's right and I know where I'm going amen you have to be sure in this hour that your ankle hold good amen amen and grips a Solid Rock Amen there's many people in this hour amen they go through different things and listen all they know to do is cry now that's right why cry speak you recognize who you areen that's when you know that your anchor is gripping a solid rock yes sir Hallelujah you'll not waver right you'll not doubt but you're standing a man on the word of God sirj cuz your anchor is in the veil amen weep not for The Lion and the tribe of Judah has prevailed Lord when we have a solid foundation we're no longer presuming we're no longer guessing we know who we are we know where the word is we know the hour we know amen amen see they wanted to know Jesus there in the temple he opened the book amen and he identified himself he Divi identified where he was and he closed the book amen you can't it wasn't time yet but today amen we have a book and the book is open amen and he Loos the seals amen and it remains open why so me you and I amen can feed Amen on an open book that's the only way that our anchor amen is Beyond the Veil amen because amen the book is open we can feed from the bloody word of God we can feed from fresh kill Mana sir not from some man presuming right guessing and wondering smart men educated men but Bible says in Amos 3:7 I say nothing that's I reveal my secrets Amen to my service the prophet that's right amen amen and we see amen let me go back and read here amen I'm all over the place but bear with me the prophet preached a message amen called the Easter seal Amen in 19 65 I believe it was amen bear with me I'll get to it and at that time yes uh in Phoenix 1965 amen he preached that message Millions on earth look Millions on Earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was here but how thankful that we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proofs that we are included in the great Resurrection morning that's uh a morning coming not that great Easter we have the earnest of it right now and in our mortal bodies the predestinated ones are first of course to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes and claim its own amen later on in there he says that you knew that the message was turning amen things were going to be different amen it was no longer a public show amen but it was for the bride yes sir amen but you have to go in amen behind the veil he said I'll meet you in there and in there I'll I'll reveal to you amen the secret things I'll show you who I am amen you dwell in the presence of almighty God yes sir amen and he'll wipe away all of the tears from your eyes and give you amen a a new a new song Amen but we see amen that there's going to be weeping there going to be wailing amen but for that group amen that went beyond the veil amen he's going to wipe away all your tears there'll be no more weeping amen but you must go Beyond the Veil you must press you must constrain him to come in and abide amen what in Easter amen the resurrection amen there was a resurrection 2,000 years ago amen but you see that today amen when the word of God was being revealed again the same thing was happening yes sir amen there was a there was a first and second pull of the prophet's Ministry amen but when amen it came to the revealing of the word people pulled away right true the same thing that's why he had to indict this generation yes sir he said for crucifying the word aresh right amen but there was a a group of people 2,000 years ago that re he revealed himself to I'm not dead but I've risen walking among the people amen and the same thing is happening today anden the word is being revealed and our God lives our god reigns but if you're not careful the devil will get in and to start the message and you won't be able to receive it the most important thing right now amen is to have the the the the God on the inside so that he could a amen uh rightly divide the word of Truth you can't understand it until then right because you without the Holy Ghost your mental conception is nothing to God nothing to God you can't understand his ways well why can't I do this why can't I wear short pants and why can't I B my hair like the world is doing why can't I do these certain things and you hold on to these things but God want to free you this morning he came to deliver and set the captives free amen amen amen and only the word of God is going to be able to set you free amen I'm not talking about just the caral conception that I'm talking about the pure and adulterated word of God many people right now in [Applause] church better a prophet spoke against that stuff we had a prophet in this hour Amen to set the record straight yes how to act right how to dress how to carry yourself right come on to deliver you from the bondage what happened that kind of stuff distorts the message it you can't receive God with all that filth Crea in me a clean heart oh Lord and renewing me a righteous Spirit Lord cast me not away from n presence oh God Amen remember there'll be a group and he'll wife away all the tears yes and the group that they'll be weeping whing oh a nashing of teeth that's something else there that's go that's that's a different kind of cry my Lord you know what kind of cry that is a guilty cry and you know the way what's going to be so bad you were right there you sat right up under the word and heard it Lord yes sir but you rejected it y Lord have mercy the minister cried out the minister came up and you thought well that's just a man speaking but because you couldn't you couldn't dissect and you didn't have anything in your heart to hear the voice of God lord you ignored it and there'll be weeping I wish I had a listen I wish I had have done it I would I wish I had just it's not worthy this suffering that I'm going through put away these little simple things simple things and what are you gaining from it nothing nothing what is it so self esteem God will give you more self-esteem than you can imagine true your ankle must hold and grip a solid rock There's No Greater Joy than knowing that your ankle hold walk not under after the counsel of the ungodly amen be ye separated God is called calling you amen by name right to a higher place of praise to a higher calling he want to wipe away all your tears but you must go beyond the camp now the devil has a camp too yes sir that's right the devil has a camp amen and there's many people and it's a it's a real good it's a it's a real good sound amen they having a real good time over there in that camp right amen over in the club a real good sound and they over there rejoicing amen but they're not worshiping that's it there's a difference that's it they rejoicing amen and it's a camp but it's the camp of the devil amen no doubt when Moses Moses came down off of off of the mountain he said that ain't the sound of worship no something there's a there's a there's a uncertain sound in the camp something ain't right amen and it caused people to be destroyed yes sir amen there's a there's a sound there's a trump in this hour Amen to set the captives free amen but you can't hear it because your heart is hard and the days you hear his voice Harden not your heart yes sir yes sir he's trying to take you beyond the cam true amen he's trying to get you at least into the court then into the inner Court then beyond the where you can hear God the prophet said the Holy Ghost is just the beginning he said the Holy Ghost is just beginning then you must be proven and tested set aside amen uhh uh called in the service the adoption yes sir amen placed positionally placed right amen God has a work for you to do amen he's trying to get you to a point that that that you can be [Music]

Church ages and when the When when when when the prophet Came Upon seeing that Mighty Angel amen they look over who is worthy to take the book then he took it back to Jeffersonville and he revealed
