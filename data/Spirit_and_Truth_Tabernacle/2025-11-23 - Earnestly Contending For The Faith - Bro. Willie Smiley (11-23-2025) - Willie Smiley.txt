I was in the back there and I'm like, "Well, let me go, you know, PEEP AND SEE WHAT GOING ON IN THERE." &gt;&gt; HEY, that's that's what it's all that's what it's all about. I tell you what, [snorts] you know, uh just being We going to be looking in the book of Jude and the book of Revelation is is just trying to be free in the spirit. &gt;&gt; We used to think we used to sing that song, free in the spirit of free. &gt;&gt; Ain't no change. Ain't no change this morning, is it? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes I'll be telling myself now, if I could act or sing the way that I feel it &gt;&gt; and hear it in the spirit, &gt;&gt; oh my God. &gt;&gt; Cuz I be feeling some stuff and I be hearing some stuff in the spirit, but it just won't come out these lips the same way. [laughter] But if I could get it all together, OH LORD have mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. It be I be saying I said brother so just trying to bind me up where I just can't be free. Amen. The way that that I desire to be free. &gt;&gt; But let's remember the brothers this out brother Jack and the Quintons this morning. Let's start from the first verse of uh Jude chapter 1. Uh it says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ uh brother of James to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares who were uh before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men turning the grace of God into luxiousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now let us uh also look at revelations uh chapter 2. And uh we want to start at the first verse. It says uh unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, write these things, say he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou uh can not bear them which are evil, and has tried them which say that they are apostles, and are not, and has found them liars, and has borne, and has patient for my name's sake, has labored, and has not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou has left thy first love. Remember uh therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first work or else I will come unto thee quickly and I will remove the candlestick out of his place except thou repent. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Gracious father, we just thank you and we praise you, oh God, this morning for uh your grace and your mercies and how you've uh blessed us thus far in the service. Lord, we just want to remove the human part to one side that the Holy Spirit can take control. And uh Lord, bless uh the brethren, Lord, uh up with Tim Puit this morning, brother Tim Puit this morning. And uh just get them traveling mercies also uh when they prepare to come back. We just thank you. We praise you. Uh restore brother Troy and his strength this morning. We thank you for all things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. May be seated there. Um we like to use as a topic this morning um earnestly contending for the faith and as a subtopic we want to um use the complaint of God. I'm going kind of squeeze two messages. I don't know how much time I got this morning but uh uh we we going to do the best that we can uh by God's grace. Um when we look at the book of Jude, um one of the things we find is that uh Jude is trying to encourage the the uh the church to uh contend for the faith. And you know, in in one of those contending for the faith messages, Brother Brandham, he says it it means that you kind of got to wrestle. you you gota you gotta fight. You got to do everything that you possibly can to uh uh you know stay with what was initially given. And you know as I was riding to church this morning, I'm I'm constantly my wheels is always turning. Uh a couple of um words just kind of popped out. Uh sustainable and maintaining. And you know, one of the things that that you know, we find in looking at the scriptures, it's a real and not just in the scripture because there's there's parallels. There's a natural and there's a spiritual. Is that right? And and we we we just always got to keep it keep those things in mind like we were saying um uh the last couple of weeks ago when we preached uh you know our our our minds has got to be transformed. I I know we we're we're we're you know we're living a a natural life but there's a a spiritual element that goes along with our our natural life. And one of the things that, you know, for me that I always have to consider, I don't do everything right, but it's a battle. &gt;&gt; It's it's a struggle. Y'all ought to say amen to me this morning. &gt;&gt; Uh uh it it's it's a real battle. It's a struggle to uh maintain, right? or or substain uh which which means maintaining sustainable means maintaining uh the the capacity to maintain AND AND YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT THINK to maintain something or keep something in order is is an easy task. It's not. If you if you got a house with children running around in it, no matter how you try to keep it all nice and and and and everything in order, that's difficult &gt;&gt; and and it can be frustrating &gt;&gt; trying to maintain some sort of, you know, order or some sort of, you know, condition, right? And and the same thing is in the spirit, &gt;&gt; right? Just trying to maintain &gt;&gt; biblical integrity. It's not easy. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why is it NOT SO EASY?" BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY VOICES. Especially now, we got access to so many things that we didn't have ACCESS TO WHEN I GOT CONVERTED CUZ WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T have phones the way that we got them. WE DIDN'T HAVE LAPTOPS. WE DIDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, all of the the the podcasts and and we WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT. We might have just had, you know, um the books and the tapes in our local ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; And and some people, you know, maybe put out tapes, but you wasn't always privy to a lot of that. So, we we didn't have all of this this information to grapple with. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh it it was more easier for us to to hear our shepherds &gt;&gt; and and not try to, you know, UH UH WELL, BROTHER SO AND SO said that BECAUSE NOW WE GOT SO MUCH access &gt;&gt; and THERE'S THERE'S SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY voices &gt;&gt; and and we kind of pitting one voice against another voice. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? SO, SO SOMETIMES IT IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT FOR for the local shepherd to to uh uh keep us in with one MIND AND ONE ACCORD. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And because you know we we we listen to we listen to you know and AND WHO AM I TO SAY WHAT YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO? But I'm just throwing this out there because I don't think everybody spiritual enough &gt;&gt; to listen to everybody out there. &gt;&gt; And and even WHEN THEIR MESSAGE PREACHES, I STILL DON'T THINK THAT EVERYBODY'S SPIRITUAL ENOUGH &gt;&gt; OR SOUND ENOUGH IN DOCTRINE to listen to everybody, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S NOT ON THE WORD, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? because they say that they're preaching, you know, uh, God sent a prophet, but it's like God sent a prophet and what else? &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all preach with me, church. &gt;&gt; Don't work me too hard. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And and so I I think it's it's it's a very difficult job for the ministry just trying to set uh boundaries, &gt;&gt; right? set set boundaries. Uh lay lay a platform for us to build upon, &gt;&gt; right? BECAUSE LISTEN, CHURCH, we we we we LIVING A NATURAL LIFE AND WE'RE LIVING A SPIRITUAL life and and YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO BE SOUND. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND AND AND EVERYTHING HAS GOT TO BE COMING THROUGH A THINKING MAN'S FILTER. &gt;&gt; Is that right? BEC BECAUSE IF IF WE START THE FILTERING I'M GOING SOMEWHERE but I I just kind of got to preach my inspiration first. &gt;&gt; Right. WE WE WE WE GOT TO BE FILTERING YOU KNOW OUR LIFE THROUGH A THINKING MAN'S FILTER. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Glory to God. BECAUSE IF NOT IT SHOWS WHAT kind of tastes we have. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO BE NEGATIVE, BUT I'M saying this to be positive be because WE GOT A WHOLE YOUNG GENERATION THAT'S GROWING UP, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Uh um and you you want them to have a foundation in which to build their lives upon. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You want them to have a a foundation, you know, UH TO FILTER THEIR THOUGHTS THROUGH. IS THAT RIGHT? BE BECAUSE IF IF IT'S NOT ONE OF THE THINGS WE DON'T WANT AS CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; NOW, I can't speak for the world, but the world do whatever they want to do. But I'm talking about being we're Christians. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We I'm not here to discharianize or tell nobody who's a Christian and who not a Christian. You ain't no Christian. Well, that's not my job. My job is to uh uh uh you know bring us to to to this place you know right of stability according to Paul in the book of Ephesians. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But we we want we we want you know for for the younger generation and all of us to be able to filter you know our thoughts and our actions through the word. &gt;&gt; Is that right? THAT'S THE ONLY WAY that we're gonna be successful as individuals. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one of the things you know you you find is if not it's it's the flesh should be the thing that's dragging you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And and we don't want to be dragged. We want to be led by the spirit of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, so Jude is trying to uh in the best way possible TO ENCOURAGE THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; TO LOOK TAKE TAKE A TAKE A stand for uh the word of God. Is that right? the the prophet in in earnestly contending for the faith um 1956419 he says what a solemn scripture we got here under consideration no doubt setting in here is is clergymen from different phases of faith supposed to be one Lord one faith and one baptism because that's that's that's what it started out with. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But then look at look at look at what we got now. &gt;&gt; He says, "Usually an evangelist stir causes many to come." And I'm speaking to many brethren and at first I want to say to to you, I represent this church. He says, "If if you're Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim, Holy, whatever you may be, I represent this church for," watch this, for we preach Christ and him crucified. That's what we believe. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So you you say he he's making, you know, it it seems simple, but it's a profound uh statement. Is that right? TO LET YOU TO LET US know you KNOW WHAT A PART OF WHAT WE stand for and and what we're doing. WE WE DON'T WE CANNOT JUST BE RANDOM, [snorts] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE JUST CAN'T BE RANDOM. OUR APPROACH JUST can't be be random. &gt;&gt; We've been random LONG ENOUGH. WE GOT WE GOT TO BE INTENTIONAL. THIS IS A word that brother Jack has used, RIGHT? WE WE GOT TO BE INTENTIONAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. In in our approach to things, we we we got to kind of know &gt;&gt; know and understand when we're growing, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. We we give we give room for for growth, &gt;&gt; right? But you know, when when I'm by myself and I'm thinking about things and I'm thinking about the next generation, you know, you for me, THIS IS ME. THIS IS my mindset, you know. uh is that you you you want them to be uh uh different than what you were. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO GO THROUGH THE kind of struggles that you you've gone through be because of of uh like brother Brandham say in marriage and divorce uh uh backslitting preachers, [laughter] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. And he even talking about imagine divorce drunken magistrate. But see, you you you you want you want, you know, I was I was listening to uh something this week and and the guy was just talking about um his his father and different things and he says, "You know what? Your father is the only man, but I I'll put myself in here too with you. Is the only man that really wants you to to do better &gt;&gt; than what he did. Is that right? Your father &gt;&gt; wants maybe not no other man, you know, may not want you to do better than them, especially in the natural, but it's it's SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND AND JUST and and and growing for a younger generation of young men, &gt;&gt; right? You you want for THEM TO BE BETTER. YOU you you want for these YOUNG GUYS TO BE BETTER THAN THEIR FATHERS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TO GO FURTHER THAN THEIR FATHERS. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Young sisters, you know, uh you want them to uh and that's a that's a fine line in there cuz we so far away from scripture, right? &gt;&gt; Because everybody's kind of out of place. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all quiet this morning &gt;&gt; cuz cuz how many still believe a prophet's message &gt;&gt; and and now we can't change things. But he said, you know, and it's biblical that that when you get out of the kitchen, you kind of got out your place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; AND AND I THINK I THINK HE had understanding. I mean, we we know with inflation and everything, it it's a things has gotten to be a little bit different and and the influence of the pits of hell, &gt;&gt; right? Come on, church. &gt;&gt; To to uh uh steal, kill, and destroy, &gt;&gt; right? It it's IT'S SO MANY IT'S SO MANY factors &gt;&gt; at play, &gt;&gt; right? cuz you know we just kind of going along and we're we're not sometimes considering IT'S SO MANY THINGS at at work against us, &gt;&gt; right? Uh we know that so many demons has been loosed. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; TURN TURNED LOOSED IN THIS AGE. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; We we could WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM GENESIS WHAT WAS TURNED loose against A A PERFECT FAMILY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. A PERFECT CONNECTION. BUT WHAT WAS TURNED loose and see SATAN'S ALWAYS MAINTAIN AND BROTHER BRANDON SAY he done fulfilled it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To be above, &gt;&gt; right? Come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; TO TO TO BE ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND HE SAYS THE PROPHET SAYS THAT HE'S DONE DONE IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW HOW DID HE DO IT? BY GETTING THE PEOPLE AWAY from real true biblical principle, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S THAT'S HOW HE'S DONE IT. HE'S ALWAYS WORKED, AMEN. from a religious standpoint and trying to get the people away from the WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; CUZ IF HE GET YOU FROM THE WORD OF GOD, HE GOT YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. I mean, WE WE COULD FOLLOW IT RIGHT DOWN THROUGH SCRIPTURE DURING THE DAYS of Balum and Bailac, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, THE DEVIL KNOWS &gt;&gt; THERE'S A REACTION THAT GOD AMEN. HAS WHEN HE SEES the true church GETTING AWAY FROM THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THAT THERE'S A AND THIS IS why our inspiration is the complaint of God. You know, we ain't got to it yet, but he he says, you know, BOY, I GOT I KNOW Y'ALL DONE DID ALL OF THIS. Y'all done did all that. Boy, I got something against y'all, though. &gt;&gt; Right. SEE, BALAM [screaming] BALAM GOT THE CHURCH TO DO SOMETHING CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD, AND IT UPSET GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. AND AND AND THE PROPHET MAKES A STATEMENT. HE SAID, "BOY, GOD, HEY, GOD ain't forgave him for that one, right?" GLORY TO GOD. SO, SEE, SO SEE HOW AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, CHURCH, RIGHT? IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. WELL, I'M A CHRISTIAN. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A STARTING POINT. BUT, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO LIVE CHRISTIAN LIVES and build Christian families. And you know, uh, YOU GOT TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN THAT, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT IT REALLY KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO, UH, our understanding of of WHAT GOD LIKES AND WHAT GOD DOES NOT LIKE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; And see just I guess for for me and I'm quite sure brother Jack also is is is you know we're NOT JUST RANDOM. WE'RE WE'RE trying to get us to maintain some sense of uh standard. &gt;&gt; I I'm going tell you church, the church ain't like it used to be now. things things is not like they used to be. &gt;&gt; When I got converted in 1988, things have changed. &gt;&gt; The the mindset and and things of that nature of people have changed. The the things that people once used to do and the places that people once would not go, WE GOING &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE DOING. NOW, I'M GONNA get to that in the message right this morning. If I get that far, I already know what's on there, so I could preach it from within here. &gt;&gt; But I'm gonna read y'all some some quotes this morning, &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet says, "And and if we could only find out what kind of faith they had, right? If we could only find out, you know, if they were the uh Presbyterians, Baptist, Methodists, Luther, Catholic, whatever it was, then we could contend for that. See, I [screaming] fight for what I understand. And I MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTOOD, BUT I DON'T CARE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND. AND I KNOW WHEN I STEP UP HERE, I AIN'T PREACHING YOU NO false doctrine, &gt;&gt; IT IT MIGHT BE AGAINST OUR human reasoning, &gt;&gt; right? But we COULD WE COULD HAVE DIALOGUE. &gt;&gt; ANYTIME I FINISH PREACHING, WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T understand or something you don't believe, &gt;&gt; right? But you know, I COULD SUPPORT IT BY THE SCRIPTURE and and the message, &gt;&gt; right? AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, we we could kind of see the same spirit at work as it's always worked down through the history of scripture. Look, look at the degree of difficulty that the prophet of God had and trying to get us to see where the church has fallen &gt;&gt; and where is right. Glory &gt;&gt; y'all. All right, y'all still with me? &gt;&gt; See, he says, um, so then the only way that you can do it is to go back and find out what it was. This this is the thing. This was brother Brandham's ministry, right? Fighting to take us back to what was, to show us what was. BECAUSE HE REALIZED WHAT WHAT what it was during this time when he came on the scene, it wasn't what was. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You you you could see how the church had drifted, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And see, IT'S A BATTLE CONSTANTLY to keep us from drifting, &gt;&gt; right? BECAUSE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T SAY CERTAIN THINGS, RIGHT, uh the church will drift, &gt;&gt; glory to God, &gt;&gt; BY HUMAN NATURE AND THROUGH THROUGH THE MANY BATTLES THAT WE GO THROUGH. G glory to God. WE WE'LL FIND OURSSELFVES leaning to our own understanding &gt;&gt; and and our own human reasoning which is a uh do will do a disservice to us. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT LOOK AT EVE. LOOK AT ALL OF WHAT SHE HAD. BUT IT WAS her human reasoning and her lust and things of that nature. She stopped when she shouldn't have stopped the reason. And look what it did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's it's the same spirit at work, &gt;&gt; right? Trying to get us to the to Well, it don't mean that. &gt;&gt; It It don't It's You know, that was the reason why God set us sent us a prophet so that we would know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we definitely did not know. Amen. &gt;&gt; APART FROM A PROPHET, I DIDN'T KNOW. I I DIDN'T KNOW where to stand as as a Christian. I I got kind of converted, had my first experience in Pentecost and and I didn't last long because I I just just didn't have nothing to stand on, &gt;&gt; right? I had an experience, but I didn't have no word. I had I had no basis, right? CUZ BECAUSE FAITH HAS GOT TO HAVE A PLACE to rest itself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can't be just shifting sands of some theology of man's wisdom. That won't work. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; That won't work. Our feelings and our opinions, we get into trouble with that. You know, you know, uh, in the scripture it talks about there was a time when the people didn't have A PROPHET AND THEY DID WHAT WAS convenient in their own sight, &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT THEY COULD FIGURE OUT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? You know WHAT WE COULD REASON THAT DON'T WORK FOR CHRISTIANS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE PREACHING FROM AN OPEN BOOK. THE MIGHTY ANGEL DESCENDED &gt;&gt; TO GIVE US CLARITY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Let me keep going. Boy, my time going to get get gone. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Um, so he says, "SO THAT ONLY JUST WAY TO do it is to go back and find out what it was that gets every man and asks every man a chance and gives God a chance. Give me a chance tonight to defend what I'm standing for by the scriptures." Right? And you do. You got to you got to defend what you standing for by the scriptures. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; FOR I TRULY believe that any doctrine that is not based upon the Bible is a heretic. It's not right. It must come from this Bible. Not from uh one scripture but from every scripture completely through the Bible or it's not right. &gt;&gt; God doesn't make mistakes. He's infinite and he cannot make mistakes. He's infallible, omnipotent, omnipresent, omnipotent. He cannot make mistakes and he does not write one thing in one time and something to contradict it over here. There's no place in the scripture. He can't do that. God don't operate like that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He he he does not um operate that way. Right. It's it's it's it's got to be uh one scripture on top of the other scripture. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Glory to his wonderful name. Y'all right. &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all a little quiet this morning. &gt;&gt; We ain't at no funeral. That's all right. And I just be messing with y'all about the quietness cuz I'mma preach anyway. &gt;&gt; Don't really matter because he here now &gt;&gt; and I don't need y'all help. I need his. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL Y'ALL Y'ALL HELP make it a little easier. But uh he's here now. &gt;&gt; So that's that's that's the only thing you know that I be waiting on. But in in the church age, the Ephesians church age, uh page 68, uh the prophet, he says, "Here it is, uh here it is, an unchanging God with unchanging ways." &gt;&gt; That's been the basis of of Brother Brandon's message, right? &gt;&gt; He's God and he don't he don't change, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; See and and once we find these different things out uh you know THESE THINGS HAS GOT TO BE maintained &gt;&gt; right we we just can't you know think uh God don't you know God God understands why he does a certain things and &gt;&gt; he wanted to remain the same &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; not not not changing you know Well, you know, that was for that day. You hear all kinds of stuff, &gt;&gt; you know, uh they try to make standards traditional now. &gt;&gt; The the theologians, we we they make standards traditional. That's what they taught in the day is gone by. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like, BUT WHAT ABOUT GOD? RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And I think I I'll say this too. The people back then with the standards were kind of better off than the folks are now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Be because because you know when they broke the standards, the devil came in &gt;&gt; and took THE THING OVER. AND NOW LOOK WHAT WE GOT. &gt;&gt; LOOK, LOOK WHAT WE GOT. YOU CAN'T HARDLY TELL. IS THIS CHURCH? Is this the club? Is this the the this and this? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And and see, we're starting to, you know, trade the word for enthusiasm &gt;&gt; in the church, right? And I watch things, right? It just kind of goes along with who I am um as as a servant of God. I watch things and I watch trends and you KNOW YOU START WATCHING THE THING NOW THE BIG THING now if you you look at most churches is that jump thing everybody and I I ain't got the energy in these legs to do all that y'all would be getting me off THE FLOOR BUT EVERYBODY &gt;&gt; AND THIS THE big thing &gt;&gt; YOU I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WHAT CHURCH YOU LOOK AT ONLINE THAT'S THE BIG THING NOW IT'S A WHOLE LOT of and very little word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't talk to me. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; See, I be like, "Oh, I see the a little pattern now. A little trend of the day. Everybody want to be bouncing and jumping and this, that, and the other." And then you listen to the words, you like, "Oh, oh, &gt;&gt; right. Let me leave that alone." &gt;&gt; WHICH I ENJOY JUMPING AND SHOUTING AND THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER, BUT YOU GOING TO HAVE TO STILL GIVE ME THE WORD AFTER ALL OF THAT. BODILY EXERCISE DOES [screaming] PROFIT, &gt;&gt; but I'm benefited more &gt;&gt; BY BY WHAT YOU SAY FROM THE PULL PIT. &gt;&gt; SEE, it's hard for me to jump an hour and get a 30 minute sermon. That &gt;&gt; less than them 30 MINUTES IS POWER PACK. &gt;&gt; Leave me leave cuz I Yeah, some brothers can leave you in 30 minutes. She be like, "Grad, woo." &gt;&gt; Feel like a wrestler. Woo! &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But watch. He said, "Here it is." Now, now y'all keep your spiritual thinking caps on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Here it is. An unchanging God with unchanging ways." WHAT he did at the first, right? He will have to keep on doing it until it's done for the last time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, WE WE'RE WE'RE GROWING IN CHURCH, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Just say we're we're new we're new converts, right? and and we're trying to understand, you know, the faith and what we're contending for, THEN WE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT GOD [screaming] STARTED THE THING OFF WITH in the beginning, &gt;&gt; right? YOU GOT TO HAVE A YOU YOU KNOW, CUZ IF Y'ALL ANYTHING LIKE ME, UH WHEN I FIRST GOT CONVERTED, I DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING. I HAD A BIBLE, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I didn't know who Abraham was. I didn't know where you didn't know nothing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You know, I I didn't have a place to rest my faith, &gt;&gt; right? BUT THEN BUT NOW, YOU KNOW, he say changing God with unchanging words and what he did. THEN YOU GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT HE DID THE FIR AT THE FIRST TIME. SEE, AND THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS GOT TO POINT THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE BOOK OF ACTS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. You you always got to go back to the book of Acts because that's where you find God's first and perfect acts at. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BE BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU you kind of be wishywashy like a tree, you know. Glory to God. But we we wanted to be we want we want for folks to be rooted and grounded &gt;&gt; because we want our WE WANT OUR BAPTISM. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT THAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; It is important because THERE WAS A GROUP THAT WAS BAPTIZED UNDER uh John's baptism, &gt;&gt; right? [screaming] Didn't didn't HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HOLY Ghost was, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And and THEN THE APOSTLE PAUL CAME AND THE FIRST THING HE ASKED HIM, YOU KNOW, how was you baptized? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND ONCE THEY TOLD JOHN, John commanded them to be rebaptized, NOT IN IN TITLES OF FATHER, SON, and holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? That proves that a man does not understand scripture. If he take you down in titles of father, son, and holy ghost, he didn't get. Amen. Uh what Jesus was trying to relate, AMEN. TO HIS DISCIPLES, &gt;&gt; THEY GOT IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT IT. CUZ IN THE BOOK OF ACTS CHAPTER 2, WHEN AFTER THE HOLY GHOST CAME ON on the 120 AND THEY BUST OUT OF THERE, YOU KNOW, NOW THEY WERE BOUNCING, BUT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO BOUNCE &gt;&gt; you know, the manifestation of the SCRIPTURE CUZ CUZ THE PEOPLE AROUND SAY, "OH MAN, THESE PEOPLE DRUNK." AND PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE ARE DRUNK, [screaming] BUT NOT LIKE Y'ALL SUPPOSED. WE WE ARE FEELING GOOD &gt;&gt; BUT NOT LIKE Y'ALL THINK. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT THIS IS THAT &gt;&gt; THAT WAS [screaming] SPOKEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF WAS SPOKEN BY JOEL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF BIBLE PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; BOY, I tell you what, THEY STIRRED THEM FOLK UP. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I COULD IMAGINE, BUDDY, the the 120 with Peter with no microphone probably stood up on something and got to breaking bread. I COULD IMAGINE THEM PREACH PETER PREACH DAY. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S HOW WE USED TO HAVE CHURCH. WE AIN'T HAVE STAND CONTESTES. AND Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IF Y'ALL WAS IN THE THUNDERS, HUH, BROTHER COLEMAN, LOOK AT YOU, TELL YOU ALL THESE NO PRAISE DEMONS UP IN HERE. NOW, WE DON'T DO THAT. WE DON'T DO THAT HERE. BUT BOY, BROTHER COIN, AND IF YOU WASN'T PRAISING GOD, YOU FEEL LIKE HE TALKING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. BECAUSE YOU HAD A [screaming] NO PRAISE SPIRIT ON YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU IT SHOWED THAT YOU DIDN'T COME TO CAUSE SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. CUZ THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO CAUSE SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, THEY WAS ON THEIR FEET [screaming] &gt;&gt; PUMPING AND PULLING, TELLING THE PREACHER TO PREACH. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know that don't always mean that you getting nothing. Now, don't see I know there's a balance to all of those things, &gt;&gt; you know. So I we don't we don't try to you know force that you but every now and then you can give me a amen now and then &gt;&gt; right but now watch we're we're we're new converts and we're trying to get clarity BECAUSE YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO to the beginning TO KNOW HOW GOD STARTED THE THING IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR &gt;&gt; RIGHT CUZ YOU SAYS LISTEN IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO WRITE TO y'all &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; TO CAUSE Y'ALL TO CONTEND THE FIGHT DON'T DON'T DON'T GET GIVE UP DON'T YOU KNOW BE CARNAL MAN LISTEN WHAT YOU GOT IN THE BEGINNING WAS LIFECH CHANGING THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Y'all going to make me preach up in here. &gt;&gt; Boy, I FEEL LIKE A BULLET RIGHT ABOUT NOW. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; WHAT WE GOT IN THE BEGINNING WAS LIFECH CHANGING AND WE WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT [screaming] IT. WE WASN'T ASHAMED OF IT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. MAN, when I FIRST GOT SAVED, ALL MY old friends, I remember I used to live with my uncle and man, I was so excited. I was witnessing to the fellas and and everything and they ain't want to hear it. They start calling me Rem Ike [laughter] and and they would they would get to the place they come knock on the door looking for my cousin. They peep their head in. They stop coming in. They say, "Is Red Mike IN THERE?" HERE I AM. Y'ALL HERE. &gt;&gt; HEY. HEY. The pimp will up on the corner. &gt;&gt; BEFORE Y'ALL WAS WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME &gt;&gt; NOW.

I'VE COME TO A PLACE WHERE I DIDN'T THINK I HAD NO HOPE. [cheering and applause] BUT THIS THING LIFTED ME UP. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. GET ON UP. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; GET ON UP. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GET BACK IN LINE. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, they sang THAT SONG, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; It will be all right. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES, MAN, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT DAVID THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE AND I THINK JACK WAS JUST PREACHING ON IT. BROTHER JACK WAS JUST PREACHING ON IT. SOMETIMES, MAN, YOU GOT TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF BECAUSE AIN'T NOBODY THERE to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. WHEN THERE'S NOBODY THERE TO TELL YOU YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU GOT TO HAVE CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU GOT TO PRAY AND LIKE GOD TO LEAD YOU TO SOMETHING THAT'LL RAISE YOU UP, &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGE YOU, SOMETHING THAT'LL ILLUMINATE YOU, &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT'LL TRANSFORM YOUR MIND, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? You know, uh, they sang the song, he did it for my good. &gt;&gt; Sometime in the flesh, you be like, boy, I don't know what good that this don't seem good. It don't feel good. Glory to God. But you realize something's good is coming. Something's good is coming out of this. &gt;&gt; You're gonna COME OUT OF A BETTER PERSON. You know, hey, YOU I'M GOING TELL YOU SOMETHING. In the last few years, man, I I think different, &gt;&gt; right? I process different. I think different. Um I, you know, there was a time I would let people do certain things to me. I won't let you do that to me now. &gt;&gt; I'll be ready to have a conversation. and let's let's talk about this thing because uh you know certain things I realize it's not who I am and I and I can't be defined by you know you can't define one another by by periods of growth [snorts] &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because because IF WE REALLY SAT DOWN we we we AND TALKED WITH FOLKS folks have realized that they ain't really where THEY THINK THEY THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; WE ALL GOT ROOM TO GROW. And even EVEN EVEN SOLOMON SOLOMON WAS TRYING TO TEACH his sons &gt;&gt; about information if I'm just paraphrasing, &gt;&gt; right? AND AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OF GOOD INFORMATION. &gt;&gt; I just said something &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S BAD INFORMATION &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S GOOD INFORMATION. AND IF YOU GIVING ME INFORMATION, I gotta be able to take it through a thinking man's filter. &gt;&gt; Because if it won't work through the filter, it's bad information &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOT TO BE WEEDED OUT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SEE, I'M I'M IN THE ERA WHERE I'M NOT STOMACHING EVERYTHING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT?

NEVER. YOU AIN'T NEVER GOING NOWHERE, CHURCH, in in THAT. IT'S IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH. THAT'S WHY God gave us this. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE DECEIVED IN OUR EMOTIONS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SEE, if those things if those things don't don't line up with the word, we got to cast that stuff down. &gt;&gt; I like that song, Sister Bernese. Anything that try to arise, &gt;&gt; we cast it down. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, WE SHOUT OVER PSALMS AND we operate differently. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you say, you saying that you you sounding arrogant. Nope. I'm revealing. &gt;&gt; We exposing. &gt;&gt; Right. We're transforming the way that we think. &gt;&gt; SEE, CHURCH AIN'T WHAT WE WE WE WE WE THOUGHT IT WAS. SEE, I'M I'M IN A I'M IN A SPACE NOW WHERE I REALIZE, BRO, church ain't what what you know, cuz in our early days, we used to boy, I was deep preaching. That's all we wanted. Boy, I tell you what, that brother, praise God. He preached dark and but then we can't stand. &gt;&gt; So, what good did that do? See, &gt;&gt; BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE COULD WHEN WE COULD take our time and kind of try to reprogram and program, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz for for A LOT OF US, ESPECIALLY US ADULTS, we got to reprogram, &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. BUT FOR THESE YOUNGER ONES, WE GOT TO TRY TO program program, &gt;&gt; right? Because they they growing up and and they looking, right? Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, have mercy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The little sisters, you know, they trying to be cute for a reason. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You you walk you you kind of watch them walk around with that little air like you know I'm cute. &gt;&gt; Watch the way they you know play with their hands. Throw that thing back and you know &gt;&gt; what ARE THEY DOING THAT far &gt;&gt; and and the little fellas you know they they they looking too. &gt;&gt; They getting of age, &gt;&gt; you know, but then we want to program them, &gt;&gt; right? So they understand how to go about approaching and what to look for, &gt;&gt; right? These young guys getting older, you know, and and you know, they got to know what to do. And and and and you know, if the devil send one to heels, they got to know what to do. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Cuz them nobody and women look good. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They the ones that's all doled up and this and that and then they got them heels and they know how to and the scripture said it. They'll be mincing. &gt;&gt; They know how to mince just right. Well, y'all didn't come to preach with me. I know. &gt;&gt; But it's it's it's it's transforming. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. And forming, &gt;&gt; right? See, I you know, you you just for me AND I CAN'T JUST HINDSIGHT IS 2020. I could wish all I want to wish, but it ain't going to do me no good, &gt;&gt; right? because I got more years behind me than I I I do in front of me. But here here's the thing that I've come to this this place now. Y'all y'all know I'm just a preacher. I just let him use me. &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE I HERE'S WHERE I'VE COME TO. I've got a lot of regrets, &gt;&gt; all right, about my past. &gt;&gt; But in my future, &gt;&gt; I want to live life not having regrets. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SEE, WE ALL COULD SAY AMEN TO THAT. &gt;&gt; WE WE ALL COULD LOOK BACK AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE COULD HAVE DID BETTER, BUT we didn't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE YOU YOU'RE NOT DEFINED BY THAT. YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, &gt;&gt; SEE, I WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF NO REGRETS. &gt;&gt; SO, I I I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME &gt;&gt; AND PROCESS &gt;&gt; AND ANALYZE THINGS SO THAT IT'S NO REGRETS. &gt;&gt; IF IF IF I MAKE A MOVE, &gt;&gt; I've prayed about it. I've thought about it. I've I've taken it through the word. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because I don't want regrets. You know, when when now it's like running it running across information, you know, you start doing things different. &gt;&gt; Um uh I guess the other day I sent all of my kids a text, &gt;&gt; right? I did I DID SOMETHING THAT I NORMALLY, you know, I communicate often with my kids, but sometimes there's certain things that they need to hear from me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They need to and and THAT THEIR THEIR RESPONSE was overwhelming, &gt;&gt; was encouraging, &gt;&gt; is that right? Amen. you know, because I guess at one point I was a disciplinarian and I was &gt;&gt; and I still am. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I realized too, you know, at this stage and the stage that they living in, I got to be different. &gt;&gt; I I it's it's imperative that I mature, &gt;&gt; right? I'm I'mma say this. I'm kind of off now, but &gt;&gt; I'm I'm on and I'm off. &gt;&gt; It's imperative for parents to grow, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR HUSBANDS AND WIVES to grow, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT WITHOUT QUESTION, YOU YOU YOU CAN'T TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S SO IMPORTANT uh to get AS MUCH POSITIVE information as you possibly can. &gt;&gt; UH BECAUSE IT IT'LL IT'LL MAKE YOUR SITUATION UH A WHOLE LOT BETTER. THE SPACE THAT YOU YOU'VE created for yourself TO BE BETTER. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; We error because we lack knowledge, &gt;&gt; right? We we we make messes and different things just because of our lack and us not seeing the importance in educating ourselves on every level possible. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. It's it's it's true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. think things that IN IN ORDER FOR US TO SAY, you know what, in my future, man, I ain't going to be able to have to worry about looking back and saying, "Boy, I regret this and I regret that. I regret this and I regret that." I'll say this this morning. Let go your regrets this morning. &gt;&gt; Let go your past regrets. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I I heard a quote and I'm going paraphrase it from Martin Luther King and he he said um you know don't allow anybody to take you you know I'll have to say it like this because I can't remember it all to take you down &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; come on church &gt;&gt; uh uh uh belittle you and this you know y'all know what I'm talking about Y'all smart my people. Y'all read between the lines. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. ALWAYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that YOU YOU COULD STAND UP AS A PERSON, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Only thing I could tell anybody is this. You know, I'm still growing. &gt;&gt; You, brother, you kind of all your you be white, but I'm still growing. &gt;&gt; And I ain't shamed, you know. No, I'm not. I ain't never told nobody I was a knowit- all or that I knew it all, &gt;&gt; you know. And and as much as as much as hindsight, you know, I I I've come to a place where it's it's 2020. It's like we all wish we could, right? Come on. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But we didn't. &gt;&gt; We' have made better decisions. We wish we probably sometime wish we would have married better people or DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND SOMETIMES IT JUST BOILS down to two people, you know, lacking understanding and and and uh how how would I say this? No real forgiveness &gt;&gt; and no real grace. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DON'T GIVE ONE ANOTHER GRACE, &gt;&gt; BUT WE EXPECT A WHOLE LOT OF GRACE FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just, you know, this morning, I'm just your your brother, &gt;&gt; right? Trying to give us what, you know, by the spirit I feel that we need as a body, &gt;&gt; right? just kind of, you know, with with uh Brother Jack and the brethren just trying to, you know, dovetail with with their inspiration. And if I could have gotten a little further, you know, but but we're we're WE'RE CONSTANTLY BUILDING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? I I believe I believe Brother Jack has a has an objective, right? uh in the restoration it's it's giving us an understanding okay we going back right BECAUSE BY GOING BACK we find out where our foundation is and that's Christ &gt;&gt; right like the first quote that I read you know the prophet of God wanted the people to understand something here's here's what we stand for we stand for Christ &gt;&gt; sir Amen. &gt;&gt; We preach Christ, &gt;&gt; right? We don't preach a man, right? &gt;&gt; THE THE MAN'S SOLE purpose was to to to open up to us the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT IT'S MEANT TO ME. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. IT AIN'T IT'S NOT A WORSHIP OF OF A MAN. BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION, WHEN JOHN BOWED DOWN, HE SAID, "BOY, DON'T GET UP. &gt;&gt; DON'T don't you ain't here to worship me." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, IT'S IT'S NOT A MAN, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But it is a man, the man Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE WORSHIP, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Cuz cuz people be curious, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND THEN SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE NEGATIVE AND IT'S LIKE, "NO, YOU YOU just misunderstood." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And and we want TO GIVE YOU CLARITY. WE WORSHIPING CHRIST, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? We we WE'RE WE'RE GOING BACK. BOY, I wish I had another hour. &gt;&gt; I feel like a long- winded &gt;&gt; African preacher this morning. &gt;&gt; Boy, I ain't lying. And I ain't done yet, boy. I ain't done. I ain't done. I ain't done, boy. I got a whole lot. I got I got a I ain't even open my computer yet. I ain't even read. But uh Oh, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'mma read two or three things and I'm going to go. But boy, I know we got to go. Them other folk going to be looking at us funny if I stay up here. Good day. I WISH I COULD TAKE THEIR TIME THIS MORNING. Y'ALL COME ON IN HERE AND SIT DOWN CUZ WE PREACHING. &gt;&gt; WE PREACHING. &gt;&gt; WE'LL FEED YOU SOMETHING THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; COME AND DINE THE MASTER'S CALLING. COME AND DINE. [screaming] YOUR FEAST AT JESUS TABLE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh, I tell you, I &gt;&gt; only the Holy Ghost can make me do that. &gt;&gt; Okay, I can't do that on my own. Okay. He says, "Now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit. Watch this. How the first of the original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her. The word cannot change or be changed because the word is God." &gt;&gt; Right? Thus, what the church was at Pentecost is the standard. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. There is no other pattern. No matter what the scholars say, God has not changed that pattern. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm God and I don't change." &gt;&gt; What God did at Pentecost, he's got to keep on doing it until the church closed. &gt;&gt; Giving the Holy Ghost. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Those scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over. Don't you believe it? Such a statement is wrong on two counts. First of all, it is wrong to suppose there aren't any more apostles just because the original 12 are dead. Any an apostle means a sent one and there's are many sent ones today, but they're called missionaries. As long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life, there is an apostle age going on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Right. Secondly, uh they refer to an age of manifested Holy Ghost power as being over. Boy, it can't be over. &gt;&gt; Not all this that I feel this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's wonderworking power. &gt;&gt; That that is untrue. There is is not even one script to suggest, but many conclusively state otherwise. Here is our proof that both of these charges are false. The promise of power with which the apostles were endured with at Pentecost is to you, right? The Jews and to your children, the Jews, to all them that are fall Gentiles, to as many as the Lord our God shall call. He stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease. What the church had at P I like this quote uh at Pentecost is her inaliable rights. Originally she had the pure word of God. She had the power of the spirit manifested in the uh diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Spirit. So as a as a new convert, you got to go back, Amen, to uh Pentecost, right? See, the original church was not organized by men. It was led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It wasn't very big. It was hated and despised. It was oppressed. It was persecuted unto death. But it was true to God, &gt;&gt; right? See, it stayed with the original word pattern. So, so you you you you see, you know, when when we're when we're preaching, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SHOW US what was the original order of things. What was the original? CUZ IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CHURCH, AMEN. YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO THAT. YOU GOT TO FIND THAT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU YOU can't build on nothing else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let let the musicians make their way. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CANNOT BUILD on anything else out outside of that. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now don't get led astray here. When I said that God and his ways never change, I didn't say that the church is the messengers could not change. The church isn't God. So that's why they always changing. See, so she can change. But what I said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways, we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect acts of God and then judge by that standard. This is how it is done. Right? You got to go back to how the thing started. &gt;&gt; If not, you got yourself a mess, &gt;&gt; right? You get you GOTA YOU GOT YOURSELF A MESS. I WISH I COULD STILL PREACH, BUT I'm going to go. Uh uh um you got to go BACK TO THE BEGINNING, RIGHT? And see, this is why Jude WAS LIKE, "BUT Y'ALL GOT TO FIGHT TO MAINTAIN." AMEN. This word standard, &gt;&gt; right? THE THING THAT GOD STARTED A CHURCH OFF BECAUSE TO YOUR to your surprise, you'll find that the church starts to die. &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN YOU START TO GET AWAY FROM the word, you start to slowly die, &gt;&gt; right? See the the moment that Eve the the moment that Eve uh ptook of Satan's lie, right? Death death sat in &gt;&gt; immediately. Death sat in. That's a quote. &gt;&gt; DEATH SAT IN. AND AND AND WE, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE GRADUAL, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? It might be gradual, but you dying. &gt;&gt; Spiritually, you dying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I got it in this same Ephesian church age. I just ain't going to be able to get to it. Well, brother Banner start to say, you know, just things start changing, right? We we get these new ideas and we get all of this stuff and it's like, bro, to your detriment. &gt;&gt; To your detriment as a Christian. Right? And if if YOU KEEP GOING THAT WAY AND NOT come back and repent, man, you won't even resemble, &gt;&gt; right? You won't even re resemble a Christian &gt;&gt; a word abinding Christian. If you continue to go that route, &gt;&gt; right? Come on. &gt;&gt; SEE THAT THAT'S WHY SERMONS LIKE THIS IS NEEDED. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO, so that we could show people the original Bible standard. &gt;&gt; And if if you're going to be a Christian, YOU YOU YOU GOT TO START OUT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; In order to end up right, &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; Because if you just KIND OF MAKE IT, WELL, I'm I'm I'm Baptist. I'm this. I'm that. But that don't mean you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; That just mean you just went and joined something. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That just mean you just joined something and you can't join this. &gt;&gt; You got to be born into this. &gt;&gt; VERILY, VERILY, I SAY TO YOU, A MAN GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See all this joining, but I'm not joining nothing. I I done been born into something and that's how I feel like this is all I need for the journey that I'm on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say, "Preach, Brother Smiley." Y'all got real quiet on Brother, brother. He f to go. But you know what? It's important. It's important for us, right? BECAUSE THE DEVIL, WHAT I TOLD Y'ALL LAST WEEK, last two weeks ago. See, the devil still wants to steal, kill, and destroy. &gt;&gt; HIS HIS AGENDA HAS NOT CHANGED. SEE, &gt;&gt; and and and AND WE DON'T WANT OUR APPROACH JUST TO BE RANDOM and conno and mixed with feelings and this devil would be like, "Well, I got me one. &gt;&gt; I got me one." &gt;&gt; Right? I know you got feelings and and all that. I ain't doing away with that. And and Right. But you It's so easy. I'm a living witness. I'm not preaching this because I ain't gone through nothing. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching this because I've gone through some stuff and and I I realize, buddy, if you let your feelings dictate your actions, you going to be in trouble. &gt;&gt; You You're going to be in trouble. You'll end up finding yourself back out there with a Newport and a bottle of Henny and and everything else. &gt;&gt; Huh? Not me. No. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. Y'all think I was just born on yesterday, but I wasn't. I've been preaching this gospel for 32 years &gt;&gt; and I'm still growing. &gt;&gt; And and when it when it when it come to the gospel, I'm not going to short change you. I'll quit before I start short changing. &gt;&gt; Right. I would quit preaching. I sit in the back of the church. Amen to brothers. But I can't do it. I ain't built like that. God didn't build me like that. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm here to be shouldertosh shoulder with brother Jack to preach the gospel. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not concerned about our feelings. You know, God will take care of your feelings &gt;&gt; if they get hurt. But the Bible say, "Blessed is he that is not offended in me." How could you be offended at the word? &gt;&gt; Right. It may be just something that's beyond what you ever even imagined, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who's supposed to get this mic? &gt;&gt; Brother Troy, you better come on get it. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord, right [singing] now.
