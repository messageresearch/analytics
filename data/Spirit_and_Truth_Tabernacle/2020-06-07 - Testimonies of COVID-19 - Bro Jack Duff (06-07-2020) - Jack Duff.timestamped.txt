[34:29] raise funds for our new church into
[34:33] school we're not just saying that but
[34:35] we're putting my money where our mouth
[34:37] is and we had a goal for this year of
[34:41] reason 105 thousand dollars and we
[34:44] received pledges towards that goal of
[34:46] sixty thousand nine dollars say man and
[34:49] so far on those pledges the money that
[34:52] has been received as of today is fifteen
[34:55] thousand one hundred forty five dollars
[34:57] and nine cent amen we thank God for that
[35:01] fifteen thousand one hundred forty-five
[35:03] dollars at 9:00 a.m. and just last month
[35:06] alone a man we receive two thousand
[35:09] three hundred seventy-five dollars so
[35:11] also we've gained interest on the money
[35:14] the
[35:15] fans just cut the race with this covet
[35:18] 19 hit and we haven't been gaining much
[35:19] interest but nonetheless we got some
[35:21] interest and it's 271 dollars and 27 and
[35:24] I gives us a total net of fifteen
[35:28] thousand four hundred sixteen dollars
[35:30] and twenty nine cent that has been
[35:31] accumulated this year and our building
[35:34] firm we have not had to use that for any

[35:40] that
[35:40] amen we really really thank God for that
[35:42] so thank you so much for your giving and
[35:45] anyone that would like to join us in our
[35:48] project we certainly will appreciate
[35:52] that amen the Lord bless you thank you
[35:55] brother Troy you can turn the lights on
[35:58] there musicians thank you amen
[36:02] we just appreciate the Lord we had a
[36:04] wonderful time this morning a man in the
[36:07] service of the Lord and just kind of was
[36:10] on my heart to kind of take these two
[36:13] services today just some things that are
[36:15] just from a pastoral standpoint I think
[36:17] I needed to share and and then I wanted
[36:21] to come back here for this service and
[36:24] and just go a little different direction
[36:26] but I pray to be a blessing a man to us
[36:29] on today I want to read a scripture that
[36:33] was given to us a man during this season
[36:38] and I am grateful for this scripture
[36:43] that was sent to us and and I believe
[36:47] it's very appropriate for the time this
[36:51] is the book of jeremiah chapter 17 verse
[36:56] 7 through 10 day men the Book of
[36:59] Jeremiah 17 verse 7 through 10 the Bible
[37:05] reads blessed is the man that trusteth
[37:10] in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is a
[37:17] man are confident
[37:19] is in Christ's a man we can't trust
[37:22] nothing else but Jesus amen he's the
[37:25] only thing that will not fail think we
[37:28] were listening to the tape on Friday
[37:30] night and brother branham said that he
[37:32] is a sure foundation a man we can't we
[37:36] can rest on Jesus glory to God blessed
[37:39] is the man that trusteth in the Lord and
[37:41] he was hope the Lord is for he shall be
[37:44] as a tree planted by the waters and that
[37:50] spreadeth out her roots by the river and
[37:53] shall not see when the heat cometh right
[37:58] because so when he cometh that tree
[38:00] would start withering different things
[38:02] would start happening to it you know
[38:04] just just going through all kind of
[38:06] changes when he comes but but because
[38:09] it's planted a man by by a river
[38:13] represents flowing water is constantly
[38:16] flowing right so here because it's
[38:19] planted there it says roots by the
[38:23] spread of the roots by the river and
[38:25] shall not see when he cometh but her
[38:27] leaf shall be green and shall not be
[38:30] careful in the year of drought neither
[38:33] shall cease from yielding fruit so in
[38:37] the midst of a drought this tree is
[38:39] supposed to keep yielding from
[38:44] I like that a man I think that's talking
[38:47] about us a man I i'ma say it talks about
[38:52] you it talks about me this is our life
[38:55] represented here in the scripture the
[38:56] Bible says the heart is deceitful above
[38:58] all things and desperately wicked no I
[39:03] the Lord SERP start I try the Rings even
[39:08] to give every man according to his way
[39:11] and according to the fruit of his doings
[39:14] Amen the Lord had a blessing to the
[39:16] reading of his word let's just bow in a
[39:18] word of Prayer
[39:19] father we approached your word we have
[39:21] read scripture and we thank you Mark for
[39:24] the precious sister that sent this to us
[39:28] from Georgia Lord sister Tucson there we
[39:33] thank you for this and encouragement a
[39:36] man that we could have and we just draw
[39:39] a little strength of little felt from
[39:41] this on today and just pray that it just
[39:43] be a help to us Lord as we press into
[39:47] this service be glorified and magnified
[39:49] not only by those that are that are here
[39:52] present but those that are watching
[39:53] online be glorified and magnified in
[39:56] their lives in Jesus name we pray amen
[39:58] and amen god bless you can be seated so
[40:08] I I struggle with this I mentioned this
[40:14] a man little earlier and brother brother
[40:18] Diggs kind of took it from him and they
[40:21] called it the blessings of covet 19 and
[40:23] I'm gonna just use a test I'm gonna use
[40:25] the title of the testimony testimonies
[40:28] of covet 19 but and that's that's that's
[40:31] for a reason out I'll say that low
[40:33] leaders just I know that many have
[40:35] suffered some things through this but
[40:38] but you know there's I think we also
[40:40] need to take time to glorify God and
[40:43] some of the things that he has done in
[40:47] the midst of what we have faced I was
[40:49] mentioning to the church when first
[40:51] started God's already on the other side
[40:53] of this waiting bust again
[40:54] right and you know and and sometimes
[40:57] it's just good to go back and look and
[40:58] see what the Lord has done a man we give
[41:02] the devil too much credit sometime hey
[41:04] man let's let's exalt Jesus amen just
[41:08] for a few minutes we want to exalt the
[41:10] Lord Jesus so I want to just first just
[41:13] read a quarter to a man before we get
[41:16] into these testimonies this a man is
[41:18] coming from the sermon the Good Shepherd
[41:21] of the sheep and this scripture that I
[41:24] read I have a little program where it
[41:27] helps us to find different places where
[41:31] brother Branham might have spoken
[41:32] concerning that scriptures something
[41:34] that might be related to it and what
[41:36] when I did my search it actually kind of
[41:39] pointed to this scripture in Jeremiah 17
[41:41] but Jeremiah 17 also ties into Psalms
[41:44] chapter 1 we'll read that in a little
[41:46] bit but David says very similar words
[41:49] that Jeremiah says amen and we want to
[41:52] just kind of catch that so our hope and
[41:54] our trust is in God a man and I just
[41:58] want to read this just kind of get us
[41:59] started this message Good Shepherd of
[42:01] the sheep the prophet makes a statement
[42:03] he says we learn a lot of things by
[42:06] sheep so just by watching sheep we learn
[42:10] a lot of things he says if we could just
[42:12] notice them and watch their actions and
[42:15] she is a sacrificial animal hallelujah a
[42:22] sheep is not an animal that bucks and
[42:24] kicks against amen different things a
[42:28] sheep actually bears its rule to
[42:30] sacrifice amen and when the owner comes
[42:33] to take the rule from the Sheep they
[42:35] just give it up with no problem they
[42:37] made a sheep actually gives us it right
[42:40] its rights a sheep forfeits those things
[42:43] the Sheep don't try to hold on to
[42:47] subin's is one that has a very weak
[42:50] nature a soup is one that's she a sheep
[42:57] is a different animal than any other God
[43:00] God God Himself his representatives as
[43:02] sheep as read I mean that's the way he
[43:04] could go to a cross he had to humble
[43:06] himself to go to that cross hallelujah
[43:08] sheep is willing to give up things he
[43:11] may look and say a ship is a sacrificial
[43:14] animal little innocent fellow and he's
[43:17] totally helpless
[43:19] when he's lost amen I think that's why
[43:22] Jesus liking us unto sheep because they
[43:26] just can't seem to find their way around
[43:27] they have to depend on me a man must say
[44:03] they just won't do it and that goes to
[44:05] show me one thing it will like it to
[44:08] shoot in God's heritage then we can
[44:11] [Music]
[44:15] amen we are helpless and we've got to
[44:19] depend on the great Shepherd of the
[44:20] sheep the Lord Jesus he says I noticed
[44:23] that the slaughterhouse once someone was
[44:26] speaking to me about how they slaughter
[44:28] the Sheep
[44:29] and when they want the Sheep to come up
[44:31] to come out of the corral and go up the
[44:33] chute where they kill the Sheep go leave
[44:36] them up there they'll follow the goats
[44:39] and this goat will lead them up to the
[44:41] place where the killing takes place and
[44:44] then he will jump right onto that death
[44:49] that's just the nature of the goat so
[44:53] you want to make sure you're not falling
[44:54] on a goat and I'm gonna tell you
[44:56] something about a goat and a sheep from
[44:58] what I hear brother branham is gonna
[45:00] tell us a little bit later the way today
[45:02] sound hallelujah amen they both sound
[45:05] the thing well it's hard to tell the
[45:33] difference between the bleeding of a
[45:36] goat and of a sheep there are a lot
[45:39] alike but the nature of them proves
[45:42] where they are last away with confessed
[45:44] Christians and real Christians the goat
[45:46] represents the role they'll lead you
[45:49] right down the wrong road to your
[45:51] eternal separation from God
[45:52] they'll lead you into trouble so if we
[45:55] are simply better watch where counter
[45:57] Shepherd we got all right I like
[46:01] I like that I was thinking I'm gonna
[46:04] come back to this quote in a second but
[46:05] you know I was thinking on this
[46:07] you know I was one time we were set up
[46:11] you know sheep have different nature
[46:13] date certain
[46:13] they don't even think certain lease
[46:15] right they just suggest they just got a
[46:17] way of presenting themselves and you
[46:19] know as as God's people even when we
[46:22] were sinners there are certain things
[46:23] that we just wouldn't do other folk
[46:26] matter did it but we didn't think that
[46:27] way and I remember we you know one time
[46:29] we invited this young man to come to our
[46:31] house you know just to kind of hang out
[46:34] at the house with us and and you know he
[46:36] comes over and you know has it has a
[46:37] good time and and you know and and then
[46:40] on the way on the way home me and my
[46:42] brother had to walk the fella home and
[46:44] daddy told us walk come on make sure you
[46:46] get home safely sorry all right no
[46:48] problem we walked him home and as we're
[46:50] getting down the street we get almost to
[46:51] where his house is
[46:52] now our house is weighed the other way
[46:55] but we get to almost where his house is
[46:57] and this fella I don't know where he got
[46:59] this idea from he just he found a rock
[47:01] in the street somewhere picked the rock
[47:03] up and just threw it at a car and almost
[47:05] broke the window and so now we weren't
[47:08] thinking like that we didn't think about
[47:10] picking up rocks and throwing them at
[47:11] cause we that was not part of our nature
[47:13] but this guy thought that was just very
[47:15] funny so he picked the rock up and he
[47:17] threw it and and before you know it that
[47:19] car made a u-turn and that car was
[47:22] coming back towards us now we don't know
[47:24] what to do
[47:25] and so we see him take off running so we
[47:27] take off running right not now the
[47:30] problem is if we get separated somebody
[47:32] gonna be in trouble
[47:33] right so so so we you know we finally
[47:36] got out of the thing and and now you
[47:38] gonna be home but we gotta walk back the
[47:41] same way that we just pain right made
[47:45] you not even thinking about how you put
[47:47] us in danger
[47:48] see we got realize it but even at that
[47:51] time we had nature
[47:58] we perform like dogs we didn't do things
[48:01] like that so being a Christian you
[48:03] better believe I'm gonna act like a
[48:05] sheep I'm gonna I'm gonna talk like a
[48:07] sheep I'm gonna swab like a sheep the
[48:10] way that got in the way why the guy
[48:11] expects me to respond that's what I'm
[48:13] gonna do Roly to God he says this he
[48:17] says now
[48:19] shiipa funny like creatures in one way
[48:22] he says here's another thing that we
[48:24] might learn of sheep tonight when the
[48:26] weather is real hot did you ever see
[48:29] sheep they won't separate themselves and
[48:32] one be at one place and one at another
[48:35] but right in the heat of the day the
[48:38] sheep will all stand together you know
[48:41] what they're doing they're making shade
[48:44] for the other
[48:47] that's what sheep they don't separate
[48:50] when things get hot they actually come
[48:52] together and they make shame for each
[48:54] other if somebody's trying to separate
[48:57] the sheep you already know that the
[49:00] right spirits like the Sheep they may
[49:05] quote scripture like the Sheep creating
[49:10] separation for one another they're
[49:20] having fellowship glory to God if
[49:24] there's ever time to make shame for a
[49:26] brother it's this time now if there's
[49:29] any time to make shape our sister
[49:34] glory to God brother branham don't say
[49:37] it will it be good if all God's sheep
[49:40] when the heat was on would stand
[49:42] together when the trials are real hard
[49:44] in the heat is on everything going on
[49:46] everywhere if all of God's little sheep
[49:49] would just stand together we'd have the
[49:52] coolness of the shade of each of them
[49:55] the comfort to lean upon each other now
[49:58] someone said is that necessary brother
[50:00] brother it certainly is there's nothing
[50:02] like having a real good dependable
[50:04] friend that when the troubles are
[50:07] blazing the Heat's on you can go to this
[50:09] friend and sat down to just explain it
[50:11] to them talk it over in personal
[50:13] confidence and then see not just now
[50:15] this could love us we talked it over but
[50:18] this is the part we miss it and being
[50:20] kneel down and pray together and know
[50:29] that this person is a good god save man
[50:32] a woman that you can put confidence in
[50:35] oh it's good to do that come let us
[50:37] reason together saith the scripture I
[50:39] come let us stand together it says and I
[50:43] noticed another thing we'll see when I
[50:45] see sheep and coat in a coal country
[50:47] when all the Sheep the blizzards come to
[50:49] break the wind all those little sheep
[50:52] will come from one side of the field to
[50:54] the other and hold it up together
[50:55] it keeps each other warm the warmth from
[50:59] each body helps warm the other so
[51:03] whether it's hot or whether it's cool
[51:05] the Sheep can always stay together glory
[51:10] to God if you pulling away something
[51:12] wrong with your nature he goes who says
[51:15] and I think when the church gets real
[51:17] cold and indifferent God's sheep are the
[51:19] kind of huddle up together and pray for
[51:22] each other and the warmth of a real good
[51:25] Christian Fellowship oh it means so much
[51:28] we talked about all God's sheep hey I
[51:32] want to say we talked about all Godsey
[51:37] when we come under the blood we become
[51:40] she hey man we don't look at the color
[51:44] of our skin anymore we will you see and
[51:46] we all got huddled together glory to God
[51:50] hallelujah amen I think that when the
[51:53] church gets real : and different God's
[51:55] sheep ought to count I'll hold up
[51:56] together and pray for each other and the
[51:59] warmth of a real good Christian
[52:01] Fellowship oh it means so much David
[52:03] spoke of it in the first Psalm said
[52:05] blessed is the man that said if not in
[52:07] the seat of the scornful standeth in the
[52:09] way of sinners but his delight is in the
[52:11] law of the Lord and in the law doth he
[52:13] meditate day and night and he should be
[52:15] like a tree that's planted by the river
[52:16] water and his leash or not whither
[52:18] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so
[52:20] that scripture that he's quoting we're
[52:22] gonna read that Psalms 1 we'll just grab
[52:24] that
[52:24] but that connects right back to Jeremiah
[52:26] 17 amen
[52:28] verse 7 and 8 verse 7 sent blessed is
[52:31] the man that trusteth in the Lord and
[52:33] whose hope the Lord is verse 8 and
[52:35] Jeremiah 17 said for he shall be as a
[52:38] tree planted by the waters and that
[52:42] spreadeth out a ruse by the river and
[52:44] shell and and shall not see when the
[52:46] heat come it but a leaf shall be green
[52:47] and shall not be careful in the year
[52:50] drought neither shall cease from
[52:52] yielding fruit and brother branham
[52:53] taught it over here to Psalms 1 verse 1
[52:56] through 6 blessed is the man oh my I
[53:00] like this statement I mean as David just
[53:03] started writing songs his first song
[53:06] bliss is the man and I must say blessed
[53:10] is the Worman that walketh not
[53:13] hallelujah amen if you want to be
[53:16] blessed you can't listen to other folk
[53:18] capsule that's not Christians I'm about
[53:21] if you really want to be
[53:31] [Music]
[53:45] [Music]
[54:04] now when you get like that when you can
[54:08] walk like that and think like that and
[54:10] talk like that no matter what's going on
[54:12] around you the Bible say he shall be
[54:15] like a tree o also shall not wither and
[54:27] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper man I
[54:32] just I just I'm just blessed amen when I
[54:35] read this scripture you know and I want
[54:38] to talk about these testimonies of co19
[54:40] you know in the midst of this you
[54:42] supposed to prosper if you follow the
[54:45] Word of God you know you're supposed to
[54:47] prosper come on somebody
[54:50] amen you are supposed to prosper you
[54:53] suppose a prosperous spiritually you're
[54:55] supposed to prosper physically you're
[54:58] supposed to prosper amen financially
[55:01] you're supposed to prosper in whatever
[55:03] way you got to live you're supposed to
[55:06] prosper amen because your truth is
[55:08] splinted huh Amen by the rivers of water
[55:12] you're gonna bring forth fruit in your
[55:15] season it might not be
[55:17] season but it's your season Lolita car
[55:21] can I tell you something if season hey I
[55:37] know what I'm talking about here this
[55:39] morning a man I'm walking in my season a
[55:42] maybe knowing that brother I was down
[55:45] there at the Pool of Bethesda and there
[55:47] was a whole bunch of folk waiting for
[55:50] the angel of trouble the water
[55:52] the Bible said in a certain season a man
[55:55] at that age will come in in trouble the
[55:57] water but do you realize that the angel
[56:00] was not there trouble in the world the
[56:02] man was still waiting but because Jesus
[56:08] came to him
[56:31] [Music]

[57:19] [Applause]
[57:35] [Music]
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:46] but I like the wind
[57:49] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[57:52] the judgment nor sinners in the
[57:53] congregation of the righteous for the
[57:55] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[57:58] but the way of their ungodly Shall
[58:01] Perish blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:04] all right amen let me uh just kind of
[58:08] read a couple more things here and then
[58:12] we'll go into some testimonies and man
[58:14] this is coming out of message Jehovah
[58:16] Jireh thank you lord thank you Jesus hey
[58:21] man he says and remember you remember
[58:26] the bright free message says many who
[58:29] takes the tape how did the husbandman
[58:31] came forth and it was bearing the wrong
[58:34] kind of fruit so we cut it off cut it
[58:36] off can't keep cutting it back cutting
[58:39] it back but Joe sent what
[58:41] ha more left the caterpillar eating what

[58:49] stage and what the Lutheran left the
[58:52] Methodists eaten well the men that is
[58:54] left the Baptist's eaten what the
[58:56] Baptist's left the Pentecostals eaten

[59:01] I will restore sayeth the Lord all the
[59:04] years
[59:05] I'll send back another Church in the
[59:07] last day I will restore that original
[59:10] power again now I love that you know
[59:14] this this Sunday amen
[59:18] and I wasn't even you know I just
[59:20] happened to hear somebody talking about
[59:21] on yesterday but I wasn't even in tuned
[59:25] with what was going on but this Sunday
[59:27] represents what they called Pentecost
[59:29] Sunday right so 50 days after a man the
[59:34] the crucifixion and resurrection amen
[59:37] this was a 50 days after this went an
[59:39] original Pentecost took place so you
[59:41] know they always kind of celebrate this
[59:44] just throughout the years and we
[59:45] realized east to keep changing every
[59:47] year they man and that that's all from a
[59:50] pagan system that generates that
[59:52] hallelujah
[59:53] hey I know some people they'd only want
[59:55] to celebrate Easter because of that
[59:56] pagan system I think it's good we
[59:58] celebrate Easter amen because it
[1:00:01] represents our Lord and Savior amen or
[1:00:03] rising again and I don't just celebrate
[1:00:05] Easter at Easter I celebrate it every
[1:00:08] day every time I see the Sun Rise I'm
[1:00:11] celebrating Easter hallelujah right so
[1:00:14] so you know but but we know things shift
[1:00:17] like that but yet this year this is
[1:00:18] supposed to be Pentecost Sunday where
[1:00:20] the church should be thinking about how
[1:00:23] the power of God move some 2,000 years
[1:00:27] ago amen that the political arena has
[1:00:30] our minds ticking on other things we
[1:00:32] should be praying for another move of
[1:00:34] the Spirit huh we should be looking for
[1:00:37] another move of the Spirit amen
[1:00:39] he said I'll pour my spirit upon all
[1:00:41] flesh my your sons and your daughters
[1:00:43] will prophesy dream dreams we should see
[1:00:46] the supernatural God moving in the midst
[1:00:48] of his people

[1:00:52] hallelujah look at this now he says I
[1:00:57] will restore said the Lord all the years

[1:01:01] last days I'll restore that original
[1:01:04] power again in the evening time it shall
[1:01:08] be light down in the heart of that tree
[1:01:10] no matter how many branches is food
[1:01:13] there will come forth the royal seed of
[1:01:16] Abraham

[1:01:20] it he said he would do it I will restore
[1:01:23] the years that the denomination's eat I

[1:01:29] my lovers been ate up by denomination
[1:01:30] but God say he go restore all the
[1:01:34] denominations but but yet they were
[1:01:42] coming out of the heart of it he'll be
[1:01:45] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[1:01:47] of water a man that meditates in the
[1:01:50] Word of God day and night not to a
[1:01:52] Creator denomination see what you're
[1:01:54] thinking about at night but what you're
[1:01:57] reading at night I want to encourage you

[1:02:02] of God and let the Word of God just
[1:02:04] become part of you whilst it says it

[1:02:08] Word of God day and night not to accrete
[1:02:10] a denomination but meditates in the word

[1:02:19] forth his fruit in the season God

[1:05:17] things that has happened and and I want
[1:05:19] to say this before I get started with
[1:05:20] some of these testimonies I want to
[1:05:23] express my sincerest condolences so
[1:05:26] anyone that has been impacted negatively
[1:05:28] by this virus I just got a text on my
[1:05:32] phone this morning pastor in Africa that
[1:05:37] has passed away I don't know if it was
[1:05:39] covert 19 relator said he just had a
[1:05:41] brief sickness and he died and you know
[1:05:44] and at this time there's many there's
[1:05:46] there's many churches that have lost
[1:05:47] pastors we got friends that have lost
[1:05:50] loved ones and and and I I do I do not
[1:05:52] want to minimize what they have
[1:05:57] experienced during this time I know that
[1:05:59] that is that's rough I know that stuff
[1:06:01] any time you lose the love when it's
[1:06:03] tough you know
[1:06:03] I know churches that have been impacted
[1:06:06] multiple people in the church have have
[1:06:09] gone on to be with the Lord and you know
[1:06:10] as a Christian we know that whether it
[1:06:13] was covert 19 or whether it was a car
[1:06:15] accident or whether it was a plane going
[1:06:17] down whether it was you know you just
[1:06:19] died in your sleep
[1:06:20] you know anytime a Christian leaves it's
[1:06:22] a benefit for them a man they did not
[1:06:25] lose when they when they when they go
[1:06:27] death becomes a vehicle that carries us
[1:06:29] into the presence of Almighty God but
[1:06:32] nonetheless when we're here on this side
[1:06:33] we still miss our loved ones and we
[1:06:36] understand that and our prayers are that
[1:06:38] God would just strengthen and encourage
[1:06:40] and help those during this time a man a
[1:06:43] pastor reached out to me I think
[1:06:44] yesterday and told me and his church
[1:06:46] that they one of the oldest Saints got
[1:06:49] sick he'd been sickly for a while and
[1:06:51] and he got he got the virus and he ended
[1:06:54] up dying and you know going on and he
[1:06:56] said you know they they had to go
[1:06:57] through some things like that night and
[1:06:58] I know that those are hard things that
[1:07:00] you have to deal with you know I know I
[1:07:03] can say thank God we haven't had to bury
[1:07:05] anybody here and that to me that's a
[1:07:07] blessing
[1:07:09] that's the blessing praise the Lord Amen
[1:07:13] so we certainly sympathize with
[1:07:16] everybody and we trust that God will
[1:07:18] continue to comfort your hearts but I
[1:07:20] just wanted to take this time to simply
[1:07:22] highlight some of the positive events
[1:07:25] that also have occurred during this
[1:07:27] pandemic a man if that's all right so I
[1:07:30] was fellowshipping a man with some other
[1:07:34] ministers and and and as we were
[1:07:37] fellowship and there's one brother as a
[1:07:38] pastor out of Texas his name is brother
[1:07:40] Jeremy and I brother Jeremy sent out a
[1:07:42] whatsapp message he says your brother's
[1:07:45] colleges share some testimonies with me
[1:07:47] of some things that God has done in the
[1:07:49] midst of this pandemic and and as we as
[1:07:52] we just everybody just begin to chime in
[1:07:54] and talk about little things that the
[1:07:56] Lord has done at the churches and you
[1:07:59] know so brother Jeremy took it and he he
[1:08:01] developed a sermon and he preached the
[1:08:03] message I got good news
[1:08:05] hey man so I need to listen to that one
[1:08:07] brother so so he got it and and so this
[1:08:11] week I was just kind of thinking to
[1:08:13] myself so I would love to maybe take
[1:08:14] that same list and bring it to our
[1:08:16] church so I reached out to the to the
[1:08:18] ministers and I also reached out to
[1:08:19] brother Jer Jeremy I say brother Jeremy
[1:08:22] could just send me that list that you
[1:08:23] had you know you ride and preached it
[1:08:25] give me what you got you know and he and
[1:08:27] he sent me the list though I say well
[1:08:28] praise the Lord so I won't just kind of
[1:08:30] share with you some things that happened
[1:08:32] amen during this time hallelujah brother
[1:08:35] Jer and maintenance note he says he says
[1:08:37] I sent messages to many ministers across
[1:08:39] the nation asking for a testimony of
[1:08:41] what God has done during this time where
[1:08:43] Satan thinks he's got us amen but he
[1:08:46] said here's another edition of take that
[1:08:49] devil hey man we write in another
[1:08:54] edition of I like that brother Branham
[1:08:58] say when the devil say boo
[1:09:00] say boo
[1:09:02] and this is our edition of Sam go back
[1:09:05] to the devil hallelujah amen so this
[1:09:09] first thing is a pastor in Alberta
[1:09:11] Canada a man said that the last full
[1:09:15] service before the lockdown
[1:09:18] amen the Holy Spirit came in such a
[1:09:21] powerful way that the anointing led to
[1:09:24] an altar service and a number of the
[1:09:27] young people got a breakthrough one was
[1:09:30] baptized and others he said in his
[1:09:33] Senate testimony others finally found
[1:09:36] Liberty in worship what a man I said God
[1:09:42] can do it in our brother their God can
[1:09:44] do it here also calling people getting
[1:09:48] to number two you've had a breakthrough
[1:09:53] one was baptized others finally found
[1:09:55] Liberty in worship and the service
[1:09:57] lasted till midnight
[1:09:59] and that has been etched in our hearts
[1:10:01] during this time so before the lockdown
[1:10:03] they had a service that lasted till
[1:10:05] midnight naked as feast and fellowship
[1:10:07] or next hallelujah see God beat the
[1:10:10] devil to the to the punch
[1:10:11] Saint man another word brother Ron
[1:10:14] Spencer he's a pastor Amen up in
[1:10:17] Virginia area and brother Ron's been
[1:10:19] going through some things with cancer
[1:10:21] and he and he put there in the late I
[1:10:23] put there as his response a brother
[1:10:24] Jeremy say this may seem small to some
[1:10:28] but but I'm still alive
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:33] because he was diagnosed with cancer
[1:11:26] they was doing all kind of tests even
[1:11:28] during the midst of all of this but he
[1:11:30] say he made it out and made it back to
[1:11:31] his pulpit to preach the gospel say I'm
[1:11:33] still alive I got something thank God
[1:11:35] for and the devoman trying to wipe that
[1:11:37] brother for years but even Kovac
[1:11:40] couldn't get him so I chimed in to I
[1:11:47] said brother I got some of the friends
[1:11:49] guys I said we've we baptized for new
[1:11:52] converts during the lockdown and I say
[1:11:55] if Heaven is rejoicing over somebody
[1:11:57] repenting then we rejoice them as well
[1:12:02] we got something to praise God for now I
[1:12:05] want to challenge the church I don't
[1:12:07] want to just stop at those Saints being
[1:12:09] baptized I just believe that if a person
[1:12:13] can be led to come to baptism then they
[1:12:16] can also be led to come to truth so I'm
[1:12:18] praying that God would continue to deal
[1:12:20] with their hearts that they will walk
[1:12:22] through these doors and find fellowship
[1:12:25] they man so pray for them for Souls amen
[1:12:29] let's pray to we a man they say push
[1:12:31] pray till something happens
[1:12:33] let's keep praying I mean grandpa dem
[1:12:35] forces God that came to Tobit we don't
[1:12:37] want to see them lost let them come now
[1:12:39] and get underneath the covering of the
[1:12:41] world get some truth amen

[1:13:02] streaming is actually bringing the
[1:13:04] prodigal daughter you might not have

[1:13:09] colvett we had to do streaming and the

[1:15:39] want me to give y'all but I got a lot
[1:15:40] here all righty man this is this now
[1:15:44] this testimony is in two parts and man
[1:15:46] this is about brother sister Karen
[1:15:48] Pruett this is brother Tim Pruitt's wife

[1:15:57] and they heard it he'll do it again
[1:15:59] amen they just they heard that he'll do
[1:16:02] it again and the song just really began
[1:16:05] to minister to them and they didn't
[1:16:07] realize why the song meant so much to
[1:16:09] him consistent Karen end up going to the
[1:16:12] hospital with a brain bleed in the midst
[1:16:14] of Kovach 19 she went up going to the
[1:16:18] hospital with a brain bleed just as bad

[1:16:22] right so just and and she had this the
[1:16:25] same bleed in the same spot five years
[1:16:28] earlier right and then they couldn't
[1:16:31] believe that it showed up in the same

[1:21:26] around and went back home and the house
[1:21:28] was a new house the reason he couldn't
[1:21:30] get free was because he did something
[1:21:33] years ago that he never made right
[1:21:35] hallelujah that happened in Kovac
[1:21:38] nineteen glory to God we had a another
[1:21:42] request since I'm talking about brothers
[1:21:44] brother Nathan and si I want to also say
[1:21:46] this because you might ask well why did
[1:21:48] sister Karen have to go through and
[1:21:51] brother brother Jeremy put this in his
[1:21:53] notes and I want to bring it out so why
[1:21:55] did sister Karen have to go through her
[1:21:57] ordeal and it happened in the same spot
[1:22:00] it's because it produced a prayer from
[1:22:03] brother Nathan to get in contact with
[1:22:06] God and when that anointing came down it
[1:22:09] also produced a release for another
[1:22:12] family he might not have had that burden
[1:22:15] had it not been sister Karen
[1:22:18] God uses everything for his glory don't
[1:22:22] you worry about what you're going
[1:22:24] through
[1:22:24] God don't use that to help somebody else
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:33] brother Nathan's mom we've been praying
[1:22:35] for her sister Dottie Bryant during this
[1:22:37] time was diagnosed with stage four
[1:22:39] cancer and we've saw we brother Nathan's
[1:22:42] come here and pray for different ones
[1:22:44] who's been set free from different
[1:22:46] things God has heard his prayer for
[1:22:47] healing of the sick with praying that
[1:22:49] God will hear the prayer you know for
[1:22:50] his mom you know we're just encouraging
[1:22:52] him and whatever whatever way we can
[1:22:54] again having to go to the hospital by
[1:22:56] herself nobody can go in there with and
[1:22:59] and she was kind of telling the family
[1:23:00] please don't tell everybody what's going
[1:23:02] on just just wait until we get some
[1:23:04] things from the doctor just keep it keep
[1:23:06] everything at bay brother Nathan was
[1:23:08] feeling like momma you know people keep

[1:23:23] so Nathan say I wanted to go out and
[1:23:26] tell the church you know what was going
[1:23:28] on and but before I did that I wanted to
[1:23:30] tell my children what was happening now

[1:37:24] sister Sorel come through the door today
[1:37:26] another confirmation because mr. Sorrell
[1:37:29] had been streaming the services and we
[1:37:31] had things on Facebook were streaming

[1:37:37] got a notification from I believe one of

[1:43:09] blessed the businesses where they begin
[1:43:10] to pick up others start at new
[1:43:13] businesses even during this time that's
[1:43:15] that's the blessing of God and one thing

[1:43:20] bring this to a close our business that
[1:43:23] the Lord gave us through whatever you do
[1:43:24] supposed to prosper but our business
[1:43:27] that the Lord gave us right before Kovac
[1:43:29] we had three clients that God had
[1:43:31] blessed us with and and because of Kovac
[1:43:33] different reasons we ended up losing all
[1:43:36] the claims just different reasons
[1:43:38] everybody had something different and we
[1:43:40] understood but you know I took it upon
[1:43:43] myself there was a thing that I knew for
[1:43:45] the business I needed to invest in it in
[1:43:48] order to take it to another level and
[1:43:49] and I said some paperwork that I got to
[1:43:52] fill out got to submit it got to do this

[1:44:00] paperwork and and I think like May 24th

[1:46:34] another episode of take that devil
[1:46:39] [Applause]
[1:46:50] blessed be the name of the Lord a man a
[1:46:55] man a man let me read this last quote
[1:46:58] when their eyes were open this last
[1:47:01] quote the musicians you all can prepare
[1:47:04] to come today man when their eyes were
[1:47:07] open it says how many read the sermon
[1:47:11] when omnipotence speaks miracles happen
[1:47:16] did you believe that certainly I'm nipa
[1:47:19] to spoke at every Junction and when the
[1:47:22] church cooled off and the omnipotent
[1:47:24] spoke smear spoke
[1:47:25] miracles takes place and this is a
[1:47:28] junction of all junctions this is the
[1:47:31] end time the end of the whole history of
[1:47:34] the world is right now at hand so you
[1:47:36] can expect omnipotence to speak and you
[1:47:39] can expect the greatest and mightiest
[1:47:41] miracles that's ever happened on the
[1:47:44] earth will happen in the next few years
[1:47:48] to come I say amen to that
[1:47:50] if Jesus carries it will be there watch
[1:47:54] for sitting Therese
[1:47:56] up his - when all heaven turns loose all
[1:47:59] hell turns loose - and it's prophesied
[1:48:02] that there be a Janus and Jambres on the
[1:48:05] earth in the last days who would almost
[1:48:07] impersonate the real thing so close in
[1:48:09] to deceive the very elect if possible
[1:48:11] see so we're looking for all of that so
[1:48:13] my Christian friend the best thing for
[1:48:16] you to do and I to do is the stay just
[1:48:20] as close to the Lord Jesus as we can
[1:48:23] love him and pray daily that God would
[1:48:26] help us and guide us that we'll be on
[1:48:28] his side when the end finally comes
[1:48:30] that's our that's the that's our desire
[1:48:32] our heart and I'm sure if we're sincere
[1:48:34] in our heart and study his word and
[1:48:36] receive all that he has for us will not
[1:48:38] be deceived by the Antichrist and his
[1:48:40] power did you notice the Antichrist can
[1:48:43] do everything but he'll he can't heal
[1:48:45] did you notice Janice and Jambres when
[1:48:47] they stood against Moses they could do
[1:48:49] they could do every
[1:48:51] but he'll they could bring curses but
[1:48:54] they couldn't take it away see God's the
[1:48:56] only healer there is he's the only one
[1:48:59] can heal and today we have the finest
[1:49:01] hospitals we ever had finest doctors we
[1:49:04] ever had smartest doctors bet the best
[1:49:07] doctors the best drugs we have a
[1:49:09] practice with don't you believe that and
[1:49:11] we got more sickness than we ever had
[1:49:13] why we got more sin and unbelief than we
[1:49:16] ever had and unbelief is sin a man but
[1:49:21] by the grace of God we are trusting in
[1:49:25] our Lord amen we're we're not we're not
[1:49:28] worried about what everybody else a man
[1:49:31] is following the part about we're not
[1:49:33] standing in the way of sinners and a man
[1:49:36] and then the seat of the scornful but
[1:49:38] are the lightest in the law of the Lord
[1:49:41] and in his law do we meditate day and
[1:49:43] night Amen we're not taking the counsel
[1:49:46] of the ungodly

[2:06:37] God to move
[2:06:40] I believe God is moving what an
[2:06:46] encouragement
[2:06:48] see how God is still moving
[2:06:52] - Supernatural way
[2:06:56] taking a man out of it taking just man
[2:06:59] can't get any glory from it

[2:07:42] expecting a miracle and he's never
[2:07:47] failed me you know it's a miracle when

[2:07:53] miracle when you leave the house and you

[2:08:00] cupboards and their fool in the midst of
[2:08:04] a pandemic

[2:08:10] a supernatural God drops down a
[2:08:14] revelation into your heart it's a
[2:08:18] miracle
[2:08:19] miracles happen every day but because
[2:08:22] we're not looking for them expecting we
[2:08:25] don't recognize and we miss a good
[2:08:30] opportunity to just praise God praise
[2:08:33] Him for the big things the little things
[2:08:37] he's always working in our favor hey man
