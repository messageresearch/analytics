[52:56] Lucie and um
[52:58] he was just telling me that he had a
[53:01] situation where he got a ticket and he
[53:03] was you know he said he know he was
[53:04] wrong because he was driving with the
[53:07] speed of traffic and he said he never
[53:09] really had never gotten a ticket before
[53:10] and uh he says this will affect my job
[53:14] and since I really need to get this kind
[53:15] of thrown out some kind of way and he
[53:18] just began to pray over it and he says
[53:20] um I felt they had to go talk to there
[53:22] was a police officer that lives in my
[53:23] neighborhood so I went to talk to him
[53:25] and explain to my situation and say look
[53:26] I know I'm guilty I'm not trying to get
[53:29] out of exit but I just can't take those
[53:30] points if you can just help me some kind
[53:32] of way just help me navigate this so he

[53:36] you the ticket and um and so it waited a
[53:39] couple days and he had never gotten with
[53:41] him he says I tell you what to do what
[53:42] you need to do is ask for an extension
[53:44] on it it says because when you get the
[53:46] extension uh that guy won't even be
[53:49] around to show up to go to court so
[53:50] it'll be thrown out and you won't have
[53:53] uh you won't have to worry about that he
[53:55] said well that's what I was praying that

[57:02] comfort Lord and even as we would go to
[57:04] try to present a sermon to that family

[57:36] house of the Lord amen
[57:40] um I want it to continue where we were
[57:45] last week and I want to just kind of uh
[57:48] start by making a a statement here one
[57:51] of the things that the Lord kind of put
[57:54] in my spirit uh uh for this year was to
[57:59] to be practical amen last week we kind
[58:02] of started that a man uh last year I
[58:05] should say especially coming through the
[58:06] book of Ephesians uh practical teaching
[58:09] practical teaching uh very very
[58:12] important you know
[58:14] um like you know like I told you all
[58:17] um I I have to teach on Wednesday
[58:19] mornings and even I talk this morning
[58:21] going through the Book of Revelations
[58:23] and we get into some really deep things
[58:25] you know when it comes to that and and
[58:27] I'm grateful that we get a chance to do
[58:30] that and I've taken this church through
[58:32] the Book of Revelations I've taken you
[58:34] know through the church ages and just a
[58:36] number of things that we've looked into
[58:38] but uh but what the Lord has been rest
[58:41] of my spirit is practical things and I
[58:43] think our brother Stephen came on
[58:45] Wednesday night and he said we need to
[58:47] get back to the basics
[58:51] say brother ain't nothing but the truth
[58:53] because you know you can preach up here
[58:54] and people living here
[58:58] amen all right and and we don't want
[59:01] this just for head knowledge we want
[59:04] this to produce change in our life right
[59:07] it has to have an impact in our life if
[59:10] it's not having an impact in our life uh
[59:13] what good is to have it in your head
[59:16] hello somebody you know what good is for
[59:19] you to read the Bible but not follow the
[59:21] Bible
[59:22] amen and there's many people that I read
[59:25] the Bible but are you following the
[59:27] Bible are you living the Bible right
[59:30] because evidently I can tell you you
[59:32] read it but you read right over the top
[59:33] of some of these things you need to go
[59:35] back and read it again and now let it
[59:38] get deposited into your spirit to you
[59:40] and the word become one
[59:42] amen all right and you know last week I
[59:45] brought to you all just a few things and
[59:47] and I mentioned in the sermon it was
[59:49] something that I wanted to uh Circle
[59:50] back around and do and I'm going to do
[59:53] that today it's going to be very very
[59:54] practical uh so you know I trust that
[59:57] you'll get something out of it and uh
[59:59] and we'll just get started in a channel
[1:00:01] then I'm gonna kind of change a little
[1:00:02] gear but I'm just gonna talk to y'all
[1:00:05] this morning if that's all right
[1:00:06] amen I'ma just talk like a pastor
[1:00:11] I'm not an evangelist I'm a pastor so
[1:00:13] I'm gonna talk like a pastor I mentioned
[1:00:15] last week the church is cooling off
[1:00:18] I read you a quote on that the church is
[1:00:20] cooling off and and when we use the term
[1:00:23] cooling off I want to uh just just uh go
[1:00:26] a little deeper in that the things that
[1:00:29] used to bring conviction
[1:00:31] are now becoming acceptable
[1:00:35] the things that used to bring conviction
[1:00:38] are now becoming acceptable and I want
[1:00:42] to just make mention it might be
[1:00:44] acceptable to society and in some
[1:00:47] instances it might be acceptable to you
[1:00:50] but it's still not acceptable to God
[1:00:53] praise the Lord amen we know that there
[1:00:57] are two wheels we talked about that last
[1:00:59] last week There's a permissive will of
[1:01:01] God and there's a perfect will of God
[1:01:04] and and our objective is not to dwell or
[1:01:08] not to live in the permissive will of
[1:01:11] God our objective in life is to live in
[1:01:14] the perfect will of God Amen he put you
[1:01:17] on the earth with a purpose
[1:01:20] amen praise God if you didn't have
[1:01:23] purpose you wouldn't be here amen but
[1:01:25] God put you here on this Earth because
[1:01:27] he has a he has a purpose and he wants
[1:01:29] you to walk in that perfect Divine
[1:01:31] Purpose that he has for you and we
[1:01:33] talked about this
[1:01:35] um uh uh yielding you know we're talking
[1:01:37] about yielding to the perfect will of
[1:01:39] God this is part two to that and uh
[1:01:41] yielding requires Letting Go amen and
[1:01:46] allowing your heavenly father to to put
[1:01:50] you where he wants you to be
[1:01:53] um it allows you to yield and allow I
[1:01:56] mean allowing him to put you into amen
[1:01:59] into the position that he wants you to
[1:02:02] be in this is what he had in his mind
[1:02:04] for you at the beginning amen before the
[1:02:07] before the beginning of the world before
[1:02:08] the foundation he had certain things in
[1:02:10] his mind certain qualities that he
[1:02:12] placed in you and you got to be able to
[1:02:13] yield to his perfect will so those
[1:02:15] qualities can be expressed
[1:02:17] oh hallelujah amen uh and and I want to
[1:02:22] also just reiterate this you know I was
[1:02:25] I was uh talking to somebody on

[1:06:30] it says there's no matter how saintly
[1:06:32] you are
[1:06:33] how Godly you are
[1:06:36] how much of a minister or lay member
[1:06:38] whatever you are
[1:06:40] he says you'll never be able to get
[1:06:42] anywhere with God till you get in the
[1:06:45] spirit
[1:06:47] you'll never be able to get anywhere
[1:06:49] with God until you get in the spirit say

[1:07:15] brother brother Billy Parker see things
[1:07:19] and he could have fellowship with his
[1:07:21] daddy till his daddy would make a
[1:07:22] statement that his ministry can be
[1:07:23] greater than my Ministry it's because he
[1:07:25] could see things Oh Glory to God the

[1:07:49] think you're going to be able to see
[1:07:50] some of the things that he's talking
[1:07:51] about he says and I believe my brother
[1:07:54] sister I say this with Godly respect and

[1:08:00] America's sunk it says she's demoralized
[1:08:03] she's gone low to stooping it's a Pity
[1:08:06] it goes forward he says just think here
[1:08:09] as I say in answering this scripture
[1:08:12] seven women

[1:08:17] Bible in the first four first world war

[1:10:20] we in the spirit of the coming of the
[1:10:22] Lord are we getting ready are we getting
[1:10:24] closer to God or further from God

[1:13:24] down in California I went through the
[1:13:27] streets this is 1954 he's saying this I
[1:13:30] went through the streets in a place
[1:13:32] where the policeman would tell you to
[1:13:34] keep off the street police been telling
[1:13:37] the prophet
[1:13:39] don't walk the street
[1:13:41] keep up the street there's more danger
[1:13:43] for a man
[1:13:46] to pass through the street then it would
[1:13:48] be a woman this is in California in
[1:13:50] 1954. now that is Sodom conditions
[1:13:55] if it's there it's dangerous for a man
[1:13:58] to walk the street more dangerous for a
[1:14:00] man to go through the street than it is
[1:14:02] for a woman
[1:14:04] think about it he said there's there's
[1:14:06] more danger for a man to pass through
[1:14:07] the street than it would be a woman dark
[1:14:09] Alice oh God have mercy don't you know
[1:14:12] the Bible said those things would come
[1:14:14] he says and just before you give the
[1:14:17] shadow of an in Sodom Gomorrah went down
[1:14:20] there the same thing took place uh
[1:14:22] taking place rather than God sent fire
[1:14:24] down and burnt the place up a very
[1:14:26] signpost to show that the world over
[1:14:28] when it comes to that place will receive
[1:14:30] the things so you know they're gonna
[1:14:32] they got destruction in the days of
[1:14:35] Sodom and Gomorrah destruction will be
[1:14:37] coming again amen it's gonna be uh this
[1:14:40] this world going to be baptized on fire
[1:14:43] amen listen here uh we asked you to just
[1:14:47] stop for a moment last week and just ask
[1:14:50] God lord show me something I can lay
[1:14:51] aside this year that would allow me to
[1:14:54] draw closer
[1:14:55] to you and I want to encourage you to
[1:14:58] continue to do that I mentioned
[1:15:00] something on last last week about you
[1:15:02] know um I was reading an article
[1:15:04] recently and uh in this article it
[1:15:07] talked about 10 online sins that we are
[1:15:10] apparently okay with and this was
[1:15:12] written by a man by the name of Aaron
[1:15:14] Berry and um and I was just uh you know
[1:15:18] as I was reading it I said you know wait
[1:15:19] a minute let me just kind of you know
[1:15:21] look at what this guy's saying here and
[1:15:23] uh you know I'm gonna read to you all
[1:15:25] some of the things he said and I was I'm
[1:15:27] not gonna rush through this I'm gonna
[1:15:28] just say some of the things that he said
[1:15:30] and then we're going to bring some
[1:15:31] scriptures so y'all get your Bible where
[1:15:33] we gonna read a lot today we're gonna
[1:15:34] read a lot a lot amen this is just
[1:15:37] practical teaching I know you you know
[1:15:39] maybe you picked up your Bob maybe you
[1:15:41] forgot the Bible said that
[1:15:44] so we're gonna remind you what the Bible
[1:15:46] say
[1:15:47] we Christians right
[1:15:49] we follow the Bible right
[1:15:51] hello somebody
[1:15:53] the way the reason I dress the way I
[1:15:55] dress because it's in the Bible
[1:15:57] the reason I look the way I look is
[1:15:59] because it's in the Bible and I'm we're
[1:16:01] not a church that that look at the Old
[1:16:04] Testament say it's just law so we don't
[1:16:06] follow no more so okay it was just long
[1:16:07] so that means people should you know not
[1:16:10] follow the ten commandments
[1:16:12] what was that was that the words that
[1:16:15] God gave to Israel in the form of the
[1:16:16] Ten Commandments was that a good word
[1:16:18] for every age
[1:16:21] thou should not kill is that good enough
[1:16:23] for every age thou said not steal thou
[1:16:27] should not commit adultery
[1:16:29] are those words good enough for every
[1:16:31] generation anytime somebody comes to her
[1:16:34] is that a good enough word to live by
[1:16:37] so we can't pick and choose what
[1:16:39] scriptures we're going to follow and
[1:16:40] which ones we're not going to follow
[1:16:41] from Genesis to revelation we believe it
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:47] not just believe it I'm trying to live
[1:16:49] it
[1:16:51] from Genesis Genesis 1 to revelation 22
[1:16:54] I'm trying to live it
[1:16:57] all right
[1:16:58] this man says these 10 online sins that
[1:17:01] we are apparently okay with
[1:17:03] and the first one that he put online and
[1:17:07] when we talk about you know maybe
[1:17:08] there's something that you can give up
[1:17:10] I'm just suggesting I told you it's not
[1:17:13] a sin but it could be a weight yeah
[1:17:16] suggestions watch this
[1:17:18] Indulgence
[1:17:24] and he made a statement he said should
[1:17:26] we really be bragging about how much we
[1:17:28] binge on Netflix
[1:17:31] it says if we didn't have the
[1:17:33] reassurance that literally everybody
[1:17:34] else does it we probably would be
[1:17:37] ashamed to admit it
[1:17:39] so we might as well say I have no
[1:17:42] self-control and my priorities are way
[1:17:45] out of whack
[1:17:50] when you indulging
[1:17:52] right and there's a there's a there's a
[1:17:55] um
[1:17:56] uh a scripture here a man uh second

[1:18:02] Steve walked right in and read this on
[1:18:04] Wednesday night so I'll pick it up again
[1:18:06] and and we'll just continue to Second
[1:18:09] Peter one we'll talk about Indulgence
[1:18:11] hallelujah what does the bible tell us
[1:18:13] about these things second Peter 1 verse
[1:18:15] 4 it says whereby are given unto us
[1:18:19] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:18:22] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:18:27] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:18:30] corruption that is in the world through
[1:18:31] lust
[1:18:32] listen and beside this giving all
[1:18:36] diligence add to your faith uh virtue
[1:18:40] and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:18:43] Temperance amen see when you when you
[1:18:46] got Temperance that means you got
[1:18:48] self-control you don't indulge
[1:18:51] hello somebody amen this is if we talk
[1:18:54] about the character of Christ be
[1:18:56] informed Dennis Right add to your
[1:18:58] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[1:19:01] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:19:04] to Godless brother countenance and
[1:19:06] brother count as Charity for if these
[1:19:09] things be in you glory to God and not
[1:19:12] just for one day not just for one post
[1:19:15] glory to God Amen be in you and abound
[1:19:18] they make you that you should neither be
[1:19:21] Barren nor unfruitful Amen in the
[1:19:24] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:27] I've just listened to something this
[1:19:29] week and you know I ain't even I didn't
[1:19:30] catch this till now but a brother was
[1:19:32] teaching on the line he says you know
[1:19:35] um when we when we get the spirit of God
[1:19:37] in us it makes us neither Barren nor
[1:19:39] unfruitful he says now notice that um in
[1:19:43] the in in the beginning there was two
[1:19:45] trees a tree of knowledge good and evil
[1:19:47] amen and also this tree of life and and
[1:19:49] Eve decided to eat from the Tree of
[1:19:51] knowledge good and evil amen and and
[1:19:54] spiritually spiritually she became
[1:19:57] barren
[1:19:59] but when we take on the character of
[1:20:01] Christ no longer are we Barren and
[1:20:03] unfruitful amen now we can we can yield
[1:20:05] fruit to to to his service but it's only
[1:20:09] when we take on the character of Christ
[1:20:12] hello somebody for if these things be in
[1:20:15] you and abound they make you that you
[1:20:18] should neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:20:20] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:22] Christ but he that lack of these things
[1:20:24] is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:20:28] can I just tell you right now sometimes
[1:20:30] you know when we can go back and look at
[1:20:33] lot he made a decision
[1:20:34] that I'm going to go down here and start
[1:20:36] them
[1:20:37] he couldn't see it far off he didn't
[1:20:40] realize later on Sodom was going to be
[1:20:43] destroyed
[1:20:45] hello but he that lack of these things
[1:20:47] is blind and cannot see it far off and
[1:20:49] have forgotten that he was purged
[1:20:51] from his old sins
[1:20:54] I love that when we talked about
[1:20:55] Temperance and you know again this guy's
[1:20:57] talking about Indulgence uh the opposite
[1:21:00] is to be temperate right uh uh and and
[1:21:03] brother Brandon when he talks about
[1:21:05] Temperance and the statue of a perfect
[1:21:06] man we just read the scripture that he
[1:21:08] preached from he said this about
[1:21:10] Temperance says Crown my soul
[1:21:13] with self-control
[1:21:15] I wanna I wanna I wanna encourage you
[1:21:17] let God Crown your soul with
[1:21:18] self-control even as you're going
[1:21:21] through a man's social media here's
[1:21:23] another one that the guy said amen that
[1:21:26] is a sin that he just saw their
[1:21:28] materialism
[1:21:31] and he says the more attention you give
[1:21:34] to materialism the less attention you
[1:21:37] give to Eternity
[1:21:39] can I say that again the more attention
[1:21:41] you give to materialism the less
[1:21:44] attention you give to Eternity sometimes
[1:21:46] you can tell whether you're involved in
[1:21:47] materialism is a Amazon box

[1:22:20] I'ma still say it anyway
[1:22:23] Matthew 6 19 and 20.
[1:22:27] let's look at what the Bible says
[1:22:29] Matthew 6 19 and 20.
[1:22:31] hello somebody
[1:22:33] Jesus says lay not up for yourselves
[1:22:38] Treasures upon Earth
[1:22:41] where moth and Russ Dove corrupt you

[1:22:48] put that stuff
[1:22:53] lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon
[1:22:56] Earth hello somebody Y'all Gonna Make me
[1:22:58] talk to y'all today and some are so so
[1:23:01] so uh uh so stuck up we won't even wear
[1:23:05] one outfit twice
[1:23:12] come on somebody
[1:23:14] I mean we we got to have something fresh
[1:23:16] something new you know you can't even
[1:23:18] wear the same outfit twice
[1:23:20] something wrong with you
[1:23:22] hello somebody
[1:23:25] amen materialism that's what that is
[1:23:27] that's a spirit on you
[1:23:30] amen glory to God
[1:23:32] Hallelujah I mean you're gonna wear it
[1:23:34] once and do what with it
[1:23:37] no no no no no no no no I mean look I
[1:23:39] got shoes like brother brother Troy told
[1:23:41] her brother he said he said they have
[1:23:43] shoes
[1:23:45] um that's been on my feet longer longer
[1:23:47] than you've been born
[1:23:52] I like that lay not up for yourselves
[1:23:54] Treasures upon Earth where moth and Russ
[1:23:57] doth corrupt and where thieves break
[1:23:59] through and steal
[1:24:01] but lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[1:24:02] Heaven where neither moth nor rust of
[1:24:06] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[1:24:08] through or steal and I just thought
[1:24:09] about you know you see all the stuff
[1:24:11] Amazon packages getting picked up
[1:24:14] taking off people's front door taken
[1:24:15] from I mean you but but see our
[1:24:17] Treasures in that and we get upset when
[1:24:20] somebody take it away I I I remember a
[1:24:22] time brother Branham lost a suitcase had
[1:24:25] all his belongings in the suitcase and
[1:24:27] um and he was going through a
[1:24:28] neighborhood somehow they left the
[1:24:30] suitcase on top of the car and uh and it
[1:24:32] fell off and and as they were going
[1:24:34] through and they got to somewhere it's
[1:24:36] like oh I realized I ain't got my
[1:24:37] suitcase he said and that the brother
[1:24:39] say brother that that neighborhood that
[1:24:40] we drove through I can almost guarantee
[1:24:42] you ain't gonna get your suitcase back
[1:24:44] brother random say you know it's okay
[1:24:45] maybe they need it more than I need it I
[1:24:48] wonder if y'all could say that by some
[1:24:49] of y'all Amazon packages maybe they
[1:24:52] needed it more than I needed
[1:24:55] come on
[1:24:59] come on
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:06] I wonder if we can have that type of
[1:25:08] attitude maybe they needed it more than
[1:25:10] I need it so let them have it but we
[1:25:13] just get fire upset checking out
[1:25:15] checking our rings and and everything
[1:25:17] like who who took it I'm going to get
[1:25:19] them get my package
[1:25:23] see if you didn't have that many
[1:25:25] packages coming they wouldn't know you
[1:25:26] was
[1:25:29] caught up in all that
[1:25:33] see they can't break through and still
[1:25:35] if you got Treasures in Heaven
[1:25:37] but the things that we're doing here on
[1:25:39] the earth is only here for the Earth all
[1:25:42] the stuff we get involved with here on
[1:25:43] Earth is only for the Earth but what
[1:25:45] we're trying to do is get you connected
[1:25:46] to something that's eternal
[1:25:49] can I keep going
[1:25:50] the third one is pride
[1:25:53] a sin that's committed on social media
[1:25:55] has just become acceptable Pride this is
[1:25:58] what the guy said he said social media
[1:26:01] is a great place
[1:26:02] to subtly brag about your
[1:26:04] accomplishments
[1:26:07] recently you know we we had a couple
[1:26:09] opportunities we and and when I read
[1:26:12] this it just really got me thinking like
[1:26:13] oh Lord I don't want to be bragging you
[1:26:15] know I I want to show people what's
[1:26:17] going on but I don't want to be bragging
[1:26:18] well we had we did the uh the the the
[1:26:20] giveaway for Thanksgiving
[1:26:23] and uh when we did that giveaway for
[1:26:25] Thanksgiving we posted on social media
[1:26:27] account and somebody from the Palm Beach
[1:26:28] Post sent us a message and say send us
[1:26:31] this video to the Palm Beach Post we
[1:26:33] want to promote you
[1:26:35] now you know what I said no that's not
[1:26:37] why we're doing it
[1:26:39] right that's not what we're doing it we
[1:26:40] don't we don't want the Palm Beach Post
[1:26:42] promoting us
[1:26:43] so they they follow they troll us they
[1:26:45] follow us so we put another thing out
[1:26:47] there uh you know that one with the
[1:26:49] turkey then the next one was when we did
[1:26:51] the Christmas cards we just put just two
[1:26:54] or three pictures they sent us another
[1:26:55] uh send us this to this this uh forward
[1:26:58] to this uh this account and we'll post
[1:27:00] it for you that's not why we are doing
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:05] that's not why we're doing so I ain't
[1:27:07] said nothing to nobody
[1:27:09] praise the Lord
[1:27:11] social media is a great place to subtly
[1:27:14] brag about your accomplishments
[1:27:16] when you post something online ask
[1:27:18] yourself if you're being if you're
[1:27:20] bringing unnecessary attention to
[1:27:22] yourself
[1:27:24] or if you're hoping to elicit comments
[1:27:26] that feed your ego
[1:27:30] this what this what this guy's saying
[1:27:32] hello somebody right he says uh to God
[1:27:35] pride is one of the ugliest sins because
[1:27:38] it seeks to receive the glory that he
[1:27:41] alone deserves amen social media
[1:27:45] provides you with an exciting
[1:27:46] opportunity to spread God's Fame to a
[1:27:48] huge audience don't try to steal the
[1:27:51] spotlight
[1:27:56] Proverbs 16 18.
[1:28:00] let's just see if these things in the
[1:28:01] Bible
[1:28:03] what'd that say
[1:28:05] Pride God Before Destruction
[1:28:09] and look at this in our heart is spirit
[1:28:12] before fall you know what our Holy
[1:28:14] Spirit does when a sermon like this come
[1:28:16] out you get a holy spirit he can't tell
[1:28:18] me huh yeah all right
[1:28:20] okay all right you go on with your Holy
[1:28:22] Spirit
[1:28:23] get and get ready for your fall
[1:28:31] number four
[1:28:33] slander
[1:28:36] a sand on social media that just becomes
[1:28:38] so acceptable this this fella says the
[1:28:42] greatest revealer of our hearts
[1:28:44] are the words we say
[1:28:48] and that includes the ones we type
[1:28:53] if we only knew the pain that one
[1:28:56] slander's work can cause if we only knew
[1:28:58] what trials people are already facing
[1:29:00] before we start verbally tearing them
[1:29:02] down
[1:29:03] we would think twice about spewing Venom
[1:29:06] online
[1:29:08] he says this use your words to heal and
[1:29:12] to strengthen
[1:29:15] not to test somebody down use your words
[1:29:18] to heal
[1:29:19] and to strengthen
[1:29:21] can we just read a few scriptures on
[1:29:23] slander
[1:29:24] Matthew 12 36.
[1:29:27] Matthew 12 36 you got to watch what you
[1:29:29] say what you post just because everybody
[1:29:31] else posted don't mean you can
[1:29:34] Matthew 12 36 but I say unto you that
[1:29:38] Every Idle word that men shall speak
[1:29:40] they shall give account thereof in the
[1:29:43] day of judgment
[1:29:46] Psalms 101 and 5.
[1:29:51] who so
[1:29:53] privily
[1:29:54] slanderth his neighbor
[1:29:58] him will I cut off
[1:30:00] him that hath in the high look and a
[1:30:03] proud heart
[1:30:05] will not I suffer
[1:30:07] God don't want to have nothing to do
[1:30:09] with you
[1:30:12] James 4 11.
[1:30:14] you're talking about slender here it is
[1:30:17] speak not evil one of another
[1:30:24] and I like what he said this
[1:30:26] speaking of either one of another look
[1:30:27] at the comma
[1:30:29] brethren
[1:30:31] anybody in the church
[1:30:34] you should not be online trying to tear
[1:30:38] down a brother or sister in Christ
[1:30:42] speak not evil one of another
[1:30:45] brethren
[1:30:47] he that speaketh evil of his brother and
[1:30:49] judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the
[1:30:52] law and judges the law but if thou judge
[1:30:54] the law Thou Art not adore the law
[1:30:57] but a judge
[1:30:59] land is something that we want to avoid
[1:31:01] and see I'm gonna tell you something you
[1:31:04] know as we as we yield into the the
[1:31:05] perfect will of God we might have to
[1:31:07] pull back from some of this stuff
[1:31:10] maybe you following too many people
[1:31:13] yeah
[1:31:13] folk that influence you with to do the
[1:31:16] wrong things maybe you need to unfollow
[1:31:18] them
[1:31:20] and then they're going to get on you
[1:31:22] know they're gonna call you a DM you uh
[1:31:24] why you don't follow me because I wanted
[1:31:27] to
[1:31:29] I wanted to and you know what people
[1:31:31] actually get
[1:31:32] anxiety
[1:31:34] they get they get you know who who they
[1:31:36] want to know who following and who why
[1:31:38] did they stop following why they not
[1:31:39] we're not supposed to live like that
[1:31:44] hello somebody
[1:31:45] I got another one number five
[1:31:49] online
[1:31:51] quarreling
[1:31:55] quarreling
[1:31:59] this is what this fella says Aaron says
[1:32:01] this winning an online argument
[1:32:06] might make you feel wise
[1:32:08] but the Bible says you might be
[1:32:10] broadcasting your own foolishness
[1:32:15] and this is this is this ain't none of
[1:32:17] the truth but when this fella said this
[1:32:18] I I had to agree with him and uh you
[1:32:21] know I I have seen where people
[1:32:24] intentionally
[1:32:25] put certain posts out in order to
[1:32:29] generate an argument
[1:32:32] and they love arguing and sometimes I be
[1:32:35] right with that phone in my hand and my
[1:32:38] finger bee
[1:32:40] and then I say
[1:32:48] and I'm gonna tell you where the Spirit
[1:32:49] came from when I read it if I would have
[1:32:53] never read it I would have never thought
[1:32:54] nothing about it
[1:32:57] but just by reading it an anointing
[1:33:00] comes on me and I and I just I got to
[1:33:03] say something
[1:33:08] and God don't want us acting like that
[1:33:11] especially with our own brothers and
[1:33:13] sisters
[1:33:15] you know if they if they bring it to you
[1:33:18] then what I mean by bringing to you like
[1:33:19] at your house or something you got a
[1:33:21] right to say something
[1:33:22] but you know if even somebody put
[1:33:24] something on your page well you
[1:33:26] shouldn't have put it on my page you
[1:33:27] shouldn't have put it you know you still
[1:33:29] have a the ability if it's on your page
[1:33:33] you can delete it
[1:33:36] you ain't got to respond to it
[1:33:39] but I know there are certain people that
[1:33:41] they all they want to do is quarrel and
[1:33:44] they intentionally put things out there
[1:33:45] to see how people are going to go back
[1:33:47] and forth on it
[1:33:49] y'all know it's the truth
[1:33:50] and what it is it's a trap that they
[1:33:53] setting for you
[1:33:54] I've seen it happen to a brother
[1:33:56] recently I you know looked at looking at
[1:33:58] all the comments and and this fella um
[1:34:01] he put something out knew it was going
[1:34:02] to create a little a little controversy
[1:34:04] and then one guy came fine back at him
[1:34:07] firing back and then he's fired back at
[1:34:10] the guy and they just going back and
[1:34:11] forth quarreling quarreling you know
[1:34:13] just going back and next thing you know
[1:34:15] before he knew it he done what he was
[1:34:17] arguing
[1:34:18] was gone and he was saying exactly what
[1:34:20] that guy was saying
[1:34:23] that guy has weakened him in the
[1:34:25] argument see the word of God not
[1:34:27] supposed to be argued over
[1:34:29] the word of God just supposed to be live
[1:34:31] if you don't see it you just can't see
[1:34:33] it
[1:34:34] but I'm not going to sit and argue with
[1:34:36] you about this
[1:34:37] amen only God can give you this the the
[1:34:40] the the the the ability to see and then
[1:34:43] he tell didn't he tell uh Peter say
[1:34:45] flesh and blood
[1:34:47] have not revealed these things unto you
[1:34:50] but my Father in Heaven has so God got
[1:34:52] to be one to give Revelation I'm not
[1:34:54] going to go back and forth with you on
[1:34:55] social media about that quarreling
[1:34:58] is of the devil
[1:35:03] he says this do you know what takes far
[1:35:06] greater wisdom
[1:35:08] walking from a fight without saying a
[1:35:11] word
[1:35:12] it says most online debates are
[1:35:15] pointless because all the wise voices
[1:35:18] are the ones refraining from getting
[1:35:21] involved
[1:35:25] when you hoping that somebody say
[1:35:27] something about the wise people
[1:35:29] they don't even say nothing
[1:35:33] it's okay I'm gonna just put it in
[1:35:34] layman's terms it's just fools going
[1:35:37] back and forth
[1:35:42] yeah I said brother Jack Don't Call Him
[1:35:45] a fool I'ma call them what the Bible say
[1:35:46] look at this in Proverbs 20 and 3.
[1:35:49] Proverbs 20 and 3. I'm just read what
[1:35:52] the Bible
[1:35:54] it is an honor
[1:35:57] for a man
[1:36:00] to cease
[1:36:02] from strife
[1:36:04] but every fool
[1:36:07] will be medley
[1:36:10] fools metal
[1:36:12] wise people take the honorable way and
[1:36:15] don't say nothing
[1:36:19] but I'm gonna tell you after you read it
[1:36:21] it's still getting your spirit that you
[1:36:22] might not say nothing online but you're
[1:36:24] going to say something to everybody
[1:36:25] around you I was reading this and
[1:36:27] obviously if you weren't reading it
[1:36:29] if you weren't reading it you wouldn't
[1:36:31] have to meddle right
[1:36:33] come on brother
[1:36:35] Titus three and two we talk about

[1:47:08] now it's Janice and Jammers with stood
[1:47:10] Moses so these also resist the truth men
[1:47:12] of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning
[1:47:14] the faith but they should proceed no
[1:47:16] further for their father shall be made
[1:47:17] manifesting to all men as theirs also
[1:47:20] was let me read a quote uh with this one
[1:47:23] here I want to read from questions and
[1:47:25] answers on Genesis
[1:47:27] amen this is this Vanity Vanity we got
[1:47:31] to fight this one look at what the
[1:47:32] prophet says here it says now the first
[1:47:34] man now he made the first man in His
[1:47:37] image and we are returning back to that
[1:47:39] image I like that statement we are
[1:47:40] returning back to the image of the first
[1:47:43] man so that's right to our first created
[1:47:46] image we're returning back he says when
[1:47:48] God created me William Branham I was
[1:47:51] before the foundational world he made my
[1:47:53] being my spirit I wasn't conscious of
[1:47:55] anything as far as I know of but I was
[1:47:57] there he says oh I don't believe you're
[1:47:59] getting it but now just just a minute
[1:48:01] Jesus told the disciples that he knew
[1:48:03] them before the foundation world and
[1:48:05] Paul said here that he chose us in him
[1:48:07] before the world began now there was
[1:48:09] some part of me Orman Neville and the
[1:48:12] rest of you all here that's in Christ
[1:48:14] Jesus before the world ever began he
[1:48:17] says and here's to my analysis of that I
[1:48:20] think that the people today that are
[1:48:21] possessed with this Spirit or the spirit
[1:48:24] a part of these Angelic beings spirits
[1:48:27] which rotated off of God that never fell
[1:48:30] in the beginning and resisted the
[1:48:32] devil's lie in heaven it says and
[1:48:36] two-thirds of the earth is in sin and
[1:48:39] more than that which two-thirds of the
[1:48:40] Angels was kicked out and those demon
[1:48:43] spirits come into the people and
[1:48:46] habitate their body see what I mean
[1:48:49] they're demons that they once they were
[1:48:52] they was once existed and they come into
[1:48:55] the people and give them a nature Jesus
[1:48:57] cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene
[1:49:01] Pride
[1:49:03] boast
[1:49:04] big people you see unclean
[1:49:07] filthy vulgarity emulations Strife all
[1:49:13] these things see it says there were
[1:49:15] spirits that was made up back there when
[1:49:17] God began to make man off of off of
[1:49:20] there in his own image created those
[1:49:21] supernatural beings those Spirits so
[1:49:24] that's why I was telling young people
[1:49:25] you don't follow the influence of a
[1:49:27] demon
[1:49:28] even in the music that people choose to
[1:49:31] listen to they're influenced by demons
[1:49:34] can I go a little further some of the
[1:49:36] Christian music
[1:49:38] that we listen to influenced by demons
[1:49:40] demons impersonating Christians
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:46] Donnie McClurkin just revealed it all
[1:49:49] yeah he he put a statement out they said
[1:49:51] they go to these these stellars and
[1:49:53] whatever the what what the one that they
[1:49:55] try to Dove Awards and all that he said
[1:49:57] they're going to get their Awards and
[1:49:58] talk about giving glory to God in the
[1:50:00] back room they drinking and smoking and
[1:50:01] cursing and everything else
[1:50:08] demons
[1:50:09] impersonating
[1:50:11] Christians
[1:50:13] we want we want Holy Ghost feels
[1:50:15] sanctified people that are yielding
[1:50:17] their gifts yielding the oil to God we
[1:50:18] want to say nay songs
[1:50:20] I'm still still pressing my battle I
[1:50:23] know I know that song is something
[1:50:25] they're not going home to drink
[1:50:31] I got three more
[1:50:33] discontentment
[1:50:36] that's saying that's online
[1:50:37] discontentment and this is what Aaron
[1:50:40] says this is no matter how good you have
[1:50:42] it
[1:50:43] it's so easy to think everyone else's
[1:50:46] life is better than yours
[1:50:48] and the internet is here to make that
[1:50:50] possible
[1:50:52] and I I want I want to just pause there
[1:50:54] sometimes you see some online somebody
[1:50:56] just got blessed with a house somebody
[1:50:57] just said oh wow that meant that many
[1:50:59] bedrooms wow you know they blessed well
[1:51:02] you know the state that they live in or
[1:51:04] the city they live in it's a lot the the
[1:51:07] the the the cost of living is a lot
[1:51:09] cheaper
[1:51:10] and let me tell you something hello my
[1:51:13] apartment is just as blessed as they as
[1:51:15] they 10 bedroom house
[1:51:20] I'm not going to be discontented and and
[1:51:23] now I start lusting after what they got
[1:51:25] now covetousness is coming out of me and
[1:51:29] I'm working I'm working like I don't
[1:51:31] know what to try to get all this what
[1:51:32] they got you you might not be able to
[1:51:34] get all that living here in Palm Beach
[1:51:36] and now the devil stop telling I got to
[1:51:38] move I got the move you ain't got to go
[1:51:40] nowhere I I I I learned this a long time
[1:51:42] ago I'ma just share this with you God
[1:51:44] told me this because I thought one time
[1:51:45] in order to be blessed I'm gonna have to
[1:51:47] leave West Palm Beach that's what I I
[1:51:49] thought I had to do it so I'm gonna have
[1:51:51] to go to here and I have to go there but
[1:51:52] everywhere I was going gonna take me
[1:51:53] further from church
[1:51:56] so then the Lord revealed to me says No
[1:51:58] you're going to be blessed in the city
[1:52:00] and you're going to be blessed in the
[1:52:02] field you're going to be blessed when
[1:52:03] you go out and when you come in I say
[1:52:05] wait a minute I'm gonna be blessed in
[1:52:07] the city I said I'm gonna take that
[1:52:08] person I'm gonna be blessed in my city
[1:52:10] where I live but I'm gonna have to wait
[1:52:13] for my blessing I ain't gonna go out
[1:52:16] there and try to keep up with the
[1:52:17] Joneses who live way out somewhere else
[1:52:20] and
[1:52:21] Podunk hoe somewhere
[1:52:25] the the price of being is different over
[1:52:27] there than it is here

[1:52:34] get my blessing I'ma stay right here in
[1:52:36] West Palm Beach and God gonna bless me
[1:52:39] but Imma wait on the Lord
[1:52:45] practical
[1:52:47] teacher
[1:52:50] no matter how good you have it it's so
[1:52:51] easy to think everybody's life is better
[1:52:53] than yours and the internet is here to
[1:52:55] make that possible for Paul contentment

[1:52:59] circumstances you may not have the
[1:53:02] perfect house
[1:53:03] perfect engagement of the perfect man
[1:53:06] but you do not have a perfect but you do
[1:53:08] have a perfect Savior and he has given
[1:53:10] all things that pertain to life and
[1:53:12] Godless and this man was saying on this

[1:59:09] need y'all to find us somebody
[1:59:12] and they only gave me a week to do it I
[1:59:14] said Lord I need the right person and
[1:59:15] God you got the sin yet and then I
[1:59:17] walked in here on Wednesday night and
[1:59:18] brother Steve said blessed is the man
[1:59:20] that walketh not in the council ungodly
[1:59:22] and then he starts he gonna bring forth
[1:59:24] his fruit in his season and then
[1:59:26] whatever he do will prosper
[1:59:31] I said Amen brother
[1:59:33] you're reading that too but it's for me
[1:59:36] that's the Lord I receive and and on
[1:59:38] Thursday I left church on Wednesday on
[1:59:39] Thursday God sent the caregiver
[1:59:42] had them trained on Friday and they
[1:59:44] ready to start tomorrow
[1:59:47] [Applause]
[1:59:50] so he's a mighty God
[1:59:52] and all you got to do is be content with
[1:59:54] what you got ta bless that
[1:59:56] [Music]
[1:59:59] but I ain't got to lower my standards to
[2:00:01] get business
[2:00:05] the above above my title
[2:00:08] and anything
[2:00:09] in this life above my my title in the
[2:00:13] organization or title and anything I'm a
[2:00:15] Christian
[2:00:17] and I want to display that to the world
[2:00:23] first John 2 verse one through seven
[2:00:26] let's read this and and I'm I'm I'm
[2:00:29] winding up I promise you I'm winding up
[2:00:33] hypocrisy is something that we want to
[2:00:35] avoid
[2:00:36] we don't need two different
[2:00:37] personalities
[2:00:38] my little children these things right
[2:00:40] unto you that you sin now and if any
[2:00:42] man's sin we have an advocate with the
[2:00:44] father Christ Jesus Christ is I mean
[2:00:46] Jesus Christ the righteous
[2:00:49] um and he is a propitiation for our sins
[2:00:52] and not for ours only but also for the
[2:00:54] sins of the whole world and hereby we do
[2:00:56] know
[2:00:57] hereby we do know that we know him and
[2:01:01] the way that we know him is that we if
[2:01:03] we keep his Commandments
[2:01:05] he that saith I know him and keepeth not
[2:01:07] his Commandments it is a liar and the
[2:01:11] truth is not in him
[2:01:13] but we but whoso keepeth his word in him
[2:01:15] verily is the love of God perfected
[2:01:17] hereby no we the we that we are in him
[2:01:21] he that saith he abideth in him ought
[2:01:24] himself also so to walk even as he what
[2:01:29] we're supposed to be like Jesus Brethren
[2:01:31] I write no new commandment unto you but
[2:01:33] an old commandment which we had from the
[2:01:35] beginning the old commandment is the
[2:01:36] word which you've heard from beginning
[2:01:38] and uh just again these scriptures are
[2:01:41] are there to reiterate we don't need to
[2:01:43] be Hypocrites let's follow Christ in
[2:01:45] everything we do I got two more this
[2:01:48] other one that the guy wrote back wrote
[2:01:50] and said was saying that somebody people
[2:01:51] just kind of accept it hatred
[2:01:55] that yeah
[2:01:57] he says if there's one Unwritten rule
[2:01:59] that I have discovered on social media
[2:02:02] is that it is completely acceptable
[2:02:04] dispute hatred toward others if they
[2:02:07] hate you first
[2:02:10] that this is completely unchristian
[2:02:13] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ called us to a
[2:02:16] radically different manner of life
[2:02:18] loving your enemies is your light
[2:02:20] shining online
[2:02:24] can I give you Matthew 5 for this
[2:02:26] Matthew 5 verse 43. look at this this is
[2:02:30] how Christians are supposed to act this
[2:02:32] is how we live
[2:02:33] ye have heard that it hath been said
[2:02:37] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[2:02:41] thine enemy I was sitting in you know uh
[2:02:44] at the barbershop and the guy was
[2:02:46] talking about the law and Jesus coming
[2:02:48] to Grace I said Jesus came to magnify
[2:02:50] the law
[2:02:51] right not get away with not not do away
[2:02:53] with law he came to magnify and you'll
[2:02:55] see right here in the scripture he
[2:02:56] magnify you heard you you heard it say
[2:02:59] it Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[2:03:01] thine enemy but I say unto you this is
[2:03:04] magnifying but I say unto you love your
[2:03:06] enemies
[2:03:12] is that in the Bible
[2:03:15] bless them
[2:03:18] that curse you have you ever just
[2:03:20] thought about you know somebody just
[2:03:22] doing something so bad and saying
[2:03:24] something online and you just write back
[2:03:25] I just so I love you God bless you I
[2:03:28] appreciate you
[2:03:30] no you ain't thought that I know you
[2:03:32] ain't thought that you thought to say
[2:03:33] other things
[2:03:35] but this is what Jesus say to say
[2:03:39] that's right bless them that curse you
[2:03:43] do good to them that hate you
[2:03:47] send them a love offering
[2:03:50] and pray for them which despitefully use
[2:03:53] you and persecute you
[2:03:59] that ye may be the children of your
[2:04:01] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[2:04:04] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[2:04:06] good and sineth rain on the just and on
[2:04:08] the unjust for if you love them which
[2:04:11] love you
[2:04:13] foreign
[2:04:14] have you
[2:04:17] do not even the publicans
[2:04:20] the same year no different
[2:04:25] and if you salute your brethren
[2:04:33] they ain't said nothing to me I ain't
[2:04:34] saying none of them I'm gonna walk right
[2:04:36] by him I ain't got nothing to say to him
[2:04:37] I ain't got nothing to say to him
[2:04:39] and I've been doing that for years
[2:04:46] ain't no different than an unbeliever
[2:04:48] okay all right
[2:04:50] if you salute your brethren only
[2:04:54] what do you more than others
[2:04:57] do not even the public and so
[2:04:59] and here's what Jesus said be ye
[2:05:03] therefore perfect
[2:05:05] even as your father which is in heaven
[2:05:09] is perfect
[2:05:11] one more
[2:05:13] one more thing that's online that's a
[2:05:15] sin that people are just accepting one
[2:05:18] of it's
[2:05:19] jealousy
[2:05:25] and he asked this question to say do you
[2:05:27] spend your leisure time watching the
[2:05:30] insta stories of people who are living
[2:05:33] your dream life
[2:05:35] you live in my dream you live my dream
[2:05:39] so you need to get out of that
[2:05:42] and be be more content with Where You
[2:05:44] Are
[2:05:49] you growing bitter
[2:05:52] because the success and prosperity of
[2:05:55] others
[2:05:57] he says beware you'll find yourself
[2:06:00] despising those who have a better life
[2:06:02] than you and you'll find yourself
[2:06:04] questioning God's goodness and all the
[2:06:07] while you will be missing the story that
[2:06:09] God is writing for you right before your
[2:06:12] eyes
[2:06:14] don't let jealousy clouds review
[2:06:17] God is writing a story just for you
[2:06:21] and I say rejoice in it yeah amen let me
[2:06:26] read you a couple scriptures here
[2:06:27] Galatians 5 21.
[2:06:31] oh my my
[2:06:33] Galatians 5 21 and I just you know I did
[2:06:37] kind of a little search and said what
[2:06:38] what scriptures in KJV will we find
[2:06:40] about jealousy and it just kind of gave
[2:06:43] me a few of them here in Galatians 5 2 1
[2:06:45] Ambience
[2:06:46] murders drunkenness
[2:06:49] revelings and such like of the witch I
[2:06:52] tell you before as I have also told you
[2:06:55] in time past that they which do such
[2:06:57] things shall not
[2:07:01] inherit the kingdom of God can I put it
[2:07:03] this way you ain't going to heaven
[2:07:06] like that
[2:07:10] James 3 16.
[2:07:14] for where envying and strife is
[2:07:18] there's confusion
[2:07:21] and every evil work
[2:07:24] another scripture that they gave
[2:07:27] for this was out of Romans 12 verse 1
[2:07:31] and 2.
[2:07:33] we end up right where we start
[2:07:36] I beseech you
[2:07:39] I'm begging with you
[2:07:41] I'm pleading with you
[2:07:44] as your pastor
[2:07:47] I beseech you therefore brethren
[2:07:52] by the mercies of God
[2:07:55] that you present your bodies
[2:08:00] a Living Sacrifice
[2:08:03] present your bodies
[2:08:05] a Living Sacrifice
[2:08:09] holy
[2:08:12] acceptable unto God not unto man but is
[2:08:15] it acceptable to God
[2:08:18] not to society is it acceptable to God
[2:08:29] I'm not asking much because Paul say
[2:08:31] this is your
[2:08:34] it's the least you can do
[2:08:38] be not conformed
[2:08:41] to this world
[2:08:44] please
[2:08:46] be transformed
[2:08:48] by the renewing of your mind
[2:08:51] that you might prove
[2:08:54] what is that good
[2:08:58] and acceptable
[2:09:01] perfect will of God
[2:09:04] good means to be upright and honorable
[2:09:06] acceptable means to be well pleasing
[2:09:08] perfect means to be full grown mature
[2:09:10] it's time for us to start maturing in
[2:09:12] God
[2:09:14] I told y'all last week and I'm gonna
[2:09:15] keep saying it as long as the Lord put
[2:09:17] it in my heart to say we are closer to
[2:09:18] the coming of the Lord than we've ever
[2:09:20] been
[2:09:21] and we need to get into the spirit of
[2:09:23] what of the coming of the lord we can
[2:09:25] see everybody else getting into the
[2:09:26] spirit of it but what about the church
[2:09:28] we can't be cool enough we got to get
[2:09:30] hotter we got to get on fire for God
[2:09:34] yield to the perfect will of God
[2:09:37] let's pray
[2:09:44] father we if
[2:09:47] a given Lord what you have wanted us to
[2:09:49] give today
[2:09:52] my prayer is that the church would
[2:09:55] respond
[2:09:57] Saints would respond Lord to what you
[2:09:59] were saying
[2:10:00] it's not the words of brother Jack
[2:10:03] the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:10:05] Christ calling for us to yield
[2:10:08] to the perfect will of God in our lives
[2:10:11] each one of us have something different
[2:10:13] that you've called us to and we have to
[2:10:15] yield to that yeah it's going to cause
[2:10:18] some
[2:10:19] death to some things separations for
[2:10:21] some things
[2:10:23] sin is pleasure voice
[2:10:25] but it's death behind all the pleasure
[2:10:28] God help us to realize that living for
[2:10:31] you is the is the greatest thing that we
[2:10:32] could ever do
[2:10:34] surrendered life to you God is the
[2:10:36] greatest thing we could ever do
[2:10:38] so I pray father you will just get the
[2:10:40] glory and the honor from
[2:10:43] Lord the words that you have spoken
[2:10:45] I mean you just continue to just show us
[2:10:47] Lord areas in our life where we can
[2:10:50] surrender
[2:10:52] things that we can yield that will allow
[2:10:54] us to draw closer and closer to you
[2:10:58] sometimes Lord you just give us simple
[2:11:00] suggestions
[2:11:02] what does this world have to
[2:11:04] offer us nothing
[2:11:07] thank God you have everything to offer
[2:11:09] us
[2:11:10] from the youngest to the oldest I pray
