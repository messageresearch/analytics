[51:58] everything and
[51:59] and some of the saints that i mentioned
[52:00] that they would love to be able to give
[52:02] towards just that and i thought it would
[52:05] be a good idea
[52:06] he's one of the ministers here in the
[52:08] church and he we
[52:10] feed from him quite often and uh so i
[52:13] just wanted to encourage you if you'd
[52:14] like to just help
[52:15] me i know he's going to be leaving in a
[52:16] couple weeks if you'd like to help him
[52:20] just take one of the envelopes that's
[52:21] there on the table and just make sure
[52:23] you
[52:23] you're right uh offering for brother
[52:25] kwaku and we'll make sure that he gets
[52:27] it
[52:27] amen but just put it on one of the
[52:29] envelopes there and just put it inside
[52:31] the box and we'll
[52:32] be sure to give it to him uh just to be
[52:34] a blessing to him
[52:36] and his family in this time of their
[52:38] loss so
[52:39] keep that in mind all right let's turn
[52:42] here to

[52:46] will start reading um
[52:49] at verse 15.

[52:57] amen verse 15 um
[53:01] says
[53:06] i'm sorry go to verse 14 i'm sorry uh

[53:11] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[53:13] the men of judea
[53:15] and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be
[53:18] this known unto you and hearken to my
[53:20] words
[53:22] for these are not drunk and as you
[53:24] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[53:26] of the day
[53:31] but this is that which was spoken by the
[53:34] prophet
[53:35] joel amen i
[53:38] just think to myself trust the lord will
[53:41] endow us and we'll have the similar
[53:42] experience
[53:44] amen here in our midst as they had on
[53:46] the day of pentecost
[53:49] this is a promise for our day verse 17
[53:52] says and it shall come to pass
[53:53] and the last days saith god i will pour
[53:56] out of my spirit upon all flesh
[53:58] your sons and your daughters shall
[54:00] prophesy and your young men shall see
[54:02] visions and your old men shall dream
[54:03] dreams
[54:04] and all my servants and on my
[54:06] handmaidens i will pour out in those
[54:09] days of my spirit
[54:10] and they shall prophesy
[54:13] and i will show wonders in heaven above
[54:15] and signs in the earth beneath blood and
[54:17] fire and vapor of
[54:19] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[54:22] darkness and the moon into blood
[54:24] before that great and notable day of the
[54:26] lord to come and it shall come to pass
[54:28] that
[54:29] whosoever shall call on that that
[54:31] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[54:32] lord shall be

[57:12] so uh we are going to continue our
[57:13] journey uh here
[57:15] in this this sixth junction we
[57:18] uh got started on that a little bit last
[57:21] week and
[57:22] and i was bringing to you all um
[57:25] you know just just uh uh
[57:28] just an understanding that the prophet
[57:31] uh
[57:31] told us that there were kind of like six
[57:34] events that he saw in scripture
[57:37] uh that he would consider junctions amen
[57:40] uh what or what we call like great
[57:43] changes that were taking place
[57:45] and um you know noah in the ark was one
[57:48] of those
[57:48] moses and the children of israel coming
[57:51] out of egypt was another
[57:52] big junction uh abraham and a lot
[57:55] the destruction of sodom gomorrah but
[57:58] got calling abraham out and
[58:00] i mean calling lot out and god changing
[58:02] the body of abraham and sarah during
[58:03] that time to receive the promised son
[58:05] that was another major junction
[58:07] elijah and the 450 prophets of baal was
[58:10] a major junction when
[58:12] jesus came to earth the very first time
[58:16] that was also a major junction which was
[58:18] the fifth
[58:19] junction and uh and then we talked uh
[58:23] started last week because he said the
[58:24] sixth junction
[58:26] was martin luther and john wesley
[58:30] now now the both of those events happen
[58:33] at separate times in
[58:36] uh church history if we can put it that
[58:40] way
[58:41] both of those events happen at separate
[58:42] times there was a time that god allowed
[58:45] martin luther to come on the earth and
[58:48] he gave him a very specific ministry of
[58:50] the just shall live by
[58:52] faith uh martin luther was completely
[58:55] uh just you know actually the man was in
[58:57] the pulpit preaching without even being
[58:59] saved
[59:00] and uh once he had a a conversion
[59:03] experience
[59:04] and god began to reveal his word to him
[59:06] uh martin luther come to the point is
[59:08] like you know what
[59:09] he was a catholic priest he was a
[59:11] catholic priest and he says you know
[59:12] what
[59:13] what what my church is doing what what
[59:16] i'm supporting here in my church is
[59:17] catholic church
[59:18] it's against the word of god right and
[59:21] martin luther
[59:22] uh began to thunder out from his pulpit
[59:25] things that he saw
[59:26] that the church was doing but the word
[59:28] said something different
[59:29] and it says you know we can't keep doing
[59:31] this something something's wrong
[59:33] uh with this picture here uh we're gonna
[59:35] be judged by what god said in his word
[59:37] not by what some priest said
[59:39] right so so martin luther got anointed
[59:41] to write
[59:42] 95 theses and after he preached it from
[59:45] his pulpit he
[59:46] stepped out went to the catholic church
[59:49] door and nailed this 95 thesis
[59:51] to the catholic church church store on
[59:53] october 31st and the 1500s and
[59:55] you know and and every time october 31st
[59:58] comes by
[59:58] a lot of people always have in mind uh
[1:00:02] halloween amen but as a believer
[1:00:05] i can't help but have in my mind what
[1:00:07] happened with martin luther
[1:00:09] glory to god i ain't gonna let the devil
[1:00:11] take that holiday
[1:00:12] amen but i i like to celebrate what god
[1:00:15] did through martin luther
[1:00:17] by by nailing that 9-5 thesis to the
[1:00:19] door what what he was doing was
[1:00:21] protesting
[1:00:22] protesting the catholic church
[1:00:25] protesting the teachings of the church
[1:00:27] protesting
[1:00:28] amen these things that uh that they they
[1:00:30] were sharing and you know and and it was
[1:00:32] against the word of god
[1:00:33] martin luther decided to protest it it
[1:00:36] took an anointing
[1:00:38] for that man to protest that you realize
[1:00:40] back in church history and i'm using a
[1:00:42] lot of that as we preach this sermon
[1:00:44] but in church history uh during that
[1:00:46] time if you were not
[1:00:48] catholic you were good as dead right if
[1:00:51] you did not agree with the catholic
[1:00:53] church you would die
[1:00:54] hallelujah we don't we don't realize
[1:00:56] what uh people had to go through for us
[1:00:58] to get to where we are today
[1:01:00] plus to be able to come into the church
[1:01:02] and even preach things like this if i
[1:01:04] if i were to preach something like this
[1:01:06] in the 1400s and 1500 i might be
[1:01:08] dead after the sermon right but but we
[1:01:12] have i mean martin luther's anointing
[1:01:14] that he was
[1:01:14] on the brought us a freedom that we're
[1:01:16] expect that we're experiencing today and
[1:01:18] we thank god for
[1:01:19] the ministry of martin luther but
[1:01:21] brother branham said it was martin
[1:01:23] luther and
[1:01:24] john wesley that was considered the
[1:01:27] sixth junction
[1:01:28] now uh the other thing i just want to
[1:01:30] say this before i get into john wesley
[1:01:32] today
[1:01:33] there was a statement that the prophet
[1:01:36] made about martin luther and um
[1:01:40] and and i just want to just touch it
[1:01:42] just a little bit
[1:01:44] uh this is out of the message that
[1:01:46] greater than solomon
[1:01:47] is here uh greater than solomon is here
[1:01:51] just a little
[1:01:52] something that he said and i didn't read
[1:01:54] this last week
[1:01:55] but uh but he made this comment he says
[1:01:57] uh luther
[1:01:58] many of you lutheran people why history
[1:02:02] claims
[1:02:03] it wasn't a mystery i have this on the
[1:02:06] front and on the back
[1:02:07] says it wasn't a mystery they said many
[1:02:09] of you luther's people while history
[1:02:11] claims it wasn't a mystery
[1:02:12] how that martin luther protested the
[1:02:16] catholic church
[1:02:17] and got by with it he says but how he
[1:02:20] could hold his head above
[1:02:22] all the fanaticism that followed the
[1:02:25] revival
[1:02:26] right so so so what we get out of this
[1:02:28] little statement here is that
[1:02:29] when martin luther was protesting the
[1:02:32] catholic church
[1:02:33] god had anointed his ministry to stand
[1:02:35] up and and
[1:02:36] and try to carry the people back to work
[1:02:38] now he couldn't take bring him back to
[1:02:40] a complete place of restoration but he
[1:02:42] was able to be used as a reformer
[1:02:45] glory to god hallelujah but but here we
[1:02:48] we we we see something here is that
[1:02:50] you know that you can take that down the
[1:02:52] big thing here in martin luther's
[1:02:54] ministry as he was protesting
[1:02:55] is that martin luther had the ability oh
[1:02:59] hallelujah to keep his head
[1:03:02] above the fanaticism now
[1:03:05] i say that and i want to draw just a
[1:03:08] little attention there
[1:03:09] because as message believers in
[1:03:13] this hour this message that
[1:03:16] we follow glory to god if you just do a
[1:03:19] google search out there you'll see all
[1:03:21] kind of fanaticism
[1:03:23] and this is why people don't want to
[1:03:25] come to the message but there's a group
[1:03:27] of people
[1:03:29] that god has placed on their earth
[1:03:32] that can keep their head hallelujah
[1:03:35] above the fanaticism
[1:03:38] brother i'm not looking at the fanatics
[1:03:40] i'm looking at the truth
[1:03:42] i'm not concerned about fanatics as soon
[1:03:44] as i hear it if somebody take off going
[1:03:47] in the direction i ain't got to follow
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:51] i don't care who they are and what they
[1:03:53] titled i ain't got the fall of
[1:03:54] fanaticism
[1:03:56] i'm gonna stay with this word
[1:03:59] hallelujah glory to god there's so much
[1:04:02] fanaticism that follows this message
[1:04:04] you know our our introduction to the
[1:04:07] message glory to god just
[1:04:08] just to jeff just for you to be sitting
[1:04:10] here the way you sitting here right now
[1:04:12] it shows that somehow somewhere down the
[1:04:15] line
[1:04:16] you overcame all the fanaticism
[1:04:20] you overcame and still overcoming
[1:04:23] because we all got introduced to
[1:04:25] fanaticism in this message
[1:04:27] people will point us in all types of
[1:04:29] directions
[1:04:30] it's the truth any high they told me the
[1:04:33] seven thunders was the seven virtues
[1:04:35] brother branham never says that but i
[1:04:38] would just follow me because that's what
[1:04:40] they were saying and when somebody would
[1:04:42] ask you a question what the thumbnails
[1:04:43] are you had no answer
[1:04:45] but all we had to do is say what the
[1:04:47] prophet said
[1:04:48] he said the seventh thunders all the
[1:04:51] revelations that's contained
[1:04:53] in the seven seals not just one seal but
[1:04:56] every seal hallelujah as the thunders
[1:05:00] were other than their voices the
[1:05:01] revelations was unfolding to us
[1:05:03] that's what the prophet told us if we
[1:05:06] had others you know said uh they had a
[1:05:08] teaching out in arizona
[1:05:10] there was a a church that had seven
[1:05:11] preachers in him they say these seven
[1:05:13] preachers are the seven thunders
[1:05:16] right you know you had some telling us
[1:05:18] that uh glory to god
[1:05:20] uh you know we pretty much that there
[1:05:23] was nothing else for us to look forward
[1:05:24] to
[1:05:25] because we had to wait for brother
[1:05:26] branham to come back we had all kind of
[1:05:29] stuff but it was fanaticism
[1:05:34] oh yeah i mean you know that there's
[1:05:36] there there's so much that that that
[1:05:38] that we had to shake ourselves from
[1:05:41] people that don't want to fellowship
[1:05:43] fanaticism
[1:05:47] i had somebody call me one time and say
[1:05:50] uh
[1:05:50] don't fellowship with them they shuck
[1:05:52] believe us
[1:05:54] you telling me believers are shocked no
[1:05:57] i'm not gonna go with that
[1:05:59] and then put my own family in there now
[1:06:00] you taking my promise from me
[1:06:05] right holler hey
[1:06:08] you got to be able to recognize i don't
[1:06:10] care who is coming from
[1:06:13] i don't care what their title is
[1:06:15] hallelujah i don't care how long they've
[1:06:17] been in ministry
[1:06:18] if they preaching fanaticism then that's
[1:06:21] exactly what it is
[1:06:25] oh glory to god there's so much more
[1:06:28] that we don't found ourselves through
[1:06:31] it's many many more i i i i i'm gonna
[1:06:34] just say this while i'm here because
[1:06:36] and and it might and if it get me in
[1:06:38] trouble that's fine i'm gonna just tell
[1:06:40] you go read the quote
[1:06:42] right but some of the fanaticism that uh
[1:06:44] a young sister could not have a necklace
[1:06:50] that was fanaticism oh y'all ain't gonna
[1:06:52] preach with me
[1:06:54] a young sister her husband had to buy it
[1:06:56] for
[1:06:57] no no wait a minute that's not what the
[1:06:59] prophet said let's look at some of these
[1:07:01] things
[1:07:01] look here here's what i say let's look
[1:07:03] at all the prophets said
[1:07:05] not just one quote don't bring that here
[1:07:09] because it puts the church in the wrong
[1:07:12] position
[1:07:15] hallelujah we we have to rise above
[1:07:19] fanaticism
[1:07:20] and the holy spirit has anointed us to
[1:07:23] keep our heads
[1:07:25] above fanaticism
[1:07:34] you couldn't celebrate christmas
[1:07:39] you couldn't even fellowship with your
[1:07:41] own family at christmas time
[1:07:43] because of fanaticism
[1:07:47] oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me
[1:07:49] somebody's done lost family members
[1:07:51] along the way
[1:07:52] they don't want nothing to do with the
[1:07:54] church
[1:07:56] come on church we had to keep our head
[1:07:59] above this fanaticism
[1:08:00] i'm not saying get lost in this stuff
[1:08:02] now there's a balance that you can find
[1:08:06] and what we had is a lot of unbalanced
[1:08:08] things that was being brought to us
[1:08:21] there's another thought out there says
[1:08:24] that if if
[1:08:25] uh uh you know brother branham said that
[1:08:27] if a man's
[1:08:28] wife uh left him then that'll take him
[1:08:31] out
[1:08:32] that'll take him out of pulpit now if
[1:08:33] you read the quote the quote actually
[1:08:35] say
[1:08:36] they'll take me out
[1:08:40] not that will take me out
[1:08:43] they'll take me out who is there
[1:08:48] now i didn't say god was taking them out
[1:08:50] it's the people that did that
[1:08:56] read the quote but see here's the thing
[1:08:58] we don't we don't hurt fanatical
[1:09:00] preachers
[1:09:04] right we don't listen to it but did not
[1:09:06] go back and see what the prophet said
[1:09:08] about it
[1:09:09] no no no i'ma just i'm gonna have to
[1:09:12] drop some bombs
[1:09:13] if y'all don't mind because i mean he
[1:09:15] said luther
[1:09:16] and wesley and if y'all did some
[1:09:18] research on wesley's
[1:09:20] life
[1:09:25] it should have took him out the pulpit
[1:09:28] based on your understanding
[1:09:31] oh glory to god
[1:09:34] if y'all just do i ain't gonna share too
[1:09:36] much but you can do the research he had
[1:09:38] marital problems
[1:09:41] wesley wife dragon dragging him
[1:09:44] across the room by his hair
[1:09:47] marital problems
[1:09:56] a messenger
[1:09:59] a star in the hand of jesus
[1:10:03] marital problems
[1:10:09] do your research all right
[1:10:13] we have to keep our head above some
[1:10:15] fanaticism it it it takes a lot to try
[1:10:17] to keep your head above
[1:10:19] and try to rightly divide the scripture
[1:10:22] right don't just lean one way or the
[1:10:24] other
[1:10:27] somebody tell me if my one of my
[1:10:29] children uh
[1:10:30] backslide in my house and not serving
[1:10:33] lord then i shouldn't preach anymore now
[1:10:35] wait a minute wait a minute
[1:10:36] there comes a certain time where they're
[1:10:38] responsible for their own sins
[1:10:42] i can't make them live i mean they can
[1:10:45] be coming here looking one way and then
[1:10:46] living some
[1:10:47] i can't make they got to stand before
[1:10:49] god for themselves
[1:10:50] i just do my part i train up a child and
[1:10:54] the way they should go
[1:10:55] when they get old they won't depart
[1:10:57] that's what god told me now i can't make
[1:10:59] them be
[1:11:00] saved they got to come to that
[1:11:02] realization
[1:11:03] that they need christ for themselves and
[1:11:06] i pray god will send trial after trial
[1:11:09] and test out that test until that child
[1:11:12] gets broken down
[1:11:14] flat on their back when they realize
[1:11:18] they need jesus
[1:11:26] glory to god amen fanaticism
[1:11:36] it's a lot of fanaticism lots lots lots
[1:11:38] lots lots less
[1:11:40] and it's most stuff that y'all probably
[1:11:41] can tell me about but we're trying to
[1:11:43] keep our head above this
[1:11:45] there there is a truth to this message
[1:11:49] there's a truth and you got to find that
[1:11:51] that that that middle line and just walk
[1:11:53] there
[1:11:54] don't worry about what this one's saying
[1:11:55] what that one's saying and that's why
[1:11:57] many people are all caught up today and
[1:11:58] that's why they're not
[1:11:59] they're not worshipping in spirit and
[1:12:01] truth the way they need to because they
[1:12:02] got caught up in fanaticism
[1:12:06] fanaticism all you need is go back and
[1:12:08] look at it for yourself
[1:12:11] hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:12:15] all right so uh i'm just uh
[1:12:18] moving you know here from luther
[1:12:22] because this this the sixth junction two
[1:12:25] great ministries that occurred was the
[1:12:27] ministry of luther
[1:12:29] and the ministry of wesley right
[1:12:32] and uh both of these uh would be
[1:12:34] considered
[1:12:35] uh uh reformers but also i don't want to
[1:12:39] minimize the fact because we off we
[1:12:43] often
[1:12:44] you know i saw we pushed as the reformer
[1:12:46] part but they saw something in the word
[1:12:49] to be able to elevate them a little
[1:12:50] higher than everybody else
[1:12:52] hallelujah right so they also were
[1:12:55] seizures
[1:12:58] they were seers because the lamb had
[1:13:00] seven eyes
[1:13:02] on the seven horns and i has to be able
[1:13:04] to see
[1:13:07] glory to god amen and i know that they
[1:13:10] walk in all the truth luther certainly
[1:13:12] been walking on the true luther
[1:13:13] still uh baptizing in in the name of
[1:13:16] father son and holy ghost he didn't have
[1:13:18] all the truth
[1:13:18] it showed that he was lacking something
[1:13:20] and by him lacking
[1:13:22] something it showed we needed more
[1:13:28] god allowed him to lack something so to
[1:13:30] show that we needed a little bit more
[1:13:33] but the restoration process from god
[1:13:35] began in luther's ministry
[1:13:38] all right let's let's stop let's start
[1:13:40] here amen if we can i i want to
[1:13:43] try to get a couple things in uh on
[1:13:45] friday night we listened to the tape
[1:13:47] uh to whom shall we go and we were
[1:13:50] blessed by
[1:13:51] you know the prophet just preaching and
[1:13:53] man the anointing
[1:13:54] uh uh glory to god i mean there's about
[1:13:57] 150 people in church in it and then folk
[1:14:00] got to praising god
[1:14:02] it felt like thousands they almost stole
[1:14:06] the service from the prophet just
[1:14:07] worshiping
[1:14:09] right just one person getting healed it
[1:14:11] just you just
[1:14:12] my just i mean what i'm sitting there in
[1:14:15] my house like man i wish i was at that
[1:14:17] service
[1:14:18] just an anointing that was there we know
[1:14:21] god was with his prophet
[1:14:22] right and uh but he he brought some
[1:14:24] truth before the anointing came
[1:14:26] and it says um there were seven reasons
[1:14:29] why we need to come to jesus
[1:14:31] seven reasons why we should come to
[1:14:33] jesus he said the first reasons because
[1:14:35] jesus is the way hallelujah
[1:14:39] the second reason jesus is the truth
[1:14:42] jesus is the light now now that this may
[1:14:46] seem
[1:14:47] simple but i want to go a little deeper
[1:14:50] if i can
[1:14:52] with some of those things jesus is the
[1:14:55] way
[1:14:56] jesus is the truth
[1:15:00] come on let me just just a little bit
[1:15:04] because you know uh oftentimes
[1:15:07] we serve god with our emotions
[1:15:13] we worship with our emotions i'm about
[1:15:15] to lose this one i don't know
[1:15:16] i feel hear something glory to god
[1:15:19] uh but but that you know i don't know
[1:15:22] why that's happening
[1:15:23] let me get you let me get another i hear
[1:15:25] a feedback or something
[1:15:27] let me just take that one out you know
[1:15:30] sometimes the devil fights you with the
[1:15:32] microphones and all kind of stuff
[1:15:35] yeah just so
[1:15:40] praise the lord all right one go down we
[1:15:43] pick up another
[1:15:45] but we serve god oftentimes from our
[1:15:47] emotions
[1:15:51] uh we will look at people who say well
[1:15:53] they read the bible
[1:15:56] uh they must love god they don't read
[1:15:58] the bible more than that and read the
[1:16:00] bible
[1:16:02] now just because they read the bible
[1:16:04] don't mean they walking in the way
[1:16:08] just because they read the bible don't
[1:16:10] mean they walk in according to truth
[1:16:14] oh hallelujah jesus is the way
[1:16:18] jesus is the truth jesus
[1:16:22] is the light you can have a bible amen
[1:16:25] under your arms and still walking in
[1:16:27] darkness
[1:16:29] reading it every day but still living in
[1:16:31] darkness
[1:16:32] you have to follow jesus who is the way
[1:16:35] the truth and the life
[1:16:37] now it's more than just coming to an
[1:16:39] altar hallelujah somebody
[1:16:42] because there's many churches today
[1:16:43] gonna have a lot of people at the altar
[1:16:45] they're gonna be recording each and
[1:16:47] every number
[1:16:48] this name got saved in that name let me
[1:16:50] tell you something
[1:16:51] when you come down and sit at an altar
[1:16:54] or kneel at an altar
[1:16:55] sit in the chair that's not the thing
[1:16:56] you got saved
[1:16:59] hallelujah amen it might been the day
[1:17:01] that you recognized that salvation was
[1:17:04] brought to you
[1:17:05] but if you were seed of god you were
[1:17:07] saved before the foundation
[1:17:09] of the world
[1:17:14] and if you're saving for the finished
[1:17:16] world then you can't be lost on this
[1:17:18] side
[1:17:19] god ain't gonna save you there and lose
[1:17:20] you here
[1:17:22] oh i love i love my lord no matter what
[1:17:25] you go through god ain't gonna save you
[1:17:26] there and lose you here
[1:17:29] now what happens is that we think that
[1:17:31] because this person do this this person
[1:17:32] do that that they
[1:17:34] they got something but if they can't
[1:17:36] walk according to the truth
[1:17:38] they're missing everything brother jack
[1:17:40] how can you say
[1:17:42] that it's uh it's more than that it's
[1:17:44] more than just you know
[1:17:45] knowing that jesus is the way jesus is
[1:17:47] the truth jesus life
[1:17:48] it's more than just worship it's worth
[1:17:49] more than just going to altar the reason
[1:17:51] i can say that because the very
[1:17:53] first two people or uh uh uh four people
[1:17:57] adam eve uh cain and abel um
[1:18:00] kane brought an offering to an altar
[1:18:03] abel brought an offering to an altar
[1:18:06] they
[1:18:07] i just want you to see them both going
[1:18:08] up to the altar
[1:18:10] see them coming down their hearts are
[1:18:12] broken
[1:18:13] crying and snotting
[1:18:17] i'm bringing my my best to god
[1:18:21] this is lord this is what i grew for you
[1:18:25] this is this is i mean i lord i saved
[1:18:28] the best
[1:18:29] i was looking at and i thought i would
[1:18:31] take that for myself say but no i'm
[1:18:32] gonna save this for god
[1:18:34] at an altar and then he here came come
[1:18:38] with us
[1:18:39] his fruits and vegetables and his
[1:18:41] brother coming with a bloody lamb
[1:18:43] and looking at his brother saying you
[1:18:45] know god ain't gonna accept nothing like
[1:18:47] that
[1:18:47] why you bring some uh some some fruit
[1:18:49] from the field look at how beautiful
[1:18:51] this
[1:18:51] is son he said watch when i get into the
[1:18:54] presence of god
[1:18:55] how he accepts my sacrifice
[1:18:59] and at the altar oh jesus it was at the
[1:19:03] altar that god actually rejected his
[1:19:06] offering
[1:19:07] and it's at the altar that a lot of
[1:19:09] people have been rejected
[1:19:10] because it's not from their hearts
[1:19:15] they refuse to walk in truth after they
[1:19:18] get up from the altar
[1:19:20] cain had the ability to walk in truth
[1:19:24] when he came to the altar god said now i
[1:19:25] don't like
[1:19:26] what you brought me but i like what your
[1:19:28] brother brought me give me give me the
[1:19:29] same thing he got
[1:19:30] now he had just finished criticizing his
[1:19:32] brother so now that's gonna make him eat
[1:19:34] his words
[1:19:36] hallelujah's somebody is he saying oh
[1:19:38] you know that's many people don't
[1:19:40] criticize you
[1:19:42] they don't criticize you and they have
[1:19:43] to eat their words and sometimes that
[1:19:45] pride
[1:19:46] is what stops them from coming through
[1:19:48] the door
[1:19:50] but god gonna find that pride and get
[1:19:52] rid of it
[1:19:54] glory to god god got a way of putting
[1:19:56] you in a spot where the only person can
[1:19:58] pray for you is a person that's a
[1:19:59] believer
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:02] your pastor can't pray for you because
[1:20:04] your pastor don't believe
[1:20:06] amen you know that church you go to them
[1:20:09] people are not believers
[1:20:10] they can't pray for when you when you
[1:20:12] hit rock bottom
[1:20:13] and you need somebody to get to god you
[1:20:16] know where to go
[1:20:19] we're going to be right here too can't
[1:20:22] say kane say uh
[1:20:24] say but you know that look at his office
[1:20:26] i'm not i don't want that
[1:20:28] i want blood kane if you give me the
[1:20:30] same thing king
[1:20:31] i mean that abel gave me i don't i i'll
[1:20:33] accept it
[1:20:34] can't say i can't i can't i can't do
[1:20:36] that i just criticized him
[1:20:38] so what does cain do he kills his
[1:20:40] brother
[1:20:41] and let me tell you something there's
[1:20:42] people trying to kill your influence
[1:20:45] they kill your character hallelujah
[1:20:48] that's what they're trying to do
[1:20:50] but when god is giving you character can
[1:20:52] no man kill it
[1:20:54] no woman can kill it when god is giving
[1:20:56] it to you
[1:20:58] and cain found himself at a spot where
[1:21:00] he could not even
[1:21:02] um obey a direct commandment from god
[1:21:07] so this is why i say look it's more than
[1:21:09] just going to the altar
[1:21:10] it's more than just reading your bible
[1:21:12] it's more than that it's being
[1:21:14] able to come in line with the truth for
[1:21:17] your day
[1:21:19] all right the prophet said seven things
[1:21:22] seven reasons why we should come to
[1:21:23] jesus
[1:21:24] jesus is the way jesus is the truth
[1:21:28] jesus is the light he also said jesus
[1:21:31] is the only safe and secure foundation
[1:21:35] and when he said that he said we i i i i
[1:21:38] remember
[1:21:38] we can't put our trust in politicians
[1:21:43] here we can't put our trust in the
[1:21:45] democratic party
[1:21:47] we can't put our trust in the republican
[1:21:49] party
[1:21:50] because the prophet said both parties
[1:21:52] are rotten
[1:21:57] brother if anybody ever gave me some
[1:21:59] fruit that was rotten
[1:22:01] i would not eat it and i ain't gonna eat
[1:22:05] no fruit from the democratic and the
[1:22:07] republican party either
[1:22:09] it's rotten to the core
[1:22:13] jesus is the only safe and secure
[1:22:15] foundation
[1:22:17] saints should not be fussing and
[1:22:19] fighting
[1:22:20] over what the democratic and republican
[1:22:22] party are doing
[1:22:23] not saints
[1:22:28] saints you need to be commenting on the
[1:22:30] internet
[1:22:31] on social media about that type of stuff
[1:22:34] it's a spirit to divide the people
[1:22:41] you want to talk in your house that's
[1:22:43] one thing but don't send that stuff
[1:22:44] out there or over the way so you can
[1:22:47] create some
[1:22:49] some some viral posts
[1:22:54] and think about what you're doing
[1:22:55] because it reflects on this church
[1:22:58] it reflects on me as your pastor
[1:23:01] think about what you're doing before you
[1:23:03] do it
[1:23:04] hallelujah glory to god the prophet said
[1:23:08] it's
[1:23:08] rotten
[1:23:11] i don't eat rotten stuff all right glory
[1:23:15] to god
[1:23:15] he said jesus is the only successful and
[1:23:19] secured happiness and peace
[1:23:22] glory he also said jesus the other
[1:23:24] reason you should come to jesus
[1:23:25] because jesus is the only lasting
[1:23:27] achievement
[1:23:29] so many things here and there there are
[1:23:31] sermons in all of this i just i can't
[1:23:33] preach it all today
[1:23:34] but i might come back and hit some of
[1:23:36] this he said and the last thing he said
[1:23:38] here
[1:23:39] jesus is the only one
[1:23:42] that can translate your body
[1:23:46] that's why you ought to come to jesus
[1:23:48] that's why you ought to serve jesus
[1:23:50] because he's the only one offering
[1:23:52] translation powers
[1:23:56] he he said your medicine can't translate
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:00] amen it says your medicine can't change
[1:24:03] you from an old person
[1:24:05] to a young person no appeal can do that
[1:24:08] no level of education can do that no
[1:24:10] career can do that
[1:24:12] no amount of money that you attain can
[1:24:15] buy you
[1:24:15] translation power
[1:24:19] that's why it's best just to serve the
[1:24:21] lord jesus because at the end you're
[1:24:23] gonna need something to translate you
[1:24:25] something that'll change your body
[1:24:30] second corinthians 5 1 says for we know
[1:24:32] that if our earthly house of this
[1:24:33] tabernacle were dissolved
[1:24:35] we have a building of god and house not
[1:24:38] made with hands
[1:24:39] eternal and the heavens we have
[1:24:41] something to translate
[1:24:42] us even when we come to death we got a
[1:24:44] promise when we're walking
[1:24:46] with the lord jesus i'll tell you
[1:24:48] there's a lot there
[1:24:49] and i just wanted to kind of drop this
[1:24:51] off because
[1:24:52] uh you know jesus being the way the
[1:24:55] truth and the life we got to be
[1:24:56] we got to be connected with him it's
[1:24:58] more than just going to the altar
[1:25:00] it's more than just reading your bible
[1:25:01] but it's being able to walk according to
[1:25:03] the truth for your day
[1:25:06] see luther had the truth for his day
[1:25:09] wesley
[1:25:09] had the truth for his day but there's
[1:25:12] another truth that's coming our day
[1:25:15] and we've got to be able to walk in that
[1:25:16] truth all right
[1:25:19] all right let's so let me uh i read this
[1:25:21] scripture i don't know
[1:25:22] i'm i'm hearing and it's just
[1:25:26] uh okay all right praise the lord i read
[1:25:29] this uh
[1:25:30] last week and i want to pick it up
[1:25:31] revelation 14
[1:25:34] uh verse 6 to 12. let's read this
[1:25:38] now uh when we when we talk about this
[1:25:40] message that we follow
[1:25:44] it's in the bible it was actually
[1:25:47] promised according to scripture
[1:25:50] right and uh so we're not we're not just
[1:25:52] kind of
[1:25:53] following something willy-nilly it's
[1:25:55] it's we gotta we gotta be able to
[1:25:58] um you know we gotta we gotta be able to
[1:26:00] see ourselves in scripture
[1:26:02] hallelujah amen here in revelation 14
[1:26:06] verse six it says and i saw another
[1:26:11] angel flying in the midst of heaven
[1:26:14] having the everlasting gospel to preach
[1:26:17] unto them that dwell in the earth
[1:26:18] and to every nation and kindred and
[1:26:20] tongue and people
[1:26:22] saying with a loud voice fear god and
[1:26:24] give glory to him
[1:26:26] for the hour of his judgment is come and
[1:26:28] worship him that made heaven and earth
[1:26:30] and the sea and the fountains of waters
[1:26:33] and
[1:26:34] there follow another angel
[1:26:37] okay there followed another angel saying
[1:26:39] babylon has fallen
[1:26:41] it's fall in that great city because she
[1:26:43] made all the nations drink of the
[1:26:45] wine of of of the wrath of her
[1:26:47] fornication
[1:26:49] and the third angel followed them saying
[1:26:51] with a loud voice
[1:26:53] if any man worship the beast and his
[1:26:55] image
[1:26:56] and receive his mark in his forehead or
[1:26:58] in his hand
[1:27:00] now let me just pause
[1:27:03] just for a second
[1:27:07] hallelujah because there's this
[1:27:10] fanaticism
[1:27:13] that we got to keep our heads above and
[1:27:16] one of the fanatical thoughts that's out
[1:27:18] there is that
[1:27:18] if you were to take the vaccine
[1:27:22] you'd be taking the mark of the beast
[1:27:24] that is fanaticism
[1:27:28] i have you to know that the bible says
[1:27:31] that if i were to drink
[1:27:32] anything badly
[1:27:35] it would not harm me
[1:27:40] this is more of the system
[1:27:43] right it's not about a vaccine the
[1:27:45] prophet prayed for vaccines
[1:27:47] now i'm not telling you to go take a
[1:27:49] vaccine
[1:27:50] but i'm telling you that if you have to
[1:27:53] it's okay
[1:27:55] if you don't want to you know what it is
[1:28:00] it's okay but it's not the mark of the
[1:28:03] beast
[1:28:04] the prophet did not say that
[1:28:08] amen let's go back to what the prophet
[1:28:11] said
[1:28:12] the prophet never said a vaccine was the
[1:28:14] mark of the beast
[1:28:16] so don't y'all get yourself caught up in
[1:28:18] this nonsense this
[1:28:20] is fanaticism that you got to keep your
[1:28:22] head above
[1:28:25] amen all right
[1:28:28] amen it shouldn't separate you if a
[1:28:31] brother say i want to take the vaccine
[1:28:33] that's
[1:28:33] i know a brother you know he he around
[1:28:35] people all the time said brother i just
[1:28:37] felt better taking
[1:28:38] ain't nothing wrong with that brother i
[1:28:39] got no problem with that
[1:28:41] he asked me had i i haven't
[1:28:44] and there shouldn't be nothing wrong
[1:28:45] with me either
[1:28:48] we should still be able to fellowship
[1:28:56] glory to god amen church
[1:28:59] it's fanaticism that we got to keep our
[1:29:01] heads above around here
[1:29:03] and i ain't gonna let the devil divide a
[1:29:05] church over a vaccine
[1:29:13] the same god that protects you with it
[1:29:15] is the same god protect you without it
[1:29:18] it's the same god so don't let that i
[1:29:20] mean it's just
[1:29:21] okay if that's what you choose to do
[1:29:23] that's fine don't even equate it to
[1:29:25] faith it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:29:27] faith
[1:29:27] it is what we call preference
[1:29:33] i i told some people say now i have to
[1:29:35] travel i've traveled overseas in the
[1:29:37] past
[1:29:38] uh the different countries in africa and
[1:29:40] i had to take a vaccine before i could
[1:29:42] go there
[1:29:44] now if they make that a requirement
[1:29:45] again you know what i'm going to do go
[1:29:47] down and get the vaccine
[1:29:49] i'm going to get it
[1:29:53] and i will not have the mark of the
[1:29:54] beast
[1:29:58] because i know that's not what the
[1:30:00] prophet taught that mark of the beast is
[1:30:02] when you when you see it in hand they
[1:30:03] say
[1:30:04] it's you working for the system
[1:30:08] right with that that mark in your head
[1:30:10] it's it's your it's
[1:30:11] not just your knowledge but it's how you
[1:30:13] think about the system
[1:30:16] you can't even see nothing outside the
[1:30:18] system all you see is what the system
[1:30:19] say
[1:30:20] my my pastors say my preachers say my my
[1:30:23] bishops say but what does the word say
[1:30:29] this person said that i ain't got
[1:30:30] nothing to do with that i'm gonna stay
[1:30:32] with what the words say
[1:30:33] you know there's another i'ma just have
[1:30:36] to say it it's coming out of my mouth
[1:30:38] like this
[1:30:38] fanatical thought there's another
[1:30:40] thought out there say we don't need
[1:30:41] preachers no more
[1:30:50] somebody get married we play a tape from
[1:30:53] the prophet
[1:30:54] no no that's fanaticism
[1:30:57] that ain't even your name on the quote
[1:31:01] that's not even your name that he's
[1:31:03] saying there
[1:31:05] that's that's what i mean i'm just
[1:31:07] trying to tell y'all this is what's out
[1:31:08] there
[1:31:09] and it takes something to keep your head
[1:31:11] above this
[1:31:16] no no i can marry them i can bury them
[1:31:21] that's that's what my job is as a pastor
[1:31:23] and you know you know brother branham
[1:31:24] never said it do any of that
[1:31:27] play this tape uh when when it's uh when
[1:31:30] so-and-so get married play this tape
[1:31:31] that ain't doing what the prophecy
[1:31:33] when somebody get they die and they you
[1:31:35] got a bear and play prophet never said
[1:31:37] nothing like that
[1:31:39] we got to live above fanaticism and
[1:31:42] still love our brothers and sisters in
[1:31:43] the in the midst of it
[1:31:47] that that don't mean go to the go to go
[1:31:49] go to social media now you see somebody
[1:31:51] believe that way now you just attack
[1:31:52] them you're fanatic
[1:31:53] that's not love that ain't christ
[1:31:57] i'm just telling you you know since this
[1:31:59] is this is
[1:32:00] just the shepherd talking to the sheep
[1:32:04] keep your head above fanaticism it's all
[1:32:06] out there but just keep your head above
[1:32:08] it
[1:32:08] all right all right let me let me i i
[1:32:11] read the scripture now let me read this
[1:32:12] quote i believe
[1:32:13] no i didn't finish reading the scripture
[1:32:15] uh verse 9 says and the third angel
[1:32:17] followed them saying with a loud voice
[1:32:20] uh if any man worship the beast and his
[1:32:23] image and receive his mark and his
[1:32:24] forehead
[1:32:26] or in his hand the same shall drink of
[1:32:29] the wine of the wrath of god which is
[1:32:31] poured out without mixture into the cup
[1:32:33] of his indignation
[1:32:35] and he shall be tormented with the fire
[1:32:37] and brimstone in the presence of the
[1:32:39] holy angels and in the presence of the
[1:32:40] lamb
[1:32:41] and the smoke of their torment ascendeth
[1:32:44] up forever and ever and they have no
[1:32:46] rest day nor night
[1:32:47] who worship the beast in his image and
[1:32:49] whosoever receiveth
[1:32:50] the mark of his name here is the
[1:32:52] patience of the saints
[1:32:54] here are they that keep the commandments
[1:32:56] of god and the faith of jesus
[1:32:59] amen uh i i want to just kind of bring
[1:33:02] this out because
[1:33:03] you know brother smiling made a comment
[1:33:05] last week when he was going to say you
[1:33:06] know we just take things for granted
[1:33:08] right and and i just read that scripture
[1:33:10] and for me i take it for granted
[1:33:12] i take it for granted i know what it
[1:33:14] means right
[1:33:15] there's a lot of churches that will
[1:33:17] avoid the book of revelation
[1:33:19] there are saints that's probably even
[1:33:20] sitting here right now listen like well
[1:33:21] brother jack you know what that mean
[1:33:22] how do you know what that mean the
[1:33:24] reason i can tell you what that means
[1:33:25] because the prophet told me what it
[1:33:26] meant
[1:33:28] glory to god and and all i do is apply
[1:33:30] what the prophet said
[1:33:32] see so so when we talk about you know
[1:33:34] just you know when i say jesus
[1:33:36] is the way there were certain things
[1:33:38] that jesus was doing
[1:33:39] at the calvary
[1:33:43] i hope we get it there were certain
[1:33:45] prophecies that were still waiting to be
[1:33:47] fulfilled
[1:33:47] after calvary and what we got to do is
[1:33:50] kind of get
[1:33:51] amen a prophetic lens and look at the
[1:33:53] scripture
[1:33:54] a little differently i mean how many out
[1:33:56] there reading a bible
[1:33:57] ask them what does this verse that i
[1:34:00] just read out of
[1:34:01] revelation 14 what does that mean all
[1:34:02] the reading of the bible they've been
[1:34:04] doing they have no clue what it means
[1:34:06] well here's the thing if they would come
[1:34:08] underneath the prophetic anointing
[1:34:10] then they would get an understanding as
[1:34:12] to what that meant it's more than just
[1:34:14] reading your bible
[1:34:15] it's more than just going to alter it's
[1:34:17] more than that can you walk in the truth
[1:34:19] for your day
[1:34:23] because that's what cain failed to do he
[1:34:25] could not walk in the truth
[1:34:27] for his day and all he had to do is one
[1:34:29] thing god only gave him one thing to do
[1:34:32] one thing give me the same offering that
[1:34:35] your brother just gave me
[1:34:36] it wasn't even a mystery
[1:34:39] amen yeah anyway he ain't have to figure
[1:34:42] out what type of animal to go get god
[1:34:44] gave him the exact thing to do
[1:34:46] but he refused to do it and this is what
[1:34:48] the problem is with people today they
[1:34:50] refuse to walk
[1:34:51] in the fullness of the truth as it has
[1:34:53] been given to them in their day
[1:34:56] and i'm going to tell you something i'm
[1:34:57] not going to serve god in my
[1:34:59] emotions i'ma just tell you like it is
[1:35:02] you got to come according to truth
[1:35:06] amen all right mark of the beast
[1:35:10] and the seal of god now uh this is a
[1:35:13] message i'm quoting from
[1:35:14] it'll be good for you to maybe go back
[1:35:15] and listen to that tape if you want to
[1:35:16] know what the mark of the beast is
[1:35:19] that way you won't be going around
[1:35:20] telling people
[1:35:26] it's the truth anyhow you won't be going
[1:35:28] around telling people oh you got
[1:35:29] you got the mark of the beast you took
[1:35:31] the vaccine that's a lie
[1:35:34] and god did not give us a spirit of fear
[1:35:39] but of love power and sound mind now
[1:35:41] let's read this quote here
[1:35:44] i'm trying to get on out of here uh
[1:35:47] he says this and and let me just also
[1:35:50] drop this coming in
[1:35:51] if it took prophets to write the word of
[1:35:55] god
[1:35:56] it'll take a prophet to interpret the
[1:35:59] word of god
[1:36:01] not a theologian not a man that got a
[1:36:03] doctorate degree
[1:36:05] a prophet interprets the word of god so
[1:36:08] even when i look at that i might i might
[1:36:10] i might have my own
[1:36:12] thoughts when i look at that scripture
[1:36:13] but a prophet tells me what it means
[1:36:15] now watch what the prophet says here it
[1:36:17] says now you see
[1:36:18] how it was represented in ezekiel the
[1:36:20] 9th chapter at jerusalem
[1:36:21] now we come to revelation and now like
[1:36:24] you
[1:36:25] that's got your pencils to write this
[1:36:27] down i'd like
[1:36:28] you to write down revelation 14 uh verse
[1:36:31] 6 to 12
[1:36:32] that's the three last angels let me just
[1:36:35] help you
[1:36:36] what do you talk about here the three
[1:36:37] last angels would be luther
[1:36:40] wesley branham now uh i i said last week
[1:36:43] that it said malachi
[1:36:44] original it says elijah right but but
[1:36:47] it's the spirit of elijah according to
[1:36:50] malachi that's been promised for this
[1:36:51] day so the last three stars the last
[1:36:54] three messengers
[1:36:55] uh a a junction that took place
[1:36:58] amen in church history happened when
[1:37:00] luther came on the scene
[1:37:02] luther wesley branham last three angels
[1:37:06] last three messengers identified in
[1:37:09] revelation
[1:37:09] 14. these last three angels three angels
[1:37:14] after the seven last angels they were
[1:37:16] three special angels come forth lotus
[1:37:18] ready to say
[1:37:19] three special ain't luther especially
[1:37:23] wesley was special william branham
[1:37:26] was special all right it says uh did you
[1:37:29] notice that and now i want you to notice
[1:37:31] them three last the first angel that's
[1:37:34] revelation 14 6-12
[1:37:35] the first angel had sounded the trumpet
[1:37:37] of the gospel and had the everlasting
[1:37:39] gospel to preach to all the world
[1:37:41] the second angel kind of preached the
[1:37:44] holiness gospel see
[1:37:45] because he said the church had committed
[1:37:47] fornication
[1:37:49] my and the third angel roared out to
[1:37:52] escape the mark of the peace
[1:37:54] watch the first angel at the reformation
[1:37:57] luther preached the gospel second angel
[1:38:01] wesley sanctification the fornication
[1:38:04] he's straightened up of the church
[1:38:08] i'm i'm gonna just have to say something
[1:38:11] to straighten up the church
[1:38:15] fornication this is this is
[1:38:18] having sexual affairs and not being
[1:38:20] married
[1:38:22] right um
[1:38:26] jesus when he came on the scene he had
[1:38:28] to deal with that problem it's a woman
[1:38:30] one time that had herself a bunch of
[1:38:32] different men
[1:38:34] and jesus sent his disciples into the
[1:38:37] into the um the market to go buy some
[1:38:40] vittles and
[1:38:41] when they come back they saw him talking
[1:38:42] to this woman at the well
[1:38:44] and it says uh you know the woman was
[1:38:47] having conversations like you know
[1:38:48] that's not good for us
[1:38:49] you know we have two different races we
[1:38:51] shouldn't be out here talking together
[1:38:52] like this
[1:38:53] he says uh she's i'm samaritan you jew
[1:38:55] and you know we shouldn't be out here
[1:38:56] saying you know we worship here and
[1:38:58] y'all worship there and y'all just say
[1:38:59] he said look uh
[1:39:00] uh woman you know just give me a drink
[1:39:03] and say actually you know if you would
[1:39:04] ask me for a drink
[1:39:05] you would never thirst again say what
[1:39:07] kind of you ain't got nothing to even
[1:39:08] draw with what you what kind of water
[1:39:09] you're giving
[1:39:10] and he started just communicating with
[1:39:11] her and next thing you know she's like
[1:39:13] oh
[1:39:14] light start coming on and she's like you
[1:39:16] know what i want some of that water sir
[1:39:17] give me some of that what you talk about
[1:39:19] you know
[1:39:19] i never thirst again he said yeah you
[1:39:21] can have something this will say but
[1:39:22] before you get it now go get your
[1:39:23] husband

[1:39:30] you told the truth you ain't got no
[1:39:31] husband that you're sleeping around
[1:39:32] without a husband
[1:39:36] and then he made another statement say
[1:39:38] the one you living with
[1:39:41] and this is where we got a problem in
[1:39:42] the church we got folk living together
[1:39:45] not married

[1:49:05] uh warning he says but the third
[1:49:08] messenger the pentecostal
[1:49:09] message should be the true messenger
[1:49:11] warning them to escape the mark of the
[1:49:13] beast saying
[1:49:14] whosoever receives the mark of the beast
[1:49:15] the same will drink the wrath of god
[1:49:17] pour a port out without mixture into the
[1:49:20] cup of indignation

[1:49:47] at this juncture in the sixth junction
[1:49:49] one of the great ministries that god
[1:49:51] used was the minister luther
[1:49:53] and the ministry of john wesley now
[1:49:56] i don't have time to go through all the
[1:49:58] history today but i'm going to just try
[1:49:59] to give you a little bit
[1:50:00] uh we know that at a junction uh god god
[1:50:04] sends
[1:50:04] angels god sends the the supernatural
[1:50:06] the miraculous
[1:50:07] comes at the junction uh when we when we
[1:50:09] started the life of luther this man had
[1:50:11] all nine spiritual gifts operating in
[1:50:14] him that is amazing to me
[1:50:16] that god can trust you with all nine of
[1:50:18] the spiritual gifts
[1:50:21] i mean speak in tongues interpret wisdom
[1:50:24] knowledge right healing gift of healing
[1:50:27] all these things to being one man

[1:50:37] god help us to come around and get that
[1:50:39] one at the end here

[1:52:52] expectation for that
[1:52:55] you know other things about uh wesley's
[1:52:57] that they said you could not
[1:52:58] find him in lowness of spirit
[1:53:03] even a quarter hour that means for 15
[1:53:07] minutes the man would not be discouraged
[1:53:10] some kind of way when discouragement
[1:53:11] would come and maybe you know how your
[1:53:13] spears get down a little bit
[1:53:17] and the devil said i got him and you
[1:53:19] know sometimes y'all experience get down
[1:53:20] the devil try to take y'all into
[1:53:22] depression
[1:53:23] oppression regression your spirit is
[1:53:26] down
[1:53:27] right but john west says something he
[1:53:29] had a internal
[1:53:31] mechanism
[1:53:34] maybe he looked at his watch
[1:53:37] and tell the devil i'm giving you 14
[1:53:40] minutes
[1:53:44] come on somebody 14 minutes to
[1:53:47] have that bad thought 14 minutes to feel
[1:53:50] uh gloomy in my spirit but on the 15th
[1:53:53] minute that's it
[1:53:55] get out of here with all that gloom and
[1:53:57] doubt i will not receive it
[1:54:00] some kind of way there was a mechanism
[1:54:02] in john wesley
[1:54:04] and i told you the man had marital
[1:54:06] problems
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:12] can you imagine that being drugged by
[1:54:16] his hair
[1:54:16] by his wife but in 15 minutes
[1:54:27] oh glory to god that's a man that's
[1:54:30] living by scripture
[1:54:32] life nor death nor this nor that nothing
[1:54:36] gonna
[1:54:37] separate me from the love of god which
[1:54:39] is in christ jesus my lord
[1:54:44] i'm not i'm sorry i know we disagree i
[1:54:46] know we i know we disagree
[1:54:48] and yeah that's why i said on sunday you
[1:54:50] know when we we got that we
[1:54:52] you know we we don't took that scripture
[1:54:54] and we want to make it apply and i i
[1:54:55] think it does apply
[1:54:57] you try scripture say don't let the sun
[1:54:59] go down upon your wrath he said well we
[1:55:01] got to talk out every problem before we
[1:55:02] go to bed
[1:55:03] it sounds so good
[1:55:06] but but what about when the sun already
[1:55:09] went down
[1:55:11] and we're in a disagreement
[1:55:17] and that invisible line come out y'all
[1:55:19] ain't gonna talk to me y'all married

[1:55:46] happens here's the thing don't allow
[1:55:48] that to stay there
[1:55:50] there ought to be something in your
[1:55:52] heart to want to get get back across
[1:55:54] that invisible line
[1:55:57] where y'all can cuddle a little bit more
[1:56:00] amen but sometimes you got to learn how
[1:56:03] to put some conversations in the parking
[1:56:05] lot
[1:56:05] and come back and talk about them later
[1:56:10] now don't don't leave it in the parking
[1:56:11] lot all right
[1:56:13] when we sometimes we take them trips
[1:56:15] when we get the bus we put our cars in
[1:56:17] the parking lot
[1:56:18] but when the bus get back get your car
[1:56:19] at the parking lot
[1:56:23] amen and be committed to talking about
[1:56:25] it look

[1:56:28] to tell my wife okay uh
[1:56:30] and i have to be the one to say okay i'm
[1:56:32] not ready to talk about that now but
[1:56:34] on such and such a day we're gonna talk
[1:56:36] about that
[1:56:37] and when i give her the day i can't let
[1:56:39] nothing come between that time
[1:56:41] see uh it's i ain't in father's day yet

[1:56:55] when to talk and when not to talk
[1:56:57] on the way to church is not the time to
[1:57:00] pick a fight
[1:57:05] maybe just say honey you know i do have
[1:57:07] something in my heart i just when you
[1:57:08] got time i like to talk to you about
[1:57:10] it all right but don't be trying to pick
[1:57:13] fights all the time
[1:57:15] hallelujah
[1:57:23] and just give me your overcoming power
[1:57:24] when you're on the house
[1:57:27] if if you can conquer your own house you
[1:57:29] can do some concrete in other places
[1:57:32] it's the truth anyhow but this man this
[1:57:35] man could not find
[1:57:36] 15 minutes
[1:57:39] in any hour where he was
[1:57:43] discouraged for over 15 minutes
[1:57:48] what a man
[1:57:54] they say he slept no more than six hours
[1:57:55] a day let's just read this
[1:57:57] philadelphia church age go go to that
[1:57:59] quote let's read this
[1:58:00] uh just talking about this messenger how
[1:58:03] god used them
[1:58:04] mighty man of god and i i am i i'm gonna
[1:58:07] have to go over time for y'all today if
[1:58:08] y'all don't mind
[1:58:09] amen just give me i just i want to bring
[1:58:12] this one to a close that way i can get
[1:58:13] into
[1:58:14] the the seventh uh here it says um
[1:58:16] wesley was a remarkably strong man
[1:58:19] he says of himself that he could not
[1:58:21] remember to felt
[1:58:23] have felt loneliness of spirits for even
[1:58:25] a quarter hour since he was born
[1:58:28] he slept no more than six hours a day
[1:58:31] arose in time to start preaching at five
[1:58:33] practically
[1:58:34] every day of his ministry preach up to
[1:58:36] four times on a single day
[1:58:39] so that in a year he would average
[1:58:44] average over 800 sermons
[1:58:48] when i first started the ministry i said
[1:58:50] lord how am i gonna get
[1:58:52] 52 messages for 52 sundays in a year
[1:58:55] god that's a lot then i read this quote
[1:58:57] i said lord jesus
[1:59:02] this man preached over 800 sermons a
[1:59:04] year i ain't got nothing on it
[1:59:07] right he said he traveled multiple
[1:59:09] thousands of miles
[1:59:10] as did his circuit riders who carried
[1:59:12] the gospel near and far
[1:59:14] in fact wesley traveled 4 500 miles per
[1:59:17] year by
[1:59:20] not in a car not flying
[1:59:23] horse now you can imagine why he prayed
[1:59:25] for that horse he could have been in the
[1:59:26] middle of nowhere
[1:59:29] i ain't got time for this horse to go
[1:59:30] out on me
[1:59:32] i'ma lay hands and i'm gonna pray and
[1:59:34] we're gonna get up and keep riding
[1:59:37] sometimes you gotta understand your
[1:59:38] position as a son and daughter of god
[1:59:41] no i'm gonna let the devil just do that
[1:59:42] to me
[1:59:44] amen right it says uh he was a believer
[1:59:47] in the power of god and prayed for the
[1:59:49] sick with great faith and wonderful
[1:59:51] results
[1:59:52] many of his meetings saw the
[1:59:54] manifestation of spiritual
[1:59:56] gifts now here's the the thing and i
[1:59:59] want to try to bring this
[2:00:01] home if i can god help us their
[2:00:04] ministries was used as a restoration i
[2:00:07] mentioned to the
[2:00:08] the first three ages when you read
[2:00:10] revelation chapter 2
[2:00:12] um the age of ephesus smyrna pergamos
[2:00:15] uh it was all the open door to the false
[2:00:18] vine
[2:00:18] there's an open door to the false vine
[2:00:20] and in thigh tier we actually saw the
[2:00:22] full manifestation on the maturity of
[2:00:25] that false vine
[2:00:26] coming to thy tier right uh that was the
[2:00:28] age of
[2:00:29] 1500 years of darkness there in thigh
[2:00:31] tier that's why you see it up there
[2:00:33] columbus being the messenger but it was
[2:00:34] it was what they call the dark ages
[2:00:36] even in history right but but after
[2:00:40] the dark ages came a time of reformation
[2:00:43] right the church began to reform on the
[2:00:45] luther on the wesley to finally hit this
[2:00:48] day
[2:00:48] and we completed that that that process
[2:00:51] i should say not just a reformation but
[2:00:53] a restoration
[2:00:54] begin to happen hallelujah
[2:00:58] now here uh joel 1
[2:01:01] 4 let's read that see the first
[2:01:04] first three ages was open door to the
[2:01:06] false vine but the last three ages
[2:01:08] started as philadelphia laodicea
[2:01:10] that's the open door to the the truth
[2:01:14] the open door to the true vine the truth
[2:01:16] all right so here
[2:01:17] uh and joel 1 4 says that which the
[2:01:20] palmer worm
[2:01:21] hath left have the locust eaten and
[2:01:25] that which the locusts have left half
[2:01:27] the cankerworm eaten
[2:01:28] and that which the cankerworm hath left
[2:01:31] have the caterpillar
[2:01:33] eaten so now there's four uh uh
[2:01:36] four insects that are identified in this
[2:01:38] scripture we got the palmer worm
[2:01:40] we got the locusts we got the cankerworm
[2:01:43] we got the caterpillar now what the
[2:01:45] prophet tells us this is the same
[2:01:47] insect at four different stages
[2:01:51] hallelujah amen and and what the palmer
[2:01:54] warren's job
[2:01:55] to do amen when it came to the church
[2:01:57] and this is what happened
[2:01:59] not only in church history through the
[2:02:01] ages this
[2:02:02] this happened but also it happens to us
[2:02:04] as individuals
[2:02:06] glory to god some of us are in these
[2:02:08] stages right now
[2:02:09] the palmer worm when he comes around his
[2:02:12] job
[2:02:13] is to take the fruit of brotherly love
[2:02:16] he takes the the sense of loving your
[2:02:19] brother and loving your sister
[2:02:20] he takes that from the church he allows
[2:02:22] something to happen
[2:02:24] he causes something to happen where a
[2:02:27] sister falls out of love
[2:02:28] with her sister he allows something to
[2:02:31] happen where a brother falls out of love
[2:02:33] with with his brother
[2:02:34] amen they know that uh oh that ain't
[2:02:36] nothing but the devil but they allow the
[2:02:39] devil to sit there and
[2:02:40] feed on that negativity
[2:02:43] you're being affected by a palmer worm
[2:02:48] that's right right the locust dance that
[2:02:51] that when and if you let the palmer sit
[2:02:53] there too long
[2:02:54] he goes into another stage and he
[2:02:56] becomes the locust
[2:02:58] and what the locust is he starts eating
[2:03:00] at the joy
[2:03:03] hallelujah the joy and the leaves of
[2:03:07] fellowship
[2:03:08] amen that's why we wanted to come
[2:03:09] together last week intentionally
[2:03:11] just to have some fellowship and i just
[2:03:15] i thank god that we have an opportunity
[2:03:17] to get there and have fellowship with
[2:03:19] you get a chance to know me in a
[2:03:21] different setting i get a chance to know
[2:03:23] you in a different set
[2:03:24] we just have fellowship don't let the
[2:03:27] devil eat the
[2:03:28] joy of the leaves of fellowship
[2:03:33] if we can't have fellowship here how are
[2:03:35] we going to have it on the other side
[2:03:37] we got to start practicing heaven now
[2:03:43] the third stage if he starts taking the
[2:03:45] leaves of fellowship
[2:03:46] because that's where the tree as it has
[2:03:48] the leaves those nice branches there
[2:03:50] with the leaves you want to get up
[2:03:51] underneath
[2:03:52] that tree and just get some shade but if
[2:03:54] you don't have no leaves
[2:03:56] there you can't get it just bare sun you
[2:03:57] don't get no you get no benefit
[2:03:59] from the tree
[2:04:01] but the devil goes to the next stage so
[2:04:03] he starts with cankerworm
[2:04:04] i'm at palmer and then he starts with
[2:04:06] locust then the third stage he goes to
[2:04:08] cankerworm
[2:04:09] now first he took the fruit of brotherly
[2:04:12] love
[2:04:12] then he took the leaves of fellowship
[2:04:15] now
[2:04:16] he's attacking the bark of the tree
[2:04:21] now seeing our english like english
[2:04:23] english language
[2:04:25] the word bark has many definitions
[2:04:28] because a dog can right a dog can bark
[2:04:32] and as that dog is bark that dog that
[2:04:34] the bark to the dog is his protection
[2:04:38] that's what he's going to use to kind of
[2:04:40] kind of get you off of them
[2:04:42] let you know he's there a little ground
[2:04:44] in a little bark
[2:04:45] hallelujah amen but for a tree
[2:04:48] the bark is the tree's protection
[2:04:53] amen the bark is the outermost covering
[2:04:56] of a tree trunk and the branches
[2:04:58] it's the protective skin of the tree
[2:05:01] hallelujah the bark is also what
[2:05:03] conserves
[2:05:04] water and serves serves to protect the
[2:05:07] trees essential living systems
[2:05:09] from environmental and situational
[2:05:11] dangers the bark protects
[2:05:13] it from situational dangers
[2:05:18] the the bark protest protects it from
[2:05:21] living systems that's coming to try to
[2:05:23] damage the tree
[2:05:24] oh hallelujah the bark is what protects
[2:05:27] it
[2:05:28] and if you don't have bark amen you you
[2:05:32] you're like a tree that's planted by the
[2:05:33] rivers of water right but if
[2:05:35] your bark is destroyed it's going to
[2:05:37] destroy the life inside of you
[2:05:39] you need that protection you need fruit
[2:05:43] you need leaves you need bark
[2:05:46] but here's what happens the last stage
[2:05:49] of this is the caterpillar
[2:05:53] and when it's the bark has been
[2:05:54] penetrated
[2:05:56] the the bark is no longer has that
[2:05:59] outward shell on the tree
[2:06:01] now the caterpillar can get right in to
[2:06:03] where the
[2:06:04] real tree is and begin to suck the life
[2:06:07] out of it
[2:06:08] recently me and my wife was on a little
[2:06:10] trip and
[2:06:12] we went to a little uh little city
[2:06:15] hey man georgetown south carolina i
[2:06:17] believe it was
[2:06:18] and we stopped there i told you i didn't
[2:06:20] know where i was going i just got in the
[2:06:21] car and started driving i ain't even
[2:06:23] ain't no no georgetown south carolina
[2:06:25] existed
[2:06:26] until i ended up stopping that day and
[2:06:28] we stopped there
[2:06:29] at this hotel uh and uh i went to pull
[2:06:33] into a parking space to get a little
[2:06:34] closer because you know my wife liked to
[2:06:36] park close
[2:06:37] she don't like to walk too far right so
[2:06:39] she say that's a close-up parking space
[2:06:41] right there
[2:06:42] so i got into the closer parking space
[2:06:44] and uh i backed up and
[2:06:46] and uh and i come out and the first
[2:06:48] thing i saw was this big bug
[2:06:50] coming at me i said my god i don't know
[2:06:52] what that is and
[2:06:53] and and it landed somewhere in my truck
[2:06:55] i say that's a pretty big bug dear you
[2:06:56] know watch out for that bug
[2:06:58] and she said where's it at you know it
[2:07:00] took off and started flying said
[2:07:01] it's gone and she turned around and
[2:07:03] looked at her tree says oh
[2:07:05] i say well what's the matter with you
[2:07:07] she said that just look
[2:07:08] oh no that don't oh i suck there's
[2:07:11] something wrong with this tree
[2:07:12] and this caterpillar's just lined all up
[2:07:15] all over the tree i mean just just just
[2:07:19] i i want to say thousands
[2:07:23] from one tree to the next tree and it
[2:07:25] was only as i started preparing the
[2:07:27] sermon that i realized what those
[2:07:29] caterpillars was doing
[2:07:30] was sucking the life out of that tree
[2:07:36] right i mean and they they came in
[2:07:38] droves to take the life out of that tree
[2:07:40] and you might not realize that when you
[2:07:42] lose the fruit
[2:07:44] hey man hallelujah when you lose the
[2:07:47] fruit of brotherly love
[2:07:49] when you lose a man leaves a fellowship
[2:07:52] when you allow the enemy to start
[2:07:54] attacking the bark then the caterpillars
[2:07:56] come
[2:07:57] and they begin to take all the life
[2:08:00] but i got good news for you there is an
[2:08:03] intelligence
[2:08:04] that's inside the tree hallelujah
[2:08:08] and that intelligence says caterpillar
[2:08:11] i'm not gonna let you take on a life
[2:08:13] the life begins to go down into the
[2:08:16] roots
[2:08:18] and brother branham called it the
[2:08:20] predestinated
[2:08:21] roots and there comes a time when amen
[2:08:24] the
[2:08:25] the process of death reverses and now
[2:08:28] becomes a process of life
[2:08:30] god says i will restore
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:34] oh that the palmer worm
[2:08:38] oh that's a locust glory to god

[2:08:46] caterpillar

[2:10:41] loved ones that's
[2:10:42] not here and it may look like they're in
[2:10:44] a real dead condition but there's a root
[2:10:46] there
[2:10:48] there is a root still there the devil
[2:10:50] ain't been able to bring out his stump
[2:10:51] grinder
[2:10:52] he can't grind the roots
[2:10:57] man we we were over in palm beach y'all
[2:11:00] seen that tree over in palm beaches
[2:11:02] i mean i think it's a banyan tree you
[2:11:03] look at the root system of that tree
[2:11:05] it ain't going nowhere no storm gonna
[2:11:08] take it out
[2:11:10] right and what you need to know i don't
[2:11:11] care what your children going through

[2:11:17] glory to god they're gonna come back to
[2:11:19] this the same way you have a desire to
[2:11:21] live for the devil
[2:11:23] god gonna give you a desire to want to
[2:11:25] live for him
[2:11:27] your desire is perverted but god will
[2:11:31] change your perverted desire
[2:11:35] amen glory to god it says this says and
[2:11:39] if four messengers of death kill the
[2:11:41] tree
[2:11:42] four messengers of life restores the
[2:11:45] tree
[2:11:46] says do you get it it says amen for god
[2:11:48] said i will restore it
[2:11:50] he's going to restore it how by four
[2:11:52] death messengers
[2:11:54] killed it then four life messengers will
[2:11:56] restore it
[2:11:58] amen he says what was the first martin
[2:12:00] luther
[2:12:01] justification what was the second john
[2:12:03] wesley by sanctification
[2:12:05] what was the third pentecost with the
[2:12:07] restoration of the gifts now listen
[2:12:10] the church as it was going to uh going
[2:12:13] through his restoration it had to go
[2:12:14] through justification
[2:12:16] sanctification restoration of the gifts
[2:12:19] why do you think we're having
[2:12:20] a terrorist service because that's a
[2:12:23] part of the church's restoration
[2:12:27] the gifts are supposed to be flowing in
[2:12:29] the church
[2:12:30] it's just got to be done correctly but
[2:12:32] we encourage the gifts
[2:12:35] hallelujah amen we're not pentecostals
[2:12:37] we're not going to get lost
[2:12:39] lost in these things but we want to see
[2:12:41] everything that god promised to be in
[2:12:43] the church
[2:12:43] we wanted to be there amen it says this
[2:12:47] he says um
[2:12:48] uh wesley about sanctification what was
[2:12:50] the third pentecost with the restoration
[2:12:52] of the gifts
[2:12:52] the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:55] what was the fourth
[2:12:56] this is this is the important part glory
[2:12:58] to god what was the fourth
[2:12:59] the word what the word they were for
[2:13:02] great prophecy
[2:13:03] it's not just stopping at justification
[2:13:05] it's not just stopping at sanctification
[2:13:07] it's not just stopping at the amen at
[2:13:10] the baptism of the holy ghost but we
[2:13:11] must have the word
[2:13:13] that is the fourth stage of restoration
[2:13:18] hallelujah this is why pentecost they'll
[2:13:20] take the gifts but they won't take the
[2:13:21] word
[2:13:22] there's many other churches out there
[2:13:24] that take all these other things but
[2:13:25] they won't take the word
[2:13:26] we must have the word and notice what
[2:13:30] brother branham said that they were four
[2:13:32] great prophets that mean he called
[2:13:34] luther prophet
[2:13:36] he called wesley a prophet and and and
[2:13:39] pentecost was
[2:13:40] uh william seymour he had the ability to
[2:13:44] see
[2:13:44] that god could do more in his church and
[2:13:47] god honored that man
[2:13:49] honored this man's faith and allowed the
[2:13:51] baptism of the holy ghost to
[2:13:53] pour out there in a sousa street in the
[2:13:55] church has never been the same
[2:13:56] since we thank god for where we come
[2:13:59] from
[2:14:00] and what what we come through where we
[2:14:04] come from and what we come through
[2:14:05] i don't i don't say everything i went
[2:14:07] through even some of the fanatical
[2:14:08] things that i went through it wasn't all
[2:14:10] for naught
[2:14:13] no god had purpose for bringing me
[2:14:15] through that
[2:14:16] but he gave me the strength to hold my
[2:14:18] head above the fanaticism
[2:14:20] thank god for that here he says this
[2:14:24] one of them martin luther he began to
[2:14:25] shine a light there was a little light
[2:14:27] just a very small strength of
[2:14:28] justification alone came wesley stronger
[2:14:31] sanctification after wesley came
[2:14:32] stronger than him pentecostal
[2:14:34] the baptism of the holy ghost and
[2:14:36] another great prophecy
[2:14:38] and he says um but in the last days
[2:14:43] of malachi 4 elijah is to come with the
[2:14:46] very word
[2:14:48] the word of the lord came to the prophet
[2:14:50] and the evening lights is to come forth
[2:14:52] to restore and bring back what
[2:14:55] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:14:56] the faith of their father the faith of
[2:14:58] faith of god
[2:15:00] the fourth light now you can just see
[2:15:02] right there
[2:15:03] that's another junction the fourth light
[2:15:07] is actually another junction which is
[2:15:09] actually the final light
[2:15:11] hallelujah it's the final age this is
[2:15:14] why if you can't recognize the word for
[2:15:16] your day
[2:15:19] you're lacking still
[2:15:22] can i just read out of uh um joel
[2:15:26] and we'll bring it to a close brother
[2:15:28] branham always took this scripture from
[2:15:30] from acts 2 and i read from verse 14 to
[2:15:32] 21
[2:15:33] but when you go back to joel 2 you'll
[2:15:36] see
[2:15:36] that that's where he got it from this is
[2:15:39] the promise for our day
[2:15:41] and this promise amen comes right
[2:15:44] through what luther and what wesley
[2:15:48] started
[2:15:49] i'm starting at verse 23 joel chapter 2.
[2:15:52] i'll read this and then we'll close
[2:15:54] this church that that we all are part of
[2:15:57] we're not here by accident we're not
[2:16:00] here by chance
[2:16:02] we are here by predestination i want to
[2:16:05] tell some of y'all
[2:16:06] some of y'all uh uh the relationships
[2:16:09] that people have gotten into
[2:16:10] you know it didn't start in the church
[2:16:12] it started outside the church
[2:16:15] it started outside the church and and
[2:16:18] you know oftentimes you know certainly i
[2:16:19] i'll be the first to admit
[2:16:21] i always want to see believers marry
[2:16:23] believers
[2:16:25] i always want to see that it save save a
[2:16:28] lot of trouble
[2:16:30] say the pastor haven't stopped he don't
[2:16:32] have to have as many meetings
[2:16:36] when believers married believers
[2:16:39] because the pastor just give them the
[2:16:40] word and they take the word amen
[2:16:43] and they apply that and they go on but
[2:16:44] we got an unbelieving a believer
[2:16:46] they the unbeliever don't even want to
[2:16:48] hear the word
[2:16:50] now you got to get the spirit of
[2:16:52] discernment and you
[2:16:54] wore out tired looking for the spirit of
[2:16:56] discernment and try to give them
[2:16:57] something
[2:16:57] that'll help them right but but but but
[2:17:00] but but um
[2:17:03] when it does happen and it does here's
[2:17:06] the other part to that because
[2:17:07] the good thing about this god already
[2:17:09] knows
[2:17:10] it was going to happen before it did god
[2:17:14] already knew so sometimes you just stop
[2:17:16] fighting
[2:17:17] and i'm gonna tell you who you're
[2:17:18] fighting god
[2:17:25] you think god couldn't stop them from
[2:17:26] getting involved in that
[2:17:28] you think god couldn't wipe that that
[2:17:29] person out do you think god couldn't
[2:17:31] no god allowed it to happen for a reason
[2:17:34] and i'ma give you the reason
[2:17:35] i'm gonna give you the reason why i got
[2:17:36] allowed to happen you want to know the
[2:17:38] reason
[2:17:39] because god uses human beings
[2:17:46] to redeem
[2:17:50] other human beings
[2:17:58] i got to be careful when i say that
[2:17:59] because now some young person gonna say
[2:18:01] well you know
[2:18:02] the pastor said god uses human beings
[2:18:06] to redeem of the now you ain't got to
[2:18:08] make that choice
[2:18:10] now if you make that choice with that
[2:18:11] with that quote you're going to redeem
[2:18:13] them
[2:18:14] but jesus went to a cross
[2:18:18] to redeem us he went to a cross he went
[2:18:21] through some pain
[2:18:24] so you want the other side of that
[2:18:29] and don't don't when you when it get
[2:18:32] painful don't talk about quitting then
[2:18:34] go back to that same quote that led you
[2:18:37] out there keeping them
[2:18:39] keep it on the top of your lips god uses
[2:18:41] human beings
[2:18:46] to redeem other human beings
[2:18:52] joel 2 verse 23 let's read
[2:18:56] be glad then your children are zion and
[2:18:59] rejoice in the lord your god for he hath
[2:19:01] given you
[2:19:02] the former reign moderately and he will
[2:19:03] cause to come down for you to rain
[2:19:05] the former rain and the latter rain in
[2:19:07] the first month
[2:19:09] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[2:19:11] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[2:19:14] and oil
[2:19:14] revelation and i will restore to you the
[2:19:18] years i love this promise you might go
[2:19:21] through this process you feel like i
[2:19:22] lost a lot of time god
[2:19:24] said i'm gonna give you back the years
[2:19:26] that you thought you lost
[2:19:28] i will restore to you the years that the
[2:19:31] locusts have eaten
[2:19:33] the canker and the caterpillar and the
[2:19:35] palmer my great army which i sent among
[2:19:37] you
[2:19:37] look at this and ye shall eat and plenty
[2:19:40] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[2:19:43] the lord your god that hath dealt
[2:19:45] wondrously with you and my people shall
[2:19:47] never
[2:19:48] be ashamed and ye shall know that
[2:19:52] i am in the midst of israel and that i
[2:19:55] am the lord your god and none else and
[2:19:57] my
[2:19:58] people i thank god for this promise
[2:20:02] shall never be ashamed
[2:20:05] you know i i like that i just i i'm
[2:20:08] gonna just
[2:20:09] camp that just for a second you know
[2:20:10] sometimes satan gets you
[2:20:12] get our young people in a certain
[2:20:14] situation and and they can
[2:20:16] do things that embarrass us
[2:20:19] it's embarrassing for you to carry
[2:20:21] yourself like that
[2:20:22] it's embarrassing for you to be dressed
[2:20:24] like that it's embarrassing
[2:20:27] because you know better it's
[2:20:28] embarrassing but you know maybe satan
[2:20:30] may
[2:20:31] flaunt them out there like that but wait
[2:20:33] till god turns them around on the inside
[2:20:36] then you can go right back to the devil
[2:20:39] and quote this scripture
[2:20:41] that god said my people
[2:20:44] would never be ashamed
[2:20:48] because actually it's a greater
[2:20:50] testimony when you come from somewhere
[2:20:54] when you don't come through something
[2:20:55] it's a it's a greater testimony it gives
[2:20:57] god
[2:20:58] even more glory
[2:21:02] hallelujah that don't mean leave here
[2:21:04] and go try to get a testimony
[2:21:06] you got to try to walk right down the
[2:21:07] middle folks they might just be
[2:21:08] everywhere
[2:21:09] they will just throw anything at you
[2:21:12] don't don't just eat
[2:21:13] anything it's it's better
[2:21:17] when you can have somewhere that you
[2:21:19] come from you can talk to somebody about
[2:21:20] something
[2:21:22] it's also good
[2:21:26] it's also real real good
[2:21:29] it's great it's better if i can i can
[2:21:32] use that word too
[2:21:34] when you keep yourself
[2:21:40] and remain faithful to god in the midst
[2:21:42] of whatever it is keep your head above
[2:21:43] fanaticism
[2:21:46] just because you see some other brother
[2:21:48] sister go out don't mean you got to go
[2:21:49] out
[2:21:50] keep yourself above the fanaticism
[2:21:55] and this is what happened when the dead
[2:21:56] when one go down he always trying to
[2:21:58] take another one down with him
[2:22:00] that's why you got to watch it you
[2:22:02] become a target
[2:22:04] but i ain't going down with you i see
[2:22:06] you
[2:22:08] i ain't going down with you though if
[2:22:11] you want to come up now
[2:22:12] come to church amen but repent
[2:22:17] all right and god will bring you i'm at
[2:22:19] verse um
[2:22:20] 28. and it shall come to pass after that
[2:22:23] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[2:22:25] and your sons and your daughters shall
[2:22:26] prophesy
[2:22:28] your men shall dream dreams your young
[2:22:29] men shall see visions
[2:22:31] and also upon the servants and upon the
[2:22:34] handmaids in those days will i pour out
[2:22:36] my spirit
[2:22:37] and i will show wonders in heavens
[2:22:40] and in the earth blood and fire and
[2:22:42] pillars of smoke
[2:22:43] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[2:22:45] and the moon into blood before the great
[2:22:47] and terrible day of the lord come
[2:22:49] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[2:22:52] shall call on the name of the lord shall
[2:22:54] be delivered
[2:22:56] for in mount zion and in jerusalem
[2:23:00] and in spirit and truth shall be
[2:23:03] deliverance
[2:23:05] as the lord has said and in the remnant
[2:23:07] whom the lord
[2:23:08] shall call we're
[2:23:11] living in the time of this
[2:23:14] restoration what was lost through the
[2:23:18] first
[2:23:18] uh few ages amen has now come back to
[2:23:21] whole and
[2:23:22] and luther and wesley their ministries
[2:23:24] would use to bring the church back
[2:23:26] to this place that we're living in right
[2:23:28] now but remember
[2:23:30] uh first light was luther's light second
[2:23:33] light
[2:23:33] was wesley's light third light was
[2:23:36] actually the light of the pentecostals
[2:23:39] it's the light of the pentecostals but
[2:23:41] we're not walking in that light anymore
[2:23:44] the fourth light is the restoration of
[2:23:47] the word of god
[2:23:49] and that's the light we're walking in
[2:23:50] with the expectation
[2:23:52] that we will have justification we will
[2:23:54] have sanctification
[2:23:56] we will have the gifts of the spirit
[2:23:59] with the word
[2:24:03] the sixth junction
[2:24:07] praise the lord
[2:24:15] i just love the lord
[2:24:18] um musicians y'all prepared to come and
[2:24:23] just give me this last quote out of
[2:24:24] harvest time
[2:24:29] it says look hurrying there must come a
[2:24:32] true seed there has
[2:24:33] just got to be because he's coming for
[2:24:35] the bride without spot or wrinkle
[2:24:37] he's coming for it a word vindicated
[2:24:40] pride
[2:24:41] oh should be such a little bitty group
[2:24:45] because people look at you know these
[2:24:47] great big mega churches and you know we
[2:24:49] think god is in it no
[2:24:50] the bride will be a little
[2:24:53] bitty group jesus said as it was in the
[2:24:56] days of noah wearing eight souls was
[2:24:58] saved is that right
[2:24:59] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[2:25:01] of man how many i don't know
[2:25:02] but see that bride is going to be made
[2:25:04] up of all down through
[2:25:06] that had the word in their age so the
[2:25:09] bride is made up of all these seven ages
[2:25:11] right
[2:25:11] it says it's not just this last group
[2:25:14] god is going to take the whole thing out
[2:25:16] of here
[2:25:16] it says oh no it'll be so small it'll be
[2:25:19] surprising
[2:25:21] they'll come up missing you won't even
[2:25:23] know they're gone
[2:25:24] what if he took 500 in this last day you
[2:25:27] you would never know it
[2:25:28] took 500 in a few days uh time two or
[2:25:31] three days
[2:25:32] there's that many people comes up
[2:25:33] missing across the world don't even know
[2:25:35] where they're at
[2:25:36] never hear nothing about them the secret
[2:25:39] coming of the lord jesus shall be taken
[2:25:40] away
[2:25:41] and the rest of them go right ahead
[2:25:43] preaching just
[2:25:45] like it was in the days of noah my
[2:25:48] glory to god we got it hallelujah and
[2:25:50] sealed to their death
[2:25:52] that's what the bible says and it can't
[2:25:54] fail this is the statement i want to
[2:25:55] leave you with
[2:25:56] as moses as as noah moses
[2:26:00] david reflected the coming of this
[2:26:02] perfect bridegroom
[2:26:04] so has luther wesley and pentecost
[2:26:08] reflected the coming of a perfect bride
[2:26:14] as noah moses david
[2:26:18] reflected the coming of this perfect
[2:26:20] bridegroom
[2:26:21] so has luther wesley and pentecost
[2:26:25] reflected the coming of a perfect bride

[2:26:43] hand to praise

[2:27:10] thank you for the ability to see
[2:27:15] not only what you're doing but what you
[2:27:16] have done
[2:27:19] it's great ministries that you've sent
[2:27:20] to the earth the ministry of luther
[2:27:22] the ministry of wesley great men of god
[2:27:26] that you use in a mighty way
[2:27:30] wesley being a man that god not even
[2:27:33] 15 minutes of a day that man could be
[2:27:37] found discouraged
[2:27:40] he would not allow that um
[2:27:44] palmer worm to even get started
[2:27:49] for the if if the pommel worm sits there
[2:27:51] too long then it
[2:27:52] evolves to locus locust a cankerworm
[2:27:55] can't go room to a caterpillar
[2:27:57] god before we know the tree is
