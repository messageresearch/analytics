appreciate you uh thank God for the specials amen that uh went forth on today certainly appreciate that and uh we'll um get our bies um and go to the book of uh Joel chapter 1 amen good to see everybody in the house of God Amen and um um I wanted to also just um officially welcome sister Smith Amen in our Mitch so so good to have her in fellowship with us we we certainly thank God certainly thank god um Joel 1 and 4 and um I do want to read another scripture but I I'll just have a word of prayer let you be seated uh um and uh we'll go from there but Joel 14 it says um that which the palmerworm with left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust has left ha the korm eaten and that which the korm have left ha the caterpillar eaten and um we know according to Joel 2 uh there is a promise that God will restore amen and we'll just read that verse 25 and Joel 2 amen just just his promised uh the condition looked hopeless in Joel 1 and if I could just um uh just put it this way some of your situations may look like Joel 14 amen some of your circumstances may look like Joel 14 but you got to keep reading amen and you'll get your promise on the other other side side of it um and and when you're looking at the promise you can't look at the uh the realities of joel4 you have to always keep your eyes on Joel 2:25 because it it tells you what God thinks about it right right amen God see I mean just everything been taken this been taken that been taken feel like a job don't you Hallelujah but you know on the other side of job's uh trial y'all know what he got double you always get double for your trouble come on somebody we we say we we serve the same God if the devil rob you of some Finance expect double everything you lost and I mentioned it over I think I know I mentioned it here and I mention it in um in in in um London earlier this year uh the devil takes one of your loved ones out all right gets them mixed up with some a young man a young woman and they know they've been taught right and they weren't supposed to do that all right but it happens anyway amen and since the devil got involved in all that and caused all this trouble I get double for my trouble so I'm I'm claiming my child and I'm claiming the one they got involved with and if if you keep messing with me I'm going claim they Mama they daddy they I'mma take the whole family glory to God Amen we we have to realize where we stand as Believers amen so this verse in uh uh Joel 2:25 it says and I will restore to you amen the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people glory to God it it look like it's shameful but I when when the scripture say my people should never be ashamed and actually he says it um uh twice Amen in in that in in and the next verse he repeats it again again double all right but uh but the reason that he can say that my people never be ashamed y'all be seated hold on let's pray let's pray let's pray I'm I'm father we thank you for the word and we thank you for this journey that you have uh that you're taking us on and uh God we we are certainly enjoying the ride and father I pray that you would just take control over everything thought that is presented every thought that's received uh get Glory and Honor out of this portion of the services in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you be seated uh just uh let me get over to acts uh chapter 2 and but I'll just make a comment here but the reason I I feel that uh Joel could promise US um through the inspiration of God that the people will never be ashamed especially when you looking at your situation as a Joel 14 situation but when you start viewing it as Joel 2 uh 25- 27 really um and he says my people should never be ashamed it's because the restoration always looks better than the actual fall or the demise and and you know when when but I mean because just imagine the testimony that is shared when you come through on the other side right so so so that's why God can say they ain't never going to be ashamed because wait till they start sharing their testimony of what God did and all the people that's going to be encouraged and all the people that's going to be set free right that's why my people will never be ashamed amen and some some and and and you know praise God I I heard that this week sometimes you have to walk through the Hall of Shame before you can go into the Hall of Fame amen and that that's what I heard sister told me that but but you have to go through things be before your testimony can be recognized job had to go through something something before we could identify with J come on somebody right I mean you know all the the children of Israel they had to go through things and you understand as they were going through this is where God had the opportunity to manifest his attributes if if you if you didn't have a trial God would never be able to show you nothing if you was never sick you'd never understand him as a Healer if you was Never Bound you never understand him as a deliverer come on somebody amen you have to go through something to be able to enjoy the attributes of God and and it's the trial that releases the [Applause] attribute come on just you don't pray God just take me to it but God bring me through [Applause] it yeah you can go through the fire and not be burned come on somebody you can go through a red sea and not drown this is the god that you serve you can go into a lion's T and not be killed yeah your God know how to protect you your God know how to keep you come on I'm talking about your God this morning I learn to be content in what whatever state I'm in I'm in blessed be the name of Lord I just wanted to read a little bit here I was last week we thank the Lord for taking us there to um Virginia DC area we had a wonderful service there in um at the service brother that I I I hadn't seen in years and I forgot that he actually attended that church but he used to attend uh Church in New York and he um and he he walked up to the car after uh after service and was just you know greeting me and he said brother I want to give you this little um this you know this little track and it said the P Pentecostal Heritage um um uh Incorporated and it just says it happened here the house on Bonnie Bray and uh so I said brother you know you give me this and you know this is where I'm at in my and in in our journey here we talking about the restoration and and and I'm I'm shifting a little bit uh moving from that third stage the first stage of restoration was uh Martin Luther amen he was the the uh the first life messenger brother random said there were four death Messengers a Palmer worm a cankerworm a locust a caterpillar these four death Messengers they begin to take things away from the church praise God it says but there were four life Messengers amen that came back uh that and and they came in their specific Seasons that God sent them first one was Luther and when he nailed them 95 thesis to the Catholic Church door that was bringing life back into the church the Protestant which we would be considered that that's where that began to start when Martin Luther called a revelation that what the Catholics are doing was wrong right now and then after that uh he went took it so far then the Baton was hand over to John Wesley and he brought the sanctification message back into the church and even the Methodist people used to believe that sanctification glory to God John Wesley they preached it right and uh so the sanctification came back into the church and then after that the third life messenger was the restoration of the gifts justification bring life sanctification bring life the restoration of the gifts bring life and then the fourth part is the restoration of the word and and and and and and and really what we have this this not something that uh something new to come we already been preaching the word the restored word is what what shows us where we at right so so so we've been talking about that but uh but it's I thought it was just very important for us to kind of understand you know just what the Lord is doing and really get it uh in our spirits that what we're what we're reading in the Book of Joel is a prophecy for this day my God my God my God if I can if just drill drill that one home it's a prophecy for this day just like Malachi 4 was a prophecy for this day Revelation 107 was a prophecy for this day St Luke 17:30 was a prophecy for this day hello somebody um I can't remember Matthew 17 11 through 13 something like that Jesus said that Elias was going to come restore all things that was a prophecy for this day we're living in Prophecy let me let me just read a little bit and I'mma I'mma I'mma Move On by the grace of God I got a uh uh acts Acts 2 I read this I think um at the closing of my last sermon on I get back in Step oh Lord acts two and I tell you as the years going by the Lord just uh let me see that this get back and step was a lot deeper than what I thought amen but here uh let's start at verse one when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly praise God now now you got to understand before Acts 2 uh the the disciples were told to go up into the upper room and wait until they were ued with power from on high and they waited 10 days and as they were waiting 10 days not knowing what this power that was that was they were supposed to be in do they had no idea what this was all about but they waited patiently and God comes down now here's here's here's the the scripture that we're picking up now on this 10th day when the day of Pentecost which was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly thank you Jesus there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of a fire uh and uh and it sat upon each of them this was this clothing tongues is is what we call the pillow fire you saw that but when you see the picture of brother brandom and the and the pillar fire over amen over his shoulder as well as over his head this is a clothing tongue of fire amen and if I could just also make you understand that clothing tongue of fire is the Lord Jesus Christ amen this that that that that that that tongue of fire that pill of fire is the same thing Paul met on the road to Damascus and Paul began to talk to the pil ofier and say who art thou Lord and the pill ofier spoke back to Paul and said I am Jesus Hallelujah Hal hallelujah amen so verse verse four says um uh and and they were all filled at first the verse said the verse three says it set upon each of them and then it says they were all filled I I just I'm just telling you you're in the right place at the right time yes sir I'm telling you that right now and and we talk about the Holy Ghost that I change you from the inside and it'll reflect on the outside praise God Amen you in the right place at the right time uh it says and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them because heard them speak in his own language and they were all All Amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans so you know again here these people understanding in their native languages what is what has happening on the day of Pentecost this was the miracle behind uh these tongues that were spoken it was spoken in somebody's native language Lord I tell you the truth I I that's why I said we have people here can speak twe uh you know Africans and I mean Spanish and you know Creole and all kind and then you got somebody don't know don't even know nothing about somebody like me I don't know nothing about none of those languages I might know a few words here and there but God to take take control of my mouth and cause me to speak in tongues and amen and I speak in somebody else native language and they say that don't need no interpretation Hallelujah that's perfect Africans come on that's perfect TW God that's what I'm talking about church uh Hallelujah I I believe God has assembled us from various Nations can I put it that way God has assembled us from V various parts of the world Amen for such a time as this amen verse S amen amen uh it says um uh and they were all amazed and Marvel saying one to another behold are not all these which speak G Gans and how hear we every man in our own in our own tongue where we were born uh parthians and mes and uh elamites and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and capadia and pontis and Asia uh friia and P pamilia Egypt and in the parts of Libya about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and prelit creeks and Arabians we do hear them speak in our own tongue the wonderful works of God Amen and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what mean this others mocking now I I I I want you to kind of uh catch something because I want to read a little something I this pamphlet others mocking said these men are full of new wine now now now I I didn't share this part with you but typically a man when the Lord moves in a way like moved on the day of Pentecost there's some mocking that goes along with that hello somebody there's somebody to criticize there's somebody to pick at you hello somebody amen there's mocking that happens when when when this this occurs but but uh I'm I'm going read in a second let me just uh wait till I get there it says um others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his his voice amen uh lifted up his voice and said unto him ye men of Judea and ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day Hallelujah but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel Amen Let Me just pause there for a second and I want to just pick this up like I told you they have this picture it says it happened here the house on Bonnie Bray and what they're saying the ausa Street Revival uh broke out here at this at this house and a little history you know of the I read you know I talked about this before but uh they bring a few other things out that that I didn't have so I want to just kind of go back and repeat some of this but they were saying um and we stopped at verse 16 there uh this house on Bonnie Bray so they were saying um uh that William Seymour arrived there in Los Angeles he began teaching that speaking in tongues uh invariably accompanies the baptism with the Holy Spirit now and let me also just kind of make mention of something here this this group that put out this pamphlet very at the beginning they said uh Pentecostal herit Heritage a nonprofit California religious Corporation bid your holy greetings this organization now I want you to catch this this organization represents several prominent Pentecostal Persuasions several prominent Pentecostal Persuasions including the charismatics Oneness and trinitarians wait a minute there's a lot going on here but but they had to identify all these groups amongst the Pentecostals and and and the reason I'm bringing that out I need to make it very clear what happened Amen on the day of Pentecost was not the full restoration it was part of it but anytime it goes to denominational seed you know right there Satan got involved that is not the end of God's promise so I'm I'm just reading you just like I can give you history from you know uh Martin Luther and John Wesley I'm giving you Pentecostal history but this is a part this was one of the life Messengers that came back into the church now let me just let me just go a little further so if you ever pick up something like that and you start reading all these different groups you know wait a minute this ain't it that ain't that ain't a complete complete picture so let's go on uh it says uh they upon his arrival he's talking about uh William Seymour he began teaching that speaking in tongues invariably accompanies the baptism with the the the Holy Spirit Julia husin son the owner of the mission objected to his teaching and ordered Seymour and his supporters to leave uh hunterson then Pat locked the doors and refused to allow them re-entry because he was preaching the word and and and and what he saw in the word at that time he was denied re-entry well it says God placed on Richard and Ruth asbury's Hearts uh to open their doors here they did and the meeting resumes so when God closed one door he opened another one amen and I believe the doors that they're talking about is the ones here at this house the this doors was open at Bonnie Bray for them to just kind of keep the meetings and and I and here's the other thing I want you to get let me the pent I mean the the the the Souza Street Revival started in a house amen all right before they actually mve to a a condemned Church but it started in a house and I begin to think to myself God what would you like to start in the schoolhouse woo and notice now it starts in the house but it don't stop in the house the the the actually what happens is the Revival followed them wherever they went you know the rock follows us wherever we come so when it's time for us to move the Revival don't stop amen at 3777 J Road amen the the the Revival keeps going wherever God will take us but why not just let something get started right here in the house where we sitting at praise God here the the they said this they did and and the meetings resumed Seymour and a small band of Believers began to fast and pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and here's the the the beautiful thing he said on April 9th 1906 it happened now what's so what's so important about that April 9th 1906 it happened um the Souza Revival got us launched there but April 6 1909 something else happened yes sir a April 9th 1906 almost three years later almost right three years later uh that shows you when this other thing happened on April 6 1909 right that God W finish yet Hallelujah because what happened on April 6th 1909 is a prophet was born in Kentucky amen Oh My My My the fourth stage of this restoration sir Hallelujah and and and and and here's the problem you got many people that can speak in tongues many people that can that can that can interpret tongues many people with all kind of gifts and all that I mean words of wisdom all kind of things but if they cannot accept a prophet if you can do all that and not accept a prophet then something's wrong with your experience let's go on amen he says on April 9th 1906 it happened the group had gathered again with one Accord touching and agreeing concentrating on on on scriptures in the book of a book of Acts no one at this small gathering had clergy clergy credentials nor did anyone have an official pull pit each person did have the faith and determination to T for the Holy Ghost and look at this they said suddenly all resistance departed and the Holy Ghost came with a force incomprehensible to the human mind several members were slain instantly and baptized with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in unknown tongues God anointed Jenny Moore now watch this now God anointed Jenny Moore amen with the gift to play the piano for the first time did y oh and and just in case you did not know I I'll I'll let you know the Holy Ghost can play the piano yes he the Holy Ghost can play the drums the Holy Ghost can do whatever he want to do brother Brandon was in a meeting praise God and praying for the sick and the musicians got so anointed she was watching what was going on and she saw somebody get healed she's like my God I cannot play another note I got to give him a praise I got to give him glory and as that musician began to worship God the Holy Ghost picked up where she left off and the Holy Ghost is striking them Keys hey it's a real Holy [Applause] Ghost and he is a person brother I tell you here this lady ain't never played the piano life but because the Holy Spirit come in she get anointed to start playing the piano oh Lord Oh Lord oh Lord I I I I I I all I can say is is is pass me some of this amen he says they said this um uh Jimmy Moore with the gift to play the piano for the first time and singing unknown tongues another convert was given the gifts of Prophecy and the interpretation of tongues their shouts were so loud that they attracted the neighbors and a crowd congregated all in our house just praising God the shouts were so loud it attracted others can you imagine something like that y'all in here praising God and in the basketball court shut down gymnasium shut down they want to know what is going on in there amen they go on and say as God's Almighty power begin to Quake the people out of their chairs and off their feet under the power of the Holy Spirit Well now while they were because now this this this restoration amen is the restoration of the gifts so you know here this this um uh why why just the way that they they word this as the power as the God's Almighty power began to Quake the people out of their chairs and off their feet under the power of the Holy Spirit a prophecy came forth of great destruction which was soon to come to the land now April 9th 1906 is when this happened later on that month in April there was it's it's here let me just read it uh first but before this this great event happened a prophecy came out of the church telling people to repent watch this now it says this a prophecy came forth of great destruction which was soon to come to the land the Saints began pleading with Sinners to repent for their ways of sin and choose to walk with God and can I take a moment just a a moment amen and plead with some people repent repent that's right repent of your sin and turn to God Amen I just I I felt I just wanted to inject y'all just bear with me I I it's hard for me to preach this I just got to talk this but but I I I felt the Holy Spirit just kind of lead me just to kind of just stop and just deal with a few things that that I don't normally deal with but when I talk about repent can I just share my own personal testimony just for a little bit you know there was a time in my life I actually thought I repented I actually did you know there I remember uh as a young man you know we we grew up in church and you know Mom and Daddy you know made us go and and um you know as as teenagers we really didn't want to be made to go to church we you know we want to kind of do our own thing my dad really wasn't going my mom was going but my dad when my dad got tired of the foolishness that he saw in church that's why he wasn't going but he never discouraged us you know he he he would encourage us but I remember you know uh friends of mine they at their Church they had this this movie that they were going to play um burning hell and uh you know back then everybody preached on hell I mean and you didn't want to go to hell you you you serve God because you didn't want to go to hell amen like brother Jean was talking about last week he was saying you know you call somebody on the phone and and you weren't get no answer and we a have voicemail back in them days right and you we a have text messenger neither where they can if they if they can't answer they just send you a text and say I'll call you back in a minute you didn't have none of that back in them days you called especially somebody when you was really going through something you call and couldn't get a hold of them you like oh Lord oh God I hope the rap a happen we used to live like that oh Jesus Lord I can't get a hold of them F and now you praying in desperation mode and and and here you ain't got to live like that if you simply repent you can get yourself to the spot where real like I know the rap chain happen because I ain't gone if I'm still here the Rapture a took place yet that's the type of confidence you can have in God but I went there to the church and man after I watched that film they scared me out of my seat soon as they opened up that altar I went running down to the altar to give my heart to Christ I said yeah yeah yeah yeah I I don't want to go to hell I I want I want to live for the Lord I want to live for the Lord I I don't want to go to hell that was my reason for going to the altar because I didn't want to go to hell but you know what I'm going tell you something not wanting to go to hell is not enough to keep you amen amen it wasn't enough to keep me amen and and because even though I didn't want to go to hell I still had the my friends pulling me in certain directions and I want to kind of go in and so I want to just just be enough Christian like brother Jean was talk about just enough Christian where where I I can please my friends and please the people in the church come on somebody I live them kind of lives I live that kind of life and in the eighth grade I that life came to a screeching uh let me put it this way it came to a crossroads right CU in eth grade because I want to live these two lives praise God yeah I told I I to I I I I told my daddy cuz I knew in my household it was a little division oh y'all ain't going to

that if you're not I'mma just be broke until God provide me with a job that'll satisfy that amen they was warning the people to repent and I'm warning people today repent amen give all your heart to Christ amen amen let me keep going I got I got I got I got a lot but uh they they said this first they said uh uh God's Almighty power began to quck the people out of their chairs and off their feet under the power of the Holy Spirit a prophecy came forth of great destruction which was soon to come to the land the Saints began pleading with Sinners to repent for their ways of sin and choose to walk with God watch this now less than 10 days after that warning or after that prophecy there on the on on in the soua Street Revival less than 10 days after the warning the 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred so the Susan Street Revival happened in Los Angeles and there in San Francisco one of the worst earthquakes it was an earthquake and a fire that lasted three days Lord the prophecy went forth at ausa oh my god um I'm I'm here now so let me just touch this since I'm here there there's a prophecy sir that has gone forth right amongst the bride right right amen and and this prophecy causes us to see things a little deeper than what everybody else can I read the prophecy is it all right to I'll read two versions of the prophecy I want to it's on the back page from that time I'm just interjecting here and there uh while I'm talking about this third stage of restoration I'm trying to get on to the fourth but I got to just inject and draw some things here the prophecy went forth at Asuza that there was going to be this great um I mean there was going to be destruction and there there was a earthquake hit in San Francisco 1906 the same April 1906 that that that that that the Holy Spirit came also April 1906 a a a great destruction came to San Francisco hallelujah we're living under a prophecy look at this this was preached in 1960 uh July 16th says and so this I won't have time in the meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's Nation it's the number 13 so we're talking 1960 somebody tell me how many years ago was that y'all counted 64 is that right somebody put on your calculator some of y'all 64 thank you 64 years ago 64 the uh and and and now give me give me 1933 to 2024 give me that how many years is that come on come on brother count them up1 81 years 81 years ago is that right1 91 years ago God gives a prophecy 91 years ago 91 years ago right and here we are living under it watch this now I didn't see is that brother uh it's not brother Seth yes oh my y didn't tell me brother Seth was here God bless you good to see you my brother oh my okay 91 years ago and and now is when the prophecy came to brother brandom seven things that were supposed to happen before the coming of the Lord so the reason I'm telling you to repent because Jesus is coming soon right and we don't say that enough but but I mean really repent give God everything you got Jesus is coming soon look at what brother Brandon tells us he says I won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's Nation it's it's the number 13 it appears in 13th chapter Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything 13 everything is a woman now he's saying this in the 60s okay and remember thus saith the Lord there will be a woman rule praise God before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman can I just tell you thus far are two of those three have already occurred so let me tell you let me just put it this way no matter what the outcome of the election is this prophecy has already been fulfilled now if the outcoming election goes according to the first part of that then this is what I call a triple fulfillment of a prophecy and and and and and and and and I don't know what people um I don't know why people can't receive a prophet when when and I got something else I need to read oh Lord help me Jesus oh let me let me read this and I'm G read something else really quick let me let bear with me y'all bear with me there will be a woman woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or to be the Catholic church as a woman I've seen her a great woman the nation bow it'll be one before the end time thus sayeth the Lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it [Music] isn't I'm a false prophet can I just go back to acts just for a second yes sir just for a second then I want to come back and read the latery in church that prophecy latest the church age let's just go back to acts just just for a second I I I'm I'm I'm getting a few things all jumbled up here but I think we'll we'll we we'll get to where we're trying to go the first thing I want to say we stopped at verse 16 we stopped at verse 16 and um I'm I'm I'm going to just it said but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel what they were saying here in this little pamphlet this house on Bonnie Bray the address is 216 North Bonnie Bray and that's they said it has the same number as recorded in the book of Acts 26 and what happened at that house on Bonnie bre the Holy Spirit poured out at the address of 216 Bonnie br before they actually moov Amen to ausa Street uh but it started there at amen at the house and they say they found that they found themselves the address pointed to the scripture amen the other thing that happened because you know they they said that the people when I talked about mocking early they said uh there was a little little thing here uh where they said um several very Ardent newspaper reporters from the Los Angeles news media describ the building as a Tumbl down t Tumbl down Shack reporters began to flood the news media with uh voluminous derogatory stories about the group's activities one journalist wrote a new sect of Fanatics is breaking loose they make weird babbling sounds and here's the other thing they never dismiss Church don't no about get up and say you can leave no you leave whenever you want to leave you come when you want to come you leave when you want to leave I you talk about a Revival and people weren't complaining about oh when Pastor going to be done as they made more and more derogatory stories to try to dis they even had a a a a cartoon in here picking at people for their worship they put a cartoon in the newspaper just just picking at people about how they was worshiping in the baby and and speaking in tongues it I mean it was mocking a lot of mocking however the more they mocked the more people wanted to come that's right amen and it spread all over the world so let them mock I mean maybe somebody might mock this this series of sermon because like brother you trying to take us back to Pentecost no I'm taking you through no I ain't taking you back I'm taking you through like I'm taking you through justification and through sanctification through Pentecost all the way to the restoration of the word but all of this goes together yes it does these are the life Messengers now I just gave you a prophecy I want you to just let's read verse 17 it shall come to pass in the last days which saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dreams this is this is God's promise to us Peter picked it up on the day of Pentecost but remember the scripture said in the last days not last day it was pluralized so it's something that belongs to us amen so your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handm mates I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy mean you can't stop it right and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vape of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord uh um come and again all the blood moons and all these other things that we're seeing these are signs of the time and and and uh and verse verse 21 says and it shall come to pass that whosoever I don't care what condition you wi I don't care what sin you might have just committed whosoever brother Jack you don't know what I did last night it don't matter are you whosoever am you don't know what I did last week and last year I don't think God can forgive me whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen but the very next verse I just want to touch this just a little bit ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know now here Peter is bringing them amen back to the man Jesus and he's making it very clear that you all have seen his miracles you've seen the the the dead raised you've seen you've heard of the testimony of the feeding of the 5,000 feeding of the 4,000 I mean walking on water you've heard everything this man has been approved by God yet you reject him but this same Jesus is the one that God has raised up this is the one amen that we're telling you repent and turn from your we ways and start following Christ but but but when when Peter uses the language um I think okay we back we're back check the cameras it's all good you you want to know why this approved by God it's approved by God devil can't stop it right so so so so so what what I what I want to I want to say here is Peter brings them to the spot where it says Jesus a man approved by God can I go to some little history was Moses a man approved by God now no no I'm not talking about approved by man right but I'm talking about approved by God how you know whether the man is approved by God you see the supernatural following his ministry was Moses could could could Peter said was Moses a man approved by God he could have took them back Abraham a man approved by God Daniel a man approved by God the three Hebrew boys were men approved by God that's right Peter a man approved by God Paul a man approved by God Jesus now he could have said Jesus was God but he just said Jesus a man approved by God well can I come forward I just read you one prophecy and I told you two of the three have already come to pass we're living in the prophecy right now he said a woman would rise up and either be president vice president or the Catholic Church the Catholic churches all will never lose their position in the US we know that the Catholic Church dominates it we know that exactly they all over the scripture right so so so here when the prophet says that and we are living in a time where there is a woman vice president for the very first time in our history but you know it was a prophecy went forth before that occurred and now we're living in a time let me get this quote that I lat to see in church age we're living in a time where this could be a triple fulfillment of the prophecy he said president or vice president or the Catholic church and he said thus saith the Lord he said write it down I know some of us really get wrapped up in politics I don't no sir and the reason I don't is because politics has no salvation I don't care who they put in the office office and and what happens is that they they use that person's a figurehead just to promote certain agendas ex right and just more and more sin just get get pushed I mean and you see the parents crying out against the the the public school system on some of the stuff they teaching the kids in school saw a little video where a preacher had to go to stand before the counsel and he start reading out of the book that they were giv to the giving to the given to the um uh uh to the kids and they told stop please don't read no more stop stop he's like no you ashamed you you ashamed of me reading this don't let me keep reading all kind of Filth and stuff all over the he just know that a preacher reading he said he said he said if you're ashamed of me reading it here why you going to let my kids you going to vote to allow my kids to be taught this no repentance for the from the people but here the prophet tell us so here I want to tell y'all something I am not watching presidency right that's right I'm not watching presidency I already know I'm I'm reading tomorrow's newspaper today so I already know what's about to happen but I am watching prophecy now watch this prophecy yes sir right you know when a Souza Street hit the same month April 1906 is the same month that they had a catastrophic um uh uh earthquake in San Francisco now is there another earthquake prophesied about and just so it happened that this earthquake is supposed to happen where isza Street was the same city we 91 years away from these prophecies all right let me tell you another uh history thing about scripture when Jonah went into Nineveh and told them to repent um you know the city repented I mean it was such a repentance that even the animals boy that's something when you're Cat come to the altar your cat and your dog your horse everything repenting I you talking about a a massive repentance Lord but a 100 years later that city fell right back into sin a 100 years after Jonah went there 100 years later they fell back into s 91 years 91 years after the prophet speaks this almost 100 the auu street breaks out there in in Los Angeles California and here there's another prophecy to that we watching watch this and and look let me tell you something the the woman president vice president already been fulfilled I ain't even watching that no more but I am watching something else that comes after this watch this lat in in church AG he says then in the sixth Vision There Rose up in America he had seven visions of of uh that's supposed to happen before the coming of the Lord uh one of them was um a car shaped like a egg that could drive by itself y'all it's all over the newspaper the test Tesla got that Tesla already uh they already been um out west they have cabs that will pick you up and drive you wherever you want to go what they call it I don't I don't know but I know and and in there but but brother Quinton to tell you you can't trust that Tesla you jump in brother Quinton brother Quint and call this car to him come come come I'm over here come come pick me up he said while the car was coming it made a wrong turn and hit a park car glad he wasn't in it but we we trust all this this technology but let me tell you something most of and most time they'll tell you oh my they'll tell you well look the reason that that happened because you didn't get an update right that's right and and and here in church you're getting an update a spiritual update oh God let let's read this now the prophet said this to us then in the sixth Vision there arose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power how can she do that because she was the president I believe believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I know it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to due to a popular vote by women now let me just stop there just for a second Hillary Clinton fulfill that because she won the popular vote when when she went against President uh um Trump Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but you know um she didn't win the White House and uh but that opened up a door that when Camala Harris comes along and and and let me just let me let me just let me just read the quote the quote say um could possibly a vision of a woman rising in great power where did she come from any of y'all ever heard of it before you had never heard the name before but it just came out of nowhere when they chose her to be the vice president just came out but it was it was it was the right person to hit a right group of people that's right who's the right group of people how you got more women in in the US than you have and boy you should have saw the tears that were flowing we got a woman in in in in in power and just everybody just so Happ I'm telling you I'm not looking at presidency I'm looking at prophecy here's the next part to this prophecy that was the sixth Vision seventh one when we see this manifested now there's an and and I'm talking about a man approved of God sir in the last and seventh Vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters smoke no see this this not just stopping in San Francisco a three-day fire in San Francisco but according to our Prophet that actually saw a woman rising power 91 years ago our Prophet said that there was going to be debris craters and smoke all over the land of America if there ever was a time to repent that time is right now if there was ever time to live for God that time is right now and and let let me tell you something uh in the midst of all of these things occurring we we you see it in the natural you see it all I mean the election get ready to happen in weeks and when everybody come out and you know and they celebrate I mean you know you got kind of two two historic things about to happen one is we could have a female president that's historic first time ever but you know only the second time in history that a president has run won lost and then came back this will be the second time in our in our US history that that has happened two historical events right two that's right I'm not watching presidency and let me tell you tell you whether she won or didn't win the prophecy already fulfilled so I'm not going to be crying if it don't happen no what what what I need to prepare me for a Rapture I already seen it happen amen and I can get ready and now I'm living a life that if I call you you don't answer the phone I know ain't no Raptor took place cuz I'm here he ain't going without me I got that type of confidence in my relationship with God he's not going without me he's coming for me if he ain't coming for nobody else I know he's coming for me and I got one prayer I got one prayer it's the last Prayer in the Bible even [Applause] so come Lord Jesus church uh I don't even know where I know I I'm done I can't go no further I had um I I did want to talk about this former rine lat ring but I'll get there the the journey must continue um I'll stop there for the day I'll leave it just just like that let's pray father you have us on a journey and in this Lord we are able to reach back in history and see some of the the things that occurred and God look into modern events and see things that are occurring we can see father and also hear the spirit of God calling to us

total heart to you in full surrender that you would have the preeminence in our lives can still remember the day oh God where I came to a spot where I fully surrendered I was serious about what I wanted to do and in serving you and and God I didn't look back there was times that Satan might have want to take me back but Lord you you've kept me amen all these years and and I'm appreciative of your of your grace maybe I haven't done my part I know I haven't many of times I haven't done my part but yet Lord you have proven to be faithful God I pray that Hearts would would be soft and tender

you like that prodal son he he said father I wronged you the sins that I've done it's been against your word it's been against what the things that I was taught by my parents I've wronged you father I Repent I'm sorry father I pray that that Hearts would be sensitive enough Lord to hear the the voice of God not the voice of brother Jack but the voice of God as it would speak you're calling to your people you love them you care for them you realize it's only through repentance that as Peter told them on the day of Pentecost repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promises unto you to your children those that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call you've given us instruction

church mocking and um sometimes uh it may not be necessarily picking at but sometimes if you don't talk about things in the right manner it becomes like a little something people laughing that and all of that I want to warn the church please don't do that let's go rejoicing and thanking God for what he's done and uh and just leave all that other stuff cuz sometime the devil want to get into uh these things and we don't want him to get nothing we want God to get all the glory so let's go rejoice in what God has done amen amen amen God is good amen amen let's um if y'all brothers would just get the prayer music going for me uh we'll let the Saints be dismissed those that want to be dismissed um I would say you could sit and and and pray but I know in this Schoolhouse the brothers have to this assemble we taking this from the schoolhouse to our house our e [Music]
