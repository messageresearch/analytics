[1:01:50] you to that all right but uh but yeah
[1:01:53] you know whatever it whatever the Lord
[1:01:55] would lead you but please please go and
[1:01:56] be in fellowship a man on next week and
[1:02:00] you know there was something else that I
[1:02:01] had on my head to mention oh my choir we
[1:02:08] got to rehearse after service those that
[1:02:10] are be going to Indiana after service we
[1:02:15] need to go ahead and get finalize the
[1:02:17] songs that we're gonna be singing so
[1:02:18] please stick around amen at the service
[1:02:20] praise the Lord let's so let's get our
[1:02:23] Bibles and we'll read a scripture a man
[1:02:26] Todd is good to see you a man on today
[1:02:29] god bless you a man
[1:02:31] praise the Lord a man I want to read
[1:02:37] from Romans chapter 8 and we will just
[1:02:43] go there and then I have in my notes
[1:02:48] also to read from mark 6 but I'll just
[1:02:52] see how that how that goes
[1:02:55] man I made about this that should be
[1:02:57] seated when I read that but here in
[1:03:00] Romans chapter 8 starting at verse 11
[1:03:03] and and and if I could if I could just
[1:03:06] ask you to meditate
[1:03:12] concentrate on the word of the Lord that
[1:03:17] as it's being read to you and over you
[1:03:20] because Jesus is not just putting these
[1:03:23] things in Scripture just like a some
[1:03:26] other book right that we we could read
[1:03:29] but no this is uh you know he's trying
[1:03:32] to call us to a place right and and and
[1:03:36] and we have to just really stop and
[1:03:37] meditate just if I could just put it
[1:03:40] this way slow down slow down enjoy what
[1:03:45] God got for you right a man just just
[1:03:49] just relax a little bit unless let's
[1:03:51] just let's just enjoy Jesus a man but
[1:03:55] here in Romans 8 verse 11 says but if
[1:03:58] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:04:03] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:04:10] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:04:12] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:04:17] Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore
[1:04:21] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[1:04:24] to live after the flesh let me put that
[1:04:31] let me say that again you are in debt
[1:04:34] and your debt is not to live after the
[1:04:39] flesh come on somebody oh my one day
[1:04:44] we're gonna pay our debt but if you live
[1:04:50] after the flesh ye shall die but if ye
[1:04:54] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:05:00] of the flesh and that means that means
[1:05:03] mortify means put to death mine
[1:05:07] I wish I could preach that this morning
[1:05:09] but but mortify put to death
[1:05:15] the deeds of the body ye shall live a
[1:05:21] man Church right it's enough in there if
[1:05:26] I we can just take that one scripture
[1:05:28] just work with that hallelujah glory to
[1:05:33] God a man I'm trying to move on over to
[1:05:37] something else here but but you know we
[1:05:39] got to come to this that the church has
[1:05:42] got to come to this where you are dead
[1:05:45] to the things of the world Mayweather
[1:05:55] and McGregor will not be in heaven
[1:06:03] fightin a man Church mortify the deeds
[1:06:16] of the body ye shall live for as many as
[1:06:21] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[1:06:24] the sons of God but ye have not received
[1:06:28] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:06:33] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:06:35] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[1:06:40] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:06:42] that we are the children of God and if
[1:06:48] children then heirs of God and
[1:06:52] joint-heirs with Christ do you know that
[1:06:56] when you pray in the name of the Lord
[1:06:58] Jesus Christ is as if Jesus himself was
[1:07:01] praying right joint heirs with Christ if
[1:07:05] so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:07:07] may be also glorified together and look
[1:07:12] at this for I reckon a man I suppose
[1:07:17] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:07:21] whatever you're going through right now
[1:07:24] amen the sufferings of this present time
[1:07:26] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:07:31] glory which shall be revealed in us you
[1:07:37] got to go through some things you got to
[1:07:40] go through some suffering to get some
[1:07:42] glory do we understand that you you you
[1:07:46] have to go through suffering to get some
[1:07:49] glory and we want the glory but we don't
[1:07:54] want the suffering right but in order to
[1:07:57] get the glory you got to go through some
[1:07:59] suffering see our our topic today is
[1:08:02] pressure produces power pressure
[1:08:11] produces power a man for I reckon that
[1:08:16] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:08:18] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:08:22] which shall be revealed in us and this
[1:08:26] is verse 19 where I want to stop here
[1:08:27] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:08:32] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:08:35] of the sons of God a man the creatures
[1:08:41] are waiting for the sons of God to come
[1:08:43] back to where they belong a man and the
[1:08:47] only way we're gonna get there is by
[1:08:49] mortifying the deeds of this body a man
[1:08:53] that's that's what it's going to take
[1:08:54] let's have a word of Prayer and we'll
[1:08:58] let you be seated father we are grateful
[1:09:00] for the ability to read Scripture but
[1:09:07] our prayers that the Holy Ghost would
[1:09:09] make it clear to us God what it is that
[1:09:14] you have for us today we thank you for
[1:09:17] the anointing that has already been
[1:09:19] experienced in the sanctuary Lord just
[1:09:25] hearing the various songs and the
[1:09:27] worship the specials and God just you're
[1:09:31] anointed all over the place now we enter
[1:09:34] into the word and we trust that the Holy
[1:09:36] Ghost would have its way in Jesus name
[1:09:39] we take every spirit that's against the
[1:09:42] Spirit of God underneath the control of
[1:09:45] the Holy Ghost even right now in Jesus
[1:09:48] name we pray amen amen god bless you can
[1:09:51] be seated appreciate it I will I will
[1:10:00] try to be a little bit more I won't be
[1:10:03] so fast next time brother Nehemiah I'm
[1:10:05] sorry
[1:10:06] I appreciate that we want to take a man
[1:10:11] for our subject today pressure produces
[1:10:14] power and and we're still kind of in the
[1:10:18] channel of rapture and faith which which
[1:10:21] is what we preached on last week and you
[1:10:24] know just wanna you know just kind of
[1:10:28] build upon that if we can by the by the
[1:10:30] grace of God there was a statement made
[1:10:34] and I meant to just mention this and
[1:10:37] I'll go ahead and mention it now this is
[1:10:39] a prayer that was prayed by the prophet
[1:10:43] out of the message the Church of the
[1:10:44] Living God a man and he prayed this
[1:10:48] prayer and I want to just read this over
[1:10:50] sis it's just thank you our possible
[1:10:53] Lord I believe it's a shall we bow our
[1:10:56] heads
[1:10:57] SoDo Heavenly Father we thank thee
[1:10:59] tonight that we can sing that from the
[1:11:02] depths of our hearts Lord I believe a
[1:11:06] man and and and I think that's a song
[1:11:10] that we all sing but eventually that
[1:11:13] song has to become reality right not
[1:11:16] just I mean only believe Lord I received
[1:11:19] Lord I believe it has to become a
[1:11:21] reality to the bride because it says
[1:11:23] this it says from the from the depths of
[1:11:25] our heart Lord I believe and as the
[1:11:27] father with the with an epileptic son
[1:11:30] years ago said help thou my unbelief and
[1:11:35] I'm identified with that man because
[1:11:37] there are some things I know I
[1:11:39] believe but then I want God to help my
[1:11:41] unbelief right say we hear this question
[1:11:43] asked one day when he returns would he
[1:11:47] find faith right he never questioned
[1:11:51] whether he find righteousness or whether
[1:11:55] he find Christians but would he find
[1:11:58] faith a man when he returned knowing
[1:12:02] that that would be one thing people
[1:12:07] would let go on so the thing that people
[1:12:13] give up on is faith see we don't we
[1:12:18] don't reach this point we can reason
[1:12:20] this thing out real good right but but
[1:12:23] we don't understand that when we're
[1:12:24] reasoning we're actually Amen
[1:12:27] we're losing faith what one of the
[1:12:30] things that you shouldn't do it if you
[1:12:32] if you just can't see it say God help my
[1:12:34] unbelief
[1:12:35] right no I mean I mean I'm the closer up
[1:12:40] here right elevating us to live a bit
[1:12:43] but we live in way down here right so we
[1:12:46] ought to get to the boy look increase my
[1:12:48] faith they may help my unbelief because
[1:12:52] I'm missing something I'm the first one
[1:12:56] to say it
[1:12:56] I mean oftentimes I go through stuff to
[1:12:58] say what I'm missing something here I
[1:13:00] know what's supposed to happen but why
[1:13:03] does it not happen something is wrong
[1:13:04] with me and that rule of God not one
[1:13:08] thing wrong way if something is wrong
[1:13:10] with me
[1:13:10] and I'm gonna keep digging till I find
[1:13:13] out what is wrong with me cuz I'm gonna
[1:13:17] walk with God has ordained me the walk
[1:13:19] uncle God has ordained me to live I
[1:13:23] don't have all day
[1:13:28] man I'm not a defeated Christian I'm a
[1:13:32] Sun God and all creation is groaning
[1:13:36] related little manifestation of this son
[1:13:39] of God don't let go your face reasoning
[1:13:46] and all these other things we gotta cash
[1:13:48] down on reasoning cash to complete it
[1:13:52] down don't even consider it any more
[1:13:54] right if we gotta get it justice just
[1:13:57] truly only believe I just believe
[1:14:01] listen he goes on to save as you say uh
[1:14:04] he didn't he didn't either he never
[1:14:06] questioned whether he found
[1:14:07] righteousness and this is a prayer right
[1:14:09] you say maybe even never question where
[1:14:12] the final righteousness or whether he'd
[1:14:13] find Christians but when he find faith
[1:14:17] when he returned knowing that that would
[1:14:20] be the one thing people would let go on
[1:14:24] come on church if you got a sickness in
[1:14:29] your body and don't don't get me wrong I
[1:14:32] think there's two ways to hold on to
[1:14:34] this
[1:14:35] if you don't have enough faith just to
[1:14:37] catch it on your own then you ought to
[1:14:40] be asking for prayer the Bible of the
[1:14:43] Bible oh lord have mercy
[1:14:45] you know the bots in the Bible says any
[1:14:48] sick among you let him call for the
[1:14:51] elders of church of the church say they
[1:14:54] want to nort him with oil and and pray
[1:14:56] over him right and it said the prayer of
[1:14:59] faith right would heal the sick and the
[1:15:05] Lord will raise them up either we gonna
[1:15:07] believe God's Word are we not come on
[1:15:11] church he either is either even it's
[1:15:14] right or it's not right wewe got to at
[1:15:16] some point in time we got to take God at
[1:15:18] His Word glory to God Church hey man we
[1:15:21] gonna have to learn to take God at His
[1:15:22] Word let me let me just kind of keep
[1:15:24] moving here and I just believe every
[1:15:26] situation that's coming up in our lives
[1:15:27] is an opportunity for God to express
[1:15:30] these attributes they may he said he
[1:15:33] wants to express something he I mean
[1:15:37] it's time to just stop quoting
[1:15:42] we just quoted he the same yesterday
[1:15:45] today of em how you know how do you know
[1:15:53] he was saying yesterday the day of ever
[1:15:56] how can you tell me that we don't know
[1:16:05] we got to step into something here come
[1:16:08] on church because people let go their
[1:16:11] faith and that's why Jesus asks a
[1:16:14] question when the Son of man cometh will
[1:16:16] he find faith oh Lord I you know I got
[1:16:24] scriptures here that I think I just need
[1:16:25] to read because you know it you know we
[1:16:29] quote these things but it's time for the
[1:16:31] really said Alenia you know get D you
[1:16:35] know get what will he find faith glory
[1:16:38] to God look at it it says when he
[1:16:41] returns what he found things they never
[1:16:43] questioned whether he found
[1:16:44] righteousness of whether he'd find
[1:16:45] Christians but would he find faith when
[1:16:49] he returned knowing that that would be
[1:16:51] one thing would let go on oh god oh god
[1:16:57] oh god
[1:17:00] here's also the Holy Spirit speaking in
[1:17:03] the last days how that how these times
[1:17:06] would come man would have a form of
[1:17:08] godliness but with deny the power lack
[1:17:12] of faith and we thank the Lord tonight
[1:17:16] because that in ours we feel that we
[1:17:18] have just a little faith and help us
[1:17:22] Lord that that faith may be increased
[1:17:25] tonight and I'm gonna just put it in
[1:17:27] today let that face be increased today
[1:17:29] until it'll be so high so lost in
[1:17:34] complete surrendered in Christ until
[1:17:37] great and mighty works will be shown
[1:17:40] tonight or today right forgive us of our
[1:17:45] shortcomings now and help us may the
[1:17:48] Holy Spirit just now the great office of
[1:17:50] God
[1:17:52] here in the earth searching out for a
[1:17:53] bride for the Lord Jesus and may he
[1:17:56] tonight gives it every heart here in a
[1:17:58] special way before we ask you to the
[1:17:59] name of the beloved son of God Jesus
[1:18:02] Christ amen you can be seated
[1:18:05] alright now he puts that prayer out
[1:18:07] there and and I'm going to this next
[1:18:10] quote out of the mighty conquer y'all
[1:18:11] just bear with me here today church week
[1:18:15] we got to you know I believe God is
[1:18:18] doing something in this hour and I think
[1:18:20] like I'm reading the script we got to
[1:18:22] mortify the deeds of the flesh but the
[1:18:25] devil got away of just really messing us
[1:18:28] up he put everything in front of us
[1:18:31] before we get to church y'all think
[1:18:34] about what y'all sad there's a sadness
[1:18:36] look like everything the devil can throw
[1:18:38] at you he will throw at you before you
[1:18:40] get to church anything to get your mind
[1:18:44] off of what God getting ready to do and
[1:18:47] it's just this after this after this and
[1:18:49] you got to do this you got to do that
[1:18:51] it's just a devil amen
[1:18:54] glory to God I I believe when some of
[1:18:58] you know parents and everything were
[1:19:00] younger man there was I think that they
[1:19:03] quiet time y'all just y'all just young
[1:19:05] you know y'all just hearing that you
[1:19:06] know through voice of God but the
[1:19:09] parents they had them things early in
[1:19:12] their life they had quiet time right I
[1:19:14] mean they get their mind ready for
[1:19:16] church alright get they mind ready for
[1:19:19] church and and even even after after
[1:19:21] after service on a Sunday it one no I
[1:19:25] mean the fellowship was at home with

[1:20:18] come over and liberated them from under
[1:20:20] the Roman persecution and United the
[1:20:23] church and state together that there's
[1:20:25] where we got Catholic to begin with and
[1:20:27] when they died the church lost more
[1:20:30] grounds in ten years that it had gained
[1:20:32] all through the persecution if there's
[1:20:35] anything that makes Christians lazy it's
[1:20:41] when they're on a flower bed of ease see
[1:20:49] I mean you know and don't get me wrong
[1:20:51] we all want the blessing plan right we

[1:21:01] now when these these didn't met then
[1:21:04] what I'm gonna do I know money's gonna
[1:21:06] come and I must still stay in prayer so
[1:21:08] he can meet the needs at the next time
[1:21:10] but I want him I don't want him to give
[1:21:12] me this this grave above this then I
[1:21:14] stop playing and that's what happened if
[1:21:20] you got too much from God you'll stop
[1:21:22] playing play some of us get so blessed
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:28] right maybe as soon as you get a new car
[1:21:32] oh he'll help me somebody soon as God
[1:21:35] bless you and when you used to catch a
[1:21:37] ride you used to be on time but now that
[1:21:41] you got your own car you missing
[1:21:43] everything so much get to bless can I
[1:21:50] just put it that way you a to place all
[1:21:53] right if you don't know how to handle
[1:21:55] your blessings when you learn how to
[1:21:58] handle your blessings didn't God can
[1:22:00] give you more but see our some of our
[1:22:03] blessings take us away from God and let
[1:22:05] me tell you another thing
[1:22:06] do not ever don't ever but when you're
[1:22:14] praying and asking God for something
[1:22:15] it's not let's make a deal
[1:22:20] God if you just give me this then Lord
[1:22:25] I'm gonna do this you know if you bless
[1:22:28] me with this this this this $2,000 God
[1:22:31] I'm gonna pay my ties now why don't you
[1:22:34] pay your ties on your twenty dollars can
[1:22:38] see you you know i'ma tell you right now
[1:22:40] you won't paint eyes on your mm you
[1:22:42] can't pay on 20 it ain't gonna happen
[1:22:45] and for me I'm not looking for this
[1:22:49] overabundance thing like that because
[1:22:51] it's done cause laziness but when people
[1:22:54] struggling they're after the prey and
[1:22:55] they gotta break through a that's
[1:22:57] building their faith one time by the way
[1:23:01] brother brother brother branham have
[1:23:02] some meetings and and when he when he
[1:23:05] did the meetings there was a brother
[1:23:06] walked up say brother I'll take care of
[1:23:07] the whole thing you know I got it you
[1:23:09] even got to ask the people for an
[1:23:10] offering or nothing like that we got it
[1:23:13] you know the Lord blessed me said okay
[1:23:14] brother thank you we'll take that he
[1:23:15] said they went out they did the meze he
[1:23:17] said he was almost the worst meeting
[1:23:18] that he ever had say why every thought
[1:23:21] of expenses was paid everything else was
[1:23:24] ever happy to say he said no the people
[1:23:26] didn't have any part in it if they
[1:23:28] couldn't give out of their need then
[1:23:30] they couldn't get blessed and you
[1:23:37] looking for somebody else to bless you
[1:23:39] God wants to bless you once you give out
[1:23:42] of your knees see that's a challenge to
[1:23:47] your faith what the devil's doing is
[1:23:50] weakening your faith by sending somebody
[1:23:52] to bless you with all that but when you
[1:23:55] have to you have to exercise your faith
[1:23:59] it changes the whole situation so you
[1:24:05] got it but you got it you gotta be
[1:24:07] involved you gather you got the field
[1:24:08] attention I'm getting there cuz run
[1:24:12] around say attention is good for us you
[1:24:14] got I mean you gotta be pull from here
[1:24:16] to there because when you can pull this
[1:24:19] stretches you
[1:24:22] right make it make you Frank a little
[1:24:25] bit more how your son must give in and
[1:24:29] in a place of tension right now we don't
[1:24:31] know how we don't do this how're we
[1:24:32] gonna do that that's a good place to be
[1:24:35] because God will lead you what you
[1:24:38] should do what you shouldn't do and we
[1:24:40] need your the Spirit of God they are the
[1:24:46] sons of God so you gotta thank God for
[1:24:49] your attention thank God for the stress
[1:24:54] thank God pull the string the stress is
[1:24:58] not here to cause a distress but the
[1:25:01] stress is here to give you victory you
[1:25:08] need tension it stretches you even as a
[1:25:12] son of God it makes you think about
[1:25:13] things that you you wouldn't have
[1:25:15] thought about if you didn't have the
[1:25:17] tension if you didn't have the pressure
[1:25:23] the pressure pushes you into a place
[1:25:26] that you would have never gone into had
[1:25:30] you not had rush I the pressure pulls
[1:25:38] things out of you that you've been even
[1:25:41] know was inside of you you gotta have
[1:25:46] some crush on church see I don't want to
[1:25:54] be a lazy Christian right you you'd be
[1:25:57] surprised that you know what comes out
[1:25:59] when you know when a person under
[1:26:01] pressure brother branham said that
[1:26:02] that's that's how you can that's how you
[1:26:04] can tell who a person really is I mean
[1:26:08] you know week we go home I but we walk
[1:26:11] around and we you know praise God glory
[1:26:15] smiling grinning got my new suit got my
[1:26:19] new dress got my new shoes I mean you're
[1:26:22] looking good you're looking real good
[1:26:24] but when the pressure come right went
[1:26:28] went went through it and let me let me
[1:26:29] just let me just you know just try to
[1:26:31] clarify there there's too
[1:26:33] it's a stress and one is what we call
[1:26:38] the positive stress and one is a
[1:26:39] negative stress see when we're dealing
[1:26:42] with negative stress amen that's called
[1:26:44] distress right and it's something that
[1:26:48] will always lead you to a negative
[1:26:50] outcome but then you got positive stress
[1:26:53] which will always lead to a positive
[1:26:55] outcome now just bear with me here today
[1:26:57] for a little bit you know I mean
[1:26:59] sometimes God puts us in situations
[1:27:01] where it's positive stress it is
[1:27:05] stressful but it's positive let me give
[1:27:09] you an example where Moses got to the
[1:27:11] Red Sea it was a lot of pressure on
[1:27:14] Moses right Moses got to carry these
[1:27:17] people across this recipe but why he'd
[1:27:19] given it you know a faithful especially
[1:27:21] like a donkey can't figure out how I'm
[1:27:23] gonna get through this
[1:27:24] some of y'all faces some red seas this
[1:27:27] morning you're trying to figure out how
[1:27:29] you gonna get through this in your
[1:27:30] health you forgot how you gonna get
[1:27:33] through this and your finances you're
[1:27:34] trying to figure out how you gonna get
[1:27:36] through this in your emotions you trying
[1:27:38] to figure out you later and see Moses
[1:27:43] got pressure ain't mad from from his own
[1:27:45] people that what we go through that
[1:27:47] almost despising leaders half this way
[1:27:49] and why they sending that here come
[1:27:51] Pharaoh's army behind all that oh my
[1:27:55] lord my lord but I just love God and
[1:28:00] when I was in Tucson I told him say see
[1:28:02] when when you get to a stressful spot
[1:28:05] like that you need to understand God
[1:28:07] always got something up his sleeve let's
[1:28:12] see when God when you got something up
[1:28:13] your sleeve
[1:28:13] you ain't showed this to nobody they
[1:28:17] ain't never seen this one before
[1:28:19] ain't nobody ever you heard this one
[1:28:22] before and what God decides to do saying
[1:28:25] that not Moses man I told you what to do
[1:28:27] with the people now I see the obstacle
[1:28:29] but I ain't changed ain't changed my my
[1:28:31] mind just because you got an obstacle Oh
[1:28:32] y'all preach with me I'm not changing my
[1:28:36] mind because you got options I still
[1:28:37] gave you a task getting people to the
[1:28:39] other side take them take them take them
[1:28:42] so they can work get them to the
[1:28:43] promised land Mona Dukie you you just do
[1:28:45] whatever you got to do to make it
[1:28:46] see it had he not been in this stressful
[1:28:49] situation
[1:28:50] then the words that Moses spoke at that
[1:28:53] time we would have never heard but it
[1:28:58] was because of stress right the pressure
[1:29:02] produced a certain amount of power and
[1:29:06] what will the sense a dejection they
[1:29:08] could think that's all they can seize
[1:29:09] Egyptians right now Moses we bout to die
[1:29:12] and then maybe we pressed up against the
[1:29:15] sea we got a just behind us we don't
[1:29:17] know whether do we bother died or
[1:29:19] guardian so for that nothing never been
[1:29:21] done before he put the pillow fire in
[1:29:23] between the Gyptians and digital doom is
[1:29:26] rim cause darkness over here but
[1:29:29] lighting over here but he stood at stop
[1:29:33] dancing that Moses I told you Jordan
[1:29:35] take them overnight you figured out way
[1:29:36] more the same oh and now brother Adam
[1:29:38] said God did not even tell Moses to say
[1:29:41] this and this is this is I need you to
[1:29:43] get this because of some things God
[1:29:46] ain't gonna tell you to say it's gonna
[1:29:51] come by inspiration you ain't gon you
[1:29:55] you can't you ain't gonna be able to
[1:29:56] point then nobody say they did this not
[1:29:58] this gonna be something unique to you
[1:30:05] it's gonna be unique to you but but the
[1:30:11] pressure that you're under is gonna
[1:30:13] produce a certain power that you didn't
[1:30:16] even realize was there can I can I just
[1:30:21] let me just take it take a little bit
[1:30:23] more time Moses mighta forgot just like
[1:30:28] we forget he was a God is that in the
[1:30:36] Bible is that in the Bible he don't say
[1:30:41] say you be a god and let Aaron be your
[1:30:44] prophet
[1:30:45] [Applause]
[1:30:47] so when have you ever found God worrying
[1:30:51] about how things gonna work out show me
[1:30:57] in the scripture where God ever trying
[1:30:59] to sit there and figure out how this
[1:31:00] gonna happen I got I never did that God
[1:31:02] has always been in control and if God is
[1:31:06] dwelling inside of you you will also be
[1:31:12] in control not frustrated and flustered
[1:31:15] that's not how Kings act Moses Moses
[1:31:22] sits there underneath all this pressure
[1:31:25] man I got I got 2 million people that I
[1:31:28] got to get across this Red Sea
[1:31:29] I got Pharaoh's army behind me and I
[1:31:32] don't know what I'm getting ready to do
[1:31:33] Samos mountain you'd better figure out
[1:31:35] what you're gonna do and Moses by
[1:31:37] inspiration just says he's work says the
[1:31:39] Egyptians that should have seen today
[1:31:43] you'll see him no more forever he spoke
[1:31:45] that by inspiration God never even told
[1:31:47] me saying and then immediately after he
[1:31:52] said that he said Lord what what am I
[1:31:57] supposed to do now - Baba don't say that
[1:32:01] but brother Brandon picks that up
[1:32:03] because if you look at Exodus 14 he's
[1:32:06] sending Egyptians that you see the day
[1:32:07] 14 14 is just we just see today you'll
[1:32:09] see no more forever that's X is 14 14
[1:32:11] but then in Exodus 14 15 he says
[1:32:14] speaking to the people and move forward
[1:32:16] now why I've got telling Moses to
[1:32:18] speaking to the people Moses evidently
[1:32:20] allows some doubt to ante in between
[1:32:25] verse 14 and verse 15 and some of y'all
[1:32:29] in between
[1:32:33] send me all in between verse 14 and
[1:32:36] verse 15 but the good news is that you
[1:32:40] gonna get the verse 15 and then I'm
[1:32:43] hoping yo mom is gonna sleep and when he
[1:32:51] spoke he put that back that that rod out
[1:32:54] stretch to ride out the sea began the
[1:32:56] part see that the pressure produce the
[1:33:00] power and when the sea began the part
[1:33:03] here he come walking through and then
[1:33:04] two million people come walking right
[1:33:06] behind me but that wasn't it then he
[1:33:11] then he took the pillar far away so that
[1:33:14] the Egyptians now they can see what
[1:33:16] happens there now we don't go in there
[1:33:17] after him and here seat not now when
[1:33:20] they when they come running in behind
[1:33:22] more than I love y'all y'all thought
[1:33:23] y'all did something we gonna get y'all
[1:33:24] we got horses y'all on foot we got
[1:33:26] horses we gonna get and as they come
[1:33:28] right in there the water close up on
[1:33:31] them
[1:33:31] you want to know why I don't water
[1:33:32] closed up because there was a God that
[1:33:38] spoke these Gyptians that you seen the
[1:33:43] day you will see no more forever so the
[1:33:49] Word of God could not fall to the ground
[1:33:50] in return boy but it had to count the
[1:33:53] very purpose in which it was sent if
[1:34:01] that was in Moses Church I'm trying to
[1:34:03] get you to see that is inside of you
[1:34:04] right when you when you leave here yo
[1:34:07] y'all just can't keep going back to work
[1:34:08] and acting like everybody else you're
[1:34:13] you're not then you're not then you're
[1:34:16] not of them you you you you don't you
[1:34:19] don't come from them don't let them
[1:34:20] people anoint you with their spirit
[1:34:26] you you you're a citizen of another
[1:34:29] Kingdom do you respond to things
[1:34:33] differently you actually create an
[1:34:35] environment you're you're a minute to
[1:34:38] create or if there's anything that makes
[1:34:48] a Christian lazy it's been there on the
[1:34:51] flowery bed of these flower bed obese
[1:34:55] listeners he says and I'm back at this
[1:34:57] he says we don't we don't have it
[1:35:00] persecution enough and if I can just
[1:35:04] reword that you don't have enough
[1:35:05] persecution now you might say I got too
[1:35:09] much no the Prophet said you ain't got
[1:35:10] enough you know why because you had more
[1:35:13] in it you'd be praying every day of the
[1:35:15] week I'll tell you I'm gonna be honest
[1:35:20] I'm be honest I find that I really can
[1:35:23] get a break today when I'm going through
[1:35:27] something all of sudden ain't tired when
[1:35:30] I want to pray come on somebody
[1:35:34] well you don't get tired now I mean you
[1:35:37] you gotta reach you you put your phone
[1:35:42] down you you won't let people distract
[1:35:47] you look I got a rich guy I got a
[1:35:49] situation that only God can handle
[1:35:54] that's why we need the persecution so so
[1:35:57] so you know this this is why you got a
[1:35:59] welcome tension the tension is actually
[1:36:01] the pressure that's going to produce
[1:36:03] power
[1:36:05] listen says if there's anything that
[1:36:07] makes Christian lazy its when they're on
[1:36:10] a flower bed of ease we don't have it
[1:36:11] persecution enough we don't have it hard
[1:36:13] enough always at the chain is the
[1:36:16] strongest at its weakest link a man and
[1:36:20] a man under pressure is what he is when
[1:36:22] he's under pressure his true
[1:36:26] characteristics will show when he's
[1:36:28] under pressure get him all riled up and
[1:36:32] then you'll see the real man come out if
[1:36:35] he's got a temper it'll show it
[1:36:40] if he's a meek and gentle it'll show
[1:36:43] itself
[1:36:44] put him under pressure once and God puts
[1:36:48] all his children I want y'all to get
[1:36:50] that God puts oh you thought the devil
[1:36:53] is bringing that and you just rear
[1:36:58] Buchanon up well I think sometimes even
[1:37:01] I ain't even do nothing
[1:37:03] you didn't even give me permission to do
[1:37:05] nothing I ain't touching they still
[1:37:06] blaming me everything from the devil
[1:37:09] look at this God puts all his children
[1:37:12] under test to see whether there's any
[1:37:15] flaws and then well I tell you what
[1:37:23] we're gonna give a devil mind better
[1:37:24] when we start praising God for our
[1:37:26] trials all right he kept on going to say
[1:37:32] here not long ago during the the great
[1:37:35] deal of depression it was easy to find
[1:37:37] people at a prayer meeting but now they
[1:37:41] can work in the defense plants and the
[1:37:43] union gives them so much money that they
[1:37:45] hardly know what to do with you have to
[1:37:49] almost persuade them to a meeting

[1:39:46] to substitute something else for the
[1:39:49] gospel
[1:39:50] I'll close the Bible and go home right
[1:39:55] when the precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:57] reached in its power don't attract the
[1:40:00] people there Dan he says but we got too
[1:40:04] many televisions and too many radio
[1:40:07] programs and entertainments a Christian
[1:40:11] wants to be entertained by the Holy
[1:40:12] Spirit and too much war has leaked into
[1:40:16] the church and they have substituted
[1:40:18] entertainment in the stand of gospel
[1:40:21] preaching the old fashioned gospel that
[1:40:24] saved your father and mother is just as
[1:40:26] good tonight as it was in that day and
[1:40:29] always will be it is still the same
[1:40:32] thrill did I'll get that the preacher
[1:40:36] the gospel will give you a three glory
[1:40:41] to God I don't know if you ever felt
[1:40:42] that before but sometime you're just
[1:40:44] sitting there listening to the word you
[1:40:45] can be in church you can be at home
[1:40:46] listening to the tape in your car all of
[1:40:48] a sudden the revelation just come from
[1:40:50] heaven and might just give you a thrill
[1:40:52] and just give you a charge I was just
[1:40:55] listening to the radio yesterday I
[1:40:57] listened to the sermon said I hadn't
[1:40:59] listened to it in a while we preached
[1:41:00] that sermon three or four years ago but
[1:41:01] but as I'm listening I'm like man I feel
[1:41:13] some time as a preacher you don't know
[1:41:15] what you stand so you have to go back
[1:41:16] and listen to it and it inspires you the
[1:41:20] Word of God always inspire you listen to
[1:41:27] what I say here says they have
[1:41:29] substituted entertainment instead of
[1:41:31] gospel preaching old-fashioned gospel
[1:41:33] that saved your father mother's just as
[1:41:35] good tonight as it was and that day it
[1:41:37] always will be of still it's still the
[1:41:39] same thrill to the Christian heart as it
[1:41:41] was in st. Paul who sealed his testimony
[1:41:43] with his blood I'll stop right there on
[1:41:46] that particular quote
[1:41:48] see tension is something that's that's
[1:41:50] needed the brother branham
[1:41:52] made a couple statements and united time
[1:41:54] of silent won't read that whole quote
[1:41:56] but I'll just give you a few statements
[1:41:57] that he made this attention is a part of
[1:42:00] living it says when you know when that
[1:42:03] struck him so that kind of encouragement
[1:42:06] when I thought of that right if you had
[1:42:08] no tension you'd be like a rag doll and
[1:42:10] you had you wouldn't have no feelings
[1:42:13] there'd be nothing you could work on
[1:42:16] right say tension brings you closer
[1:42:19] together you talk about even a husband
[1:42:21] and wife they have tension but the
[1:42:23] tension actually brings them closer
[1:42:25] together right it says you say some
[1:42:28] people try to introduce Christianity
[1:42:30] that you're free from worry no you're
[1:42:33] not
[1:42:33] say you're try to say you're free from
[1:42:35] tension no you add tension when you
[1:42:39] become a Christian now why why would you
[1:42:41] add tension because God is trying to get
[1:42:45] from you what he put in you and it's
[1:42:49] only through the tension through the
[1:42:51] pressure that the power can be
[1:42:53] demonstrated he said after all attention
[1:42:58] is a blessing that's why the Bible say
[1:43:01] count it all joy right count it all joy
[1:43:04] now let's let's just pick up a scripture
[1:43:06] here you know whatever whatever is
[1:43:07] trying you you just count it all joy I
[1:43:11] give me a just give me a second here I'm
[1:43:14] gonna go to two mark six in a second
[1:43:20] just give me just give me a little bit
[1:43:21] more time I want to want to just kind of
[1:43:24] drop into a few things here give me just
[1:43:30] let me make a few more comments here
[1:43:32] just uh and I'll get to mark six in a
[1:43:36] second and we'll read from there we're
[1:43:38] talk about this tension now brother
[1:43:40] Branham was saying here we really you
[1:43:44] know we all have this I would say
[1:43:46] personal individual attention we have
[1:43:48] trials and tribulations that we all go
[1:43:50] through that's a part of life we should
[1:43:51] expect that but as a church at the body
[1:43:57] of Christ as a whole will also have some
[1:43:59] tensions that they would actually endure
[1:44:01] right and one of the things that he said
[1:44:05] in services this time and said the seven
[1:44:06] thunders would give the church rapture
[1:44:09] and faith right and what the seven
[1:44:11] thunders is it's the mysteries that were
[1:44:12] contained in the seven seals right
[1:44:15] that's what the Prophet taught us the
[1:44:16] thunders were the mysteries that were
[1:44:18] contained in the seven seals and you say
[1:44:20] the thunders is what's going to give the
[1:44:22] church rapture and faith right the
[1:44:24] revelation of the word is what's going
[1:44:26] to give the church rapture and faith
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:29] he also sent this and the message look
[1:44:30] away to Jesus said the third pool would
[1:44:33] start the rapture in faith right and and
[1:44:37] and and in other places he told us that
[1:44:38] the third pool was the opening of the
[1:44:40] word so if the third pool is open the
[1:44:43] word we feet not that worth that's
[1:44:44] what's gonna give us the wrapped rain
[1:44:47] thing and we go back to that statement
[1:44:48] that brother Branham said I represent
[1:44:50] that faith so we want to hear what the
[1:44:52] Prophet has got to say if he's the one
[1:44:54] representing that faith that was once
[1:44:56] delivered to the Saints
[1:44:58] now in this message look away to Jesus
[1:45:01] just a quick quote here this is a pair
[1:45:05] of
[1:45:05] thirty-eight it says so now I am going
[1:45:09] to say something to you now that I
[1:45:11] haven't said all along and that is the
[1:45:13] thing that we have looked for for it to
[1:45:15] for so long for it for at least many
[1:45:17] years four or five years or maybe longer
[1:45:19] the third pool has now been vindicated
[1:45:22] and and I'm sure you all know what it is
[1:45:25] and I remember there will never be an
[1:45:28] impersonation of that because it can't
[1:45:30] be see it cannot be now it's in existent
[1:45:34] and I have I am warned of this that soon
[1:45:37] right at this time now it's just
[1:45:39] happening so it could identify its
[1:45:41] presence among you see but it will not
[1:45:43] be used in a great way
[1:45:46] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:45:49] and when it does when that does the
[1:45:53] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[1:45:55] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:45:58] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:46:01] comes down then you'll see what you've
[1:46:05] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[1:46:08] fullness of its power see see see see
[1:46:15] now when we just think about that
[1:46:17] because you know again I can go all
[1:46:19] through the prophets ministry and when
[1:46:24] we you know I think there was different
[1:46:25] times in his ministry where the pressure
[1:46:28] produced power there were stairs
[1:46:32] multiple times that we could just go to
[1:46:34] a multiple testimonies that he shared
[1:46:36] with us where where pressure produced a
[1:46:38] certain amount of power one of those was
[1:46:41] when he was when he found himself in his
[1:46:43] car and and remember when we talked
[1:46:46] about this type of power is controlled
[1:46:48] by motive and objective don't ever
[1:46:50] forget that
[1:46:50] right it's just it's not something you
[1:46:53] just do just because you want to do you
[1:46:55] don't go to the hospital try to get
[1:46:56] everybody at the hospital it might be
[1:46:59] one person that you need to see come on
[1:47:02] right that's what Jesus did and in John
[1:47:05] 5 he went went down to the pool and and
[1:47:07] there was only one man that he went to
[1:47:08] see he left everybody else there so you
[1:47:11] know this pressure produces pounds
[1:47:13] brother Brandon was was was out riding
[1:47:15] his car and he remembered
[1:47:17] Robin's gonna say there's a shape that
[1:47:19] lives across this field I gotta go with
[1:47:21] and pray for them they they meet prayer
[1:47:23] you say they're sick they need prayer
[1:47:24] and I got to get out and I got to go
[1:47:26] over there
[1:47:26] so he just jumped out his calm not
[1:47:28] thinking went run across the field to go
[1:47:30] pray for the saint but as he crossed the
[1:47:32] field he got to a little spot in the
[1:47:36] field and all we heard was and it hit
[1:47:43] him it was a killer bull sitting there
[1:47:46] and he said Oh Lord he said he's the
[1:47:48] first thing the Prophet did not eat you
[1:47:50] got to understand he's the first thing
[1:47:52] he did is reach for his gun and when he
[1:47:57] realized that man I ain't got my gun I
[1:47:59] ain't got my gun say nada
[1:48:01] I didn't heard the testimony see whose
[1:48:04] report you're gonna believe I haven't
[1:48:06] heard your testimony that the last man
[1:48:08] that crossed the path of this bull he
[1:48:10] didn't live to tell about it
[1:48:12] but he said I got to go pray for the
[1:48:14] same over here and say you know I I
[1:48:16] didn't I don't have my gun I can't shoot
[1:48:19] this animal I don't you say he say he
[1:48:21] say all I'm saying just kind of fell the
[1:48:22] love come over and he began to just talk
[1:48:26] to the bull he say say mr. bull I'm
[1:48:27] sorry what
[1:48:29] I'm sorry mr. bull this is your
[1:48:32] territory and I crossed your territory I
[1:48:35] am so sorry but I'm going over here to
[1:48:37] pray for one of God's sick joke it's
[1:48:39] said mr. bull
[1:48:40] just turn around and go back and lay
[1:48:42] down in the name of Jesus I'm sorry said
[1:48:44] that bull start and start charging got
[1:48:47] with him just a couple feet of them turn
[1:48:49] around and win and lay down that
[1:48:54] pressure produced a power one time he
[1:49:00] got cutting grass and while he cutting
[1:49:03] grass see you know he's he's going
[1:49:05] getting a little bit too close to the
[1:49:06] fence
[1:49:07] and he got a little bit too closer and
[1:49:09] he hit the fence and all of a sudden
[1:49:10] there was some killer bees they had a
[1:49:12] hive right there and said that when they
[1:49:15] come out they just start swirling I'm
[1:49:17] nest without hive who is it and here
[1:49:19] they come looking for the Prophet
[1:49:21] just all I'm just come around he was
[1:49:23] getting ready to die had no shirt on
[1:49:25] right Gary I mean he was get rid of that
[1:49:28] but he looked at the bee say I'm
[1:49:30] that I interrupted job y'all just go
[1:49:33] right back to y'all behave I'm sorry
[1:49:34] talk to the bees
[1:49:36] you know the bees did circle them and
[1:49:39] went right back inside they have the
[1:49:41] pressure of getting ready to die but a
[1:49:45] bite of some bees produced power I want
[1:49:53] you to understand something you might
[1:49:55] find yourself it's a very difficult
[1:50:00] circumstances when brother Branham was
[1:50:02] sharing those testimonies that one just
[1:50:04] so that we can say brother Branham did
[1:50:05] this in brother Branham did that that's
[1:50:07] all you know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:50:09] same yesterday today forever and he will
[1:50:11] do the same for you if you will let him
[1:50:17] as many of our situations brother
[1:50:20] branham found himself in the middle at
[1:50:21] Colorado storm and had you know while he
[1:50:26] was there he just heard that the voice
[1:50:27] of the Lord just you know pretty much
[1:50:29] tell him saying I'll turn and go back
[1:50:31] into the storm he said lord I I'll die
[1:50:34] now turn go back into see when God told
[1:50:37] him to do that God knew exactly why he
[1:50:39] told him to do that and when he got up
[1:50:41] there sighs no storms I love what what
[1:50:43] you want me to say speak to the storm
[1:50:47] they say you say what's gonna happen not
[1:50:49] not God saying you tell the storm what's
[1:50:51] supposed to happen
[1:50:52] say this is a said storm I want you to
[1:50:54] go back and I want the Sun to come
[1:50:56] shining for four days say people in the
[1:50:59] city when they got down there they say
[1:51:01] that a storm was coming we and we was
[1:51:03] waiting on the storm and then it seemed
[1:51:05] like it started then just stop just like
[1:51:06] that we don't know what happened brother
[1:51:08] Branham knew what happened but you know
[1:51:09] what he didn't tell them what was the
[1:51:16] use o you now you know why that storm
[1:51:19] stopped you'll know you'll know well let
[1:51:24] me tell you that's not that that's the
[1:51:28] wrong motive and the wrong objective if
[1:51:31] they didn't know they just didn't know
[1:51:34] so yeah I'm gonna tell you how cuz there
[1:51:37] was a time when you before brother
[1:51:38] Branham preached American divorce you
[1:51:40] know we were just there me and brother
[1:51:42] Steven we was looking at finger Rock and
[1:51:44] now you know the the pillar fire was
[1:51:46] going up and down the rock people can
[1:51:48] see it just up and down the rock so we
[1:51:50] we we took a picture of the gas station
[1:51:52] where brother Ronnie was was was working
[1:51:54] right and brother Ronnie say brother
[1:51:56] branham use up in that mountain when you
[1:51:58] say no no no I went up there say yes you
[1:52:01] was I know you was up there say what
[1:52:03] what you talked about brother Ronnie say
[1:52:04] we could see the glory of God that's
[1:52:05] going up and down the mountain up and
[1:52:07] down see tonight the man you can shake
[1:52:09] him he knew what was going on there
[1:52:11] now bring brother branham I might not
[1:52:13] have told him everything God told him
[1:52:14] but he knew the Prophet had been in that
[1:52:16] spot brother branham can deny it the
[1:52:20] glory God showed it see if you know if
[1:52:22] people don't if they kind of get some
[1:52:24] inkling fine but if they don't know
[1:52:26] nothing just let it be
[1:52:28] my brother Brandon spoke to that storm
[1:52:30] that pressure that he was under produced
[1:52:33] a power and let's look at a scripture
[1:52:37] here and and and and and Mark chapter 6
[1:52:41] if you all just bear with me you're
[1:52:46] gonna find yourself in some situations
[1:52:49] of pressure but that's not to make you
[1:52:51] cave-in that's actually to bring
[1:52:54] something out of you that you didn't
[1:52:55] realize was there oh let's let's pick
[1:53:02] this story up here in mark chapter 6 and
[1:53:04] I'm gonna read from verse verse 30 glory
[1:53:13] to God now it says and the pastas
[1:53:19] gathered themselves together unto Jesus
[1:53:22] and told him all things both what they
[1:53:26] had done and what they had told now this
[1:53:30] this is kind of important here as we as
[1:53:31] we go through this this story that we're
[1:53:33] about to read you will find this one
[1:53:36] story is probably the only story that is
[1:53:38] found in all four Gospels right Matthew
[1:53:41] Mark Luke and John this this this
[1:53:44] miracle that occurred here this is the
[1:53:46] only one that I found this recorded in
[1:53:48] all four Gospels right but here you know
[1:53:51] we want it we wanted to try to catch
[1:53:53] something so here the disciples in verse
[1:53:55] 30 says in the
[1:53:56] the apostle's gathered themselves
[1:53:58] together to Jesus and told him all
[1:54:00] things both what they had done and what
[1:54:03] they had talked and he said unto them
[1:54:05] come ye yourselves apart into a desert
[1:54:07] place and rest awhile but there were
[1:54:09] many coming
[1:54:11] there were many comment and going and
[1:54:13] they had no leisure so much as to eat
[1:54:15] now just so you get a little bit more
[1:54:18] clarity on what they were shared and
[1:54:20] over in Luke 9 you found the same story
[1:54:22] but in Luke 9 it kind of tells us that
[1:54:24] Jesus that given the disciples power
[1:54:26] over unclean spirits to cast out devils
[1:54:29] and do all these other things you know
[1:54:31] what you got that same power right now
[1:54:33] right so he gave him this power and and
[1:54:36] they were out exercising the power and
[1:54:38] authority that Jesus had given them and
[1:54:40] as they were exercising in that you know
[1:54:42] now they're coming back and giving their
[1:54:44] praise reports and they're just sharing
[1:54:46] this with Jesus and and the first thing
[1:54:48] Jesus say to them is like you know okay
[1:54:49] let's let's come aside let's get this he
[1:54:52] said come give yourselves apart into a
[1:54:54] desert place I want you to catch this he
[1:54:58] calls them apart but he takes them into
[1:55:00] a desert place where nothing is really
[1:55:02] happening I mean you ain't gonna find
[1:55:04] too much going on in the desert right in
[1:55:06] a desert place and then he tells them
[1:55:08] their rest a while listen let's watch
[1:55:12] this let's watch this rest a while
[1:55:13] hallelujah can you I just want you to
[1:55:15] follow here they tell him Jesus all
[1:55:17] these good things that's happening and
[1:55:19] in the midst everybody said now come and
[1:55:21] rest in this desert place come come and
[1:55:24] just just just rest the wild in this
[1:55:26] desert place follow the story it says
[1:55:29] verse 32 and they departed into a desert
[1:55:32] place by ship privately and the people
[1:55:36] saw them departing and many knew him and
[1:55:39] ran a foot with her out of all cities
[1:55:42] and out with them and came together unto
[1:55:46] Him so pretty much these people arrived
[1:55:48] before Jesus arrived they knew where he
[1:55:49] was going and they got there before he
[1:55:51] got there
[1:55:52] oh I wish we had folk that would follow
[1:55:54] Jesus like that today says and Jesus
[1:55:57] when he came out saw much people and was
[1:56:00] moved with compassion toward them
[1:56:02] because they were as sheep not having a
[1:56:04] shepherd and he began to teach them many
[1:56:06] things and when when the day was
[1:56:09] now far spent his disciples came unto
[1:56:14] him and said this is a desert place
[1:56:17] another time is far past now now
[1:56:20] remember Jesus invited them to this
[1:56:23] place Jesus is the one that suggested
[1:56:25] that they go to this desert place oh I
[1:56:29] wish that was with me right
[1:56:31] Jesus is the one that that that arranged
[1:56:34] this Jesus already knew that it'll be no
[1:56:39] restaurants in the desert place Jesus
[1:56:44] already knew that you know and I mean
[1:56:46] they were have nothing to eat when they
[1:56:49] got to the desert place Jesus knew have
[1:56:52] been no animals for them to even start a
[1:56:54] barbecue with in the desert place Jesus
[1:56:58] knew that it would be an empty place
[1:57:00] when they got to the desert place but
[1:57:03] yet he invited them after they shared
[1:57:06] all their testimonies I want you to see
[1:57:10] that even you know I don't know I know
[1:57:12] God's done some great things for you but
[1:57:15] he got some more that he want to do with
[1:57:17] you and every time he put you in a
[1:57:20] stressful situation it's a time for you
[1:57:24] to remember and reflect on what he's
[1:57:27] already done don't you complain don't
[1:57:31] you why you speak and you keep moving
[1:57:35] forward because if God did it before he
[1:57:39] will do it again I could just imagine as
[1:57:46] the Sun was just setting maybe maybe
[1:57:52] somebody you know one disciples maybe
[1:57:55] Judas is the first one to us in there
[1:57:57] you know we got to get these people out
[1:57:58] of here they come a long way they then
[1:58:00] got nothing to eat we in this desert
[1:58:01] place they ain't got none eat we got to
[1:58:03] get him out of here and maybe since
[1:58:04] Judas once you go tell Jesus I ain't
[1:58:07] going up there I ain't gonna get rebuked
[1:58:08] by him I'm gonna get Peter Peter you
[1:58:11] know we out here in this desert place
[1:58:13] and you know and we ain't got no food
[1:58:14] some of the people hungry I actually
[1:58:16] heard I'm saying that they hungry I
[1:58:18] heard
[1:58:19] once you go tell Jesus no no no no you
[1:58:22] know he rebuked me get behind me Satan
[1:58:25] he done told me that before and I am
[1:58:26] ain't hang on I gonna try Jesus like
[1:58:29] that John you know he love you John why
[1:58:32] don't you go up there and all I'm saying
[1:58:34] what I look ya'll I'm sorry ain't brave
[1:58:37] enough to do this so the Bible say all
[1:58:39] love okay and just imagine all 12 them
[1:58:43] coming up to Jesus look at what they say
[1:58:50] verse 35 says and when the day was now
[1:58:54] far spent his disciples came unto him
[1:58:57] and said I want y'all to get this
[1:59:01] because this is reasoning this is
[1:59:06] reasoning this is reasoning this is the
[1:59:09] stuff we're trying to get rid of yeah I
[1:59:13] mean look at and then it made sense to
[1:59:16] your natural mind but it's not speaking
[1:59:18] faint faith is the sixth sense
[1:59:23] faith sees things that the natural stuff
[1:59:25] can see look at it church look at it
[1:59:31] right he says in and when the day was
[1:59:34] now far spent his disciples came in and
[1:59:36] said this is a desert place like Jesus
[1:59:39] didn't know that didn't he invite them
[1:59:41] there this is a desert place and now the
[1:59:46] time is far past look at it it says send
[1:59:50] them away that they may go into the
[1:59:53] country round about and into the
[1:59:55] villages and buy themselves bread but
[1:59:57] they have nothing to eat before they
[2:00:00] just breaking it down after they
[2:00:03] finished hearing all their testimonies
[2:00:06] verse 37 say and he answered and he said
[2:00:11] unto them give you them to eat I just
[2:00:17] like I like Jesus I love Jesus
[2:00:19] I just love Jesus so he this is some
[2:00:23] permission how we gonna give them
[2:00:25] something to eat
[2:00:26] well what were we supposed to get this
[2:00:28] from we are in a desert place where is
[2:00:31] this supposed to come from
[2:00:32] see and I don't know where you are you
[2:00:34] might find yourself in a desert place
[2:00:38] you might be trying to figure out where
[2:00:40] is it gonna come from it's gonna come
[2:00:42] from your mouth when you open your mouth
[2:00:50] and call for it it will come if you
[2:01:00] could only believe we sang it but we
[2:01:04] don't believe it you know just take that
[2:01:08] hold me right there keep it right there
[2:01:09] right there
[2:01:10] I just want to inject this last week I
[2:01:14] was telling you all about brother
[2:01:16] Branham having the young lady you can
[2:01:20] take the scripture down but just leave
[2:01:22] it at 37 so I remember where I was where
[2:01:24] he went into the room and he saw that
[2:01:25] string hanging you know on the just up
[2:01:31] in the ceiling and when you saw the
[2:01:33] string the girl was saying I got faith I
[2:01:35] got faith brother Graham I don't care
[2:01:36] what my church say I got faith you say
[2:01:37] sister you got faith he's like yeah I
[2:01:39] got it I got it
[2:01:40] he say sister if you got faith move
[2:01:43] little that string just move from side
[2:01:45] to side and then he says it's hanging
[2:01:47] from his gender they say it's a mover
[2:01:49] from socks I didn't just stop it if you
[2:01:51] got faith just said came nobody to do
[2:01:53] that say yes you can you can do it she
[2:01:58] say she say brother branham no no that's
[2:02:00] that's spiritualism can't nobody do not
[2:02:02] like that say yes you can sister so she
[2:02:07] say brother branham can you do it yeah
[2:02:11] you said everybody else turn around
[2:02:13] don't look at this just I need to work
[2:02:15] with her just just just let me work with
[2:02:17] her and in total saying I don't look at
[2:02:19] me sister you look at the string cuz
[2:02:23] imma tell you if I was there if I was
[2:02:25] there
[2:02:26] I'm be honest with y'all if I was there
[2:02:28] and brother branham did that I'm still
[2:02:30] gonna be looking at how did you just do
[2:02:32] it there I need to know what just I'm
[2:02:35] missing something I need what you got
[2:02:39] come on church let's be honest
[2:02:43] but-but-but-but the reason they say
[2:02:45] don't look at me cuz he didn't want us
[2:02:47] getting focused on him we got to get
[2:02:52] focused on Christ
[2:02:56] cuz the same Christ that dwelled on his
[2:02:58] prophet that made him be able to do that
[2:02:59] and I because the reason I'm bringing
[2:03:01] his back but me and brother Solomon's
[2:03:03] fellowship in last week and he brought
[2:03:05] out a point that I forgot to share with
[2:03:06] you I said I got to go back and hit that
[2:03:08] again well brother Braniff said don't
[2:03:11] look at me
[2:03:11] you look at the string he say the young
[2:03:13] lady looked at the string just the
[2:03:16] string and it went to and fro and then
[2:03:18] it just stopped the young lady
[2:03:21] say brother branham you got to give me
[2:03:23] some scripture on that I ain't never I
[2:03:26] mean this that's that spiritualism
[2:03:27] that's of the devil that's of the devil
[2:03:31] he said magicians use this all the time
[2:03:33] they say this is of God this is faith
[2:03:35] and say you won't scripture they say and
[2:03:39] it took it to the scripture you know out
[2:03:41] of a marquee 11 22 through 24 but verse
[2:03:45] verse 22 and Jesus answering saith unto
[2:03:47] them have faith in God for their last
[2:03:49] interview that who service is saying to
[2:03:50] this mountain be thou removed and be
[2:03:52] thou castles and see and shall not doubt
[2:03:53] in his heart but believe but shall
[2:03:56] believe those things which he said shall
[2:03:57] come to pass he should have whatsoever
[2:03:59] said so your faith could move mountains
[2:04:01] it can certainly move a string if Jesus
[2:04:08] say we can move mountains you can move
[2:04:11] the string what a testimony kept going
[2:04:14] that girls little puzzle
[2:04:19] y'all want me to tell it to you read it
[2:04:21] to you
[2:04:26] I find that when y'all see what the
[2:04:34] Prophet said it's still a little bit
[2:04:36] better with ya cuz otherwise y'all just
[2:04:38] taking my word for it let's read it
[2:04:43] faith is the substance I'm not reading
[2:04:47] the whole thing I'm just reading I just
[2:04:49] set you up to get you to this part that
[2:04:50] I want to read to you then I'm gonna go
[2:04:52] back to that description we'll be done
[2:04:53] for the day I promise you
[2:04:54] oh my god I want y'all to see this so
[2:05:00] faith is a sudden I'm at paragraph 42 it
[2:05:08] says now then of course fasten my
[2:05:10] officer to that bracelet which you can
[2:05:12] yourself if you won't doubt in your
[2:05:16] heart and it started moving around and
[2:05:19] then it moved back and forth around
[2:05:21] crossways and stopped it she said
[2:05:24] brother Branham she said that's that
[2:05:25] spiritualism I said I thought maybe you
[2:05:27] say something like that mine isn't it
[2:05:29] strange how people that profess they
[2:05:31] know God and know so little about him
[2:05:33] isn't that right can I just put it this
[2:05:36] way it isn't strange her message
[2:05:38] believers I'm not operational at this
[2:05:42] level she said you know we belong to the
[2:05:46] Church of Christ excuse me I didn't mean
[2:05:49] to say I don't mean the state excuse me
[2:05:52] Church of Christ people I didn't mean to
[2:05:53] say that see anyhow said we speak where
[2:05:56] the Bible speaks in silent with a Bible
[2:05:57] silent you know and you you have that
[2:05:59] slogan I've questioned that a few times
[2:06:01] I said all right she said there's no
[2:06:03] such a thing it can be showed in the
[2:06:06] Bible anything like that I said I felt
[2:06:08] that's what you would say I said sure
[2:06:10] that's it in the Bible she said well I
[2:06:12] never I don't believe it alright I said
[2:06:14] you don't believe it she said now you
[2:06:16] show me where that's where that's at in
[2:06:19] the Bible I said one day Jesus passed by
[2:06:21] a tree he wanted to find some fruit on
[2:06:23] it there was no fruit on it he put a
[2:06:25] curse on it and a tree and the tree
[2:06:27] began to wilt and when they passed by at
[2:06:29] noon the tree was Wilson down Peter
[2:06:31] remarked I said how quick the tree was
[2:06:33] wilted he said if you would say in your
[2:06:36] heart for this tree to be plucked up and
[2:06:38] cast into the sea
[2:06:39] and wouldn't doubt doubt it it would
[2:06:42] obey you did he said and I said he said
[2:06:44] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:06:46] don't down in your heart by and by it
[2:06:49] would come to pass did he say it sure he
[2:06:53] did I said I know your unbelieving
[2:06:55] pastor trying to justify his unbelief
[2:07:01] said that was a mountain of sin
[2:07:04] I went to school myself he was kneeling
[2:07:06] by mount Olive's it was Mount of Olives
[2:07:09] if you stay in your heart for it to be
[2:07:11] moved and don't doubt it I said how much
[2:07:14] more faith and they said if you had
[2:07:16] faith the size of a mustard seed I said
[2:07:20] now faith the size of a mustard seed
[2:07:21] with what move that mountain how much
[2:07:23] more smaller faith would you have would
[2:07:26] you have just to move that bracelet it
[2:07:30] goes on you see what I mean and and and
[2:07:33] some of y'all got that scripture the
[2:07:35] mustard seed faith you got your mustard
[2:07:37] seeds in your Bible that we put in there
[2:07:38] from brother Peregrine that gave us in
[2:07:40] Cana by the tail you that you ain't got
[2:07:42] the mustard seed in your Bible even
[2:07:43] though you can't see it the reason if
[2:07:45] you got the reason that Jesus say have
[2:07:46] faith asylum must see it because a
[2:07:48] muscle suit can't be mixed with anything
[2:07:50] else
[2:07:50] it can't be tampered with your faith
[2:07:53] cannot be tampered with no reasoning no
[2:07:57] doubt nothing faith no explaining faith
[2:08:06] listen you see what I mean
[2:08:09] now I've often wondered why he said
[2:08:12] muscle see that I might drop this top
[2:08:13] muscle see there's a smallest among all
[2:08:15] see that's right but there is a nothing
[2:08:17] with mixed with mustard seed it's all
[2:08:19] mustard you can't mix it with kale or
[2:08:20] nothing and make it grow and salt
[2:08:22] mustard if you got that much faith all
[2:08:25] faith not mixed up with something else
[2:08:28] ask what you will it'll be given to you
[2:08:31] but it can't be wavering it's got to be
[2:08:35] genuine mustard if you know what I'm
[2:08:38] speaking of all right and I said how
[2:08:40] much more would it take
[2:08:42] well she said lookie here I want to ask
[2:08:44] you something
[2:08:45] she said did God move that or did the
[2:08:50] devil move
[2:08:51] I said neither one move that she said
[2:08:57] them how in the world did it move I said
[2:09:00] I moved it she said well you're 15 feet
[2:09:11] are better away from it I said no it's
[2:09:14] my faith that moved in
[2:09:18] see if you ask anything and don't doubt
[2:09:20] see what I mean that girl wanted to know
[2:09:25] did God move the string I did the devil
[2:09:27] move the string brother I'm saying no
[2:09:31] God didn't move it and neither did the
[2:09:34] devil move it I moved that's a person
[2:09:43] that knows who they are in Christ person
[2:09:46] that understands what faith is all about
[2:09:48] we talked about how he said if that if
[2:09:50] that knife was at home he could bring it
[2:09:53] off the dresser and put it in his pocket
[2:09:57] we don't understand that you let me try
[2:10:01] - he didn't pray and ask in the name of
[2:10:08] Jesus for the string to move that would
[2:10:16] be God moving it he didn't do that he
[2:10:22] moved it himself with his faith based on
[2:10:28] Scripture now he didn't do this all the
[2:10:32] time he did it because he needed her to
[2:10:33] see that she didn't have the faith that
[2:10:35] she claimed she had motive and objective
[2:10:42] so yeah when the Holy Spirit is bringing
[2:10:46] these type of things to attention you
[2:10:47] know I'm up here preaching this but you
[2:10:49] know what I'm trying to operate like
[2:10:51] this and and I feel like what the Holy
[2:10:54] Spirit's doing is challenging me the
[2:10:57] pressure that I'm going through is gonna
[2:10:59] produce some power the power is already
[2:11:03] inside of you you don't even realize
[2:11:05] but it take a situation I mean a
[2:11:09] difficult something that's just a lot of
[2:11:12] tension that's gonna pull this out of
[2:11:14] here oh I believe that who moved the
[2:11:19] string the prophets say I did it my
[2:11:22] faith in it my faith and there's gonna
[2:11:26] be some things that happen in your life
[2:11:27] your faith gonna take care of your faith
[2:11:32] gonna make it happen I'm just sewing the
[2:11:38] seeds and some time are you digging in
[2:11:41] ground like this boy it's hard but you
[2:11:44] know what nonetheless it's got to be
[2:11:45] said because this does not no name it
[2:11:48] and claim it faith this is this is
[2:11:49] higher than that we're going higher than
[2:11:50] name it and claim it we're going back to
[2:11:53] the original faith that was in God the
[2:11:55] original face that let there be and the
[2:11:58] Bible said there was that that's where
[2:12:02] we're headed back to I got quotes up
[2:12:05] here for y'all I'm and I'm gonna read it
[2:12:07] - I ain't gonna let y'all get away
[2:12:08] without me reading this a man I ain't
[2:12:10] gonna let the devil rush me out of here
[2:12:13] man there's got to be preached to the
[2:12:16] people glory to God I mean so so decease
[2:12:20] because this is what's coming forth so
[2:12:23] just give me a let me go back to the
[2:12:24] scripture I'm gonna read a couple more
[2:12:25] cokes and then I'll let you go and in

[2:12:38] right so March 6 verse 37 now remember
[2:12:41] let's go back the disciples have shared
[2:12:44] all the powerful testimonies with Jesus
[2:12:47] you know what they did when he gave them
[2:12:48] power to go cast out devils and
[2:12:50] everything now he pulls them to the side
[2:12:52] pulls them into the desert place that
[2:12:54] get there to a desert place and and
[2:12:55] they're in a spot now where no food
[2:12:58] nothing and they see the people getting
[2:13:00] hungry and and they approached Jesus and
[2:13:03] they say Jesus you know sent him send
[2:13:05] him some villages and send him around
[2:13:06] about let him go get some bread cuz they
[2:13:08] ain't got nothing to eat verse 37 now he
[2:13:10] says he answered and said to them give
[2:13:12] you them to eat and they say to him

[2:17:34] I'm gonna tell you you didn't you
[2:17:37] wouldn't have saw this had he not taken
[2:17:41] there had he not taken them to the
[2:17:48] desert place come on church if they
[2:17:52] would have been at the buffet they would
[2:17:53] have never saw this was under pressure
[2:18:02] it produced some foul verse 42 and they
[2:18:09] did all eat and we're feel not just ate
[2:18:15] but they was but they probably had the
[2:18:17] best meal I ever had not like and they
[2:18:21] took up twelve basketfuls of the
[2:18:23] fragments and of the fishes and they
[2:18:26] that did eat of the loaves were about
[2:18:28] five thousand men that's not counting
[2:18:30] the women and the children that's just a
[2:18:31] man church pressure produces and and
[2:18:38] notice he had to bring them into a place
[2:18:40] like that in order for them to see even
[2:18:42] after they were sharing all their
[2:18:43] powerful testimony we did this we did
[2:18:45] that we did this but Charlie seemed that
[2:18:47] like this before see everything you go
[2:18:52] through God got purpose for him cause he
[2:18:55] gave me just expressed something so
[2:18:56] matter to you ain't you never hurt you
[2:18:58] never heard if I heard about it you
[2:18:59] never seen it but God won't express it
[2:19:01] to you anyway can I just read two quotes

[2:19:07] Abraham and his seed after him Abraham
[2:19:12] and his seed after him yes Abraham and
[2:19:19] his seed after him just just a title

[2:19:34] of Abraham now look at this I want you
[2:19:37] to notice that was just before the
[2:19:39] destruction now before the promise was
[2:19:40] fulfilled watch just
[2:19:42] moment now after he made him that place
[2:19:44] is named now positioning place to call
[2:19:47] him through justification you believe
[2:19:48] that his see-through justification
[2:19:50] sanctification through the blood to the
[2:19:52] seat filling with himself filling with
[2:19:54] itself pouring herself and to him as El
[2:19:57] Shaddai the Holy Spirit now placing him
[2:20:00] and given him a part of his name Elohim

[2:22:10] groaning waiting for the manifestations
[2:22:13] of the sons of God if I'm a Branham I'm
[2:22:17] a brand I'm part of a brand and if a man
[2:22:21] is a son of God he is made in the image
[2:22:24] of God and given the domain here on

[2:23:38] alright oh praise God a man says had it
[2:23:46] right the other days she didn't ask for
[2:23:47] nothing she was just sitting there but

[2:23:56] thing
[2:23:58] you're Amen at the right time like this

[2:24:26] still got that praise right the other
[2:24:31] day she didn't act for nothing she was
[2:24:33] just sitting there but she said the
[2:24:35] right thing which please the Holy Spirit
[2:24:37] and the Holy Spirit spoke back and said

[2:24:43] whatever you got and you won't find out
[2:24:46] whether this is really not ask anything
[2:24:49] the healing of her little crippled

[2:24:56] on the mills over there
[2:24:57] the youth restored to her well rundown
[2:24:59] body so you got to know how to ask when
[2:25:04] God gave had it right when the first one
[2:25:06] to be told to ask anything because
[2:25:09] Solomon was told that in the Bible and
[2:25:11] and Solomon asked for wisdom and because
[2:25:14] he actually the right thing
[2:25:15] God said I give you money with your
[2:25:17] wisdom mmm you gotta know what to ask
[2:25:21] for
[2:25:21] that's first thing we think about is
[2:25:23] money but after you get through this
