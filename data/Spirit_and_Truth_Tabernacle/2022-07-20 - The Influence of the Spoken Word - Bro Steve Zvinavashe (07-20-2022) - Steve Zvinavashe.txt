just for a moment amen uh i was just sitting there thinking as we were singing that um the song says in the in the good times and the bad you're on your throne that means nothing moves him nothing moves our god amen and if nothing moves him then it shouldn't move us either amen amen we serve a god that created all these things so amen how we love them and how we appreciate them real quickly i just want to kind of go through the announcements um and um i'm i'm elated uh to have uh just a a guest minister for us tonight brother brother steve will be coming in a little bit to minister forrest

amen for the weekend coming and then tonight another blessing uh coming our way so god is good amen and i know like some of the saints didn't make it out and they're probably streaming like brother jack you didn't say no that's because it just came together yesterday and uh sometimes god like to surprise you so you got to be ready you got to always be ready you never know when something's going to happen never assume anything but god knows how to surprise us so amen i hope you get your blessing tonight let me just give these announcements really quickly amen um for the saints here we won't be here sunday we'll be at rapture faith tabernacle uh there uh uh in the meetings we'll be doing our stream um on um twitter as well as facebook and also on our church website john423.org uh the services um [Music] there's a a little change so uh friday's gonna start at seven and then i believe saturday evening it starts at 6 30 rather than rather than seven and then regular uh sunday morning 10 a.m and then sunday evening 7 p.m and we'll be looking forward to the service there with the saints from brother guinness church amen we are certainly looking forward to that we have a couple youth outings that are getting ready to happen august 6th at 3 p.m ages 15 and below and then we have on august 19th a um a youth evening breakfast devotion and uh and i'll be doing that at my home for the

people uh brother jason watkins bethel youth camp travelers red south carolina so uh that's for our young people and i i certainly want to encourage our young people to try to get to some of these meetings i think um sometimes when you're just in the right atmosphere it just does something for you and i've been hearing some really positive testimonies lately of just young people getting mighty deliverances in some of these youth camps sometimes it's much easier for them to worship when they're amongst their peers amen than just being with with parents so i want to encourage the parents let's try to get our young people involved uh the next generation we want them to have a true experience with god and we want to put them in atmospheres where they can have that experience with god so keep that in mind our giving amen is multiple ways if you give it online we have zell we have cash app we have paypal if you use paypal or zell the email address that you use is giving at john423.org if you use cash app the uh the handle is dollar sign spiritual t we also have the regular snail mail and it works and we appreciate all those that give a man no matter which way you choose to give we appreciate your giving thank you for your support uh to this ministry amen um those that are inside the sanctuary we have this box over here my to my right if you want to put your offering in there as you're exiting tonight uh i don't want to take too much time um when we went to uh london at easter um brother gwyneth told me he says i got a brother that's gonna pick you all up but he picked up our luggage at the airport and um my brother showed up in his van and we had all these bags that we just pulled along and everything and we didn't want to pull them into downtown uh area so uh brother steve happened to be that brother to be there to pick up our luggage and make sure it got uh to the destination that it needed to be at the hotel and and he just took care of us a man with great care and and we were we were just very very appreciative of him so uh you know when i came back from london i had a little conversation with brother steve and he was sharing a powerful testimony with me

god i'm not a stranger in this country i'm part and parcel of you i greet you all in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ many faces they know me some i haven't met but we met before in glory land yes my name is brother steve amen if it's easy i follow you you call me brother zinavashi [Laughter] hallelujah oh i'm glad to be here to see our precious pastor brother jack duff a lot of saints that i've seen tinashe and his wife long time god bless you my precious brother back there ah brother simba as well oh my my sister's there the only thing i can say is i love you amen that will explain everything my but i don't even know where to start from maybe i might start to give you just a little bit of a background it's my first time to be in this country but in 2001 when i was still joining in zimbabwe i got a visa for 10 years to come here together with my wife and my four children but i never used them they got to expire in 2010 and never step my foot in this country i just think god has got an appointed time for everybody amen i should have been here long back maybe with the same action that you have but however i believe you're going to understand my accent my one is mixed with a bit of african background and a bit of british accent all right i like it that way although i'm not a crossbreed hallelujah amen um i love the song that project deck was actually singing it really took me back as if i was back into the garden of eden yes those such are the songs that possibly esteems me and they take me to a certain level but however without wasting much for your time i would like us to first of all open by a word of prayer amen if we can close our eyes precious lord eternal in the heavens we give you glory this day we appreciate you father you saw it fit for this day to be what it is by your grace lord god almighty i'm not somebody who is important but father i'm just like my fellow brothers and sisters in here i take this opportunity to belittle myself and esteem you i dear god may you come down father god almighty as we are fellowshipping around your word may you speak to each and every heart oh dear god lord we're expecting you we love you we appreciate you come in your mighty dear god per adventure you are coming for one person that will be suffi sufficient dear god we realize one time when the rage the storms were raging and the disciples in that sheep lord you came walking onto the waters and when you were there you crossed the oceans you were going for one person who was possessed with a multiple of demons father god may you come down this school of the evening and minister unto our hearts we give you glory we give you honor at this juncture lord i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god we love you we appreciate you may you start with us and end with us in the precious name of our lord jesus christ we pray and believe amen hallelujah the devil thought he's got me today when i was dressing up my wife was busy dressing as well and she was telling me let's get ready i said no okay we will then i forgot my other pair of eyes then i said no worries when i get to church per adventure there will be somebody with plus 2.50 that's the range of my eyesight it's just glasses that i used to to where to read but i want to defy him tonight amen hallelujah one time moses was told i want you to go to egypt and liberate my people and he approached god and he said but you know i cannot speak he said who gives fluent speech then he said it's you then he said okay fine you are now a god and aaron is now your prophet go to the land of egypt and deliver my people and they did once hallelujah and they managed what god had pushing them to do tonight i am in the same situation he is the god who restored the eyesight hallelujah and i'm going to say john whatever is upon my heart whatever god is approaching me is exactly what i'm going to deliver praise be to god hallelujah i'm somebody who loves noise yes i know noise will disturb the devil hallelujah so i'm expecting a hallelujah from you in a hallelujah from that corner and hallelujah from everywhere so that we confuse and disconfit the devil praise be to god amen i would like us to turn to our scripture readings for tonight praise be to god my my my my i feel like home already praise god my scripture reading for tonight is uh second kings chapter seven verse 3 glory hallelujah hallelujah if we are all there the bible says and there were four leprous men at the entering of the gates and they said one to another why is it we here until we die my leprous people four of them they had been taken out of the camp because this was a contagious disease they didn't want to pollute the wall of the congregation they said we are already starving but we don't want to stuff with ailments upon us with any sickness upon our bodies let's get rid of these leprous people let's put them out of the gates even if they die there they still were going to die because they are leprous but it came to a challenge to these leprous people then they said we know we have got leprous and we are dying with hunger something must we must do something this day right then they say let's have a conference with god lord yes we've got we've got leprous here we are suffering and we are hungry as well right maybe we you might take us when we have already eaten something they were discussing upon themselves then they come to a conclusion we are sitting outside here we have been chased out of the camp and now we are going to die let's be man enough let's do something oh hallelujah hallelujah tonight my brother my sister you don't have any leprosy but you're gathered in the house of god and this is the time where you should say lord you brought me in here i had a burden upon my heart i'm a fully fit person but i want to seek your first tonight i want to see the glory of god speak to me individually i'm ready to listen hallelujah hallelujah and they said one to another why sit we here until we die oh praise be to god hallelujah this by this alone i feel good amen my second scripture readings proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 to 6. praise god hallelujah many a times we want to rely upon the way we feel all right but tonight let's change the gears and let's shift our position trust in the lord with all thine hearts and lean not unto thine own understanding lean not and lean not unto their own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy past oh praise be to god shall we pray precious lord we have read your word father god almighty you are the best interpreter of your word we are feeble but thou art strong we take this opportunity to invite you dear god to come on the scene and execute the job for us our hearts are ready to listen from thee take control of every situation dear god more so come down father god almighty and feed your people i believe this is food in due season help my unbelief dear god as i stand before your holy people precious father take control from henceforth and we'll be like those at the end we're coming from amos who prophesied with their lips of clay and say did not our hearts burn as you speak unto us we give you glory we give you honor in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray and believe amen you can take the comfort of your seats i'm not going to be offended if you want to remain standing hallelujah hallelujah maybe i should start by saying good evening saints hallelujah don't doubt it it's already good hallelujah hallelujah i believe we are faced with a convention very soon yes and i thought let me just provoke this with this little message that i have maybe somebody might start to jump and say well i was now slackening behind let me put my hands on the on the plow and soldier on amen how many are happy to be in the house of god hallelujah how many are ready to say give me my mountain how men are saying are ready to say give me my mountain hallelujah my brother your mountain is a potion to you my one is a portion to me there's no way i'm going to take real mountain it is your responsibility to tackle your mountain and god will see us through because he has fully equipped us with every gadget with every power hallelujah to tackle our mountains and there's no reason at the end of this service for somebody to say i haven't finished my mountain we should all say our mountains are done and done hallelujah praise be to god this is the place where we get everything this is the source of our inspiration i'm a believer of the faithful ministry this is the place where we come and suck and suck until we are full hallelujah this is where the source of our power is oh praise be to god let me ask you tonight don't go out the way you came in there has to be a time of transformation there has to be a time time of transformation i am saying don't go out the same way you came in there has to be a change the prophet told us you get according hallelujah you get according to expectation praise be to god i have titled my little message the influence of the spoken word we have not believed this message for not my brother my sister this message is rich this message has got influence this message once you get the influence of the message then you are a soldier of god you are ready to go out and fight the enemy hallelujah the influence of the spoken word sometimes we take these words for we take them for granted when i take my bible and read it i take my time to read from where the coma is where the full stop is where these some of these words are so i took the liberty this afternoon to say let me just search for the meaning of influence and the the meaning of influence from the english dictionary it says it is the capacity to have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something or the effect itself the capacity to have an effect that's influence we are influenced by the word of god that's why we are gathered here we are eagles we have come to feast on our daily fresh care there's been an influence behind to say to each and everyone it's time to go to church when i was coming from my hotel we got into a lift a certain white man jumped in and he said it's today wednesday i said yes he looked at my bible and he nodded then are you he knew this man is going to the source of power to go and sup and i was going to stop and have come to sap hallelujah there's something that echoed because when i was holding my bible i was treasuring it i was holding it like the like the the blood of jesus christ i didn't want no blood to be to drop on the floor i said i'll take all the liberty to hold my bible so reverently because i know what is contained in this bible is more than an atomic power this is where my atomic power is and i want to say to you tonight you're an atomic power as you're seated there there's no big or small and anything that can come to you that you can never tackle god has fully equipped you with every power to tackle everything that comes your way don't look down upon yourself my brother you are more than in atomic power hallelujah if all the nations want to know what an atomic power is they should not even go to their armory they must look for you to say what is the belief of the message of the hour he is the one she is the one with the answer to everything hallelujah not all these hydrogen bombs that they are making the atomic power lies into your hands now you've got the capacity to speak things into existence to speak things out of existence because then god gave you the power and this house is full of atomic power praise be to god hallelujah hallelujah don't mind my brother my sister even if they call you with names out there they'll come one time when you realize the power that is invested upon you then you can just speak the word in action and everything will be swept away hallelujah lord and behold we have power to create our own world but it is not right the right time right now because if you are going to create your own world you then escape and the rapture will take time hallelujah so hold your peace glory be to god glory be to god hallelujah we have read from the scripture they were gathered outside the four lepers yes talking to themselves what shall we do death is surrounding us hallelujah remember my brother my sister these four leprous people god took time to write about them but when you look into the whole country there were so many other leprous people but to god they were not important but these ones were important they were handpicked by god as much as you are my brother my sister out of the millions and trillions of people god took his spiritual binoculars and he started to survey and he said whom shall i pick whom shall i pick amongst these children and he picked you my brother he picked you my brother he picked you my sister he picked you my little brother and he knows that in this age hallelujah in this age you are more than capable to meet up with the challenges of this day because the gadget in you is greater than the gadget that is in the world hallelujah they were not the only leprous people around but these ones got in the plan and it was necessary for him to say i want to talk about these people because they've got a special place upon my heart hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's go to my first quotation the hour has come the time comes when you have to stand on god's word stand alone hallelujah but when that time comes stand there each one has been approaching their time by god and you are being encouraged and urged by the prophet that the time will come when you have to stand on god's word you are not going to rely on your sister's help nor your brother's help there will come a time a perilous time as the bible records that those times are coming but we are saying hallelujah the time when you have to stand on you god's word is gonna come and when it comes my brother don't miss your portion stand alone but when that time comes stand there regardless as much as these leprous people did it was their time to stand alone outside the camber remember the prophet elijah he had to pronounce a spoken word hallelujah when he announced that spoken word these leprous people were not there hallelujah the leprous people were not there but they were influenced by the power of the spoken word by a prophet let me tell you children you might go astray but if you've got a father and a mother who are spiritual if they knew down and pray and say lord may you meet up with my son may you meet up with my child wherever he is condemnation will strike you there and there hallelujah hallelujah condemnation will strike you wherever you are even if you are in the middle of drinking beer hallelujah even if you are in the middle of dancing saying to all your other colleagues check this dancer which i'm doing check this one during that process my brother my sister when your mom or your dad raises up their hands and say lord lord hear my prayer especially you mothers you have got the most powerful most powerful voice that god is ready to listen to you and he is saying use those lips of clay speak to me i want to hear what he has upon your heart sir hallelujah oh praise be to god praise be to god when we the parents pray for you my brother sister god will intervene god will hear he knows he knows remember the prophet he said to your son billy you can do whatsoever you want but i've done the job already go astray you'll meet up with my god hallelujah and for sure he met with the god of the prophets hallelujah obedience is better than sacrifice all praise be to god not only to your parents even to your pastors because they are ordained shepherds to lead you to that glory length hallelujah praise be to god oh my god oh my oh my but when that time comes and that times comes stand there there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith that's the time it is tonight hallelujah praise be to god let me just take off my jacket amen amen we are being reminded there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith that's the time it is tonight forget about your feelings my brother forget about your feelings my sister it is time to focus your attention hallelujah on your faith only believe all things are possible hallelujah hallelujah oh praise be to god i love this gospel they asked themselves why are we sitting here and dying hallelujah let's move on my brother why are we sitting here the hour come for some more boys one time about four of them sitting at a gate the syrians had besieged jerusalem or samaria and they didn't know what to do and they were covered with lepros they couldn't go in they were outside the gate they said why do we sit here until we die why we why said we here until we die the influence that moved these people these special leprous people were the power of the influence of the spoken word elijah had announced it is very important my brother my sister always to listen always to listen to the watchmen the watchman sees from afar if you say something take it my brother if your pastor says something take it my brother my sister if he says we have been too long going around on this mountain let's first know what's now and let's go this direction all you need to say is to say yes sir let's soldier on hallelujah praise be to god praise be to god these pastors are ordained of god if they make a mistake it's not our duty to correct them it's god who corrects them let them go astray in the manner in which they will be telling you it's god in it god in simplicity hallelujah praise be to god you want to see a prosperous church it's a church that rallies behind their pastor hallelujah there won't be any any any any talking in amongst the people is always they will rally behind their pastor and if you rally behind your pastor you have defeated the purpose of the devil because the devil won't won't have any place to penetrate and use any one of us hallelujah i'm just passing through samaria hallelujah praise be to god not that i know of anybody who doesn't listen to the pastor but i'm just saying i'm passing through somebody or rather let me say they always say i'm passing through summary let me say i'm passing through canaan hallelujah praise be to god i believe the message is something for you tonight this message has got something for you my brother my sister no matter your condition you might have been looked as a black sheep amongst your people because you have believed this message but little did they know that that this message which you have believed is the same message that will liberate them because you are the one who is going to liberate them our prophet teaches us that whatsoever you have loved and that which has loved you they will make it i don't believe there's anyone in here who wants his he wants his parents or he wants his relatives to go astray or to go to gehenna hallelujah you are taking a sacrifice my brother my sister by accepting this message of the hour which our prophet gave unto us hallelujah we are serving our purpose as much as the leprous people are serving their purpose if you read along this this this the story of these leprous people they started to move they started to move they were moving now as much as i will age you my brother my sister tonight to say if you have been sitting on something that you wanted so much it's time for you to stand up and start to move to say lord i'm going to the enemy's camp i'm going to take that which he rubbed me off i'm going to fight the enemy i'm going to disconfess him i'm going to i'm going to win over him it's time you should stand and challenge the devil if he says boo to you go to him as well stand where he is and you win him it's time to say hallelujah the cross before me the world behind me come watch me my lord is going to save me come at me i'm fighting this battle for my children they are still young but i must take the reins of by myself to fight for them i will defeat the purpose of the devil he's never going to rub me off my children he's never going to rub me off my wife he's never going to rob me of my husband it is your responsibility now to say i must trust the enemy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my brother my sister we have not been given this message on a golden plateau you are a fighter if you are a soldier and you are given 12 rounds of bullets hallelujah in this country you are allowed to buy guns if i see a guy now start to run away because he's not familiar with me hallelujah our police in england they don't carry guns we can push them we can kick them but they'll just be saying oh no come on this is not nice give me your hands let me chain you this is what we have we are used to but lo and behold here i'm told if they say jump you'll say oh i hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my brother this message is what it has done unto you is the same as it has done unto me i protect it so much my brother my sister they say a little fish when it is in the water you can hardly do anything to it why it's in its own territory hallelujah tonight you're in your own territory the territory of the word of god who then can come against you when our god is on our side count the joy when you first when you faced a lot of temptations hallelujah because you know what is behind if for say you see a little boy like him there and he comes to you and says i can fight you today i want to fight you to an old man like myself you start to think where is the power and the courage coming from such a little boy to fight a man like myself if you look beyond there will be a giant walking up and down you'll be just saying say hello son tell them whatever you want i'm here to back you up this is the same scenario our god yes with us tonight he's saying why cry speak and go forth i'm here to back you up hallelujah god is backing us up i don't care your condition i don't care about your parents i don't care what type of demon is in front of you tonight tonight goliath is going to fall down go live is going to fall down until our little ones will go out and say i'm looking for my own goliath hallelujah they will forget when they were crying before goliath was slaughtered when the mom would say stop crying goliath is just by the door they would quickly keep quiet but now goliath has been slayed hallelujah they have got the courage to go out and say i want to kill my own goliath i am looking for my own goliath this is the same spirit my brother my sister that i want you to adopt tonight no matter what condition you are no matter what type of a demon is before you no matter what type of a problem before you i don't care only believe all things are possible hallelujah let it come in any form and shape let it come in any form and shape i will say lord you are the same yesterday today and forever that which you did before you are more than capable to do it even now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you ask yourself just when you're sitting down have you asked yourself why this message is so important to you you know these are some of the questions that we just overlook this message is so important my brother my sister i'll give you a little testimony which happened back home in zimbabwe they you know because of the housing situation some people would not afford to buy their own house so what they'll do is they'll go to a certain house and they'll ask the owner can i just rent this room and they'll say okay it will be about fifty dollars a month then say okay we'll be able to pay but that tenant was doing very well despite this fact that he had no no yet in his own home he was doing very well so what did what he did was every time in the kitchen there was the smell of meat the smell of god the smell of lamb the smell of beef fish and this really got to the names of the owner of the house saying this man is always eating with meat and i don't eat meat i'll devise a plan so what he did is he took a glass bottle he crushed it crushed it into small bits and he put it into the vegetables for this man the man hit slept the following morning he woke up nothing happened the man was just looking at him to say i think i will hear something inside there but he never had anything he started to wonder what's happening is my plan not working the following day he did the same thing this time a little bit bigger the glasses were left a little bit bigger so that they can actually cut the intestines as he ate the man who was given the vegetables he ate nothing happened the man did that for quite a long time until he said let me own up he went to the men and he said you know what i was so jealous about you and what i've been doing is i've been feeding you with crushed glasses so that you can get your intestines cut and they like but i don't know what's protecting you the man then turned to me said you know what it's not my ability it's the grace of god that man is into the faith right now because of what he was doing so what i'm saying my brother my sister in any situation that you go into god is always looking after you you don't know how many demons that we come across with out there how many demons that we brush our shoulders together with but god is always sparing us god is always sparing us so i urge you to think deeper about what this message has done to you it is actually transformed you to a new person to a person who can challenge any demons hallelujah hallelujah any demon can never stand before you because of this message amen praise be to god tonight the message is something for you let me repeat tonight's message he's got something for you amen it's time to stand and do something about our situation let's not be crybabies every time we say oh lord this oh lord this oh lord this but god is just looking and he's saying i'm waiting for you you want a job you get a piece of paper you put in an application when you put in an application then i can influence that whoever's going to touch and read it i can blind him and he can give you a job even if you don't have even any qualifications to match up with that job because i am god there's nothing nothing impossible before me the thing is we don't act let's act now and say lord we have been slightly behind we now have realized that we need to make a move we need to make an initiative like these lapras people they were sitting there and they realized we are going to die he's saying if we sit here we will die if we walk into the enemy's camp we will die but let's let's try our luck let's see if we are going to die and when they started to walk god magnified their footprints footprints builds possession as they were walking when the enemies heard the sound that was coming from the feet they started to think oh these hebrews people they have hired every everyone now to come and fight us imagine they were walking oh your flesh is almost falling he said don't worry even if i die let me go and test if they kill me that's it and they were walking and they were walking and they were walking god was using these people imagine people with lepros being used off by god what about you my brother my sister what about you my brother my sister who feels on the way that you are not a reject of the society you are the bride of jesus christ and he is saying i will use you if only you are ready stand on your feet and say lord use me tonight i am ready for you and forget every problem that you think you are going to encounter leave it to god he is the one who will take care of everything hallelujah the devil must see tonight that we have got an initiative the devil must realize we are not here to play we have not believed this message for not this message will take us through this general salvation until god comes and ruptures us you are a rapture material my brother don't even prophesy to say i am going to die say i am not going to die i will be i will be raptured hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i will be raptured i'm not somebody who always want to say oh god and the world and the world what do you want to go and do in heaven you must exercise the power that you have that god has poured upon you until you have exercised it that's when you can say i've exhausted every fiber within me lord do your will what are you going to do when we sit around that big table and brother daniel will come and say you were in the eagle age share us your testimony with us you'll start by saying do you know what one time i prayed and the devil held my prayer for three weeks but i didn't give up i didn't give up because i'm a fighter and you'll be listening and you'll say i even made god himself to come down he told women not to go no gabriel not to go he said himself my name for war is prince michael let me go myself imagine an individual bringing god from his holy throne of chair to come and intervene then what will you say about your testimony it's a challenge tonight my brother my sister for you to realize that you still have good job to do you still have got some work to do hallelujah for you to realize that you must exploit the devil hallelujah praise be to god shake your brother shake your sister and say let's soldier on praise be to god amen amen amen hallelujah a man of god elijah he had spoken and the the word that he had spoken had influenced these leprosy people they were not there when the word was being announced but he caught it up in the realm these people and they said this is where our source of power is let's go into the nm's camp tonight my brother my sister it follows suit that we as believers have believed this message of our time we are here because we have fallen under the influence of the spoken word which was delivered to us by our prophet malachi 4. this message my brother has got everything for anyone who believes on it hallelujah we mustn't take it for granted we are more than conquerors hallelujah i know some of you might have come to this message because you were poor and you are now rich you can now see the effect of this message some came because they were alcoholics some came because they were jobless hallelujah hallelujah but they have seen the effect of the message of this hour and this message has done something for you and i know it is done you might not know it by you sitting there it's a testimony hallelujah if you are here this morning this evening this message is still something good for you because it is the same yesterday today and forever because we've believed on the infallible word of god this message has got thus saith the lord and it has never missed amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah it has never missed amen if there's something about your situation tonight it is time to plead with god to say lord you created me for a purpose and now i come in the volume of this message on the strength of this spoken word may you grant me my heart's desire and god will give you my brother my sister i am looking at a situation where these leprous people when they went to the enemy's camp the enemies then started to scatter around and they went from tent to tent looking they couldn't believe their eyes they could see pots of gold bars in them every type of food and they started to eat and they started to eat but because they were ordained of god then they said we cannot feed ourselves only let's go back to the camp yes they took us out of the camp but let's go and invite them my brother my sister like i have said you might have been considered a black sheep and you said out of my house with your belief and with your message but now you know the truth it is time for you to make a u-turn and say i've come with salvation to you people what did joseph do when he went to the land of egypt hallelujah when he was there he took his brothers and he said i know you sold me but it was not your fault it you were used of god it was don't blame yourself you were used of god because god knew there was going to be anger and you'd come to me and i would give you food in plenties hallelujah little did i know my brother this is when pharaoh told joseph to go and tell his people to come into the land of egypt and he pronounced it with his own mouth and he said i know you are cattle breeders i must give you the best land where you are going to stay in egypt you are going to stay in goshen this is why they were in goshen him your enemy will pronounce with his own mouth that you are a son of god but i am going to give you the best as much as pharaoh did he say that i am going to give you the best of lens and you are going to stay in goshen and in goshen there was everything hallelujah hallelujah tonight my brother my sister god is facing you to go into the land of goshen and say this is your inheritance this is your inheritance because he has seen what is in you you are a small god because deity is no longer in heaven date is in you now you can do anything you can sign and god can approve hallelujah behold the tabernacle of god is within man hallelujah hallelujah oh praise be to god hallelujah give me my other quotation my breath hallelujah in this city they were boiling one another's children and eating them you remember the case the syrians were scammed all around starving them to death there was only two rows they said if we go in the city there's nothing to eat there and if we sit there we'll surely die many of you are sitting in the same place tonight you have went to the doctor and has done all he could do for you he has told you you've got cancer and you're going to die and now we are saying ah let me find a place in england when somebody has done that when he's got cancer and he wants to die because we don't have the powers to terminate people's lives they go to switzerland and when they get to switzerland it's an easy route they get killed according to their wish but my brother my sister i am saying don't give up even if when you're on a deathbed god is more than able to resuscitate you you are one of you are lazarus yourself no matter if it's even four days in the grave god is saying lazarus come forth hallelujah hallelujah don't sit on your problem no matter what type of a problem it is my brother my sister god is not yet finished with you if he is done finished with you that's when he can say come home my child but if you defied yourself and say i am not going this route god will say i'll honor that god is ready to listen to you my brother my sister god is on our side god is going on our side god knows your voice god knows your height god knows your complexion god knows you inside and out and if you talk to him and say lord spare me this ha he will what did he hezekiah do my brother my sister he fasted the wall and he raised up his hands and he said lord you know how i have saved you i need another 15 years you pronounce it with his own lips of clay how many years do you want my brother don't limit yourself speak to your god and say lord i need to achieve a b c d hallelujah i need to see my children grow i don't want them to i don't want to leave them as offensive god is saying speak to me i'm ready to listen to you hallelujah so it is your responsibility if things are not working well you are not using neology hallelujah it's time for neology to kneel down and say lord i am using these knees until they get bruised hallelujah hallelujah be like that soldier who said lord if you don't give me the holy ghost you'll find my bones here hallelujah and if you mean it my brother god will be determined to come down and say let me go and meet up with my child because he means it god wants serious people amen if i were you i'll start to ask big lord i want don't ask small if you ask no a lot of people raise their eyebrows to say of course this would have happened to anyone but ask big so that people can start to wonder of course this thing is too unique it can't be of anybody but it's only him only hallelujah if you're aspiring to have a business my brother god is ready to give you that business if you're aspiring to buy a big church god is saying just tell me i will give you a big church what is money what is money before god is nothing hallelujah you can walk into the bank and your balance is zero and when you go into the money to check your balance you'll be surprised you'll find some money being deposited and out of panic you'll start to say look left and right center can i withdraw it but condemnation will strike you and will say let me walk into the bank and first the money the bank manager manager i've just seen this money in my account i don't know where it's coming from then they'll say let's check our records as much as god can say let me open the book of chronicles and see where my child has done me good when he peruses that book hallelujah you'll come across a page where he says i am pleased with my son brother jack daff he did this for me it's now my turn to go and meet up with these challenges my brother my sister they will check all the records we don't know where this money is coming from but only thing we can tell you my brother my sister it's your money have it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] there was a woman who used to open the window and she was praying to say lord i need bread little did you know outside there were children who were listening to his to her prayers they will say this won't always say i want bread i want bread you know what guys let's go to the shops and buy a loaf of bread so they went and bought a loaf of bread when they the woman started to pray say lord i need a loaf of bread then the children took the loaf of bread and they threw it through the window when the woman opened the eyes she swell off a breath she says hallelujah praise god you are provided with with bread my brother my sister god can use your enemy you can ride your own enemy to fight it and once these boys were used by god to say go to the shops with your own money and buy this woman a loaf of bread they took it as a joke and they gave the woman a loaf of bread and the woman went to a table prepared a nice cup of tea with rich milk nice buttercup and jam and she started to enjoy my brother my sister whom do you think that is it is none other than god praise be to god i'm conscious of my time let's go on to my next life if you return he can't do no more his dad told you so so why don't you sit there till you die the only they only had one opportunity if they go down to the enemy's camp if they spare them they would they'll leave but if they killed them they were just going to die anyhow they was going to die sitting there so they was willing to take the chance why don't you take the chance this evening my brother take the chance of the impossibility and see the end of god in it hallelujah would call it a starvation committee there was already a salvation committee that was set up in syria to say this is the starvation committee this is going to look at possibly who is almost dying those who are still struggling they will say no no we are not going to consider these ones but let's consider those who are on the brink of dying that's why they actually set the commit to form that because it was death after death and the undertakers were no longer providing coffins they were just putting them in out in a trench and just burying them they said we need to set up a committee to cater for this so these ones these lepers were saying can we be put into a trench they said now let's brave ourselves they took a chance and they walked into the enemy's camp what can stop you tonight to walk into the enemy's camp if you're a child of god no matter what the apparent but because you're a child of god if you tell yourself i'm a child of god god will grant you whatsoever you want because you would have realized you are so much determined god god does not want people who are not determined he likes people who are determined if you are serious with god god becomes serious with you hallelujah let's go on my breath works is faith expressed then this story coming this afternoon about a man is probably here now that he was in the prayer line a year ago somewhere and he had said in the discernment was told that he had headed the mumps and the doctors told him after the moms felt that he could never have a baby girl my brother this man had boys but he wanted a baby girl hallelujah it's a desire maybe you don't have a child yourself to begin with you are not saying you are not making a choice you are saying lord just give me a child this is a challenge to you my brother my sister tonight this man he had boys only but he desired a baby girl because he had developed a disease of mums and the doctors i told him you know there's no chance of you having a baby anymore but when he realized he said i'm a man the bible says go out and do what hallelujah replenish go and replenish and you are saying me not going to be able to have a baby girl because i've developed this disease but lord if you once gave me baby boys what can stop you from being giving me baby girls and the doctors told him after the moms felt that he could never have a baby girl and he always wanted one if he ever desire my brother my sister you might have maybe pushed for years without a baby but let me tell you a prophet does not come easy a prophet does not come early samia that's right hallelujah he came after it some time but he became a prophet tonight if you zero your problem along that line god can provide you not tomorrow but today hallelujah the prophet is saying i think he had boys that's my assumptions as well because you just don't have to desire a baby girl when you don't even have a baby another baby other babies but in the vision from the lord he told him but we are going to have that girl baby despite the circumstances of mums if this man had doubted this let's go on my brother if this man had doubted this next slide and he said he's got the little girl here tonight this is the prophets announcing in a congregation that despite those moms and the and the the the what the doctors told you i i don't hate doctors they are urgents of god that's what we are told but they miss because they don't have the spiritual binoculars hallelujah and here the man went with the babe in church the baby girl against all odds then you tell me what type of a problem do you have yourself that god cannot solve if you can solve such a problem this is a magical situation [Music] hallelujah the prophet is saying i don't know the man might he will be in in the audience the person that i'm speaking of somewhere i don't know somebody just told me about it outside oh here's the baby hanging right back there hallelujah right there that's where the baby is that's fine that's very fine what a sweet little fellow it wasn't so far to walk over everybody it's a real cute little baby audrey if i'll ever come out here and give the testimony maybe she'll be sure by tomorrow or sometime when you are having our services my brother my sister the onus is in your hands the onus is in your hands if you have the right mental attitude toward god's word there's nothing that can stop god from granting you your desire we are talking about creation here of a baby girl there are so many so many sisters we have got baby boys but they long to have a baby girl so that they can come ahead dress up nicely i'll tell you one one thing i have got four girls but one day when my wife was in the labor i went to a shop which is called mother mother mother something then i saw a a doll human doll dressed nicely it was a boy dressed nicely then i said lord i desire a baby boy i just want to dress him like this i left it like that i told my wife we have closed the chapter two sisters came to my wife one said sister i dreamt you having a baby boy in your hands my wife told me i said you know what sometimes that sister maybe she slept over a big plate of soda with beans it's no way it's not it's not going to happen you know we we have reached our satiet the other sister came again to my wife and said i dreamt of you having a baby boy she told me i said baby boy leave it like that let them say whatever maybe they are mocking us because we don't have a baby boy two months went by my wife started to behave funny i looked yet here i kept quiet every time she eats he started to vomit i said they've never done this what's happening i don't know i said i'm not feeling well my you know my tummy and they like said okay let's go to the doctor we went to the doctor so i'd sit down here they did the test and everything sat down there said ah congratulations you're having a baby a baby yes i said no i closed that chapter already [Laughter] i didn't believe myself we went for a scan the sex of the babe was determined i said i said you know because i'm always used to having girls i said there comes another girl i said okay fine it's another suit coming to my way when the scan came it was a baby boy i said what i started to jump and kick my heels to say now i'm a man you know how we behave [Applause] and i said let me wait to see if truly is a boy and for sure he came out a boy i said this baby is going to be called isaac and i have my isaac but the war did not end there i told my wife i want to change the diapers myself because i was still doubting i was still checking whether it was a boy god will give you the desires of your heart if you did it for me he can do it for you hallelujah if he did it for this brother he can do for you my brother he begin for this my sister he can still do it for you he is the god who loves us all hallelujah the prophet is saying i will dedicate this baby girl i don't know there's nothing impossible before god don't worry about the many years that has gone by abraham waited for 25 years hallelujah don't worry about what the peninnahs are saying my brother my sister god has got a special package coming your way god has got a special coming your way it's a special package because lo and behold you are a child of god there is no mistake in the life of a child of god that's what they stand for praise be to god hallelujah let's go i won't finish my let's go again perseverant i said well get out of the chair and turn around i'm talking about dr ade and brother branham dr adey desired to build a surgery but he had walked around and he met a lot of frustrations until you know he was a friend of the prophet until he went to him and said brother bill don't you think this city needs a clinic he said yeah yeah it does need a clinic then he said you know i've worked that i need to bring in people and operate them for free your attitude is very important you wanted a clinic to operate people who could not afford so i take it up from there well this is brother branham get out of the chair and turn around it's brother bran i'm telling the doctor there so he did and we got down there and prayed a while they said let's pray about it we waited on the lord about 15 these people these men were serious they were saying we are not going to go until we get our answer we have prayed but let's wait for our answer my brother my sister when you pray endlessly wait and say lord i'm not going to move from here until you answer me we waited on the lord about 15 minutes they were counting 20 minutes after a while the vision come i said this is brother branham doctor stand up you know when when you know what god has told you you talk with authority stand up i said you have found grace with god you are going to build your place your clinic it will be a long building it will be made out of red brick law top and it will almost take in a city block and he looked at me real strange this is now dr day looking in the eyes of the prophet it will not be at the departmental school forget that it's going to be built on the corner of wall in markets market street oh hallelujah god is specific god is specific he's telling him it will be built on the corner of wall and market street your request tonight my brother my sister is going to come with a good description and it will fit whatever you desired [Applause] where that big old house says back on that hill you said just a minute bill i remember you telling me about bill hall this is another patient we had cancer before i haven't got time to go into that about he led him out to be dead with cancer done eat his liver up and all the specialists standing around the doctors had given up and i going squirrel hunting that morning looked and saw a vision of mr hall i went and called him i said mr wall we leave he said the old doctor we have to see that he is living tonight preaching at the milton baptist church the man who was dying of cancer saw and he said i know about will hall and all these things but said bill i just come out of court you know what doubting thomases are he he didn't even respect his prayer with the prophet he didn't believe his prayer with the prophet i just come out of court with that place the one the prophet was mentioning said in philadelphia the owner lives there and there's something about it that it can't be touched for 25 years my brother i don't care how long your problem has been if it's 20 or 30 years i don't care i speak with authority i don't care hallelujah here he's saying the owner lives there and there's something about it that it can be touched for 25 years i said doctor did you ever hear me to tell you anything in the name of the lord that wasn't so it's getting a certain realm now he said but bill that that uh that that i prayed the way maybe when my eye the other eye was open forget about that god heard your prayer he hears what your heart is saying amen i don't want to doubt you i said you're not doubting me you are doubting him if you don't if you start to doubt your prayer my brother my sister you are not doubting your prayer you are doubting god the lord has given you that place now you wouldn't do it if he hadn't already done it see and you're doing that like that but i said he's already given you a place the clinic is going to be there he's crashed his head walked out never said anything next morning this is the prophet my wife sitting there would witness he called me up he said bill i said what he said i'm freezing to death and it's about this time of the year it's really what as much as it is what outside there but doctor there was feeling cold now a certain breeze came upon him it was about this time of day it's really hot in india and i said what's the matter doctor he said you know they're meeting when last night in philadelphia and i've already bought the lot my brother my sister god will cause people to wake up in 3am to convene a meeting because there's a son and a daughter of god who has desired something they'll cause executives to leave their homes and their own blankets and go and convene a meeting to say what are we going to do about this type of land a certain child of god wants it a.m when others are still changing the gears of sleep and others have been woken up by the angel to say if you considered my son job hallelujah in the middle of the night they convened a meeting because the prophet and this son of god had knelt down and prayed and god is saying i will honor that request he said it belongs to me and the clinic is going they there it stands today he said now he's prophesying good if anybody this brother doctor a day if anybody at any time ever doubts anything tell them to call me see in this that's anyway you see my brother what type of a problem do you have that god cannot own amen i'm looking at a situation here it was impossible when god gives you something he gives it as a package he describes the type of bricks doctor there was never gonna use concrete bricks he said the red bricks that's what your building will be like and it will be on the corner of war and market street he's being specific he's just trying to show and prove to you that when god does something he is specific he's coming directly to give you exactly what you asked for hezekiah said give me 15 more years and he was given 15 more years direct what is it that you want quiniest say it with your lips of clay as we rise to our feet let me go
