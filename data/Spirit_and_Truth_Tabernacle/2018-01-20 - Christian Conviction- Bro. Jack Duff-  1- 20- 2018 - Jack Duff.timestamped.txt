[1:01:27] youth here in our area and you know we
[1:01:31] want to be faithful to that we want to
[1:01:34] be faithful next month of the weekend
[1:01:36] that the youth service would fall would
[1:01:38] be the weekend for the West go be having
[1:01:39] the meeting so we'll be there in support
[1:01:43] of those services but then the month
[1:01:45] after that we'll certainly try to be
[1:01:46] right back on track amen so we'll just
[1:01:50] keep those keep the services in prayer
[1:01:52] and the other thing is we we want to
[1:01:54] give opportunity to other young
[1:01:56] ministers to just kind of come and
[1:01:58] present the gospel and you know so this
[1:02:01] is a real nice platform for them so we
[1:02:04] trust that the Lord will just help us in
[1:02:06] our efforts if you always stand with me
[1:02:08] I want to read a man one portion of
[1:02:12] scripture out of the book of Daniel
[1:02:14] chapter 6 you all are very familiar with
[1:02:17] this story and then Daniel chapter 6 and
[1:02:24] we'll start reading at verse 10 it is a
[1:02:27] very good chapter to go back and just
[1:02:30] read over again when you have time but
[1:02:33] for the sake of time tonight we'll just
[1:02:35] read just a few verses Daniel chapter 6
[1:02:38] verse 10 says now when Daniel knew that
[1:02:41] the right
[1:02:41] sign he went into this house and his
[1:02:45] windows and his windows being open in
[1:02:52] his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled
[1:02:55] upon his knees praise the Lord
[1:02:59] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:03:01] thanks before his God as he did a four
[1:03:05] time then these men assembled and found
[1:03:09] Daniel praying and made supplication
[1:03:12] before and making supplication before
[1:03:14] his God then they came near and spake
[1:03:17] before the king concerning the Kings
[1:03:19] decree has thou not signed a decree that
[1:03:21] every man that shall ask a petition of
[1:03:25] any God or man within thirty days save
[1:03:28] of the O king shall be cast into the den
[1:03:30] of lions the King answered and said the
[1:03:32] thing is true according to the law of
[1:03:35] the Medes and Persians which alters not
[1:03:37] then answered they and said before the
[1:03:41] king that Daniel which is other children
[1:03:43] of the captivity of Judah regardeth not
[1:03:45] the O king nor the decree that down
[1:03:48] assigned but making this petition three
[1:03:51] times a day they may unless I just found
[1:03:54] the word of Prayer father we thank you
[1:03:56] for the opportunity to read the word
[1:03:59] thank you for your spirit that has been
[1:04:01] here through this time of worship and as
[1:04:03] we got we're just entering to this
[1:04:05] little thought here tonight we pray that
[1:04:07] you bless it and that you would bless
[1:04:09] the ears that were hear the word of God
[1:04:11] tonight may it make a difference in all
[1:04:13] of our lives in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:04:16] amen god bless you can be seated I want
[1:04:20] to take a felt a man on Christian
[1:04:24] conviction a man Christian conviction
[1:04:29] praise the Lord and and just kind of get
[1:04:34] a start at conviction is a fixed or firm
[1:04:38] belief a man conviction means that you
[1:04:41] have a fixed or a firm belief and I
[1:04:46] believe that's something that all of us
[1:04:48] need to have if we don't have it
[1:04:51] especially the youth a man and
[1:04:53] and in this day and in this time you
[1:04:55] need to have a fix to firm belief on the
[1:04:57] Word of God that God is real a man and
[1:05:01] that we all need relationship with him I
[1:05:04] want to just read a quote here from the
[1:05:07] prophet out of the message witnesses and
[1:05:10] mani makes this statement it says then
[1:05:13] these children of Israel these Shadrach
[1:05:17] and Meshach and Abednego God's witnesses
[1:05:21] God's never been without a witness
[1:05:24] he's always now here I want I want you
[1:05:27] to get this real close God as never at
[1:05:29] any times been without a witness on
[1:05:32] earth he's always had at least one man
[1:05:35] he could put his hands on and say that's
[1:05:38] my witness it's come down to one man
[1:05:41] it's come down to one man one time and
[1:05:43] job was his only witness and Abraham in
[1:05:46] the land but God had a witness
[1:05:48] somebody's going to witness for God
[1:05:51] somewhere now after a while we want to
[1:05:54] find out what a will a witness really is
[1:05:57] of this day all right
[1:05:58] notice these men as they went down there
[1:06:01] they refuse to eat the Kings meat drink
[1:06:03] his wine they refused about to his image
[1:06:06] they were genuine true witnesses of God
[1:06:09] then there's something there then there
[1:06:12] sometimes a penalty goes with a witness
[1:06:17] I think that's something that we need to
[1:06:18] understand there being a witness for God
[1:06:21] don't mean it's going to be easy all the
[1:06:23] time right but it's a decision that you
[1:06:25] have to make that for God I live and for
[1:06:27] God I'll die so then there sometimes
[1:06:29] a penalty goes with a witness sometimes
[1:06:33] when you witness for God you have to
[1:06:35] suffer a little bit a man you have to
[1:06:38] suffer a little bit when you when you're
[1:06:41] going to be a witness for God and
[1:06:42] oftentimes people not ready to sign up
[1:06:45] for that right not the suffering part
[1:06:47] amen I want the blessing part but not
[1:06:50] the suffering part but in order for you
[1:06:52] to get the blessing you got to go
[1:06:53] through some suffering hallo you know we
[1:06:56] wouldn't be we wouldn't be talking about
[1:06:57] Dan your head
[1:06:59] you're not going through the lion's den
[1:07:00] hey man Daniel was a true witness right
[1:07:04] I mean he didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:07:06] give up I love the way the script to put
[1:07:08] it that as soon as he heard the writing
[1:07:11] was signed I mean as soon as Daniel
[1:07:14] heard that these guys that come up with
[1:07:16] the scheme Daniel went to his house
[1:07:19] not like this season and the he es
[1:07:21] conviction right he has a firm belief
[1:07:24] that he's not God no matter what man has
[1:07:26] written
[1:07:27] Daniel gonna continue to put his God
[1:07:29] first hallelujah no matter what the
[1:07:31] government's take Daniel's gonna put his
[1:07:33] God first and I've only did Daniel Amen
[1:07:36] with winning when he heard it Danny went
[1:07:38] straight to his house hallelujah not a
[1:07:40] secret
[1:07:41] Daniel opened up the windows honey when
[1:07:45] he opened up say everybody look in and
[1:07:47] see I'm not gonna hide now one hard
[1:07:49] being ain't gonna hide now I've got
[1:07:52] conviction that my god is still car
[1:07:56] whether you got lawyer you don't get
[1:07:58] love my goddess till God he had
[1:08:01] Christian conviction seating and no
[1:08:04] matter what a circumstance was Daniel
[1:08:06] was able to counter press in and and
[1:08:09] just I'm a great three-time day and you
[1:08:11] can see these guys just coming up and
[1:08:12] just watching the first time the second
[1:08:15] tough second time three we got them out
[1:08:17] of going straight to the King to Tony
[1:08:18] now you know the story they end up in
[1:08:20] that lion's den but he did it because he
[1:08:22] had Christian conviction
[1:08:24] it wasn't easy like the proper say
[1:08:25] sometimes you have to suffer a little
[1:08:27] bit because of your conviction you know
[1:08:29] what when you when you when you're in
[1:08:31] school somebody gonna talk about you
[1:08:32] because of your conviction young ladies
[1:08:35] when you dress in like a Christian hello
[1:08:38] Amen they gonna talk about you because
[1:08:40] of your conviction young man when you
[1:08:42] don't put on the shorts to play
[1:08:43] basketball
[1:08:44] they gonna say something about you
[1:08:46] because of your conviction but as
[1:08:48] Christians we need to have conviction we
[1:08:50] gotta have a fixed it's gotta be a fixed
[1:08:55] or firm belief and what I mean by that
[1:08:57] it can't change because the situation
[1:09:00] changes it can't change because the
[1:09:02] circumstance
[1:09:03] it's got to remain fixed it's got to
[1:09:06] remain fun that this is what I believe
[1:09:09] with my parents are here when they not
[1:09:11] here
[1:09:12] I still believe this fixed and firm
[1:09:16] belief we all need that as Christians we
[1:09:20] need that you know a lot of tech I was
[1:09:22] just you know just thinking on this and
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:26] it seems that our level of conviction
[1:09:29] has dwindled right the things we would
[1:09:34] have never done years ago they're
[1:09:37] starting to be done now because we don't
[1:09:39] have conviction hallelujah now you know
[1:09:43] I you know that there's there's there's
[1:09:45] a conviction I think is a good thing
[1:09:46] wasn't one preacher told brother Brandon
[1:09:49] one time he was the Browns out doing a
[1:09:50] street meeting and now this he said that
[1:09:53] this color brother walked up to him and
[1:09:54] and when he walked up to me yeah he said
[1:09:56] he said you know what the conference is
[1:09:58] if they say yeah I think I know they say
[1:10:01] well what preacher it's like four points
[1:10:03] and they say and these points sit right
[1:10:05] over the top of your heart
[1:10:06] he's saying when you do something wrong
[1:10:08] they turn see that's conviction you feel
[1:10:11] it when it turns you say now now what
[1:10:14] happens is that if you don't yield to
[1:10:16] that conviction to just keep turning
[1:10:18] keep turning until eventually it cut its
[1:10:20] way right through and you don't even
[1:10:22] have no conviction or more so the things
[1:10:24] that you're used to think was wrong now
[1:10:26] you think they okay
[1:10:27] but but you know i'ma tell you before
[1:10:28] you got there there was some conviction
[1:10:30] you just ignore the conviction right but
[1:10:33] God got away bringing that thing all
[1:10:35] back around again but you know but but
[1:10:37] here here's the thing a lot of times
[1:10:38] what will it happen to people that you
[1:10:40] know things that we used to think was
[1:10:41] wrong now we just we don't compromise it
[1:10:43] all the way down today wrong no more let
[1:10:45] me let me go on a little further say he
[1:10:47] says I was hours I was looking at you
[1:10:51] people used to be convicted but if on
[1:10:54] your job they had a little pad like this
[1:10:58] on the job and if you put that pad in
[1:11:02] your bag and took it home conviction
[1:11:05] people would actually fit the pictures
[1:11:07] now some of y'all young people looking
[1:11:09] at me like a little simple piece of
[1:11:11] paper like that I mean if your job had a
[1:11:15] in with the job name on it now you know
[1:11:18] that ain't your pain that your company
[1:11:21] bought that thing right it's got their
[1:11:23] name on it and when people would go home
[1:11:25] with that pen they used to actually have
[1:11:28] conviction because they think that they
[1:11:31] were still in the pen from the company
[1:11:33] oh my god now that is also time where
[1:11:37] people used to feel like they was still
[1:11:39] time from the company but now people
[1:11:42] don't have that conviction anymore
[1:11:44] they'd rather than come into work they
[1:11:47] actually doing everything else but work
[1:11:49] allows that chick-fil-a on last night
[1:11:52] and I saw this lady act like she was
[1:11:54] going to take out the garbage and when
[1:11:56] she got over to the garbage can I saw
[1:11:58] just sitting there fumbling around just
[1:11:59] promise I'm not gonna take that long to
[1:12:01] take out no garbage and before I looked
[1:12:03] at before I realized she was on the
[1:12:04] phone over there talking and she was
[1:12:06] just she was just going on trying to get
[1:12:08] this message across the sunlight
[1:12:09] especially good it didn't work so she
[1:12:11] she stepped outside for a little bit got
[1:12:13] that phone and was talking and I saw
[1:12:15] coming back here huge phone like that
[1:12:17] like that like that tablet she was
[1:12:19] trying to put it inside her pocket I'm
[1:12:21] like if my boss saw that let me tell you
[1:12:24] something about it
[1:12:25] she had partial conviction because the
[1:12:29] processor can fix like she was looking
[1:12:30] around to see who saw her oh my mama but
[1:12:34] when you got real conviction you don't
[1:12:36] go on the job acting like that right if
[1:12:39] you smother put your phone in the lorca
[1:12:41] put your phone in the locker you need
[1:12:44] Christian conviction hallelujah you'll
[1:12:49] keep your job that way all right now see
[1:12:52] so you know but it used to be time that
[1:12:54] people have conviction on so many things
[1:12:57] you know there were certain places we
[1:12:59] didn't go because of our conviction
[1:13:01] there were certain people that we didn't
[1:13:03] hang out with because of our conviction
[1:13:05] there's atlas atmospheres that we don't
[1:13:07] go into because of our conviction and I
[1:13:10] hate to tell you this young people if
[1:13:12] you don't have no conviction your
[1:13:13] parents do and so when you ask them by
[1:13:17] God certain places they say no it's
[1:13:19] because of Christian conviction
[1:13:23] hallelujah no you can't go to that party
[1:13:25] no you can't go to that house no you
[1:13:27] can't do this because of my Christian
[1:13:29] convictions hallelujah see one day
[1:13:33] you're having yourself glory God says
[1:13:35] that we don't use certain language
[1:13:37] because of our Christian conviction
[1:13:40] right amen and just because you know you
[1:13:43] know sometimes our language change when
[1:13:45] we get around certain people but when
[1:13:47] you got Christian convictions no matter
[1:13:49] what they say your dad has changed the
[1:13:50] way that you talk because you realize
[1:13:52] you represent in Christ hello somebody
[1:13:56] and then we didn't take certain jobs
[1:13:58] because of our Christian convictions we
[1:14:01] didn't think we didn't think of working

[1:14:05] conviction we didn't listen to certain
[1:14:07] music we didn't listen to it it wasn't
[1:14:13] on not on our phones because of our
[1:14:15] Christian conviction glory to God amen
[1:14:19] see the Hebrew boys they want to turn
[1:14:21] the bow but they would not bow because

[1:15:54] Christian 24/7 and all over you gonna
[1:15:57] have that is you got to have some
[1:15:58] conviction some stopping points glory to
[1:16:03] God I was I was when I was in Israel I
[1:16:06] was standing in this place called
[1:16:09] Caesarea and and and and they had a
[1:16:13] Coliseum that was there and they talked
[1:16:17] about how this was the ruins of hair at
[1:16:19] the King and and the guide was telling
[1:16:23] me it's telling us telling the whole
[1:16:25] group you say you know in these
[1:16:26] Coliseum's in this place this is where
[1:16:28] the gladiators will come out and they
[1:16:30] will fight and say he's saying some of
[1:16:33] them they sometimes they fight animals
[1:16:35] and and and and went either the gap
[1:16:37] gladiator kill the animal the animal
[1:16:39] kill the gladiator but they were
[1:16:40] fighting to the death and sometimes they
[1:16:42] would fight men but they were fighting
[1:16:44] to the death and as the guy was just
[1:16:46] kind of talking about that I my mind
[1:16:48] just went back to a a testimony you know
[1:16:51] that brother branham is share divided
[1:16:53] his daughter Becky she was reading
[1:16:55] something about the gladiators you know
[1:16:57] one night she's bringing it you know
[1:16:58] bringing out to her daddy and you know
[1:17:01] it she'll tell him the story and brother
[1:17:03] branham saying you know the very first
[1:17:04] sign of Christianity is that you refuse
[1:17:07] to kill another man that was a sign that
[1:17:09] was a conviction that I'm not going to
[1:17:12] kill see I mean those Ten Commandments
[1:17:14] weren't just written just to be written
[1:17:16] but a man they became part of our life
[1:17:18] right I'm not gonna steal no matter how
[1:17:21] bad it gets teal I'm not gonna kill I'm
[1:17:24] not I'm not gonna serve a false God I'm
[1:17:26] not gonna do any of that right I mean
[1:17:28] that this is what you know this is what
[1:17:30] Daniel was standing on saying I'm not
[1:17:32] gonna have any other guys before me I'm
[1:17:33] gonna still preach to my god right see
[1:17:35] he had conviction he was holding on to
[1:17:37] the Word of God what that was
[1:17:38] to him and I saw that so you know
[1:17:40] brother Graham say the first sign of a
[1:17:42] Christian is when they refuse to kill a
[1:17:44] man now back in that time you know what
[1:17:47] I was I'm standing there in the goddess
[1:17:50] telling say that this is a place where
[1:17:51] you know they were just that man people
[1:17:53] would die right here in this pot I mean
[1:17:55] gladdy is just kids fighting to death
[1:17:57] fighting to death and the story that
[1:18:01] brother did brother branham's daughter
[1:18:02] told him say you know she was reading
[1:18:03] about this gladiator that went out and
[1:18:06] and when he went out he they threw out
[1:18:08] through a lion enemy the man he got his
[1:18:11] sword and killed a lion it through
[1:18:12] another lion and we got a sword kill the
[1:18:14] lion they didn't they threw African big
[1:18:18] big African come running up at him in
[1:18:20] and he got that African he got him down
[1:18:22] on the ground somehow and when he got
[1:18:23] him on the ground he took it took his
[1:18:24] story took it right to put it right on
[1:18:26] his neck and then it took the stories
[1:18:28] through it and he walked up into the the
[1:18:32] leaders of that day and he took off all
[1:18:33] of his armor me say as a Christian I
[1:18:35] cannot kill another person I'll kill
[1:18:38] these animals but I cannot kill another
[1:18:40] person you know that's just my
[1:18:41] conviction that I cannot do that and
[1:18:44] when he walked up there you know to the
[1:18:46] to the leaders of Rome that they said
[1:18:49] now you you you being a slave you gonna
[1:18:51] defy Rome they didn't care anything
[1:18:53] about his conviction can see sometimes
[1:18:54] with your conviction you might have to
[1:18:56] stuff a little bit but this man because
[1:18:58] he had had a conviction he say he say
[1:19:00] he'd say he said no I can't do it so
[1:19:02] they ordered the African to get up say
[1:19:04] get up and get his floor and come over
[1:19:06] here and kill him and the African did
[1:19:08] exactly what they accident do but the
[1:19:10] man gave his life willingly because of
[1:19:13] his conviction I want to read a
[1:19:16] testimony a man somebody that's willing
[1:19:19] to give willingly this is out of the
[1:19:23] message life glory to God listen to this
[1:19:28] hallelujah you got to have conviction
[1:19:31] and every everyday God has always got a
[1:19:33] witness and every day and young people
[1:19:35] this is your day God wants you to be his
[1:19:38] witnesses listen in a message life for
[1:19:40] the man who says a few days ago down in
[1:19:42] Ohio
[1:19:42] it says they said that all the children
[1:19:46] had to be sent to college they want no
[1:19:49] illiteracy in Ohio
[1:19:51] and the Amish people don't send their
[1:19:53] children to these modern high schools
[1:19:55] and they've never had on their record of
[1:19:58] all the Amish in history of one one case
[1:20:00] of juvenile delinquency let them dress
[1:20:03] different act different and be peculiar
[1:20:07] and act but they haven't had no juvenile
[1:20:10] delinquency not one case on their
[1:20:12] records of America they don't send them
[1:20:15] to them kind of places and they passed a
[1:20:18] law that they'd have to go they'd have
[1:20:21] to go to their own high schools and
[1:20:23] colleges and the old mother and father
[1:20:26] was called in because they didn't send
[1:20:27] their son and the judge that you either
[1:20:30] send them or you'll serve two years in
[1:20:33] prison I was in Middletown Ohio at the
[1:20:35] time it happened and the father said I
[1:20:37] refuse to do it sir not for being
[1:20:40] different but because that I come to
[1:20:42] America thinking that this was a freedom
[1:20:45] of religion we don't have no more
[1:20:47] democracy freedom of religion he said
[1:20:50] you are either
[1:20:51] abide by our laws or you'll pay the
[1:20:54] penalty like the rest of them would he
[1:20:56] said I refused to send him so he didn't
[1:20:58] want to send his children to these
[1:21:00] public schools I mean they want to teach
[1:21:02] him at home he said I just don't want to
[1:21:03] send them say I refuse to simmer so to
[1:21:05] judge they said I sentence you and the
[1:21:08] mother two years in the penitentiary so
[1:21:11] you don't change because of the
[1:21:12] situation you got conviction look at
[1:21:15] this say the last flower of democracy
[1:21:17] faded in that courtroom the father got
[1:21:21] up and said very well I'll spend it to
[1:21:24] save my son I'll go to prison for my son
[1:21:28] he says I don't want any of your rock
[1:21:30] and roll's in your nonsense
[1:21:32] thank God for a father with conviction
[1:21:35] it says and when he started out the
[1:21:37] unjust judge tried to justify himself by
[1:21:41] saying that remember the scripture says
[1:21:43] give Jesus Caesar what is Caesar's and
[1:21:47] he turned around and said unto God so
[1:21:51] you got to have you got to know what the
[1:21:53] Bible say yea the gifts
[1:21:56] what is Caesar's but I'm also give God
[1:21:59] what belongs to God
[1:22:01] Oh hallelujah
[1:22:04] he was he was ready to go to prison
[1:22:05] because of his connection look at this
[1:22:10] he says he says under God but it bloomed
[1:22:13] again just in a few minutes this whole
[1:22:15] quit the job the judge lost
[1:22:17] everybody on the bench and resigned
[1:22:21] their office God be blessed fulfil
[1:22:23] outstanding Americans yet there what
[1:22:26] should the church to take a stand and
[1:22:28] stand there without moving you got to be
[1:22:31] firm fixed in your belief hallelujah God
[1:22:37] is gone and if it required me to have to
[1:22:40] go to jail because of something I'm
[1:22:41] standing for it and that's just so being
[1:22:43] gotta make a way we got to have
[1:22:45] Christian conviction hallelujah
[1:22:49] hallelujah now stay with me here I got a
[1:22:51] couple of things that I just want to get
[1:22:53] out a man when we when we have this
[1:22:58] conviction you know there it comes at
[1:23:01] different stages in life while I was
[1:23:04] there on the trip there was a sister she
[1:23:06] lives in Australia and she was sharing
[1:23:08] with me how she got saved at and
[1:23:10] baptized at a very young age about six
[1:23:12] years old she was saved and baptized and
[1:23:15] you know she just wanted to serve the
[1:23:17] Lord they're very young age there's some
[1:23:20] young people that ever like that that
[1:23:21] you know man
[1:23:22] once they hear about God they just want
[1:23:24] all of God and there's others that
[1:23:26] struggle they won't God but the world is
[1:23:29] also pulling on right but you got there
[1:23:31] some way some somehow some way you got
[1:23:33] you got to figure out which way is the
[1:23:35] right way
[1:23:35] I remember the Brandon told his son
[1:23:38] Billy Paul he said son put your arms out
[1:23:41] like this it says now son if you go
[1:23:47] right you're gonna be going right but if
[1:23:53] you go left you're gonna be going wrong
[1:23:55] and say and the further you go left the
[1:23:59] harder it is to get back over here so
[1:24:03] you have to make a decision because you
[1:24:05] standing right in the middle which
[1:24:06] direction you're gonna go
[1:24:08] and always remember now if you go this
[1:24:11] way you're getting closer and closer to
[1:24:12] God but the further you go that way the
[1:24:14] further you get away from God now trust
[1:24:16] me you go that way running from God
[1:24:17] he'll find a way to catch you somehow
[1:24:20] someway and you're gonna end up with
[1:24:23] some Christian conviction whether you
[1:24:26] get it now or later but you're gonna get
[1:24:29] some conviction this system was talking
[1:24:32] about how she was just a young girl and
[1:24:34] wanted to serve the Lord and and at six
[1:24:36] years old she remembers that how her
[1:24:39] sisters encouraged her to go to a movie
[1:24:41] and when she went to the movie now I
[1:24:44] mean this was you know years ago movies
[1:24:46] ain't movies back then ain't like they
[1:24:49] are now oh my god if I could just talk
[1:24:51] to y'all just for a few minutes you know
[1:24:53] I mean it's something to see some of
[1:24:55] stuff that y'all see now we used to have
[1:24:56] to have special channels that you had to
[1:24:58] pay for to see that they have Showtime
[1:25:02] and HBO and stuff like that and you had
[1:25:04] to pay to see that and you had to see it
[1:25:06] late at night nowadays they don't care
[1:25:08] about you paying for nothing they just
[1:25:10] go they gonna push it on push it on you
[1:25:12] and in the middle of the day right amen
[1:25:15] but it take conviction say no I'm not
[1:25:16] gonna look at that
[1:25:18] it's just said she went to move in and
[1:25:20] after she fell after she was all just
[1:25:22] whatever the movie was she don't I don't
[1:25:24] she don't remember the name but whatever
[1:25:25] she saw she said don't convicted and she
[1:25:27] said I didn't want to go to the movies
[1:25:28] no more remember the brother brother
[1:25:32] brother

[1:29:26] God can always have a witness every day
[1:29:33] that he has a man on the earth every
[1:29:36] generation God got at least one that'll
[1:29:39] be his witness in Israel one of the
[1:29:44] requirements is that young men and young
[1:29:46] ladies have to go to the Armed Forces
[1:29:48] they have to serve at least two years
[1:29:51] that's that is a requirement you get 18
[1:29:54] you're going to the army
[1:29:56] bottom line young lady I mean I thought
[1:30:00] we went to this was one spot we were
[1:30:02] looking at all the tanks and everything
[1:30:04] that Israel was using in some of the
[1:30:06] wars that they at fault and and they had
[1:30:09] all these young ladies coming behind

[1:30:46] but they were soldiers and as a soldier
[1:30:48] they had to wear pants and you know the
[1:30:51] thing of it is is that really back in
[1:30:53] the Bible days you didn't have any women

[1:37:04] block you you go right on right on up
[1:37:06] just right on over there but you got to
[1:37:07] have something that a
[1:37:09] if you fall asleep at the wheel
[1:37:10] something you'll bump into and I push
[1:37:11] you back in the middle of the road we
[1:37:13] all need that in our life the Holy Ghost
[1:37:16] wants to be your guardrail wants to keep
[1:37:20] you wants to stabilize you there's a
[1:37:24] little statement here that I want to I
[1:37:27] want to read mmm glory to God glory to
[1:37:33] God this is a out of the the message the
[1:37:39] presence of God I'm recognizing as we're
[1:37:41] getting that I just wanted to share this
[1:37:43] a statement from Charles Finney says
[1:37:46] revival is a renewed conviction of sin
[1:37:50] and repentance followed by an intense
[1:37:53] desire to live in obedience to God
[1:37:56] it has given up one's will to God in
[1:37:59] deep humility again revival is a renewed
[1:38:03] conviction and I think that's what many
[1:38:05] of us need us as we're approaching this
[1:38:07] new year we just entered in we need to
[1:38:09] renew conviction right a revival is a
[1:38:12] renewed conviction of sin and repentance
[1:38:15] followed by an intense desire to live in
[1:38:17] obedience to God it has given up one's
[1:38:20] will to God in deep humility the
[1:38:24] statement that the Prophet makes here in
[1:38:25] the presence of God unrecognized he says
[1:38:28] I watched one time at the seashore where
[1:38:31] when was blowing and it was just shaking
[1:38:33] why it wasn't a seashore it was up at
[1:38:36] Lake Michigan I was standing out there
[1:38:39] watching the waves as they would come in
[1:38:41] and and all that sea was a jumping or
[1:38:44] the waters a jumping and the boats are
[1:38:46] rocking I thought what is that going on
[1:38:49] I thought why the lake is having a
[1:38:51] revival that's it it's jumping and
[1:38:54] shaking why there's a rushing mighty
[1:38:55] wind coming down on it I thought well
[1:38:57] you know what there is a one more drop
[1:39:00] of water in it right now than what it
[1:39:02] was when it was perfectly still no more
[1:39:05] water in it just all stirred up well now
[1:39:08] what's it stirred up about you know what
[1:39:11] a stirring up of the water does washes
[1:39:13] all the trash out of it up on the bank
[1:39:17] that's what we need a washing of humble
[1:39:20] out on the bank let the word of God have
[1:39:23] preeminence that's what we need a
[1:39:25] revival and wash all the unbelief out
[1:39:28] and all the bugs and superstitions and
[1:39:30] things come out and see that God is
[1:39:32] still God that's what we have revivals
[1:39:34] for and as we just kind of start this
[1:39:36] year off I pray that the young people
[1:39:39] were in turn to spirit of revival it's
[1:39:41] some stuff that need to be washed it's
[1:39:44] some stuff on your phones need to be
[1:39:46] washed right it's things that you that
[1:39:49] you all have done you know that I mean
[1:39:51] you had you felt them with four points
[1:39:53] you felt them but see what happens that
[1:39:55] when you you feel them if you if you let
[1:39:57] it just go on a little bit too far
[1:39:59] eventually you stop feeling the points
[1:40:01] but God brings it back to your tension
[1:40:03] because he wants you to have Christian
[1:40:05] conviction oh that type of conviction
[1:40:08] don't need mama daddy around that type
[1:40:11] of conviction don't need the past around
[1:40:13] that type of conviction will keep you
[1:40:15] when you're all by yourself like Abigail
[1:40:18] Abigail is kept and she's all by herself
[1:40:21] the only ones standing there in the army
[1:40:24] when they go to take a picture you can
[1:40:26] always fight Abigail but Abigail didn't
[1:40:30] care when she joined the armor side on
[1:40:33] my final but I'm gonna fight in a skirt
[1:40:37] the Lord blessed Abigail and the Lord
[1:40:41] bless all the young people that it takes
[1:40:43] stands like that regardless of what
[1:40:46] criticism comes our way you'll still
[1:40:48] stand for the word of God
[1:40:50] we all need Christian conviction in man
[1:40:56] the Lord bless you let's pray
[1:41:03] while the heads are bowed a man is there
[1:41:12] Amy here tonight and everybody just keep
[1:41:16] your heads bowed
[1:41:19] there is Amy here tonight so brother
[1:41:22] Jack I want that I want that Christian
[1:41:26] conviction I want to be able to take a
[1:41:30] stand
[1:41:33] even when I'm by myself
[1:41:36] the Lord has spoke to your heart tonight
[1:41:39] I just want you to lift your hand right
[1:41:40] where you are and I want to pray
[1:41:43] especially for you tonight I know God
[1:41:48] doesn't speak just to speak but
[1:41:53] oftentimes he's speaking because he
[1:41:56] knows who needs it God sees your hand
[1:42:02] tonight
[1:42:05] God sees your hand I'm gonna pray in as
[1:42:11] I'm praying you just talked to governing
[1:42:13] your own special way from your heart God
[1:42:20] we can we can look back in our lives and
[1:42:22] we can see that there were times that we
[1:42:24] were truly convicted things that we
[1:42:29] would not say places that we would not
[1:42:33] go people that we would not associate
[1:42:37] men but we look now god they're things
[1:42:42] that the enemy is just slowly creeping
[1:42:45] up on us it's like a Python wrapping
[1:42:49] himself around us trying to squeeze the
[1:42:51] very life out of us but we thank you for
[1:42:56] your word we thank you for your voice
[1:42:57] that would speak to us we could look
[1:43:02] back and see people like Daniel we can
[1:43:05] see people like the Hebrew boys who took
[1:43:07] their stand in their day and they they
[1:43:10] were Christians when it mattered most we
[1:43:15] could look at a modern-day Abigail
[1:43:17] that's right now in the army of Israel
[1:43:21] but yet standing on her convictions
[1:43:25] thank God for a young 18 year old girl
[1:43:29] that would do something like that but
[1:43:33] God you want more Abigail's that you
[1:43:35] want more Daniels you want more Hebrew
[1:43:38] boys that will stand in this day and
[1:43:42] there's some hands that have grown up in
[1:43:44] this place that acknowledged that they
[1:43:47] need Christian conviction
[1:43:55] fathers the disciples pre said Lord
[1:44:02] behold they threatened this but granite
[1:44:06] said our servants that with all boldness
[1:44:08] we may speak that word we may live the
[1:44:11] life we may do what is required of us to
[1:44:15] do and we won't be ashamed on the job
