wanted to just encourage us as we are approaching this next week a man and our meetings won't encourage everyone just if you could just put a little time in prayer just ask to the Lord just to meet us here and if God gives you strength maybe you can just put a little time and fasting as well but we just want to see God and man move in the midst of his people we don't know who will walk through the doors we don't know what their needs are but we want God to meet them a man in this place so just a little time and fasting and prayer and I just believe God will honor that a man for someone on this week praise the Lord I'm gonna read a scripture and the Lord just kind of took me back this morning to a sermon that I preached some years ago and I every time I read this scripture just something just stir up in me and I say Lord I I can't get away from now I'm gonna spree chit a man since you started up again in me but let's turn to psalms 18 everyone's standing that can stand the man Psalms 18 3 is the Lord I'll read roughly 12 or so verses actually I think I put about 22 but it should be over 16 start at verse 16 on that a man a man Risa's follow says he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy from and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the Lord was my state see everything else is you know shaky around you but the Lord becomes a stain right he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because why he delivered me because he delighted in me man I love these words ain't not not because I didn't think good he delivered me because he delighted in me the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recommenced me for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and I did not put away his statutes from me I was also upright before him and I like this David said and I kept myself and I kept myself from from mine iniquity I had to say no to some stuff but because I said no God has brought me out into a wealthy place right therefore hath the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight with the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward for thou will save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks and this is a I like this I want to hit this a little bit for thou will light my candle the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness for by V I have run through a truth and by my God have I leaped over a wall ask for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord has tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is God save the Lord I'll or who is a rock save our God it is God that girders me with strength and making my way perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places he teaches my hands to war so that a boar still is broken by my arms thou has also given me the shield of our salvation and our right hand hath holding me up and thy greatness hath made me great and this last verse thou has enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip what a wonderful wonderful testimony that David just writes here for us and every time I read it I just get encouraged and I get inspired and I just I love the word of the Lord I love the word of Lord let's just have a word of Prayer father we turn our attention towards your word thank you for what you've done this far and just a time of a portion various specials that have gone forward to strengthen and encourage our hearts we thank you for that the musicians Lord who surrendered their talents to you got to lead us of music we thank you for that God we realized that it's going to take the word to give us power overcome the enemy so do something for slaughter today and you were speaking God and the only way that you can this in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated I want to a man use for our title he drew me out of many waters a man he drew me out of many waters and and I want to just use for a little inspirational today Sint took drew a man sent took drew a man just a little little tie in here as we prepare for our meeting so next weekend the Prophet speaks this in the message a hidden life in Christ just a couple comments before we get into our subject on the date says and believing after seeing America with this great opportunities it's had for revival and yet it continually gets worse so it alarms me this is my land and I was born here and I love it and I'm wanting to see a great revival in my day and I wish everybody felt the same way I'm warning to see a great revival in my day if we can and it makes this comment now I can't bring that great revival now with all the anointing that was on the Prophet he realized that by himself he could not bring the great revival right he says in no Minister can so we're not looking for a man your favorite preacher to come and bring the revival he spent but but we can put in our part while God brings hit a man church that's that's that's I think it's important that's why we actually a little faxed a little prayer because if we put in our part God will bring the revival amen we can put in our part while God brings it and each one of us has a part to play Amen I'm going on to another sermon here count along the same lines here in this message expectation he makes the comment says now a minister cannot bring a revival glory to God a minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God and His Word and the revival has to come by the people and notice where it starts in your home right in your life glory to God now revival isn't adding new members to the church its reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back hallelujah so we're on the expectation that God gonna bring some things back oh yes Lord amen bring back that old-time Holy Ghost feelings Amen bring back that anointing that destroys yokes bring back that feeling that Amen are people people can't can't can't can't help but go hug they brother and hugged a sister and cry on their necks and do all kind of stuff like that because because a man where the devil try to put the vision God has restored bring back that type of feeling in the church bring back the love come on somebody Amen let's get rid of the way witness and bring back the love for God holy you bring back a man that did them good old days we want to be revived we want God to bring it back brother Branham goes on he starts in that same message I won't read at all you can maybe skip down to paragraph c7 for me just for a little bit and take it down I'm just want to set this up but as brother Branham just talking about this this revival he said he was out on Lake Michigan and he was telling you know that when he was telling the church about this a man in Long Beach California said look I'm a landlocked citizen that meant where I'm at I don't see I don't see these big lakes and doing all this kind of stuff the ocean because of where he lived in Indiana they say I'm a landlocked citizen so so he said well you know things that that that may be coming to y'all it means a lot to me right he say so I come out he say he was there in Chicago on Lake Shore Drive and a man looking at Lake Michigan he say saw the water just kind of getting troubled a little bit Amen that's the water beginning to get a little choppy a little trouble and you know here just weren't saying I what make water do that hallelujah he say he say he said he say there's not anymore water add it to it it's the same water all the time you say but something just began to stir in the water so and sometimes the waters very peaceful and then the other times the water gets very choppy and they say just begin to take a little inspiration from it he began to watch that water just get a little I mean more and more choppy and just running up on the banks and running back out a wave come in a wave go out wait come back in but then he noticed something with those waves they say now when the water gets shopping like that a man the purpose of that is so that the ocean or the lake can actually get rid of its trash come on somebody Amen the purpose is so that that Lake can get rid of the trash that's in it a man so he say every time I wave a big wave would come the wave would be washing trash onto the shore and we are I'm the expectation for a wave of the Holy Spirit and when our wave of the Holy Spirit comes I'm expecting trash come on somebody I want to come after the meetings with my trashcan my spiritual trashcan and I want to get the trash out your life I want to get the trash out my life and we want to put the trash in the trash can hallelujah anything in our life that does not please God let it be washed onto the shore I'm an expectation is trash cleaning sometime we get lost in the things of the world but it's trash cleaning time I'm declaring that oh yeah Lord bring bring bring bring God to send that at that an order to that break the yoke of the enemy you know I was thinking myself I'm so glad folk come to church you don't know how happy I am when I see people come to church but there's only one thing that made me disappointed is when they come to church and they not change we just do my mama go to church so I go to church now then what we talk about it may we come here to get right with God I hate a man seeing people come here sit underneath this word and then leave here and do something against this word that [Music] just that just messed my spirit up can I be honest that's why I'm looking for the trash to get washed a man that the way that we think need to be wash the way that we act need to be wash some of the clothes we wear need to be washed up to the show I'm talk about I'm talking about an anointing that'll make you go home and clean out your closet that's a no I'm not talking to northing that just stay with you in the in here an anointing that will follow you home an anointing that would give you dreams and a anointing that will wake you up at night and an order to that will show you that you don't miss the rapture and it'll cause you to get in a hurry for God amen I'm talking on a norton that will shake you praise god that's what we're looking for that's what we're under expectation for see we had that anointing in my generation hey man I could talk to you about things that that I got cleaned up my life and my generation but I want to see the same God that helped clean me up start cleaning the fourth generation up come on somebody Ami's the same year today today forever if God can change me he can change you you just got to be in the right atmosphere because we stayed in the right atmosphere even when we didn't want to be changed God changed us anyway hallelujah if your mom and your daddy don't put you in the right atmosphere I'm expecting God to on earth every a meant honor their deeds hummina glory to God glory to God we will look watching for the trash to be washed up to the shore it wasn't adding new members but it's reviving the ones that we already had amen you did run well but who ended you hmm you used to be in a certain place with God but I asked the question who handed you we want the hindrances out the way a man if they not ante you let God take them from you can I say it again if they not add until you let God take them from you alright alright Amen so let me just look at this I just actually let me read a paragraph each seven on that a man it says saying well what it must be that the legs haven't revival that's might be what that must be what it is is having a big time just jumping up and down I thought that's good that's fine but you know I thought well wonder if it gets a lot of extra water when it's having a revival I thought no there isn't one drop more in it right now than if it was perfectly calm not one bit it's the same water but just having a revival jumping up and down I thought well that that that well what good does that do come to find out when it's having a revival jumping up and down like that and I'm expecting you know the Holy Spirit makes someone jump up and down right but when is jumping up and down it washes all the trash out glory washes all the trash fresh out of it up on the shore that's what the church needs is a revival get all the world and things of the world why out so it can look clear now look at that not only look clear but be pretty again you want your beauty restorer get rid of the stuff of the world hey man get rid of the stuff of the world amen if you want to be pretty good when it all comes down it got that it's got the same amount of water but what causes the seed to do that is because there's a wind come begins to blow against the waves blow against the body of water and pick it up well that's what the church needs amen tonight is a mighty rushing wind coming down the Punnett again and reviving it and getting all the world out and the things of the world out and and that way then it starts a revival and then when it settles down the churches and the church is all in a condition then to start off then to receive spiritual gifts and blessings of God that's what we want can the church say amen to that that's exactly what we're looking for so you know as we just prepare ourselves for what God is getting ready to doing this place amen my expectation is that true revival will strike and the revival would be the washing of the trash onto the shore that's what we're under expectation for now I want to talk about this a man actually I tell you what let me give me fees in church age and then I'll go back to a couple of things here that I want to hit this has just been a thing and we're still kind of riding this one quote we've been riding it for almost a year and and we brought it right into this this this upcoming meeting so that you'll understand if you hear the minister's preaching in a certain direction I gave them this quotient the Lord leads them down this path then we're gonna welcome that but but but this is what my expectation is this is what I'm looking for hallelujah glory to God look at this revelation 2 4 it says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love and I this is what God is saying to the church I have somewhat against thee because thou has left I first love to understand this you must realize that the Spirit is not speaking - the original saints of ephesus alone so this is something for all of us right this message is to the entire age which lasted about a hundred and twenty years its message then is to all generations in that span now notice he says now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there be there may be no vestige which means no trace no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and that's a very very dark condition that's a very dark condition amen when it gets to that spot and you already know what the rest of the quote says but I want to inject the scripture keep it right there keep it quote there but I want to inject the scripture because we all know that we're seeing this darkness settle upon the people even in the message we have seen this darkness but when I was reading in Psalms 18 I got to verse 28 David said because David was in some dark spots and David said for thou will light my candle hallelujah the Lord God the Lord the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness so in this season since we've seen all the negative I'm expecting the positive and the positive on this negative is then God hallelujah and I said it I said it before my said we have enter into the season of thank God then God likes to fire again and why can't it happen in these meetings why can't we set the expectation for God to do that in these meetings we want to see the then God amen if the rest of the quotas happen what about the end of the quote the den kampf part then God likes to fire again Oh hallelujah and when he Lysa fire again II say the same process is repeated that means there if I would have happened in the first generation a man will be the same revival that are now happened in the fourth generation when God likes to fire again Oh hallelujah and the same process is repeated is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there's any truth to the apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with a truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians alright it keeps degrading but they but they have taken a denomination name and now and are now Baptist Methodist etc that is exactly what they are - they're not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man and I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they're not the same anymore so we're looking for that original fire the then God sees them the original fire to come back into the church that fire cleanses us that fire purchases that fire gets rid of the things of the world you understand that right because when we I mean oftentimes have you see people walk away from this word the first thing creep into the things of the world it's the first thing that's that's an indicator that they needed then God experienced hallelujah I'm under expectation David said forth I will light my candle he says the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness and I was just thinking on that a candle is only needed when things get dark you need a candle in the middle of the day but when things get dark that's when you want the candle you got to have one around otherwise you can't you can't do anything you can't function without the adjust a little bit of light and when you light a candle it has a way of Amen I can I can turn off at night I can turn off all the lights in this building and sometime I've done sometimes in the middle of the day and all the lights off and I'm stumbling around glory to God right but if I had a candle hallelujah a candle actually illuminates the entire room a candle Amen allows me it takes a certain element of fear away from me right I'm no longer stumbling I know exactly where I'm placing my feet hey man sir I ain't gonna bump into a chair and hurt nothing right Amen I know where my feet are going because the candle Amen gives me light for direction hallelujah the candle Amen allows allows me to take another step of faith that the candle just just does so much for the purpose of the candle is to provide light amen and I want to see this I mean we had a God God lit a candle in this day Oh hallelujah I used to be stumbling around in darkness the darkness of denomination I went from the Baptist to the Pentecostal I'm headed somewhere Amen I went from the Baptist to the Pentecostal some of y'all was catholic some of y'all was Methodist some of y'all was all counted stuff some y'all came out of the world but God lit your candle gave you light that you can walk in the midst of the darkness things was darkness layer to see an age but God provided me a light listen and I want to tell the church this morning I'm walking in that light I'm walking in the light come where the dew drops of Mercy of rain shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world Moses walked in the light of his day Moses need his candle lit there was darkness in Egypt but where where that where that where the believers were in Goshen there was light they had their candles lit in their day come on somebody Noah had his candle lit in his teeth and-and-and-and with Noah having this candle in his day Moses having his candle in his day they could make preparation for the destruction that was coming in both of their days and man those in Moses day could put the blood on top of their doors and on the side because they were walking on the light hallelujah David didn't diss record these words for nothing God needs to Amen like somebody's candle if you've been stumbling and darkness no longer you have to do that God will light your candle if I if I if I have a candle and you have a candle if I get my lid you know what you ain't actually got to go through the process that I went through in order to get my lid I might have had to strike some rocks together I might have had to rub some wood together come on somebody I had to work to try to get this thing sparked so I can get my can in there and get it lit well when I get my lit you ain't got to go try to spark it you got to work that hard and anybody that ever worked that hard to get that candle lit amen they don't want to see their neighbor work that hard so what you doing your neighbor bring their candle you don't give them a rock you don't give them a would you just kill them your candle and when my candles lit it can light your candle and what your candles lit if you like the next person stand on hallelujah you need your candle lit and God will light your candle hallelujah see when we talk about your candle being lit I'm talking about you walking in the reveal word for your day that's what I'm talking about there's not a natural thing that we talk but I'm talking about you actually walking in the reveal word for your day that's the light for your day Moses had light for his day he had the revealed word for his day Noah had revealed word for his day God sent a revealed word for your day not only did he sit he took he drew he sent he took he true as David said in Psalms 1860 I mean bring that one out 1816 he said and I and I just want to refer back to it just for a little bit hallelujah he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters I want to just catch those words again instead every time I've read this the first time I first time I read and God inspired me to preach a sermon from it seemed like every time I go back to it I just think on it a little bit more he sent from above he took me drew me out of many waters but let me just I want to coast air a little bit I don't want to get too far ahead of myself so just bear with me this this scripture that we read of Psalms 18 is actually a man also recorded in 2nd Samuel 22 and I want to go back into this pool second Samuel 22 verse 1 through 7 when I start reading this I'll be honest with you it's hard for me to stop reading it because I just began to just kind of reflect on what David is going through but here at the beginning of second Samuel 22 it gives us a little glimpse of what David is experiencing hallelujah look at this verse 1 says and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song so we mean when we when we really think about what I just read he said he took he drew a man this was a song this was a song that David was writing you know he was he was a musician so this was a song that he wrote and and the first time I preached this amen the song still had inspiration because from that song sister Burns wrote a song huh he wrote the song hee hee hee he drew me out of many waters so the so this word still has inspiration come on somebody it worked for David and it'll work for you but but but notice now he says this says in davis-bacon to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul now I want you to get something about this the song could not be written until he went through something I want to tell you you can't write it and you can't tell it until you experience it hallelujah God use what David was going through in order to birth this song a man if God gives you the ability ability to write poems you can't write it and you can't tell it until you go through it come on somebody David wrote it after he went through it now let's look at what Dave is going through verse 2 says and he said the Lord is my rock and my fortress my deliverer now you gotta imagine davidís is in in caves David is hiding from Saul not only stay that hide him from Saul but he got other enemies on the other side a many enemies have him surrounded you know what I feel 9 it may look like it may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by you come on somebody hallelujah Fame it was gone through all these things but David begin to declare he says the Lord is my rock I mean God is my shelter God is my defense God is my everything the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer look at it the god of my rock in him will I trust it says he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my heart our and my refuge he keeps on talking about it my Savior hallelujah I love it David just kept putting commas I got some motorcy buddy I got a little bit more to say about him and he just couldn't think of enough adjectives to describe his God can I read it again the God of my rock in him will I trust look he is my shield , and the Horn of my salvation he's just thinking about it you got to get on the scene you got to get the inspiration of the writer since they say I eat the whole of my salvation , my high tower cometh and my refuge comma Amen my Savior color now famous me from violence think about what he's going through because he was saved from having to do something to solve right I mean God say he say the same thing I'll save it around I would call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies when the ways of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid look at it the sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me and I love this in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears I want you to know that God hear everything you're going through and he will respond to you the same way he responded to David see when you when you when David was writing a man this it was based on the experience that he was having there with Saul and also with some of the other enemies that he was he was he was fighting David had so much that he was going through he depended on God he depended on God and and I think Amen this whole chapter Amen not just the son cuz typically when you're writing a song and you're under the inspiration of writing a song you're writing it based on an experience that you just faced something that was really dear a man to you that's why a lot of times I like when songwriters actually a man present their songs I like to hear a testimony talk about how the song came to you tell us a little bit about that because that song is actually written from an experience hallelujah Amen and if you have you've had it if you've ever written a song and you wrote from your experience then oftentimes you can minister to other people from the things that you went through God allowed that song to be birthed for a reason oh come on somebody well David is writing this what I see in his mind this is a reflection of what God has already brought him through I stay with me here because I why this way I get to sent took drew he say he he sent from above let's read it again Psalms 1816 he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters some time you got to stop and just think about it he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters now now when I looked at that a man Sint took and drew were all past tense there's not where he gonna do this thing is already done so sorry if he sit and he took any truth oh my god this thing was already pre-planned for ordained before I got to the situation's can I just give you a little definition of this sent Amen I went just looked it up a little bit and it says sent means to cause to go or be taken to a particular destination it's the arranged for the delivery of hallelujah and I say especially by mail so I don't know if you've ever been in a situation where you ordered something from somebody and as you were ordering this package it was very important some of y'all maybe have something that you're waiting on a man for the banquet hallelujah can I talk to you just a little bit if you ordered it online Amazon got your package and you know that you've paid for it and if it hasn't arrived by the time that you expected it to arrive then you begin to make telephone calls hallelujah Amen and those telephone calls have a little pressure on them because you want to understand what doesn't happen to your package you're not calling the representative just to say hi y'all go talk to me today you're not calling just to say hi but you have a request I need to know what happened to my package I paid for it and this is my business is my receipt I can tell you that David I pay for I can tell you exactly how much it cost so you begin the question where is the package and if you were the only other if you are on the other end taking the phone call there's one way to diffuse amen the other person that's irate on the other end and the way it diffuses them is that you tell them what the tracking number is because if you can give them a tracking number that shows that the package is not being boxed that shows you that the package is not sitting on the shelf but that shows you that tells him the tracking number says that the package has already been sick and if it's been sick then I can track it through UPS I can track it through FedEx I can get encouraged when I know that the thing has been sick because any day night any day now this dangled arrival my toaster can I tell you something you don't praying about it and God has responded to you this morning that thing they've already been sick you've been praying about your son you can play about your Torah even praying that that bill to get paid it's already been sick I mean to somebody when you find out that something has been said it changes joy expectations hallelujah Amen I ain't wait for them to get this thing packaged up it's already been sent I thought about David when he said these words why would David use the words he said from above you wanna know why David can use words like this because David remembered a time in his life you know I'm talked about before he received his anointed I'm talked about before he received his anointed David was in the field watching God had already rejected Saul as his king you know with me he had already rejected Saul's key and then he told Saul he told Samy say just stop stop even mourning over song he said I already raised me up another King and he's in the house of Jesse y'all stay with me now he said he's already in the house of Jesse and he said he said now what you just take your horn of oil now I remember brother Kerry I'm told us if it's a horn or that meant something had to die in order to get a whole of oil some Ram had to die in order to get this anointing hello Jesus had to die in order for you to get this type of anointing you to get this some of y'all something had to die to give you this so here comes his horn of oil and it takes it down there to test his Houston and Jessica get an axe not now not did you come in peace did you cover me so yeah yeah yeah I come in peace you said we're gonna have a sacrifice here today but but the Lord told me to do something right with you in your house God has a king in your house I want you to stay with me you say said King he said yeah the next king is living in one of your boys gonna be the next without a prophet didn't know which one the Prophet thought it was the first one that came into his presence like he liked this guy to be him look at how he stands he dresses like a king he looks like a God said no no don't look on this outward but look at I'm looking at the heart hallelujah and when you read the scripture amen when when the oil did not pour out on the oldest boy they did a pour it out on the second-oldest the Bible said that seven sons passed before the prophet I'll stay with me seven sons passed before the Prophet but here comes the eighth boy not even considered that he could be a king he is sitting in the field but God had already sent a prophet to his house the man did not even know he was a king in the field but God had already said he's not benefit identification to the house the package was in the house before David got there [Applause] the anak team was waiting on David huh hey man you think you waiting on God God is actually waiting on you God is waiting on you all God needs you to do is show up come out the field come out of whatever it is that you go through come o to the house I got something for you when win-win-win-win up with the prophets and we know that that is David's father nor his brothers even thought of him because the Prophet had to ask a question do you have any other boys so yeah I got one more he's out there he got the lowest job announced he's watching sheep and when he said go get him cuz we're not gonna eat till you bring him here and when they brought David into the house to God God told him if something struck the prophet God's saying I get up this is him this is the one and they had come to oil just seeping all out of the horn on to David his family saw him anointed they knew he was the king but David can write these words that he sent from above now I had I had to piggyback off of that while David was in the field watching sheep God sent a prophet to the north the next king while I was in sin I didn't know it but God had already sent His only begotten Son to die in my stead huh none of that while I was in denominations I had no idea even before I was born before I was born God had already sent a prophet [Music] hallelujah the package was waiting on me they had to come at a that I will walk in and and hear my name being called huh but the package was already sick I didn't have to go to heaven and wonder when the package was going to get here it had already been sent what you need to do is just track it and you went from denomination to denomination what she was doing you were tracking it hallelujah and when you got here to stop when you see my wife stop there no more tracking I got the package and I let's look at this look at this while I was in my denomination that I didn't know God sent me a prophet while we were in the world we didn't know God sent us a prophet but this thing was already sick he sent from above he sent from above sin it's past tense that mean the thing already happened oh my god my god I hope that don't go about head neither did he send it the scripture says that he took me he took me and I looked at the definition of this it's uh it means to lay hold of something with one's hands reach for and hold reach for and hold he took me and and when this came to me I just I thought about you Joseph and I wanted to use you for an example you know mind just stand here with me Pam right here with me he took me means I he reached out for his hand so let me hold your hand the other hand he reached out and he took me [Music] see secret Joseph was just sitting here minding his own business but but I came down from the pulpit and I reached out and I grabbed his hand and I so where I go he go when I stopped he took me when I was laying in sin you know what he did when I was in denomination when I didn't know which way I was going to go he came down and he he took me he took me he took me I didn't take myself but he reach down his hand and he took me I [Applause] didn't even know what I was looking for but God allowed certain situations to happen in the church God allowed certain things are happening in the world may be a relationship went bad but in the midst of that God was reaching down his hand so he could take you he knew exactly where he wanted you to go [Applause] David could say I was in the field watching over my daddy sheet playing my instrument but he sent a prophet to my house and when it when it said the Prophet to my house then the Prophet took me and anointed me with oil and something had to die for me to get this anointed but he took me and all the people that he could have had all my brothers and all my family members and all the church people that I was going to church with he took me took drew this is past tense and sometimes you didn't realize that he it took you he took you out of harm's way you should have been dead and gone but he took you somehow he was there protecting the shield in you when you didn't even realize and even didn't have sense enough to stop and say thank you but he took you David David when facing Goliath could remember where God had took him from and I want to read this out of works its faith Express says David was a with the Shepherd's sling expressed to the whole Israelite army the faith that he had in their God now there was Goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his boast many times bigger than David he had fingers 14 inches long and he was a mammoth big fellow the Philistine giant and here was David the smallest one he was even too little to be in the army too much of a runt they couldn't use him so his brothers was out there the army and then Goliath was making his boast but David now remember it was revealed to David he thought here is the armies of the Living God standing in their own land and there's a boasting uncircumcised philistine out there we'll call him cancer we'll call him paralytic why David was no kind of match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man shoulders was probably 10 12 foot across he was probably standing 14 15 foot high a spear like a weavers needle probably 20 foot long the blade on it maybe four foot across and little David standing there in a little piece of leather goat skin or sheepskin with two pieces of string tied to it see this just this just goes to show us God always work in small things but it's revealed to him revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear that took me out of the paws of the lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised philistine in my hand you gotta think back of what God has already brought you out of what he's already took you from and if he did it before he will do it again his brother's way more able to do it so head and shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them amen there it is they believed it could be done they believe that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David so there's the difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it see this can't be intellect it's got to be a real revelation you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you with what's the odds that maybe worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you so yeah I mean you know oftentimes I want it I want to say this the church I remember other Troy making a comment a few weeks always say what's 1+1 you say 2 and he said who told you that they say I just figured out no you didn't somebody had to teach you what 1+1 was so through your intellect you understand what 1+1 is what 2+2 is and they even give you a little little shapes and stuff right and say now here's one little shape here's another little shape one plus one equal what now you got two shapes they give you all kind of stuff to drill that into your mind hallelujah and sometimes spiritual if you're not careful you can come to church you can hear me quote the Prophet you can you can you can Amen you can have faith and what you're seeing God do for other people but not necessarily have faith for yourself intellectually you know what God did for Abraham intellectually you know what God did for Noah intellectually you know what God did for most you can read that and intellectually get that and you can explain it because you read it in the Bible but do you have faith to believe that the same God can do it for you has he the same way he revealed to Abraham that he was going to have a child huh when all the odds was against him has he revealed it to you because once he reveals it to you come on somebody then you were active Abraham acted when he reveals to you like you revealed to Mary that she was going to have a Christ amen the child Christ then you begin to act like Mary acted hallelujah somebody Mary begin to testify see when they become your revelation you begin to testify about it can I say that again wouldn't become your revelation you begin to testify about it and you testify before it happened otherwise you're still walking in fear you need God to light your candle all right Church glory to God it's just got this thing got to be real it's got to be a river of Revelation whatever whatever you might be going through God is able a man to take care of that situation let me look at this one other thing that I want to I want to bring out here a man the the final where he sent from above and when I when I think about that God sent a prophet to David's house God sent a property in your day and you didn't even know I wasn't even born before the Prophet diet hallelujah can you think about that I wasn't even born before the Prophet diet but what but when I realized in the word that God had already sent it all I had to do is track it that's all I had to do is track it and you don't realize it but you don't you don't track right to where the packages and you rather thought you just stumbled in here no he said he took and then after that he drew yeah and yeah and this is this is this is good because when we talk about being drawn out of many waters just ajust just by using the terminology many waters I have to you know just look at the scripture let me I think it's revelation 1715 let me just grab that real quick hallelujah glory to God glory to God a man a man yes yes revelation 1715 glory to God when I when I think about being drawn out of many waters I reflect on this scripture and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's and multitudes and nations and tongues so so to be drawn out of many waters I was drawn from amongst many people right amen there was a you know when I look back in my own life and I and I just I just think about man I was the denomination's that I went to in the churches that I that I fellowship with and all of that they I did all that and there was I had a lot of friends that was there but when God lit my candle when God began to reveal his word to me and I began to see more things in the scripture hallelujah I wanna I want to make sure we get that I begin to see a little bit more in the scripture hallelujah I begin to realize none is more ten instant than than just dang in the Lions Den it's more to this than just what happened on the ark I mean I can actually I can start preaching from the book of Revelation now I gotta be in church for 40 years and afraid to read the book of Revelation huh amen I understand what these things are because God has sent God has took and now God has true me out Oh glory to God and then God had purpose for bringing me to this light remember I want to go back and say something now remember there were seven boys that passed through the Prophet David would have been the eighth son eight is a powerful number yes eight actually represents two things eight represents the number of new beginning but also eight and is made of two circles and a circle represents eternity it has no beginning nor does it have an ending and eight is two circles Amen representing eternity hallelujah and then so David being not a 'the the other seven brothers would have actually represented seven Church ages but David was the eighth oh my god i'ma just say it and then I read a quote Amen that that'll give us a little help but and it's not a it's not a new age Amen it's not a new age just not when outside the Bible it's just understanding that we're not led to seeing let us see is I blind miserable poor Ritchie naked that is not your condition therefore you must be somewhere else and the Prophet put you there he sit from above and the Prophet put you somewhere else the Prophet puts you in the bride age and the bride age is an eternal age Oh glory to God all right all right let me just read up maybe a little something on that if I can let's see if I got this there was I had a look quote that I want to just bring in and then we'll um I'll uh oh I'm so glad he sent this is that I've heard but now I see let me just bring in this quote denial I'll finish up this he drew he drew me he drew me he drew me drew me out of many waters I could have still been stuck in some of them churches but God drew me out glory be to God glory to God look you say that that critic saying why would why would a God of mercy could open up the Red Sea stand and let them poor Christians eat up with a be eat up with lions and burnt and everything set up just like he laughed about it the poor ignorant did he didn't did he not know except a corn of wheat fall into the ground it had to die through those dark ages like any other corner wheat has the go beneath the earth and be buried to bring forth in the first Reformation them to blaze of Luther the stock it had to come forth in the Westlands out yonder to bring forth to pollen the taxes the great missionary age had to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gifts so God was dealing with the Lutheran's God was dealing with the Westlands God was dealing with the Pentecostals but now God has moved on I mean if anybody in here to know anything about growing up in a constant you know the church left the word you know they did ain't no way I mean there are things that that they do today would have never been done when I was a little boy it would have never happened in the church never you coming in with your miniskirt if you want to you will have a sister with a sheep y'all don't know nothing about that you can dress that way in there huh yeah I mean I you can and I see the Baptist I mean I was Baptist baptized they did anything see back in back in my I'm they talked about back in my day they had homosexual cry leaders so when yet when you went to choir so your mama had to go with you you thought you thought you thought lecture mom was just giving you a ride because you couldn't Drive now your mama was watching the cry director anytime that crowd ready to get a look too close to their child they're right there on talk to me it's the truth in in hi-c I'm a senior in the Baptist Church because they had to pay for the musicians hello because they had to paint they put anything up you have a gay fellow up there playing and he J and he just finished sin and his partner sitting right next to him in the church huh Oh God and then it got worse y'all y'all don't believe y'all probably ain't gonna believe this yeah y'all gonna believe this it got so bad and the reason that they couldn't get rid of them because they found out later on that is a couple people in the church have a relationship with this guy y'all don't believe that do you pastor get caught deacons get caught everybody living in sin in the Baptist Church and still going to church gotta and nothing like that don't you put God and nothing like that God ain't in it they got a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and that's why I can say he sent took drew me out of many waters and right now he's sendin taken and drawing out you just don't realize the packages is on the way to your house glory to God when you turn on the radio it's a package coming sent took drew this quote I was reading here he had to come forth in a Pentecostal for the restoration of gifts almost to the see the very lected cuz see you know we everybody is so in love with the gifts we and that's something I just love God I enjoy seeing gifts and operation but I don't think gifts should control the church I think the Word of God should control the church I mean I got Pete and let me tell you that everybody will not speak in tongues that's not everybody's gift look in the body just look at your body if all your body was a tone what part of the body would be able to pick up something what about it part about it would be able to allow you to walk see you need feet in the body a true a good body I'm talk about not one that's deform it can't all be a tongue it can't all be a tongue right we need some eyes somebody with some wisdom huh we need somebody with some knowledge right amen we need somebody am i touching somebody that got healing flowing through huh we need hands we need feet and also another thing about the body do you need some things that can't be seen you need a liver you need a heart glory to God you need things on the inside working otherwise the outside will do you no good so we want the whole body that God got allowed for the church not just a tongue part we want all of it but I want you to understand we've become to come through a you know just maybe through church where people have put a putting the other parts of the body out so you got one that won't only turn someone that don't want no tongue we want it all but everybody ain't gonna be a tongue Paul said it Paul said it it's in the Bible I think got time to read it but you can go back and read in Corinthians with Paul said it so so church we you know this justice this thing here he said the great missionary age this quote says had to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration of the gifts almost to deceive the very elect looks like what looks like a wheat grain open it up there's no wheat there at all so with all that speaking in tongues all that shouting and you Kirsten so out of the same mouth you blessing curse that's not what I want a man hallelujah and go eat go on a little for at least say I know there's there's there's no weed at all it's only shuck but back in there then they begin to form the one oneness organization the training organization the to destroy colleges and the Church of God organization all organizing just death exactly now what happens but it's a shelter for the weak so your experience inside those churches was a shelter to I got you here to tell you what he sent and then he show you where he took you from and why he drew you out of many ones look at it let's go on he says unless he says and now now what happens but it's a shelter for the weak it's been growing through it all the time now it's beginning to pull away the weeks begin to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is the latter date age this is the bride age this is the evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be fulfilled this is they make says in Jeremiah and the rest of them that joy has spoke of these days this is that day I have heard Lord that and it was coming but now I see it with my church I'm so glad he sent he took and then he drew me out of many waters see the last the last quote that I'll read will be out of smyrnaean church age but let me just finish off with just a couple comments David could reflect when he thought on these words he sees sit from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he can reflect on where he had come from he was forgotten about in the field nobody thought that he would be royalty but God knew he was there God sent the Prophet to his house he was the eighth son that passed before the Prophet which represented a man a new beginning as well as an eternity and and we find also over in Leviticus 23 26 they were to offer for seven days and offering me by fire but on the eighth day they would have a holy convocation see the eighth day you know when you really think about it you know you start with Sunday go from Sunday to Monday Monday to Tuesday Tuesday to Wednesday Wednesday Thursday Thursday to Friday Friday to Saturday you hit seven days but the eighth day we're gonna bring you back to Sunday again how they look you and that's why some of you if you started a stunning ending sunny Sunday you are in an eternity and the eighth day they had a holy convocation glory to God so when we talked about you know we think about just all that all the ages that have gone come forth I mean from from Ephesus all the way to Laodicea amen all those different ages but here we come into what we call the bride age and God has called us back to perfection we thank God for this I can look back like David could look back and say you know what he sent from above he took me I'm just sitting there like Joseph but it came down and just grab my hand and he took me he drew me out of many waters from all the confusion all the nonsense in church he drew me out I'm grateful I'm so grateful this last quote I want to end with here today hallelujah smyrnaean church h-hold is carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back to spoken words see Brides you want and listen to this my sheep hear my voice were and they follow me you want to know why folk you know there's some folk can come to church and then hear me say brother Branham said maybe like what no where are you talking about wait why do you keep doing that why he keep saying it ain't going back there no more but there's others that could come and hear me say the prophets said brother Branham said like now I don't know what to talk about but everything he read about this prophet seemed to be something to it the the person the person that's identifying like that that's the person I've talked about that he's sent he took and he drew me out of many waters come on son I didn't even know how I got here all kind of circumstances was created to get me where I am ah oh my god I can I can reflect like David he said he pluck he drew look at this I'm going further in this quote my sheep hear my voice see and when I say the Prophet said if you're a true sheep of God you know I'm not elevating brother branham you will you will know I'm not elevating a man but as the voice of God through His Prophet hallelujah if you're living in the days of Moses when he went off the scene he told Joshua this book of the law where the what book it along wit did Joshua have it himself where'd it jobs forget the book of the law from a prophet Moses this book of the law shall not depart from my mouth sorry I'm sure Joshua was going around telling people Moses said when God sent a prophet we want to i'm not talk about just a prophet let me put it this way I'm talk about a prophet that fulfilled Malachi for a prophet that would fulfill revelation 10 God had already sent those scriptures before that prophet came and that prophet walks out for filled old scriptures and then he leaves and goes right back to where you come from that's why I could say God's sent from above he's sent just like he's sent a prophet to David's house now the average denomination can't say nothing like that he sent a prophet to David's house while David was in the field knowing nothing and I'm typing that to me I was in the world knowing nothing I was in the church knowing nothing but God had already sent it wasn't coming it would sit it was already past by the time it got to me it was past tense but even with it being pastors this what God already done it was still for me so he sent and then he took and then he drunk look at this my sheep hear my voice were and they follow me capitalizing me is Christ you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there's no change in specie as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh their hat to come a day when we would hear his voice if I could put it in today's message terms just I'm gonna talk about what I'm preaching right now you had to come a day where you tracked the package there had to come a day where you would hear his voice the world and hearing that voice become aware of our Father calling us and recognized that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son son saved me oh my father I am returning to thee and I love this this is a beautiful story that the Prophet gives us they the Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son in fact a lot of true Christians and I love that because you know you can be in denomination to be a true Christian can I say something else that a lot of message folk ain't gonna agree with you can actually receive the Holy Ghost in denomination you want to know evidence that you got it the Bible say the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth that's evidence that you had the Holy Ghost before you got to the message because it led you to the truth and when you got to the truth then you realize he's he took he drew me out of many waters I son of God can go a long time before I recognize that he's a son in fact a lot of true Christians I like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out underhand I mean he was born underneath the hand you know that eagle is a type of a true believer of that true believer well the farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest and he placed it under a hand I don't know why that farmer do something like that but I don't care where you placed me when I come forth I am what I am in due time all the eggs under the hand touched out because the environment was right for the egg to hatch the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he managed to make a living you know I can go along with y'all folks you know for a little bit I mean I ain't really enjoying this but you know I'm here I got a church home you don't say but he was party with I mean he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all but one day from way up in the air just some revelation that ain't never been said before was way up in the air mother ego that had laid the eggs spot that little eagle on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and springed at the top of her voice from Himmler fly out to meet her now now you got to understand mama then go down and pick the eagle up and make the Eagle come up hmm because you know when Eagles are taught to fly what typically happens is mama take them out the nest and take him for a flight and when she takes him for a flight she puts him underneath the wings and and she just go out and it just go soaring and selling it and then it just feels so good like oh yeah my mommy enjoying the rides and then all of sudden mama see she hit it real hard and they fall and when they begin to fall they begin to tumble they begin to tumble and say and maybe one of them get it like stick one wing guys got it mom I got this thing you know but the other one ain't got that kind of faith and in stuff not night and they just tumbling and tumbling all I'm about to hit the ground in all kind of stuff but mama knew what she did and I'm gonna come back around with a nice little swoop and before you're north she just reached out with a flip she got to know if this if there's another one father should reach out with the other flip pick up the other one my man gonna let you fall and if it's another phone she'll get that one with the peach but mama care I'm all right back to safety maybe one guy out I'll out of the four laughs mama that was good I don't need to he'll need no more flying lessons I got this watch this but the others like mama please don't ever do anything like that my heart my heart dropped I had no idea what was going on you didn't tell me you did not prepare me for this ride you didn't tell me anything about it ma so don't do that again mama no your eagle and you're gonna have to learn how to fly so she gave him a little bit more time to just get comfortable maybe next time she put him on the wings they got they like uh-uh I ain't let him go I know what Mommy did last time so I don't let y'all get counseling that she let him take her maybe a couple couple more rocks they're just so comfortable mama then one day she get him and they think they're going for a ride they get dropped again boom you better fly or die and there's something about the eagerness instinct that kicks in and realized that I was made for this I was actually made for this I got God designed my body and built me to be able to fly like this fly what am I talk about flying what'd you talk about I'm talk about flying into the scripture into the deeper things of God understanding everything from Genesis to Revelation hallelujah he said he took he drew she stooped down with tremendous Peter screamed at the top of voice for him to fly up to meet her so this this eagle has got to get up out of condition that they're in they got to make some effort themselves this ego has got to get up and start flying above the rest oh my god when I left my denominational Church that was me as an eagle getting up I had to go tell my pastor not coming back huh come on let me out undid that not coming back where you going oh that's a cult oh is it I don't heard some things that I never heard in my life call it a cult if you won't look at this he had never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try again that mother screamed for him to rise in the wind and follow her as soon as you feel that wind come get up in that when you feel that a North to come get up in that he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he tried baring his wings he hurled himself into the air and answered the cry of his mother he soared off into the blue skies you see he always was an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place and once a true son of God hears the cry of the Spirit by the word say I love that I just that statement means so much to me we talked about it last week you know the change of your body is gonna happen by the spirit by the word yeah let me just you know the music carries a certain spirit and actually different types of music carry different spirits rap music make you want to kill somebody make you want to fight it's almost a message of hatred in the rap right country music make you almost want to kill yourself always talk about somebody leaving in it she won't come back and I just want to drink my problems away it's the same story with all of them huh right rock music wants you to go make you want to bang your head against somebody i'm youjin you don't lost your mind rock music doing that to you hallelujah yeah and you got some girlfriend that you're not supposed to have you put on the arm be trying to set the mood I hope your radio blow up yeah pot or whatever you got huh but but you're trying to say see all type of music I mean it's got different spirits and worship music make you just want to lift your hands in the presence of God and then if you get a little uh what they call uh what the shouting music you put one em on you just read it and drop your broom in your dustpan you ready to cut a step that that music got Spears you know people can be living for the devil and still hear gospel music with a shout and be ready to shout because music carry spirits well I want to tell you not only does music carry the spirits but the Word of God also carries a spirit not just a spirit but these spirits and as you listen to the Word of God them same feelings that come up come upon you with music amen you'll get different emotions when you listen to the word because it arise opinion you be saying Amen and not even wanting to say amen amen where that came from glory it's a spirit in the word and it's a spirit on the word and that spirit was producing the changing your body the same spirit is when you when you when you get into the spirit of the composer the one that wrote it like I said you've given to you you really get into what David's saying here you just stop and just like he's sent a prophet to David's house sitting on the my house he took me he drew me out of many waters all the people that he could have selected I start going back in my mind I just start going back the elementary school in Middle School in high school all the kids that graduated with me all this but he took me I was sitting there too like the rest of them but why did he come down to just grab my hand and come walk with me why did he do that to me it's because of his love I think I read earlier he did because he delighted in me a church I'm so grateful he delighted in me I can't say that for everybody else but I know but he delighted in me and let me take a woman that gets married and when she's so happy about that husband coming to propose to her and she's stepping his ring she is not embarrassed to win that man's ring and she's not embarrassed to be calling his wife she's not gonna feel bad about being his wife did you know so I'm sorry he didn't shushu he chose he chose me and my expectation is that he is only marry me once the true Son of God hears the crowd of spirit by the word he - we realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle that's the Lord Jesus the great prophet Eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters the Lord bless you amen [Applause] let's just have a word of Prayer father we thank you for your word sometimes would we just stopping to think about what it is that is written here in Scripture Lord it's say something that changes us from the inside my prayer God is that has the word has preached that the people realize how special they are to you David was it was shown that he was he was very special he was selected to be king amongst his brothers he was selected to have the anointing that the others could not receive and though they might have been jealous over him and and all that it didn't change
