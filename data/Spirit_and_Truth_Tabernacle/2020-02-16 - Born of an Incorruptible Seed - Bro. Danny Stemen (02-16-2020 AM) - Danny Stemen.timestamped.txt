[46:52] amen glory glory hey man we got one more
[46:57] special this morning sister Birds it was
[46:59] impressive for you to come really tried
[47:28] to get away from it but the Lord I think
[47:31] he's I like to just give a testimony how
[47:39] it came about it was from one of the
[47:43] messages that brother Branham preached
[47:45] where he was given an account of the
[47:50] Lord telling him to speak to the storm
[47:53] and of course he did he follow it
[47:58] through and the elements obeyed him and
[48:02] he was on his way back down the hill as
[48:05] he described it
[48:06] and the Lord spoke to him again and said
[48:10] why don't you walk through the
[48:12] wilderness with me take a walk with me
[48:16] and that just really affected me just
[48:20] hearing that and as I meditated on it I
[48:25] I could just sense the brother branham's

[1:09:52] Columbia appreciates you all Dave man
[1:09:56] made man we thank God for the message on
[1:10:02] last night I am not ashamed of the
[1:10:04] message not ashamed of a message
[1:10:08] and brother McGarry just did a wonderful
[1:10:12] job just talking about our beloved
[1:10:14] brother Paul and and and and now he he
[1:10:19] kept it right with Scripture he kept it
[1:10:22] right with Scripture and just kind of
[1:10:23] showed you some things the different
[1:10:24] mindsets that people have that are
[1:10:27] coming against the reveal word for this
[1:10:29] day the pattern is applicable right so
[1:10:34] when you're looking to see what happened
[1:10:35] there when in Paul's time in Jesus time
[1:10:38] and hopefully you can kind of make the
[1:10:39] transition and see what's happening
[1:10:41] today in your time
[1:10:42] don't worry to go but we're determined
[1:10:45] to stay with this word hey man I don't
[1:10:47] care how many things people try to point
[1:10:49] out hey man no it doesn't mean I'm sorry
[1:10:53] it's gonna take more than a bridge and a
[1:10:55] bear to detour me
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:00] you talk about a vision at two years old
[1:11:03] two years old that's what you're telling
[1:11:05] me about did you have a vision at three
[1:11:08] years old don't take more than that
[1:11:12] right so I'm determined I'm not ashamed
[1:11:15] of this message and I'm also not ashamed
[1:11:17] of the messenger
[1:11:20] praise the Lord I always ask this
[1:11:24] question say if brother Branham is not
[1:11:26] the fulfillment of Malachi 4 and a man
[1:11:29] in this revelation 10 in Matthew 17 if
[1:11:34] he's not the fulfillment of these
[1:11:35] scriptures then you need to tell me who
[1:11:36] is right because there's got to be me
[1:11:40] larger company for the great and
[1:11:41] terrible day of the Lord so Eve I must
[1:11:44] stay away from them but I just
[1:11:46] appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm grateful
[1:11:48] for the word a man that has been brought
[1:11:50] to us and on yesterday morning brother
[1:11:53] brother Steven came to us and this
[1:11:55] morning a man he's back to preach amen a
[1:11:59] little bit more praise the Lord and
[1:12:02] [Applause]
[1:12:03] again I thank God for the friendship a
[1:12:07] man that I have in brother steamin and
[1:12:09] we've preached meetings together we we
[1:12:13] play golf together a man and we just you
[1:12:17] know and sometimes you just need another
[1:12:19] pastor friend you can just bounce things
[1:12:21] off of and you know he's just been that
[1:12:24] way for me and I just I just really
[1:12:26] really appreciate him and you know we
[1:12:28] just we think we thank God for the
[1:12:30] fellowship that we have and this morning
[1:12:33] actually before brother Steven even came
[1:12:36] over the enemies start attacking him
[1:12:38] with a tooth a man that just began to
[1:12:41] just throb and paint
[1:12:43] and but yet he comes and he preaches the
[1:12:47] gospel and mostly I would not even know
[1:12:48] that he's standing here in pain
[1:12:50] preaching right in pain but I love when
[1:12:55] a man a man will do that and and not
[1:12:59] necessarily look for sympathy from the
[1:13:00] people but you know he just wants you to
[1:13:02] pull with him so we can all just defeat
[1:13:04] this devil together
[1:13:07] our scene brothers demon preach
[1:13:11] and lose his voice in the midst of
[1:13:14] preaching and just stand up and almost
[1:13:17] just mouthing words you can barely hear
[1:13:20] what he's saying and in the midst of
[1:13:22] preaching because he was faithful God
[1:13:25] would restore his voice right there in
[1:13:28] the midst of the service while he's
[1:13:30] preaching so the same God that restored
[1:13:33] his voice I believe was able to take
[1:13:36] care of that tooth this morning praise
[1:13:39] the Lord
[1:13:41] so as our brother just prepares to come
[1:13:44] I want you to just again pull on the
[1:13:45] Word of God a man this morning don't
[1:13:48] just sit and stare but enter in and

[1:16:23] are in the sight of God how much worth
[1:16:25] you are to him even so much more amen
[1:16:30] brother BAM said if I held a drop of his
[1:16:31] blood and a cup and think about how

[1:17:23] but a man but it was really good my bad

[1:17:36] [Music]

[1:17:46] fellowship we've had today man thank you
[1:17:49] brother Jack amen and amen the Lord is
[1:17:51] good and we want to take a little
[1:17:55] subject this morning I had thought that
[1:17:57] I would just continue on with Jeroboam
[1:18:01] but I don't think I'm going to but we
[1:18:05] might bring him up but I want to just
[1:18:08] title this to see this morning it could
[1:18:11] be this evening I don't really know why
[1:18:12] man but when I title this born of an
[1:18:15] incorruptible seed
[1:18:18] amen amen if we're turn in our Bibles to
[1:18:22] the book of Ephesians to
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:44] let's look at the 19th verse now
[1:18:47] therefore you're no more strangers and
[1:18:50] foreigners but fellow-citizens with the
[1:18:53] Saints and of the household of God and
[1:18:56] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:19:00] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[1:19:03] Himself being the chief Cornerstone I
[1:19:07] mean that's what we appreciate in a true
[1:19:09] ministry that God has given us is that
[1:19:12] it built upon the right foundation we
[1:19:15] know where we stand we know in whom we
[1:19:18] believed a man there's no question
[1:19:22] there's no fear brother Rama said Paul
[1:19:25] being the master preacher that he was
[1:19:29] that he came to knock the fear out of
[1:19:32] the people he could be saved today and
[1:19:34] you could be lost tomorrow we don't have
[1:19:36] that fear Amen we don't even have that
[1:19:39] concept as a church amen some churches
[1:19:43] believe you can be saved and lost again
[1:19:45] but not this church and when our
[1:19:47] foundation is right let me tell you they
[1:19:49] meant you can stand here and have no
[1:19:51] fear and the devil knows he cannot
[1:19:54] prevail over you
[1:19:56] amen what a church amen I want to I just
[1:20:00] want to add this amen
[1:20:03] to what was said last night was such a
[1:20:05] masterful service but you know the
[1:20:08] ministry excuse me the world doesn't
[1:20:11] want a ministry that preaches the
[1:20:15] predestinated seat of God they don't
[1:20:18] want a ministry that and I will let you
[1:20:21] sit in a minute but they don't want a
[1:20:23] ministry that teaches it's wrong for a
[1:20:25] woman to cut her hair and it's wrong for
[1:20:29] a woman to preach they don't want a
[1:20:30] ministry like that they don't want to
[1:20:32] listen to hear a man say that he saw a
[1:20:36] pillar of fire coming and to him and
[1:20:39] they want to make him out to be some
[1:20:41] kind of criminal and a deceiver you
[1:20:44] don't want a ministry like a they don't
[1:20:45] like the prophets message on marriage
[1:20:48] and divorce and they certainly don't
[1:20:52] believe this message on serpents Sea
[1:20:54] right they they don't like his message
[1:20:58] on the Trinity as he was not a
[1:21:00] trinitarian but he correctly taught the
[1:21:03] Godhead and it was rejected by the
[1:21:05] church which he preached it to that's
[1:21:08] why they said he was crazy that's why he
[1:21:10] said they got off at the end a man they
[1:21:13] don't like to hear him say that he went
[1:21:15] beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:21:17] preached the mysteries of God they
[1:21:19] didn't want that kind of ministry even
[1:21:24] now even then some people made him out
[1:21:26] to be God but by the end of his ministry
[1:21:29] most men had left him most ministers
[1:21:33] didn't want his ministry because the
[1:21:35] strange doctrines were too hard to be
[1:21:37] understood amen
[1:21:41] you might be thinking I'm talking about
[1:21:44] brother Branham but I'm not I'm talking
[1:21:46] about Paul we said that sounded just
[1:21:52] like brother Branham didn't it you know
[1:21:56] why he came in the Alpha he's coming the
[1:22:00] Omega 2 same God same spirit same pillar
[1:22:06] of fire raised the Lord Church and when
[1:22:09] he's preached last night I just thought
[1:22:11] of this when he preached last night he
[1:22:13] said well we'll pause brut be there and
[1:22:14] will they will it will Paul may be
[1:22:16] judged on what Paul preached he says yes
[1:22:18] he will I said well if Paul groups make
[1:22:20] it my group's gonna make it - hallelujah
[1:22:23] cuz I preach what Paul preached a man
[1:22:27] hallelujah god bless you let's read one
[1:22:30] more scripture amen
[1:22:33] I'm having a hard time reading this
[1:22:35] morning but that'll be alright
[1:22:37] 1st Peter 1:22
[1:22:52] seeing you have purified your souls in
[1:22:56] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:23:00] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[1:23:04] that you love one another with a pure
[1:23:06] heart fervently being born again not of
[1:23:11] a corruptible seed but of incorruptible
[1:23:15] by the Word of God which liveth and
[1:23:19] abideth for ever you can be seated amen
[1:23:24] amen we thank the Lord for what he's
[1:23:30] doing with us thank the Lord for amen
[1:23:33] this church amen what God is doing here
[1:23:36] and I know sometimes it can become a
[1:23:39] slog amen and in ministers mind you like
[1:23:44] Lord and you know things are hard and we
[1:23:47] know churches go through seasons and we
[1:23:49] go through our ups and downs and we go
[1:23:51] through our dry times and you know
[1:23:54] brother Jack and labor and labor and a
[1:23:56] service and in a fault and maybe for
[1:23:59] weeks and and and you know it put a lot
[1:24:01] of time and effort into the study of
[1:24:03] what he's preaching and it seems
[1:24:05] sometime you know maybe the people are
[1:24:07] not responding like he would hope they'd
[1:24:09] respond you know maybe in the way that
[1:24:11] he received it and he's like you know
[1:24:14] you know it was just so good to me and
[1:24:17] when they you know they're sleeping and
[1:24:19] then the one I thought it would help
[1:24:20] they didn't even come and and I'm like
[1:24:23] you know what is this this effort that
[1:24:26] I'm put in here God what are you doing
[1:24:27] and then then you have a man come like
[1:24:29] brother Aaron or another minister and
[1:24:31] they're preached one service and the
[1:24:32] people here say the same thing brother
[1:24:35] Jack said and the people will receive it
[1:24:37] as from God and and but they didn't
[1:24:41] realize all that hard work and plowing
[1:24:43] prepared you
[1:24:45] to receive that moment and that's that's
[1:24:48] what it means to be a pastor is you got
[1:24:51] a plow and there's a lot of rocks in the
[1:24:54] church that have to be unearthed and
[1:24:56] there's a lot of roots you know I had a
[1:24:59] shade tree that I loved that was over my
[1:25:01] whole house and you know my drove my
[1:25:03] bill and my electric bill down and
[1:25:05] everything but something so beautiful
[1:25:07] can also become something harmful and it
[1:25:10] became I had a root system it went right
[1:25:13] into my kitchen and into my plumbing and
[1:25:15] my floors begin to crack and everything
[1:25:18] I had to take the tree down that was
[1:25:20] hard work and and we got it tore down
[1:25:22] then we got the stump grind it out and
[1:25:24] then then I put a porch back there but
[1:25:26] you know what amen
[1:25:27] where that tree used to be everything
[1:25:29] began to fall apart again they packed
[1:25:32] the earth but where the roots was they
[1:25:34] rotted out and died and then they fell
[1:25:36] in so there's still the effects of it
[1:25:38] and that's what a church is like you
[1:25:39] just got to deal with things and move
[1:25:42] through things and and I believe brother
[1:25:44] Jack as a pastor you're a special person
[1:25:46] that it that you know nobody likes to be
[1:25:49] called a cow but you know that's what a
[1:25:54] pastor's you know he's an ox you know he
[1:25:59] wants to be the eagle right brother I'm
[1:26:03] the Evangelist I see things amen but
[1:26:07] then God has to have them cows it's just
[1:26:14] yeah pastor sure stupid he just looks at
[1:26:17] me you are the best words of advice I
[1:26:21] found in council because I say I'm just
[1:26:23] going to go off the cuff here a little
[1:26:24] bit but you know I found out that
[1:26:26] counseling people doesn't work really
[1:26:28] good because they didn't really want it
[1:26:31] they wanted sympathy not counsel and I
[1:26:34] found out the best words you can ever
[1:26:36] tell somebody in council is what my dad
[1:26:38] always it'll be alright in that right
[1:26:43] brother Aaron you know I you know my
[1:26:45] life is falling apart I've lost my job I
[1:26:47] have no money in the bank I can't put
[1:26:48] food on the table my wife's gonna leave
[1:26:51] me I'm sick I can't come to church
[1:26:53] anymore either it's gonna be okay
[1:26:59] you know I because if you'd come back to
[1:27:02] the word it will be okay
[1:27:04] amen so I want to preach this morning
[1:27:07] and if you just just bear with me and I
[1:27:10] might go a little slow and end up quick
[1:27:12] that I want to just just reiterate a few
[1:27:16] things to you but but brother branham
[1:27:18] made a statement he said the more that I
[1:27:21] travel he said I see that people are not
[1:27:25] getting to Christ he said they're being
[1:27:28] pointed to the wrong odd object he said
[1:27:32] they're being pointed to a church
[1:27:33] they're being pointed to a party I mean
[1:27:37] now I had a party in the room above me
[1:27:40] last night and it went to all hours of
[1:27:43] the night we even called down to the
[1:27:45] front desk they didn't do anything about
[1:27:46] it was rock and roll and screaming
[1:27:49] hollering going on banging on the floor
[1:27:50] had to be right above me I'm in 310 it
[1:27:54] was 410 and that's not the party he's
[1:27:57] talking about he's talking about where
[1:28:00] we're men make a doctrine a party and
[1:28:03] then they point to that and said except
[1:28:04] you come to that you have not come to
[1:28:07] Christ but actually it was a Jeroboam
[1:28:10] thing put up before the people where
[1:28:12] they're pointed to that and he said
[1:28:14] they're not getting to Christ he said
[1:28:16] they're getting them to a creed they're
[1:28:17] getting them to a church they're getting
[1:28:19] them to a doctrine but they're not
[1:28:21] getting them to Christ now we know
[1:28:23] Christ has dr.
[1:28:24] it falls like do it comes distilled like
[1:28:27] do but God's doctrine is different than
[1:28:30] men's doctrine because God's doctrine is
[1:28:33] nutrients God's doctrine is something
[1:28:35] that falls upon the seed and that seed
[1:28:38] begins to express itself
[1:28:40] that's what doctrine will do true
[1:28:42] doctrine will do that man's doctrine
[1:28:44] will make you look like him
[1:28:46] God's doctrine will make you look like
[1:28:48] him say man brother BAM said that any
[1:28:52] true message at calms he said it comes
[1:28:55] in the ways of signs and wonders he said
[1:28:57] it'll attract your attention he said if
[1:28:59] it does not do something new and take
[1:29:01] you out of the system he said it's not
[1:29:04] from God right so I mean that you could
[1:29:09] even have a supernatural work amen but
[1:29:12] if it didn't take you out of the system
[1:29:13] it wasn't God
[1:29:16] that is the purpose of God sending us
[1:29:20] Malachi 4 not that we could look like a
[1:29:22] church again but that we could come back
[1:29:25] into the image that God had before the
[1:29:28] foundation of the world which is him hey
[1:29:32] man let me just read you some scriptures
[1:29:34] you already know but I'm gonna read them
[1:29:36] to you brother Jesus or excuse me John
[1:29:38] wrote in John 3 there was a man of the
[1:29:41] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:29:43] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[1:29:46] said unto him rabbi we know that thou
[1:29:50] art a teacher come from God for no man
[1:29:53] can do the miracles that thou doest
[1:29:56] except God be with him jesus answered
[1:30:00] and said verily I say unto you except a
[1:30:03] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:30:06] kingdom of God
[1:30:07] Nicodemus said how can a man be born
[1:30:10] when he's old can he enter the second
[1:30:11] time into his mother's womb and be born
[1:30:14] jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[1:30:17] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:30:20] of spirit of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:30:23] into the kingdom of God that which is
[1:30:25] born of the flesh is flesh that's a
[1:30:28] corruptible seed that which is born of
[1:30:30] the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I
[1:30:33] said unto thee you must be born again
[1:30:38] man now the wind bloweth where it
[1:30:40] listeth and you hear the sound thereof
[1:30:42] and you can't tell whence it cometh and
[1:30:44] whether it goes so is everyone born of
[1:30:46] the Spirit
[1:30:47] and so Nicodemus answered and said how
[1:30:49] can these things be jesus answered and
[1:30:52] said are you a master of Israel and
[1:30:54] knowest not these things so you'd
[1:30:55] understand this his brother Aaron was
[1:30:57] saying last night and when Jesus came he
[1:31:00] came telling them things they'd never
[1:31:01] heard of before they looked at him says
[1:31:04] well we know you're a teacher come from
[1:31:06] God but brother Branham said that Jesus
[1:31:08] never referred to himself as a teacher
[1:31:10] because he would become he would be a
[1:31:13] teacher after his resurrection but he
[1:31:16] wasn't coming to teach at that time
[1:31:17] though there was teaching he was coming
[1:31:20] to be the Lamb of God he was coming to
[1:31:24] show them amen what the new birth would
[1:31:27] be and without his death and
[1:31:29] resurrection there would be no birth and
[1:31:32] I want you to know that Jesus would not
[1:31:34] ask you to do something that he himself
[1:31:37] has not personally experienced you know
[1:31:42] we're so caught up in this age and you
[1:31:44] just kind of speak to the young people a
[1:31:46] little bit we're so caught up in our
[1:31:47] careers and what we're trying to do and
[1:31:49] in our careers becomes more important
[1:31:52] than church and the Word of God and it
[1:31:54] is important I understand you have to
[1:31:57] put food on the table but it's never
[1:31:59] been and never will be more important
[1:32:02] than the principles of God never be more
[1:32:06] important than missing church that I
[1:32:08] have to miss church to further my career
[1:32:10] in fact you would think that every
[1:32:13] action of Jesus from the time he was
[1:32:15] born to the time he died would be
[1:32:17] choreographed and written and every
[1:32:19] action would been put on display but God
[1:32:21] himself never wrote much maybe one thing
[1:32:25] two things about Jesus's life before the
[1:32:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it is
[1:32:33] what he was when the Holy Spirit came
[1:32:37] upon him that began to fulfill and come
[1:32:41] to his purpose
[1:32:42] before that God never even wrote about
[1:32:45] himself in a human body
[1:32:51] except as he was his 12:00 in the temple
[1:32:54] they called it the silent years but in
[1:32:56] that time he humbled himself but when he
[1:33:00] came he would not come and fulfill who
[1:33:03] he was without the Holy Spirit coming
[1:33:05] upon him and neither can you fulfill who
[1:33:08] you are without you being born of that
[1:33:11] incorruptible seed hmm
[1:33:17] so I thought it was profound that God
[1:33:20] himself would not write much about his
[1:33:22] life until after the Spirit came upon
[1:33:28] him Acts 2:36 I just read a few
[1:33:32] scriptures here and we're getting into a
[1:33:35] little story if we can with the help of
[1:33:37] the Lord therefore let all the house of
[1:33:42] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[1:33:44] that same Jesus whom you crucified both
[1:33:47] Lord and Christ
[1:33:49] now when they heard this they were
[1:33:51] pricked in their heart and said unto
[1:33:52] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[1:33:53] and brethren what shall we do then Peter
[1:33:56] said to them repent and be baptized
[1:33:59] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:34:04] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:06] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:34:08] children and to all that afar off even
[1:34:10] as many as the Lord our God shall call
[1:34:12] Paul said in first Corinthians 12:13 for
[1:34:15] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[1:34:19] one body whether it be Jew or Gentile
[1:34:21] whether he be bond or free we've all
[1:34:23] been made to drink into one spirit amen
[1:34:27] so you see Jesus came says you must be
[1:34:29] born again
[1:34:29] Peter come says you must be born again
[1:34:32] amen Paul comes you must be born again
[1:34:36] you see brother Danny you say I must be
[1:34:38] born again yeah you must be born again a
[1:34:42] man acts nineteen one it came to pass at
[1:34:45] my Apollo's at Corinth and Paul having
[1:34:47] passed through the upper coast came to
[1:34:48] Ephesus and finding certain disciples he
[1:34:51] said unto them have you received the
[1:34:53] Holy Ghost since you believed now I want
[1:34:56] to tell you this there's nobody who's
[1:34:58] ever received the Holy Ghost without
[1:35:00] believing
[1:35:02] there's nobody just showed up and didn't
[1:35:04] care and they say I received it you
[1:35:09] might have been under the effect of it
[1:35:11] but you never received it you can dance
[1:35:14] you can shout you can run the house you
[1:35:16] can sing you can be healed you can have
[1:35:18] testimonies but until you believe you'll
[1:35:22] never receive and Paul said have you
[1:35:27] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:35:31] believed they said we don't we have not
[1:35:35] so much as heard whether there be any
[1:35:37] Holy Ghost now I just want to say this
[1:35:39] if you're a seed of God and the word has
[1:35:41] been revealed in your our God is
[1:35:43] obligated not to leave you back in a
[1:35:47] revelation that has not progressed it is
[1:35:50] God's obligation to bring you before the
[1:35:53] promise to fulfill the promise you say
[1:35:56] well you know it's got to be my effort
[1:35:58] yeah faith without works is dead but if
[1:36:00] God brought you to this age he had to
[1:36:02] bring the answer to this age and he
[1:36:04] brought you here to meet the challenge
[1:36:06] of the age and it's God's obligation to
[1:36:09] bring you across that promise
[1:36:10] so it can be fulfilled but you have to
[1:36:13] believe it so they said now we've not so
[1:36:18] much as heard whether there'd be any
[1:36:19] Holy Ghost and they said unto them he
[1:36:21] said unto them what to unto what then
[1:36:24] were you baptized they said under John's
[1:36:25] baptism so they were baptized unto
[1:36:27] repentance and so this is old this is
[1:36:31] very familiar to you but I just want to
[1:36:32] run across this before we get to our
[1:36:34] message maybee said well we were
[1:36:35] baptized into John's baptism you know
[1:36:38] John was a true prophet
[1:36:39] amen was a true ministry but he was
[1:36:42] pointing to the one that would have the
[1:36:44] true baptism amen he could only bring
[1:36:47] him so far he they had to come to the
[1:36:49] person of Christ hey man they said now
[1:36:54] he said then she said he very light
[1:36:56] verily baptized with the baptism of
[1:36:58] repentance saying unto the people you
[1:36:59] should believe on him which had come
[1:37:00] after him that is on christ jesus when
[1:37:03] they heard this they were baptized in
[1:37:05] the name of the lord jesus and when paul
[1:37:07] had laid his hands
[1:37:09] on them the Holy Ghost came on them and
[1:37:11] they spoke with tongues and prophesied
[1:37:14] amen what was it
[1:37:16] Amen everyone every one of these men
[1:37:20] have the same thing in common
[1:37:22] you cannot Amen amen walk with God
[1:37:26] without a personal experience so I'm
[1:37:32] preaching on being born of an
[1:37:33] incorruptible seed but the subtitle is a
[1:37:36] personal experience with God so when
[1:37:39] brother Branham said I look and I see
[1:37:42] that this big hint this hindrance has
[1:37:43] been thrown in front of the people and
[1:37:45] it's the enemy that threw it in front of
[1:37:48] them he said because he's not the object
[1:37:51] it been pointed to they've either been
[1:37:54] pointed to a Dogma a doctrine a party
[1:37:57] and experience a sensation or something
[1:38:00] instead of being pointed to Christ the
[1:38:02] word now I'm gonna I'm gonna quote
[1:38:05] something here and I don't I don't want
[1:38:07] to put my own understanding to because
[1:38:12] that's not really that important I want
[1:38:14] to go further than that but the random
[1:38:16] said in serves as this the time he said
[1:38:20] he said one of the mysteries that's to
[1:38:22] be unveiled in this day is the baptism
[1:38:25] of the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:38:28] now I'm not finished with that quote but
[1:38:31] I will say this that there's people took
[1:38:34] that quote and made us a bunch of
[1:38:36] Baptists
[1:38:41] okay so I believed it so I got it and
[1:38:45] and they never they never understood
[1:38:49] what brother Branham was saying so he
[1:38:51] said he said the Holy Ghost with out
[1:38:55] sensation but the person of Jesus Christ
[1:39:01] so you have to meet the person of Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ now when he said sensation he's
[1:39:06] not saying okay you're not going to feel
[1:39:08] anything you're not gonna know it you
[1:39:10] know because I have never seen brother
[1:39:12] Jack an age produced so many people say
[1:39:14] they got the Holy Ghost but don't know
[1:39:16] when if I was born naturally I can tell
[1:39:25] you where I was born I tell you I can
[1:39:28] show you a certificate I can take you
[1:39:30] not to the room but I can take you to
[1:39:31] the hospital there's a record people
[1:39:40] just show up I yeah I got it I just
[1:39:43] don't know when I met him I just didn't
[1:39:45] know it
[1:39:51] let's just brother Branham says God will
[1:39:55] never meet with man nowhere else but
[1:39:59] under the blood when you turn the blood
[1:40:02] down then your meeting place with God
[1:40:04] has been taken away God made his first
[1:40:07] decision in the Garden of Eden that man
[1:40:09] would only worship Him under this what
[1:40:12] is this for God may double-barrelled
[1:40:22] this morning amen
[1:40:24] he said he said now that's the only
[1:40:27] place that God will meet with man then
[1:40:29] the only place that God ever met with
[1:40:31] man under the shed blood the only place
[1:40:33] he meets with man today is under the
[1:40:35] shed blood of the sacrifice I don't care
[1:40:37] if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:40:39] if you can forget your differences Roman
[1:40:43] Catholic whatever you might be and you
[1:40:45] come under the shed blood God will meet
[1:40:47] both of us there that's where we can all
[1:40:50] meet and fellowship on the same grounds
[1:40:51] but
[1:40:52] otherwise he will not meet you because
[1:40:54] you're a Methodist he will not meet you
[1:40:56] because you're Pentecostals he'll meet
[1:40:59] you under one condition that's the shed
[1:41:01] blood when your sins have been confessed
[1:41:04] and expelled in his presence then by the
[1:41:07] blood and the blood is always before him
[1:41:10] and therefore he can only see you
[1:41:13] through that shed blood and you're white
[1:41:15] as snow when you've confessed your sins
[1:41:18] otherwise you're not there you cannot
[1:41:20] fellowship he said that's the reason you
[1:41:23] don't see things happening in the
[1:41:25] churches they confess they believe the
[1:41:27] blood but they reject the very plan to
[1:41:30] get to the blood which is the word so
[1:41:36] notice the church says they believe the
[1:41:38] blood they sing about the blood but they
[1:41:40] reject the plan of the blood so then
[1:41:44] they cannot be under the blood is that
[1:41:47] true this is why we're not a
[1:41:49] denominational people because they sing
[1:41:53] about the blood they believe in the
[1:41:55] blood but they reject the plan of the
[1:41:57] blood and the plan of the blood the
[1:41:59] blood is the revealed word that is the
[1:42:02] life of Christ amen you might come
[1:42:06] you're never honor that word and come
[1:42:08] and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand
[1:42:09] this to be done you can't do it
[1:42:11] Methodist Baptist Pentecostals you can't
[1:42:13] do it the only way you can do it is
[1:42:16] under the mercies of God through His
[1:42:18] grace is to come through the shed blood
[1:42:21] of Jesus Christ and say Lord I claim
[1:42:24] that promise and if you are really under
[1:42:27] that blood God is obligated to that word
[1:42:32] a man so we're coming to you this
[1:42:35] morning we're not coming to you in the
[1:42:36] name of a church we're coming to you
[1:42:38] under the blood of Jesus Christ when we
[1:42:41] come under the blood of Jesus Christ God
[1:42:43] is obligated to his word all if you can
[1:42:47] understand brother and sister that when
[1:42:49] you come before God and believe Amon and
[1:42:51] you're coming under the blood God is
[1:42:53] obligated to keep that word amen to fill
[1:42:57] you with the Holy Ghost to give you the
[1:42:59] desire of your heart you don't have to
[1:43:01] sit back and wonder but you can believe
[1:43:03] right under the hour that call is plenty
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:10] hey man he says no wonder they don't
[1:43:12] believe in miracles no wonder you can't
[1:43:14] believe in the supernatural no wonder
[1:43:15] they condemn it the same reason they
[1:43:17] condemned it back there is the reason
[1:43:19] they condemn it today they're guilty as
[1:43:21] guilty can be because it's only under
[1:43:24] the shed blood he goes on to say in the
[1:43:28] message marriage and divorce as God
[1:43:30] brought the word down through the ages
[1:43:32] he says notice a man he can put her away
[1:43:35] she cannot put him away he proved it in
[1:43:37] the days when Luther Wesley and
[1:43:39] Pentecost when they refused to become
[1:43:41] the further part of him by having a
[1:43:46] spiritual sexual affair to become
[1:43:49] pregnant with further part of the Lord
[1:43:51] what has he said they refuse to walk on
[1:43:53] in sin relationship with God and take
[1:43:57] his word into themselves so that they
[1:44:00] could be changed I'm saying all of this
[1:44:05] you come back to one basic point you see
[1:44:06] why God had to send a prophet hey man he
[1:44:11] said why because you if you've not been
[1:44:13] a denomination a man you understand it
[1:44:15] was it was a house of hell it was cells
[1:44:18] jail cells and people bound and changed
[1:44:22] and and they were diseased and they were
[1:44:24] wanting to be free but it could not be
[1:44:26] free in another in another vision
[1:44:28] brother our dream brother Branham had
[1:44:29] was a woman which was a type of the
[1:44:31] church was trying to get up off the
[1:44:33] floor and a man kept beating her down
[1:44:35] with a three-cornered claw the DA a
[1:44:37] doctrine it may not just be three cards
[1:44:41] that might be in the denominations but
[1:44:43] around the realm of the message it's
[1:44:44] other clubs that are used upon a woman
[1:44:47] that gets beat down in fear and she's
[1:44:49] hearing the word she tries to get up and
[1:44:51] faint but it's beat down again you
[1:44:53] imagine well you're not supposed to
[1:44:54] listen to preachers only push play even
[1:44:57] though I get beat down with Hannah
[1:44:58] because if I receive it from brother
[1:45:00] Danny and not brother branham I'm not
[1:45:02] receiving it as pure as for I'm sorry
[1:45:04] that is people without the Holy Ghost
[1:45:07] because the Holy Ghost will say only
[1:45:09] what the word said brother man never
[1:45:16] asked me to come in this hour and say
[1:45:18] the the the the the and read every quote
[1:45:20] exactly the same but what he did say is
[1:45:22] you have the same spirit I have you'll
[1:45:24] not change the services that you've got
[1:45:27] it'll be the same God the same spirit
[1:45:30] even bringing the same word with the
[1:45:33] same results brother chap under the Holy
[1:45:39] Ghost you can preach this message in
[1:45:41] Souls will be born again brother
[1:45:45] Anderson under the Holy Ghost you preach
[1:45:47] this word souls are born again why
[1:45:51] because it's incorruptible seed not
[1:45:58] corrupted by men the corruptible seed is
[1:46:04] man so he said that there he said they
[1:46:11] refused to come further part so what
[1:46:16] happened in the Bible he takes the he
[1:46:19] takes the story of Esther said what
[1:46:22] happened when when Vashti refused to
[1:46:24] come out with a king and a man he said
[1:46:27] he said the church he said he put her
[1:46:29] away he said it's the same with the
[1:46:30] church that refuses become pregnant in
[1:46:33] the age that we now live in to bring
[1:46:35] forth children of this age we are not
[1:46:39] Lutheran's we are not Wesleyan neither
[1:46:43] are we Pentecostals
[1:46:45] we've gotta be children of this age
[1:46:47] through the pregnancy of the word of God
[1:46:51] Peyman the pregnancy of the Word of God
[1:46:53] is being born again by an incorruptible
[1:46:56] seed you notice how he says it Amen that
[1:47:02] true born-again experience only comes
[1:47:04] under the revealed word this might be
[1:47:11] controversial to you but I'll say it you
[1:47:16] mean brother Danny I can't be born again
[1:47:17] in the Baptist no they refused it
[1:47:21] brother Branham indicted the system said
[1:47:27] they crucified the word how can you be
[1:47:29] born again where it's been crucified you
[1:47:33] said my brother Danny had a real
[1:47:34] experience with God I do not doubt it
[1:47:35] because if you're a seed of God he will
[1:47:37] pull you out hallelujah
[1:47:44] hey man so now he went right on
[1:47:46] revealing his word to the body and
[1:47:48] vindicating the same by himself and his
[1:47:50] children begin to kind of look more like
[1:47:52] him because it's fully maturing and they
[1:47:55] become children of the word you know you
[1:47:57] know Luther looked more like Christ but
[1:48:01] he did not look like Christ right he
[1:48:07] still had a lot of Roman Catholic
[1:48:09] tendencies he received revelation about
[1:48:14] the communion but there was a lot of
[1:48:16] other things that he still held on to
[1:48:18] I've been to his home I've been to where
[1:48:20] he was and I've seen his pray up into
[1:48:22] Wittenberg I've seen the door I've seen
[1:48:24] these things and it was a wonderful man
[1:48:26] of God but you know you go there today
[1:48:27] him in the Roman Catholics identify with
[1:48:30] him a man named and say the Roman
[1:48:35] Catholics say the protest is over
[1:48:38] you know I they come back because if you
[1:48:41] don't fully come out you go back you say
[1:48:46] but I understand how people could leave
[1:48:48] the message you go back to the world cuz
[1:48:49] they never came out
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:52] they came out port waving and they went
[1:48:54] back they tried to receive it under the
[1:48:57] wrong thing that's one of the mysteries
[1:49:01] today not receiving it amen he said
[1:49:04] receiving the Holy Ghost without
[1:49:05] sensation what is he saying there amen
[1:49:08] brother what is he saying that he's not
[1:49:10] telling you you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:49:11] thing they don't feel it because he goes
[1:49:13] on to say 1964 him in the Holy Ghost in
[1:49:16] brother Aaron preacher last night is a
[1:49:18] definite experience with God definite
[1:49:22] means hey you knew it happened define
[1:49:26] define you define something you know if
[1:49:29] it's it's confused it's kind of blurry
[1:49:30] but define you see clear I know I met
[1:49:34] God I know he changed me Mike changed
[1:49:36] from death unto life the evidence you're
[1:49:38] looking for is Amen look at what you was
[1:49:41] and look at what you are hey man I've
[1:49:44] been changed from death unto life my
[1:49:45] desires they may have changed there's an
[1:49:48] anchor inside of me that I could a man
[1:49:50] even if I wanted to walk away I cannot
[1:49:53] walk away hallelujah I've got the Saints
[1:49:56] heed Peter had Lord to whom shall we go
[1:49:59] you alone have them so then what is the
[1:50:07] mystery the baptism Holy Ghost without
[1:50:08] sensation the mystery of the baptism the
[1:50:10] Holy Ghost without sensation is the
[1:50:11] mystery is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:13] without the intervention of man whoever
[1:50:19] men are they try to put their part in
[1:50:24] how it should be always try to
[1:50:27] manufacture so he said it's the mystery
[1:50:32] of the baptism the Holy goes without
[1:50:35] sensation but the person of Christ
[1:50:36] performs in you the same works he did
[1:50:39] what is he saying then write to her
[1:50:40] brother and sister he's saying that the
[1:50:42] life of Christ is in you like it was in
[1:50:45] him but I've never told you something
[1:50:48] strange he just quoted to you Romans 8:2
[1:50:50] same spirit it was in Christ dwells in
[1:50:53] you
[1:50:53] you know also quicken your mortal body
[1:50:55] let's go to Genesis 25 I won't tell you
[1:50:58] a story
[1:51:05] you know the devil has battled us this
[1:51:08] whole time we've been here I want to say
[1:51:12] brother Jack I'm glad to be here I'm
[1:51:14] glad it's here to meet with brother
[1:51:16] Aaron and the fellowship that we've had
[1:51:18] and and with you all amen and III have a
[1:51:25] well don't even worry about it
[1:51:28] I got a situation in my body that keeps
[1:51:32] getting worse and worse I want to tell
[1:51:33] the devil he's a liar he's a liar he's
[1:51:40] only hitting what he can can't hit the
[1:51:45] things that God has taken Genesis 25 21
[1:51:52] and the Isaac entreated the Lord this
[1:51:54] let me tell you a story now okay
[1:51:56] Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife
[1:51:58] because she was barren there you go
[1:52:00] brother Jack brother Aaron because she
[1:52:02] was barren and the Lord was entreated of
[1:52:04] him you know Lord will be entreated of
[1:52:07] your Berenice it's it's the Lord's
[1:52:11] obligation that you don't come in empty
[1:52:16] that's the Feast of the Tabernacles you
[1:52:18] shall not come before God empty all
[1:52:23] right
[1:52:24] so God God a man he will deal with
[1:52:28] bareness the Lord was entreated of him
[1:52:31] and Rebecca his wife conceived and the
[1:52:34] children struggled together within her
[1:52:37] and she said if it be so why am i thus
[1:52:40] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[1:52:43] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[1:52:46] in that womb two manner of people shall
[1:52:48] be separated from my bowels and the one
[1:52:50] people shall be stronger than the other
[1:52:52] people and the elder shall serve the
[1:52:56] younger
[1:52:58] amen now as I read the quote in in in
[1:53:06] the reason I pause here I'm just trying
[1:53:08] to find a place where I want to come to
[1:53:10] so as I've read that quota for the
[1:53:12] random where he said so one of the
[1:53:13] mysteries to be revealed
[1:53:15] time is a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:53:16] without sensation so it's a Baptist the
[1:53:19] holy ghost
[1:53:20] without tradition right but the Word of
[1:53:23] God and full effect upon you so we want
[1:53:26] to spend a little bit of time of that
[1:53:27] which is a person of Jesus Christ the
[1:53:29] full Word of God not the full text book
[1:53:31] but perfect interpretation with divine
[1:53:35] you understand that what you believe
[1:53:37] is the perfect interpretation of the
[1:53:40] word not intellectual conception but the
[1:53:46] perfect interpretation work with divine
[1:53:49] vindication this message is divinely
[1:53:51] vindicated you say well I don't believe
[1:53:54] it I think the vindication you're
[1:53:56] talking about it was a light in the
[1:53:57] ceiling it was a rocket in the air it
[1:54:00] was your explanation doesn't move me
[1:54:10] amen now now that word intervene where
[1:54:18] it says that the Holy Ghost without
[1:54:22] sensation and I said that it was that
[1:54:24] it's without the intervention of man
[1:54:26] that word intervene means to come or to
[1:54:30] come or to occur between two times or
[1:54:33] events it's something that gets between
[1:54:36] a time and an event that's what
[1:54:39] intervene means gets between a time and
[1:54:42] an event it means to become involved in
[1:54:44] something such as a conflict in order to
[1:54:47] have an influence on what happens this
[1:54:50] is what intervene means to get involved
[1:54:52] in something to have an influence on
[1:54:54] what happens Satan loves that word to
[1:54:58] get involved it also means to happen
[1:55:02] something that happens to an event or
[1:55:05] that causes a delay it means to come in
[1:55:09] between by way of hindrance or
[1:55:12] modification so intervention is
[1:55:16] modification we modify we make it
[1:55:19] different than what it was now I'm
[1:55:24] trying here to find my place let's talk
[1:55:28] about this
[1:55:29] family for just a little bit this couple
[1:55:31] Isaac and Rebecca who have we believe
[1:55:34] have been brought to earth to fulfill a
[1:55:36] very important part of the puzzle of God
[1:55:40] if you will that God's mystery is
[1:55:43] brother branham pointed back and he said
[1:55:44] and he'd point back to those types in
[1:55:46] this in the scripture they said their
[1:55:49] shadows and types of God's great mystery
[1:55:52] and the plan he wanted to fulfill and
[1:55:54] Isaac and Rebekah was a very big piece
[1:55:57] of the puzzle that you could understand
[1:55:59] what God was trying to do
[1:56:01] Rebekah is a type of the bride she had
[1:56:05] supernatural things take place in her
[1:56:07] life where she didn't realize it at the
[1:56:10] time but there had been prayers prayed
[1:56:12] over her by a prophet she didn't know it
[1:56:15] was her specifically but he said Lord
[1:56:17] let the woman that comes out and water
[1:56:20] give me water will also water my camels
[1:56:22] let this be the one and Abraham had said
[1:56:26] the same angel that was with me that
[1:56:28] angel will go with you and and so she
[1:56:31] was going to be under the influence of
[1:56:33] angels she was going to be a prophets
[1:56:35] prayer a man and brother BAM said the
[1:56:37] angel of the Lord was at the well of
[1:56:40] Rebekah's a half hour before Eliezer got
[1:56:44] there so now here is Rebekah at the well
[1:56:47] she's under the influence of this angel
[1:56:50] something was changing her atmosphere so
[1:56:52] that when that messenger came in from
[1:56:54] Abraham's house she just received it not
[1:56:58] only she receive it she went farther in
[1:57:00] the vision just the way he had asked let
[1:57:02] her also water the camels and he looked
[1:57:04] at her and said could this be the one so
[1:57:07] she's a very important part of the
[1:57:10] puzzle explaining God's purpose at the
[1:57:12] end time because brother Branham said
[1:57:13] she became one of the queens of the
[1:57:17] Bible she wasn't at the beginning but
[1:57:21] she became one because she agreed with
[1:57:24] the word you know as long as you sent
[1:57:27] here you may have message terminology
[1:57:30] message understanding but if you have
[1:57:32] not let the word go through you you're
[1:57:34] just a church
[1:57:35] you're not the bride rather Ram said the
[1:57:39] church is becoming the bride by letting
[1:57:42] the word go through her you know Jesus
[1:57:45] himself would not come to earth and say
[1:57:47] I'm the I am the author of salvation no
[1:57:49] he never said that he said the Bible
[1:57:51] says he became the author he became how
[1:57:58] did he do it he humbled himself in
[1:58:00] obedience
[1:58:00] you know God Amen knows everything he's
[1:58:03] omnipresent omnipotent he covers all
[1:58:05] time and space but Jesus as a man says I
[1:58:07] only do what my father shows me Jesus as
[1:58:09] a man did not know everything to
[1:58:13] sympathize with you to take every bit of
[1:58:16] who you are upon himself so that you
[1:58:19] can't sit here today and say Jesus does
[1:58:21] not understand he understands more than
[1:58:24] you've ever understood Oh help me now
[1:58:27] hey I'm a man here tonight today and I
[1:58:31] don't understand the temptation of the
[1:58:32] perversion that's out there where a man
[1:58:34] wants to go live with a man I don't
[1:58:36] understand that but I'm gonna hurt your
[1:58:38] feelings Jesus does I don't care what he
[1:58:48] gives you I had a pastor tell me that he
[1:58:51] had a man in his congregation with a
[1:58:54] family and with children start an affair
[1:58:58] with a man and denominations who was
[1:59:00] also married with children and they they
[1:59:02] were having a homosexual affair and
[1:59:05] neither one of them wanted to be in it
[1:59:06] and they tried to get out of it we got
[1:59:08] back by going to psychologists trying to
[1:59:10] get help and they couldn't get help they
[1:59:12] tried to change and they couldn't change
[1:59:14] one day that passes on the phone with
[1:59:16] that man and that man screaming at him
[1:59:19] you don't know what it's like to be
[1:59:20] tempted and you don't know it's like to
[1:59:21] be tempted by homosexuality and and that
[1:59:24] pastor says you know what you're right I
[1:59:25] don't I don't he said then I felt a tap
[1:59:27] on my shoulder he said the Holy Spirit
[1:59:29] says you tell him I do
[1:59:34] hey I want to tell you you don't
[1:59:36] understand that you don't want to
[1:59:37] understand my tell you when that word
[1:59:38] went over that phone I do he said it got
[1:59:41] quiet and that man broke down begin to
[1:59:44] weeping right there that man was
[1:59:45] delivered came in one word for God to
[1:59:49] let you know I know where you're at
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:58] Jesus was not a homosexual no jesus
[2:00:00] never lived in perversion but he knows
[2:00:02] what it's like to be a high priest she
[2:00:04] knows what it's like to take upon it
[2:00:07] when he was on the cross brother Jack
[2:00:08] crying hey let me tell you I'm getting a
[2:00:11] little bit away from Rebecca right here
[2:00:12] but this is still talking about a true
[2:00:13] birth so you know when Paul said great
[2:00:16] is the mystery of godliness you thought
[2:00:18] it was just understanding dogma
[2:00:19] no it wasn't understanding dong or creed
[2:00:22] or doctrine about the correctness of the
[2:00:24] Trinity or the correctness of the
[2:00:25] Godhead no it wasn't that you didn't
[2:00:28] understand that your car became man and
[2:00:32] knew what it was like to pray and not
[2:00:34] have a prayer answered amen to feel lost
[2:00:37] to fall on the ground to need another
[2:00:40] man to pick him up again he knows what
[2:00:43] it's like to be sick
[2:00:45] that's my god ah brother Danny what he
[2:00:52] taught talk about the incorruptible seed
[2:00:56] you think this message is weak you think
[2:01:00] this message is weak I'm gonna tell you
[2:01:03] how a weak this message is there was a
[2:01:05] man came out two men came out in and out
[2:01:09] time and they were condemned to die and
[2:01:15] they'd never known Jesus the RAM said
[2:01:18] they never met him the Bible said they
[2:01:21] were criminals and that word criminal
[2:01:24] means they were violent criminals
[2:01:26] violent men they never met Jesus the
[2:01:28] only time they ever saw him was Jesus
[2:01:31] being dragged and staggered and falling
[2:01:33] through the streets they never saw the
[2:01:35] hand of John saying behold the lamb of
[2:01:37] God they only heard crucify him crucify
[2:01:40] him saw men beaten they saw man crying
[2:01:45] I saw a man needing help but the devil
[2:01:50] made a mistake hey man he allowed he
[2:01:56] anointed that man so much he anointed
[2:01:59] you knowing that Pilate so much that he
[2:02:01] wrote down King of the Jews Jesus of
[2:02:05] Nazareth King of the Jews and the Bible
[2:02:09] tells us both of these criminals are
[2:02:11] crucified on either side and both of
[2:02:12] them are screaming at Jesus and mocking
[2:02:14] him both of them are mocking every devil
[2:02:21] in hell is there to crush that life of
[2:02:24] Jesus and it's under that atmosphere
[2:02:27] under that pressure under that
[2:02:28] crucifixion and them thieves are
[2:02:30] throwing this in his face but that one
[2:02:33] who has a seed enemy keeps looking and
[2:02:35] something keeps Jesus of Nazareth King
[2:02:38] of the Jews something he gives to catch
[2:02:41] him the only word he would see called
[2:02:45] his heart because no matter if it was an
[2:02:50] unbeliever wrote it down what he wrote
[2:02:52] was the truth he was told about an
[2:02:57] incorruptible seed and Jesus at his
[2:03:00] weakest Jesus as a man grind my God why
[2:03:10] have you forsaken me Jesus at his
[2:03:12] weakness was able to save that criminal
[2:03:18] you think this message is weak here's a
[2:03:22] man who's crying out
[2:03:25] I'm forsaken you know why he said my God
[2:03:30] why have you forsaken me you know why he
[2:03:33] said it because he has so fully become
[2:03:36] you he knows what it's like to feel lost
[2:03:40] it was when your sin hit him
[2:03:43] he says you forsaken me I mean if you
[2:03:46] said here is it old calling forsaken
[2:03:48] I've crossed the line I can't give back
[2:03:50] to God that's why he cried that he cried
[2:03:53] it so you cannot be forsaken he cried it
[2:03:56] so you could sit here on Sunday morning
[2:03:58] say you know what I believe that and
[2:04:00] because I believe I'm gonna receive
[2:04:02] cause I believe I'm gonna receive
[2:04:04] because I believe he's gonna come upon
[2:04:06] me him in that weak man that died there
[2:04:09] his life his life that weak man that
[2:04:12] never said there's nothing to this
[2:04:13] message he's weak he can't do you think
[2:04:16] he's gonna rise again on that prophet it
[2:04:18] was a good message as long as william
[2:04:20] branham us hee-haw I want his message oh
[2:04:22] he was he was a part of it but it went
[2:04:24] here it was from God this message is a
[2:04:27] power of Resurrection or you may think
[2:04:30] it's weak right now you may think it's
[2:04:32] gone into the dirt you may think it's
[2:04:33] gone to the ground amen
[2:04:35] but I rise again not a weak message
[2:04:45] shows the character of it that when his
[2:04:47] hands were pinned and his feet were pins
[2:04:49] he could still say today he'll be with
[2:04:53] me
[2:04:57] you don't think this word is powerful
[2:04:59] Amen an unbeliever and unbelieving King
[2:05:02] can say King of the Jews Jesus of
[2:05:03] Nazareth King of the Jews and that was
[2:05:05] enough right there to ignite that seed
[2:05:06] in that man because it was a truth it
[2:05:15] was a truth
[2:05:16] now here's Rebecca who's barren and
[2:05:20] Isaac has entreated the Lord and the
[2:05:22] Lord is her ears here's his prayer and
[2:05:26] in Rebecca's pregnancy the children
[2:05:28] struggled together in the womb and he
[2:05:31] prompt her to ask the Lord that if this
[2:05:33] pregnancy is really of you why do I have
[2:05:36] this struggle you know brother Jack it's
[2:05:39] human nature to think that if God cannot
[2:05:42] be in something if it's a struggle we
[2:05:46] don't understand this struggle but the
[2:05:48] Lord was faithful to reveal to her in
[2:05:50] that time he said that it was two
[2:05:52] nations in her womb and that the
[2:05:55] separation had already begun in her body
[2:05:58] and that the elder was serve the younger
[2:06:03] we don't understand the struggles that
[2:06:05] we have because the separation has
[2:06:08] already begun we don't want the struggle
[2:06:11] but the struggle is necessary to fulfill
[2:06:14] the word so the birth of Esau and Jacob
[2:06:18] it not only was a struggle in her womb
[2:06:22] it caused the separation in Isaac and
[2:06:24] Rebekah and affected him both at how
[2:06:28] they looked at the prophecy of God God
[2:06:31] himself had prophesied the elder shall
[2:06:33] serve the younger
[2:06:36] the prophecies holy the prophecies holy
[2:06:41] the elders have served the younger but
[2:06:44] look at this their parents had favorites
[2:06:47] and because they had favorites it
[2:06:50] influenced the way they dealt with their
[2:06:52] children now I could go off and start
[2:06:54] pastoring on that right there because
[2:06:56] they had favorites they influenced how
[2:06:58] they dealt with their children now you
[2:07:00] understand one of them is a vindicated
[2:07:02] prophet there there's a queen of the
[2:07:04] Bible
[2:07:08] but one the vindicated prophet will
[2:07:11] become will become so influenced by his
[2:07:15] like that he'll be deceived you know
[2:07:23] this is really gonna hurt somebody but
[2:07:25] brother Branham said that many times
[2:07:26] prophets are wrong and many times they
[2:07:30] are deceived oh that went right against
[2:07:35] your idea of what a prophet is in I want
[2:07:39] to tell you what a prophet is he's a man
[2:07:41] of like passions like you are and here's
[2:07:46] a prophet Isaac who his favorite is Edom
[2:07:52] who God says I hate God hates him but
[2:07:57] the Prophet loves him and that means
[2:08:00] that if a prophet loves his son he could
[2:08:02] handle him wrong now that'll preach
[2:08:06] it'll preach in this hour - well
[2:08:09] hallelujah here's a prophet he loves his
[2:08:17] son his son loves him he's his favorite
[2:08:20] he's a hunter he's a man he's a man's
[2:08:25] man he's one of those hunters on
[2:08:28] Instagram he knows that a cook - and
[2:08:36] here's Jacob little boy
[2:08:38] mama's boy tent dweller stays at home
[2:08:43] lazy liar a cheat playing video games
[2:08:58] which man would you choose that boy
[2:09:03] there's no problem with a lot of our
[2:09:04] kids they don't leave the tent till
[2:09:05] they're old I didn't want you living in
[2:09:14] your mama's 10 all the way up to the you
[2:09:15] were 70 you know one tradition says that
[2:09:22] Jacob was 70 when he remained when he
[2:09:24] married I don't know how old he was but
[2:09:28] anyway that's not the point point was
[2:09:31] there was something down in that
[2:09:39] brother Ben said forgive me Lord for
[2:09:41] saying this but I'm gonna say it that
[2:09:42] way cuz that's how he said it called him
[2:09:44] a he said you would have chosen
[2:09:47] Esau right well the Prophet did I would
[2:09:53] not take the Prophet the Prophet chose
[2:09:56] him I'll choose him now it doesn't mean
[2:10:02] Jacob was a good person because he was
[2:10:04] not don't say yeah I'm that Jacob I'm at
[2:10:08] home I've lived there I'm 30 years old
[2:10:10] I'm at home I do love video games I I
[2:10:13] love staying at home and I am a -
[2:10:17] maybe you identified with that but down
[2:10:20] in the inside there was a seed that God
[2:10:23] had prophesied over they said the elder
[2:10:26] shall serve the younger now here's a
[2:10:29] queen of the Bible and a prophet of the
[2:10:31] Bible both of them are going to
[2:10:32] intervene in the prophecy of God both of
[2:10:40] them are going to get involved and both
[2:10:42] of them are going to be wrong how is it
[2:10:47] that so many can be blessed at the
[2:10:49] beginning and wrong at the end
[2:10:58] now Isaac is old and he said I need to
[2:11:02] molest my son he's got the birthright
[2:11:08] you know Jacob had already made a deal
[2:11:11] with his brother for that birthright you
[2:11:14] know it's kind of how we treat the
[2:11:16] message yeah I'll make a deal with you
[2:11:19] he made a deal with his brother and his
[2:11:22] brother was hungry so he said yeah
[2:11:23] that's a good deal you know your
[2:11:25] appetite will make you look at the value
[2:11:27] of the message the wrong way the way
[2:11:33] some you sit here you're not even
[2:11:34] interested this morning because you have
[2:11:36] an appetite for the wrong thing and you
[2:11:39] sit here and say you know what good is
[2:11:41] this birthright gonna do me I'm gonna do
[2:11:43] I'm gonna die if I don't eat some soup
[2:11:47] well what good will this message do you
[2:11:49] let's just stop and talk about that for
[2:11:51] just a minute
[2:11:53] I want to tell you how good this message
[2:11:56] is brother branham said if I prayed for
[2:11:58] 10,000 people today and every one of
[2:12:01] them died tomorrow I would still go out
[2:12:03] and preach divine healing because the
[2:12:05] word is true
[2:12:06] he said if I pray for people and they
[2:12:08] said they believe this truth and I'm
[2:12:10] paraphrasing here and then they died and
[2:12:13] came back to me and says brother he said
[2:12:15] brother Branham Billy is this what you
[2:12:18] believed was wrong it's not the truth he
[2:12:20] said I'd still believe it anyhow because
[2:12:22] it's the Word of God even if people came
[2:12:26] back and said it was oh what are you
[2:12:33] gonna believe but in a time of appetite
[2:12:37] a time of appetite see this is where
[2:12:41] people get all mixed up and see Satan
[2:12:45] has got a real powerful platform of
[2:12:47] Instagram social media these people that
[2:12:50] leave the message Satan tries to keep
[2:12:52] them reconnected with you because they
[2:12:54] used to be your friends and those
[2:12:55] friends look so happy
[2:12:57] I want to tell you why they left the
[2:12:59] message they didn't leave the message
[2:13:01] because they found something better
[2:13:03] they left the message cuz her appetite
[2:13:05] took away the value of it they wanted
[2:13:13] the things of the world they wanted to
[2:13:15] cut their hair they wanted to go back to
[2:13:18] the denomination they didn't want to
[2:13:20] live right somebody help me this morning
[2:13:23] baby but this is what this message will
[2:13:26] do it'll produce sons and daughters of
[2:13:29] God it'll produce a real clean holy lie
[2:13:33] it'll change your appetite
[2:13:35] for the things of the world kind of
[2:13:37] things of God you know what God said
[2:13:42] about Esau he said he profaned my word I
[2:13:48] had offered him a birthright he profaned
[2:13:52] it even though with tears he sought it
[2:13:54] later they already made a deal now Jacob
[2:14:03] has the birthright for a bowl of soup
[2:14:11] wonder how many of you are sitting here
[2:14:13] today you're only here because you made
[2:14:16] a deal and that deal is your conversion
[2:14:21] right part of it I have the desire I
[2:14:27] wanted more than him and he gave it up
[2:14:29] but I'm gonna take it anyway it never
[2:14:31] changed who Jacob was now the church is
[2:14:37] going to get involved because because
[2:14:40] it's a time of blessing and that old
[2:14:41] blind prophet is going to bless his son
[2:14:44] and he's told Esau go kill kill an
[2:14:48] animal and bring the venison to me and
[2:14:50] make it just the way I like it and I'll
[2:14:52] bless you that and so so he saw said
[2:14:54] alright daddy and Rebekah knew what it
[2:14:57] was saying so she went to to Jacob and
[2:15:00] said Jacob I'm gonna tell you how to be
[2:15:02] born again
[2:15:06] I'm going to tell you how to receive the
[2:15:09] blessing brother Aaron yeah yeah yes yes
[2:15:36] this way people aren't a message you me
[2:15:38] me take your coat off and sit down I
[2:15:49] love you I'm only appreciates why I'm
[2:15:51] acting like I'm an authority over you
[2:16:16] brother Bram said that the Spirit of God
[2:16:18] is not something that is schooled into
[2:16:22] you it's not taught into you it's not a
[2:16:28] tradition into you it's it is something
[2:16:31] that's predestinated into you by the
[2:16:34] hand of Almighty God and I know you're
[2:16:36] only sitting there thinking man he's
[2:16:37] sweating on my coat but hey man you're
[2:16:40] it'll be holy sweat hey man that's why
[2:16:48] they make cleaners he says now your
[2:16:50] experiences cannot be schooled or taught
[2:16:53] into you its predestinated by God's hand
[2:16:56] and God's foreknowledge now God's
[2:16:57] foreknowledge says the elder shall serve
[2:17:00] the younger
[2:17:00] it's holy its predestinated and the
[2:17:04] spirits gonna keep it but the church
[2:17:06] gets involved because she hears that the
[2:17:10] Prophet is telling his son go cook me a
[2:17:12] meal and I'll bless you so she goes and
[2:17:14] says hey listen go get some of your
[2:17:16] brothers clothes put them on so your
[2:17:20] smell I can get some fur your brother's
[2:17:25] hairy go get go get some goats can put
[2:17:27] it on your hands and and his coat and
[2:17:30] then sit there and if you and if you act
[2:17:32] like him you're gonna get the blessing
[2:17:35] you know so then if I think I because
[2:17:43] I'm wearing Erin's coat now I'm gonna
[2:17:45] start talking like him and I'm gonna say
[2:17:46] I can't somehow I begin to think maybe
[2:17:53] God is impressed with I'm acting like my
[2:17:55] brother this is what the church thought
[2:17:58] a woman that used to be holy
[2:18:00] she told him go act like your brother
[2:18:03] and the Prophet was deceived by you
[2:18:08] smell like he saw you feel like you so
[2:18:12] but you sound like Jacob who really are
[2:18:14] you I am I am Esau come here brother
[2:18:18] Aaron brother and a man no I did no no
[2:18:25] see see how Lord kill that complex in
[2:18:29] this manner hey man now in Aaron's voice
[2:18:34] say I am Aaron I'll take he's always for
[2:18:37] me so you won't feel so I am Aaron I am
[2:18:40] Aaron no no I'm Jake I am Aaron I am
[2:18:47] Aaron well you smell like him you look
[2:18:50] like him but you sound like Jacob but I
[2:18:52] am Aaron well we got a problem now
[2:18:58] thank you brother now I can be deceived
[2:19:00] now I go I go I go to that blind prophet
[2:19:04] so I he's not gonna get a complex oh
[2:19:07] yeah I've called you Esau now he's the
[2:19:09] blind prophet okay
[2:19:11] father Oh father bless me I am Aaron
[2:19:19] smell me well then I must be hearing it
[2:19:28] you know I hold myself like Aaron if I
[2:19:31] say y'all I care enough i if I have I
[2:19:34] dance like Aaron or if I speak like a
[2:19:36] man or speak like this manner speak like
[2:19:39] a Mook that's the party that's the
[2:19:41] experience let me get this off forever
[2:19:43] ruin it amen amen and so you know this
[2:19:52] is what many try to do is they try to
[2:19:54] act like somebody else but God has said
[2:19:58] I'll meet you my prophecy is holy I
[2:20:00] promise you a mean that the elder shall
[2:20:03] serve the younger but God I think I have
[2:20:05] to act like him to get it no I never
[2:20:07] said that
[2:20:08] this promise is unto you and unto your
[2:20:11] children and to them that I but a car I
[2:20:13] gotta act like no you don't you just
[2:20:16] gotta come to it
[2:20:19] this should be the name of the law
[2:20:21] God is not impressed with your knowledge
[2:20:24] of your brother so here is a queen of
[2:20:32] the Bible trying to take a man and make
[2:20:35] him act like corruptible seed God was
[2:20:42] not impressed a prophet said who are you
[2:20:45] he said I am Esau and brother branham
[2:20:48] said in desperation that that Jacob
[2:20:50] thought that settled it but what he had
[2:20:54] was gonna kill him what you have will
[2:20:58] kill you if it hasn't changed you but
[2:21:04] you call the Holy Ghost that you've
[2:21:05] experienced in your life if it has not
[2:21:08] quickened your seed will kill you was
[2:21:15] this message did not bring me to make me
[2:21:18] part of a church this message come to
[2:21:21] make me the bride if Jesus could humble
[2:21:25] himself and become the author salvation
[2:21:29] and learn it through obedience then
[2:21:32] brought the prophets said then the
[2:21:34] church is becoming the bride by letting
[2:21:37] the word go through her not her mama's
[2:21:40] opinion that's why jeroboams have raised
[2:21:47] up they want to give you their own
[2:21:50] experience their own covering they're
[2:21:54] all apostles no no now George Jacob
[2:22:02] still experienced the supernatural but
[2:22:04] he hadn't been changed Jacob became very
[2:22:07] wealthy could say God bless me but he
[2:22:08] hadn't been changed
[2:22:10] God had met him in a dream and God told
[2:22:15] him he said I'll not leave you until I
[2:22:17] have performed what I had promised
[2:22:19] Abraham huh
[2:22:24] I'm not acting German anymore brother
[2:22:27] Aaron not even acting like you your
[2:22:30] coats off for me now you know that's
[2:22:32] your problem you got to take that coat
[2:22:33] off and get real with God now Aaron and
[2:22:36] I'm not saying cuz you have your coat on
[2:22:38] you're not here with God don't don't
[2:22:40] throw that complex away we're friends I
[2:22:44] can talk to him he said he's in trouble
[2:22:45] now cuz he said God gave me it was
[2:22:47] afraid ya see what I want so you know we
[2:22:54] try to meet God with coats have been put
[2:22:56] on us from somebody else that's where
[2:22:58] like Pentecost they beat you on the back
[2:23:00] you know I was I was in in prison
[2:23:03] ministry and I was there the whole line
[2:23:04] of denominational ministers and I saw
[2:23:06] all these people said in there and every
[2:23:08] one of them given their denominational
[2:23:10] Creed hoping that guy on the other side
[2:23:12] the glass would receive it and if he did

[2:36:30] Catholic heads I'll tell you how God
[2:36:38] uses people say God could use he saw in
[2:36:40] that moment to help Jacob I quit
[2:36:45] preaching I cancelled my meetings I quit
[2:36:46] preaching to home didn't preach for
[2:36:47] about a month the brothers stepped up
[2:36:49] and they helped me they saw the situated
[2:36:52] to get in the pulpit because I knew I'd
[2:36:54] gonna fall apart become a giver an idiot
[2:36:56] I knew it couldn't help it you say
[2:37:00] brother you need to snap out it you're
[2:37:01] right well you go through the battle so
[2:37:06] I'm up in northern Georgia we're resting
[2:37:08] there and praying and so forth I'll tell
[2:37:11] you no matter how you feel no matter how
[2:37:13] low you are no matter how you don't
[2:37:15] think you're hearing anything from God
[2:37:17] he's always there I remember one morning
[2:37:20] I had read my scriptures and then I went
[2:37:24] on a walk and I said Lord just let
[2:37:26] somebody help me today call me tell me
[2:37:29] give me a word from the Lord I got a
[2:37:31] call 30 minutes later from a brother in
[2:37:33] our church he was you know he said I was
[2:37:35] just thinking about you said the Lord
[2:37:37] told me he said take down he to read
[2:37:39] this scripture and he told me the
[2:37:40] description I had a shout because that
[2:37:42] was my devotion I ever had the same
[2:37:45] scripture the Lord had already told him
[2:37:46] tell me to read and I just read it so
[2:37:49] the Lord is always talking to me even
[2:37:51] though you don't feel it so here I am
[2:37:54] and then I get another call as I said we
[2:37:57] start to go home and get a call from
[2:37:58] brother Ron Spencer who need your
[2:38:00] prayers right now he's been diagnosed
[2:38:04] with terminal 4 stage cancer by the Lord
[2:38:07] take him through it
[2:38:09] he called me he said brother Danny said
[2:38:11] I was on my track during selling point
[2:38:13] exactly where I was on that tractor he
[2:38:15] said the Holy Spirit told me says called
[2:38:18] Danny and tell him he's been attacked by
[2:38:21] a spirit of witchcraft so now I had a
[2:38:25] Catholic tell me witches and I told my
[2:38:30] wife then I said you know I said you
[2:38:32] know she's a Catholic they're thinking
[2:38:34] in icons and statues and everything well
[2:38:37] there is real witches but I said also
[2:38:40] that rebellion is as the sin of
[2:38:42] witchcraft and that's what was rising up
[2:38:45] in the church this spirit that don't
[2:38:47] believe in preachers and everything else
[2:38:52] and so when that brother told me that
[2:38:56] that it's a that's a spirit of
[2:38:59] witchcraft immediately the fear left me
[2:39:01] a one heal but the fear left me because
[2:39:06] I mend I knew what it was because you
[2:39:09] know I tell you in that time that that
[2:39:11] enemies are tagging like that that
[2:39:13] spirits coming and visiting you
[2:39:14] everything you ever done wrong is being
[2:39:16] brought throwed before you Satan's
[2:39:18] trying to drag every sin up from under
[2:39:20] the blood and tell you everything about
[2:39:22] you you're a failure you shouldn't be
[2:39:23] everything is being thrown before you
[2:39:25] and there's times you don't know it's
[2:39:27] way to move which way to go and I tell
[2:39:29] you the only thing you do in that time
[2:39:30] is stand still show your colors yeah
[2:39:40] yeah it's gonna be like that fella in
[2:39:42] Tombstone there that was buried less
[2:39:44] more said here's lies less more one
[2:39:46] bullet from a 44 no less no more that
[2:39:49] was gonna be Danny steaming right there
[2:39:51] in Sarasota
[2:39:52] hey so then the attacks kept coming the
[2:39:56] spirits kept rising but I had no fear in
[2:39:59] it and the Lord tells you how to win to
[2:40:02] deal with something and the spirit got
[2:40:05] so strong and listen as a pastor you
[2:40:08] you're understanding things rise up
[2:40:10] because they're after the Sheep or after
[2:40:13] the weak ones are there to kill them and
[2:40:16] so something had happened and I'm not
[2:40:18] going to go into the details that they
[2:40:20] tried to take a preeminence
[2:40:23] and and I was receiving these letters
[2:40:25] everything you know the Lord told me
[2:40:26] said don't say nothing don't reply so I
[2:40:28] never replied for about three months I
[2:40:30] never said nothing and that makes it
[2:40:32] devil really mad when you ignore him no
[2:40:38] matter in matter matter Christmas is
[2:40:40] that what proper English theron matter
[2:40:42] in matter in matter I don't really care
[2:40:43] and so then and then Christmas came
[2:40:46] which I told my church Jesus was not
[2:40:48] born on Christmas some of you don't know
[2:40:49] that I said Jesus wasn't born on
[2:40:53] Christmas but I was okay I was that's
[2:40:58] when I was born and it so happened that
[2:41:01] Sunday was Christmas and it was my
[2:41:02] birthday and the Lord told me preached
[2:41:04] this message and he told me to preach
[2:41:06] that the Bible is the absolute that the
[2:41:11] Prophet believed in not every the the
[2:41:15] the the Bible and the Lord told me to
[2:41:18] preach it and I preached it and then I
[2:41:20] preached it in three days it cleaned
[2:41:22] that spirit clean that spirit but you
[2:41:29] have to wait for the right client
[2:41:30] you can't just try to wear another man's
[2:41:32] coat and fight that battle so clean the
[2:41:35] spirit I wasn't healed but it cleaned
[2:41:37] that spirit out now if you've never went
[2:41:39] through time with your nerves and
[2:41:40] suffering like yeah I can't I can't I
[2:41:42] can sympathize with you but I can tell
[2:41:44] you this and tell you this it'll take
[2:41:47] everything from you if you let it so I
[2:41:50] begin to build my strength back but I
[2:41:52] wasn't healed but I began to build my
[2:41:54] strength back it is actually a year
[2:41:56] later I went and preached over in Europe
[2:41:58] again is a Romania at this youth camp
[2:41:59] that preached for about five or six
[2:42:01] straight years no one reason I'm not
[2:42:03] preaching it this years because my son's
[2:42:04] having a boy our child don't know what
[2:42:06] it's gonna be gonna have a child so you
[2:42:08] got to be there for your kids and and so
[2:42:11] uh and so I was there and it was very
[2:42:14] hot every day was about a hundred and
[2:42:16] two and is an open-air meeting had a
[2:42:19] roof but got very hot in there when
[2:42:21] we're we slept we didn't have no air or
[2:42:23] anything so you could sleep but you
[2:42:24] didn't rest so you just got weaker and
[2:42:26] weaker and weaker and weaker I'm only
[2:42:27] telling this to help you okay we're all
[2:42:29] men weaker and weaker and weaker and I
[2:42:33] preached Thursday night Friday morning
[2:42:37] Friday night Saturday morning in
[2:42:39] Saturday morning I said I'm going to
[2:42:42] continue what I'm going to preach
[2:42:43] setting my own preach at Saturday night
[2:42:45] and in between that that spirit hit me
[2:42:47] again
[2:42:48] hit me again I could feel that fear come
[2:42:52] back when that fear came all inspiration
[2:42:54] to preach was gone and I literally was
[2:42:57] walking to the pulpit brother Jack with
[2:42:59] no inspiration and that fear is oh man I
[2:43:02] was just like this walking just like I
[2:43:03] am I look at you look at you and I said
[2:43:05] Lord you got to help me I got to preach
[2:43:07] this and I don't have no inspiration and
[2:43:09] that fears back and that's all I said
[2:43:10] and I walked to the Pope when I preached
[2:43:12] didn't feel better the Lord helped the
[2:43:16] Lord help me and I preached the people
[2:43:18] responded sometimes you got to fake it
[2:43:23] and the people responded and the Lord
[2:43:25] back did I when I got done there was a
[2:43:30] young minister sitting over here
[2:43:31] couldn't speak couldn't speak English
[2:43:33] but he came up and spoke to the
[2:43:35] ministers and spoke to them and brother
[2:43:38] Gabriel who runs the camp and his son
[2:43:43] who's also a minister he asked again who
[2:43:45] was that brother and the brother taught
[2:43:46] him he is that's a that's a sincere
[2:43:48] brother and they came and talked to me
[2:43:50] says Danny entire time you preach
[2:43:53] there's a man stood right behind you and
[2:43:56] held your arms
[2:43:58] I am the only one that knew what I pre
[2:44:03] said a man stood behind you he was
[2:44:06] dressed in white he held your arm out
[2:44:08] some of you gonna leave me right here
[2:44:09] say all you're just talkin not know I'm
[2:44:11] just telling you I prayed angels the
[2:44:13] Lord at camp about those that fear and
[2:44:15] and and they God allowed that man to see
[2:44:17] it because it's That moment when I heard
[2:44:19] that I'm the only one that knew what I
[2:44:21] prayed it was in that moment God healed
[2:44:24] me and I have never been the same again
[2:44:29] fear is called the nerves are healed why
[2:44:34] because in that hour that you can't do
[2:44:37] it hey man he can do it that our aim in
[2:44:40] when death is coming he's there to touch
[2:44:42] you hey the same God that could touch
[2:44:45] Jacob context Danny can touch your life
[2:44:49] money you know as ministers you kind of
[2:44:52] want to present yourself as the strong
[2:44:54] one but there's times you got to present
[2:44:55] yourself as the weak one so that the
[2:44:57] weak ones can say hey ho God I need that
[2:45:00] same one to compound and touch me and if
[2:45:03] there's anybody in here that suffered
[2:45:05] with that I'd stand right now and
[2:45:06] receive your healing from the same angel
[2:45:09] that touched me because I'm telling you
[2:45:11] he is touched by the feeling of your
[2:45:13] infirmities he is the same yesterday
[2:45:14] today I think you can't figure out he's
[2:45:18] already figured it out
[2:45:26] hallelujah I gotta tell you I was
[2:45:31] embarrassed to talk about that I was
[2:45:34] embarrassed to give that testimony to
[2:45:36] anybody and I was really embarrassed to
[2:45:37] go say you know an angel held Danny up
[2:45:39] and they're gonna say yeah yeah we've
[2:45:40] heard this before here comes another man
[2:45:42] trying to say he was visited by an angel
[2:45:45] this is an angel of healing the first
[2:45:48] time I ever testified of it was in New
[2:45:52] Zealand probably eight months later and
[2:45:55] the Lord said tell that testimony and I
[2:45:57] told it and there's a girl stood up and
[2:45:59] you'll know who she is she's from
[2:46:00] America and her brother had just
[2:46:02] committed suicide in the Phoenix Church
[2:46:05] she's married to a boy there in New
[2:46:08] Zealand and she stood up and said if
[2:46:10] that same angel could touch him because
[2:46:13] the thing came upon her her brother's
[2:46:15] committed suicide that grief in them and
[2:46:17] they just couldn't be healed and it was
[2:46:19] in that moment God begin the process of
[2:46:21] healing in that girl there's nothing
[2:46:23] happens to you no matter how hard the
[2:46:25] struggle is there's nothing that happens
[2:46:27] to you that God will not turn it around
[2:46:28] it'll become healing in somebody else

[2:46:54] glory from it but I'm gonna get the
[2:46:56] glory and I want to tell you when I'm

[2:49:21] the Bible says that he does not give us
[2:49:23] the spirit of fear and and the other
[2:49:26] thing about spirit of fear that should
[2:49:29] let us know that fear is a spirit it is

[3:16:19] brother steaming this morning just
[3:16:21] laboring in the gospel it's born of an
[3:16:33] incorruptible seed say we get this
[3:16:37] revelation of who we are and we know
[3:16:40] that we're gonna go through battles who
[3:16:41] realize that but there's something on
[3:16:43] the inside of you that's just like God
[3:16:46] and let me ask you a question have you
[3:16:48] ever seen God defeated and if that God
[3:16:54] has dwelled on the inside of you you
[3:16:55] also will not be defeated you may go
[3:16:58] through some things but you won't be
[3:17:02] defeated so glad he gave us the promise
[3:17:04] that the gates of hell would not prevail
[3:17:07] then saying wouldn't come against us but
[3:17:10] it won't prevail hallelujah thank God
[3:17:14] for that and I'm just making it personal
[3:17:16] as he got towards the end I believe that
[3:17:20] was something to set somebody else free

[3:17:23] fought him in a bottle then poured them
[3:17:25] out on somebody else to give you a
[3:17:28] refreshing God is a good God God is a
