[42:29] bless abundantly father and god as uh
[42:33] each one just gives from their heart
[42:35] lord because of their love towards you i
[42:37] pray that you'd
[42:38] return it back 100 full it's in jesus
[42:40] name
[42:41] we pray amen amen 19 years ago i met
[42:46] brother nathan and um
[42:49] brother trevor i also met brother
[42:51] stephen at that time and
[42:53] uh and over the years we have developed
[42:55] a
[42:56] true genuine friendships and uh
[42:59] something that i've come
[43:00] to cherish and appreciate um
[43:03] and we've shared so much over the years
[43:05] and and then
[43:06] um just kind of watching us go through
[43:08] these different paths and
[43:10] into ministry together uh brother nathan
[43:13] when he started the church there and uh
[43:15] just all that the lord has done
[43:17] for him and and and not only you know
[43:19] with the church
[43:20] i used to used to come here and he'd
[43:22] come kind of just with him or just with
[43:24] his family we'd go from church to church
[43:26] just
[43:26] preaching you know wherever we could get
[43:28] an open door
[43:30] but this time was something different
[43:31] because he brought two preachers with
[43:33] them
[43:34] and uh and they preached and you know
[43:36] it's just been a real blessing and while
[43:37] they're preaching there's still some
[43:39] other preachers at home
[43:40] holding things down and i say lord
[43:43] that's all right
[43:44] that that that's fruit you know from
[43:47] from the ministry and i'm like
[43:48] glory to god you know so it just blesses
[43:51] my heart to see him and
[43:53] brother nathan has come many times and
[43:55] we realize it's not brother nathan but
[43:57] it's the god
[43:57] inside of our precious brother uh the
[44:00] lord uses his ministry he's prayed for
[44:02] many of people here
[44:04] um in our church we have seen the
[44:06] healing
[44:07] power of god right here
[44:10] in our midst so we can't doubt that god
[44:13] hears his prayer
[44:14] somebody might say well you know god
[44:16] hear my prayer yeah i don't doubt that
[44:18] i don't doubt that but some of the
[44:20] testimonies that he has shared
[44:22] some amen that we've seen with our own
[44:24] eyes uh
[44:25] and i think it's all the approach that's
[44:27] why people get certain results i
[44:28] remember when sister tanya
[44:30] had the uh um the cancer there that she
[44:32] was dealing with and
[44:34] and we was going to the meeting the
[44:35] doctor wanted to cut right away she said
[44:37] no i'm going to a meeting first and then
[44:39] after i get back from the meeting then
[44:40] y'all can do your surgery
[44:42] and uh when she said that she we went to
[44:44] the meeting
[44:45] and she said brother nathan prayed for
[44:46] me before i couldn't move my arm and
[44:49] now i'm able to move my arm i want him
[44:50] to pray for me again brother nathan
[44:52] wasn't preaching i was preaching and
[44:54] he said we'll do it you know uh after
[44:56] after the uh after the service
[44:58] and um we went through the whole weekend
[45:01] and then we got to the last service
[45:02] brother troy come to the office say
[45:04] my wife say she want to be prayed for
[45:06] yes tonight we'll make sure that happens
[45:08] brother nathan prayed for her that night
[45:11] and
[45:12] and um between the time of his prayer
[45:14] and the time of her going back to the
[45:16] doctor
[45:17] the cancer fell right off and we got the
[45:20] pictures
[45:21] of before and after we've seen god do
[45:23] this last year brother nathan came and
[45:25] prayed and there was a couple
[45:27] that was here to church from another
[45:28] church but they came in and they've been
[45:30] waiting and praying to have children
[45:33] uh for a number of years and uh seven
[45:36] years
[45:37] uh so uh the couple their husband asked
[45:40] the wife come let's
[45:40] just have them pray and they prayed
[45:42] right here in this spot
[45:44] and uh and now we got pictures of that
[45:46] baby that god blessed him with
[45:49] god heard the prayer right and uh so as
[45:52] we were
[45:52] amen we can give god praise for that he
[45:55] is certainly the same yesterday today
[45:57] and forever
[45:58] and and so i was just trying to in my
[46:00] heart just try to get how are we going
[46:02] to do this and the lord just kind of put
[46:03] in my spirit we're going to do a
[46:05] a a kind of a a little mix people here
[46:08] in the sanctuary you'll have an
[46:09] opportunity
[46:10] if you desire to come through the prayer
[46:12] line and be prayed for yourself
[46:14] if you have somebody else that you're
[46:15] standing in the gap for get them on your
[46:17] mind and just come and
[46:19] let the minister know who you want to be
[46:20] prayed for and we'll pray for them but
[46:22] we also have people that are not able to
[46:24] join us
[46:25] uh and they they submitted requests
[46:27] requests have come from all over the
[46:28] world
[46:29] amen the things that we shared on on
[46:31] social media now requests are coming
[46:33] from all over the world and we'll be
[46:34] sharing those requests
[46:35] praying over those requests as if the
[46:38] people were right here
[46:40] in the prayer line we believe god's
[46:42] gonna do miracles
[46:44] he's done it before he'll do it again
[46:48] we've got confidence in our god amen
[46:52] so i just want to amen welcome my friend
[46:56] my brother a man my
[46:59] uh cohort in the ministry i just
[47:02] welcomed him
[47:03] uh this morning or this afternoon a man
[47:05] to the pulpit
[47:06] and he asked me just y'all just remain
[47:08] seated because he just wants to kind of
[47:09] come
[47:10] in and just do it the way the lord leads
[47:12] him to do it today all right is that all
[47:13] right
[47:14] brother nathan bryant amen we welcome
[47:16] you this morning to the pulpit god bless
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:22] you
[47:26] [Music]
[47:28] amen you love the lord amen
[47:32] i'm actually not gonna sing i'm gonna
[47:33] try to save my voice but i might sing
[47:35] after
[47:36] if we have time but you know covert has
[47:38] made it hard on these musicians used to
[47:40] they could you know mount things to each
[47:42] other and it's hard enough to
[47:43] lip read without a mouth but without a
[47:45] mask but it's
[47:47] pretty hard to read lips with the mask
[47:49] on say what key was that what
[47:52] it's in g i still didn't
[47:55] so that makes it a little difficult on
[47:57] the musicians but
[47:59] thank you all god bless you i mean i've
[48:01] seen these musicians grow up
[48:04] they were a little bitty when we started
[48:06] coming and now they've grown up
[48:08] and my time flies doesn't it
[48:12] i wanted to share a few things with you
[48:14] before we got into the service and i
[48:15] didn't want to leave you standing we'll
[48:17] maybe stand here in a moment to read the
[48:19] scripture but you know it seems like the
[48:21] theme of this week before we even got to
[48:24] the services and then we got to the
[48:25] services and seemed like the theme of
[48:27] the services has been
[48:28] food
[48:32] is just every sermon has been you know
[48:34] integrated a little bit of food into it
[48:36] and
[48:36] and so i i heard some of the brothers
[48:38] that came with me amen and back there on
[48:40] some of the food
[48:41] things and and i guess coming to church
[48:44] is is kind of like that
[48:46] and we uh you know the type of services
[48:49] we've had this week is kind of like an
[48:50] all-you-can-eat buffet
[48:53] we've had a variety of different things
[48:55] if you have a preference of a certain
[48:56] style or
[48:57] color or or height or
[49:02] whatever it would be flavor we've had
[49:05] different things to offer
[49:06] so we're we're certainly enjoying the
[49:09] all you can eat buffet
[49:10] and you know some people it's
[49:12] interesting some some brothers that i
[49:13] think oh my they're just
[49:15] great somebody else might think no no
[49:16] they're that's not my favorite preacher
[49:18] and somebody that i might not
[49:19] drive five minutes to hear they say oh
[49:21] that brother he's he's deep or he's
[49:23] wonderful so
[49:24] we find that god's a god of variety and
[49:27] his people are a people of variety
[49:29] so we we eat different ways we we fill
[49:32] up different ways and
[49:34] but as long as you're eating i think
[49:35] that's the main thing
[49:37] i i heard one brother give a
[49:40] type a while back he said you know the
[49:41] thing is he said we're all eating pie
[49:43] and he said but it seems like the
[49:45] argument is
[49:46] who's serving the pie how big of pieces
[49:48] are we cutting
[49:49] what direction are we cutting and all
[49:50] those type of things so i'm just
[49:52] thankful to be eating pie this morning
[49:55] amen good to be in the house of the lord
[49:57] and brother jack i
[49:58] certainly appreciate my friend and
[50:00] brother 19 years doesn't seem like it
[50:03] can be that long i was 19 years old when
[50:05] i met him
[50:06] so it doesn't seem like another 19 is
[50:08] rolled around
[50:09] but i guess it has and many dangers
[50:12] toils and snares we have already come
[50:15] amen a lot of a lot of trials and
[50:17] different things that we faced and you
[50:19] know brother jack is one of those
[50:20] brothers if i talk to him every week or
[50:22] if i don't talk to him for six months
[50:24] we just pick right back up where we left
[50:25] off and it's always wonderful fellowship
[50:28] and
[50:28] i thought he was going to share all the
[50:29] testimonies i had to share before i got
[50:31] up here but
[50:32] he saved a few for me and uh
[50:35] sister tanya that picture i hope you
[50:37] don't mind i've shared it in finland and
[50:40] i've shared it in different states
[50:41] all around the nation and and it's
[50:43] certainly a faith builder
[50:45] and i have some photographs like that
[50:48] that i like to share to build faith
[50:50] and i was in finland a few years ago and
[50:54] we was having services there and had a
[50:55] prayer line before the prayer line i was
[50:57] preaching on the architect of our bodies
[50:59] which i think i actually preached here
[51:00] one time and
[51:02] and sharing some of the pictures of the
[51:04] things that god has done the sister came
[51:05] up in the prayer line and she had
[51:07] chronic uh ear pain for 23 years and
[51:10] thyroid problems for 24 years
[51:13] and began to pray for it and she's
[51:14] saying they told they told me before i
[51:16] got there they said now some of the
[51:18] finished people they're very shy and
[51:20] when you go to call a prayer line they
[51:21] probably uh
[51:23] you'll have to just pick somebody that
[51:24] you know is sick and get them to be the
[51:26] first one because nobody wants to be the
[51:28] first one in the prayer line that's just
[51:29] their
[51:30] their nature and personality and and so
[51:32] i started sharing these pictures picture
[51:34] after picture
[51:35] x-rays and of crooked backs turned
[51:38] straight and pictures of
[51:39] sister tanya's cancer before and after
[51:43] and
[51:44] different things like that and so when
[51:45] we called for the prayer line they lined
[51:46] up from the front to the back of the
[51:48] church and didn't have to coax anybody
[51:49] to come
[51:50] so when when god does it it's a
[51:52] different story isn't it
[51:54] praise the lord
[51:58] we certainly appreciate brother jack and
[52:00] and the testimonies
[52:02] that god has done here at the church i
[52:04] don't think i finished my testimony from
[52:06] finland i laid a prayer cloth on that
[52:07] lady
[52:08] that brother brandon prayed over and she
[52:10] said when when i laid that prayer cloth
[52:11] on her she began to feel just a hot
[52:13] sensation go up from her
[52:14] her throat around where the thyroid
[52:16] gland was all the way out through the
[52:17] top
[52:18] of her head and when it passed by her
[52:19] ear her ear pain was gone completely and
[52:21] she was completely healed so
[52:23] we still serve a god that's hebrews 13
[52:25] 8.
[52:27] he's still a healer and he's still a
[52:29] savior he's still moving in this
[52:31] age and and um you know there's there's
[52:34] friends and then there's just real
[52:36] real friends and brother jack is is one
[52:39] of my
[52:39] somebody asked you know who who's your
[52:41] best friend brother jack is one of my
[52:43] closest friends
[52:44] uh you know i've got a lot of good
[52:46] friends but he's one that has a been a
[52:48] very dear friend and he's been such an
[52:51] encouragement to me down through the
[52:52] years different things
[52:54] that i faced that he had kind of blazed
[52:56] the trail ahead
[52:57] and he would kind of tell me well
[52:58] brother this is this is what to expect
[53:00] and it's going to be like this
[53:01] and and i'd go a few days later and find
[53:04] out it's just like brother jack said
[53:06] and then we turned a corner and then we
[53:08] got to do some things and blaze a
[53:10] different trail that he hadn't blazed
[53:11] and
[53:12] i'd tell him brother jack this is what
[53:14] was going to be like and he'd say
[53:15] you were right so it's nice when
[53:18] somebody's been an encouragement to you
[53:19] to
[53:20] to try to be an encouragement to to them
[53:22] and i feel like when we come to spirit
[53:24] and truth tabernacle
[53:25] we go away you know we're supposed to be
[53:26] coming to encourage you but
[53:28] we go away in courage there was a
[53:30] brother that we went and
[53:32] before brother trevor and i were
[53:33] ministers uh
[53:35] we um or at least before we were very
[53:38] well known as ministers we i guess we
[53:40] were born ministers but
[53:42] even us it took us a while to figure
[53:44] that out and then took a lot of people
[53:45] a lot longer than it took us to figure
[53:47] it out but
[53:48] we we would go to a nursing home
[53:51] and and we would we would try to go
[53:54] there and encourage a brother that had
[53:56] parkinson's
[53:57] and he would just shake all the time and
[53:59] his muscles were tense and things from
[54:00] parkinson's and
[54:02] and we would go and try to encourage him
[54:03] on tuesdays brother stephen would go
[54:05] with us sometimes and my brother anthony
[54:07] and
[54:07] a couple other brothers that go to the
[54:09] church there now and
[54:10] and i didn't even hardly know how to
[54:12] play guitar at the time but we kind of
[54:14] learned
[54:15] how to play guitar using him as our as
[54:18] our demo i guess
[54:19] and i'd take the guitar and they'd say
[54:20] you know this song i'd say no kind of
[54:22] like brother fuhrman today
[54:23] he's saying a song he wrote that i'd
[54:25] never really played with him but
[54:27] but they say you know this song no but
[54:29] we'll try it and i'd figure it out and
[54:30] kind of learn how to play the guitar and
[54:32] practice it on him
[54:33] and and we would always go to try to
[54:36] encourage him but by the time we got out
[54:38] of there seeing that brother laying
[54:39] there in those conditions
[54:41] couldn't turn the page of his bible
[54:43] couldn't turn the page of a message book
[54:45] and so they'd have to clip a book
[54:47] on a little stand there on his food tray
[54:50] and
[54:50] he'd have to wait for a nurse or
[54:52] somebody to come in and when they came
[54:53] in or
[54:54] a visit or somebody say could you turn
[54:55] that page and clip it to the next page
[54:57] and just sit there and read those two
[54:59] pages until somebody could turn it i
[55:00] thought we think we have trials
[55:02] sometimes
[55:03] and he had such a positive attitude
[55:05] through it all
[55:06] and i would go away encouraged when we
[55:08] were trying to go and encourage him so
[55:10] that's how i feel when we come here
[55:11] sometimes
[55:12] you come to try to encourage somebody
[55:14] and go away encourage yourself so
[55:17] it's been very encouraging the services
[55:19] brother aaron and brother stephen and
[55:21] certainly appreciate all that the lord
[55:22] has spoke through them it touched my
[55:24] heart and encouraged me
[55:26] and brother jack had said that the nine
[55:28] o'clock service you know because you're
[55:30] up against the 12 o'clock service
[55:32] we're a little limited for time but he
[55:33] told me at the 12 o'clock service
[55:35] there's really no limit
[55:36] and so brother solomon the last three
[55:38] times i've been here he said brother you
[55:40] didn't go long enough so
[55:41] i'm going to try to go till brother
[55:43] solomon looks like he's had enough
[55:45] [Laughter]
[55:47] and say brother that one was too long
[55:49] find a happy medium somewhere
[55:52] but i was thinking as brother stephen
[55:54] was preaching there
[55:55] you know brother jack for years has had
[55:57] this acquire the fire
[55:59] meeting that you all have for the youth
[56:00] i can't remember is that usually in july
[56:02] or
[56:03] uh what time of year february i'm sorry
[56:06] so around i got my times mixed up that's
[56:09] a good time to have services in west
[56:10] palm beach you know he invites brother
[56:12] trevor all the time in january and
[56:14] february
[56:15] and he calls me and says brother can you
[56:16] come in july or august
[56:19] to florida when none of the other
[56:22] evangelists want to be in florida i said
[56:24] that's fine brother i'll come
[56:25] i'll come in july or august i'd be happy
[56:28] to be there
[56:31] and so they've been having this acquire
[56:33] the fire for many years and the lord's
[56:35] blessed it but i was thinking as brother
[56:36] stephen was preaching
[56:38] you're going to get on fire for
[56:39] something
[56:41] you'll get on fire for something and and
[56:44] you know i'd rather get on fire for god
[56:46] than anything
[56:47] but you know you see people and you
[56:48] watch them even as young people many
[56:50] times you can
[56:51] begin to identify a gift in their life
[56:53] and the potential
[56:54] and then you see many times i've seen
[56:57] brothers locally around
[56:58] around us and maybe a call of god on
[57:00] their life and you see them on linkedin
[57:02] and stuff like that and
[57:03] they're trying to be a motivational
[57:04] speaker and i think brother just yield
[57:06] to the gift that god's placed in your
[57:08] life
[57:08] and you see sisters and things god's
[57:10] placed certain gifts in their life and
[57:12] and instead of using it for him they
[57:14] begin to use it for other things so
[57:15] we're going to get on fire for something
[57:18] and you might be on fire for sports or
[57:20] you might be on a lot of people on fire
[57:21] for politics right now
[57:23] people our world is going crazy with
[57:26] politics and
[57:27] and with this health scare and different
[57:29] things and racial issues but i'm
[57:31] thankful to be preaching to the church
[57:33] where i look around i see white black
[57:34] hispanic
[57:35] different things amen that's how it
[57:38] should be amen
[57:42] amen i was reminded recently brother
[57:45] branham when he went there to arkansas i
[57:46] think brother jack and i were talking
[57:48] about it and he was actually i think
[57:49] referring to a different story there in
[57:51] arkansas but
[57:52] i think many times of when he was there
[57:54] and and you know the police was kind of
[57:56] getting him in and out of the crowds and
[57:58] there was a man
[57:59] standing over the side said parson
[58:01] parson you know have mercy and
[58:03] and he started to go to that man they
[58:05] said sir you can't go over there so
[58:06] that'll cause a race right he said but
[58:08] he told me to go
[58:10] amen so amen i'm not too interested in
[58:13] in race riots and all the all the scares
[58:16] with the pandemic and things like that
[58:18] i'm interested in the kingdom of god and
[58:22] the kingdom of god isn't made up of one
[58:24] color or one nation
[58:26] or one race of people but it's a
[58:29] many-membered body
[58:31] for many nations kindreds and tongues
[58:34] amen that's the that's the group that i
[58:36] want to be associated with
[58:38] you might want to be associated as a
[58:39] democrat or a republican or this group
[58:42] or that group or this movement or this
[58:43] protest or whatever
[58:45] i want to be associated with jesus
[58:47] christ
[58:48] amen because really that's the only one
[58:51] that i can really put my confidence in
[58:53] to fully support and pull it to fully
[58:55] throw in with and say i i support this
[58:58] there's other things you say well i
[58:59] support this and i'm for that you better
[59:01] go back and read
[59:02] what all that they support before you
[59:04] support it
[59:05] because many times they have ulterior
[59:07] agendas uh
[59:08] you know our president has done a lot of
[59:10] great things but he's done a lot of bad
[59:12] things too
[59:13] you know i don't i don't feel like you
[59:14] can get up that high in office without
[59:16] doing some things but uh but i thank god
[59:20] you know he's he's done a lot of good
[59:22] things he got the embassy back in israel
[59:24] back to jerusalem i thought that was
[59:26] wonderful that and he's for our veterans
[59:28] and things like that so
[59:29] i believe god allows who's supposed to
[59:31] be in there for the time
[59:33] but but i i politics isn't what's going
[59:36] to get us out of here
[59:39] amen the health care experts is not
[59:41] what's going to get us out of here
[59:43] but it's jesus christ amen i'm on the
[59:46] winning team i believe
[59:48] brother trevor is saying recently and
[59:49] then then i beat him at volleyball and i
[59:51] said no you're on the losing team
[59:52] brother
[59:53] [Laughter]
[59:54] but spiritually we are we're on the
[59:57] wedding team
[59:58] amen i want to share just you can go
[1:00:01] ahead well actually wait just a minute
[1:00:02] sister i want to share a testimony a
[1:00:04] couple testimonies with you before we go
[1:00:06] into the
[1:00:06] into the service i know some people said
[1:00:08] well i thought we was already in the
[1:00:09] service but
[1:00:11] this is just this is just getting me
[1:00:12] relaxed to share a few testimonies
[1:00:14] before we go into this service but
[1:00:16] there's a little boy uh little oliver
[1:00:18] beaver that his grandparents come to our
[1:00:20] church sometimes and
[1:00:21] and um he had had a cyst the size of a
[1:00:24] softball come up on his shoulder
[1:00:26] and we had they'd asked the grandparents
[1:00:28] to ask if i could pray over a
[1:00:29] handkerchief and send it back
[1:00:31] and so they did this and because we're
[1:00:33] having a
[1:00:34] a prayer line at the end of the service
[1:00:36] i thought i'd share a couple of
[1:00:37] testimonies with you and
[1:00:39] and so we prayed over the prayer cloth
[1:00:40] and they sent it back and they put it on
[1:00:42] him and
[1:00:42] i want to show you the before and after
[1:00:44] picture here of what little oliver
[1:00:46] looked like you can go ahead with that
[1:00:47] picture sister
[1:00:52] if we can get through it without
[1:00:54] technical difficulties
[1:00:58] it's not working i'm going to go ahead
[1:01:01] and take off my jacket while they're
[1:01:02] doing that then
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:15] while they're trying to pull that up
[1:01:16] i'll go ahead and share a little bit of
[1:01:17] the second testimony my mother as
[1:01:19] many of you probably know a couple of
[1:01:21] months ago
[1:01:23] got diagnosed with stage four cancer
[1:01:25] breast cancer and it is spread not only
[1:01:28] from there but into the abdomen and the
[1:01:29] lungs
[1:01:30] and a spot on the back of her neck and
[1:01:32] different places in her lymph nodes and
[1:01:35] and the doctors didn't give a very good
[1:01:38] report of what their thoughts and
[1:01:39] expectations were of it and so we began
[1:01:41] to go to prayer and
[1:01:42] she began to take some medicines and
[1:01:44] things for it and
[1:01:46] she was also battling with afib and
[1:01:48] different things that
[1:01:49] the enemy tried to attack her body with
[1:01:51] but
[1:01:52] by the grace of god the lord has really
[1:01:55] begun to move on the scene for her
[1:01:56] the cancer that was on the back of her
[1:01:58] neck is completely gone
[1:02:00] the cancer in her lymph nodes is
[1:02:01] completely gone
[1:02:03] praise the lord the cancer in her
[1:02:05] abdomen is completely gone
[1:02:07] and the cancer in her lungs is basically
[1:02:10] gone there's just a few little strands
[1:02:12] that are already dying and
[1:02:13] i'll show you a picture if they if they
[1:02:15] get this work and i'll show you a
[1:02:17] picture of that as well the x-rays of
[1:02:18] her lungs but
[1:02:19] and then the the cancer that was uh in
[1:02:22] the breast has went down from
[1:02:24] what was i think about three centimeters
[1:02:26] now to about one centimeter so
[1:02:28] amen god is the healer the doctors are
[1:02:30] amazed that it's happened so fast but
[1:02:32] i'm
[1:02:32] i'm i'm i'm happy but i guess i'm not
[1:02:35] shocked is
[1:02:36] i am amazed i don't want to say that i'm
[1:02:37] not amazed but i'm not as shocked as
[1:02:39] they are
[1:02:40] because we've seen god move like that
[1:02:41] before and in fact my little boy philip
[1:02:44] when
[1:02:44] when the um when the news came and and
[1:02:47] we hadn't told anybody for a few days
[1:02:49] mom didn't want anybody but just us kids
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:51] and my dad and and and our spouses
[1:02:54] knowing and
[1:02:55] and so we hadn't told the grandchildren
[1:02:57] or anything before we announced it to
[1:02:58] the church i told them
[1:03:00] and my oldest son philip he said
[1:03:02] afterwards he said well i'm not
[1:03:03] surprised
[1:03:04] about mama and i said well why is that
[1:03:06] and he said well a few days ago
[1:03:07] that was on a saturday and he said on a
[1:03:09] thursday uh
[1:03:10] i thought i heard you calling from the
[1:03:12] office and so
[1:03:14] i was in my bedroom playing and he said
[1:03:15] i i walked down the hall to your office
[1:03:17] and i didn't see you in there and
[1:03:19] he said i looked around didn't see you
[1:03:21] anywhere so i began to walk down the
[1:03:22] hall and he said a voice
[1:03:23] a voice spoke to me and said dottie
[1:03:25] bryant has cancer but she's going to be
[1:03:27] healed
[1:03:28] and so i thought what a what a wonderful
[1:03:30] testimony and so i picked up the phone
[1:03:32] to try to call mom and tell her she was
[1:03:34] still in the hospital at the time and
[1:03:36] with covet and everything we couldn't
[1:03:37] get in to see her she was there by
[1:03:39] herself got this news
[1:03:40] in the hospital by herself and was there
[1:03:42] almost a week running tests and things
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:44] and so i picked up the phone to call her
[1:03:46] and they were right in the middle of
[1:03:47] doing some tests and things with her
[1:03:49] and so she couldn't talk she said i'll
[1:03:51] call you back in just a minute so i
[1:03:52] picked up the phone and called my dad
[1:03:54] began to tell him what the lord had
[1:03:56] spoken to philip's heart and
[1:03:58] this was still when when things were
[1:04:00] looking really bad for her
[1:04:01] and he had drove down through
[1:04:03] jeffersonville there and had pulled into
[1:04:05] a little place called duffy's landing
[1:04:07] and
[1:04:08] would begin to pray and in his prayer he
[1:04:10] said lord would you please just have
[1:04:11] brother
[1:04:12] nathan or brother joseph call me and
[1:04:13] just give me some word of encouragement
[1:04:15] about about dottie and about that time
[1:04:17] the phone rang i said you won't believe
[1:04:19] what philip just told me so
[1:04:20] god works on both ends of the line
[1:04:22] doesn't he and his timing is perfect
[1:04:24] brother if you can't get those pictures
[1:04:26] it's all
[1:04:26] it's all right is it not going to happen
[1:04:30] all right well let's just go ahead and
[1:04:34] stand together and read the scripture
[1:04:35] while they're doing that
[1:04:37] james chapter 2 there we go
[1:04:41] can you make it full screen
[1:04:46] you've got it on a slideshow or
[1:04:48] something where it's gonna
[1:04:50] automatically do it i think but
[1:05:01] james chapter 2 and verse 19.
[1:05:07] thou believest that there is one god
[1:05:11] thou doest well the devils also believe
[1:05:15] and tremble
[1:05:18] but wilt thou know o vain man that
[1:05:22] faith without works is dead
[1:05:27] faith without works is dead let's just
[1:05:29] bow our heads together this morning
[1:05:32] lord jesus lord as we come before your
[1:05:35] awesome presence
[1:05:37] i just pray that you would have
[1:05:38] preeminence in this service
[1:05:41] lord that you would take complete
[1:05:43] control of everything that's said and
[1:05:44] done
[1:05:45] lord that you would bless the people
[1:05:47] that are here those that are listening
[1:05:49] in
[1:05:50] those that'll go back and see it lord
[1:05:52] maybe they need encouragement
[1:05:54] lord maybe they need strength maybe they
[1:05:56] need healing for their bodies or their
[1:05:58] families or
[1:05:59] emotional scars that have been on their
[1:06:01] life due to hurts and different things
[1:06:03] like that that they face through life
[1:06:05] but
[1:06:06] whatever the need would be father i pray
[1:06:07] that that you would just move on the
[1:06:09] scene in a special way and
[1:06:11] lord may you just take complete control
[1:06:14] of my lips lord
[1:06:15] if there's anything that you would not
[1:06:17] have me to say then just stop my mouth
[1:06:19] or
[1:06:19] if there's things that need to be said
[1:06:21] lord let me say them no matter how
[1:06:22] difficult it would be
[1:06:24] i just pray that you would have
[1:06:26] preeminence in a special way
[1:06:28] in jesus christ's name we pray amen and
[1:06:31] god bless you
[1:06:33] amen can you go back to the picture

[1:06:40] see the softball sized cyst on the top
[1:06:42] there

[1:06:44] bottom and this next picture is the
[1:06:46] before and after
[1:06:48] of of mom's lungs on the left hand side
[1:06:53] you'll see that uh it's just filled with
[1:06:56] cancer all these white little things
[1:06:58] flaring everywhere and on the right hand
[1:07:00] side those are almost completely gone so
[1:07:03] amen that's the god that we serve amen
[1:07:09] james telling us here that faith without
[1:07:11] works is dead
[1:07:13] and you know the sisters were with me
[1:07:15] one time in okeechobee and you learn a
[1:07:17] lot of things as you go along i've
[1:07:18] learned that
[1:07:19] if you drink gatorade drink a gatorade
[1:07:21] that's got a lid on it
[1:07:23] uh so you don't get a gnat in your
[1:07:25] gatorade and have it distract you and
[1:07:26] trying to get the net out while you're
[1:07:28] preaching
[1:07:32] the sister did an impersonation of me
[1:07:34] one time they were doing impersonations
[1:07:35] of brother trevor and
[1:07:36] they said he did this with the
[1:07:38] microphone you know and different
[1:07:40] brothers
[1:07:40] and they were doing impersonations and i
[1:07:42] said do an impersonation of me and they
[1:07:44] got a
[1:07:44] they got a cup and they was dipping
[1:07:46] their finger in it like that and i said
[1:07:47] what are you doing
[1:07:48] they said that nat in okeechobee that
[1:07:49] got in your gatorade and he was trying
[1:07:52] to dig it out of your gatorade so
[1:07:54] use a lid that's a tip for you minister
[1:07:56] brothers you know they're just starting
[1:07:57] out
[1:08:00] faith without works is dead so what
[1:08:02] james is telling us that
[1:08:04] if you have faith or you claim that you
[1:08:06] have faith and you don't have any works
[1:08:08] behind it
[1:08:09] then your works are dead and so i want
[1:08:10] to i want to speak this morning to you
[1:08:12] on
[1:08:13] on a subject take the saddle off your
[1:08:15] mule
[1:08:17] take the saddle off your mule and um
[1:08:20] brother
[1:08:20] brother luke or brother uh fuhrman were
[1:08:23] either you in the service back in
[1:08:24] january 2016 when i preached this
[1:08:27] brother fuhrman was were you brother
[1:08:29] stephen well it'll be a little different
[1:08:30] this morning but
[1:08:31] uh i preached this in january of 2016 at
[1:08:34] the home church
[1:08:35] and every time i've come to west palm
[1:08:37] beach since then which i think this is
[1:08:38] my third time i came in 2016
[1:08:41] 2000 uh well this might be my fourth
[1:08:43] time since then
[1:08:44] i think we skipped uh 2018
[1:08:47] but we were here in 2016 17 18
[1:08:50] and 20. so i've tried to preach this
[1:08:53] every time and just seems like the lord
[1:08:55] has led me a different direction but
[1:08:56] this time
[1:08:57] i began to look at what to what to
[1:08:59] preach and i was thinking something else
[1:09:00] and he led me to
[1:09:01] this so our ways is not his ways but he
[1:09:04] always does things
[1:09:05] perfectly so i want to read you a quote
[1:09:07] of where i got the title from this
[1:09:09] is from god's provided way of healing in
[1:09:10] 1954 brother brahma says now
[1:09:12] or i'm sorry this isn't the one where i
[1:09:14] got the title but we'll read this first
[1:09:16] now
[1:09:16] when you say you've got faith for divine
[1:09:18] healing and
[1:09:19] something strikes you and says move out
[1:09:21] that's the confirmation that god has
[1:09:23] received your faith for divine healing
[1:09:25] that's right when you got courage to put
[1:09:28] your faith
[1:09:29] in action but when you say you got faith
[1:09:33] and afraid to let it go your faith is
[1:09:35] dead see
[1:09:36] but when you've got faith and willing to
[1:09:37] let it go then god's confirming it
[1:09:40] with signs following and you'll see your
[1:09:43] healing that's true
[1:09:44] when you've got faith so you see
[1:09:46] somebody that says oh i've got faith
[1:09:48] brother nathan
[1:09:48] i've got faith to do this and faith to
[1:09:50] do that but they won't put it into
[1:09:52] action
[1:09:52] oh i've got faith brother god's going to
[1:09:54] send me a wife and scared to death to
[1:09:56] talk to a girl they don't have very much
[1:09:58] faith that they're going to get a wife
[1:10:00] oh i've got faith that god's sending us
[1:10:02] a baby but we're just gonna
[1:10:04] you know we're gonna uh we're gonna buy
[1:10:06] all kinds of collectibles and things and
[1:10:08] and leave the extra guest room for all
[1:10:09] those things and
[1:10:10] all of our hobbies and things like that
[1:10:12] if you really had faith that god was
[1:10:14] sending the baby you'd start making
[1:10:15] preparations
[1:10:16] for the baby room abraham said you know
[1:10:19] he went out there and
[1:10:20] and said give me some diapers and give
[1:10:22] me some baby clothes and give me some
[1:10:23] things like that because his faith
[1:10:25] was put in action because it was real
[1:10:27] faith
[1:10:28] and faith without works you say well i'm
[1:10:30] a christian well you ever go to church
[1:10:32] no i don't ever do that well i question
[1:10:35] whether you're really a christian or not
[1:10:37] now going to church doesn't make you a
[1:10:39] christian any more than
[1:10:41] standing in a garage makes you a ford
[1:10:43] truck but but going to church if you're
[1:10:45] a christian you will do that
[1:10:47] because there's something inside of you
[1:10:48] that wants to obey god's word and god's
[1:10:50] word said forsake not the assembling of
[1:10:52] yourselves together
[1:10:54] amen somebody said well i'm scared i'm
[1:10:56] afraid i'll get culvert i'm afraid i'll
[1:10:58] get this you know what
[1:10:59] i would rather get coveted than live in
[1:11:01] fear of it amen
[1:11:03] uh-oh i would rather get it than live my
[1:11:06] life in fear of it
[1:11:08] amen because god can deliver me of that
[1:11:10] a lot easier than he can deliver me of
[1:11:12] fear brother and said fear is one of the
[1:11:14] worst things
[1:11:15] that the devil can give you and we've
[1:11:18] seen not
[1:11:18] it's not just the world out here it's
[1:11:20] not just our nation
[1:11:21] but you see people in the message just
[1:11:24] bound up by fear
[1:11:25] over what's going on in our nation
[1:11:27] afraid to go outside afraid to do
[1:11:29] anything well
[1:11:30] you know if you've got some pre-existing
[1:11:32] health condition that you already maybe
[1:11:33] shouldn't go outside i understand that i
[1:11:35] understand
[1:11:36] you got to use caution but i don't know
[1:11:38] i remember a president said one time all
[1:11:40] the only thing we have to fear is fear
[1:11:43] itself
[1:11:44] and fear if you're not careful it will
[1:11:46] grip you
[1:11:47] fear will sneak up on you and grip you
[1:11:49] and it'll keep you away from believers
[1:11:51] it'll keep you away from the house of
[1:11:53] god it'll keep you away from everything
[1:11:55] because satan wants to isolate you
[1:11:58] satan wants to isolate you in your home
[1:12:01] and get you away from everybody else and
[1:12:03] brother madam said in thirsting for life
[1:12:05] he said that's the one that the devil
[1:12:06] really works on
[1:12:07] he said the wolves when they go after
[1:12:09] the pack of deer they don't attack the
[1:12:11] big herd when it's together
[1:12:13] but they find that one little one that
[1:12:14] gets off to the side away from everybody
[1:12:16] else and they begin to attack that
[1:12:19] and so we want to be careful we want to
[1:12:20] use wisdom i mean we washed our hands
[1:12:23] out here before we came in
[1:12:24] the people that are concerned you know
[1:12:25] maybe with pre-existing health things
[1:12:27] and things like that
[1:12:28] they're wearing masks there's no problem
[1:12:29] with that but we're here
[1:12:31] amen we're here and so if you don't want
[1:12:33] to wear a mask don't judge the ones that
[1:12:35] are wearing it if you're wearing one
[1:12:36] don't judge the ones that aren't you do
[1:12:38] what god's leading you to do
[1:12:40] brother jack runs his church differently
[1:12:42] than i do because he's dealing with a
[1:12:43] different group he's dealing with the
[1:12:45] different
[1:12:46] different pressures different spirits
[1:12:48] different things like that
[1:12:49] if you went to my church or maybe that
[1:12:51] you'd be in a completely different
[1:12:52] situation there where we're at
[1:12:54] geographically
[1:12:55] the different group of people we've got
[1:12:56] there a different mixed multitude but
[1:12:58] you got a mixed multitude here
[1:13:00] different i'm not just talking about
[1:13:01] race this morning don't get me wrong
[1:13:03] i'm talking about your spiritual walk
[1:13:04] you've got some that have been serving
[1:13:06] him 40 years
[1:13:07] some that have been serving him three
[1:13:08] years some that served him and
[1:13:10] backslidden are trying to come back and
[1:13:12] you've got all kinds of different
[1:13:13] varieties of people
[1:13:14] and so a pastor gets up here and if he
[1:13:16] preaches way up here all the time
[1:13:18] then the ones down here they'll never
[1:13:20] get fed and if he preaches way down here
[1:13:22] all the time the ones up here will say
[1:13:23] oh my goodness why doesn't brother jack
[1:13:25] ever preach anything but life story
[1:13:27] but there's a balance there somewhere
[1:13:29] where he gets in the middle of it and he
[1:13:31] knows his sheep and his sheep know his
[1:13:33] voice
[1:13:33] and he begins to feed the flock and this
[1:13:35] one up here says oh my
[1:13:36] i'm grabbing little nuggets from way up
[1:13:38] here and this one down here says oh
[1:13:40] i'm grabbing some from down here too why
[1:13:42] because it's an atmosphere that he knows
[1:13:44] the people that he's feeding
[1:13:45] and he's dealing with something so he
[1:13:47] has to lead them the way that god leads
[1:13:49] them
[1:13:49] if i just went online and said well this
[1:13:51] is what brother jack's preaching so
[1:13:52] that's what i'll preach
[1:13:53] my people would sit there and say why is
[1:13:55] he preaching this
[1:13:57] we don't even need this in our area amen
[1:13:59] that's why god calls a specific man to
[1:14:02] an
[1:14:02] area and anoints him for what you have
[1:14:04] need of
[1:14:05] and that anointing begins to draw people
[1:14:07] and they don't come and say
[1:14:08] oh i'm african-american so i'll go over
[1:14:10] to brother jack's church or
[1:14:12] i'm white so i'll go over to brother
[1:14:13] nathan's church but it goes beyond
[1:14:15] color and race and there's a seed down
[1:14:18] there on the inside that they say
[1:14:19] this man i don't care what his height is
[1:14:21] i don't care what his weight is
[1:14:23] i don't care what his color is i don't
[1:14:25] care what his nationality is
[1:14:27] he's feeding me something that is
[1:14:29] feeding my soul
[1:14:32] and that anointing begins to pull them
[1:14:34] in
[1:14:36] amen they sit there and say feed me
[1:14:38] brother jack
[1:14:39] i told you the thing brother brother
[1:14:40] troy is excited the theme this food
[1:14:43] me and brother mean brother troy the
[1:14:44] first time i met him we went to a
[1:14:46] ponderosa and me and brother troy tore
[1:14:48] it up
[1:14:50] he was telling brother jack don't tell
[1:14:51] my wife don't tell my wife
[1:14:56] i snuck him into waffle houses and all
[1:14:58] kinds of places when he was with us
[1:15:00] next time he brought his wife don't say
[1:15:02] nothing about those places
[1:15:11] i'm going to get him in trouble sure as
[1:15:13] anything he'll say you just wait till i
[1:15:15] get to new albany i'll pay you back for
[1:15:17] that brother
[1:15:19] brother branham tells the story and
[1:15:21] convinced and then concerned this is
[1:15:22] where i got the sermon titled he said in
[1:15:24] 1962 he said
[1:15:26] remember my father down in kentucky
[1:15:28] years ago
[1:15:29] the crops was all burning up and the old
[1:15:32] circuit preacher come through and
[1:15:34] he was a dandy old man and when he
[1:15:38] went on his knees he stayed there until
[1:15:40] something happened we need more people
[1:15:42] like that don't we
[1:15:43] i mean that shouldn't just be the pastor
[1:15:45] that shouldn't just be the deacons that
[1:15:47] shouldn't just be the sunday school
[1:15:48] teachers but we need people
[1:15:49] that'll stay on their knees till
[1:15:51] something happens amen i've got i think
[1:15:53] it's 20 something pages worth of prayer
[1:15:55] requests that we'll read here shortly
[1:15:57] and you know the people took the time to
[1:15:59] to write these out each prayer request
[1:16:02] and and brother jack said we're going to
[1:16:03] take the time to read them and
[1:16:05] and you know maybe you sit there and you
[1:16:06] think oh my here we are 13 prayer
[1:16:08] requests in and
[1:16:09] but yet if it was you that had a need if
[1:16:12] it was your mother
[1:16:13] or your child or it was you that was
[1:16:15] sick you would want
[1:16:16] somebody to take the time to say look i
[1:16:19] need somebody i need to get in touch
[1:16:21] with somebody
[1:16:22] that'll stay on their knees until god
[1:16:25] does something
[1:16:26] amen not just a little now i'll lay me
[1:16:28] down to sleep and a little jesus wept of
[1:16:30] devotions before we go to bed but i need
[1:16:32] to get in contact with somebody
[1:16:34] that doesn't just know the word they
[1:16:36] know the author amen they know where he
[1:16:38] lives they know his address
[1:16:40] they know his abode that he's not a
[1:16:42] million miles away
[1:16:43] somewhere but he stays right there with
[1:16:46] him
[1:16:47] amen i want to tell you he's on
[1:16:48] haverhill this morning
[1:16:50] amen he's not a million miles away he's
[1:16:53] not in some other church although he is
[1:16:54] there as well
[1:16:55] but he's right here present tense amen
[1:16:59] when brother steve began to sing after
[1:17:00] the end of the service i felt
[1:17:02] him come real close to me and i just had
[1:17:04] to slip away because i said god i don't
[1:17:05] want this anointing to leave me till i
[1:17:07] get up there
[1:17:08] amen i know he's here this morning amen
[1:17:11] i know where he is and that's we want to
[1:17:12] get a hold of somebody that knows where
[1:17:14] he's at
[1:17:15] and how to get a hold of him when
[1:17:16] there's times troubles that come
[1:17:18] the brothers have been with me this week
[1:17:19] and the text message after text message
[1:17:22] and
[1:17:22] phone call after phone call that will
[1:17:24] come in of people needing prayer
[1:17:25] why it's not because i'm anything amen
[1:17:28] it's not because i've done anything
[1:17:29] brother branham said it this way he said
[1:17:31] i've never seen
[1:17:31] i've never healed anybody but he said i
[1:17:34] have seen god do some
[1:17:35] wonderful answers to prayer amen that's
[1:17:38] my testimony this morning
[1:17:40] amen brother jack's never healed anybody
[1:17:42] i've never healed anybody but we've seen
[1:17:44] some phenomenal answers to prayer
[1:17:46] amen so we want somebody that'll stay
[1:17:48] there and pray till something happens
[1:17:51] he says that day they was all want to
[1:17:53] pray for the rain to come pop
[1:17:55] said when that old man went on his knees
[1:17:58] and
[1:17:58] he seen them old shriveled hands went up
[1:18:01] in the air he said oh god i've served
[1:18:03] you
[1:18:03] these people are yours and their crops
[1:18:06] are burning
[1:18:07] pop said he slipped right out of the
[1:18:09] church and went out there and took the
[1:18:11] saddle off his mule
[1:18:12] and throwed it under the church because
[1:18:14] he know the rain
[1:18:16] was a common convinced yes sir and then
[1:18:18] he was concerned about his saddle
[1:18:21] amen there was other people inside
[1:18:23] praying there was other people in there
[1:18:25] maybe
[1:18:25] maybe better christian than brother
[1:18:27] branham's dad was at the time he didn't
[1:18:28] serve the lord until
[1:18:29] way up in his last few moments of life
[1:18:31] and brother bam said he was a sinner
[1:18:33] and yet he prayed there with him as he
[1:18:35] was going into eternity and he received
[1:18:37] salvation
[1:18:38] but here's a man that he didn't know
[1:18:40] what we know
[1:18:42] he wasn't in church as many
[1:18:43] opportunities as we've had but
[1:18:45] but here the crops were burnt over and
[1:18:48] they was in a need and so the families
[1:18:50] gathered together said let's go up to
[1:18:51] the church and
[1:18:52] have the old circuit writer preacher
[1:18:54] we've heard god answer his prayers
[1:18:55] before
[1:18:56] let's let's have him go and and maybe
[1:18:58] he'd heard testimonies maybe brother
[1:19:00] branham's dad there had heard a
[1:19:01] testimony about a little sick baby with
[1:19:03] colic and
[1:19:04] with fever and the doctor said it was
[1:19:06] going to die unless god did something
[1:19:08] and and the circuit writer preacher
[1:19:09] happened to be writing right through
[1:19:11] about that time and they said
[1:19:12] get him to come pray for the baby and
[1:19:14] it'll all be all right and he went and
[1:19:15] laid his hands on the little baby and
[1:19:17] the next morning it was setting up
[1:19:18] perfectly normal
[1:19:20] eating and everything fine maybe there
[1:19:21] were some problems with finances and
[1:19:24] they didn't know how god was
[1:19:25] going to provide and they asked the old
[1:19:26] circuit writer preacher to come
[1:19:28] and the next morning everything just
[1:19:30] began to change and god began to come on
[1:19:32] the scene
[1:19:32] and he'd heard testimonies like this
[1:19:34] before he knew that god answered this
[1:19:36] man's prayer
[1:19:37] and so as he goes along now this this
[1:19:39] drought has come
[1:19:41] and the crops are dying this man gets
[1:19:43] out off of his old saddle and
[1:19:45] he walks into the church and he begins
[1:19:46] to pray and brother brahms dad sees him
[1:19:49] as soon as he begins to pray for prayer
[1:19:50] he said wait a minute wait a minute this
[1:19:52] isn't one of these guys that just talks
[1:19:54] it
[1:19:54] this is a guy that walks it amen this
[1:19:57] isn't just some guy that gets up and
[1:19:58] talks about what jesus did back there in
[1:20:00] history
[1:20:01] but this is a guy that he's actually
[1:20:03] proven that jesus
[1:20:04] has been raised up out of history
[1:20:07] and he slips out the side of the church
[1:20:09] and he begins to unstrap that saddle off
[1:20:11] of his mule
[1:20:12] and he takes it he throws it up
[1:20:14] underneath the church what was he doing
[1:20:15] he put his faith in action that it
[1:20:18] wasn't
[1:20:19] you know he didn't think oh how silly am
[1:20:21] i going to look if we come out in a few
[1:20:22] minutes and there's no rain
[1:20:24] and somebody's going to say hey buddy
[1:20:27] where's your saddle
[1:20:29] you right here bareback or what's going
[1:20:30] on you you ride a new new salomon mule
[1:20:33] or well he didn't care what anybody
[1:20:35] thought he had a lot of money in this
[1:20:37] saddle and he didn't want to get soaked
[1:20:39] so he goes over
[1:20:40] and he begins to untether the saddle
[1:20:42] maybe somebody came out and said what
[1:20:43] are you doing said i'm taking the saddle
[1:20:45] off my mirror
[1:20:46] oh you must be an oh holy roller no i'm
[1:20:48] not even serving the lord the way that i
[1:20:50] should be
[1:20:51] but i know that he answers prayer i've
[1:20:53] seen him move and answer prayer for this
[1:20:55] man and i'm convinced that god's going
[1:20:58] to do something
[1:20:58] and i'm concerned about my saddle he
[1:21:00] takes it off and he throws it up
[1:21:02] underneath the church
[1:21:03] and here comes the rain oh my why
[1:21:07] because he put his faith in action
[1:21:09] there were other people probably better
[1:21:11] christians than him inside praying
[1:21:12] weeping saying oh
[1:21:14] father thou thou now art and i and thee
[1:21:17] and thou
[1:21:17] and and trying to say the right words
[1:21:19] and ringing their hands together
[1:21:21] but he said i'm not worried about the
[1:21:22] words the words have done been spoken
[1:21:24] i'm gonna put it into action and take
[1:21:26] him at his word i
[1:21:28] know the rain's coming amen you ought to
[1:21:30] put your faith in action this morning i
[1:21:32] hope somebody will take the saddle off
[1:21:34] their mule

[1:21:36] nathan oh yes you do yes you do you have
[1:21:39] a need this morning just like there was
[1:21:40] a need there
[1:21:41] and maybe there's something that you're
[1:21:43] holding back at all i couldn't give that
[1:21:45] to god or i couldn't do that
[1:21:46] somebody will make fun of me somebody
[1:21:48] will call me a holy roller put your
[1:21:49] faith in action one time
[1:21:51] take god at his word one time just go
[1:21:54] ahead and take the saddle off your mule
[1:21:56] this morning
[1:21:57] oh i couldn't give up this and i know
[1:21:59] god promised you
[1:22:00] oh my i know god promised if i'd pay my
[1:22:02] tithes he'd rain down the blessings that
[1:22:04] even
[1:22:04] even the heavens wouldn't be able to
[1:22:06] contain but but i got these other
[1:22:08] obligations and things oh i've seen god
[1:22:10] move on the scene
[1:22:11] hallelujah amen i've seen god bless amen
[1:22:14] can i share a testimony about myself
[1:22:16] this morning
[1:22:18] amen we were we had some needs at the
[1:22:20] church we'd moved into our
[1:22:21] new building brother jack came and
[1:22:22] dedicated the church and and the parking
[1:22:24] lot was just all crumbled down and
[1:22:26] eroded and
[1:22:27] we had spent every penny that we had
[1:22:29] saved and everything that everybody
[1:22:30] would loan us to
[1:22:31] try to make a down payment on the church
[1:22:33] and and but we had some needs there was
[1:22:35] this parking lot that they had
[1:22:36] big trucks and things to turn around in
[1:22:38] the parking lot and it just cracked it
[1:22:40] all to pieces and fallen all the pieces
[1:22:42] and and so i you know there was a need
[1:22:44] one time a
[1:22:45] a brother actually his brother donny
[1:22:47] reagan got up at a thanksgiving service
[1:22:49] and he said there
[1:22:50] it was hard for me to enjoy thanksgiving
[1:22:52] he said there were some people
[1:22:53] over in africa in a certain country that
[1:22:55] they were having droughts and things and
[1:22:57] he said due to the famine they've only
[1:22:59] been able to eat the adults have been
[1:23:00] eaten every other day once a meal
[1:23:03] and the children have been eaten once a
[1:23:04] day once a meal and pastors and things
[1:23:06] emailing him asking for help and he said
[1:23:08] there's 40 churches over there that we'd
[1:23:10] like to try to help
[1:23:11] and we're taking up an offering you're
[1:23:12] going to try to send 500 to each of them
[1:23:14] well 500 times 40
[1:23:16] is 20 000 if i calculate with my
[1:23:18] homeschool math correctly so
[1:23:20] he took up an offering and i reached out
[1:23:21] to him and said did you get the amount
[1:23:23] you were looking for he said well
[1:23:24] we're a few thousand dollars short but
[1:23:26] we're close and so i sit down with
[1:23:28] everything in my mind i was going to
[1:23:29] write out a check for 500
[1:23:31] and send it to this mission offering to
[1:23:33] help provide food and things for the
[1:23:35] people over there
[1:23:36] and when i sat down and wrote it out i
[1:23:37] looked and it said a thousand dollars
[1:23:38] and i thought
[1:23:39] i was going to write a 500 brother
[1:23:41] solomon but i wrote a thousand i said
[1:23:42] well
[1:23:43] maybe that was the lord so i sent it on
[1:23:45] on a monday morning i sent the check and
[1:23:47] on
[1:23:48] tuesday or excuse me on wednesday a
[1:23:50] sister came up to me and she said
[1:23:51] brother nathan
[1:23:52] said what should i pay tithes on i like
[1:23:54] questions like that
[1:23:58] what should i pay tithes on i said you
[1:24:00] pay tithes on your increase and she said
[1:24:02] well can you explain what that means to
[1:24:03] me i said well
[1:24:04] if you get your paycheck that's increase
[1:24:06] if you go out here and and somebody
[1:24:08] gives you something you turn around and
[1:24:09] sell it that's increased but
[1:24:11] if you if you go out here and you buy a
[1:24:13] car for eight thousand dollars and five
[1:24:15] years later it's depreciated and you put
[1:24:16] so many miles on it you turn around and
[1:24:18] sell it for five hundred dollars
[1:24:19] that's not increase you actually that
[1:24:21] devaluated so you don't owe ties on that
[1:24:24] and she said well that's that's what i
[1:24:25] thought but i just want to make sure she
[1:24:27] said my husband passed away he
[1:24:28] he left me some inheritance and some
[1:24:30] stocks and things and
[1:24:32] that company just merged with another
[1:24:34] company and they bought all my stocks
[1:24:35] out and
[1:24:36] i i need to pay tithes on it she handed
[1:24:38] me a check for ten thousand dollars
[1:24:40] i thought well praise the lord
[1:24:44] don't don't clap yet that's not the end
[1:24:46] of the testimony
[1:24:47] i'll tell you when it's the end of the
[1:24:48] testimony okay and so i took that ten
[1:24:51] thousand dollars i thought well lord you
[1:24:53] turned around and blessed me so quickly
[1:24:54] i'm gonna send another thousand dollars
[1:24:57] all right
[1:24:58] and so i took and i wrote another check
[1:25:00] i thought now this brother's in contact
[1:25:01] with certain brothers over there but
[1:25:02] there's probably other brothers that are
[1:25:04] in contact with others and so
[1:25:05] i sat down and i wrote out another check
[1:25:07] one thousand dollars
[1:25:08] sent it over there and and they sent it
[1:25:11] through another brother up in ohio that
[1:25:12] was working with another group of
[1:25:14] churches over there
[1:25:15] and i sent it on a tuesday and on
[1:25:17] wednesday a brother who hadn't ever paid
[1:25:19] tithes since he'd been coming to church
[1:25:20] he handed me an envelope
[1:25:22] and i opened it up and he paid me for
[1:25:23] this whole year of salary
[1:25:25] ten thousand dollars i said lord i can
[1:25:28] do this
[1:25:28] all year long
[1:25:33] i can do this all year long lord you
[1:25:36] just keep sending them and i'll keep on
[1:25:38] sinning so i wrote out another check for
[1:25:39] a thousand dollars and sent it
[1:25:41] through another group amen but that's
[1:25:44] where the testimony stops
[1:25:49] amen we had twenty thousand dollars to
[1:25:53] pay for our parking lots
[1:25:55] amen
[1:26:01] so sometimes there's something you've
[1:26:03] gotta do sometimes you've gotta step
[1:26:05] into i don't think that's
[1:26:06] not always just dollars and cents either
[1:26:08] you might be the best best tithe payer
[1:26:10] in the church but
[1:26:11] but maybe you won't put your shoulder to
[1:26:12] the wheel when something comes up that
[1:26:14] needs to be done or
[1:26:15] maybe you're scared to witness because
[1:26:17] you don't have the bible and the message
[1:26:18] memorized god didn't ask you
[1:26:20] to memorize all of the bible and all the
[1:26:22] message he said let your light so
[1:26:24] shine before man brother baby said if
[1:26:26] you can't tell them nothing else
[1:26:28] just tell them how the fire got lit
[1:26:32] just tell them how the fire got it say
[1:26:34] god did something for me
[1:26:36] you know there's some people they want
[1:26:37] to give both both gun barrels all at the
[1:26:39] same time
[1:26:40] tell them serpent seed and god had
[1:26:42] everything they're just standing there
[1:26:43] trying to shop at walmart saying
[1:26:44] i would i ran across a jehovah witness
[1:26:46] or something in there
[1:26:47] i'm not a jehovah witness but i am a
[1:26:49] witness of jehovah all right
[1:26:51] amen and so they want to give both gun
[1:26:53] barrels but you know just start off with
[1:26:55] something small just say oh my
[1:26:57] god's been so good to me and you can
[1:26:58] tell by their reaction if they're hungry
[1:27:00] or if they're an atheist pretty quickly
[1:27:03] if they want anything to do with that
[1:27:04] and just start off small and begin to
[1:27:06] tell them
[1:27:06] god has done so many good things for me
[1:27:08] oh you really god's
[1:27:10] well maybe they're like gideon standing
[1:27:12] there saying if god be god where
[1:27:13] are where be all the miracles and you
[1:27:15] can tell them hey i go to a church where
[1:27:17] a lady had a cancer fall off of her head
[1:27:19] amen i go to a church where people that
[1:27:21] walked in blind and had to be led into
[1:27:23] one service and the next service came in
[1:27:25] and found a seat for themselves that's
[1:27:27] the kind of church i go to
[1:27:29] amen where's it at spirit and truth
[1:27:31] tabernacle down here on haverhill
[1:27:33] all right amen amen welcome anytime you
[1:27:37] come anytime
[1:27:38] amen you can come as you are but if you
[1:27:40] really got a hunger for god down on the
[1:27:42] inside you probably won't stay as you
[1:27:44] are
[1:27:46] amen well glory amen we let people come
[1:27:50] as they are but after a while
[1:27:51] they've really got god down on the
[1:27:52] inside of them when god begins to come
[1:27:54] down on the inside there's something
[1:27:56] about it it just begins to overflow to
[1:27:58] the outside
[1:27:59] and the outside begins to change not
[1:28:01] because of a set of rules
[1:28:02] because but because they recognize that
[1:28:04] hey my bridegroom wants me to act a
[1:28:07] certain way
[1:28:07] and walk a certain way and dress a
[1:28:09] certain way and live a certain way and i
[1:28:11] want to do what's pleasing to my
[1:28:13] bridegroom
[1:28:14] hallelujah amen amen can you imagine
[1:28:17] well maybe you can't imagine i don't
[1:28:18] know i hope not some of you young
[1:28:21] sisters
[1:28:22] you get married and your husband comes
[1:28:23] in he says look
[1:28:25] there's just one thing from the time i
[1:28:28] was a little bitty boy
[1:28:30] all we ever had to eat was pinto beans
[1:28:32] he said just you can cook whatever you
[1:28:34] want
[1:28:34] but whatever you do don't don't bring me
[1:28:36] no pinto beans okay
[1:28:38] i am sick and tired of pinto beans and
[1:28:40] every service he came and
[1:28:43] here's your pinto beans honey you don't
[1:28:45] love that man
[1:28:47] if you love that man you would give him
[1:28:48] what he wanted all right
[1:28:50] brother amen oh don't get too happy
[1:28:52] brother just going to switch the other
[1:28:53] way too
[1:28:56] if you loved that sister you would try
[1:28:58] to do the things that made her happy
[1:29:00] that
[1:29:00] expressed your love to her but then we
[1:29:02] say oh i love jesus but there's just a
[1:29:04] few things in his word that i'm not
[1:29:05] willing
[1:29:06] i'm not willing to give up some things
[1:29:07] some of my personal preferences and
[1:29:09] things
[1:29:10] well then you probably probably don't
[1:29:11] really love him like you should maybe
[1:29:12] it's time you take the saddle off your
[1:29:14] mule
[1:29:15] and put it into action amen
[1:29:19] genesis chapter 6 verse 13 and god said
[1:29:21] unto noah
[1:29:22] the end of all flesh has come before me
[1:29:24] for the earth is filled with violence
[1:29:26] through them and behold i will destroy
[1:29:28] them
[1:29:29] with the earth make thee an ark of
[1:29:30] gopher wood
[1:29:32] rooms shalt thou make in the ark and
[1:29:34] shall pitch it within
[1:29:36] and without with pitch now can you
[1:29:38] imagine this man
[1:29:39] it's never rained before never rained
[1:29:42] one day before as far as science can
[1:29:44] tell
[1:29:44] there's nothing up in the atmosphere
[1:29:46] that can let it rain
[1:29:48] and he starts building a boat and now
[1:29:50] they did have water they did have lakes
[1:29:52] and seas and things god had come down
[1:29:54] and divided the lands from the seas but
[1:29:55] the
[1:29:56] the earth was watered with irrigation as
[1:29:58] it came up through underground fountains
[1:29:59] and things so
[1:30:00] they knew what a boat was but they
[1:30:02] didn't know what an ark was
[1:30:04] i mean that's where a lot of people
[1:30:06] so-called christians are in this age
[1:30:07] they know what a boat is they
[1:30:09] they know what a church is amen oh i go
[1:30:11] to one with 30 000 people and i can slip
[1:30:13] in unnoticed and live any kind of life i
[1:30:15] want and go out well you might know what
[1:30:16] a boat is but you don't know what an ark
[1:30:18] is
[1:30:19] amen an ark is a place of safety to get
[1:30:21] you through the oncoming storms that are
[1:30:23] coming
[1:30:24] an ark of safety to get you through oh
[1:30:26] my moses was in an ark of safety right
[1:30:28] out there in the nile
[1:30:29] there were plenty of other little
[1:30:31] baskets floating around probably
[1:30:33] but he was in the ark of safety so i
[1:30:35] pray tonight or this morning or this
[1:30:36] afternoon or whatever time of day it is
[1:30:38] that she'll get in the ark of safety
[1:30:40] amen it's not just a church address it's
[1:30:42] not just a doctrine it's not just a
[1:30:44] personality around the message or a
[1:30:46] theme or a group
[1:30:47] but it's jesus christ as the ark of
[1:30:49] safety
[1:30:50] amen so moses or moses didn't build it
[1:30:53] but noah he goes out there and he begins
[1:30:54] to build on this ark
[1:30:56] and he gets him some gopher wood and he
[1:30:57] goes out there and he begins to cut it
[1:30:59] down
[1:30:59] and one of his neighbors walked by
[1:31:00] brother son they said
[1:31:02] what are you building man you building a
[1:31:04] canoe no it's going to be a lot bigger
[1:31:06] than a canoe i know that's all it looks
[1:31:07] like right now but
[1:31:08] i've only been working on this a few
[1:31:09] days
[1:31:11] what kind of woods you use this is this
[1:31:14] is gopher wood
[1:31:18] are you kidding me man what is this
[1:31:19] really it's a boat actually it's going
[1:31:21] to be an arc it's going to be about
[1:31:23] this long about this wide and this high
[1:31:24] and we're going to have all kinds of
[1:31:26] room would you like to come be a part of
[1:31:27] it
[1:31:28] you are crazy you are crazy
[1:31:31] go for wood have you ever have you ever
[1:31:33] put gopher wood in anything and see it
[1:31:35] soak up water and go
[1:31:37] down to the bottom you're a nut i'm
[1:31:38] getting out of here anybody seen this
[1:31:40] holy roller over here
[1:31:42] building an ark with gopher wood right
[1:31:44] but it wasn't the finished product yet
[1:31:47] he still had some work to do and people
[1:31:49] would go about maybe people
[1:31:51] drove by brother jack's house you see uh
[1:31:53] you see our crazy neighbor over here
[1:31:55] he left a great big church in heaven
[1:31:56] church in his living room what a crazy
[1:31:58] guy
[1:31:59] but god was doing something that they
[1:32:00] couldn't see the finished product
[1:32:02] god was doing something maybe god was
[1:32:04] doing something with you when you left
[1:32:06] your home and your family and maybe
[1:32:07] moved from miles away to come to a
[1:32:09] little church in a storefront they said
[1:32:10] what are you nuts we've got a mega
[1:32:12] church right down the street but they
[1:32:14] didn't see the finished product of what
[1:32:15] god was trying to do
[1:32:17] they didn't see what god was trying to
[1:32:18] do and so noah goes out here
[1:32:21] no scientific proof no ability to
[1:32:23] understand he wasn't a boat builder
[1:32:25] but he goes out here and he starts
[1:32:27] carving away at this old gopher wood
[1:32:29] and my it would just sink as soon as
[1:32:31] anything but god told him when you get
[1:32:32] it done
[1:32:33] noah take it and pitch it within and
[1:32:36] pitch it without not just enough to be
[1:32:37] sanctified on the inside but got to
[1:32:39] sanctify the thing on the outside a
[1:32:40] little bit too
[1:32:42] and so he begins to go and he took the
[1:32:43] saddle off his mule as we would say
[1:32:46] and he took god at his word and put it
[1:32:47] into action now if he would have just
[1:32:49] had faith without works he would have
[1:32:51] said oh
[1:32:52] i believe god sent in the rain folks he
[1:32:54] that got up every sunday morning
[1:32:55] you all better be careful you all better
[1:32:57] stay prayed up you better go to this
[1:32:58] church right here
[1:32:59] because god is sin in the rain right but
[1:33:02] he would wait another year before he
[1:33:04] actually got his hammer and his saw and
[1:33:06] the wood and
[1:33:07] another year to go by you all better get
[1:33:10] ready
[1:33:11] you better get ready there's a reign of
[1:33:13] coming get on the ark
[1:33:14] well noah if you don't have faith enough
[1:33:16] to build the thing yourself how are we
[1:33:18] going to have faith to
[1:33:19] go anywhere and follow you see you know
[1:33:21] you got some of these people mentalities
[1:33:23] in politics and churches and
[1:33:25] pastors and husbands and homes and
[1:33:27] things they want to lead but from behind
[1:33:29] and let everybody else do it but i
[1:33:31] i can't follow a man like that but i can
[1:33:32] follow a man that'll go out there on the
[1:33:34] front lines and say
[1:33:35] follow me amen this is the way follow me
[1:33:38] and noah got out there and he began to
[1:33:40] work away why because he was putting his
[1:33:42] faith in action
[1:33:43] it was more than just talk amen so you
[1:33:47] can come to church all you want you can
[1:33:48] quote to your blue in the face
[1:33:50] you can quote your bible to somebody out
[1:33:51] here on the street and shake your fist
[1:33:53] and say
[1:33:53] god said this and god said that but if
[1:33:55] they don't see you put that faith in
[1:33:57] action
[1:33:58] to actually live the way that you're
[1:33:59] talking about why would they want what
[1:34:01] you've got
[1:34:04] take the saddle off your mule brother
[1:34:07] says in god's preparation 1954 if god
[1:34:10] come down in this building tonight
[1:34:11] and said it's going to rain tomorrow
[1:34:14] well if i went everywhere i'd take my
[1:34:15] umbrella
[1:34:17] it'd be easy for me to take my umbrella
[1:34:19] if the sun was shining ever so bright
[1:34:21] because i know it was going to rain
[1:34:23] and when god says anything he's going to
[1:34:25] do it and you can just depend
[1:34:27] if he says don't plant any crops this
[1:34:29] year there won't there won't be anything
[1:34:31] raised you'd never
[1:34:32] see me putting any seed in the ground
[1:34:35] because if he said
[1:34:36] because it'd be easy for me to believe
[1:34:38] that god said so
[1:34:39] and what god says it's easy for me to
[1:34:42] believe that he'll do it
[1:34:44] amen what if you feel that way this
[1:34:46] morning you ought to be the happiest
[1:34:47] person on the face of the earth that
[1:34:49] it's just
[1:34:49] easy for us to believe what god said
[1:34:51] when we go down through and we read
[1:34:53] god's word we look at something we say
[1:34:54] oh my goodness brother solomon did you
[1:34:56] ever see that right there oh my
[1:34:58] i you know i don't feel like i'm living
[1:35:00] up to that brother solomon but that
[1:35:01] i want to be identified with what his
[1:35:03] word says right there i believe it's his
[1:35:05] word i take him in his word i believe it
[1:35:07] because there's just something down on
[1:35:08] the inside of me even though i've been
[1:35:10] wrong many times
[1:35:11] i've never claimed that god's word was
[1:35:13] wrong amen even though i
[1:35:15] even though i i've come up short many
[1:35:17] times his word has never come up short
[1:35:21] and so there's something about it when
[1:35:23] you really believe god it's easy for you
[1:35:25] to take him at his word
[1:35:27] and say look i i believe i believe it i
[1:35:30] might not be able to explain it
[1:35:31] scientifically
[1:35:32] i may not be able to figure it all out
[1:35:34] intellectually but there's something
[1:35:36] down on the inside that i'm able to put
[1:35:38] my faith in
[1:35:39] action and say i believe
[1:35:42] i take god at his word if god said it's
[1:35:43] going to rain i'm not going out tomorrow
[1:35:45] leaving my umbrella at home
[1:35:47] because god said it's going to rain if
[1:35:49] god said it's going to rain
[1:35:50] i'm going to do this if god said he'd
[1:35:52] provide i'm not going to lay it in bed
[1:35:54] at night and worry every night oh god
[1:35:56] how will i provide tomorrow
[1:35:58] god what about my job what about this
[1:36:00] what about that you know i told the
[1:36:01] brothers on the way here
[1:36:02] even if the ceo of your company is
[1:36:05] against you
[1:36:05] and wants to fire you if god wants you
[1:36:08] to have that job
[1:36:09] there's nobody that god can change the
[1:36:11] ceo
[1:36:12] god can change the whole picture because
[1:36:14] when god opens a door
[1:36:16] no man can shut it and when god shuts
[1:36:19] the door no man can open it
[1:36:24] take him at his word this morning put
[1:36:27] your faith in action abraham
[1:36:29] when god came and spoke to him he was
[1:36:31] going to have a son he put his faith in
[1:36:32] action
[1:36:33] he began to make preparations and then
[1:36:35] years later
[1:36:36] this promised son that he'd waited for
[1:36:38] 25 years
[1:36:40] god said take him up on mount moriah
[1:36:42] there and kill him
[1:36:44] the son that i've waited for for 25
[1:36:46] years most of us we waited nine months
[1:36:48] and that was long enough we thought when
[1:36:50] is this baby gonna get here
[1:36:51] and we acted like it was such a trial
[1:36:53] for us you know waiting nine months
[1:36:54] while our wife was
[1:36:55] trying to get through doors and walking
[1:36:58] around like this
[1:36:58] and and we said goodness that
[1:37:02] that pregnancy was rough that birth you
[1:37:04] know i was i was a nervous wreck he was
[1:37:06] a nervous wreck
[1:37:07] you didn't he was just walking up and
[1:37:08] down outside in the hallway
[1:37:11] all right
[1:37:14] but he waits for this son for 25 years
[1:37:18] and now god gives him the son he gets to
[1:37:20] be up about
[1:37:21] teenage years age and
[1:37:25] god god tells him take him up to mount
[1:37:27] moriah
[1:37:29] kill him and he goes and he gets
[1:37:33] the lad and he gets the the donkeys and
[1:37:36] he gets the wood for the offering and
[1:37:38] the sacrifice and
[1:37:39] he he begins on a journey tells his wife
[1:37:41] says i'll be back in a little bit and
[1:37:43] him and
[1:37:44] his son begin to go up the mountain as
[1:37:46] they get to the foot of the mountain he
[1:37:47] tells his servants he says
[1:37:49] you wait here you wait here with the
[1:37:51] donkeys and me and the lad
[1:37:53] we're gonna go yonder and worship and
[1:37:56] we're gonna come back to you
[1:38:00] we'll go yonder and worship and then
[1:38:02] we'll come back to you how are you going
[1:38:04] to do it abraham
[1:38:05] how are you going to do it god said that
[1:38:07] to sacrifice that son and even isaac
[1:38:09] begins to wonder he said
[1:38:10] daddy i i see the i see the donkeys here
[1:38:14] i see the the wood for the sacrifice but
[1:38:17] he says
[1:38:18] where where's the lamb and abraham
[1:38:21] tells him in in verse 8 of genesis
[1:38:23] chapter 22 he says
[1:38:26] my son god will provide himself a lamb
[1:38:30] i like the way he phrases this because
[1:38:32] he didn't say god will provide a lamb
[1:38:34] or god will provide you a lamb or god
[1:38:37] will provide me a lamb
[1:38:38] he by anointing he looks forward and by
[1:38:41] the anointing of what's coming down the
[1:38:42] road thousands of years later
[1:38:44] what's going to happen at the cross and
[1:38:46] this being a type of that he says
[1:38:48] god will provide himself a sacrifice
[1:38:52] god will provide himself as a lamb god
[1:38:55] will provide himself and he will come
[1:38:58] and be a lamb for us and so they go on
[1:39:00] further and
[1:39:01] and and god begins to see what abraham
[1:39:03] will do now god knew all along
[1:39:05] what abraham would do but he's trying to
[1:39:07] prove to abraham
[1:39:08] that there was something down in abraham
[1:39:10] that was more than abraham realized was
[1:39:12] down in there many times you know we get
[1:39:14] in a situation
[1:39:15] and god knew before the foundation of
[1:39:16] the world brother stephen just read a
[1:39:18] scripture a few moments ago
[1:39:19] he knew what your body would look like
[1:39:21] he knew what your thoughts would be
[1:39:23] he knew what your future is still going
[1:39:24] to be today god looked down through time
[1:39:26] and saw all that
[1:39:27] so god knew how that abraham would react
[1:39:29] to this trial but he was allowing this
[1:39:31] pressure to come
[1:39:33] so that abraham could know how that
[1:39:34] abraham would react to the trial
[1:39:36] because those moments of pressure we
[1:39:38] begin to realize you know what there was
[1:39:40] something down on the inside
[1:39:41] that was holding me even when i couldn't
[1:39:44] hold on any longer
[1:39:45] and when i couldn't go on any further
[1:39:47] there was somebody that picked me up and
[1:39:49] carried me through the trial
[1:39:51] and abraham begins to realize a little
[1:39:53] bit about himself this character
[1:39:55] is a victory remember hebrews chapter 11
[1:39:58] verse 17
[1:39:59] by faith abraham when he was tried
[1:40:01] offered up isaac and he
[1:40:03] that he had and he that he had received
[1:40:06] the promise
[1:40:07] offered up his only begotten son of whom
[1:40:09] it was said that in isaac
[1:40:11] shall thy seed be called accounting that
[1:40:14] god was able to raise him up
[1:40:15] even from the dead from whence also he
[1:40:18] received him
[1:40:19] in a figure he felt like you know what
[1:40:21] if god could give me this child
[1:40:24] when my own body was dead and couldn't
[1:40:26] produce a child and god could do all
[1:40:28] that
[1:40:28] then if god allows me to get to that
[1:40:30] point where i take his life
[1:40:32] then god's able to restore this son to
[1:40:34] me amen but god didn't let him get that
[1:40:36] far
[1:40:37] maybe there's some of you that maybe you
[1:40:38] ran maybe you tried to run from god
[1:40:41] and you thought oh my i can't i can't do
[1:40:44] this church stuff
[1:40:45] i can't i can't live this message life i
[1:40:47] can't walk this walk so i'll get out
[1:40:48] here and that thirst that was down on
[1:40:50] the inside of you for god
[1:40:51] you began to run further and further and
[1:40:54] further but there was a certain spot
[1:40:55] where god would get you and he'd say no
[1:40:56] i can't let you go any further
[1:40:58] i can't let you go any further than that
[1:41:00] and he'd begin to just reel you back in
[1:41:02] a little bit at a time and
[1:41:03] you'd run again saying oh god i can't do
[1:41:06] that and you'd get out to a certain spot
[1:41:08] and he'd stop me and say no i can't let
[1:41:09] you go that far
[1:41:11] amen and so god allows abraham to get to
[1:41:13] a certain point and the angel stops his
[1:41:15] hand says abram
[1:41:16] abraham said i i've proved you i just
[1:41:19] i wanted you to know that i mean more to
[1:41:22] you than anything
[1:41:24] he was willing to take the saddle off of
[1:41:26] his mule he was willing
[1:41:27] not to just sit around and talk about it
[1:41:29] at the dinner table but he was willing
[1:41:31] to put his faith into action
[1:41:33] there was a woman one time in the bible
[1:41:37] had a little boy god had given this
[1:41:40] child
[1:41:40] through the mouth of a prophet she
[1:41:42] hadn't had any children and
[1:41:44] he he told her that she would have a
[1:41:46] child
[1:41:47] and one day this little boy begins to
[1:41:49] get overheated and
[1:41:50] and he has a heat stroke and they take
[1:41:53] him in and and she takes him
[1:41:55] and she puts him in on on the prophet's
[1:41:58] bed which was a pretty good place to put
[1:42:00] him
[1:42:01] she recognized that that anointing
[1:42:02] followed the prophet that whatever he
[1:42:04] touched was blessed and
[1:42:06] she takes him in there and places him on
[1:42:09] on the bed of the prophet but that
[1:42:10] wasn't her faith wasn't just in the bed
[1:42:12] of the prophet
[1:42:13] she was wanting to hear him speak the
[1:42:15] word and so
[1:42:16] she begins to go and she said i'm going
[1:42:19] to go find the man of god and her
[1:42:20] husband began to discourage her he said
[1:42:22] it's neither new moon or sabbath and
[1:42:24] said
[1:42:25] you won't how will you know where to
[1:42:26] find him she said i'm going to go and
[1:42:28] i'm going to find him
[1:42:30] and instead of putting the saddle off of
[1:42:31] her mule she goes and puts a saddle on
[1:42:34] the mule in this case
[1:42:36] second kings chapter 4 verse 22 and she
[1:42:38] called unto her husband and said send me
[1:42:40] i pray thee one of the young men and one
[1:42:42] of the asses that i may run to the man
[1:42:44] of god and come again
[1:42:46] and he said wherefore without go to him
[1:42:48] today it is neither new moon nor sabbath
[1:42:50] and she said it shall be well
[1:42:54] it shall be well now it's one thing to
[1:42:56] say it it's another thing to put it into
[1:42:58] action
[1:42:59] then she saddled an ass and said unto
[1:43:01] her servant drive and go forward
[1:43:03] slack not thy writing for me except i
[1:43:06] bid thee so she went and came into the
[1:43:07] man of god to mount carmel
[1:43:09] and it came to pass that when the man of
[1:43:11] god saw her afar off
[1:43:12] that he said to hazel his servant behold
[1:43:15] yonder is the shunammite
[1:43:16] run now i pray thee to meet her and say
[1:43:19] unto her
[1:43:20] is it well with thee is it well with the
[1:43:22] husband
[1:43:23] is it well with the child and she
[1:43:26] answered
[1:43:27] it is well come on
[1:43:30] now if you'd have been standing there
[1:43:31] you just thought here we
[1:43:33] i've drove you all this way i saddled
[1:43:36] this
[1:43:36] this mule for you and i i wrote you all
[1:43:39] this way you told me not to slow down
[1:43:40] for nothing
[1:43:41] and we get here and he asks you is
[1:43:42] everything okay with you oh everything's
[1:43:44] good
[1:43:45] everything okay with your husband we
[1:43:46] just left your husband back there about
[1:43:48] to have a nervous breakdown
[1:43:49] he's blaming himself because he let he
[1:43:51] let your son get out there and work too
[1:43:53] long
[1:43:53] and got overheated and he's sitting back
[1:43:55] there with guilt and shame and all kinds
[1:43:57] of emotions about to have a nervous
[1:43:59] breakdown and you said
[1:44:00] all is well your little babies back
[1:44:03] there laying on a bed dead as a doorknob
[1:44:05] and you said all is well she's putting
[1:44:09] her faith into action
[1:44:10] she's putting her faith in action she's
[1:44:12] saying i i didn't just believe god in
[1:44:14] the good times
[1:44:15] i didn't just believe god up on the
[1:44:17] mountaintop but even through the valley
[1:44:18] of the shadow of death
[1:44:20] even though he slay me yet will i trust
[1:44:22] him
[1:44:25] it is well oh my you know the rest of
[1:44:28] the story he goes in
[1:44:30] takes the child up and begins to lay on
[1:44:32] the bed there and
[1:44:33] the child is resurrected we recognize
[1:44:37] that he's still god
[1:44:39] he's still jehovah jireh he's still a
[1:44:42] god that's a provider
[1:44:44] amen let's skip over the quote in love
[1:44:47] love in 1956
[1:44:49] brother brahm talks about when he goes
[1:44:50] to memphis there
[1:44:52] and he's he's going to he's his plane
[1:44:55] has been grounded due to weather
[1:44:57] and you know he's he's staying at a nice
[1:45:00] hotel that the airport put him up in
[1:45:02] there
[1:45:02] and he goes down to mail some letters
[1:45:04] and and he's looking through some
[1:45:06] windows and things they're doing a
[1:45:07] little window shopping and
[1:45:08] a voice tells him just keep walking just
[1:45:11] keep walking he starts walking he gets
[1:45:13] into a worse area town
[1:45:14] and a worse area town his voice keeps
[1:45:17] telling him just keep walking
[1:45:19] just keep walking doesn't matter what
[1:45:20] anybody thinks
[1:45:22] it doesn't matter what the devil is
[1:45:23] trying to tell you and put fear on you
[1:45:25] just keep walking and all of a sudden he
[1:45:27] walks along and he sees a lady standing
[1:45:29] there by a fence
[1:45:30] with a man's shirt tied around her head
[1:45:32] and she says good morning parson
[1:45:36] he said parson how did you know i was a
[1:45:38] parson
[1:45:39] and the quote she says she said i prayed
[1:45:42] for two days and this morning about
[1:45:44] three o'clock i was dreaming and i
[1:45:46] dreamed i was talking to the lord
[1:45:48] and i said lord where is your elisha she
[1:45:51] was like the shunammite woman
[1:45:53] god gave her a child but she said i was
[1:45:55] like that type of woman but where's your
[1:45:57] elisha
[1:45:58] and said i seen a man coming with a gray
[1:46:00] suit on with a little bitty semi-western
[1:46:02] hat
[1:46:02] he said that's the way i was dressed
[1:46:04] said he said just wait
[1:46:06] and said i walked right out here and
[1:46:08] been standing here ever since
[1:46:10] i knowed you were coming where is your
[1:46:13] elisha just wait
[1:46:16] and she didn't say okay go turn over and
[1:46:18] go back to sleep
[1:46:19] she walks out of her house and she walks
[1:46:21] down by the fence
[1:46:23] and she said this i saw him coming this
[1:46:25] way
[1:46:26] he was headed right down the street this
[1:46:27] way and she stood there and she waited
[1:46:29] five minutes went by she didn't say well
[1:46:32] i guess it was just a dream
[1:46:34] i i guess it was just those banana
[1:46:35] peppers i ate last night
[1:46:38] said no no god said so
[1:46:42] i know i'm like that cinnamon woman but
[1:46:44] god said he's sending his elisha
[1:46:46] so i'm going to stand here i'm taking
[1:46:47] the saddle up my mule
[1:46:49] i'm putting my faith into action and i'm
[1:46:51] going to stand here until i see the
[1:46:53] promise
[1:46:55] amen i knowed you as a coming
[1:46:58] oh my god's a good god isn't he
[1:47:01] i think that did you sing earlier my god
[1:47:03] shall supply no brother jack hasn't sang
[1:47:05] that yet maybe that'd be a good one for
[1:47:07] after service
[1:47:08] my god shall supply all your needs
[1:47:12] according to his riches in glory
[1:47:17] that's more than just a song that's
[1:47:18] philippians chapter 4 verse 19.
[1:47:21] my god shall supply all your need
[1:47:25] he didn't say he'd provide all your want
[1:47:27] that's the problem with a lot of us
[1:47:29] we get out of church and we get busy and
[1:47:31] we stop praying and we stop reading our
[1:47:33] bible and we stop listening to the
[1:47:35] message and
[1:47:36] we stopped doing all these things
[1:47:37] because we get so busy because
[1:47:39] i got to get a bigger house than brother
[1:47:40] solomon i i got to get a bigger boat
[1:47:42] than brother stephen i don't know if
[1:47:43] brother stephen has a boat or not but
[1:47:45] i got to get a newer vehicle than this
[1:47:47] brother and i got to get a bigger this
[1:47:48] and bigger that so
[1:47:49] i'll start working overtime and the wife
[1:47:51] will start working overtime and
[1:47:53] and why because we're trying to feed our
[1:47:54] needs all the time but god didn't
[1:47:56] promise that
[1:47:57] he said i'll supply all your needs i'm a
[1:48:00] witness
[1:48:01] this afternoon he will supply all of
[1:48:04] your needs
[1:48:05] it may look impossible sometimes but he
[1:48:08] will supply all your needs
[1:48:10] but sometimes we're afraid to take the
[1:48:12] saddle off the mule
[1:48:13] we we want to do something ourselves
[1:48:15] i'll go out here and i'll work three
[1:48:16] jobs and
[1:48:17] i i won't be there for my kids because i
[1:48:19] i'll have babysitters and i'll have this
[1:48:21] and all that but
[1:48:22] but you know what we'll live in a in a
[1:48:25] five more square foot bigger house and
[1:48:27] we'll do this and we'll do that we'll
[1:48:28] drive a year newer vehicle and
[1:48:30] i won't be able to spend any time with
[1:48:31] my family or any time with god but
[1:48:33] we'll build we'll build bigger barns and
[1:48:36] tear them down and build bigger barns
[1:48:38] and there was a man like that in the
[1:48:39] bible
[1:48:40] go and read sometime how he turned out
[1:48:43] take some time for god take some time
[1:48:46] for your family
[1:48:48] amen i've never heard anybody's
[1:48:50] testimony on their deathbed say
[1:48:52] oh if i'd only work some more over time
[1:48:58] all right all right
[1:49:01] that's not the testimony oh god
[1:49:05] all those wasted years all those wasted
[1:49:07] hours
[1:49:08] all those wasted moments i could have
[1:49:09] been back there with my wife and my
[1:49:11] children
[1:49:11] spending time with them watching them
[1:49:13] grow up i could have been down there at
[1:49:14] the altar with them taking communion at
[1:49:16] the church
[1:49:17] we could have been spending time
[1:49:18] together but i was so busy writing my
[1:49:21] mule that i couldn't take the saddle off
[1:49:23] and put my faith in action and take god
[1:49:25] at his word that he would provide for me
[1:49:28] first kings chapter 17 verse 13 there
[1:49:31] had been a famine in the year
[1:49:32] no rain because the prophet of god had
[1:49:34] called for it not to reign
[1:49:36] because of the sin that had entered into
[1:49:37] the nation and elijah
[1:49:39] had been fed by ravens and been watered
[1:49:42] by the brook cedric there and
[1:49:44] god had provided for him at a time where
[1:49:46] it seemed like there was no provisions
[1:49:48] but now the brook begins to dry up and
[1:49:50] god tells him go
[1:49:51] into the the city here there's a woman
[1:49:53] that'll provide for you a widow woman
[1:49:55] and
[1:49:56] so elijah begins to walk down the road
[1:49:58] and he gets to a place where there's a
[1:50:00] woman gathering two sticks
[1:50:01] and to make a fire and brother bam said
[1:50:03] those two sticks represented the cross
[1:50:05] and
[1:50:06] and she's getting things together and he
[1:50:07] says look he said go and make me a cake
[1:50:10] and bring me a little
[1:50:11] a little bit of water and she said
[1:50:13] that's all i've got left sir
[1:50:15] and i'm getting ready to give that to my
[1:50:16] son and we're going to lay down and die
[1:50:20] he said well go and bring me some first
[1:50:23] what a request
[1:50:24] this is the last thing i've got this is
[1:50:27] my last hope
[1:50:28] that maybe if we can get through a few
[1:50:30] more hours maybe it'll rain
[1:50:32] enough to fill up a bucket out here to
[1:50:34] get some water this is my last hope
[1:50:37] and you're coming to rob me of the only
[1:50:38] hope i've got no no he's coming to give
[1:50:41] you hope
[1:50:42] amen it's those darkest of hours that's
[1:50:44] when jesus comes along
[1:50:46] amen brother jonathan was given his
[1:50:48] testimony the other day and he said it
[1:50:50] it got pretty dark the darkest of ours
[1:50:52] but then jesus came along that's when he
[1:50:55] comes along
[1:50:56] and elijah tells her fear not if there
[1:50:59] was ever a time to fear you'd think that
[1:51:00] was a time to fear
[1:51:02] eating our last meal and laying down to
[1:51:04] die
[1:51:05] i think i've got a right to have a
[1:51:07] little bit of fear he said fear not
[1:51:09] go and do that as thou has said but make
[1:51:12] me thereof
[1:51:13] a little cake first and bring it unto me
[1:51:15] and after make for thee and for thy son
[1:51:17] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:51:20] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[1:51:22] neither shall the cruce of oil fail
[1:51:24] until the day that the lord sendeth rain
[1:51:27] upon the earth
[1:51:28] now is this just some history like
[1:51:30] abraham lincoln or george washington
[1:51:32] that
[1:51:32] something way back there if you're
[1:51:34] serving a god like that i hope we can
[1:51:35] introduce you
[1:51:36] to a god that's been raised up out of
[1:51:38] history amen he is still the same god
[1:51:40] this morning for you
[1:51:42] the same god that could provide back
[1:51:44] there he's still the same god he came
[1:51:46] with us saith the lord god will provide
[1:51:48] for you well i'm not a prophet but i've
[1:51:49] got a book that says thus saith the lord
[1:51:51] i shall provide all of your needs
[1:51:56] and she went and did according to the
[1:51:57] saying of elijah and see in her house
[1:52:00] and he'd he and her house did eat many
[1:52:03] days
[1:52:04] and the barrel of meal wasted not
[1:52:06] neither did the cruce of oil fail
[1:52:08] according to the word of the lord which
[1:52:10] he spake by elijah
[1:52:12] she put her faith in action brother jack
[1:52:15] this was the last thing that she had
[1:52:17] but she had confidence in the word of
[1:52:19] god that thus saith the lord god will
[1:52:22] provide how's he going to provide i
[1:52:23] don't know
[1:52:24] how is he going to do it scientifically
[1:52:26] prove it to me we haven't had any rain
[1:52:28] there's not any food left in the
[1:52:30] granaries how's he going to provide
[1:52:32] i don't know but he can do it
[1:52:33] supernaturally
[1:52:36] amen she goes in there and she begins to
[1:52:38] pour out that oil
[1:52:39] and she she pours out almost that last
[1:52:41] little drop and sets it back
[1:52:43] and looks down there maybe just a few
[1:52:44] little drops left and
[1:52:47] she fills back up said how on earth did
[1:52:49] that happen
[1:52:51] and she goes in and scoops out that last
[1:52:53] little bit of meal
[1:52:54] and she looks in and there's still that
[1:52:55] same amount of meal and she scoops it
[1:52:57] again
[1:52:58] and there's more meal and she scoops it
[1:53:00] again there's one how did that happen
[1:53:02] because jehovah jireh
[1:53:03] is still a provider amen he didn't stop
[1:53:07] back in the days of abraham
[1:53:09] she could have looked at a historical
[1:53:10] god and said well he provided a ram for
[1:53:12] abraham but i'm not abraham it's just
[1:53:14] me amen borrowing from brother stephen
[1:53:17] now
[1:53:18] i'm not abraham i'm not brother branham
[1:53:21] i'm not one of some of these great i'm
[1:53:23] not a david or
[1:53:25] we don't want to be a goliath we're not
[1:53:27] a david or a jephthah or
[1:53:28] are some of these back there it's just
[1:53:31] me
[1:53:32] that's probably how david felt there
[1:53:34] when he got that sling out of his pocket
[1:53:37] all this army standing back here behind
[1:53:39] me the king
[1:53:40] my older brothers it's just me lord he
[1:53:43] said yeah but i equipped you with
[1:53:44] something
[1:53:45] i equipped you with something you just
[1:53:47] take the saddle off your mule and let me
[1:53:49] do the rest
[1:53:54] there's a man he was a missionary
[1:53:57] and he also had orphanages for children
[1:54:00] by the name of george mueller
[1:54:02] and god would provide supernaturally for
[1:54:04] them time and time again
[1:54:07] and i'm going to read you a quote from
[1:54:08] wikipedia this morning
[1:54:10] amen you can go read this he's got an
[1:54:12] autobiography that you can read this
[1:54:14] in or he's got a book i think called
[1:54:15] answers to prayers but
[1:54:17] i'm going to read it to you as i copied
[1:54:19] it out of wikipedia this man george
[1:54:21] mueller from the 1800s it says many
[1:54:23] times
[1:54:24] he received unsolicited food donations
[1:54:27] only hours before they were needed to
[1:54:29] feed the children further strengthening
[1:54:30] his faith in god
[1:54:32] for example on one well-documented
[1:54:34] occasion
[1:54:35] they gave thanks for breakfast when all
[1:54:38] the children were sitting at the table
[1:54:40] even though there was nothing to eat in
[1:54:42] the house
[1:54:45] nothing to eat in the house said george
[1:54:47] you're crazy
[1:54:48] ask the blessing over what the dust
[1:54:51] underneath the table
[1:54:52] ask the blessing there's nothing in the
[1:54:54] pantry
[1:54:56] there's nothing in the icebox there's
[1:54:59] nothing we're out of everything
[1:55:01] we don't have anything he said let's
[1:55:02] just sit down and ask the blessing
[1:55:05] he said i don't understand george said
[1:55:08] you've been pretty good to me so far but
[1:55:09] here i am a teenager and i know
[1:55:11] everything now
[1:55:12] and i don't understand how god's going
[1:55:14] to provide for us
[1:55:15] so you just sit down and hush a minute
[1:55:17] just calm down
[1:55:18] quiet down a little bit we're going to
[1:55:20] sit in and thank god for provisions
[1:55:23] we're going to bless the food that we're
[1:55:25] about to receive
[1:55:27] what food george there ain't no food i
[1:55:28] don't have no food but i have a promise
[1:55:31] that my god shall supply all thy need
[1:55:36] and we have a need this morning anybody
[1:55:37] got a need this morning
[1:55:39] maybe it's a financial need maybe it's a
[1:55:41] spiritual need
[1:55:42] maybe the devil's lied to you and said
[1:55:44] oh you'll never make it
[1:55:46] you'll never make it you've ran too far
[1:55:48] you've made too many mistakes
[1:55:50] your family history and all these things
[1:55:52] back here behind you
[1:55:53] look how far you ran look how far you
[1:55:55] stooped oh my
[1:55:58] this bible is full of men and women like
[1:56:00] that
[1:56:01] that ran to a place where they thought
[1:56:03] they'd ran too far and god said no
[1:56:05] my grace is sufficient my blood
[1:56:08] cleanseth men from
[1:56:09] all sin a double
[1:56:12] l i know a lot of message folks they
[1:56:15] have a spreadsheet and they've got this
[1:56:16] one big list of
[1:56:17] forgivable sins and all these other
[1:56:19] lists of unforgivable sins
[1:56:21] but there's only one unpardonable sin
[1:56:23] and it ain't divorced
[1:56:28] it ain't anything else that you can name
[1:56:29] except blaspheming the holy ghost
[1:56:33] blaspheming the holy ghost
[1:56:37] so the devil might whisper to you and
[1:56:39] say you've gone too far but you tell him
[1:56:40] he's a liar
[1:56:43] he said we've got a need this morning
[1:56:45] lord we've got needs represented here
[1:56:47] i've got little orphan kids here
[1:56:49] they're hungry they're thirsty we have a
[1:56:53] need but we just want to thank you in
[1:56:54] advance for the food that you're about
[1:56:57] to prepare for us
[1:56:58] we want to ask that you'd sanctify it
[1:57:00] for the good of our bodies
[1:57:02] george you've lost your mind george
[1:57:04] you're blessing food that's not there
[1:57:06] you're
[1:57:06] giving thanks for something that's well
[1:57:08] i preached wednesday night on praise
[1:57:10] him anyhow amen praise him in advance
[1:57:14] the man there that brother brahm talked
[1:57:16] about blind john ryan he said you go
[1:57:18] and you start saying thank god for
[1:57:20] healing me
[1:57:21] the man was still as blind as a bat but
[1:57:24] he said thank god for healing me and
[1:57:25] brother bam said
[1:57:26] your god will make your body obey your
[1:57:29] confession
[1:57:30] that you begin to testify and maybe the
[1:57:32] doctor says you're just as sick as you
[1:57:34] ever was
[1:57:35] maybe your family looks and says they're
[1:57:36] still just an old backslider or whatever
[1:57:38] but you keep that positive confession
[1:57:40] god can do it for me god can bring me
[1:57:42] through god can deliver me
[1:57:45] there was nothing in the house george
[1:57:48] says we just want to thank you
[1:57:50] we just want to thank you in advance
[1:57:52] lord how many like to thank him in
[1:57:54] advance

[1:57:59] about to pray over
[1:58:01] lord we'd like to thank you in advance
[1:58:03] for the testimonies
[1:58:04] that are going to come forth from these
[1:58:06] meetings

[1:58:09] for my backslidden family member
[1:58:11] that you're bringing back to calvary

[1:58:16] that job that you're working on
[1:58:18] providing for me i'd like to thank you
[1:58:20] lord for that bill that you're going to
[1:58:22] pay off for me
[1:58:23] lord i don't know how it's all going to
[1:58:25] work out lord i'd like to thank you to
[1:58:26] advance
[1:58:27] for that spouse that you've
[1:58:28] predestinated for me to have
[1:58:30] that i've been single and i've been
[1:58:32] searching and maybe i've been looking
[1:58:34] in all the wrong places but lord i'm
[1:58:35] coming to you this morning
[1:58:37] i'm in your house this morning i need
[1:58:39] you to lead me and guide me and i'd like
[1:58:41] to thank you in advance
[1:58:43] for my husband for my wife for my
[1:58:45] children
[1:58:46] you go back and read the lineage of noah
[1:58:48] and you'll find out that
[1:58:49] noah was 600 years old when he
[1:58:52] began to build or when the flood came
[1:58:56] and god calls him at uh and at 500 years
[1:59:00] he has his first son if you look at the
[1:59:02] lineage so god tells him 120 years
[1:59:05] before the reign
[1:59:06] to build an ark for your children and
[1:59:09] their wives
[1:59:10] and your wife and you go back and look
[1:59:12] at the lineage and he didn't have any
[1:59:13] children yet
[1:59:14] brother didn't have any
[1:59:16] daughter-in-law's yet
[1:59:18] 20 years later he has his first son said
[1:59:21] oh my
[1:59:22] been a long time coming i can use some
[1:59:23] help on this ark we need to grow you up
[1:59:25] fast
[1:59:26] and then little baby brother comes along
[1:59:28] and another baby brother and they grow
[1:59:30] up
[1:59:30] and they begin to work on the ark and
[1:59:32] 120 years later
[1:59:33] but he worked 20 years before he ever
[1:59:35] had a child
[1:59:37] and god said build an ark for the saving
[1:59:39] of your your wife
[1:59:41] and your sons and your daughter-in-laws
[1:59:44] he said
[1:59:44] sons plural i ain't got son one
[1:59:47] but he starts building and he said i
[1:59:50] want to thank you in advance
[1:59:51] for this preparation i want to thank you
[1:59:54] in advance
[1:59:55] for this place where my family can go
[1:59:57] for safety
[1:59:58] i want to thank you in advance for my
[2:00:00] sons i want to thank you in advance for
[2:00:02] my daughter-in-laws
[2:00:04] i want to thank you in advance for what
[2:00:05] you're going to do for my children
[2:00:12] they gave thanks for breakfast and all
[2:00:15] the children sitting at the table
[2:00:17] even though there was nothing to eat in
[2:00:19] the house as they finished praying the
[2:00:22] baker knocked on the door
[2:00:23] with sufficient fresh bread to feed
[2:00:26] everyone
[2:00:27] and the milkman gave them plenty of
[2:00:28] fresh milk because his
[2:00:30] cart broke down in front of the
[2:00:32] orphanage can you imagine that
[2:00:34] that milkman said you got to be kidding
[2:00:37] me
[2:00:38] you got to be kidding me this is the
[2:00:40] worst day ever
[2:00:41] i just filled up this whole card i got
[2:00:42] deliveries to make i'm gonna oh sister
[2:00:44] jones down the road she's gonna be so
[2:00:46] mad
[2:00:46] if i'm five minutes late with her milk
[2:00:48] she's ready to just ring me out and
[2:00:50] cancel her subscription
[2:00:51] and here this whole thing breaks down
[2:00:53] i'll never be able to get this milk from
[2:00:54] point a to point b
[2:00:55] before it ruins but you know george's
[2:00:58] place is right here the old orphanage
[2:00:59] maybe they could use a little milk
[2:01:00] knocks on the door said george
[2:01:02] i know you've probably got plenty of
[2:01:03] things but i had a little milk accident
[2:01:05] out here he said thank you jesus
[2:01:08] thank you jesus he said my heart broke
[2:01:12] down and you're thanking jesus he said i
[2:01:14] was thanking jesus
[2:01:15] for your broke down cart before it got
[2:01:17] here i was thanking jesus for the milk
[2:01:20] before you put it in the bottle i was
[2:01:22] thanking god for the bread before the
[2:01:24] baker made it
[2:01:26] amen thank him in advance take the
[2:01:29] saddle off your mule this morning don't
[2:01:31] let the devil hold you back and say
[2:01:32] what about this and what about that
[2:01:38] god's way that's been made for us 1950
[2:01:40] 52 after through the services of this
[2:01:42] week
[2:01:42] trying to show people that there's no
[2:01:44] need of being scared
[2:01:46] the worst thing the devil can put upon
[2:01:48] you is fear
[2:01:49] if you even had a cancer and didn't fear
[2:01:51] and believed god
[2:01:52] would heal you you wouldn't be in too
[2:01:54] bad of shape
[2:01:56] god take care of that if you were sick
[2:01:57] whatever it is if you didn't fear
[2:01:59] so fear is one of the worst things that
[2:02:01] satan can place upon a person
[2:02:04] amen don't fear this morning you go back
[2:02:07] and you look in the scripture
[2:02:08] over and over and over fear not fear not
[2:02:10] fear not
[2:02:11] and the first thing we do a little
[2:02:12] trouble comes in and oh my god brother
[2:02:14] jack what are we going to do
[2:02:15] what are we going to do we're going to
[2:02:16] thank god in advance that's what we're
[2:02:18] going to do
[2:02:19] we're going to thank god in advance for
[2:02:20] bringing us through as a church
[2:02:22] as a family as individuals we're going
[2:02:24] to thank him in advance
[2:02:26] let me read you one more quote here
[2:02:27] before we go into the prayer line
[2:02:30] confirmation and evidence 1962. he said
[2:02:33] if he would appear here on the platform
[2:02:34] tonight
[2:02:35] and would say to me go to the
[2:02:36] presidential graveyard tomorrow morning
[2:02:39] at 10 o'clock
[2:02:40] call george washington from the dead i'd
[2:02:42] invite the whole world to come and watch
[2:02:44] it be done
[2:02:46] yes sir for i have faith in what has
[2:02:48] been told me
[2:02:49] because he never has he failed to
[2:02:51] confirm whatever he said to me
[2:02:53] so i have faith in it believing it that
[2:02:56] it's the truth
[2:02:57] because it's a built up affair amen this
[2:03:00] isn't something that
[2:03:01] that was just a made-up affair it was a
[2:03:03] built-up affair
[2:03:04] he had seen god in action before we've
[2:03:06] seen god heal cancer before
[2:03:08] so we can take him in his word it's a
[2:03:10] built-up affair he's built up our faith
[2:03:12] by experience
[2:03:13] that we've seen him in action before i
[2:03:15] believe he can restore
[2:03:16] families because i've seen him do it
[2:03:18] before i believe he can heal the sick
[2:03:21] because i've seen him do it before
[2:03:22] i believe he can provide for the house
[2:03:24] payment and the grocery bill because
[2:03:26] i've seen him do it before it's a
[2:03:27] built-up affair
[2:03:29] amen this isn't a worked up affair it's
[2:03:31] a built-up affair
[2:03:33] i don't have to fear i've seen him bring
[2:03:34] me through before he can bring me
[2:03:36] through again
[2:03:37] i've seen him heal me the last time
[2:03:38] brother jack he can heal me this time
[2:03:41] i've seen him bring prodigals back home
[2:03:43] before he can bring some more prodigals
[2:03:45] back home
[2:03:47] it's a built up affair down through life
[2:03:50] since a little boy all the visions of
[2:03:52] thousands not one of them has never
[2:03:54] failed
[2:03:55] therefore it's the truth that gives me
[2:03:57] faith
[2:03:58] i got faith in what he says amen
[2:04:02] if god told him to go up and raise
[2:04:04] president washington from the grave he
[2:04:06] said i'd invite
[2:04:07] the whole world can we have that kind of
[2:04:10] faith
[2:04:11] can we take the saddle off our mule in
[2:04:13] that way that if god tells you
[2:04:15] whether the symptoms have changed
[2:04:17] whether the circumstances has changed
[2:04:19] whether any sign physically is changed
[2:04:21] or not we can take god's word and say
[2:04:24] i'm healed i'm delivered i'm victorious
[2:04:27] i i have freedom over those addictions
[2:04:29] that i used to have
[2:04:31] i have freedom over those temptations
[2:04:33] that used to drag me down
[2:04:34] into things that i shouldn't do i'm
[2:04:36] delivered
[2:04:37] you say well i don't see any change yet
[2:04:39] but take him at his word one time
[2:04:41] take him at his word one time put it

[3:24:16] lord may they break this cycle of hurt
[3:24:18] and pain that
[3:24:19] has been caused to them in their
[3:24:21] childhood
[3:24:22] lord may the love of god just be
[3:24:24] expressed to them father
[3:24:27] lord may love be projected to them in a
[3:24:29] way that divine grace would manifest
[3:24:31] itself in their life
[3:24:33] they could recognize through whatever
[3:24:34] hurt or pain that they faced
