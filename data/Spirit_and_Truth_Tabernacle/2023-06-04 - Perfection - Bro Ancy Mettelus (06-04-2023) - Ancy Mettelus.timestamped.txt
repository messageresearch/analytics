[31:33] get involved in that uh brother Branham
[31:35] told us that there is a a thirst that
[31:39] people have and uh the the thing of it
[31:42] is is that they'll never get that first
[31:44] satisfied until they come in contact
[31:46] with the person of the Lord Jesus amen
[31:50] when we talk about Jesus not some
[31:52] fiction story but he's a real person

[55:48] and behold one came and said unto him
[55:51] good Master what good thing shall I do
[55:54] that I may and that I may have eternal
[55:57] life
[55:58] and he said unto him why call us doubt
[56:01] me good there is none good but one that
[56:04] is God but if thou will enter into life
[56:08] keep the Commandments he said unto him
[56:12] which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
[56:15] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[56:17] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[56:20] false witness honor thy father and thy
[56:23] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[56:25] as thyself the young man said unto him
[56:29] all these things have I kept from my
[56:31] youth up
[56:33] what lack I yet Jesus said unto him if
[56:37] thou were if thou will be perfect
[56:40] go and sell that thou has and give to
[56:44] the poor thou shall have treasure in
[56:47] heaven and come and follow me

[56:53] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[56:55] possessions amen

[57:10] but we'll only read one verse
[57:14] from verse 17 down you will see it as
[57:17] the same story
[57:20] but we'll read verse 21.
[57:24] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[57:28] said unto him one thing thou lack is go
[57:32] thy way so whatsoever thou has and give
[57:35] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[57:37] in heaven and come and take up the cross
[57:40] and follow me amen amen amen let us bow

[1:01:53] God doesn't call you to just be good
[1:01:57] he requires you to be perfect
[1:01:59] he says be ye therefore perfect
[1:02:03] your heavenly father is perfect
[1:02:06] it's not something you're gonna make up
[1:02:10] says
[1:02:13] being the bride of Christ
[1:02:16] all things
[1:02:19] the price of our Earthly Journey has
[1:02:22] already been paid a full in full
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:35] that is what is required
[1:02:38] that's why
[1:02:42] for you to be perfect
[1:02:44] he's not giving you a burden to carry
[1:02:47] he's not telling you to do something
[1:02:49] that's impossible
[1:02:51] he will provide you the way
[1:03:13] in this message
[1:03:21] and obey
[1:03:25] this man was a good man
[1:03:31] he's obeyed all the Commandments
[1:03:34] but he was missing something
[1:03:37] it was a new hour
[1:03:41] that's why
[1:03:49] and the message for your day
[1:03:54] recognize the day
[1:03:56] and the message for that day
[1:03:59] he was a good man
[1:04:02] very religious
[1:04:04] surely he never missed the service
[1:04:11] these I followed since my birth
[1:04:15] but he was still missing something
[1:04:19] let me tell you this morning
[1:04:22] there is no eternal life in a church
[1:04:25] there is eternal life in Jesus Christ
[1:05:00] but there's only carrier
[1:05:12] it's not that she will receive eternal
[1:05:14] life
[1:05:15] he says if one shall hear my voice
[1:05:22] not that the person shall have eternal
[1:05:24] life that person has eternal life let me
[1:05:28] tell you this morning
[1:05:30] there is a group right now that has
[1:05:33] eternal life
[1:05:34] called the bride of Christ
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:46] there are many here who are saved and
[1:05:48] have eternal life
[1:05:59] it says Jesus looked upon him and loved
[1:06:03] him
[1:06:04] Jesus wanted to save him
[1:06:07] Jesus loved him that's what the word
[1:06:10] says
[1:06:13] the world will perish
[1:06:16] in its conditions
[1:06:19] not from lack of God's love
[1:06:31] is here
[1:06:34] it's clear
[1:06:36] Jesus came he went to the Cross he paid
[1:06:41] the price
[1:06:42] the one thing you do
[1:06:44] it's very simple say acceptance accept
[1:06:47] that
[1:06:48] accept it that's all he says
[1:06:52] the world will perish
[1:06:56] he says the love of many shall wax cold
[1:07:01] that's what we find that's the prophecy
[1:07:04] for our age
[1:07:06] the world is perishing
[1:07:08] not because God doesn't love them
[1:07:11] the same way
[1:07:16] bodies what
[1:07:27] [Applause]
[1:07:55] he says will I find a building no
[1:07:58] is that what he says sister
[1:08:56] love must be reciprocated
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:00] for it to withhold
[1:09:13] the word says Jesus looked upon him and
[1:09:16] loved him
[1:09:18] when you love someone you have to tell
[1:09:20] them the truth that is why every true
[1:09:24] Minister must speak the truth
[1:09:27] to the people that they lead Bhaskar
[1:09:30] because
[1:09:31] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:09:35] shall set you free right that means
[1:09:39] you must respond to God's love
[1:09:42] how much time do you spend with him
[1:09:45] how much time do you spend in prayer
[1:09:49] asked by the brand of questions
[1:09:52] how do I love the Lord more
[1:09:56] a simple answer he says read your Bible
[1:10:00] pray every day
[1:10:03] read your Bible pray every day
[1:10:06] if you read the word
[1:10:09] and you will fall in love more with the
[1:10:11] Lord
[1:10:16] a close connection with God
[1:10:19] it's a very simple answer
[1:10:23] read your Bible every day because the
[1:10:26] Bible says is God in the form of word
[1:10:31] that's what it is
[1:10:33] so
[1:10:35] let me know
[1:10:36] two thousand years ago Jesus projected
[1:10:38] his love
[1:10:40] again
[1:10:41] and no one cared for it wow
[1:10:46] the nominations of that day the
[1:10:50] religious leaders of that day you wish
[1:10:52] they rejected it your wish tell them
[1:10:55] more they rejected that love
[1:10:59] even those who walked with him
[1:11:03] Ministers of the message
[1:11:06] 70 of them
[1:11:10] they rejected him right
[1:11:15] 12th state
[1:11:21] because they understood
[1:11:24] he said if you don't eat my flesh drink
[1:11:28] my blood you will not have eternal life
[1:11:30] be
[1:11:33] it's not that he understood
[1:11:37] but there's one thing Peter had
[1:11:40] you had the revelation
[1:11:45] if I leave Jesus he will die
[1:11:50] he recognized that in Jesus
[1:11:54] is the carrier of eternal life
[1:12:00] there are things you don't understand in
[1:12:03] the message
[1:12:04] does that mean you leave no no ah let it
[1:12:08] up here go into prayer because
[1:12:12] you are beloved
[1:12:18] to the revelation
[1:12:22] Daniel didn't understand he went into
[1:12:26] prayer the angel came is
[1:12:29] he says I'm set to tell you that you are
[1:12:33] beloved
[1:12:35] Angela and the
[1:12:37] angels
[1:12:39] and gave them the understanding of the
[1:12:41] scripture so say attitude it is your
[1:12:45] attitude
[1:12:46] you don't understand something remember
[1:12:49] based on my experience in this message
[1:12:51] there are things I read
[1:12:54] say man
[1:12:56] that is tough to swallow
[1:13:06] the Holy Ghost is my witness
[1:13:10] God has always come down and revealed it
[1:13:14] to me the things that I didn't
[1:13:15] understand
[1:13:21] attributes of God manifested In the
[1:13:23] Flesh that's what we are we are part of
[1:13:27] the word so we can never deny the word
[1:13:30] the message the message said is God in
[1:13:34] the form of the word revealed for this
[1:13:38] hour we cannot deny it
[1:13:42] we will not deny it
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:46] is
[1:13:49] a lack of divine love we find this
[1:13:52] morning that's why
[1:13:54] you found
[1:13:56] in second Timothy 3.
[1:13:59] it speaks of the Prophecies of the end
[1:14:01] day right right
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:35] an appearance of godliness
[1:14:40] does it hide to smoke no no
[1:14:44] yes
[1:14:53] but
[1:14:58] they're in the world no no
[1:15:01] you can't do it that way make a choice
[1:15:05] between guys Saturn and the devil
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:17] make a choice to serve the Lord
[1:15:21] one foot out
[1:15:25] he says they'll love you Pleasures
[1:15:27] they'll be traitors they'll be Slanders
[1:15:31] okay yeah they'll be prideful and so on
[1:15:35] you're fine he says
[1:15:40] meaning it's churches of course the lack
[1:15:43] of
[1:15:45] from a lack of divine love
[1:15:48] that will get to said conditions
[1:15:51] there are things that he says
[1:15:55] denying the power thereof
[1:16:06] the message has two principal goals
[1:16:11] first of all
[1:16:14] get you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] second of all
[1:16:18] to make you the love divine incarnated
[1:16:25] it's only love that can make it to the
[1:16:27] other side that's why you must love God
[1:16:30] with all your heart with all your
[1:16:32] strengths with all your soul and serve
[1:16:35] them amen
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:52] we
[1:16:53] immediat
[1:16:55] Ely let me tell you
[1:16:58] it is impossible
[1:17:02] it is impossible
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:30] you can't live it the amen say Amen when
[1:17:33] you say Amen this is the truth
[1:17:45] you will be able to live it
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:51] if it's the truth
[1:17:56] but you're unable to live it don't be
[1:17:59] upset
[1:18:00] don't get angry with the preacher the
[1:18:02] amen just say Amen
[1:18:04] foreign
[1:18:27] amen amen
[1:18:31] it is impossible
[1:18:34] to reach perfection
[1:18:36] without Divine love
[1:18:41] that is
[1:18:44] perfect love words produces perfect
[1:18:47] faith and perfect faith is a limitless
[1:18:52] faith
[1:18:56] is a limitless Faith right
[1:19:08] and they shook the kingdom of hell
[1:19:13] later on
[1:19:14] Jesus spoke a word and they denied that
[1:19:18] word that's not perfect Faith
[1:19:21] you can cast out devils and not have
[1:19:24] perfect faith
[1:19:59] faith has levels
[1:20:04] faith has levels
[1:20:06] when Jesus said to Peter
[1:20:09] this is how many times you must forgive
[1:20:12] your brother
[1:20:13] when he trespasses again
[1:20:16] 70 times
[1:20:18] in just one day ah come on yeah work on
[1:20:21] that Peter recognized
[1:20:24] it needed more faith than he had
[1:20:33] it causes you to forgive your
[1:20:36] trespassers
[1:20:38] everyone
[1:20:40] no matter the level of offense what
[1:20:44] that means
[1:20:47] he needed a higher level of Faith
[1:20:52] speak in tongues
[1:20:54] Shake all the kingdom of hell
[1:20:57] but yet you still don't have perfect
[1:21:00] Faith
[1:21:01] perfect faith will forgive his brother
[1:21:05] forgive his sister
[1:21:08] leads a higher level of faith
[1:21:14] ah impossible it is impossible that
[1:21:18] without Divine love who
[1:21:21] reveal a perfect to reach perfection
[1:21:25] Perfection is Jesus Christ himself when
[1:21:29] you accept him
[1:21:32] once you are born again
[1:21:34] you are perfect
[1:21:37] but many times
[1:21:40] men have their own understanding of what
[1:21:43] Perfection is
[1:21:54] even with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:56] all right I'm gonna set this window with
[1:21:59] the Holy Ghost In You
[1:22:01] I've accepted with the Holy Ghost in you
[1:22:03] you will make mistakes
[1:22:06] and God will allow you to do so all of
[1:22:09] that you can always remember you're a
[1:22:11] man
[1:22:12] they will always remain in humility
[1:22:22] you are perfect
[1:22:28] perfect
[1:22:35] you're perfect
[1:22:38] Perfection is not how we understand it
[1:22:41] all right
[1:22:43] let's see what the prophet says
[1:22:49] a few quotes
[1:22:55] Israel and the church number two
[1:22:58] March 26 1953.
[1:23:03] God has argument paragraph 28.
[1:23:07] God has already glorified his church
[1:23:10] will be glorified
[1:23:12] God will glorify or has
[1:23:15] already already glorifies
[1:23:22] those who he justified
[1:23:25] he also glorified glorified in the
[1:23:28] church knowledge in Christ now Chris yes
[1:23:33] if you're justified in Christ
[1:23:36] you are glorified in Christ
[1:23:39] already
[1:23:41] as far as God is concerned
[1:23:46] Jesus said
[1:23:48] be ye therefore perfect yes
[1:23:51] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:23:55] how could you ever be perfect
[1:23:59] but in the sight of Christ
[1:24:03] of Christ
[1:24:05] alone
[1:24:12] look at things and they see the mistake
[1:24:14] mistakes
[1:24:16] God's goggles
[1:24:19] see how God sees
[1:24:21] so you stop condemning others and have
[1:24:25] patience with people
[1:24:27] [Applause]

[1:26:41] you can me even be preaching
[1:26:44] and you say something you didn't mean
[1:26:46] but Jesus

[1:27:19] when he said be ye therefore perfect
[1:27:22] even as your father
[1:27:25] is perfect
[1:27:28] How could a human being be perfect

[1:33:36] Jesus is the word
[1:33:41] we
[1:33:43] maybe so
[1:33:47] you'll see I want to paint a picture for
[1:33:50] you
[1:33:54] Luke said let's go to Luke chapter 7.
[1:33:58] Luke said
[1:34:09] Luke said Luke chapter seven
[1:34:16] let's go to verse 37.
[1:34:24] we're here this morning
[1:34:27] we are in this world
[1:34:33] no one has ever seen Jesus in the flesh
[1:34:37] look at you
[1:34:39] they should be able to see Jesus walking
[1:34:42] on this Earth
[1:34:46] they don't have time to read their Bible
[1:34:49] they don't read it
[1:34:51] you should be the Bible
[1:34:54] on this Earth
[1:34:57] so that means
[1:35:00] when they don't want Jesus they reject
[1:35:03] Jesus
[1:35:04] you should be elevating him even higher
[1:35:13] you should stand up for him
[1:35:19] this woman
[1:35:21] is a sinful woman
[1:35:24] Simon invited Jesus to his house
[1:35:30] the thing with Jesus if you invite him
[1:35:32] he'll come
[1:35:33] no matter the person
[1:35:37] but you invite him to
[1:35:41] elevate his name or
[1:35:46] you want him to come to your life to do
[1:35:49] what
[1:35:55] women for me
[1:35:58] I need the Lord Jesus every single day
[1:36:01] every hour every minute I need him
[1:36:07] even this breath that I'm taking in
[1:36:09] right now
[1:36:10] he's the one who allows me to do it
[1:36:13] that's why we need him
[1:36:16] you need him
[1:36:23] he lives the word through you
[1:36:26] that's what it is
[1:36:28] he says I will give you a new heart
[1:36:31] a new spirit
[1:36:34] what
[1:36:36] and I will take my spirit and put it in
[1:36:40] you in Rafael's
[1:36:42] and you shall keep my Commandments
[1:36:45] Jesus is the one who lives the word in
[1:36:47] you
[1:36:49] Jesus is the one who comes in you and
[1:36:51] lives you think you have the capacity to
[1:36:54] live the word
[1:37:00] no no
[1:37:03] Jesus chose you
[1:37:06] had you chosen him you would have
[1:37:10] abandoned him and the trial the tests
[1:37:14] don't you see there's times you even
[1:37:16] want to run
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:21] since he is the comforter
[1:37:25] see you he whispers in your ears your
[1:37:28] husband
[1:37:30] Whispering you sweet nothings and that
[1:37:33] gives you strength and you keep moving
[1:37:36] forward
[1:37:44] it comes to put you on the ground
[1:37:48] but Jesus tell him he's the one
[1:37:52] let me tell you what happened
[1:37:54] we'll get back to that verse let's go to
[1:37:57] first John
[1:38:08] first John chapter 5.
[1:38:11] this is my favorite
[1:38:13] 19 and 20.
[1:38:26] we know that we are of God because
[1:38:32] and that the world is under the power of
[1:38:34] the wicked one
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:38] the whole world is under the power of
[1:38:40] wickedness
[1:38:45] you think you would be spared
[1:38:59] you're a liar
[1:39:02] from the crib
[1:39:05] the child is here you bringing them up
[1:39:08] they've never seen or their mother lied
[1:39:13] they do something in the house
[1:39:16] who moved this here not me not me
[1:39:21] I don't know I don't know
[1:39:24] shuck Papa every father
[1:39:26] has children in the house they have
[1:39:29] another child called I don't know
[1:39:32] everything I don't know did it
[1:39:35] from the crib that's right but the brand
[1:39:38] name says
[1:39:39] you're not responsible for being a
[1:39:42] sinner
[1:39:43] you're born that way you're born a
[1:39:46] sinner man
[1:39:47] you are responsible
[1:39:50] because you're rejected
[1:39:52] the Salvation you rejected Christ
[1:39:57] the world is condemned pressure not
[1:40:00] because they are sinners because they
[1:40:03] sing
[1:40:04] because they're born that way
[1:40:06] but they're responsible
[1:40:11] because they reject his love
[1:40:13] foreign
[1:40:37] [Laughter]
[1:40:53] if God
[1:40:55] Mateo if it's not for him you would be
[1:40:58] out there
[1:41:00] drinking like them
[1:41:02] smoking weed just like them doing
[1:41:04] whatever even if you were there this
[1:41:08] morning
[1:41:10] glory that he took you out
[1:41:14] what you see
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:20] intelligence had given us an
[1:41:23] understanding that we may know him that
[1:41:26] is true
[1:41:37] this is
[1:41:39] what you see me this is
[1:41:45] eternal life
[1:41:46] that's why no
[1:41:49] eternal life outside of Christ
[1:41:55] me follow me sell all that you have
[1:41:58] follow me
[1:42:00] there is no eternal life outside of
[1:42:03] Christ
[1:42:04] that is the true God the true God and
[1:42:08] eternal life
[1:42:10] he gave you understanding to choose him
[1:42:14] he
[1:42:18] chose you
[1:42:20] the success that's why he also holds you
[1:42:24] um when you fall he gets you up
[1:42:28] what
[1:42:29] let's go back
[1:42:35] it looks at Luke 7. my God Rick said
[1:42:44] was he
[1:42:45] Luke said
[1:42:49] Luke 7 37.
[1:42:53] you know the story
[1:42:56] but there's something I want to bring
[1:42:58] your attention to
[1:43:02] your family
[1:43:06] they're very precise a sinful woman
[1:43:10] what you see
[1:43:13] Simon invited Jesus
[1:43:16] to humiliate him
[1:43:20] God is never defeated
[1:43:24] he is the provider
[1:43:27] where'd this woman come from
[1:43:29] even the men don't know how she got in
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:37] they ask themselves
[1:43:41] how did she get in
[1:43:45] yeah
[1:43:46] they invited Jesus to humiliate him
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:55] someone must be there to stand for him
[1:43:58] this woman
[1:44:02] how did she get inside
[1:44:07] you know God blinds people
[1:44:11] this woman
[1:44:13] no one knows how she got it
[1:44:16] at Jesus feet
[1:44:19] her tears washing his feet and use her
[1:44:24] hair to wipe it
[1:44:26] what
[1:44:29] is
[1:44:32] based on the customer when you invite
[1:44:35] someone
[1:44:36] stand at the door
[1:44:39] and then you wash their feet from
[1:44:41] walking
[1:44:42] you take care of the person you welcome
[1:44:45] them and all these things Jesus did not
[1:44:49] receive such treatment
[1:44:51] he didn't receive that
[1:44:54] but since he is never defeated
[1:44:57] there's an elect somewhere
[1:45:00] it's not because you're in sin
[1:45:04] it's not because you're in sin you're a
[1:45:06] sinner
[1:45:07] what seed do you have
[1:45:10] that's what's important
[1:45:13] I've never condemned anyone for what
[1:45:15] they do no no
[1:45:18] what bothers me is when you fall when
[1:45:23] they bring you the word
[1:45:25] what is your reaction to the word
[1:45:29] that's the problem it's about so far not
[1:45:31] because of what you've done
[1:45:42] on your head
[1:45:44] you have no control
[1:45:47] the bird builds a nest
[1:45:49] that you have control over you can stop
[1:45:53] the bird from building a nest it's not
[1:45:54] cracker that's why
[1:45:56] I believe every sinner
[1:45:59] by grace
[1:46:01] who is a predestinated elect yeah they
[1:46:05] will overcome the world and they will
[1:46:07] overcome sin
[1:46:08] because they'll have that perfect face
[1:46:13] that overcomes this world
[1:46:15] our faith
[1:46:18] they will have their Victory
[1:46:21] every single elect
[1:46:23] will have their victory
[1:46:50] but the world's already conquered
[1:46:52] defeated
[1:46:53] knew some
[1:46:56] we are in our Victory
[1:46:59] our role as an elect
[1:47:03] as it was in the Old Testament
[1:47:06] when Abraham and so forth when they burn
[1:47:11] the sacrifice they have a staff in their
[1:47:14] hands
[1:47:15] so that animals don't come and eat their
[1:47:18] sacrifice you have the word in your
[1:47:21] hands don't let the devil yes I can come
[1:47:24] and eat your sacrifice
[1:47:28] their hands
[1:47:31] as they're offering their sacrifice
[1:47:35] they hit the bird
[1:48:03] don't let the devil whisper in your ears
[1:48:06] and tell you that you're not one of them
[1:48:09] it's because you're saved
[1:48:14] it's because you are
[1:48:19] awesome
[1:48:20] why is he telling the Sinners out there
[1:48:22] they're not saved some men but he comes
[1:48:25] to you who is accepted the message
[1:48:32] the devil is a liar
[1:48:36] s
[1:48:39] he's telling you you won't be raptured
[1:48:42] because he knows you will be
[1:48:46] he knows you'll be
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:51] always think of it this way
[1:48:55] you know the devil North and South
[1:49:00] they'll never meet
[1:49:02] if God says something
[1:49:04] the devil will always tell you the
[1:49:07] contrary the word doesn't say you're
[1:49:09] saved
[1:49:11] the word says you're safe
[1:49:13] do you accept Jesus as your savior we
[1:49:16] yes
[1:49:17] so you're saved
[1:49:24] don't tell me that
[1:49:28] amen that's right brother
[1:49:34] they call they brought Jesus so that
[1:49:36] they can humiliate him
[1:49:39] Jesus use this
[1:49:42] if someone owes 500.
[1:49:46] someone owes 50.
[1:49:50] and you canceled out both of their debts
[1:49:53] who will appreciate you more who will
[1:49:55] love you more black person who owed more
[1:50:00] Jesus here is rebuking Simon
[1:50:05] of what he ought to have done that he
[1:50:07] didn't do
[1:50:09] let's look at what he says
[1:50:12] let's go to verse 45.
[1:50:16] press 45
[1:50:20] he says
[1:50:24] thou gave us me no kiss
[1:50:29] es
[1:50:32] since the time I came in has not ceased
[1:50:35] to kiss my feet
[1:50:36] foreign
[1:50:54] love will produce
[1:51:00] persons which are many are forgiven
[1:51:05] for what
[1:51:08] she loved
[1:51:11] what
[1:51:14] um
[1:51:23] she loved much
[1:51:30] but to him whom little is Forgiven
[1:51:34] the Same Love is little
[1:51:37] he said to the woman thy sins are
[1:51:40] forgiven
[1:51:42] so you see Divine love you see what that
[1:51:46] produced It produced salvation by faith
[1:51:50] what
[1:51:56] verse 49.
[1:51:59] and they sat at me
[1:52:03] to say within themselves
[1:52:07] within themselves not with their mouth
[1:52:10] in their hearts
[1:52:12] who is this That Forgives sin also
[1:52:16] what level
[1:52:17] when President says faith is by
[1:52:20] Revelation
[1:52:21] this woman knew who Jesus was
[1:52:24] Simon did not know who Jesus was
[1:52:28] he gave us the understanding a
[1:52:31] revelation
[1:52:33] it's just by Revelation
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:39] and he said unto the woman
[1:52:41] thy faith it has saved thee
[1:52:46] you see where she receive her salvation
[1:52:52] first of all she loved him much of
[1:52:55] course because of the love
[1:52:57] her faith so will saved her
[1:53:01] so perfect love
[1:53:04] perfect faith
[1:53:06] because she loved the Lord this morning
[1:53:10] if you love God with all your heart
[1:53:13] you cannot walk out the same way you
[1:53:15] walked in
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:35] God doesn't always tell you everything
[1:53:39] he just asked you to obey
[1:53:41] now behind that obedience there are many
[1:53:45] other things to come
[1:53:58] what about us who have already abandoned
[1:54:00] everything in the same chapter
[1:54:04] this man didn't know
[1:54:07] social business this was the one
[1:54:10] business that has never had a deficit
[1:54:14] brother Brandon says it
[1:54:16] if you want to invest in something
[1:54:19] invest in Jesus
[1:54:22] because
[1:54:24] Jesus his business has never had a
[1:54:26] deficit in fact he says
[1:54:30] for those who abandoned
[1:54:34] he didn't say after the Rapture in
[1:54:37] heaven
[1:54:39] he says I'll give you sisters I'll give
[1:54:41] you Brothers I'll give you mothers
[1:54:44] I'll give you houses
[1:54:47] he said I'll give you all things
[1:54:51] you will have to sit
[1:54:59] the tribes of Israel
[1:55:04] this morning invest in Jesus
[1:55:08] amen
[1:55:10] preparedness from the day of Pentecost
[1:55:12] till this day it has never fallen sorry
[1:55:16] bro
[1:55:18] Glory good system
[1:55:21] every system in this world you do that
[1:55:23] you know they've all fall into their
[1:55:25] knees
[1:55:26] capitalism has fallen communist
[1:55:28] communism has fallen oh
[1:55:34] yeah
[1:55:35] now they're coming up with the New World
[1:55:37] Order
[1:55:38] because when nothing's worked
[1:55:42] the one hopeful for this world the one
[1:55:47] medication
[1:55:48] has always been Jesus and it will
[1:55:52] continue to always be Jesus
[1:55:54] yeah
[1:55:57] as always been Jesus and it will always
[1:56:01] still remain Jesus
[1:56:04] everything else
[1:56:07] every system shall pass this is
[1:56:11] a stone that was thrown
[1:56:14] without any hand
[1:56:18] struck the statue
[1:56:21] the Statue turned to dust
[1:56:34] that's right
[1:56:37] your only hope is Jesus Christ that's
[1:56:41] what we offer you to finish
[1:56:50] okay five okay
[1:56:54] hey
[1:56:57] expected
[1:57:00] you perfect let's look at what God is
[1:57:02] expecting from someone who is perfect
[1:57:06] John 5 because what does God expect from
[1:57:10] someone whose purpose
[1:57:12] and what do you as a Christian no expect
[1:57:15] do what do we also expect from you
[1:57:18] someone who is perfect someone who's
[1:57:21] born again
[1:57:22] since God requires Perfection
[1:57:25] let's look at what he's expecting for
[1:57:28] that perfection
[1:57:30] John 5 verse 20.
[1:57:36] thank you
[1:57:38] [Laughter]
[1:57:45] John five sorry Matthew 6 Matthew 5.
[1:57:50] that's what I was saying yeah
[1:57:54] Jesus was standing here
[1:57:56] [Laughter]
[1:57:59] that's not what I meant to say
[1:58:06] is he
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:14] for I say unto you
[1:58:16] that accept your righteousness shall
[1:58:19] exceed the righteousness of the scribes
[1:58:24] in no case enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:58:30] you've received more
[1:58:33] so what you've received
[1:58:36] Baptists don't have it Catholics don't
[1:58:39] have it
[1:58:40] you've received more
[1:58:43] Japanese so God also requires more
[1:59:04] you've received more
[1:59:08] verse 23.
[1:59:11] it is
[1:59:21] that thy brother has ought against thee
[1:59:27] thy gift God he feeds of our worship
[1:59:33] you see this
[1:59:36] God is giving more oh he's important to
[1:59:40] our horizontal relationship
[1:59:43] then to his vertical relationship you
[1:59:46] come to worship God you come to offer
[1:59:48] your offering me but leave liquor he
[1:59:52] would rather fall back in me you not
[1:59:54] have enemies with your brother to be
[1:59:56] enemies with your brother foreign
[2:00:18] but you did nothing about it
[2:00:21] you did nothing about it
[2:00:23] no go
[2:00:28] and then you can come back and worship
[2:00:33] that is how someone who is perfect
[2:00:35] behaves
[2:00:40] verse 25.
[2:00:44] I agree with thy advert adversary
[2:00:47] quickly you know who's the adversary it
[2:00:52] was a friend
[2:00:54] someone who is now an adversary
[2:00:59] if I've never known brother Jackie come
[2:01:02] on how can he be my adversary
[2:01:05] he doesn't know me I don't know him if
[2:01:08] we knew each other
[2:01:10] we were close
[2:01:13] now he becomes my adversary
[2:01:16] how did the devil become God's adversary
[2:01:21] [Applause]
[2:01:24] how did the devil become God's adversary
[2:01:28] he was close to him
[2:01:30] [Applause]
[2:01:34] an adversary
[2:01:36] is someone who is possessed
[2:01:44] you can tame them
[2:01:50] let me say it again
[2:01:54] was possessed
[2:01:58] such a possibly someone who is possessed
[2:02:03] it could be a friend
[2:02:05] you used to talk you used to eat
[2:02:07] together now your adversaries
[2:02:12] it could be husband and wife
[2:02:15] from sweet your sweetheart from your
[2:02:18] sweetheart to an adversary
[2:02:21] how did that happen and you say you're
[2:02:24] perfect
[2:02:26] foreign
[2:02:40] quickly
[2:02:48] that's what he says
[2:02:51] meaning sit with that adversary
[2:02:58] put them even
[2:03:02] someone who is perfect
[2:03:05] and they go seek out that reconciliation
[2:03:10] they don't wait for someone to bring the
[2:03:12] reconciliation to him they move
[2:03:14] themselves
[2:03:16] they do Festival he says do it quickly
[2:03:21] while thou are in the way with him
[2:03:25] less at any time
[2:03:28] remember there's someone who's possessed
[2:03:36] with them and fix things
[2:03:40] the adversary will deliver you to the
[2:03:42] judge
[2:03:45] and the judge will deliver you to the to
[2:03:48] the officer
[2:03:49] and thou shall be cast in prison in
[2:03:52] other words
[2:03:53] someone who is perfect
[2:03:57] they can avoid scandals
[2:04:03] because if it gets even judged it gets
[2:04:06] to the Core
[2:04:06] at that point it's already a
[2:04:09] scandalia this could be husband and wife
[2:04:13] quickly
[2:04:20] by the brand name used an example
[2:04:22] a couple that wanted us
[2:04:25] they got lawyers
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:30] and they're about to split up all their
[2:04:33] wealth and this one takes this one this
[2:04:35] one
[2:04:36] and then there was a little a little
[2:04:38] shoe shoebox
[2:04:42] they're both way to grab it
[2:04:44] this one wanted this one when they
[2:04:47] opened it they found
[2:04:51] there was little clothing from a baby
[2:04:53] that they had that passed away
[2:04:55] and then they got back to themselves and
[2:04:59] they didn't move forward with that
[2:05:00] divorce
[2:05:02] what God allowed to reconcile them
[2:05:05] they remember that baby that they had in
[2:05:09] common
[2:05:16] he says
[2:05:31] you heard that it was set by them of all
[2:05:34] time thou shall not come in adultery but
[2:05:36] I say unto you
[2:05:38] whosoever looketh up on a woman and to
[2:05:41] lust after her
[2:05:43] committed adultery with her already in
[2:05:45] his heart
[2:05:47] if uh you read the message I don't have
[2:05:49] time to read the quote
[2:05:52] but the random takes this
[2:05:55] is
[2:06:01] wearing the tight clothing
[2:06:05] that then caused mental lust after them
[2:06:08] so someone who is perfect
[2:06:16] today be a stumbling block for others
[2:06:21] someone who is perfect will not behave
[2:06:24] in such a man
[2:06:27] be ye therefore perfect
[2:06:30] as thou heavenly father is perfect
[2:06:33] and then he's now going down
[2:06:37] so when a sister accepts this message
[2:06:44] time there was a uh type of clothing
[2:06:46] they used to wear it was called Scandal
[2:06:51] skirts is
[2:06:54] you can't be perfect and you are causing
[2:06:57] skin
[2:06:58] regardless of the Scandal
[2:07:01] [Applause]
[2:07:20] you're both guilty
[2:07:24] both guilty
[2:07:28] 37
[2:07:30] give me some time
[2:07:34] I'm closing it says
[2:07:38] let your communication be yay yay
[2:07:45] there's something you must never be
[2:07:47] guilty of someone who is perfect
[2:07:50] believes all the truth that is in Jesus
[2:07:52] Christ and they also we do it must speak
[2:07:57] all truth
[2:07:58] meaning
[2:08:03] if you fall
[2:08:06] you say something that isn't true fix it
[2:08:09] go ahead and fix it
[2:08:11] the reason being
[2:08:14] you can never bury the truth

[2:14:33] because this is a place of Correction
[2:14:36] uh we're coming to the house of the Lord
[2:14:37] and we hear God speak to us in his
[2:14:40] tender voice it is up to us to do
[2:14:43] something about
[2:14:45] uh what God is spoken to us
[2:14:48] and um you know I I just I pray I just
[2:14:52] absolutely pray that that we would be
[2:14:55] responsive to the word of God don't just
[2:14:58] let this go in one ear and out the other
[2:15:00] as if God wasn't talking to you
[2:15:03] amen he's a very gentle God he's not
[2:15:05] going to force himself on us but he does
[2:15:07] want us to believe and obey
