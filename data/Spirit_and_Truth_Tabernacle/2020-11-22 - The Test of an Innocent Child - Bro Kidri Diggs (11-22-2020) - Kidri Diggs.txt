share your testimony amen just tell everybody what happened to you on last night amen just grab that microphone right there praise the lord god bless you so um yesterday what happened was when we were coming in the church my stomach just like started hurting but i know my stomach wouldn't just start hurting that was the devil just trying to to to like get me distracted so what happened was um i i told bob my um i told poppy and um we went in the bathroom and prayed about it and he was telling me all the promises that god um uh was telling us in the bible so and then right when i sat down in my chair again my stomach stopped hurting because that was that was the devil just trying to to distract me to not get god's word but when you have a service like that we're in war god bless you praise the lord [Applause] amen god is good amen they were gonna be in trouble what is it there's a generation rising you put the devil under the feet praise god god bless you brother joseph appreciate you amen on to on this morning uh just a couple things i want to make mention of for you you all pray for uh sister erica she's not feeling uh her best a man and um you know i guess must be some type of uh coal flu thing kind of going around and a man and you know and um she just just just out of st all of a sudden just wham just to need some rest so uh she i told her to stay on the end and get a rest today but just just being prayerful and man one thing we don't claim is covet we don't claim it at all we we know coles and flu's they you know they happen all the time i cost some time and nose run a little bit but it ain't covered amen i ain't claiming that at all so but just keep her in prayer amen and um the lord would just touch her in her body also had a chance just to talk with sister dixon and um you know she said she missed y'all so much she said she want the sisters to know she ain't backslid you know but uh but uh just just keep in prayer i know that there's a procedure she was telling me that she's going to be undergoing sometime in the near future and just wants us to keep her in prayer that god will just continue to just watch over her and keep her a man throughout this time so you get an opportunity to give her a call i'm sure she'd love to hear uh your voice a precious precious sister dixon she was going back looking at the uh service that we had a couple weeks ago and how the lord just moved in here and she just began to think on how god used her to interpret tongues before you know i'm telling god things get contagious right you start going back into them man god did this for me god and if he did it before he can do it again praise the lord right so uh so i'll tell you just i was enjoying just the conversation there with her and amen and you know we we just um fellowshipping around the things of the lord uh so just uh please keep her in prayer i also want to thank you all for uh your contributions towards the turkeys we were able to purchase 56 turkeys and praise the lord [Music] all right um we bought 56 and we were able to at the pantry give out 47 uh on that day that we had the pantry on on on on thursday and then uh the extra turkeys we just kind of came here um uh in the in the plaza and just as different people was passing by they got a blessing they got a blessing so uh i want to thank you amen for just responding to that request and and i believe many families were blessed i remember uh hearing a testimony of a gentleman that was coming through the line to get um you know just his you know whatever we give out that day and uh he was just joking because we you know um they say y'all gonna give out turkeys and the sisters say yes you say i'm just i was just kidding y'all serious yes no i was just kidding yes you're gonna get a turkey today and when he got that turkey he was like i can't believe this but uh the lord knows what he's doing and and uh i mean i tell you you all uh represent very well and um you know whatever way we can just be a blessing to the community you all have even been seeing um there's been somebody visiting us that actually has been a part of this process at the pantry right and they've been coming to church and we thank god for that and there's another gentleman and his wife come and say we're coming to your church y'all welcome to come anytime so we are expecting that uh somebody gonna come in and all our hope is is that if there is a seed a spiritual seed if the seed is just struck through the word of god then we've done what we need to do praise god so uh we we thank god for all things and if it takes just a food ministry to get them y'all know jesus had a pantry ministry y'all know he did he fed 5 000. and he turned around and fed four thousand now some of it didn't keep them all but praise god some of them did get get get stayed you know but we thank god for the ones that will stay and and we we we appreciate that i also wanted to just make mention we are planning on doing like a christmas worship uh service on uh it's gonna be on a wednesday night uh the 23rd of uh of december and um just acts that you if you would desire what we're looking to do is just kind of put together a little uh choir and uh i'd love for a lot of our our young young uh younger people to be involved if possible a man give them something to get involved in and you know and sister shonda

with you as far as we'll start letting you know when we're going to do rehearsals and all these other things so please make sure you give her your name if you desire to be a part of it amen we like for the kids but if there's some parents that want to be a part of it too you're welcome amen you're welcome so but we just want to do something for our lord amen here um also i got word this morning that a great general of the cross went home to be with the lord amen our precious brother tommy dillard crossed over this morning and um we thank god for this man of god we thank god many of our lives have been uh changed by his ministry and uh you know just a a real warrior and that man could quote the bible like nobody's business and uh you know when he preached the gospel he was younger i mean y'all some of y'all that caught him in the younger days lord you got to fire ball but uh he was he was something else you know and um as he got older he got a little slower and wasn't able to preach as much but um brother dillard one time um you know when we first got started out in ministry he would come here to florida him and sister mary quite often and and brother dillard um i remember one one one one day he and he was suffering with his nosebleeds so he would have to just sit in the office while y'all praise him he just sit the office and have to keep his head back so the blood wouldn't run out of his nose and and knowing that he got to come up here and preach with this infirmity and he stunned up and he preaching and nobody know that he'd gone through all of this right sometimes you just don't know what a minister's going through when they when they're standing before you but you know he was uh he was he was just in the office and one time i happened to go in you know just to get something out of office and you know he was uh you know i didn't want to interrupt him because maybe he'd be praying but no brother dylan was laying back trying to keep that blood you know from from flowing out like my servant of god i i i was feeling so sorry that he's like no no it's okay brother it's fine and it gave me some advice you know on that day that i i'll never forget it says brother jack he said if you're ever at home and it's late at night and you're studying and you know you're just trying to get the word together for the people so then the devil start fighting you with sleep you say brother let him win let him win and go to sleep brother gotta give you something don't worry about it i say brother i sure appreciate that i just stopped fighting and struggling like that and i feel that sleep coming i'm going on to go to sleep because that's another devil trying to jump on me right get my body broke down right so go to sleep go to sleep god don't take care of it you know so he just you know just i appreciate appreciate brother dillard and we want to pray for the family amen that the lord will just keep them during this season and he would help them you know as they as they you know they're going to celebrate thanksgiving together i've been texting his daughter uh rebecca she's been a dear friend of mine uh for years and you know we were just i'm just telling her how much her family has meant to us over the years and um you know we're just very grateful and you know happy that he's not suffering anymore and that he's going on to get his rewards so amen let's let's keep the dillard family in our prayers amen um let's stand we'll have a word of prayer and and um i will turn the service over to uh brother diggs we're so happy to have him with us a man and fellowship on this weekend and uh he's been another dear friend of mine for a number of years and and um you know and i'm just i'm just grateful i was telling you all uh just a little bit last night of how we first started out he was like one of the first evangelists to come uh to this area and preach for us and and uh he did it you know just uh because the lord led him to do it sometime he got people say don't go there right but he came anyway and he was a blessing you know to this church been a blessing for years and one of the things he touched on last night uh it was talk about his throat and how uh he hadn't been able to sing the way he used to sing and you know you just don't want to scratch and all that but one time brother diggs had come and um i had i was going through the same thing i just from preaching and from singing i could i couldn't hit a note for nothing you know i just couldn't sing anymore and uh one time he got me connected with a brother that i hadn't seen in years uh brother uh belton and my brother belton came with his sons and you know we had a meeting here in the old sanctuary that we had and um and and uh that that service that those brothers came uh at the end of the i think it was the last night um they were just the belt and boys were just sitting inside the church on the on the keyboard and just singing and i forget the song mercy said no mercy said no they were singing that and as they began to sing it it took me back to my old days because i used to sing that at church as a special and and uh and i ran inside the church listening to them saying i just jumped in wherever i could get in and god restored my voice right there on the spot and i've been singing ever since then miracles happen amen miracles happen and you know and i just i just thank god for that uh but you know i did also want to say it's good to have brother mike amen with us amen on the day and he was with us last night good to have him home visiting for a little bit and brother mike is uh uh he's under expectation his wife is expecting a little son i believe and a man and a brother micah told me looking married at night looking married but it looked good and then somehow last night after we all left here we went out to eat and and um we went and and and while we we're there eating um uh brother mike and uh brother jeffrey uh brother uh jerry amen and brother jerry's sisters uh they was they came to the restaurant we was and they brought somebody along with them and somebody hadn't seen in a good wow brother devin so good to see

let's bow in a word of prayer [Music] father we thank you o god [Music] for the life the ministry of brother tommy dillard god how we appreciate this man of god and lord and so much that he went through throughout the years but yet he served you faithfully he loved you he touched so many hearts and god even this church we have been touched by the ministry and i think of all that he did in in ghana lord and the many churches that was started because of his faithfulness there in ghana lord nobody else was watching but he was faithful lord all the work that he did there in fort wayne indiana god we thank you for that lord and we just appreciate this man of god and we want to lift up his family his wife his children lord grandchildren so many lord that are impacted by this loss but we ask that you would be their strength that you would comfort them that you would carry them lord through this hour lord we we know that you're able to turn their mourning into dancing and father uh if there's a a family member that does not know you in the pardoning of sin we pray god that they would come to know you because lord it takes death in order to bring life god made somebody come to know you through this lord as we begin to turn lord to service now uh god towards the preaching of the word we pray that you would use your servant brother diggs that you would just bless him a fresh lord and that he would speak words from heaven be glorified and magnified in this place today lord i also want to pray that you would touch my wife there at home that god you would just raise her up and whatever it is that the enemy is attacking her with we bind it now in the name of jesus and god we pray that you make a completely whole it's in jesus name that we pray amen can we give the lord a hand of praise for the digs amen we'll turn the service over to our precious brother amen i know you'll be blessed amen god bless you amen [Music] lord i love you more than anything i love you jesus i love you jesus [Music] [Music] amen praise god you know it's good to be in the house of the lord again you know and just listening to jack you know i came in this morning i was i feel excited amen there's nothing like the joy of the lord you know i i i i feel i feel like my brother mike he can't stop posting about his child and all that stuff is about to have every time you turn around you got something on instagram my baby on the way all this stuff you know so it's the happy times life is coming forth hey man so we just we just appreciate god you know what that long ago he was single you know running the streets of boston with me having a good time you know so we just uh praise god for everything you know i mean um church you know we spend so much time but we say fighting fighting against this fighting against that fighting in the atmosphere of the world sometimes we forget to enjoy that we saved all right we're christians we're under the blood you know all this stuff don't mean nothing when it comes to your predestination hallelujah so don't don't waste all your time fighting you know spend some time enjoying what god is doing in your life you know because that's that's when it's real when you can i believe that real overcoming is when you can see the devil for who he is and see who god is for who he is and you take it as it is you enjoy the lord you know so let's just they may have a word of prayer and we'll go right into the word of god amen hallelujah hallelujah lord jesus father you're truly worthy of all the praise lord we love you more than anything lord words can't express how good how great you are to his father and lord god we just thank you for another day to sing praises unto you lord lord to be in divine presence to hear your word lord to be strengthened lord and lord we pray lord that all those who are listening and all those who are here father you would just connect in a spiritual way lord lord god you will lift us up higher lower than the atmosphere we're already in but take us lord into your presence lord lord where aaron's rod began to blood no way it seems like it was dead but in your presence and that's your kind of glory what seemed to be dead began to bring forth life so not only do you know what lies within us so father put us in an atmosphere so we can come forth lord lord we thank you for all things we thank you for pastor duff lord this is his family his church family lord we just pray father you just continue to do great things lord in the name of jesus christ we pray that church say amen amen let's jump right into the word of god amen we certainly appreciate all the songs of zion and well solomon had me going i almost came out there saying i plead i plead you had me going brother i thought i was home conducting amen you know it's church that's why it's important to to know who you are you know what i mean because you have some people and i'ma hit this real quick and i'm gonna get off but you have some people won't sing songs like that because it wasn't written in brother branham services but you tell me who inspired the writer to write that song it had to be god you know i plead i plead the blood right here that ain't come from the devil the devil don't want us to plead the blood the devil don't want to say you can't have my family you can't take my increase hallelujah the devil the devil not going to inspire somebody how are you to get victory in their lives i pray i plead the blood hallelujah let me leave that alone hallelujah let's go to um st john chapter 15. that's why you got to be comfortable with your skin hallelujah and half of those people that are afraid that they do it when they get home they're singing it in their mirrors i played i played the blood they never had a key but they doing it trust me they didn't told me i know saint john 15. amen let's start at verse uh verse one he says i am the true vine and my father is the husband every branch in me that brings not fruit he takes away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean to my word which i have spoken unto you amen let's go to um galatians chapter four galatians chapter four hallelujah galatians chapter 4 verse 1. you have to say man the bible says now i say that the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be lord of all look he's a child but at the same time he's lord of all but it's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen you have your seat say man man lord bless reading of his word as you're sitting let's go to um let's go to uh first samuel chapter 16. samuel 16. samuel 16. i believe that's what i want listen the bible says then samuel took the horn of allah and anointed him in the midst of his brother and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rhema hallelujah you know today my my subject you know church i just can't help it i'm telling jack the span that i'm in in my life is that i can't look at things uh that i'm going through as uh uh not working for my good i look at everything i'm going through there has to be something good coming out of it because that's the promise god gave me he said no matter what you're going through all things work together for good because those that love god those are called according to his purpose so no matter what you're going through you have to be able to take the mindset to say lord show me what you want me to see amen there's something in it that god is trying to rise you up to be amen and you know church today my subject by the grace of god is the test hallelujah of an innocent child test of an innocent child now church we may not we we as parents and different ones you know there are things that we do to our children to help them grow we we we assist in the process of they're growing and they don't even realize that they're being tested they don't even realize they're being tried but what we're doing we're trying to get them to mature we're trying to get them to a place to where they can handle certain responsibility and you must realize god is the same way god takes us through things so we can grow but i want you to realize you know a lot of times people go through things and we'll say oh the devil we've done that too much we've given the devil credit when he don't deserve it the devil is running to god saying you know i can't do this except you give me permission but what we do we get down in prayer and we start calling on the devil oh lord the devil does oh lord the devil that oh lord and god is saying i thought i was in control of your life see church you must be careful at your confession you know even if you lose your house your car you can't say well the devil may be losing if you make that confession you're saying that the devil is control of your life god is in control so if i lose it praise god if i get it praise god you know i would whatever's taking place i i'm determined to say praise god but you know church as an innocent child we go through things and we uh don't understand why sometimes god don't give you an answer sometimes god is quiet that doesn't mean he's not on the scene sometimes god will stay quiet hallelujah because he's watching you grow he'll stay quiet because he knows you're gonna your prayers are gonna become more intense your worship is going to become more like spirit and truth hallelujah so he'll just sit back and watch you grow hard he'll sit back and be quiet till you get into that place where he can just put his finger on you and say see that's what i was looking for but church when we as christians let me let me dive into this you know sometimes we think because we have the holy ghost that there's no room for error all right that's the deception that the devil has tried to get us to believe church the only time we're going to be perfect in this body is when we're translated they're going to be uh times and spaces where we're going to see ourselves growing hallelujah and the only way you grow let's read let's read listen i want you to understand the grace of god today hallelujah i feel good church i want you to understand the grace of god like jack jack was just talking about uh brother dilla i remember the first time i met brother dylan i thought we was in macon at brother larry's uh convention and you know what i was seeing that thing i was like what this old man gonna do you know by that time he was a little bit old and everything and i'm like this old man they're supposed to be a revival they like you know i was young and dumb you know what i mean i'm thinking you know got to be young people whatever the case is and i said you know what i bring this old man man that man stopped preaching hallelujah he started tying stuff and kicking his leg and doing all i was like whoa boy when i get his age i want what he got hallelujah hallelujah so thank god for brother dylan amen you know and all the other uh soldiers that have gone on but luke church um if you will let's let's let's let's go back to um saint john right quick let's go back to saint john chapter 15. we want to bring out something you know and i kind of want to just uh deal with this area because i want to encourage you amen saint john chapter 15. let's read verse 2. the bible says every tree in me that bear is not fruit he taketh away he say every branch that buried fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit so look the tree is already breathing for fruit but god says that you beat forth more fruit i'm going to purge it honestly what does this purge mean let's look at it church we're going to deal with something now now the tree is bringing forth something already it's being used of god but now he says i'm going to purge it purge means to cleanse now you mean to tell me i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm serving god but god said i still need to be cleansed i'm going to purge you that you breathe for more fruit let's read it a little bit more he says i'm going to purge it he said purge this is the definition of purge purge means to cleanse of filthy impurities not too much now you can't tell me that you don't have thoughts you should not have hurry but what happens god comes in with the word and he begins to purge it hallelujah he begins the cleansing of his unfilthiness now you may say well brother diggs you know uh the holy ghost is supposed to take all those things away and it does the holy ghost holy first let's deal with sanctification how do you know you're sanctified if you're really sanctified it's not by how you dress holy she really put uh sanctification and all these things on the outside god is never dealing with your outside he's always dealing with the life inside of you so if you get purged you're getting purged from the inside out because who you are on the inside is the real you because there are people who can sit in church dress right look right everything leave here and go do some foolishness who you are is in your heart what you really believe but to really be sanctified the prophet of god say is when god comes and he takes the one two away everybody sacrifice i said does anybody say to fight see when you're really sanctified god will change your desires the world that doesn't mean you may not sleep up and do it but if you're really sanctified there's no desire to do it that's the reason why i read david luke church i'm gonna run this down i don't plan on being alone but look at david honey saul hallelujah couldn't obey god so god said i'm gonna get a man after my very own heart can we agree god's saying i'm gonna get a man after my very own he didn't go get david but david being an innocent child did not realize what he had to go through to be king he didn't realize what he had the trials and tribulations and all the things he had to go through hurry as a man of god's own heart david was king but he had to be purged look look god didn't make his heart hurt into the place he was supposed to be when he chose him he already had the heart of god but god had to clean him up make him fit for the usury of the holy spirit look church david remember i said an innocent child david being called of god all his brothers were like man please not david david ain't doing all he's doing is taking care of sheep what about me lord i'm tall i'm big i'm strong god said no i want a man with a certain character that i'm looking for but look church hunger david didn't even know he had the strength within him to kill a bear to deal with a lion all these things why because god was setting him up for goliath he didn't realize just the innocence of a child hallelujah out there dealing with the sheep that one day he was gonna have to fight a lion but god knew he would be able to overcome it god put him in a place where he get glimpses of the power in his life i wonder how many of you god is getting glimpses of the power in your life and you ain't doing nothing with it god gave david glimpses of their power with the bad bear he was a lion so that's why david could stand up didn't tell saul i fight goliath he had already seen glimpses of the power so dave was like lord he said i'll go and fight but look look at how his brothers received him he's just an innocent child he's innocent going through a test so you know what church he is dead he's got his dad comes he says hey i want you to go y'all know like i said last night i want you to go take your brother some chipotle so he gathered up everything david going down there david don't even know goliath is down there david don't even know that a battle is going on his father has told him caleb go take your brother something to eat he's walking into this situation innocent but god said even when you bring him for fruit i that's why it's important to come to church church now david he steps out there hallelujah and you know next thing you know he's bringing the food how do you mind his own business he's innocent he breaks the food and the next thing he hears break me man irritating to david see everybody else got used to hearing the devil stream but david wasn't used to that kind of stuff in his ear he didn't used to hearing the devil talk to him [Music] some of us didn't got used to hearing the devil talk to us and we don't even challenge his voice david heard him streaming bring me in there bring me a man and they were like huh huh who does what what's going on who is this and his brothers got mad at him because he was willing to take the to take the challenge so david says who is this uncircumcised philistine hallelujah that has defied the armies of the living god he walked into the battle innocent holy but and his innocence he was equipped for the battle his brother's been been there all this time they said go live streaming for 40 days for the night bring me a man premium man and you know how the devil is he's so subtle to be like hey ain't no need for innocent people to die they don't need hey look ain't nobody watching you just go ahead you know wine is good for your stomach wine is good you know we're in a pandemic you know that's why i might this wine might stop the virus don't worry about going take a drink ain't nobody look bro jack don't see you don't worry about it so it's don't worry look a sister told me she said the sister told me she said uh she was you know laura was dealing with her you know about living closer to him you know she once was out kind of like in the world and you know she's raised right she's trying to make her way back and you know she was wrestling with wearing pants she's having them thoughts should i say with my pants you know you know what people do when they ain't around to church people that they put them on they going by they building they be stepping to doing their thing she worried about nobody you know what i mean but what you fail to realize is god see you you don't have to put on for us god see you he's though and let me say like this we're not your judge god is if you're a person you can't shake nobody's hand and fellowship with them because of the things they might be going through you need prayer holy because how many times did we ever see christ condemn a sinner he let the word do it hallelujah he never just openly just blasted the ceiling now he blasted the sadducees pharisees because they were religious sinners hallelujah but church just the innocent people you look they brought the woman to him say hey this woman was caught in adultery but god being much wiser to me god just sit there writing in the sand and in his mind he probably thinking this woman was set up because where is the man so he said really you be without seeing you cast the first stop don't measure your your christian ability or experience by the person you're sitting by you measure it by what god has did in your life how much you have overcome oh yeah because if i met if i try to mess with myself up to jack there's some things god did in his life he will never do in mine oh yeah so church look david he's out there and i'm just running kind of fast because it's somewhere i want to get david he's out there church and he's he's uh uh he is goliath now he's innocent he had no intentions on going in a fight that day but god said you know what they need to see somebody they need to see somebody that ain't afraid they need to see somebody that's going to step up to the challenge and not only just somebody but one of their own what are brothers people what are they message believers i want them to see what their real potential is that's why when you go through a trial you have to go through it like a soldier because god may have you on a pedestal and somebody in your family may be watching you to see how you're going through it and if you go through it wrong it's going to throw them off but if you go through it right they're going to get saved hallelujah let's go through it right let's not mumble and complain when was the last time you said lord i thank you for my trial church i had cancer in my brain they tried to give me diabetes rachel not once but twice sure but all glory to god because i walk untouched every time because i plead i plead the blood ladies say you got diabetes i said no sweet tea we're back again so you got diabetes i said no chocolate chip cookies ain't that scripture the scripture says whatever you say and then i think i told this testimony the doctor comes back to me and she says well mr diesel what did you eat last night i said well i have some sweet tea and chips ahoy she said sweet tea and chips she said yeah she said yeah well sometimes it'll show up in your system like that so i'm like i'm thinking you know i got a revelation so i'm like if it'll show up in my system like that key and cookies why you ain't calling ted cookies why does he try to change the name see how sleek the devil is she agreed with me that is tea and cookies but then she tried to change the name of diabetes don't you let the devil change his name on you it's tea it's cookies it's five guys it's all that you putting it in your body and you got the power to tell it what to do hallelujah church now david is there and david would say hey i'll fight his goliath his brothers get mad at him because he's willing to accept the challenge is that something he's innocent he had no he had no intentions on going there to fight but david heard it stepped up to the battle and his brother got mad at him because he was willing to fight you know hallelujah their pastors hallelujah who the people have got mad at them because they kept church going doing covet we all you got to remember the people and listen he said i am remembering the people there are people who want to be in the presence of god there are people who want to come to church and operate in the scripture where it says when you see that they're approaching you ought to fellowship them all hallelujah church just like y'all amen you know my pastor were receiving persecution because he kept the church open and then when in that moment our governor came and said church is essential i'm not closing it thank god for sc hallelujah church is essential amen so my pastor kept the church over just despite what people thought and all this stuff and behind we didn't know that there were people among us accusing him people among us that he would feed daily until that time turned on him now we didn't know we going to church having a good time praising god then all of a sudden was in church and a sister was singing a song then she started speaking in tongues oh hallelujah and then she started interpreting hallelujah and then they didn't lost he said i am the lord thy god i'm the one who told the pastor to keep this house open [Applause] the bible says touch not my anointing you better be careful how you talk to jack the lord starts saying some things directly to the pastor directly to the church i'm the lord that that have told him to keep this house open and the lord said i have done this talk about the closet the lord said i've done this because this is going to bring my people back i don't know what the lord said in your church but this is what he said in mind he said i'm the lord hallelujah that have brought this church back hallelujah and then church after that the holy spirit started talking to me call my name for those of you who wonder in hallelujah he called my name and said my son i have heard your prayer i have seen your desire i know the integrity of your heart keep your head up don't stop pressing don't move to the left or to the right keep moving and moving and moving my son i am the same god who healed you from cancer in your brain and all that was good you know it was rejoicing praising the lord but you know what got me in that whole interpretation the lord said and i normally don't tell my business but y'all must be special i just let people form out their own opinions because i owe nobody no explanation ain't no church hallelujah the lord the lord said he said i'm the lord hallelujah who's called you i'm the lord who's healed you i'm still the same he said never question and then he said your steps have been ordered now you tell me something church if god come and tell you that whatever you're going through he said your steps have been ordered now who are you going to be mad at people may have done you wrong people may have same things people may have cut you off but god has come and said to you i have ordered your steps who are you going to be mad at what else can you do to say thank you lord [Applause] god told me what i'm going through he has honored the guests of an innocent child because i had questions i'm like lord i've been serving you i've been traveling the world preaching the gospel why am i going through this if god comes and he says your steps have been lord [Applause] i am the same god [Applause] even when you're breathing for fruit bring forth i fruit god was showing me that there's some stuff in me that he got to get out hallelujah and by the grace of god if i can be transparent he's still clean now i don't doubt whether i got the holy ghost or not because i wanted to give up but i [Music] [Applause] couldn't you know the prophet came the lord came to the prophet and he said if you try what you think you're going to end up like a bomb holy church i was trying to quit i had people calling me i had people calling me encouraging me say hey bro jeez keep pressing hey bro d why don't you come pre funny hey bro these hey brother come on come on encourage me one day church one day hallelujah y'all know me i love to dress up when people started one brother to church he realized that satan was beating me so he went on vacation and he called me he said hey well yeah he said i said i'm home he said i'm calling you because i'm concerned he said i seen you sitting in the back of the church it's been some time ago i ain't in that space no more i ain't down at the bottom of the mountain no more i may not feel to be at the top but i'm still climbing home i had some eagles drop me some meat how does the eagle get strong when you got calluses the other eagles bring them something to eat stop wondering about people calling and encouraging them amen where is the mercy seat the mercy seat is in the bride you call me he said hey brother i seen you sitting in the back of the church he said the first thought i had that is not brother cadre he don't sit in the back of the church he said brother i know you're going through he said but hey don't let the devil listen to this he said don't let the devil take your joy once he take your joy he gonna knock you out once you leave that that freshness that excitement out of serving god then the devil can get you to do anything because you start feeling sorry for yourself you start feeling pity but look i was innocent hallelujah an innocent child but this test was gonna make me stronger than i ever was he said hey i don't even know what you're going through but i can tell something ain't right he said because you're coming to church with jeans and tennis shoes on that ain't you that ain't me i'm normally hallelujah it's something some fine rule hallelujah a little bit of silk hallelujah church real spiritual people they can catch it when you're going through something and they are there to help lift you up hardly but what was happening god was purging he was persian church hallelujah and you know what that that that interpretation just came this year so i had to keep pressing and keep pressing until i heard from god hallelujah and you know what the enemy was saying give up this and that get rejected all these things but you got to keep pressing early you can't give up sometimes you got to reflect back like david did i can fight this goliath because i already fall back why is he going to fight goliath because he had a testimony a child is no more than a servant until he matures look though he be lord of all look church purge means the cleanse of filthiness et cetera hollywood the brutal tree finds unless uh uh unless it's you look at the metaphor listen to me what purge means hallelujah free from guilt now all of us needed that kind of purging hallelujah but look let's look at it david was a man of the godzilla but look let me tell the end of what the lord said to me he said i'm the lord who hath upholded thee the lord said and i will uphold thee ain't none of us keeping ourself god doing it oh yeah and you know what church i truly believe because i had got to a place to where no matter what sister brown i was going to keep coming hallelujah i was going to keep giving god praise and worshiping him no matter what people thought no matter what people said so i believe god allowed that to happen not only for me but my sisters and brothers i fellowship with so they can have some comfort hallelujah so they can cast down all the rumors and all the nonsense [Music] praise god that god allowed it to happen hallelujah because there's a persian for more fruit hallelujah look church remember with the holy ghost sometimes you will make mistakes that you don't want to make listen to that part that you don't want to make that's the difference of a person who got the holy ghost and a person that just got a ghost things happen that you don't want to happen why because there's something god wants to deal with hallelujah god like i said last night god dealt with abraham in such a way he already called him the father of faith but he took him through an innocent trial he didn't even know that he was going to have to make a decision should i give up my wife or should i keep my life but listen in the heat of that moment abraham he said you know what you my sister he started reasoning now look they wasn't living together as sisters and brothers technically that was his sister but they weren't living together assistant brother with his husband and wife that's what we call a white lie the white light got some truth in it but you know uh god forgive me he know my heart but god knew abraham had a little line in him so god put him in a place he put him in a position he innocent his wife going a certain way king saw his wife and say hey you know what i got to have her and at the same time while the king was going to see abraham tapped into it he tapped into it before it even happened and he said look you're beautiful and they're going to they don't want you so they're going to kill me so you my sister look he already premeditated the lie now god put him in position hallelujah put him in an innocent trial so god can rise that lie up hallelujah and that god dealt with that lie but let me ask you something did that lie change god's promise god wanted to deal with him and once god dealt with it hallelujah god showed abraham his life god let the king go down even though he lied and everything god told the king if you don't give him back he was good as a dead man even though his servant his child was lying that still did not stop or change god's promise to his son why because he was a son with that lying spirit inside of him but god said i'm going to purge you so that you really can be the father of faith and from that point he never lied again hey so god would allow things to happen so that you could bring forth more fruit look remember like i said last night the prophet of god hallelujah innocent the test of an innocent child he's just serving the lord you know he got uh uh uh uh mission funds all these things boom here come the irs you owe us some money you're like what what you know i'm doing what i'm supposed to do hey what is this you owe us so many thousand and back in them days i was like me and now the prophet he can't do nothing about it and the people are on his back they own his track and god ain't doing nothing [Music] god ain't doing nothing god let it prolong he let it prolong church think about this god let him prolong and you think about all the times the prophetess went and asked god to do certain things and god did it like that right but in this moment god ain't doing nothing test of an innocent child what is he doing he's going to purge the prophet field the holy ghost seeing visions having having prayer lines casting out demons all the stuff but way down in there is a lion spirit that little church he he the people are calling them back and forth and you know the prophet had like three or four different lines church look at how strategic god is look church he comes home and the people call exactly when he's back home how do they know he was back in town how do they know which phone to use so they make the phone call now he's at home he's all under pressure about all the stuff and his wife and me say oh it's them system tax people again and he says tell him i'm out back he said he got out back everything was good but i got out of that i'm good but his wife his wife knew that wasn't quite right and he gave his wife credit for being a little bit more spiritual in that moment than he was she said now you know bill that wasn't quite right he said what i wasn't in the house look let me say this when god catch you don't try to reason your way out [Music] because reasoning your way out don't bring deliverance so you take an adulterer hallelujah and that adulterer will get caught that don't mean he's delivered getting caught don't bring deliverance getting converted will that's why a lot of times men and women they get caught and they go back and do it again because the spirit is still there but look church the prophet says he tells his wife well honey you know i wasn't i wasn't quite in the house she said now you know beard i wasn't quite right but the test of an innocent child now he's thinking everything good it's all this just my wife ain't even realized that media was representing god you sisters stand on your convictions sir the prophet now he's meant to go and bring forth fruit like he's always done now he's gonna go pray for a child hallelujah he steps out there to pray and god tells him get your filthy hands off that child you ain't fit to pray for a child like lord what you mean you just told a lie god's bringing it all back to him church did he have the holy ghost was he saved was he being used by god but this is the point church hallelujah he didn't have the desire to lie earlier he got caught up in all the pressure it was a test but what was god doing none of us none of those people back then they could see that spirit of him but god could all they saw that he was the prophet being used of god but god said holy he ain't quite there yet i got to put him in a situation where i can get that lying spirit out before him embarrass himself i have ordered your steps church look now the prophet holland he says i personally say even when you bring forth fruit uh percy that you bring forth more fruit in that church he gets down there he's trying to pray god said you ain't even worthy don't put your hands you just told a lie so you know what he does he goes back to the man holly he goes back to his office and he confesses hallelujah see that's the heart of god see he didn't try to continue on in his mischief he didn't go to the man's i always say well y'all calling me y'all put all this pressure on me y'all doing all this stuff to me and i did nothing wrong he tried to explain his lie all he did was say yeah i did it and he called he's talking to the man he said look he went to the man office face to face he said no you know when you just called me i was home and i'm sorry i lied to you i didn't mean to do it see the man put his hand on his shoulder and said mr branham i always had respect for you he said but now i got more respect that you bring forth more fruits oh my the free from guilt that's what persian does but of church we could go we could step a little bit further let's look at david hallelujah now david is the king hallelujah now god hallelujah has him in the house of has him in the house of solomon and all david is due he's innocent he's just being what god wants him to be all of a sudden a javelin comes crosses him saul was angry with him just for being a child of god just for having the anointing on his life david didn't know what was going on with saul hallelujah but god put david in that place so he could see hallelujah what kind of king he shouldn't be so he put david in the atmosphere with a man he loved hurry david love saw david had respect for saul now how you gonna love somebody that's trying to kill you it has to be the nature of god because god did he loved the people that killed them on the cross amen the test of an innocent child church now holy sabbath i think i think i think he threw javelins at david at least three or four times and all he's doing is trying to help the man everything he has david to do david go do it they think you know javelin he's telling david to go do this javelin she's so angry so mad david kept the anointing upon his life david would come hallelujah while he's all messed up with all them demons on them stand there and worship with them what a beautiful name it is a beautiful name is the name of jehovah uh king now listen david was so anointed that he could drive off a spirit that god put there church we supposed to have something real look just coming to church that shouldn't be a trial we should be way overcome that we should be way down the road holla we should come here and turn this place upside down we shouldn't be home i wonder if i'm going to church tonight if you fight in that battle you need to get to the altar church and even church earlier saul was trying to kill david david playing the music all the stuff rising and demon up but to know that god put it there every time david drive it away and come back hallelujah church he was innocent he didn't even realize what he stepped into but he was already anointed king hallelujah so he had to go through these things and next thing you know hallelujah now he's running from saul hallelujah he's running and running and running next thing you know hallelujah god puts his enemy in his hands now now he has him and he can do whatever he wants to do with saul but there was something in his heart that he didn't want to touch god's anointing and got mad at anybody else who wanted to kill the man that was trying to kill him that seems like a man with real integrity he wasn't there yet he wasn't there yet the trial for david didn't really start till he got the power of king until he got the position of king all that stuff with all that stuff we saw that's what you call a pre-workout all right it ain't the real workout so it's just what's really gonna get it going huh because at that moment david had all his boys he had everybody with him all the rest of the giant killers you know all of them you know but then god was going to put him in a place where it was just him by himself hallelujah and you know what it was church now david is king he got all power 500 wives now god is going to purge him now remember he's a man of god's very own heart i don't want you to lose sight of that he's a man of the god's very own heart that's the reason why god chose him but then david go see a naked woman taking a bath and he already got 500 wives and something rolls up on david and say man i got to have him i got to have her you know he david went and took another man's wife god knew he had an adulterous spirit inside knew he had an adulterous spirit inside of him god knew he had premeditated murder inside of him what i love about god he didn't tell nobody else what was going on in david the only other person knew what david was guilty of was nathan your royals didn't even know none of the captains heard none of them knew nobody knew what david did the only one knew what david did was god and nathan see god knows the thoughts and intent of your heart and if you're not willfully out there just doing stuff god won't embarrass you hallelujah he'll put you in private and deal with it now you got to accept the help now if you don't accept the help then you may get exposed because he says child go and sin no more unless a greater thing come upon you once god show you your wrong show your sin hallelujah don't you just lightly esteem it get it right see a man of god's very own heart will accept correction and repent i want to show you the power of repentance before this is over david hurry up he commits adultery takes a man's wife hallelujah sets the man up gets the man killed and even made an offspring whoo was he not a man after god's very own heart did that change does that change what god thought about it did god say i can't use you no more david nope nope with all that wrong he did god still kept him keen and god still kept the hands of war on him god still kept authority in his life now listen don't bring an uncertain sound to what i'm preaching to you this morning i'm not preaching it's okay to sin i'm not preaching it's all right to do filth what i'm saying is sometimes the devil will get a lick in but is it really the devil or is it god giving room holly for the devil to be your sparring partner he can't beat you but you he just letting you you trade with him for the real match you need to turkey pre-workout now the devil's sparring with you but there's a greater match that's going to come hallelujah so now church amen david didn't done all this david pre-meditated murder then call your riot say hey why don't you go home and spend the night with your wife trying to put his mistake on the next man was he still a man of god's very own heart are we going to drive it home because what we do we see people going through things and because we don't know what's going on we immediately cast judgment ah you know so and so left messaging so and so this happening they just and they that how we know god ain't allowed it how we know god ain't rising up stuff and taking it out so we can get them to the next level because remember with all david's mistakes hallelujah he still was anointed kings hollywood and even after that hallelujah they anointed him king over jeweler church now david anybody in the bible now i go back to the prophet because he still has some stuff too that we know that a prophet is born a prophet holy am i right he was born a prophet before he even realized he was a prophet you know what he had a spirit of murder inside of him yes he did i would probably had a spirit of murder inside remember he got beat up hallelujah he got beat up hallelujah what did he do he went and got his gun and said i'ma kill every last one of them and he wasn't bluffing but was he not a prophet before the foundation of the world i'm gonna take away your reasoning and to show that whatever god does god does holy church he was a prophet hallelujah before the foundation of the world but he had murder inside of him premeditated murder and you know what the boys beat him up and you know what he said jerry went back home and got his gun he said i'ma kill every last one of them got that gun and look premeditated sat in the bushes knew the way that they come home and waited on them does that sound like a private you know what it was it was the death of an innocent child god let him get beat up so bad so he could see that you can't kill nobody except i allow it church he sits there puts the bullets in the gun he says jumps out jumps out he's not bluffing he's been a blast on all of them he's like they say like the gates are safe he finna put in work caused the gun he wasn't bluffing his testimony is i pulled the trigger well that sounds like that sounds like a murderer a lot of profit right [Music] oh i don't sound like a little profit to me sound like a murderer premeditated murderer church pulling police i pulled the trigger holly not once bullet jam up put another one in not twice he kept putting him in there as long as he could see him he kept reloading he wanted to kill somebody he wanted somebody to feel some pain let me ask you a question was he not a prophet in that moment church i'm trying to rise you above your trials because what satan does when we go through things he tries to make you feel condemned but could it be god allowing things to happen so he can rise it up and sweep it off look church now all those boys got out of his sight he takes the same bullet that jammed up put it back in put it in the gun power and now he has a testimony that god protected him from being a murderer and he wasn't even in the office of a prophet yet but he was still a prophet now he has a testimony that earlier when i when i get in a place where i'm angry remember he used to be a boxer because he had he had a temple but god is going to purge and bring all the stuff out hallelujah so when he gets him in his office to use them none of that stuff will be a factor think about hollywood he goes from that point to getting beat up the test of an innocent child see church when you go through your things you have to go back and reflect and see what god has done in you already because in that moment when he tried to kill her he still was a prophet amen he just hadn't stepped in the office yet so what was god doing god was protecting that seed he was protecting that gift now he takes that same man who got beat up by those little boys that he wanted to kill put him in a put him in a meeting where a man would spit in his face you know what ain't no murder there no more ain't no fighting there no more hallelujah what's happened it's been purged now he's gonna bleed for some food that the whole world would see that the whole world would wish they had that kind of power he's going in that in that moment he's going to reflect the heart of god church is easy for us to quote a good quote quote scripture you know the bible says love those who despitefully use you you know what what about the one where it says pray for your enemies if that's just a good quote for you uh uh you still got some way to go but god wants to manifest this thing look the man comes running down the aisle all the other preachers jumped up and they gone because they didn't see what he could do the prophet standing there the man said you snake in the grass i'ma do this i'm gonna do that to you i'm gonna do everything he just said didn't move he said i'm gonna break every bone in your body the man who was an undefeated boxer brother was an undefeated boxer six second smith hello that's what he was trained by so if he wanted to fight he knew how to fight harley and i'm pretty sure he could have tucked that man down because back in those days they wasn't fighting with gloves he was bare knuckles hallelujah but in that moment hallelujah he was fighting a different way it wasn't a physical affair anymore hallelujah he says even when you're bringing forth fruit i'm approaching that you bring forth more fruit church now you're standing there and the man says no that ain't what he did ain't what it did because i haven't been preaching i might have been got too close to one of y'all and spit on you and you be like amen brother amen amen brother preach oh you know somebody spit on you trying like you ain't see it you know i ain't doing that intentionally so it's all right that spit don't hold the same weight as me purposely getting in your face and going that's what this man did it wasn't just no you talking i'm talking to you and a drip or two hit you on the chin or hit you on the top of your eyes so you know you saw it that's not a real battle you're looking at me like i'm still your brother brother spit on me but he's still my brother that was love spit he's still my brother but the same person come out be the same uh human being come and gargle on you and you know the intent is wrong look you in your face rail back with some wind and you tell me nothing don't rise up in you church listen to me good in that moment nothing was there in that prophet this man railed back remember he was angry he was out of his mind so he just walk up and say ah no he's putting a stamp on it and the prophet said i knew better than to say anything now catch the scene spit dropping down his face i knew better than to say anything dude and then something spoke out of me since you have decided to challenge the spirit of the lord think about this where was the lord where was the lord the lord was in that little frail body that just got spit on but just like he always did he wasn't going to fight with physical strength read your bible he never fought with physical strength it was always a spiritual affair holy he said i can call leaders of angels but he didn't do it holy church the prophet said that would speak going down his face hallelujah church you might say brothers you believe that yeah i believe it i believe that i wasn't there but i believe it hallelujah because we've all gone through things where we've been tried and when you fail what comes back to your mind how the profit overcame that's why these things are on tape hallelujah so we can overcome hallelujah but church look even even we got to get to the place where the scriptures say somebody smack you turn the cheek glad i ain't get a bunch of amen cause y'all know some of y'all ain't there some of y'all ain't dead y'all stop the fire somebody stop the fire item didn't go underground for a moment press pastor jack i can't i can't come back to search right now can't wait till the code over no you got to deal with that demon inside you the angry demon it shows up sometimes when you be on 95 behind somebody going too slow but you put stupor doing church what i'm saying it has to be something real it has to be a real reflection see god will purge us so that he can bring forth more fruit now you look at this you look at the prophet god spit on all these things and then the lord began to speak out of him since you've challenged the spirit of the lord today you're gonna fall over my feet and the man's response was i'll show you whose feet i'm gonna fall over and he railed back to hit who not brother branham he ran back to hit god let me ask you something when has god ever been touched unless he wanted to be touched that's if he and you me and me the only way to be touched is if god wants to be touched church and he rails back the punch hallelujah and the man falls over his feet and people say oh we need to get the handle on this and that blah blah probably say no this is a spiritual fan see more fruit he was already a prophet that's the same man harlow tried to kill him boys the same man the same man who had a vision of people cutting down his tree and he gave the man a quick three piece if you feel real like brother brandon had fighting in him he always said he had irish background mixed with the indian he was already fiery who ever seen a calm indian but what was it god was persian that he bring forth more fruit he was innocent though going through all that stuff and let's get back to david david hallelujah david he's premeditated murders done all these things god bless sheba all that hallelujah and now he's he's he's the baby's coming forth he's bringing uriah all the stuff trying to hide and everything and then finally he has your riot killed everything is all right he can kind of go on the ground with it and everything good but god gotta deal with him how's god gonna deal with him he's gonna show david himself that's how god deals with us it ain't up to you to come and rebuke me especially if it's not god and a lot of times that's what happened we'd be so quick and ready to rebuke somebody and it ain't even god because you're going to rebuke me i'm going if it's really god i said i'm supposed to feel your love that brother told me that for my good just like the brother told me man you sitting in the back of the church that ain't you you come to church with jeans and tennis shoes that ain't you brother d don't let the devil steal your joy i felt that with love so next service i came back to certain boy i had on a clean three-piece hallelujah had on my stasis hey man i got up in that boy well i found a new edition up in it i thank god for that brother that called me hallelujah ain't nothing like being free church no matter what people are saying no matter what you're going through where is your shout and dancing when you're going through something don't wait until the battle is over you have to shout now had to be careful i almost did that feeling good up in church the proper guys say the worst kind of person is a person that got just enough religion to make them sick coming to church don't want to be here songs on the board don't want to sing that that that just aggravates me the music right there you still still won't open your mouth that's just a defiant spirit i'ma tell my secrets i'm sorry i'm gonna tell you a secret when i see that spirit and sometimes people just be you know going through things they hadn't settled in or whatever you know so i ain't quick to judge so you know what i do if we get right church and let's go home and ain't doing that i said okay i'm gonna see if this is a demon or not so what i do is i switch it up and i go the blood the g the that he shut [Music] [Music] about what the blood has done in your life then it's a demon it's a demon that ain't the job then it ain't what the people did and what somebody say and all this stuff what i'm seeing about the blood of jesus christ and i can't get no worship out of you it's a demon holding you because you used to say well that ain't my nature i just ain't excited like that on listen i need to wind down church david now he does all this are you with me all the stuff david did are you with me let me ask you a question was he still a man after god's very own heart with that baby in beth shebo he still was a man out of god's very own heart even though he put your eye on the front line to get killed he still was a man after god's very own heart you know why because god wouldn't let him continue in his errors that's how you know god is in control so god says nathan down there mike and he says hey look here this is what you got to do he said look he said dave he said there was a man who only had one sheep one sheep and the other man he had plenty you know he was rich had plenty of stuff and this man went and took this other man's one sheep david got hot he got mad they were fine they already killed him they were like where are you at where are you at i don't take care of i didn't kill giants i didn't kill goliath everything bells lions well yeah i didn't want to scout heads and brought it back where yeah and david say is you nathan says you david what you did uriah and took his wife and all his stuff and david falls on his knees you know what it's one place where the prophet said besheba knew david will come harley say she knew david would come and see like that certain times of day she come out here and take a shower she knew dave was watching it david didn't go out and he didn't say well she'd do that every she knew i just bailed in mine in my business she come out there front and her body david didn't try to get out of it he said lord i have sinned fallen his knees and repented hallelujah and you know what church after he repented he never had that problem again that's right never had that problem again remember he went down to the neighborhood city hollywood he went down there told him to say hey hey uh give us something to eat give us some food give us this whatever and they would say i don't even know david i ain't giving him nothing david said i'm gonna kill him his brothers his mom and sister everybody and you know what neighbor had a beautiful wife named abigail david didn't try to take her and he liked it hallelujah look it was abigail who stopped david's wrath so he us he already had a liking to hallelujah but david didn't just take her from neighbor hallelujah why he waited until she fell in his hands then he redeemed her see he didn't have that spirit to go take another man's wife anymore remember david came down and david had guns blasting david was ready to get into it abigail came down there with her hands maze and all the food and she bowed down and she worshipped her she told david they have mercy and they were like god told me i wish i had a woman like this whoa we're like girl because of you i ain't gonna do it we gonna we gonna back up we're gonna go where we will and the neighbor heard about all of it hardly fell off the chair and broke his neck david said i got it anyway and i even had to do that she fell in my life thank you lord thank you oh thank you lord god has blessed me thank you lord i had to do nothing fail in my life thank you lord whoa that's when god do something when god do something then they says can't say nothing [Music] god was showing them what a king is really supposed to be like if i can everybody all right if i can now i hope this is encouraging you because no doubt we got things we're struggling with determine i'm in there hallelujah why do you think i'm preaching this it's a revelation hollywood it's these i've had to overcome and it didn't start until i started going through a strenuous trial like i had one brother his daughter was gonna marry a guy that she he didn't approve of the guy was whirling you know she grew up in a christian home and all this stuff and one day the young man rolls up at him well as he rolls up and rolls up and knew he was a christian knew he was a christian man young man rolls up adam got in his face like what you gonna do old man what you gonna do pops i gotta and he said in his mind that boy was up over and down but he said he knew he couldn't do it because he did it he lost the respect of his wife and he had beat up his wife his girlfriend's boyfriend he lost her respect so what he had to do he had to take it easy he had to leave the house can you imagine that you know you can put a whipping on somebody but it's something holding you back it's something spiritual angels got angels got them arms cause you know if angels ain't had it you will be back you'll be down at the county church he says he wasted everybody leave and then he came back it was just him in the young man and he knocks on the door he steps in he said look here earlier i want you to understand something i wasn't afraid of you he looked at a young man he the man young man that's real tally look at him like i want you to know i ain't afraid of you i just ain't engaging with your father he said well if you ever try to handle me like that again it's gonna be some problems i ain't scared of you the young man said yes sir yes sir i know i know you wasn't afraid of me i know you know why he did that because he had an audience and he knew that man hollywood loved his family so much he wasn't going to do anything to make them go away what but that was the end of his trial that was the pre-workout hallelujah so now this young man is in the family doing still ain't saved stealing uh treating his daughter right doing all kind of crazy stuff and you better be careful who you get tall dark and handsome might put a whipping on you hallelujah 36 26 might spray your face with some mace hallelujah church this young young man hallelujah he did so much stuff this man's daughter all this stuff till he start developing a complex the young man came one day hallelujah uh real sick was calling for him knew he was a pastor knew he had power in his life call him say hey i need you come pray for me you know what he said nope i ain't coming [Music] call again start telling his girlfriend tell your daddy come pray for me i know god hears prayer talking pray for me i'm real sick he said man i ain't gonna pray for him i ain't man please i ain't coming he called him about three times he still didn't come then god started dealing with him he said see i allowed this to happen to deal with that hatred that was inside of you i used this situation to bring out that spirit of hatred hallelujah an indifference that was in you that only this young man could bring out church you don't know who i am in church oh you do look at everybody boy that was a problem that's a preacher you don't know what's down inside what we're struggling with you don't know what the next man is struggling with holly when them birds are trying to make nests on our heads but that same brother he overcame and now he can treat that young man even though he ain't safe or whatever treat him with the same love of god what was it it was hardly the purging of the tree oh my i think y'all get it church don't get so caught up in your failures for you to fail in any kind of way god has to allow it hallelujah but one thing you must realize if you are bride if you are the true seed of god your trial doesn't change the sea within because you can have a hurricane out here and take apple trees down tear down the main goal blow them over break branches crop crops everything but that tree is still standing when the season come forward to bring forth fruit it's going to bring forth the same fruit so the hurricane didn't change the life within it all it did was alter the structure a little bit but if it stays in the presence of the sun it'll straighten back up and it'll push out like it normally does church one more and then i'm gonna quit hardly i want to show that god chooses us already knowing hallelujah what we're going to do already knowing the mistakes we're going to make and like i said i want to show the power of repentance david repented remember he repented for all the things he did with bathsheba and what came out of that psalm 51 created me a clean heart hallelujah we renew the right spirit within me all that came up what happened with besheba but church from that moment because he repented he never went through that again see repentance drives the spirit out hallelujah but church you look holy one more person amen there's a man in the bible his name is peter you're under him right look here we repeated with one of them peter one of them people in church who still had a little cussing demon demon in inside of him they're getting a little upset with the people at chapel i'm sick of but you know what in that moment he was cussing and doing all that stuff you know what else he was doing healing the sick and raising the dead let me ask you something when he was cussing was he not a disciple his cussing harlow didn't change his destination god knew he was going to do that hello but let's back up a little bit more hallelujah before he got there hallelujah hey look jesus came to him he said hey who do men say i am listen to this man this man was revelated revelating with a cousin demon inside another a cussing angry demon church he goes he comes in that he comes in there he says he says he says who the men say i am peter says some say they say some say jeremiah some say isaiah some say you wanted a prophet he said but who do you say i am peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god he says peter well done my son he said flesh and blood have not basically he's saying god is with you god is with you next scene next scene but but before i get there hallelujah he said god is with you and because god is with you peter i'm gonna give you the keys to the kingdom oh peter this revelation you got i'mma build my church on i want this revelation to you to be the example that's it and then peter walks out and they say we come to get jesus you come to get who y'all remember he said thou art the christ if he really understood what he was saying he knew jesus can defend himself but he got caught up in his flesh he had a little angry in him unless he still had a little fighting in him hallelujah so peter pulled out that knife you know what look church i want you to understand honey they wasn't as sharp and crafty as we are today you know we got jiu-jitsu and jeju-su and all this other soup and all this other cadate and a latte and a latte church i don't believe peter was so precise he was trying to chop off an ear he was going in for the kill he was going in for the kill but god hallelujah wanted to show him mercy only allowed in an ear even even in his anger god was going to use him to produce a miracle god allow that to happen so he could do a healing in the in the in the presence of the unbelievers jesus y'all know i feel good jesus jesus allowed it to happen did he get rid of the evidence so nobody could bring any charges against peter [Music] why why because he told peter upon this rock i'm gonna build my church so i can't get nothing into this revelation hello they ain't gonna be able to go back and say i i can't deal with peter peter chopper off no god got rid of the evidence holy because god knew he one day he was gonna be the spoke person for everybody hallelujah what was it was a pulling church approving god allowed that here to be cut off hallelujah just so he could do a miracle get rid of all peter's uh charges and everything but he wasn't done yet come on now he walking downs you know the church is scattered everybody's running covered everywhere they go cold everybody running church they say hey they're going to want to his assignment repeaters are not me not me i want i ain't down with that somebody say there you go they don't want to say no not me not me i don't know him and later come and say what you when you one of the ones i told you i told you i ain't one of them now leave me alone y'all sowing souls always dissing that messing with me probably cuts his way all the way out of the temple but this is what i want you to catch god allowed that to happen you know why because him and jesus had to make eye contact come back and read your bible god told me he said before the crow crop three times you gonna deny me holly so that last time when he denied him the bible says and he looked at jesus can you imagine you just did the wrong that god told you you was gonna do and you were unaware that you were gonna do it and you do it and now the next thing you're looking at is the eyes of jesus he probably felt by this being that's why he said man i'm going back fishing ain't no hope for me ain't no for me i give up but what was god doing even in that moment listen to me good night in that moment he still had the keys to the kingdom [Music] still had the keys to the kingdom church and look when christ came back after he was crucified peter was among those that the lord came back to hallelujah and now god's going to anoint him for the next work harlow you told me that go go go go to jerusalem and wait go just go and wait hallelujah now that it gets up there hallelujah and the anointing falls who's the person that comes out who's the first one to come out and say this is death we're not drunk as you suppose see church god knew that he was always that peter but what he had to do he had to clean him up remember like i said last night once that shell breaks away in the dirt the next thing that it sees is water and the water begins to wash the seed while it's in the dirt listen pruning what is pruning to prune a tree listen what it says trimming for tree trees health is often referred to as pruning and this is what it it involves removing branches that are diseased i don't know about y'all but i thank god for my pruning there were some things in my life that could cause a major sickness you know people fall into things and they get bitter a major sickness get indifferent a major sickness listen and it involves removing branches down disease infested hallelujah listen to this one or oh my this one blows me away jack hello pruning also deals with birches that are diseased infested or disinterested in growing my some of us need to be pruned my mama regular trimming keeps trees strong creates a healthier a healthier structure and reduces the need for future correction thank god for my pruning hallelujah church by the grace of god you may look at me say why brother dick so happy because i know god is in control church one thing we need to realize one thing we need to do hallelujah we need to understand what it means to be still and know that he's god because you're a child of god he's got to answer he's obligated it's just how long are you willing to wait on him and you know if you don't wait you're going to get messed up hallelujah but in closing i got i got if you're all right i got two coats i'm going to read you that's going boy this decodes where he gonna make you jump out your seat we a lot of times we misunderstand what our trials mean give me that quote in victory today sis listen listen to us now remember when god has counted you worthy what about a church has god accounted anybody look at it church listen this is how god has encountered you worthy god is country worthy when you have a test anybody worthy anybody being tested praise god god is calling me worthy when you don't be you you have a trial or test it shows look what that test shows it shows the grace of god has what i've been found by my test by my trial it shows that grace has found me hallelujah you found favor with god and god believes you'll stand the test [Music] does anybody in here have favor does anybody have favor do we have favor do we have favor the grace of god has found me why because i'm going through something praise the lord amen that's all right i was thinking about that old testimony hallelujah throw up the truck 150 got messed up hallelujah but look what was it it's the grace of god trump god has found you you found favor with god and god believes that you'll stand you remember he did the same thing by job and we know how job turned out he got it all back he got it all back all his cattle all his money all his riches all his prestige oh his children he got it all back what was it it was favor but job was experiencing the tests of an innocent child he did nothing wrong it was god pruning the tree so i'm gonna bring forth more give me the next closest [Music] oh we're gonna put it on this morning where i'm at go go go go there we go look now that ain't what i want i won't um we don't want to start it i want to start with uh that's the way god does his church same same message that's the way god starts his church hallelujah that's the way god starts his church he gives you trial after trial hallelujah trial after trial you're in the right message since you've got to find that paul that's the way god starts his church he gives you trial after trial ah there we go hallelujah hell yeah that's the way god starts his church he gives you trial after trial test after test you know what he said he gives you favor after favor grace after grace because remember he said when you encounter you worthy he takes you through what a test and you're going through a test whether it shows that the grace of god has found you so the more test i got the more favor i got [Music] the most things i go through it shows me that i got a bunch of grace in my life because god can't let me fail tests at the test he says until hurry the life of christ is reflected in you church these tests are making you look like jesus amen what is he doing until you become peaceful somebody needs some peace until you become sober until you know exactly what god is doing until you become meek gentle humble ready have hallelujah don't that sound like a wife i don't know about you but that sounds like a wedding vow i feel my helper coming on church until you become humble ready submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world and looking straight to calvary to the one who's doing the beating so now you realize we've been giving you these weapons all along now you realize we've been messing things up god's been doing the beating hallelujah what's he doing he's trying to bring that gold to the top listen he says who's the one who's doing the meeting many times you think it's strange because fiery trials church is not supposed to be strange he says in sickness and persecution it's only done to test you test is what favor of grace hallelujah i've been found he says look done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness

not going to settle for the things in our life that are hindering us but we're going to try to bring these things before god and make it right and say lord by myself it won't work lord i need your help if you're a person here this morning that needs the help of god there's something in your life you want to give to him you know you need to be purged that's not something to be ashamed of hallelujah because he says even when you're breathing for fruit he approaches you that you bring forth more fruit and i know most of us we want to bring forth more fruit we're not satisfied with the life we're living that's with the holy ghost if you want that help from god why don't you just lift your hands all here is about eyes are closed hallelujah god bless each and every hand hallelujah make your confession unto god hallelujah ask the lord to take these things out of your life let's just pray put your hands down let's pray hallelujah but i want you to make that confession in your heart hollywood open your mouth and tell god what you want me to do let's pray lord jesus father lord we know that you're a god of of purpose lord that anything you do is for our good lord it's for the the purpose of election might stand in our lives lord we go through things lord and we don't quite understand lord what a privilege it is to know that you're in control in order just to say that the steps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord lord god that our pathway lord that is light you shine father to give us understanding well we pray in this moment lord you just touch the lives of those who raise their hands lord and lord god you will take those things out of our lives that are hindering the move of god you know we pray to you a place of desire there for good a desire there for holiness and righteousness not a desire to be led by the holy ghost that we just won't live with mediocrity lord the lord will look for that perfection lord bless this church bless the hearts of those who are healed and hear the word of god lord those in the assembly those out there assembly lord lord and we say a lot of things lord we pray father you would make those things clear lord lord god that the enemy won't be able to bring an uncertain sound no we're not purposely making stabs or different things that people know only you know what's inside of an individual so give us a heart to surrender lord we love you and we thank you in the name of jesus christ we pray father you bring testimonies out of these services lord and even the services to come lord how we did like david or how we did like abraham we gave it to you lord and we repented and that spirit from that point was gone lord we thank you love you in the name of jesus christ we pray that church amen [Music] [Music] praise the lord let's give the lord another hand of praise for the word of the lord on today and the test of an innocent child i just think it's almost impossible that everyone that was sitting here uh present those that are listening online i think it's almost impossible uh if each one did not hear from god themselves amen i believe the lord just kind of went through so many uh um situations just through the examples that our precious brother was sharing um one thing that i was saying for myself is um i love being able to come to church you know after coming uh out of a fresh trial amen i mean if something just happened to you this week and you know i mentioned um a few weeks ago we were having a wonderful service and i said now don't think that the devil ain't gonna come with a trial after something like this and you know you say those things because just just being a christian for a number of years you see it happen over and over again and i i was uh i said that and then my god uh seemed like the devil just went roughshod you know uh there in our home and and uh just just just just a number of things i think a little accident with my daughter's car and had to put that in the shop and and um and then you know something happened within within the business there for me and and i was like lord i was not expecting this wasn't expecting this sometimes when things happen you are ready to put up your dukes and fight but god is showing you what's really on the inside of you right and you got to learn how to just let go and let god and and sometimes you know you know you we know all the quotes that if if you fight then god can't fight you know you you know all that that come to your mind but you're still trying to scheme you're still trying to come up with something you know i'ma do this but you you come here and hear the word of god like i ain't gonna do nothing but just let god be god hallelujah it's gonna turn out just fine that thing gonna turn around in your favor just like it did job and and uh look you're gonna end up in a better position than you was at the end if you just let god have his weight i i was blessed i i i was i was blessed [Applause] and um and each one you don't have to go and remind somebody now remember he said this man that was for you you know that was no no no no no no no no everybody take they part and apply it praise god don't just let this be something that went in one ear not the other no we heard from god here today and if everybody just take they part and apply we'll all be better people i believe the prophet told us that when we come to church we can leave one or two ways we can either leave better or worse and i'm determined to leave here better amen better better not bitter better amen god bless you brother diggs god bless you god bless you we we we we these two services have been right right on time i like to call it just what the doctor ordered god is good god is good god is good amen well i'm not gonna hold this any longer i encourage you this will be a good one to go back and listen to again and um you know just just let the lord just kind of uh just walk you through these these these these different examples just just real real real good the way he just worked with brother branham and all the things in his life he was still a prophet you know but and and we used to use that and use the david as a really good example but you have to see yourself in these various characters because no matter what it is you're still a son of god a daughter of god and he still cares amen about you no matter what not that he wants you out there sinning and displeasing uh what you sow you're gonna reap right but uh but i do tell you this that god will god will still love you he will never never cast you aside he just wants you to do the way he that his word has called for you to do it and i tell you if we learn to follow to be it'll be so much easier so much easier on us so praise the lord god bless you brother god bless you god bless you god bless you let's pray father we thank you for your word jesus uh god we just see ourselves and all these various characters that were being presented to us today and the holy spirit just dealing with each one of our lives our circumstances our situations only you could speak to us the way that you did today god we thank you for your love we thank you for your kindness thank you for your your spirit god the word comes and just soaks in and amen watering the seed that it might bring forth uh what was actually inside the seed there's a life there that was that was uh formed in it and god it takes situations in order to bring it conditions to bring it to where it needs to be god i pray lord that we won't let this just be another good sermon but god it would be something that would uh transform us something that would change us something that would draw us closer to you father lord that uh those areas of our life that we need work on lord the spirit has has allowed the light to shine in those areas today and god may we just lay it father the alt of our hearts and father we just trust oh god that uh we be renewed and refreshed lord through the word that the word wash us cleanse us and make us whole fathers are as our desire prayer a special blessing lord upon our precious brother diggs that you would continue to use him lord for your glory
