[35:57] earlier and also appreciate being here
[36:02] I believe God has more in store for us
[36:05] hey man we're just looking forward to
[36:07] all of that I have
[36:10] just a couple things that I wanted to
[36:13] read and there's a couple cards that we
[36:16] just received on one card and one letter
[36:19] that someone sent here to church and and
[36:24] I was just blessed by so just wanted to
[36:26] share with with the church because it
[36:28] was it was for the church this says dear
[36:31] brother Jack's asterick and all the
[36:33] saints I was enjoying a recording of
[36:36] brother capers when I decided it was
[36:38] time to send a note of appreciation
[36:40] I'm always blessed at a time our
[36:42] congregations fellowship together as
[36:44] well as by your spirit of truth
[36:47] Instagram my prayer is that each and
[36:50] every one of you each should ever want
[36:52] to be a family and congregation are
[36:54] healthy and body and spirit under the
[36:56] care of our precious Lord Jesus know
[36:59] that the rest of the body of Christ is
[37:02] remembering you all in Christian love
[37:05] this is from brother Taylor and sister
[37:07] Suzanne to set a mint over on the west
[37:11] coast they're just thinking about the
[37:13] times that we fellowship together and
[37:14] they just felt impressed in a sphere
[37:16] just to write a little note of
[37:17] encouragement to the church in amen
[37:20] and I wrote him back just to let him
[37:23] know we also appreciate the time of
[37:25] fellowship and Colette got to get up out
[37:28] of here because we want to be able to
[37:30] enjoy one another's presents like that
[37:32] again so a man but we are we certainly
[37:35] thank God for them and there's also
[37:37] another little note that I got from a
[37:41] sister in Georgia says dear brother Jack
[37:44] even Saints was his greetings to you all
[37:48] in the name of our Lord
[37:51] Jesus Christ my name is Sarah Tucson and
[37:54] I have been listening online via youtube
[37:57] and periscope I have been so blessed by
[38:01] the stand that you all have taken and
[38:03] your middle-of-the-road preaching I've
[38:06] seen extremes in this message that can
[38:09] handle one's walk with Christ there is a
[38:12] sweet spirit that applies with you all
[38:14] it's the Holy Spirit as I pray the Lord
[38:17] continues to bless you all and give you
[38:20] the desires of your heart as you
[38:22] diligently seek Him I am a wife and
[38:25] mother
[38:26] that above all was Christ in my home my
[38:30] husband will then I have two teenage
[38:32] boys and are trying to give them
[38:34] spiritual guidance which ultimately
[38:37] starts with us I want to thank you all
[38:40] for the uplifting and edifying services
[38:44] I am enclosing a love offering to be
[38:47] used for the piano or keyboards that you
[38:50] all are are purchasing a man and mom but
[38:54] the sisters say the scripture here about
[38:56] Jeremiah 17 and we'll just read that
[38:59] Jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8 and as
[39:03] something to encourage us to strengthen
[39:05] us and we just thank God again for
[39:08] someone thinking of us amen and watch
[39:12] the line and and I just felt impressed
[39:14] to write the letter and then to send a
[39:16] love offer and that's just something
[39:17] that we really really appreciate it
[39:20] from the Tucson family there in Georgia
[39:23] Jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8 it says
[39:28] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[39:31] Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he
[39:35] shall be as a tree planted by the waters
[39:37] and that spreadeth outer rooms by the
[39:40] river and shall not see when he cometh
[39:43] but her leaf shall be green and shall
[39:47] not be careful in the year of drought
[39:50] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[39:52] and and I tell you I think that is just
[39:55] a very appropriate scripture especially
[39:58] for this season if I you know I can go
[40:04] down a list of what I call the blessings
[40:06] of covet 19 and you know just the way
[40:10] that I've seen the hand of the Lord even
[40:13] you know
[40:14] we were at a certain point in our giving
[40:16] for the piano we just needed just a
[40:18] little bit more to make sure what's
[40:20] purchased and we wouldn't you know
[40:22] pretty much everybody's through through
[40:23] the offers that were given we purchased
[40:25] a piano through the offers that were
[40:26] given not actually taken from our
[40:28] offering but the offers that were given
[40:30] and I was just a little bit away and I
[40:32] come to church and this was in the mail
[40:34] and over the next week a man so we're
[40:53] looking forward to that
[40:54] god is good
[40:58] just one of the blesses a man of coke at
[41:02] 19 but God got so many things that he's
[41:04] doing and and you know and even you know
[41:07] like the scripture say even if it's a
[41:09] drought we still bear fruit
[41:12] I hate that powerful even in the midst
[41:15] of the drought we're still bearing fruit
[41:17] your business is bearing fruit in the
[41:20] midst of a drought right some of us are
[41:24] on our jobs they had to let everybody
[41:26] else go but they kept us for a reason
[41:28] that's because in the midst of a drought
[41:30] we're supposed to bear fruit come on
[41:32] somebody this is this is nothing but the
[41:36] handle alone we certainly think a man
[41:40] just all that he has done and all that
[41:42] he is doing praising let's give the
[41:44] announcements amen at this time and and
[41:47] then we will go forward in the service
[41:49] just we I know we have a birthday coming
[41:53] on Friday sister samaya
[41:56] they may well be celebrating birthday so
[41:58] we wish her another year on this a man
[42:07] thank God also so I know that we have
[42:15] like the government has been releasing
[42:16] people to kind of get back to work and
[42:18] all of those things that were certainly
[42:20] happy that all that is happening and
[42:22] maybe many are wondering when I get back
[42:24] they say we're certainly working on a
[42:26] plan I didn't want to just kind of rush
[42:29] back into things so I want to just just
[42:32] handle things with wisdom we're gonna
[42:33] kind of keep doing what we've been doing
[42:35] but just start seeing some slow changes
[42:38] slow changes and I'll be communicating
[42:40] to you that one one one thing that I'm
[42:43] very happy about is that I know that
[42:46] there's been some saints that actually
[42:48] had to go to the hospital because they
[42:49] felt some symptoms but those that I've
[42:52] known have been tested have all the
[42:54] tests have come back negative
[42:55] amen and I know that whether devil might
[42:58] have tried to buy him somebody with this
[43:01] [Music]
[43:02] you know got reviewed them you know for
[43:04] their sake and and and I'm just
[43:06] believing that uh we're not gonna have
[43:08] any outbreaks and we're gonna just
[43:10] continue to do what we have been doing
[43:11] to prevent that I was talking to some of
[43:14] the mothers of the church this week and
[43:16] like I just want to make sure everything
[43:17] real good y'all come on back in here
[43:20] right because we know we want them all
[43:22] back in service but we want to make sure
[43:23] it's all safe so our love I'll be
[43:25] communicating with you just letting you
[43:27] know what some of our next steps are but
[43:29] we'll start making changes over the next
[43:31] couple of weeks but for now continue to
[43:33] do the virtual service on Wednesday and
[43:37] you can watch it by periscope or via
[43:39] Facebook also no services on Friday for
[43:42] right now we'll let you know when that
[43:44] starts again and Sunday service will
[43:47] continue with our 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.
[43:49] service amen the way we have been for
[43:51] right now as we get more information

[48:02] amen on today praise the Lord Amen this
[48:07] this this morning family
[48:11] Amen that had come this morning and the
[48:15] whole family the first few weeks ago
[48:17] brother Diggs received just a husband
[48:19] and wife came and brother Leo and sister
[48:23] Tatyana a man and this dis this morn
[48:28] they brought their children the three
[48:29] kids to
[48:30] sons and a daughter I believe and and
[48:33] when they came the daughter had already
[48:35] been watching the services online she
[48:38] said she could feel the Spirit of God
[48:39] you know just just watch their life so
[48:41] she wanted to come this morning
[48:43] and she came and and she said I felt the
[48:45] presence of here again this morning and
[48:48] and one of the questions that our son
[48:51] had in his mind and he told his momma
[48:54] you know something that he had in his
[48:55] mind and right come right into the
[48:58] service and brother quake KU preached
[49:00] what he told his mama and I mean so the
[49:04] momma said I just felt that that was a
[49:06] confirmation I think we need to make
[49:07] this our church home so I thank God for
[49:11] that it's not many churches that are
[49:17] growing doing covet 19 they actually
[49:21] losing members but it is why I say that
[49:23] Scripture is very appropriate that the
[49:25] sister sent us right you know in a time
[49:28] of a drought here we're still yielding
[49:31] fruit god is good I have to get a sermon
[49:37] developed on the blessings of coke at 19
[49:40] i'ma have to develop that you know but I
[49:43] just I just seek God and everything that
[49:47] that's happened I see God and and I know
[49:49] he's at work and you know he just seems
[49:52] just moving in a mighty way and and we
[49:54] just we just want to give him all the
[49:56] glory and all the honor and all the
[49:57] praise praise the Lord let us a man
[50:00] stand to our feet we will read a
[50:03] scripture a man and and I just accent
[50:07] you or just pray for us today I want to
[50:12] kind of go back into our thought on
[50:14] rejecting the revealed word and your day
[50:17] this is part two of that sermon there's
[50:21] a lot that can be said and I just want
[50:25] the Lord just to say what he won't see a
[50:28] man today so I want to read here from
[50:31] first Kings 19 and first Kings 19 and
[50:42] I'll just start reading
[50:43] verse eight and we'll go from there
[50:47] praise the Lord man the Bible says and
[51:03] he arose and did eat and drink and drink
[51:06] and went in the strength of that meat
[51:09] forty days and forty nights unto Horeb
[51:12] the Mount of God and it came did their
[51:15] unto a cave and lodged there and behold
[51:19] the word of Lord came to him and he said
[51:22] unto Him what doest thou here Elijah a
[51:26] man what doest out here and he said I
[51:30] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[51:32] of hosts for the children of Israel half
[51:36] a sink in that covenant thrown down
[51:40] thine altars and slain that prophets
[51:42] with the sword and I even I only am left
[51:46] and they seek my life to take it away so
[51:50] here is a prophet of God running from
[51:54] you know a situation that has just
[51:56] occurred and he's on the run now that
[51:59] just that just don't seem don't seem
[52:03] right for some reason prophet of God
[52:07] we're thus sayeth the Lord running think
[52:11] about that right think about that and
[52:13] and and and and I think one of the
[52:15] things that we need to get from this
[52:17] because the scripture tells that Elijah
[52:19] was a man of light passions right so
[52:23] there are times in our life where we
[52:27] don't stand up and we don't speak the
[52:30] word we don't drive out some Devils but
[52:33] it might be some other times we take off
[52:34] running hello somebody amen and the
[52:39] reason that you need to know that that
[52:41] that happens is because the only time
[52:43] you speak the word is when the anointing
[52:46] is on you
[52:48] man it's the anointing that destroys the
[52:51] youth you don't do nothing in yourself
[52:54] you are coward man we all coward
[53:00] scaredy-cats
[53:02] without the anointing with nothing
[53:04] praise the Lord Amen hallelujah we
[53:07] depend on that anointed so so it says it
[53:10] says that he said go forth and stand
[53:13] upon the mount before the Lord and
[53:16] behold the Lord passed by and great and
[53:19] strong wind rent the mountains and break
[53:25] in pieces the rocks before the Lord but
[53:28] the Lord was not in the wind and after
[53:30] the wind an earthquake but the Lord was
[53:32] not in the earthquake and after the
[53:34] earthquake a fire but the Lord was not
[53:37] in the fire and after the fire a still
[53:40] small voice and it was so when Elijah I
[53:43] heard it they D rapped his face in his
[53:46] mantle went out stood in the entering of
[53:48] the cave and behold there came a voice
[53:51] of him saying what doest thou here
[53:54] Elijah and he said I have been very
[53:56] jealous for the Lord God of hosts
[53:59] behold because the children of Israel
[54:01] have forsaken my covenant thrown down
[54:03] mine altars and sling my prophets with a
[54:05] sword
[54:06] and I even I only am left and they seek
[54:09] my life to take it away and and the Lord
[54:11] said unto him go return on my way to the
[54:14] wilderness of Damascus now I think that
[54:17] that's very important especially the
[54:20] quote that we read to set this up God
[54:22] called his prophet to the wilderness
[54:25] right and I was I didn't get that last
[54:28] time but God called his prophet to the
[54:30] wilderness oh my let's just watch some
[54:34] of some of these things here oh god help
[54:37] us a man a man you know unless he said
[54:42] and the Lord said unto Him go return on
[54:44] our way to the wielders of damascus and
[54:47] and when thou come and said no it has he
[54:50] able to be king of Assyria and jehu the
[54:52] son of nimshi showed allan order to be
[54:54] king of israel and elisha the son of
[54:55] shaphat of abel my whole shutdown ought
[55:00] to be profit in that
[55:02] and it shall come to pass him that
[55:05] escape of the sward of has he L shall
[55:07] Jehu slaying him that escape pyth from
[55:10] the sword of Jehu shall Elijah's late
[55:12] yet I have left me seven thousand in
[55:16] Israel all the knees which have not
[55:17] bowed unto Bale in every mouth which
[55:20] have not kissed him some people don't
[55:24] want to kiss the devil praise the Lord
[55:27] thank God you got folk that ain't got
[55:29] them type of desires that want to kiss
[55:31] the devil my god all right let's pray
[55:34] father we thank you for the word of the
[55:38] Lord that has been read as we go a
[55:41] little deeper in our thought today we
[55:43] pray the Holy Spirit with take control
[55:45] of this time of the service be glorified
[55:47] and magnified in our myths speak to
[55:50] every heart not just those that are
[55:52] sitting president but those that are
[55:53] joining online bless us Lord as we
[55:56] endeavor to take upon this stone in
[55:59] Jesus name we pray amen
[56:01] play man you can be seated in the
[56:02] presence of Lord a man again we're
[56:05] looking at rejecting the revealed word
[56:09] for your day in your day this is part
[56:12] two as we talked about this and this is
[56:16] this is important to me I'm not but the
[56:20] title is not rejecting the word right
[56:23] there there's a lot of people that you
[56:26] know they don't want nothing to do with
[56:27] God or something like that I was talking
[56:29] to a man yesterday how he was just
[56:31] saying he he told some folk one time he
[56:33] I don't want to talk about Jesus I don't
[56:35] want I don't don't even talk to me about
[56:36] that I'm I'm not even interested in that
[56:39] but as God began to do with his heart
[56:41] over time he became converted you know
[56:43] and and we thank God for testimonies of
[56:46] that nature but but we're talking about
[56:48] the reveal word in your day and and and
[56:52] I want to be very clear you know that
[56:56] everybody that comes to the earth
[57:00] everybody is born for a certain time of
[57:04] a certain season God brings us here and
[57:09] we're all just like like where the quake
[57:11] was tell us we're all eternal thoughts
[57:13] of God
[57:14] that were in God's mind we were just as
[57:17] real in his mind as we are sitting here
[57:19] right now today and you know and he was
[57:23] saying how you know we are we brothers
[57:25] you know and they say you know you get
[57:27] married to one wife you stay married to
[57:29] that one wife you say now back in Davis
[57:32] Day you could have had five hundred
[57:33] wives so back in Solomon's that you
[57:35] could have had a thousand wives as long
[57:37] as you could take care of them say but
[57:38] we're not living in that day on them
[57:40] anymore so if you had a spirit like that
[57:42] you should have been born back then
[57:44] praise the Lord
[57:46] so since I mean so if you got that
[57:47] spirit I pray that God will deliver you
[57:50] from it because he wants you to stay
[57:52] married to the one that you got and be
[57:53] faithful to the one that you got praise
[57:56] the Lord Amen faithful to your vow
[57:58] alrighty man but but you know in every
[58:02] day and every time every generation has
[58:06] had an opportunity to receive the word
[58:09] for their day from the days of Adam they
[58:13] had the opportunity to receive the
[58:15] reveal word for their day hallelujah
[58:19] Amen so you know when we started off and
[58:21] just kind of showing how the the first
[58:23] scene was actually unbelief or or
[58:26] rejecting the revealed Word of God the
[58:29] Word of God said don't eat from this
[58:32] tree that was it was not a mystery and
[58:35] man it wasn't something so deep and so
[58:38] mysterious that you know that they each
[58:41] can understand it it was very clear
[58:43] don't do this amen and if you want if
[58:46] you want to live eternal if you want to
[58:48] have life
[58:48] don't do this sister then they only had
[58:51] one commandment if I could put it that
[58:54] way
[58:54] one commandment the key and he couldn't
[58:57] keep it a man Eve can keep it not only
[59:00] not only could she she could she could
[59:02] keep it by where she put took of this
[59:04] fruit then she introduced Adam to to
[59:07] this act my god my god she introduced
[59:11] Adam to the action when Adam amen the
[59:14] Bible says that he will believe did it
[59:16] amen
[59:18] not deceived Eve was too steep but Adam
[59:20] was not to see Adam out of wibbly
[59:23] dinners because he knew that God was
[59:25] gonna destroy she was gonna die wishy
[59:28] for took that so look if you're gonna
[59:29] die I love you that much that I'm gonna
[59:31] die right alongside you hallelujah
[59:34] that's the way Adam works that's the it
[59:38] was really just an expression of God
[59:40] that was actually coming out of Adam at
[59:42] the time of the fall hallelujah because
[59:44] God knew himself that he would leave his
[59:47] throne in glory and coming down across
[59:49] my people that he knew had no chance of
[59:51] living oh thank you Jesus we thank God
[59:55] for this but when we look at this they
[59:56] had the opportunity they receive the
[59:59] revealed truth for their data revealed
[1:00:01] word for the day but they made a
[1:00:02] decision they made a choice where they
[1:00:04] walked away from that even King was
[1:00:06] given an opportunity to walk in the
[1:00:09] revealed truth for his day God came to
[1:00:13] Cain himself think about that there's
[1:00:17] many people that would love to hear the
[1:00:19] voice of God just one time in their life
[1:00:22] I mean often times you know we hear
[1:00:24] God's voice through other people we hear
[1:00:26] God's voice through other things maybe
[1:00:28] listening to the radio and somebody say
[1:00:30] something on the radio you just heard
[1:00:32] divorce that God it speaks to your
[1:00:33] situation coming to church a preacher
[1:00:35] preaches something and when the preacher
[1:00:37] says some it just speaks usage which you
[1:00:39] hear the voice of God but in this
[1:00:41] particular circumstance God came himself
[1:00:44] and talked to Cain gave him the revealed
[1:00:47] truth for that day offered me this type
[1:00:51] of sacrifice Cain rejected it now you
[1:00:55] know I made a comment the spirit to
[1:01:00] reject the reveal word pass from Eve to
[1:01:05] her son King hallelujah because Cain was
[1:01:08] not Adam sir but Cain was Eve son that's
[1:01:12] why the Bible records that Eve was the
[1:01:15] mother of all living but it did not say
[1:01:18] that Adam was the father of all living
[1:01:20] Cain came from a different experience it
[1:01:24] was experienced with the sir
[1:01:26] who did walk on two feet at that time
[1:01:28] but he's been cursed since that event
[1:01:30] and now he's on his belly hallelujah
[1:01:33] glory to God but here you know I was
[1:01:36] looking at this the spirit to reject the
[1:01:39] revealed Word pass from Eve to her son
[1:01:44] Cain and and we see it clearly amen and
[1:01:48] Cain rejected the word as God came to
[1:01:50] him and said look you know if you just
[1:01:52] give me the same sacrifice that your
[1:01:55] brother Abel has given me I will accept
[1:01:57] it but if the problem was it just was
[1:02:00] not in Cain to do it I want to tell you
[1:02:04] something there are some people that
[1:02:05] you're going to be working with and
[1:02:06] working with and working with and it
[1:02:08] just might end them to accept this truth
[1:02:10] oh all right all right all right all
[1:02:14] right you got to know who you're working
[1:02:16] with and sometime when you're working
[1:02:17] with a spirit a man I don't care how
[1:02:20] much you explain and I'm gonna tell you
[1:02:23] another thing about a spirit a spirit is
[1:02:26] not even impressed by the supernatural
[1:02:32] by spirit I'm a share with you I we read
[1:02:38] the scripture of Elijah being in a cave
[1:02:42] what do is out here Elijah the reason he
[1:02:45] lives is in this cave is because a few I
[1:02:48] mean a chapter before allowed to just
[1:02:50] call down fire from heaven destroyed
[1:02:54] amen mother mother
[1:02:56] I mean here God come down and consume
[1:02:58] the altar but then a lie to destroy them
[1:03:01] false prophets hallelujah now the people
[1:03:04] are greed that's a god that answers by
[1:03:07] fire we don't let him be God they agreed
[1:03:11] to it but here after this Brady bear
[1:03:14] yeah he had was there and he's so fire
[1:03:17] come down to consume the altar
[1:03:19] then he sorry logic take them
[1:03:21] down there and sling every one of them
[1:03:23] give this false teaching out of Amen
[1:03:25] from amongst the people he stopped these
[1:03:28] prophets by himself but he late half
[1:03:32] went home and he told his wife Jezebel
[1:03:34] what just happened and you know what
[1:03:36] happened Jezebel say you know what by
[1:03:40] this time tomorrow I'm my half he lied
[1:03:43] his head and so he went from being
[1:03:46] totally anointed and slaying foe hundred
[1:03:51] or something like that all these
[1:03:53] prophets are running from one woman
[1:03:56] think about that and didn't even try to
[1:03:59] stand up to it took off running ended up
[1:04:02] in a cave but but here's what we find
[1:04:04] out that mighty move of the Spirit the
[1:04:09] supernatural come down that people still
[1:04:11] did not change Oh hallelujah I want you
[1:04:16] to understand that it's got to be more
[1:04:18] than a supernatural that get people's
[1:04:21] attention today there's got to be
[1:04:22] something on the inside that can
[1:04:25] identify with God they had to come from
[1:04:28] God and got to be going back to God
[1:04:30] that's why I say look how when we look
[1:04:32] over church we're not just looking for
[1:04:33] any church I'm looking for people that
[1:04:35] came from God and only way back to God
[1:04:38] Oh hallelujah a man a man I don't want
[1:04:42] to just settle in any Church amen people
[1:04:45] that know who they are in Christ that's
[1:04:48] who I want to fellowship with amen
[1:04:51] so now you know let's look at a couple
[1:04:52] things here I want to just take a little
[1:04:55] time and and read a little bit I brought
[1:04:59] I brought out this point the spirit to
[1:05:03] reject the revealed Word past from Eve
[1:05:07] to her son Cain and we see it clearly in
[1:05:11] Cain rejecting the word but I want to
[1:05:13] bring in another script if I can because
[1:05:17] that spirit to reject the word people of
[1:05:20] every age gets an opportunity to receive
[1:05:23] the word now
[1:05:25] talk about a man Noah's day they had an
[1:05:28] opportunity to receive the reveal word
[1:05:31] right and Moses day applying the blood
[1:05:33] they had the opportunity to receive the
[1:05:36] reveal word in John the Baptist day they
[1:05:38] had the opportunity amen to receive the
[1:05:40] revealed word as was coming through John
[1:05:43] the Baptist in Paul's day they had the
[1:05:45] opportunity to receive to receive the
[1:05:47] reviewer an Iranian and Martin and
[1:05:50] Columbo Luther Wesley all the way down
[1:05:53] to this day people have the opportunity
[1:05:56] to receive the reveal word as is coming
[1:05:59] through the person that God selected to
[1:06:02] reveal it through now look at this look
[1:06:04] at this we want to kind of go back to
[1:06:07] the days of Jesus because they rejected
[1:06:10] the word and Jesus thing now I want to I
[1:06:13] want to read a quote here praise the
[1:06:18] Lord
[1:06:19] actually I want to read a scripture
[1:06:21] let's go to Matthew 27 Matthew 27 now
[1:06:29] this verse that the verses that I'm
[1:06:31] reading brother branham you know in the
[1:06:35] 70 weeks of Daniel he he refers to this
[1:06:38] this portion of Scripture as a most
[1:06:41] vital sin from the children of Israel
[1:06:45] this was a very vital sin that they
[1:06:50] committed here when they rejected the
[1:06:53] word glory to God this was very vital
[1:06:56] glory hallelujah my a man there's much
[1:07:00] that could be sent there because you
[1:07:02] would think that it was so vital that
[1:07:04] they wouldn't have an opportunity to
[1:07:07] come back around and accept truth but
[1:07:09] you know actually they're there their
[1:07:11] eyes were closed intentionally by God so
[1:07:15] that we could actually accept truth
[1:07:17] ain't man Laurie to God but I want to
[1:07:19] tell you that you know at the same way
[1:07:22] the gospel begin to move away from the
[1:07:27] the children of Israel and now it's come
[1:07:29] to the Gentiles well there's all
[1:07:32] gonna be another switch where it's gonna
[1:07:33] move from the Gentiles and then go right
[1:07:36] back to the Jews and they're gonna
[1:07:38] recognize who Christ is and I want to
[1:07:40] tell you that we're living in that time
[1:07:42] right now right now right now now look
[1:07:45] at this Matthew 27 let's start at verse
[1:07:48] of 15 praise the Lord this was a very
[1:07:52] vital move in Israel's history a man
[1:07:56] they were rejecting the reveal worked
[1:08:00] for their day now now the feast the
[1:08:05] governor was want to release unto the
[1:08:07] people a prisoner whom they would and
[1:08:09] they had then a notable prisoner called
[1:08:13] Barabbas therefore when they were
[1:08:15] gathered together Pilate said unto them
[1:08:18] whom will you that I release them to you
[1:08:21] Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ
[1:08:24] a man and and now I was told this that
[1:08:30] you know Barabbas other name his full
[1:08:33] name was Jesus Barabbas right Jesus
[1:08:36] Barabbas and Jesus the Christ amen so
[1:08:39] when they select Jesus Barabbas they
[1:08:42] actually chose the wrong Jesus they took
[1:08:45] the wrong Jesus amen and I want to tell
[1:08:49] you that there's many in denominational
[1:08:52] churches today taking the wrong Jesus Oh
[1:08:56] glory to God a man you got to be able to
[1:08:59] see that he's the same yesterday today
[1:09:01] and forever
[1:09:02] don't take the Jesus of history take the
[1:09:05] Jesus that's living improving himself
[1:09:07] even right now hallelujah amen look at
[1:09:12] this he says verse 18 for he knew that
[1:09:16] for envy they had delivered him glory
[1:09:19] and it goes on says when he was sat down
[1:09:22] on the judgment seat his wife sent unto
[1:09:25] him saying have thou nothing to do with
[1:09:27] that just man for I had stuff of many
[1:09:30] things this day in a dream because of
[1:09:32] him
[1:09:33] now here God have to use the leaders why
[1:09:36] to give her dream and try to warn him
[1:09:38] and he's not even coming to these people
[1:09:40] he's coming to the Jews and they're
[1:09:42] rejecting him now look it goes so say by
[1:09:45] the chief priests amen and eldest butts
[1:09:48] weighted the multitude that they should
[1:09:50] ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus oh god I
[1:09:54] told you it comes from the church a man
[1:09:56] it comes from the pulpit the deception
[1:09:58] comes from the pulpit what says the
[1:10:00] governor answered and said unto them
[1:10:03] whether of the tween will you will you
[1:10:07] that I release them to you they said
[1:10:09] Barabbas Pilate said unto them what
[1:10:13] shall I do then with Jesus which is
[1:10:15] called Christ they all say it to him let
[1:10:18] him be crucified now it goes on and the
[1:10:22] governor set of Why What evil hath he
[1:10:25] done but they cried out the more saying
[1:10:27] let him be crucified when Pilate saw
[1:10:30] that he could prevail nothing but that
[1:10:34] River till tomorrow was made he took
[1:10:36] water and washed his hands before the
[1:10:38] multitude saying I'm innocent of the
[1:10:40] blood of this just person see to it then
[1:10:43] answered all the people and said his
[1:10:45] blood be on us and on our children now
[1:10:48] brother Branham tells us that you know
[1:10:50] this was a prophecy that they kind of
[1:10:53] brought upon themselves and from that
[1:10:55] time when they made that Proclamation
[1:10:57] they meant all the way down to even
[1:11:00] today where the Jewish people I mean
[1:11:02] people come against them for no reason
[1:11:04] at all but it's because of their
[1:11:06] rejection of Christ that they rejected
[1:11:09] the revealed word for their day and it
[1:11:11] produced problems if I could put it this
[1:11:13] way a plague setting in a plague setting
[1:11:17] in a play death set in even from what
[1:11:20] happened with the Holocaust amen and all
[1:11:24] I ever play is let his blood be on us
[1:11:26] and upon our children but there's coming
[1:11:28] today where he will reveal himself to
[1:11:30] his people again glory to God now why
[1:11:33] why did the people get to a spot like
[1:11:36] this why what brought them to this place
[1:11:39] where you know they wanna they wanna
[1:11:41] kill or crucify the word but what is it
[1:11:46] what does this
[1:11:48] people you know even even to this day oh
[1:11:51] you know I recently I'm just reading a
[1:11:54] little article amen and the fellow was
[1:11:58] just talking about how certain things go
[1:12:00] on in message churches and and he took
[1:12:02] this big took some information - you
[1:12:04] know a news article in the news news
[1:12:07] people say y'all need to watch them
[1:12:08] people that follow William branham's
[1:12:10] teaching now - stuff that is right in
[1:12:12] the article we don't support that we
[1:12:14] don't agree with that if somebody
[1:12:16] commits in amen that sin need to be
[1:12:19] dealt with praise the Lord we don't we
[1:12:22] just don't promote seeing around here
[1:12:24] Amen but somebody got into a little
[1:12:26] something and it made maybe it was abuse
[1:12:28] or something like that and they say how
[1:12:30] the preacher was a promoting he said nah
[1:12:32] we don't promote that around here amen
[1:12:35] glory to God you know I found is that a
[1:12:39] lot of people that have turned from the
[1:12:41] messages because somewhere somehow they
[1:12:44] were hurt they were hurt by something
[1:12:48] amen and through that hurt they were not
[1:12:51] able to overcome it so they begin to
[1:12:53] turn and they say the message is wrong
[1:12:55] because of some hurt amen hey maybe your
[1:12:58] daddy treated your wrong that don't mean
[1:13:00] the message wrong maybe your mama
[1:13:01] treated you wrong that don't mean the
[1:13:03] message wrong hallelujah maybe even your
[1:13:05] pastor treated you wrong that don't mean
[1:13:08] the message is wrong how you got to be
[1:13:12] able to overcome those that even jesus
[1:13:15] said in this world we will have offenses
[1:13:19] glory to God but you know these people
[1:13:23] amen it wasn't it really was the people
[1:13:26] the people were blessed but they were
[1:13:28] under the influence of the leadership of
[1:13:30] that day the leadership have been hurt
[1:13:34] can I put it that way the leadership of
[1:13:38] that day what's hurt where did they get
[1:13:41] hurt where did they get hurt let's look
[1:13:44] at this Pharisees and Sadducees they got
[1:13:47] hurt let's look at a couple scriptures
[1:13:49] or y'all just bear with me here oh my
[1:13:51] let's go to John 8 and man John 8
[1:13:57] hallelujah these people were hurt
[1:14:00] lower to God and through this hurt they
[1:14:03] just had this ministry to go against the
[1:14:08] reveal word for that day they they were
[1:14:10] hurt I mean man something rubbed them
[1:14:13] the wrong way glory to God and and and
[1:14:17] then I ain't gonna sit down and take it
[1:14:19] like that praise the Lord that this is
[1:14:21] what this is what's really underneath
[1:14:23] this now now watch this I mean if I went
[1:14:26] back to even Jezebel she was hurt
[1:14:29] how preachers were dead now don't forget
[1:14:32] she had already been killing the other
[1:14:34] prophets God's prophets now our hope
[1:14:37] bricks is dead she came take it I'm
[1:14:39] gonna get I'm gonna get Elijah but God
[1:14:41] had a calling larger into the wilderness
[1:14:43] Lord if I can just get around to that I
[1:14:46] pray God I helped me to get around
[1:14:48] oh my mind lord help me I mean let me go
[1:14:52] with look let's look at this hurt here
[1:14:54] for a second
[1:14:54] Johnny that let's look at verse 36 and
[1:14:58] it says this if the son therefore shall
[1:15:01] make you free ye shall be free indeed I
[1:15:05] know that ye are Abraham's seat but you
[1:15:09] seem to kill me because my word has no
[1:15:11] place in you oh man look at this since I
[1:15:15] speak that which I have seen with my
[1:15:19] father and you do that which you have
[1:15:22] seen with your father now
[1:15:28] let's watch this let's watch this real
[1:15:30] close amen it says they answered and
[1:15:34] said unto him Abraham is our Father
[1:15:38] jesus said unto them anywhere Abraham's
[1:15:42] children ye would do the works of
[1:15:45] Abraham O Lord Jesus god help us you
[1:15:50] would do the works of Abraham amen
[1:15:52] verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a
[1:15:58] man that hath told you the truth which I
[1:16:02] have heard of God this did not Abraham
[1:16:04] he says you do the deeds of your father
[1:16:07] now see this this is
[1:16:09] with them because they can they can
[1:16:11] trace the genealogies they can trace the
[1:16:15] lineages they know that Abraham was
[1:16:17] their father but watch but Jesus speaks
[1:16:20] to these men I say out of hurt Oh glory
[1:16:24] to God out of hurt they begin to put
[1:16:28] persuade and dissuade the people to turn
[1:16:31] on Christ
[1:16:32] I never heard people begin to turn
[1:16:35] against the revealed word for then think
[1:16:37] it's out of hurt that we do this what
[1:16:41] God wants to heal everywhere hurt
[1:16:44] Oh God can God can heal it look at this
[1:16:48] look at this let's keep going since ye
[1:16:51] do the deeds of your father then said
[1:16:53] they to him we were not born of
[1:16:56] fornication
[1:16:57] now they tryna you know nothing another
[1:17:00] late night night night and now they talk
[1:17:01] about Jesus birth right I mean we
[1:17:03] weren't born like he was born we can
[1:17:05] trace our lineage and this story that
[1:17:08] you don't come up with you know that a
[1:17:10] virgin shall conceive we still waiting
[1:17:12] on that to be manifested they couldn't
[1:17:15] see that it was already manifested in
[1:17:18] the man Christ Jesus hallelujah they
[1:17:23] couldn't see that was medicine we be not
[1:17:26] born of fornication look at it look at
[1:17:30] it Amen we have one father even God it
[1:17:36] goes on and said jesus said in him if
[1:17:38] God were your father hallelujah see I
[1:17:43] believe the miracles that he performed
[1:17:47] gave him the ability to have a voice in
[1:17:50] the midst of this congregation
[1:17:52] hallelujah
[1:17:54] it was the supernatural that actually
[1:17:56] gave him a voice it's the supernatural
[1:17:59] today that would give us a voice to
[1:18:01] speak what we're speaking all right stay
[1:18:04] with me Church look at this he says yes
[1:18:09] Jesus amen if God were your father he
[1:18:12] will love me for I proceeded forth and
[1:18:14] came from God neither came out of myself
[1:18:17] but he sent me why do
[1:18:21] not understand my speech look at this
[1:18:24] even because you cannot hear my words
[1:18:27] ye are your father now you kept seven
[1:18:32] know you know get your father's a little
[1:18:34] different from my father now look at
[1:18:36] what it say in any night because I'm
[1:18:38] claiming that I'm coming from God you
[1:18:39] say you coming from a man you said oh
[1:18:41] but ye are of your father the devil I
[1:18:44] like that statement because the spirit
[1:18:51] to reject the revealed Word pass from
[1:18:54] Eve to us son King
[1:18:57] we saw it clearly in Kay rejecting word
[1:19:00] but now the spirit that was in King to
[1:19:03] reject the revealed Word of God was also
[1:19:05] found in the religious leaders during
[1:19:09] the days of Jesus so if it was found
[1:19:12] amongst the religious leaders in the
[1:19:14] days of Jesus where you think is gonna
[1:19:16] be found today hallelujah we on the
[1:19:21] trail of a devil praise God and this
[1:19:24] down we'll get started through hurt Oh
[1:19:28] search I hope you with me if you talk to
[1:19:32] people long enough you'll find out there
[1:19:34] was some hot damn a man we don't see
[1:19:39] these signs of seasoned and Pharisees
[1:19:42] man with long robes and for lack Theresa
[1:19:45] and they were respected amongst the
[1:19:47] people but now you've got somebody
[1:19:49] coming and calling back not only that
[1:19:52] telling you of your father the devil
[1:19:56] look at that you have your father -
[1:19:58] devil and the end and the lusts of your
[1:20:01] father ye will do and he was a he was a
[1:20:04] murderer from the beginning and abode
[1:20:07] not in the truth because there is no
[1:20:09] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:20:12] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:20:15] the father of it your lives your dad is
[1:20:19] a liar
[1:20:20] Oh - hurt somebody man I can prove my
[1:20:25] lineage and you tell me I come from the
[1:20:28] devil well watch your
[1:20:30] your actions prove who your daddy is
[1:20:34] because it was the religious leaders
[1:20:37] that came up apply tell that tell the
[1:20:40] governor you want Barabbas but crucify
[1:20:43] tell Jesus it showed it showed that they
[1:20:47] came from their father the devil how did
[1:20:51] they get there to hurt how people come
[1:20:55] to a spot of rejecting the word today
[1:20:57] her hallelujah and and that's that's the
[1:21:02] thing that's why I'm bringing out the
[1:21:04] children of Israel here in this and this
[1:21:05] was a vital thing that they did but the
[1:21:07] grace of God is going right back to them
[1:21:09] this is just like if I could put it this
[1:21:11] way like a play that's being played out
[1:21:12] but it's the grace of God has gone right
[1:21:15] back to them to get them so there are
[1:21:16] some people I believe today that's been
[1:21:18] hurt that God's still gonna go right
[1:21:20] back around and bring him right back in
[1:21:22] I say the mysterious hands of Jehovah
[1:21:28] well untie the knots and it'll settle
[1:21:32] people's spirit glory I'm gonna tell you
[1:21:35] some if that's what it's gonna take
[1:21:37] it's a supernatural not gonna settle
[1:21:39] them because I've heard people say I
[1:21:40] remember I remember you know some people
[1:21:42] said man ain't no supernatural things
[1:21:44] happening in the message none none none
[1:21:46] and then a they was leaving over that
[1:21:49] and then God gave us powerful
[1:21:53] demonstration of the supernatural when
[1:21:55] we saw the picture in sister Tonya's
[1:21:58] head of this growth a picture before and
[1:22:02] after here the picture in a hat showed
[1:22:04] the growth and then right after I mean
[1:22:06] after the prayer going to brother
[1:22:08] Nathan's Church up there and and a new
[1:22:11] Alvin E and we had Church and just
[1:22:12] prayed a simple prayer went came back
[1:22:14] home on an airplane get ready to go for
[1:22:16] a surgery all the twos that we come on
[1:22:18] Monday she going for surgery on a
[1:22:20] Tuesday and when she wake up it's not
[1:22:22] there don't even and took a picture
[1:22:24] before and after that was God's
[1:22:26] supernatural hand touching her before
[1:22:29] the doctor could touch her
[1:22:30] and we begin to share the testimony did
[1:22:33] it stop the people from going to do what
[1:22:34] they were doing they were complaining it
[1:22:36] was no supernatural their God did the
[1:22:39] supernatural and it still didn't turn
[1:22:40] around oh it's just like what happened
[1:22:43] with Elijah just like what happened in
[1:22:47] Elijah's day but I believe God is able
[1:22:48] to turn them back around I believe that
[1:22:50] it's gonna take more than that we don't
[1:22:52] have to have a identification of who we
[1:22:54] are in Christ now let me uh let me just
[1:22:58] read a little something here if I can oh
[1:23:02] my goodness hurt did this hurt hurt hurt
[1:23:05] that's a--that's a-- let's not read from
[1:23:08] this message the god of this evil age
[1:23:10] the god of this evil age let's read from
[1:23:13] there praise God
[1:23:15] oh thank you lord a man says now we see
[1:23:19] that the church refused to accept God's
[1:23:23] Word to rule over them and accept it
[1:23:27] Barabbas instead now if you want the
[1:23:29] scripture on that it's Matthew 27 15 to
[1:23:32] 23 what did this do what position did
[1:23:35] this do now think of it when the church
[1:23:38] world in its organized life of righteous
[1:23:41] holy men as they thought they were and
[1:23:45] we're in the eyes of the people they
[1:23:47] crucified Jesus and saying will not have
[1:23:51] this man rule over us it says will not
[1:23:55] have this word of God to rule over us
[1:24:00] and if I could just inject that will
[1:24:02] leave that quote there for a second
[1:24:03] there's many people the reason they
[1:24:05] actually leave the message because they
[1:24:06] don't want the word to rule over them
[1:24:09] they call themselves actually having
[1:24:11] freedom you can't get liberated from the
[1:24:15] gospel hallelujah amen amen the gospel
[1:24:20] it's the gospel itself that actually
[1:24:21] gives you freedom but to turn and walk
[1:24:24] away from the gospel and reject become
[1:24:27] of God that's not liberation that's
[1:24:30] bondage
[1:24:31] praise God it's only when you come to
[1:24:34] know Jesus
[1:24:35] that's your no freedom ye shall know
[1:24:37] that truth and the truth will make you
[1:24:39] free
[1:24:40] look at this glory since says I wouldn't
[1:24:46] I have this man rule rule of us and
[1:24:48] Jesus was the fullness of the Word of
[1:24:50] God first John 1 expresses it and they
[1:24:53] said we're blinded to what he wants I'm
[1:24:57] sorry and they said wouldn't I have this
[1:24:59] Word of God rule over us yet he was the
[1:25:01] word but their eyes were blinded to what
[1:25:03] he was for he was the direct answer to
[1:25:07] every prophecy that was to come to pass
[1:25:10] in him now we all believe that because
[1:25:14] we're looking back to see it happen but
[1:25:17] if the world would that is now this
[1:25:20] present evil age that would have been
[1:25:23] back there at that time they would do
[1:25:26] the same thing they're doing today
[1:25:28] because it's still the same word for
[1:25:30] this age being manifested so so really
[1:25:34] you know we can look at the history of
[1:25:36] Scripture we'll say man I would have
[1:25:37] been standing up for Jesus I would have
[1:25:40] been I bet I would have been on his side
[1:25:41] but you know your actions today actually
[1:25:45] demonstrate what you would have done
[1:25:47] even in that day if you rejected it for
[1:25:52] this day you were to reject it it back
[1:25:54] then you had been right with the crowd
[1:25:56] yeah crucified even even Pilate yelling
[1:26:01] now what has he done
[1:26:03] they couldn't a man that was not even
[1:26:05] said to Pilate his he came to his own
[1:26:07] they rejected him his own received him
[1:26:10] not
[1:26:10] I mean here to hear that the gospel was
[1:26:12] been brought to the Gentiles through a
[1:26:14] prophet in this day came to his own they
[1:26:17] rejected him hallelujah God called them
[1:26:19] off the scene let's look at this let's
[1:26:22] look at this it says he'll do it they
[1:26:25] can do nothing else they are children of
[1:26:27] disobedience give it a strong deliver
[1:26:29] delusion to believe a lie and be damned
[1:26:31] by now let's keep going
[1:26:32] notice when the church world would not
[1:26:35] accept
[1:26:36] Jesus the word manifested of that day
[1:26:40] because why they had it interpreted
[1:26:43] another way but they ought to have note
[1:26:45] that he was the word because everything
[1:26:48] that God said he would do he did it and
[1:26:50] he said to them search the Scriptures
[1:26:53] for this hour and if I do not meet the
[1:26:55] qualifications that was spoke for me to
[1:26:58] do then don't believe me they said we
[1:27:00] believe Moses he says if you would have
[1:27:03] believed Moses you would have believed
[1:27:05] me can I just borrow the words of Jesus
[1:27:08] and bring it right back to the day if
[1:27:10] you really believed Moses you would have
[1:27:13] believed brother Branham oh come on
[1:27:15] somebody if you really believe John the
[1:27:18] Baptist you want to believe brother
[1:27:20] Branham if you believe Daniel you want
[1:27:24] to believe brother pram if you believe I
[1:27:27] see you and Jeremiah and all the
[1:27:30] prophets of the Old Testament you want
[1:27:32] to believe God sitting you William
[1:27:34] Marion Branham hallelujah glory to God
[1:27:39] amen Church we were in a vision this is
[1:27:43] a year of vision and as I'm trying to
[1:27:46] bring out certain quotes so we can see
[1:27:48] where we stand
[1:27:49] you know glory to God don't don't reject
[1:27:51] the word in this thing you the word that
[1:27:53] God sent you let me just finish this
[1:27:55] quote the word that God sent you you can
[1:27:57] search it in scripture you can search
[1:28:00] the description I don't believe this
[1:28:01] message just because I found it in
[1:28:05] scripture hallelujah Malachi 4 speaks
[1:28:09] about a revelation 10 speaks about it
[1:28:11] st. 1:17 speaks about a revelation 3
[1:28:14] speaks about it's all over the scripture
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:18] look at this look at this he said if you
[1:28:22] if you wouldn't believe Moses you want
[1:28:24] to believe me
[1:28:25] for Moses spoke of me and still they
[1:28:28] didn't see it
[1:28:28] oh yeah and I can tell you Moses spoke
[1:28:32] of brother branham's ministry Moses say
[1:28:35] the Lord your God raised a prophet like
[1:28:37] unto me yes that applied to Jesus yes
[1:28:41] but scripture has compound
[1:28:44] dual meanings glory to God and you were
[1:28:47] to believe Moses you would have believed
[1:28:49] William Marion Brandon oh let me go on a
[1:28:53] little further it says the very God of
[1:28:55] heaven died on the cross I'm sorry sir
[1:28:58] and he said if you were to believe Moses
[1:29:00] you would have believed me for Moses
[1:29:01] spoke of me and they still didn't see
[1:29:03] the very God of heaven died on the cross
[1:29:06] and staying the same words the Prophet
[1:29:08] said he was saying and still they didn't
[1:29:10] see it see they were not of his kind
[1:29:15] this is important they were not of his
[1:29:19] kind they were not the word so so when
[1:29:24] we talk about of his kind we're not
[1:29:26] talking about a we're not talking about
[1:29:30] a particular race or ethnic background
[1:29:33] hallelujah we've gone beyond your ethnic
[1:29:36] background here at Spirit of Truth
[1:29:38] Tabernacle glory to God we passed that I
[1:29:42] mean other church is going to stop at
[1:29:43] your ethnicity
[1:29:45] remember we want to go we want to go
[1:29:46] past your ethnicity we want to see amen
[1:29:49] can you identify with this the operative
[1:29:52] that the brother was talking about this
[1:29:53] morning we're just be I mean if you got
[1:29:56] a theophany had to come from God and it
[1:29:59] must go back to God so we don't that's
[1:30:01] what we talk about it's not I mean your
[1:30:03] age is just the color of our skin it's
[1:30:06] just what God chose to avail he made his
[1:30:09] sign in but then God never do it who we
[1:30:11] are the reason that we can fellowship
[1:30:14] with one another and not have no isms
[1:30:16] amongst us it's because we know where we
[1:30:18] come from they were not of his kind they
[1:30:23] were not the word you have to have a
[1:30:25] word body a theophany
[1:30:27] there was not the word not the word and
[1:30:30] they and they yet they were very
[1:30:32] religious but they was not the word it
[1:30:36] would have recognized its place but at
[1:30:39] our if they were the word they would
[1:30:42] have recognized their place for the hour
[1:30:44] can I put it this way if you are the
[1:30:46] word today
[1:30:47] then you're gonna recognize your place
[1:30:49] for the hour in which you live

[1:36:04] nothing else glory to God only you got
[1:36:09] the words we eternal life Jesus a well
[1:36:11] appreciate that Peter but you know what
[1:36:13] there still are Devils and I miss

[1:36:17] demo right here in our myths glory to
[1:36:19] God tonight he trying to figure out of
[1:36:22] 12 who the devil amen
[1:36:25] he didn't even reveal it thank God for
[1:36:27] that I want to just read another little
[1:36:29] quote here this is out of the harvest
[1:36:32] time
[1:36:32] Amen these are things that caused him to
[1:36:35] reject the word they was just hurt they
[1:36:37] feelings got hurt by the word they got
[1:36:39] hurt and and-and-and-and-and if the word
[1:36:41] is hurting your feelings you got to
[1:36:44] check yourself the word should hurt you
[1:36:47] the word should help you all right look
[1:36:51] at this the harvest time he says this
[1:36:53] and all these other things he had began
[1:36:56] to say except you eat the flesh of the
[1:37:01] Son of Man what do you think a doctor
[1:37:03] would have thought sitting in there what
[1:37:05] do you think any man would just common
[1:37:08] thinking you have to eat my flesh and
[1:37:10] drink my blood they said this man is a
[1:37:12] Empire not a minister stay away from
[1:37:15] that man he is a crazy stay away from
[1:37:17] him but it was a truth see it was the
[1:37:20] truth except you eat it you'll perish
[1:37:23] you you'll all die if you don't eat it
[1:37:26] that's the same thing today the bread
[1:37:29] and the wine is only a symbol so when
[1:37:32] Jesus was saying eat my flesh and drink
[1:37:34] my blood he was talking in a symbol form
[1:37:36] the the unconverted mind would have
[1:37:39] thought he was a vampire something but
[1:37:41] but but if you had a spiritual reality
[1:37:43] if you came from God you realize it was
[1:37:45] something spiritual that was being
[1:37:47] saying look at it that's the same thing
[1:37:49] the bread and the wine is only a symbol
[1:37:51] don't let that natural thing get you
[1:37:54] down you've got to eat Christ which is
[1:37:57] the word that you live by every word
[1:38:00] that proceedeth the whole Bible from
[1:38:02] Genesis to Revelation
[1:38:04] so when you say eating my flesh and
[1:38:06] drink my blood he said and I'm the bread
[1:38:08] of life he was how he has something to
[1:38:10] sustain the people he said man shall not
[1:38:13] live by bread alone with you something
[1:38:15] that sustains but by every word that
[1:38:18] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:38:20] what you're supposed to eat is the
[1:38:23] revealed word in your day if you want to
[1:38:29] live you're gonna have to eat this
[1:38:31] revealed word I thank God for this I
[1:38:35] thank God for this now let's let's let's
[1:38:38] look at a another little something here
[1:38:41] this is out of the message divorce of
[1:38:43] the sign let me see let me see let me
[1:38:47] see let me see
[1:38:47] oh thank you Jesus no actually let's
[1:38:51] let's not go there
[1:38:52] let me let me go back to our pergamene
[1:38:55] church age and just kind of read a
[1:38:57] couple quotes from here this is where
[1:39:00] we've been getting our thought we have
[1:39:01] been in this journey of stepping to the
[1:39:03] vision and just used in different
[1:39:06] continents from the Angels message to us
[1:39:11] they told a prophet that picked up your
[1:39:13] pen and write brother Branham picked up
[1:39:15] his pen and wrote a message for us and
[1:39:17] I'm picking up this and just trying to
[1:39:18] bring it to the church so we can step
[1:39:20] into this vision that God got for us
[1:39:22] a man in this year glory God now look at
[1:39:26] i'ma start here at paragraph yeah that's
[1:39:29] good
[1:39:29] it says it says now let us stand like
[1:39:37] Joshua and Caleb because I promised land
[1:39:40] is coming in sight even as theirs did
[1:39:44] now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he
[1:39:46] represents the end time leader that will
[1:39:48] come to the church even as Paul came as
[1:39:51] the original leader
[1:39:52] Caleb represents those that stayed true
[1:39:54] with Joshua so that's us he's talking
[1:39:56] about us now
[1:39:57] you know weirder Caleb's that stand true
[1:39:58] with the Joshua that came in this day
[1:40:01] amen remember God has started Israel as
[1:40:04] a virgin with this word but they wanted
[1:40:06] something different so did the last day
[1:40:09] church notice how God did not move
[1:40:12] Israel I can tell you one of the things
[1:40:13] that some people want when they leave
[1:40:15] the message they want a title any man
[1:40:17] you never recognized me as this is that
[1:40:22] is that what it took to keep you the
[1:40:23] message let's just write this down sheet
[1:40:25] of paper what title you want
[1:40:26] well we'll hang it in your car a man
[1:40:29] will hang it at your house you are you
[1:40:32] are who you want to be will make you
[1:40:34] that baby
[1:40:35] what good is it if man make you that and
[1:40:37] God has not made you that that's all it
[1:40:42] is it's a title
[1:40:43] you ain't no actions to it I mean
[1:40:46] somebody claimed the beat an apostille
[1:40:49] you do you realize what an apostille is
[1:40:53] but they want that title right here Oh
[1:40:55] bishop apostille you know whatever the
[1:40:58] title that somebody and I pastas person
[1:41:01] that establishes churches and then
[1:41:03] leaves and goes establish another church
[1:41:06] they moved from city to city state to
[1:41:09] state country to country establishing
[1:41:12] churches doc that is a real apostille
[1:41:14] you ain't starting one church but you
[1:41:20] want us to call you a pasta not me your
[1:41:24] identity denominations Dickie that title
[1:41:26] if that's what you looking for there
[1:41:28] give it to you hallelujah but when I
[1:41:30] call you when I talk to you just know
[1:41:32] what I'm gonna call you brother
[1:41:36] alright alright let me keep on going I'm
[1:41:39] Amen brother and sister that's what you
[1:41:42] are
[1:41:42] glory to God no one is how God did not
[1:41:47] move Israel or let her go into the
[1:41:49] Promised Land until it was his on the
[1:41:51] point in time now the people might have
[1:41:53] put pressure on Joshua the leader and
[1:41:55] said the land is ours let's go and take
[1:41:57] it
[1:41:57] Joshua all through you must have lost
[1:41:59] your commission you don't have the power
[1:42:01] you used to have do you see here from
[1:42:03] God and know the will of God an act
[1:42:05] quickly something that's wrong with you
[1:42:06] but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he
[1:42:10] knew the promises of God so he waited
[1:42:12] for them this is a problem with a lot of
[1:42:15] people they just man they they they they
[1:42:18] ready to move but no no no no no wait
[1:42:19] you got to wait you got to wait why are
[1:42:21] you waiting God is forming your
[1:42:22] character right since he waited for a
[1:42:25] clear-cut decision from God and when the
[1:42:28] time came to move God placed a full
[1:42:30] leadership in Joshua's hand because he
[1:42:32] had stayed with the word God can trust
[1:42:34] Joshua but not the others so it will
[1:42:37] repeat in this day the same problem the
[1:42:39] same precious take the example we see in
[1:42:41] Moses this mighty anointed prophet of
[1:42:44] God had a peculiar birth being born at
[1:42:47] the right time brother Branham also had
[1:42:48] a peculiar birth you had a peculiar
[1:42:50] birth right since being born a man at
[1:42:53] the right time for the deliverance of
[1:42:54] Abraham C from Egypt he never stayed in
[1:42:58] Egypt to argue Scripture with them no
[1:43:00] fuss at the priest he went to the
[1:43:02] wilderness until the people were ready
[1:43:04] to receive him God called Moses to the
[1:43:06] wilderness the waiting was not on Moses
[1:43:09] part a man but because the people of the
[1:43:14] because of the people who were not ready
[1:43:16] to receive him Moses thought the people
[1:43:18] to understand but they did not look at
[1:43:19] this
[1:43:20] then there's Elijah to whom the word of
[1:43:25] the Lord came and this is the angel
[1:43:27] writing this to us - angel telling this
[1:43:29] to us through a brother branham being
[1:43:31] the scribe he says then there's Elijah
[1:43:33] to whom the word of the Lord came when
[1:43:35] he got through preaching the truth and
[1:43:38] that group back there that is the
[1:43:41] forerunner of the American Jezebel
[1:43:44] would not receive the word God called
[1:43:47] him off the field and plague that
[1:43:49] generation for rejecting the prophet and
[1:43:52] the message that God had given God
[1:43:56] called him to the wilderness and he
[1:43:57] would not even he would not come out
[1:44:01] even for the king those who try to
[1:44:03] persuade him to do so dot but God spoke
[1:44:06] to his faithful prophet by vision out of
[1:44:09] height and he came and brought back the
[1:44:13] word to Israel now we want to stop there
[1:44:16] in this because here he got got cause
[1:44:19] Elijah to the wilderness I need to just
[1:44:22] show you a couple of things you know you
[1:44:24] don't move until God actually moves you
[1:44:26] you know you don't do anything unless
[1:44:28] God does it Elijah was a major profit
[1:44:35] the spirit of Elijah's actually being
[1:44:37] used five times in Scripture in the
[1:44:40] North Channel that was only larger comes
[1:44:43] five times it came in Elijah it came on
[1:44:46] he like show it came on John the Baptist
[1:44:48] and came on William Branham and it's
[1:44:50] coming back on Elijah again as a witness
[1:44:53] to Israel the two witnesses will be
[1:44:55] Moses and Elijah not Obama does not say
[1:44:58] Moses and Elijah but the reason and I
[1:45:00] can say that is because in the Bible it
[1:45:03] gives their ministries hallelujah when
[1:45:06] you read about them two witnesses look
[1:45:08] at the ministries you'll see that those
[1:45:10] Ministry of Moses and the Ministry of
[1:45:12] Elijah glory to God that's how we know
[1:45:15] who it is we got a guest no more look at
[1:45:17] the ministries is right there in the
[1:45:19] spiritual now this ministry was was was
[1:45:23] was was use of God but but this ministry
[1:45:27] cannot do anything until God told it to
[1:45:30] do it I want y'all to see some things
[1:45:32] here scriptures think that I don't even
[1:45:33] catch before he said God called him to
[1:45:38] the wilderness and he played that
[1:45:41] generation because they didn't receive
[1:45:44] it now what the big thing that happened
[1:45:47] first Kings 18 is where Elijah has this
[1:45:51] tremendous God that answers by fire let
[1:45:55] him be God but you know
[1:45:56] Elijah was going down there amongst a
[1:45:59] hab it wasn't really just to calm down
[1:46:01] fight he was actually going to bring
[1:46:03] rain back to the people
[1:46:05] amen because he told them earlier it
[1:46:07] will be in a rain here till I call forth
[1:46:09] God gave him a vision to go and comfort
[1:46:13] her here ain't had my after a mighty
[1:46:16] demonstration of fire coming down and
[1:46:19] consuming the altar and now he sees I
[1:46:21] like to go and they've telling servant
[1:46:23] go up now go up now go man went up seven
[1:46:26] times and say I don't see nothing he
[1:46:28] said but I do see the cloud the size of
[1:46:30] a man's head he said man you better get
[1:46:32] ready it's about to rain I don't care
[1:46:34] how change in your situation
[1:46:57] [Applause]
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:13] get ready for great things said maybe I
[1:47:19] better get ready is getting rain rain
[1:47:21] and that's why Elijah was there now they
[1:47:22] had this mighty demonstration rain
[1:47:25] coming mighty demonstration of fire
[1:47:28] falling but their hearts in turn hearts
[1:47:36] turn turn supernatural all over the
[1:47:39] place but their hearts and turn and so
[1:47:41] so they reject it the reveal word for
[1:47:43] the day plank happened now what we pick
[1:47:45] up in the rest of the scripture glycan
[1:47:48] just-just-just I'm first we're at first
[1:47:51] Kings 19 I'm gonna come back to that
[1:47:52] maybe not let me just hit that just real
[1:47:55] quick right now no one is when we read
[1:47:58] first Kings 19 he launches in this cave
[1:48:02] running from Jezebel you saying Lord I'm
[1:48:05] the only one standing ain't nobody
[1:48:06] understanding all the way
[1:48:07] God had to encourage this I got 7,000
[1:48:10] that ain't bow he said but he said you
[1:48:12] say when he told the God here we have
[1:48:15] this great wind shaking the mountain the
[1:48:19] Bible said God was not in the wind then
[1:48:23] we had this earthquake and everybody
[1:48:26] wanna watch the earthquakes but the
[1:48:28] Bible said God was not even in the
[1:48:31] earthquake hallelujah and then we had
[1:48:35] fired not wait that does caught my
[1:48:37] attention didn't he just have fire in
[1:48:40] the chapter before but the Bible said
[1:48:44] God was not in the fire sometimes God is
[1:48:47] trying to get you to move from with what
[1:48:48] you had in the past yes God moved like
[1:48:51] that before but he want to do something
[1:48:53] different now and if you're not if
[1:48:55] you're not careful you'll limit got to
[1:48:57] what he used to do and miss what he's
[1:48:59] doing right now he was not in the fire
[1:49:02] he was not in the earthquake he was not
[1:49:05] in the wind the Bible sales are still
[1:49:08] small voice and this is where people
[1:49:12] missing it look and when I father's
[1:49:14] message that's why I say it's gonna take
[1:49:16] more than a bear and a bridge and all
[1:49:17] that I'm not looking at all the things
[1:49:19] I'm looking at the word that was
[1:49:21] revealed hallelujah
[1:49:26] look at this
[1:49:32] they rejected the word and the profit is
[1:49:34] called into the wilderness now I read
[1:49:37] the verse there let's see here in first
[1:49:42] Kings 19 and let's just let's pick this
[1:49:44] up again verse 14 and 15 said I've been
[1:49:55] very jealous for the Lord God of hosts
[1:49:57] because the children of Israel have
[1:49:59] forsaken that covenant thrown down that
[1:50:01] altars and slain that prophets with us
[1:50:04] with a sward and I even I only am left
[1:50:06] and they seek my life to take it away
[1:50:09] and the Lord said unto him go return on
[1:50:12] our way to the wilderness so God is
[1:50:14] calling a prophet so the wilderness off
[1:50:17] the scene to the witness of Damascus and
[1:50:20] when I'm coming so no it has yet to be
[1:50:21] king of Assyria and he gives them some
[1:50:23] instructions and in other verses but the
[1:50:26] the main thing I want you to see God is
[1:50:28] colors prophet into the wilderness and
[1:50:30] he's not moving until God actually
[1:50:32] releases him I want to see some things
[1:50:34] that happen first kings 20 Israel
[1:50:37] actually defeats the army of Syria and
[1:50:41] you know when they defeated Syria
[1:50:43] it was here the king of Syria was
[1:50:46] actually given right into Ahab's hands
[1:50:48] that they have let the man go so there
[1:50:51] was a prophet that rose up it wasn't
[1:50:53] Elijah was another prophet another
[1:50:54] prophet rises up and he says he walks up
[1:50:57] to him and says smite me man stay here
[1:51:00] the Prophet no not me I can oh god
[1:51:04] forbid that I would hit a prophet okay
[1:51:06] because you didn't hit me you don't get
[1:51:08] ate up by a lion so I think another
[1:51:11] fellow standing there watching
[1:51:12] everything that just happened the
[1:51:14] Prophet random dem say smite me that
[1:51:16] fella read well hit the prophet gave him
[1:51:21] a blanket probably women found the king
[1:51:27] and said you know look you let this man
[1:51:30] go and you did this you did that say now
[1:51:32] that man coming they're gonna take your
[1:51:33] life prophesy
[1:51:34] see a plague get ready to strike because
[1:51:37] when plague strike people start losing
[1:51:38] their lives right so here the plate so
[1:51:41] you're not because you let him go he's
[1:51:42] coming back and he's gonna take you out
[1:51:44] you gonna die
[1:51:45] because you let him go tow a have this
[1:51:46] now another thing that happened after
[1:51:49] this is the plot to kill nabe off and
[1:51:56] take his vineyard
[1:51:57] this was after they rejected the Prophet
[1:52:01] even they reject the revealed word that
[1:52:03] was coming through the Prophet here they
[1:52:05] had a great manifestation of the God the
[1:52:08] dance of the fire and God answers my
[1:52:09] fire and not it they rejected and look
[1:52:11] at what happens to them now they want to
[1:52:13] take me bounce pinyon and and Jezebel in
[1:52:16] her skin what kind of woman was that
[1:52:19] lied and signed letters in and our
[1:52:22] husband's name and told them you don't
[1:52:24] need to be crying about this we don't
[1:52:26] get the raised up some sort of some some
[1:52:28] vile men what we call minute Belial
[1:52:31] and had them lie on meatballs and they
[1:52:33] took the man's vineyard had him kill to
[1:52:36] take his vineyard lies were told and
[1:52:38] they took this man's vineyard and Wow
[1:52:40] while a habits rejoicing God tells the
[1:52:43] Prophet leave the wilderness and go to
[1:52:45] meet a half hallelujah let's pick this
[1:52:48] up I want to read this prophecy a man
[1:52:51] this is the first Kings 21 verse 19 I
[1:52:55] believe now start at 17 now god only
[1:53:01] speaks to his prophet when he speaks to
[1:53:03] him and sends him out when he wants him
[1:53:05] to go he calls him to the wilderness
[1:53:07] then sends him out and then he calls him
[1:53:09] right back man it takes some training it
[1:53:13] takes some training to be able to hear
[1:53:14] the voice guy because there's things
[1:53:16] that you know that can happen that you
[1:53:17] want to get involved in oh god I know
[1:53:21] that's right there's things that
[1:53:23] happened and I mean that sons of God
[1:53:25] just wanted to get involved in Kovach 19
[1:53:28] I'm talking sons of God that wonders
[1:53:31] then itís a I spoke to it I did it
[1:53:34] God and God ain't moving like that
[1:53:39] hallelujah maybe you can speak to it for
[1:53:41] your family get that devil off your
[1:53:44] family but the judgment got the strike
[1:53:46] God got to get somebody's attention
[1:53:49] amen glory to God look at this
[1:53:52] first Kings 21 says and the word of the
[1:53:56] Lord
[1:53:56] Elijah the Tishbite saying arise go down
[1:53:58] the media have king of Israel which is
[1:54:00] in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard
[1:54:02] of naboth whether he has got whether he
[1:54:04] has gone down to possess it and thou
[1:54:06] shalt speak of them saying thus saith
[1:54:08] the Lord
[1:54:09] hast thou kill and also taking
[1:54:11] possession and thou shalt speak and AM
[1:54:13] stand thus saith the Lord in the place
[1:54:16] where dogs licked the blood of me both
[1:54:18] should a dog lick thy blood even the
[1:54:21] vine here's a prophecy that's given to
[1:54:25] this man because of what he just did
[1:54:26] with Nate ball he couldn't blame it and
[1:54:29] say that was my wife that did know you
[1:54:31] rejoice it and you're gonna suffer for
[1:54:34] what you allowed your wife to do God
[1:54:36] brought her prophecy again again that
[1:54:37] now God sends the proper right back off
[1:54:39] the scene back into the woods don't
[1:54:40] watch this the next chapter this plague
[1:54:51] is trying to strike it people gonna lose
[1:54:53] their lives
[1:54:53] hey help us to go to battle and and when
[1:54:58] he's when he wants to go to battle he
[1:55:00] acts Jehoshaphat to come joining and
[1:55:02] John so I say you've got any profits
[1:55:05] around and say yeah we got four hundred
[1:55:07] of them they all come at me prophesy and
[1:55:11] the problem is this every one of them
[1:55:13] tell the exact same prophecy and John's
[1:55:16] resting now and usually somebody gonna
[1:55:19] say something a little different but
[1:55:20] full hundred prophets say the exact same
[1:55:22] thing something wrong somewhere do you
[1:55:25] know who God's tip I mean when they said
[1:55:27] five they said four mcian
[1:55:28] the answer was there any other prophets
[1:55:31] he got micaiah
[1:55:33] can I tell y'all something Elijah was
[1:55:35] still living he was still living why did
[1:55:40] he go get he like he knew what was gonna
[1:55:43] be safe but mkhaya being a god-sent
[1:55:46] prophet picked up on the same prophecy
[1:55:49] that he larger gate that ain't have your
[1:55:52] blood gonna be licked by dogs that's why
[1:55:55] i mcai come and say look i know all
[1:55:57] these guys have said this and one guy
[1:55:58] said look do you just say the same thing
[1:55:59] we say he's saying i'll say nothing but
[1:56:01] what the Lord told me to say got down
[1:56:05] there yeah I'm say uh we want to go to
[1:56:08] this batter what you think Oh
[1:56:10] the Lord gonna bless you go on oh yeah
[1:56:14] say man I told you you want to tell me
[1:56:16] what God see oh you really want to hear
[1:56:18] what God gotta say all right it says I
[1:56:21] tell you what I saw in a vision is that
[1:56:24] there was some spirits that came before
[1:56:27] the throne of God a lying spirit say I
[1:56:29] will go down and get in the mouths of
[1:56:31] his prophets and make them all prophesy
[1:56:33] lie and they'll believe the lie and
[1:56:34] it'll cause your word to come to pass
[1:56:37] here here and he say he's saying what I
[1:56:40] see is Israel scan it with no Shepherd
[1:56:43] hey upset though he was no prophesy evil
[1:56:47] against me the other 400 said we should
[1:56:49] go I'm gonna go on out I'm gonna
[1:56:50] disguise myself in the bat I'm gonna do
[1:56:52] all this so imma do all that and lo and
[1:56:54] behold when they got that to the battle
[1:56:55] they was only looking for the king
[1:56:58] jehoshaphat was dressed as a king but he
[1:57:00] started yelling like somebody else he
[1:57:03] went he was yelling like no King he was
[1:57:05] yelling like he was a he was afraid and
[1:57:07] they say well he can't be the King doing
[1:57:09] all that so they some guy pulled a bull
[1:57:11] just out of nowhere shot a hat took him
[1:57:14] back and he died right in the spot where
[1:57:16] the prophet Elijah told me he's gonna
[1:57:18] die and the dogs were gonna lick his
[1:57:20] blood he went back fulfill that see a
[1:57:22] plague strikes when you reject the word
[1:57:27] why didn't he call Elijah
[1:57:29] why why why was it Micaiah there was
[1:57:32] another prophet in the land see that
[1:57:34] prophet couldn't even color God did not
[1:57:36] even send him to Ahab when it's time to
[1:57:39] go to battle hey Eli didn't come trying
[1:57:42] to stop it Elijah did not get in God's
[1:57:43] wait I told you it takes some character
[1:57:45] to understand to do how to do the will
[1:57:48] of God
[1:57:49] Hey I mean Elijah did not get in God's
[1:57:52] Way when it's time for the Word of God
[1:57:54] to be fulfilled I tell y'all something
[1:57:55] as a proud of Jesus Christ we gotta have
[1:57:58] to learn not to get in God's Way when
[1:58:01] it's time for his promises to be
[1:58:03] fulfilled
[1:58:05] I don't care how much power we got I
[1:58:07] don't care how much with Norton we got
[1:58:09] don't get in God's Way when it's time
[1:58:12] for His Word to be made manifest they
[1:58:21] saw all these great things but because
[1:58:24] they rejected the word death begin to
[1:58:28] settle in many other prophecies begin to
[1:58:31] be manifested and and and I feel like
[1:58:34] the same thing is happening today people
[1:58:36] rejecting the word and we're seeing all
[1:58:37] kind of stuff settled in but I just
[1:58:40] believe God is gonna bring us through
[1:58:41] all this - I believe it's gonna do that
[1:58:43] let's look at a couple quotes and we'll
[1:58:45] just bring this to a close a man on
[1:58:46] today hallelujah be careful about
[1:58:49] rejected and reveal word in your day
[1:58:51] your day
[1:59:01] I think I want to yeah I want to read
[1:59:05] from what here stare Elijah
[1:59:07] I'm gonna read paragraph East 17 and
[1:59:10] then I'm gonna skip down to paragraph 25
[1:59:13] a man from what here's dare Elijah look
[1:59:16] at this it says so what happened it
[1:59:20] called them together in the God of
[1:59:22] heaven answer in a supernatural sign to
[1:59:25] Israel and he was still the God that
[1:59:28] could answer by fire and he did just
[1:59:32] what he always did answer prayer kept
[1:59:35] his word and after all of this still it
[1:59:38] wasn't sufficient and little Elijah he
[1:59:42] didn't know what to do so he run to the
[1:59:44] juniper-tree amen he says I'm glad that
[1:59:48] there's a juniper tree all God's people
[1:59:49] needs to go to that juniper tree it's a
[1:59:53] place where he was so discouraged he
[1:59:55] didn't know what to do so he ran out to
[1:59:57] himself and got under the juniper tree
[1:59:59] many of us feel like going there and
[2:00:02] today when we see the institution's
[2:00:04] filled with people of God people of God
[2:00:07] see the institution's filled with people
[2:00:09] of God nervous breakdowns tension oh it
[2:00:11] makes all of us want to run such a
[2:00:14] juniper tree juniper tree is where you
[2:00:16] can go and get some strength from God
[2:00:17] he'll supernaturally you know provide
[2:00:19] the strength so I told you supernatural
[2:00:22] came and the people still was not moved
[2:00:24] by the supernatural the same thing that
[2:00:26] they you had me to share in this
[2:00:28] testimony that says one people not be
[2:00:29] moved they got to have something on the
[2:00:31] inside greater than the supernatural a
[2:00:33] man that are called and identify with
[2:00:35] this word let's look at this in
[2:00:37] paragraph II - 25 same message he says
[2:00:40] I'm so glad that there is a juniper tree
[2:00:44] when we get all war and tore up we can
[2:00:48] go under that juniper tree and find
[2:00:51] spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of
[2:00:54] a trip there he layed woke up feeling a
[2:00:58] little better
[2:00:59] and he went 40 days and 40 nights I'd
[2:01:02] imagine if there's a doctor listening in
[2:01:04] wouldn't you like to know what kind of a
[2:01:07] vitamin he used that'll keep a man or
[2:01:10] corn cake and and keep a man on a corn
[2:01:12] cake and a glass of water for 40 days
[2:01:14] and 40 nights that's the power of our
[2:01:17] God then he finds the cave way back in
[2:01:20] the wilderness and the first thing you
[2:01:21] know God found him back in there and he
[2:01:24] called to him and there went a Russian
[2:01:26] wind through the through through that
[2:01:27] tour of the mountain The Rock's written
[2:01:30] fell down a larger just set and listened
[2:01:32] and there came a shaking an earthquake
[2:01:35] that shook the mountain but he lied to
[2:01:37] just set still and then come the fire
[2:01:39] fail lightning flash and Elijah said
[2:01:43] steal but then a still small voice spoke
[2:01:47] give me Elijah answer he wrapped his
[2:01:49] mantle over his face and walked out I
[2:01:51] just wondered that if we haven't
[2:01:54] listened to much to Russian mighty winds
[2:01:57] and fire and blood and everything else
[2:02:01] and have failed to hear that still small
[2:02:04] voice wonder if we've looked so much two
[2:02:08] gifts that we can't see the giver
[2:02:11] you know America is prone for noise
[2:02:13] that's the reason rock and roll is so
[2:02:16] popular and all those other lots of
[2:02:18] noises now we've had Russian mighty
[2:02:20] winds we've had great shake ins but
[2:02:22] where has God been and all of it Eli
[2:02:25] just said he was not in it what did we
[2:02:29] do with the Russian winds what have we
[2:02:32] done with all kinds of sensations where
[2:02:34] has it got us denominated so tight that
[2:02:38] one hat won't give fellowship one to
[2:02:40] another what have we done about whatever
[2:02:43] we done by is a church better off is it
[2:02:45] unified by Russian winds no sir it's
[2:02:49] only unified when them people will hear
[2:02:52] that still small voice of God that's
[2:02:55] where we're failing friends when God
[2:02:57] appears on own the signs with something
[2:02:59] and and proves himself to be God
[2:03:02] instead of going after the noise let's
[2:03:05] go after the one that made the noise we
[2:03:08] forget to give up it just reminds me of
[2:03:12] a story I heard a man of action that
[2:03:17] took place and
[2:03:20] there's a man very wealthy man and had
[2:03:25] some really really nice paintings that
[2:03:27] he made and you know after he passed
[2:03:31] away he was gonna sell all these
