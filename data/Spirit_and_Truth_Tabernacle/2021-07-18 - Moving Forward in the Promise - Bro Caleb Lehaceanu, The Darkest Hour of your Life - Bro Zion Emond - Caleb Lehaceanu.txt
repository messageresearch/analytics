his grace towards her so sister capers if you would come at this time amen we will invite you just to share your testimony praise the lord god bless a little nervous but i just want to give god all the praises god is so good [Music] oh god is good and i just want to thank each and every one of you all who prayed for me i felt them prayers even though they told me what was going on in which it was a shock to all of us you know and uh but i wasn't afraid i didn't get all been out of shape about it i said lord it's in your hands where do i be be lois you know you your will be done and i just prayed and asked the lord you know just to bring me through this but i know all the saints was praying i knew y'all was praying i knew y'all was praying and all that i said lord i just thank you and um when they did all the tests and all and uh i got excellent service excellent and i said lord this is your doing you know and uh they told me what i had to go through i had a double bypass and all because they had that i had some pretty clark otters there but i didn't know it you know but otherwise in that i the doctor said that um at my age he said i went through this surgery very well and all because he said there are people that we do surgeons much younger than you are they can't handle this too well and uh uh the morning before i went in the survey brother troy called me and had prayer with me on the phone and the doctor he was standing there waiting you know and everything and also he said well we ready to take you in surgery i said well right now i said i have a brother praying for so he waited he didn't push he waited and everything and also like i said they you know they took me downstairs and all and they told me and explained to me everything that what was going to be what i had to go through you know and everything and i just i said well lord hey i'm in your hands you got that doctor saying you know lord you i know you're here with me because he promised that he would be with us even inner until the end of all things and also like i said i was in the hospital for about 10 11 days and i was healing so fast they were just amazed they said wow boy you're doing good you know and everything and all and i said well lord i give you all thanks they don't know who i know and everything at all but otherwise in that uh right now i'm doing pretty good you know day by day little by little and it has been almost eight weeks now and everything so i went to my cardiologist last week and uh he checked me over and everything and he was asking me all kinds of questions plus he was trying to make me a dope addict i told this man i missed him i'm always trying to live a clean life i said i've never done drugs you know he said where did you drink i said i tried but i didn't like it you know and everything and he said well you smoke i said yeah i did smoke for quite a few years but otherwise the lord delivered me from that you know and uh so he sit there and talk with us a little bit and uh so he uh uh when he finished with me he said well now this is my first time going to him okay and he said well i tell you what he said you're doing so good i don't want to see you until six months [Applause] and all in my heart i was saying thank you jesus thank you jesus so when i went out front and he told the reception set up her appointment six months from now and they said what they said we don't see that in this office six months and you a new patient you know he said yes i want to see her in six months and uh and one of them said oh you should be jumping up clapping your hands singing and everything but otherwise i like to say i just it's all god it's all god brothers and sisters you know and everything and also but like i said and i just appreciate my husband oh oh i tell you this brother i can say he's a man's man [Applause] i said honey i said your parents taught you well this oh this brother oh he cleaned the house i got gourmet meals he helped me in and out of the bed i didn't really have to do anything i mean he picked me up put me in the band and all that i was doing when i first got home and at first they thought that they would they couldn't get home health service for me and all and one of the ladies at the hospital she was doing a lot of calling they wanted to put me in a rehab there across from the hospital but that didn't work out so i said well lord it's all in your hand i'm not gonna sit here and worry about that so the doctor came in and he said well mrs capers i think we'll send you home it's okay so some of the nurses that was waiting on they said you wouldn't do much better at home you don't want to go to rehab and when we got home oh we had got so many phone calls for home health service i said look at god you know and also i did get help and even when they came they looked at me oh lady you had open heart surgery we don't need to be here you're doing so well we don't see patients like you much you know and all but uh like i say i just thank the lord for for bringing me through because actually really i want to share just a little bit how it started with me i thought i was having heartburn real bad and i didn't know so i stopped my doctor and uh she gave me a prescription for heartburn and she said i think that might be where the deals so before i left out the office she said well you know she said let me tell you this she said women's symptoms of heart attack is a lot different from a man and i said well i do know a little about that so she said um mrs cable she said if you uh have this episode again she said i want you to go to the emergency room so i think that was on a wednesday yeah it was on a wednesday we got home and i said well honey i said well i feel all right maybe we get ready to go to church i went let's get myself ready i had just took a little quick shower that i told wham but this thing hit me like a bum and i was in the bathroom and i said oh god and i was having some chest burning burnt burning shoulder breasts sweating and i said lord if i ever need you i need you now help me lord now i need you so i called brookhaven he was in the kitchen you know he came and i told him how i was feeling so when i did i took one of the uh the things for the heartburn that doctor had gave me and it helped it eased it off a little bit i went and got in bed and i went to sleep i slept all night i didn't have any more problems i got the next day and then eventually it did start again so um i said i don't want to go in the emergency room i don't want to go to the hospital but anyway i said no lord i guess i better go i went on and i'm glad i did it because they kept me there for quite a few hours they did all kinds of tests on me and everything blood work blood pressure all that stuff so um way after a while the doctor came back in and he said well mrs cable he said that uh we are going to tell you that your ekg came back you had a heart attack i looked at me like are you crazy what he said yes ma'am he said you had a slight heart attack i just couldn't believe it so he said well we're gonna have to send you over to londwood over in fort pierce that's the big medical center where they do heart surgery and so he said that well we are have to send you by ambulance because your husband can't drive you so they did they sent me my ambulance and everything and took me over there and everything and also um that's the way i stayed until all this happened what they had to do the surgery and everything and all and uh uh like i said it was telling me that the different arteries i had blah one time they thought about doing a stint but the arteries that they were looking at they said no we got to do a bypass and that's okay all right lord it's all in your hands you know everything you know but i just thank the lord for bringing me through i'm doing good my degree is going i still i'm doing very well by the grace of god like i say i'm just a little nervous that's what you know but um oh let me see yeah with all my home health service they you know they came and they told me what to do i had a therapist and everybody came to the house you know but uh but like i say i give glory to the lord jesus christ and my wonderful husband and oh yeah and also otherwise in there like i said i'm doing good by the grace of god i'm doing very well i'm still healing i'm not out of the woods yet but i'm still healing but oh i didn't i just thank the lord for it but you know i just want to try to sing this little song here it's been on my heart y'all pray for me i'm not a saiyan now i give praises to the lord what i can do but uh this is a song that sister lewis wrote some years back what house will you bill me [Music] and all and this song has been on my heart what house will you build me will it be a house of stone what house will you build me [Music] will i feel at home when i open the door and enter inside will i flee away from the darkness i find will i find light in every room is it fit for your heavenly groom what house will you build me if it's not what i've chosen it nero will stand if you chose to build it contrary to my plan i send you my angel in this last day to forerun my coming and show you the way receive what he told you and don't change a word he's the only voice that must be heard what house will you build me what kind of foundation will it be ground in the world what walls with walls have been tested by the says the lord will the windows have light that shine from above will door swing wide open with gospel love will my capstone come down on the frame [Music] will the blueprint be drawn in my name what house will you build me what house will you build me will it be your house of stone what house will you build me will i feel at home when i open the door and enter inside will lightly away from the darkness i find will i find light in every room is it fit for your heavenly groom what else will you build me praise the lord certainly appreciate the lord jesus for touching our sister capers and just bringing her through this this this procedure and it's the many testimonies that came out of it i was telling you all that many of the young nurses would it wouldn't even be an eighth floor but they want to go up to see where brother and sister campus were because they just appreciate seeing how he was just there for his wife and just a real example of what a husband's supposed to be sometimes god allows us to go through things like this so we can be a testimony to somebody so some folk might not come to church but you being the church can go to where they are all right so we thank god for everything that he allows us to go through it all works together for his good as she was testifying and reminding me i heard earlier this week from sister irma scott she had called me to say pastor i had hip surgery and i got a report from the doctor the doctor told me that i am healing faster than anybody he's seen heal [Music] um so it's a common thread and i just believe before you before you let them touch you surgery sometimes is necessary but before you let them touch you have somebody pray over you before they touch you right and uh you just never know maybe god will touch you before the doctors touch you like he did for sister branham so we just thank god for all things amen i um i want to um just let me give the announcements and and a couple of things there and we'll kind of just move on in the service the lord is good amen um so wednesday night we'll be streaming service through twitter and facebook so keep that in mind and then uh sister's prayer will be on this tuesday at 7 30 and um we are doing our back-to-school backpack

brother aaron come here for business business not business no business right and um um so yesterday they uh he had it all worked out he'd been working behind the scenes for quite some time and and uh yesterday they they he he shocked us shocked her real good uh and uh you know we're grateful but to me was very significant because um 13 years old all of my girls when they reached age 13 i did something with all of them uh we bought them promise rings amen and um and that was a promise that they would keep themselves until they get married and yesterday when uh brother aaron was sliding on his ring before he could slide it on this one had to come off so i told him that i i cherish that and uh it means a lot to me and uh and i'm i'm just so happy uh that um my brother aaron is coming to life and and made a difference and uh we're just praying for them and i and i want you i want you all to hear this from me um in the bible what did rebecca do when she met isaac i will go so i don't want anybody i don't want anybody interfering with what god's plan is and that's from either side right i told them i want them to be led of the lord uh you got two ministries that you're part of and very fruitful and successful ministries so uh let god be the one that does what god does and uh and just leave it all in god's hand but don't don't don't don't get in the way of god just pray for him and amen release him into the care of the lord and uh we know that if god calls her to go then the other thing i'm expecting that god gonna have somebody that will replace her right so y'all just watch the hand of the lord he he at work he at work and we give him all the glory and all the praise in advance so amen amen the lord knows what she means to us but i will never put pressure on on them in that way i want god to be the one to do it so i want to make sure the rest of the church know my heart so i don't want to hear anybody saying or someone so told me this so i'll tell you what after i said what what's their number right they understand i'm just being nice don't meddle all right all right praise god can we give him another just round of applause amen amen one down one more

amen hallelujah do you believe he's still god amen hey man if you just stand to your feet thank you musicians just just stand to your feet let's just turn in the word this morning to philippians the third chapter in the 13th verse and we just want to say we counted an honor and a privilege just to be gathered with you this morning and we just bring greetings from our pastor brother nathan bryant there a church of the open door and uh the saints there we just sure do love you and appreciate you all so and we thank brother jack for the opportunity this wasn't supposed to be a ministering trip originally we came here for aaron and just to support him but it turned out to be just to preach so we're just thankful for that philippians the third chapter in the 13th verse and then after that we just want to turn to revelations 10 verse 7 amen brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you god shall reveal this even this unto you then revelations the 10th chapter and the seventh verse i just want to turn there quickly but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of god should be finished as he had declared it to his servants the prophets we just want to speak on this little thought for a few minutes here on moving forward in the promise moving forward in the promise let's just bow our heads shortly here heavenly father lord we just come before you this morning lord not to lift ourselves up or to to say some nice words and that are going to tickle our ears father but we come lord it's to worship you lord we come to just magnify your name father that's what it's about this morning it's not about us lord but it's all about you father and we ask lord that you would just come lord anoint this this word father lord jesus and just anoint us just to speak father anoint the here is lord to receive father we're thankful for that this morning jesus name amen amen you can be seated amen moving forward in the promise i believe we're living in an age where every believer must come to a place of decision everyone is is going to come to this place where they must make a decision and the world is looking to the left and the world is looking to the right and and politics are going down hollywood's going down everything is going down and the world is looking to things around them but i believe that this bride is not looking at what's around them but the bride is looking what's in front of them the bride is looking to move forward and i believe that it's time to make a decision it's not you know everyone has a choice we're living in an age where everyone is having a choice you know you have the um lg t something something that you have then they all have a choice each one of us have a choice and you either have a choice to move on or you have a choice to go back you have a choice to either to keep serving christ and to to stay in this message or you have a choice to either go back to where you came from but we're not called this morning to go back to where we came from but i believe we are called to move forward into the promise that god has ordained for us and brother branham would say here at cadiz barnea he said the people at the hour of decision now you've got to make up your mind this church has got to make up its mind every man comes to a place where there's a crucial hour there's a crucial time come when you had to make up your mind a judgment seat you was that you had to say i'm guilty or i'm not guilty so brother branham here is is is talking about about the decision and that how you're going to come to a crucial hour you're going to come to a crucial time where in your life where you must make a decision and it's a decision to go on or go forward as we were saying but he goes on to say he says when you're standing before the judge you've got to make up your mind and tonight the brahm tabernacle has got to make up his mind and i would say this morning that spirit and truth tabernacle has got to make of its mind we each have to make up our mind he said and and you're either going to go on or go back that's right you're going to go back to garlic in the leak and stuff of egypt or you're gonna go on to angel's food to the promised land where god made a promise we're going on to an old fashioned holy ghost revival or you'll be a wish-washy packing around and pecking like a robin on an apple until the day you lie until the day you die so we see here as i was just studying this thought last night you see a lot of people around the message are are like and and there are and have came from the world and we've all come from the world but a lot of people around the message they're they're packing and pecking like a robin on an apple they're looking for something but i don't know i do not believe that the bride is looking to go back but the bride is not packing and the bride's not pecking around like a robin but the bride is packing something the bride's packing a message that will carry them up abroad the bride is carrying something that will carry them into a rapture and and he says you've got to make a decision you can't go on why halt you be before two opinions said elijah if god be god serve him if he's not god then don't serve him so i would say this morning why are we halting between two opinions why are we still standing here and saying we're listening to the critics and different ones saying oh the message is right or i don't know if we're going to be able to believe the message or is a prophet vindicated but i would say to you don't look at the words of the critic but look what the promise is look what the promise is in front of you and moses you i want to speak on the children of israel hill just for a few moments moses had sent spies into the land to come back and tell the people and we all know this story but he had sent spies and these spies came back with something they came back with uh two things they came back with uh the fruit of the land the evidence of the land and they also came back with a negative testimony and and and they said well there's a land and and if you read here they brought back the fruits of the land but they came back saying that there's a land but the walls are too great the giants are are too big and and there's no way that we can take this land and there's a lot of people around us that are saying well you know um um it's hard to obtain the the promise it's hard to to move into a rapture if you just stick with me for a moment just to continue in this but people have said that the message is too hard to live or there's too many rules it's become a set of rules it's become a set of laws but if you ever really grasp the meaning of the message it's not a set of rules it's not a set of laws but what it is this morning it is to carry you into a rapture if you ever grasp the meaning it'll become more than just words on a page but it will become your life it will become your everything you will be able to give your all and sacrifice everything in your life for this message and for the lord amen but there's a lot of critics that throw down the word a lot of critics around us to throw down but i would say this morning brother jack let the critics come let him come let him say what they want to say but we're not looking what the words of a critic are saying but we're looking at what the word of god has been ordained for us and we're and but we're looking at the promise and numbers 11 in the fifth chapter if you could just put that on there for me back there um we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leek and the onions and the garlic just i'm sorry getting a little hot already let's just read that again we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leek and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes so you see they remember what they had but they were going somewhere where they were going to have it all they were going somewhere that's much greater than what they had back in egypt and i would say that we're going somewhere in this day that's greater than the world we're going somewhere we're going to a land where there's no more job there's no more sorrow there's no more hurt there's no more disappointment but we're going somewhere where there's peace there's joy and and we're just going to be around the throne of god rejoicing but you know if you just think about this they remembered what they had and i would say to us this morning don't remember what you had the devil will try to come and say remember this what you had remember that when you had when you served me but i would say what did we have when we were under the devil's reign what did we have we had nothing but when we came into this message when we came into christ we had everything amen we had dead systems we had a dead church we had a broken up families but with christ we have everything amen and you can just imagine for a moment the children of israel when they were in egypt they were slaves under pharaoh and they were under the bondage of the enemy but they remembered one thing and they had a promise and they knew that no matter how hard it got no matter how how tired they got no matter how hard the whip or the beating on their back was they remembered that they had a promise that god would deliver them and and at church this morning god has promised us this morning that no matter how hard satan comes no matter how hard satan blows no matter how hard the pressure gets god would deliver us he he he he we might feel like we're going down defeat we might feel like well you know i don't know what else to do i'm stuck but we have a promise that god is a present help in the time of trouble do you believe that and i believe that we're going somewhere as i said earlier politics politics are going down hollywood is going down the nominations are going down systems going down creeds are going down but the bride is going up the bride is packing something that will carry them up amen as the children of israel were called out we also are called out this morning we are called out with a message to keep moving us forward but this message not is not here to bring you back to where you came from or however you look back but the message is here to bring you forward just stick with me i know this is simple but simple is good maybe you've heard it before but there's another reason you're hearing it this morning but the message came to move you forward we are not following a billy graham or or a jim jones but what we are following this morning is a pillar of fire we are following something that has been vindicated this morning and and brother branham would say here he said obey the to the angel here in this message said not moses moses never performed one miracle it was the angel of god that went before moses it was a pillar of fire at night and a cloud by day and when you see the picture that we've got to show you here shortly if you haven't i believe you'll feel that it's the same pillar of fire that's leading the people today the angel of god which we know the angel that led moses was the angel of the covenant which was christ the son of god and now or the logos that came of god and the son of god then when god delivered the children of israel when they were in bondage and couldn't help themselves now this this notices god delivered the children of israel when they couldn't help themselves but i want you to picture yourself here and they're children of israel's shoes now but today god's people are not in bondage spiritually but they're delivered by the power of the holy spirit no man has to stay in bondage of sin any longer because the holy spirit brings him from the bondage of sin so israel was abound but the holy spirit and the holy spirit this morning has come to make you free if you're bound in sin if you're bound in your own ideas i would say this morning the holy spirit has come he's sweeping in this building this morning and as the word is being preached you're free you know on the cross this morning it's still saying your pardon go on keep going forward everyone in heaven around us every saint that's going on and saying to you this morning keep marching forward don't look back don't look at what you had but keep moving forward into the promise this this land that we're going to be obtaining is much greater than what we have in this world but we are moving into something that's much greater than everything else around us we're moving into a promise that god has ordained for us amen if there's sin in your life i would say cut it out get it out of your life don't let that stop you don't let that affect your walk with christ keep moving forward into something into something of god amen we gotta keep moving forward amen the holy spirit is here this morning to give you grace he's still here his blood still remains on the cross this morning do you believe that amen but god is also looking for a heart god is not looking for more church members sure it's great sure it's great to have church members but what good is it churches that have a good church what good is it to have a big body but it's not about the numbers but what it's about is your heart what is your heart like what is it what is is it blackened by the by the sin or it was your heart free and just stick with me now as we just as we go on to this but first corinthians the third chapter and the 16th verse and the 17th verse he says know ye not that she are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defiles the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye says which temple ye are which temple are you are you the temple of of what satan has are you the temple of the holy ghost and i do not believe that god is building in a temple an or an idea or in a system but god is building in a temple of the hearts of a believer that will allow him to build in you see god cannot build in your heart if you do not allow him to build in your heart god has to have a submissive heart for him in order to build in your heart and and so you have to allow god to work on our heart so it's time that we allow god to build i would say this morning god and my prayer is god build in me lord my heart is submissive i want to surrender everything i have lord build in me amen do you believe that but it's not about how well you know the bible or how well you know the quote sure those things are good but what good is it is to know the quotes what good is it to know the bible if if you don't have christ in your life if you don't have christ in your heart and and brother branham would say here i hope it's all right just to read the prophet this morning but he says i have no education at all and i'm not when i made that remark a while ago about education i wasn't trying to take crutches for my ignorance but what i'm trying to say that it doesn't take education to know god it takes a submissive heart to know god so brother branham he didn't have all the education he didn't have all the things he didn't have the seminary school and he didn't have all these different things but what he had he was packing something else he was packing truth he was packing a message and it wasn't about his education it wasn't about how well he knew this or how well he knew that but his heart was submissive to the word so is your heart submissive to the word this morning i would say your heart is not warning the things of the world but your heart is wanting more of god and i believe it's time for the bride to possess the blessings that god has ordained for us to possess amen to possess means to have as belonging to one or own it can also mean having a right to something so if you have a right to every promise of god what is what is prohibiting you from moving forward into the promise what is what is stopping you from possessing the promise so if you're sick why are you not taking back your right to your healing if if you're if you're bound in sin why are you not taking your right to be free if you're bound by by anxiety or depression why aren't you taking your right back this morning so so if we have a right to possess something we and in order to possess something you must move forward into that first you can't just stick back and say well you know i have the right there to possess that but i don't want to i don't want to really i want to stay where i'm at i like where i'm at spiritually but but why why are we staying here and and why are we i'm just liking this where we're at spiritually but i would say if god has so many more promises if god has so many more things in store for us why aren't we moving forward into those promises what's stopping us and and and brother branham was saying an expectation says now notice when god makes a promise to you he will fulfill it you don't have to be afraid that he will not keep his word for god will keep his word that's true so let's think about the children of israel for a moment they were they were made a lot of promises they were made to be brought out of egypt they were they were made they were they were promised to be brought out of um on the things of egypt and under the reign of pharaoh and they were promised something at kirsh barnea as well but they they had many promises but they didn't move into every single promise so just think about this like i said earlier you are in the children of israel's shoes place yourself in their shoes so they did not move in the things that were promised but so i was talking last night to brother aaron and we were just talking about some different things and i was just telling him what my my what my direction i felt like to go because i told brother jack i said when i was at his house said you know brother jack i don't really know what to speak on i'm kind of in a tie between what i'm going to speak on so i was talking about their errands about some things and and um he was just saying you know the children of israel are like if we if we really think about it the children of israel are like us sometimes spiritually and and and they might have gotten satisfied with where they were at but and we get satisfied with the promise of the holy ghost we get satisfied with sanctification justification all these things and when we tend to not move forward into the promise that god has for us and we and we get so complacent that we forget what other things are ahead we we we get so caught up in well i like like i said earlier i like where i'm at but we tend to get complacent to not move forward into greater things and i i believe that the thing that some of the children of israel they didn't want to move on into the promised land it's mind-blowing to think that you were promised a land of all these things a land flowing of milk and honey a land but there's solomon where there's no more hurt no more no more sorrow but they were promised something and they didn't want to move into a promise think about that now they they liked where they were at and they did not want to move forward into a promise it's crazy to think but if you really if you really think about it we're like that we we get we we have a promise of a rapture and we get so complacent and where we're at that we tend to forget about our rapture we cannot forget about what god has ordained for us to obtain and i would say don't be like the children of israel but push forward press the mark as it says here in philippians press the mark amen so many times we're also like lot's wife and and and we look back to what's behind us and and i was thinking about law and she's just it's it's interesting that you know god would come down with a messenger and mess some messengers and tell her hey look you know tell law and his law and his wife and his family hey you know the judgment is coming i would say to you to to leave so they leave but what they did they did the opposite of what the messenger had told them to do so now they did the opposite of what the messenger told them to do a lot his wife had looked back and and and and one of the key things that the messenger told don't look back don't look back even for a moment but what they did they did not follow the messenger's word and she disobeyed what the messenger's word was and she turned into a pillar of salt and god said it and and god has a provided way in 62 says god with his messenger told lot and his wife and the children don't even look back and lot's wife with her own children and grandchildren burning in the judgments of god a mother just turned her head slightly looked back and she was cursed to a pillar of salt he says you've got to keep every word of it speaking now of the messengers you've got to keep every single word of it man shall not live by bread alone said jesus but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so i would say you know a prophet has come he has he has given us an outline of what we should do and and why are we disobeying still why are we still here in in this in this place where you know the prophet has come he has brought a message he has brought a word that has been vindicated it's not what the baptists have or the pentecostals have or what or the catholics have but it has been vindicated by the word and and why are we looking back why are we doing what the total opposite of what the messenger has come to tell us what to do why are we not why are we not doing what he's saying we're disobeying what the word of the lord is but she heard the cry of her children and looked back and but no matter how hard the cry of this person is no matter how hard the cry of your family is no matter how high come and cry i'm loud and the cry of um let's say um um a church member we're just gonna we're just gonna get down and and just preach but no matter how hard the cry of a church member is i would say don't look back don't look to what they're saying like i said we're not moved by the word of a critic we're not moved by the words of an unbeliever but what we're moved by is the power and the action of the holy ghost we are moved by almighty god so don't stop for one moment but keep moving forward and keep pressing on with truth the devil was always trying to remind us of a past and trying to get us to look back but i believe that it's time that we forget about our past forget about whoa but the things that you had you know it's funny brother jack you think about it some people tend to never forget about their past they're always looking back it's like well that person hurt me and even though they uh they asked for forgiveness and and and this person this person did this and that church member did that and or even you can bring it down to the pastor you know our pastor back at home is talking about how you've been hurt by church members we've been hurt but if if it's under the blood why are we continuing to look back at things that are supposed to be forgotten why are we looking back at things that are supposed to be no more and i would say that it's not it's not time to look back at your past it's not time to look back at the things that are under the blood but move forward if you think about it you know the lord says he would put the thing his our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and and and we but we in ourselves as humans have a hard time forgetting what we did but i would say if it's under the blood try and forget it it's hard it's it's difficult to try and forget the things that you've done but if it's under the blood if it's on in the sea forgetfulness i would say don't look at what the past was but look ahead going forward amen do you believe that and and the end result of moving forward is to be with the lord and and and the devil is is trying to test you and he tests us daily and he's trying to pull you but we have a promise we have a promise to be somewhere greater than this earth and the pressure is so real i i believe that that that um we are living in age where as a young person just speaking from experience we're living in an age where pressure is so great pressure is so real and i think the past few months i've never felt pressure like i have in my own life but but when god is bringing pressure sometimes i believe he's trying to press something out as well if you think about uh a grape here for a minute um or uh um um on olive yes thank you and all of here it's pressed to bring the oil out so when a pressure comes or our test comes it's not it's not it's not coming so that you can just be defeated but what it's coming is is a teach you something something to bring you oil so so so i would say this morning let the oil of god get pressed let you let your olive be pressed let your life be pressed that everything of the world is out every idea of yourself is out but let the power of god oh hallelujah at the power of god come into your life and press everything out but let god reign in your life i believe that but also i believe that god is looking when he's when a test comes or a trial comes he's looking at your reaction think about this now brother brian i'm going to say a reaction to an act an action he says and when you're put under a test when you're fixing to be used by god for a testimony like the lady here in the wheelchair the man a little boy some of you people out there maybe you're christians and wonder why you're put under this test god's fixing the user if you use you for a testimony but he wants to see how you react so he might put pressure on if you blow up well then he can't do anything with you but if you hold on stand the test if you hold on stand the test god will use you so so i would say hold on stand the test keep marching forward amen that's the promise that we have is to move forward into a promise stand the test as the wind blows the trials come and that the critics say what they want to say but i would say sand strong stand still and see the power of god move in your life oh hallelujah the greatest testimony i believe is when a bunch of pullbacks from their jack are coming around you there's a bunch of naysayers and backbiters but when you stand for something when you stand for truth while everyone around you is backing down i believe that's a quiet testimony do you believe that that is a real testimony they're standing in an age where everyone is not looking for truth but to stand in an age for truth that's a testimony but brother brian would say in the countdown as well he would say i gotta hurry here he would say that the bride will not fail because she is pressurized so it's so so so the bride will not fail because she's pressurized brother troy we are pressurized this morning we are we we are we are not we are not under something a message that has not been vindicated but the lord this morning has vindicated something he is giving us the word to pressurize us amen like i said the winds may come but you're pressurized stand strong and see the power of god move amen we are pressurized and i just want to i just want to speak here now but i have only a few more minutes and i'm trying to hurry but because i want to give brother zion as much time as he needs so so um there's a lot of people lately i think this has been one of the um this has been on the seasons where um i was talking to their brother and he said you know as a young minister he was coming to this place where everyone was criticizing this they were saying you know don't don't don't read the don't read the quotes don't read don't read anything the prophet says only read the bible but and there's been a lot of people coming to me and they're trying to tell me that the message isn't right or the message is in this or the message isn't right because it isn't fitting their own beliefs it isn't fitting their own doctrine and and that's just been something i've been dealing with these past few months but but the message of the hour as i was thinking the other neighbor jack just studying the message of the hour is not subject to our opinion it's not subject to anyone's opinion nobody nobody has a say in what the message said do you believe that it's not subject to your own opinions the message of the hour has been proven after time after time after time it's vindicated so why are you trying to put your own opinion in it why are people trying to try to trying to have it fit their own belief that's not what it's here to do what it's here to do is help you move forward into something and to a promise and and like i said it's not subject to their opinions this is not a fake we this is this church is not built off of something that's fake but this this church i believe is built off of truth it's in the name spirit and truth tabernacle it's built off of something when the winds blow when everything comes against it it's standing on something and that something is truth you're not standing on a dead word or a dead denomination or a decree but what you're standing on is truth this morning and i believe the message is not here to carry a bunch of pullbacks and a bunch of quitters through a rapture but the message is here to carry a believer the bride to a rapture amen to carry them home to where they belong amen is this all right just for a few minutes here do you i wonder if we if we recognize that this message is christ christ has been revealed in this message you can't find christ in a dead system as i said earlier you can't find them in in in ideas but what you can find them in is in truth what you can find them in is this message and i believe we have a vision um aaron i believe we have a vision this morning that we are not under something that's that's um that's dead but we are under something that is true we're under a vision from the lord and if this message had no vision there would be no power behind it so think about this now if you're saying there's no power in this message then then what is the message but all i can see brother jack is that there has been power in this message time after time after time in my young life i've seen god move in this message he has moved in my life he's moved to my family's life because why there's power in the message amen because we are we are under a message with a vision and and this is not a buildup of emotions or ideas but it's a vision from the lord and and this message is not about brother branham opinion or what he has to say but this message is about the lord jesus christ and what he came to say through a prophet to reveal it to you amen are you thankful for that this morning that that he revealed it to you and then he chose you to speak to you amen i believe that but this message is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i believe that this message is here to carry us into a promise oh my hallelujah but i want to think it now as we just continue on children of israel caleb and joshua they didn't stop listening to what people had to say around them and they didn't listen they didn't have to stop to hear what people had to say about moses you really think about that they didn't stop to hear what other people had to say about moses you think about that well you know you know joshua i think we should just wait a minute before we move forward because it's kind of just moses opinion and his idea and his thought but but they didn't stop to listen to what they had to say but they were moving forward into something that was much greater amen and and because because people i always want to tie it down i'm trying to tie this down here people will come to joshua and caleb and you can just imagine here they'll say well you know the message of moses is not fitting my own opinion so i don't know if i can believe it but but or maybe this is another thing the message of moses isn't focusing on what it's really about it isn't focusing on christ so there's a lot of people around you saying well the message of the hour is not focusing on christ but i would say what it what is this focus then all i can see is that the message has been focused around christ it has been revealed by christ oh my but joshua and caleb did not did not stop for a moment but they kept on marching they knew that moses that god has spoke to moses had given them a promise to obtain a land so they kept pushing because they knew that it would all be worth it but they were going to a promise but i just want to tie this down out to move forward into something you must have a vision to have a vision in order to have in order to to have a vision you must move forward into something you must move forward into a vision and and hebrews 11 verse 8 and the 10th chapter and if you can just put that up there for me and just leave it up there for a few moments here he said it says by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should go after receive for an inheritance inheritance obeyed and he went out and not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as an estranged country dwelling in the tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise but he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god so notice abraham was called out to go forward to receive an inheritance he was he was called to go into a a an inheritance of a promised land so he sojourned in this slam so i i believe that abraham had a vision and and we are we are in a message this morning or as i said with a vision and brother branham here would say this is the sign of the answer he says you know the pyramid pyramid never was capped the headstone is yet to come it's been rejected could it be brother and sisters or is this that the third poi speaking about the third pool now and tying into how the second pool is now transitioning into the third pool but he says or is this that the third pool that he told me three or four years ago the first boy you remember what happened i tried to explain it he said don't do that the second boy said don't try and i pull it anyhow you remember that all of you remember it's on the tape and everything then he said now there's a third pool coming but don't try to explain it so everyone try to stop what was going on they try to stop what brother branham was saying but he says don't try to explain it you see how i approach this tonight i don't know but i feel duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusions now but that the mystery that would be opened up that would bring christ bring a power to the church so i i want to speak on this for a moment he says now with this be the mystery that would open up that would bring christ bring a power to the church so notice in this quote that people are were looking for the power of christ they were looking for a vision they were looking for christ and his powers but they didn't want to listen to what a prophet had to say they they they wanted all the powers of christ in their church but they didn't want to listen to what he had to say and and but but we have heard him this morning talk about a vision we've heard him talk about the third pull it's come and he was saying a paradox in 61 it says it was about three o'clock in the morning and it was actually about three o'clock in the morning last night when i actually the lord places on my heart so i think this is ordained but it was about three o'clock in the morning i suppose i got up and i talked i looked where in front of me and i was coming down to the jordan looked like i was standing on the map of palestine and i was coming down to the jordan and seemed like all i could hear the song was i'm going down to the jordan somewhere someone was singing it and i drew near the river i looked back and seen which a way i had come and i was two-thirds of the way there to the jordan two-thirds of of of of the pools to three pools two-thirds of the way there stick with me now i know this is gonna get confusing but just stick with me two thirds of the way there three pulls and he said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land so the second pool now is transitioning into the third pool and when he said when he's talking about this and and that in the third pool is where every single promise lays and this morning the word has been fulfilled the third pool has been vindicated it has been brought to us every promise is in the third pool every promise is before you this morning amen let me continue on this now as i'm just talking about these things but the prophet would go on to say in the anointing once at the end times he says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he but he belongs begins to declare his message just think about this now this is this is this is something when he begins to declare his message see the first pool healing second paul prophesying third pool the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to be revealed in the word then the prophets oh my but they only the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word so remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth and that days sealed in the word do you see it it is then and this day when this thing is to take place that janus and jamborees the impersonators will appear again just like they did in the days of moses they appeared with the original word to say they appeared to impersonate it so this morning let the janus and jamborees come let them come and say and try to impersonate the word and let the critic come and the unbeliever come but we are not moved as i said earlier about the by the word of the critic but we're moved by the word of the lord amen we are moved by god and as i said this this um the saints of from out the ages have been waiting for this moment they've been waiting for the vision to be fulfilled and and they're now over there in heaven but they're jacking their and they're and they're watching the vision be fulfilled we're in the vision we are standing in the vision and and brother branham would say here as i'm just wrapping this up look where jesus said so now i am going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along that this that the thing that we've been looking forward to for so long for at least many years for five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been vindicated and i am sure you all know what that is and in revelation 10 7 it says but in the days as we just as we just read here early at the beginning but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished and he shall declare to his servants the prophets so so when people ask why do you believe in a prophet why do you believe in the mysteries because it is in the word it has been revealed revelations 10 7 the third pool the mystery had been vindicated were in the vision and it's time for jack to step into the vision amen do you believe that we're not we are moving forward into this vision keep on stepping forward into the vision keep marching forward into the vision that has been vindicated by the word and he said what is this attraction on the mount so i've got my mind set on this message do you have your mind set on this message this morning that's the third pool it's that one i must be loyal and reverent to so so so he says he has his mind set on the message and he must be loyal and reverent to but listen to this by faith he's so adjourned in the land of promise as an estranged country and going back here in hebrews dwelling in the tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had no foundations whose builder and maker is god so he's looking for a city whose builder and maker is god we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is god i just wanna i just hope this encourages you this morning to keep marching forward keep pressing forward and to step into the vision keep stepping keep keep on your step don't get out of line but keep marching forward into the promise amen god bless you god bless you brother jack let's give the lord another hand of praise um i just noticed brother caleb um did something that i i do he has a little timer that he put on his phone uh for um for ministering is this mine of yours okay uh and uh and i love that i like i i he you know i like when when ministers can do two things bring us some truth and follow directions that mean a lot to me that that shows you trustworthy when they're in the pulpit and and and i'm sitting here blowing away a 17 year old brother talking us about this third pool all right and stepping into a vision i say well praise god uh you know this you know i i'm as i was sitting there i was just thinking i want my daughter sarah to just come um she's going to sing a song for us amen this morning but uh but there as i'm sitting there looking at it it came back to my mind you know we talked about this the fourth generation because what happens is that when it gets to the fourth generation brother branham tells us that they're just embers uh actually no no vestige of the flame no vestige of the original flame and it says uh you know when you get there it looks like a very sad state and and we've seen that uh some of the younger ministers amen that were under us and uh getting caught up in what the brother was talking about right caught up in the nonsense right i mean you know it's not based on your opinion this message was vindicated before i was born right you know so so so but it was it was a spirit that we need to recognize that comes into the land and it attacks a particular generation right that that's that's that's the thing that we didn't catch it's a spirit attacking a generation and they get they get caught underneath that spirit but we've been told press right press through the midst of all of that don't look to this and don't look to that but press through that right and that's what we're doing and then i look here because at the end of that quote brother branham says no vestige of the original flame and then they put a period there and the next statement is then god lights the fire again when i'm looking at young men like this coming up i say the fire has been lit again oh my god is good moving forward in the promise god bless you brother caleb we we really appreciate that amen on today i asked my daughter to um just if y'all just get her a chair and put it right there i certainly appreciate it here you go take this one if this one you got it all right let's give her a chair and get get the microphone set up right there in front of her and that she'll be all set amen thank y'all so much um so she's going to play this song for us and then after a man she does this special we will be hearing from brother zion amen glory to god [Music] god bless you pray for me it's been a while since i've played so hold on let's do this before you get started

know i get old the little things mean a lot to you y'all make some noise and on the on the guitar make noise on the piano make make some noise you used to tell them stop all that noise then not make some noise we just we just appreciate the lord uh as brother zion amen prepares to come i i did want to make mention uh the lord it's just been a blessed weekend and um and and i started the weekend of on friday night uh with a double blessing uh brother marquise and sister jemima were baptized amen um glory to god hallelujah and um they they told me that they um the july they celebrated eight years of marriage eight years in marriage [Applause] i already know he i know he know what it meant eight is the number of new beginnings and for both of them to be baptized amen and on the 16th day of the month that's two eighths i didn't i saved that for you brother marquis so i didn't give you that but brother marquis said i got an eight-year-old that wears size eight and i'm getting baptized i see you brother marquise hallelujah but uh but god is moving in the midst of his people and we're we're just excited about what he's doing amen so just something softly maybe again go back to that first song that amen that that we start out the service let's just stand let's welcome a man brother zion even uh to the pulpit um he is um um i mean all i can say is my my one of my dearest friends uh brother trevor and and and and i know some of the talks that me and brother trevor has had just over the years he's you know he's been just a man that has spoken to my life and i believe i've also been the same to him and and um but to to see uh one of the fruits of a decision that he made some time ago and see the fruit of his decision coming forth here uh because this is a a pull pit where we say brother brother trevor uh cut some teeth put it that way this is one of those pull pulpits now his son has come and we're honored to have him come and amen and preach for us hallelujah so i believe that i will see hallelujah the goodness of the lord [Music] [Applause] your faithfulness remains [Music] as seasons change your faith remains one more time [Applause] [Music] and i believe that i will see [Music] amen amen good to be good to be back here once again and fellowship with you all um thank you musicians uh thankful for the message that brother caleb just brought there towards the end i was like well brother get out of my notes it's like you gotta leave something for me to preach here i was just gonna tag me in is it my turn yet and now i'm up here and i'm like oh boy it's now it's my turn so just pray for me that the lord would uh help me get myself out of the way and i wouldn't be too nervous about this and be able to just bring what the lord has placed on my heart if we could turn to matthew chapter 26 verse 36 through 44 so i'd like to open today hey man you love the lord in verse 36 matthew chapter 6 26 36 says then jesus then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here will i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tear ye here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed a third time saying the same words we could all just bow our heads for a word of prayer lord jesus i pray you would just add the blessings to the reading of your word father and just help me to be able to get myself out of the way this morning lord and bring what you've laid on my heart lord i pray that it would be a blessing to the people lord and it be worked for the edification of the saints father lord praise you bless brother caleb lord for the message that he just brought and just feed him and guide him lord and just uh be with us throughout the rest of the service this morning we pray that you would just bless it lord we pray in jesus name amen so my title this morning is called the darkest day of your life don't worry it's not quite as sad and gloomy as it sounds but that's what i want to title it because this verse we just read talks about the darkest day of jesus's life and many times we would think of the darkest point of jesus's life as when he was on the cross and you could say that but this point in the garden of gethsemane was really when the defining moment came where that was what decided whether he was going to go to the cross or not so that was really where his darkest most intense moment was was in the garden of gethsemane brother branham says in a conference with god in 1959 he says after after the supper that night they crossed over a little brook said drenin or somewhere and went across the brook and went into a garden called gethsemane they they had to have a conference god and christ had to talk it over the lamb and the dove had to sit together it was the dove that had to talk to the lamb and it was the lamb's death then a little farther down the same quote he says and in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow he was under a strain the sins of the world it was upon him and then he looked into the face of the dove and said not my will but thy will be done so this was jesus's you could say the man jesus his defining moment where every part of him was fully surrendered in the in the man part of jesus we know he was fully man and fully god but the man part of jesus still had to die to the spirit so just as each one of us we often talk about a back side of the desert experience and going out and meeting god just like moses did and the message becoming real to us and jesus becoming real to us and us having experience and being filled with the holy ghost and knowing that god is real and that we have an experience and that nothing can ever separate us or or convince us away from our experience with god just as we all have to have that kind of experience all of us who have had that experience will then come to a similar garden of gethsemane experience as jesus had where our backside of the desert experience is put to the test and we're going to see how much we really died to ourselves and god's going to show us hey you're not quite dead yet there's still some of you that might be kicking and screaming a little bit so we have to have that same conference with god that jesus did where we can say lord not my will but thy will be done often what gets us to this point is some trials that will make us realize there's still some flesh i need to deal with and so many times a trial would come and we would have a really difficult time with it often in a very intense trial it might feel like like what have we done wrong to deserve this trial or we feel like god has just left us and left us with this trial and you know that it's our fault or we've done something horribly wrong or why would he do this to us but really what it is god wants to show us something like just brother caleb was talking about when the when the graves are pressed and when the olives are pressed it's because he wants to bring something out of them amen so when the pressure comes it's not because god's mean or god wants to just throw us out on our own but really what it is there's something in us that god really wants to bring out so what it is is it's god's plan to bring us to perfection if you never had any trials in your life how would you ever grow closer to the lord if everything came easy and everything was just a flowery bed of ease there'd be no need to grow because you could just have everything right then and you'd have never have to work for something make sure i don't get ahead of myself here that's towards the end but um so even though we may not realize that god is always teaching us something specific through each trial right so if we look at different stories of different people in scripture that had trials we can see there's a there's a common pattern that is similar among some of those stories so for example i'm going to look at jesus story and joseph's story so in the story of jesus he starts along in his journey and everything's going fine he goes and he's baptized by john he starts his ministry there's a little bit of adversity with the pharisees you know but generally and then there's miracles and then everything seems to be going really well and his ministry is going along great but then it comes down to the real trial so his his ministry's been going a long great it's been three and a half years and then he gets to gethsemane when the real point the maker break point is coming and then after that make a break point then he goes down to the cross then after the cross we see he descends down to hell where it's you can't get any lower than that and then he puts the devil in his place while he's down there and then ascends back up to heaven with the keys of death in hell so we see that you know it started off well and then right before the right right at the defining moment was the biggest trial he had ever went through in his life i never would go through and then we see that he rises back up out of that trial stronger than he was before because he rises back up to heaven that darkest hour is really when the death of jesus happened the death of jesus the man jesus was not on the cross the death of the man jesus was in gethsemane because after gethsemane there was no man part of jesus left to to fight with the spirit not not to not to diminish the fact that jesus was fully god as we believe but just there was still a flesh part about him that he had to make sure was fully dead if we look at if we look at joseph's story we see the same thing can happen there it starts off well he had he had some dreams his father was happy with the dreams until his father was included in one of the dreams then he wasn't quite as happy about it uh but we see it started off fairly well you know but then his brothers aren't too happy with the dreams either and then they sell him into slavery you know and so then he goes to potiphar's house and it's not too great but he gets promoted to the top potiphar's house so it's he's he's doing okay he's doing okay then it really comes and he gets thrown into jail potiphar's wife accuses him and he's thrown into jail can't get much lower than he actually is but while he's in jail while he's down there at his lowest moment something in there happens that later allows him to rise and become second to fair if it hadn't been for what happened in the jail where he was able to interpret the dreams of the baker and the butler pharaoh would have never known about his gift he would have never had the practice with his gift to be able to exercise it maybe he wouldn't have been as good when as as as good at getting himself out of the way and using that gift when he needed to interpret pharaoh's dreams so we recognize that in those darkest trials we get something that holds us and gives us and equips us with what we need and all throughout joseph's story we see in potiphar's house he was promoted and he learned how to manage potiphar's house in the jail he went down to the jail but then he was promoted in the jail and he learned how to manage jail and get figure out how to get that working smoothly and how to get all the business running correctly and if he hadn't learned any of that it would have been a lot more difficult for him when he had to basically run all of egypt in that time he learned the skills he would later need in his life when he needed to basically rule egypt the lord the lord had blessed him with wisdom that was beyond himself we recognize this but still he learned and got the experience throughout those trials and dark times that he needed to be able to better to be able to better run egypt later in his life in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 13 it says every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so we realize that when we go through the fire it really reveals what we are and what our character is the fire revealed what sort of character these two men had when jesus went into the garden it revealed that jesus was the son of god and that he was able to get himself out of the way when joseph went through the fire in potiphar's house and in the prison it revealed that he had something on the inside of him that god had placed the seed down on the inside of him that he had very godly character because otherwise if he'd went if he had went through the uh the fire and not reacted well and been very angry and upset at his brothers why would he have been promoted one of the sermons my dad often preaches he tells the story he goes and throws and tells the story of joseph and he's just like and joseph is sold into slavery he gets into potiphar's house when he's on the slave market and potiphar goes to buy him and he goes he sees joseph and joseph is just sitting there like this so angry at my brothers can't believe they did that to me and that's why potiphar of course really wanted he's like i like this slave there's something different about this slave there's something different no that's not what it was with joseph because through the fire it revealed what character he had similar with sitting in the jail he wasn't just sitting in the jail on the rock going can't believe this has happened to me this is dumb i just this is terrible nothing is ever good everything is terrible no because then the jailer looks at him and sees him in that state and goes yes i want you to run the prison no we can see that he had a good attitude throughout this because the fire revealed what sort of character he had in the same way in the in a similar way with job it revealed what sort of character job had when job went through all his trials we see that there was something real on the inside of job often god knows how strong we are god always god knows everything he knows our character he knows what will happen but he often wants us to recognize that as well we don't often realize just how strong we are to be able to handle a trial so then god will allow something to come into our lives to show us just how strong we are the fire revealed what sort of character that the three hebrew children had quite literally they went through the fire and we saw that they weren't going to bow that through the fire through it all they would still stand for the lord so we see that in every person every one of these persons lives there was a defining moment where they had a very dark day it was the darkest day each of those times god planned that darkest day for each one of them god plans everyone's darkest day he planned joseph's darkest day when he was thrown into prison he planned jesus darkest day when he would be in gethsemane and on the cross and he'll plan yours and he knows he knows through that he has determined what will happen in that moment where it will give you what you need to go through life and he has equipped you for that darkest day he's not going to plan that darkest day and send you to it without any preparation you'll have preparation before that when you get there you will have what you need so looking at good friday the darkest day for jesus we recognize that was a terrible day it was the worst day in history i can't think you can't think of anything else you could say that would be worse than good friday where they literally killed the son of god but that was necessary that day was absolutely necessary if it wasn't for good friday we wouldn't have had the day of pentecost if it wasn't for good friday we would not have had the many outpourings of the holy ghost later because jesus had to die and we wouldn't if it hadn't been for good friday all of us would still be in sin and there would be no blood for us so often we go through dark times and we wonder why is this happening to me but sometimes those times are necessary that we can have an experience with the lord sometimes those times are necessary to equip us in our lives uh talking to my dad about when i was studying a bit over the past few weeks for this and gave me a line that he had been he had written down one time and he hadn't had a chance to use it yet so he said i could use it as long as i as as long as i as long as i cited where i got it from so he said the divine plan of god worked flawlessly on good friday and it was glorious looking back that's what we see about good friday that's not what the disciples felt like on saturday sitting there on saturday often it's more than just the one experience that's the one trial often the trial lasts a while and there's lasting effects of that trial you're sitting under the middle of that trial just almost despairing going how am i ever going to come through this how am i ever going to come out of this imagine the disciples on saturday they must have been on the verge of doubting everything they must sitting there going they've killed jesus i thought he was the one i don't understand if he was really the son of god would he have let them kill him like that and but they so they were sitting there going i don't understand and they needed something because at that point this the holy spirit hadn't come back yet so they were sitting there waiting going god what is your plan what is going on but then sunday came and they realized okay i understand now this is why that had happened then the day of pentecost came and they realized oh it's been a long time and i've gotten i've gotten through that trial but now now i really understand why that had to happen so i could have this experience right now if it wasn't for good friday i wouldn't have been able to get the holy ghost like i am right now in the upper room amen so um let's see here in the resurrection of lazarus brother in 1951 brother branham speaking of lazarus he says and so the breadwinner was gone then dark time the second day passed they went to the grave and mourned the third day passed the fourth day passed corruption sets in 72 hours three days and nights the skin worms was working through his body all hopes was gone darkest hour the little family had ever seen did you ever hit that hour i've hit it in our home loved ones be taken away in darkness darkest hour the little family had ever seen and then jesus comes along he usually comes along when the darkest hour when it's the darkest hour he's not going to leave you alone in the darkest hour sometimes at the beginning of it it'll feel like you're alone because god needs you to realize something about yourself and something that needs to die inside of you still and how that you still need to trust him he's going to sometimes leave you somewhere just where you just need to learn to trust him [Music] um i don't have this one exactly in my notes i did this at i did this at home so some of the ones visiting from here have kind of seen this demonstration before uh but i think i'm hopefully it'll be a little bit different of an angle i'm gonna sit at the piano and do a little something here so hopefully this works out well i'm gonna use this orange mic if that's okay i need both my hands praise the lord we'll get this figured out okay so many times in the dark times of our lives we don't realize why they're there and so let's take this for example say this is a dark time that sounds terrible there's certain there's certain intervals on the piano they sound terrible ow why [Music] like why some if you if i would just sit there and play those intervals you would go you would go why are you playing these these sound terrible what is the point of these what if i was to play you'd never know that there was a lot of those intervals in that they were necessary to make the whole story that much more beautiful we get there and we sit there and sometimes we're playing and we hit something in our lives and we don't understand why and it sounds awful but then god works it out that's the way it was meant to be the whole time and maybe in the moment you don't realize it it sounds terrible and you're sitting there going why god is my life this way why has this happened but then god works it back around into his plan and it was his plan the whole time working out in his perfect way to where you may not have known during the time when it hit just why it was there [Music] but then when it works out the way god intended it to the whole time you recognize there was a reason for that trial and there was a reason that god had placed that in my life you know and think about think about uh lazarus and mary and martha after in the dark time after lazarus is dead and they're sitting there for three four days waiting on jesus going when is jesus gonna come and help us through this trial i feel so alone i feel forsaken but then jesus comes he never actually left them forsaken he just knew that they needed some time to sit and think about it for a little while but then he came and it was that much better because he waited do you think after that experience they ever doubted especially lazarus you think he ever doubted who jesus was mary and martha their brother was dead and in the grave for four days and then comes walking out do you think they ever doubted who jesus was after that experience so we recognize that all these things are for our perfection um brother wendell martin he was preaching in uh in virginia i think was about a month ago a month and a half something like that and he he said this and it really struck me and it kind of was the central building point for this sermon was he says he said the scar in adam's side was a must to bring out the perfection with eve the scar in jesus side was a must to bring out our perfection so we recognize that these scars many times the scars in our lives are a must to bring out the perfection you know we go over in the scars the scars in our life are the must to bring out the perfection of what it's supposed to be think of michelangelo's moses sculpture it wasn't perfect until after he struck it he shouted speak moses and put the scar in the knee then it was perfect brother branham talks about the stories of the gold beaters beating the gold in in 1957 and why some people can't keep the victory he says in the bible times when the gold beater used to be they used to take the gold before they had the smelters and the beater would beat the gold turn it over beat it and beat it till they beat all the dross out of it and how he knew that it got down to really good gold all the pyrite and fool's gold and so forth was beat out of it the beater could see the reflection of himself in it then he knowed he had it clean listen my dear friends today the holy spirit which is the beater will beat the church with the gospel till the reflection of jesus christ shines into the church then she's pure again that's right we've got too much pyrite and copper and other things in us yet so many times this is what the dark times of our trials are it's just god showing hey there's still some of your flesh in the way and we've got to get your flesh out of the way and he wants us to be more like him so that it may not be great when we're when we're sitting there the gold getting beat over and over but then how great is it when we when all the dross is beat out of us all the pyrite is gone and we just are a perfect reflection of jesus christ and the church age book in the late ocean church age brother branham says but there is a gold of god first peter 1 7. that is the tr that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold so when brother branham speaks of the gold it's our christ-like character it takes being tried in the fire to produce that character i was looking up this morning of how how that they would go about refining gold and they take the gold um sometimes people will will sell their gold jewelry or things or any old watches or whatever um to to be repurposed and they'll sell them and so what they'll do is they'll go and they'll take them and they'll melt it down they have to because when it's crafted when the gold is crafted into those different different things the the jewelry or whatever it is mixed with other things so when the refiners have to go and get the gold back out of it to remake it into something they have to put it in a furnace they have to heat it up a lot because then when it's heated up to the melting point all the other metals just separate away they will melt away and the gold will melt away and they'll separate so that it's just you have you're left with the pure gold in the ephesian church age in the church age book brother branham says but not only is the candlestick of gold is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the sufferings that christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she's killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life often this is really difficult to recognize the trials of our life as a joy especially in the trial it's really difficult sometimes you're in the trial and you're getting beat it's really difficult to recognize this as a joy but then when we realize it was god forming us and we look back through the trial and i see i was that way before the trial and then the trial came and now i am that much closer to christ because of how i've been molded on this side of the trial on this way over here i was a little farther from christ i had some more of my flesh still in me but then i went into the trial and it was terrible and my flesh did not enjoy this trial one bit but god was there and he was cutting away at the flesh getting more and more removed from me now over here i am that much closer to god think of the hebrew children what happened when the hebrew children went into the furnace their bonds fell off when were the hebrew children the freest when they were in the fire they were bound before they went into the fire then they went into the fire and their captors died and they were free through the fire after they came out of the fire i really doubt their captors tried to bind them and throw them back in their bonds fell off in the fire but many so many times this happens and we get into trial and we just many times our flesh just wants to shrivel up and go oh it's so terrible god god doesn't even love me why should i even try anymore this trial is so terrible i've been praying for two weeks and nothing has changed why what it really is is god does love you and he wants to teach you some patience or he wants to teach you some virtue that you need more of and because he knows what your character is and what your weak spots are so he wants to strengthen your weak spots because sometimes sometimes we're not just delivered right off the bat of something sometimes we have to fight through to get the victory because we need to learn something in the marriage of the lamb in 1962 brother branham says but that's up to you see you've got something to do too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that over to come you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready i like that word you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome you just pushed he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i've got to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god so god's not just gonna push us through the trials come on this side say here's the trial okay here go into this trial okay here i'm gonna take you out you really didn't spend any time in the trial but you got through the trial no he's gonna put us in there and then we've gotta get to a place to where we trust god and we say lord in your good timing i know i'll get through this trial we're not we're not all just babies that god's going to push along in life through a stroller we're not just sitting in there letting god push us along we've got to grow up we make maybe we'll start in our christian walk and we'll start there but then we have to learn to walk and god expects us to go and walk a little bit ourselves maybe we may trip and fall a little bit as we're learning to walk but then god will just pick us back up and say here my child i'll help you i'll help you learn to walk and then as we get better and better at it he allows us to just start walking and then as brother branham preaches on why christ speak we can just keep walking you can as brother caleb was saying you can walk right on into the promise why just sit stagnant and say i don't know what to do you can walk right on into the promise because god has picked you up and taught you how to walk when jesus healed the man at the pool of the bethesda he told him pick up your man and walk he didn't just he didn't just heal him but he healed him and gave him something to do so he could grow think of when we're in school um you don't just get you know you get a homework assignment or you get a test you don't just get all the answers right there you have to sit there and work through the answers yourself because if what happens if if i'm sitting there doing school and i don't know the answer to something i don't know the answer to this okay what's the answer to it okay cool that's the answer let me write that down real quick okay next one i have no idea what the answer this is answer okay if i'm just if i'm just looking in the teacher's manual and copying down the answers i'm never learning anything never learning a single thing and then one of these times i'm not going to have the teacher's manual and it's going to go very badly so we have to sit and we have to learn something through it that's why we go through tests brother branham says in uh in an exposition of the seven church ages he's in the philadelphia church age he says this is the way god teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but we could you would become even more impatient with life so we have to learn through the trials god has something specific to teach us through each trial through each dark day god has something specific to teach us so what we have to do is we have to not just look at the specific trial and where we're at right now and go this is difficult but we have to keep our eyes on the end like the brother like brother branham tells the story of the boy who was riding a bicycle on the board all the others fell off the board because they were got wobbly as they were riding along and they kept looking down at the board where they were at and they got wobbly and they fell off the board but what what what the secret was of the boy that was able to do it correctly he kept his eyes on the end and just kept riding he didn't worry about how close he was getting to the edge of the board he didn't worry about his his ability to stay perfectly straight he just kept his eyes on the end and rode right towards the end first corinthians 10 verse 13 says there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it he's not just going to leave you alone he will make a way of escape but you've got to learn and use that way of escape for yourself you've got to grow and find that way of escape he will help you through it but you've got to overcome one thing brother timothy pruitt said when i was hearing him preach recently he was saying the devil has limitations so our trials can only go so far until they reach the end god's love is unlimited there's no there's no i think i believe he said there's no summit to god's love it never reaches a peak but the devil on the other hand has limitations so there's only so far he can take a trial on us until it has to reach an end and then god will bring us out of it and we will have learned something in it and so thinking of the boy riding the bicycle and just keeping his eyes on the end that's what we have to do think of just imagine brother john andes was speaking on this and i i loved the way he put this think of so we're looking to the rapture that's what that's what we're looking to we're looking at the end we're looking to the rapture imagine the first five minutes in heaven after the rapture after all we've gone through every time we trip and fall we just keep looking towards the end towards the rapture after all of that then it finally happens and we've arrived on that great day and we realize it was worth everything because just imagine so the we we know that heaven will be worth everything we go through yeah so every time you go through a trial every time you trip and fall and then have to get back up that's just one more thing that heaven will be greater than every time you trip and you mount up another thing that i had to go through in this life okay here's the trial mount up another thing here's a trial i tripped mount up another thing heaven will be greater than however high you can stack that up so every time you add something that stack that's just that much greater that heaven is going to be for you so just imagine how great it's going to be and that's why we're going through all of this is so that we will develop that character in us that we need to go in the rapture and that is the end goal of it all isn't it so we can spend eternity with jesus amen thank you brother jack well well well god bless you brother zion god bless you you know uh yeah i have to say that if uh nobody else got anything today i got i got it all uh just different things that i was just talking to the lord about and you know just just being honest and when this opportunity to to uh go in and preach the gospel there in alaska there's you know i i i don't mind that but the things that i don't like is when uh sometimes you got little things going on at home that you just like god if you really wanted me to go do this everything would be fine here and everything be fine there but uh you know what we don't pick and choose our trials right we don't pick and choose nothing uh all this is an opportunity for you to go through some fires so we can see what's really on the inside of you right and uh so i'm sitting there and i'm like lord thank you for speaking to me uh today my attitude has changed you know my outlook has changed and uh you know i'm just gonna praise god right through the midst of of of of uh uh what i'm facing how many appreciate our precious brothers today [Applause] i
