[24:29] a man it's good to be able to come to
[24:35] the house of the Lord and times like
[24:39] this there's many churches that are
[24:44] being asked not to gather they have more
[24:48] than 200 or 250 people in the assembly
[24:53] they're asked being asked not to gather
[24:58] you know we take it for granted that we
[25:02] have the opportunity to come and they
[25:05] met in fellowship one with the other and
[25:06] you know we don't know when things may
[25:10] change the Prophet actually told us that
[25:14] there will come a time that they'll put
[25:15] padlocks on the doors and one allow us
[25:18] to be able to come into the house the
[25:21] Lord and you know so we want to take
[25:25] advantage of the moments and a many
[25:26] times that we have to come here to hear
[25:29] the word of God we don't want to just
[25:31] hear the word but we want to be doers of
[25:34] the word of God and man
[25:36] so we're blessed tonight they met we're
[25:39] blessed to be able to come in a man in
[25:42] sit in his presence tonight we have
[25:46] precious brother brother Ernie

[26:02] house brother Ernie at Villa nueva
[26:06] new house and we'll even got for a new
[26:11] house man I do a house of worship
[26:15] man so I just believe that the Lord has
[26:19] sent my precious brother this way for
[26:22] this weekend a man for such a time as
[26:26] this and trust in them we all come under
[26:29] expectation I know he'll minister for
[26:33] tonight and they'll minister for us on
[26:35] Sunday morning amen as long as the
[26:39] church doors remain open we gonna keep
[26:40] having church and you know if we grow to
[26:45] 250 then we ran but that would be a
[26:50] different issue right but they will
[26:52] think off for that but we're worse he's
[26:54] coming to us from a man who lives in
[26:57] Washington a state of Washington goes

[29:37] [Music]
[29:41] let's reach you tonight and the precious
[29:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I'd
[29:47] like to bring you greetings from my
[29:49] pastor brother ed mystical and from our
[29:52] assembly up in Cloverdale and elected
[29:56] have you be seated just for a moment I'd
[29:58] like to just make a couple of opening
[30:00] comments before we get to the word and
[30:05] it's such a privilege to live in the
[30:07] days that we live in and your pastor was
[30:12] highly recommended to me from brother
[30:15] Jason Watkins and his family and they
[30:17] told me that they couldn't believe that
[30:19] I was coming to Florida and I I had
[30:22] never been to brother Jack's Church so
[30:24] this has all been predestinated and my
[30:27] pastor brother Bisco has asked me to
[30:29] give special greetings he's never met
[30:32] brother jack but one day we're all going
[30:35] to be together and add this great
[30:37] supernatural journey that we're on right
[30:39] now it's just beginning and the
[30:42] wonderful thing about it that throughout
[30:44] all of eternity not for one second will
[30:47] you ever be bored you're not going to
[30:50] say oh well you know here it goes again
[30:52] or I've heard this before I've been here
[30:55] before
[30:56] though God is going to continue to be
[30:58] unfolding his greatness and his majesty
[31:01] throughout all of eternity and I'm so
[31:04] thankful for that
[31:05] I would like to start tonight before I
[31:08] read the word to give just a just a
[31:11] short excitation something that has
[31:15] always thrilled my soul and the story of
[31:18] the rich young ruler and you think about
[31:20] that man in the beginning of his life
[31:22] had a great pet pedigree so to speak
[31:25] rich young and a ruler but the greatest
[31:31] thing that man had was the opportunity
[31:33] to come face-to-face with the Lord Jesus
[31:35] Christ and when he did he asked the
[31:40] question and he asked exactly the right
[31:43] question
[31:44] from the only one who could give him the
[31:47] perfect answer he asked what must I do
[31:50] to inherit eternal life
[31:52] the most important question any man or
[31:56] any woman can ever ask
[31:58] and so Jesus beheld him and he loved him
[32:04] and he saw that money was going to
[32:06] become the god of the rich young ruler
[32:08] and so he told him go and sell
[32:11] everything you have and give it to the
[32:14] poor and come and be my disciple but the
[32:18] rich young ruler he could not wrap his
[32:20] mind around what Jesus was saying
[32:24] because all as he was thinking was I'm
[32:26] going to give up my privilege and my
[32:29] wealth and my pleasure and become a
[32:34] homeless man and so like everybody else
[32:41] the gospel will have one of three
[32:44] effects upon you it will make you mad or
[32:47] glad or sad and for the rich young ruler
[32:53] it made him very sad and he turned and
[32:57] walked away but that was not the end of
[32:59] the rich young ruler because through the
[33:01] eye of a prophet we see him in torment
[33:03] and he is able to see Abraham and
[33:06] Lazarus and he cries out for a couple of
[33:08] drops of water on his tongue but Abraham
[33:11] says no can't do that there's a great
[33:13] gulf fixed you cannot come here and he
[33:17] cannot go there he said in life you had
[33:22] everything he had nothing now he has
[33:25] everything and you have nothing but the
[33:29] rich young ruler was not finished yet
[33:32] because now he said well I have another
[33:35] plan let Lazarus mount a great
[33:40] evangelistic crusade and send him to my
[33:44] family and warn them that they don't
[33:47] come to this wicked place where I am
[33:50] but Abraham said no they have Moses they
[33:54] have the law and the prophets and if one
[33:57] rose from the dead still they would not
[34:01] believe now we can look back in
[34:04] hindsight and we can say how could that
[34:08] rich young ruler have missed the only
[34:12] supernatural opportunity he was ever
[34:14] going to have in his life but then I
[34:18] think of where we are our life and we
[34:23] have a much more up-to-date invitation
[34:26] than the richer ruler had because we
[34:30] have 2,000 years of vindicated ministry
[34:33] and at the end of that 2,000 years we
[34:36] have had Elijah the Prophet come and
[34:39] Jesus himself has done more in the life
[34:42] of his prophet that is even recorded in
[34:45] the entire Bible and we know not
[34:47] everything that Jesus said or done was
[34:49] recorded in the Bible but what was
[34:52] recorded in the Bible just in one
[34:54] meeting that this prophet had Jesus
[34:57] Christ revealed himself more than at any
[35:00] time and we now we have 1200
[35:05] supernatural miracles that God has given
[35:09] to us in the form of a message every one
[35:12] of them a masterpiece and we're the
[35:15] first generation that has ever had the
[35:18] voice of a prophet on tape that we can
[35:22] listen to you now I want to just just
[35:26] drop this in as a little thought we know
[35:30] that brother Branham was the voice that
[35:33] was going to come the days of the voice
[35:36] of the seventh angel when he begins to
[35:38] solve all the mysteries will be revealed
[35:41] as he had declared to his prophet the
[35:45] servant well 1947 the first message
[35:52] brother Branham ever spoke his faith is
[35:55] the substance
[35:58] the first seven words that brother
[36:01] branham ever spoke he said now we're
[36:05] getting some new gadgets for recording
[36:08] right now I'm sure that brother branham
[36:13] did not know what he was saying did not
[36:16] plan to say that he had no idea the
[36:18] depth in the scope and the magnitude of
[36:21] that voice that was gonna Thunder out
[36:23] from him and how it was going to reach
[36:25] all over the world or how it was going
[36:28] to reach all over the world because tape
[36:31] recorders was a brand new invention
[36:33] that's right it was in fact in those
[36:35] days it was a little wireless recorder
[36:37] and then it went to the casino went to
[36:40] the reel-to-reel then to think it said
[36:41] now that a CD now I was a brother a
[36:44] while ago
[36:44] he's got the whole message on his watch
[36:46] he just looks at his watch speaks to it
[36:49] and the one he tells to watch what
[36:50] message he wants to listen to a brother
[36:54] Jack your IT man you might be able to
[36:56] look into that kind of watching and see
[36:59] where that one comes from but friends
[37:02] this message this is a supernatural
[37:05] multiplication of inspiration and
[37:08] revelation for communication this
[37:11] message is the only thing in the world
[37:13] that sounds like it's too good to be
[37:16] true and yet we cannot even begin to
[37:19] plumb the depths of what God has done
[37:21] and brother Branham said I wonder if we
[37:25] are sufficiently impressed with what God
[37:28] has done in this generation and then
[37:31] later he says the reason that most
[37:33] people are not impressed is they don't
[37:36] get deep enough into the spirit when you
[37:41] look at the word supernatural brother
[37:43] Branham used that term 1362 times and in
[37:48] the beginning of his ministry especially
[37:51] when he had just been visited by the
[37:53] angel of the Lord who has told him if
[37:56] you can get the people to believe
[37:58] nothing will stand before you not even
[38:01] cancer so in the beginning brother
[38:03] Branham he he's so innocent and he's
[38:06] saying now he said now you know that
[38:08] this is this is not
[38:10] he's a it's the supernatural being and
[38:13] he uses that term over and over and he
[38:16] says supernatural life supernatural
[38:19] power super natural resource and he's
[38:22] always pointing to the angel of the Lord
[38:25] and he Anisha
[38:26] this is not me this is not a man you
[38:28] know just before we came to the to the
[38:31] pulpits and I brother Jack prayed a
[38:33] prayer that I always pray and that is
[38:35] that a man would not be seen that only
[38:38] the word only Jesus Christ would be
[38:40] glorified because all we are friend we
[38:43] are just a little speck of dust that God
[38:46] has temporarily quickened
[38:48] all right and allowed us to live on this
[38:51] earth before our next journey and so
[38:54] here we are we have the proof of the
[38:56] most privileged people on the face of
[38:58] the earth to know what we know and see
[39:01] what we see and to hear what we hear and
[39:04] brother Branham said we should be the
[39:06] happiest people on earth and that's my
[39:08] testimony today I am the happiest man
[39:11] you have ever met in your entire life so
[39:15] let's stand and I'd like to invite you
[39:17] to look into we're going to look at this
[39:20] the book of 2nd Peter and we're going to
[39:24] start reading at chapter 1 and verse 1
[39:28] and before we read let's pray father as
[39:38] we bow our heads tonight close our eyes
[39:43] in this unseen realm around us we know
[39:48] that there are supernatural beings
[39:49] present right in this building tonight
[39:53] and we know they are here to help out in
[39:56] the meetings we pray that you would have
[39:59] your perfect will done pray that you and
[40:01] bless the speaker and the hearer and let
[40:04] divine insight and wisdom strike the
[40:08] hearts of your children myself all so
[40:10] that we may walk in the power of your
[40:13] resurrection we ask this Lord we ask it
[40:16] with with great humility but also with
[40:19] great confidence for we ask it in
[40:22] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[40:24] amen
[40:27] second Peter chapter 1 and verse 1 Simon
[40:34] Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[40:37] Christ to them that have obtained like
[40:40] precious faith with us through the
[40:45] righteous of God and our Savior Jesus
[40:47] Christ
[40:48] Burak grace and peace be multiplied unto
[40:52] you you know anything that that's going
[40:56] to happen in our life we'd like for it
[40:59] to be multiplied anything good and so
[41:03] Peter is asking that grace and peace be
[41:07] multiplied unto you through the
[41:09] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[41:12] according as his divine power not a
[41:15] natural power not a human power and a
[41:18] divine power has given unto us a ll all
[41:24] things that pertain to Thunderer life
[41:27] and godliness through the knowledge of
[41:29] him that have called us to glory and
[41:31] virtue whereby are given unto us
[41:34] exceeding great and precious promises
[41:39] that by these ye might be partakers of
[41:43] the divine nature having escaped the
[41:46] corruption that is in the world through
[41:48] lust and beside this giving all
[41:51] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[41:54] to virtue knowledge and the knowledge
[41:55] temperance and the temperance patience
[41:57] and to patience godliness and to
[41:59] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[42:01] brotherly kindness charity for these
[42:04] things be in you and abound they make
[42:07] you that ye shall need to be barren nor
[42:09] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[42:12] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[42:14] things his blind and cannot see afar off
[42:18] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[42:21] from his old sins
[42:22] wherefore the rather brethren give
[42:24] diligence to make your calling and
[42:26] election
[42:27] sure for if you do these things you
[42:30] shall never fall Amen god bless you and
[42:34] you can have your seats I am so thankful
[42:41] for the opportunity that I've had to
[42:44] meet men of God around the world just a
[42:50] little quick testimony I started off as
[42:54] a young boy in the Roman Catholic Church
[42:57] I went nine years to Catholic school
[43:00] seven years as an altar boy and I was as
[43:04] intoxicated with Roman Catholicism as
[43:07] anybody you could have ever met in your
[43:09] life stellen brother Jack and brother
[43:12] Quentin my life as a young boy consisted
[43:15] of praying to Mary because we couldn't
[43:17] pray to Jesus saints angels holy water
[43:20] candles scapula's novenas all that all
[43:24] the the doctrines of the system that the
[43:28] great wanted to instill in this
[43:31] young mind and anybody who ever escapes
[43:34] from that like myself it is a miracle of
[43:37] God and and so then I'd backslidden it's
[43:41] almost an oxymoron to say that you
[43:43] backslide from the highest form of
[43:45] spiritualism there is on planet Earth
[43:48] but that's what brother Branham said the
[43:50] Catholic system was and and I left the
[43:52] blizzard in 1973 and I arrived 24 hours
[43:56] later I arrived in Daytona Beach the
[44:00] week before the Daytona 500 and I didn't
[44:03] know what a Daytona 500 was because we
[44:05] only had demolition derbies and quarter
[44:08] mile er so a hundred thousand people
[44:10] descend on this little town and the next
[44:12] week they here comes the bikers and
[44:14] after that spring break and as a young
[44:17] boy back slid you know with without
[44:19] knowing God I thought I was in heaven
[44:21] and I had no idea the depths of
[44:24] depravity that that is surrounding that
[44:26] whole system and and
[44:28] then in 1978 I had an experience with
[44:32] God in a Baptist Church shortly after
[44:35] that I went to the Assembly of God
[44:36] Church and then I got heavily involved
[44:38] with the Full Gospel businessman then I
[44:41] went to Bible School at Jim Baker's
[44:43] Bible School at PTL and then I went to
[44:46] the United Pentecostal church and then
[44:48] to the message and I can tell you it's
[44:51] like a religious merry-go-round and I
[44:53] would not wish it on anybody but I am so
[44:57] thankful that God allowed me to go there
[44:59] because anytime I meet anybody from any
[45:02] one of those systems I know right where
[45:04] to put my finger right want to take them
[45:07] in the scripture to know where they're
[45:09] wrong some of the systems like Pentecost
[45:12] I can say at one time your church had a
[45:15] standard and and had a standard of
[45:17] holiness so let me ask you a question
[45:20] did they start wrong or they finishing
[45:22] wrong and it's a question you can ask of
[45:25] any of them because they all had a
[45:27] standard at one time so then coming to
[45:30] the message and and coming into the
[45:33] knowledge supernatural knowledge
[45:35] I felt like here I was I thought I knew
[45:38] something about the Bible the I had
[45:39] graduated from Bible School and I found
[45:42] myself right back in pre-kindergarten at
[45:45] the feet of a prophet sitting there and
[45:47] in a supernatural the drama all around
[45:51] me and the romance and the Bible
[45:53] becoming real brother Branham said I'm a
[45:55] technologist and any man who truly
[45:57] understands the Bible will be a typology
[45:59] and I have to confess I graduated from
[46:02] Bible School I did not know what a type
[46:04] was I did not know what a shadow was I
[46:07] knew about Hama Lenox I knew about
[46:09] Herman and I knew I lost thing but I
[46:11] knew nothing about the word and through
[46:13] time of studying this Bible I came to a
[46:16] knowledge that this this message it is
[46:19] supernatural intelligence a believer is
[46:23] a supernatural being with a divine
[46:26] purpose in their life you're not you
[46:29] you're not a human being that's come
[46:31] down to have a spiritual experience
[46:33] you're a supernatural being and you come
[46:36] down to have a human experience and
[46:38] mission and your mandate is to overcome
[46:41] this human experience and brother
[46:44] Brennan talks about a feel that that God
[46:47] you know it is a triune triune being and
[46:50] here we are we we live in a three-room
[46:53] house like an egg you can look at the
[46:56] egg and on the outside is the shell and
[46:58] but by experience we know that there is
[47:01] the egg white and inside of that is the
[47:04] egg yolk so when we break down this
[47:07] human experience the first experience we
[47:10] have is a human experience right now
[47:13] when I was in the business world I
[47:15] studied I studied inspiration I studied
[47:18] motivation long before I ever became a
[47:20] Christian right and and so so what I
[47:23] found out is that the mind is a tool
[47:28] with which we think we think and I
[47:33] studied about attitude I studied about
[47:35] goal-setting
[47:36] interpersonal relationship I studied all
[47:39] time management and then when I came to
[47:41] the message everything began to congeal
[47:44] around me
[47:46] and as a result of traveling and
[47:48] studying human nature in the field of
[47:51] motivation and then in the ministry I I
[47:53] came to a revelation and the revelation
[47:57] was and I trusted this is something you
[48:00] can lock down in your life and share it
[48:03] with everybody that you know and that is
[48:05] the most common form of addictive
[48:11] behavior in all of human nature is a
[48:17] negative attitude I want to repeat that
[48:22] the most common form of addictive
[48:28] behavior is a negative attitude no where
[48:35] does this start
[48:36] I drew a tree because when I came to
[48:40] this conclusion I wanted to see it in
[48:42] the word and I wanted to see it in the
[48:44] message and brother branham loved the
[48:47] word perfect perfect love perfect faith
[48:50] perfect straight by perfect
[48:51] weakness he loved that WordPerfect I
[48:54] loved one time her brother branham he
[48:56] was he was talking about the atmosphere
[48:59] oh my he's all it's just perfect yeah no
[49:03] it's beyond perfect it's sublime and so
[49:06] so I studied that WordPerfect and then
[49:09] I'm studying attitude and so I just sat
[49:12] down in our Road in search of a perfect
[49:17] attitude now we're not going to achieve
[49:20] that in this flesh but that's our goal
[49:24] every day our goal is perfection and so
[49:28] I started looking in in the Bible the
[49:30] Bible said a righteous man is like a
[49:33] tree planted by the rivers of water and
[49:37] everything that man does shall prosper
[49:41] so I started thinking well what about a
[49:44] unrighteous man
[49:45] well unrighteous man they're like a tree
[49:48] planted by a sewer or a septic tank or a
[49:51] cesspool and everything they do will be
[49:54] rotten and perverted and polluted so I
[49:58] had a brother he was an ardent I said I
[50:00] said brother trouble would you draw a
[50:02] tree and in that tree I want you to draw
[50:05] some big roots going into the ground and
[50:08] then draw some fruits going up there and
[50:12] so I started thinking where does a
[50:15] negative attitude the fruits of a
[50:18] negative person where does it start how
[50:21] does it come and the first loop that
[50:24] goes into the life of a negative man or
[50:27] a negative woman is the root of
[50:32] criticism you know I've never seen a
[50:36] statue or a monument erected to a critic
[50:40] but to those that have been criticized
[50:43] many monuments have been erected brother
[50:47] Branham said if you're looking for
[50:49] something to criticize don't worry the
[50:51] devil will show you something and so
[50:54] where does that root of criticism come
[50:57] from in a young person's life
[51:01] unfortunately oftentimes
[51:03] comes from dear old mom and dad because
[51:07] that little child is there in his mind
[51:10] is like a fertile bedding ground and he
[51:13] hears mom and dad complaining about the
[51:15] neighbors and complaining about the boss
[51:18] and complaining about the taxes
[51:20] complaining about everything and griping
[51:23] at each other and then unfortunately
[51:26] some of them they feed on television and
[51:28] they feed there and the actors and the
[51:31] comedians and everybody they learn how
[51:34] to criticize and then they go into
[51:36] school first grade and if they're
[51:39] already the bullies start ganging up
[51:41] somebody maybe they're a little bit
[51:43] shorter or a little bit taller or maybe
[51:45] they're heavier or maybe they're thinner
[51:47] or maybe they have glasses and they
[51:49] become the picking stone everybody
[51:51] begins to pick on this little and people
[51:54] learn to criticize the next route after
[52:01] criticism is is embedded in a person the
[52:05] next route that goes down is the root of
[52:08] pessimism a pessimist always sees the
[52:14] glass as half-empty were the optimist
[52:17] seasoned as half-full
[52:19] so pessimism is a dark room where
[52:24] negativity is developed
[52:26] now some young people you may not know
[52:29] what a dark room was but well we were
[52:31] growing up we didn't have a cellphone
[52:34] that could take pictures we had to buy
[52:36] film and put it in a camera and take the
[52:39] picture and take out the film and bring
[52:41] it over and they would take that film
[52:43] and put it into a dark room and then out
[52:46] come the picture from the negative so
[52:48] pessimism is the dark room where
[52:51] negatives are developed so from
[52:54] criticism to pessimism the next root
[52:58] these are all words they're attributes
[53:01] that goes down into the light and the
[53:03] nature and the character of a person the
[53:06] next route that goes down is the route
[53:10] of skepticism skip I'm skeptical ah
[53:15] what's that guy
[53:17] - I'm gonna go I want to watch that guy
[53:21] skepticism right and then right next to
[53:24] that is cynicism cynical we're living in
[53:28] a cynical world and for some reason you
[53:33] know you may have reason to be skeptical
[53:35] and cynical of anything you see because
[53:38] the world they can take anything they
[53:41] want and they can tie it together
[53:43] seamlessly and make things seem as if
[53:46] they're not make people say or do things
[53:48] they never did but you would never know
[53:51] it because technology has moved up to
[53:54] that point now the last route that goes
[53:57] down into the tree is the route of
[54:04] sarcasm anybody ever knows somebody's
[54:08] sarcastic yeah they wake up in the
[54:12] morning and they have a big ol
[54:14] industrial-sized pencil sharpener and
[54:17] they take their tongue and they sharpen
[54:23] up that tongue and they go out look for
[54:26] somebody they rip into so now you've got
[54:29] the roots now criticism pessimism
[54:35] cynicism skepticism sarcasm negative
[54:41] tree it's arm it's on the way now I know
[54:46] some of you think your brother Ernie
[54:48] this is all in the in the natural world
[54:50] we're gonna get to the supernatural but
[54:52] you know we need to talk about our
[54:54] natural self first I want to speak
[54:57] tonight about supernatural intelligence
[55:00] okay but now that from these roots that
[55:03] go into the tree remember a righteous
[55:07] man or an unrighteous man now the fruits
[55:11] begin to come the first fruit that comes
[55:16] to harvest in a negative person is the
[55:23] fruit of fear
[55:27] fear f.e.a.r false evidence appearing
[55:35] real
[55:38] false education appearing real Oh what
[55:43] most people do forget everything and run
[55:49] but what the bride does face everything
[55:52] and rise we rise to the occasion the
[55:56] Bible said I have not given you a spirit
[55:58] of fear but power love and a sound mind
[56:01] and brother branham said this message
[56:04] came to take the fear off of the people
[56:07] how many times we hear hundreds of times
[56:10] in the Bible fear not fear not let not
[56:15] your heart be troubled God is in control
[56:19] he is in time on time all the time but
[56:24] people are fearful up to date is the
[56:28] message right to this hour right to this
[56:32] minute they used to be there and
[56:34] prophecy would come we see you know but
[56:37] year by year we would see prophecy come
[56:39] into fulfillment then it seemed like it
[56:42] was month by month then it was like week
[56:45] by week that then I was day by day
[56:48] now it's hour by hour you never know
[56:51] what's going to take place from the last
[56:54] time that you looked at your phone and
[56:58] you saw what the news is today the world
[57:03] has entered into a higher state of panic
[57:07] than they were yesterday it's been
[57:11] declared a national emergency
[57:14] no the bride's not in an emergency but
[57:19] the bride should be in desperation
[57:23] not a desperation out of fear but a
[57:26] desperation to know and serve and love
[57:29] God and define His perfect will for our
[57:32] life so here that's the first fruit that
[57:35] comes up out of the tree the next fruit
[57:40] is the fruit of anger we are living
[57:49] today in a Day of Rage road rage air
[57:54] rage boat rage school rage domestic rain
[57:59] every kind of rage you can think about
[58:02] everybody's outraged I am outraged well
[58:10] I'm not raised at the people who are
[58:14] outraged that I am not outraged anger
[58:21] how many people right now are sitting I
[58:24] call it the crowbar motel sitting in
[58:27] jail right now because of one moment of
[58:30] unbridled anger and they pop somebody or
[58:33] they hit somebody do something they play
[58:36] the fool and the next thing you know
[58:38] here they are manslaughter
[58:41] five years and they're sitting in the
[58:44] crowbar motel any any issue with the law
[58:53] but one moment of unbridled anger and
[58:57] there they are anger is one letter short
[59:04] of danger you put the D in front of
[59:10] anger and you have danger and the D is
[59:14] the devil if the devil can anoint your
[59:18] anger you are in danger
[59:23] the Holy Ghost does not like that kind
[59:26] of a spirit right brother Brennan was
[59:28] talking about gossip eases now when you
[59:30] begin to gossip just mark it down the
[59:35] Holy Ghost has just left you he can't
[59:41] stand that kind of a spirit
[59:43] no he hasn't gone far away he's just out
[59:45] just just take this fight look how do
[59:48] you get him to come back just become a
[59:51] lamb again anger now from the fear and
[59:57] the anger the next one is one we all
[1:00:02] have to battle with procrastination
[1:00:08] procrastination is the assassination of
[1:00:12] motivation there was a town right here
[1:00:18] in Florida and this town they had so
[1:00:21] many procrastinators in the town that
[1:00:23] they decided they were going to start a
[1:00:26] procrastinators Club but then they
[1:00:32] decided to wait what do we do I'll do it
[1:00:39] tomorrow
[1:00:41] later you children when mom tells you
[1:00:44] okay it's time to wake up oh okay time
[1:00:57] to clean up your hall can I do it later
[1:01:01] put things off I like to do it now get
[1:01:05] it done do it now
[1:01:07] get it done so go real quickly now fear
[1:01:12] anger procrastination the next one is
[1:01:18] anxiety anxiety you know how many people
[1:01:22] are on anxiety and anti depression and
[1:01:27] medication today and it has gone so
[1:01:30] crazy that people they've all got their
[1:01:33] little service animals you know the one
[1:01:35] thing and the soldiers come back with
[1:01:37] PTSD and then you've got students in the
[1:01:40] college now and I'm uncomfortable
[1:01:43] because somebody might come and speak in
[1:01:46] a I don't I don't agree with them and
[1:01:50] then you know in schools now corporate
[1:01:52] America if their employees get
[1:01:54] uncomfortable they have a cry room and
[1:01:56] they can go to their cry room and they
[1:01:59] can go there and they can calm
[1:02:00] themselves down in the cry room listen
[1:02:05] friends you go to the Air Force nowadays
[1:02:07] there are more dogs in the airport than
[1:02:10] its outside the airport and they're in
[1:02:12] the airport
[1:02:13] little dogs and they're walking down
[1:02:15] there and they come up there and smell
[1:02:17] at you and the people up and it's like
[1:02:20] their pride they walk around with their
[1:02:22] prized now they have gone I don't know
[1:02:25] if you ever saw cruther jack did you see
[1:02:27] the ones that got their little horse on
[1:02:29] the plane with them anybody see that
[1:02:32] anybody yeah they got this little
[1:02:34] miniature horses and their service
[1:02:37] animals and the airline's have to let
[1:02:40] the people on the horse are on the plane
[1:02:43] with their horse because that's what
[1:02:45] keeps them calm that's what keeps them
[1:02:47] from from having a breakdown could you
[1:02:53] imagine if we ever had to send some of
[1:02:57] these young men
[1:02:58] if ever a war broke out could you
[1:03:00] imagine having to go and fight Hitler or
[1:03:04] fight Mussolini do you imagine a run for
[1:03:10] the border north-south it didn't matter
[1:03:13] as long as they didn't have to go fight
[1:03:15] they wouldn't get on the boat they
[1:03:16] wouldn't get on the plane fear anxiety
[1:03:23] brother branham Center way back in the
[1:03:25] 50s this is a neurotic age
[1:03:30] neurotic fearful upset unsure some
[1:03:36] people they're so panic-stricken they
[1:03:39] cannot even go out of their Hut their
[1:03:41] house bound they can't even go out to
[1:03:44] check the mail fear anger
[1:03:52] procrastination indecision anxiety and
[1:03:56] the last fruit is the fruit of
[1:04:02] depression many people today as a result
[1:04:06] of all the roots that have gone into
[1:04:09] their life and all the fruits are being
[1:04:12] manifested they are in a deep dark
[1:04:15] dungeon of desperation and depression
[1:04:18] and despondency and despair and
[1:04:21] disillusionment and doubt and they are
[1:04:24] on a slow silent screaming slide into
[1:04:27] the bowels of ultimate despair now
[1:04:31] that's the natural man and the reason
[1:04:34] that God quickened that to me was in
[1:04:37] search of a perfect attitude because we
[1:04:42] have the paradigm shift we've gone from
[1:04:44] being that negative person to be the
[1:04:47] positive person and the Holy Ghost has
[1:04:50] done that transformation in our life the
[1:04:53] message has to produce a
[1:04:55] transformational attitude in our
[1:04:58] character in our outlook in our nature
[1:05:00] in our mindset so now let's talk about
[1:05:04] the human being on the outside on the
[1:05:08] shell right here on the shell right here
[1:05:10] I have five gates my eyes my ears my
[1:05:14] taste my smell and my touch brother
[1:05:18] Branham said those that's how we touch
[1:05:21] the outside world that's how we contact
[1:05:23] the world around us
[1:05:25] now not everybody has eyes be thankful
[1:05:28] for your eyes not everybody has ears but
[1:05:34] you need to watch friend today you need
[1:05:37] to watch more than ever
[1:05:39] before what you allowed to go into your
[1:05:42] eyes and what you go into your ears
[1:05:45] because you are just like Eve you have
[1:05:49] been put here on free moral agency God
[1:05:53] has put into your hands the power of
[1:05:56] choice and you decide what you're going
[1:05:59] to allow what you're going to read what
[1:06:01] you're going to watch what you're going
[1:06:03] to see God has trusted you to overcome
[1:06:09] in this day in the most wicked perverted
[1:06:13] deceptive age ever and God has put right
[1:06:17] in my hands right here this is the
[1:06:20] modern tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:06:24] evil just like Eve had it right in front
[1:06:28] of her and he said how could he have
[1:06:31] ever done what she did how can some
[1:06:35] people do what they do how can they look
[1:06:38] at what they look at how can they listen
[1:06:40] to what they mustn't like your eyes what
[1:06:45] a tool that God has given to us to be
[1:06:48] able to read the word to be able to
[1:06:51] interact with believers we're able to
[1:06:54] interact with the eyes what a Jew what a
[1:06:59] treasure I know people who are blind one
[1:07:04] man in particular he was blinded when he
[1:07:06] was a young boy by a gun accident and I
[1:07:09] asked him I said dick what would it be
[1:07:10] like this was way back in the ad I said
[1:07:12] what would it be like if medical
[1:07:14] technology ever advanced to the point
[1:07:16] where you could see a sore knee I'd love
[1:07:19] to be able to see I've never seen my
[1:07:20] wife I've never seen my children I'd
[1:07:22] love to see the ocean again I'd love to
[1:07:24] be able to see the blue skies and the
[1:07:26] moon and the stars I'd love to be able
[1:07:28] to see the flop and he named off all the
[1:07:30] things that he would love to be able to
[1:07:32] see but he said but he said it would be
[1:07:36] a double-edged sword because now because
[1:07:39] I don't have my vision God has given me
[1:07:43] another sense and I can feel
[1:07:46] I don't judge them by what they look
[1:07:49] like I don't judge them by what color
[1:07:51] they are or how big they are how small
[1:07:53] they are
[1:07:54] or how old they are young they're I
[1:07:56] don't judge them
[1:07:57] I just feel them I can feel if this is a
[1:08:01] person I want to have as a part of my
[1:08:04] life he said but if I had my eyes back I
[1:08:06] would be right back to humanity and I
[1:08:09] would prejudge people I would judge the
[1:08:13] book by the outside of the cover and I
[1:08:15] would never even take time to see what
[1:08:18] was inside that person so eyes this is a
[1:08:23] visual age that we're living in Satan
[1:08:27] he's got all his dad's all his tinsel
[1:08:30] and he wants to put in front of you
[1:08:31] television and movies and all that go
[1:08:35] shopping and you want to see all the
[1:08:37] things in the store hearing you know
[1:08:42] today the world is dancing to the beat
[1:08:46] of Satan's music it used to be at back
[1:08:50] in the early 1900's it was the days of
[1:08:54] jazz then it went to Frank Sinatra then
[1:08:57] it went to the Beatles and brother
[1:08:58] branham said the Beatles I know I'm
[1:09:00] dating myself the Beatles came right out
[1:09:03] of the pit of hell then it went to to
[1:09:07] jazz and from jazz to rock and then from
[1:09:10] rock to hip-hop and all the I wonder
[1:09:13] brother branham said the Beatles came
[1:09:15] out of the pit of hell what would he say
[1:09:17] about some of these rap stars today and
[1:09:25] I know I meet believers say well you
[1:09:28] know I only listen to Christian rock let
[1:09:32] me tell you friends there is no such
[1:09:35] thing as Christian rock now I believe in
[1:09:42] rock and roll I'm standing on the rock
[1:09:46] and my name's on the road that's the
[1:09:49] kind of rock and roll that I believe
[1:09:53] but these eyes in these ears are not
[1:09:55] meant to entertain Satan's Kingdom
[1:09:58] Satan's Eden Jezebel religion the god of
[1:10:02] this evil age the anointed ones at the
[1:10:04] end time they want to attract your
[1:10:06] attention
[1:10:06] and Satan is a good adversary and
[1:10:09] brother Brad said in the greatest battle
[1:10:11] ever fought he's not all in one sentence
[1:10:14] but here's what he said throughout that
[1:10:16] book about the devil he said cuddle
[1:10:19] chaplain welcome slicin maim him take
[1:10:25] him out kill him don't go after him with
[1:10:29] the 22 drop the atomic bomb right at the
[1:10:32] beginning drop the word thus saith the
[1:10:35] Lord drop it on him right at the
[1:10:38] beginning when I wake up in the morning
[1:10:41] friends I know there's got to be two
[1:10:43] deaths
[1:10:44] I gotta die and the devil's gonna die
[1:10:46] first thing in the morning find the
[1:10:49] yapping dog shut up never PS no
[1:10:52] authority here
[1:10:55] greater is He that's in me than he
[1:10:58] that's in the world
[1:11:00] he hates the name of Jesus he hates
[1:11:03] prayer he hates praise he hates a
[1:11:05] righteous life eyes and ears very
[1:11:12] precious commodities but very very
[1:11:15] deceitful in this day that we are living
[1:11:17] in you know the 1900s
[1:11:19] that was the first age that they even
[1:11:21] had moving they know movies in the
[1:11:25] beginning they didn't even have a song
[1:11:27] they just had people walking around
[1:11:30] they're like Charlie Chaplin walking and
[1:11:32] people enthralled in it huh and then
[1:11:35] when they added sound to it then when
[1:11:38] they added color to it now they got all
[1:11:41] the bells and the whistles television
[1:11:45] became television right and now
[1:11:50] Hollywood oh my people they look at the
[1:11:55] Stars
[1:11:56] and they worship the stars TV stars
[1:12:00] movie stars
[1:12:02] sports stars home on sports um you mean
[1:12:05] you mean that guy can take that little
[1:12:08] ball T seven feet tall and do you mean
[1:12:10] that guy can then put that little orange
[1:12:13] thing in the basket and he can run down
[1:12:16] there like you just conquered the whole
[1:12:18] world and the people millions of friends
[1:12:30] the same demons that were in the Roman
[1:12:34] Coliseum the same demons that are in the
[1:12:37] Greek Olympians are the same demons that
[1:12:40] are in our athletes all around the world
[1:12:43] whether it's soccer or cricket or tennis
[1:12:47] whatever it baseball basketball football
[1:12:50] same deal
[1:12:53] but now they got a worldwide stage now
[1:12:57] they can get in that flesh now they can
[1:13:00] jump and move whoa I can't believe a man
[1:13:03] could ever do something like that the
[1:13:06] demons know their moves that being
[1:13:08] streamed around the world and people are
[1:13:11] bowing down eyes and the rock stars and
[1:13:16] the movie star and all the stars when I
[1:13:21] was growing up if somebody was a star
[1:13:23] that was a great thing then they had to
[1:13:26] be a superstar now they got to be a
[1:13:29] megastar
[1:13:32] but they're stars but they're falling
[1:13:38] stars and the people are worshipping the
[1:13:43] falling stars they cannot take their
[1:13:46] eyes off of them what's the world gonna
[1:13:49] do as of this week with no more
[1:13:53] basketball no more baseball in Canada up
[1:13:57] or violet hockey is like a religion up
[1:14:00] there what are they going to do now
[1:14:03] they've canceled the Masters and the
[1:14:07] only one that I know they haven't
[1:14:09] canceled his NASCAR but they're going to
[1:14:12] run with no no no
[1:14:14] in the stands but the cars are still
[1:14:16] going to go around and around and around
[1:14:18] and around and people will be enthralled
[1:14:21] and hope for a crash what we see what we
[1:14:30] hear watch what goes into your eyes and
[1:14:35] your ears because once you make the
[1:14:37] choice to allow something into your eyes
[1:14:40] or ears it makes an instantaneous
[1:14:43] journey to your mind and there in your
[1:14:47] mind is produce a thought and thoughts
[1:14:50] become words words produce action
[1:14:53] actions form habits habits produces
[1:14:56] character and character determines your
[1:14:59] destiny where does it start
[1:15:02] by what Eve do she stopped stop for a
[1:15:07] second she saw and she heard and look at
[1:15:12] the result of humanity because she
[1:15:14] stopped just for a moment I know the
[1:15:21] next two I'm not going to talk much
[1:15:23] about our tastes and our smell but you
[1:15:26] know I love to smell good food and I
[1:15:29] love to taste good food and a lot of
[1:15:31] times I just eat and eat and eat and eat
[1:15:35] and I go to the buffet and I get myself
[1:15:37] in trouble if it smells good we want to
[1:15:41] smell it if it tastes good we want to
[1:15:43] taste it and taste it and taste it and
[1:15:45] taste it and I found myself sometimes
[1:15:51] digging my grave with my teeth
[1:15:54] but just like your eyes and your ears
[1:15:58] they are individual and separate from
[1:16:01] each other some people are blind but
[1:16:03] they can hear some people can hear but
[1:16:05] they're blind and your taste and your
[1:16:07] smell you know some people they don't
[1:16:09] have taste buds everything tastes the
[1:16:12] same because of medication or whatever
[1:16:14] some people cannot smell and the last
[1:16:19] one the last one on our outside are our
[1:16:22] flesh our fifth realm is
[1:16:27] and we are living in a touchy-feely
[1:16:30] generation
[1:16:31] I know people they go to their broke but
[1:16:34] they go to the store and they want to
[1:16:36] touch everything and want to go shop and
[1:16:38] want to feel the fur they want to quit
[1:16:40] they want to feel the nice comfort and
[1:16:42] want to feel everything they want to see
[1:16:44] it and they want to touch it and then in
[1:16:47] the world oh we want it to end people
[1:16:51] they want to touch this one and then
[1:16:52] touch that one and touch this one and
[1:16:55] touch that one when I was a boy up until
[1:16:58] the time I was 12 years old my whole
[1:17:01] life was baseball basketball and
[1:17:03] football we did not want any girls
[1:17:06] around get those girls out of here what
[1:17:10] are they doing around here get him out
[1:17:13] the next year 13 years old
[1:17:16] I'm slicking down my hair putting some
[1:17:18] put some Cologne on there you know and
[1:17:21] what happened I discovered the girls and
[1:17:23] the girls December the boys and I'll get
[1:17:29] into this a little bit later I'll get
[1:17:30] into my touch experience but I was in
[1:17:34] the 8th grade
[1:17:35] and I fell in love little blonde girl
[1:17:38] over there I mean she was it could not
[1:17:42] take my eyes off for her and one day I
[1:17:45] got up enough nerve and I said could I
[1:17:51] walk you home from school and I sat
[1:17:53] there yeah I felt like my whole world
[1:17:55] was gonna end if she said no but she
[1:17:57] said ok and I walked her home it was
[1:18:01] like heaven and it was a long way that
[1:18:03] she lived from where I I didn't care the
[1:18:06] longer the better
[1:18:07] and I just I'll I'm gonna get married
[1:18:10] we're gonna all gonna have baby gonna
[1:18:13] have kids gonna live happily ever after
[1:18:16] you know they say life is one full thing
[1:18:20] after another and puppy love is toufool
[1:18:23] things chasing each other and that's
[1:18:26] what I was I was in puppy love
[1:18:29] everything was going well and then one
[1:18:32] day I got up enough nerve and I took my
[1:18:34] hand
[1:18:35] and I reached out my hand and I took a
[1:18:38] hold of her hand again thinking my whole
[1:18:41] world was gonna end if she pulled it
[1:18:42] away but she didn't and I held her hand
[1:18:46] oh my it was like sparks going through
[1:18:49] me her hand
[1:18:51] oh that that sensation of touch and we
[1:18:54] walked and we held and we walk and we
[1:18:57] held I'll get into that the remainder
[1:19:03] that story a little bit but that's how
[1:19:05] we are eyes ears taste smell touch we
[1:19:12] all use them to contact the world around
[1:19:15] us now you see that is not a holy realm
[1:19:21] the realm of your physical of your flesh
[1:19:24] is not a holy realm it's not an eternal
[1:19:27] realm in fact you are only as safe as
[1:19:32] the realm that you choose to dwell in
[1:19:34] and if you choose to live in the
[1:19:37] physical and that becomes your absolute
[1:19:41] you will die because one day if we go
[1:19:44] the way of the grave as soon as we
[1:19:46] breathe their last breath the skin worms
[1:19:49] that are inside of us they get quickened
[1:19:51] and they begin to eat and they begin to
[1:19:53] eat your tongue and your toes and your
[1:19:55] nose and your liver and your kidneys
[1:19:56] until finally we're all gone and then
[1:19:59] all we are is bone and the bone just
[1:20:02] fade to dust you know every person
[1:20:04] that's ever lived no matter how strong
[1:20:07] or how beautiful or how handsome or how
[1:20:10] talented they are at the end God wins
[1:20:14] every time at the end god is the winner
[1:20:21] right you may see people the world wants
[1:20:27] to take the young they want to parade
[1:20:29] them because the world worship youth
[1:20:32] maybe a man is strong muscle guy
[1:20:36] handsome hoary a girl is young and she's
[1:20:39] beautiful the world what they call
[1:20:41] beautiful but maybe you're like me maybe
[1:20:45] you know you're getting up and you
[1:20:47] and you know maybe maybe not so not not
[1:20:49] so strong anymore or maybe the women you
[1:20:52] know maybe they have some children and
[1:20:54] you know if we get all over in years and
[1:20:56] then the bags start to come and the sags
[1:20:58] start to come right and we look at
[1:21:01] ourselves we said I'm not what I used to
[1:21:03] be well what we got a do friend we have
[1:21:06] to look at ourselves through the eyes of
[1:21:08] God and for that young strong handsome
[1:21:12] man the world beats of path - if they're
[1:21:16] not saved they have an ugly soul and a
[1:21:21] woman no matter how beautiful that woman
[1:21:23] is if she's not a child of God that soul
[1:21:27] is not pleasing in the eyes of God but
[1:21:30] no matter how old we are or how wrinkled
[1:21:35] or baggy we get in the eyes of God we
[1:21:37] are beautiful
[1:21:38] the bride of Jesus Christ without spot
[1:21:42] without blemish without wrinkle so
[1:21:44] that's the end of the physical for now
[1:21:47] but now we go into our emotional or our
[1:21:51] spiritual realm and just like our
[1:21:53] physical that has our eyes ears taste
[1:21:56] touch smell our emotional or our spirit
[1:21:59] we also have five departments our
[1:22:02] conscience our memory or imagination our
[1:22:05] reason and our affections so let's start
[1:22:09] with our conscience
[1:22:10] I pray tonight that every one of us will
[1:22:16] have an up-to-date revelation of
[1:22:19] sanctification and the sea of God's
[1:22:22] forgetfulness and justification in God's
[1:22:26] eyes it's just as if you never did it
[1:22:30] under husband now if Satan can have his
[1:22:32] way he'll rule in the conscience and he
[1:22:36] will bring guilt and shame and
[1:22:38] condemnation and regret and if you allow
[1:22:42] Satan to rule in that realm of your
[1:22:45] conscience and he begins to beat you and
[1:22:47] beat you and beat you and beat you maybe
[1:22:50] you confess the same sin over and over
[1:22:53] and over and all
[1:22:54] and over because Satan is successful to
[1:22:58] come around and planting all those
[1:23:00] unholy ideas in your mind
[1:23:04] I don't want Martin Luther's kind of
[1:23:07] justification
[1:23:08] I want Elijah's kind of justification in
[1:23:11] the eyes of God we never did it in the
[1:23:15] first place there's two things I found
[1:23:19] brother Jack that God cannot do number
[1:23:23] one he cannot fail and number two he
[1:23:28] cannot find sin that has been confessed
[1:23:31] sincerely and is under the blood of
[1:23:34] Jesus Christ God cannot find that sin
[1:23:39] impossible it is in the sea of god's
[1:23:42] forgetfulness as far as the East is from
[1:23:45] the West in God's eyes you never did it
[1:23:50] in the flesh what a victory that is
[1:23:54] friends what a treasure God has given us
[1:23:57] in this day if you can believe it that's
[1:24:03] one of the greatest victories in this
[1:24:05] day is to believe what the word has said
[1:24:07] about you and about the blood of Jesus
[1:24:11] Christ and we see today many people
[1:24:13] trampling over the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:16] on a continual basis so your conscience
[1:24:19] now you either get victory or you're
[1:24:22] defeated what are the other now next is
[1:24:28] your memory and again the enemy works
[1:24:33] overtime wants to bring up all the past
[1:24:37] like a dredge I used to live on on a
[1:24:40] river the Providence River and they were
[1:24:42] trying to reclaim the ground and they
[1:24:45] used to have these dredges and they
[1:24:46] would go down into the muck maybe 30
[1:24:49] feet deep and they would bring up dirty
[1:24:52] old mud that hadn't seen the light of
[1:24:54] day for thirty years and that's what
[1:24:58] Satan wants to do he wants to go into
[1:25:01] your mind and he wants to dredge up the
[1:25:03] sin
[1:25:04] of your past and he wants to have it he
[1:25:07] wants to shine it on you and make you
[1:25:09] believe that God never forgave you God
[1:25:12] doesn't want you
[1:25:14] God could never forgive a sinner like
[1:25:15] you so we either accept the devil's
[1:25:21] verdict or you can do what what a real
[1:25:25] believer does and that is they use their
[1:25:28] memory to remember your future you say
[1:25:34] well how do you do that how do you
[1:25:37] remember your future well I've got a
[1:25:41] book it says the future home of the
[1:25:43] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:25:47] bride so I remember my future at any
[1:25:50] time the enemy tries to go dredging
[1:25:53] around in my memory I changed it I
[1:25:55] changed the page and I find him to the
[1:25:58] future home of the heavenly bride and
[1:26:00] bridegroom and God measured it out for
[1:26:03] it described it in perfection so we'll
[1:26:07] go quickly now conscience memory next it
[1:26:12] remember each one separate your
[1:26:14] conscience and your memory to different
[1:26:16] Department next one
[1:26:17] your imagination Satan in this day rules
[1:26:26] in a man a woman's mind in a fantasy
[1:26:31] world shows that yeah when I moved to
[1:26:34] Orlando Walt Disney was drinking the
[1:26:37] ground for Disney World and Walt Disney
[1:26:40] he mastered animation they took all
[1:26:43] these picture and they speeded them up
[1:26:45] and next week yet cartoons Mickey Mouse
[1:26:47] and Daffy Duck and down all these
[1:26:49] cartoon that was animation that was
[1:26:52] natural animation but God in this day
[1:26:55] allows you to have supernatural
[1:26:57] animation and in my mind is a station of
[1:27:02] creation in my imagination it is my
[1:27:05] dream machine of excitement and
[1:27:07] enchantment and ecstasy right here in my
[1:27:12] imagination
[1:27:13] you know it used to be that these two
[1:27:15] have submarines and when the submarine
[1:27:18] you know about this brother Quentin when
[1:27:20] I was under the water that captain he
[1:27:22] say up scope and that periscope would go
[1:27:25] up above the water and that had 360
[1:27:28] degrees he could see everything and he
[1:27:31] ships up there and he land up there well
[1:27:34] God allows us to take that station of
[1:27:37] creation in our imagination and we can
[1:27:41] go above that and we can look in the
[1:27:43] work and see what the word has to say
[1:27:45] about us or Satan has got people bombed
[1:27:53] they're prisoners they can't live
[1:27:56] without it they can't live without their
[1:27:59] music they can't live without television
[1:28:02] they can't live without video they can't
[1:28:04] live without their cell phone people say
[1:28:07] oh my Johnny maybe he's 15 years my
[1:28:09] Johnny's in bed he's home safe he's okay
[1:28:12] yeah Johnny he might be surf in the
[1:28:15] world he might be having friends in
[1:28:16] Australia and you're he says surf in the
[1:28:18] world his own I cannot even imagine what
[1:28:21] kind of trouble I would have get into if
[1:28:23] I had one of these things when I was 15
[1:28:25] years old
[1:28:28] imagination station of creation in your
[1:28:34] imagination but it's got to be your
[1:28:36] choice you have to be able to fine-tune
[1:28:39] you have to be able to tune in the
[1:28:41] channels supernatural I think if you had
[1:28:43] a shortwave radio here real heavy-duty
[1:28:46] fine tuned you could take that you could
[1:28:49] tune that dial you could hear hundreds
[1:28:51] of voices you could tune in all over the
[1:28:53] world for the ramps had many voices in
[1:28:58] the world today want your attention they
[1:29:02] want your eyes they want your ears they
[1:29:04] want your conscience they want your
[1:29:06] memory they want your imagination
[1:29:08] fantasy world
[1:29:09] Satan's Eden but if you turn the channel
[1:29:14] to channel supernatural God will show
[1:29:17] you things a Bible said eyes haven't
[1:29:20] seen ears haven't heard the mind of man
[1:29:22] has not even begun to imagine the things
[1:29:25] that God has for those that love him and
[1:29:27] a call together for his purpose now the
[1:29:29] next one that's the realm of reasoning
[1:29:32] my what a deceptive realm reasoning is
[1:29:37] people want to figure everything out I
[1:29:39] got to understand if I don't understand
[1:29:41] it I'm not gonna believe the rest you
[1:29:45] can't understand God with our finite
[1:29:48] mind how are we going to understand the
[1:29:50] infinite God a God that said let there
[1:29:53] be no many people say they are
[1:29:56] worshipping a man of 2,000 years ago
[1:29:59] that led a good life and he died on the
[1:30:02] cross and they have a empathy they have
[1:30:04] a sympathy and that's idea their idea of
[1:30:06] God hey when Jesus what are you
[1:30:10] resurrected he went right by and he
[1:30:13] again he was the one that spoke the
[1:30:14] whole world into existence that's the
[1:30:17] God that we serve a God of the
[1:30:19] supernatural
[1:30:21] a while ago there was a illustration
[1:30:26] given Satan was having his convention
[1:30:30] and his demon come or said what's your
[1:30:32] greatest weapon you have lust and you
[1:30:35] have drugs and you have all these
[1:30:37] alcohol what's your greatest weapon to
[1:30:40] deceive men yeah those are all my great
[1:30:43] weapon but I'll show you my greatest
[1:30:44] weapon and he reached over and he opened
[1:30:47] up a little case he said see that right
[1:30:49] there
[1:30:49] he said that's that's my wedge of doubt
[1:30:53] and if I can plant this wedge of doubt
[1:30:56] in a man or a woman's mind of God why
[1:31:01] people have to reason everything out
[1:31:06] oh my I've watched so many people I've
[1:31:08] walked with for 30-plus years and I've
[1:31:11] watched the enemy goes there and plant
[1:31:14] that realm of felt in their mind that
[1:31:16] realm of reasoning in their mind and
[1:31:18] they reason themselves right out of the
[1:31:21] greatest treasure that God has ever sent
[1:31:24] man you know friends watching this and
[1:31:27] observing this and praying about it what
[1:31:29] I found when the message comes in
[1:31:31] brother Jack has seen it many times when
[1:31:33] the message comes to a man or a woman's
[1:31:36] life
[1:31:37] it comes supernaturally and what I have
[1:31:42] observed when it leaves it leaves just
[1:31:44] as supernaturally it's gone the man that
[1:31:48] you thought you knew the man that
[1:31:50] preached the man you went with the man
[1:31:52] you travel with that man is not there
[1:31:55] anymore the revelation is gone God is
[1:32:00] gone and they become scoffers and
[1:32:04] muckers why the realm of reasoning Satan
[1:32:09] come in there and reason them just like
[1:32:11] you reason Eve out of her position Satan
[1:32:15] in this day is reasoning hundreds and
[1:32:18] even thousands out of their position
[1:32:22] because they said and they looked they
[1:32:24] were curious Oh what do they say how
[1:32:28] come what does the Bible say very simply
[1:32:32] cast down reason cast down memory cast
[1:32:36] on imagination cast down everything that
[1:32:40] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:32:43] God now we go down to the last one and
[1:32:46] we won't be very much longer the last
[1:32:48] one in our emotional our spiritual realm
[1:32:52] that is the realm of our affections
[1:32:56] we all have affections parents have
[1:33:00] affections for their children children
[1:33:01] have affections brothers sisters friends
[1:33:04] neighbor we all we live in our affection
[1:33:07] we they like somebody or we don't like
[1:33:09] somebody the affections a rule they rule
[1:33:13] our life now I want to go back to my
[1:33:15] little girlfriend a 13 years old
[1:33:17] Oh everything was fine walking down the
[1:33:20] street holding hands and then one day
[1:33:22] she said Ernie I need to talk to you I
[1:33:25] said yeah Oh what is it she said well
[1:33:29] she said I don't want to be your
[1:33:33] girlfriend anymore I said
[1:33:36] what it was like though if there was if
[1:33:40] there if there was a ground or hole in
[1:33:41] the ground I would have crawled right in
[1:33:43] that ground what yeah you're not gonna
[1:33:49] be my boyfriend anymore
[1:33:51] I don't want you to walk me home anymore
[1:33:53] oh my I was like a dart right to my
[1:33:56] heart and then she dropped the bomb she
[1:34:01] said I like somebody else Oh
[1:34:05] I mean just chop my head off just take
[1:34:09] me out right now I don't even know how I
[1:34:13] got home that day but I do know when I
[1:34:15] got home I went to my bedroom and I set
[1:34:18] the door and I turned out the lights
[1:34:20] and I sat and I cried and cried I didn't
[1:34:23] want to eat I couldn't sleep I didn't
[1:34:26] want to talk to nobody and I cried I had
[1:34:39] a first class pity party poor me party
[1:34:42] wall was me party I
[1:34:44] it seemed like it was never gonna be the
[1:34:47] same now as silly as that sounds friends
[1:34:51] that goes on every day millions of times
[1:34:56] around the world now maybe it's not a
[1:34:58] boyfriend/girlfriend it might be a
[1:35:00] husband wife it might be a child that
[1:35:03] breaks the parents are it might be
[1:35:05] parents that break the children's heart
[1:35:06] it might be an employee employer it
[1:35:08] might be a friend but the emotional
[1:35:11] realm when it's broken is just like
[1:35:14] somebody took a rock and threw that rock
[1:35:16] into a plate-glass window and it just
[1:35:18] shattered and it feels like your heart
[1:35:22] can never ever ever be put back together
[1:35:26] again
[1:35:27] the realm of our affections cast down
[1:35:32] memory cast down cast down affection
[1:35:36] cast down everything that exalted itself
[1:35:40] against the knowledge of God set your
[1:35:44] affections on things that are above I am
[1:35:47] so
[1:35:48] wandering and loving and admiring and
[1:35:51] worshiping God I don't have time to be
[1:35:54] disappointed I don't have time to be I'm
[1:35:56] too blessed to be stressed nobody's
[1:36:01] gonna put me on the treadmill nobody's
[1:36:04] gonna put me on the stress Express and
[1:36:07] don't let anybody put you on the stress
[1:36:10] because your emotions well I feel good
[1:36:12] today but I don't feel so good
[1:36:15] what does feelings have to do with
[1:36:17] anything when you've got a revelation it
[1:36:20] doesn't matter
[1:36:21] you know the sonship I was at the beach
[1:36:23] a while ago I just had the C Daytona
[1:36:26] Beach and I went there and I saw the
[1:36:28] same Sun that I saw right way back in
[1:36:32] 1973 that Sun has risen every day on the
[1:36:36] just and on the unjust and it says every
[1:36:40] day and the moon comes up and the stars
[1:36:43] are out there what doesn't change Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:36:50] forever so we set our affections on
[1:36:53] things above
[1:36:55] now again physical realm it's not a holy
[1:36:58] realm it's not an eternal realm and your
[1:37:02] emotional your spiritual realm it's not
[1:37:05] an eternal realm and it's not a holy
[1:37:08] realm and if you set your affections on
[1:37:12] the spirit the emotions you will die and
[1:37:18] all Satan's got he doesn't have to get
[1:37:20] you and all those children he can get
[1:37:23] you just your eyes or just your ears or
[1:37:25] he get you with your touch or you get
[1:37:27] your conscience or your memory or your
[1:37:29] imagination or your reason or your
[1:37:31] affections he is a full-time devil and
[1:37:36] you cannot defeat the full-time devil
[1:37:39] being a part-time Christian he's a good
[1:37:44] adversary friends we need to know our
[1:37:47] enemy study your enemy now we come down
[1:37:51] just closing on the realm now like the
[1:37:55] egg you have the shell and the egg one
[1:37:58] but then the egg yolk
[1:37:59] a human being we have our physical and
[1:38:02] then we have our emotional but on the
[1:38:04] inside of the inside
[1:38:07] that's our soul and in the soul right
[1:38:11] now either is ruling the Holy Ghost or
[1:38:16] Satan is ruling now he's not ruling
[1:38:20] full-time permanently in some people's
[1:38:23] life but he is ruling there right now
[1:38:25] today because it's either the Dove of
[1:38:28] God or the serpent that is controlling
[1:38:31] that that spiritual realm the physical
[1:38:35] realm but it all starts with the soul
[1:38:37] your soul is the holy of holies that's
[1:38:41] the God shaped chamber that God wants to
[1:38:44] rule and God wants to live in for the
[1:38:46] random calls of the control tower and if
[1:38:49] the Holy Ghost is ruling in your soul
[1:38:52] anything that comes up if the devil
[1:38:55] tries to attack your eyes or your ears
[1:38:57] or your tape or touch your smell the
[1:38:59] Holy Ghost can come say not today devil
[1:39:02] you never devil cast them down if he
[1:39:07] comes to your conscience or your memory
[1:39:09] or your imagination you're he puts
[1:39:11] temptation in front of you turn your
[1:39:14] head turn our head away why would a
[1:39:20] person ever settle for some kind of
[1:39:23] temporary selfish pleasure gratification
[1:39:27] and lose eternity it's not that they can
[1:39:32] lose it if they do they never had it in
[1:39:35] the first place but that's the price
[1:39:37] that were put before us eternal life God
[1:39:42] wants everybody to be saved but because
[1:39:46] of foreknowledge and predestination
[1:39:49] he knows who will and he knows who won't
[1:39:52] just like he knew Jacob have I loved
[1:39:55] Esau have I hated
[1:39:57] why did he hate he saw before he was
[1:39:59] ever born because he was a compromise
[1:40:04] he compromised he sold out his
[1:40:07] birthright for a mess of pottage and so
[1:40:13] here we are today in search of that
[1:40:18] perfect supernatural attitude what kind
[1:40:22] of a life do we have what kind of roots
[1:40:26] are going down into our life we know the
[1:40:28] negative man he's got criticism
[1:40:31] pessimism cynicism skepticism sarcasm
[1:40:35] but the statue of the Merman
[1:40:37] the statue of a perfect man is faith
[1:40:39] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:40:42] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[1:40:45] capstone of love comes in that's her
[1:40:47] goal friends without perfect love nobody
[1:40:50] will go in a rapture that must be our
[1:40:54] goal or magnificent obsession every day
[1:40:58] I must love Jesus said love your enemies
[1:41:04] can you let that sink in friend love our
[1:41:08] enemy we can't even love our brothers
[1:41:10] and our sister sometimes and we're
[1:41:13] supposed to love our enemies so if we
[1:41:19] live in that realm of the soul and the
[1:41:24] Holy Ghost is in there you're not gonna
[1:41:27] have fear anger procrastination anxiety
[1:41:33] and depression you're going to have the
[1:41:35] fruits of the spirit so it's either a
[1:41:39] righteous man is coming to harvest or
[1:41:41] the unrighteous man the positive person
[1:41:44] or the negative person and again as we
[1:41:47] spend our feet it's God that puts that
[1:41:50] choice in front of each one of us every
[1:41:54] day when we open our eyes we don't say
[1:42:00] oh god it's morning no we say good
[1:42:02] morning God some people say oh my luck I
[1:42:07] don't have
[1:42:09] I have an opportunity clock I have an
[1:42:12] electronic rooster and an electronic
[1:42:15] rooster wakes me up this is the day the
[1:42:18] Lord hath made I will rejoice and be
[1:42:22] glad in it it's a decision that you make
[1:42:26] or a decision that you don't make as we
[1:42:30] bow our heads and hearts tonight Lord we
[1:42:39] thank you for each one of my brothers
[1:42:42] and sisters that has made their way to
[1:42:44] the house of God tonight
[1:42:46] thank you for brother Jack and his
[1:42:48] family and what you're doing here West
[1:42:51] Palm Beach pray Lord that a great
[1:42:55] revival would strike the heart of each
[1:42:58] one of your children that they might
[1:43:00] recognize who they are they may be able
[1:43:03] to see themselves through your eyes to
[1:43:06] see the prize that they are to see that
[1:43:09] they are the victory over the enemy in
[1:43:12] this generation give them eyes to see
[1:43:15] and ears to hear give them a heart that
[1:43:18] wants to know you and love you and serve
[1:43:20] you I'm gonna ask it we're gonna sing a
[1:43:22] song and then ask brother Jack to come
[1:43:24] but I'm gonna ask you tonight before I
[1:43:28] even ask my eyes are closed and my hands
[1:43:32] are both up but I'm gonna ask you
[1:43:34] tonight if you say Lord I want you I
[1:43:38] invite you tonight to come and rule in
[1:43:42] my soul tonight I invite the Holy Ghost
[1:43:45] in I invite him to take complete
[1:43:48] authority like the captain on the ocean
[1:43:52] shore that that boat may go up and down
[1:43:55] but that boat across every wave and a
[1:43:58] son or daughter of God we crest every
[1:44:01] wave because you are the captain in our
[1:44:04] ship you are the Holy Ghost in our
[1:44:07] control tower that we may live and reign
[1:44:10] and rule with you throughout all
[1:44:13] eternity if that would be your prayer
[1:44:15] tonight that you want God to take up
[1:44:17] full-time residence and give all
[1:44:20] every area of your physical every area
[1:44:23] of your emotional say father I give it
[1:44:26] to you live through me I pray we ask
[1:44:29] this though if those hands were raised
[1:44:31] tonight father I pray that that you
[1:44:34] would move upon them right now and
[1:44:37] through the remainder of the evening and
[1:44:39] into the weekend father and into the
[1:44:41] rest of our life facing a Time Lord
[1:44:44] where the world is an anxiety in the
[1:44:47] world is unfair the world's and
[1:44:49] desperation but we are anchored anchored
[1:44:52] in Christ anchored to the rock of ages'
[1:44:55] amen do we sing that song Rock of Ages
[1:44:59] yeah Rock of Ages
[1:45:01] listen Rock of Ages cleft for me he is
[1:45:04] the rock he is the rock of Revelation
[1:45:07] and once a Catholic all we thought that
[1:45:09] Peter was the rock Peter was the rock
[1:45:12] the church was built upon and Peter is
[1:45:15] the first Peter never even went to Rome
[1:45:17] how did he become the first pope in rome

[1:47:42] supernatural intelligence precious
[1:47:44] brother Ernie spoke to us in just going
[1:47:48] through the negative tree the roots that
[1:47:52] take down these are things that we don't
[1:47:55] want to see criticism pessimism
[1:47:58] skepticism cynicism sarcasm we start
[1:48:03] seeing things like that manifested our
[1:48:05] lives we know something's going wrong
[1:48:07] somewhere the fruits that come from a
[1:48:10] man a tree of that nature would be a
[1:48:13] fear anger procrastination anxiety which
[1:48:20] leaves you to depression
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:25] a man that say the devil is a liar and I
[1:48:28] I won't have any that in my I won't have
[1:48:31] any that manifested Ana through me
[1:48:34] no I was I was today reading just a
[1:48:40] little something that somebody wrote in
[1:48:42] and it pays just to read the word it
[1:48:45] pays just to listen to the word you may
[1:48:48] not realize that but the word washes you
[1:48:51] the word changes you the word transform
[1:48:54] you that word makes you a different
[1:48:56] person a man and as I was reading a man
[1:49:00] this little statement that somebody had
[1:49:01] made and they were talking about how
[1:49:04] Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh
[1:49:07] because he he just did not like the
[1:49:10] people of Nineveh and as he didn't want
[1:49:13] to go he was pretty much you know like
[1:49:15] sometimes things happen in our life and
[1:49:18] I and our prayer is God
[1:49:20] get them they did this to me God get him
[1:49:22] God do this and that that's that's the
[1:49:24] wrong attitude right hey man we want to
[1:49:27] pray God forgive them god save me that's
[1:49:29] what Jesus did right forgive them for
[1:49:32] they know not what they do and as I was
[1:49:35] just reading that thought I sell my
[1:49:37] thought about the the gentlemen that
[1:49:39] were used to put me where I am today
[1:49:41] through their decisions amen and I say
[1:49:44] Lord you know that man had to make some
[1:49:46] hard decisions but god I want to pray
[1:49:48] for their families I'm gonna I want to
[1:49:50] pray that you bless them I want to pray
[1:49:52] that you help them whatever they might
[1:49:54] be going through God be with them make
[1:49:56] me some hard decisions but God I can
[1:49:58] look back now and realize that the
[1:50:00] decisions they make help push me to
[1:50:02] where you want me to be rather than have
[1:50:05] a heart of stone if the man have this
[1:50:10] anger
[1:50:12] this a man this this anxiety and
[1:50:14] depression and and all of that no no no
[1:50:16] God helped me to have love and joy peace
[1:50:20] they helped me to manifest what you
[1:50:23] manifested amen God's calling us today
