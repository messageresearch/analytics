[1:01:47] what it's all about the blessings are
[1:01:50] not to keep us earthbound you understand
[1:01:54] the blessings don't keep us earthbound
[1:01:56] me they certainly helped us get through
[1:01:58] here on earth but they're not to keep us
[1:02:01] earthbound but I want you to just read
[1:02:04] with me out of a Genesis chapter 13 a
[1:02:07] man and you don't have to stand I'm

[1:02:51] right thank you all right sister Samuel
[1:02:53] so good to see you happy New Year to you
[1:02:56] as well praise the Lord all this talent
[1:03:00] we got around this church she's
[1:03:02] responsible for so we we thank God for
[1:03:05] her a man praise the Lord
[1:03:07] a man it's brother Jeff right brother
[1:03:10] Jeff good to see you again this year
[1:03:12] happy happy new year - yes sister
[1:03:15] Shirelles brother a man but just just so
[1:03:18] that you got some perspective on your
[1:03:20] blessings and you don't become
[1:03:22] earthbound the Bible says here in
[1:03:25] Genesis 13 verse 1 says and Abraham went
[1:03:28] up out of Egypt he and his wife and all
[1:03:32] that he had
[1:03:33] and lot with him into the south and
[1:03:37] Abram was very rich in cattle and silver
[1:03:41] and in gold and and what I want you to
[1:03:44] understand further is that ancient Egypt
[1:03:46] always represents bondage and things of
[1:03:49] that nature Abraham had went down in a
[1:03:51] jiff he wants people to be there he had
[1:03:53] lied to Pharaoh and said that Sarah was
[1:03:55] his sister and not his wife but Pharaoh
[1:03:58] come to find out that that Sarah was his
[1:04:00] wife and and when Pharaoh found that out
[1:04:03] he actually went and gave you know he
[1:04:08] gave Abraham so many blessings right he
[1:04:12] gave him he left there with a lot of
[1:04:14] wealth he might have went in broke but
[1:04:15] he left wealthy out of Egypt and and
[1:04:18] what I want you to understand is that as
[1:04:20] we are getting these blessings it's not
[1:04:22] to keep his earthbound but there's a
[1:04:23] rapture ahead of us and and I want you
[1:04:27] to know that before you get out of here
[1:04:29] you're gonna be blessed I don't know if
[1:04:31] you caught that but before you leave
[1:04:33] you're gonna be blessed do you realize
[1:04:35] that even before the children of Israel
[1:04:37] left Egypt right before they left Egypt
[1:04:41] they got some stuff from the Egyptians
[1:04:44] that they the Bible say they spoil the
[1:04:48] Egyptians and you know that the wealth
[1:04:50] of the wicked is laid up for the so God
[1:04:54] gonna let you taste some of that before
[1:04:57] you leave here so it's not to keep your
[1:04:58] time you just need to understand what's
[1:05:00] going on God just giving you a good
[1:05:02] taste of what you're getting ready to
[1:05:03] experience you you're not gonna leave
[1:05:07] here broke you're gonna leave here
[1:05:08] wealthy somebody ought to say I receive
[1:05:12] it in Jesus name
[1:05:16] a man church we got to understand what's
[1:05:22] really going us not to keep us here but
[1:05:24] we just gonna enjoy some of this before
[1:05:26] we get to the other side
[1:05:27] amen but we just thank God for all of
[1:05:29] his blessings and he's just he's just a

[1:22:38] same page right when it when it come to
[1:22:41] things we have so much that we want to

[1:22:47] just you don't want to hear it through
[1:22:48] the grapevine hear it you know just
[1:22:50] right there on that Friday night so the
[1:22:52] last Friday this month we invite you
[1:22:55] everyone to come and be a part of that
[1:22:56] our annual business meeting
[1:22:59] and we will we'll go from there I want
[1:23:02] to read a man from Hebrews chapter three
[1:23:06] all today and we will just kind of and
[1:23:14] take a little thought here we've been
[1:23:18] teaching on Hebrews three for past
[1:23:23] couple weeks soon and just wanting to
[1:23:25] kind of go a little further I think just
[1:23:29] to kind of we're in a very dangerous
[1:23:31] time you know for for you know as far as
[1:23:36] Christian is concerned a lot happening
[1:23:39] we're getting closer to the coming of
[1:23:41] the Lord we're closer this year than we
[1:23:43] were last year a man and you know every
[1:23:46] day we're getting closer and closer to
[1:23:48] our Lord and Savior returning for us and
[1:23:50] and there are some things that we should
[1:23:52] be aware of you know as we just kind of
[1:23:54] look at little things happening here and
[1:23:56] there but we we want to it calls us a
[1:24:00] couple things causes us to be on guard
[1:24:02] and then secondly calls us to be
[1:24:04] prayerful right so we want to we want to
[1:24:08] just kind of talk about that a little
[1:24:10] bit today if we can let's not read here
[1:24:13] from Hebrews three and I'm starting in
[1:24:14] verse seven it says wherefore as the
[1:24:17] Holy Ghost stay after day if you will
[1:24:19] hear his voice harden not your hearts as
[1:24:24] in the provocation and the day of
[1:24:26] temptation in the wilderness when your
[1:24:29] father's tempted me proved me and saw my
[1:24:31] works forty years
[1:24:33] wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:24:36] generation and said they do always err
[1:24:39] in their heart and they have not known
[1:24:42] my ways so I swear in my wrath they
[1:24:45] shall not enter into my rest take heed
[1:24:51] brethren lest there be in any of you an
[1:24:54] evil heart of unbelief and departing
[1:24:58] from the Living God
[1:25:00] right but exhort one another daily why
[1:25:04] this call today lest any of you be
[1:25:07] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:25:09] sin for we are made partakers of Christ
[1:25:12] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:25:14] confidence steadfast unto the end a man
[1:25:17] the Lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:25:18] of his word let's just quickly pray
[1:25:20] father we thank you for the ability to
[1:25:22] read the scripture but we pray the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost would make known to us the things
[1:25:26] that we have need of on today draws
[1:25:28] closer to you through your word thank
[1:25:31] you for the anointing that has been here
[1:25:33] thus far throughout the time of worship
[1:25:35] and now as we enter Lord into this time
[1:25:37] of the word pray that you'd have your
[1:25:40] wake up we take every spirit that's
[1:25:41] against your spirit underneath the
[1:25:42] control of the Holy Ghost Jesus then we
[1:25:44] print ain't man amen
[1:25:52] praise the Lord so I've been kind of
[1:25:56] struggling with two different titles
[1:25:57] here amen I think we'll just settle on
[1:26:01] evil heart of unbelief a man as our
[1:26:04] title for today but what what I'm what
[1:26:07] I'm what mine you'll hear me kind of the
[1:26:09] inspiration behind this is hardened
[1:26:12] hearts right hardened hearts and we want
[1:26:16] to we want to just kind of talk about
[1:26:18] that just looking at a definition here
[1:26:21] on unhardened is to make unfeeling is to
[1:26:26] become bowl in a religion right is to
[1:26:31] pretty much do you lose feeling right
[1:26:34] and then you become Bowl in a religion
[1:26:37] which means there's a hostility that's
[1:26:39] developed a man or differences developed
[1:26:43] in religion all right and and if we can
[1:26:45] just break it down to the message
[1:26:47] hostility right towards the message a
[1:26:51] difference a man of opinion and this is
[1:26:56] this is what the hardening of hearts is
[1:26:59] glory to God so you have to be very
[1:27:02] careful as to what you open your spirit
[1:27:04] to womb up to right because as you if
[1:27:07] you open yourself up to the wrong wrong
[1:27:09] thing next thing in your heart just
[1:27:10] begins to get hardened right you never
[1:27:14] intended for it to be that way but but
[1:27:16] but it can happen right it can easily
[1:27:18] happen and you know evil heart is a
[1:27:22] heart that is or a mind that is
[1:27:24] alienated from God all right an evil
[1:27:27] heart so when we talk about a evil heart
[1:27:30] of unbelief this is this is a mind that
[1:27:33] becomes alienated a man you get
[1:27:36] alienated from God now and the other
[1:27:39] thing that I want to bring out because
[1:27:41] when we talk about a hardened heart or
[1:27:43] evil heart then would also lead us to
[1:27:46] think about what we what the Bible
[1:27:47] describes as a stony heart a man and
[1:27:51] this a stony heart I was looking at a
[1:27:54] definition on this Estonia heart is a
[1:27:56] mind that is senseless to divine things
[1:27:59] I want you to think about that it's
[1:28:02] senseless to divine things here you know
[1:28:05] that
[1:28:05] couldn't nobody do that but gods right
[1:28:08] and here it's just proven over and over
[1:28:11] before you that it had to be the hand of
[1:28:13] God we were sitting here listening to
[1:28:15] the tape on on Friday night and and when
[1:28:17] the Prophet begin the counter go and
[1:28:19] talk about you know I see water I see
[1:28:21] water I see water
[1:28:23] and they like well I'm not sure to say I
[1:28:25] see this this this person standing for
[1:28:26] them but I see water say oh no you you
[1:28:28] pray for somebody they not here
[1:28:31] their cross the water they live in
[1:28:33] Norway huh how does he know as a man
[1:28:37] where that person was living only God
[1:28:40] could do something like that and time
[1:28:43] and time again it happened in his
[1:28:45] ministry but yet we would be six lists
[1:28:48] of divine things be careful because
[1:28:50] that's what we call a stony heart see we
[1:28:54] got we got we got to be very careful
[1:28:56] that the Bible tells us in proverbs 4:23
[1:28:58] 4:23 says keep thy heart with all
[1:29:01] diligence for out of it are the issues
[1:29:03] of life so you got to watch your heart
[1:29:06] if there's if there's ever time to be
[1:29:08] careful as to you know just cultivate
[1:29:11] nothing the ground of your heart and
[1:29:13] make sure it's just soft and ready amen
[1:29:16] and receive God's word right you don't
[1:29:19] need a stony heart in this hour you
[1:29:21] don't need Amen a evil heart in this
[1:29:24] hour you don't need a hardened heart in
[1:29:26] this hour amen you need to make sure
[1:29:28] it's malleable you know you need to make
[1:29:31] sure that God can can do something with
[1:29:33] your heart you need what we call a heart
[1:29:35] of flesh you want to make sure you got a
[1:29:38] heart of flesh that God can do something
[1:29:40] which right say Matt Matthew 5:8 says
[1:29:43] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:29:46] shall see God
[1:29:47] so you can't have a heart heart and
[1:29:49] think you're gonna make it to heaven
[1:29:50] ain't gonna work that with you you're
[1:29:52] gonna have to have a pure heart before
[1:29:54] God hallelujah listen you know it says
[1:29:58] in Luke 12 34 says where your treasure
[1:30:01] is that's where your heart will be also
[1:30:03] watch your heart Lori to God see you
[1:30:09] know these these are things that's very
[1:30:10] critical especially for the hour in
[1:30:12] which we live you know I want to just
[1:30:15] kind of you know we hit this so Nam on
[1:30:19] tonight but I want to hit it again you
[1:30:21] know when we talk about this this heart
[1:30:23] of unbelief
[1:30:24] you know it's we're not talking about
[1:30:27] when it's we're not just talking about
[1:30:29] living in adultery right we're not just
[1:30:32] talking about smoking brother branham
[1:30:34] say living in adultery is not seeing he
[1:30:36] say smoking and chewing and drinking and
[1:30:39] gambling and cursing now now let me let
[1:30:41] me help you understand if you got that
[1:30:43] type of stuff in your heart that needs
[1:30:45] to be washed out hallelujah Amen because
[1:30:49] you as you can see living in adultery
[1:30:51] eventually if you if you keep living
[1:30:53] like that it's gonna cause your spouse's
[1:30:56] heart to get hardened right amen you
[1:30:59] just can't keep sinning right and can't
[1:31:02] think you're going to get away with it
[1:31:03] at some point I'm you got to stop your
[1:31:04] sin right so so here but he said living
[1:31:07] in adultery is not seeing smoking
[1:31:10] chewing drinking gambling cursing
[1:31:12] swearing a man that's another one
[1:31:15] cursing and swearing is seen let me say
[1:31:18] it again cursing and swearing is seen if
[1:31:21] you still doing that you need to repent
[1:31:23] a man yuji's ascribe us in your presence
[1:31:29] would you be using them words a man no
[1:31:33] if you wouldn't use them if he was their
[1:31:35] president don't you use them when you
[1:31:36] think he's not president because he's
[1:31:38] always there right so so so so he says
[1:31:41] oh you do that because you're an
[1:31:42] unbeliever
[1:31:43] that's the attributes of unbelief you do
[1:31:45] that because you're an unbeliever if
[1:31:46] you're believer you don't do that that's
[1:31:50] that's the reason Jesus a he that hears
[1:31:52] my words and believe it on him that sent
[1:31:53] me has everlasting life not he's not
[1:31:55] sick not fast he believes but really
[1:31:57] believes there it is that takes all your
[1:32:00] initial evidence away scene out there
[1:32:01] there you are not he that hears my words
[1:32:04] and shouts not he that hears my words
[1:32:06] and speaks with tongues now he that
[1:32:07] hears my words from has has blood in his
[1:32:09] hand or in his face or whatever more
[1:32:11] that's not it he that heareth my word
[1:32:13] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:32:15] eternal life and shall never come to the
[1:32:17] judgment for have passed from death unto
[1:32:18] life now i'm going on to the next
[1:32:20] paragraph because this is important he
[1:32:22] says what is sin unbelief
[1:32:25] that's what city is this unbelief a
[1:32:27] little something can raise up and
[1:32:29] instead of going right to the scripture
[1:32:31] and find out
[1:32:32] whether it's true or not you say I now
[1:32:36] see there you go ahead I'll just
[1:32:38] continue a Presbyterian like I am now be
[1:32:40] careful with this glory to goddess all
[1:32:43] kind of stuff going on out there you
[1:32:45] know a lot a lot of different reasonings
[1:32:47] and stuff that don't even make no sense
[1:32:49] but we got to stay with the Word of God
[1:32:52] watch this he says now say I'll just go
[1:32:54] and I'll continue Presbyterian like him
[1:32:56] say go ahead blind and you provoke you
[1:32:58] provoke God when God does anything when
[1:33:02] God does anything he expects the nation
[1:33:05] to grab it but instead of that you know
[1:33:08] well I don't know about that see he
[1:33:11] expects the people to get it if you're
[1:33:13] concerned enough set down with the
[1:33:16] scripture oh my god I like that because
[1:33:19] there's a lot of folk they not concern
[1:33:21] they not concerned enough to sit down
[1:33:24] with a Bible and go through these things
[1:33:27] amen even its message is of God oh it's
[1:33:30] not of God right if we can find it in a
[1:33:33] barber and we ought to be settled in our
[1:33:35] spirits that God did this and when God
[1:33:38] does something he expects the people to
[1:33:41] grab it now the problem is it's only
[1:33:45] gonna be very few people that grab it it
[1:33:47] ain't gonna be everybody because the
[1:33:49] Bible tells us that he hid these things
[1:33:51] from the wise and prudent but he
[1:33:53] revealed them unto babes such as we
[1:33:57] learn you can have the seat and I'm
[1:33:59] gonna tell you a baby don't have a heart
[1:34:01] and heart oh baby oh baby you know if
[1:34:05] you a baby can get mad scream or yell if
[1:34:10] you know do everything that that I want
[1:34:12] to try to get your attention but within
[1:34:14] about 5 minutes that baby be playing
[1:34:17] again that baby don't forgot about did
[1:34:21] you see him know that baby don't forgot
[1:34:23] about it
[1:34:24] you know everything that it went through
[1:34:25] is smiling again and just looking up
[1:34:27] looking forward to the next day when we
[1:34:29] gonna be like Dennis Christians honey
[1:34:33] some of us got stuff in our hearts that
[1:34:35] we've been holding on for years
[1:34:37] Oh God see hinders your relationships
[1:34:43] with people when you get a hard hard
[1:34:46] hinders your relationship with God when
[1:34:49] you have a hard heart come on now listen
[1:34:54] let me let me finish reading you know
[1:34:55] this he says he expected you you know
[1:34:58] well well I don't know about that see he
[1:35:01] expects the people to get it if you're
[1:35:02] concerned and I've sat down with the
[1:35:03] scripture go through it and search it
[1:35:05] back and forth and see if it happen if
[1:35:07] it's predicted to come to pass and so
[1:35:09] forth then you'll get it a man see now
[1:35:12] you know we have a you know we have some
[1:35:15] issues that are that are in the land
[1:35:17] today and you know we don't necessarily
[1:35:19] address them directly but indirectly you
[1:35:21] can hear you know what what God is
[1:35:24] trying to try to say to you through that
[1:35:25] be careful don't allow your heart to get
[1:35:28] hurt and let me just tell you some of
[1:35:32] the results of a heart and heart just I
[1:35:35] mean because you can tell when people
[1:35:38] moving over towards that right but but
[1:35:41] when you get a heart and a hurt you
[1:35:43] think of murder I'm not making it up
[1:35:49] the first person in the Bible to get a
[1:35:53] hard heart happen to be Cain and even
[1:35:58] when God gave him his word gave him
[1:36:00] specific instruction as to what to do in
[1:36:02] order for his offering to be accepted
[1:36:04] Cain took the approach of a hard heart
[1:36:07] and he murdered his brother
[1:36:10] so a hard heart would produce murder not
[1:36:14] only that if you look at the Pharisees
[1:36:16] and Sadducees when their hearts were
[1:36:17] hardened all they could think about was
[1:36:19] killing Jesus Oh hallelujah that's all
[1:36:24] people can think about is murder
[1:36:26] trying to get rid of you when they get a
[1:36:28] hard heart Oh glory to God I want to
[1:36:34] just kind of yeah I want to I want to
[1:36:35] work with this just a little bit
[1:36:37] amen let me let me just read this look
[1:36:40] whoa here a man this is out of Hebrews
[1:36:42] chapter 7 part 2 a man a statement that
[1:36:46] the Prophet makes because you know
[1:36:47] murder comes in multiple forms
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] murder murder murder is not always just
[1:36:55] taking a gun and shoot somebody taking a
[1:36:59] knife and killing somebody murder comes
[1:37:00] in a different form oh yeah let's see
[1:37:04] what the private saying here says and
[1:37:06] you people with these saw blade
[1:37:07] templates you people with these saw
[1:37:14] blade templates and now that we got a
[1:37:17] bad tip and I will let you that always
[1:37:20] spouting off in the mouth you can't
[1:37:23] control your mouth holu you can't take
[1:37:26] nothing they can't do me that way when
[1:37:28] they did Jesus that way and worse you
[1:37:32] people with these saw blade tippers
[1:37:34] that's always found up in the mouth at
[1:37:36] somebody can put up and things like that
[1:37:39] be careful you're guilty if you speak a
[1:37:43] word against your brother that's not
[1:37:46] right listen not just go around and tear
[1:37:50] down it he says you don't have to you
[1:37:53] don't have to stick a knife in a man's
[1:37:54] back to kill him
[1:37:56] you can break his character you can
[1:38:01] break his character and kill him kill
[1:38:04] his influence speak against your pastor
[1:38:08] here say something bad about him you
[1:38:10] just might as well as shot told
[1:38:14] something that wasn't right about it
[1:38:15] well it'll kill its influence with the
[1:38:17] people and things like that and you're
[1:38:19] guilty of it that's what Jesus said see
[1:38:23] now you know you have to be careful
[1:38:25] Church when you just kind of you know
[1:38:27] car yourself I'm just sharing I'm just
[1:38:29] talking you got to be careful because
[1:38:30] you might say the wrong thing or to god
[1:38:33] we got to realize that the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:34] involved in our conversations even when
[1:38:38] you're whispering in the ear the Holy
[1:38:40] Ghost heard it oh come on somebody
[1:38:43] seeing you don't realize that your heart
[1:38:45] getting hurt that's why you know you
[1:38:46] know god help me Jesus you know there
[1:38:49] are things that adults go through that
[1:38:51] kids don't need to know about can I say
[1:38:55] that again they're things that adults go
[1:38:58] through that children don't need to know
[1:39:00] about some things you can't see in front
[1:39:02] of kids
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:04] because all you're doing is you I mean
[1:39:07] specially with something you know that
[1:39:08] happened between you and a person
[1:39:10] don't let your kid know about that
[1:39:11] because they grow up with a little heart
[1:39:13] that's hard towards that person oh my
[1:39:16] god
[1:39:17] it can happen just in a simple family
[1:39:20] Danny
[1:39:21] momma and children you let something
[1:39:24] happen between that and momma and it's
[1:39:26] in us and it happens in front of the
[1:39:27] children
[1:39:28] one of them kids gonna grow up with a
[1:39:29] hard heart towards running up what about
[1:39:32] one of their parents hallelujah I know
[1:39:36] what I'm talking about right that's why
[1:39:38] you know my uncle telling me so you say
[1:39:40] some some things you are young even just
[1:39:42] discussed behind closed doors don't
[1:39:45] discuss that in front of kids they don't
[1:39:47] know how to handle it you don't know how
[1:39:51] to handle it and see and not none of
[1:39:53] that I mean you know you go back to the
[1:39:55] scripture that the parents that was
[1:39:57] sitting around in Elijah's day right
[1:40:01] they just talking about the ball hair
[1:40:03] prophet little kids that come up with
[1:40:05] that on a hold they sit around the ball
[1:40:08] here prophet who we think he is
[1:40:09] they lost all his hair he mean 40 yet he
[1:40:13] done lost all this half right I mean
[1:40:15] that's just giving her a way to go just
[1:40:17] talking all kind of nonsense and when
[1:40:19] none of them kids come out one day at
[1:40:21] the wrong time see the parents knew how
[1:40:23] to control it behind closed doors but
[1:40:25] their kids then the wind is head and
[1:40:28] we're not to see it and when I got in
[1:40:30] front of that prophet one day something
[1:40:34] supernatural just happened and and say
[1:40:36] oh boy hey I mean that's the way they
[1:40:40] approached them oh boy you got to have
[1:40:44] respect for God's servants not just
[1:40:47] respect for God's servants have respect
[1:40:49] for God's people don't just call your
[1:40:53] brothers or sisters anything we do just
[1:40:55] add a little brother on the front of
[1:40:56] that sister in front of that and yeah I
[1:41:00] just you know I'm gonna just be honest I
[1:41:02] don't I don't you know only people
[1:41:04] really called me by my first name as my
[1:41:05] family you understand you know my
[1:41:10] brothers my sisters my mama they come by
[1:41:12] my first name but you know when we get
[1:41:14] to this church it should be brother

[1:41:20] I respect brother Jack Oh sister Soren
[1:41:28] so right don't be dude is running Erica
[1:41:31] who are you talking to know when you win
[1:41:35] it sister Erica yeah see how that sound
[1:41:38] it sounds so much different right but
[1:41:41] now if I mamasan Erica okay all right
[1:41:43] all right yeah but you sister brother
[1:41:46] come on somebody right I mean if we
[1:41:49] learn how to talk that way we won't we

[1:42:00] glory to God see but ever there's a
[1:42:04] round talking talking about the Prophet
[1:42:06] and when the kids come out one day it
[1:42:07] was the wrong day Oh ball go up like
[1:42:15] your master went up man he only he knew
[1:42:17] that Elijah was his you know he was
[1:42:19] following in the footsteps realize just
[1:42:21] like God like Eli she went oh god like a
[1:42:23] master winner like now who are you
[1:42:24] talking to
[1:42:25] well it just caused a little something
[1:42:29] to rise up in the Prophet and he called
[1:42:31] for two she bears came out of nowhere
[1:42:33] destroy it forty two children now I
[1:42:37] don't know how many households that
[1:42:38] represented but forty two kids is a lot
[1:42:41] I don't think one household had forty
[1:42:42] two kids but it shows you what was going
[1:42:46] on inside all those households that's
[1:42:49] why you got to be careful so you can
[1:42:51] murder a person a killing they
[1:42:53] influenced and that's not just the
[1:42:54] pastor and that that's anybody right at
[1:42:59] some point time you don't look you might
[1:43:00] need that person testimony so don't talk
[1:43:03] about him like that Amen hallelujah well

[1:43:10] get a scope on this devil
[1:43:15] and we got it we gonna set that scope
[1:43:21] Devils out of here all right now stay

[1:43:28] don't get a hard heart now that this
[1:43:30] heart heart it produces a man murder it
[1:43:35] produces this now I got some other
[1:43:36] things that I want I want to share with
[1:43:38] you today that happens with with a hard
[1:43:41] heart god help me Jesus
[1:43:44] glory to God we were we were we were
[1:43:46] focusing on numbers 14 verse 22 through
[1:43:48] 23 may God said because of all of those
[1:43:54] men which have seen my glory and my
[1:43:55] miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
[1:43:57] wilderness and have tempted me now these
[1:43:59] ten times and have not hearkened to my
[1:44:03] voice
[1:44:03] surely they shall not see the land which
[1:44:06] I swear to their fathers neither shall
[1:44:08] any of them that provoked me see it now
[1:44:10] now what this tells us that your heart
[1:44:12] can get to a spot where you can provoke
[1:44:13] God you can get God upset now we want to
[1:44:17] preach that God as a loving God he is
[1:44:18] but he also got that gets angry with
[1:44:20] people right and there are things that
[1:44:22] we do that can provoke him we want to be
[1:44:26] careful nice as you know we just went
[1:44:27] through this on Wednesday and I'm
[1:44:29] bringing through really quick there were
[1:44:31] ten times before they entered into the
[1:44:33] promised land ten times actually for
[1:44:36] this scripture numbers 14 was recorded
[1:44:38] because even after that script was
[1:44:39] recorded there was still multiple times
[1:44:41] that they steal amen provoke God but by
[1:44:44] the time numbers 14 verse 22 through 23
[1:44:46] have been written there with ten things
[1:44:48] that God saw that he was displeased with
[1:44:50] one of those is when after they saw the
[1:44:53] plagues Exodus 14 they had all saw the
[1:44:56] plagues in Egypt they saw Moses snake
[1:44:58] eater the other snakes they saw they saw
[1:45:01] a water turned into blood they saw
[1:45:03] darkness settling in Egypt but light in
[1:45:05] the midst of Goshen they thought they
[1:45:07] saw these thing they saw the death thing
[1:45:09] to smite the the firstborn and how God
[1:45:11] it delivered them and as soon as they
[1:45:13] Amen they get to the Red Sea they begin
[1:45:16] to cry about what we gonna do it was
[1:45:18] better for us to be in Egypt now they
[1:45:20] saw God delivered him they saw all these
[1:45:22] great miracles but yet they're they're
[1:45:24] provoking God with their unbelief listen
[1:45:27] it goes on when they when they get
[1:45:28] through that the rats eat then Exodus 15
[1:45:31] they get to the spot I mean they were
[1:45:33] rejoicing and thanking God and praising
[1:45:35] God for what he did but when they got to
[1:45:37] exit 15 they got to spot where they
[1:45:38] couldn't drink the water they start
[1:45:40] complaining again hallelujah and in
[1:45:43] complaining God told Moses to take a
[1:45:45] tree put it inside the water and it'll
[1:45:47] make the bit of water sweet right
[1:45:49] and when God did that cop made away from
[1:45:52] him again but yet they still did not
[1:45:53] stop complaining they got to Exodus 16
[1:45:56] and they're like we want something to
[1:45:58] eat we meet we we hungry Moses you just
[1:46:01] can't you just can't take us out here
[1:46:03] and kill us Moses prays to God God
[1:46:05] provides manna from heaven not only that
[1:46:08] God tell them saying with certain days
[1:46:10] you go out and get this man about on the
[1:46:12] seventh time and one day one through six
[1:46:13] get demanding on the sixth day get
[1:46:15] enough for two days well when they get
[1:46:17] to the seventh day they still go out to
[1:46:18] try to get manna listen God was so upset
[1:46:21] with these people
[1:46:22] Exodus 17 there was thirsty for water
[1:46:24] again Moses struck the rock God told
[1:46:27] miss mark nirach water came forth out of
[1:46:29] the rock and here you know when it get
[1:46:31] to this point
[1:46:31] Exodus 17 that was five times that they
[1:46:35] had already provoked God in less than
[1:46:37] one month of leaving Egypt I want you to
[1:46:40] think about that because you know there
[1:46:42] sometimes God do this for us and God do
[1:46:44] that for us and yet we still go right
[1:46:46] back around and we provoke him with our
[1:46:48] unbelief watch your unbelief I mean I
[1:46:51] got that my prayer I pray like the man
[1:46:54] that came to Jesus and Jesus actually
[1:46:56] saying sir do you believe and say Lord I
[1:46:59] believe but help my unbelief because
[1:47:02] there's times where you get like Lord I
[1:47:04] think I'm doubting this right now and I
[1:47:05] know I'm not supposed to be doubting
[1:47:07] this I suppose have confidence and faith
[1:47:09] and trust for you I'm not supposed to be
[1:47:10] darkness we got to watch our hearts in
[1:47:13] moments like that
[1:47:14] don't let that devil tell you guys he
[1:47:17] don't fail you again when you do yeah
[1:47:19] I'd like to you guess when you got to
[1:47:21] talk back to the devil God ain't never
[1:47:22] failed me not one time not one time he
[1:47:26] ain't never not never
[1:47:29] you got to tell that devil talk right
[1:47:31] back to them and see when you start
[1:47:33] talking to them you create an atmosphere
[1:47:34] and when God comes through sing a song
[1:47:39] make up a song I mean this week I made
[1:47:42] up a song on it he came through again he
[1:47:45] came through again I'm just a sensation
[1:47:48] you hear my song saying he came through
[1:47:50] again glory to God you got to make up a
[1:47:53] song only that let the devil know whose
[1:47:55] side you won't listen five more times
[1:48:00] that they provoked God amen
[1:48:02] Exodus 32 day they built that golden
[1:48:05] calf that that provoked God numbers 11 a
[1:48:08] man they think they were state was in
[1:48:10] the midst to complain again and God sent
[1:48:12] fire down and burned up the uttermost
[1:48:14] parts of the camp they provoked God
[1:48:15] numbers also numbers 11 the mixed
[1:48:18] multitude beginning along for some free
[1:48:20] fish some melons some leeks some onions
[1:48:24] cucumbers and and the garlic of Egypt
[1:48:26] God provided him quails after they
[1:48:29] provoked God and I want I want you to
[1:48:31] sense I want I want I want you to
[1:48:32] understand something God just kind of
[1:48:33] showed me God does not take you from
[1:48:36] something bad in order to give you
[1:48:39] something worse can I say that again God
[1:48:43] does not take you from each of something
[1:48:45] bad to give you something worse
[1:48:48] how if you just wait on him he will show
[1:48:52] you what he has in store for you but
[1:48:54] he's not taking you from a bad situation
[1:48:56] to give you something worse he's trying
[1:48:59] to exalt you trying to trying to elevate
[1:49:01] you listen so when they left when they
[1:49:03] left Egypt
[1:49:04] you know the mixed multitude come along
[1:49:06] with them they think they talking about
[1:49:08] the free fish in the melons and the
[1:49:09] leeks and the onions and the cucumbers
[1:49:11] in the garlic of Egypt so God had to
[1:49:13] provide them quails now another thing is
[1:49:16] when they provoke God is when those dos
[1:49:17] dos spies went up in numbers 13 they
[1:49:20] come back with an evil report that
[1:49:23] provoked God and numbers 14 it's not
[1:49:27] just to to get an evil report but
[1:49:30] another thing that provokes God is when
[1:49:32] you actually believe the evil report
[1:49:37] it's one thing to get an evil report
[1:49:41] from the doctor but it's another thing
[1:49:44] to believe the evil report oh I hope
[1:49:49] that go home with somebody today it
[1:49:52] one thing to receive an evil report it's
[1:49:55] another thing to believe the evil report
[1:49:58] just because you receive it don't mean
[1:50:00] you have to believe it you know our
[1:50:02] prophet taught us that when that devil
[1:50:03] sent a box with rattlesnakes to your
[1:50:06] house you don't have to sign for it
[1:50:09] glory to God ate something I have to
[1:50:11] take this back because I'm not signing
[1:50:13] for it I don't know who sent it but it
[1:50:15] came from Hell is going back to hell
[1:50:17] right I am NOT silent for this box of
[1:50:20] rattlesnakes
[1:50:21] hallelujah somebody see watch your
[1:50:24] hearts watch watch watch your hearts now
[1:50:28] there was something that was said here
[1:50:30] in the message Gabrus instruction of
[1:50:33] Daniel I want to just hit this really
[1:50:36] quick because I see hardened heart state
[1:50:38] they produce certain results one of them
[1:50:41] is is murder one of them is that and not
[1:50:44] just murder of a physical person but you
[1:50:46] can kill their character kill the
[1:50:47] influenced by the things that you say
[1:50:49] about it that's murder as well but you
[1:50:51] know as I was looking and listening
[1:50:53] there's significant things that are
[1:50:55] happening in our land today right this
[1:50:58] this whole thing of the president a man
[1:51:01] joining Israel oh my god Jordan Israel
[1:51:05] to acknowledge to roost lemaster capital
[1:51:08] and you know any say he pretty much said
[1:51:10] it's obvious everybody Jerusalem has
[1:51:13] always been the capital now this man
[1:51:15] this is not a man that really follows
[1:51:17] God I think he just got saved
[1:51:18] right before he became president at
[1:51:22] least that's what when I'm told us right
[1:51:24] he's a Christian you got have to bear
[1:51:26] with them they right right before I
[1:51:27] became president if he said praise the
[1:51:30] Lord but a man I know this if you are
[1:51:34] really converted you ain't gonna have
[1:51:35] such a foul mouth hello somebody
[1:51:42] well we got a church right here in West
[1:51:47] Palm Beach all right I'm gonna just
[1:51:48] leave it like that but but these these
[1:51:52] things you know when when he when he did
[1:51:55] that that was very significant I want
[1:51:57] the church to understand because the
[1:51:59] u.s. standing up to identify themselves
[1:52:01] with Israel do you realize whoever
[1:52:03] blesses Israel is blessed
[1:52:05] and whoever curses irritant Israel is
[1:52:07] curse right I mean so so when when they
[1:52:10] did that that man actually brought a
[1:52:12] blessing upon not only this nation but
[1:52:14] even upon himself right so so when when
[1:52:17] that happened that was very significant
[1:52:19] and and every regardless of what anybody
[1:52:22] said right United Nations say we're not
[1:52:25] gonna I mean it don't matter the Pope
[1:52:26] can be against it that man put himself
[1:52:28] in line for a blessing hallelujah now
[1:52:34] when that happened what what is what is
[1:52:37] what is what is going to transpire is
[1:52:39] that the Jews at some point time will
[1:52:43] re-establish their temple worship I want
[1:52:45] y'all to stay with Mel and Lauren
[1:52:47] handler see their reestablish their
[1:52:49] temple worship but but you need to know
[1:52:51] that the Prophet told us that before
[1:52:53] they established a temple work temple
[1:52:56] worship reestablish it my god before
[1:53:00] they reestablishes it's that the bride
[1:53:02] will be gone interruption so if you see
[1:53:06] them established in Jerusalem as their
[1:53:08] capital mount I was just there and I saw
[1:53:12] the land where you know where they said
[1:53:14] we've given the us this land we can
[1:53:17] understand for them to build their
[1:53:21] embassy on this property I saw the land
[1:53:24] that so we already gave we gave till we
[1:53:25] just waiting and then they come and
[1:53:26] bring it here so so when the president
[1:53:28] announced that they take say my god I
[1:53:29] was just there I just saw the property
[1:53:31] that they're gonna put it on right so so
[1:53:33] when you start hearing things like this
[1:53:35] other nations will be following suit and
[1:53:38] it's just it has to happen you want to
[1:53:41] treat with the u.s. you have to follow
[1:53:42] suit you want to treat with Israel you
[1:53:45] have to follow suit it's cuz it's just
[1:53:46] gonna happen you can't stop it but when
[1:53:48] it does yes it's going to create some
[1:53:50] issues but also prophecy going to be for
[1:53:52] being for field watch me watch watch
[1:53:55] this I'm saying that for a reason I'm
[1:53:57] standing for a reason I I'm not gonna
[1:54:00] have time to read all these posts but
[1:54:02] I'm gonna tell you another thing the
[1:54:03] Prophet said you say this message that
[1:54:06] we listening to is the same message
[1:54:08] that's going back to the Jews
[1:54:15] I get I want to read this quote for
[1:54:18] y'all
[1:54:20] there was a time brother branham was on
[1:54:24] his way to Israel he got invited there
[1:54:27] was some men that had sent some some
[1:54:29] Bibles and everything and the Jews were
[1:54:31] saying say you know what if he's Messiah
[1:54:33] that cares like I'll say yes let him do
[1:54:36] the signs of Messiah and we'll believe
[1:54:38] so the brothers say brother Branham oh
[1:54:42] y'all just bear with me they did not
[1:54:45] call Billy Graham they did not call Oral
[1:54:50] Roberts they called William Branham and
[1:54:57] when it when they said now look they say
[1:54:59] if they see the sign of the Messiah they
[1:55:02] will believe Jews so brother Branham was
[1:55:06] on his way he saved they say he say what
[1:55:08] a setup I got the quote but I can't take
[1:55:10] time of you say what a setup because he
[1:55:11] was on his recently Lord I'm going over
[1:55:13] here David you know he knew that God had
[1:55:15] ordained him for certain ministry said
[1:55:18] so he say I'm going over here because if
[1:55:19] they see it as I say all of them all of
[1:55:21] them Jews been converted at one time
[1:55:23] just one meeting ardent Jews bring
[1:55:25] diversity Lord this is setup I got to go
[1:55:27] into this he was in Egypt ancient Lord
[1:55:30] pulled him to the side it's saying I
[1:55:32] don't go it's not time yet so it won't
[1:55:35] Lord they got it all said he said don't
[1:55:37] go it's not time yet
[1:55:39] that was not brother branham's ministry
[1:55:41] to go to the Jews but it's Elijah
[1:55:43] himself for Moses that's gonna go to the
[1:55:45] Jews according to the book of Revelation
[1:55:47] right so the Prophet had to be obedient
[1:55:49] to the voice of God and not go into
[1:55:52] Israel now I'm gonna tell you how
[1:55:55] powerful that was because while I was
[1:55:59] there in Israel our tour guide and I've
[1:56:02] told some of you all this already but
[1:56:04] our tour guide he made a statement he
[1:56:07] was talking to brother George for the
[1:56:08] George's brother branham son-in-law and
[1:56:10] brother George had been told by brother
[1:56:12] Branham before he passed he says you
[1:56:14] ever go to Israel the Bible become a new
[1:56:16] book to you and say hey say okay you
[1:56:18] know and it was years later after
[1:56:20] brother Branham was going further George
[1:56:22] win it to Israel is like man
[1:56:23] in the same night on went 37 times but
[1:56:25] the tour guide that he got with this
[1:56:28] tour guide was you know he said he just
[1:56:31] started noticing you know brother George
[1:56:33] and all the people that was come and see
[1:56:35] these sisters the way that they dress
[1:56:36] it's a the way that y'all dress unlike
[1:56:38] our Orthodox Jewish women they dressed
[1:56:42] the same way y'all dress he said what is
[1:56:44] it about y'all so brother George they
[1:56:47] know we just Christians there's no no no
[1:56:49] no no y'all not just Christians there's
[1:56:51] something different about y'all what is
[1:56:53] it
[1:56:54] the man wouldn't just go for that so he
[1:56:56] said well you know they start telling
[1:56:59] the story how you know as the Jews they
[1:57:01] they have a chair in their house when
[1:57:04] they have a meal they leave this chair
[1:57:05] empty and when they leave the chair
[1:57:07] empty say they leave that they didn't if
[1:57:09] the youngest boy down the stairs a the
[1:57:11] lift center about to open up the door
[1:57:12] say now when we eat our meal we are
[1:57:14] expecting that Elijah will come and sit
[1:57:16] in the chair and join us for a meal they
[1:57:18] say now you go open the door for Elijah
[1:57:20] the Jews are under expectation for an
[1:57:22] Elijah to come the Jews right so brother
[1:57:26] George say you know how y'all sit there
[1:57:27] you know y'all have that in your house
[1:57:29] this kind of tradition to you he said
[1:57:31] but we've Gentiles were also expecting
[1:57:33] Elijah according to the Bible God was
[1:57:35] gonna send me Elijah to turn our hearts
[1:57:37] not have hearts but turn our hearts back
[1:57:39] to the feet of the fathers he-said
[1:57:42] he-said he-said he-said he-said he-said
[1:57:43] well according to the Bible God will
[1:57:45] come see me Elijah and we received that
[1:57:47] Elijah it's saying just so happen to be
[1:57:49] he's my father-in-law they say uh tell
[1:57:53] you what I'll do here's a tape that you
[1:57:54] can listen to and you listen to this
[1:57:58] tape and then you know tell me what you
[1:58:00] think one Jew heard one tape after
[1:58:04] hearing one tape came back to brother
[1:58:08] George and said this man has he ever
[1:58:10] been here to the Israel like no never he
[1:58:13] said he's explaining Israel exactly the
[1:58:15] way it's supposed to be this man has got
[1:58:17] to be a prophet I want you to understand
[1:58:20] something
[1:58:21] this man heard one tape and declared
[1:58:25] from one tape that this man has got to
[1:58:28] be a prophet and when I went over there
[1:58:29] the man was still saying brother Brandon
[1:58:31] I believe he's a prophet one Jew here in
[1:58:34] one tape now can't you imagine that
[1:58:36] brother
[1:58:37] pranam going into Israel and one sermon
[1:58:40] like not even a miracle says hearing
[1:58:44] just hearing a portion of a sermon they
[1:58:47] would have been done for God and oh lord
[1:58:54] have mercy God well what I'm trying to
[1:58:56] get you to see is that if the Jews from
[1:58:59] one tape one Jew with one tape can
[1:59:01] identify God's prophet one hallelujah if
[1:59:06] others heard that same tape what would
[1:59:08] happen to him right now now I don't get
[1:59:11] what I'm what I'm what I want you
[1:59:12] understand that there we're moving into
[1:59:14] a season where people are getting hard
[1:59:16] hearts they're getting hard hearts and
[1:59:22] that happens for a reason because as I
[1:59:25] said Jintao's hearts become hardened
[1:59:30] then that opens the doors for the Jews
[1:59:34] because the Jews heart got hardened
[1:59:37] before the Gentiles could receive the
[1:59:38] gospel now the Gentiles heart is also
[1:59:42] being heart and the Jews are ready to
[1:59:44] receive the gospel so when you see that
[1:59:48] spirit you know that we're closer than
[1:59:49] we think oh my god let me just read
[1:59:56] something that I gave his instruction to
[1:59:57] Daniel watch this these are signs these
[2:00:02] are signs these are the things that you
[2:00:04] look at the people themselves are
[2:00:05] expressing that we're in endtime
[2:00:07] conditions look at this statement and
[2:00:12] Gabe's instruction Dan your paragraph
[2:00:13] 152 says another thing when Billy my son
[2:00:16] and I her brother earned Baxter was on
[2:00:18] our road to ballast on Palestine after
[2:00:20] we met the Jews that brother Argan
[2:00:22] rights and they've seen the meeting
[2:00:23] Loui pettish has sent these Bibles over
[2:00:26] there and he said these Jews come set if
[2:00:28] you will call up a bunch of these
[2:00:29] leaders of Israel I mean not these new
[2:00:31] rabbis with all their ceremonies but
[2:00:32] call the real Israelite leaders together
[2:00:34] and we have read this New Testament he
[2:00:37] says and we know that when Messiah
[2:00:39] cometh he'll tell us these things like
[2:00:41] the woman at Samaria
[2:00:42] we know that Moses said our Messiah
[2:00:45] would be a prophet and when you can when
[2:00:47] you can tell them and show them
[2:00:50] by the scripture that that which we will
[2:00:52] get into tonight's message that they had
[2:00:54] to be darkened and their hearts cut off
[2:00:56] so that the Gentile space could come
[2:00:59] that we'd have a time of reconciliation
[2:01:02] for the Gentiles and their hearts were
[2:01:04] hardened just exactly like it was in the
[2:01:08] time of Joseph and so forth and then
[2:01:10] bring those Jews to a place and call
[2:01:12] those men from the audience just like
[2:01:13] you do these Gentiles hear about the
[2:01:15] inspiration of the Spirit because they
[2:01:17] said if if this Jesus if he is the
[2:01:19] Messiah and your words are true and then
[2:01:21] he is not dead and he's a lot if he's
[2:01:23] alive he promised to be his servants his
[2:01:27] disciples and if we can see him do the
[2:01:29] sign of a prophet then we will believe
[2:01:31] that he is Messiah what a perfect thing
[2:01:34] exactly right then what what would that
[2:01:36] do a nation would be born and one day
[2:01:39] amongst the leaders every one of them
[2:01:40] would say what we know it when that
[2:01:42] rabbi says that that settles it a nation
[2:01:45] would be born and one day Israel be born
[2:01:48] in one day now for the bread it was
[2:01:49] exactly right we say when the rabbi says
[2:01:50] it that's right you know some of the the
[2:01:55] Orthodox Jews some sometimes you can
[2:01:59] tell the difference then what group
[2:02:00] they're part of just by they hat one
[2:02:03] have the round hat one have the square
[2:02:05] hat and and the reason that they have
[2:02:07] the round hat and the square hat is
[2:02:08] because the rabbi said son that's all
[2:02:11] rabbi said we're gonna wear square
[2:02:14] so they wear square even the rabbi say
[2:02:16] round they're gonna wear round if the
[2:02:17] rabbi say this message is right but the
[2:02:24] heart hearts don't do that oh god I want
[2:02:29] you to notice a statement that I caught
[2:02:30] there in the middle of my read he said
[2:02:32] and their hearts were hardened just
[2:02:33] exactly like it was in the time of
[2:02:35] Joseph and so forth
[2:02:38] well the brand I'm standing their hearts
[2:02:40] were hardened now you know Joseph was a
[2:02:42] perfect type of Christ he was loved it
[2:02:45] loved of his father hated of his
[2:02:46] brethren he was thrown into a ditch
[2:02:48] supposedly dead but taken out so for
[2:02:50] almost 30 pieces of silver you know all
[2:02:52] these things but I want you to
[2:02:53] understand you know some other things
[2:02:55] because this is what a hardened heart
[2:02:56] will do Joseph's brothers they were they
[2:02:59] they you know can I just read a little
[2:03:01] bit about Joseph's ear
[2:03:03] Genesis 37 for me Genesis 37 let's just
[2:03:07] pick this up on Joseph hallelujah
[2:03:12] these brothers had some pretty hard
[2:03:14] hearts and we we go see the same thing
[2:03:18] repeating itself today
[2:03:20] now y'all stay wit me you have to you
[2:03:22] have to stay with me all the way to the
[2:03:23] end because I'm not gonna leave you a
[2:03:25] man we know people with hardened hearts
[2:03:28] we know him but they not staying that
[2:03:30] way
[2:03:30] I got a promise for him I got a promise
[2:03:35] and imma just apply my promise hey man
[2:03:39] Genesis 37 let's just read this a little
[2:03:42] bit here the Bible says in verse 1 it
[2:03:46] says and Jacob dwelt in the land where
[2:03:49] and his father was estranged in the land
[2:03:50] of Canaan these are the generations of
[2:03:54] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was
[2:03:56] feeding the flock with his brethren and
[2:03:58] a lad was with the sons of Bilhah and
[2:04:00] with the sons of Zilpah and his father's
[2:04:02] wives and joseph brought unto his father
[2:04:04] their evil report now Israel loved
[2:04:08] Joseph more than all his children
[2:04:10] because he was the son of his old age
[2:04:11] and he made him a coat of many colours
[2:04:14] now can I just just tell your parents
[2:04:16] make sure that when you are spreading
[2:04:18] your love spread it equally amongst your
[2:04:21] children because if you're not careful
[2:04:23] you will create problems that's what
[2:04:27] that's what Israel did by loving Joseph
[2:04:30] a little bit more than his other
[2:04:31] brothers Amen hallelujah
[2:04:33] listen verse 4 and when his brother
[2:04:35] installed that their father loved him
[2:04:37] more than all his brethren they hated
[2:04:39] him and could not speak peaceably unto
[2:04:43] him so let me let me let me let me let
[2:04:44] me let me also just interject a heart
[2:04:47] and heart will produce hate a hardened
[2:04:51] heart can't speak peaceably a hardened
[2:04:56] heart can't even reason properly now I'm
[2:05:00] just I'm just telling what happens with
[2:05:01] a hardened heart when you start just
[2:05:04] listening and you just listen to them
[2:05:05] talk I think they can't speak peaceably
[2:05:07] oh my everything is hatred I mean this
[2:05:12] if it was good to you every I mean you
[2:05:15] you know
[2:05:16] you know I've learned that even over the
[2:05:18] years and I just appreciate the prayer
[2:05:19] that was just prayed there were certain
[2:05:21] people that's company life where they
[2:05:22] used to bring you to another level it
[2:05:25] wasn't all bad
[2:05:27] you got a lot I mean even when you was
[2:05:29] in your denomination churches it wasn't
[2:05:31] all bad so don't have a hard heart
[2:05:35] ourselves people have a heart of love
[2:05:40] don't talk so evil about everybody
[2:05:45] listen you know listen they hated him
[2:05:48] and could not speak peaceably unto Him
[2:05:52] let's go on and Joseph dreamed a dream
[2:05:56] and he told to his brethren and they
[2:06:00] hated him yet the more so it's the
[2:06:02] brother branham say that they hated
[2:06:03] Joseph because he was spiritual I want
[2:06:05] you to understand these boys are spirit
[2:06:07] - - they were spiritual look at the
[2:06:09] dream Joseph we know he was an
[2:06:15] interpreter of dreams so when Joseph had
[2:06:17] this dream is not that he didn't know
[2:06:19] what the interpretation was at 17 he
[2:06:23] knew exactly what it was but God made
[2:06:25] that dream so perfect that you didn't
[2:06:27] need no interpretation these boys was
[2:06:30] able to figure it out just like that
[2:06:31] look at it look at it oh my god Joseph
[2:06:35] dreamer dreaming told his brethren and
[2:06:37] oh Lord if I could just and Lord I'm
[2:06:39] praying give these hardened hearts
[2:06:41] dreams that would be so perfect that it
[2:06:45] be you don't need an interpreter give
[2:06:49] them dreams God's something the hearts
[2:06:52] got with dreams
[2:06:55] listen Joseph dreamed a dream and he
[2:06:58] told it to his brethren and they hated
[2:06:59] him yet the more and he said of them
[2:07:01] here I pray you this dream which I have
[2:07:04] dream that before we were binding
[2:07:05] sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf
[2:07:07] arose and also stood upright and behold
[2:07:09] your sheaves stood around round about
[2:07:11] and made obeisance to my Steve and his
[2:07:13] brother and said to him Joseph didn't
[2:07:15] interpret it look at it his brother had
[2:07:17] said to him shalt thou indeed reign over
[2:07:19] us or shut our indeed have dominion over
[2:07:22] us and they hated him yet the more for
[2:07:25] his dreams and for his words oh my god
[2:07:29] they can interpret themselves what that
[2:07:31] dream meant without needing Joseph I
[2:07:34] want God to make it that plain to some
[2:07:36] of the hardened hearts it goes on and he
[2:07:40] dream yet another dream and told it his
[2:07:44] brethren and said behold I have dreamed
[2:07:46] a dream more and behold the Sun and the
[2:07:48] moon and the Eleven stars made obeisance
[2:07:50] to me and he told it to his father and
[2:07:54] to his brother not a daddy involved now
[2:07:57] and his brother and his father rebuked
[2:07:59] him and said unto him what is this dream
[2:08:03] that thou has dreamed not like Joseph
[2:08:06] acts forward what is this dream that I
[2:08:10] have dreamed share on my mother my
[2:08:12] brother and indeed come to bow down
[2:08:13] ourselves to thee to the earth my daddy
[2:08:15] taking on a new spirit with its earth
[2:08:17] but look at this verse 11 and his
[2:08:19] brethren in meet him but his father
[2:08:21] observed the same trying to figure out
[2:08:24] how it is going to come to pass
[2:08:26] because God just spoke to you twice
[2:08:28] about the same thing and in the mouth of
[2:08:31] two or three witnesses let every word be
[2:08:32] established I want you to see what what
[2:08:36] happened here with these hardened hearts
[2:08:37] because you know after they heard these
[2:08:39] dreams and they were just upset with
[2:08:41] with Joseph date they again they they
[2:08:44] knew that he was loved - the father
[2:08:45] hater of his brother that's the way
[2:08:47] Christ was all right and and look at
[2:08:50] this look at this when after they heard
[2:08:52] this I wrote this down a hardened heart
[2:08:54] will conspire to slay heart and heart
[2:09:04] will conspire to slave even when you're
[2:09:10] going through in your job there are
[2:09:13] hardened hearts on the job and they will
[2:09:16] conspire to slay to get you fired and
[2:09:21] not even care about you but you have to
[2:09:24] be Christian enough to understand how to
[2:09:26] deal with the hardened heart can I tell
[2:09:32] other thing about a heart and heart they
[2:09:33] were after they could spotlessly been
[2:09:35] they were lie about what happened
[2:09:41] see when Joseph start coming to them to
[2:09:44] his brothers in the field and they say I
[2:09:47] said here he come the dream unless let's
[2:09:49] lay him less and let's see what becomes
[2:09:51] of his dream and wonder brother stood up
[2:09:53] Reuben said I don't don't let innocent
[2:09:55] blood be shed but put him in the pits
[2:09:57] and when you put him in the pit you know
[2:09:59] and said say then you know he it was
[2:10:01] Reuben I did it he would go back and get
[2:10:03] Joseph out that pit but before he could
[2:10:06] get back Judah came up with her with her
[2:10:10] with her with a plan
[2:10:11] Judas plan was that hey we see some
[2:10:13] instruments coming left sail Joseph to
[2:10:16] the instruments like that way we ain't
[2:10:17] got a snare let's tell them fake
[2:10:18] conspiring against Joseph you got people
[2:10:23] that ask us conspire against you oh my I
[2:10:27] got something I need to say in a second
[2:10:29] here I love this because Judah is the
[2:10:34] one that came up with the plan but do
[2:10:38] you know it's also Judah there later on
[2:10:42] in the story when they went Joseph had
[2:10:46] to test these boys hearts to see if God
[2:10:49] had softened them up a little bit and he
[2:10:52] put a little cup inside
[2:10:54] Benjamin's bag intentionally and when he
[2:11:00] put the cup in the back hee hee he had
[2:11:01] here a disturbance a not go through all
[2:11:02] them go through all of them and say the
[2:11:04] one that got the cup gonna be my servant

[2:11:34] go with him when they got to their baby
[2:11:37] boy they cut and there was a cup
[2:11:39] Judah the same Judah that came up with a
[2:11:43] plan to - to - to put him in a pit is
[2:11:46] the same Judah not a had his heart
[2:11:48] chance they look I'll be surety for this
[2:11:51] boy and say look you came too
[2:11:53] Kim you gotta take me he became the into
[2:11:56] Cena it showed that his heart had
[2:11:58] changed come on you might have a hard
[2:12:01] heart but God can bust it up God can
[2:12:05] change it God can give you a new heart
[2:12:09] in a new spirit Judah got that look at
[2:12:14] this look at this
[2:12:18] see ya heart heart work inspired to
[2:12:21] sleep a hard heart will lie about what
[2:12:24] happened when they brought the daddy
[2:12:27] back that that that that robes they you
[2:12:29] what you think is this your son or not
[2:12:32] now that heart heart knew it what had
[2:12:34] happened but a wave the dad had to
[2:12:36] respond and dad went years in grief
[2:12:38] because of some heart hearts now heart
[2:12:43] heart will cash you into a pit a heart
[2:12:47] heart will sell you
[2:12:53] a heart heart will reject your gift
[2:12:59] I wrote this down the Lord gave it to
[2:13:01] him see
[2:13:06] you have many people that will reject
[2:13:10] the gift that God gave you
[2:13:12] but God got somebody that will accept it
[2:13:22] Oh
[2:13:24] so when you when you when you're working
[2:13:25] you got certain gifts and talents that
[2:13:27] you're trying to show folk and you got
[2:13:29] people trying to push you down all the
[2:13:30] time all you got to do is wait for God
[2:13:32] he will open up a door your gift will
[2:13:35] make room for itself and it'll bring you
[2:13:37] before great men our Lord I hope you
[2:13:39] understand how hearts will put you in
[2:13:41] some really tough positions but when God
[2:13:45] touches that heart cuz I'm gonna tell
[2:13:47] you when CCBC I love the script I love
[2:13:50] what Paul say if God be for me then who
[2:13:55] can be against me and well you got
[2:13:57] confidence in the god that you served
[2:13:59] guess what when you're going through
[2:14:01] stuff you don't allow your heart to get
[2:14:03] hard because before you know you become
[2:14:06] spiring
[2:14:07] you'll be lying you'll be putting people
[2:14:11] in pits you have many people that will
[2:14:19] reject the gift that God has given you
[2:14:21] but God has somebody that will accept it
[2:14:23] and Joseph didn't find that out too the
[2:14:26] gap to Egypt but you realized all the
[2:14:29] difficult things that Joseph had to go
[2:14:30] through before he I mean here he is in a
[2:14:32] pit sold into slavery Impala furs house
[2:14:35] light on and part of his house ends up
[2:14:37] and Potiphar just so happened to be a
[2:14:40] man a man that was very close to the
[2:14:43] king right he worked in the court of the
[2:14:46] King so so when when it's time for
[2:14:48] Joseph go to jail he went to the the
[2:14:51] Kings prison right where people that was
[2:14:54] that was close to the king that's where
[2:14:55] they went God was strategically putting
[2:14:57] Joseph in them places when you read in
[2:15:01] the Bible I love the way the Bible put a
[2:15:03] say in and God was with Joseph did you
[2:15:08] just read the story do you mean me and
[2:15:11] part of his house and being lied on and
[2:15:12] God was with me me going to jail and
[2:15:15] they forgetting about me and God was
[2:15:16] with me I don't care what you've been
[2:15:18] through God has been with you away and
[2:15:22] he's still with you right now that thing
[2:15:27] is designed that trial of design that
[2:15:31] tester design the bring God's best oh
[2:15:35] yard and catch it I'm not talking about
[2:15:37] your
[2:15:38] best but to bring God's best out of you
[2:15:42] he used the trial to get that out of you
[2:15:46] you know you got to P go to see your
[2:15:48] reflection in it see when we have to go
[2:15:53] through the refiners fire and when we go
[2:15:56] through the finest firemen that they ask
[2:15:57] the question to the roof on say how you
[2:15:59] know when to bring it out of the fire
[2:16:01] you say I leave it in there till I see
[2:16:03] my reflection in it
[2:16:04] then I know it's ready God looking for
[2:16:09] his reflection inside of you don't have
[2:16:12] a hard heart an evil heart have a godly
[2:16:19] heart oh my when you look at these
[2:16:24] things you know Joseph's coming out I
[2:16:29] mean and I cannot can I just read the
[2:16:32] out hi Joseph Joseph was accepted let me
[2:16:37] just read this out of Genesis 41 I think
[2:16:39] it would be good for you he is rejected
[2:16:42] by his family they were scheming and
[2:16:43] trying to get rid of him and everything
[2:16:44] else but but God had other plans for
[2:16:47] Joseph and here in Genesis 41 verse 37
[2:16:53] Joseph has finally come out of the
[2:16:55] prison because Pharaoh had had a dream
[2:16:57] had two dreams and couldn't find nobody
[2:16:59] and his kingdom to interpret these
[2:17:01] dreams Joseph happened to be there and
[2:17:04] Joseph while he was there a man in the
[2:17:06] kingdom that the [ __ ] not remembered you
[2:17:12] know Joseph in prison he's a pharaoh
[2:17:14] forgive me I forgot about this man
[2:17:16] before I came out you know for you
[2:17:18] restore it to my place there was a man
[2:17:19] that interpreted to me my dream in
[2:17:21] prison and what he told me was exactly
[2:17:23] right and what he told the bacon was
[2:17:24] exactly right say forgive me of my air
[2:17:27] say but this man I think if you get him
[2:17:29] out of the prison then you know he'll
[2:17:30] help you with these dreams they sent and
[2:17:32] they got Joseph and Joseph coming he
[2:17:33] interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh and
[2:17:35] look at what happened in verse 37 after
[2:17:39] the interpretation says and the thing
[2:17:41] was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in
[2:17:44] the eyes of all his servants oh my god
[2:17:47] see see Joseph had already told him say
[2:17:50] nine he didn't he didn't
[2:17:52] he didn't he didn't apply for the
[2:17:55] position that's not how he did it he
[2:18:08] said he said he said he say I advise you
[2:18:12] to try to find the best man you can find
[2:18:14] to handle this situation you know it's
[2:18:19] gonna be seven years of plenty but it
[2:18:21] also gonna be seven years of famine and
[2:18:22] when that famine come is going to look
[2:18:24] like the plenty never even happen you
[2:18:26] say so you need a wise man that can
[2:18:29] handle this situation and and I can see
[2:18:31] Joseph say okay y'all got that all right
[2:18:33] I'm on my way back to prison you got to
[2:18:36] see him walking back to prison and
[2:18:37] that's he's on his way back Pharaoh
[2:18:40] Pharaoh has some words and this is what
[2:18:42] we pick up here in 4130 see his daddy
[2:18:45] rejected it his mama rejected it his
[2:18:48] brothers rejected but God had a pharaoh
[2:18:54] that would accept this man's gift man he
[2:19:13] the top man in the organization you
[2:19:17] understand that this the top man that's
[2:19:19] gonna accept it everybody else might not
[2:19:22] but the top man God know how to raise
[2:19:27] you from prison to power but all the way
[2:19:34] that happens is that you don't allow
[2:19:35] your heart your heart to get hard in the
[2:19:39] process
[2:19:44] Genesis 41 verse 30 and the thing was
[2:19:48] good in the eyes of Pharaoh in the eyes
[2:19:49] of all the servants of Pharaoh said unto
[2:19:51] service can we find such a one is this
[2:20:00] such one this is a man in whom the
[2:20:03] Spirit of God see I like that you know
[2:20:09] the reason you are who you are because
[2:20:12] the Spirit of God has made you that that
[2:20:15] ain't your gift
[2:20:17] that's God's gift that he gave you a man
[2:20:22] and see when even even when Joseph got
[2:20:25] before Pharaoh and he said I heard that
[2:20:26] you could interpret instead no no that's
[2:20:28] not me that do it but it's God that that
[2:20:31] that dwells in me that does that and if
[2:20:33] God don't show it to me I won't be able
[2:20:35] to show it to you can we find such a one
[2:20:39] as this is a man in whom the Spirit of
[2:20:41] God is and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for
[2:20:44] as much as God hath showed thee all this
[2:20:47] there is none so discreet and wise as
[2:20:50] thou are and I can just see Pharaoh
[2:20:52] Paul's action is his service y'all have
[2:20:55] y'all found anybody is there anybody I
[2:20:58] mean cuz I asked all y'all and none of
[2:21:00] y'all said nothing so is there anybody
[2:21:02] like this land he said we need to find a
[2:21:05] wise man which I'll think about this so
[2:21:09] since we can't father wise man I ain't
[2:21:11] gonna let him go back to prison he's not
[2:21:17] going back to prison I mean and the man
[2:21:20] that I was looking for I found him in
[2:21:22] prison
[2:21:22] you gonna mistake I found him in a law
[2:21:25] state the man that I needed I found him
[2:21:27] in a very large state oh I just love the
[2:21:32] Lord they don't know they looking for
[2:21:35] you they don't know what he looking for
[2:21:37] but you didn't you to answer to the
[2:21:39] problem look at it there is none so
[2:21:46] discreet and wise that thou art thou
[2:21:48] shalt be over my house an according unto
[2:21:52] thy
[2:21:54] what is that it'll be like you say shall
[2:21:58] all my people be ruled only in the
[2:22:00] throne will I be greater than thou if
[2:22:04] that imposition in place and I don't
[2:22:06] know what it is Pharaoh said in the
[2:22:11] Joseph see I have set thee over all the
[2:22:13] land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his
[2:22:17] ring from his hand and put it upon
[2:22:19] Joseph's hand and arrayed him investors
[2:22:22] so y'all got rid of his coat but God got
[2:22:25] another coat and arrayed him investors
[2:22:31] of fine linen and put a gold chain about
[2:22:33] his neck so I always tell the brothers
[2:22:36] this only time I ever seen Christians
[2:22:38] where those go change when Egyptians
[2:22:40] gave it to him
[2:22:46] but even having on his own but the
[2:22:49] Egyptians gave it to him right and he
[2:22:56] made him to ride in the second chariot
[2:22:57] which he had and they cried before him
[2:23:00] Balvin me and he made him ruler over all
[2:23:03] the land of Egypt see when other folk
[2:23:06] then rejected you their hearts have
[2:23:09] gotten hard towards you God has a way of
[2:23:12] elevating you
[2:23:14] and when God do it like I told he don't
[2:23:17] he don't if he bringing you from a bad
[2:23:19] situation he's not gonna put you and
[2:23:21] worse he brought him from a bad
[2:23:23] situation jail but look at where he put
[2:23:26] him second in charge and Pharaohs
[2:23:30] Kingdom what a mighty God we serve see I
[2:23:37] want you to understand every time a
[2:23:40] heart is hardened it opens the door for
[2:23:42] somebody else when when the gent when
[2:23:46] the Jews hearts would harden Paul said
[2:23:48] we turn to the Gentiles it opened the
[2:23:50] door for the Gentiles and Josef case
[2:23:53] Potiphar's house was when his brothers
[2:23:55] hearts were hardened towards him and
[2:23:57] Joseph gates Potiphar's house was
[2:23:58] blessed Egypt was sustained and his
[2:24:01] family was even sustained during the
[2:24:03] time of family he went somewhere so when
[2:24:06] a heart is hardened it opens up a door
[2:24:08] for somebody else and let me tell you
[2:24:10] something the heart of their hearts to
[2:24:11] date of the Gentiles is opening a door
[2:24:14] for the Jews this message is returning
[2:24:18] to the Jews because our hearts of the
[2:24:20] Gentiles have become hard they think
[2:24:23] about murder they think about lying they
[2:24:26] thinking about scheming they think about
[2:24:29] all of it and they get so bad you can't
[2:24:31] even say brother branham's name don't
[2:24:34] say that name what what if I said Billy
[2:24:38] Graham that's fine
[2:24:40] or Roberts that's fine you know you
[2:24:44] gather and I'm not I'm not
[2:24:45] don't get me wrong I'm a sadist but I'm
[2:24:48] standing in the way I want you to
[2:24:50] understand the heart and which I'm
[2:24:52] saying it because you know sometimes as
[2:24:55] believers we follow the same path as our
[2:24:57] Lord
[2:24:57] and as our Lord there in the book of
[2:25:00] Acts they told them brothers that had
[2:25:05] come out of prison they say whatever you
[2:25:06] do just don't stay to name Jesus just
[2:25:11] don't say his name and be like now we
[2:25:13] can't help but say what we don't seem it
[2:25:15] hurt you know we can't help but do that
[2:25:17] you know they said well whatever you did
[2:25:19] you just don't say they just don't you
[2:25:21] just don't teach about Jesus I'm talking
[2:25:22] about these don't say nothing and and
[2:25:23] and they was cutting their hearts were
[2:25:25] heartening with coming against that but
[2:25:27] we see the same spirit repeating itself
[2:25:29] today because Jesus hid himself in this
[2:25:32] prophet and now we get heart heart said
[2:25:35] I don't want to hear I don't want to
[2:25:37] hear his voice I don't want to hear his
[2:25:38] name I don't want to hear wait a minute
[2:25:40] don't let your heart get that way
[2:25:43] throwing out the books throwing out that
[2:25:45] tapes no don't do that
[2:25:47] don't let your heart get hard when it
[2:25:50] come to this don't do that don't do that
[2:25:53] keep your heart in a place where God can
[2:25:57] do something for you
[2:25:58] look I've read or robbers books and I
[2:26:01] got something from it if I went to Billy
[2:26:04] Graham's place and I was inspired by it
[2:26:06] I listen to brother Branham completely
[2:26:11] been inspired so don't throw everybody
[2:26:13] don't don't don't don't don't don't do
[2:26:15] that don't let your heart get heart let
[2:26:17] me let me just finish reading you know
[2:26:18] something here god I just thank you it's
[2:26:23] a couple scriptures that I want to read
[2:26:25] to you a man I let me out before I read
[2:26:31] that this quote out of the angel the
[2:26:32] Lord prophet says this says now notice
[2:26:37] in the old days when God told Moses now
[2:26:40] you go now I'll send an angel before you
[2:26:42] keep and to keep you in the way and to
[2:26:44] bring you into a place which I have
[2:26:45] prepared beware of him obey his voice
[2:26:50] for he will not pardon your
[2:26:52] transgressions for my name is in him
[2:26:54] that angel was the angel the Covenant
[2:26:57] which was Christ Jesus the people many
[2:26:59] of them did not believe it those who did
[2:27:02] not believe perished those who did
[2:27:04] believe went on into the promised land
[2:27:06] and the man who rejected it
[2:27:09] the men who reject light went into total
[2:27:11] darkness and I believe today those who
[2:27:14] reject the holy spirit and the light of
[2:27:16] God the days of miracles and so forth go
[2:27:18] back go out back into total darkness did
[2:27:20] you see how Pharaoh's heart how dark it
[2:27:22] got he did not have nothing to do no
[2:27:25] more with the Israelites he showed them
[2:27:27] no favor because he hardened his heart
[2:27:29] against the light and men who harden
[2:27:32] their hearts against the light walk in
[2:27:34] darkness amen so I'm not leaving I got
[2:27:41] people that the devil is trying the
[2:27:43] heart in their hearts but I ain't
[2:27:45] claiming that they got heart hurts
[2:27:46] they got hearts of flesh and I'm as i'ma
[2:27:50] tell you i'ma just talk to the devil
[2:27:51] right now if y'all don't mind i'ma read
[2:27:53] this scripture for the devil this come
[2:27:56] out of
[2:27:56] Ezekiel 30 36 I believe a man Ezekiel
[2:28:04] glory to God Ezekiel 36 we gonna start
[2:28:06] at verse 17 a man this is father devil
[2:28:10] actually I started verse 16 hallelujah
[2:28:14] a man see I ain't preaching my family
[2:28:16] out I'm preaching them and I draw the
[2:28:20] circle bigger praise the Lord I ain't
[2:28:24] preaching your family idea I'm preaching
[2:28:26] your family and it's just a devil and
[2:28:29] sometime when we share it like this
[2:28:31] maybe people can see how to devil it's
[2:28:35] this heart hearts do read the story of
[2:28:37] Joseph you see what happened with these
[2:28:38] brothers when their hearts got hardened
[2:28:41] listen we said moreover the word of the
[2:28:43] Lord came unto me saying son of man when
[2:28:45] the house of Israel dwelt in their own
[2:28:46] land they defiled it by their own way
[2:28:48] and by their doings their way was before
[2:28:52] me as the uncleanness of a removed woman
[2:28:54] wherefore I poured my fury upon them for
[2:28:58] the blood that they had shed upon the
[2:28:59] land and for their idols wherewith they
[2:29:01] had polluted him and I scattered them
[2:29:03] among the heathen and they were
[2:29:06] dispersed through the countries
[2:29:07] according to their weight and according
[2:29:09] to their doings I judged them and when
[2:29:13] they entered into the heathen whether
[2:29:15] they went they profane my holy name see
[2:29:18] when we got out there amongst them
[2:29:20] heathens we did some things we want
[2:29:22] suppose
[2:29:22] to do as God's people right they profane
[2:29:25] my holy name when they said to them
[2:29:27] these are the people of Lourdes and and
[2:29:30] and are gone forth out of his land but I
[2:29:33] had pity for mine Holy Name which the
[2:29:36] house of Israel have profaned among the
[2:29:38] heathen whither they went there for
[2:29:40] saying to the house of Israel thus saith
[2:29:42] the Lord God I do not this I like this I
[2:29:46] do not this for your sakes amen o house
[2:29:49] of Israel but for my holy namesake which
[2:29:51] you have profaned among the heathen
[2:29:53] whether you win you know you don't let
[2:29:56] me down you don't you know you know you
[2:29:57] don't fail me but but I ain't fail you

[2:30:02] it say and I will sanctify my great name
[2:30:05] now you don't you don't you don't
[2:30:06] profane my name but I'm gonna sanctify
[2:30:09] my great name which was profaned among
[2:30:11] the heathen which he have profaned in
[2:30:14] the midst of them and the heathen shall
[2:30:16] know that I am the Lord saith the lord
[2:30:19] god when i shall be sanctified where in

[2:35:20] boundaries
[2:35:21] I see increase all around me and lay no
[2:35:26] famine upon you sir these are God's
[2:35:29] direct words so I bring I bring them all
[2:35:33] right back again I ain't preaching
[2:35:34] nobody out I'm bringing them back here
[2:35:36] that's gonna be some people that gonna
[2:35:37] have Spears suddenly hearts gonna be
[2:35:39] hardened and and that's just part of it
[2:35:40] you know that's when Pharaoh Pharaoh's
[2:35:43] heart was hardened you know God created
[2:35:45] Pharaoh may Pharaoh for that purpose God
[2:35:50] made him expect this but specifically to
[2:35:53] do what he did design him for that God
[2:35:57] designed me to be victorious design me
[2:36:01] to be an overcomer
[2:36:02] he designed me not to have a heart of
[2:36:04] stone but a heart of flesh and I'm gonna
[2:36:08] walk in all God got for me I'm clear and
[2:36:10] and and you know if if Moses was so
[2:36:13] concerned that when they left Egypt
[2:36:15] after Pharaoh had his heart so hardened
[2:36:18] Moses came up with a demand that just
[2:36:20] don't even make no sense we not we it's
[2:36:25] not that we you know we've taken our
[2:36:26] family taking that taking that cattle
[2:36:30] but if it's a hoof shoe shoe for the cow
[2:36:38] we taking the cows shoes that mean I
[2:36:44] ain't giving the devil lovin right I
[2:36:50] want my kin my cow got shoes I'm taking
[2:36:52] a cow shoes with me
[2:36:58] so there's that to you and God honored
[2:36:59] it to God will honor it then he's honor
[2:37:02] it now but we're not gonna have these
[2:37:05] evil hearts of unbelief but we don't
[2:37:08] believe God
[2:37:10] let's bring
[2:37:14] father your word gives us the strength
[2:37:18] and encouragement that we need no matter
[2:37:24] how we see the enemy operating we got
[2:37:26] promises and all we got to do is just
[2:37:28] hold to every promise that you have
[2:37:30] given us you've never failed
[2:37:34] not one word you spoke fell to the
[2:37:38] ground and returned boy but every word
[2:37:40] that you spoke has accomplished and
[2:37:44] those words are bringing forth fruit as
[2:37:45] well so help us got to hold firm on
[2:37:53] every promise you promise a new heart

[2:37:59] that you would take our heart of stone
[2:38:01] and give us a heart of flesh you

[2:38:06] inside of that that's what you said you
[2:38:10] said you would take us Lord from amongst
[2:38:12] the heathen you it you wouldn't you it
[2:38:14] you wouldn't do this for our sake but
[2:38:16] you do it for your holy name sake and
[2:38:18] you would you would raise us up right in
[2:38:20] the midst of those that we were walking
[2:38:23] with and they're gonna see the testimony
[2:38:25] of your great grace in our hearts and in
