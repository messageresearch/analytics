Glory Hallelujah yes sir there are people on Earth that can really sing this song with understanding everybody can just presume that he's seeing something but the bride we have different eyes the prophet said you need the eyes of God yes sir amen you don't just look at anything and then you perceive you think that you have seen something you see nothing you need God's eyes that is why he said he will anoint your eyes so that you can see amen amen I'm I'm very grateful for this opportunity granted me by my friend BR Jack to be with you tonight just take your Bible with and let us read a test Romans chapter 8 verse 28 to 30 Romans chapter 8 verse 28 to 30 Glory praise the Lord amen and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them which are the call according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he call them he also justify and whom he justify them he also glorified may the Lord add blessing to of his word you can have your seat for now I don't know what is happening maybe something is fing to happen amen so we we thank the Lord I believe that we are here for one purpose and uh the reason we have come together is to see Jesus Christ and that's why said if you come you have come to feed on the word and uh you are here for the believer's food amen and uh I love reading this most of the time that is hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God paragraph 133 braam said now there is one thing that will not go that is the holy spirit amen because it is his word and the real predestinated believer would't go away because it is food for his soul he loves it nothing can keep him away from it he will do everything like Jacob but he wants the Beth right he will stand there I don't care if it cost every friend he has got if it cost his job if it cost his church members if it cost everything he will still hold to it because he can help it there is something in him moving him the Deep call into the deep there you are something in him Hallelujah yes sir there's someone that cannot run away from the presence of God everyone can choose to go one time the hold the multitude and all the people left and Jesus said Peter where are the multitude he said your seron has scattered them all Oh my he said then let us wait for the afternoon service I'll pre the same sermon again he pre the same sermon and the 70s left he said Peter what happened he said the multitud left in the morning session the 70s has also left right Peter what what are you doing here then won't you join them W you go with them he said Lord to whom shall we go so I know this message let people depart from the message but you cannot go because it is personalized it is revealed to you amen hallelujah and nobody can pull Revelation from a child of God right it is for you and you only you cannot impart it for me I cannot impart it for you it is a personal revelation for you hallah yes amen the message this evening recognizing responding to the call for service right resp amen amen now we read in the in the Book of Romans all things not part not part all things work for good who are those people there are category of people that this thing pertain to them all things work for good to them that love the [Applause] Lord and these people are predestinated to see the day that they living in and the message of their day you have been called to see what you are seeing today if you're not here this message will not be here if you not here God will not send Abram right that's right brother because you here on Earth you supposed to receive your message of your day and the message is always carried by a prophet to bring the word of God to bring the people back to the way it is the work of a prophet not a bishop that's right amen that's right every man you are called for a responsibility in the munning from the presence of God that is 65 tap number 0 217 amen paragraph 9 I Every Man Has To Face up to that all right that is God a responsibility before God you just take for instance look at Noah look at Moses look at Elijah every age they has to face up to a responsibility and they have to do it but that is the reason they were sent in the hour right that's right amen Noah in his scientific age how he has to face up to a thing that was unscientific you understand see it it was all scientific rather why they said said it is go it isn't going to rain out from the sky they never had rain to drop out of the heavens now he has to face up to it God said it was going to rain and then he then faith without W is dead listen to this the prophet said I believe it and don't make an act you believe you don't make any act right all right when you believe make an act and let it see you understand you say you believe you don't make any act just like the message you say oh I believe it and you don't make any act we want to see action you want to see some demonstration to prove what you are talking about not I believe I believe Don't Preach me brother a seron leave me a seron [Applause] hallelujah amen amen recognizing and responding to the call yes you must recognize what God is doing in your age amen if you cannot recognize what God is doing you can never be part of God right because it is alled to every generation a portion of the scripture for the scripture to fulfill your day and you must be part of your scripture not yesterday's scripture not tomorrow but today this is your day yes sir amen Brethren look at the underlying word call those that are called predestinated for knowledge he's for knowledge he for them before the foundation of the world when did God make that compilation he compiled the names before the foundation of the world sir your name was put in the land Book of Life in his memory there was a book of record in heaven and that book is Jesus Christ Glory Hallelujah that's the book right and that was the book that was also sealed and he was the one that broke the seals he is the book and he broke himself to reveal himself to you right amen hallelujah so you can know your husband you can know your Redeemer you can know him and then you can fellowship with him that was his purpose of creating you but Satan dislocated you you have to be brought back to your position am amen am Hallelujah truth recognizing and responding amen amen look at Andrew and his friends Andrew Peter Nat and pH what happened to them they were also like ordinary people that was walking on the street people talk they were Co equal brother you were living in this city you are not coequal the people on the street you are different yes sir yeah you are different because there something sit in you they can never understand said you this sisters that dress decently he said you are a whip in God's hand God will use you to whip this adul generation you are a whip hallu so yes s in prison read that you are amen no man can come to God except you are call you understand you can never come to Jesus except he calls you that is why when Jesus was on Earth he was making a calling he passed by many people he found Peter and he found James he found Matthew at the task call and he called him he might have passed many people why did he call them they were not predestinated why be called to this message today my friend you are predestinated to say what you are seeing amen amen hallelujah it is my predestination that is why when you see people leaving the message don't worry pray for them the Bible say if you can reconcile them let us reconcile them but if they cannot be reconciled leave them because to begin with they are not part of us my God Jes how could people just Taste of this heavenly gift and come out to deny this Revelation there's something wrong somewhere you understand now when it is revealed to you the prophet said the Mighty the Mighty God unveil before us paragraph 133 sorry I have some cold tonight we are getting into tonight we are getting into there is raising up among the group can comparism somebody try to act like it and live a different life they can drink they can smoke women can live anyhow most any way they want to and the just like the world and stay home and watch television and the things of the world and still call themselves Pentecostals they are trying to impersonate a genu it is never been revealed to them yet when it is revealed it is glorious and something takes that out of you when you walk in there you become a veil it is just it would it it can't work and to impersonate it is death is that right yes sir yes that is why it is important you must have the genour don't try to impersonate if you don't understand this message hold on to it amen pray God will reveal it to you don't just be a pretender because somebody is jumping you also jumping wait until you get somebody something to jump don't jump when you see somebody jumping amen hallelujah you understand amen that is responding to the Revelation that God is revealing to you in this day you have to respond to that okay sorry now he said there is something in the predestinated that makes him recognize God's representative in his day there is something in you he said now in the message the resurrection of love Lazarus the resurrection of Lazarus 53 T number 1122 1122 parag then I start up there said she said yes Lord I believe everywhere of it I believe that you are the Son of God that was to come into the world that was Mar speaking there that there is God representative he is a brok brokenhearted woman there is a dead man lying over there this brokenhearted woman with perfect Faith watch that is coming recognizing this gift of God here the Son of God greatest gift ever give to the world giving him his right title giving him his right worship saying I believe that you are the Son of God and what what what whatever you ask God God will give it to you something got to happen yes said yes Lord I believe it I believe that you are the Son of God that was to come into the world right when you get that Revelation and you are convinced that you have to pull something from God's representative nothing can stop [Applause] you said most of usra you are your son is sick and you call him you call him you call him he refuse coming and after that your son is dead you see the face of BR coming what you see what a hypocrit you are not coming to my house I call you in the time of difficulty in the time of need you refuse now my baby is dead what is your business in my home most of us will really treat this man in that manner but not matter he call for Jesus he call for Jesus he call for Jesus refused going he knew what he was doing if you are patient with God you will see the glory of God most of the time we not patient recognizing what God is in the picture to [Music] do thank you Lord Master the Lord your friend is dead but I know you see he didn't say that you know I know that whatever you ask it will be given to you Hallelujah whatever you ask it will be given to you because she has believed that in in in this past there was a shite woman that also got a baby and then this baby died and this sh woman he respected God's representative on Earth he s all the way people discourage her like you are being discouraged maybe that people are disappointing you but she took unto her faith and said regardless of all the opposition I will prosper the Lord will prosper my [Music] [Applause] way the husband even frustrated her it's not necessary you go you can never find a man of God he said I God will prosper me so M has read this in the scripture and he was convinced that if has happen to it happened to the sh my woman then God's representative can do something in her situation all right most of the time when you have comparism it brings faith that is why when we read this Bible we accommodate faith because we see characters that God dealt with and how they stay faithful to God and we see the results it Give Me Faith when I read this characters that is why it is good to read the Bible so that it will give you Faith amen recognizing and then responding look at Saul I mean Samuel when some was just a kid and then was just old man his eyes were going deam God was looking for somebody that he could use instead of En yeah yes sir and the voice came the night samel Sam Sam God was calling his Prophet for service amen and it is not only Sam it is you God is calling you he's calling individual he's calling each other for service you have something to play you have something to do for God in this generation exactly right amen glory to God and when he calls you for service you must acknowledge you must hear his voice it is not a voice of God is the voice of Jesus Christ calling you for service hallelujah amen thank you Lord amen and when you hear his voice then you'll be convinced that that is God calling you yes sir said anytime he calls again tell him your servant hear it hallelujah amen praise God recognizing look at Paul he has he he he has persecuted the church to the extent that he became that is the boss of persecution that's right he said there was no one as my equal wow Paul was bragging on that said nobody could be My Size when it comes to to persecute the church and yes he meant what you're saying sir but friends when he came into contact with the pill of fire and he heard the voice of God calling him for service that s why persecuted by me I will put you his service and you will suffer for my name's sake the very name that you are persecuted you suffer brother let us be glad when we suffer for Jesus Christ hallelujah amen am don't worry the blessing that Jesus spoke of it goes with persecution so if you are not ready to be persecuted you set step aside and let people go forward because you have to face persecution amen amen it goes with that you understand yes sir so now he said you must recognize you have to recognize what God is doing in your day now listen to the what the prophet said is he said it in the I am the resurrection and the life I'm the resurrection and the life 52 T number 0810 paragra 62 look at that all the darkness all the doubts all the fears everything has passed away she was with Jesus then and he knew if God was in his Prophet that is matter God was in his son if he in Elijah then he's in his son and that was God's representative is that right God has one major representative on Earth at that time he was one he had one elah and as soon as elah was taken then Elisha come you see only one major representative you know know who his major representative is to is today the holy spirit that is his representative brother never pointed people to himself in anywhere there is no scripture there is no message that the prophet pointed people to himself because the Propet said God will take his man he will not take the Holy Ghost God will take you but the Holy Ghost in you will still come back and work on it H amen GL you can't go with the Holy Ghost amen amen it is for you to perform God's will in your day when God finish with you he will pick you put you in your ton but the Holy Ghost will come back sir and continue his work Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah you understand amen sir so our Prophet he's on he has finished his work he has revealed Christ to you he has married you to Christ that is our you understand if has not be here there will have be any marriage ceremony but he has conducted the ceremony we are married to Jesus hallelujah amen amen elah has got no business to go with Isaac into the chamber that's right brother exactly right he has finished his course he finished his purpose yes when Rebecca asks who is that man over there that is your husband that is your the bridegroom he jump from the ass he jump from the Beast and run to the arms of that's Isaac and then Ela [Applause] re finish his work that's right brother amen the prophet has positioned us right in the word we have taken our right position in Christ like I preach the position of a Believer am you have been positioned right by this message that's right that's right that is why we can really BR in the name of Jesus that we have found our position praise God in God Amen thank you Jesus amen you must recognize that amen you must acknowledge your place nobody can take your place that is why you have to respect your ministers I always say it many places this message sorry to say that people don't respect Minister like the Pentecostals Pentecostals they don't joke with their ministers I must tell you the truth but we are not saying that carry it shoulder high no if you carry me high I will ask you to bring me now I don't want hide Hallelujah you understand but let me tell you you must respect your ministers yes they're ordained to lead you to the promised land oh I can read the message myself I can listen to the T wow you need a [Music] sheer the prophet said at the evening time all all the animals they will leave them on the field the M the cattle but the sheep goes into the B amen amen you are a sheep you need a Shepherd Hallelujah that's what the prophet said in the message in his presence 52 and 3 said listen this man is lifted above every one of you the Pastor is above every one of you in this congregation why you why do you say that he is the shepherd He is the Watchman he is on the tower go put him on the tower above every one of you so that he can really see a far off and know that run and far what Satan want to do when you be sleeping this man will be on his knee praying amen you don't know what ministers go through you think it is just an easy job I will preach I will preach come and [Applause] preach come on preach my God Amen in parado in parad 61 T number 1 1210 1 1210 paragraph 1 38 man you who cannot rule your own house and then you try to be a to be preach to take the preachers away and then you want to be a deacon how are you fit to be a preacher in the pit to lead the Church of the Living God and divide for them their inheritance you know the job this man is doing he has to divide for you your inheritance he has to pre this message to position you if you have to prophesy this message this man will put you right in your place and you prophesy for this church when they put you in the Promise Land you have something to do that's right right let me tell you the reason is this you are not really serious you don't want to work for God most of us you don't want to work God we have time to attend to many things of this Earth but when it comes to the things of God we play that is how do you use that that like I said you understand you pray that let me tell you if everybody will take his place in the message and then you play your role and this man position in your inheritance if you have to prophesy prophesy for my edification if you have to speak in Tong speak in Tong for my edification you are here to edify one another but you fail your ARS you don't want to work and you are blaming Pentecostal the gift is here because you don't want to opay them hallelu come onise the Lord and that's is to keep the church in [Music] [Applause] order recognizing and responding now listen Christ The Mystery of God reveal said and stay with your pastor you see he is the Shepherd that is you can put it for them 63 T number 0728 paragraph 81 and stay with your pastor see he is the shepherd and you give him respect amen he will lead you through and because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling the M closer together right and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that is all you understand if he want to tear us apart we will stay and pray if he's one of us he will come and line up amen otherwise God will show him the exit sir hallu you have to recognize your place in this message Hallelujah you are God's asset we are not liabilities we are here to perform we are here to make this church grow you [Applause] [Music] understand amen let me read this for you the prophet said we call ourselves the bride listen so that it will challenge you to bring somebody to church amen the marriage of the Lamb the marriage of the Lamb 62 0121 0121 62 25 so I think that is the way we've preaching the gospel if it don't te you up a little bit and get you Fe your spiritual gastronomist your spiritual gastronomist started right your appetite and make you a little sick to examine yourself with the Bible you see if that old temper and selfishness and ungodliness you the love of the world television and things at night and leaving the church to set empty and the PS set empty when you ought to be out there like Jesus you got his spirit in you trying to get everybody in the country to come to your church to receive Christ and we call ourself the bride of Christ Oh What A pity Oh What A pity friend you understand the hour has come his bread has made herself ready oh made herself ready she laid aside all of these things remember Esther was chosen and the others were rejected and only those that are born again that is God the spirit of God will be chosen on at that day and the Crown of Glory will be set upon her head and the others will be rejected you understand yes sir yes we call ourselves the bride of Christ let us really have that challenge get somebody to Jesus you have to win a soul you understand because you are not to be self said you have to impact life Jesus said you can also impact life to others that is what God has called you for Jesus died for you it is time for you to die for Jesus gory it is your time to die for him you understand yes sir he said now everything is moving to a climas we don't have time to waste we must know the day that we are living in we must compare it to the scripture and see where we have come to Israel they were able to compare scripture and they cried knowing that the time of Deliverance was at hand it is time for us also to know the time of going home is a time everything is pointing to homegoing there is no nothing to waste time again my friends it is time for us to know that we have to get ourself ready yes sir encourage your brother encourage your sister encourage your pastor let everyone do what he can do for God bra said you can put your money in your pocket it's for you it's not for bra you it's for you keep it in your pocket but on the day of reconing you know that you did not do well on the day of reconing if you could not invest in the kingdom of God if you could not your money could not bring a soul your money could not put the missionary on the field we are going all over I think last I was with K in Mexico preaching all over Mexico you understand and the brother said I was surprised the pastor he took me at the airport oh brother your ministry is good next year come again not one cent brother [Applause] by I said that's fine at least you Americans gave me ticket and I went to Mexico to preach you understand so if they say byab it's okay but you must know how we have to invest in the kingdom of God what you doing not that you have got enough it is Passion you have passion for the work of God that is why you are investing into the things of God amen amen amen praise God we don't take it for granted you understand so do what you can do for God there's no time again listen a prophet said in a message identified Christ of all ages said now Jesus said I forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost comes in another age to do the same word or works one word against it will never be forgiven in this world and the world to come that is blasphemy calling the spirit of God an unclean spirit that that is doing the work of God think of that reard now remember keep that on your mind let us not joke with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is on Earth performing the duties of God and he has to use a man but said when I'm gone God will be here still working he will use a man he will use you he will use you he will use you he doesn't use the the wind but said when the pillar of fire came down the angel said Moses I am sending you back to Pharaoh but said why did the angel why didn't the angel go himself why is that the angel didn't go himself no he can't do it he needs a man God always use a man amen that is why you must recognize what God want you to do for him and if you Avail yourself for such and say Lord here I am I am ready for the purpose because for for for God's purpose he has called you that you should acknowledge recognize your position in this generation yes sir that you are part of God's thre that is picture God's work in this age you are part of it sister Play Your Role don't destroy the music say don't

stuff out of you oh pastor Pastor don't like me he like you amen because he want to shape you amen you remember the prophet said look at the Sheep the w belongs to him but when the wool is so thick on

times a man um uh just as that man has to surrender the wife has to surrender as well uh to what the Lord is calling her to and just just recognizing what God has called you to you know and just doing

we we thank the Lord sometime it just need to be shared like that you know and uh we have to be reminded cuz these are the things that that either block our blessings or release our blessings amen amen this is this is this is a commandment from almighty God and you know I know that there are people nowadays that say um Jesus never taught on tithes so they don't feel like uh tithing is is relevant because Jesus never taught on it and uh and I always say that um and I I was just telling the brother this I said well here's what I know and I I know about I know about the Lord I know about God that whatever he put in the scripture uh we should still be doing right and uh even though Jesus didn't teach about it he didn't have to because they was already doing it it right and the other thing is um even though you don't find and I there are there is a scripture where he does talk about ties but but but uh he talks about tith and anise and and coming which is the things that they grew right so in in the Old Testament that's also what they they gave what they grew they tied that to the Lord right so uh so Jesus did talk about that but the other thing is is that um um even though they say Jesus didn't didn't talk about it I know what God put it in the word but I can't see where he took it out the word amen amen so we still do that we still believe that we don't believe in chicken dinners and car washes and amen we pay ties and offering that's how God blesses the church right so amen God is good amen anyone have a a a prayer request or praise report that they just want to mention tonight before we would leave amen we have the microphone there okay I got a couple uh praise reports here and just speaking the mic there for us here you go um I have a friend his name is
