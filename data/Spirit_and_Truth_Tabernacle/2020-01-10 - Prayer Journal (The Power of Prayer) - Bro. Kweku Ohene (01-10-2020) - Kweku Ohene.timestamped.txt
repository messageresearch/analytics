[20:54] a man a man a man a men it can be seated
[20:59] in the presence of the Lord a man just
[21:03] happy to come to the house of Lord
[21:07] tonight there
[21:08] just looking at the scripture and David
[21:11] said I was glad when they said unto me
[21:14] let us go into the house of the Lord and
[21:16] sometimes we go through moments in life
[21:19] where it's just it's a certain
[21:21] excitement about going to God's house
[21:24] and you go with an expectation that he's
[21:27] gonna meet you there it's a man and he
[21:30] told us wherever two or three gathered
[21:32] in my name there my name is man so I
[21:36] came I came with an expectation tonight
[21:38] hey man I'm just I just just just just
[21:42] love the Lord I I was so grateful for
[21:45] him visiting us on Sunday amen but I
[21:48] know there's more where that came from
[21:50] man glory to God so anytime we get
[21:54] together we ought to expect him just to
[21:55] move amen and I miss praise the Lord I
[22:00] know that tonight there was at least one
[22:03] person shared with me that they had a
[22:05] testimony that they wanted to share and
[22:07] I want to make room for that but also
[22:09] wanted to give space for any others that
[22:12] might have something that they want to
[22:14] share tonight you know this is testimony
[22:17] something Lord has done for you a man
[22:21] but if you want to share just let us
[22:22] know in if it will make a room for you
[22:24] tonight a man but it's time I've had
[22:27] Brotherhood sway come he's gonna come in
[22:29] and share and it will lead us often
[22:30] anybody else that want to come a man
[22:32] come on a man you can god bless you all
[22:42] I really got bless you all
[22:46] I appreciate all you guys I'm excited to
[22:50] be here I'm always excited to come to
[22:52] church it's always a battle so every
[22:55] time I get here it's like I already won
[22:57] just just to even walk through this door
[22:59] I already won the Lord is fighting he is
[23:02] truly fine I actually want to read a
[23:06] scripture because this scripture kind of
[23:08] backs up my testimony so I think if you
[23:10] have a testimony that's backed up by
[23:12] Scripture is a testimony you know so
[23:17] it's a second Corinthians 6:10 says as
[23:21] sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor
[23:25] yet making many rich as having nothing
[23:29] and yet possessing all things and then
[23:33] another one that you guys probably never
[23:35] heard this Romans 8:28 and it says and
[23:45] we know that all things work together
[23:48] for good to them that love God to them
[23:52] who are called according to his purpose
[23:56] that we ought to remember that his
[23:59] purpose you know a lot of times we want
[24:00] to according to our prayers
[24:03] so those those scriptures I wanted to
[24:09] read it because I wanted to say exactly
[24:11] but I know those and I used those on a
[24:14] daily basis for me and something
[24:18] happened the other day and out of many
[24:21] other things to happen and I'm pretty
[24:23] sure it's the same situation with all of
[24:24] you guys because we have daily hourly
[24:27] testimonies but this one like kind of
[24:29] stuck out and it was kind of like
[24:31] burning inside to say so I was
[24:34] coke brother Jack I said there's a
[24:36] testimony that's just been burning for
[24:38] me saying it so I wanted to share theirs
[24:43] all God cares for us and he truly when
[24:53] when you have something as small as as
[24:55] as that thing could be if it's something
[24:57] that means something to you then he
[24:59] actually will give it to you if it's
[25:05] according to his purpose so as long as
[25:07] you your your with the word if you can
[25:09] even if it's something naturally I
[25:11] believe that God will like just like our
[25:15] kids you know like our kids they there's
[25:17] certain things that might not be like
[25:18] exactly like me like you really need it
[25:23] but we love them and we'll kind of like
[25:25] sneak you know behind my wife kind a
[25:29] little bit and kind of like you know so
[25:30] God does the same thing to us and and
[25:32] and I he proves that to me so much so I
[25:35] am personally in my vehicle I I love my
[25:39] vehicle my vehicles just smells really
[25:42] well I like to keep it smelling brand
[25:45] new and people tell me they did so good
[25:48] and I in sometimes it's dirty on the
[25:50] outside but I always keep the inside key
[25:52] it's just something that makes me feel
[25:53] better and so I do that and um my other
[25:58] truck the previous truck one time I had
[26:02] got in the morning with a cup of coffee
[26:04] and something happened I spill the
[26:08] coffee all over me all over the car I
[26:11] literally this montón that whole car
[26:13] took the dash out of the seats the
[26:15] center console to clean that vehicle
[26:17] because I was not driving with the
[26:19] vehicle to smell like coffee so it's
[26:21] something small but there's something
[26:23] within this testimony that shows God and
[26:26] that's all I'm trying to do you know is
[26:27] for you guys to see that he cares for us
[26:30] you know so when I bought my new truck
[26:34] I actually out of all the things that
[26:37] were going on when I was buying that
[26:38] vehicle I this this little thing that I
[26:41] say God I said lord please don't ever
[26:43] let her cup of coffee spilling this one
[26:46] I I literally asked God that that this
[26:49] why this testimony is big to me because
[26:51] I remember that little thought as I was
[26:53] buying the truck I said do not please
[26:56] don't take coffee it's spelling here you
[26:59] know so so basically I when I leave my
[27:02] house I am really strong he grabs my
[27:05] kids and my wife I'm really strong about
[27:07] being prayed up we need to be prayed up
[27:09] so I I'm gonna say that I pray every
[27:13] single second sometimes the devil really
[27:17] fights you but I make the point of
[27:19] always praying in the morning and
[27:21] particularly with that when I get in my
[27:24] vehicle before I leave my house I always
[27:26] pray and sometimes the double wants to
[27:28] give you like this this starlight you
[27:31] keep praying like protect me protect me
[27:33] give me a make sure this is happy every
[27:36] single the God already heard the devil
[27:37] like literally puts these stars in your
[27:39] hand so I make a point of praying a
[27:41] couple of days before that as soon as
[27:44] you leave in the house I'm thinking
[27:45] where I'm going I'm calling this
[27:46] customer I'm gonna do this so the devil
[27:49] wants to make you really busy because he
[27:50] knows that I make a point it means
[27:52] something to me for me to pray before I
[27:54] leave this said protection that I like
[27:56] to carry so I've been leaving the house
[27:59] I hit the corner I'm driving down the
[28:01] road getting pray I stopped right there
[28:04] in the middle of the road and I pray and
[28:06] I just closed my eyes and like really
[28:08] pray now you know sometimes we say well
[28:10] I'm driving and I'm praying and no no no
[28:12] I want it stopped and I wanna I want God
[28:14] to really look at me and look at my
[28:16] situation I must stop everything and I'm
[28:19] going to pray so I've been did that a
[28:21] couple of times and I stopped in the
[28:22] middle of the road
[28:23] this particular day which I believe was
[28:25] yesterday of the day before I got in the
[28:28] vehicle I have my cup of coffee
[28:31] and I have it on the top like this and
[28:32] I'm thinking of all the things that I'm
[28:35] where I'm going and all that and I'm I'm
[28:37] pulling out I'm gonna cross the gay and
[28:39] I say not today I'm praying before I I I
[28:43] slam on the brakes and when I slam on
[28:46] the brakes the cup of coffee like that I
[28:49] just brewed when everywhere like on me
[28:53] like all over my clothes like I had to I
[28:56] put it in park I jump out of the vehicle
[28:59] coffee
[29:00] it was I had to literally go inside and
[29:04] change socks boxers sure every like cuff
[29:08] coffee all over me so as soon as that
[29:11] happened and the way I could explain it
[29:13] was like the Holy Spirit really really
[29:17] like it's like it works it works it's
[29:21] the only thing I believe the Kipps keeps
[29:23] us in line with God because without it I
[29:27] would have stepped out of the car I
[29:28] would have been cursing I would have
[29:31] been like my whole day would have been
[29:33] ruined this like so when I step out I
[29:35] can actually feel something wanting to
[29:38] go a certain way and something directing
[29:40] me to say something things so I stepped
[29:43] out I said all those feelings were
[29:45] saying but I said all as well you know I
[29:48] said all it's well and I thought right
[29:51] then and there of Romans 8:28 that's the
[29:54] first scripture they came so I left the
[29:56] trunk open like that and think you know
[29:59] like what happened in there like I
[30:01] didn't want to look in there because
[30:02] what was gonna what I'm gonna find
[30:04] so I said I'm just gonna go up there I
[30:06] took out I have a another cover I have
[30:09] like a bunch of covers on the seats took
[30:11] all those things out whatever through
[30:13] when insight changed all my clothes in
[30:16] as I was going inside I was opening the
[30:18] door
[30:18] I started praising God I said thank you
[30:22] Jesus
[30:23] I said praise God coffee all over my
[30:26] truck thank Jesus praise the Lord I was
[30:29] I went inside and praising God I said
[30:30] thank you Jesus glory be to God but
[30:32] inside I'm literally hurting to where
[30:36] what I'm gonna find
[30:37] so change there was a quote a birth
[30:43] Brandon that he said if the spirit of
[30:46] Elijah when make John act like Elijah
[30:52] then the Holy Spirit should make us act
[30:55] like Jesus you know so I believe that
[30:58] that's what was happening at that at
[30:59] that point with me so I change I walk
[31:04] outside it's still dark yeah that day I
[31:07] was trying to leave early I wanted to
[31:09] get it a nice head start wanted to pull
[31:11] up to the place when it was just getting
[31:13] daylight
[31:13] I'm gonna have a good day today so
[31:16] anyways I go back to the car and I'm
[31:20] like here we go so I go in there and I
[31:23] start looking and there's no coffee on
[31:27] the center console I'm like okay well it
[31:30] came off the center console there's no
[31:32] coffee there
[31:33] there's not one drop of coffee on the
[31:36] seat right my I have a all weather map
[31:43] like a floor mat and there was coffee
[31:47] all over it was full but it's an all
[31:49] weather map so I carefully grabbed the
[31:51] weather mat and I pull it out and I'm
[31:55] looking around and I'm like alright so I
[31:58] grab some rags and I'm like I'm about to
[31:59] clean this thing up it's gonna get clean
[32:02] right now before I leave so I can't find
[32:04] one drop of coffee in that view I start
[32:09] putting my nose on the carpet that's me
[32:12] I'm lying you're gonna find I go in
[32:13] between the seats on the seats I'm
[32:15] looking around
[32:17] brothers and sisters not one drop of
[32:21] coffee touched my beautiful it was all
[32:26] over me it was all over the carpet it
[32:28] was all over they covered their I had on
[32:30] top of the seat but that car I was in
[32:32] and I'm driving so I I got in the
[32:35] vehicle and I'm kind of like like like
[32:39] not realizing exactly what's happening
[32:41] or what's going on you know there's not

[36:38] car is coming upon a hundred thousand
[36:40] miles and I say about ninety five
[36:45] thousand maybe a little bit more than
[36:47] that even before that my car I had a
[36:53] problem when I was turning 2 left 4
[36:55] right
[36:55] the axles so I took it in to Lexus
[36:59] because I bought it from there and they
[37:01] said that they couldn't hear anything
[37:03] the man took it out and everything and
[37:05] he didn't hear anything
[37:06] he said well take it to Toyota because
[37:09] you know this is a Toyota and they would
[37:12] be more sensitive to the sound so I said
[37:15] you know what I'm gonna wait until this
[37:17] get real bad so I know that they won't
[37:20] be sending me back and I did so while I
[37:23] was gone
[37:24] doing the Thanksgiving holiday my
[37:26] son-in-law took it to Toyota and where
[37:30] he thought it was one side I knew it was
[37:32] two they said was the left and the right
[37:34] I said great so I had been praying and
[37:37] asking God I said Lord before this car
[37:40] hit 100,000 miles
[37:42] everything that's major that's under
[37:45] warranty I'm asking you to get it done
[37:47] for me so one Sunday morning I could
[37:51] have been about
[37:53] ninety-eight thousand by then I got up
[37:56] in the air
[37:57] there was no air I say wow okay so I
[38:01] took it in and they said it was
[38:05] something I don't know what it was and
[38:07] they fixed it and the air started
[38:09] blowing well say now I'm about ninety
[38:15] nine five four then the car I noticed I
[38:23] was driving and I had someone in the car
[38:27] and I kept feeling I said god there's
[38:28] something going on with this air here
[38:30] it's just not right
[38:31] and then I had someone else in the car
[38:34] and the young lady said yes you need to
[38:35] get that check I said yes so you driving
[38:39] people around so I did and I called my
[38:42] son-in-law he said take it there right
[38:44] now take it right now so I did and they
[38:48] said when I took it I seen I believe the
[38:52] first yeah I've seen a manager and he
[38:55] said where you gonna have to pay a
[38:57] hundred twenty-nine and you'll get the
[38:59] money back and this and that what the
[39:01] warranty I said no I don't have to pay
[39:02] anything before I said look it up so
[39:08] anyway when he it happened and he said
[39:11] okay so whenever he did look at it they
[39:15] have put dying it from before and they
[39:17] realized they said this is something
[39:20] going I don't know what the compress or
[39:22] whatever it is but now it is blowing
[39:25] very very cold and I'm at ninety nine
[39:30] five ninety nine six so I said well Lord
[39:34] is not a hundred thousand yet I still a
[39:36] I think if there's anything else I
[39:39] know that you're gonna do it and I give
[39:41] Him praise falling
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:45] praise the Lord thank God for watching
[39:49] over sis just the birds you have
[39:51] something you want to share god bless
[39:59] you Saints many of you've already heard
[40:02] this testimony but I feel like it's be
[40:05] robbery not to share with the whole
[40:07] church the sisters I shared some with
[40:10] the accident that I was in on the way to
[40:13] church over New Year's Eve night like
[40:17] brother Josue was saying you know
[40:19] praying before you leave and I remember
[40:21] just sitting at my drive praying not
[40:25] just for myself but all the driver
[40:26] drivers out down the road with it being
[40:29] New Year's Eve night you got all kind of
[40:32] people coming out so I'm on my way to
[40:36] church excited about coming for the new
[40:38] year you know Lord I made it I just
[40:41] about made it into the new year and I'm
[40:43] sitting there at the light at our
[40:46] community and military just sitting
[40:50] there thinking about the service glad to
[40:52] get here and the traffic was going north
[40:56] and south they had to ride away and
[40:58] there was a man in the left hernán lane
[41:02] he was headed south and he was in the
[41:05] left turning lane and traffic was really
[41:08] really moving pretty fast and he decided
[41:10] that he was gonna try to make a
[41:11] left-hand turn and you know I'm watching
[41:15] this play out before men I can't believe
[41:17] this man is trying to make the sternness
[41:19] of course there it caused him to be hit
[41:23] by at least a couple other vehicles and
[41:27] he hit another man too in the center and
[41:29] he his car started spinning start
[41:34] spinning and that car I'm looking at
[41:36] this car coming straight at me this is
[41:38] right and there's no nothing to cover me
[41:40] because I'm the first one in line there
[41:42] and all like the only thing that would
[41:45] come out of my mouth is Jesus Jesus
[41:49] Jesus this car coming Lord Jesus
[41:54] and I tell you truly there's power in
[41:58] the name of Jesus the car came that car
[42:02] hit me but it was buffeted that's the
[42:06] only way I could see it because the
[42:08] impact that it should have had it did
[42:12] not have that car hit me and either it
[42:15] bounced back or it pushed me back I'm
[42:17] not sure which one it is and I couldn't
[42:21] believe that it was such a low impact
[42:25] that he hit me and looking at his car
[42:28] his car was totaled it was on both sides
[42:31] both sides were just all messed up wheel
[42:34] was all dangling what have you and my
[42:37] car that was very minimal damage that
[42:40] was done and about the worst thing
[42:43] happened to me as I sat there and I
[42:45] froze up I just froze up and once I
[42:48] realized I was okay I got out of the car
[42:50] and made some phone calls and
[42:52] what-have-you but I was telling the
[42:56] sisters it's like the enemy tries to
[42:59] steal that from me because looking at
[43:02] everybody else so damaged and yet me
[43:05] with minimal damage in them each other
[43:07] you know that didn't happen that didn't
[43:09] happen to you but you know I the Lord
[43:12] allowed me to get just enough damage to
[43:15] say well if it didn't happen to me what
[43:19] happened to my car
[43:22] how did this damage get on my car cause
[43:24] it wasn't that way before and
[43:25] what-have-you but I truly thank the Lord
[43:28] for being a ever-present help in the
[43:30] time of trouble truly he was and that's
[43:34] something that I'll never forget it was
[43:37] just that close to coming into the new
[43:39] year in my life could have been wiped
[43:40] out just like that and he was right
[43:42] there on the scene thank you thank God
[43:46] for the Lord allowing sister Gina to be
[43:48] over here that night because has she
[43:53] heard that her mom was in an accident
[43:54] she's over in Okeechobee I can imagine
[43:57] how the enemy with a play with her mind
[43:59] and for sister Carmen sister Tina to
[44:02] come stand with me because I was shaken
[44:04] up about it I really was shaking out
[44:06] I'm okay I went to get myself checked
[44:08] out it's very little
[44:10] it's just concerning but I just I just
[44:13] had to share that again I'm sorry if I
[44:15] talk too much about it but it was just
[44:19] it's just amazing it really is amazing
[44:21] what God did for me that night it truly
[44:26] was a year of the incredible down to the
[44:28] very end to the very end certainly thank
[44:37] God for proving himself to be Jehovah
[44:39] Nissi a man a member of the Troy I saw
[44:42] you had your hand up
[44:43] a man praise God praise the Lord since
[44:51] the brief I see testimonies about cars
[44:54] this this evening and I just want to
[44:58] give a testimony about this past Sunday
[45:04] after communion my wife had to go to the
[45:09] stop by the store and I finally made it
[45:12] home and she give me a call and say well
[45:14] the car won't start
[45:16] she said well I'm gonna see if I keep
[45:17] trying to we had once before had a
[45:20] little issue with it not starting but
[45:24] rest let it stop for a while and after
[45:26] about three minutes or so it finally
[45:30] started so I felt like it was finally
[45:32] start it'll ever start just keep trying
[45:34] I think it's that's been a flat spot on
[45:36] the starter or something along those
[45:37] lines so she just kept trying to kept
[45:40] trying I kept texting and saying how
[45:41] about now not yet on that so about an
[45:43] hour or so passed by and she said well
[45:46] can't you come and get me I say yeah I'm
[45:47] gonna come on up there and she said well
[45:50] what we gonna do I say just leave it
[45:51] here cuz I was off the next day and I'll
[45:53] take care of it tomorrow
[45:55] so she had to go to work the next day so
[45:58] I got up and took her to work and I
[46:03] dropped her off and all my way back to
[46:06] go and check on the car my truck
[46:09] overheats so I'm on the side of the road
[46:11] and
[46:13] the one cause in the parking lot at the
[46:15] store and my trucks overheated on the
[46:17] side of the road so I finally got my
[46:19] truck too worried about it
[46:20] just water pouring out off from
[46:22] underneath everywhere and so I've got
[46:25] some water and I refill my reservoir and
[46:28] my radiator and everything and it was
[46:30] able to get me where I was going so I
[46:32] went straight to a mechanic that I was
[46:36] gonna have look at her car and as I was
[46:38] talking to the mechanic I went inside
[46:40] when I came back out and I'm looking at
[46:41] this part of this stream of water coming
[46:44] from my car and it's oil and water mixed
[46:48] in so yeah I pay me that's what I would
[46:50] look on my face oh no oh no not oil
[46:54] right that's exactly how I felt so I was
[46:57] like oh gosh what I put on it was head
[47:00] gasket if i crack a block or whatever so
[47:03] that basically and you know you my
[47:04] mechanic I called him I totally said
[47:06] well he said uh how you think how you
[47:09] feel about my heart to get you a new
[47:11] vehicle so I'm like well a lord if this
[47:14] was your your hand on pushing me and
[47:16] nudging me in that direction it's time
[47:18] to get a new vehicle you know then it's
[47:20] just time to get a new vehicle so I was
[47:22] kind of you know just kind of just kind
[47:25] of distraught by that I was able to put
[47:27] more water in it just enough to get me
[47:29] home and when I got home I prayed about
[47:31] it I said you know I'm not gonna let the
[47:33] devil have the victory so I talked to
[47:35] Lord say Lord whatever your will is you
[47:37] know I spoke with my wife I said lord I
[47:40] thank God that you've that you've given
[47:42] us this transportation and Lord we've
[47:44] put these automobiles to your service so
[47:48] and the devil is just trying to disrupt
[47:51] what what you're doing this is not our
[47:53] battle this is a battle between you and
[47:55] the enemy and we're just kind of in the
[47:57] cart in the middle so whatever you have
[47:59] prepared for us or whatever you're doing
[48:02] loyal I you know I've just be
[48:04] willingness whatever so I'm not gonna
[48:06] let this get me down I'm not gonna get
[48:08] upset I'm not gonna get razzled about it
[48:11] we're just gonna trust in the Lord and
[48:13] we're just going to go on so I was then
[48:16] I found out I put more water in the in
[48:18] the reservoir and I went to the to see
[48:22] about her car finally got it towed to
[48:24] the mechanic and the mechanic said I
[48:28] went and got the part he looked at it he
[48:31] said well as this and that night her car
[48:34] was back on the road he fixed her car
[48:36] that night and the next night he looked
[48:40] at my truck

[48:58] just been adding water and water I had
[49:01] two mechanics looked at it I can't tell
[49:03] water water coming from I don't know
[49:04] where the water coming from we can't
[49:06] find anywhere and I thought I was losing
[49:09] water in the engine I said oh man so I I
[49:13] this is gonna be a big cost and
[49:15] everything so I'm gonna just keep adding
[49:16] water I drive around with a five gallon
[49:18] jug in my truck just in case you know I
[49:21] could just refill the water and keep

[55:29] thou would bless me indeed and enlarge
[55:32] my cost and that thy hand might be with
[55:35] me and that thou would keep me from evil
[55:38] that it may not grieve me and God
[55:41] granted him that which he requested amen
[55:44] god bless you shall we be seated
[55:48] our Lord is good and merciful amen thank
[55:51] so wonderful testimonies and Allah bless
[55:54] you it's enriches the SU amen
[55:57] so that when we read from the Bible
[55:59] things that loaded for the sins of old
[56:01] it triggers something in our hearts God
[56:04] the same God added for the sins is the
[56:05] same guy that is in asking the same
[56:07] thing for us and even more abundantly
[56:09] amen
[56:10] one time and no one could teach more RAM
[56:12] said that if the Lord did it for most
[56:15] people what about us we are more we
[56:19] stand in a more honorable position and
[56:20] post people because this whole thing's
[56:22] half in half but we have since the
[56:25] overall everything in us is revealed to
[56:27] us
[56:28] amen and I want to title is not too much
[56:32] of a sermon but I want to title it a
[56:34] prayer journal the power of prayer
[56:38] prayer journal the power of prayer amen
[56:43] or if you want to call it you can call
[56:44] it effective way of praying amen and I
[56:49] want to do one more scripture I wish a
[56:51] few more scriptures then now I'll go
[56:53] ahead let's read a revelation chapter
[56:56] ten verse eight to 11 revelation 10 8 to
[56:59] 11 which is a revelation is a popular
[57:04] scriptures
[57:05] but we are not going to read more about
[57:07] the mysteries or the seven seventh
[57:10] messenger but something that pertains to
[57:12] you and I amen revelation chapter 10
[57:16] verse 8 to 11 and a voice which I heard
[57:23] from heaven speak unto me again and said
[57:26] go until the little book which is open
[57:28] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[57:31] upon the sea and upon the earth and I
[57:34] went on to the angel and he said unto me
[57:36] and said unto him give me the little
[57:39] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[57:41] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[57:45] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as a
[57:48] knee and I took a little book out of the
[57:50] Angels hand and added up and it was in
[57:52] my mouth sweet as a knee and as soon as
[57:55] I had eaten it my belly was bitter and
[57:57] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[58:00] for many peoples and nations and tongues
[58:03] and kings amen so our emphasis will be
[58:06] on the eleventh miss and he said unto me
[58:08] thou must prophesy again before many
[58:11] peoples nations tongues and kings amen
[58:15] and now revelation 10 as God is a
[58:19] three-foot scriptures verse 1 the mighty
[58:22] angel is Jesus Christ himself who put
[58:25] one foot on the land and one foot on the
[58:26] sea the land sees the multitude of
[58:29] people it's not just a it's not a
[58:31] physical see a physical land but a lot
[58:33] put his power this is people the land is
[58:37] people he's put his power in you and I
[58:38] by the Holy Ghost by the eternity new by
[58:43] the new birth amen so the Lord has
[58:46] fulfilled a portion chapter 1 the Lord
[58:48] has done it already now chapter 7 which
[58:50] you already know in the days of the
[58:51] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[58:53] begin to speak the mysteries of God
[58:55] should be finished as is given to seven
[58:57] a profit which is what this william
[58:59] brangham
[59:00] elijah he finished his portion or the
[59:02] mysteries of God writing from Genesis to
[59:05] Revelation the last verse of Revelation
[59:07] is cleared up is open to us amen
[59:10] there's no more mysteries it as a
[59:13] mystery is already been opening maybe
[59:15] the Lord have not seen it yet amen
[59:17] it might be mystery to me but a lot has
[59:20] remember a jack has seen it already but
[59:22] maybe I'll come to it amen glory
[59:25] hallelujah so there's no more mystery in
[59:26] the Bible there's nothing that God is
[59:28] now going to bring another measurement
[59:30] messenger to reveal no it's already
[59:33] finished explain he said read an amen
[59:36] now this 8 to 11 but braum if I searched
[59:40] a message maybe I could be wrong but I
[59:43] never found an aversive abramius in the
[59:46] scripture each to 11 for himself
[59:48] just like Jesus when you read a read a I
[59:50] think Isaiah 55 he read about the first
[59:53] coming and he put a stop because it came
[59:56] as a lamp he didn't touch the second
[59:57] coming and he closed the book and put it
[59:59] there because it was one at a time so
[1:00:01] it's
[1:00:02] impotent william brangham it was an
[1:00:04] inscription he didn't touch it and God
[1:00:07] does in British scriptures each eleven
[1:00:10] is reserved for the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:13] that is you and I amen that is our
[1:00:17] scripture and if you don't fulfill it is
[1:00:19] going to light it the devil cannot
[1:00:20] fulfill it they don't know nothing about
[1:00:23] this if you give a kick to a cut maybe
[1:00:28] the kick will not do over the card but
[1:00:30] if you get a kick to a man or a woman
[1:00:32] you do you take you take of it amen
[1:00:34] so you and I it is our scriptures to
[1:00:37] fulfill the trance the people's the
[1:00:40] tribe the tongues the kiss are you and I
[1:00:42] amen and that is our scripture that is
[1:00:45] the scripture that God has given to you
[1:00:47] it is your power amen that when you
[1:00:50] stand on this which are no demon no
[1:00:52] devil can defeat you because it's the
[1:00:53] Lord wait for you praise be to God
[1:00:57] because when we no opposition

[1:01:25] just like a lamb is modern a land is
[1:01:27] more than gold
[1:01:28] that when we step into the scriptures it
[1:01:30] open another world is Vanessa lesser
[1:01:32] dimensions for us blessed be the name of
[1:01:35] the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:01:38] defeat every enemy you can get rid of

[1:03:40] to attend 2020 and I just Kusum
[1:03:44] scriptures first Chronicle for 9 to 10
[1:03:46] that is the prayer of Jabez his name or
[1:03:49] job as bitterness but the Lord changes
[1:03:50] in the money pretty simple prayer now
[1:03:53] Esther chapter 4 15 to 17 and then
[1:03:56] chapter 5 1 2 3 esta and his and her
[1:03:59] people they were in trouble and that
[1:04:02] I've wanted to wipe them widely
[1:04:03] juice hour from the earth extended from
[1:04:05] existence but then they went to prayer
[1:04:07] with his uncle Dupree for three days and
[1:04:09] three night and on a thirty he went
[1:04:12] before the king and the King said even
[1:04:14] half of the kingdom I'll give it to you
[1:04:16] and I was thinking about it half of the
[1:04:18] kingdom the scriptures are all types and
[1:04:20] shadows now esta it was the natural
[1:04:23] kingdom and half of the King know but
[1:04:25] now we are not looking for natural
[1:04:26] kingdom but now we already have that
[1:04:28] celestial kingdom you habits you find it
[1:04:30] before you drop on earth so it doesn't
[1:04:32] you already have eternal life you only
[1:04:34] needed to know by the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:04:35] so that is already settled but then what
[1:04:38] is the half of the kingdom you and I are
[1:04:39] looking for right here on earth amen
[1:04:43] you have a kingdom here when you free
[1:04:45] the lost prey I said a lot our Father
[1:04:47] that will be done on earth as it is in
[1:04:50] heaven
[1:04:50] so having it's already settled but on
[1:04:53] earth there are certain terms that is
[1:04:55] yet to be settled amen
[1:04:56] that is the half of the kingdom we are
[1:04:59] battling now amen so that is esta esta
[1:05:03] what is that type and type is a
[1:05:04] scripture that was relating this time
[1:05:06] but one is for food become a platform
[1:05:08] for you and I so in this time that was a
[1:05:12] reality the kingdom that they were
[1:05:13] looking for because they were going to
[1:05:15] kill all the Jews but then when he
[1:05:17] prepared with his uncle or cousin and
[1:05:20] all the Jewish people for it and went
[1:05:22] before the king which wasn't lawful
[1:05:23] because if you go to the king without
[1:05:25] being invited you can't get your head
[1:05:27] cut off so she went with boldness and in
[1:05:30] didn't look at the law but it went
[1:05:32] before about the law and move in the
[1:05:35] supernatural they meant the supernatural
[1:05:38] is beyond a loss of Nietzsche is beyond
[1:05:40] a loss of men
[1:05:41] amen the Lama said that you can do this
[1:05:43] but when God comes in God can override a
[1:05:46] law and give you a heritance
[1:05:48] amen the law can say that when this has
[1:05:51] happened there's no way God can do it
[1:05:54] amen the law was given a charge means to
[1:05:57] a woman who never had a woman whose room
[1:05:59] was operated and taken away the Lord can
[1:06:02] even overcome is the law of nature amen
[1:06:04] so your judge can be your lawyer at
[1:06:09] twenty as well amen so Esther had this
[1:06:12] fever but now you and I have inheritance
[1:06:14] that we need to possess now glory
[1:06:16] hallelujah so that is one of the
[1:06:18] scriptures the other one is revelation
[1:06:20] 10 8:11 the promise for the wife of
[1:06:22] Christ now not in the future but the
[1:06:25] nations the tongues that tribal people
[1:06:27] akin issue an I go inheritance amen then
[1:06:32] the last one is 2nd Kings chapter 2
[1:06:34] verse 9 that is before Elijah was taken
[1:06:37] to glory he asked Elijah what do you
[1:06:39] want me to do for you he said I want
[1:06:41] double portions of your anointing I said
[1:06:44] now has a very hard question but if you
[1:06:47] see me go you get it amen
[1:06:49] and it was so diligent nothing was able
[1:06:52] to change him from focusing on Elijah
[1:06:55] nothing has changed you from deviating
[1:06:58] from the Elijah's message
[1:06:59] so if focus your eyes on the largest
[1:07:02] message every promise the double portion
[1:07:03] is yours amen
[1:07:07] going away from a ladies message but you
[1:07:09] have kept your faithfulness in good
[1:07:11] times and in bad times you sustain him
[1:07:13] with the largest message but I like
[1:07:15] Elijah able to please the sons of the
[1:07:16] prophets said Elijah your master is
[1:07:18] going to be taken away as I shut up I
[1:07:20] know it it doesn't make no difference he
[1:07:23] crossed over the first one tried his
[1:07:25] feet he crossed over Jordan he went to
[1:07:26] another land is the same today you know
[1:07:28] your mother's gonna be taken away say I
[1:07:31] know shut up it doesn't matter
[1:07:33] he stood kept Elijah he didn't let that
[1:07:36] distract us take his focus take his
[1:07:39] concentration
[1:07:40] take his mile from his target he just
[1:07:42] aim at a target and go to a place the
[1:07:45] target asked him now is the time and the
[1:07:48] Lord gave him the double portion he
[1:07:50] asked for Elijah Elijah gave it to him
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] because the Lord was in Elijah Elijah
[1:07:56] was a god on to Elijah amen
[1:07:59] the Lord of Moses who was God on to us
[1:08:01] Guardian skin and a double portion that
[1:08:05] you have given you all your life to
[1:08:06] forsake in the world you forsaken
[1:08:09] everything friends are forsaken you jobs
[1:08:12] prosperity portion is yours
[1:08:16] amen so this man asked me and we said
[1:08:21] the Lord shoot him to pre right here
[1:08:24] right on the left side the topic of the
[1:08:27] prayer the title
[1:08:29] sorry Tropicana he simply did and you
[1:08:32] can write a scripture whatever you want
[1:08:33] on the right side is a testimony and
[1:08:35] Thanksgiving so whatever you want to

[1:08:40] the testimonies the Lord has done for
[1:08:41] you you can just write it the way you

[1:08:46] of God in your heart whatever comes is
[1:08:48] the lot is pass your heart you can write
[1:08:50] briefly then you leave the rest of the
[1:08:52] pages for testimony when the law does it
[1:08:54] Amen so when you should have testimony
[1:08:57] we got to Stuart where we went and he's
[1:09:00] a businessman we went his Baba home we
[1:09:03] prayed for like probably 30 minutes with
[1:09:05] no time when freedom freedom freedom
[1:09:07] period and he asked me a request that I
[1:09:10] should pray for him regarding a lawsuit
[1:09:12] so I said okay give me a notebook as
[1:09:14] okay I'm gonna put your request at the
[1:09:16] first prayer Jonah in the notebook and
[1:09:18] I'm gonna ask God of heaven to do it for
[1:09:21] you so after a couple of months I think
[1:09:23] around me there about he said he did
[1:09:26] send me a paper works there was
[1:09:27] something legalese that he spent already
[1:09:29] fifty thousand and the sound plays so
[1:09:31] much which is bringing so much pressure
[1:09:34] on him his wife is taking ill and it's
[1:09:36] kind of the toll is too much on him so
[1:09:39] we prayed with him and I that was my
[1:09:41] first topic my first prayer Jonah that I
[1:09:44] did and a lot answered his prayer the
[1:09:47] Centrify ways and the case was cleared
[1:09:48] his of the oligarchies
[1:09:52] he's I put my own requests a lot of
[1:09:56] things that I needed to do I put it in
[1:09:58] the Jonah the law did it my school and
[1:10:00] different things it just came in
[1:10:01] succession the law did it for me and a
[1:10:03] lot of requests that I put so many of
[1:10:05] them so when brother Gabriel came I
[1:10:07] shared with him about the prayer request
[1:10:09] we got to meet the man so when he went
[1:10:11] he said his wife has been praying about
[1:10:13] Freyja as well and they also looking for
[1:10:16] a way to prayer so they read DUP the
[1:10:20] probe jabus and he got a book he read I

[1:10:25] and he went back to Columbia
[1:10:27] you know Berg a bro the minister from
[1:10:28] Columbia so he went and he showed his
[1:10:30] people and they took it to another level
[1:10:32] they just like the hood different people

[1:10:36] brother Jack and rajaka and share with
[1:10:38] you sisters and brothers and one of them
[1:10:40] as funny ones was a sister that she was
[1:10:44] going through some problems the husband
[1:10:46] the family the husband has lost a job so
[1:10:49] the first thing she did she said the
[1:10:50] first pitch he didn't ask any requests
[1:10:52] she just wrote friends given unto the
[1:10:54] Lord so one foot patrol of thanked

[1:11:05] forgive me for this believe in your word
[1:11:06] forgive me for doubts and your promises
[1:11:08] so she confessed all as sins and the
[1:11:10] third page

[1:11:37] the surgery it was a couple of dishes
[1:11:40] the cousin how was the surgery said they
[1:11:42] didn't do the surgery so what happened

[1:11:47] cancer is not day
[1:11:49] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of

[1:13:02] she asked them but I said we want to go
[1:13:05] to church with you because we can see
[1:13:06] the power we can see the prayer prayer
[1:13:09] is like an order when you pray smells
[1:13:12] you can hear it
[1:13:14] it doesn't matter how far the person is
[1:13:16] let him go let it let they would take
[1:13:18] him or her how fast fast he can go he's
[1:13:22] still in a palm of the Living God amen
[1:13:24] because if the devil is in the palm of
[1:13:26] the Living God it's just an instrument
[1:13:28] for God to use to create a negative
[1:13:30] contrast so that you can see the
[1:13:32] positive contrast
[1:13:33] amen and the children are now back to
[1:13:36] the church back to the word of the Lord
[1:13:38] so if you have any requests for your
[1:13:40] family for loved ones for the sins
[1:13:42] anybody for your minister for your pasta
[1:13:45] write the name Francis answered Jesus
[1:13:47] wrote the names of she first so much in
[1:13:49] love with the Lord
[1:13:50] she just would join as educated Jonah
[1:13:52] where they ought to wake everywhere
[1:13:54] because the Lord will inspire on
[1:13:55] something she doesn't want to miss it
[1:13:57] so she has a Jonah everywhere it a lot
[1:13:59] Devere
[1:14:00] it something she just write it that is
[1:14:03] your personal Bible that you ready
[1:14:05] because the Bible that what up into esta
[1:14:07] it was recorded hadn't no be recorded
[1:14:09] you and I would have had it to read it
[1:14:12] it was something that was done the Lord
[1:14:14] Almighty did for them and somebody took
[1:14:17] pen did he have the pens that we have
[1:14:19] now where's my pen didn't have the
[1:14:21] fanciful prints alrighty know something
[1:14:22] used to putting in a what they call it a
[1:14:25] ghost thread this stuff like that and
[1:14:28] whatever they could write within those
[1:14:30] times and if somebody had a patient to
[1:14:33] pin it down on a table tablets and
[1:14:35] stones and what screws and furniture or
[1:14:39] wood or something like that
[1:14:40] and now we have it on purpose and iPad
[1:14:42] and fanciful technology to read you know
[1:14:44] you can just lie in your bed and read
[1:14:46] from your iPad but I didn't have it that
[1:14:48] way so we are writing Bible maybe the
[1:14:51] ababa may not last too long
[1:14:52] we will not live here for that long we
[1:14:54] don't know but at least you have a Bible
[1:14:56] something that you pin and when you do
[1:14:58] it the good thing about it is if I pray
[1:15:00] for somebody for example I pray for
[1:15:02] people from different countries a lot of
[1:15:04] my whatsapp sometimes sure but I would
[1:15:06] sweep people different when you go to
[1:15:08] Mexico before every country has their
[1:15:10] own problem cocaine cocaine is like
[1:15:12] candy cocaine is just nothing when I was
[1:15:17] in England when people can sell cocaine
[1:15:19] openly the police don't have time for
[1:15:21] that
[1:15:21] unless they catch you with like a huge

[1:19:47] interested in for other people the Lord
[1:19:49] knows you have a need to the load know
[1:19:51] you have your own problem and as you put
[1:19:53] your problem that I am praying for

[1:20:14] Lord not my standing in need of prayer
[1:20:18] right not my past I love my brother not
[1:20:20] my mom not my dad but it's me a lot so
[1:20:23] if you put yourself in that intercessory
[1:20:25] position put your Salah Jesus Christ as
[1:20:27] a sacrifice Jesus was an Aries was born
[1:20:30] in April somewhere as a sacrifice for us
[1:20:32] william ramos an Aries
[1:20:34] it was one as a sacrifice to shed his
[1:20:36] blood all his life was sacrificed for
[1:20:39] God's people
[1:20:40] amen he wanted to be a cowboy William
[1:20:42] Bramley couldn't get to be a cowboy he
[1:20:44] went to buy a Levi's jeans because was
[1:20:47] from the tribe of Levi
[1:20:48] so his natural life was typing in
[1:20:51] supernatural life him n1 away from it
[1:20:57] wouldn't be a cowboy so he was writing
[1:21:00] his destiny even when he was a little
[1:21:02] boy he was writing poems about his
[1:21:05] ministry when he didn't know
[1:21:06] amen so since that you are going through
[1:21:08] the hardship is a Bible you might not
[1:21:11] know it you might have even
[1:21:12] understanding why do I have to go
[1:21:14] through this why this suffering why this
[1:21:17] issue why this problem why me Lord why
[1:21:21] not other person by your by your life is
[1:21:24] a Bible you might not see it now but the
[1:21:27] Lord will shoot you that my son my
[1:21:29] daughter well done for the father used
[1:21:32] to phone amen
[1:21:33] for your rights in you a you are an a
[1:21:35] under ink holder your body your life was
[1:21:39] a paper that I was writing my scripts on
[1:21:42] amen and so Lord thanks to you if I was
[1:21:45] I was found worthy to be the pepper that
[1:21:48] you prescribed you could scream or
[1:21:50] something on it
[1:21:51] amen so what you go through the clutter
[1:21:54] to get a lot is put in your life through
[1:21:56] the problems and afflictions it's a
[1:21:58] Bible on to others amen glory hallelujah
[1:22:01] to the Lord the Lord is good the this
[1:22:09] some more testimonies I wish time is not
[1:22:13] I wish I wish a trade off so that you
[1:22:15] can take your time and listen to it but
[1:22:18] a few things
[1:22:20] praise be to God the Lord is omnipotent
[1:22:25] and whatever whatever the Lord dwells
[1:22:29] there's so many Putin's around him let's
[1:22:32] even take naturalistic in the time of
[1:22:34] Moses when the Lord came to Mount Sinai
[1:22:36] the sauna became sacred and ora koutou
[1:22:40] the law because that was where the Lord
[1:22:42] was manifest and giving the laws like
[1:22:44] Vibram was in sunset mountain the load
[1:22:46] was bringing a new covenant through
[1:22:48] mooses so not even an animal could touch
[1:22:51] Sinai because it was a sacred ground for
[1:22:53] the Lord now son
[1:22:55] son I mount wasn't him service son Oh
[1:22:59] son said son I right Thomas
[1:23:03] son I thank you my sauna is not a sacred
[1:23:06] animal because a lot is no day by the
[1:23:08] time of Moses it was a sacred ground
[1:23:10] applause I was well now Ramazan I you
[1:23:13] Adam a sauna of this hour you are the
[1:23:16] omnipotent of this hour you had a little
[1:23:18] mess out of this hour so when you when
[1:23:21] you recognize who you are as the you
[1:23:22] added a little omnipotent just like esta
[1:23:25] esta was a little opening potent and
[1:23:27] prayer open the door for the omnipotent
[1:23:29] see to manifest prayer is the key not
[1:23:33] open the omnipotence in your life to
[1:23:36] manifest it's already there
[1:23:37] it just like a crowd you can have a
[1:23:40] beautiful craft fanciful for whatever
[1:23:42] Chevy if you don't have the key to
[1:23:44] studied or remote or something like that
[1:23:46] is useless it can transport you the same
[1:23:50] thing the power of God is not in heaven
[1:23:52] the power of God is in you and I amen
[1:23:56] but an if you know it will anoint your
[1:23:58] soft with prayer so that the power
[1:24:00] manifests the power be detained in you
[1:24:03] forever and once it manifested the power
[1:24:07] is less like MgO God has been Jelena in
[1:24:09] else but when we list the Lord through
[1:24:11] praise the Lord goes to wait is that
[1:24:14] when you talk about me is that when you
[1:24:16] talk about now let all men onto myself
[1:24:18] so when you talk about him through
[1:24:20] praise through testimonies through the
[1:24:22] love of God through songs through
[1:24:24] Thanksgiving through whatever means a
[1:24:26] lot gives it to you you bring a lot into
[1:24:28] manifestation in your life and in the
[1:24:30] life of other people
[1:24:31] amen so let's start this year with
[1:24:34] praise
[1:24:34] generally that even our children the
[1:24:37] little ones give them a new book by
[1:24:38] Cobra so you have no books to write it
[1:24:41] right whatever and you fill your house
[1:24:43] with praise don't worry about a trance
[1:24:45] whatever you think is a headache for you
[1:24:47] put it down and just let the left side
[1:24:50] that is your prayer
[1:24:51] that's a battleground and the right side
[1:24:53] is your victory
[1:24:55] amen is a double portion and you just
[1:24:58] free and believe it go from we're good -
[1:25:00] we're good to school wherever you go to
[1:25:01] come back home look at your pressure now
[1:25:04] pray to the Lord the way you wanted you
[1:25:06] don't have to put your left hand and
[1:25:07] right hand if you forget to do it as a
[1:25:10] lot lease you but you keep your prayers
[1:25:12] on whatever you are like this as I said
[1:25:14] I've fallen in love with the Lord so
[1:25:16] much like I've never done before you
[1:25:19] just generally my prayer and said it
[1:25:22] flows and Allah speak to them when I
[1:25:24] listen to this testimony for that
[1:25:26] anointing it flows from their heart the
[1:25:28] Lord comes out and they do it and the
[1:25:31] poor that started they were struggling
[1:25:32] with it and said each time I hear that
[1:25:34] testimony about what the Lord is doing I
[1:25:36] was compelled and I begin to do it and
[1:25:39] now see my own testimony it's going to
[1:25:41] Deborah - are you somebody in Cuba and
[1:25:43] it's taking fire in Cuba as well about
[1:25:46] prayer because what a devil use of the
[1:25:48] face God's children is that you can take
[1:25:49] your power but if you can stop you from
[1:25:52] manifesting your power you Dan the power
[1:25:57] he cannot take it is a fire but then you
[1:26:00] can create an atmosphere that you lose
[1:26:02] confidence in yourself in the goddess is
[1:26:04] in you you lose your self-image that you
[1:26:08] a daughter you are omnipotent you wanna
[1:26:10] hear to fulfill Revelation chapter 8 so
[1:26:13] Revelation chapter 10 8 to 11 you have a
[1:26:16] scripture that a Lord ordained for you
[1:26:18] before you drop here and nothing can
[1:26:20] take your place that no devil can take
[1:26:23] your children away from you no devil can
[1:26:25] take your loved ones you got all the
[1:26:27] power of God to chase after them with
[1:26:29] faith and bring them back to the Lord
[1:26:31] amen so let's start this yeah with
[1:26:33] prayer left with all our hearts don't
[1:26:36] worry about the past put the past behind
[1:26:38] and now less from now going let's do
[1:26:41] this support our minister our pasta the
[1:26:44] church in prayer and this weed and I do
[1:26:46] overwhelm you amen
[1:26:48] because it allowed did he for one he's
[1:26:50] already done for the race amen
[1:26:52] the law doesn't discriminate he loves
[1:26:55] you amen and so he wanted to pray he
[1:26:58] want us just to Yoda us off to him you
[1:27:01] don't have to drop us off about a lot of
[1:27:02] things which are worse off with if we
[1:27:04] come pray sudden things to take care of
[1:27:06] themself cause there's a dimension in
[1:27:08] you there's a supernatural meaning you
[1:27:10] that certain things you don't have to
[1:27:12] struggle to use of physical force for a
[1:27:14] supernatural force going to display
[1:27:16] there are certain times I'm working I
[1:27:18] see people fightin and I I don't want
[1:27:21] them to fight I know who is behind a
[1:27:23] fight a devil
[1:27:24] it could be a family could be being
[1:27:25] friends but they would create confusion
[1:27:27] but I feel in my heart I wish I can go
[1:27:30] stop them but I can't go do that
[1:27:32] but I pray my heart Lord let peace be in
[1:27:35] them and I see peace riding them right
[1:27:38] there so there's something in you beyond
[1:27:41] your physical limitation in the physical
[1:27:43] we are limited you can do so if I can go
[1:27:45] through this war physically but if they
[1:27:47] say need behind these walls this is
[1:27:50] supernatural been in you and I that a
[1:27:52] supernatural not limited to this meets
[1:27:54] this means is not limited to your flesh
[1:27:56] is no limit at your finances is not
[1:27:59] limited to the number but he is
[1:28:02] supernatural it means his was beyond the
[1:28:04] natural limitations
[1:28:05] and you can go beyond your natural
[1:28:07] capabilities and do the incredible the
[1:28:11] outstanding things that you can you
[1:28:12] cannot even imagine you do the things
[1:28:14] that is beyond your thinking is do the
[1:28:17] things that beyond how much you can
[1:28:19] imagine for you so let's take it with
[1:28:22] all our hearts and you put a lot to test
[1:28:24] the Lord I've heard about this prayer
[1:28:27] Jonah I want to try I want to try you to
[1:28:32] see your power just like Elijah when you
[1:28:34] got is the largest mantle he also tried
[1:28:37] a mantle that all that Elijah said is
[1:28:40] true yes should try God and God was to
[1:28:42] want to be put to the test so it's a lot
[1:28:45] if the where's the god of Elijah I've
[1:28:47] given all my life I've been your seven I
[1:28:50] had my family a hard land and farm you
[1:28:53] call me from my lands I left my horses
[1:28:56] and my cow and donkeys and whatever
[1:28:58] and I footed Elijah all these years I
[1:29:00] want to see that what I've got the
[1:29:02] mantle of Elijah is for real
[1:29:04] amen and there was a Jordan one of the
[1:29:06] rivers into the mantle and the river and
[1:29:11] the river open the Bible said that if
[1:29:13] the ether open here and there and it
[1:29:15] passed through so if you have got a
[1:29:17] little ideas for the sort of the
[1:29:18] kinnison's what about trad that you are
[1:29:21] going through take it to the Lord in
[1:29:23] prayer and straight a problem with
[1:29:26] phrase amen just like Elijah's try the

[1:29:51] issue this the Lord revealed to me when
[1:29:53] I was came to the message add a little
[1:29:54] bit of that but not to that degree I
[1:29:56] used to write ministers and people's
[1:29:57] names and pray for them sometimes when I
[1:30:00] had a church in Ghana I pray for
[1:30:02] people's issue when the Lord does it I
[1:30:04] told every part we thank a lot and threw
[1:30:07] it away I didn't know that I could keep
[1:30:09] it as a testimony but now God will
[1:30:11] always use somebody to bless you
[1:30:13] somebody that I just met in a way is
[1:30:16] been a turbo blessing for me
[1:30:17] amen is going to everywhere different
[1:30:20] please Mexico different places so let's
[1:30:22] start here with all our heart families

[1:30:27] for you don't worry if it is some people
[1:30:29] I get some I'm not a good mother Jack
[1:30:31] about you working outside but a jack

[1:30:46] they write your desires write what you
[1:30:49] need
[1:30:50] write what you think is hard for the

[1:31:01] from this angle he showed it you got so
[1:31:03] excited he forgot he asked three he was
[1:31:06] booing the loss and how many the USA
[1:31:08] three okay go ahead and show the result

[1:36:15] praise the Lord how we certainly thank
[1:36:20] God for this word it may you can be
[1:36:25] seated just for a moment brother quick
[1:36:30] who was sharing this with me and and I
[1:36:32] just felt it was quite important for us
[1:36:37] to come on this first Friday of the year
[1:36:41] and just kind of get the church in this
[1:36:44] in this particular channel when prayer
[1:36:47] is our key prayers are key and I know we
[1:36:52] have been I feel very successful with
[1:36:56] the concerted prayers where we've been
[1:36:59] coming together with us with the sisters
[1:37:01] and with or with the brothers you know
[1:37:05] that's that's something that in all
[1:37:07] honesty my wife is she she had the
[1:37:10] desire you know just to kind of get the
[1:37:12] sisters together and start praying and
[1:37:14] you know she came to me with it and you
[1:37:17] know and I okay well this let's do it
[1:37:18] this way and let's do it that way in and
[1:37:20] the sisters came I think this has been
[1:37:23] coming I don't know how many years doing
[1:37:26] the prayer I don't know how many years
[1:37:28] it's been a seven or eight roughly six
[1:37:32] or seven somewhere in there six or seven
[1:37:34] and the brothers I think picked it up
[1:37:36] about four years ago but we have been
[1:37:40] seeing God move ants the miraculous ways
[1:37:44] just through through prayer through
[1:37:47] prayer and and and I just believe that
[1:37:50] where the Lord is taking us now is not
[1:37:54] just to the group our concerted effort
[1:37:57] now is getting personal now it's getting
[1:38:01] personal right and if we would be honest
[1:38:04] with ourselves one of the biggest areas
[1:38:06] that we would all fight him is an area
[1:38:09] of Prayer right and you know recently I
[1:38:14] was you know just with some just in this
[1:38:17] little whatsapp group with some
[1:38:18] ministers and in
[1:38:19] different brothers would would put
[1:38:21] requesting pray over this and pray over
[1:38:24] that and pray over this and and I would
[1:38:26] see different brothers they would say
[1:38:28] they put the pray enhance or they're
[1:38:30] like you know brother I'll pray for you
[1:38:32] now I'll keep I'll remember that but
[1:38:34] when I respond I would say things like
[1:38:36] father in the name of Jesus touch my
[1:38:41] brother meet this situation now God in
[1:38:44] the name of Jesus and that's all I would
[1:38:46] do and you know I happen to look in the
[1:38:49] group just the other day and if somebody
[1:38:51] put a request out and I saw a lot of
[1:38:53] people saying father in the name of
[1:38:55] Jesus it just changed the whole dynamic
[1:39:00] right just just just one prayer can
[1:39:04] change the whole dynamic of things right
[1:39:07] and it's not not you know somebody
[1:39:09] saying pray for me and you you never get
[1:39:12] to it right yeah I mean yeah you and you
[1:39:15] had good intentions but you forget
[1:39:18] because our schedules are so busy that
[1:39:20] we you know we want to do right but but
[1:39:23] I think this is a way for us to really
[1:39:25] get a hold of all that we're gonna let
[1:39:28] nothing slip by you know that do you
[1:39:30] know when you forgetting that's the
[1:39:31] devil blocking you from praying for that
[1:39:33] person the saint you know that if you
[1:39:36] start praying do you know I mean the
[1:39:38] brother branham told us that when the
[1:39:40] weakest Christian you know what they get
[1:39:43] power yeah you know what you know what a
[1:39:47] weak Christian get power the weak
[1:39:50] Christian get power not just coming to
[1:39:52] church the weak Christian get power when
[1:39:55] they hit their knees I don't care how
[1:40:00] weak you are
[1:40:00] if you would just hit your knees like
[1:40:02] and can you imagine this is a man don't
[1:40:06] know nothing about the message he's just
[1:40:08] no prayer right he came up with this
[1:40:11] this idea he said Lord I want to be
[1:40:13] effective in my prayers
[1:40:14] and God showed them write it down and
[1:40:16] the scripture even tell his right
[1:40:18] division and after you make it plain and
[1:40:24] say he got run
[1:40:25] oh come on church he's gonna run after
[1:40:28] you read it right so so you know I tell
[1:40:31] you when I heard this I say this would
[1:40:33] be a perfect way for us as a church
[1:40:37] start this year would have with a prayer
[1:40:41] journal a prayer journal writing your
[1:40:45] prayers down on the left side and then
[1:40:49] on the right side just Thanksgiving and
[1:40:52] - and when God has done it you write the
[1:40:54] testimony as well on the right side and
[1:40:57] what this does is allows you to go back
[1:40:59] and see what God has already done for
[1:41:02] you and you just begin to just you know
[1:41:05] you know that if he's done it before
[1:41:07] he'll do it again now what we're doing
[1:41:10] actually is trying to get a number of
[1:41:16] these for the church we're gonna order a
[1:41:18] whole bunch of them for the church to
[1:41:21] give to everybody and we're gonna kind
[1:41:23] of specialize them for spirit and truth

[1:43:34] school there who yes sir
[1:43:53] brother branham said Jesus said in John
[1:43:55] I believe in 15th chapter he said I am
[1:44:00] the vine ye are the branches well now if
[1:44:03] that vine put forth the first branch and
[1:44:05] out of that branch wrote a book of Acts
[1:44:08] the second branch will make another book
[1:44:11] of Acts the third branch will make
[1:44:13] another book of Acts and every branch
[1:44:16] that comes out of the vine will be the
[1:44:19] same as the first branch was so if
[1:44:22] there's going to be another book of Acts
[1:44:24] written who's gonna write that's us we
[1:44:30] are the ones to write that next book of
[1:44:33] Acts I absolutely believe that brother
[1:44:47] quickly we appreciate you thank God for
[1:44:49] you just thank God for you getting
[1:44:50] yourself out of the way in and just come
[1:44:53] in and just sharing this and you know
[1:44:56] these testimonies that have been coming
[1:44:57] from South America have been very
[1:45:00] powerful and something stirred up
[1:45:03] amongst the people at Aaron and you know
[1:45:05] what I believe something gonna stir up
[1:45:07] right here and man amongst this group of
[1:45:10] people
[1:45:10] it don't take God much just a few
[1:45:14] dedicated folks that's willing to pray
[1:45:15] by something watch what God do and one
[1:45:20] of the things that there'll be a quote
[1:45:21] scripture as well as a quote that'd be
[1:45:23] on this but one of the quotes that come
[1:45:25] to my mind is when brother Branham said
[1:45:27] that prayer is the most powerful weapon
[1:45:29] that we have and not only that at prayer
[1:45:33] changed the mind of God my prayer and in
[1:45:39] Hezekiah state could change the mind of
[1:45:42] God then I say prayer can change
[1:45:44] anything anything prayer can change
[1:45:50] glory to God glory to God I'll tell you
[1:45:55] it wants to devil get you all frazzled
[1:45:57] and and all of that if you would just
[1:45:59] stop and just begin the pray you will
[1:46:02] see that not only you will change but
[1:46:04] that situation begins
[1:46:05] change hello James prayer is your key

[1:49:03] the song earlier draw us nearer draws
[1:49:05] nearer blessed Lord to the cross without
[1:49:08] inside God we trust that you'll do just
[1:49:11] that through this time that we'll go
[1:49:13] through this journey I pray Lord that

[1:49:19] love with you God would want to love you
[1:49:23] more than we ever had before Lord we

[1:49:33] working together for good to them that
[1:49:34] love God to them who are called
[1:49:36] according to his purpose so Lord let us
[1:49:37] not get frustrated but let us be
[1:49:40] grateful let us be thankful let us have
[1:49:42] the right mental attitude even we heard
[1:49:45] and another testimony to all the things
[1:49:47] happening there - brother Troy's car but
[1:49:49] he had cars but he had the right
[1:49:51] attitude in it and God within hours
[1:49:54] everything was was reversed everything

[1:49:59] fixed a problem that he didn't even go
[1:50:00] to get fix Lord that's the type of God
[1:50:03] you are that's the type of God you will

[1:50:25] there'll be things that you'll give to
[1:50:26] us even if we didn't ask for it
[1:50:28] hallelujah God because we're approaching
[1:50:31] it the right way
[1:50:33] Lord let us receive what you've spoken
[1:50:35] tonight and let it not be just words
[1:50:37] that are coming out of a man's mouth but
[1:50:39] lord may we hear the voice of God speak
