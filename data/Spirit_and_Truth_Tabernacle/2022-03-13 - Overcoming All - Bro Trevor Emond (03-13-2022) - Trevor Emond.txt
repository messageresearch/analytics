[Music] amen praise the lord this is actually a part of our devotion this morning it just comes across my heart i like to read it for you praise the lord that scripture says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need for spoil she would do him good and not even all the days of her life she seeketh wool and flex worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship she bringeth her food from afar she rises also while it's yet night and giveth meat to her household in a portion to her maidens she considered the field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planted the vineyard she girded her loins with strength and strengthened her arms she perceived perceive it that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she laith her hands to the spindle and her hands to the disk staff she stretches and stretches out her hand to the poirier she reaches forth her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for a household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land she maketh fine linen excellent and deliver the girls unto the merchant strengthen honor or her clothing that she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue it's a law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and edith not the bread of idleness her children arises up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellents them all favors deceitful in beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be

testimony in itself um i'm going to apologize in advance for the length of the testimony because it just has been continuously unfolding and unfolding [Music] um [Music] okay so a couple of weeks ago brother you know brother jack has been preaching on the um 2.0 and everything and uh on the other sunday about three four sundays ago um he was preaching on it and everything and um a lot of times when stuff be going on and song service be going on i just start to write stuff in my little book i never go back to read what i write but i just write it down as stuff start coming to me i just write it down um after service i have been going through a lot for the last month or two um and i don't like to be down or depress the internet the devil can't come with me with that because as i get down i start praising even more so that that you know that's not good for him to come with me but anyways um i have been going through a lot things just happening happening one behind another one behind another um and everything and i had this little song in my heart and i didn't know why i had a song in my heart before the stuff started coming but the song just never would go away and um my my family i have a line of family that they struggle with drugs and they've struggled with drugs all my life so one of my nieces passed away she was young and she passed away from drugs now her mom is my niece but she always says she's my sister because my mom raised her so she always says she's my sister and her mom who is my sister has struggled with drugs all my life so when my my i'm gonna say my niece my great niece passed uh her mom who we were like thickest thieves one you seen one you seen the other we grew up together you know it was always just the two of us but as time goes on as she begins to go out you know you know we just got our distances apart or whatever have you and uh um i whenever we see each other we act like we we saw each other yesterday you know and i never bring up what she does or you know i just show love to her and i'm just nail it to them and you know it's just we just back to valerie and nelly so um her daughter passes away and i had i hadn't talked to her or whatever have you and after church that sunday she called me and uh when she called me you know i say baby i don't i i don't have no words to give you um on how you're feeling i don't i can't even explain how you feel it and as i begin to talk to her you know i never preach to them i never you know tell them what they're doing is wrong or giving bible scripture none of that stuff i'm just nailing you know but god just started to just deal with me with her and i just started talking to him and as i'm talking to it and god just started sharing stuff and i just like him she said god wanted me to call you and as i'm talking to her i'm at and of course my phones don't work in my house so if i use the phone i got to go out the door and talk on the telephone so i'm out in my front yard and as i'm talking to her i'm not i'm shouting all over my front yard i know my neighbors that crazy whatever happened you know and i'm shouting all over my front yard and um i'm just up in that now i'm up in the rim and i it's hard to break that when you're up in that rim so as i get off the phone with him um i go and start laying down um and of course i'm still up to god still talking to me and it and i'm gonna preface that with a a couple of months a couple of months before that well it's been a while i i'm at on at the end of my retire i'm at the end where i'm i'm about to get ready to retire so with the state of florida you get your highest five so i always say i will i'm at my highest five i need to make more money for my retirement check be good and uh i wanted this job i've been on this job since i started however it just worked out that it didn't line up with um it didn't line up with the scriptures because um you had to wear pants so the first time i applied for the job um when i first started the sheriff's office 27 years ago um they said you had to wear pants i said well no i can't take the job but now we at the end of the career and i was like i want that job i never prayed about what i wanted i never you know say lord what your will is i just say lord this is what i want so you know i have a stuff i do i do i i know when i do i i have a stubborn spirit and i'll be stubborn and spoiled and you know and you know i'm i'm the baby so i'm just bored you know it is what it is uh and but you know god don't is only gonna take our character and um i said that to say i applied i told went into my box because you know used i'm preaching i'm ain't not talking to them and i'm listening to them they're counseling them and strangers that come into the station you know they'll start coming in there and i just end up talking to them about the lord and everything but um i went in and told my boss i said i want to be a csa so he said his first words to me was you know they got to wear pants right nelly i said i know that i consider all things but i want to be a csa so he said okay and he approved it it went all the way up to the undersheriff so everybody approved it right away and they even got me into the academy to be the underchair i'm to be to go to um be the csa but the week they had transferred me to this new department it was everything was signed sealed and delivered but god uh works all day long like you say he's in the beginning he's in the end he's in the middle he works at all he's working it all out so in all of that the week before i was supposed to go to the academy we had to go to this academy down south or whatever happens the week before it was supposed to be a group of us to go to this academy but because it wasn't the lowest will even though i just told him what i wanted and not what he wanted uh he shut the whole academy down for the whole entire sheriff's office so i said okay lord i was like okay lord they were like well nella you can go and you can be into it the next time i'm not upset about it i was like okay it is what it is but we're coming back to the testimony i'm going back in the house and i'm laying down and there's god continuously talking to me uh um while i'm up in this room he says you're not gonna be a csa he was like um i need you to be ready for this next level so i was like okay lord and then he was like have i not he said you've never had to worry about your finances in all your years you never had to worry about your life there's your water bill hot anything was gonna get paid how much more can i take care of you and your retirement so i said okay lord no problem i went in and the next morning i said well i can't be a csa my boss said well nelly can i ask you why you can't what made you change your mind i say well the lord said i can't do it he said well if the lord said you can't do it that's the end of that so so i i go and um that's the end of that and um thanks that they start having my daddy he gets sick and you know this is a very very very strong man and he's i mean you've never seen him down you never seen anything he goes and he gets sick and uh they say he had covet but then it turns out that he was back in with cancer and um i go down there to see him and i've never seen my dad in the bed flat is back they can't get up can't move i've never seen him in all my years any in that kind of position so um i'm like okay i need to get you know get you a bed so at least we can get you up and everything like that he was like okay nelly so i go it up um i try to find him this bed and i try to find him this bed and i can't find this bed calvin gets furniture and stuff all the time you get these little pants but he couldn't get a bed for him so the next week i was like dad i'm still looking for your bed but i can't um find this bed he was like oh no don't worry about that bed because um i'm up and i'm walking you know cause the song that was in my heart was this week will be a week for miracles so and i wasn't thinking about tonight's and i stopped and i was like god just working working things out you know just this week is a week for miracles and god can't do nothing with what we want to do he said that we was going to go in with our character and the things that we have on us that he can't use he's going to send these tests and these trials for us to get these characteristics up out of us because we are going to the next level and of course i you know me being stubborn you know like you said god has sent somebody even you know no nobody ain't gonna affect you like those that are closest to you are those that are in the church the people in the church and the people in your home affect you more than anybody else if joe schmo blow does something to you you don't care but if somebody in the church does it or somebody in your home does it it affects you more and uh and and you know what it is i say um i'm putting on a stubborn face again you know what i ain't giving my testimony and as i'm sitting here and uh and uh as brother jack preacher last week you know i was just going and i just i actually opened up the book that you know i've always taken my notes in i'm always right now with stuff coming in i just started reading the first couple of pages and in the first couple of pages it was just laying out every single thing that i had just went through and he was just saying that i'm gonna elevate you to the next level stop being hard-headed and get in the will of the lord go and testify to strengthen the faith of your brothers and sisters check your spirit when you come to church so that the holy spirit can flow freely so what i'm saying is stop thinking about yourself and get in line with the will of god because we're coming to a place in a time where we're going to be able to speak and everything that we speak we're going back to the first beginning everything that we speak is gonna happen just like adam in the beginning and you can't have any old kind of spirit when you have this power in you so we are like christ and then being like christ we have to have the character of christ and stubbornness and and hard-headedness is not the characteristic of christ so if he got a single test in the trials to get that spirit up off of you then he's gonna sit in that test and try to get that spirit up off of you cause you are coming to the next level [Applause] elevation comes with a price all right hey character is not a gift it's a victory you're going to go through some things in order to get character you can look for that if you want to be elevated you got to be proven first ain't nobody going to put you up if you can't take care down here amen god bless you sister nelly thank you for that testimony praise the lord sister michelle god bless you will you come this morning [Applause] [Music] thank you lord jesus hallelujah i think she changed my whole song around here thank you holiness

he's doing a really good job he's got the right heart and just trying to stay balanced himself and try to just lead on in the word of god and and not to get to the right not to get to the left not to get off in fanaticism not to camp out on any one doctrine or you know hey we've come we've come through it all church you you've been there too you know let's just hey god sent us a message and it don't make people crazy yes sir brother that's right it makes people believers it sets a reality of the word of god in this age and that's what we're following amen it's a restoration of the original word because it got lost in this day all right now i'm not going to preach on that but i could i'm so thankful so as as so many of you know um you've gone through your sunday school with the church age book curriculum um and and brother jack's faithful friend you know my the guy who pushed me to finish that and so um i had kind of plans to to preach something else but just on the way down just trying to get the mind of the lord as as we drove and um i i did lesson 71 the end lesson of the laodicean church age at our church just last sunday or the sunday before i don't know time moves by so fast you know um and to me it was a very moving lesson and i couldn't i could just couldn't get away from it and then speaking with brother jack last night he just mentioned the word he's just said the word understand you know and just man you talk about feeling like a load of bricks just fell into place with mortar and everything and a foundation was laid in like two seconds it was like okay lord this is what we're it's what we're talking about so i just want to go some of the slides that i have i i edited just a little bit from from how i i did the lesson there in in at home but um a few of them will probably end up skipping and i'll work with you sister tina but um you know we just want to talk about overcoming and i i told brother jack i said you know i was i was gonna do a non-church age lesson strange as that may sound because i started actually i was looking through photos and my wife and i when i first started writing that curriculum my wife and i took a trip and we we took a weekend away and uh you know she scrapbooked and cut out pictures and and i worked on church h book stuff and that was the first i think nine lessons i wrote that weekend and that was um i think eight years ago and it was just the other day eight years ago that i started and i realized like wow like i've probably preached maybe 10 sermons that haven't come out of the church age book in eight years and so um so this comes out of the church each book it comes out of the latest in church age and um like i almost joked to our to our church but i just you know that i was like we just finished our last lesson on the laodicean church age and we're in the laodicean church age i was like yeah probably doesn't mean anything but because remember we're not a bunch of crazy people like we're just serving the lord we don't have to try to you know make stars align and things like that you know so but it's good you know i could preach for the rest of my life out of the church age but the things that are in there how much scripture brother branham brings out into that and and the depth that he goes into so amazing so i just want to continue on that i'll start my timer here you know now that i'm done with all of that so so as we read here in um revelations chapter 3 that christ is christ is outside the church and we'll just start at this first phrase behold i stand at the door and knock and brother branham begins to say now there's great there's a great deal of confusion over this verse because so many personal workers use it in personal evangelism as though jesus were at the heart store of every sinner knocking for admission it would then be said that if the sinner opened the door the lord would come in but this verse is not talking to individual sinners the whole message has a summation as does every message and every age in verse 22 it says he that hath in the ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so this is a message to the church of the last age now this is where you know we kind of depart from just general christianity as he said most christians are just like oh yeah this is just you know salvation stuff and it's like no jesus is talking to church he's talking to the churches so so he's saying i stand at the door and knock i'm outside the church so he says this is the condition of the laodicean church as its end nears it's not a personal message to one person it is the spirit telling us where jesus is christ has left the church and so we can say well what how can we say christ is outside like what a bold statement and so my answer to that is is i'm not the bible is all right amen plainly reading that passage is just telling you christ is knocking saying hey open up i'd love to come in but i've been put out i'm not inside you think i'm inside the very the very thought of having church would say yeah i'm inside but no he's outside he's knocking trying to get in and then we could talk about well why why is he outside why isn't he inside that would be like the logical next question like why isn't he on the next side on the inside and brother branham says it's is this not the logical result of or end if the word is put aside right for creed the holy spirit deposed for popes bishops presidents counselors etc and the savior set aside for a works program or church joining or some type of conformity to a church system now now that last slide that talked about popes and all those things we're like yeah yeah yeah that's what them denominations do but church joining or conformity to a church system that maybe starts getting a little closer home maybe and we would all say no no no i'm not guilty of that and i would just say are you all right like like it's time to search our hearts and make our calling and elections sure and find out you know what have we been doing for 40 years in the wilderness kind of a thing yes sir to make sure that we're the joshua and caleb who are going to take a land and i'm not just wandering around following a prophet and the prophet's like well here's the jordan river would you like to cross it and we're like well i mean just you know i'll do what uh you know i'll do what the children of israel thing to do is like all the rest of the children of israel because that's you know that's what children of israel do is children of israel things what is that well it's yeah i mean you you know the thing you know come on like we follow a prophet what's that mean well you know come on i mean we go to spirit and truth you know like s.a.t who are you i'm an s.a.t believer good good what's that mean well that means we get together on sunday and we sing good music and well the jack preaches well i'm glad that you've joined the church i sure truly i'm glad that you're here that's wonderful it's good you should be here but that you're here means you're here that you're here means you've at least come to a place where you say okay god i want to come i want to be where you are i want to i want to hear the word of god preach to me i want to be encouraged and i want to come and i want to worship you together with saints because i believe it's important because it's what your word says to do and not that i'm here because well that's what s.a.t believers do that's what message believers do good for you that has nothing to do with it now if you're here for that reason i'm glad because i hope today we can we can get your we can get you a little farther and we can get you to wipe away those things because christ is on the outside knocking to the church saying why have i been put outside would you just open the door even now though you've rejected me and pushed me out oh but i'd love to come in what a merciful and gracious god so so so let's make sure that our church joining and our conformity to the you know message things isn't saying to our hearts you're all good because that has nothing to do with it all right all right so what more can be done against him this is the apostasy this is the falling away what hang on i thought it was yeah right i thought it was people leaving the message that that was the apostasy well what are they doing when they're leaving the message well they've left the word not not not like some people who who who who we say are leaving the message never really left anything because christ was still on the outside knocking saying hey i want to come in but no he wasn't there to begin with and that was a problem that was the problem the problem was is that people weren't actually getting to the word they were a part of a church system they were part of some conformity and they came to a spot where they were where they fought what is it that i'm in what is it that i'm doing and they actually maybe were honest with themselves to recognize they didn't have what this thing said they were supposed to have this is the apostasy this is the falling away that the church throughout the ages has rejected christ has put him on the outside has just said maybe you know what we're gonna do it this way you all do it this way we good good you're doing it this way amen good we're all going to kevin together all you had to do was walk through the doors on sunday morning okay dressed the right way too oh we could add a few more things and we do that you know in the message that's what the message is about right adding a few more things to regular christianity so that you know we can be better believers than all those other believers nothing to do with it that's right this is the apostasy this is the falling away is that is that people have pushed him out they haven't made it about him they've made it about them and when you make this thing whatever it is that you're doing about me about me getting to heaven and me overcoming in me this and me that where's christ in it all you've put him outside and you've taken a system just to make you something that you're not so that you can go somewhere that you don't be that you really just don't belong will glory this is the open door to antichrist for if one came in his father's name jesus and was not received but rejected then there will come another with his own name a liar a pretender and him they will receive john 4 john 5 43 the man of sin that son of perdition will take over see when you reject a real true servant of god well you're gonna just find somebody else say brother trevor no i'm i'm independent i'm on my own you know and just to show how independent i am you know what a lot of people do they dye their hair purple or blue because i'm different and then guess what they do they go hang out with other people with blue and purple hair thought you wanted to be different and then you just got together with all the other people that were just differently like you so you can follow somebody yes sir yes sir now he continues and says now we can see why there were two false vines one true one false we can see why abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted isaac and one after the promise now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of god and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect god did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect amen are we together yes yes we we we all sitting here going i mean i know when i read this i was like wait he reprobated for the sake of the elect okay first of all we got to talk about what reprobate means that you're gonna like that you're gonna be cast out that you're not a part of the thing because you're reprobated and it's so brother branham here is answering a question i actually didn't even know i needed to ask why does god reprobate that's what he's saying he this is why he reprobated he reprobated for the sake of the elect so god cast people out for the sake of the elect wow let's just let that sink for a little while let that just sit there and go okay wait god cast people out for his elect's sake that um okay i don't even know what to do with that yet and you begin to just think about that and you say well it seems like it's unfair but start to think about for a moment you know what sometimes how we're preaching and how we're you know trying to get people to come in is to say start doing it right and if you don't start doing it right god is going to cast you out and and he is going to burn you so do what is right because if you don't do what is right you're going to be reprobated and you're going to be burnt chaff and and when god puts the chaff there he's gonna light the fire and he's gonna laugh in judgment okay somebody just went full crazy sometimes that's them that's the way we we we bring it that's sometimes that's the way we think it and that actually has nothing to do with it and but yet sometimes we'd we'd say okay then what's the opposite of that the opposite of that is that god went and planted wheat and then an enemy came in and planted weeds and god said no let them grow together let them be blessed together amen but at the end what does he do first gather the wheat into the barn what it's about the wheat it's about the wheat it's about the ones that he elected it's about the ones that he planted everything else is just look an enemy put that in there we're just gonna cast it out because i'm not bringing weeds into the barn with the wheat i'm not going to contaminate my wheat with the weeds so god reprobates he gets rid of the weeds for the sake of the wheat so then it changes the the idea is has nothing to do with trying to escape judgment but it has everything to do with am i one of his cause we just sing it i am yours and you are mine oh yes sir that's what it's about am i one of his oh yes there's things that are right there's things that he likes there's things that are wrong there's things that he doesn't like and i want to be one of his and if i if i if i esteem him so highly then i'm going to walk in the things that he wants and then as i start doing that i start recognizing these my life is so much better having walked in his ways because my his truth endureth to all generations and when i walk in truth my life becomes better amen praise god but brother trevor there's a lot of trials christians have but your life is still better elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect these those reprobates are religious they're smart they're of the cane line the serpent seed they build their babels their cities their empires and all the wild calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the lord to destroy god's elect ones you'll be persecuted in the name of jesus that's exactly right exactly right i'm part of a soccer program trying to get out of it actually right now but um you know whenever there's a disagreement between you know this these people don't like the coach these people do like the coach guess what they tell me trevor you got to get rid of that coach he's just not christian enough he's just not a good guy like we can't have him in front of our children get rid of him it's the christian thing to do and to to get rid of the guy yeah because it's about the kids you know everybody look you got a guy that you think isn't you know isn't a good character guy in front of your children you want a different coach you want to coach with good character for your children so it's a christian thing to do in a christian homeschool program to get rid of the guy in leadership position if his character isn't good enough and then everyone who likes that coach tells me how dare you get rid of somebody like that that's not christian it's like a guess i'm not a christian there's no way for me to continue to be a christian that's just a small little deal you understand real people are going to be religious they're going to try to use religion to their own ends same as the reprobates they'll use religion to their own ends they'll balk at the the that that you would say that maybe you don't have it how dare you say such a thing how dare you tell them christ is actually outside of their own church but let's find out if he is or not all right all right you say well of course they're not message churches he must not be on the inside maybe it's time we update our thinking but they are needed what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire unquenchable and what is and the wheat where is it it's gathered in his garden garner it is where he is is that a changing place for the wheat if you're wheat and you're gathered and you're with you're where he is is that a changing place everybody's like i didn't answer that question it's a trick question i know it's a trick question he's like well i mean yeah now we're in the barn we were in the field but you know we're already seated in heavenly places with christ jesus you should be where he is right now there's a time he's going to come and he's going to harvest the wheat but that's not a change in spiritual place you're already where he is now what are you waiting for church are you waiting for a rapture yeah well of course i'm waiting for a rapture and brother trevor it's like well you know i wanna yeah yes we wanna wait for a rapture because we wanna be with jesus but we should be with him now how many want revival did you pray about revival this morning yes did you prepare your heart for revival this morning well we knew brother trevor was gonna just break it so i'm sorry maybe you had me confused with another preacher i don't know but some of us do that right i'm gonna wait you know for the the right circumstances in the right meeting and you know so i i did a little um bible study with the young people i was just like okay you know when's the last time you felt revived and they began to talk about the different meetings maybe they had been some of them you know said you know wednesday night actually it was just this last service i felt i felt revived i was like well praise god wasn't expecting that what did another sister said well actually that last service that you preached i said well praise god i should have expected that one some of them talked about different camp meetings that they were at and i saw okay so if we want revival the last time you got revived was it one of these meetings like this what is it that brings revival and so i got the whiteboard out and we started putting all kinds of stupid answers on the whiteboard and you know like well we're gonna have to you know we should rent an auditorium we should bring a bring you know a preacher in and then we'll all get together we'll all have a great time and we'll have revival it's like that's what brings revival as an auditorium and a preacher come on somebody or is it because something in me said god i need more of you and i'm not content to wait on the pastor to to spend the money and to do the thing but god you're here i should be where you are and where you are is where revival is and god i don't have to wait for that and i'm tired of waiting for that we sit in church sometimes just waiting for the thing to happen with no preparation of ourselves as if we expect god's just gonna you know god i'm i'm so miserable and so lost you're just gonna have to deliver me and praise god when he does that but should we wait on that should we camp out on that should we always just sit there and service feeling like god i can't do anything there's nothing i i'm just you're gonna have to just just pull me up again lord and we're waiting on god to just you know pump up the super soaker of holy ghost juice and you know start spraying in the service because there's no other way come on somebody let's go to him the wheat is where he is the wheat is where he is we can be where he is he's paved the way the cross made a way for us to be back in fellowship with him again so let's do it let's overcome let's let's take the overcomer's throne because that's what the scripture's telling us now is he's talking about christ being outside the church he doesn't have to be outside the church he can be in the church right now you can have a revival right now glory to god he can be with you now so to him since he can be with you now to him that overcometh all of these things to him that overcometh i will grant to sit with me in my throne even as i overcame so let's talk about overcoming now now now what we are to not what we are we overcome but how we overcome matters now now now i'm just going to be honest i had a real problem with this one brother trevor's intellect clashed with the prophet in a in a in a big way because like brother branham like okay that's nice but like we we need to know what it is we are to overcome you know there's a wall okay i have to overcome a wall what am i gonna need well i'm gonna need something to get me how i overcome is dictated by what is in front of me to overcome well i either need to be able to strong enough to jump six feet to grab a wall and then be strong enough to pull myself up and over it or i need another brother you know who can lift me up or something like that like how over is being well how to overcome is being dictated by what it is to overcome come on brother branham like what we need and then if i know what is overcoming then when i overcome it i can look back and go i was on that side now i'm on this side i overcame and it's so obvious and brother branham you're saying like it doesn't matter what you're supposed to overcome it's just how like stop no no okay so let's read and let's let him explain now jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word now and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you were overcoming because that word can't fail so then when we start thinking like oh wait wait how we are to overcome is the same way that jesus christ overcame in the desert how we are to overcome is using the word so if we're gonna use the word to overcome then the thing in front of us the what doesn't matter anymore you're going to go to you're going to have battles it's like okay um how do you overcome the romans with their shields and sort short swords it's like you could approach the battle and go okay well you know in history you know a greek phalanx could do that because they had longer spears and different things and you could you know you could then begin to manipulate the things that overcome this thing overcomes that thing and that you know rock beats scissors and paper beats rock and you know all of those things yes now we've reduced the word down to rock paper scissors i don't know if we can have brother trevor back again the problem is the word is a nuclear bomb like you how do you how are you going to overcome the romans well we got to figure out how to overcome the romans well we have a nuclear bomb okay never mind that's over like how are we going to how are we going to overcome the greeks well we have a nuclear bomb okay i guess that's this is the word it is the most powerful thing i don't care what's in the way i don't care what needs to be overcome the word does it the word does it now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion while he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spoke only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god and let's just underline this little bit right here it was the wisdom of god you see jesus comes and he uses the word and jesus comes and let's say like matthew 5 six seven you know like like they're confused he's just giving the sermon on the mount and they're like wait how's this guy he's got such authority he's preaching so differently and and you know you you've heard it's been said you know he that you know he that kills his brother you know and he that all this but no no no if you're angry with your brother without a cause see jesus goes so much deeper with the word his wisdom of the word got to a deeper level than all of those other people his his his wisdom of god with the written pages went to a deeper level than all those around him the wisdom of god in his heart the revelation of god taking the written pages that he had and he understood it and knew it at a deeper level than all those around him are we together should i repeat that again because i'm i'm emphasizing something for a reason so let's hang on for just a moment and let's look at this now so so we need to overcome all that is in the world so first john 2 16 for all that is in the world oh john goodness you just you're giving us everything here now what all is in the world now we're gonna itemize the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but of the world so so now okay we got three things that we can break down overcoming all that is in the world into three buckets in our lives we got we got lust of the flesh we got lust of the eyes we got pride of life so now then then then wouldn't it be nice wouldn't it be nice if we saw like see jesus was our example right and wouldn't it be nice if we saw jesus overcoming each one of these things and if we could see how he overcame it then we could figure out how to overcome it in our lives too man that'd be amazing so turn to matthew chapter four there you go so matthew chapter four and verse one and i don't have slides for this one well i do but we're gonna wait on those for a second i don't have slides for the whole thing but i want to read this this little bit here probably 1 through 11 or something jesus was led up into the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted to the devil when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afr afterward and hungered 40 days and 40 nights after that he was hungry [Music] hen's lunch when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and he saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charged concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus said it's written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and show with him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me jesus sayeth unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him now now this is just message 101 right here we know we defeat the devil by the word because we're message believers you know we place the high priority on the word it's the word the word the word the word and maybe you know you were 14 or 15 and you're like yeah i know it's the word but it's like you know like you preachers you're always like the word so amazing and i'm like okay i know that's right i know that's right but i don't i know i should feel that way but where is it in my life like how like what's the you know and so many of us our answer is is to just well become like them and just start saying yeah but the word you know you got to say it deeper and lengthen it out and because it sounds more spiritual that way and then you can be a better message believer because now you're saying it the way everyone else says it that apparently seems to have it all together that's it that's it so so thank god for the word all right god bless you you're dismissed like we just had cert like hey no give me something give me something i know that i'm supposed to defeat the devil with the word brother trevor tell me something i don't already know because sometimes brother trevor i'm tempted and i'm tempted hard i deal with things and i don't even want to tell anybody but i'm tempted and you want to tell me like like i'm sitting there being tempted with pornography and and i'm supposed to use the scripture that says flee youthful lusts like okay devil it's written flee youthful lusts ha got him i i don't somebody just said doesn't work like but sister it's the word help us jesus because why did it work for jesus well he was jesus it works for him obviously doesn't work for a loser like me apparently i need to just get better do better be more you know you know and get the i don't even know what i'm saying i just gotta write resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's easy yeah sure brother trevor craig that's resist the devil and healthy you just gotta think what is resistant devil i'm resisting you how how am i resisting the devil i'm waiting for a power outage that's how i'm resisting the devil [Music] so if we have the word and the word is the atomic bomb that can destroy any enemy any devil any thing that must be overcome can be overcome by the word with which we have and and oh where is it oh it's in my bible case i should have a message book with me you know which we have holding up a message book too like we've got these things spot me spot me which we have and yet we're told this defeats the devil and then our experience doesn't match what we're told and then i go so i have two options try to act like everything's okay and i'll just do it better next time or or or i'll just act more spiritual and everything's good because i certainly couldn't tell anyone else that anything's wrong because i got the word and they got the word and if something's wrong it can't be the word so it must be me but i don't know what to do i don't know how to defeat it because i have done what i told and i i said the thing take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow when temptations round you gather breathe that holy name in prayer oh jesus lord jesus christ still tempted now now this is not to say that you should never actually physically try to resist that you shouldn't actually try to you know build up right the correct kind of boundaries and barriers and you know that you should try to have you know your own little bit of legalism until you don't need it any longer like this is not to say any of those things i'm not saying that you shouldn't try to resist the devil of your own life i'm not saying that you shouldn't you know move the computer into the living room do the whatever needs to be done in your life you make good decisions you make right decisions and you just don't wait for the for god to just you know light you up with fire and just take it all away sometimes he will and sometimes he won't so praise god for his mercy when he does and god help me for those times that you're just teaching me to grow and to strengthen my life and to teach me the power of the word of god in my life because the word of god is powerful but we've been trying to intellectually duel with the devil for far too long we've been trying to say well i've got the word and that's good enough and as long as i know it up here and i can say okay the devil's trying to do this so i'm to take the word and i'm going to say this to him and i'm going to have this intellectual duel and at some point in time i'm going to get better at it than the devil i mean probably not so so brother trevor are you actually gonna tell us what to do now that you've just totally broke it all down and given us absolutely no hope we'll do it like jesus i was like isn't that what we were doing apparently not apparently not so how is jesus doing it now so let's go let's look at this let's look at matthew 4 3 the tempter came to him and said if thou be the son of god commanded these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god if you would turn with me to deuteronomy i don't have deuteronomy on this slide so you're going to have to use your bible and turn there bible.is if you don't have the physical paper copy you can use that that's fine i i'm okay with that so we're gonna make a point here so so deuteronomy 8 3 and he humbled thee suffered thee the hunger fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live this is what jesus is quoting deuteronomy chapter eight verse three when's the last time you got in a battle with the devil and you decided you know what i'm gonna go to deuteronomy not psalms not the new testament i'm going to deuteronomy that's all jesus did how does jesus just get to pull why does jesus know deuteronomy 8 3 i i why does he have that memorized i don't know because i didn't but why does he go to deuteronomy 8 3 man shall not live by bread alone the man's been in the wilderness for 40 days 40 nights he's hungry any any any any one of us are thinking like man if i have power after 40 days to turn a rock into bread it's like rock your bread like it's just i'm just doing it i'm hungry and jesus says no no man shall not live by bread alone so wait a second like why is jesus going there though is it just because well he's tempting me with food find okay rolodex of scriptures about food bing found one deuteronomy 8 3 use the use the anti-food temptation scripture against the devil because that's what we look i'll say just that's what i do when i started studying this this challenged me deeper in my walk to be deeper with god than than any sermon to date that i've studied because i recognize that's what i do i'm looking through the rolodex to find the thing that cancels that thing but it's deeper than that for jesus you see jesus the devil's trying to tempt him jesus yes he's hungry he can be tempted by that but jesus is jesus recognizes what the devil's trying to do the devil is trying to get him to stop looking and to stop realizing that the word of god is sufficient you say okay that's great trevor we know that but no we we need to take that and let the wisdom of god that jesus had that confused everyone else and we need that wisdom we need that revelation of what the scriptures are saying to us because when jesus said man shall not live by every word what he's doing is he's taking the devil back into some history and saying you know what there was a time in history when god's children were hungry but they were following a pillar of fire and as they followed the pillar of fire as they got hungry their hunger didn't matter because they were with the pillar of fire and when they needed food the manna fell so i could be tempted to just throw everything away when i get hungry but i gotta recognize that if i stayed with the word if i stayed with god and i truly believed him the hunger is going to be taken care of because i've got the thing that's more important and so jesus is taking the devil back to absolute history to absolute fact and not only is jesus taking him there he's showing the devil not only do i know that this happened in the past but i've come to a place where i've believed this so thoroughly where i've understood the word to such a place where it's become so real to me that my experience with the word tells me that you could try to tempt me with bread when i'm really hungry and try to get me to throw away the word of god for a morsel of bread but i know that god's word will provide in its own like it's temptation because the devil's tempting him but in another sense it's not temptation the devil has nothing on the revelation that the man jesus christ had in his heart amen how do you defeat the devil with the word but that kind of word with the wisdom of god coupled with the written page down in the inside becoming a reality you say how do you do that brother trevor oh you're gonna spend time in prayer you're gonna spend time in meditation you're going to spend time reading you're not just going to spend time wandering around and just merely following just coming to church and doing the motions it's more than the motions church you're not here this morning for the motions you're here this morning to hear from almighty god that he might quicken his word into your heart that it would strengthen you and make you more than you ever thought you could be and that's what this word is that's what this message is the power to overcome the power to realize that if i needed food and jesus goes and he's going to prove this later 5 000 people come to hear me preach and they don't have food hey disciples take that boy's lunch no it's okay you're not really he'll get his lunch don't worry grab that boy's lunch and start handing it out to the people why because the word meant more than the bread amen it wasn't bandying scriptures intellectually it wasn't hot devil i got you you're trying to tempt me and i know that man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word take that bam what you got i'm a message believer i've been in church for 40 years now i know it get over it get in it let's realize what this is that this is this gospel is the power of god to salvation this word is powerful and if it's not powerful in your life let's get in it and say god i need the revelation of it i want the word like jesus had it i want it real see there's a big difference there there's something greater than bread so the lust of the eye matthew 4 6 if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time that dash they put against the stone you say well how is this the lust of the eye well what's he saying here he's saying if thou be the son of god just just do this like the word is for you you can just do what you need to do with the word right hasn't aren't you a believer aren't you bride well just just do this jesus saith unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god you see it comes to a point where we recognize the word is primary not what i want done with the word is primary was that a mouthful was that a statement right there let's just let's just let that the word is primary not what i want done with the word well what do you want done with the word well you could just do this you know prove god you need you know you need 10 000 bitcoin in your wallet you just prove god put 10 10 000 bitcoins in your bitcoin wallet here everybody hold up your bitcoin wallet and say i'm just trying to update it to 2022 i don't know um i left my wallet actually in the office so it's in the pocket there brother stay out of it like we've heard that kind of preaching we've seen that kind of preaching oh just prove god intent that's the tempting of god because now jesus is taking the devil back and he's saying thou shalt not tempt the lord by god and it's like okay that's that's nice that's easy but what is he saying he's taking him back to deuteronomy six so now again jesus using deuteronomy to defeat the devil you didn't know you defeat the devil with deuteronomy but you do so deuteronomy chapter 6 you should still be close to that maybe deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 16 you shall not tempt the lord your god as he tempted him in masa so jesus is saying ha see i got you i i've got a verse for that no he's not saying that what is this scripture talking about this scripture is going back to i think it's a exodus 17 where they have no water but this is the second time the israelites have no water the first time they come to to the waters of mara the waters are bitter they're thirsty they can't drink the water moses what do we do we throw a tree in the water that's what we do we just add calvary to the situation makes everything good they have water then they come now to a next the next point to this maza or meribah and and and and and well well moses we don't have water again is god with us or not and so jesus just say remember devil remember when the children of israel were in the wilderness and they wandered around and they tempted god and said god are you with us or not and god showed them over and over and over again that he was with them i don't have to worry i don't have to i don't have to prove that god is with me i don't have to trip over a rock i don't have to throw myself over a cliff i don't have to put ten to proclaim ten thousand bitcoin into my bitcoin wallet and wait for that to happen to show me that jesus is with me it's not about what i want done with the word it's not it's not about any of those things it's about he said so he's proved it over and over again and jesus could look back in history and again it's not just a history lesson that he has no experience with but it's something that he realizes is absolutely truth not just knowing it truth but having an experience and a revelation something that binds in his heart so deeply that says devil i cannot be moved you don't have to you i don't have to go through circumstances to show me that god is with me i know he's with me i feel him it's real and it's not just you know that i'm saying the words because we say these words sometimes and we don't know it but there's a time that it's truth that it comes there and it says i know that god is with me i know that he's real and he'd never leave me that he'd never forsake me so i don't have to tempt him devil i already know i already know i don't have to battle with him with the word in my mind because the word is in my heart the revelation's so deep the devil doesn't have it coming this is what it means to overcome by the word to let the word become real not to just know the history not to just know the words not just to be able to quote the words but to recognize the truth of all ages coming down and resonating and becoming a platform of stability for you to stand on that you know i'm standing here and i shall not be moved hallelujah so then we see we come to the pride of life the devil take him up to an exceeding high mountain show with him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto them all these things will i give thee if thou fall down and worship me so jesus is tempted with power and authority over all things without going through trials without going through character building things you don't want a leader that goes through that becomes powerful without going through trials because he'll have no character so jesus is tempted with this and again he takes the devil to deuteronomy chapter 6. verses 13 to 14 thou shalt fear the lord thy god serve him shalt swear by his name you shall not go after other gods the gods of the people which are round about you for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee to destroy thee from off the face of the earth so jesus says it's written satan get thee hence for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve jesus is taking the devil back in history again and he's saying you know what we had this law satan and it wasn't just a law though like it was a law satan but but it wasn't just a law like it was obvious wasn't it like when the children of israel come to mount sinai and they go off into into worshiping a golden calf already like okay like what were they thinking because the last gods that they had encountered were the gods of the egyptians did you know that the egyptians even had a frog god and it was it was unlawful for egyptians to kill a frog that's a problem i just love what god does there just like oh you have this god here you go have some frogs you can't kill what you gonna do when almighty god the only god the only true god comes and thrashes your intellectual conception that you've made from you've twisted some some truth over and over and over again so you got to a place where you have a god that's a frog that you worship but jesus is god's gonna come in and he's gonna send so many frogs amongst you that you will hate the very sight of frogs and wish like anything that you weren't bound by this ridiculous rule that you can't kill the thousand frogs that are in your home they had they had things the priests would would sprinkle dusts and ceremonies so so god tells moses hey grab the dust do like their priests sprinkle it around and it's going to be lice there's going to be flies there's going to be every single thing the egyptians worshipped at one time god come walking right through and said nope not a god nope not a god nope not a god that's three nope not a god that's for nope not a god that's five nope not a god that's six that one nope not a god that's seven nope not a god nope not a god no not a god man this this law in exodus chapter 20 like thou shalt have no other gods before me is that a law or is that just obvious well it was obvious to jesus because jesus knew devil i'm not just throwing a scripture at you but i'm throwing at you the understanding the revelation in my heart of the truth of the matter that thou shalt have no other gods before him that you should worship no other god because well guess what there isn't any other god but him and i'm not gonna set anything up to that that might be worshiped because if i worship something else other than god i know god at some point is gonna come walking right through that thing and say nope not a god so devil why would i worship you to achieve some good end when all that's gonna happen is god will take the rebelliousness of my heart and destroy me why because he is the only god and him only shall thou serve and the reality of that situation had come so deep inside of christ that this temptation from the devil again not just a scriptural i know the word and i'm flinging it at you devil no it's more than that it's a reality it's a truth amen church this is how we should have the word of god this is how we're going to overcome all the wor world is not just by understanding not just by reading and having it in our heads and look we we recite the word we teach it in sunday school memorize the word these are wonderful things these are the starting points they're not the ending points the starting points to the end that the spirit which catches the word brings that thing down into your heart to your spirit and that's the thing that's got life in it it becomes real to you and i challenge you church if the word hasn't become real to you yet let's go there's more for you why would we wander farther and do church things and do message things and all of this culture that we've created and we like it and it's wonderful and it's just how we do life but that isn't the point the point is the word of god that he sent us in this last day re restoring all things to where we're not worshiping any other god we're not tempting god and saying god are you even with us we're not what's the other one that i've missed you know we're not we're not we're not tempting him we're not okay let me go through my slides and we're not taking our eyes off of him and we're not looking for any we don't need anything else but him let's let that become real amen okay i'm a little over time we're gonna go over a couple more slides now notice how jesus overcame the world systems of religion he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god but let's go back let's go back one slide he constantly applied the word because he knew the truth of the word he constantly applied the word every situation in his life he applied the word to it every question in his life he applied the word to it every time he was at a crossroads he applied the word to it he constantly applied the word apply the word in your life let it become real let it become reality don't just don't just dwell look the church systems pushed him out when they made a system of religion when they when they made it not about him and made it about the stuff stop making it about religious messaging stuff apply the word in your life it's not stuff it's the word it's real it's living it's alive it's active it's it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart go ahead and let the word discern the thoughts and intents of your heart oh it doesn't have to be a prophet standing up on a platform going i see this in your life and i see this in your life and that's how we use that scripture and amen that's how that scripture was applied but not only that but the word of god can come on the inside of your heart and as you dwell on it in some time in prayer and some time in meditation the word of god can cut and divide asunder the thoughts and intents of your own heart and make those things real to you where you could go oh god that one was a little rough there lord like i want this though and he's like yeah i know and i just showed you you want that and it's not my will hallelujah oh hebrews 4 12 an action not just a memory verse but a reality verse i said it wasn't just a memory verse but it's a reality verse it's time we take memory verses and take them to reality verses let the word discern your heart and when and constantly apply it over and over and over and over and over and over till you realize what am i applying the word to the word like i've become it so much i'm applying so much it's becoming so real and and and there are you know we we i mentioned this in our church you know we've had a family that's god has just just just changed their lives and it's just it's more than one family really and it's just but you see there's lives and and i was preaching i was like you know there's there's people it's like you look back two years in your life you look back three years in your life and you go oh i can't believe that i was doing that i can't believe that that was even a thing in my life it's like god has changed me so much that's what we're talking about like you don't even have the desire for that anymore because of the word there's things that you're dealing with and that you're battling there's temptations in your life that you're d you know that are that are tough but think back on that that the last thing that god delivered you from and how you're like man that was ridiculous how did i even battle that in my life guess what it can happen again because that's how jesus defeated the devil every time was through the word but not through mental but through coming to places where the word became so real those things were he's looking at that going was that ever even an issue in my life how could it have been an issue it's so ridiculous to even think about because now i get it there's no value in that thing anymore because there's value here and i see it now and i'm not just trying to become something i'm not but literally the word of god is being quickened in my heart this is christianity church this is the message of the hour to become power in your life to overcome everything if you let it if you'll let it calm if you let it do the work stop just trying to go okay yeah we do the thing we do the thing i'm a believer i'm a believer i bet there's been i have carried a message book and had a message patch on my on my arm and told talked about this for every single sermon i've ever preached at this church probably most of them this is not a message believer someone who walks around with a message book and can well because you know what that is you see jesus was repeatedly badgered by theologians of his day there was a lot of theological badgers there was a lot of yeah next slide next slide there was a lot of theological badgers their little spectacles their little stripe tie their little message book under the arm you know brother you know what it says see i've been seeing your life and you know the message says let's go brother you see what it says right here overcome the devil with the word i don't want to say not a believer but certainly not a good one all right there's so much more yeah it's so much more deep so much more moving so much more filling god help us i wish i could just um what i feel in my heart about this i've been there i've been that guy i knew i was that guy and i didn't just it's not that just saying look brother this look please brother god's word says this let it become a reality that's not being a theological badger i'm i'm i'm trying to help him i'm trying to pull him up i'm not just trying to beat him over the head with the word and take out my word sword and man because my doctrine's better who cares we're in the end time church he's come in church he's coming and there's so much for us that we leave on the table for whatever reason it is i don't know but god help us to stop letting that be our the sum total of our message experience and that's why i have a stupid picture up there so you'll never forget it don't be that amen not when there's a reality jesus constantly applied the word he takes the book of deuteronomy and he applies the word the book of deuteronomy like we struggle to read the book of deuteronomy jesus supplies the book of deuteronomy where are we at like this this as i studied this sermon i said god make my study and my my just plain reading of the word so much deeper may i not just look and read the words may i not just understand the history but god may the revelation of what's going on of what you're actually saying may i be like gee may i become like jesus on the mount preaching saying it's not just eye for an eye tooth for a tooth it's not just you know don't don't don't commit adultery but don't even lust don't even look at it my desire for you is so much deeper god help me to get into the depth of the word to understand it have the revelation of the word church we ought to like this should illustrate what the prophet told us we ought to pray for revelation more than anything else not understanding revelation jesus didn't just oh where's my notes because i want to go through this thing he constantly applied the word the musicians can come i'm going to try to end right here he doesn't just debate the word he doesn't just talk about the word he doesn't just wander around the word he doesn't just hang out with other people who do the same things as he does whatever it could be said that we do with the word it wasn't what jesus was doing he was constantly applying the word constantly applying the word why because he knew the word was real he wasn't just applying the words he was applying the word the truth the thought the revelation of it that was there before the foundation of the world before anything was in being the word was was there and was truth and was power and when the word spoken said let there be light there was so let the word speak in your life because it's trying to the word of god is trying to push itself into your life the word of god is trying to come into your heart and it's trying to say let there be light constantly pushing constantly pushing and some of us run from it and some of us try to you know we try to do all kinds of things and we we we want to be part of it we want to i want to do this for you god i want to do this when god's just saying i'm trying to let light come in i want the word to be real quit with the stuff it's too late it's too late to do the stuff it's too late to think the stuff does anything for you it's time to let the reality of this word come and sink down into your heart like joshua and caleb that they knew that when moses said we go take a promised land that wasn't just stuff we talked about but it was stuff that they were going to say this is a reality in my life get out of the way and give me my mountain because let there be light had been spoken in their hearts because you have a promise you can have had been spoken in their hearts because they began to get out of the way they had seen others who were trying to say well i'm a levite well i'm a i'm a this and i'm a that and i'm a i'm a child of israel well i'm a message believer but has let there be light impacted your soul has the word become to be alive and active and real inside of you because that's what it's about church and i myself when i read this bible from here on out and i still fail i still struggle myself i still do all kinds of stupidness but god as i read this word may continue to become more alive to me may it not be words on a page but it may it be reality so what is it that you're standing on is it the word of god or is it your culture of the word because jesus christ is standing on the outside of the culture of the word trying to get in jesus christ is on the outside of people that have just decided i'm an s.a.t member and he's trying to get in not just trying pressing his way pushing his way ignore it no longer church he is knocking knocking can i come in let me in let the word come in and change your life forever let it be reality let us pray heavenly father lord our hearts are full and struck by this lord jesus may we look and be real honest with ourselves lord may your word come in the inside lord and begin to discern our thoughts in the intents of our hearts discern whether or not we've lord [Music] whether we've pushed you outside through our creeds and traditions and our dogmas and our god may we never be guilty of such a thing ever again may we open this morning the doors of our hearts fling them wide open and invite you to come in father over and over again lord say yes come be with us not just you know lord just the thought of it but lord let the reality of the word come on the inside who you are you're you're very qualities lord your very characters lord may as we read the word we understand your character

i just pray lord that you just go to every heart and speak to them wherever they're at lord i don't even know and i wouldn't presume to speak where anyone would be lord but lord would your spirit lord not me but but hebrews 4 12 discern the thoughts of people's hearts lord and reveal it to them show them lord where they need you and what they might change what they might repent of what they might run from father and how the word can strengthen their lives and be that atomic bomb destroys every enemy destroys every devil may we dwell in it lord we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ

hallelujah [Music] praise the lord i certainly appreciate the word from the lord today through brother trevor early this morning i had to teach on the uh eight o'clock call that i do and my my topic was on overcoming and using the scripture revelation 12 i believe 11 it says that they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and you know just uh my encouragement has been that is a past tense scripture and a future tense scripture and i'm here to tell you that whatever you're going through the word has already been spoken over you that they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of the testimony so you are going to be victorious no matter what you face them you're going to be victorious and that brother trevor was telling us it's not just a mental conception of the word of god but it's a genuine revelation in your heart that the word works and ain't nothing else gonna work but the words bless it be the name of the lord so we appreciate that amen on today god bless you brother trevor my god oh my god amen amen so uh i got a couple things that i need to do right now there's a prayer request that i need to take before the lord um brother troy was telling me that um sister candace just sent a text she's not feeling well she's in pain and she's on her way to the hospital so we want to pray that god will go before her that god would just meet her and that he would touch her and bring her out of this situation so let's just bow our hands if we would lord jesus we come before your presence realizing that we are sons and daughters of god and lord we stand in the gap for our precious sister candace lord uh here the enemy is attacking her body we don't know what it is but we know what what we do know is that it's a lion vanity and satan we command you to loose and let go take your hands off of sister candace god you told us that what we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loose in heaven so we lose the angels of godfather and bring healing to her body even right now god that the the the doctors would not find anything wrong with the lord does she be completely made whole you told us in your word that you were wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes we are declaring healing over her body so father we speak we send the word right now to right where she is and may she be made completely whole raise her up for your glory god raise her up for your glory we commit a father to your your capable hands i want to thank you for this service today and all that you've done we just appreciate father from the first note that was played to amen the last word spoke and we just we just appreciate being in the presence of god thank you for the saints that have come lord to enjoy this thank you for your servant that has yielded himself oh god that he could speak to the hearts of the people may we leave here with revelation our heart that we got to draw closer to you god if we want to overcome the enemy in itself and we trust lord jesus that you would give us a man revelation understanding and power father to overcome everything satan puts in our path we pray your blessings upon the saints lord say prepare to leave this place but not your presence we want to take time also lord to pray especially for uh brother aaron and sister rebecca god uh today being our her last service with us god we thank you for all that she has done all that she has given to us lord just
