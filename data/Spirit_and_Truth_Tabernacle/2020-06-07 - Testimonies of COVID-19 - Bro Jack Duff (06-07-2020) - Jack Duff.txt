give to you it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen also quickly I wanted to just give you an update on our building fund we do this Amen at the first Sunday of every month we are in a process of trying to raise funds for our new church into school we're not just saying that but we're putting my money where our mouth is and we had a goal for this year of reason 105 thousand dollars and we received pledges towards that goal of sixty thousand nine dollars say man and so far on those pledges the money that has been received as of today is fifteen thousand one hundred forty five dollars and nine cent amen we thank God for that fifteen thousand one hundred forty-five dollars at 9:00 a.m. and just last month alone a man we receive two thousand three hundred seventy-five dollars so also we've gained interest on the money the fans just cut the race with this covet 19 hit and we haven't been gaining much interest but nonetheless we got some interest and it's 271 dollars and 27 and I gives us a total net of fifteen thousand four hundred sixteen dollars and twenty nine cent that has been accumulated this year and our building firm we have not had to use that for any other expenses and we just thank God for that amen we really really thank God for that so thank you so much for your giving and anyone that would like to join us in our project we certainly will appreciate that amen the Lord bless you thank you brother Troy you can turn the lights on there musicians thank you amen we just appreciate the Lord we had a wonderful time this morning a man in the service of the Lord and just kind of was on my heart to kind of take these two services today just some things that are just from a pastoral standpoint I think I needed to share and and then I wanted to come back here for this service and and just go a little different direction but I pray to be a blessing a man to us on today I want to read a scripture that was given to us a man during this season and I am grateful for this scripture that was sent to us and and I believe it's very appropriate for the time this is the book of jeremiah chapter 17 verse 7 through 10 day men the Book of Jeremiah 17 verse 7 through 10 the Bible reads blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is a man are confident is in Christ's a man we can't trust nothing else but Jesus amen he's the only thing that will not fail think we were listening to the tape on Friday night and brother branham said that he is a sure foundation a man we can't we can rest on Jesus glory to God blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and he was hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when the heat cometh right because so when he cometh that tree would start withering different things would start happening to it you know just just going through all kind of changes when he comes but but because it's planted a man by by a river represents flowing water is constantly flowing right so here because it's planted there it says roots by the spread of the roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so in the midst of a drought this tree is supposed to keep yielding from I like that a man I think that's talking about us a man I i'ma say it talks about you it talks about me this is our life represented here in the scripture the Bible says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked no I the Lord SERP start I try the Rings even to give every man according to his way and according to the fruit of his doings Amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer father we approached your word we have read scripture and we thank you Mark for the precious sister that sent this to us from Georgia Lord sister Tucson there we thank you for this and encouragement a man that we could have and we just draw a little strength of little felt from this on today and just pray that it just be a help to us Lord as we press into this service be glorified and magnified not only by those that are that are here present but those that are watching online be glorified and magnified in their lives in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you can be seated so I I struggle with this I mentioned this a man little earlier and brother brother Diggs kind of took it from him and they called it the blessings of covet 19 and I'm gonna just use a test I'm gonna use the title of the testimony testimonies of covet 19 but and that's that's that's for a reason out I'll say that low leaders just I know that many have suffered some things through this but but you know there's I think we also need to take time to glorify God and some of the things that he has done in the midst of what we have faced I was mentioning to the church when first started God's already on the other side of this waiting bust again right and you know and and sometimes it's just good to go back and look and see what the Lord has done a man we give the devil too much credit sometime hey man let's let's exalt Jesus amen just for a few minutes we want to exalt the Lord Jesus so I want to just first just read a quarter to a man before we get into these testimonies this a man is coming from the sermon the Good Shepherd of the sheep and this scripture that I read I have a little program where it helps us to find different places where brother Branham might have spoken concerning that scriptures something that might be related to it and what when I did my search it actually kind of pointed to this scripture in Jeremiah 17 but Jeremiah 17 also ties into Psalms chapter 1 we'll read that in a little bit but David says very similar words that Jeremiah says amen and we want to just kind of catch that so our hope and our trust is in God a man and I just want to read this just kind of get us started this message Good Shepherd of the sheep the prophet makes a statement he says we learn a lot of things by sheep so just by watching sheep we learn a lot of things he says if we could just notice them and watch their actions and she is a sacrificial animal hallelujah a sheep is not an animal that bucks and kicks against amen different things a sheep actually bears its rule to sacrifice amen and when the owner comes to take the rule from the Sheep they just give it up with no problem they made a sheep actually gives us it right its rights a sheep forfeits those things the Sheep don't try to hold on to subin's is one that has a very weak nature a soup is one that's she a sheep is a different animal than any other God God God Himself his representatives as sheep as read I mean that's the way he could go to a cross he had to humble himself to go to that cross hallelujah sheep is willing to give up things he may look and say a ship is a sacrificial animal little innocent fellow and he's totally helpless when he's lost amen I think that's why Jesus liking us unto sheep because they just can't seem to find their way around they have to depend on me a man must say they just won't do it and that goes to show me one thing it will like it to shoot in God's heritage then we can [Music] amen we are helpless and we've got to depend on the great Shepherd of the sheep the Lord Jesus he says I noticed that the slaughterhouse once someone was speaking to me about how they slaughter the Sheep and when they want the Sheep to come up to come out of the corral and go up the chute where they kill the Sheep go leave them up there they'll follow the goats and this goat will lead them up to the place where the killing takes place and then he will jump right onto that death that's just the nature of the goat so you want to make sure you're not falling on a goat and I'm gonna tell you something about a goat and a sheep from what I hear brother branham is gonna tell us a little bit later the way today sound hallelujah amen they both sound the thing well it's hard to tell the difference between the bleeding of a goat and of a sheep there are a lot alike but the nature of them proves where they are last away with confessed Christians and real Christians the goat represents the role they'll lead you right down the wrong road to your eternal separation from God they'll lead you into trouble so if we are simply better watch where counter Shepherd we got all right I like I like that I was thinking I'm gonna come back to this quote in a second but you know I was thinking on this you know I was one time we were set up you know sheep have different nature date certain they don't even think certain lease right they just suggest they just got a way of presenting themselves and you know as as God's people even when we were sinners there are certain things that we just wouldn't do other folk matter did it but we didn't think that way and I remember we you know one time we invited this young man to come to our house you know just to kind of hang out at the house with us and and you know he comes over and you know has it has a good time and and you know and and then on the way on the way home me and my brother had to walk the fella home and daddy told us walk come on make sure you get home safely sorry all right no problem we walked him home and as we're getting down the street we get almost to where his house is now our house is weighed the other way but we get to almost where his house is and this fella I don't know where he got this idea from he just he found a rock in the street somewhere picked the rock up and just threw it at a car and almost broke the window and so now we weren't thinking like that we didn't think about picking up rocks and throwing them at cause we that was not part of our nature but this guy thought that was just very funny so he picked the rock up and he threw it and and before you know it that car made a u-turn and that car was coming back towards us now we don't know what to do and so we see him take off running so we take off running right not now the problem is if we get separated somebody gonna be in trouble right so so so we you know we finally got out of the thing and and now you gonna be home but we gotta walk back the same way that we just pain right made you not even thinking about how you put us in danger see we got realize it but even at that time we had nature we perform like dogs we didn't do things like that so being a Christian you better believe I'm gonna act like a sheep I'm gonna I'm gonna talk like a sheep I'm gonna swab like a sheep the way that got in the way why the guy expects me to respond that's what I'm gonna do Roly to God he says this he says now shiipa funny like creatures in one way he says here's another thing that we might learn of sheep tonight when the weather is real hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves and one be at one place and one at another but right in the heat of the day the sheep will all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shade for the other that's what sheep they don't separate when things get hot they actually come together and they make shame for each other if somebody's trying to separate the sheep you already know that the right spirits like the Sheep they may quote scripture like the Sheep creating separation for one another they're having fellowship glory to God if there's ever time to make shame for a brother it's this time now if there's any time to make shape our sister glory to God brother branham don't say it will it be good if all God's sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials are real hard in the heat is on everything going on everywhere if all of God's little sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shade of each of them the comfort to lean upon each other now someone said is that necessary brother brother it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing the Heat's on you can go to this friend and sat down to just explain it to them talk it over in personal confidence and then see not just now this could love us we talked it over but this is the part we miss it and being kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good god save man a woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good to do that come let us reason together saith the scripture I come let us stand together it says and I noticed another thing we'll see when I see sheep and coat in a coal country when all the Sheep the blizzards come to break the wind all those little sheep will come from one side of the field to the other and hold it up together it keeps each other warm the warmth from each body helps warm the other so whether it's hot or whether it's cool the Sheep can always stay together glory to God if you pulling away something wrong with your nature he goes who says and I think when the church gets real cold and indifferent God's sheep are the kind of huddle up together and pray for each other and the warmth of a real good Christian Fellowship oh it means so much we talked about all God's sheep hey I want to say we talked about all Godsey when we come under the blood we become she hey man we don't look at the color of our skin anymore we will you see and we all got huddled together glory to God hallelujah amen I think that when the church gets real : and different God's sheep ought to count I'll hold up together and pray for each other and the warmth of a real good Christian Fellowship oh it means so much David spoke of it in the first Psalm said blessed is the man that said if not in the seat of the scornful standeth in the way of sinners but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in the law doth he meditate day and night and he should be like a tree that's planted by the river water and his leash or not whither whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so that scripture that he's quoting we're gonna read that Psalms 1 we'll just grab that but that connects right back to Jeremiah 17 amen verse 7 and 8 verse 7 sent blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is verse 8 and Jeremiah 17 said for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out a ruse by the river and shell and and shall not see when the heat come it but a leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit and brother branham taught it over here to Psalms 1 verse 1 through 6 blessed is the man oh my I like this statement I mean as David just started writing songs his first song bliss is the man and I must say blessed is the Worman that walketh not hallelujah amen if you want to be blessed you can't listen to other folk capsule that's not Christians I'm about if you really want to be [Music] [Music] now when you get like that when you can walk like that and think like that and talk like that no matter what's going on around you the Bible say he shall be like a tree o also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper man I just I just I'm just blessed amen when I read this scripture you know and I want to talk about these testimonies of co19 you know in the midst of this you supposed to prosper if you follow the Word of God you know you're supposed to prosper come on somebody amen you are supposed to prosper you suppose a prosperous spiritually you're supposed to prosper physically you're supposed to prosper amen financially you're supposed to prosper in whatever way you got to live you're supposed to prosper amen because your truth is splinted huh Amen by the rivers of water you're gonna bring forth fruit in your season it might not be season but it's your season Lolita car can I tell you something if season hey I know what I'm talking about here this morning a man I'm walking in my season a maybe knowing that brother I was down there at the Pool of Bethesda and there was a whole bunch of folk waiting for the angel of trouble the water the Bible said in a certain season a man at that age will come in in trouble the water but do you realize that the angel was not there trouble in the world the man was still waiting but because Jesus came to him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but I like the wind therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of their ungodly Shall Perish blessed be the name of the Lord all right amen let me uh just kind of read a couple more things here and then we'll go into some testimonies and man this is coming out of message Jehovah Jireh thank you lord thank you Jesus hey man he says and remember you remember the bright free message says many who takes the tape how did the husbandman came forth and it was bearing the wrong kind of fruit so we cut it off cut it off can't keep cutting it back cutting it back but Joe sent what ha more left the caterpillar eating what the caterpillar left something else eaten we find out them egg insects is the same insects only in a different stage and what the Lutheran left the Methodists eaten well the men that is left the Baptist's eaten what the Baptist's left the Pentecostals eaten the whole thing is cut down but God said I will restore sayeth the Lord all the years I'll send back another Church in the last day I will restore that original power again now I love that you know this this Sunday amen and I wasn't even you know I just happened to hear somebody talking about on yesterday but I wasn't even in tuned with what was going on but this Sunday represents what they called Pentecost Sunday right so 50 days after a man the the crucifixion and resurrection amen this was a 50 days after this went an original Pentecost took place so you know they always kind of celebrate this just throughout the years and we realized east to keep changing every year they man and that that's all from a pagan system that generates that hallelujah hey I know some people they'd only want to celebrate Easter because of that pagan system I think it's good we celebrate Easter amen because it represents our Lord and Savior amen or rising again and I don't just celebrate Easter at Easter I celebrate it every day every time I see the Sun Rise I'm celebrating Easter hallelujah right so so you know but but we know things shift like that but yet this year this is supposed to be Pentecost Sunday where the church should be thinking about how the power of God move some 2,000 years ago amen that the political arena has our minds ticking on other things we should be praying for another move of the Spirit huh we should be looking for another move of the Spirit amen he said I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh my your sons and your daughters will prophesy dream dreams we should see the supernatural God moving in the midst of his people amen what he promised him - well hallelujah look at this now he says I will restore said the Lord all the years I'll send back another Church in its last days I'll restore that original power again in the evening time it shall be light down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches is food there will come forth the royal seed of Abraham hallelujah God promised it God will do it he said he would do it I will restore the years that the denomination's eat I say Amen today because some of some of my lovers been ate up by denomination but God say he go restore all the denominations but but yet they were coming out of the heart of it he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water a man that meditates in the Word of God day and night not to a Creator denomination see what you're thinking about at night but what you're reading at night I want to encourage you read the Word of God amen read the Word of God and let the Word of God just become part of you whilst it says it says that a man that meditates in the Word of God day and night not to accrete a denomination but meditates in the word day and night he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water branches shall not wither he'll bring forth his fruit in the season God promised it alright a man so one more quote here out of the junction of time thank you Jesus a man a man a man that tree can't be shook a man we you know and I mean you you say you know you try to run up to the oak tree or something that you just planted last year you ain't gonna get nothing from it you can't even get shade from it says but you get one that's been around and went through some storms then had some trials in their life planted by the rivers of water you can sit down there and get some shades a man when you're going to talk to somebody talk about how a sheep gather together talk about something I've done been through something a man they can tell you something people that's done been there and done that they can tell you a little bit by something and you can get some shade Amen hallelujah all right look at this the junction of time he says but then just before that God brought the show down to show who was God they're coming they're coming time that there was a prophet came into the land by the name of Elijah who was anointed with the message of God and he performed the miraculous and proved that I'm not an impotent what I mean omnipotence still was miraculous the Prophet stood out there and closed the heavens that it didn't rain in the days of his ministry and he brought the rains down out of the heavens and give the earth and angels appeared on the scene hallelujah baked him some cornbread that kept him 40 days alive while he was out there in the wilderness with God angels appeared in the end time all the prophets and the signpost point saying this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did that for those little junctions back there what will he do now when all hell turn loose Alleluia what will God do now when all he'll turn loose brother branham say all heaven real time that's what I'm looking for angels appearing signs and wonders on the earth the counterfeit horizon God proven which is right and wrong a man hallelujah so I you know this fellowship with some brothers a man me and brother Quentin and brother Diggs and as I was fellowship in you know when brother Diggs was here preaching for us and we were in the car just kind of talking and I've said brother I thank God for the blessings of kovat 19 and brother Diggs took Danny just he start run he said brother I'm have to preach it you know and he just said just really something struck him and and and I do see some blessings I see some I see some things that has happened and and I want to say this before I get started with some of these testimonies I want to express my sincerest condolences so anyone that has been impacted negatively by this virus I just got a text on my phone this morning pastor in Africa that has passed away I don't know if it was covert 19 relator said he just had a brief sickness and he died and you know and at this time there's many there's there's many churches that have lost pastors we got friends that have lost loved ones and and and I I do I do not want to minimize what they have experienced during this time I know that that is that's rough I know that stuff any time you lose the love when it's tough you know I know churches that have been impacted multiple people in the church have have gone on to be with the Lord and you know as a Christian we know that whether it was covert 19 or whether it was a car accident or whether it was a plane going down whether it was you know you just died in your sleep you know anytime a Christian leaves it's a benefit for them a man they did not lose when they when they when they go death becomes a vehicle that carries us into the presence of Almighty God but nonetheless when we're here on this side we still miss our loved ones and we understand that and our prayers are that God would just strengthen and encourage and help those during this time a man a pastor reached out to me I think yesterday and told me and his church that they one of the oldest Saints got sick he'd been sickly for a while and and he got he got the virus and he ended up dying and you know going on and he said you know they they had to go through some things like that night and I know that those are hard things that you have to deal with you know I know I can say thank God we haven't had to bury anybody here and that to me that's a blessing that's the blessing praise the Lord Amen so we certainly sympathize with everybody and we trust that God will continue to comfort your hearts but I just wanted to take this time to simply highlight some of the positive events that also have occurred during this pandemic a man if that's all right so I was fellowshipping a man with some other ministers and and and as we were fellowship and there's one brother as a pastor out of Texas his name is brother Jeremy and I brother Jeremy sent out a whatsapp message he says your brother's colleges share some testimonies with me of some things that God has done in the midst of this pandemic and and as we as we just everybody just begin to chime in and talk about little things that the Lord has done at the churches and you know so brother Jeremy took it and he he developed a sermon and he preached the message I got good news hey man so I need to listen to that one brother so so he got it and and so this week I was just kind of thinking to myself so I would love to maybe take that same list and bring it to our church so I reached out to the to the ministers and I also reached out to brother Jer Jeremy I say brother Jeremy could just send me that list that you had you know you ride and preached it give me what you got you know and he and he sent me the list though I say well praise the Lord so I won't just kind of share with you some things that happened amen during this time hallelujah brother Jer and maintenance note he says he says I sent messages to many ministers across the nation asking for a testimony of what God has done during this time where Satan thinks he's got us amen but he said here's another edition of take that devil hey man we write in another edition of I like that brother Branham say when the devil say boo say boo and this is our edition of Sam go back to the devil hallelujah amen so this first thing is a pastor in Alberta Canada a man said that the last full service before the lockdown amen the Holy Spirit came in such a powerful way that the anointing led to an altar service and a number of the young people got a breakthrough one was baptized and others he said in his Senate testimony others finally found Liberty in worship what a man I said God can do it in our brother their God can do it here also calling people getting to number two you've had a breakthrough one was baptized others finally found Liberty in worship and the service lasted till midnight and that has been etched in our hearts during this time so before the lockdown they had a service that lasted till midnight naked as feast and fellowship or next hallelujah see God beat the devil to the to the punch Saint man another word brother Ron Spencer he's a pastor Amen up in Virginia area and brother Ron's been going through some things with cancer and he and he put there in the late I put there as his response a brother Jeremy say this may seem small to some but but I'm still alive [Applause] because he was diagnosed with cancer they was doing all kind of tests even during the midst of all of this but he say he made it out and made it back to his pulpit to preach the gospel say I'm still alive I got something thank God for and the devoman trying to wipe that brother for years but even Kovac couldn't get him so I chimed in to I said brother I got some of the friends guys I said we've we baptized for new converts during the lockdown and I say if Heaven is rejoicing over somebody repenting then we rejoice them as well we got something to praise God for now I want to challenge the church I don't want to just stop at those Saints being baptized I just believe that if a person can be led to come to baptism then they can also be led to come to truth so I'm praying that God would continue to deal with their hearts that they will walk through these doors and find fellowship they man so pray for them for Souls amen let's pray to we a man they say push pray till something happens let's keep praying I mean grandpa dem forces God that came to Tobit we don't want to see them lost let them come now and get underneath the covering of the world get some truth amen another some other things that was mentioned all the pastor's were saying that sense they had start streaming they've been they actually discovered backsliders joining during the livestream hallelujah so if so the streaming is actually bringing the prodigal son in the end the streaming is actually bringing the prodigal daughter you might not have everyone reads to people but because of colvett we had to do streaming and the streaming has been reached in the backslider some people don't feel comfortable coming into the church they don't know how to church gun receiver hallelujah so but they feel comfortable in our house and I want to tell you amen you are accepted I don't care what man this one brother that start streaming is passed to Lindsey McGrady he started streaming his services and he had a neighbor that lived across the street from the church that never even came through the church doors but the man watched the streaming of the service and when he watched as he watched multiple services and the Holy Spirit began to deal with the man the word touched his heart and a man start asking for prayer - he'd be able to receive the Baptist or the Holy Ghost he was a neighbor across the street and now he want to go back into the church now after he starts dreaming God know what he doing another testimony Pastor David sila I believe up in Tennessee if I'm not mistaken he during this during this dis virus he got a call a man from a brother called it on behalf of his wife the wife was experiencing a stroke and you know her speech start slurring and and half a body was drawn up in pain so the pastor just begin to pray pass to David begin to pray for and he called back to check on the sister 30 minutes later and the sisters arm began to unfold her face began to release [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's the same yesterday today and forever amen I don't know how much y'all want me to give y'all but I got a lot here all righty man this is this now this testimony is in two parts and man this is about brother sister Karen Pruett this is brother Tim Pruitt's wife they were in church and I don't know if they were in church or at home or whatever but the song was saying a man and they heard it he'll do it again amen they just they heard that he'll do it again and the song just really began to minister to them and they didn't realize why the song meant so much to him consistent Karen end up going to the hospital with a brain bleed in the midst of Kovach 19 she went up going to the hospital with a brain bleed just as bad and now they live in the Louisiana area right so just and and she had this the same bleed in the same spot five years earlier right and then they couldn't believe that it showed up in the same spot how did the same thing happen the doctors were dumbfounded but you know you know during this time somebody go to the hospital the family can't go in with them and I'm none of that but it just so happened that there brother in the church that was a nurse and and when he found out that was what was going on he was there working at that hospital he had a chance to go in a man and just pray with the pastor's wife God make a way right because they would get ready to transfer for her from that hospital to the hospital way away and again the family can't go see you she just dare by herself a man so you know we all over they begin to acts with prayer and all the brothers let's begin the pray and and they begin to run tests and do all the things that they need to do and you know and God just got eventually touched her raised her up but she went on back home but in the midst of this the other part to this Amen brother Nathan Brian received this same prayer request for sister Karen and when he got the prayer request he said he just felt a bird in his heart say I got to go out to my shed and I got to pray and he went there to the shed he began to pray and you known as he was praying you know he say felt the Spirit of the Lord coming to the shed and I wouldn't spin Lord came he said my Sanchez know something's giving it happened I don't know what's gonna happen but I know God is answering this prayer but then why he was pregnant his phone started vibrating he said well maybe somebody calling to tell me something that happened sister Sharon say let me let me check before he say usually he won't check his phone to see if he's praying he just let it vibrate but he said he's he thought the Spirit of God so real that he said somebody might be calling me right now by Sister Sister Carrie so he'd say he'd checked the phone but it wasn't for sister Karen there's another sister saying please pray for my husband he just left our house my my son came home and found the dad's car gone it's clothes gone and he left her cellphone sitting on the counter right here daddy's gone we don't know what to do just pray for my husband so our brother needs them ready and while the president of the Lord's Day he just began to pray and intercede on behalf of this man and on behalf of his family so as he as he was praying amen the man was driving down the street of man saying I am on my way to Michigan and I'm gonna go to Michigan I'm not gonna be found in Michigan that's where I left my cellphone they're not gonna find me he say he feet felt like a hypocrite he didn't feel like a Christian he just didn't feel right so he was leaving his family he was leaving everything so as he was gone as waves of Michigan brother made to this in the end the prayer calls it in the shed praying this man hears a voice say turn around go to this other city you have a past in that city that you need to apologize to 15 years ago you did this and you need to go apologize to that pastor and then have him pray for you to receive the Holy Ghost he says he said he turned the car he didn't know where he was going he went back to the city being led by the spirit and when he when he went back to the city he got just checked himself into a hotel accident did they know about such-and-such a church they said yeah yes right down the street when you got up next morning went on down there to where they say the church was nobody was I mean nobody was there I think and he said it's total look like the church and I think somebody ended up coming out somebody was cutting the grass and they came out and start talking to me like I'm looking for such-and-such and you know can you tell me say well that name sound for me I think if you keep driving down this way you might find where they live he said well alright I'm gonna just keep driving so he'd say Lord I remember the house from years ago but I just don't know what houses I remember what it kind of looked like if you just leave me God I gonna make things right he kept driving kept driving all of a sudden he saw the house he said I think that's the house and he pulled up and and the pastor's wife was standing outside and he what I be saying sister do you remember me she said no I don't remember you he say his brother saw him so here he say yeah he's on the inside so my went running the house told her past everything that happened out of what sort of Lord told him to come and make something right and he said pastor you supposed to pray for me after I make it right so I can receive the Holy Ghost say say the pastor say you came to the right place young man pastor received his apology prayed for him the man was filled with the Holy Ghost praise God let the pastor's house went back to the hotel call his cell phone [Music] because you couldn't remember everybody else number but he called his number his wife picked up the telephone he's beginning to repeat to his wife begin to make things right with his wife and his wife so you know at the same time you turned around it's the same time that I said the text to brother Nathan and he was praying they knew God was answering at the same time god don't play games send a man turn around and went back home and the house was a new house the reason he couldn't get free was because he did something years ago that he never made right hallelujah that happened in Kovac nineteen glory to God we had a another request since I'm talking about brothers brother Nathan and si I want to also say this because you might ask well why did sister Karen have to go through and brother brother Jeremy put this in his notes and I want to bring it out so why did sister Karen have to go through her ordeal and it happened in the same spot it's because it produced a prayer from brother Nathan to get in contact with God and when that anointing came down it also produced a release for another family he might not have had that burden had it not been sister Karen God uses everything for his glory don't you worry about what you're going through God don't use that to help somebody else [Applause] brother Nathan's mom we've been praying for her sister Dottie Bryant during this time was diagnosed with stage four cancer and we've saw we brother Nathan's come here and pray for different ones who's been set free from different things God has heard his prayer for healing of the sick with praying that God will hear the prayer you know for his mom you know we're just encouraging him and whatever whatever way we can again having to go to the hospital by herself nobody can go in there with and and she was kind of telling the family please don't tell everybody what's going on just just wait until we get some things from the doctor just keep it keep everything at bay brother Nathan was feeling like momma you know people keep asking and we keep telling but we're getting close to having a life for you so we got we got to tell the truth mama we got to tell the truth he said she say okay you got all the doctors report you already know what what it is let us think snow what skin right what's going what I'm going through so Nathan say I wanted to go out and tell the church you know what was going on and but before I did that I wanted to tell my children what was happening now at the time that he was giving and tell his children there was another sister a man that was streaming the serve his services wasn't coming to church he was at streaming services and this sister has been out of church for a number of years now she's got grandkids and when her granddaughters walked up to and say grandma does God speak to little children does God speak to little children a grandma said you know what I really don't know how to answer that so the grandma I just pushed it over to the side and say I just don't know so so brother Nathan a man he says you know I need to tell my family before I tell the church what's going on with momma whatever what's going on so he sat down with his family and say you know Mama's going through this and just wanted you all to know cuz I got to make an announcement at church but I wanted y'all to know first she's suffering it and they've got been diagnosed with stage-four cancer but we believe God's gonna heal her so just just keep keep keep grandma in prayer so one of his sons said daddy if you don't mind could I speak with you and mama a little bit I mean after everything is done say yeah sure you can so the little boy I think was Phillip it says daddy I want to tell you that I'm not surprised that girl Maya got cancer so you're not surprised like why it's daddy because I was here in the house the other day and and and you know I guess he talked to him on on a Saturday and he was the third he say on Thursday night I was here in the house and I thought I heard you call me daddy so I went running to the garage where you usually be at you know out in the garage area you done converted to an office I come running out there but you weren't in there you weren't in your office so I looked over in a certain area where I thought maybe he was behind this behind that but daddy wasn't there so I I'm like I thought I heard my dad call me he said so I turned around I walked back to the room and as I was walking to the room I heard the voice voice telling me Dottie Bryant has cancer but she's gonna be healed she said so daddy I'm not surprised that that girl my got cancer but I know she's gonna be healed because because of what God's so brother Nathan goes to church the next day and he announces this over the string guess who was watching the stream the look girl that was asking can't God speak to kids and when she heard the Jesus God is moving Church I was talking with one of the brothers we after I put the little request out there for somebody to share some testimonies when brother Darrell Ward gave me a call and I want to pull up this scripture a man Isaiah 41:10 if you just get that ready for me don't put it up just yet just get it ready the brother Darrell Ward that called me was cutting his grass that said brother Jack I just wanted to call you and talk to you about a testimony and he says so there was a man in the city

wanted to come back to Christ he wanted to come back to church but he just didn't know how I where to get started I say just dark the doors you get started right there picking up this phone and calling me it's a good place to get started huh he say he knows what he means in his life so I just encourage him just to start coming to church and I was expecting him to walk through the door today but I know how that devil fights so I text him before I came out to officer I was expecting to see he say pastor I'm sorry I didn't make it this is the third time that he's trying to come through the doors but the devil has found him I said it's okay we prayed for you here is the link to the service industry me [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory to God can I give you just a few few more I got my timer here I got about 18 more minutes one other things that bless my heart and I thought this was a I thought this was another confirmation when I saw sister Sorel come through the door today another confirmation because mr. Sorrell had been streaming the services and we had things on Facebook were streaming and one of the one of the one one day we got a notification from I believe one of your relatives was hosting a watch party of our service now if the if the if they're hosting a watch party all of their people that they that they follow them we'll see what's going on here at church now we would know you know by by her being home and streaming not other relatives start streaming and other relative hosts or watch smart we got people in our church that don't think about hosts and watch parties right but this approach might even go in our church but yet well host of us whether I think that's a blessing because the gospel is able to get out to a lot more people one of the biggest things that happened during this time the finances of God's people have been sustained I only know to a man that lost state jobs temporarily but even in the midst of losing their jobs it was making more money with the with doctor job hallelujah Amen God sustaining I know people that have received blessings $1200 blessings y'all know what I'm talking about I know cuz something got him yet but somehow some of us have received them now I have no businesses that have received blessings hey man alright God is moving God is sustaining his people a man I want to thank God for the keyboard that was purchase and there were various Saints from from other cities Amen other churches even here in town I won't call them names but they donated towards the keyboard we thank God for you god bless you and return back to you one hundredfold amen we appreciate it a man iiiii was I was talking about a man how I finances were sustained I brother Garin thank God they protected your jobs you gave us the testimony he didn't have the position that was supposed to be a man cat but God kept him and people trying to figure out how did this happen save up blessed is the man that trusted the Lord and whose hope the Lord he is that's why hallelujah Amen I was I was I was another another person then share the testimony now I'm have to steal it brother but this and this in this season brother Jer was blessed with a new car now y'all know he had a Cadillac but now he became a witness y'all know that becoming a witness in a BMW be my witness pavement brother Jerry you know the Lord's been good to him got married earlier this year before this all broke out right got married earlier this year and you know and and brother Jerry was you know he'd come to me talk to me about a potential job that he wanted to do and I was just I was just like oh my brother you want to do this you know and I'm like you sure brother I said cuz I I seen God open up a door for you to get into that barbershop I mean we watched God just you know get you through schools so fast and you know just we saw the hand of God yeah so you sure about this I say I say one thing I do know the business that you're going in is actually a scriptural business because you know they supposed to build and do all these things and wouldn't win and win when I went and at the time of the second coming the Lord so being in the mortgage business is a good business to be and I know that as I said but just be sure he say he said yeah I still be able to do both of them I said okay brother all right just you know let's just keep it in prayer so he went past the test and he got this job with this mortgage company became a mortgage broker while he was still cutting here amen I got my first haircut by brother Jerry right there in the bathroom of the church a man and Co at 19 he had his tools in his car that's all so you know I was um I was just sitting there so does this week I happened to go to the barbershop to get another haircut and and and he was there and you know brother Gary was using my Bible so he said brother Jerry back that's it brother Jerry you not at work said I'm here back that he's working back there I say hello it's brother Jerry what you do you say brother they told us we gotta be off for the rest of the year we can work from our homes the rest of the year which means I got both jobs right here somebody [Music] [Applause] [Music] some of y'all was able to work from home for a season that's a blessing some of us was able to spend more time with our family that's the blessing we was able to get a little bit more rest that's a blessing thank God for these black things that have happened testimonies I know that there were some businesses that actually began to grow even during this season the Lord has blessed the businesses where they begin to pick up others start at new businesses even during this time that's that's the blessing of God and one thing you know I'll share this and try to bring this to a close our business that the Lord gave us through whatever you do supposed to prosper but our business that the Lord gave us right before Kovac we had three clients that God had blessed us with and and because of Kovac different reasons we ended up losing all the claims just different reasons everybody had something different and we understood but you know I took it upon myself there was a thing that I knew for the business I needed to invest in it in order to take it to another level and and I said some paperwork that I got to fill out got to submit it got to do this I gotta do that so I took it upon myself to get it all done and on May 1st which was our anniversary I submitted the paperwork and and I think like May 24th or 25th I got the kind of response back that hey you have been approved there's one last thing that you need to do and we'll call you let you know and that's done but you can improve your business is going to the next level right [Applause] thank y'all for that and in the midst of losing you know those clients I would say so we were serving the client three clients we had about 24 hours of service committed you know 24 hours a week that we were we served those clients and so losing those hours then just filing the paperwork we just you know just kept walking my faith and not by sight on the other end of this God blessed us with one client that is gonna be over 80 hours just one client I mean I seen the hand of God in the midst of this right where others are falling apart no we don't be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and whatever you do see you see if you if you if you if you fix glasses prosper if you deliver packages prosper do you work in a doctor's office prosper if you a teacher prosper if you work at the airport prosper

if you work in the school system prosper your mortgage broker prosper you can't have prosper you just graduated high school [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] another episode of take that devil [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord a man a man a man let me read this last quote when their eyes were open this last quote the musicians you all can prepare to come today man when their eyes were open it says how many read the sermon when omnipotence speaks miracles happen did you believe that certainly I'm nipa to spoke at every Junction and when the church cooled off and the omnipotent spoke smear spoke miracles takes place and this is a junction of all junctions this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand so you can expect omnipotence to speak and you can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles that's ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come I say amen to that if Jesus carries it will be there watch for sitting Therese up his - when all heaven turns loose all hell turns loose - and it's prophesied that there be a Janus and Jambres on the earth in the last days who would almost impersonate the real thing so close in to deceive the very elect if possible see so we're looking for all of that so my Christian friend the best thing for you to do and I to do is the stay just as close to the Lord Jesus as we can love him and pray daily that God would help us and guide us that we'll be on his side when the end finally comes that's our that's the that's our desire our heart and I'm sure if we're sincere in our heart and study his word and receive all that he has for us will not be deceived by the Antichrist and his power did you notice the Antichrist can do everything but he'll he can't heal did you notice Janice and Jambres when they stood against Moses they could do they could do every but he'll they could bring curses but they couldn't take it away see God's the only healer there is he's the only one can heal and today we have the finest hospitals we ever had finest doctors we ever had smartest doctors bet the best doctors the best drugs we have a practice
