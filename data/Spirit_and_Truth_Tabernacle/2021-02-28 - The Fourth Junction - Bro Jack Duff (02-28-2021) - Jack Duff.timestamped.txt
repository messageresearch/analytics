[58:14] the eleven lifted up his voice and said
[58:17] unto them
[58:19] uh ye man of judea and all ye that dwell
[58:21] at jerusalem
[58:22] be this known unto you and hearken to
[58:25] my words for these are not drunken as
[58:29] ye suppose seeing it is but the third
[58:31] hour of the day
[58:33] but this is that which was spoken by the
[58:37] prophet
[58:37] joel and it shall come to pass
[58:42] in the last days saith god
[58:46] i will pour out of my spirit upon
[58:49] all flesh your sons and your daughters
[58:53] shall prophesy and your young men

[59:03] word of god is written
[59:05] amen and you know these things were
[59:07] written

[59:11] written
[59:12] before you made your mistakes
[59:18] before you fail god it was already
[59:20] written about you
[59:22] so it's not based on your mistakes and
[59:24] your failures it's based on what god has
[59:26] already spoken
[59:28] verse 18 says and all my servants and on
[59:31] my handmaidness i
[59:33] will pour out
[59:37] in those days of my spirit and they
[59:39] shall
[59:40] prophesy and i will show wonders in
[59:43] heaven above and signs and earth beneath
[59:45] blood and fire and vapor of smoke
[59:48] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[59:50] and the moon into blood before
[59:52] that great and notable day of the lord
[59:55] come
[59:56] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[59:59] praise god
[1:00:01] shall call in the name of the lord shall
[1:00:04] be
[1:00:05] saved no matter what your condition is
[1:00:08] if you just call
[1:00:08] on him he will answer a man
[1:00:12] a man amen praise the lord you can be
[1:00:15] seated
[1:00:17] amen praise the lord
[1:00:21] as we uh continue our journey
[1:00:25] a man here in these seven junctions this
[1:00:29] morning
[1:00:30] we want to preach on the fourth junction
[1:00:34] and the prophet told us amen in the
[1:00:37] message
[1:00:38] junction of time he says that there were
[1:00:40] seven great junctions that he saw
[1:00:42] in scripture uh and what we've done is
[1:00:45] just kind of take
[1:00:46] each junction um and just kind of
[1:00:48] brought that forth the first one
[1:00:50] first junction was noah uh and the ark
[1:00:54] that was a junction uh a second junction
[1:00:56] was moses and the children
[1:00:58] of israel coming out of egypt coming out
[1:01:01] of bondage that was a junction
[1:01:03] uh the third junction which we just
[1:01:05] ministered on a few weeks ago was
[1:01:07] about abraham and locked and i'll talk a
[1:01:10] little bit about that
[1:01:11] a little bit more about that in a second
[1:01:13] uh this fourth junction is about elijah
[1:01:16] and the 450 prophets of baal
[1:01:19] amen and certain things that happened
[1:01:21] during that time
[1:01:23] the fifth junction uh brother branham
[1:01:26] said
[1:01:26] jesus came at the fifth junction
[1:01:29] uh the sixth was martin luther
[1:01:32] and john wesley brother branham uh said
[1:01:35] that martin luther and
[1:01:36] john wesley was a junction and then
[1:01:40] the last or the seventh junction would
[1:01:42] be the second coming
[1:01:44] of our lord and savior jesus christ so
[1:01:47] uh we want to pick up just a little
[1:01:50] quote here
[1:01:52] out of the junction of time paragraph e4
[1:01:55] and it says this my subject this morning
[1:01:59] if we should call it such will be
[1:02:02] the message to the church is the
[1:02:05] junction of
[1:02:06] time and always in the days gone by the
[1:02:10] dispensations has always
[1:02:12] come to their end and we hit a junction
[1:02:15] amen the dispensations come to their end
[1:02:19] and we hit a junction it says uh there's
[1:02:22] junctions
[1:02:23] on the highways the junction
[1:02:26] uh on the roads that we travel in this
[1:02:29] world now when he's talking about that
[1:02:31] uh when you hit a stop sign you hit a
[1:02:33] junction
[1:02:34] when you hit a red light you hit a
[1:02:37] junction
[1:02:38] a man when you hit a roundabout you
[1:02:40] actually hit a junction
[1:02:42] and uh and when you're in a roundabout
[1:02:44] you have to be very very careful
[1:02:46] uh because uh if you get in there and
[1:02:49] and don't know where to get off you end
[1:02:51] up right where you left off
[1:02:53] praise the lord right and then sometimes
[1:02:55] when you end up going on the wrong turn
[1:02:57] you might go uh oh wow you know we were
[1:03:00] we were
[1:03:01] recently taking a little trip and and uh
[1:03:03] and i i
[1:03:04] i i took a little turn amen on the road
[1:03:07] and i said lord i hope this is the right
[1:03:09] turn
[1:03:10] because as i was driving i noticed that
[1:03:12] there was nowhere to turn around
[1:03:14] it was miles before you could actually
[1:03:16] turn around
[1:03:18] hallelujah i hope you can catch
[1:03:20] spiritually what i just said
[1:03:22] if you make the wrong turn at a junction
[1:03:26] it might be miles and let me put it this
[1:03:29] way it might be
[1:03:30] years before you can actually turn
[1:03:33] around and get that thing right again
[1:03:35] that's why it's so important to make the
[1:03:37] right turn at the junction
[1:03:39] the holy ghost is trying to warn the
[1:03:41] church
[1:03:42] amen the holy ghost is telling us where
[1:03:44] we're at you i mean not not only
[1:03:46] a as a as a the whole church is at a
[1:03:50] junction
[1:03:50] but individually we are at junctions in
[1:03:54] our life
[1:03:55] hallelujah you must make the right
[1:03:57] decision
[1:03:58] at the junction you must make the right
[1:04:01] turn
[1:04:01] at the junction hallelujah glory to god
[1:04:05] and god forbid if you leading people
[1:04:08] amen like i told y'all my daddy was
[1:04:10] leading some people
[1:04:12] amen if my daddy would have made the
[1:04:14] wrong turn in some of them trips
[1:04:16] everybody would have been impacted
[1:04:19] hallelujah
[1:04:20] glory to god hallelujah somebody
[1:04:23] as a pastor i got to make sure i'm not
[1:04:25] making the wrong turns in the south
[1:04:27] because everybody will be impacted
[1:04:30] hallelujah daddies amen you got to make
[1:04:33] sure you're making the right decision
[1:04:35] for your family because your family will
[1:04:37] be impacted
[1:04:39] bless it be the name of the lord all
[1:04:41] right it says the junction on the roads
[1:04:43] that we travel in this world
[1:04:45] they junction on this grand old highway
[1:04:47] that we travel to glory
[1:04:48] and always it takes the miraculous to
[1:04:51] speak of
[1:04:52] omnipotence omnipotence is the
[1:04:55] all-powerful
[1:04:56] and it takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:04:59] the omnipotence
[1:05:01] and only the miraculous can
[1:05:04] do that so see i mean it's one thing
[1:05:07] uh for me to just say the omnipotence is
[1:05:10] here
[1:05:10] it's one thing to say that that that god
[1:05:13] is all-powerful
[1:05:14] but it's another thing when god comes to
[1:05:16] vindicate those statements himself
[1:05:18] and at the junction we actually expect
[1:05:22] god to come and vindicate that he is
[1:05:25] omnipotent we expect god to vindicate
[1:05:28] that he is
[1:05:29] all-powerful i don't care what your
[1:05:31] situation is
[1:05:32] we had a junction
[1:05:35] and you ought to look for god to do
[1:05:37] something at the junction
[1:05:40] amen and only the miraculous can do that
[1:05:43] teaching of the word is a very fine
[1:05:45] thing
[1:05:46] and it comes faith comes by hearing and
[1:05:48] hearing the word but it always
[1:05:50] takes the miraculous to vindicate that
[1:05:52] the omnipotence still lives and reigns
[1:05:55] we must have the miraculous
[1:05:59] god i say amen to that we must have
[1:06:02] the miraculous all right amen now i also
[1:06:05] just kind of these are some quotes that
[1:06:07] um
[1:06:08] uh uh that just kind of help us you know
[1:06:11] afford and i thought i'm i'm kind of
[1:06:13] these are things to set our background
[1:06:15] this other uh message hear ye him
[1:06:17] another statement that is made about the
[1:06:19] junction uh here and here ye him he says
[1:06:22] every junction of time god sends forth
[1:06:25] prophets then angels and gives a warning
[1:06:30] every junction of time god sends forth
[1:06:32] prophets
[1:06:33] then angels and gives a warning like him
[1:06:35] uh before the ant of the living
[1:06:37] destruction before
[1:06:38] every other time god always sends
[1:06:40] warnings first
[1:06:41] he could not put punishment on the earth
[1:06:43] without and uh without first sending
[1:06:46] warning all right now we got to watch
[1:06:49] that because uh you know uh certainly we
[1:06:52] have had we've been warned uh
[1:06:53] tremendously about different things that
[1:06:55] about to happen
[1:06:56] in this this season this junction uh the
[1:06:59] coming of the lord there were seven
[1:07:01] things that was supposed to happen
[1:07:03] before the coming of the lord
[1:07:05] and you all just saw one of them
[1:07:06] manifested right before your very eyes
[1:07:09] amen in uh and in the fulfillment of a
[1:07:12] 80 something old prophecy of brother
[1:07:15] branham saying that we would have a
[1:07:16] woman vice president
[1:07:17] not only told us that she would be vice
[1:07:19] president he even told us the colors
[1:07:21] that she would be wearing
[1:07:23] praise the lord and and on inauguration
[1:07:25] day she was wearing those colors you can
[1:07:26] take that down amen uh
[1:07:29] she was wearing those colors so you know
[1:07:30] here we are we're seeing
[1:07:32] many things happen right before our very
[1:07:34] eyes and i pray that we don't miss it

[1:08:16] go forward
[1:08:17] i mean bring it bring out a couple more
[1:08:19] things there uh abraham
[1:08:21] we know was the prophet during
[1:08:24] that junction he was the prophet the
[1:08:27] word of the lord always comes to the
[1:08:28] prophet
[1:08:29] uh there were some miracles that
[1:08:31] happened because at a junction we should
[1:08:33] see
[1:08:33] certain miracles that are taking place
[1:08:36] uh one of the miracles that happened
[1:08:38] was the secrets of the heart was
[1:08:39] revealed amen the secrets of
[1:08:42] of sarah's heart where she was laughing
[1:08:44] at the promise of god
[1:08:45] uh while god was there in human flesh
[1:08:49] uh talked with abraham and sitting there
[1:08:51] eating and drinking milk
[1:08:53] uh he asked why is he saying first say
[1:08:55] where's sarah thy wife say oh she in the
[1:08:57] tent behind you
[1:08:58] and as they begin to talk saying now i'm
[1:09:00] going to visit you at the time of life
[1:09:02] abraham and sarah thy wife shall
[1:09:05] have a son and he say uh abraham like
[1:09:08] okay
[1:09:09] and sarah's sitting in the tent she
[1:09:10] started laughing it's like now me and
[1:09:12] abraham
[1:09:13] uh have pleasure gifts and no i don't
[1:09:16] i'm not sure if that's gonna really
[1:09:17] happen
[1:09:18] now um um and and and god himself with
[1:09:21] his back turned to the tent says
[1:09:24] why is sarah laughing hallelujah
[1:09:27] now abraham didn't hear her laugh glory
[1:09:30] to god nobody else heard a laugh but in
[1:09:32] her heart she was laughing
[1:09:35] laughing at the promise so so uh so
[1:09:37] sarah said i wasn't laughing he said yes
[1:09:39] you were laughing hallelujah glory to
[1:09:42] god he could have struck sarah dead
[1:09:44] right there on the spot hallelujah but
[1:09:47] because she was a part of
[1:09:49] abraham he allowed her to live let me
[1:09:52] tell you your sin could have caused you
[1:09:54] to die
[1:09:55] a long time ago but because you're a
[1:09:58] part of christ
[1:10:01] that's why you're still moving in grace
[1:10:04] hallelujah somebody amen but the secrets
[1:10:07] of the hearts were revealed
[1:10:09] and you know at this time and there was
[1:10:12] another thing
[1:10:13] uh that happened and i want to be
[1:10:16] careful as to how i say this i'm trying
[1:10:18] to approach this
[1:10:19] very delicately amen but uh
[1:10:22] but there was a a thing that happened
[1:10:24] and sarah and abraham's time and i was
[1:10:27] this week i was listening to a preacher
[1:10:30] preach
[1:10:31] and uh he made a statement that i had
[1:10:33] never
[1:10:34] looked at before i never thought about
[1:10:36] it like this before
[1:10:37] and uh and he's talking about he say uh
[1:10:40] you know during sarah and abraham's time
[1:10:42] uh one of the things that that that god
[1:10:44] did was a change of the body
[1:10:47] in order for abraham and sarah to
[1:10:49] produce isaac
[1:10:51] god had to change their bodies
[1:10:55] he says now when you look around today
[1:10:58] and you see everybody
[1:10:59] inked up right hallelujah
[1:11:04] amen so you look at everybody inked up
[1:11:06] their whole arm is covered
[1:11:08] amen and tattoos they say what it is is
[1:11:10] people trying to produce
[1:11:12] their own change of the body
[1:11:16] glory to god amen but you got to go
[1:11:19] beyond just
[1:11:20] you know somebody inking up but we are
[1:11:22] living in a time where we can do
[1:11:24] whatever we want to do with our bodies
[1:11:27] come on somebody and by doing that we
[1:11:29] don't realize that
[1:11:30] amen under a natural influence we're
[1:11:33] trying to change the body
[1:11:35] but in abraham and sarah's day was god
[1:11:38] changing the body
[1:11:40] hallelujah and we are under expectation
[1:11:42] for god to change the body again
[1:11:46] one of these days my brother my sister
[1:11:49] this
[1:11:49] mortal will put on immortality
[1:11:53] and the bible says we shall be
[1:11:56] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:11:59] an eye
[1:12:02] praise god when you come to church the
[1:12:05] surgery is taking place
[1:12:07] god is cutting this off god is cutting
[1:12:10] that off
[1:12:11] your body is being changed even right
[1:12:14] now
[1:12:16] glory to god hallelujah
[1:12:21] but this was this is one of the miracles
[1:12:23] during that time god
[1:12:24] changed their bodies to be able to
[1:12:27] produce the promised sun
[1:12:29] the blinding of the sodomites was
[1:12:31] another thing that happened there
[1:12:33] a miracle that took place sodomites were
[1:12:36] blinded to
[1:12:37] you know the uh the angels that were
[1:12:39] there
[1:12:40] inside him trying to get locked in his
[1:12:42] family out
[1:12:43] and i mentioned this i think on
[1:12:45] wednesday night church don't linger
[1:12:48] don't linger sin amen lot
[1:12:51] had a word from the lord come out
[1:12:55] amen but lot kept lingering in sodom
[1:12:58] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:13:02] i think the thing of it is that we ought
[1:13:04] to be satisfied that god dealing with us
[1:13:07] amen if he's not dealing with my brother
[1:13:08] my sister ain't got nothing to do with
[1:13:10] that but god is dealing with me
[1:13:12] i cannot stay in sodom
[1:13:15] i can't stay in these conditions and i
[1:13:18] got good news here this morning
[1:13:19] if god will go get an umber i'm a make
[1:13:22] believer out
[1:13:24] what do you think he's going to do for
[1:13:25] your family
[1:13:27] hallelujah lot was a make-believer but
[1:13:30] god went and got lot out of sodom
[1:13:34] that same holy ghost is here to produce
[1:13:36] a deliverance for our loved ones too
[1:13:38] i'm under expectation hallelujah
[1:13:42] at the junction abraham had to make some
[1:13:45] really really big decisions
[1:13:47] he had to leave his kindred he had to
[1:13:50] search what city whose building maker
[1:13:52] was god
[1:13:53] hallelujah amen and uh you know and i
[1:13:57] was just kind of thinking
[1:13:58] and abraham's junction they were abraham
[1:14:01] made plenty of mistakes along the
[1:14:03] journey
[1:14:04] plenty of mistakes now i'm gonna just
[1:14:07] kind of uh
[1:14:08] uh uh line up some of these one in
[1:14:11] genesis 12.
[1:14:12] he gave his wife to pharaoh that was a
[1:14:15] mistake he lied and told pharaoh that
[1:14:17] that was his uh
[1:14:18] sister but it was his wife and and and
[1:14:20] the man took his wife but god gave
[1:14:22] gave her back uh also in genesis 16
[1:14:25] abraham got hooked up with hagar
[1:14:29] that was a big mistake he should not
[1:14:31] have listened to
[1:14:33] sarah to go and make ishmael ishmael
[1:14:36] became a thorn in their flesh
[1:14:38] and still isn't thrown in the flesh even
[1:14:40] to this day hallelujah
[1:14:42] amen that was a huge mistake that
[1:14:45] abraham made
[1:14:46] and that and also uh in genesis 20
[1:14:49] before the promised son was brought to
[1:14:51] abraham he gave his wife again to
[1:14:54] abimelech
[1:14:55] second time this man has given his wife
[1:14:58] that god made a promise to
[1:15:00] he give this man give his wife away to
[1:15:02] another king
[1:15:03] what a shame for abraham
[1:15:06] i want you to think about this glory to
[1:15:08] god but paul writes some things about
[1:15:11] abraham
[1:15:12] even though he made all these mistakes
[1:15:15] paul writes these qualities in
[1:15:17] in romans 4 verse 17 through 21
[1:15:20] and i won't read all of that i'll just
[1:15:22] say this amen
[1:15:23] well yeah let's read it romans 4 verse
[1:15:25] 17 through 21
[1:15:27] glory hallelujah all these mistakes that
[1:15:31] he's making
[1:15:32] bible says as it is written i have made
[1:15:34] thee a father many nations
[1:15:36] before him whom he believed even god who
[1:15:39] quickly the dead and calleth those
[1:15:41] things which be not as though they were
[1:15:44] glory verse 18 it says who against hope
[1:15:47] believed in hope
[1:15:49] that he might become the father many
[1:15:51] nations according to that which was
[1:15:53] spoken
[1:15:54] so shall i see be now this is what paul
[1:15:57] is writing about abraham even though
[1:15:59] i can see abraham has made many mistakes
[1:16:02] now abraham don't look like a man of
[1:16:04] faith to me when i read
[1:16:06] this story in the bible i can't see that
[1:16:08] this man is a man of faith
[1:16:12] but the good thing about when i read
[1:16:13] about abraham and i see all his failures
[1:16:16] and i see all this all his mistakes i am
[1:16:19] a seed of abraham
[1:16:21] i have failures i have mistakes but god
[1:16:24] sees
[1:16:24] me the same way that he saw abraham
[1:16:28] amen who against hope believed in hope
[1:16:31] that he might become the father of many
[1:16:33] nations
[1:16:34] according to that which was spoken so
[1:16:35] shall thy seed be
[1:16:37] amen go on to the next verse and being
[1:16:39] not weak in faith
[1:16:43] that's what paul said about him being
[1:16:45] not weak in
[1:16:46] faith i want you to i want you to see
[1:16:48] something sometimes you got to stop
[1:16:51] seeing yourself the way the devil
[1:16:54] wants you to see yourself you got to see
[1:16:58] yourself the way
[1:16:59] god sees you
[1:17:02] even though he gave his wife to these
[1:17:04] leaders i mean to the to
[1:17:06] the kings and all that god said being
[1:17:08] not
[1:17:09] weak in faith
[1:17:14] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:17:17] when he was about 100 years old neither
[1:17:19] yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:17:22] i love these qualities about abraham
[1:17:24] look at this
[1:17:25] he's staggered come on
[1:17:31] see now that that's what men would say
[1:17:34] amen when i look at it in genesis i
[1:17:36] would say he's staggered
[1:17:40] glory to god but what god says is he's
[1:17:43] tagging not
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:47] oh what that tells me is that every turn
[1:17:50] we make
[1:17:51] is predestinated by almighty god
[1:17:54] every decision that we take it's
[1:17:57] predestinated by almighty god
[1:17:59] hallelujah he staggered not at the
[1:18:02] promise of god
[1:18:04] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:18:06] giving glory to god
[1:18:09] and look at this and being fully
[1:18:11] persuaded
[1:18:13] that what he had promised he was able
[1:18:16] to perform now i love amen
[1:18:20] paul's description of abraham because i
[1:18:24] believe what paul gives us is what
[1:18:26] god actually sees in abraham
[1:18:29] man only sees your faults man
[1:18:33] only sees your failures but god sees a
[1:18:36] promise
[1:18:37] that he made to you praise god
[1:18:41] and i'ma tell your failure can't even
[1:18:42] stop god's promise
[1:18:46] your unbelief won't stop god's promise
[1:18:49] ain't nothing you can do to stop god
[1:18:51] from fulfilling what he said he's gonna
[1:18:53] fulfill
[1:18:54] glory hallelujah now i love this and i
[1:18:58] want to just kind of present this to you
[1:19:00] the reason paul to write such precious
[1:19:04] words concerning
[1:19:05] abraham in romans 4 is because abraham
[1:19:09] glory before he fell before
[1:19:13] he gave his wife to pharaoh before he
[1:19:16] had
[1:19:16] ishmael before he had uh before he gave
[1:19:20] his wife to
[1:19:21] abimelech before he did all this abraham
[1:19:25] received
[1:19:28] an unconditional covenant
[1:19:32] oh church that ought to make everybody
[1:19:35] happy
[1:19:36] abraham had an unconditional covenant
[1:19:40] before his mistakes
[1:19:45] and if abraham had that
[1:19:48] you are abraham seed
[1:19:52] you are under the unconditional covenant
[1:19:55] now that does not give you a license to
[1:19:58] sin
[1:20:00] but when you sin and repent
[1:20:05] did you hear me when you sin and you
[1:20:07] repent
[1:20:08] you can get up from there there is no
[1:20:11] condemnation
[1:20:13] when you truly repent
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:21] glory to god look at it in genesis 12.
[1:20:24] let's look at
[1:20:25] let's read genesis 12 verse 1 through 3.
[1:20:27] this is the brother branham said this
[1:20:29] was the
[1:20:30] unconditional covenant that abraham
[1:20:33] received
[1:20:33] before his mistakes oh
[1:20:36] if we can only get that then we don't
[1:20:38] have to sit with mine battles and
[1:20:40] everything else we can get up and run
[1:20:42] for our life
[1:20:44] glory hallelujah hey man now you know
[1:20:47] here's the thing
[1:20:49] uh the goal
[1:20:53] the goal is not coming to church
[1:20:57] right all right that's not the goal
[1:21:02] the goal is getting to heaven
[1:21:07] and there's a reason we come to church
[1:21:08] in order to get there
[1:21:10] right the church is a place that that
[1:21:12] helps correct certain things in our life
[1:21:16] right you know i mean maybe certain
[1:21:17] things that we we get tied up in in the
[1:21:19] world and
[1:21:20] you know things of the world maybe our
[1:21:22] thinking needs to be corrected
[1:21:25] praise the lord it's very easy to start
[1:21:28] getting this worldly thinking but we got
[1:21:31] to bring ourselves back to biblical
[1:21:32] thinking
[1:21:34] and that's why you come to church in
[1:21:35] order to hear the word of god
[1:21:37] it elevates you to live a lot higher
[1:21:39] than everybody else
[1:21:42] come on somebody right but bro you gotta
[1:21:44] understand it's not just coming to
[1:21:46] church you
[1:21:47] there's many people i said this on on on
[1:21:49] on wednesday night i'm gonna say it
[1:21:50] again
[1:21:51] many people come to church to try to
[1:21:53] please brother jack
[1:21:56] no that's not why you come to church i
[1:21:58] don't want brother jack to call me
[1:21:59] i don't want him to ask where i'm at
[1:22:01] that ain't why you come to church
[1:22:04] you come to church because you love god
[1:22:08] because you can't wait to get into his
[1:22:10] presence
[1:22:12] if you ain't got that kind of love for
[1:22:13] god you're missing something
[1:22:16] hallelujah somebody amen
[1:22:20] amen i'm not coming because i'm one of

[1:24:27] love you god still loves you he still
[1:24:30] cares
[1:24:31] all right all right i want to just show
[1:24:33] you uh genesis 12 and
[1:24:35] amen we'll move on here genesis 12 1
[1:24:37] through 4 says now the lord
[1:24:39] has said unto abram get thee out of thy
[1:24:41] country and from thy kindred from thy
[1:24:42] father's house unto the land that i will
[1:24:44] show thee
[1:24:45] and i will make of thee a great nation
[1:24:48] and i will bless thee
[1:24:49] and make thy name great thou shalt be a
[1:24:52] blessing
[1:24:53] this is what we call the unconditional
[1:24:55] covenant this was not based on anything
[1:24:57] abraham did hallelujah this based on
[1:25:01] this based on god said i will make of
[1:25:03] thee a great nation
[1:25:04] i will bless thee and did god do it
[1:25:08] i mean i could i can go back and show
[1:25:10] you scripture where i says abraham was a
[1:25:12] very
[1:25:12] rich man that's what the bible says
[1:25:16] that's what the bible say abraham was a
[1:25:19] very
[1:25:19] rich man when i saw that i said amen
[1:25:23] because i'm one of abraham's seed
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:30] i hope y'all can get what i'm saying
[1:25:32] here
[1:25:35] it's right in the scripture glory to god
[1:25:38] says i will make thee i will make of
[1:25:40] thee a great nation
[1:25:42] and i will bless thee and make
[1:25:45] thy name great and i love the and and
[1:25:48] and that means it's gonna keep adding
[1:25:51] and thou
[1:25:52] shalt be a blessing hallelujah
[1:25:55] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:26:02] hallelujah amen and curse him that curse
[1:26:06] of
[1:26:07] and in thee shall all families on the
[1:26:09] earth be blessed
[1:26:11] so abraham depart as the lord had spoken
[1:26:13] unto him and the lord went with him and
[1:26:14] abraham was 75 years old when he
[1:26:16] departed out of
[1:26:17] iran so here we see before abraham made
[1:26:20] any mistakes
[1:26:22] abraham was already covered underneath
[1:26:24] this unconditional covenant
[1:26:26] and as abraham sees we got to realize we
[1:26:30] have a covenant on us too
[1:26:31] amen glory to god even through our
[1:26:34] mistakes now let's go on here
[1:26:36] and pick up the fourth junction
[1:26:39] here uh let's go uh to paragraph e79
[1:26:43] in the message the junction time
[1:26:46] hallelujah god's prophet makes this
[1:26:50] comment he says
[1:26:51] notice when the junction time
[1:26:54] came god had a prophet appear on the
[1:26:57] earth elijah
[1:26:59] he had angels appear on the earth
[1:27:01] absolutely
[1:27:02] he had signs and wonders to appear on
[1:27:04] earth
[1:27:05] he shut the heavens that it didn't reign
[1:27:07] in the days of his prophecy
[1:27:10] he done other things and miracles and
[1:27:12] signs before the people
[1:27:13] to prove it that's another one it's the
[1:27:17] fourth one all right so he's talking
[1:27:18] about this fourth junction this is
[1:27:20] elijah
[1:27:21] uh the prophet at mount carmel
[1:27:24] and uh and when we talk about the
[1:27:27] miraculous that has to take place
[1:27:30] uh when a junction occurs we we look for
[1:27:32] the miraculous there's a
[1:27:34] a quote and i'll probably bring it in a
[1:27:35] few weeks brother adams say
[1:27:37] uh speak omnipotence it's just in the
[1:27:40] middle of his summary say speak i'm
[1:27:42] nepotism
[1:27:43] and i just had to say the same thing
[1:27:45] speak omnipotence
[1:27:47] glory to god i want him the speakers
[1:27:50] it's more than a man just speaking
[1:27:52] but speak omnipotence let the miraculous
[1:27:55] take place before the people
[1:27:57] where they know it's nothing but
[1:27:59] almighty god
[1:28:01] hallelujah but here in the days of uh
[1:28:04] elijah he was the prophet
[1:28:06] amen that god had called uh at that time
[1:28:09] the prophet elijah
[1:28:10] and we we found a story in the book of
[1:28:12] first kings
[1:28:14] and uh and here you know there's uh
[1:28:16] eight miracles that happened
[1:28:18] in his ministry the first of the
[1:28:20] miracles that happened
[1:28:21] and elijah's ministry was he shut the
[1:28:24] heaven
[1:28:25] that it did not ring elijah went out and
[1:28:29] told
[1:28:30] the king at that time king ahabi says it
[1:28:32] says
[1:28:33] it won't rain until i say
[1:28:36] it can rain now imagine a man having
[1:28:39] that type of authority
[1:28:41] that he can actually stop the rain
[1:28:46] what a man but i want to tell you was
[1:28:49] not elijah himself doing that
[1:28:52] it was god inside of elijah
[1:28:55] giving him the authority and the power
[1:28:58] to stop
[1:28:58] the rain pretty much he told ahab y'all
[1:29:02] can stop your fasting
[1:29:04] you can stop praying it will not rain
[1:29:06] until i say it can rain
[1:29:10] hallelujah that was the first miracle
[1:29:12] amen uh
[1:29:14] another miracle you know that happened
[1:29:16] there with uh
[1:29:17] elijah glory hallelujah
[1:29:20] is that he went down there to the widow
[1:29:23] woman's house
[1:29:24] and when he went down there to a house
[1:29:27] uh he was already told by god
[1:29:29] that go to a certain brook amen
[1:29:32] go you know what i think i want to do i
[1:29:34] i'm gonna read this
[1:29:37] imma read this one i think let's go to
[1:29:40] first king 17.
[1:29:43] some things i want the holy spirit to
[1:29:45] just quicken to us there
[1:29:48] first king 17.
[1:29:52] hallelujah some of the miracles that we
[1:29:54] see uh are happening here
[1:29:57] oh glory
[1:30:00] here in first king seven it says in
[1:30:02] elijah the tish fight
[1:30:04] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[1:30:07] said in ahab as the lord god of israel
[1:30:11] liveth
[1:30:12] before whom i stand there shall
[1:30:15] not be dew nor ring
[1:30:19] these years but according to
[1:30:22] my words now that's powerful no
[1:30:26] do no rain nothing
[1:30:29] until i call for it
[1:30:33] that's a man that understood his
[1:30:34] position right
[1:30:36] you know let's go on it says and the
[1:30:38] word of the lord came
[1:30:40] unto him saying that now you gotta
[1:30:42] understand with
[1:30:43] it not being any do with it not being
[1:30:45] any reign
[1:30:46] this actually also impacts the prophet
[1:30:48] elijah
[1:30:49] he can't get water and water is needed
[1:30:53] to live
[1:30:54] right so he can't even get water but but
[1:30:56] oh
[1:30:57] hallelujah amen but but but god had to
[1:31:00] make a way for elijah
[1:31:02] in the midst of all this now watch this
[1:31:05] and the word of the lord came up to him
[1:31:06] saying
[1:31:07] get thee hints and turn thee eastward
[1:31:11] and hide thyself by the brook cherith
[1:31:14] that is before jordan so god knew
[1:31:15] exactly
[1:31:16] where to send the prophet now watch this
[1:31:20] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[1:31:23] the brook
[1:31:25] and i have commanded the ravens to feed
[1:31:27] thee there
[1:31:28] now i was just reading and i don't know
[1:31:30] i'll probably get to the quote a little
[1:31:32] later we'll see
[1:31:33] uh if not it's all right because i'll
[1:31:34] just say it i'll say it brother branham
[1:31:36] said
[1:31:37] god had already a man made a way for
[1:31:40] elijah
[1:31:41] before the problem actually started
[1:31:45] i have commended
[1:31:48] amen that the the reigners knew exactly
[1:31:51] where to go
[1:31:52] whether elijah was there or not the
[1:31:55] ravens would have been there
[1:31:57] i have commended hallelujah
[1:32:01] i like that amen god had already made a
[1:32:04] way for that promise to be fulfilled
[1:32:06] god has already made a way to meet your
[1:32:09] needs
[1:32:10] god has already made a way to touch your
[1:32:12] body
[1:32:13] what god has commanded for these things
[1:32:15] to happen
[1:32:18] oh glory to god i
[1:32:21] have commanded the ravens to feed thee
[1:32:25] there
[1:32:27] can i just also put it this way you
[1:32:28] can't go anywhere to get food
[1:32:33] if you want spiritual food if you want
[1:32:36] supernatural foods

[1:32:41] i have commanded the ravens to feed thee
[1:32:44] dead
[1:32:45] amen look at this it says so he went
[1:32:49] and did according to the word of the
[1:32:51] lord for he went and dwelt by the brook
[1:32:54] cherith
[1:32:55] that is before jordan and the ravens

[1:32:58] and flesh in the morning and bread and
[1:33:00] flesh in the evening

[1:36:53] glory to god glory to god
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:37:03] now i want you to go with these ravens i
[1:37:05] told the ravens go to the brook cherith
[1:37:08] and you stand right there elijah you
[1:37:10] just wait right there
[1:37:11] and now now while he's waiting guess
[1:37:13] what happens at the brook tariff
[1:37:15] the water begins to dry up
[1:37:20] and remember it was
[1:37:23] it was his words that caused this
[1:37:26] condition
[1:37:30] sometimes your words cause your
[1:37:32] condition
[1:37:34] but in the midst of your words causing
[1:37:36] your condition
[1:37:38] god still want to make a way to show you
[1:37:41] that he's still god
[1:37:43] look at this in the next verse verse
[1:37:46] seven
[1:37:48] and it came to pass after a while
[1:37:53] that the brook dried up because there
[1:37:56] had been no rain
[1:37:58] in the land now who said no rain it was
[1:38:00] it was elijah that said no rain
[1:38:03] and the word of the lord came into him
[1:38:05] saying a rocks
[1:38:07] glory to god give thee to theraphat now
[1:38:10] i want you to understand
[1:38:12] in their father there was still another
[1:38:15] jug of water
[1:38:19] even though everything else had run out
[1:38:21] and you can imagine
[1:38:23] the prophet coming to zarephath i want
[1:38:25] to get to all of this
[1:38:26] but you can imagine him coming this air
[1:38:28] fast probably very thirsty
[1:38:31] i had no water in a few days and and i
[1:38:33] didn't know how
[1:38:34] god was going to provide and and god
[1:38:36] said just go to seraphim
[1:38:40] because in zarephath there was a woman
[1:38:42] that knew where to get some water
[1:38:46] let's watch it now said the word lord
[1:38:48] came unto me saying
[1:38:50] unto him saying arise get to this
[1:38:52] airport which belonged to zion
[1:38:54] and dwelt there behold i have commanded
[1:38:56] there's another commandment
[1:38:58] amen glory i love the way the lord do
[1:39:02] things
[1:39:03] even when it looks like it's at its
[1:39:05] worth worse
[1:39:07] hallelujah the song said even when it
[1:39:09] seems like you're not working
[1:39:12] even when i can't i can't see it i can't
[1:39:15] feel it
[1:39:16] one thing i do know you never stop
[1:39:20] you never stop you never stop working
[1:39:26] praise the name of jesus he's working
[1:39:29] right now
[1:39:31] why are you sitting here god is working
[1:39:34] god is sitting sending angels to answer
[1:39:37] that request
[1:39:39] and i want to tell you church there's
[1:39:41] nothing too hard for god
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:44] amen there is nothing too hard for god
[1:39:49] oh jesus these are not just songs that
[1:39:52] we sing
[1:39:53] but we're looking for the miraculous
[1:39:55] attraction
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] look at this look at this he says this
[1:40:01] verse nine arise
[1:40:03] give thee to zarephath which belongs to
[1:40:05] zion and dwell there behold
[1:40:08] i have commanded a widow woman there to
[1:40:10] sustain thee
[1:40:13] now when you look at this widow's woman
[1:40:14] condition don't look like she can
[1:40:15] sustain nobody
[1:40:18] hallelujah it says so he arose and went
[1:40:22] to zarephath
[1:40:23] and when he came to the gate of the city
[1:40:25] behold the widow woman
[1:40:27] was there gathering of sticks and he
[1:40:29] called to her and said fetch me
[1:40:32] i pray thee a little water in a vessel
[1:40:35] that i
[1:40:36] may drink now this woman knew where the
[1:40:39] water was
[1:40:40] because look she didn't say nothing
[1:40:41] about the water i mean she had no
[1:40:43] problem when he actually ordered look at
[1:40:45] the next verse
[1:40:46] she says and as she was going that means
[1:40:49] she was going to get some water
[1:40:52] as she was going out now see the first
[1:40:54] thing what the problem did
[1:40:55] he had to test her obedience
[1:41:01] he had to test to see whether she would
[1:41:02] be obedient and and i'm gonna tell you
[1:41:04] what god does sometimes to give you
[1:41:06] something easy
[1:41:08] to be obedient to oh somebody work with
[1:41:11] me
[1:41:12] she knew where the water was that's why
[1:41:15] she had no problem going to get water
[1:41:18] and he was testing her obedience see oh
[1:41:20] you need water okay i'll go get you some
[1:41:22] water
[1:41:22] and as she was going to fetch it
[1:41:26] hallelujah nice saying okay i know
[1:41:28] she'll be obedient to that now i gotta
[1:41:30] hit her where it hurt
[1:41:33] he called and said bring me
[1:41:36] i pray thee i'm also the bread and not
[1:41:39] hand now this is where things got
[1:41:43] awkward things change right here
[1:41:46] so you see sometimes when we're being
[1:41:48] challenged
[1:41:49] come on i might as well say these things
[1:41:52] when you're being challenged to do
[1:41:54] something that you're not comfortable
[1:41:56] with
[1:41:57] god want to feel see if you'll be
[1:41:59] obedient
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:02] sometimes you might get challenged to
[1:42:04] leave a relationship
[1:42:07] come on somebody sometimes you might get
[1:42:09] challenged to leave a job
[1:42:12] can i talk about it you might be
[1:42:15] challenging areas that you never thought
[1:42:16] you would be
[1:42:17] challenged but god is testing your
[1:42:20] obedience
[1:42:22] here it is here it is watch this next
[1:42:24] verse
[1:42:26] and she said see this one she has
[1:42:29] something to say
[1:42:30] not with the water but with the breads
[1:42:32] wait a minute now wait wait wait
[1:42:34] ash and she said as the lord thy god
[1:42:37] liveth i have not a cake
[1:42:39] now god said he sustained he gonna
[1:42:41] sustain the prophet through this woman
[1:42:44] now look at that testimony i have not a
[1:42:46] cake
[1:42:47] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[1:42:50] little oil in a cruise
[1:42:51] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[1:42:54] that i may go in and dress
[1:42:56] it for me and my son that we may eat it
[1:42:58] and die
[1:42:59] now she's explaining her condition now
[1:43:02] god told the prophet
[1:43:03] i i commanded this widow woman to
[1:43:05] sustain you
[1:43:07] her testimony i ain't got nothing to
[1:43:09] sustain you with
[1:43:12] hallelujah right
[1:43:16] that's her testimony but god had already
[1:43:19] told a prophet
[1:43:24] i'm sending you to her house because she
[1:43:26] got
[1:43:27] everything to sustain you
[1:43:31] now now somehow the way you see it and
[1:43:34] the way
[1:43:35] god see it somebody change
[1:43:38] so that you can see what god see
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:44] something has got to change speak
[1:43:50] omnipotence
[1:43:53] oh my amen thank you so here we see it
[1:43:56] in the next verse elijah said in her
[1:43:58] fear not
[1:43:59] i know i heard your testimony i know
[1:44:02] what you're going through
[1:44:03] your situation don't look too good right
[1:44:05] now
[1:44:06] fear not
[1:44:08] [Applause]
[1:44:12] glory fear not go
[1:44:15] and do as darwin said go do exactly what
[1:44:17] you plan on doing
[1:44:19] but when you go get to that that when
[1:44:20] you get to your little barrel there
[1:44:22] and you pull out that little bit of meal
[1:44:24] and your little bit of oil that you were
[1:44:26] talking about
[1:44:27] make me there of a cake first now you
[1:44:30] heard him say i
[1:44:31] ain't got nothing to make no cake with
[1:44:34] but when you get to the barrel when you
[1:44:37] get to your oil
[1:44:39] make me a cake first
[1:44:42] and bring it unto me and after make
[1:44:44] revealing for that son
[1:44:48] look at this now cause she was she was
[1:44:50] already doubting
[1:44:51] now wait a minute man of god i just told
[1:44:53] you something
[1:44:55] and i don't think you heard what i said
[1:44:58] well he has something to kind of change
[1:44:59] her attitude
[1:45:01] and this word these these these five
[1:45:03] words
[1:45:04] will always change people's attitudes
[1:45:08] right now if you was going through
[1:45:10] whatever you was going through
[1:45:11] if you heard these five words
[1:45:16] i don't care what if the doctor said
[1:45:19] death
[1:45:22] the doctor said you gonna die in 24
[1:45:24] hours
[1:45:25] if you heard these five words you would
[1:45:28] not believe the doctor anymore
[1:45:32] oh hallelujah for thus
[1:45:35] saith the lord those the words that
[1:45:39] you're looking for
[1:45:40] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:45:43] the barrel of mill

[1:45:47] war fell
[1:45:48] until the day that the lord's sin is
[1:45:50] ringing upon the earth
[1:45:54] when everybody else is suffering from a
[1:45:56] drought

[1:48:18] [Applause]
[1:48:30] glory
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:39] another miracle that occurred during
[1:48:41] this time this same woman
[1:48:43] that was uh provided for during this
[1:48:46] drought
[1:48:48] one day the sun that she was providing
[1:48:50] food for this son dropped dead
[1:48:52] and um and and and and
[1:48:56] and and you know she went to the prophet
[1:48:58] and said wait a minute are you you
[1:48:59] bringing my
[1:49:00] my sin back before me you know i i did
[1:49:02] this and i did that and i'm
[1:49:03] not my son is dead what's going on
[1:49:07] and uh what we found there in the
[1:49:08] scriptures that elijah
[1:49:10] you know took the child up into a little
[1:49:13] room and he just kind of stretched
[1:49:14] himself on top of the child and he laid
[1:49:16] there
[1:49:17] and um and uh and the bible said he laid
[1:49:20] upon the child three times
[1:49:22] and after the third time the child
[1:49:24] received life again
[1:49:26] glory hallelujah the child received life
[1:49:30] again this was one of the miracles one
[1:49:31] of the eight miracles
[1:49:33] uh that occurred there uh with elijah
[1:49:36] and i just want to just drop a quote in
[1:49:38] if i can at this section i want to go to
[1:49:41] the message the angel of god
[1:49:44] glory hallelujah amen uh
[1:49:50] it says the doctors knew he was dead
[1:49:55] i went to offer sympathy to the family
[1:49:59] and starting out of the house the wife
[1:50:01] seemingly crying
[1:50:03] of the man and as i started out the door
[1:50:05] human hands seemingly touched me by the
[1:50:08] arm
[1:50:09] and i felt it hold me
[1:50:12] and as i started forward i could not
[1:50:15] move
[1:50:17] when i turned back the hand left me
[1:50:20] so as he's walking out the house he
[1:50:22] feels something just grab him
[1:50:24] say don't don't go nowhere just stay
[1:50:25] right here and then as he turns the hand
[1:50:28] stops now the hand didn't tell you what
[1:50:30] to do now
[1:50:31] it just say don't leave but now the
[1:50:34] prophet has to be sensitive enough to
[1:50:36] the voice of god
[1:50:38] as to what to do next now look at this
[1:50:40] it says i
[1:50:41] went to the bedside and looked down upon
[1:50:45] the man now the man's dead y'all
[1:50:48] it says there was a methodist minister's
[1:50:50] wife in the room and another sister
[1:50:52] and i started to have prayer
[1:50:56] when i come to myself i was laying on
[1:51:00] this man's body
[1:51:02] now he don't remember what happened from
[1:51:04] when the hand told him to turn around
[1:51:06] he got to the side of the bed started
[1:51:08] praying got so wrapped up in the spirit
[1:51:11] that now he's laying on top of this man
[1:51:16] hallelujah we're talking about a prophet
[1:51:17] now glory to
[1:51:22] jesus take that down just for a second
[1:51:29] now you know most of us especially
[1:51:32] nowadays
[1:51:34] if we saw somebody come and end up in a
[1:51:37] spot like this on our
[1:51:38] wait comb it no don't touch them
[1:51:43] right that's the way we acting but
[1:51:46] america
[1:51:48] is about to happen so you can't have
[1:51:51] thoughts like that when it's time for a
[1:51:53] miracle to take place
[1:51:58] [Applause]
[1:52:01] hallelujah sometimes our thinking stops
[1:52:04] miracles from happening
[1:52:07] our unbelief you think god ain't bigger
[1:52:10] than comet
[1:52:11] amen
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] come on church god is way bigger than
[1:52:17] kobe
[1:52:18] we got too many testimonies or too many
[1:52:20] people being healed from it
[1:52:21] amen some of y'all sitting here tonight
[1:52:24] today you've been healed from kobe who
[1:52:26] you think did that
[1:52:28] you hear on the news all the time about
[1:52:29] this person dying that person dying but
[1:52:32] it can take your life
[1:52:34] who you think did that you think vitamin
[1:52:37] c
[1:52:38] did that and and and b three and d
[1:52:41] whatever no that was the hand of
[1:52:44] almighty god
[1:52:46] lemons don't do that and honey don't do
[1:52:48] that
[1:52:49] but god can
[1:52:59] i went to the bad side looked down upon
[1:53:01] the man there was a methodist minister's
[1:53:02] wife in the room and another sister
[1:53:04] and i started to have prayer when i come
[1:53:07] to myself
[1:53:09] i was laying on this man's body the dead
[1:53:12] man
[1:53:13] says had a sheet over his face for at
[1:53:16] least
[1:53:17] a half hour my face was laying right
[1:53:20] against him and i was calling out into
[1:53:22] the spirit
[1:53:23] land brother elijah
[1:53:27] now ain't it amazing that god's
[1:53:31] uh god was the way that he worked that
[1:53:33] he had
[1:53:34] this man's parents name him
[1:53:38] elijah and then we go to the bible see
[1:53:42] that there was an elijah
[1:53:44] that laid on top of a little boy to
[1:53:47] bring him back to life
[1:53:49] now this is an elijah that's receiving
[1:53:51] life
[1:53:52] because the spirit of elijah
[1:53:58] was resting in a man named william
[1:54:00] marion branham
[1:54:01] that brought elijah back to life
[1:54:08] face was laying right against him and i
[1:54:09] was calling out in the spirit brother
[1:54:11] elijah his name was elijah brother
[1:54:12] elijah
[1:54:13] calling out into the land for his spirit
[1:54:15] not knowing what i was doing
[1:54:18] in a few moments i laid still calling i
[1:54:21] felt that this man's hand come up around
[1:54:23] my ears
[1:54:25] the man is working on the pennsylvania
[1:54:26] railroad tonight alive
[1:54:28] dead for 30 minutes
[1:54:32] come on but because a prophet is
[1:54:35] actually fulfilling scripture when he's
[1:54:36] laying there on top of this man's body
[1:54:38] now can you imagine him ladies sitting
[1:54:39] in there in the room
[1:54:40] what would you have done if you would
[1:54:42] have been one of the sisters in the room
[1:54:46] come on see this is why we need to get
[1:54:49] rid of our colonel thinking
[1:54:51] that's why we this is why we got to
[1:54:53] overcome this type of stuff right
[1:54:54] because here god want to do something
[1:54:56] miraculous brother brandon didn't know
[1:54:57] what he was doing
[1:54:59] sometimes you you can't explain god
[1:55:03] oftentimes we want an explanation you
[1:55:05] know what you know that's why i just
[1:55:06] said

[1:55:08] around now how the birds gonna do that
[1:55:10] and

[1:55:14] but the god don't want us to think like
[1:55:15] that no more like no no god i know
[1:55:17] you're making a way
[1:55:18] yeah oh yeah and however you do it i

[1:58:31] have to that i'm carrying god god called
[1:58:33] me to the office
[1:58:35] i didn't even put myself here i ain't

[1:59:02] prophet the right way and because he
[1:59:04] approached the right way
[1:59:05] with respect then he got something you
[1:59:08] know
[1:59:09] you know sometimes folk folk not coming
[1:59:11] to the pastor to get advice
[1:59:14] they're coming to inform they come in
[1:59:17] and let him know what they've already
[1:59:18] decided
[1:59:20] but you didn't ask for advice because
[1:59:22] advice would you already knew the advice
[1:59:24] would have been something different
[1:59:25] than what you did so you didn't ask for
[1:59:28] advice so you're just coming to tell me
[1:59:29] just to let me know

[1:59:46] you asked for advice
[1:59:49] [Music]
[1:59:51] i'm coming back to this but sometimes
[1:59:53] god god has allowed a minister to go
[1:59:56] through different things in his life
[1:59:58] so he can help the people
[2:00:02] and not only go through things see other
[2:00:04] things in life
[2:00:05] i watch i watch other you you think
[2:00:07] you're making a decision that ain't
[2:00:09] nobody made before you i can
[2:00:12] see so and so right now years ago
[2:00:16] they did this they doing the same thing
[2:00:19] you do and you don't you know i mean
[2:00:20] even brother branham come on y'all i'm
[2:00:22] coming back
[2:00:23] brother brandon was about to make a
[2:00:24] decision to leave the field
[2:00:27] say i ain't gonna i ain't gonna preach
[2:00:28] some more i'm just he got tired of the
[2:00:30] people not receiving what he was saying
[2:00:31] so god told him god just showed him
[2:00:33] something oh my
[2:00:35] he said he went to a restaurant and in
[2:00:37] the restaurant god dealt with him there
[2:00:39] was a man come in the restaurant and say
[2:00:40] bailey had his
[2:00:41] i mean where he had his clothes on he
[2:00:43] said man it was a bum and another fella
[2:00:45] that was next to him
[2:00:46] was it was another bump he said now the
[2:00:48] decision that you're getting ready to
[2:00:49] make
[2:00:50] to leave the field he said you're gonna
[2:00:52] end up just
[2:00:54] like him
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:00:58] hallelujah gotta show you your future
[2:01:01] and other people
[2:01:03] if you make the wrong decision at a
[2:01:06] junction
[2:01:09] don't think you can fix it if you could
[2:01:12] have fixed it you wouldn't be in it now
[2:01:16] give it to jesus give it
[2:01:20] whatever it is give it to jesus
[2:01:25] all right i'm coming back i'm coming
[2:01:26] home i'm coming home
[2:01:29] all right so this man say you know
[2:01:33] please prophet don't don't don't don't
[2:01:36] don't kill us you know we're just doing
[2:01:37] our jobs
[2:01:38] it's okay god said you can go with him
[2:01:40] because he respected the way that he
[2:01:42] handled it
[2:01:42] you can go with him so here he go the
[2:01:45] prophet goes down and goes with the man
[2:01:46] and he didn't change his testimony
[2:01:48] because he was a poor king
[2:01:49] i say he gonna die because he's seeking
[2:01:51] for the wrong gods
[2:01:53] see so so here you know uh uh these were
[2:01:56] this this that those were seven of the
[2:01:57] miracles that happened in
[2:01:59] oh i'm sorry another one was the partner
[2:02:01] of the jordan when he was dying
[2:02:03] leaving here go not for not for death
[2:02:05] but really it was a
[2:02:06] a rapture that he was taken and he
[2:02:08] parted the jordan that was the seventh
[2:02:10] miracle but the eighth one is the one i
[2:02:12] want to deal with you know for right now
[2:02:14] um this eighth one is when he caught
[2:02:17] fire down from heaven
[2:02:19] amen and what we have and let me just
[2:02:22] work with this just for a few minutes
[2:02:24] and i will
[2:02:25] uh bring it to a close but
[2:02:28] first kings 18 and verse 21.
[2:02:33] before you bring that up let me just try
[2:02:35] to set this up the children of israel
[2:02:37] got to a spot where they had gotten away
[2:02:39] from
[2:02:40] god being god they were
[2:02:44] they they allowed through ahab
[2:02:48] marrying the wrong woman
[2:02:51] ahab married
[2:02:55] the wrong woman
[2:02:58] and through his marriage it it it
[2:03:01] brought in
[2:03:02] um idol worship
[2:03:05] into the nation of israel right
[2:03:09] uh here a country that was uh controlled
[2:03:11] by god
[2:03:13] uh a country that saw the supernatural
[2:03:15] things of god
[2:03:17] but now and god even told him when when
[2:03:19] moses gave them the
[2:03:20] the instructions from mountain and god
[2:03:22] writing with a finger of his hand and
[2:03:24] said you should have no other gods
[2:03:25] before me here they come and find
[2:03:27] themselves in direct disobedience
[2:03:30] to the word of god through a marriage
[2:03:34] understand that right through a marriage
[2:03:35] now now now uh and the problem is see
[2:03:38] you got to watch what you marry because
[2:03:39] you can't get out the marriage
[2:03:44] you just don't just jump out the
[2:03:46] marriage amen
[2:03:48] you you make a vow till death do you
[2:03:51] part
[2:03:52] praise the lord and i'ma just say this
[2:03:55] amen
[2:03:55] while i'm here just because a person
[2:03:58] gets divorced
[2:03:59] it don't mean that every divorced person
[2:04:01] can get remarried
[2:04:05] some divorced people gonna have to stay
[2:04:07] divorced for the rest of their life
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:11] and the way that we look at things well
[2:04:13] this one got divorced and got remar that
[2:04:15] don't work like that for everybody
[2:04:19] a marriage vow is supposed to be until
[2:04:22] death
[2:04:22] do you part
[2:04:25] you understand church praise the lord i
[2:04:28] know that's a mouthful and
[2:04:29] they have to be sad because sometimes
[2:04:32] folk look at certain situations say well
[2:04:33] they did no
[2:04:34] no no no no no your situation different
[2:04:40] amen and that's why i'ma tell you when
[2:04:43] it come to marriage and divorce
[2:04:45] don't let the congregation be out there
[2:04:47] trying to give advice
[2:04:53] congregation don't do that you'll get
[2:04:55] yourself in trouble with god
[2:04:56] let it run through the pastors look just
[2:04:58] go talk to the pastor
[2:05:00] just go what did he take don't you even
[2:05:03] fix your mouth
[2:05:05] they asked what the pro what the pastor
[2:05:06] said you ain't got nothing to do with it

[2:05:14] all right glory to god i have to say
[2:05:16] things like that god know why they being
[2:05:17] sad

[2:05:20] ain't trying to hurt nobody feelings
[2:05:21] but i am trying to keep sin at the
[2:05:23] church
[2:05:27] i am doing that i i don't want us to
[2:05:30] make the wrong decisions at the junction
[2:05:32] and when it comes to marriage and
[2:05:33] divorce it takes a lot of prayer
[2:05:36] you know brother branham didn't just get
[2:05:38] up there and preach marriage and divorce
[2:05:39] just because
[2:05:40] he waited till he heard from god he had
[2:05:42] a supernatural experience
[2:05:45] before he preached marriage and divorce
[2:05:47] sometime before i give counsel i'd be
[2:05:48] waiting for supernatural experiences
[2:05:52] you understand i mean you can get you
[2:05:54] can get in a world of trouble over that
[2:05:57] church should be all messed up over
[2:05:58] there all right

[2:11:07] if i couldn't see get me out the
[2:11:09] watchtower
[2:11:11] [Music]

[2:11:28] why are you parking over there
[2:11:30] [Music]
[2:11:34] what you had yeah
[2:11:39] because restaurants parked all out here
[2:11:41] why are you parked over there
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:46] don't you think i ain't crazy
[2:11:53] hey i'm coming back to this fourth
[2:11:54] junction i'm just i'm just letting y'all
[2:11:56] know i'm a watchman
[2:11:58] that is that is my job now i might not
[2:12:01] come out here and say things all the
[2:12:02] time but i see everything
[2:12:04] don't think don't think nothing get now
[2:12:06] and see what happens that y'all can hide
[2:12:08] stuff for so long but eventually it's
[2:12:10] going to come out
[2:12:12] and then it got to be dealt with that's
[2:12:15] why
[2:12:15] best get past involved first i don't
[2:12:20] want to i want to see people make it
[2:12:21] that's my that's my my objective i don't
[2:12:23] see
[2:12:23] me this this this first kings 18
[2:12:26] a marriage created a problem
[2:12:30] for the nation amen a marriage caused an
[2:12:34] entire nation to forsake god
[2:12:38] one marriage so that's why as a leader
[2:12:43] a leader has to be very careful as to
[2:12:46] what decisions they make
[2:12:47] because it affects everybody
[2:12:50] you understand as a leader you just
[2:12:53] can't do whatever you want to do
[2:12:55] as a leader you got you got to be very
[2:12:57] very careful because here
[2:12:58] the leader ahab impacted the whole
[2:13:01] nation
[2:13:03] because he married the wrong woman and
[2:13:06] and i'm gonna tell you the other thing
[2:13:07] about
[2:13:07] jezebel she had no intention
[2:13:11] of ever becoming a believer
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:25] she was under a real real bad anointing
[2:13:27] and and you know what
[2:13:29] it was it was so bad i mean don't you
[2:13:32] think a woman that
[2:13:33] that that wicked maybe god would just
[2:13:36] get rid of her
[2:13:37] no he let them live with her
[2:13:40] and live through all her antics
[2:13:44] finally we get to the spot where
[2:13:48] the prophet elijah can see that the
[2:13:49] people have come to all this
[2:13:51] they they're forsaking god they're not
[2:13:53] serving god anymore
[2:13:54] they say this is shameful i'm
[2:13:58] how could the nation of israel get to
[2:14:00] this spot right
[2:14:02] how could it happen says you know what i
[2:14:04] i'm tired of this so
[2:14:06] he makes a statement in first kings 18
[2:14:09] first kings 18
[2:14:10] 21.
[2:14:15] elijah came into all the people and said
[2:14:17] how long hawkey
[2:14:18] between two opinions can we just leave
[2:14:22] it there just for a second
[2:14:24] because we have people today halt it
[2:14:26] between opinions
[2:14:27] right yeah and and i don't have time to
[2:14:30] hit all of this but you know brother
[2:14:31] branham made some statement
[2:14:33] that uh you know spiritual amnesia
[2:14:35] happens to people
[2:14:37] and uh sometimes it happens through
[2:14:39] shock
[2:14:40] sometimes in a war you know maybe
[2:14:44] maybe shocked through the war or maybe
[2:14:46] some explosion something happened
[2:14:48] that shock can cause a person to go into
[2:14:51] amnesia
[2:14:52] right they forget who they are
[2:14:55] hallelujah
[2:14:56] they forget a man uh you know they just
[2:14:59] they just
[2:14:59] become very forgetful about a number of
[2:15:01] things spiritually you can forget who
[2:15:04] you are
[2:15:05] as a son of god as a daughter of god you
[2:15:06] can forget that because you've suffered
[2:15:09] amnesia your life experiences
[2:15:13] have caused you to go through spiritual
[2:15:16] amnesia
[2:15:18] brother adam said another way that
[2:15:19] people actually get amnesia it's not
[2:15:21] through
[2:15:22] just some shock or something like that
[2:15:24] in war he says but when they get
[2:15:26] halted between two opinions
[2:15:30] and what will happen that you listening
[2:15:31] to what this person's saying
[2:15:33] and then you're also listening to what
[2:15:35] that person's saying oh
[2:15:36] god i want to take y'all back to that
[2:15:39] dream
[2:15:40] amen that i shared with y'all when i
[2:15:41] preached the second junction
[2:15:43] the last dream i shared is that this
[2:15:45] brother was in a car
[2:15:47] hallelujah he said somebody else was
[2:15:50] driving
[2:15:51] can i go back to the dream somebody else
[2:15:53] would drive that means somebody else had
[2:15:55] control of your decisions
[2:15:58] somebody else had control of your life
[2:16:00] right
[2:16:01] somebody else was what was what was
[2:16:03] there so this brother was just sitting
[2:16:04] in the car
[2:16:05] and he saw a dark cloud coming dark
[2:16:08] cloud represent
[2:16:09] death hallelujah he said he said and as
[2:16:12] he noticed
[2:16:13] you know the cloud coming he said man
[2:16:15] you know i don't know what's going to
[2:16:16] happen he said he said
[2:16:17] but he said uh depending on the decision
[2:16:20] that we
[2:16:21] make at this junction it's going to it's
[2:16:23] going to determine
[2:16:25] whether we're going to die or whether
[2:16:27] we're going to live
[2:16:28] hallelujah he says but at the junction
[2:16:30] they made a turn
[2:16:32] no that's not what happened let me uh
[2:16:34] let me go back
[2:16:35] at the junction they stayed straight at
[2:16:38] the junction they stayed straight
[2:16:40] and said by them making the the uh the
[2:16:42] decision just to stay straight
[2:16:44] that allowed them to keep living
[2:16:48] they overcame the dark clouds now you
[2:16:51] know as i looked at that
[2:16:52] you know uh let me just read it here a
[2:16:54] brother and his family were in a car
[2:16:56] riding with someone else driving
[2:16:57] he noticed a black cloud ahead and
[2:16:59] realized had the driver made the turn
[2:17:02] the black cloud would have been right
[2:17:03] over the top of he and his family
[2:17:06] he stated the driver went forward rather
[2:17:08] than making a turn
[2:17:09] and this allowed them to steer clear of
[2:17:11] the storm
[2:17:12] now i said someone else is steering your
[2:17:15] decisions
[2:17:16] let me say another one and making a turn
[2:17:18] actually meant
[2:17:19] making a decision so if you made the
[2:17:22] wrong decision
[2:17:24] it would create spiritual death
[2:17:29] if you make the wrong decision it will
[2:17:32] create
[2:17:33] spiritual death some say well brother
[2:17:36] jack what decision should i make
[2:17:37] come talk to me let's see what we can do
[2:17:40] together
[2:17:42] amen i'ma tell you this
[2:17:45] when i give you some advice it's up to
[2:17:47] you to take it or not
[2:17:49] [Music]
[2:17:51] you can't you can't blame the doctor
[2:17:53] when you go to the doctor to get some
[2:17:54] medicine they say okay take this and
[2:17:56] you'll be well
[2:17:57] now if you go home and put the stuff on
[2:17:58] you i ain't taking no medicine and then
[2:18:00] you get sick and die
[2:18:01] don't blame the doctor
[2:18:06] don't blame the pastor when you fail to
[2:18:07] take heat so it comes out sometimes you
[2:18:10] just think i'm talking off the top of my
[2:18:11] head
[2:18:11] no i'm talking from experience
[2:18:15] all right amen this man
[2:18:18] suffered spiritual amnesia because he
[2:18:19] got i mean brother man say sometimes
[2:18:21] people get halted between two opinions
[2:18:23] and that's what i want to bring out here
[2:18:25] in this in this thought
[2:18:26] they got halted between two opinions
[2:18:28] which way should they go
[2:18:29] don't don't let the devil get you there
[2:18:31] i i made i i decided a long time ago i'm
[2:18:34] gonna follow jesus
[2:18:36] i'm gonna follow you no matter who come
[2:18:39] no matter who go i'm gonna follow jesus
[2:18:41] and you gotta get to the same spot in
[2:18:43] your life jesus
[2:18:45] first everything i said everything else
[2:18:50] second look at this
[2:18:54] the way that we get people out of spirit
[2:18:56] chimneys
[2:19:00] brother brandon say you got to bring
[2:19:01] them to familiar places again
[2:19:05] because uh you know when they get to
[2:19:06] spiritual amnesia and they just
[2:19:08] they're suffering just wondering the man
[2:19:10] man completely done
[2:19:11] he don't his identity is gone he don't
[2:19:14] know who he is
[2:19:15] the devil stole his identity he used to
[2:19:18] be a son of god
[2:19:19] i mean sometimes some of us are in that
[2:19:21] place right now we used to be the one
[2:19:23] encouraging everybody
[2:19:24] we used to be the ones strengthening
[2:19:26] everybody now we now we got to get the
[2:19:28] strength
[2:19:30] you understand because we're suffering
[2:19:32] from spiritual amnesia
[2:19:34] so mr brother adams say the way that you
[2:19:36] get the person out of it is that you
[2:19:38] just have to get them in familiar
[2:19:40] surroundings
[2:19:41] oftentimes when this is why some saints
[2:19:43] i'm gonna tell y'all
[2:19:44] some of the ones that them backslid you
[2:19:46] want to know why they won't come to
[2:19:48] church
[2:19:49] this amnesia will break in one service
[2:19:55] the anointing in a breakdown people have
[2:19:58] to
[2:19:59] run from church because they realize
[2:20:02] the power that is inside the church the
[2:20:05] amnesia will break
[2:20:07] amen the devil said keep them out that
[2:20:09] environment don't let them get in that
[2:20:10] environment don't whatever you do just
[2:20:11] stop
[2:20:12] don't let them go to church but once
[2:20:15] they get into the presence that that
[2:20:16] amnesia be in the breakdown oh
[2:20:18] i'm a son of god i'm a door to god this
[2:20:20] is where i belong i don't know how i let
[2:20:22] the devil get me into this situation
[2:20:24] brother brother brown said just get him
[2:20:26] in and familiar surroundings
[2:20:28] say there was a fella that he was he
[2:20:29] said he was in the war and
[2:20:31] they didn't know what to do with this
[2:20:32] felon said one day the fellow took off
[2:20:34] they stopped the train somewhere and
[2:20:36] gonna let him get out and walk that
[2:20:37] fella took off and started walking
[2:20:39] and one of the men saw him walking said
[2:20:41] not the man don't know where he at so he
[2:20:43] gonna
[2:20:44] he gonna hurt himself if he don't get
[2:20:45] back to this transit no no no let him go
[2:20:48] man stop looking around and saw a hill
[2:20:49] and he saw that and he saw this and
[2:20:51] the man something about this he said the
[2:20:52] guy just took off walking so so the
[2:20:54] fellas wouldn't just just you know the
[2:20:56] soldier that was watching him
[2:20:57] just follow him and as he walked up one
[2:20:59] hill and down another and up
[2:21:01] another and that's this guy guys seem to
[2:21:03] know where he's going and
[2:21:04] and before you know it the guy kept
[2:21:06] walking and and as he got
[2:21:07] as he kept walking his daddy was
[2:21:09] standing out on the porch
[2:21:12] glory hallelujah i want to i want to
[2:21:14] tell you where your dad is at
[2:21:17] your father in heaven is waiting for you
[2:21:20] glory to god and
[2:21:21] he said he said he said he said the
[2:21:22] daddy was standing on the porch say he
[2:21:24] says
[2:21:24] uh when he saw him suddenly say they
[2:21:26] told me you were dead but i didn't
[2:21:27] believe it son
[2:21:28] glory to god i've been waiting for you
[2:21:30] to come home all this time
[2:21:32] and that a boy shook out of his amnesia
[2:21:35] because he got himself in familiar
[2:21:38] surroundings
[2:21:38] he remembered not only his home he
[2:21:40] remembered his father
[2:21:42] he remembered everybody even though he
[2:21:44] was he was he was he was messed up in a
[2:21:46] war and sometimes we get
[2:21:48] messed up in the wars of life
[2:21:52] but god will break us free from that
[2:21:54] amnesia when we come into familiar
[2:21:56] surroundings
[2:22:01] [Music]
[2:22:02] elijah say to god an answer by fire let

[2:24:03] let me put water all over it
[2:24:05] all over the sacrament put water
[2:24:07] everywhere
[2:24:10] elijah stood there with a revelation
[2:24:13] yeah say god now i've done everything
[2:24:15] according to your word
[2:24:18] i've challenged them according to your
[2:24:19] word i'm trying to get rid of this sin
[2:24:21] that's in this nation i
[2:24:23] i can't stand seeing god
[2:24:26] i can't stand the fact that that jezebel
[2:24:28] done did this to the entire nation i
[2:24:30] can't stand it lord
[2:24:31] he said he said lord lord lord i then
[2:24:33] did everything at your word now
[2:24:35] god as you turn these people's hearts
[2:24:38] back to you
[2:24:39] let the fire fall and before your fire
[2:24:41] come from out of heaven
[2:24:43] destroyed the sacrifice that was there
[2:24:46] the people acknowledged that god
[2:24:49] was the god that answered by fire
[2:24:52] and after that elijah said you know
[2:24:54] we're not going to let this influence
[2:24:56] get out of monks y'all no more because
[2:24:58] you know some people can see the
[2:25:00] miraculous
[2:25:00] and they still don't change
[2:25:04] amen they're allowed to say bring them
[2:25:05] them false prophets
[2:25:07] i know what to do with them and elijah
[2:25:09] himself took 400 of them out by himself
[2:25:13] hallelujah he didn't need no help he was
[2:25:16] anointed
[2:25:18] but you know what he was not anointed to
[2:25:20] do
[2:25:22] deal with jezebel
[2:25:26] after all that he took off running
[2:25:36] i'ma tell you like i said it's about
[2:25:39] david and saul when saul was trying to
[2:25:42] kill david
[2:25:44] david never rose up to try to kill saul
[2:25:48] because here's the thing god put some
[2:25:50] souls in your life
[2:25:52] and you can't kill your souls your souls
[2:25:55] have to die on their own
[2:25:58] god did not allow the prophet to deal
[2:26:00] with jezebel she had to down
[2:26:02] he prophesied about it later on that the
[2:26:04] dog's gonna lick her blood
[2:26:05] but that was after he was off the scene
[2:26:10] be careful what you get yourself tied up
[2:26:11] to because you don't know how
[2:26:14] bad that thing will affect you years
[2:26:19] years years
[2:26:25] god help us let's pray

[2:26:35] this time of elijah and the
[2:26:39] 450 prophets and other 400 prophets lord
[2:26:44] he had to stand on the word you had to
[2:26:47] stay true
[2:26:50] lord you vindicated him
[2:26:53] and as you've indicated him lord we know
[2:26:55] you'll vindicate us
[2:26:57] help us lord to make the right decisions
[2:26:59] at the junction
[2:27:02] god these are tough decisions these are
[2:27:04] difficult decisions
[2:27:07] but the question is is it the right
[2:27:09] decision
[2:27:12] i know lord jesus that you'll put us in
[2:27:14] places where we have to
[2:27:16] decide on our own you you won't come
[2:27:18] supernaturally and do certain things we
[2:27:20] have to decide on all and it's after
[2:27:23] we obey that you manifest the
[2:27:26] supernatural it was after the woman
[2:27:29] gave lord her meal and

[2:27:38] performed in her life father i prayed it
[2:27:42] should help us to be obedient
[2:27:44] help us lord to have a church where sin
[2:27:46] can't hide
[2:27:49] help us oh god we we we don't want a
[2:27:51] church where sin can just come in here
[2:27:53] and feel comfortable
[2:27:55] lord that's not the church that we're
[2:27:57] running we won't we won't
[2:27:59] want people that are free in the spirit
[2:28:01] because they have repented
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:04] and he who the son sets free
[2:28:08] is free indeed
[2:28:12] father i pray that god you would uh
[2:28:16] you would deal with our hearts don't let
[2:28:17] it just be another word that we've heard
[2:28:19] but
