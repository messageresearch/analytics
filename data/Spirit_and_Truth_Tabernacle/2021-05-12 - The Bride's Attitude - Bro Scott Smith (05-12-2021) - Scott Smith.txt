chapter five and as i was just going through uh that chapter and just some of the the points that brother branham was bringing out one of the key things is just recognizing what the blood of jesus has actually done for us um sometimes i think we don't we don't reflect on it enough but uh he was just sharing how the blood actually restored everything that adam lost has been giving back to us since jesus died on the cross and uh sometimes we we fall short of uh what god has for us amen and you know his plans that he has for us but uh sometimes just just reflecting and just thinking about what the blood has done you don't have to accept anything that the devil just gives you a man i was reading a quote brother random say adam didn't have to be sick i didn't have to be tired adam didn't have to go to funeral services adam didn't have to you know i mean you just name about all the negative things that we go through all the stress that adam didn't have stress right you just think about that but that's what the blood came to take us back to to that place where we don't adam didn't have no worries i don't worry about how the bills was going to get paid you just think about it church that that that was not adam's condition and and as the the bride of jesus christ he has restored us back to this place amen that adam lost so amen i'm determined to walk in that amen i'm determined to walk in there praise the lord just a couple announcements that we'll make mention of amen and um we will prepare to receive our precious brother scott some of you all may know brother sherman he's come to visit us i think once or twice and for he comes down for virginia and he often comes to the meetings there in uh saint augustine i mean every year you see brother sherman there and uh but brother sherman um called me up on yesterday says um brother jack said y'all having service on tomorrow night i said yes we have in service and i thought he was gonna surprise him and say i'll be there and uh he say uh well uh brother scott the one i've been telling you about he said he's he's in florida see is he and i say he's on vacation in florida i say okay and he said he's in um um uh uh orlando area and he's looking for a place to go home wednesday and i say okay he can come and be with us and uh he would just tell him to say well y'all to be blessed i said well we'll be looking forward to it and sometimes god just know how to give you just what you need when you need it so amen i believe god got something special in store for us tonight amen uh don't forget we'll be having service on sunday amen 10 30 a.m and and we'll continue our streaming through both twitter uh and facebook uh so keep that in mind and also uh we have a combined services for all the churches in this area we have not been able to do that since the outbreak of covet and um and and this would be the first time that we are coming back together and what we're what we're trying to do amen in all honesty churches uh i don't know about you but i've been missing having meetings i've been i've been missing that just having meetings you know with with the other believers and i believe there's a lot of other snakes been feeling the same way just missing that that meeting atmosphere uh it's one thing when we come together but it's a whole nother thing when everybody come together and uh so what we you know we were just trying to pray over some things and i was talking with brother westchester you know what would be good is that less you know rather than try to have a big meeting because every time i go to south carolina everybody saying when y'all gonna do something in florida when y'all gonna do something i don't know i don't know uh but uh but you know there's some things in the works and we'll let you know about it but i said before we do that maybe we should just have a meeting just amongst ourselves and let's just see how it all works out you know just do a couple of those amongst ourselves let's see how it all works out and i know that you know i i i made mention to the pastors i said you're going to have some saints that's going to feel comfortable with mass some that don't want i mean feel comfortable without the mask i say it's quite all right let everybody come as they as they feel right we're not putting no mandates on anybody just everybody come as they feel but we just want to be able to get together again praise the lord that is our that's our desire so uh this will be our first time may 30th to be our first time to be held at brother gene's church and uh we're just looking forward to what god has in store amen for that meeting and following that will be our anc uh uh uh i was gonna say annual i might as well say that but our church picnic is gonna be held the next day

looking for just more of the lord let's take our bibles if we can tonight and turn to the book of revelation chapter 22 revelation chapter 22 just a real familiar place and just have a little thought a little simple thought on my heart tonight and trust that we'll be able to say something that would help you revelation chapter 22. i'm gonna read just one verse tonight that would be verse number 17. verse 17. have that maybe just say amen amen revelation 22 and 17 could we just bow our hearts tonight and speak to the lord father all god so lord good to be in your presence tonight lord just uh to fellowship to hear the lord the singing and lord just uh feel just a welcome spirit here tonight lord we would pray as we've come it's midweek and lord no doubt the people are lord they've worked and they've done their different activities and things lord but today tonight we've set this time aside lord to come to your house and together lord we're just asking tonight for a special blessing lord we're asking god it's not beyond your measure but we're asking that you'd speak to every heart here tonight lord lord if there would be a need i'm asking god that you would just lord just minister to that one tonight lord if there'd be a physical healing that's needed god a lord a spiritual healing a mental healing god lord we're calling on the one that can make a difference lord and we're just asking you to have your way speak to our hearts lord just bring us closer to you we pray we ask it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen revelation 22 and 17 how many is thankful for the the word denied and the the revelation of god and just his word in this hour we can never underestimate revelation and the power of revelation i told the church just recently back home i said you know revelation in in my terms revelation is is is getting uh the the original mind of god uh out of the word and in other words when god when god placed that word here in in the bible the original intent and the original purpose and meaning amen revelation brings that out amen and it so it's it's a powerful thing you you actually see uh the original intent that god had in placing that there amen revelation brings that out to us amen revelation 22 and 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely amen may god add his blessings you can be seated tonight i want to speak to you just for a few minutes this evening if we could from this verse 17 and i want uh if we would title it tonight i wanna title this uh the bride's attitude or the attitude of the bride can somebody say amen you know when you think of attitude it's it's a powerful thing even naturally when you look at attitude how how that it affects so many aspects of our life of course it'll make an employee a better employee it'll make a boss a better boss are you with me it it helps attitude it's proven scientifically medically that uh attitude is a difference maker you know i've heard it said that when things are equal the person with the best attitude will win when all other things are equal the person with the best attitude will win i've always heard it said that other things not being equal the person with the best attitude still usually wins amen in other words it it it gives an advantage are you with me uh it it will it it it is always right to have the right attitude amen and it's never right to have the wrong attitude are you with me and and so you you see all of these things and we could deal with a number of things naturally uh how even down to the health how a negative attitude how it how it tears the body down uh medically speak and it weakens the body and you know not not long ago i was looking i had some blood work done and one of the counts on it was um was a little bit off and i and and i began to look to see what could could could bring that that number down or that that certain count down and and i started looking at just pressure and and uh and and and anxiety and and you know and all of all of those things how that that that plays a part in your body your body knows that's going on and it and it responds and it begins to weaken certain things and how that you know a bad attitude begins to tear down and it begins to weaken things uh and and medically it's not good and and so we could look at you know a number of those things and we'll just we'll just move from uh you know that natural with saying this again it's never it's never good it's never healthy to have a bad attitude amen naturally it's it's it's good to have a good attitude are you with me now now when you look and you take the prophet of god and all the things that you know when that was revealed uh about attitude and and and how he ministered on you know our attitude and how it determines the outcome and so many things and how you know how he would tell us that in one place he says it this way he said no one ever come to christ in the right attitude but what went away with what they asked for no one now think about no one he says no one you'll not find one person in the scripture that ever came to god ever came to christ it with the right attitude that ever went away without what they had need of not one it's a powerful thing amen brother branham says of course the right and mental attitude toward any divine promise of god we'll bring it to pass amen so the attitude toward the word our attitude toward the word as the word is coming forth amen often determines what will happen amen in any given service amen at any given time amen he he taught us amen when you when you study all of you know of what the prophet said about attitude he he taught us that our attitude toward one another is actually our attitude toward god you know now some people you see they they they have a sorry attitude but they play spiritual but let me let me let me let me tell you something tonight amen according to the prophet of god our attitude toward others is our attitude toward god it's not a switch that we turn on and off amen there's not we're not a double-minded people amen we really don't have a double attitude tonight amen we've got one single attitude and that attitude determines aiming the outcome of most things that take place amen so our attitude toward one another he would even bring it down your attitude towards your spouse oh can i get a witness tonight amen is your attitude toward cr amen toward christ amen our attitude one to one another see is our real attitude i remember years ago even we had a we had a you know a sister that she had a a little gift in her life and could play music and things and and and you know could have could have been a real blessing but she had a she just had a real lousy attitude and and and so she she you know when she played she wanted all everybody to you know to listen to her and when she would sing everybody here and and and but what what happened people began to she began to lose you know influence and people's confidence in her was lowered because outside of the piano and outside of that gift she had a had just a poor attitude and and and so the people they came to me and said well you know why why is uh she asking why are the people not receiving me i said well you you got to understand something they they recognize that attitude you won't hardly speak to nobody when this church service is over you just ignore the other sisters come on oh my you just go on you've got some and then you want to play spiritual and act spiritual and have somebody to receive that amen but listen listen saints of god and i told her i said it don't work that way i said your attitude will will repel people that attitude listen the bride's attitude is an attraction oh listen the spirit and the bride say come see there is a drawing power there's a drawing attitude inside this bride and she draws people to him she's not looking to put people away amen there's a draw with this bride there's life in this bride there's a pool with this bride she's not repelling amen her attitude is not pushing people away she's drawing them to christ she's pulling them to the lord oh we're seeing one of the final moves of the bride in revelation 22 and she's got a spirit on her that says come she's got a spirit that's amen that's becoming to something that is desired oh not just all not pushing oh i don't want to i don't want a spirit that repels people i don't want to spear i don't want to be that god all they don't want to talk to amen that one that they can't have a conversation with but i want to i want a spirit that would attract amen somebody to the lord amen that when you get done talking to them they want more of the lord not more of you amen but they desire they want more of the lord amen they see something in you amen an attitude amen of godliness see oh are you with me oh we're talking about a real attitude amen a right attitude the prophet of god told us that right attitude that right approach it'll move god it'll move him every time oh hallelujah i'm thinking of that sir phoenician woman how she came to christ remember now her approach was a little off at first when she called on him she called on him as son of david but as a seraphination woman she had no claims on him as son of david is that right amen she come to as a gentile she had no claims that way amen her approach is wrong she's coming now now deep down in she's right let's let's let's put it where it is deep down in we find out in the heart of hearts thank you brother you know in the heart of hearts we know that this sister is really right but i want you i want you to notice amen the wrong approach it didn't matter how right she was in it we could say in her seed life amen or the deepest part of her amen when she come with the wrong approach the bible said he didn't answer her brother amen never answered her a word she come oh son of david see she had no claims on him that way it didn't matter what hey come on amen you got you got no claims on him that way and remember the disciples began to say send her away she's troubling us and amen and finally remember amen she called on him and she said lord lord oh have mercy come on lord amen at that moment amen that approach was different amen and she got an immediate response from him amen because now her approach was aligned amen with who she really is listen bride i tell you he'll never deal with you outside of the capacity of who you really are amen you can't come to him as something else amen if you're a believer you come to him as a believer amen if you're the bride you come to him as a bride amen otherwise he'll stay silent oh but i'll tell you when we find that channel amen we find that approach amen and we come amen as who we are i'm telling you he's there to answer that need oh she come all right when she said lord he said oh my see see she now she was now coming with the right approach lord see you see these people today they're gentiles they want to act all jewish and you know and and do all listen if you're a gentile you got to come to him that way are you with me if you're a believer you've got to come to him that way if you come to him posing as an unbeliever you're probably not going to get far with him he may know deep down he knows all things he knows deep down in but you've got to come to him in the capacity that he's called you to and listen as the bride of jesus christ amen there's a capacity that we're in tonight a capacity that you've been called to amen and your approach to him comes that way amen and that's where help comes from [Music] oh my listen see we're living in an hour it's prophetic amen of another attitude there's an attitude on the on the overall population of the world second timothy chapter three paul would tell us about it he would say it this way i had it he would say it this way in 2 timothy chapter 3 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy now paul is showing you the attitude of the end time he's showing you the attitude of the general population now this is not just a a spirit on a small minority of people amen but this is the description of the of the of the last day population there's more of them with this than there are without it in other words this this is the attitudes that you come in contact with every day every day at work every day at school everywhere you go this is the attitude that we're dealing with hey man he would say though they would have a they would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now he would tell us that this is this is the mannerism of the last day now you see this is where we got to be careful because it's so easy when you're around that all day and all that negativity and all of all of those things he described if you're not careful when you're around it so much you'll start acting like that i mean you'll pick that up and that negativity up and and down up and and the mannerism of the nation can you say amen amen the manner you know listen over in leviticus amen god was talking amen there in leviticus 20 and he told the people i mean the conditions of the day and what they were doing in their lifestyles and their and and their marriages and such he told them this he said and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation leviticus 20 23 he said which i cast out before you for they committed all these things and therefore i abhorred them now when you look at the verse before that he actually tells them in verse 22 that he spewed them out they were used as that word spew i mean you'll find that he uses that in leviticus 20 uses it i believe over leviticus 18. in in this in this manner he only uses it in this manner in one other place and that's revelation 3 amen over into laodicea where they're again a people that have the mannerism of the nation and not the mannerism of god amen they've got the attitude of laodicea and not the lay and not the attitude of god amen they've got a laodicean attitude instead of a bride attitude oh but i'm telling you we're going to get we're going to get an attitude adjustment tonight amen god's going to help us tonight amen we're going to cast that other thing out amen amen god said i'll spew that out see this brother brown taught every every nation had spirits and they were controlled all even our precious america is controlled by by spirit and and the media see the media pulls the people amen in a design direction in a desired direction are you with me to promote whatever they want to promote and and you get caught up in that and before long you got some old mannerism of the united states but i'm telling you we don't need the mannerism of the united states we need the mannerism of another kingdom amen it is the kingdom of god and come on it is a bride kingdom it is a kingdom of belief listen that other kingdom there's nothing but doubt there's nothing but death there's nothing but sickness amen but we are amen pulling from another kingdom tonight and our attitude is reflecting that amen oh hallelujah see it used to be that the church influenced the nation now there's more national influence on the church and the nation has influenced the church they take on the same mindset and a lot of things get caught up in some of the same old foolishness amen driven a direct opposite of the way that it should be it should be this church penetrating that world penetrating that system penetrating the nation but it's the other way around 100 years ago was a little different are you with me amen but we are we are of another kingdom amen there's a there's a mannerism i'm thinking of the king son amen how i sold into slavery sold and sold into bondage amen and but you know what this man never let that out of the prophet of god said never did did he take on the attitude of those other people do you know why he knew amen there was nothing they could do to change who he really was amen he was a king son i may be surrounded by all kinds of craziness but i'm a king son i might be surrounded by all kinds of negativity but i'm a king son amen and nothing could change that amen nothing could change who he was amen in his attitude amen reflected that amen everybody else just took on just that mindset well it's not going to get any better [Laughter] it's just always going to be this way oh my i'm always going to have this problem i'm just i'm just gonna have to learn to live with it oh my i think we need to learn to live without it i think we need a different attitude i think we need an attitude i heard pastor talking about it early amen the blood of jesus christ has made a way it cleanseth us from all unrighteousness amen it purchased our healing amen it purchased our peace of mind amen it purchased our sanity in this hour amen i can't help but to walk with a positive attitude oh hallelujah oh purchasing power tonight you have been purchased purchased by the blood of jesus christ that's powerful when you think about it when you think of that that that power of the purchase that he made oh he purchased you do you know what that is i went to i went to the store the other day and i bought a new suit now when i did that i looked and i found one that i liked and i took that suit up to the counter it had a price tag on it and i took it to the counter and i pulled my wallet out now what i was testifying when them hundred dollar bills started changing hands and it went from me to that person working there i was testifying that suit means more to me than those bills in my pocket i i oh my i was testifying that that money in my pocket that that means more to me than the money in my pocket in other words that two or three hundred dollars whatever it was amen that suit meant more to me than that did i purchased it now when christ purchased you oh hallelujah think about that amen when he purchased you he was saying what i'm giving amen what i'm getting in return means more than what i'm giving he give his life to get your life amen he was testifying that means more to me than my own life oh we're talking purchase and power of an almighty god oh that he purchased you oh he paid amen the scripture said we were bought with a price therefore glorify god in our body and our spirit which are the lords oh my see it's it oh it's it's i can't i can't i can't keep a bad attitude amen i've been bought with a price somebody even found me worthy amen to pay such a price amen to give that amen that i could come here not to live some life in the mully grubs oh i just don't know all i want to tell you tonight he's made a way oh my i'm telling you he's made a way he has purchased amen whatever you have need of amen a prophet of god said we got purchase and power amen your faith you got purchase and power tonight whatever you have need of you can have that tonight amen god has made a way oh hallelujah oh god oh what a what a mighty god oh mercy oh how many say god help my attitude tonight oh help me to look on that word a little different help me to look in the mirror a little different help me to look at god a little different tonight see there's always room to go a little higher there's all this is the call of the hour come up higher little bride amen there's always i don't care where we are amen tonight amen there's a call to come up a little higher amen god is calling us in this area now come up a little higher see over in isaiah the book of isaiah you'll find isaiah was a prophet right out of chapter one he's prophesying he's he's doing the things a prophet does is that right he's going through the scripture you have been going through you go through the book of isaiah and he's he's a prophet he's prophesying he's he's doing all the things a prophet would do you get to you get to chapter five of isaiah and he goes through the six woes of upon israel what was this what was this are you with me what was this but in in in isaiah chapter 6 something happens now always was a prophet the whole time through five chapters is that right didn't change who he was but in isaiah chapter 6 something happened there there was an attitude adjustment that took place amen isaiah was brought up a little higher he said i saw the lord high and lifted up now i want you to notice this he goes from the from the from the six woes of israel and woe is everything else woe is everybody else woe is this woe is this amen to woe is me oh hallelujah come on amen show amen showing amen no not amen not woe is everything else amen but it was turned listen

and i said well how did you treat them i said because let me tell you something as a believer here here's something listen to this i said god's not concerned so much about how they treated you it's how you responded see i said because god may not be working on them at all but you're he is and he's working on you and so so it's not somebody said why aren't you gonna do nothing i said i'm not gonna do a thing just went through a situation ever i wanted it it just it just ain't in my flesh to just just just say nothing all the time i just i wasn't brought up that way and but but i just recently went through something every which way i turned amen the lord was just saying i got this just just in other words just just be quiet don't fight back don't do nothing don't do don't you know and i just came they were saying oh but they're saying this and they're saying this and they're saying that and i said but but but god but until i finally told her i said the lord's just dealt with me to th that he's got he's taking care of it he's working this out and i said he's looking at my attitude he's looking at he's looking at how i respond i don't know if he'll deal with them i pray that he does but i know he's dealing with me and if i've got anything in me that's going to display a bad attitude then he's got to get that out of me see we find out that it comes down to see it's it's you and god it's you and god paul paul had had a thorn in the flesh he said i saw the lord three times thrice that the lord might deliver him and finally the lord the lord dealt with him and told paul he said paul my grace is sufficient is that right for in in weakness there's strength and and so paul you'll notice something here he never mentions that thorn again you never hear him talk about it again he because he come to terms that this is not this is not about me and the devil this is not about this is not about this is about me and god this is about god dealing with me god is using this to deal with me come on help me don't sit down on me amen and paul said well praise god all glory in the infirmity and he realized it's not a fight with me and the devil see see he wanted to know how should i how should i continue should i keep resisting the devil and fine he let him know paul this ain't about the devil come on see when it gets to are you with me abraham and isaac when when god told him to take his only son it really wasn't about isaac it was about god and abraham abraham what are you going to do see are you going to follow me it wasn't it wasn't about isaac at all listen esau and jacob it wasn't really about east hall at all remember amen jacob had met the angel of the lord wrestled with him all night you remember that wrestles with that wrestles with him and finally

his bride is that right you think about his attitude toward us it never changes [Music] good thoughts he has for you the bible says daily he loadeth us with blessings come on he never cops an attitude with us he's told us in this age that you never did it in the first place so oh come on see his attitude is unchanging we talked about the purchase and power amen purchased us baldus won't lose the one one might get marred up somewhere along the way one might one might go through a uh uh a a little a little dirtier path but i'm here to tell you amen at the end of the day amen he loses not one

over to the hotel today and right when i i looked at him i looked at his shirt i said ben me and him more more like than we're not i said he's he's running around working and well i'm an insurance agent brother no kidding i've got two full-time jobs and work plenty overtime in both of them i'm a pastor and i'm an insurance agent now if you were in north carolina today you'd probably seen a progressive shirt on me we're like superman though wednesday at five o'clock we run out of there progressive goes off ty shirt comes on ty comes home different man oh mercy see some congregations they have no excuses like that see i tell mine on wednesday night i work too but you know i'm an insurance agent and we see you know all kinds of things and we don't work the claim side but i don't but we we we help our clients you know manage claims and file claims well i've got a particular client had her and her husband for a number of years very nice people wealthy somewhat wealthy back in our area but just just a great spirit on on this couple well the man the husband they're up you know in their 60s he got sick and and it was terminal and he he took it he didn't want to do it for some time but he took a he took several pieces of jewelry uh rings did different things that he had and he wanted to make his wife a a certain a certain ring comprised of of several things i guess that he'd gotten her over the years and he took it to a a jeweler in town and so he they made the ring he was able to give it to her before he passed away and this ring was a six i don't know 65 or 70 000 ring and so no cheap ring and so she called me and and once she got the ring and she said well i need i need this thing insured i don't want to um you know just just have regular insurance that won't pay but a couple thousand dollars on jewelry and i said well sure no problem i told her what to do you know we had to have a an appraisal that was within just a month or two and and those kind of things and some photos and and things real simple process and we got it and we insured the ring she said it's she said there's no price uh you know that that could replace it she said it's it's so special and she was telling me the background of it and what he did and of course then he passed away and so we insured that ring well several months later literally just several months later it can always happen in the in the insurance business but several months later i get a phone call and it's it's it's gail and she said scott she said i could tell her in a voice that she was uh he's broken in her voice she said i've i i need help she said i've i've had i've got a problem and i said what and she said the ring she said the ring jim bought me that we just insured she said it's gone and i said what do you mean it's gone and and she had a safe and things there to house and she said it's gone she said i have turned the place she said actually happened i don't know a week or so back and said i've just been waiting i've been hunting and searching i've had my my children over searching and we were looking everywhere and she said it's nowhere to be found she said i filed a police report she said but i need to file a claim i don't know what else to do um it's gone and and and so i'm gonna have to turn this in and so i said okay i understand and so we filed out filled out the paperwork and we filed a claim on this and this of course this type of policy um there there's no deductible the premium she pays kind of covers that and so they're they're on it they're gonna have to just cut a check for this after they do their their little investigation and so she's heartbroken and and and so i was talking to her and i said well you know has anybody been in your home and she said well she said you know honestly she said no but i said i had a couple contractors over she said i was doing some landscaping out outside and there was some wiring and lights that needed to be done and they had to bring in an electrician and so we had the landscaper and the electrician there and she said but they were outside the whole time she said the only time anybody come in my house she said was one of the electrician guys came into the house and said i took him right to a little panel box she said it was right in front of the house she said my bedroom is she's got a sprawling house her that she said my bedroom of course is at the at the very back of the house said that said this man never went past the front the front door the front room where that panel box was and i said wow and so anyway we filed the claim and they're they're processing it and in about a week or so passes by and she uh maybe two weeks and they're right at the point of their cutting the check and and gonna have to send the money for this ring and she called she called me back and this time her voice was different she was happy she was just just just you could tell joe i didn't i didn't know what had happened but i could tell that this was a different person that i was talking to she said she said you are not going to believe this and i said well try me i said try to what tell me i can't wait tell me what's you know what's going on she said you will not believe this she said you could not make this up and i said what tell me tell me and she said my ring she said i'm sitting here with it right now i said you're kidding she said oh no she's she's crying tears of joy she said i got that back she said there's no money she said there is no money that could have ever replaced that she said i got my ring back she said let me tell you the story she said i told you that one person come in that house let me tell you something it doesn't take the devil much doesn't take much just just a little room but she said that electrician she said that come into my house that i took right just to the just to the front panel she said i want you to know what happened she said i got a call she said and what happened was she said that electrician got in that got come in there to that panel and he'd come in there one more time without me knowing and just just the mind of a thief i guess went straight back to her bedroom just so happens the ring is laying on the or i'm going somewhere just stay with me the ring was laying on the dresser he snatched that ring went out of there several days before she noticed it but he took that ring now i want you to watch how she got it back he waited several days had that ring and he went he he he was he he tried to figure out where he could get the full value for it you'll never guess where he ended up he went right back or right to the jeweler that had designed the ring that had made the ring and so are you with me when he came in with the ring he comes in and he tells the he tells the jeweler the main man there that owns the place he said i've got a ring we've fallen on hard times and he said my wife we're willing to give it up and said i've brought this and i want to see what my top dollar would be on it well when he handed it to the man he didn't take but one look he looked at it and he said well that's that's a nice one he said boy you got a nice one he said he said i tell you what that's a that's one more piece of jewelry he said let me step right back here to the back he said and let me look at a few things he said i feel like you're going to get more than you ever imagined he said he said that guy's eyes were open he said he's smiling he said you think he said i think you're going to get a lot more than you thought you were going to get 4. he said this is a real piece of jewelry and he slipped right back there hey man he picked up the phone and he called gail he said gail he said are you missing something by any chance she said what in the world would make you ask he said well i'm sitting here holding and begin and she began to cry she began to just cry and she said that's my she he said oh i know what he is i'm the one who made it he said there's a guy in here and he told him he said i'll take care of it he said you come down here in about a half an hour and i got your ring hey man he picked up the next phone call he made was called the local police department he said so he goes back out there and he wastes just another minute he goes back out there with a smile on his face and he tells the man he says man you you know this is payday you're good you know he said this guy he's just he's all excited and he said what do you think you know what do you think i'm gonna get he said right there's what you're gonna get and about that time four police officers walked in and they already had already told them the story and they handcuffed that man and they took him out of there now i want you to think of this amen now the devil thought he was doing something amen he slipped in there amen he got something that was very valuable he got something that was very that it wasn't his to begin with it was not his to begin with amen and he took that thing amen and he went out but i want you to notice he couldn't help it was just divine he could not help amen he brought it right back amen to the one that designed it he brought it right back to the one that made it come somebody say man oh i like i like this part even better amen when she went to pick that ring up she said oh god she says she said i she said it's never been the monetary value of it she said but hasn't lost any value now that it's been in his hands he said oh no he said it ain't no matter of fact i just reappraised that it's gone up in value a little bit oh somebody help me i tell you what the devil thinks he got something over on him amen but with a real purchased child of god he can only bring him right back amen to the one that made him oh hallelujah i tell you what you're more precious than gold little bride amen you're more precious than gold god ain't lost the one amen it'll come right back to him in the name of the lord hallelujah it might have went through that old devil's hand he might have put his hand on something amen that wasn't his but i tell you what it's coming back it's coming back in the name of the lord it's coming back to its rightful owner and it ain't lost no value it's lost no value oh hallelujah [Music] oh hallelujah [Applause] oh my goodness oh i could take off in another language i'm telling you hey man it ain't lost no value tonight [Music] oh she said it means more to me now you know what she said she said they'll never get a chance to do that again [Laughter] oh that old devil will never get that chance again [Laughter] oh mercy i'm telling you oh i'm thinking of a little woman one time caught in the very act of adultery they thought they were they were going to take her they were going to get her judged they were going to set the lord up at the same time they come to him throw her down begin to say what would moses do oh come on they thought they were setting him up but he was setting her up come on they thought they were setting the lord up but he was setting her up and they brought her right back to the place that they thought she would be condemned they brought her to the very one i remember what he told them he said you that have that that have not seen cast the first tone and the bible says their own conscience amen their conscience begin to begin to condemn them and convict them amen and by the elder to the younger they begin to walk and to begin to leave and they left her there with the only one qualified to throw a stone and he didn't the only one qualified at that point to judge her and he said i find no fault he said i neither even go and sin no more come on amen they thought oh hallelujah they thought amen they were going to set him up amen but he was just using that amen to bring her right back to the place that she belonged oh purchase little bride oh god how can we not want to serve him how can we not want to give him our all he would never let those pharisees change his attitude he would never let them change his position the whole church pointing and saying it should be one way and he stood right he would not allow the influence of anything to change his direction oh what a god what a god a god the epitome of a perfect attitude everything he displayed everything he manifested how about it bride now we're not talking about the attitude of the world and we're not talking about the attitude of the denominational church but we're talking about the attitude of a real genuine believer tonight it should be an inviting one it should be one all that just draws it's an attraction you ever seen those people maybe even in it maybe in just a workplace they may not even be believe they just have they just have an attitude and i'm not talking about something uh just just fleshly or sensual but they haven't they have an attitude that draws you you you hey i want to be around them they they they make me better right you know you know the old saying if that if you want to succeed surround yourself with successful people now an attitude of a believer that other people want to draw from that other people felt almost magnetized to not a not a starchy formal standoffish or a mannerism of this age or nation but just genuine believers just the bride of jesus christ how many thankful you've been purchased tonight how many is thankful for christ tonight oh he did it for you he did it for you see the devil thought he had one but god said no i made them i made them i ordained them i planned this for them can we stand

nearer oh near our blessed lord to thy [Music] let's give the lord a hand of praise i'll tell you um certainly it was worth pressing our way out to the house of the lord tonight and i believe we all leave here just a little drawing a heartstring a little closer to the lord jesus the attitude of the bride and this is one that we certainly want to go back and listen to uh you know as much as we can and and i'm just grateful that a precious brother scott just saw fit to take time from his vacation drive two and a half hours down here to minister the word of the lord to us and the this is what i call a life-changing sermon all right a life-changing sermon you know thinking about some of the things that we talked about on on sunday as far as you know i was reading a quote where brother randall was talking about you know you just have to be who god made you and i was saying no that some there's some things in us that we know we gotta work on and the word has a way of just working these things out so he comes right back and just kind of connects that and uh and and i am i'm taking that first corinthians 7 14. taking that one with me your your righteousness is greater than their unrighteousness your holiness is greater than their unholiness no matter what you see what you fail to see is who you are right and as as he was just kind of going through that there's a couple situations that came uh to mine there and you all remember brother branham talking about uh the the drunks that was in the bar and talking about uh who uh who was a real christian who wasn't and the one man said my wife is a real christian her righteousness was greater than their unrighteousness her holiness was great in their unholy limbs because the end of the stories that they got saved not she backslid right hallelujah i think about hattie wright her righteousness was greater than her son's unrighteousness both boys right and by her requesting the salvation of those boys she got exactly what she asked for uh church we got to recognize who we are amen your god is greater your god is stronger your god is more powerful than any other and your god lives on the inside of you so that was a blessing to my soul tonight i i am grateful that i came to church and and and that testimony of uh the the the the stolen jewelry there mine that that's gonna be one that we're gonna hold on to that was powerful you know god just knows how to do things um he's an awesome god he's a right god and and what you need to do is just have the right attitude when you're serving him he's got everything under control amen let's pray church let's pray amen how we just appreciate the lord tonight father we are certainly grateful for what we have heard here god in this place thank you for using your servant help helping him get himself out of the way that he could just bring the word of truth word of encouragement a word of strength lord to the believers here and god we uh we leave here with our attitudes adjusted absolutely adjusted by the holy ghost lord realizing that no matter what it is that we're facing in our homes god that our righteousness is actually greater than all the unrighteousness that we see around us and it's our righteousness righteousness that will cause those things to come under subjection so lord help us to just rise up and be who we are and you and lord may we walk in this and realize that the attitude of the bride is the bride is we are people that are inviting uh we are people that are open god we are a people or that that say come the spirit and the bride says come he has to thirst let him come god and father we want to have the right attitude to be able to invite others to come into your presence lord that they want to follow us to church lord that when they get when they see us out in the streets see us on the job see us in school see us wherever god that they'll know that these are genuine christians these are people that are real father help us to be like that lord don't let it just be a sermon that went in one ear and out the other lord and caused us to rejoice a little bit but lord let it be applied to our lives and god that we would we would see where the spirit is dealing with us in certain areas and be willing to yield those areas to you god father we commit ourselves to you lord even at this moment pray that you bless especially lord uh brother scott lord and god is family that you would just restore and give back to them lord all that has been given to to come to this place tonight lord and just ask that you just remember every need that they would have oh god and bless them abundantly fathers our prayer it's in jesus name we pray amen amen let's give the lord another hand of praise praise the lord hallelujah

a limb and now you ain't going to be able to get back to church but try to find something right in the church i was right near the church i was telling a brother uh years ago there was a scripture that came to me deuteronomy 28 i believe i was reading and the bible says i would be blessed in the city blessed in the field blessed coming out blessed going in you know and i started reading that and then it just kind of struck me the lord said i'll be blessed in my city what that meant to me is that i didn't have to leave my city to get blessed i can be blessed in my city [Music] and if the devil telling you that you have to leave here to get blessed tell the devil hear a liar the bible says i'll be blessed in this city i don't care how expensive it is to live here i'ma still be blessed

they put a lighthouse they brought it from out of nowhere he saw this thing he was taking a trip to go preach and he said where that lighthouse come from he say that's the lighthouse gave him inspiration it's going to be lighthouse of lenoir of the the name of the church and he just just took that by inspiration they called it that's what they called it and a few years later a minister passed through that was coming from uh i guess he spoke french and i think he was overseas and he spoke french and he says lighthouse illinois he said that's pretty amazing he says because in french lenoir means darkness that's what lenore means but this is the lighthouse of darkness in the midst of darknesses light is still shining i said well god know how to do things so we just appreciate the lord god bless you church amen we'll dismiss the brothers will come at this time god bless you [Music] so [Music] you
