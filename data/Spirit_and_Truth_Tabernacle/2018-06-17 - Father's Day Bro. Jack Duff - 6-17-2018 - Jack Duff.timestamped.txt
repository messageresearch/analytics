[1:06:55] is good to come to church and feel like
[1:06:57] you went to church a man's a we
[1:07:00] certainly thank God for for this I am I
[1:07:06] you know his father's day and sometimes
[1:07:08] I try to be traditional sometimes you
[1:07:11] know I'm not and today I just kind of
[1:07:14] have a thought that's in between a man
[1:07:17] traditional and non-traditional so you
[1:07:18] all just bear with me I believe is what
[1:07:21] the Lord want us to just share you know
[1:07:24] the the while we were there in Israel
[1:07:32] and this happened to me the first time I
[1:07:34] went you know when you when your way as
[1:07:38] a the reason I went the first time by
[1:07:41] myself is because the brother that
[1:07:46] brother George II say brother Jack as a
[1:07:48] pastor you really won't enjoy the trip
[1:07:52] when when when the sheep come because
[1:07:55] you're just gonna be worried about the
[1:07:56] Sheep you know all the time you say what
[1:07:59] you need to do is go by yourself so you
[1:08:00] don't worry about the Sheep and you know
[1:08:03] and I'm like okay that makes sense and
[1:08:05] you know and he's right you know you're
[1:08:07] just wandering you know you got to look
[1:08:09] at everything things be happening happen
[1:08:11] it fast you know and I mean you know and
[1:08:14] and and not like you know cuz people you
[1:08:17] can't believe everything you hear on the
[1:08:19] loose right and you know ain't nobody
[1:08:21] getting shot in the streets and all that
[1:08:23] but for will you know take your wallet
[1:08:25] if you ain't watching but that's not
[1:08:28] just in Israel a man that that's
[1:08:30] everywhere you go right right you got
[1:08:32] you got to be watchful and when you're
[1:08:34] when you're you're responsible
[1:08:37] responsible for a group of people you
[1:08:38] can help but you don't just always keep
[1:08:41] your eyes open and things of that nature
[1:08:43] but even you know even spiritually while
[1:08:46] I'm away a man and things that make sure
[1:08:49] I'm constantly thinking about the church
[1:08:51] right I'm constantly thinking about the
[1:08:53] Saints when when you know I see brother
[1:08:57] Caleb put those will post out there and
[1:08:59] I'm just kind of following say okay who
[1:09:00] here who not here yeah i watch
[1:09:02] everything right come on now I'm a
[1:09:04] pastor when it's women what happened you
[1:09:10] don't understand what that do to me you
[1:09:12] understand I mean that that's why it's
[1:09:14] important for me to tell y'all you know
[1:09:16] I went if I'm not here if I just showed
[1:09:18] up y'all came to church one day not just
[1:09:20] wasn't here and I ain't tell y'all that
[1:09:22] I wasn't going to be here yeah I have
[1:09:24] questions and if you if not questions
[1:09:26] are concerned right you'd be hopefully
[1:09:29] yeah but when a pastor he all right
[1:09:31] I hope you all ask that question all
[1:09:34] right but that's the way I'm them with
[1:09:36] y'all if I don't know
[1:09:37] amen and not that I'm trying to be all
[1:09:39] in your business but you know I just
[1:09:41] sometimes you know lower everything
[1:09:44] everybody all right so when I come out
[1:09:46] and I just down around okay everybody
[1:09:48] good everybody good and when I don't see
[1:09:50] somebody it bothers me all right so you
[1:09:55] know but I tell you what we're gonna do
[1:09:57] today is just we're gonna preach and try
[1:09:59] to preach the devil out and you know and
[1:10:03] then we're just gonna keep pressing on
[1:10:04] but but we have a responsibility we got
[1:10:06] to be concerned about our brothers and
[1:10:08] sisters man and especially in this hour
[1:10:11] a man we want to be extremely concerned
[1:10:13] the devil is busy and you know we just
[1:10:19] can't give them too much time so it's
[1:10:21] some things that you know okay I've been
[1:10:24] awaiting now I got to come back and deal
[1:10:26] with you know just a few things so just
[1:10:27] pray for my I pray that God give me
[1:10:29] wisdom on a lot of things because we we
[1:10:31] just hate the devil we just we just hate
[1:10:33] him hey man I hate I hate them I hate to
[1:10:36] see when you know he ain't gonna stop
[1:10:38] you know but but we're gonna do all we
[1:10:41] can just to keep fighting hey man so I
[1:10:43] want I want to read two scriptures here
[1:10:46] today a man
[1:10:48] and one from the book of numbers and
[1:10:52] then the other from the book of
[1:10:53] Ephesians so if you all would just stand
[1:10:55] with me we'll read the Word of God
[1:10:57] together
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:09] numbers chapter 31 and then like I said
[1:11:14] my thoughts are a little mixed between
[1:11:19] traditional and non-traditional here
[1:11:21] today
[1:11:22] I think it's important that we you know
[1:11:26] I can't even I can't remember a time or
[1:11:28] brother branham extra priest a Father's
[1:11:29] Day sermon but not to neglect fathers I
[1:11:34] think they're very important and
[1:11:36] sometimes we need to say something to
[1:11:37] encourage and strengthen them as well so
[1:11:39] we want to try to do that if we can
[1:11:42] numbers 31 it says in the Lord spake
[1:11:46] unto Moses saying
[1:11:47] avenge the children of Israel of the
[1:11:50] Midianites afterwards shalt thou be
[1:11:53] gathered unto that people and Moses
[1:11:56] thinkin to the people saying are some of
[1:12:00] yourselves unto the war and let them go
[1:12:03] against the Midianites and avenge the
[1:12:06] lord of Midian and let's just turn over
[1:12:09] to another scripture here in Ephesians
[1:12:13] praise the Lord I'm just picking up here
[1:12:19] in chapter 6 verse 10 a man says this
[1:12:26] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:12:28] Lord and then the power of his might put
[1:12:30] on the whole armour of God that you may
[1:12:32] be able to stand against the wiles of
[1:12:35] the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:12:37] flesh and blood but against
[1:12:39] principalities against powers against
[1:12:42] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:12:45] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:12:47] places
[1:12:48] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:12:50] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:12:52] and the evil day and having done all to
[1:12:55] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:12:57] Girt about with truth and having on the
[1:13:00] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:13:02] feet shod with the preparation of the
[1:13:05] gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:13:08] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[1:13:10] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:13:11] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:13:14] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[1:13:16] which is the word of God praying always
[1:13:18] with all prayer and supplication and the
[1:13:21] spirit and watching thereunto
[1:13:22] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:13:24] for All Saints and for me that utterance
[1:13:28] may be given unto me that I may open my
[1:13:31] mouth boldly to make known the mystery
[1:13:33] of the gospel amen the Lord had a
[1:13:36] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:13:38] let's just bound a brief word of Prayer
[1:13:39] before we take our fall today father we
[1:13:44] thank you for all that you have done
[1:13:46] here in the service your anointing that
[1:13:50] destroys yokes and the father we dis
[1:13:54] appreciate if we ask that you would now
[1:13:57] take control over the the word as it is
[1:14:00] being presented we execute take control
[1:14:03] of every thought that you would our just
[1:14:06] bless and anoint and minister to each
[1:14:10] and every one God and only way that you
[1:14:12] can every spirit that is the gift your
[1:14:15] spirit would take underneath the control
[1:14:16] of the Holy Spirit even right now it's
[1:14:18] in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God
[1:14:22] richly bless you can be seated
[1:14:26] let's not I'll give you my title and a
[1:14:28] little bit here but I do want to just
[1:14:31] you know here I wanted this open by
[1:14:42] reading a man this quote a couple quotes
[1:14:45] here
[1:14:46] the first one comes from time-tested
[1:14:48] memorials of God a man time-tested
[1:14:51] memorials of God and you know just as
[1:14:53] we're making preparation and again this
[1:14:56] being Father's Day I think it's
[1:15:00] extremely important that we understand a
[1:15:05] man the need for Father's hold on to
[1:15:10] that quote this for a second
[1:15:13] typically on Father's Day I always like
[1:15:15] to share this wonderful story a man that
[1:15:18] I heard some years ago there was a story
[1:15:22] of some group of a herd of elephants a
[1:15:26] man that were there in Africa heard of
[1:15:30] them and it has some scientists that
[1:15:33] kind of came
[1:15:34] and they they they thought to themselves
[1:15:37] that you know what we will take out some
[1:15:41] of the elephants from the herd and
[1:15:43] repositioned them to another place here
[1:15:46] in Africa and you know what to see what
[1:15:48] happens so they went in and they by
[1:15:50] helicopter they began to lift some of
[1:15:52] the elephants out and these were the the
[1:15:55] male the elephants the father figures
[1:15:58] they were taken out of the herd and they
[1:16:00] would take these take them out and they
[1:16:03] would put them into another area and and
[1:16:06] they come back to the area where they
[1:16:07] took them from and they just began to
[1:16:10] notice something there they noticed that
[1:16:12] a lot of the rhinoceroses begin to die
[1:16:16] and they were they were wondering is the
[1:16:19] rhinoceros got holes in them and
[1:16:21] everything and I wonder what in the
[1:16:22] world is going on is somebody coming out
[1:16:24] here and and spearing Iza these animals
[1:16:26] what are they doing you know ever since
[1:16:28] we took these fathers out these these
[1:16:30] rhinoceros is a time and they begin to
[1:16:33] do research and they realized that it
[1:16:35] wasn't some man coming out doing it but
[1:16:37] it was the the baby male elephants that
[1:16:42] began to take their their their tusks
[1:16:45] and they were disappearing
[1:16:47] you know these rhinoceroses and just
[1:16:49] killing the rhinoceros is like crazy and
[1:16:51] so they say you know well that behavior
[1:16:54] did not start until the fathers were
[1:16:58] missing all right so they decided to go
[1:17:02] back to this other area a man and and
[1:17:06] get the father elephants and bring them
[1:17:08] back in and reintroduce them you know to
[1:17:10] the herd again you know and and the
[1:17:14] thing I wanted to kind of catch with
[1:17:15] that is that sometimes a man with our
[1:17:21] experiments a man we can actually
[1:17:24] silence the voice of daddy I hope we get
[1:17:29] that right sometimes a man things that
[1:17:34] we do can actually silence the voice of
[1:17:37] daddy
[1:17:38] and you don't understand that the voice
[1:17:40] of daddy is needed right all sometimes
[1:17:44] you know dad don't say a lot they don't
[1:17:46] talk as much as mama I'm talking real
[1:17:49] good right now
[1:17:50] daddy don't talk as much as mama daddy
[1:17:53] do a lotta observing and when that is
[1:17:56] speak is gonna be just short words short
[1:17:58] sentences you you might your dad would
[1:18:01] you explain this and I might explain
[1:18:02] this no say there's one sentence you
[1:18:04] need to catch this right and so so what
[1:18:08] we find us that often times we take that
[1:18:10] it out of the picture a man with some of
[1:18:13] the things that we do when some of the
[1:18:15] decisions that we make we remove data
[1:18:17] from from the hurts
[1:18:19] brave the Lord but but the reason that
[1:18:21] the kids go WOW is because Dan is not
[1:18:24] there the reason things amen turn out
[1:18:27] the way that they turn out because the
[1:18:29] voice of daddy is not there now now
[1:18:32] don't get me wrong I think that there's
[1:18:34] some father's that you know have
[1:18:36] neglected their responsibilities a man I
[1:18:39] think that there's many that have walked
[1:18:41] away and run from you know what God
[1:18:43] called them to do but but on the other
[1:18:45] side I think there's something that has
[1:18:47] done what they need to do right and
[1:18:49] they've been right where they need to be
[1:18:50] but it must here they get neglected they
[1:18:54] get put if they get pushed to the side
[1:18:55] but when you want to see things settle
[1:18:57] down again go get daddy and they're from
[1:19:00] this remote place that you put them and
[1:19:02] and notice now it was the scientists
[1:19:05] that took them out and it was the
[1:19:07] scientists that had to bring them back
[1:19:09] again hallelujah amen so sometimes
[1:19:14] they're things that you do that might
[1:19:15] take it out but it's things you have to
[1:19:17] do to bring it back in again come on
[1:19:20] somebody right so you know what I like
[1:19:22] to tell this story because you know
[1:19:24] those elephants these baby elephants
[1:19:26] went wild
[1:19:27] they went absolutely wild because they
[1:19:31] did not have a man a father figure but
[1:19:35] when they reintroduced the daddy when
[1:19:37] they reintroduced eat these two the melt
[1:19:39] of the male elephants the father figures
[1:19:41] all the killing stopped all the killer
[1:19:45] stop now you know let me just while I'm
[1:19:47] here I'm going to just give you all some
[1:19:48] statistics they may
[1:19:50] it's important to have daddy hey man
[1:19:55] it's important to have daddy let me let
[1:19:58] me give you something here a statement
[1:20:00] made here real men protect the
[1:20:02] vulnerable that's what a real man does
[1:20:05] he protects the vulnerable
[1:20:07] he doesn't assault them growing up
[1:20:10] having learned that most based of the
[1:20:11] most that most the most basic tenets of
[1:20:14] manhood is the job of fathers oh lord
[1:20:18] have mercy the most basic tenant of man
[1:20:21] who is the job of fathers
[1:20:24] oh you look ya'll come and let me just
[1:20:26] say some things if you know anybody can
[1:20:29] make a baby you can be 12 but 13 and
[1:20:34] make a baby but I mean you can take care
[1:20:38] right you know and this is the thing I
[1:20:42] like I like that I like to see this you
[1:20:44] know when you call yourself being a man
[1:20:46] ma n lamb and you know you don't want
[1:20:51] nobody to tell you that you're not a man
[1:20:54] and just because you get a certain age
[1:20:58] don't make you a man huh 21 22 30 that
[1:21:05] don't make you a man a man is where you
[1:21:08] can meet oh right glory to God you know
[1:21:18] ain't no ain't no you know like I say
[1:21:20] anybody can go out there and make babies
[1:21:22] anybody can do that
[1:21:23] but when you notice
[1:21:25] and take responsibility right that's
[1:21:29] when you really becoming a man hey let
[1:21:32] me tell you something so moss and good
[1:21:35] luck this to take care of ourself how
[1:21:38] you don't take care of anybody else huh
[1:21:41] hey man and then it goes further than
[1:21:43] that glory to God
[1:21:46] hey man you gotta be able to take care
[1:21:48] yourself then take care of wife then
[1:21:51] take care of chillin they may not just
[1:21:57] have children can you take care of their
[1:22:01] children
[1:22:04] right I mean all this is necessary and
[1:22:07] when we talk about taking care of
[1:22:09] children I want you to understand the
[1:22:11] role that you know let me let me just
[1:22:13] give you give you something from from
[1:22:16] the Prophet you know just just so you
[1:22:18] understand your role as a daddy as a
[1:22:21] daddy let me let me let me let me help
[1:22:23] you understand that I'm going to go to
[1:22:26] this quote out of leadership dad is
[1:22:31] you've got to be there
[1:22:33] you got to be you got to be present it
[1:22:36] man you know the the one thing that I
[1:22:39] that I appreciate my father he was there
[1:22:41] my dad didn't run the streets
[1:22:43] my daddy was home right I mean we didn't
[1:22:47] have to worry about my dad had been out
[1:22:49] of the ball right Wayne worry about that
[1:22:52] Laurita got my daddy to bring bill home
[1:22:54] I think all the time we saw beer in the
[1:22:57] frigerator when they made beer brands
[1:22:59] [Music]

[1:29:20] you gotta be around other men if you're
[1:29:24] gonna learn how to be a man praise the
[1:29:27] Lord cuz they're stirring except that
[1:29:28] he's gone facing life that uh mama ain't
[1:29:31] gon face let me let me let me give it to
[1:29:33] you Freddie out of leadership the
[1:29:35] Prophet preached this message leadership
[1:29:38] and and notice this notice what he says
[1:29:40] the first is the mother's kindness then
[1:29:43] the fathers worked after the mother
[1:29:45] gives you your first step then you look
[1:29:48] to your daddy see so now mama time
[1:29:51] taught you how to walk and on ahead and
[1:29:53] not you look to your daddy mama taught
[1:29:55] you how to talk
[1:29:56] you know all these things but now you
[1:29:58] look too
[1:29:59] daddy all of us for wisdom he looked at
[1:30:03] daddy for wisdom not now if we were to
[1:30:06] be honest with ourselves there are
[1:30:07] things that come up in family dynamics
[1:30:11] things that happen within the family
[1:30:14] structure and I know what happens in
[1:30:16] that house and you know my wife she you
[1:30:18] know she handles a lot of the issues
[1:30:20] that come up between her and the girls
[1:30:22] because you know being a woman she can
[1:30:24] see things from a woman perspective but
[1:30:25] every now and then they have to ask
[1:30:28] daddy something right what you think
[1:30:30] about this and what you think about that
[1:30:33] and you know and I have to be able to
[1:30:34] kind of you know look at the situation
[1:30:36] and give you know based on based on
[1:30:38] experience to that out that I've gone
[1:30:39] through you know and and so dad is going
[1:30:42] to be involved somewhere and daddy got
[1:30:44] to be ready to take advantage of their
[1:30:46] moments
[1:30:46] prays alone right amen say first first
[1:30:50] thing is mother's kindness then is that
[1:30:52] then the father's word and at the mother
[1:30:55] gives you your first step then then you
[1:30:57] look to your daddy all of us for wisdom
[1:30:59] because he is the head of the house amen
[1:31:04] all right let me read that again amen
[1:31:09] all right said then you look at your
[1:31:11] daddy are all of us for wisdom because
[1:31:13] what he is the head that is the head of
[1:31:17] the house I know you know we don't got
[1:31:20] this thing now I work he ain't even
[1:31:28] working I'm gonna tell you what I heard
[1:31:30] a preacher say right here in this pulpit
[1:31:32] they came all the way from Philippines
[1:31:35] on Wednesday night and he told us
[1:31:38] something my think was over there whoa
[1:31:41] but it was a truth in half he say he say
[1:31:45] sister he said if your husband is making
[1:31:49] $10 a week when God has blessed you to
[1:31:53] make $1000 a week he say you know since
[1:31:57] you are the helpmate
[1:31:59] what God did without your thousand
[1:32:02] dollars to help his ten dollars
[1:32:16] now imitation when you can see it that
[1:32:19] way
[1:32:20] then your household gonna come back and
[1:32:23] Bible we live in an age now where women
[1:32:28] aren't able to out-earn the man but but
[1:32:31] we still got into our place a chord in
[1:32:33] the scripture just because you make more
[1:32:35] money don't make you the head
[1:32:40] you still got to subject yourself and
[1:32:44] submit yourself to his headship and it's
[1:32:47] all of them the way that you presented
[1:32:48] you know I guarantee if you say baby
[1:32:51] God gave me this thousand dollars Ben
[1:32:53] help this is to help you up ten dollars
[1:32:55] have you said you gonna make them you
[1:32:56] know strike something on this eco and
[1:32:58] like you don't want to go out and do
[1:32:59] more but you say you ain't made lentil
[1:33:01] but ten dollars I'm thinking a thousand
[1:33:03] dollars you you ain't never been nothing
[1:33:08] my mom and my daddy told me and you
[1:33:12] approving everything they see when you
[1:33:18] speak them words over your mate
[1:33:22] see the reason you got your situation
[1:33:25] the way it is right now can I use these
[1:33:27] words it's all jacked up it's because
[1:33:31] you don't spoke that over your
[1:33:33] relationship you gotta find your place
[1:33:37] and when you find your place you see God
[1:33:40] we're blessed hey man I got a blessed
[1:33:44] you get to the point where you know like
[1:33:45] Lord I'm so happy to be able to help my
[1:33:49] husband and make this money but you know
[1:33:51] Lord we got different responsibilities
[1:33:53] we got kids now and I'd like to be there
[1:33:55] for the kids you know because the mother
[1:33:57] offers certain things to the kids that
[1:33:58] the father just can't give oh hallelujah
[1:34:02] yeah I mean I don't know nowadays we got
[1:34:06] this mr. mom thing going on you can't
[1:34:09] find it in the Bible
[1:34:12] it's not there
[1:34:14] God never intended for the wife to take
[1:34:17] care of the family that was never God's
[1:34:22] intention it is the husband's
[1:34:23] responsibility a man search it's the
[1:34:27] husband's responsibility neither one got
[1:34:29] to go to work
[1:34:30] and you get a man that don't want to go
[1:34:32] to work you can't do something problem
[1:34:35] now you ought to be able to tell that
[1:34:37] when you court if if you paying
[1:34:45] attention
[1:34:45] and if you were just you know be patient
[1:34:48] you let some things come out right
[1:34:51] because you'll be able to see some stuff
[1:34:54] if you know you you cortland yeah y'all
[1:34:56] first start courting you take you to my
[1:34:58] college y'all you know

[1:35:42] get into nothing
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:47] i'ma tell y'all something you know
[1:35:51] because I'm the spiritual daddy right
[1:35:55] and daddy actually have to set
[1:35:57] expectations not just in the home but in
[1:36:01] the sex right but you know I can tell
[1:36:06] you if you lay the church you probably
[1:36:08] late to your job right you populating
[1:36:14] your job and if you ladie a job all the
[1:36:16] time do you think they don't use you and
[1:36:20] you be one that you know you know you
[1:36:21] live in Florida you know what happens
[1:36:23] with more that means people ain't got to
[1:36:24] give you no reason right and letting you
[1:36:27] go so here here think of this if they
[1:36:30] don't have to give you more reason don't
[1:36:32] give till don't give them a reason to
[1:36:37] let you go
[1:36:40] sometimes you got a hush your mouth you
[1:36:44] can't be involved another conversation
[1:36:46] why because you gotta take care of
[1:36:49] family
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:52] hallelujah hey man but sometimes the way
[1:36:56] that wheat wheat wheat the winter way
[1:36:57] that you treat God is indicative
[1:37:07] because if your treat go out that way
[1:37:09] then what you'll do to the boss man all
[1:37:13] right so this number tell you the way
[1:37:16] that you know cuz if you give you you
[1:37:18] know a brother Jack I want you to be a
[1:37:20] reference for me what I'm gonna tell
[1:37:23] them if it's Sunday I'll talk and you
[1:37:29] ain't change the service time in years
[1:37:32] it's fine at 10:30 every Sunday and they
[1:37:36] late I mean I'm a challenge you today
[1:37:45] I'm a challenge you today give god mode
[1:37:49] and when you give God more then watch
[1:37:53] them give you more if God can trust you
[1:37:57] your boss can't trust you either
[1:38:00] hey man come and I mean let me just read
[1:38:07] finish reading this and then I got some
[1:38:09] other things I need to share says the
[1:38:15] first his mother's count in the father's
[1:38:17] word after mother gives you your first
[1:38:18] step then you look to your daddy all of
[1:38:21] us for wisdom for he because he is the
[1:38:24] head of the house and he usually you
[1:38:29] know now now you know you have and some
[1:38:33] relationships the husband is the head
[1:38:40] but the wife is the neck and what that
[1:38:48] means is that she turns the head
[1:38:53] whatever direction she wanted to go and
[1:38:57] and and and and and and and and and and
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:07] and as a man I can tell when a wife is
[1:39:15] turning her husband's hey you can tell
[1:39:22] whether that's coming from him or
[1:39:25] whether that's coming from huh you just
[1:39:34] see it all over that old look at what
[1:39:36] she just did look I haven't seen it I've
[1:39:38] seen
[1:40:01] what you didn't involved in that front
[1:40:04] that that's man's business it's just me
[1:40:09] and talking why are you responding to it
[1:40:14] or encouraging you need to respond no no
[1:40:18] no no don't don't do that don't do that
[1:40:21] don't do I mean you can tell when the
[1:40:23] wife doesn't making the neck turn see
[1:40:25] she put us the husband in certain
[1:40:27] positions doing this it no no that's not
[1:40:30] that's not organic
[1:40:34] so a man becomes a man just just it's
[1:40:37] organic it grows into E but not because
[1:40:42] it's Y turning his neck I mean turn this
[1:40:45] in
[1:40:46] you understand all right you already
[1:40:50] gone hey man thank you Jesus
[1:40:56] all right for wisdom because he is the
[1:41:00] head of the house and he usually not
[1:41:04] that he's any smarter cuz I'm just I'm
[1:41:07] just decent powerful statements because
[1:41:10] you know it's not saying that the
[1:41:11] husband is smarter than the wife
[1:41:12] sometimes and wife is actually smarter
[1:41:14] than husband and you know and I think
[1:41:16] there's a balance here because you know
[1:41:17] I remember Brennan gave this guidance
[1:41:19] advice man every time he was handling
[1:41:21] the books in the home they was always
[1:41:23] short of money
[1:41:24] it was always short but because he was
[1:41:28] the head of a house I'm gonna handle the
[1:41:31] money let me talk to you about money
[1:41:36] women think different about extra money
[1:41:39] than the way men think about it yet when
[1:41:43] a woman sees extra money you got
[1:41:45] chilling in the house she's thinking
[1:41:46] another dress the most shoes some some
[1:41:50] old you know stop some of this but some
[1:41:52] prevents she's thinking that right well
[1:41:56] the man says he say oil change you know
[1:41:59] wash the car upgrade the car I may be
[1:42:03] thinking something totally different
[1:42:04] here you know
[1:42:07] and we're also Wars I collided it create
[1:42:09] problems and let me tell you something
[1:42:13] you'll never get a man to think like a
[1:42:15] woman and you never get a woman to think
[1:42:17] like a man so you have to just accept
[1:42:20] that and just work through that phrase
[1:42:23] alone right and sometime is good when
[1:42:25] you got some extra money just give her a
[1:42:27] little something you don't know how
[1:42:32] y'all did brothers don't got that secret
[1:42:33] compartment in the wallet that they wife
[1:42:36] don't know nothing about and you know I
[1:42:37] don't heard it if it told me and I know
[1:42:39] y'all brothers are you can't tell
[1:42:41] everything you got she'll get it and
[1:42:51] when she got in the houses all these
[1:42:53] split accounts I know I know why I know
[1:42:56] why if they had by ten thousand dollars
[1:42:59] and another counting her husband knew
[1:43:00] nothing about it and he just got working
[1:43:03] working crazy trying to pay the bills
[1:43:06] and she's sitting on ten thousand never
[1:43:09] even said anything to him about the
[1:43:11] money that she had that's a shame
[1:43:14] I thought we was one the same thing with
[1:43:22] a hug he's sitting on all this money but
[1:43:23] got his wife out there working like like
[1:43:25] crazy see you know you know the stress
[1:43:29] comes me I had a funnel out and
[1:43:30] everything but that's okay baby just
[1:43:32] keep on we don't we don't we don't love
[1:43:39] each other the way Christ told us to
[1:43:42] love each other all right let me keep
[1:43:44] going now now now now sister you might
[1:43:46] be smarter than your husband brother
[1:43:48] branham told the brothers they look
[1:43:49] because of the bills keep running short
[1:43:52] when you run into books why don't you
[1:43:53] let your wife through the books just let
[1:43:55] your wife do it because she's better
[1:43:56] with handling money then you are so it's
[1:43:59] okay to understand that you got
[1:44:01] weaknesses and God gave you a helpmate
[1:44:03] so that you don't end up bro
[1:44:07] all right let me go on a man I'm going
[1:44:11] on I'm not that he's any smarter but he
[1:44:14] just made a leader of his family he's
[1:44:16] made he's made a leader of his family so
[1:44:19] we followed what I daddy says to when he
[1:44:22] says now son I would like for you to do
[1:44:23] a certain certain thing then we listen
[1:44:26] to him because it's wisdom right but
[1:44:29] listen see he has learned a whole lot
[1:44:31] and we've got to ask him to see what he
[1:44:35] learned then we can profit by his what
[1:44:38] he has learned he tells us now don't go
[1:44:41] and do this because I did that my father
[1:44:44] told me not to do it but I did it and it
[1:44:46] caused this to happen to me something
[1:44:48] bad so see that then he dad it tells us
[1:44:50] how to do and what to do right let me go
[1:44:55] on here says then after mother leaves us
[1:44:57] till the time we have to get a little
[1:45:00] wisdom to understand from daddy then we
[1:45:02] get another we get another leader and
[1:45:04] that's a teacher a good stuff a good
[1:45:05] school teacher she tries to teach you
[1:45:08] and give you an education to fit you've
[1:45:11] been in life a place a position that
[1:45:13] that you can read your Bible and you can
[1:45:16] read the songs and you can learn from
[1:45:18] God and read your self you see and then
[1:45:20] another thing maybe you have business
[1:45:21] and someday write you a letter
[1:45:23] mama daddy somebody write your letter
[1:45:25] you couldn't read it see so the teacher
[1:45:27] she has she has you then and she leads
[1:45:30] you to learn to write and to read and
[1:45:32] it's a good thing a good teacher to
[1:45:33] teach you right but now after you after
[1:45:35] you leave that after you leave the
[1:45:37] teacher one teacher after another one
[1:45:39] from a little primer a little first
[1:45:41] grade until you get out of high school
[1:45:43] or go to college then when you leave
[1:45:45] college and then the teachers through
[1:45:47] leading you see now mama has taught you
[1:45:50] to walk see Papa has taught you how to
[1:45:53] be brilliant how to be a brilliant and a
[1:45:56] nice young man and how to take care of
[1:45:58] yourself and behave yourself no what if
[1:46:00] what was that that's not right there
[1:46:02] daddy is instilling character he
[1:46:07] understand that is responsible is there
[1:46:10] still character you know I was I
[1:46:12] remember you know coming up and at my
[1:46:14] household I have me
[1:46:16] a proclamation it was my decision that
[1:46:20] in my house that my children will not be
[1:46:24] the worst kids in the church whatever I
[1:46:29] have to do to prevent that then my
[1:46:32] children will not be known as the
[1:46:34] baddest kids in church that was that was
[1:46:39] my Proclamation right I want it I wanted
[1:46:42] my kids to be respectful I wanted to be
[1:46:45] a you know lord have mercy I mean I
[1:46:49] wonder I want I wanted them to you know
[1:46:50] I wanted them to you know I wanted
[1:46:54] people to know that you know these kids
[1:46:56] are well behaved I want that right you
[1:46:58] know I remember this thing just came
[1:47:00] back to my one I wasn't thinking about
[1:47:02] just came to me one more time and I'm
[1:47:04] telling them brother Caleb on this one
[1:47:06] we was in the car all of us as a family
[1:47:09] and just driving we were looking at
[1:47:14] Christmas lights and our Kayla was in
[1:47:18] the back of the car and Caleb let out of
[1:47:22] word in the back of the car he didn't
[1:47:29] know no better
[1:47:30] right I mean it's coming her to school
[1:47:33] and it just came out of my fam you knew
[1:47:35] he didn't know no better cuz he said it
[1:47:41] they're gonna let out a word in the back
[1:47:44] of the car and you wanna like the world
[1:47:51] stopped from moving
[1:47:54] what was that you saying fart now you're
[1:47:58] asked the question but you don't want
[1:47:59] him to repeat the answer but you want
[1:48:03] them to know you can't speak like that
[1:48:07] you have to establish things later you
[1:48:12] have to take moments in you know and
[1:48:15] understand - daddy daddy you know
[1:48:17] there's some times some some things that
[1:48:19] all the data can say and you know
[1:48:23] sometimes daddy might sit and everybody
[1:48:25] going to go right around went there to
[1:48:26] say it but it ain't change what that I
[1:48:28] said daddy ain't changed what he said
[1:48:35] you know these um this this this this
[1:48:41] quote is telling us that the father is
[1:48:44] the one Papas taught you to be brilliant
[1:48:46] in a nice young man on how to take care
[1:48:48] of yourself and behave yourself now if
[1:48:51] daddy's done that then daddy has a right
[1:48:54] that when when the child is not doing
[1:48:57] what daddy has established that is
[1:49:00] that's the principle I was talking with
[1:49:02] some men they were saying how you know
[1:49:04] think that there is for a second I'm
[1:49:06] just all over the place I can't get this
[1:49:08] but if they were talking about how you
[1:49:11] know their children were going to a
[1:49:14] certain thing they want to do a certain
[1:49:15] thing and or or you know sometimes
[1:49:19] parents have their own desires for the
[1:49:21] children right I mean you might want
[1:49:23] your child to grow up to be a doctor but
[1:49:26] they're not good at math and you gotta
[1:49:31] force him to be a doctor no with no you
[1:49:33] know you wouldn't even let your own
[1:49:35] child operate on you
[1:49:39] so they're not gonna operate on nobody
[1:49:41] else that's that's not what it is right
[1:49:44] you got to find what really works fetch
[1:49:46] I would encourage them in that
[1:49:47] particular area right but also if a
[1:49:50] child has low ambitions then it's up to
[1:49:53] the parents account you see you see the
[1:49:55] potential and as a dad you see the
[1:49:58] potential you've got to call that out of
[1:49:59] that child you know you can do this and
[1:50:02] you're very good at this right you want
[1:50:05] to be the one to call it out of the
[1:50:06] child and you know so the these there's
[1:50:10] you know this gentleman was telling me
[1:50:12] to say well you know my child we was
[1:50:14] there was going a particular direction
[1:50:15] then they say didn't want to do that no
[1:50:17] more so I just let him do whatever they
[1:50:18] want to do I don't know about that I
[1:50:21] don't know about that I said I had a
[1:50:23] different situation and when my daughter
[1:50:27] was coming out of college I mean coming
[1:50:28] out of high school and she wanted to I
[1:50:30] mean she's good at cooking and she
[1:50:33] wanted to go into baking school well I
[1:50:35] looked at the culinary that's where
[1:50:38] their cognac
[1:50:38] I call it baking cakes I'm looking at
[1:50:45] the cuffs because that's my
[1:50:47] responsibility right I got a look at the
[1:50:50] money all the time make sure that this
[1:50:51] right so I'm going to cost laughs wait a
[1:50:53] minute cost you to get this certificate
[1:50:56] certification over here versus getting a
[1:50:59] degree over here so my encouragement
[1:51:01] like no I'll tell you what let's put the
[1:51:03] money and you going to college rather
[1:51:06] than go to culinary school so now after
[1:51:08] you finish college if you still want to
[1:51:10] go to culinary school we'll do something
[1:51:12] about that well by God's grace she got
[1:51:14] me graduating from college and then one
[1:51:17] more semester and I thank God she don't
[1:51:19] have a bachelor's degree right but as a
[1:51:23] father the reason that I had to say that
[1:51:26] to her is because I tried to take a
[1:51:28] shortcut when I was coming out of high
[1:51:31] when I came in high school and again I
[1:51:33] had a mama and a daddy speaking into my
[1:51:35] life pushing me to do other things that
[1:51:38] they knew I could do but I tried to take
[1:51:39] a shortcut I got tired of math English
[1:51:43] social studies science I don't want to
[1:51:45] see no more of it so I took a shortcut I
[1:51:49] went to a little college
[1:51:49] didn't have mother day got my degree and
[1:51:54] started working but you know what I
[1:51:57] found out that college would not allow
[1:51:58] me to transfer my credits to any other
[1:52:00] school and I don't paid all this money
[1:52:03] so right I don't want to waste money
[1:52:06] like that again it already happened to
[1:52:07] me once and I said you got me once you
[1:52:09] won't get my family so that's why based
[1:52:14] on my experience right I give advice
[1:52:17] based on the things that I went through
[1:52:19] and and and when a father's doing that
[1:52:23] that's not to Atlanta damage the child
[1:52:25] that's the protective child of the
[1:52:29] blessed thing that I'm happy when my
[1:52:31] daughter graduates you're graduating
[1:52:32] without any school day I'm appreciative
[1:52:38] of that I thank God for that
[1:52:41] so because that's not my testimony when
[1:52:44] I graduated I was in 40,000 and I'm
[1:52:48] still paying for it today and not even
[1:52:51] working in my field but still paying off
[1:52:55] the debt all right I want to so the the
[1:53:00] Papa has taught you how to be brilliant
[1:53:02] in a nice young man how to take care of
[1:53:04] yourself in baby stuff the teachers
[1:53:05] taught you in education how to read and
[1:53:07] write but now you're leaving papa you're
[1:53:11] leaving mama and you're leaving a
[1:53:13] teacher now somebody has to take you
[1:53:15] from here own a man so see this this is
[1:53:19] I preached the sermon some time ago
[1:53:21] seasons of a father's life and and and
[1:53:25] and when father gets to a season where
[1:53:26] his kids are now leaving he has to take
[1:53:29] on a different role that's not the same
[1:53:31] role anymore right he has to move on
[1:53:33] into something else now but there was a
[1:53:35] time where he was really guiding and
[1:53:37] giving this and giving that but now to
[1:53:39] get to a point now you got to figure it
[1:53:40] out on your own but I'm giving you
[1:53:42] everything you need now I got to find
[1:53:44] something to put my time into amen but I
[1:53:48] gave all my time I gave all my time but
[1:53:51] now I'm gonna find something else to put
[1:53:52] my time into already God
[1:53:54] this is this is the see when a person
[1:53:56] retires you know since they're not going
[1:53:59] to work every day they gotta find
[1:54:01] something
[1:54:01] to take up that time amen Laura God
[1:54:05] ministry is what takes up a lot of my
[1:54:07] time I don't mind giving my time to it I
[1:54:09] love it I love it but uh but here you
[1:54:12] know you got as a father you realize you
[1:54:14] got to move to a different just just a
[1:54:16] different mode now Amen because because
[1:54:19] things have changed
[1:54:20] look look at this you're leaving mama
[1:54:22] you're Lea that you're leaving a teacher
[1:54:24] now somebody has to take you from here
[1:54:26] on now who do you want to take you from
[1:54:29] here on that's right Jesus to take you
[1:54:32] from their own now that's a very good as
[1:54:34] the verifying Jesus takes you from their
[1:54:36] own a child said Jesus I should have put
[1:54:38] that in and see this is the thing about
[1:54:40] a father if I've established a certain
[1:54:45] pattern before my kids they suddenly
[1:54:48] faithfully serving the Lord before them
[1:54:50] then as a father that the true the true
[1:54:57] complement to the daddies life is to see
[1:55:03] his children begin to serve the Lord the
[1:55:06] same way he served the Lord that's the
[1:55:09] greatest compliment that a father or
[1:55:11] mother could ever get as a city of
[1:55:13] children serving the Lord the same way
[1:55:15] they serve the Lord brothers finally
[1:55:18] make that comment last night he said he
[1:55:19] said I took my kids to the youth media
[1:55:22] I'd just send them but I took them
[1:55:25] places and when they had this service I
[1:55:27] drove my kids there when they couldn't
[1:55:30] drive I made sure they was in the right
[1:55:32] environment and since I did what what
[1:55:36] God told me was a train up a child and
[1:55:39] the way that they should go when they
[1:55:42] get out of they won't depart he said
[1:55:44] since I did my part I'm expecting God
[1:55:48] I'm expecting God I don't know how and I
[1:55:52] don't know me but I'm expecting god a
[1:56:00] real man protector barnable not a stock
[1:56:04] them now you get that that's
[1:56:08] that's that's what I was saying there's
[1:56:09] other things that go along see it you
[1:56:14] know we were we were kind of going
[1:56:15] through a little journey here and and in
[1:56:19] my own life you know when I got got
[1:56:22] married and I had my father-in-law and
[1:56:25] my brother-in-law and you know we all
[1:56:28] you know going on you know just doing
[1:56:30] Mike but we had no idea that things was
[1:56:33] gonna change for our family had no idea
[1:56:36] that my brother-in-law was gonna be
[1:56:37] called home and Herrera at an early age
[1:56:40] I had no idea that my father-in-law
[1:56:43] would be called a home at an early age
[1:56:46] and when you look around this view
[1:56:49] you're the only man in the family
[1:56:51] ain't no of us to take on the
[1:56:54] responsibility you can't share this
[1:56:58] there's nobody to share it with you got
[1:57:03] to stand up and be a man
[1:57:06] alright and see young man I'm telling
[1:57:10] you this because you don't know what God
[1:57:12] has prepared for you later on in your
[1:57:14] life that's why why are you young you
[1:57:15] need to learn responsibility now because
[1:57:19] it's gonna come in handy later
[1:57:24] real men protect the vulnerable not
[1:57:29] assault them grown up having learned
[1:57:32] that most basic tenets of manhood is the
[1:57:35] job of father's not the police the basic
[1:57:37] tenets of manhood is the job of fathers
[1:57:42] not the police save a photo before the
[1:57:46] police get to the corner data should be
[1:57:47] there standing in this boy's face yeah
[1:57:53] maybe you know I had a brother tell me
[1:57:56] one one time it says his son got all big
[1:57:59] and you know took off when I did what he
[1:58:01] wanted to do got to a certain age that's
[1:58:02] part go do it you learn and say that the
[1:58:05] the board got to a situation you got
[1:58:07] needed some money
[1:58:08] guess what we tanks daddy then you got
[1:58:13] so much money that you can let me borrow
[1:58:15] F say all right got it
[1:58:17] they say okay I'll see you
[1:58:20] and left it like that so daddy called
[1:58:22] them saying is this a threat you saying
[1:58:25] you gonna see me do I need to be looking
[1:58:27] over my shoulder or do I need to just
[1:58:29] come where you at right now we need that
[1:58:39] is like that I'm bigger than bigger than
[1:58:43] that son bigger than him but I'm still
[1:58:45] daddy listen this was a quote from a guy
[1:58:54] Daniel Patrick Moynihan says from the
[1:58:57] wild Irish slums of the 19th century
[1:58:59] eastern seaboard to the riot torn
[1:59:02] suburbs of Los Angeles there is one
[1:59:03] unmistakable lesson in American history
[1:59:06] a community that allows a large number
[1:59:09] of young men to grow up in broken homes
[1:59:11] dominated by women never acquiring any
[1:59:16] stable relationship to male authority
[1:59:18] never acquiring any rational
[1:59:21] expectations for the future that
[1:59:23] community asked for it and gets chaos I
[1:59:26] want to read that again a community that
[1:59:29] that allows a large number of young men
[1:59:32] to grow up in broken homes dominated by
[1:59:36] women see the reason that is because a
[1:59:38] woman came to teach a man how to be a
[1:59:40] man right
[1:59:40] never acquiring any stable relationship
[1:59:44] to male authority right if a man never
[1:59:48] required and never acquires a real good
[1:59:51] relationship to male authority than what
[1:59:54] he's doing is so in the seeds for what
[1:59:56] he grew up in and when you when you're
[2:00:02] when you're acquiring notice that
[2:00:05] acquiring a man a state relationship is
[2:00:07] not making things that you have to be
[2:00:09] organic in what you do but you got to
[2:00:11] put them in environments where they can
[2:00:13] get that type of relationship but if
[2:00:16] they're never quiet and it stable
[2:00:18] relationship to male authority never
[2:00:20] acquire any rational expectations for
[2:00:23] the future that community asked for and
[2:00:25] gets chaos you know I'm I wanted to kind
[2:00:33] of come back
[2:00:33] here to this you know it's one more
[2:00:36] battle and father's you know you're
[2:00:38] constantly in in a battle I mean that
[2:00:41] it's it's one thing to the next
[2:00:43] I mean it just it never it never seems
[2:00:45] to stop you always seem that you know a
[2:00:47] dad is always you know if if he's doing
[2:00:51] what he needs to do there's always in a
[2:00:53] spot where he's got to come up with some
[2:00:54] type of solution he's always kind of I
[2:00:57] mean something go wrong with the car
[2:00:58] they looking Danny so I'm gonna wrong in
[2:01:01] the house Danny right something go wrong
[2:01:04] it Danny somebody show them buddy bill
[2:01:11] can't get paid right this is it this the
[2:01:17] way it is I mean and so you're
[2:01:19] constantly in this mode and you're under
[2:01:21] this pressure and you know my thing that
[2:01:23] I want to share with is that you know
[2:01:25] that is you're gonna be in a battle from
[2:01:28] here unto the end it's going to be one
[2:01:31] battle after the other and all I can say
[2:01:34] is just don't give up don't don't quit
[2:01:35] don't throw in the towel don't don't
[2:01:37] don't don't think about doing that if
[2:01:39] God made a way before he gonna make a
[2:01:41] way again but but whether the devil's
[2:01:44] job is to put the pressure on dad and
[2:01:46] then he walked out on his family that's
[2:01:48] not what God walk that's not what God
[2:01:50] intended for prefer to happen some kind
[2:01:53] of way if you just pulled together and
[2:01:54] pray about a god and make a way somehow
[2:01:56] right but you know I was I was looking
[2:01:58] at this a man and lord let me just see
[2:02:02] here I tell you what I was doing I got
[2:02:05] it I'm a saved that felt I'm gonna say
[2:02:06] that though I want I want to just give

[2:03:34] that is important to be involved
[2:03:38] whatever you do just stay involved in
[2:03:41] the children's life fight to stay
[2:03:43] involved in the truth
[2:03:44] don't get me wrong if you're not add no
[2:03:47] value then and some people fight to
[2:03:56] stand people life just to make other
[2:03:57] people like miserable but you ain't
[2:04:01] doing nothing for the child you ain't
[2:04:03] did nothing for the child right so you
[2:04:06] know listen if if you're gonna be
[2:04:09] involved realize it's gonna make the
[2:04:11] difference in that child's life children
[2:04:13] with fathers who are involved I mean ask

[2:06:15] different ways so I'm gonna just stay
[2:06:16] with this but numbers 30 here and and
[2:06:21] i'ma tell y'all something else being in
[2:06:23] the past I know y'all and then knowing
[2:06:27] y'all like like mama know what what
[2:06:29] children need to eat
[2:06:30] they bring candy home all the time that

[2:06:39] stuff everybody hate the green and stuff
[2:06:42] but mama gonna lay it down there one
[2:06:44] smile because they need to eat that too
[2:06:45] to stay healthy and you know as passed I
[2:06:48] know what the church need to eat
[2:06:50] sometime hey man let me give you
[2:06:53] something here so father Joe I
[2:06:54] understand
[2:06:55] yellow roll look at this in numbers
[2:07:00] chapter 30 I want to to go to verse 3 if
[2:07:07] a woman also valid vow unto the Lord and
[2:07:12] bound herself by a barn being in a
[2:07:16] father's house house in her youth so
[2:07:20] this is the daughter right being in a
[2:07:22] father's house in her youth now by
[2:07:24] living at home in a daddy's house and
[2:07:26] she she she binds herself to something
[2:07:29] she makes a bond to something being in a
[2:07:31] father's house in her youth and her
[2:07:33] father hear her vow and an herb on
[2:07:37] wherewith she hath bound her soul and
[2:07:40] her father shall hold his peace at her
[2:07:43] then all her vows shall stand in every
[2:07:46] bond wherewith she hath bound her soul
[2:07:49] shall stand but if a father disallow her
[2:07:55] in the day that he heareth not any of
[2:07:59] her vows or of her paws wherewith she
[2:08:03] have bound her soul shall stand and the
[2:08:06] Lord shall forgive her because of father
[2:08:09] disallowed it
[2:08:11] you know just this it didn't say nothing
[2:08:13] about my mama
[2:08:14] but the daddy had the right to either
[2:08:18] allowed this this bow or this bond to be
[2:08:22] established or he can actually undo it
[2:08:25] only their daddy had that type of
[2:08:27] control see when we talk about having
[2:08:31] you know that that God gonna hold you
[2:08:32] responsible for certain things you need
[2:08:34] to understand your role as a father in
[2:08:36] the house
[2:08:37] you know there's certain things that
[2:08:38] daddy got to step up and say mama can't
[2:08:41] stay it won't be held to if mama sing
[2:08:46] but when daddy speaks things change
[2:08:50] remember I told you them elephants got
[2:08:53] wild when daddy got loose and when daddy
[2:08:55] came back into the situation that
[2:08:57] elephants calm him down again now it's
[2:08:59] not just that way for a daddy speaking
[2:09:01] over a man his daughter let's go on a
[2:09:06] little further
[2:09:14] all right yeah let's keep on reading
[2:09:19] here and if she had at all a husband
[2:09:22] when she vowed other all out of a lips
[2:09:25] way with street-bound her so and the
[2:09:27] husband heard it and held his peace at
[2:09:29] her in the end in the end the day that
[2:09:32] that he had heard it then her vows shall
[2:09:34] stand and her Bosworth she bound her
[2:09:37] soul since then but if her husband
[2:09:40] disavowed her on the day that he heard
[2:09:43] it then he shall make her vow which she
[2:09:45] vowed that and that which she uttered
[2:09:48] with her lips where was she bound her
[2:09:50] soul of none effect and the Lord shall
[2:09:52] forgive a scene at this time when a
[2:09:54] person about about the Bible says been a
[2:09:56] few to not vow then to valentown and
[2:10:00] breaking but if a person made any type
[2:10:02] of bow and it now so if it's a if it's a
[2:10:04] young lady in the father's house her
[2:10:06] father has the ability to disallow when
[2:10:10] she didn't marry her husband and only
[2:10:13] her husband has the ability to disallow
[2:10:16] in Gaza look at it let's keep on going
[2:10:19] it says I wish about him that which he
[2:10:22] uttered with the lips where she found a
[2:10:24] soul of not affecting the Lord shall
[2:10:25] forgive her but every vow of a widow and
[2:10:27] I've heard that is divorced when they
[2:10:29] have bound their souls she'll stand
[2:10:31] against her and if she found in her
[2:10:34] husband's house or bound or so about
[2:10:37] bound with an oath and her husband heard
[2:10:38] it and held his peace at her and
[2:10:40] disallowed her not that on her vow shall
[2:10:42] stand and every farm wherewith she found
[2:10:45] her soldiers stand but if her husband
[2:10:46] had utterly made them void on the day he
[2:10:48] heard them then whatsoever proceedeth
[2:10:50] out of her lips concerning her vows or
[2:10:52] concerning the fond of her of her soul
[2:10:55] shall not stand her husband had made
[2:10:57] them void and the Lord shall forgive her
[2:11:00] the role of the father the role of the
[2:11:03] husband is a very important role very
[2:11:09] important role now I know nowadays
[2:11:11] people don't follow the Scriptures but
[2:11:13] if you know yeah we kind of understand
[2:11:15] understood what it want us to make about
[2:11:18] back in those days and how God you know
[2:11:20] how God saw that bow right when we when
[2:11:22] we understand that
[2:11:23] only only only the male figure only the
[2:11:27] father only the husband had the
[2:11:29] authority in the household this is why
[2:11:32] God say he's the head it didn't put the
[2:11:34] wife there and didn't put them and
[2:11:36] didn't put the momma there it put the
[2:11:38] father this is what God say he's the
[2:11:41] head you find that back over in
[2:11:42] Ephesians 5 God has a purpose he has a
[2:11:45] order that he was established do you
[2:11:47] realize in the Garden of Eden
[2:11:48] it was Eve who sinned first but do you
[2:11:53] also realize that God did not come down
[2:11:56] until Adam got involved and you know
[2:12:03] what happened when he came down he knew
[2:12:06] Yvette said first but you know God
[2:12:08] Koffler you know God asked for when he
[2:12:11] came he didn't say nothing about Eve Eve
[2:12:15] read the Bible Adam Adam where art thou
[2:12:22] see Adam was held responsible for what
[2:12:25] happened in the garden can I tell you
[2:12:27] something man are held responsible what
[2:12:30] happens in their families not only that
[2:12:32] the man are held responsible what
[2:12:34] happens in the church all right let me
[2:12:42] finish this stuff oh Jesus Jesus
[2:12:47] brothers can I invite y'all to do
[2:12:49] something live a life that's so godly
[2:12:51] before your wife that she don't mind
[2:12:53] calling you my lord but when you live in
[2:12:59] this old
[2:12:59] Towton life she came to pin on you for
[2:13:05] nothing
[2:13:05] she don't save my lord she say my lord
[2:13:10] I want to call y'all up as men a man I
[2:13:17] want to call you up as men you have a
[2:13:19] responsibility these are some some
[2:13:22] things that I read out of a book and I
[2:13:23] just want to share them with you as a
[2:13:27] man you can be a chain breaker rather
[2:13:29] than a chain maker can I say that again
[2:13:32] you can be a chain breaker rather than a
[2:13:36] chain maker you can break the chains of
[2:13:39] alcohol and drug addiction you can break
[2:13:41] the chains of womanizing you can break
[2:13:44] the chains of rebelling against God you
[2:13:46] can break the chains of faithlessness
[2:13:49] see you start the legacy of faith you
[2:13:53] start the legacy of faithfulness and
[2:13:55] this brings blessings to your children
[2:13:58] let me tell you something when children
[2:14:01] see daddy involved that's when they tend
[2:14:04] to get involved you know when we were
[2:14:09] coming up and daddy was going to church
[2:14:11] but that was the easy thing to use well
[2:14:14] you know daddy's trying to force us into
[2:14:16] the church I've more time blowing me he
[2:14:17] got me in my brother one time what he
[2:14:19] got us good dad everyone going to church
[2:14:21] the week we follow his example that
[2:14:24] ain't going well I really want to go
[2:14:25] either
[2:14:25] I mean I see daddy kind of hanging out
[2:14:27] in the house little stumpy I think I
[2:14:28] want to hang out on the household stuff
[2:14:29] and one day dad is that you go to church
[2:14:32] and God I they start walking with my
[2:14:34] mother church and you know and back then
[2:14:36] it was it was it wasn't cool to walk to
[2:14:39] church not in church too low you all
[2:14:41] your buddies know what you're doing
[2:14:42] right so you know we we we we say we
[2:14:45] told my dad we'll we'll catch up with
[2:14:46] y'all you know me and my brother stayed
[2:14:49] back we'll catch up with y'all let the
[2:14:50] rest of the family go but we ain't
[2:14:52] walking with your no church now that
[2:14:54] one's gonna be that one the way it's
[2:14:55] gonna go down not with us well we have
[2:15:00] we stay around house a little bit too
[2:15:02] long all of a sudden daddy don't slip
[2:15:06] back at the house and and daddy open up
[2:15:09] the door one and when you open up the
[2:15:11] dough all that had to do is just let
[2:15:13] that belt jingle just a little bit
[2:15:16] we knew what that meant right and if we
[2:15:19] leave it we don't we got dressed smokers
[2:15:23] we've had the house of no time wanted to
[2:15:26] get to church I'm gonna tell you mama
[2:15:28] would have come back it might have been
[2:15:29] a little trouble but there's something
[2:15:32] about when daddy
[2:15:36] from daddy takes his position and daddy
[2:15:40] does what God has called him to do it
[2:15:43] changes the dynamics of the family you
[2:15:50] know even in this church we got broken
[2:15:51] families but you know what that still
[2:15:53] don't take the responsibility way from
[2:15:54] daddy especially if he's a godly man I'm
[2:15:58] gonna tell you you can't leave your
[2:15:59] family unless you following God that's
[2:16:04] the only gonna be believe your families
[2:16:05] when you following God so and I don't
[2:16:08] put it out there follow God with
[2:16:09] everything you got give them everything
[2:16:10] give them everything be faithful and
[2:16:12] everything matters you ain't got that
[2:16:13] much responsibility you ought to be
[2:16:16] given more to God than you ever gave it
[2:16:18] for when your responsibilities change
[2:16:22] then you're just with it
[2:16:24] listen when children see daddy involved
[2:16:26] they tend to get involved when children
[2:16:28] see their father is faithful to his
[2:16:30] marriage vows and they also want to
[2:16:32] follow the example when girls see the
[2:16:34] faithfulness of the father to their mom
[2:16:36] then they desire to have a similar
[2:16:38] marriage a man amen
[2:16:42] it's okay for the kids to see daddy kiss
[2:16:46] mama I rather see your kids were rather
[2:16:51] see daddy kiss mama doesn't see daddy
[2:16:53] hit mama when the girls see faithfulness
[2:17:01] from their father to their mom then they
[2:17:03] desire to have a similar marriage when
[2:17:06] daddy goes to work faithfully and brings
[2:17:07] home the money I thank God my dad was
[2:17:10] with him type of dad as he brought home
[2:17:11] the money I only remember one time in
[2:17:14] our lifetime once where the water was
[2:17:17] turned off
[2:17:18] I'd only remember at once and the reason
[2:17:21] I remember it was because my dad turned
[2:17:24] it back on
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:31] maybe showing us
[2:17:37] well that's to the sidewall lift it up a
[2:17:40] little stuff I just ain't got the money
[2:17:45] not but I'm a pain y'all and dad goes
[2:17:56] work faithfully brings home the money
[2:17:57] that sets the pattern for children one
[2:18:04] time I pulled my nephew to the side
[2:18:06] because I don't want to teach him how to
[2:18:07] say that this is what you aiming for
[2:18:11] excellent show me his check
[2:18:14] you made from his look at this job you
[2:18:17] know he was happy I remember one time he
[2:18:19] walked round say my wallet is big and
[2:18:28] you've realized how much money you got
[2:18:29] in your wallet when when you go out to
[2:18:31] dinner for Father's Day or Mother's Day
[2:18:32] and the bill comes and you see you got
[2:18:36] it I got half you ain't got it yet but
[2:18:45] uh you know he was like my wallet is
[2:18:46] thick you know he you know had all these
[2:18:49] Warren's in there so you know I pulled
[2:18:54] him to the side and I haven't telling
[2:18:57] about it just close the door behind us
[2:18:59] and I went into the room and I pulled
[2:19:00] that one of my check stubs and I showed
[2:19:03] it to him oh I say the reason I showed
[2:19:08] this to you because I want you striving
[2:19:11] to do better than this this is the goal
[2:19:14] I want you to do better and you keep
[2:19:19] that in his hand and he keeps driving
[2:19:23] and he coming to it I heard somebody
[2:19:26] call him the first Wesco billionaire
[2:19:30] you'll walk into it walked right into it
[2:19:34] but as a man I want the establish
[2:19:36] certain things for this is your goal
[2:19:39] yeah your wallet think now but it can be
[2:19:42] thicker and only that why are you
[2:19:45] getting Y well it thick keep God first
[2:19:53] that's how I got my wallet thing I paid
[2:19:56] time offering that's how my wallet got
[2:20:00] things and then when it got a little
[2:20:03] less my knees were still mad all right
[2:20:10] let me go on the father's take action
[2:20:13] become the men that God has called them
[2:20:15] to be then they earned the right to pull
[2:20:17] the facemask of their children when they
[2:20:19] see them going astray a father can look
[2:20:22] at son in the face and ask where did you
[2:20:24] get that bad habit from them because you
[2:20:27] most certainly did not get it from me
[2:20:31] what makes change is that when we fail
[2:20:35] to live godly lives before our families
[2:20:37] that would create panels for future hurt
[2:20:39] and destruction these are hard decisions
[2:20:42] but they're important for the success of
[2:20:45] future generations
[2:20:53] I haven't changed it I'm a pre for one
[2:20:55] more battle later on I gotta preach that
[2:20:58] the day I got that to preach later on
[2:21:00] but today just call it father's thinking
[2:21:03] that's for the father's just a little
[2:21:05] something that to encourage and
[2:21:06] strengthen and and call to action a man
[2:21:10] aa daddy's a man of those that desire
[2:21:13] someday be father's they meant I trust
[2:21:15] that you got something that helped you
[2:21:17] along the way
[2:21:19] hey man let's pray let's pray father we
[2:21:21] thank you for your word we are we
[2:21:30] realize as men there's a tremendous
[2:21:34] responsibility that is on our shoulders
[2:21:37] and God as men we cannot shirk it we
[2:21:41] can't run from mistakes that we have
[2:21:45] made we have to own it we have to live
[2:21:49] up to it then we have to outlive a man
[2:21:53] in the past and God my prayers that you
[2:21:57] would give each one strength and to be
[2:21:59] who you have called them to be
[2:22:01] the devil is certainly there to to hold
[2:22:05] it all over their head but you're the
[2:22:07] God of second chances so father we pray
[2:22:10] that you would ripen all the ropes and
[2:22:14] that you would show us our place in you
[2:22:17] and what you've called us a man to be
[2:22:20] and and God as we as we walk in there as
[2:22:23] men get into the place that you call
[2:22:25] them then you will see that everybody
[2:22:28] else falls in line the wife father lying
[2:22:30] the children fall in line because
[2:22:32] because dad is in his place so God our
[2:22:36] prayer is that with with the
[2:22:41] responsibility hat that we return to you
[2:22:43] you told us to turn to you when we're
[2:22:46] heavy lead to God when we're burning
[2:22:50] down told us to bring our problems that
[2:22:53] lay them at your feet because Lord your
[2:22:57] burdens are light that's what you told
[2:22:59] us so help us Lord to realize that
[2:23:03] above all fathers even if we have not
[2:23:07] had a father figure in our life you are
[2:23:11] the father of all fathers and we can
[2:23:14] follow your example you've laid things
[2:23:16] out according to your word and we would
[2:23:18] just live according to that it'll work
[2:23:22] out just fine
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] so help us O God is our prayer each
[2:23:29] father I pray that you bless them Lord
[2:23:32] many might go back through their miles
[2:23:35] and just think of different things that
[2:23:36] they could have done differently along
[2:23:38] the way but God I just prayed it to help
[2:23:40] them to see that where they are right
[2:23:41] now you have ordained for them to be and
[2:23:45] that nothing happens by chance nothing
[2:23:47] happens by mistake all things work
