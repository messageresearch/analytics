surprised i'm here the lord just made her way and when the pastor announced we're going to have some meetings in florida he said those who want to go he didn't say those who are going you say those who want to go so i stayed with the meeting even though i knew i didn't have a single penny for it so i stayed with the meeting and as the month progressed i just said if the lord wants me to go i'm going to be there and i kept saying how can you have meetings in florida without me [Laughter] and everyone was buying their tickets they were having meetings preparing and i was saying how can you go to grandpa wisco's birthday without me i'm gonna be there but i didn't have money and then on sunday because i said if the lord wants me to go i will go and then on sunday i decided i'm gonna go and i checked the tickets they were crazy expensive 1.2 pounds per person 1 200 pounds and my husband are saying just go and say 1 200 that's a lot and he kept saying you just go and i said no 1200 pounds is just too much and i called my easter egg my travel agent he's saying you're not gonna go anywhere it's expensive now and i said okay that's fine now this was sunday night and then i sent sister ruth checkers a message i said i want to go to west palm beach now find me a ticket for 500 pounds if you find me that i'll go but don't tell anyone in case it doesn't work out so monday morning she sent me a link i look at it the tickets made 312. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so so now i was panicking i was so excited i was running around in the house bunny king i'm like 312 from 1 200. i called my husband i said baby tickets 312 he's like really we're all going [Laughter] [Music] and i say you know when when um i'm gonna be like one of the four lepers when god has blessed you you extend the blessing i called sister pandey i said friend chickens are cheap we're going she's like no i'm like we're going and she's here [Applause] so yeah so by the time we bought tickets monday night they were 279 from 1 200. [Applause] [Music] so we're so thankful for that and number two like i said you kind of bring powers was better without me i knew pastor wesker when i was 13 that's 26 years ago don't calculate my age i saw him on a dvd and he had preached so much i was only 13. you preached so much it pricked my heart that was when i was back in zimbabwe and he sang the song it's already done and at that time where i was brother wesker was a tv person i never knew i would see him in person but god just made a way in so many times and i've seen him and i'm only too glad i can share his 80th birthday and be happy and say god bless you grandpa god bless you [Music] so i'm just gonna sing the song hope it will be a blessing to you and i know grandpa is also saying thank you lord for his birthday god bless

everyone don't worry it's already good it's a good afternoon [Music] standing before you is just the grace of god maybe before we go into any details let me just start by praying [Music] precious father thou art the maker we are the clay the same yesterday today and forever [Music] the same god who said let there be in the wash father we come before your holy throne of mess this afternoon not because we are able but thou art able you saw this day before the foundation of everything as we come lord bowing before you we shout within our house we say praise be to god we will worship you dear father no matter what situation we are in because you have made a promise unto us that you are the giver of every good gift lord i commit your church into your hands these are the fruits of the message and father you know each one by their names you know each one by their secret clothes [Music] this opportunity that you have given me to stand before your people lord peradventure there's somebody who's going to be encouraged but what is going to proceed out of these lips of clay father i commit myself into your hands i am feeble but thou art strong may you strengthen me in this general salvation even as i start to say my testimony yes lord i start to develop goose pimples around me because you took me there and i've got a revelation i want to thank you and commit the congregation once again into your hands in jesus name we pray and believe amen [Applause] [Music] i hope i'm not going to ask for much i'll ask brother joseph to come up and sing my special song close

danger this is my destiny song all right hallelujah i'm going to ask you to take your seats i'm going to say to you my testimony what god ordained me to pass through on the 17th of june 2021 this song that we are singing is a song that i love so much it's a song which when i sing it even if when i'm in my lowest air i would rise up i would feel the fibers of strength coming back to me let me start by saying i have four girls and one boy the boy is called isaac he came after a long time the girl before isaac was a restoration we had a child who are still born but god saw it fit to give us another girl not that i'm being judgmental to my children but when i look at these two that i've mentioned they mean a lot to me because of what i passed through getting into my testimony i believe it is going to esteem or provoke somebody who was just about to give up my last week in church during the month of june 2021 was a sunday before the 17th of june it all started on the month of may i grew a desire of this song that we have just seen i'm running a small business of a franchise big in england every time i sing this song it has never happened in my life i'll start to cry not me opening of mouth crying but shedding tears and i was shaking i thought maybe there were emotions but this song i could hear it being sung somewhere and i could join in then the moment i joined in i would always cry i got to a point one time when i was driving i came to the traffic lights and i was singing this song and i started to cry hysterically and when i was checking with the corner of my eye on my next driver was on my right she was a white lady she was she had noticed that i was crying she was giving me a sign of saying lower down your window i want to talk to you and i want to help you but i knew she couldn't understand what i was passing through i got to a situation where i said lord what is this that is happening to my life to me i was in a state of confusion sometimes if i sing it i would check like you know i don't i couldn't understand then it came to my heart to say maybe god was just about to take me this is in the month of may so every i didn't tell my wife i didn't tell my children i've got two married girls back home in in england so one day when i came back from work they were upstairs in our in their rooms and i was in my bedroom together with their mom they just started to sing that song i said do these people understand and know how this song is affecting me so i'm a man who doesn't want to be seen crying in front of my children or my wife so i quickly dashed down the steps to the kitchen they were singing it so melodiously and so harmoniously it shook me very much and i was crying there then i went up after they had sung it this is the month of may then i said well let me text brother joseph our song leader i said brother joseph i'm kindly asking you to sing this song for me you said by all means brother steve that very sunday that he was supposed to sing he visited another message church and the song was not signed i said fairing fine the second week i reminded him then he said it will be done but the holy ghost on that day took us on a tangent and that song was never sung the third week the same thing happened but then the fourth week brother joseph said today we are going to sing your song he's saying it i was sitting on the corner on the side of the church something upon my heart said all is done i felt like a stone being removed from my heart then now i became a scared person i was now being meticulous in every way where i go or whatever i do unbeknown to my wife and children but on my own i was just a scared person there's one thing that i always do i always take my god to task if i want anything from him i always first start by reminding him that i did not volunteer to become a christian i always approached him with that kind of mentality then i said lord i know something is fixing to happen to my life can you reveal it to me the moment i said that fear came upon my heart because i knew he is a gentleman yield possibly reveal it to me but i was scared of the truth i said i would rather remain blinded and walk into the program of god without knowing it one time i thought of telling my pastor then i said let me hold fire i continued with my daily life but always being alert i thought maybe the enemy was going to come from this side i was just walking a scared person then came the 17th of june 2021 i said to my wife goodbye i'm going to work is normal left for work when i went to work at work they normally they give me a name the name is pastor stevia scam so normally when they are sharing their daily talks they stop so either i sing or i whistle so i used to whistle this song on my waking area and that morning it was just a peculiar morning i was facing the east whistling sorting out whatever i was i wanted to do and i sang that song for a good five minutes and when i look back colleagues where colleagues were standing there listening some they said we know you are a christian but the way of sing that song makes us as well to be christian then i said to them so be it after that i felt a what spell of air coming upon myself i started to sweat then i walked out i thought what's what's happening in my life when i walked out i came back a refreshed person had taken off my fleece jacket and left it in the van i came back finished everything that i wanted to do then i said goodbye to my friends i drove off when i was working now out there that day was so peculiar let me just say this junction my brothers my sisters when your day comes you will know it there is no shade of doubt about it when your day comes you will know it i drove around 12 midday i started to feel dizzy my sight was a bit blurry and i had a sharp and excruciating headache the headache was starting from here going backwards i never felt any pain in front of me i normally have a problem of acid if i eat a lot of roasted meat and spices then i thought maybe let me just ask for a glass of water from any of the neighborhood so i stopped first at a certain house and knocked the white lady came out she was taking taken aback when she looked at me i said what is it that i have developed on my face then i said can i have a glass of meal she quickly said no i don't have a glass of milk again she closed the door i went back to my van i looked at myself to see if maybe there were some changes on my physical appearance then i said no i'll go to another house i knocked on the other house a man came out i said please can i have a glass of milk then he said okay all day he ran into his house opened the fridge poured a glass of milk for me he said there you are you can even take the glass with you i said fair and fine i took the milk went and sit down then i started to vomit and vomiting but the vomiting was not normal i said i've never i've never vomited like this i was i was halfway with my job but now the pain was getting worse let me say this at the same time me and my son isaac when we get into any problem if i pick up the phone and tell my pastor brother whisper to say this is the problem that i have if he prays it's a done deal brother and sister it is important to recognize your pastors these are ordained men of god i'm not saying this because my pastor is there i'll say it during his absence he is my shepherd who make me to see the kingdom of heaven the same applies with my son my son would say dad don't pray for me call brother whisper then would call brother whisper at times i'll feel does my son belittle me with my faith but i then learned to respect his feelings so when i got to a place where i thought i was now cornered during that day i sat down in my van i actually texted my pastor and said pastor i'm not feeling well i looked on my phone it ticked twice and i realized that he had read the message so when i sat down i took a little nap in the meantime he tried to phone me but i didn't hear the phone when i woke up i checked my phone and it was in bold letters the message that he sent me said i have dealt with the devil and his we are done with him i said praise god the moment i saw that strength came back to me there was one thing upon my heart i said to god lord i'm not a cheap person the message that i have believed is not cheap neither are you cheap as well i don't want to die a cheap person make me drive my van to the depot and park it and when my family comes to reclaim my goods they can find them at one place i then i think i phoned the pastor i texted again i said pastor i have not told my family the situation in which i am lest they panic this is a discussion between a man to man the pastor said i'll honor your word now it was now upon myself to drive my van from where i was to the depot it was just gonna take me 10 minutes but that journey took me about 40 minutes i could not see i could even hear wands behind me beeping at me because i was driving a radical but then i said lord i said i'm not a cheap person let me go and pack my stuff and after that do as you please when i was in that situation because the the pain was getting worse i said well i told the pastor that don't tell my family but then i said i think it's honorable for a man when you are living this earth to speak for the last time to your wife i texted her but it was during a school run she couldn't see the message so after that i was wondering why is did she not reply me then i phoned then i said did you my message so from the tone of my voice she could realize that there was something wrong she then said okay let me cut the phone and revisit your message my message to you was i'm not feeling well my pastor had prayed then i thought i needed reinforcement brother whispers spoke to you about brother mike mulotti he prays for the sick i said to my wife can you get in touch with brother mike mdot to pray for me from nowhere the phone to zimbabwe was not a problem it was just a one click of the button and brother mike picked up the phone and we went into a conference call and he said brother steve what's wrong i said brother i'm not feeling well then he said okay let me pray he prayed after he prayed he said it's done i said to myself i've heard two powerful prayers one from my pastor one from my fellow brother and brother mike if i'm to go let me go on those two prayers to heaven this time i was no longer fearful certain courage came from somewhere and i said i'm ready to face my fate when i told my wife that then they went home then they said we need to drive to where you are to drive to where i was i was 14 miles away from them right in central london they said let's call an ambulance they found an ambulance as you all know i don't know whether this that's the same behavior they have they say this is not an emergency yes then they said we are not coming then my daughter ruth righteous indignation came upon me then she said what is it that then you call emergency she grilled here them because my wife was controlling the car driving until then until when they said okay we'll reconcile that they're coming from home coming to my workplace in the meantime the pastor is checking with my wife what the situation is because i was no longer in a position to speak or answer the phone when i got to the depot when my general manager saw me he was taken aback when he looked at me he said there's something terrible going on what's wrong i said i don't know he said okay let's call for an ambulance they call the ambulance same story they were told that's not an emergency case then the general manager said i am going to take a risk if you are to die you're going to die in my car i'm going to put you into my car by then i had a stiff neck i could not turn i could not bend my back as well was stiff the only way they could put me in the in their car at the back seat was to lie me down first and they grabbed the head here the legs there and they put me through the back seat in the meantime my wife and my three children are driving to come to the hospital the hospital that i was going to go was very near it's one of the best hospitals and it's called king's college hospital i want you to mark my words as i'm saying this statement as we were driving the general manager is not asking me how are you feeling he's saying steve are you still alive i was just saying yes we drove it was during peak hour a lot of traffic was there we managed to get to the hospital and when we got to the hospital you know the state of hospital the parking you cannot find any parking and if you just park your car anyway the clumping people just come and clamp your car and they take it but that manager said called the security man and he said i've got an image of the case with me i'm going to leave my car here if you think of towing it up it's entirely up to you there was we went straight to the a and e when we got there there was a massive queue this time they are just holding me the other person on this one the security men on this one they are actually dragging me then when we got to the front of the queue they said we are not going to follow the queue we would rather jump the queue we asked for permission from a certain lady who was in front when she looked at me she said please by all means get yourself sorry that was the assessment room where i went first in there the nurse is communicating with the doctors where i'm going to go i could not sit the only thing i could do was to lie on the bench but with i'm lying i'm looking direct at a to read a bit of a body language and to try and understand what they are saying because i don't know what was upon me but from the talk that i gathered it was an emergency case she's looking at me so that i cannot hear what she's saying she took about four or five minutes then after that immediately i was put in a wheelchair wasted up into the first floor when i got to the first floor on the corner i saw a resuscitating machine there were about three four nurses there and about four or five doctors the moment i went in it was like they are receiving a parcel they thronged me put me on the bed each one working on this each one working on this i was standing right left right center within a few minutes my whole body had all causing wires attached and everything some are knocking me under my feet with a little mallet some are knocking my spinal cord so i'm attaining everything they were just doing the best they could do by then i was in such a pain i've always said if i was a woman i would say the pain that i was going through was more than the pain of being pregnant but i've never been a woman our sins i was in such excruciating pain my wife arrived at the hospital i'm in the assessment room there and the children as well they've arrived there's pandemonium down there the children are crying left right center they've been told my first bone sharon has come my other daughter sonia was still at a house they are there they are crying let me say my wife is a woman who normally breaks easily you could be seated in the sitting room maybe watching something or if say an advert appears on the telly of children who are suffering you'll see a cry sometimes i want to say don't embarrass us but i know she's a weaker vessel my wife she easily cries that sometimes even the children say mama you cry a lot but that day when the children were crying she had the audacity and power to say this is not the time to cry [Applause] if you want to cry you go out of the hospital and you stay there i don't want anyone who is going to cry here this is a hearsay because i'm in my own world my other name is miranda it means comfort in short she calls me munya so when i was there when she came she came she brought a big pillow fire and a small one then she said i might have run ahead but i want you to catch this then she said she pronounced because me i had purpose to say that this is the end of my journey but when she stood she's saying munya you are not going anywhere i refuse you are not going anywhere god will grant you the desires of your heart [Applause] in the observation room i don't know how she sneaked in during that time it was the time of covid but she sneaked in right she's on the corner time is gone maybe it's around 12 midnight the doctors are still working on me then after a while then she said when are you going to finish and everybody turned to say we have a visitor in here say what are you doing here he says i am the husband of that man says you're not even supposed to be here then she said well i'm in already. my my brother my sister marriage comes from god it's a divine thing the wife that we have is your perfect rib she is the one that will stand with you through thick and thin when they've took me down me i was now in my own world from the first floor they are now taking me to the ward that way i met my children but in a strange way this is a reported speech this is what they told me i started to say to every child goodbye i'm going then instead of facing them i gave them my back maybe it was a sign that i didn't want them to realize the pain i was going through so we went into the into my ward room then when we got in there my wife took the pillow fire she said she said she whispered to me say i've brought the prayer cloth and the pillow fire big one and small one then when we were in there we have another big testimony of about oh for brother gerald gondora i think most of you might know it he was delivered out of corvid when he had went into intensive care where we thought it was a point of no return then my wife said the god who yielded brother gerald gondora is the same god that is going to heal you she is talking to somebody who is half the half away the doctors then came then they said we don't know how your husband has managed to survive your husband is acute meningitis the bacteria was already surrounding my brain membrane ready to pounce on the brain they said if i delayed by just five minutes that was the end of me they said they were also amazed to see how i was reciprocating to the medication that they had given me they put about three on this side three on this side antibiotics and everything they wanted to make sure that this was meningitis when they were satisfied they asked me have you been to africa i said no have you been to this place i said no how come then you contacted this i said i don't even know when we went into my room my wife took the small pillow fire she put it on my headboard the big one she was holding it and the dosage that i was being given to his pain was morphine they were giving me morphine but it was not helping i don't know how i can explain the pain that i went through but then something within me deep inside of me was telling me all is well i remember my wife when she came she started to sing a song what was the song the great physician is here out of my conscious she said i started to sing as well the great physician is here for sure the great physician was there i am in there they are coming the doctors are coming in and checking on me now where we i am going to go now is where possibly most of you are going to be helped i went into hospital on the 17th of june the morning of the 18th i went into deep sleep signs of god what i am telling you is sure as i'm holding my bible is what transpired in my life when i went into that deep sleep i saw a chariot a chariot with three angels always when i get to this part it's so direct to me i'll say it anyhow one was in front the other one on the right the other one on the left with a buggy they did not speak to me all they did was they came direct to me you don't even say if you come for me because i knew they had come for me they opened the door the doors were opening from outside the other one is in front the other one is on the left and the other one is on the right so the one on the right opened the doors of the chariot for me they gave me a robe pure white robe they dressed me they ushered me i don't think the respect of the politicians of this country to the president of this country i can't equate it with that because i was treated as a royal when they opened the doors for me there's no conversation they ushered me i went in i sat in the middle one angel on my left the other one on my right the one in front of me was now leading us and we started to take off it was a journey close to thee started to be sad it started to be sung and we were going and we were going the tunnel in which we were going was so bright it was like a galaxies of stars and together with the sun you could pick a needle from the end of that building from it was so crystal clear i could hear another tunnel which was so dark i could hear screams there when i looked on the sides of the tunnel saints listen to this the messages that my pastors preached were clearly written in bold red and their deaths were there the messages that i have listened of the prophets they were surrounding me the little messages that i have preached myself they were going there i was being encamped encompassed by the word i said my joy filled my heart and we were going close to thee was being signed close to b was being being sung i'm sure the majority of you have been in trains in a train you know when a train is about to stop there is this tweaking sound of breaks that's exactly what happened but i want to tell you it was a journey when we arrived the brakes started to squeak and when we arrived the angels came down all all three the one in front this one he opened this door and he stood there this one opened the door for me and i came out like a dignitary patterned up myself like you know when you're being ushered out and when i stepped out my brother my sister this message that we have believed is taking us to heaven when i got there i've never seen a beautiful place in my life right now maybe it's limited to my vocabulary i cannot even describe it it only takes you as an individual to go and see for yourself when i stepped out i i was welcomed like with about say a stadium four stadiums of people each stadium possibly a hundred thousand of people what they did is when i stepped out they started to utilize and they their hands were going up in air they were singing rejoicing saying welcome welcome welcome by then i had there was peace within me there was peace within me then i started to walk towards the big entrance when i walked there there was an age for me to look back i took two steps i was left with one step to enter into glory i looked back then i saw a vision of my wife my son isaac my daughter faith and my other daughter ruth they were looking at me they were not complaining but it was like are you sure you're going then i stopped get me clear i did not see god it was just a voice coming so brother when he says god design yours it is true there was an age in me that said it seems as if you've got something to say i said yes i said lord can you give me another chance i need to go back and see my children grow the reply was your word is honored i turned back into the same bag the angels opened the doors for me i stepped in close to the started to sing again it was a journey send messages in bold red and their dates sons of god these ministers when they stand to minister here when they stand to minister catch the revelation that's the word that has been ordained to take you into glory land we came back to earth then i woke up at 2 am 2 am was the same time when the nurses would come in and change the drips my whole body was wet where i was sleeping it was wet i sat on the edge of the bed and when the nurse came in said this is time to change your medication took the bp machine to take me the machine read zero she took the thermometer to check my temperature it read zero she started to panic she said i'm going to get two liters of water i want you to drink water right now i said why says there's something wrong with you there's nothing responding within you me i'm always wait and i'm sitting on the edge i said no don't worry i'm okay it says no way she almost hit the panic button so that other nurses will come in she's running she for the second time the machine were not working then i had gathered a little bit of myself then i said can you go and change that machine she said i cannot change it it's working i'm just coming out of the other patient that's the same machine i used in this way i said listen to me please just go and change the machine then out of nowhere she went and she changed the machine she came back she put it on me started to work she looked at me she said i don't know what i can say i said what's wrong she said you don't know if a patient dies during your duty you have no explanation you didn't have any temperature you didn't have any blood readings i said don't worry if i explain to you you won't understand that was that during that morning to a morning my room was had some kind of a glass mirror where the nurse would come and peep whether the person is okay that night that nurse never slept all she was doing was i could see it she would come on that small window and shoot with it he would look at me then i would wave back at you and say no no everything is all right in the morning the visiting time was 2 to 8 pm 2 pm to 8 pm but my wife would come even at 8 and 10 and she would just walk in defy everybody and she would stand there she's there seated there and me possibly i'm unconscious and i'm sleeping like that the pill of fire is there i then started to gain myself back myself gradually and gradually one morning my wife had visited me a certainness came in she said wow what's wrong with this room we thought maybe we'd done something i said nothing said no way i've never felt peace peace and tranquility of all the words the atmosphere in this room is different i would rather resort myself to work in this room than any other world amen i said to myself praise god another lady came in she saw the pillow fire she asked my wife what is that they were asking about the prophet who is that we're saying that's our prophet what's that is the pillar of fire then the other lady said is it the same pill of fire that led the children of israel out of egypt my wife said yes says i'm not going to touch it i respect it very much when this first lady said there's peace in this room then i said lord i want a confirmation let somebody come in as well and say the same for sure another nurse came in the following day and she said there's something peculiar about this room this in this room there is peace there is such an atmosphere what is it i said we are children of god now every morning there was a pandemonium outside they would usually come the two of them one on this side of the bed the other one behind helping each other to spread but the one who comes in would tell the one who was going to help you say don't worry don't come i'll manage the bed on my own i just saw the hand of god i just saw the hand of god and after that then there was satan started to try to stand in our way there was a some blood samples that had been taken and the results were not even coming the rest were coming but that one only it took almost about maybe seven days then the it came but during my stay in there i'm just sitting with my wife where remember the doctors that said this was a contagious disease but it was only thursday and i'm sitting there i'm talking to my wife whom do i see i saw a tall man coming into my wood and the tall man was none other than brother whisper man i said brother why did you bother to come i'm now okay we could talk over the phone says no that's my responsibility i'm here for you my brother what he did is then he took his bible after some fellowship he opened isaiah 54 in psalms 118 for me and he already laid his end up on me and i could feel that it was insafians i'm not saying he does it only for me he does it for every ship but i'm just trying to emphasize the point remember he's a man who is used to driving but that time you took a train from where for me to drive to his place i need about one hour but it took a train to come down and when he was actually going he was actually asking my wife where do i connect this train this and that i said lord bless this man of god amen amen for the labors that he does for us i want to thank god for what he made me to pass through i want to thank my pastor for standing with me i want to thank him and his wife i want to thank my wife who declared that you steve you are not going anywhere i want to thank god for honoring my way to say lord yet another time i want to see my children grow up and he has granted me that the reason why i have shared you shared with you this testimony is maybe there was somebody who is fearing or somebody who is just about to let go don't let go god is still business with you with that little testimony i'll say god bless you so much amen [Applause] we want to do justice to the word of god okay never a full service if we don't read the word of god close to thee close to thee close to thee [Music] close to thee as we rise

that then it's going the other way so when it's landing i always look down and say lord you have been the pilot you have been the engineer you are saving us food here for the sake of the philistines who are here because of me being in the plane may you save us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah with the soul ever thou goest even if we are going for an interview hallelujah remember this scripture
