[45:53] and then on the on the seventh day seven
[45:55] times that was the 13 there and walls
[45:58] came down
[45:59] this morning we got to this 14th prayer
[46:01] there was an anointing in this place
[46:04] good god almighty
[46:07] and

[56:56] memories um you know brother caleb was
[56:59] the one before when we i was telling him
[57:02] this on yesterday i said um
[57:05] when it came to the other church that we
[57:07] were at in green acres because green
[57:08] acres is the place to be
[57:14] and we were there
[57:17] worshiping and you know just a few of us
[57:19] just a few of us i want to say
[57:22] 30 maybe something like that
[57:25] and um
[57:27] our rent was about
[57:30] eighteen hundred dollars a month with
[57:32] them thirty people
[57:34] and
[57:35] so i knew that this space had become
[57:37] available driven by here like man it's a
[57:40] bus that used to be outside and where
[57:42] are you at they're not there i said that
[57:43] place is available so i said we'd come
[57:45] and
[57:46] start entertaining you know just talking
[57:48] with the uh the landlord and
[57:50] they wanted 3 500 a month for it and i
[57:54] was saying from 18 to 35 i'm getting a
[57:56] double with 30 people
[57:59] i said lord i don't know about this it's
[58:01] just going to be tough
[58:03] i don't know god i don't want to put the
[58:04] people at pressure
[58:06] i don't want to come and ask for an
[58:07] extra offering

[58:20] the lord and just really not sure which
[58:22] way to go so brother brother caleb
[58:24] coming he preaching on the inspiration
[58:25] he said brother jack
[58:27] the lord said you leaned in in a
[58:29] particular direction says go he'll be
[58:31] with you
[58:33] and uh he says go forward in that
[58:34] direction he'll be with you and i just
[58:36] broke down crying i say lord i'm gonna
[58:37] take you at your word
[58:39] and 13 years ago

[1:07:17] little bit while i greet you in the name
[1:07:19] of the lord and uh i'll let you
[1:07:22] i'll let you go this time so
[1:07:24] you're all right and i really
[1:07:27] really really appreciated that uh all
[1:07:29] the specials and the singing and the
[1:07:31] worship the song leader and i appreciate
[1:07:34] the worship that's going on now maybe
[1:07:35] they just keep the spirit moving for us
[1:07:37] uh i one time i was at a we were at a a
[1:07:41] convention and they were having a
[1:07:42] psychic convention next door
[1:07:45] at the same time that we were having
[1:07:46] service and i thought i wonder what kind
[1:07:48] of vibrations they're feeling right now
[1:07:50] and i started going like that and you
[1:07:52] could tell things got real quiet over
[1:07:53] there i said everybody put up your hands
[1:07:55] and just in faith just push it back and
[1:07:57] they were doing like that and i don't
[1:07:58] know what happened but they ended their
[1:07:59] little session early and i think that
[1:08:02] our our faith kind of interfered with
[1:08:03] their little signal so
[1:08:06] it was kind of funny you know but it
[1:08:08] started off as a joke and i said no
[1:08:09] seriously i wonder what they can feel
[1:08:10] right now
[1:08:12] we we know where our power comes from
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] amen amen
[1:08:17] we don't got to work it up it just flows
[1:08:19] is that right it just flows amen in
[1:08:21] tucson i've been accused of being a
[1:08:23] cheerleader or a mic boy and working
[1:08:25] people up and i go you know when it's in
[1:08:27] you you ain't got to work nobody up you
[1:08:29] know just because i say say amen i said
[1:08:31] i guess i guess you take all the pages
[1:08:34] of the psalms out where david says
[1:08:36] praise the lord praise the lord praise
[1:08:37] the lord praise the lord praise the lord
[1:08:39] if you don't like me saying say amen say
[1:08:41] amen well you know what i tell them say
[1:08:43] amen i won't have to ask you
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:49] right
[1:08:50] come to church awake and i won't have to
[1:08:52] ask you to say amen
[1:08:54] right come in here and praise the lord
[1:08:56] and the tongue leader won't have to tell
[1:08:57] you come on somebody praise the lord
[1:08:59] come on somebody praise the lord he
[1:09:00] shouldn't have to ask you that anyway
[1:09:02] you should be here praising god you
[1:09:03] should walk in praising god
[1:09:06] and you should walk out praising god
[1:09:09] you should be in your car praising god
[1:09:11] you should drive down here praising god
[1:09:14] i flew down here praising god
[1:09:16] come on
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:19] god bless you
[1:09:21] i was telling brother jack i said as a
[1:09:23] testimony i said you know last year in
[1:09:25] 2020 and if you don't mind i'm just
[1:09:27] warming up
[1:09:28] and uh last year in 2020 we had the uh
[1:09:31] second driest monsoon season uh in
[1:09:34] arizona history and you might say well
[1:09:37] it's arizona what do you expect well we
[1:09:38] expect rain at least once in a while and
[1:09:41] we got during the monsoon season it
[1:09:43] rained one time and it wasn't even
[1:09:45] significant and so we were
[1:09:47] it's the west is still in drought uh
[1:09:50] people think because it rains they're
[1:09:51] not in drought anymore but water levels
[1:09:53] is what tells you if you're in drought
[1:09:55] and it's a lot of little things that
[1:09:56] were going on and i told the church it's
[1:09:58] not going to get any better um and it
[1:10:01] that was 2020 and then uh but in january
[1:10:03] the lord had put on my heart i i usually
[1:10:06] uh what we call
[1:10:08] uh what i call make uh uh
[1:10:10] beginning of the year uh prophetic
[1:10:12] statements whatever the lord shows me i
[1:10:14] concentrate myself the day before new
[1:10:16] year's and then on new year's i let the
[1:10:18] lord show me what we're going to expect
[1:10:20] and then i'll get up in the church and
[1:10:21] i'll tell everybody we're going to see
[1:10:22] this this this this and i'm not
[1:10:25] saying that to brag on myself but if my
[1:10:27] name was brother branham you all would
[1:10:28] have no problem with me saying any of
[1:10:29] this right
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:33] i mean i could show you a tape where he
[1:10:34] said god showed me god told me god said
[1:10:36] god said if you got a problem with me
[1:10:38] saying god said then you don't know the
[1:10:40] same god i know because the bible said
[1:10:42] tell them i said tell them i said tell
[1:10:44] them i said tell them i said right all
[1:10:47] through the scriptures come on to the
[1:10:49] man prophesied tell them thus say the
[1:10:51] lord i said i said i said i said
[1:10:54] huh
[1:10:56] all right
[1:10:57] so anyhow well now we got that settled
[1:11:00] uh in 2020 when when this pandemic thing
[1:11:02] started the lord had given me some some
[1:11:05] words of uh prophecy see how we do that
[1:11:07] the lord gave me a little thought
[1:11:09] we we backpedal even after we just talk
[1:11:12] about it god told me to say these things
[1:11:14] now and so i i got up on january the 5th
[1:11:17] and i told the church the lord told me
[1:11:20] personally not to leave the country he
[1:11:22] told me not to get on a plane i don't
[1:11:23] know about the rest of you but y'all do
[1:11:25] what you want he said don't get on the
[1:11:26] plane don't leave the country i see the
[1:11:28] borders closed and i don't know why
[1:11:30] this is before this all happened now
[1:11:32] brother jesse i got a witness this
[1:11:33] morning amen i think your wife ducked
[1:11:36] out before i could say anything
[1:11:38] and uh and anyhow and and so they said
[1:11:41] uh and i said uh i saw i see people
[1:11:44] dying in record numbers and i don't know
[1:11:45] why i said i'm telling you to be careful
[1:11:48] uh uh watch yourselves and whatever you
[1:11:50] get involved in i see the mexican border
[1:11:52] closed the canadian border closed and
[1:11:54] the people are sitting there this is
[1:11:55] january the 5th now go back in your
[1:11:57] history none of this had happened yet
[1:12:00] and i sat there and i said now this is
[1:12:01] does say at the lord we're going to see
[1:12:03] it happen here here here here here and
[1:12:04] here and that's in the meantime hold
[1:12:06] tight i know it's not a great one uh we
[1:12:09] want to hear good things and the lord
[1:12:11] said prosperity and you're going to get
[1:12:12] more money matter of fact come drop your
[1:12:14] money down here and i'll step all over
[1:12:16] it and and you all will be you know and
[1:12:18] i'm like the only guy who gets
[1:12:19] prosperous is you the person stepping
[1:12:21] all over it you know what i would have
[1:12:23] done i had to put my money down as soon
[1:12:24] as he stepped and i said thank you
[1:12:25] brother it's blessed now
[1:12:30] that's that brother a reverend dollar
[1:12:32] that's his name why are you going to
[1:12:33] trust any preacher last name dollar
[1:12:37] i'm just saying
[1:12:40] was that his first name his last name
[1:12:42] dollar bill is that what it is
[1:12:44] reverend dollar bill
[1:12:47] never mind never mind
[1:12:49] first name's benjamin or something like
[1:12:50] this i don't know
[1:12:52] anyhow he was stepping all over the
[1:12:53] money you know come on up here i'll step
[1:12:55] right here to be blessed i said he
[1:12:57] didn't say nothing about leaving it
[1:12:58] there i was watching as i go there those
[1:12:59] people are ignorant i just said step on
[1:13:01] it and take it back
[1:13:03] i might have grabbed a few more
[1:13:05] he's right i got i put down a 50 and
[1:13:08] look what i got
[1:13:14] i could have you know i could have
[1:13:15] prophesied something like that but i'd
[1:13:16] be saying something that wasn't right
[1:13:18] you know and and i i get a reputation of
[1:13:21] being a doomsday uh doomsday profit
[1:13:23] total thing because i'm always saying
[1:13:24] things that are bad and i go no that's
[1:13:26] the only thing you all listen to i've
[1:13:27] said things that are good too but you
[1:13:28] all don't listen
[1:13:30] but they don't want to listen anyhow so
[1:13:31] we watched those things unfold within
[1:13:33] months within weeks we saw it unfold and
[1:13:36] then the uh
[1:13:37] one morning i was uh preaching i stopped
[1:13:40] in the middle of it i said the olympics
[1:13:41] are canceled that's that and i just kept
[1:13:44] on going well i had what they call fact
[1:13:46] checkers in the church they started
[1:13:48] looking it up and they're like it's not
[1:13:49] canceled yet but two days later they got
[1:13:51] canceled and uh they weren't doing it to
[1:13:54] doubt me they were doing it to say well
[1:13:56] did he get you know just want to make
[1:13:57] sure no one could accuse me of having it
[1:13:59] i saw it on the news or whatever i said
[1:14:00] i didn't see nothing i was in the middle
[1:14:01] of preaching i see the olympics are
[1:14:03] cancelled all right let's go on and i
[1:14:05] just kept on preaching two days later it
[1:14:07] was done i'm telling you to tell you
[1:14:08] this that we watch these things progress
[1:14:10] and god has blessed me that way i don't
[1:14:12] know why he chooses to do that i'm not
[1:14:14] trying to be somebody
[1:14:16] but brother jesus said these things that
[1:14:18] i do shall you do in my name so you cast
[1:14:20] out devils etc etc brother branham said
[1:14:22] that over and over and over again to
[1:14:24] vindicate his own ministry and i'm going
[1:14:26] to just tell you jesus said greater
[1:14:28] things shall you do in my name and and
[1:14:30] i'm just saying if we're not that people
[1:14:32] then tell me where they are
[1:14:37] i mean people pentecostal people got no
[1:14:40] no problem listening to these vague
[1:14:41] prophecies they get up there and say i
[1:14:43] see uh something with a something with a
[1:14:45] arizona alaska and arc uh uh
[1:14:49] arkansas are gonna be blessed
[1:14:52] how
[1:14:53] anybody can say that
[1:14:55] th this this city's going to be blessed
[1:14:57] how anybody can say that but give me
[1:15:00] something that's specific and the bride
[1:15:02] has thus said the lord and she keeps
[1:15:04] quiet
[1:15:05] is that right so we watched as things
[1:15:07] progress and i and i told the church
[1:15:08] that we were going to have it was going
[1:15:10] to be dry and it sure was and and then
[1:15:12] at the beginning of 2021 i got up and
[1:15:15] told the church this is going to be the
[1:15:16] wettest monsoon we've seen in a long
[1:15:18] time and then a few days later they
[1:15:20] started predicting that it was going to
[1:15:21] be just as dry as last year
[1:15:24] and i actually told the church like well
[1:15:25] that confuses me because that's not what
[1:15:27] the lord told me
[1:15:28] so we went to praying and i kept getting
[1:15:31] these thoughts
[1:15:32] there will not be no rain or dew from
[1:15:34] heaven till i call for it and i got
[1:15:36] confused i said are you telling me to
[1:15:38] call for it are you going to call for it
[1:15:40] what are you saying so it wasn't so we
[1:15:42] all got collected on this and so here's
[1:15:44] the thing we're not going to pray for
[1:15:46] rain
[1:15:47] we're going to speak rain
[1:15:49] now you all get brother stephen go ahead
[1:15:52] brother stephen told me last night he
[1:15:54] said it rains here all the time sister
[1:15:56] erica said we get eight inches in a day
[1:15:57] and i'm like well well lottie dottie you
[1:16:02] i'm from the desert now
[1:16:04] all right
[1:16:05] i'm from the desert and so we actually
[1:16:07] have to put some faith towards our reign
[1:16:09] and then i got funny and i said you keep
[1:16:11] it up and i'll take that reign from you
[1:16:12] right now
[1:16:15] i think i heard what i'm gonna say
[1:16:16] please do you know
[1:16:18] you don't want that man you know what
[1:16:19] you see how fast everything just dries
[1:16:20] up
[1:16:21] so uh we all got together on it and i
[1:16:23] said okay here's what we're going to do
[1:16:24] from this day on we're all going to
[1:16:26] begin to say it's going to rain today
[1:16:27] it's going to rain today we did that for
[1:16:29] 14 days straight all right i heard you
[1:16:33] 14 days straight and on the 14th day it
[1:16:35] rained
[1:16:36] and then it rained again and it rained
[1:16:38] again and it rained again and now
[1:16:40] they're saying it's not going to stop we
[1:16:42] don't even know where this came from
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:46] i want to go down and say you're welcome
[1:16:49] you're welcome
[1:16:54] if they knew
[1:16:56] that there was a portion of bride in
[1:16:58] tucson that could call for rain
[1:17:01] data called me up in 2020.
[1:17:03] now that's not bragging brother but do
[1:17:05] you have the right to do that
[1:17:07] we have that right to do it
[1:17:10] we're at the end time
[1:17:12] and if you can't call for rain i'm sorry
[1:17:14] for you if you can't stop it i'm sorry
[1:17:17] for you but we have the power in tucson
[1:17:20] and arizona to bring it to stop it to
[1:17:23] dry it how much do you want
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:28] so july went down in history
[1:17:30] as the wettest july in arizona history
[1:17:33] and we we just come to church all puffed
[1:17:35] up you know man because we know that god
[1:17:37] hurt us and so brother jesse decides to
[1:17:40] bring it up a notch and he says well if
[1:17:41] we can call for rain i said here we go
[1:17:45] i'm just asking pastor i mean i don't
[1:17:46] want to see anything out of turn i said
[1:17:48] go ahead what do you want to do he said
[1:17:49] well if we can call for rain why can't
[1:17:50] we make the lord come back
[1:17:53] look how quiet y'all got
[1:17:55] wait a minute now hold on a minute now
[1:17:56] see that that's what i understand why
[1:17:58] did i get an amen out of that
[1:18:01] huh all right why can't we ask not ask
[1:18:04] why can't we speak for the lord to come
[1:18:05] back
[1:18:06] so we have now begun to say every
[1:18:08] morning when we wake up today is the day
[1:18:10] of the lord's return
[1:18:12] so your body begins to change
[1:18:15] you're welcome
[1:18:18] when you're
[1:18:19] when your arthritis is not so rightist
[1:18:22] anymore you're welcome
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:31] the bride knows who she is
[1:18:34] brother smiley when you wake up and you
[1:18:36] got to just put a little brush to that
[1:18:37] fade all of a sudden
[1:18:38] you're welcome
[1:18:40] my brother hears you
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] when all of a sudden you're like uh
[1:18:46] brother caleb said i was young but man i
[1:18:48] i need to go to the store my clothes are
[1:18:49] too big and i'm why am i standing so
[1:18:51] straight
[1:18:52] you're welcome because somebody is going
[1:18:55] to believe this word somewhere
[1:18:58] you know now now i don't got to get no
[1:19:00] credit and i don't want any god gets all
[1:19:02] the glory i hope we all understand that
[1:19:04] but however somebody is going to believe
[1:19:07] god's word
[1:19:08] somebody is going to quit talking about
[1:19:10] what the prophet did
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:15] someone is going to quit bragging on
[1:19:17] brother branham
[1:19:18] they've got to stop bragging on brother
[1:19:20] branham and start to glorify the god
[1:19:23] that was in brother branham
[1:19:25] and realize that that same god is inside
[1:19:28] of you
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:36] and then someone's going to get the idea
[1:19:38] hey i can do that same thing too
[1:19:45] what do you think brother brown would do
[1:19:46] if he came back right now so now caleb
[1:19:48] sit down now that's not no you think
[1:19:49] he'd be coming come on man come on

[1:20:13] that conversation takes place when his
[1:20:15] daddy you know what i'm saying when his
[1:20:17] dad comes back in the resurrection and
[1:20:18] says come here i need to talk to you
[1:20:20] when did i ever say to tell people not
[1:20:22] to listen to pastors or preachers
[1:20:24] look there's going to be some answers

[1:20:32] nobody i want to say listen it's time

[1:20:45] missing it but i'm glad to know when i
[1:20:46] go back it'll still be raining
[1:20:49] and uh we've heard only a few people
[1:20:51] complaining you know on the street and i
[1:20:52] just turn around and say can you
[1:20:53] politely shut up
[1:20:55] you know we don't need any more
[1:20:56] negativity you got too much too many
[1:20:58] people talking now i'm going to try and
[1:21:00] show you something here we didn't ask
[1:21:03] for it we did not pray for it we spoke
[1:21:07] it
[1:21:09] all right

[1:21:14] hello and he goes hey and i go yes sir
[1:21:16] he goes can you all can stop that
[1:21:17] praying now god heard you all right
[1:21:19] because i can't work when you're praying
[1:21:21] i said we're talking about i was praying
[1:21:22] for rain all the time i got to work and
[1:21:24] i laughed and i said well i'd be glad to
[1:21:26] help you but we didn't pray
[1:21:28] and he goes what do you mean i said we
[1:21:29] didn't pray he goes well what'd you do i
[1:21:31] said we spoke it and god heard it and it
[1:21:33] brought it to pass and he goes whatever
[1:21:35] you did stop it
[1:21:38] he was he was joking you know but
[1:21:40] but it's nice to know that they know
[1:21:41] where it came from
[1:21:44] god gets all the glory i hope you
[1:21:45] understand what i'm saying
[1:21:47] see say if it had been you would you be
[1:21:49] brave enough to talk about it this is
[1:21:51] going to go all over the world everybody
[1:21:52] talking about this guy thinks he can
[1:21:53] call for rain well then you try it you
[1:21:54] don't think i can why don't you try it
[1:21:56] and then when god does tell me what
[1:21:57] happens
[1:21:59] i i'm just saying we got on the plane
[1:22:01] and we're on our way down and because of
[1:22:02] this tropical storm that was coming in
[1:22:04] and i was looking over and i could see
[1:22:05] the thunder and the lightning and so
[1:22:06] forth and and i hardly ever hear this
[1:22:08] announcement but they made this
[1:22:09] announcement buckle up we hear that uh
[1:22:12] please don't get up cabin crew stay
[1:22:13] seated we've heard that but then they
[1:22:15] made the statement we are expecting
[1:22:17] extreme turbulence if the oxygen mask
[1:22:20] falls do not use them it's just a
[1:22:22] turbulence
[1:22:24] i said well i don't hear that all the
[1:22:25] time
[1:22:26] that kind of makes you a little nervous
[1:22:27] the little old lady next to me in the
[1:22:29] middle she just grabbed the the rails
[1:22:30] like that and i i guess i didn't mean to
[1:22:32] say it you know quiet or loud i just
[1:22:34] turn around i go there'll be no
[1:22:35] turbulence
[1:22:37] and she looked at me and i just sat back
[1:22:39] and for the next 30 minutes smooth
[1:22:41] flying all the way down
[1:22:43] all the way down
[1:22:48] it and i i like how that just got kicked
[1:22:50] up right when i said that
[1:22:54] they're following the anointing they
[1:22:55] don't even know it
[1:22:56] bless your hearts you're cheering us on
[1:22:58] i love it i feel like i'm in a marching
[1:23:00] band like onward christian soldiers
[1:23:02] right
[1:23:03] we ain't gonna say none
[1:23:05] and uh anyway uh i had asked the lord
[1:23:07] for a sign that showed me that he was
[1:23:09] with me on this trip and then i in my
[1:23:10] heart i said was that my sign he said do
[1:23:12] you need another one i said no that'll
[1:23:13] do but the little lady next to him she
[1:23:15] goes now i don't know how you did that
[1:23:16] but that's a pretty good trick
[1:23:20] i said all i did was speak it
[1:23:22] and she goes okay and the brother i said
[1:23:25] i i'll say was spoke it and i prayed
[1:23:27] because i didn't think she'd understand
[1:23:28] that so i said i spoke it i prayed and
[1:23:30] the guy next to her goes well you prayed
[1:23:31] pretty good because he answered you and
[1:23:33] the person in the front goes i know
[1:23:34] that's right so i apparently i had an
[1:23:36] audience
[1:23:38] and they wanted to make sure that
[1:23:40] whatever i said was going to be followed
[1:23:41] through and they'd follow through
[1:23:43] now now i can push my luck if you want
[1:23:45] to say it or the grace with if you want
[1:23:47] can i say another one
[1:23:48] i went to the ocean the other day and
[1:23:49] enjoyed that and all these waves were
[1:23:51] coming at me coming at me and i just you
[1:23:52] go try it if you watching if you don't
[1:23:53] believe it you don't believe it but
[1:23:54] don't make fun of it

[1:23:58] and and they were standing there with a
[1:23:59] baby like that i said no no no that way
[1:24:01] and it got calm and it went
[1:24:03] and i just smiled and said i'm gonna do
[1:24:05] that again
[1:24:07] and i looked over at uh brother jesse
[1:24:09] it's kind of i don't know what he was

[1:25:18] through 18. and you know this very well
[1:25:22] but you're going to see the point this

[1:25:30] because i'm sitting there going there is
[1:25:31] no way that that water needs to stop not
[1:25:32] with all that weight behind it
[1:25:34] who am i and i actually turned around i
[1:25:36] told the brother and his wife i said who

[1:25:40] who am i and i said and i even stood
[1:25:42] back in in my own they went on to have
[1:25:44] fun with their baby and everything i
[1:25:45] just stood back and i was watching the
[1:25:46] ocean like i said now look how small i
[1:25:48] am i said why would god allow that with
[1:25:50] all that weight behind the atlantic
[1:25:52] ocean what or the gulf where we had
[1:25:54] atlantic i said why would he allow that
[1:25:57] i said no there's got to be something
[1:25:58] greater in here that we don't understand
[1:26:01] how many understand is that amen
[1:26:03] all right let's get down to it 22 verse
[1:26:05] 18 and the bi uh verse 15 and the angel
[1:26:08] of the lord called unto abraham out of
[1:26:10] heaven the second time i love it and he
[1:26:13] said by myself i have sworn have i sworn
[1:26:17] saith the lord for because thou has done
[1:26:20] this thing and has not withheld my uh
[1:26:24] thy son thine only son
[1:26:27] 18
[1:26:28] he says that in blessing oh 17 sorry
[1:26:31] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:26:33] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[1:26:36] as the stars of the heaven and as a sand
[1:26:38] which is a
[1:26:39] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[1:26:42] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[1:26:45] and in thy seat shall i all the nations
[1:26:48] of the earth be blessed because thou has
[1:26:51] obeyed my voice
[1:26:54] amen let's pray father we love you ask
[1:26:55] you to bless us uh this service lord
[1:26:58] bless this spiritual food we're about to
[1:27:00] partake of would you be a a part of
[1:27:02] every aspect lord you know that if it
[1:27:04] might sound like bragging lord i hope
[1:27:06] you understand that i'm bragging on you
[1:27:08] not on me i by myself could not stop a
[1:27:10] wave i by myself cannot call for rain i
[1:27:13] by myself could never say that
[1:27:14] turbulence would not strike but the
[1:27:16] anointing that is inside my life the the
[1:27:18] spirit that is inside my heart that
[1:27:20] which i yield to you o god are the
[1:27:23] ability you are the only one without you
[1:27:25] i am nothing and i know that i believe
[1:27:27] that lord so this morning as you have
[1:27:30] showed me over and over how nothing i am
[1:27:32] now bring to something that is inside my
[1:27:34] heart and serve the somebodies that are
[1:27:36] in this room lord and online may they
[1:27:38] all be blessed and may they all grow in
[1:27:40] faith not have faith in brother caleb
[1:27:42] but have faith with the god in the god
[1:27:44] that is in them and may they realize
[1:27:45] that they can speak the word too in
[1:27:47] jesus christ's name amen amen amen god
[1:27:50] bless you may be seated
[1:27:52] a very interesting portion of course i
[1:27:55] assume that all of you know your bible
[1:27:58] so i don't go back and read the history
[1:27:59] and all that i assume you all know
[1:28:01] exactly what he's talking about is that
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:04] i want you to understand here that this
[1:28:06] is not the first time that abraham was
[1:28:08] told he was going to be told he was
[1:28:09] going to bless be blessed this is not
[1:28:11] the first time nor the second time this
[1:28:13] is the third time when he tells him i
[1:28:15] need to talk to you and he tells him
[1:28:17] this he'd already promised him that he
[1:28:19] would bless him
[1:28:21] come on somebody help me now
[1:28:23] he'd already promised abraham that he
[1:28:25] would bless him he already said he was
[1:28:27] going to multiply a seed he already said
[1:28:29] look up until see the stars etc etc this
[1:28:32] is before he said that before he ever
[1:28:33] had a son in the first place
[1:28:36] right and then he has ishmael and he
[1:28:38] tells him yet again
[1:28:40] i'm going to bless you and then he comes
[1:28:42] along and he sees sarah and abraham and
[1:28:45] he talks to them he tells them then i'm
[1:28:46] gonna bless you but why is he
[1:28:48] the wording is different he says because
[1:28:51] you have done this thing
[1:28:54] now i don't make no sense
[1:28:57] sort of let me explain something
[1:28:59] uh we all believe that it's an
[1:29:01] unconditional covenant
[1:29:04] i set you up i hope you know that
[1:29:06] i believe in it too brother branham
[1:29:08] called it unconditionally we all believe
[1:29:09] that right
[1:29:10] but the thing that gets me is if it was
[1:29:12] unconditional then why did he just say
[1:29:14] because you did this
[1:29:17] because to me brother that sounds
[1:29:19] conditional
[1:29:20] now look i'm not taking away from what
[1:29:21] brother branham said i'm going to break
[1:29:23] it down so that you you you message
[1:29:24] scholars that are looking at me like i
[1:29:26] don't know about this here we go here's
[1:29:28] a guy going against brother branham i'm
[1:29:29] not
[1:29:30] he's right it is an unconditional
[1:29:32] promise
[1:29:33] the unconditional part was that he made
[1:29:35] the promise without abraham even asking
[1:29:38] for it
[1:29:40] right but in order for him to obtain
[1:29:43] this unconditional word he had to meet a
[1:29:46] certain condition
[1:29:47] look for abraham to even know anything
[1:29:49] more he said i need you to get out of
[1:29:52] that city you're dwelling in and i need
[1:29:54] you to go to a place which i will show

[1:29:59] you to leave your father and what did
[1:30:01] abraham do abraham brought along lot
[1:30:04] that was not the conditions that god had
[1:30:06] told them to do something
[1:30:09] amen are you watching this now but i
[1:30:11] thought it was unconditional well it is
[1:30:13] but at the same time it's not all right
[1:30:16] you know what i want to do is try to
[1:30:18] explain uh uh and if you'll just bear
[1:30:21] with me hey don't don't get all judged
[1:30:23] on me now just relax
[1:30:26] all right and watch what's gonna unfold
[1:30:28] here because i want to take away this
[1:30:30] delusional nonsense this state of mind
[1:30:33] we've got last night i told you we need
[1:30:35] to be rewired because somehow we got
[1:30:37] programmed and i'm sorry if you're not
[1:30:39] receiving the update you need to restart
[1:30:41] your mind turn it off power it down and
[1:30:44] then power back up and then hit refresh
[1:30:49] maybe you need to clean out the usb port
[1:30:52] i don't know maybe you need to go update
[1:30:54] your your carrier i don't care what it
[1:30:56] is but what you need to do is hit
[1:30:58] refresh and get quiet you're about to
[1:31:00] receive an update on something you
[1:31:02] already knew but now we're going to put
[1:31:04] it to work
[1:31:08] your phone has all these apps on them
[1:31:09] but they don't do no good if you don't
[1:31:11] update them
[1:31:12] and then
[1:31:13] they don't do no good if you don't use
[1:31:14] them right i didn't know i had an app on
[1:31:16] my phone they could do that like last
[1:31:17] night i didn't have an app on my phone
[1:31:19] that could tell me how to do an
[1:31:20] elliptical but for whatever reason i put
[1:31:22] in my pocket and said you better believe
[1:31:24] that's true
[1:31:26] i thought sister rachel was talking to
[1:31:27] me i don't know
[1:31:30] and i appreciated the singing this
[1:31:31] morning and when you all got to that
[1:31:33] song
[1:31:36] i went come on
[1:31:39] i had to come out of the office and sit
[1:31:40] there and listen to that singing that
[1:31:42] angelic singing more than enough
[1:31:45] i want to come and go more than he knows
[1:31:50] right
[1:31:51] you got to know i could hit that note
[1:31:52] huh
[1:31:56] pay attention i'll shock you some more
[1:32:00] but i want to get rid of this delusion
[1:32:02] that all we have to do is sit here and
[1:32:05] do nothing and god will do everything
[1:32:09] that is a lie spun from the pits of hell
[1:32:12] it is not true and our young people are
[1:32:15] coming to the water they don't even
[1:32:17] accept christ i don't know about here
[1:32:19] but in most messes churches they get in
[1:32:21] a dry center and come out a wet center
[1:32:24] the bible says that we have to verbally
[1:32:26] express with our mouth that jesus christ
[1:32:29] is our lord and savior and get in the
[1:32:31] water be baptized in the lord jesus
[1:32:32] christ and receive the holy ghost but
[1:32:34] we've got to quit telling him all you
[1:32:36] got to do is do it and then the lord
[1:32:38] will do the rest that's just not true
[1:32:41] it's not true
[1:32:42] it's a lie that i'll tell you the truth
[1:32:44] i've been guilty as a preacher saying it
[1:32:48] right
[1:32:49] any preachers want to help me with an
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:51] thank you thank you that ain't admitting
[1:32:53] guilt brother but it kind of was
[1:32:55] we've all done it
[1:32:57] we all were taught we looked at that
[1:32:59] unconditional and we ran with it
[1:33:02] right we ran with it all we have to do
[1:33:03] is believe all we have to do is believe
[1:33:05] well look uh let's get down to business
[1:33:07] there scholars um to get a blessing from
[1:33:10] god oops wrong one here it is to get a
[1:33:12] blessing from god
[1:33:14] you have to believe well that's a
[1:33:16] condition
[1:33:17] it don't just happen you first have to
[1:33:20] believe brother branham said do you
[1:33:22] believe do you believe do you have faith
[1:33:25] half the jesus says where's your faith
[1:33:27] where's the condition
[1:33:30] have faith now can i keep going you want
[1:33:32] me to you want me to be quiet
[1:33:35] all of this is genesis 18 was before
[1:33:38] sodom after sodom et cetera had been
[1:33:40] told all through these scriptures here
[1:33:42] that he was going to receive a promise
[1:33:44] but he hadn't gotten it he got ishmael
[1:33:46] that wasn't it and then here he said now
[1:33:48] because you he got the promise of isaac
[1:33:51] and then he says now because you have
[1:33:54] done this thing here
[1:33:58] yes now watch
[1:34:01] how many of you
[1:34:02] know well let's just do this all right
[1:34:05] let's do this
[1:34:06] i'm gonna go uh let's go to matthew
[1:34:08] chapter six
[1:34:09] now a lot of bible reading today and i
[1:34:11] hope that's all right
[1:34:13] i gave a lot of quotes last night so
[1:34:15] today we're gonna read the bible i hope
[1:34:16] that's okay matthew 6 and 14 and 15. i
[1:34:19] want to just point out some things here
[1:34:21] and i want you to just watch the trail
[1:34:23] of jesus here and how he does things so
[1:34:25] we're going to go uh matthew and fourth
[1:34:27] first chapter 6 and then 14.
[1:34:32] uh let me see how i have this written
[1:34:34] here
[1:34:38] so here we go here he goes here look at
[1:34:40] what he says here i want you to follow
[1:34:42] this word for
[1:34:43] what's the next word
[1:34:45] nice and loud
[1:34:47] ah
[1:34:48] okay for if you forgive man their
[1:34:52] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:34:54] also forgive
[1:34:56] you now wait a minute hang on brother
[1:34:58] jack now now hold on a minute here you
[1:35:01] mean to be forgiven i've got to forgive
[1:35:04] well that don't sound unconditional
[1:35:05] brother
[1:35:07] come on i want you to help me now with
[1:35:09] this
[1:35:09] don't get funny i want to hear amen's or
[1:35:11] something
[1:35:12] help me o lord or something
[1:35:14] 15 says but if you forgive not men their
[1:35:18] trespasses watch neither will your
[1:35:20] father forgive your trespasses
[1:35:25] wait wait wait wait wait wait now i
[1:35:27] thought god's grace brother smiley
[1:35:29] helped me brother troy i thought god's
[1:35:31] grace was unconditional
[1:35:34] it is
[1:35:35] because god's grace is there without
[1:35:38] even asking for it god placed it there
[1:35:40] but in order for you to obtain god's
[1:35:43] grace you're going to have to forgive
[1:35:45] people
[1:35:47] or you will not be forgiven
[1:35:50] look this is not my words this is not
[1:35:52] these are not my ideas this is the this
[1:35:55] is jesus christ said if you don't
[1:35:58] forgive my father won't forgive you
[1:36:02] but if you forgive my father is duty
[1:36:05] bound to forgive you
[1:36:09] wow
[1:36:11] oh we're going to follow the if trail
[1:36:12] all right
[1:36:14] look at uh chapter 16 same book chapter
[1:36:16] 16 verse 24.
[1:36:19] i hope you like this because see this is
[1:36:21] what happened we got rewired and then
[1:36:24] all of a sudden these scriptures popped
[1:36:25] out like i'd never read them before
[1:36:28] but in order for you to do this you got
[1:36:29] to get rewired your mind has to change
[1:36:31] you can't you can't keep seeing it
[1:36:33] through the same glasses you had on
[1:36:34] before you need to change your
[1:36:35] prescription
[1:36:38] yeah i got a lot of little
[1:36:40] antidotes right now don't i
[1:36:43] 16 uh verse 24 i believe yep then jesus
[1:36:45] said if any man look if any man
[1:36:49] will come after me let him deny himself
[1:36:52] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:36:55] now look
[1:36:56] he didn't say just follow
[1:36:59] he said if any man want to follow me
[1:37:01] then let him deny himself so you mean
[1:37:04] you can't ride the jesus train without
[1:37:07] first denying jack duff
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:11] right you can't ride the jesus train if
[1:37:14] you don't deny brother troy brother troy
[1:37:16] has got to deny brother troy's mind and
[1:37:19] indulges in his own thoughts and
[1:37:21] inhibitions he has got to follow jesus
[1:37:24] if i want to follow jesus i've got to
[1:37:26] deny my own idea of what jesus is
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:32] right if i'm going to jump on the
[1:37:34] message train then i've got to deny
[1:37:36] myself in my idea of what the message is
[1:37:39] and follow after jesus christ
[1:37:43] if you don't know jesus you'll never
[1:37:45] know the message because the message
[1:37:47] will never make sense to somebody who
[1:37:50] does not know who jesus christ is
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:53] amen you can quote it you can speak it
[1:37:55] you can have all this knowledge you can
[1:37:57] tear me up you can be a scholar and
[1:37:59] that's perfectly fine but if you don't
[1:38:01] know jesus you're a tingling brass and a
[1:38:03] sounding symbol and that's it
[1:38:06] come on somebody help me now
[1:38:09] all right let's go to uh 1720. now i'm
[1:38:12] just going to follow it so y'all just
[1:38:14] have fun with us and jesus said because
[1:38:17] of your unbelief
[1:38:19] same book matthew 17 20. because of your
[1:38:23] unbelief
[1:38:24] he said for barely i say unto you if
[1:38:28] now i thought everybody had faith like a
[1:38:30] mustard seed
[1:38:32] apparently not because if you have faith
[1:38:34] as a grain of mustard seed
[1:38:37] now now do we think it means that small
[1:38:40] i don't know what it means a grain of
[1:38:41] mustard a mustard seed is the only seed
[1:38:44] that will not integrate with any other
[1:38:47] seed
[1:38:48] an orange and an apple they'll mix and
[1:38:50] they'll get this perverted looking tree
[1:38:52] but a mustard seed won't do it so if you
[1:38:54] have faith that will not mix will not
[1:38:57] co-mingle with any other idea i got
[1:39:00] faith in buddhism i got faith in muslim
[1:39:02] and i got a little bit of christianity i
[1:39:04] put them all together hey what do you
[1:39:05] got a mess
[1:39:09] i throw in a little brother branham and
[1:39:10] they don't even know who i'm talking
[1:39:12] about well that's interesting
[1:39:16] you mean to tell me the seventh church
[1:39:17] is messenger you're getting credit for
[1:39:18] it
[1:39:19] odd odd
[1:39:22] odd okay anyway we're not here to talk
[1:39:23] about that if you have faith as a
[1:39:26] greater muscle seed you shall say unto
[1:39:28] this mountain and remove history yawn to
[1:39:30] place and it shall remove and nothing
[1:39:32] will be impossible to who
[1:39:35] to who
[1:39:36] a little louder saints
[1:39:38] oh you mean so if you have faith as a
[1:39:40] muscle scene you can tell that wave go
[1:39:42] that way and it will
[1:39:45] you can say there'll be no turbulence
[1:39:47] and there won't be that's right you can
[1:39:49] say there'll be rain today and rain will
[1:39:51] fall you can say it'll be a dry season
[1:39:54] and it will you can ask god to come in
[1:39:56] the midst of you and do marvelous things
[1:39:58] and he will
[1:40:01] come on
[1:40:05] all right
[1:40:06] waking up all right here we go all right
[1:40:09] are you ready
[1:40:10] now let's go to 19 same book 17.
[1:40:13] i'm just gonna leave them things off
[1:40:14] they bother me
[1:40:16] i don't need them anyway
[1:40:18] i'm getting younger that's what's
[1:40:19] happening i'm getting younger and
[1:40:20] they're blurring my vision same book
[1:40:22] matthew 19 17.
[1:40:25] let's go here
[1:40:27] we'll say and he said unto them why call
[1:40:29] now this is the rich young ruler
[1:40:31] i love it the red jungle that comes up
[1:40:33] with his arrogant self
[1:40:34] and he says
[1:40:35] why close me thou good
[1:40:37] he said there is none good but one that
[1:40:39] is god but if
[1:40:43] if
[1:40:44] doubt will enter into life keep the
[1:40:47] commandments now he goes on to say a
[1:40:49] little more sassy things and the lord
[1:40:50] gives him an answer in 21 verse 21
[1:40:55] ah jesus said to him if thou wilt be
[1:40:58] perfect how many wants to be perfect
[1:41:00] he told this to the rich young ruler if
[1:41:03] you want to be perfect
[1:41:05] if you want to be perfect go and sell
[1:41:07] all that thou hast and give to the poor
[1:41:09] and they also have treasure in heaven
[1:41:10] and come and follow me now look that's
[1:41:12] not to everybody
[1:41:15] okay he was talking to the rich young
[1:41:17] ruler and contacted his spirit
[1:41:20] and when he found out what his problem
[1:41:22] was he's a good man but he's got greed
[1:41:24] in his heart and he said look you're
[1:41:26] doing great everything you're like 99.9
[1:41:29] but if you want to be spotless sell all
[1:41:32] that you have and follow me
[1:41:35] now that ain't for everybody
[1:41:38] so when i jesus said sell oh i sell all
[1:41:40] i had but that wasn't your problem see
[1:41:43] all right now let's go on to mark
[1:41:45] chapter nine go to mark chapter nine
[1:41:47] verse 23
[1:41:51] i like the beat of that one
[1:41:59] i'm enjoying it you know
[1:42:01] poor little brother i was out there and
[1:42:02] he went like this to his door and i
[1:42:03] almost walked so that's the wrong door
[1:42:04] sorry about that
[1:42:05] i couldn't believe i said that's the
[1:42:07] wrong door
[1:42:08] little fella looked all disappointed i
[1:42:10] saw i'm going in this one so
[1:42:13] i wonder if they were looking at us like
[1:42:14] how come y'all are so nicely dressed why
[1:42:15] we believe in never mind all right all
[1:42:17] right you got to love them look pray for
[1:42:19] them we don't know what's going on here
[1:42:21] there's a reason why these people are
[1:42:23] all here because they're being they're
[1:42:24] living off the anointing of what's going
[1:42:26] on in spirit and truth true story
[1:42:30] that's why they won't move you think
[1:42:31] they're not if you can hear them they
[1:42:33] can hear us
[1:42:35] come on
[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:44] they're just writing the anointing of a
[1:42:46] real believer
[1:42:49] it is something
[1:42:51] that's why these churches won't leave
[1:42:52] this place it's not a competition like
[1:42:54] there's something here we've been in
[1:42:55] other places and we could never get
[1:42:56] anywhere with god but we get here
[1:42:58] something's going on it ain't you friend
[1:43:00] it's here
[1:43:02] mark chapter 9 verse 23 sorry about that
[1:43:06] jesus said unto him if thou canst
[1:43:09] believe
[1:43:10] if you can't believe all things are
[1:43:12] possible
[1:43:14] to them
[1:43:15] who believes
[1:43:17] if you can't believe so what does that
[1:43:19] tell me not everybody can
[1:43:21] right not everybody can but if you can't
[1:43:24] believe all things are possible if you
[1:43:26] can't believe
[1:43:28] i'm gonna keep following go luke go to
[1:43:29] luke chapter 14. glory to god
[1:43:32] you're gonna you're gonna like where
[1:43:34] this ends up because i'm trying to give
[1:43:35] you i'm trying to empower you this
[1:43:36] morning
[1:43:40] no i am empowering you this morning
[1:43:43] luke 14 26.
[1:43:47] do i want that one caleb
[1:43:53] no well let's go ahead and read it
[1:43:55] it says if any man come to me and hate
[1:43:58] not his father
[1:44:00] and mother and wife and children and
[1:44:03] brethren and sisters yea in his own life
[1:44:06] also he cannot be my disciple
[1:44:10] now look this is getting down serious
[1:44:12] stuff brother jack
[1:44:13] because we think all we have to do is go
[1:44:16] to church sing a few songs pay a little
[1:44:18] bit of dues and walk out and brother
[1:44:20] duff is our pastor and we believe the
[1:44:22] message and everything's all right but
[1:44:24] jesus is laying it out on the line
[1:44:28] now i'm not telling you to go and hate
[1:44:29] everybody what he means is put me first
[1:44:32] or you cannot be my disciple
[1:44:36] put me before your hobbies put me before
[1:44:39] your house put me before your payments
[1:44:41] put me before your job put me before
[1:44:43] your wife's happiness before your
[1:44:45] children's happiness put me first or you
[1:44:47] cannot even follow me
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:52] now you know that scripture don't seem
[1:44:53] so harsh before my mind got rewired
[1:44:58] when i got into the greatest battle of
[1:44:59] her thoughts series that we did at
[1:45:01] church and we really haven't left it yet
[1:45:02] have we brother we were just kind of
[1:45:04] spinning around that because we're
[1:45:06] seeing the change but when i got into
[1:45:08] that and i hear over and over again when
[1:45:10] i was dealing with the sinus pain that
[1:45:11] night one of the nights i was dealing
[1:45:13] with it i was sitting like man what is
[1:45:14] going on and i put on a greatness battle
[1:45:16] i just pressed play wherever i left off
[1:45:18] and the first thing out of brother
[1:45:19] brandon's mouth was it's in your mind
[1:45:22] it doesn't hurt it's in your mind i went
[1:45:25] all right i went to sleep
[1:45:30] we've got to understand that if you're
[1:45:32] going to follow jesus you've got to put
[1:45:34] it in your mind and down in your heart
[1:45:36] and my brother said last night what is
[1:45:39] between your heart and your mind i go uh
[1:45:41] the fight and he goes no your mouth
[1:45:46] the struggle is to say the right things
[1:45:50] your heart knows what to speak but your
[1:45:52] mind thinks it knows better
[1:45:55] you've got to tell your mind just shut
[1:45:57] up and listen to what the heart because
[1:46:00] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:46:02] mouth speaks
[1:46:05] come on
[1:46:06] come on
[1:46:08] hey i thank you brother troy but you
[1:46:10] gave it to me now
[1:46:13] you want me to take you in
[1:46:16] i'll do it
[1:46:20] that i was like that's a missing piece
[1:46:22] of the puzzle right i needed that i wait
[1:46:25] till i get back home
[1:46:28] i came to bring you something i'm going
[1:46:30] to take something back

[1:47:21] but because she didn't know but see when
[1:47:23] she when he said that he sparked her her
[1:47:26] spiritual thinking if you knew
[1:47:29] suddenly her eyes were open and y'all
[1:47:31] ever seen the chosen y'all watch that

[1:47:43] don't tell me you have not ever been a
[1:47:46] smart aleck with god
[1:47:48] and to listen to that lady i never even
[1:47:50] thought of that and she goes oh what
[1:47:52] because geo water is better than
[1:47:53] samaritan water
[1:47:56] did you hear her
[1:47:57] she was being a smart

[1:48:13] still like that drink of water please
[1:48:15] and he's being so patient and when he
[1:48:17] was about to lose her attention i love
[1:48:19] it he goes your first husband was named
[1:48:21] this
[1:48:23] your second husband this
[1:48:25] your second one you left because you
[1:48:27] didn't feel like you deserved them and
[1:48:29] you remember on your wedding night his
[1:48:30] skin smelled like oranges this is
[1:48:33] intimate detail
[1:48:36] he said his skin smell like oranges
[1:48:38] because he worked in the groves and
[1:48:40] every time you go to the market you
[1:48:41] think of him and you miss him and you
[1:48:43] still feel guilty for leaving him she
[1:48:44] dropped the water she goes why are you
[1:48:46] doing this she goes he goes your third
[1:48:48] husband was named this and i'm like
[1:48:50] sitting there going listen we have seen
[1:48:53] that before
[1:48:57] amen now the bible don't say he did that
[1:49:00] but i got no problem believing that he
[1:49:02] did
[1:49:03] because brother branham used that over
[1:49:05] and over and over and over and over
[1:49:07] and i'm telling you if you knew the gift
[1:49:10] of god that was in front of you i don't
[1:49:12] mean me but i mean the holy spirit you
[1:49:14] could say what you want and it would be
[1:49:16] done for you
[1:49:18] come on
[1:49:22] if if thou canst believe
[1:49:26] he said all things are possible yeah she
[1:49:28] took off running come see in the hand i
[1:49:30] saw i loved it
[1:49:32] if we go to service
[1:49:33] the anointing drops down don't nobody
[1:49:35] see come see brother jack
[1:49:40] no
[1:49:41] they don't do that no i'm not saying
[1:49:43] that either they're not saying nothing
[1:49:45] they keep it amongst themselves we keep
[1:49:47] well that was a good service brother
[1:49:48] okay well then bring somebody with you
[1:49:53] she didn't hesitate to spread the word
[1:49:56] she took off left a water pop behind and
[1:49:59] the bible specifically mentions she left
[1:50:02] her water pot and ran does anybody know
[1:50:05] why
[1:50:06] i taught you this years ago
[1:50:09] you know right because of who she was
[1:50:12] what time of the day she could go there
[1:50:14] must be some change in her because she
[1:50:16] don't care about that water part no more
[1:50:18] she left her past behind and she said
[1:50:21] come see a man who knows all things
[1:50:26] the problem with all of us is we're
[1:50:27] picking up the water pot as we walk out
[1:50:29] of church
[1:50:30] we lay it down on the altar but then we
[1:50:31] pick it up and walk out with it we come
[1:50:33] down here and we break the alabaster box
[1:50:35] and then we glue it back together and
[1:50:37] walk out with it like it's some kind of
[1:50:38] hidden treasure
[1:50:40] we've got to remember once you laid on
[1:50:41] the altar you'll leave it there and walk
[1:50:44] away
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:47] you don't pick it up you leave it there
[1:50:51] hallelujah
[1:50:54] if you've ever been forgiven then you're
[1:50:55] forgiven don't pick it up no more if you
[1:50:58] can forgive you'll be forgiven if you
[1:51:00] don't you won't but if you believe today

[1:53:56] i actually told the church y'all don't

[1:54:06] god what i need to learn from this well
[1:54:08] that went on for about a week and when i
[1:54:09] came back in all messed up
[1:54:11] the saints were like no we love you
[1:54:13] brother we know what you said but we're

[1:54:29] john chapter 8
[1:54:30] verse 19
[1:54:33] we're just going to follow this trail of
[1:54:34] if here if
[1:54:44] all right i'm going to just read the
[1:54:45] bold print if you don't mind it's in red
[1:54:47] he said you neither know me you neither
[1:54:49] know me
[1:54:51] nor my father i love this if you had
[1:54:53] known me you should have known my father

[1:54:57] you see this is what i'm trying to get
[1:54:59] at it you don't know you might well you
[1:55:01] don't know the message and you don't
[1:55:02] even know who brother branham was
[1:55:04] because if you knew the message and knew
[1:55:05] who brother branham was you'd know who
[1:55:06] jesus christ was
[1:55:08] see just because you know knowledge man

[1:55:15] believe it's two different people no i
[1:55:17] don't believe it's two different people
[1:55:18] but there's definitely two different
[1:55:19] anointings here because jesus is not
[1:55:22] talking like in the third person me and
[1:55:23] my he said me and my father are one but
[1:55:25] he also
[1:55:27] he also made the difference

[1:55:33] how many understands that
[1:55:35] i'm not talking two gods we're just
[1:55:36] talking two different offices right

[1:58:16] shall die
[1:58:17] in your sins whether i go you cannot

[2:03:25] back and you can be quiet but i'm a
[2:03:27] praise warrior and i'm on the front line
[2:03:29] running up and down the aisle because i
[2:03:31] want to serve and worship and praise god

[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:08] hey come on
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:14] people don't want to praise them because
[2:04:15] they don't even know what they're
[2:04:17] praising
[2:04:18] you may be seated god bless you
[2:04:21] they don't want to praise them because
[2:04:22] they don't know what they're praising
[2:04:25] they don't praise them because they
[2:04:26] don't have no reason to praise them
[2:04:30] when i was over at the brown tabernacle
[2:04:32] i stayed there for about a year i had to
[2:04:34] get out of tucson for a while and
[2:04:36] all kinds of different ideas and i saw
[2:04:38] i'll go to jeffersonville and i'll
[2:04:40] listen to tapes
[2:04:41] and i'll get the doctrine down right
[2:04:43] until i found out the brothers in the
[2:04:45] back played certain tapes to go along
[2:04:46] with what they were thinking
[2:04:49] but i didn't know that till the end so
[2:04:50] it didn't matter i heard the message uh
[2:04:53] statue of perfect man was screaming my
[2:04:55] head off
[2:04:56] i heard a little phrase in there where
[2:04:57] brother brown said because god said so
[2:05:00] god said so god said so in about towards
[2:05:02] the end of time i went godzilla and
[2:05:04] everybody turned around looked at me i
[2:05:05] thought all the wood bits were going to
[2:05:07] crack
[2:05:10] i i didn't know you weren't allowed to
[2:05:12] say amen in that little wooden place
[2:05:14] i mean if you listen to the tapes
[2:05:16] somebody's saying hey man you can hear
[2:05:17] somebody saying hey man
[2:05:20] i turn around look something like oh
[2:05:22] there wasn't me that was the tape
[2:05:26] huh
[2:05:28] i thought it was all right to believe
[2:05:29] god
[2:05:30] i didn't know no different
[2:05:32] i still don't know no difference
[2:05:34] all i know is that when i hear something
[2:05:36] prickly here and it gets me excited i
[2:05:38] praise him
[2:05:39] i dance i shout i have a good time
[2:05:42] because serving god is a wonderful thing
[2:05:44] to do
[2:05:49] you ask me why why i'm happy i'll just
[2:05:51] tell you why
[2:05:52] because my sins are gone
[2:05:55] oh okay that's the reason people don't
[2:05:57] want to praise god brother stephen
[2:05:58] because they ain't never been forgiven
[2:06:00] for anything
[2:06:01] but see the bible tells me where much is
[2:06:04] where much is given much is required is
[2:06:06] that right so when i gave to the world i
[2:06:08] had to come back and give back to god
[2:06:10] and when i know you don't know but i
[2:06:12] know all the things i've done and all
[2:06:15] the things that god little match to he
[2:06:17] said where is the evidence case
[2:06:19] dismissed case dismissed case dismissed
[2:06:22] i'm saved by grace yes
[2:06:25] amen
[2:06:26] amen
[2:06:27] you know that song i was guilty come on
[2:06:31] case dismissed
[2:06:33] saved by grace
[2:06:38] well they ain't got nobody to praise
[2:06:39] because they ain't never been forgiven
[2:06:42] i know what i was for i know what i was
[2:06:44] going into i know what i'm guilty of but
[2:06:46] jesus christ little maps burn that
[2:06:48] evidence and i ain't got no evidence of
[2:06:49] it
[2:06:50] the devil still did point his finger and
[2:06:52] god said you better quit you better get
[2:06:53] that finger out of his face
[2:06:55] come on
[2:07:02] do you love him
[2:07:04] your case is dismissed
[2:07:06] and you got no reason to praise god
[2:07:08] your case is dismissed you got no reason
[2:07:10] to say amen
[2:07:12] your sin is saved by grace there's
[2:07:13] nothing against you it's in the sea of
[2:07:15] god's forgiveness and you can't squeeze
[2:07:17] out on amen
[2:07:19] how many has been forgiven say amen
[2:07:22] how many knows you've been bought by the
[2:07:23] blood shouty man
[2:07:26] that's what i'm talking about
[2:07:29] yes sir is right
[2:07:31] tell me to be quiet i don't even know
[2:07:33] how i got on there don't tell me to be
[2:07:34] quiet you're the wrong church telling me
[2:07:36] to be quiet
[2:07:38] [Applause]
[2:07:39] i remember i went down to uh when i was
[2:07:41] in tucson and we got started and
[2:07:44] and i was being kind of a little extra
[2:07:46] and uh you know not you don't believe it
[2:07:48] i know
[2:07:50] and the mr says to me she says to me you
[2:07:52] know why you're like that don't you and
[2:07:54] i said why it's just because you're in
[2:07:55] your own church
[2:07:56] and i turn around and go that's right
[2:07:58] and i ain't got to apologize to nobody
[2:07:59] for the way i act
[2:08:01] if they don't like it they can go find
[2:08:02] another or there's 14 more to choose
[2:08:04] from
[2:08:05] if you don't like none of them you can
[2:08:06] start one that's what everybody does
[2:08:07] anyway
[2:08:11] i couldn't find one that fit so i'm
[2:08:12] going to start my own
[2:08:15] i can't convert nobody because i ain't
[2:08:16] been converted so i'm gonna go steal
[2:08:18] some
[2:08:24] i said it i'm not taking it back either
[2:08:27] i didn't steal any brother green gave
[2:08:29] them to me
[2:08:30] and the 20 i had already got converted a
[2:08:32] little missionary room that i was using
[2:08:33] on the south side of tucson i picked
[2:08:35] them up all by myself with god's help i
[2:08:37] didn't get them from no church they came
[2:08:38] to me
[2:08:39] come on and then brother green gave
[2:08:41] permission and every time there was a
[2:08:42] funeral i got a few more that's not my
[2:08:44] fault that's not me that's not that's
[2:08:46] god's doing
[2:08:47] you get these guys they can't stand a
[2:08:48] church and they'll go start a church and
[2:08:49] they got started bleeding out and what
[2:08:51] we call back at two so i don't know if
[2:08:52] you have these they're called
[2:08:53] tumbleweeds anybody ever heard of that a
[2:08:55] tumbleweed is a weed that grows and
[2:08:56] dries and then it breaks and it rolls
[2:08:58] over wherever the wind takes them and
[2:09:00] while they're going they're spreading
[2:09:01] seeds everywhere
[2:09:03] seeds of discrepancy seas of hate seeds
[2:09:06] of bitterness seeds of this seeds of woe
[2:09:08] is me
[2:09:09] they get a few people and all they got
[2:09:11] is a hangry church and all they can
[2:09:12] preach about us against somebody else
[2:09:14] and when you're sitting there tearing
[2:09:15] somebody else down your own testimony is
[2:09:17] being torn down
[2:09:19] the bible says you hold a man or
[2:09:21] you hold a man in reproach or in in
[2:09:24] condemnation or whatever your own
[2:09:26] testimony is finished off
[2:09:28] how many understand is that
[2:09:30] hold a man in contempt and you'll lose
[2:09:31] your own reputation that's the verse
[2:09:34] right let me just say this we've all
[2:09:36] heard this before but tearing me down is
[2:09:37] not going to build you up
[2:09:41] tearing you down will not build them up
[2:09:43] [Applause]

[2:10:34] chapter 38.
[2:10:39] no let's do something else let's go 34.
[2:10:41] it is not written in your law uh
[2:10:44] i said you are god's amen is it not
[2:10:47] written in your law that you were gods
[2:10:49] 35 if you called them gods who unto whom
[2:10:53] the word of god came and the scripture
[2:10:55] cannot be broken
[2:10:57] say ye of him whom the father had
[2:11:00] sanctified and sent unto the world thou
[2:11:02] blaspheme is because i said i am the son
[2:11:05] of god
[2:11:06] if i do not the works of my father
[2:11:10] believe me not
[2:11:13] but if i do
[2:11:17] though you believe not me believe the
[2:11:19] works
[2:11:21] i thought you said it wasn't my works it
[2:11:23] isn't but it is
[2:11:25] if jesus is in you he'll do the works
[2:11:28] for you
[2:11:29] you don't got to believe i'm a christian
[2:11:30] and if you don't that's fine but believe
[2:11:32] the works that you see done
[2:11:36] that you may know and believe that the
[2:11:39] father is in me ah
[2:11:41] and i in him
[2:11:44] you see it
[2:11:46] where are we at now what verse is that
[2:11:48] but if i okay we did okay we just about
[2:11:51] to read it all right now let's go to 11
[2:11:53] uh
[2:11:55] let's go to 11 verse 40.
[2:11:58] just going to keep on that you already
[2:12:00] know
[2:12:02] jesus said on earth said i not unto thee
[2:12:05] if thou would believe thou should see
[2:12:08] the glory of god now he's talking to
[2:12:09] martha
[2:12:11] see he said if i said if if you can
[2:12:16] believe
[2:12:17] look the whole idea behind lazarus
[2:12:19] coming from the dead was somebody had to
[2:12:22] believe
[2:12:24] amen
[2:12:26] good he had to kick the disciples out
[2:12:28] because of their unbelief
[2:12:30] to raise up that little girl
[2:12:32] he didn't do that on his own
[2:12:34] but here he said did not tell you if
[2:12:37] you'd believe you'd see the glory of god
[2:12:39] so right then that must have sparked
[2:12:41] your faith and she began to believe and
[2:12:43] she saw the glory of god lazarus come
[2:12:46] forth

[2:18:29] as the father had loved me
[2:18:31] look at these why why why doesn't
[2:18:34] anybody want to go to church
[2:18:36] when you got verses like this
[2:18:38] that after listening to the greatest
[2:18:40] ballard fought and getting my update
[2:18:42] then i suddenly understand how the
[2:18:43] program works
[2:18:45] i i love it i've been preaching on how
[2:18:47] many years maybe almost 20. i've been
[2:18:50] all over the country in some parts of
[2:18:51] the world and i've been a pastor now
[2:18:54] going on set we're going to be eight
[2:18:55] years december the 7th and we're
[2:18:56] enjoying it and we're enjoying the
[2:18:58] blessing of god in the last two years
[2:19:00] like all of a sudden there's stuff being
[2:19:01] written there that was never there
[2:19:02] before
[2:19:05] oh that never happens to y'all
[2:19:08] tell me we don't say brother jack
[2:19:10] i found this scripture you found it
[2:19:13] was it lost
[2:19:16] or do you mean you found your bible you
[2:19:18] ain't read in a while
[2:19:21] i'll leave that alone all right
[2:19:23] i found this verse you found a verse
[2:19:26] where was it was it misplaced
[2:19:28] well apparently because i didn't even
[2:19:30] know it was here anyway as the father
[2:19:32] had loved me i knew this was here but as
[2:19:34] a father loved me so have i loved you so
[2:19:36] have i loved you continue in my love

[2:19:49] heavier in here now look brother jack
[2:19:51] look at this do you understand
[2:19:53] you got to keep his commandments now
[2:19:56] well i thought we were done with the law
[2:19:58] who said that
[2:19:59] now i'm not talking about the levitical
[2:20:01] and the you know sabbath and all this
[2:20:03] there are 10 laws that we need to keep
[2:20:06] and on top of that he added to right
[2:20:08] love your neighbor as yourself and love
[2:20:09] the lord your god with all your heart
[2:20:10] and all that soul etc right so it's not
[2:20:13] many things we got to do it's just 12.

[2:20:22] abide in my love even as i have kept my
[2:20:25] father's commandments and abide in his
[2:20:28] love

[2:20:37] these things have i spoken unto you that
[2:20:40] that my joy might remain in you oh there
[2:20:43] goes the answer to why i'm so depressed
[2:20:45] those other friends you know why you're
[2:20:46] depressed because you're not abiding in
[2:20:48] christ and you're not his words
[2:20:51] you're not keeping his commandments and
[2:20:53] you're not abiding in his love therefore
[2:20:54] his love is not abiding in you and
[2:20:56] that's why you have no joy oh brother
[2:20:58] joe i just brother jack i just feel like
[2:21:00] if i could just sing a few more specials

[2:21:35] another as i have loved you carry on
[2:21:40] love with no man

[2:22:05] friends brother jack pastor the bible

[2:22:09] how come he don't show up huh because my
[2:22:11] friends in the world are better friends
[2:22:12] than people in the church

[2:22:52] my friends don't judge me if god was my
[2:22:54] friend he said he's my friend yeah yeah
[2:22:56] but there's a condition to being his
[2:22:58] friend
[2:22:58] you are my friends if
[2:23:01] i want loud loud you're my friends
[2:23:04] you're my friends
[2:23:05] you do whatsoever i command you
[2:23:09] what kind of a friend
[2:23:13] what kind of a friend is this
[2:23:16] you know we sing those songs i have
[2:23:18] found a friend in jesus he's everything
[2:23:21] to me yeah i wonder if jesus would say
[2:23:23] that about you
[2:23:26] or me
[2:23:28] could he say i have found a friend in
[2:23:30] caleb drawn he's everything to me he
[2:23:32] does everything i command him and even
[2:23:34] more
[2:23:36] he goes wherever i send him he never
[2:23:38] complains not once
[2:23:39] he's my friend and i will bless him all
[2:23:41] his life
[2:23:42] could jesus sing a song like that about
[2:23:44] me
[2:23:45] am i really his friend
[2:23:48] let's get serious now am i
[2:23:50] i want you to say in your own way am i
[2:23:52] his friend
[2:23:54] don't say you are be careful with that
[2:23:56] because your only his friend if you do
[2:23:58] whatsoever he commands you
[2:24:00] i don't know what kind of friendship is
[2:24:02] this but i'm going to ask you something
[2:24:04] how many of us command jesus
[2:24:07] to do whatever we want all the time
[2:24:15] jesus i need you to do this
[2:24:17] i got to have you do this i gotta have
[2:24:19] this oh by the way forgive me for that
[2:24:22] i'm not saying i'm sorry they got what
[2:24:24] they asked for they got what they
[2:24:25] deserved but i need you to come on the
[2:24:27] scene and show up for me
[2:24:30] well you want him to do whatever he
[2:24:31] could you command him but you can't do
[2:24:33] what he commands you
[2:24:36] think about it
[2:24:38] you better believe it
[2:24:41] that hurts my heart to be honest with
[2:24:43] you
[2:24:44] i i've asked the church back home and
[2:24:45] said am i really his friend
[2:24:48] am i
[2:24:49] i'm not looking for sympathy guys i'm
[2:24:51] not looking for you know how how are you
[2:24:53] doing buddy
[2:24:56] you thought you just walk in here
[2:24:59] you ain't changed a bit man look at you
[2:25:03] i love you
[2:25:05] i love you i'm going to talk to you a
[2:25:06] few minutes after search i got something
[2:25:08] i got to say with you all right
[2:25:11] you are my friends if you do whatsoever
[2:25:13] i command you
[2:25:15] you can't even claim to be a friend of
[2:25:17] jesus
[2:25:18] you can't even say you are if you don't
[2:25:21] do what he tells you now i know we all
[2:25:23] of a sudden got real sober in here
[2:25:24] didn't we but this is gospel now
[2:25:27] i told you we're going to follow that if
[2:25:28] trail all the way through
[2:25:30] what verse is that says
[2:25:33] 14 okay what did i say we're going to
[2:25:34] read 2
[2:25:36] what was that it yeah
[2:25:40] no there's two more no wait yeah you're
[2:25:42] right you're right so that's a bit of me
[2:25:43] abiding him so his love that we say
[2:25:46] leave that up for a minute so we can
[2:25:47] meditate on that marinate it
[2:25:51] his love that we said is unconditional
[2:25:54] it turns out it has conditions
[2:25:57] but here's the thing and let me just
[2:25:58] explain this this is what brother
[2:25:59] brandon was saying and i'm not trying to
[2:26:01] reword it but look we're talking about
[2:26:03] our understanding and how we all got
[2:26:04] excited over something and there's all
[2:26:06] kind of people believing the message and
[2:26:07] thinking all they got to do is believe
[2:26:08] god sent a prophet and everything's all
[2:26:10] right i'm telling you that's just not
[2:26:11] true
[2:26:12] that's just not true
[2:26:15] the unconditional part john 3 16 for god
[2:26:18] so loved the world that he gave his only
[2:26:19] begotten son right that whosoever will
[2:26:21] etc the unconditional part is let's put
[2:26:24] that up john 3 16. let's do uh john 3
[2:26:27] 15.
[2:26:30] because john 3 16 is not the first time
[2:26:32] he said it by the way
[2:26:35] john 3 15
[2:26:38] says that who that whosoever believeth
[2:26:41] in him should not perish but have
[2:26:42] eternal life 16.
[2:26:45] for god to love the world comma that he
[2:26:48] gave his only begotten son comma
[2:26:51] so let me just show you unconditional
[2:26:54] gospel of the world
[2:26:56] unconditional that he gave
[2:26:59] but now here's the condition to get his
[2:27:03] unconditional promise yes
[2:27:05] that whosoever believed in him
[2:27:09] wait wait wait so to get god's love the
[2:27:11] world and his only begotten son you've
[2:27:13] got to believe in him believe in him no
[2:27:18] not just believe it's not just it's that
[2:27:20] whosoever believeth in him should not
[2:27:23] perish but have everlasting life now we
[2:27:26] all want to indulge in this
[2:27:29] that's unconditional
[2:27:30] no this is the unconditional this is a
[2:27:33] conditional conditional unconditional
[2:27:35] condition but this right here is the
[2:27:37] condition you have to believe in him
[2:27:41] if you don't believe in him you cannot
[2:27:43] obtain cannot obtain his unconditional
[2:27:46] promise
[2:27:49] so now we get it now
[2:27:51] it's not unconditional is it
[2:27:53] it is
[2:27:54] and it isn't
[2:27:56] you can title this his unconditional
[2:27:58] condition
[2:28:00] there are or you could tell the mess i
[2:28:02] call it back home if
[2:28:04] like i told these people in phoenix i'm
[2:28:06] gonna preach a message called this
[2:28:07] they're like if
[2:28:08] just bear with me i'll give you a couple
[2:28:10] old testament examples and then we'll
[2:28:12] finish up
[2:28:13] y'all know the story about naaman
[2:28:16] in second kings chapter five you know
[2:28:17] got to put it up he came over there with
[2:28:19] leprosy look discernment is not
[2:28:21] something that's new
[2:28:23] that went all to the scriptures
[2:28:26] and here he come and he said he sent his
[2:28:29] servant and he goes out and his servant
[2:28:32] the servant of the prophet meets the
[2:28:33] servant of naaman and the name and gets
[2:28:35] mad because the prophet don't come out
[2:28:36] to see him well you sent your servant
[2:28:38] and then you want him to come out
[2:28:40] himself so he sent a servant you didn't
[2:28:41] show him respect so whatever and he says
[2:28:44] uh for you to dip in the river jordan
[2:28:46] seven times now i got another lesson on
[2:28:48] that but i won't bring that one today
[2:28:49] but let's just talk about that for a
[2:28:50] minute and then he gets upset i'm with
[2:28:53] this i'm a great man i'm of that i'm of
[2:28:55] this i'm with that well it turns out
[2:28:57] that leprosy was not actually his
[2:28:59] problem
[2:29:02] i mean the man stinks
[2:29:04] the man stinks his thumb probably fell
[2:29:07] off he's probably all wrapped up
[2:29:10] got his arm around nose is probably
[2:29:11] missing
[2:29:12] faith look this is leprosy if you have
[2:29:14] time to show your picture what leprosy
[2:29:15] looks like it ain't pretty
[2:29:16] you stink your flesh is running and
[2:29:19] you're in pain and you're talking about
[2:29:21] i'm not getting in that water
[2:29:26] well apparently brother
[2:29:28] leprosy is not really your problem
[2:29:32] you mean to tell me you've fallen apart
[2:29:34] and you stink
[2:29:36] and you're too proud to get in muddy
[2:29:39] water
[2:29:42] i mean seriously how much worse could it
[2:29:44] get get your
[2:29:45] three or four toes you got left and put
[2:29:47] them in there
[2:29:51] but he makes the statement i'm not doing
[2:29:53] this i'm not getting in there there's
[2:29:54] got to be cleaner water someplace man if
[2:29:56] the water was dirty back then can you
[2:29:58] imagine
[2:29:59] what he would say now we're getting in
[2:30:00] that santa cruz ain't even water in that
[2:30:02] thing
[2:30:03] but then the servant said this
[2:30:05] verse 13.
[2:30:07] if he had asked you to do some great
[2:30:10] thing you'd have done it
[2:30:12] if so then what did they do oh yeah well
[2:30:14] i can do this and he gets in there seven
[2:30:16] times you know the store and he's healed
[2:30:18] but see there's another one like this
[2:30:20] elisha was following elijah
[2:30:23] and he was told your master is going to
[2:30:26] die
[2:30:27] i know
[2:30:29] the prophet said what are you doing
[2:30:31] don't you know he's going he said i know
[2:30:32] it mind your business
[2:30:34] elijah turn around and say elisha what
[2:30:37] do you want from me he said i want a
[2:30:38] double portion of your spirit
[2:30:42] he said you've asked me a hard thing
[2:30:45] but
[2:30:47] come on everybody say it if you see me
[2:30:50] go
[2:30:51] you shall have what you've asked for
[2:30:54] this is not a new concept
[2:30:57] there has always been from abraham to
[2:31:00] jesus christ has always been if clauses
[2:31:04] in the promises of god
[2:31:06] it's not one-sided like we think
[2:31:09] it's not how we just got to believe and
[2:31:11] sit here and do nothing and god will fix
[2:31:14] everything son daughter you have got
[2:31:16] some things to do yes sir
[2:31:18] that's right
[2:31:19] god is not going to clean up your mess
[2:31:21] without you first repenting of that mess
[2:31:25] and when i say repent i don't mean just
[2:31:27] talk to god about it i mean go to
[2:31:29] whoever you offended or whatever you got
[2:31:30] to do you got to repent and if that
[2:31:31] means pay your fines to the court you
[2:31:32] got to go pay your fines of the court
[2:31:34] they're not just going to go away
[2:31:36] i've got a cousin who got out of prison
[2:31:39] and
[2:31:40] he was supposed to you know parole and
[2:31:41] all this and he was doing good for about
[2:31:43] six months next you know he just dodged
[2:31:45] him moving from place to place changed
[2:31:46] his phone number every two weeks thought
[2:31:48] they weren't gonna catch up to him got a
[2:31:49] real good job and they caught him at the
[2:31:51] door
[2:31:53] and i told him it's not just gonna go
[2:31:54] away man this is the government they're
[2:31:56] not going to play with their money
[2:31:57] they don't care about you being in the
[2:31:59] prison they don't even want you to they
[2:32:00] want you to pay the money
[2:32:02] they know you can't pay if you're
[2:32:03] sitting there
[2:32:04] they want you to give them their money
[2:32:06] well i don't want to pay him well
[2:32:07] they're going to pay him somehow
[2:32:09] now he's going to pay
[2:32:11] there is a condition if you want your
[2:32:13] license back you want your rights back
[2:32:15] if you want your
[2:32:17] respective uh uh you know stats in the
[2:32:19] community back if you want to be

[2:32:32] day

[2:32:59] went down the gospel rescue mission and
[2:33:00] i told my testimony then i went over to
[2:33:03] jail and i witnessed over there then i
[2:33:05] found some guys that i used to hang out
[2:33:06] with and i told them over there and all

[2:33:21] god and prayed and prayed and i you know
[2:33:23] there's guys not in our churches i know
[2:33:25] not we're not but you know we know of
[2:33:26] people

[2:33:33] get up they start talking
[2:33:35] and if the first two times it might work
[2:33:38] but the third or fourth it was like we
[2:33:39] heard this before man

[2:35:30] are in your presence that's a double
[2:35:32] portion
[2:35:33] i thought it was interesting that you
[2:35:34] made that statement this morning because
[2:35:36] he don't like anybody knowing that
[2:35:37] that's who his grandfather was but you
[2:35:38] notice how he got up here he said no
[2:35:40] disrespect but his testimony got nothing
[2:35:42] to do with me
[2:35:43] he wasn't just i don't mean you know
[2:35:44] what i'm saying
[2:35:45] why is he telling you that he said
[2:35:46] because i might be his grandson but i'm
[2:35:48] his son

[2:45:46] just need a little bit more here in the
[2:45:48] monitor
[2:45:50] um
[2:45:52] brother caleb was telling me a little
[2:45:54] bit about this sermon before he came and
[2:45:57] knew that uh if
[2:45:59] the lord would lead him to go in this
[2:46:01] direction that it would be a blessing
[2:46:03] amen for the church
[2:46:06] he hid a particular verse there in john
[2:46:09] chapter seven
[2:46:09] [Music]
[2:46:11] if you abide in me
[2:46:13] and my words abide in you
[2:46:17] you can ask what you will
[2:46:20] and
[2:46:21] you know
[2:46:22] we that that whole
[2:46:25] um i'll say john 15 or
[2:46:29] that right
[2:46:31] yeah john 15
[2:46:32] john 15.
[2:46:34] that whole john 15 was one of the things
[2:46:36] that actually got this ministry started
[2:46:39] um just a little testimony we were
[2:46:43] uh i was reading my bible and i don't
[2:46:45] just bear with me y'all give me just a
[2:46:46] little a few few minutes just a few
[2:46:48] minutes
[2:46:50] but you know um years ago i was very
[2:46:53] faithful to reading the newspaper and
[2:46:55] especially the sports page i always
[2:46:57] enjoyed
[2:46:58] uh picking that up and reading it before
[2:47:00] i go to work just i didn't watch tv but
[2:47:03] i just read the sports so i can see how
[2:47:05] to talk to the guys when i got to work
[2:47:06] that's the way i was
[2:47:08] and um you know the one day i went
[2:47:11] downstairs and pick up that newspaper
[2:47:13] run back upstairs to read it
[2:47:15] and then you know i heard the spirit of
[2:47:17] lord tell me one morning and say if you
[2:47:19] read your bible
[2:47:21] as faith as you read that newspaper
[2:47:23] you'd be much fun up the road
[2:47:25] [Music]
[2:47:27] i said now i don't believe that's the
[2:47:29] devil talking to me to tell me to read
[2:47:31] my bible that that's the voice of god so
[2:47:34] uh that day i started a bible reading
[2:47:36] plan and and and i've been reading the
[2:47:38] bible every year
[2:47:41] since that time
[2:47:43] uh i can't even
[2:47:45] be honest i can't tell you exactly how
[2:47:47] many times i've read the bible through
[2:47:50] and through but i will tell you it's
[2:47:51] been over
[2:47:52] uh 20 years that i've been doing this
[2:47:55] and so i love the word of god
[2:47:58] but one day i was reading my bible and i
[2:48:00] came across john 15
[2:48:02] and when i read that
[2:48:04] the
[2:48:06] it was talking about you know how tree
[2:48:08] would be fruitful but sometimes the tree
[2:48:10] had to be cut had to be pruned
[2:48:12] in order to bring forth more fruit
[2:48:15] and i say lord what is that you know and
[2:48:18] as i was meditating i knew that was the
[2:48:20] lord actually dealing with me and
[2:48:21] calling me into the ministry just by
[2:48:23] reading that scripture and said lord and
[2:48:25] i was a song leader at the time and i
[2:48:26] just didn't really know what how am i
[2:48:28] going to do this what's gonna happen so
[2:48:29] i didn't tell anybody
[2:48:31] i just held on to it and
[2:48:33] went to a convention
[2:48:36] there in um in uh penn harris
[2:48:39] and uh brother musgrove
[2:48:41] came out and preached the message fruit
[2:48:44] much fruit more fruit and he preached
[2:48:47] from a man of john 15. i said lord this
[2:48:50] is you speaking
[2:48:52] and if there was nobody else in that
[2:48:54] convention that was going to get
[2:48:55] something from god i knew god was
[2:48:56] talking directly to me
[2:48:58] so i just began to just have a
[2:48:59] conversation in the chair with the lord
[2:49:01] i'm just praying lord i know you're
[2:49:02] talking to me what you want me to hear i
[2:49:04] said i believe you're calling me to
[2:49:05] start a church but i don't know what to
[2:49:07] name the church and there that moment
[2:49:08] god says spirit and truth tabernacle
[2:49:11] [Music]
[2:49:13] say okay lord i hold on to that and
[2:49:17] i didn't say anything to my wife i just
[2:49:19] held it and
[2:49:20] then go and announce it to my pastor i
[2:49:23] went back and faithfully served in the
[2:49:25] church for at least two more years
[2:49:27] before i said anything
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:32] and
[2:49:33] god allowed some certain circumstances
[2:49:35] to happen
[2:49:37] as these circumstances were happening
[2:49:38] they were unwanted circumstances
[2:49:41] but what god did was he was just making
[2:49:43] it so i wouldn't be comfortable and he
[2:49:45] wanted to push me out
[2:49:46] and and i launched out a man by faith
[2:49:49] and
[2:49:50] we started in our home and my wife
[2:49:53] my three daughters
[2:49:55] and for a year we were there
[2:49:56] fellowshipping like that and and i
[2:49:58] thought i lost my mind
[2:50:01] but uh my daughter was just telling me
[2:50:03] the other day and
[2:50:04] she said uh just thinking back you know
[2:50:06] my daughter rebecca said i was just
[2:50:07] thinking mac
[2:50:09] um had not
[2:50:11] these two people been obedient
[2:50:14] to the call of god
[2:50:15] where would we all be right now
[2:50:18] instead of think about what you and and
[2:50:21] mom having to stand by your side and
[2:50:23] just just look at what what what it's
[2:50:25] done for us and i say well you know i
[2:50:27] never thought about it like that i know
[2:50:28] this is nothing but all god i just give
[2:50:30] them all the glory and all the honor and
[2:50:32] all the praise
[2:50:34] and you know i was just thanking god
[2:50:36] something about the bible reading the
[2:50:37] bible that just give you your your
[2:50:39] comfort give you
[2:50:41] your
[2:50:42] your peace
[2:50:45] brother caleb um
[2:50:47] i didn't tell you this you're a good
[2:50:48] friend of mine but i didn't tell you
[2:50:51] i wanted you to just come and just let
[2:50:53] the lord use you and
[2:50:55] and he did
[2:50:56] he certainly did use you while you were
[2:50:58] here
[2:50:59] but today
[2:51:01] is and for those that are online i told
[2:51:03] you i would just mention this but today
[2:51:05] is the last service
[2:51:07] that we're having in this building
[2:51:10] this building
[2:51:12] um we got a letter
[2:51:14] a couple weeks ago from our landlord
[2:51:17] and they
[2:51:18] they
[2:51:20] gave us an option said
[2:51:22] we have somebody that wants to rent your
[2:51:24] space but they want to pay market rent
[2:51:27] we're going to give you the option to
[2:51:29] pay market rent
[2:51:30] or you have to leave by the 15th
[2:51:33] and what market rent for us in this
[2:51:35] space is is 6 000
[2:51:38] a month
[2:51:39] that's market rent
[2:51:41] so i talked it up with the brothers and
[2:51:43] we made a
[2:51:44] decision we're going to take option b
[2:51:47] we're going to leave on the 15th
[2:51:49] and um and we're going to trust the lord
[2:51:52] as to where he's going to take us to
[2:51:54] praise the lord
[2:51:57] all we know is that this is our season
[2:51:59] for a new church and for a new school
[2:52:03] that that's all i know
[2:52:06] right
[2:52:08] now if if i'm owning if i'm owning i
[2:52:11] don't have a problem paying 6 000 a
[2:52:13] month but if i'm renting i can't do that
[2:52:15] i can't make you rich
[2:52:19] i can't do that
[2:52:20] right so it's just you know just and as
[2:52:22] we shared with the church it's just
[2:52:24] where we at we're not being kicked out
[2:52:26] it's a decision that we made and we're
[2:52:28] walking by faith now you know in all
[2:52:30] honesty if i was to be honest with you
[2:52:31] we could have paid the six thousand we'd
[2:52:34] have been locked in for three years
[2:52:35] paying six thousand i don't feel that's
[2:52:38] the will of god for us to do that
[2:52:41] in rent ownership one thing rent
[2:52:44] something else
[2:52:46] so we we made the decision that we will
[2:52:50] close up
[2:52:51] this service and pack up our things
[2:52:55] and we'll go on
[2:52:57] brother jack where y'all going just walk
[2:52:59] by faith and knock myself
[2:53:01] [Applause]
[2:53:03] [Music]
[2:53:04] [Applause]
[2:53:08] so this is why i was telling everybody
[2:53:12] uh that our stream will actually go
[2:53:14] offline for two weeks there is something
[2:53:16] that we're working on and i will share
[2:53:18] that with the church amen after service
[2:53:21] that i'll share with you uh just a
[2:53:23] temporary thing that we have and that
[2:53:25] one says temporary
[2:53:27] because our permanent is when we
[2:53:29] purchase
[2:53:30] that's that's that's permanent
[2:53:32] that's permanent
[2:53:34] [Applause]
[2:53:36] um so you know just
[2:53:39] anyone that desired to join us you know
[2:53:42] and and service like uh just no call
[2:53:44] first so we can tell you where we're at
[2:53:47] you come join us but we won't be here
[2:53:49] anymore
[2:53:50] our time has come to an end and that
[2:53:52] this is what i thought was so
[2:53:54] um
[2:53:56] uh perfect i don't want to call it
[2:53:58] ironic but brother caleb was the one
[2:54:00] that spoke before we came
[2:54:02] he was the one that said lord lee you
[2:54:04] lean in a certain direction go in that
[2:54:06] direction god gonna be with you god
[2:54:08] proved to be with us 13 years
[2:54:10] 13 years and he's still with us right
[2:54:12] now
[2:54:13] it's god behind us leaving
[2:54:16] i'm going to tell you i am not giving
[2:54:18] the devil no glory
[2:54:20] god is behind us leaving
[2:54:23] [Music]
[2:54:25] this is this is what we call the tinder
[2:54:28] hannah jehovah
[2:54:33] and when they left egypt they had to get
[2:54:35] out in a hurry
[2:54:36] you ain't got time to pack up nothing
[2:54:39] you ain't got time to make no lunch back
[2:54:41] get out right now
[2:54:44] but i'm going to tell you this if they
[2:54:46] would if they would have held to the
[2:54:48] faith
[2:54:49] they would have been in the promised
[2:54:50] land in 40 days
[2:54:52] rather than 40 years
[2:54:54] so we're not gonna complain
[2:54:57] we're gonna praise
[2:54:59] we're gonna worship hold on a second
[2:55:03] i know i know now y'all wound up hold on
[2:55:05] a second
[2:55:06] [Music]
[2:55:10] that's my friend
[2:55:12] if i would have told him ahead of time
[2:55:13] it would have been a different story but
[2:55:15] i got he started talking about that
[2:55:17] testimony last night about how they got
[2:55:19] the building and
[2:55:20] he didn't even know what he was doing
[2:55:24] he didn't have no idea what was going on
[2:55:26] church was eating it up
[2:55:32] but uh i got to say this
[2:55:35] i said i'm encouraged by the word of god
[2:55:39] this morning
[2:55:41] we came to prayer and

[2:57:21] and i will shake all nations
[2:57:24] and the desire of all nations shall come
[2:57:26] and i will fill this house with glory
[2:57:28] saith the lord of hosts
[2:57:31] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[2:57:33] said the lord of hosts
[2:57:35] the glory
[2:57:38] of this latter house
[2:57:41] shall be greater
[2:57:42] [Music]
[2:57:43] than other former
[2:57:45] [Music]
[2:57:51] saith the lord of hosts
[2:57:53] amen
[2:57:55] uh and in this place will i give peace
[2:58:00] saith the lord of hosts now you know
[2:58:02] when i read that and three years ago
[2:58:04] after i read that i i wrote a devotion
[2:58:07] you know over those scriptures and
[2:58:08] devotion that i wrote i said the glory
[2:58:11] of the latter house is promised to be
[2:58:13] greater than the former house
[2:58:16] the children of israel experienced that
[2:58:19] but god's promises can be applied in all
[2:58:22] generations and this is my final
[2:58:24] statement i said therefore i am under
[2:58:27] expectation
[2:58:29] and i am claiming this for our first
[2:58:32] church building the glory of owning will
[2:58:36] be greater than renting
[2:58:38] [Music]
[2:58:41] [Applause]
[2:58:42] [Music]
[2:58:45] so when the devil think he already he
[2:58:48] got you cornered in he don't realize
[2:58:50] prophecy has already gone forth before
[2:58:53] you got to that spot
[2:58:56] hallelujah if you abide in me and my
[2:58:58] words abide in you you can ask what you
[2:59:01] will and it shall be done
[2:59:04] it's not a maybe it's not a might but it
[2:59:07] shall god promised it
[2:59:14] i say the glory of ownership
[2:59:17] is going to be greater than the glory of
[2:59:19] renting
[2:59:20] [Music]
[2:59:26] sister keisha sent me that and
[2:59:29] i was just so encouraged i hadn't got to
[2:59:31] my bible reading for the day yet and
[2:59:34] when i looked and saw the date and i
[2:59:36] said this is god
[2:59:38] god knew that that scripture would be on
[2:59:40] this day
[2:59:41] knowing that it was our last day here
[2:59:45] you tell me god ain't already ordered
[2:59:46] our steps
[2:59:49] we're going to walk by faith and not by
[2:59:50] sight
[2:59:56] i'm encouraged
[2:59:59] i am really encouraged
[3:00:02] hallelujah brother caleb come share what
[3:00:05] you had in your heart
[3:00:10] of all i think it's an honor that i get
[3:00:11] to be here on the last service
[3:00:13] and this place and when i kept saying
[3:00:15] that if i never get to come back here i
[3:00:17] kept thinking there's something funny
[3:00:18] about that statement
[3:00:19] but i'm gonna tell you what i the lord
[3:00:21] told me what it was when i said they're
[3:00:23] feeding off your anointing because i
[3:00:24] heard him say and when they're gone
[3:00:26] there'll be no more anointing here so
[3:00:28] you and then that scripture what did it
[3:00:30] say i will shake all nations can we put
[3:00:33] that back up
[3:00:35] because that just right there on the
[3:00:36] money
[3:00:43] when i say i will shake all nations and
[3:00:46] and the desire of all nations shall come
[3:00:48] and i will fill this house with glory
[3:00:50] when this house moves all nations around
[3:00:52] here will shake up and you know what i'm
[3:00:54] talking about
[3:00:55] when you're living off of anointing
[3:00:56] that's not your own you're gonna find
[3:00:58] out you needed something that that other
[3:00:59] person had i just wanted to say that the
[3:01:01] lord told me that and i was about to say
[3:01:03] something to you and i said no shut up
[3:01:04] that's not my time because you had to
[3:01:06] say it so
[3:01:08] don't you just love it
[3:01:10] how are you going to get up here and
[3:01:11] talk about speaking the word and
[3:01:12] different things and think god's not
[3:01:13] going to talk to you the difference is
[3:01:15] he gives you thus say of the lord or you
[3:01:17] keep quiet he didn't tell me to say
[3:01:19] nothing so i didn't so when he brought
[3:01:20] it out i said man i knew it and i got
[3:01:22] all excited you're right i got wound up
[3:01:24] late
[3:01:26] but i'm proud of you
[3:01:28] i'm proud of you and i'm proud of all of
[3:01:29] you and i'm proud to be an association
[3:01:32] with the spirit of truth tabernacle you
[3:01:33] remember that amazing grace tabernacle's
[3:01:35] praying for you and i can't wait to
[3:01:37] share the story because it's the same
[3:01:38] story i too went to a meeting in tucson
[3:01:42] and brother muskrat spoke
[3:01:44] and that was the final what he said was
[3:01:46] the final straw i said i've got to go
[3:01:48] that's why i was like what and two years
[3:01:50] later
[3:01:51] [Music]
[3:01:54] i started my church and something
[3:01:56] happened that made it very uncomfortable
[3:01:58] and the lord told me get out of my way
[3:02:00] so i got to do what i got to do here and
[3:02:02] i made the announcement and i was on my
[3:02:04] way and the rest is history same thing
[3:02:06] so i'm going to go back and tell brother
[3:02:07] david i'm going to call brother moses
[3:02:09] you know two churches that you may not
[3:02:11] approve of
[3:02:16] cut that out
[3:02:19] god started because god used you brother
[3:02:22] to encourage two misfits to black sheep
[3:02:25] to people that nobody wanted to get out
[3:02:27] and do something because god wants
[3:02:29] people to do what he commands them
[3:02:32] you are my friend if you do what i
[3:02:35] command you
[3:02:41] [Applause]
[3:02:45] [Music]
[3:02:47] hallelujah
[3:02:49] this has been uh
[3:02:52] that's it that's it it was already
[3:02:54] written the prophecy was there
[3:02:56] see when you're meditating on the word
[3:02:58] and you're thinking well god just kind
[3:02:59] of inspire you
[3:03:00] and at the moment you're not you're not
[3:03:02] even aware what you're doing
[3:03:04] but here you know the exact day i wrote
[3:03:07] this
[3:03:08] and on the exact day that we reach here
[3:03:10] god gives us that scripture and gives
[3:03:12] those words of inspiration
[3:03:14] so i i
[3:03:16] and and like i said the glory of
[3:03:17] ownership
[3:03:19] gonna be better than written so we're
[3:03:20] not looking
[3:03:22] to continue to rent we're looking to own
[3:03:25] that's where that's where our that's
[3:03:27] where our faith is
[3:03:29] the lord's already been providing and
[3:03:31] making ways we just need god to open up
[3:03:33] the door and last night you were talking
[3:03:35] and lord y'all just y'all bear with me
[3:03:37] uh
[3:03:42] [Music]
[3:03:45] uh
[3:03:46] but as as uh brother caleb was just
[3:03:49] sharing how um
[3:03:51] there was a man
[3:03:53] that he was
[3:03:54] he needed to get the property from
[3:03:57] that man didn't want nothing to do with
[3:03:58] it that man just didn't want to do
[3:04:00] nothing
[3:04:03] just this week i had a meeting with a
[3:04:05] pastor
[3:04:06] that we want to try to buy as church and
[3:04:09] and and and you know
[3:04:11] we just i had sat down and took him to
[3:04:14] lunch and you know tried to
[3:04:16] just do whatever i could but we had a
[3:04:18] really really good conversation and
[3:04:20] and um and you know in the conversation
[3:04:22] you know he was saying that i'm not
[3:04:24] really sure if we want to sell and say
[3:04:25] for group y'all styles are gonna be
[3:04:27] gonna cost a lot of money i say well you
[3:04:29] know little as much when god is in it
[3:04:32] and i say if uh you know just just put
[3:04:34] some numbers down and let's see where
[3:04:36] things go from there you know and uh you
[3:04:39] know and then he um told me about this
[3:04:41] experience that he went to church and he
[3:04:42] preached and when he got there to the
[3:04:44] church
[3:04:45] it was a a predominantly black
[3:04:48] congregation and he goes into the church
[3:04:50] and uh and he says um
[3:04:53] he read the scripture the effectual
[3:04:55] fervent prayer of a righteous man a veil
[3:04:57] of much
[3:04:58] so he heard the church rise up kind of
[3:05:00] the way that y'all doing here rise up
[3:05:02] read it again brother he ain't know what
[3:05:04] to do with that so you see just read it
[3:05:07] again
[3:05:10] and as he reads the factual fervent
[3:05:12] prayer of a righteous man i fell as much
[3:05:14] and i'm sitting here listening to him so
[3:05:15] you don't realize we've been in days of
[3:05:17] prayer
[3:05:18] we've been praying before i even start
[3:05:20] to meet with you we have been praying
[3:05:22] eight days straight and you tell it
[3:05:24] you're speaking it out of your own mouth
[3:05:27] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[3:05:29] righteous man availeth much
[3:05:32] i mean you don't you say you don't want
[3:05:34] to sell but god will give you a dream
[3:05:36] god will give you a vision god will
[3:05:38] shake you somehow
[3:05:41] sell the church to that group right
[3:05:42] there
[3:05:44] i'm under expectation
[3:05:46] i i came here to church thinking that he
[3:05:48] might walk in here today and say pastor
[3:05:50] god told me to give you the church
[3:05:52] that's kind of the kind of faith i got
[3:05:54] [Music]
[3:05:57] don't even know where the church at but
[3:05:58] i'm led by the spirit
[3:06:03] i'm under i'm under look we that we've
[3:06:06] been preaching about the the junctions
[3:06:09] and at the junctions we're supposed to
[3:06:10] expect a supernatural
[3:06:13] [Music]
[3:06:16] every junction you have to expect
[3:06:18] supernatural
[3:06:20] so this is our junction the seven
[3:06:22] junction is our junction
[3:06:23] and we're expecting god to do something
[3:06:25] supernatural
[3:06:26] amen if it was natural we could do it
[3:06:30] but if it's supernatural he's got to do
[3:06:32] it

[3:09:24] they got kicked out oh
[3:09:26] no you heard it from me we made a
[3:09:28] decision
[3:09:30] that we would not lock into a three-year
[3:09:32] lease
[3:09:35] even though we could afford it
[3:09:37] but we felt it wasn't the right thing
[3:09:38] for us to do especially with our vision
[3:09:41] being to own
[3:09:45] so
[3:09:47] i got some brothers that are good
[3:09:49] stewards
[3:09:50] over god's finances
