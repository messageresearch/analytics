specials that have gone forth amen just getting our hearts prepared for the word of the Lord man on today and I know we have a few announcements that I'd like to uh give but um I was just encouraged by something this week and you know we all are very aware of the uh the things that are happening there in in Israel and our hearts certainly um are for uh the people and all that they're going through and uh but there was a gentleman that um be begin to just rehearse all the things that have been happening um you know the the he made a statement he says you know uh typically there Israel has the Iron Dome that when people fire Rockets uh they can block a lot of stuff with this Iron Dome and they said that uh you know with this um Iron Dome you know we did block some but others did get through and it says you know the way that they got through we are convinced that this was not just Hamas doing what Hamas was doing and uh he says they have they got help from somewhere else and it says and you know there is only um two superpowers that have the ability to disrupt our Iron Dome and one of them is the USA and we just don't believe that the US has anything to do with this uh especially US citizens being in there it says but Russia also has the ability to uh to do some things to kind of mess up our Iron Dome so we have a feeling that Russia might be behind amen helping Hamas and um the you know the um um he you as he exit you know he just began to just kind of walk through that and at the end of it he said but I'm Not Afraid amen he says we're we're we're not in fear in Israel and he dropped this scripture you know on the people and then just dropped the mic uh Psalm 121 amen and uh he just dropped just one verse but I'mma drop the whole chapter on y'all is that's all Psalm 121 says I will lift up my eyes unto the heels from whence cometh my help I'm talking about me I don't know about you but but my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved they not leaving Israel he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber and this is the verse he left with them behold he that keepeth he made that thing personal he made that thing personal not he that keepeth the US or he that keepeth some other Nation it say our nation in the Bible he that keepeth Israel shall neither Slumber s nor sleep amen The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the son shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going [Applause] out and thy coming in from this time forth even forever more we find strength in the word of God we find confid in the word of God Amen and I just love the way he he he walked him right through it and then just dropped that on him and just dropped the mics I said that's that's just a perfect scripture I and if I had been in the session all right and that man had done something like that I would have just stood up you just turned it into Church sir you just made it [Laughter] church but I tell you we we keep uh amen we keep praying for Israel praying for amen there there's um many that are suffering uh just a lot going on so we want to just continue to lift them up in prayer uh I got a um a text this morning we want to pray for sister Erica brother Donnie's Donnie Reagan's daughter there in Tennessee she's in the hospital hospital and and having some some difficulties this morning she even um you know asked for her daddy to come by her side and typically daddy be in the Pulpit preaching but I think Daddy need to be with his daughter amen this morning so we want to we want to pray for sister Erica uh I also heard

and he's still God Amen in the midst of everything that's going on is word he is still God amen amen believe brother Troy uh asked us one time he said people would come to him and said why why God let bad things happen uh to good people and he turned it around and said well why why God let good things happen to bad people right and uh a lot of times when we look at situation like this we want to blame God no this is man man made his choice uh way since the Garden of Eden and man has made a choice and this is the results of the choice that man made so we have to live with those decisions amen but one thing we know is that God God going to keep us because we rely on him and we trust in him so amen we'll continue to do that let's just have a word of prayer amen for these requests and if you uh have a need here but you didn't get a chance to mention it just signify by the lifting of your hand we'll also remember you in prayer uh on this morning Father we come in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh many have lifted their hands not just here but those online God just see Hands lifted people have a need God they need you and Lord we realize we need you so God we ask that you

to have somebody I could trust you know in the pull pit to feed the people and brother Smiley would come all the time from okobe and uh just just take care of the church for us and and it got to a point where uh he he was the one that coined the term two churches same church in two different locations the same church in two different locations and when he coined that term I said man I like that

Bibles out this morning it's it's good to be in the house of the Lord once again this morning we appreciate the musicians and uh where an at I a I don't see her back there she wating oh there she go and that's my friend we kind of came up together uh I'm a couple of years older than an but uh we back when I used to can play some basketball you know uh now we we don't play I as I said I know you ain't she said no I ain't doing none of that I I ain't trying to get hurt no more but uh we we went to the same high school and man an was probably the baddest female basketball player in Palm Beach County the whole County uh in her day she probably in Palm Beach County Girls Basketball Hall of Fame uh but she used to talk much noise back in the day but you know um we used to have to give it to her but it's good it's good to see it when I was getting out I could tell an I've been knowing her I said that's got to be an talking to Jack when I got a little closer amen was her let's look at uh Luke Chapter 20 um 21 but it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning y'all y'all pray for me trust that the Lord will touch this this body of mine uh I've been uh giving the devil back the package that he's been trying to give me uh all week um but by his grace uh we heal this morning uh let's start at the 25th verse of Luke chapter 25 and it and it reads and there shall be signs in the the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the ways Ru men's Hearts fell in them for fear and and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw if not let's bow our heads gracious father we just thank you Lord once again for allowing us this opportunity to be here this morning and uh we just trust that we could share something that will uh encourage the Believers oh God this morning help us to get ourself out of the way give me strength in in my physical body just kind of been going through the last couple of weeks but uh we claim the victory am amen this morning uh open up our hearts and our minds to receive the word of God uh we ask these and other prayers and blessings in Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen amen you may be seated um this morning I just like to use uh I guess our topic from the last time we preached uh scriptural absolute amen and uh as a subtopic of the S poost of the second Advent of the Lord Jesus and uh the last time we had the opportunity to minister brother Jack was out out of town and like we say we always appreciate brother Jack and his confidence in us um you know you don't want to take uh these opportunities likly it it takes a lot for a man to allow you to to get behind his platform you know because you want to be able to trust the things that's being said will be be edifying not something that'll you know be distracting or leave questions in the hearts of of the people and and just do much damage so we I appreciate that like I say I pastored for a while and and if I didn't really trust you I would not let you preach it's just as simple as that we could be friends but I realize you you could say something that could make a mess and make it difficult or you could say something to unskilled people and people don't don't have the spiritual Insight that you have and do damage you I've I've you know I've watched folk you know I've been a Christian since 1988 and I've seen a lot and you you watched statements and you watched things that were not scriptural affect people right and uh so we appreciate the opportunity uh we we were talking about a scriptural absolute and just in my mind and just the way that I'm built in the way I look at things maybe a little bit of difference we got quite a few ministers in the house this morning but uh just in the way that I approach things and look at things from my years of experience we we want to you know try to make sure most of all that people are solid and anchored uh and I believe in praise but but one thing I realize if that's all this is all about uh you're not going to be able to be an overcomer and we realize according to the scriptures in the Book of Revelation every age is supposed to produce Overcomers right and and just in emotions emotions don't help you to overcome right you can shout all day and night but uh when you finish shouting if you ain't getting no word on you know like it used to be in the old days you run across people child we had just today you know boy we shouted the place that what the preacher preach the preacher did preach the Holy Ghost came in and just took over the service and he like we can't let that happen too many times you know maybe sometimes may that might happen but we got to feed upon the word but you know we we're living Liv in an hour where where we we must have I I I believe it's imperative that we have h a a Amen to what we believe an amen to what we're standing standing on and standing for is that right you you don't want to be uh shifting we going somewhere this morning y'all just y'all just pray for me I'm gonna get out the way in a minute I'm looking for the preacher to preach this morning but but we we got to have an an amen something that speaks of finality yeah right religion won't do it because religion is just a covering yeah you you cuz you can go to church out of traditions and not even be converted not even know where you stand at in the word right amen just do it from a customary uh perspective and and just really don't don't understand the book of redemption why we got a Bible and why the Bible was ever written right and and why we hold to the things that we hold to yeah right so this is what I believe I believe the preaching of the Gospel comes to give us an anchor in the soul to to settle us something that's that's an amen to us when when our world is turned upside down we we we can sleep on the boat when when when the wind when the winds and the waves when there's a hurricane going on we could just rest we can sleep right you know a lot of times when when the winds in the way especially hurricane season it's about over with thank God you know uh uh people people panic the first s of something out there I'm always seem like the last person to know huran what l i done wait it too long you go to Home Depot to try to buy some boys for you when like they done bought up everything all the water all the food all the something right but but but it says something that when when when things is happening you know you can sleep you you you you at a place of rest you know you know uh Jesus the disciple was going on in the hurricane and they had a commission to go to the other side right and and and if if they had an absolute if they had a clear perspective of their position come on the brother was just preaching on that other night they're placing the scriptures and understand what discipleship was all about those things never would have moved them but but but being face to face with those things they was pushing the panic button is that right they ran down and and Peter was you know distraught uh Master don't you care that we perish yes it's like you down here sleep on and and our whole world is being turned upside down come on right Jesus was at rest right because Jesus didn't have the same kind of concern that they had because Jesus was the absolute he he real you know even even when when he spoke and things of that nature they was like what kind of man is this right that even the winds and the waves and the Sea obey him they still could not comprehend right until after they went up to uh uh Calvary not Calvary y'all but to to the upper room and got and got a a a birth and and really locked in into that position that changed things for him is that right and and that's why that's why the new birth is important a handshake won't do it if that's all you got is a handshake you won't get in the glory you will not get in the glory with just a handshake right glory to God you know I I kind of came came up in church H me and an we go way back we we used to go to the same church when we was young and I remember those days that you know they used to open up and I think a lot of churches still do open up the doors of the church and people would come up and they would put the chairs out and you would come up and and sit and the pastor would come and then the whole church would come around and shake your hand and and and everything and they would assign you to a a deacon and and you know what all they did was induct you into just some other kind of Lodge or system or something of that nature but that that's never been the requirement right amen that that's never been the requirement the requirement has always been amen you must be born again see Jesus let let us know uh what the requirement was uh uh for the church and that's that's the change to be be born again to allow New Life to come into you is that right not not a handshake and not you know because there's there's nothing really in really right but you need something to take place in here right I I mean you know that that's good that people come forward and and and try to make a a confession but then you know when when when uh the day of Pentecost had fully come and Peter preached a sermon and and it it see and it still takes the word to prick your heart is that right to do to do the work in the heart if that's going to be any change it's got to take place by the word see see in the hour that we living in we we people do a lot of things to try to Captivate you know uh and there's nothing wrong with some of the things that we do I guess uh uh but you know people try to do all sorts of things hoping to get the Young Generation in well you know that's never been scriptural that's exactly right we we do things after they get a conversion just to kind of keep them in good Christian company and things of that nature but but but to to to have all of these different things in in hopes that we would we would get a a a generation right um this unscriptural all right see we got it we got to get back to biblical principles yes sir right because outside of biblical principles people might come up but they won't have anything to uh anchor to them and stabilize them is that right and so like we were saying we got to be stable because then when the winds come we could have rest right we we could sleep when when we don't have answers to questions we can still sleep when we when we don't know why our world is being turned upside down we we could still you know have a a a a peace in our hearts amen yes sir because just as show as you're a Christian this morning you going to have some unrest amen because the guns of the devil amen is aimed after you everything that the devil got he's shooting at you is that right 36 years he's been shooting at me right and and and the only hope and the only rest that I got is in Christ y'all keep praying for me I'm I'm go somewhere this morning see so so this is why we we got to have an absolute which is something that speaks of an amen an assurity something that's that's real something that's our anchor as an individual can't be a family thing God ain't got no grandchildren all right I got my first grandbaby but you know he won't be able to go in all right notless he a baby you know because the token is applied right right right but if he get to an age accountability he own his own see like the young people this morning you know you on your own they might have the token applied but you got to make your own personal confession and have your own personal possession Oh Glory to God well well my daddy's this and my daddy that well I was the pastor of the church but but but what does that mean what does that mean to you where what's your absolute right brother Jack got children right and but they got their own personal absolute thank God for my nieces right amen I got I got children amen and and and you know they got to have that their absolute right they got to have the amen manner on the inside of them glory to God hallelujah all of our children you know we only thing that we could do we we could bring them up in the way that they should go right that that if they depart see we still in the Bible right see well well they doing this you know and I I remember when my children were young and and everything and and I didn't know what they would do and and what what they would be and what they would become and things of that nature you know uh you can only hold on to the fact of what the Bible has said and so so now you know they they they got their own minds and their own makeups and their own characteristics and they doing their own things but you know I've gotten to a place that those things don't even bother me all right all right right it it don't it it can't only only thing that I can trust in I could trust in the promised word right glory to God and that that's it no no matter what it looks like today it don't even matter glory to God no matter what your situation look like this morning you know if if it's not what you think it ought to be it it shouldn't matter to you as long as you got a promise in his word hallelujah that's the thing that amen you hold on to glory to God that's that's the thing that's that's your amen amen so so this is this is where we at this morning uh I I want to kind of shift gears into kind of what we we we want to preach a little bit on that's just our our title uh for the next hundred sermons all right it's scriptural absolute because because because I believe the ministry is is trying to stay scriptural and prove What We Believe by the scripture not not emotions not our opinions but but what what God has already already said is that right glory to glory to God y'all bear with me for a second now uh if we could pull up our our first quote this morning from faith is De substance 1947 uh to just kind of we we got to get in an understanding of of the climate of the day yeah right we we know there a lot of lot going on and and and brother Jack was just talking about isra and I I I've kind of been hearing bits and pieces I haven't taken the time to really you know look at it because I already have my my understanding about it so uh uh I don't spend a lot of time uh kind of getting into the well they doing this and doing that well one one thing scripturally we know that amen they can't destroy all of Israel right because because of the Bible they they got to receive their two witnesses right they got that that's that's that's got and it's got to be if that's the case has got to be somebody there is that right when those two witnesses appear that'll receive their day in its message is that right so so I'm I'm not really and and and you know in the book of uh uh Romans if you go back to Romans 11 you know uh they were they even back then they were wondering about you know Israel and Paul let them know says listen they were blinded in part for your sake right amen because had they receive amen Christ then we wouldn't had an opportunity so God blinded Israel that they could reject Christ right amen so that we can have an opportunity at at the word at the grace right right that that we could be a Biblical part of scripture because according to the shadows and types of the Old Testament we were there even when we didn't even understand the Old Testament Bible we were we were represented even when we go all the way back to Genesis amen we were represented all right right glory to God Amen we were represented in the all way before even Genesis 1 and one we were in the mind of God is that right that's right God God fornew us that's right right if he didn't for know you you wouldn't be here this morning see we not here by chance this not happen stance this morning right everything that God done amen God done it for me when when the Jews amen cried out for his blood right yes sir amen those things happened because I was in the mind of God I was in the mind of God predestinated when I was messed up in the streets and on drugs amen Calvary was about me their rejection was about me glory to God see if you go in there see we we was grafted in you know not according to Nature right that's right but but the sovereignty of God grafted Us in amen right right and in the book of Ephesians when they were struggling with the Gentiles coming in those those you know Jews in the they was struggling it was a real struggle right for him talk about it cuz they was they was on the outch y'all know how it is when when when when somebody new come in everybody that was there get funny feelings and and all of that who is him and who is she and y'all ought to preach with me this morning and and Paul had to settle the people way back there realizing it's just a part of Amen God's plan and purpose because God Amen had a a picture in View and that the picture in the beginning was uh natural Adam and a natural Eve the picture in the in in in the in the in the end will be am man a spiritual Adam and a spiritual Eve right glory to God if Adam had a wife in the beginning Adam going to have a wife now right right in order for the picture to be what the picture amen was in the beginning right if he had a Eve then he got a Eve now oh everybody ought to praise him off of that see and and having the ability to recognize these things is Paramount right not not just religion right to recognize amen yourself in the scripture Amen to be able to recognize your day in this message come on man is that right that's that's Paramount yes sir cuz a lot of people can't see themsel in scripture that's right right looking looking at the shadows and types they can't see that's me right there right when I look at when I look at Rebecca I see myself come on oh we could preach on that glory to God we can preach on that Ela went to find Isaac a wife amongst his kid folk huh yeah and and right she she they got to a place and and and you know uh uh and we've had our spiritual Ela right hunting a hun the wife we move from that I'm me get into that huh see we can see ourself in the types and shadows of the scripture you know when I was a new convert man you used to read the Old Testament especially when they was doing all this killing and all of that stuff man he's like man what's this all about but but it's spiritual right they had natural Wars we got spiritual battles right but if God brought them through God to bring us through I like I like Marvin Sapp Never Would Have Made It glory to God but but let's let's look at something this morning right uh it says this day that we're living in it's such a day of unsettled peace but it's scriptural now glory to God it's a day of unsettled peace but I I I want to stop here right but that's for the world right that that's for the world see that's that should be a peace in the heart of the believer right when when when everything when everything is going on around us that should that should be a piece right that should be a settling right glory to God glory yeah because these things has been spoken about and they're not coming they're here right amen he says uh It's A unsettling peace and unsettled rest everywhere amen he says people are running to and fro speaking what whatever they may right most anybody can get a follower that's true most anybody can get I'm telling you Church you you I'm going say something this is why God gives us Shepherds come on people don't believe in hardly believe in pastors no more we we got our own way of doing things now but but you cannot break the order of God an evangelist if if you ordained to be an evang you can't be a pastor you won't have you won't have the tools you won't have the makeup a teacher none of those different things right God gives us Shepherds to feed us and lead us they're ordained to lead you through brother Jack is ordained to lead this Church through that there's an order go back to the Book of Joshua right you could not get ahead of Moses go Moses was God's mouthpiece to the people Moses had the instructions right amen and who could get ahead of that that's right right yeah amen I'm I'm a minister and I got pastor story experience but amen I'm under headship I'm under the leadership of brother Jack I don't try to be annoy at all I stay out of his way and let him lead this church is that right because I already know the damage that can be done when ministers get out of place I already know that firsthand all right all right yes sir yes sir it's a it's a real task Amen brother quo used to Pastor it's a real task it it's a lot that goes along with it more than just preaching a sermon that's probably the easy part that's right especially once the preacher come and you start feeling your help and uh you know you feel like growling and groaning and you know that's the easy part all right but the the the hard part is is is trying to cultivate people and manage people and and and keep people anchored and settle people and and and point out things to a younger generation and and help the Young Generation to know that that boy don't mean you no good and that g don't mean like my grandma used to say that g don't mean you no good amen and and and and and that's that's where the difficult part come in well see D we can't do nothing what they we can't do nothing all we can do is go to church help me preach come on the Deacon over there preach with me huh come on church cuz cuz you want to do a lot of things you want to go a lot of places that'll be detrimental to you that that that'll things that'll happen to you in those places that'll affect your life 25 years up the road listen church I know what I'm talking about I'm affected by things that happened to me as a [Applause] child come on come on Amen and and and man you got to learn to navigate cuz you things can happen happen to you you can put yourself in positions or your parents can put you in positions and things happen to you right come on and and you affected by that that thing your entire life that's right even even in your marriage and everything else and trying to raise your children amen you you you so affected by amen something that had happened to you that nobody knows that's right you that's right you preach see I you know I I I realize you know I've never been understood right but I don't even care I know who I am I understand my stand and why I do what I do based upon the word right right glory to God glory to God Amen so so and being a Shepherd you know is a great responsibility right it's it's it's not just you know a title cuz cuz man you be want to get that title back man who I ain't never I I I'll be honest with you when I did Pastor I never wanted to I wanted the evangelizers I wanted the glory I wanted everybody to like me everybody to Pat me on the back y'all know how is when brother di come he run the A and woo and Shak y'all tear a building down but he leaves and you be like praise God brother digs come on now and then you know brother Jack come up Wednesday night with practical teaching you be like oh Lord should I should I should or should I should not go to church today cuz ain't nothing cuz ain't too much nice about Wednesday night now Sunday everybody show up on Sunday cuz he going to make make you feel pretty good he going to bring the shout out you everybody pping fist but Wednesday glory to God take his time and make you feel it y'all know what I'm talking about you know your mama used to beat you especially the ones that used to take their time cuz they want you to feel every lick yes Mama a a they take their time they don't be in no hurry they let you settle in a little minute talk to you a minute I I wasn't there one of those parents my boys my boys used to always say we' rather you beat us than Mama cuz she want to talk to you she want to beat you a little bit and then she want to hug you and tell you why she did it see me I ain't had time for all that I'm tired she done put me up to it as it is you know I've been wanting to let y'all off the hook but go get in here lay on the bed don't move co co they like rockets am amen but but let's get back on task glory to God glory but he says people are running to and okay we we got to be careful of what we following this is the great age of information and and and and podcast I ain't never seen so many podcast in my life and and I I be curious ious about the information you know everybody a can't do this but you know I'm I'm pretty seasoned and and I like to listen but I have trouble with the information most of the time because I realize most of it is secular and it's not biblically based right some of it is good but just as a whole if if we if we would get back to the Bible back to the order of things we wouldn't really need all of the things that we have all of all of these different podcast and then a lot of that stuff is just really foolish right but they got followings and they making money right and and you you can get on these different things and you you could listen to these things and I mean it's it's all sorts of levels and ring right spiritually you got to be careful what you listening to and who you listening to right because it's it's something that's out here that'll feed your spirit right amen something out here that that that'll feed you especially when when you a little weak and weary and broken a little bit it's something out here what looking for my God right but the thing that's out here is it getting you closer to Christ is it strengthening you is it producing a holistic view of the the person that you are come on all right all right I know brother wo told me don't do it but sometime I want to just pull y'all I'm trying to change a little bit I know things have to settle come on got to settle a little bit now y'all got to realize I ain't no evangelist now all right all right I got some years on me yeah but but it's it's the truth you got to be careful who you listening to right right glory to God what who's feeding you what's what what you're feeding on right glory to God CU cuz one word could unsettle you for for years in church and you could be so iffy yeah and and and kind of on the fence and and the gospel doesn't come to produce that am right see if if we if we're on the f this morning pertaining to any Doctrine we we need to find out how we get off of the fence and that's why we got a Shepherd like I told y'all y'all don't ask me no questions cuz I ain't the pastor asking the brother J but but if if there's something if there's something that you don't understand that's being taught then then then brother Jack is obligated by his calling to do his best to make sure that you're clear all right right amen because you you could never walk into a Rapture and be wavering right come on Church you you can never walk into a Rapture just really wavering yeah amen you you got to be stable you got to be anchored right go back to Ephesians that that's the calling of the fivefold ministry right but but see the thing that we're trying to do Christ is doing the calling yes amen cuz you can't come to you call and all that the father give me they coming sister T ain't you sing this song and he never lost one he didn't lose one he will not lose one this morning no matter what state they in this morning God cannot will not lose one see I can't be lost and I'm in the fight of my life but I ain't worried about [Applause] itall see God call me all right I ain't call myself that's right God called me when I was when I was at my worst he didn't he didn't call me when I was at my best right as a young fell going to pom God he ain't called me then thinking I was spoty with my crew and and had aspirations to go to the NBA and all that he a call me then come on he waited till my life was turned upside down right then God called me say you in the condition now for me to to get you where I need you to go right and I'm still a work in progress right I realize that every day like K day man I'm still a work in progress y'all is too you might as well say amen I know y'all be trying to be deep and sanctimonious we could come through here with a hammer and won't nobody say Amen when we got done y'all don't get sanctimonious on me this morning like I'm the only one got problems uh we all got work in progress and if that's the case nobody can't look at nobody funny amen that's right is that right glory to God amen amen because when the word comes you we realize boy it's a whole lot that I don't know it's a whole lot that I'm not doing glory to God amen glory to God now y'all know I just I just preach he says uh but no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them and it's a day that the prophet spoke of people when they're hungry they they eat from anywhere if children and people people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that that once eat from a nice table right so you got to be careful but if they're hungry they'll eat somewhere so I think real true Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up and going and and ought to be giv the people the right things meet in season yes sir that's right right amen we're trying to give you meet in season something that's that's relevant right glory to God glory to God trying to give you something that that's relevant something that that that's scriptural something that's that's stabilizing yeah right be because we we can see where we've gone through the the history of the Gentile church right we we've come through seven Church ages yes sir exactly right according to the Book of Revelations and and now we we in the cap right we we in the head we we've been we've been called out and up amen right Amen brother glory to God see the ra I'm I'm not looking for the Rapture right we we we we are and we're in it right glory to God hallelujah amen see we we've been called out of the Pentecostal amen uh age we're we're not a Pentecostal denomination we're not Apostolic by denomination we're Apostolic because of the book of Act is alive and real amen amen we Pentecostal by an experience an expression of Jesus Christ in our life not by denomination see by denomination they only had the restoration of the gift not the restoration of the word amen see we we have all of that plus hallelujah amen right amen glory to God Amen true not just not just you know uh signs wonders and miracles and you know speaking in tongues and Prophet line and a lot of that stuff you know that's right amen which was which was they had genuine gifts and they had their part the isua street and all that that was that was their portion yes but but we've we've moved out of that in into a great light yes sir AR rise and shine thy light has come the glory of the Lord is was risen yes sir is that right we we got light in another day they had light for their day right but see we understand the history of the church ages from Paul all the way up right amen is that right glory to God Amen we understand amen Paul's Ministry to the ephes Teaching Ministry we understand that and and just all the way up to Luther and Wesley Pentecost we understand their Ministry by the word right glory to God amen amen but we we're in another day and and it's it I'm me tell you something it's a blessing to be able to recognize your day in this message that that's not a skim milk statement right cuz because there's a lot there's a lot that's that's that's transpiring around us amen but the way that I look at it from a scriptural standpoint I'm not moved by it right because I recognize the day and hour that I'm living in another quote from uh 1954 the great and coming revival and outpouring of the Holy Spirit he says um uh do not like to say this but after to travel in many many nations and seeing the conditions of the other nations right thinking of our our lovely Nation here it's great and they say to be an American yeah I say this to be a Christian I've been elevated glory to God because being American comes with a lot but we got to be identified with with in glory and the shame to be American and sometime it's more shamed than it is Glory come on Church come on church it's more shame than it is Glory but but we identified glory to God I mean way back way back in the day when when the American people they used to put a sign up in the catacombs over there and say to the American women you know put on some clothes right the the what reference the dead right but but come on Church look at look at it now look just just look at what's reality to the people now yeah right and and and I'm quite sure an could attest to this when we went to school we went to school kind of dressed up and clean didn't we huh we I mean we had our competitors nor showing them when you went up up into nor show you had to have your girl ready yeah it you say just contact it was what it was they wouldn't make it now man you you see them coming to church they wouldn't even let you in the school yard with dukes on Billy out man you where you going with that you can't come up here you got to go home and change yeah yeah you had to go on further more your parents want if you had something like that you had a head deep down in the darkness of the closet and you had to sneak over your friend house and put it on and take it off before you came back home I never foret I never forget little cousins they were creeping leave the house say Sanctified Holy Ghost Fifi baptized skirts on and everything get down the street had the stuff in in the alley they changing and God spoke

good right and people mind why he just always against everything this is let me tell you something I have a lot of natural and spiritual experiences yeah I ain't talking about stuff that I wrote out a

to close right see he gets me in trouble cuz every time he say preach I be wanting to keep going but I know I I know I got a time limit right and I'm I'm I'm at my time but but I I'll I'll read this finish this quote then I I'll let you go maybe we'll come back to it he said uh he said the signs of destructions are hanging everywhere this is this is what we're we're we're seeing right the of Destruction because men are walking right like they did in the days of Noah after their own will instead of seeking the will of God right God's will is his word glory to God check check check your walk out by the word and that that'll show you whether or not you you in the will of God right amen if if you can't find what you're doing in the word you might not be in the whe amen right Glory he says our world has become modern every civilization that's built up till they hit the climax then the Pinnacle swings and she goes to the bottom and and that's where we haded right glory to God I'm pretty sure by the reading of the scripture and the signpost that that we're passing that we're nearing the coming of the Lord Jesus right see what we're seeing is signpost to us right of his his second Advent to the world then he will have one one more event to come I'm I'm I'mma go here and then I'mma quit y'all bear with me all right he says there'll be three advents of the Lord Jesus the first to redeem his bride that was that's that's what Calvary was all about right to pay the price of redemption we had a debt we couldn't pay it was it was too big sir right he says um he says the first is to redeem the bride when he died for her he said now the second this where we at now to receive his bride that's what that's what the Rapture is all about that's why we're here trying to get in condition to leave here yes sir right you get in Rapture in condition that's a quote amen right and and see the only thing that can get us in that condition is the word that's right amen you can be excited all you want to but it takes the word to get you in the condition to to wash you to cleanse you right to transform you to renew you is that right to settle you amen if it wasn't for the word of God I don't know where I'd be at this moment is that right that's that's my only hope is the word amen glory to God all right I'm almost there amen he said says uh he said when uh when he comes for her he said then the third with his bride for the Millennium and and and there'll be three advents and one of them is pass and the signposts are showing that we're near the second event right sir that's the arrival right or the emergence or the materialization right the second event of the Lord Jesus we've tried everything we've had all kinds of big you know four meetings and so forth but but Church you know um we we we're we're at a we're at a point now where it's important that we're clear about what's going on that's right is that right that that we we when we when we look at things we we are clear about what we're looking at it's it's it's a blessing to be able to recognize the signpost and and the sign post produce an urgency right cuz when when anything major happens right it it if you're a part of God it seem like it sends an urgency right it like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I heard that before huh but to not be able to recognize let the musicians make their way to not be able to recognize the day and hour and the sign post that's on the you cuz we've been on a journey and and and you you're going somewhere we've been going to a Rapture right a change of our bodies we've been preaching this second coming and now we we we've been seeing all along and just to see what we see it's an indication that we this thing is coming to its end right cuz I ain't even get to it but he's going to graft in again yes sir right Israel the gospel is eventually as it relates to the Gentile churches this thing is going to come to an end right we we don't know when that last predestinated seed comes in then we'll go we don't know who that is when that'll be but you got to be ready right you just got to be ready we just sing that song will you be ready right when Jesus come will you be ready when Jes will you be ready I think brother Jack know this one when Jesus come will you be de in [Music] Jus comes let's give the Lord a hand of praise for his word appreciate brother Smiley man I was just um thinking just how perfect uh the sermon was for just where we are um if you go back and look at the scripture that he read uh out of Luke chapter 21 there should be signs in the Sun and in the Moon and the stars and I believe it was just yesterday uh we had a a solar eclipse uh and um again that's a a sign you know we we know that the war and everything is going on over in Israel and and uh the scripture you know just talked about these things these are SST uh you know he was just reading that and and as we just just sometime pause and just take a look around uh listen to what's going on around you you you realize that the sign post are just showing uh all the time and uh the the the critical thing here is that when we see the signpost we need to start making greater preparation a little bit too much amen uh and um I don't I um I'm sure many of you all have taken uh trips before and I've with my family I uh I was blessed to have my wife and three daughters and uh so when we would take trips especially in the car um if we were going to a meeting um something you know going to a convention or something like that they always wanted to know give me just about let us know how long before we actually gone G get there because before we get there I need to make a stop and and um they would be dressed a certain way in the car not not you know anything ungodly or anything like that but maybe they might have rollers in the hair are y'all talking to me yet they might have rollers in the hair they might have that scarf on Bonnet Bonnet they might have the Bonnet on because the Bonnet is on to protect the hair y'all talking to me but before we get there I need to have all these things in place but but but but but when we arrive I'm not walking into that place with this Bonnet on I'm not walking in there with this these rollers in my hand I'm going need to stop and I'm going need to get myself prepared before I actually present myself and and see so so there was greater preparation that took place at the time of our yes and and and I'm here to let you know this morning I stopped by to tell you it's it's it's greater preparation needed right now you got to look at the signpost that brother Smiley was talking about it's the second Advent of the Lord Jesus Christ and now it's time for greater preparation not just preparation but greater preparation amen we need a scripture absolute we need a scripture absolute abute and and there's no need for us to be wavering now we've been we've been this this we we've been in this way for a long time and uh and and and I I I am I was telling my wife this morning that um you know uh people that have these different thoughts about the prophet and about the message and and all of this just just I don't know where they get these thoughts from all I can tell it's a spirit that comes into the land and attacks the people people and and the sad part is that they don't realize that is a signpost the signpost actually said that you know there would be a greater there would be a fallen away right and uh so so uh there's a couple things I can tell you the the scripture also says that as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so a signpost is is that there is a spirit that will enter into the land amen that will attack people people and cause them to move into the life of a man this homosexual lifestyle right it's a spirit that comes in it's a spirit that causes people to do the great Fallen away it's a spirit that actually comes into the land and and if you're not uh uh um if you're not if you don't have a scriptural absolute then you won't recognize the spirit that's attacking people that's all it is it's a spirit so the Lord showed me say you know brother brandom had a vision one time he had so certain seeds it sold these seeds you know in the earth traveled around the world seven times and he sold all these seeds but he said then after he left there was a man dressed in black that came at right after him and what did that man begin to do he began to seow seeds now here's the thing it's not our job to go pick up the seeds that the man in black sowed according to the scripture we let them grow together and when they grow together you just keep living your life but let them grow together and at the end Jesus Christ himself will do the separated sheep on this side goats on that side so we ain't got nothing to worry about it nothing to fight about nothing to I mean just just you just keep doing what God called you to do and and know that somebody there's going to be somebody dressed in black coming right behind everything you doing yeah hello somebody amen amen but I'm holding on with everything I got I thank God for the promises that God has given me no matter what my family is going through I I ain't looking at I ain't thinking about God told me all all that the father gives it said they will come and then I never lost one no not one right Just Keep On Believing yes my Mama Sang it mama mama wrote it she sang it and to Keep On Believing you know what she said she said because the the work is already done all that like brother Smiler say I mean the storm don't upet your life I mean just I mean you turn this over and life turned upside down but I'm sleeping on the boat and then you and and I'm sleeping so sad that people have to come and shake me and wake me are you even concerned about well actually I wasn't because I was going to the other side I ain't know how I was going to get there but I know I was going Hallelujah but since you woke me since you woke me let me walk up here to the front of this boat and just kind of shake this sleep off put my foot on the front of the boat
