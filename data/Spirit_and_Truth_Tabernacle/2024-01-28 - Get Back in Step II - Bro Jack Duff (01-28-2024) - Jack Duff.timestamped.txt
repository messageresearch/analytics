[4:38] good to have him Amen on this morning uh
[4:41] in in in Fellowship God is God is good
[4:45] uh we had a um our meeting on
[4:49] um on Friday night and there were a
[4:52] number of things that were discuss but
[4:54] uh two big things that I wanted to make
[4:56] sure you all were aware of one of them
[4:58] is I got a I got to thank
[5:02] um some brothers for the efforts on
[5:06] yesterday uh brother Calvin uh brother
[5:11] Maris um brother
[5:13] Xander and brother
[5:16] Xavier um brother Garen brother Quinton
[5:21] Jr brother Quinton
[5:23] senior Amen brother
[5:25] Troy uh they went in we had two Bab and
[5:30] we had told you all on Friday night that
[5:33] uh we were paying roughly $11,000 a
[5:35] month for those bays and uh but they
[5:39] said if we would just move our stuff
[5:41] into another Bay then we could probably
[5:44] cut that in half and I think we were we
[5:47] projected that we were going to go from
[5:48] $1,000 a month to $570 a month and uh
[5:53] that was that was a real blessing but
[5:55] what happened on yesterday is um that
[5:59] the project section of 570s that we were
[6:01] going to have two uh Bays really the
[6:03] same size again but uh what happened on
[6:07] yesterday is that brother uh Calvin
[6:10] anointed in this uh area he
[6:15] stacked stacked it so high and got
[6:18] things in there so tight that we did not
[6:22] need to purchase another Bay the same
[6:27] size so there for amen we reduced it
[6:32] even
[6:34] more and uh where we thought we would go
[6:37] from
[6:38] $1,000 a month to 570 I think brother
[6:42] Quinton told me because of what brother
[6:44] Calvin brother Garen brother Troy
[6:48] brother quinton's uh the two Quinton uh
[6:51] brother Maris brother Mark I forgot
[6:54] about him brother Mark uh and uh brother
[6:58] Xander and brother Z year because of
[7:00] what they did I think our bill going
[7:02] from 1,000 a month to like
[7:05] 413 all
[7:08] right you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah
[7:13] and and you all know what happens that
[7:15] when we save money y'all know what
[7:17] happened with the savings it just goes
[7:19] right into the building fund but that's
[7:22] roughly $77,000 a year
[7:26] savings so we want to thank them
[7:29] brothers for their efforts on
[7:31] yesterday uh what a blessing they were
[7:34] uh to to the church amen what a blessing
[7:37] it was to the church and the other thing
[7:40] those that uh may not know uh the church
[7:43] did vote in a second Deacon that will be
[7:47] under trial uh he'll uh the scripture
[7:50] says that the deacons have to be proven
[7:52] first before they are ordained uh but
[7:55] brother Simba uh Mami has been voted in
[7:58] as a deacon here at the
[8:02] church praise the Lord and I know you
[8:04] don't see him today brother Simba is uh
[8:07] a student and he has to travel
[8:10] periodically to New York to class that's
[8:13] where he actually goes to school at in
[8:14] New York so sometimes he'll have to miss
[8:17] but I think he got about 6 months left
[8:19] in his schooling and he'll have his
[8:21] master's degree uh
[8:25] so Hallelujah yes uh God is is doing
[8:30] great things amen God is doing great
[8:33] things so um I think that's all I need
[8:36] to announce for right now um I want to
[8:41] read from Joel chapter 1 uh and verse
[8:45] 4 and then Joel 2:
[8:50] 23-32 um thank the
[8:53] Lord
[8:55] hallelujah uh the Bible says that which
[8:58] the palm of worm hath
[9:00] left hath the Locust eaten and that
[9:03] which the Locust hath
[9:05] left hath the caner worm eaten and that
[9:09] which the cankerworm hath
[9:12] left hath the caterpillar
[9:16] eaten
[9:17] verse 23 in Chapter
[9:25] 2 it
[9:28] says
[9:29] and well um I said verse 23 but can I go
[9:35] back to verse
[9:38] 21 fear
[9:42] not Oh
[9:44] Land be glad and
[9:48] rejoice
[9:51] why and now here the thing about the
[9:53] scriptures
[9:55] that that you have to do things be
[9:59] before you see
[10:01] things can I say that again you have to
[10:05] do
[10:06] things before you see
[10:08] things uh let me drop this uh for some
[10:12] of you while we are in this spot it's
[10:15] not a part of my sermon but I'll give
[10:17] this to you for free Amen on today
[10:20] sometimes if you want to see your
[10:23] finances
[10:25] increase you have to give first
[10:30] you don't wait till your finances
[10:32] increase to give you give from your need
[10:37] and you see your finances begin to
[10:39] increase uh some of you all might not
[10:42] have heard some of the testimonies but
[10:43] we've had uh in this church two
[10:45] testimonies that's come forth of of
[10:47] recent of people that have received over
[10:50] 20% and 30%
[10:53] increases on their
[10:55] jobs raises that are just unheard of
[10:59] but but go and and I feel like this when
[11:01] I hear testimon like that I start
[11:03] thinking man the the the the angel is
[11:07] troubling the water and I'm jumping in
[11:10] on this I'm I'm getting some of this and
[11:13] I'm I I I do not pass me by
[11:16] that's I start praying like that Lord
[11:19] Don't Pass Me By I see what you doing I
[11:22] know what you can do Hallelujah and see
[11:25] in this season we not taking lateral
[11:27] moves all right
[11:31] come on now we we increase not decrease
[11:34] increase all right church but uh but
[11:38] sometimes in order to get something you
[11:39] got to give
[11:42] something I've seen it I know people
[11:45] that have accepted the challenge to give
[11:47] a certain amount in an offering every
[11:50] week and the ones that have accepted
[11:52] that challenge they were doing it before
[11:54] they got the increases but they accepted
[11:56] that challenge and I watch God bless
[11:58] them Hallelujah rather than say I can't
[12:01] do it just take a step of Faith yes Lord
[12:04] it might mean you might not be able to
[12:06] go go to Cracker Barrel or something but
[12:08] take a step of Faith hallelujah
[12:10] hallelujah you might have to eat a
[12:11] peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[12:13] sometime but take a step of Faith
[12:17] hallu but but but but in order to get
[12:20] something sometimes you have to give
[12:22] something the Bible says fear not o l be
[12:24] glad and rejoice for the Lord will
[12:27] do great things Be not Afraid ye beast
[12:32] of the field for the pastures of the
[12:34] Wilderness do spring for the tree bear
[12:37] her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do
[12:39] yield their strength amen it's not
[12:42] unfruitful right be glad then ye
[12:45] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[12:47] your God for he hath given you the
[12:49] former rain moderately and he will cause
[12:53] to come down for you the rain the former
[12:56] rain and the latter rain and I I take it
[12:59] personally in the first month all right
[13:03] and there are some testimonies that have
[13:04] happened in the first
[13:06] month and and and you ought to say to
[13:09] yourself this month ain't over yet it
[13:10] ain't over it ain't over
[13:15] yet and the floor shall be full of
[13:18] Wheat and the fats shall overflow with
[13:22] wine and
[13:23] oil and I will restore to you the
[13:27] years
[13:30] that the Locust hath eaten the
[13:32] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[13:35] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[13:38] among you amen my God and ye shall eat
[13:41] in plenty and be satisfied and praise
[13:45] the name of the Lord your God that have
[13:47] dealt wondrous with wondrously with you
[13:50] and my people shall never be
[13:54] ashamed and ye shall know that I am in
[13:56] the midst of Israel and that I am the
[13:59] Lord your God and none else and my
[14:00] people shall never be ashamed let's just
[14:04] stop there in our reading uh you may
[14:06] have your
[14:07] seat um we are uh still in our journey
[14:12] of get back and step amen uh get back
[14:16] and step and um you know this this theme
[14:20] of uh I will restore say the Lord is uh
[14:24] where we are drawing amen our attention
[14:28] to
[14:29] um just a few comments just to open us
[14:33] up here the um I won't read these
[14:36] particular quotes but I'll just kind of
[14:38] refer to them um brother brandham took
[14:40] his inspiration for this sermon the
[14:42] restoration of the Bride tree uh after
[14:45] he heard brother Neville preach a sermon
[14:48] and uh and at the end of brother
[14:50] Neville's sermon he made a statement
[14:52] about being restored and uh so that
[14:54] struck the prophet and he went and
[14:57] picked up a dictionary and just start
[14:59] looking at what restored meant and not
[15:02] and he found the definition in in
[15:05] Webster to restore means to return to
[15:08] the former owner or to bring back to the
[15:11] former state of condition this simply
[15:14] means that you used to be
[15:17] somewhere and uh through life
[15:19] circumstances and situations it's pulled
[15:22] you from where you used to be and uh and
[15:25] God has promised that I'm going to
[15:27] restore you look at this now not I'm
[15:30] going to replace
[15:32] you no you can't be
[15:35] replaced but I'm going to restore you
[15:38] I'mma restore your mind I'm going
[15:41] restore the way you used to think I'mma
[15:45] restore the way you used to live I I'm
[15:48] going to restore you actually I'm going
[15:50] just put it this way predes the the uh
[15:53] there's a root that's laying you in you
[15:56] that's been predestinated by Almighty
[15:58] God and when the devil eat up your
[16:01] leaves when the devil eat up your
[16:04] branches when the devil even eat up your
[16:08] bark Hallelujah there is a predestinated
[16:13] root and in the predestinated roote the
[16:17] promise of restoration lays right there
[16:20] so somehow God going to have to bring
[16:22] back your bark God going to have to
[16:24] bring back your branches and God going
[16:26] to have to bring back your leaves
[16:29] I don't know how and I don't know when
[16:30] but God God said it I believe it that
[16:33] settles it other thing I I know when God
[16:36] said it settle whether you believe it or
[16:39] not Hallelujah but brother random tells
[16:42] us to restore means uh uh to return to
[16:45] the former owner to bring back to the
[16:48] former estate of condition and it says
[16:51] and we can enforce a claim to be
[16:55] restored glory to God Amen and you know
[16:59] um he says we can enforce a claim to be
[17:02] restored and and I was just mentioning
[17:04] how you know we have to uh in this
[17:07] season move from being on the defense
[17:10] Amen to going on the offense and when
[17:13] and when you're on the defense you are
[17:15] constantly trying to guess or respond to
[17:19] everything that the devil's trying to do
[17:22] Hallelujah but when you go on the
[17:24] offense you make the devil try to guess
[17:27] and respond to everything that you're
[17:29] doing Hallelujah a lot of teams they
[17:32] have more confidence when their team is
[17:34] on offense than they do when they on
[17:37] defense amen you even get more
[17:39] confidence in yourself when you are on
[17:41] the offense rather than being on the
[17:43] defense and and and and sometimes what
[17:45] going on the office looks like is
[17:47] grabbing a hold of a scripture amen no
[17:50] matter what you're going through in your
[17:51] body but begin to quote that scripture
[17:53] over your situation amen no matter what
[17:56] you're going through in your family
[17:58] begin to quote that scripture over your
[18:00] situation Hallelujah I know devil you
[18:03] got this one doing that and you got this
[18:04] one doing that I see all that but God
[18:08] told me that if I was baptized in the
[18:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said he
[18:15] says I would receive the gift of the
[18:17] Holy Ghost and then he said the promise
[18:19] Not only was for to me Hallelujah but
[18:23] it's to my family amen those that are
[18:26] far off as many yes the Lord Our God
[18:29] shall call sometimes going on my office
[18:31] is just quoting a scripture Amen in your
[18:36] situation and Watching God change things
[18:39] because he said
[18:40] it you know these brothers uh when
[18:43] brother Brandon you know talked about
[18:44] enforcing his claim you go back and you
[18:47] listen to it you know on on on the uh on
[18:50] the tape but he was making a statement
[18:52] says we got the privilege Hallelujah to
[18:55] enforce upon Satan the the claims that
[18:59] God give us all right he says uh he says
[19:03] this you can pull this one up if you
[19:04] want to sis and I'm I don't I didn't get
[19:07] the exact but just put uh privilege to
[19:09] enforce amen privilege to enforce it
[19:11] might come up right there but we have
[19:13] the privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[19:16] claims that God give us amen for God has
[19:20] a law and his word is the law Hallelujah
[19:25] and look at that says and God in this
[19:28] word and he's important to the Bible God
[19:31] in this word made certain claims to the
[19:35] church see that's so important to me God
[19:38] made certain claims to us and and and
[19:41] and and and I I I used to hear Brother
[19:42] Wesco always preach about how we Liv in
[19:44] a million miles beneath our privileges
[19:47] we we we we don't have to accept
[19:48] everything the devil
[19:50] do oh hallelujah amen he said we and and
[19:55] he said he says um uh he says he says
[19:58] God in his word made certain claims to
[20:00] the church therefore we have a right all
[20:03] right Amen to
[20:06] force these claims upon Satan I like
[20:11] this statement and say and say and say
[20:15] not just think about it but you got to
[20:17] open up your mouth and
[20:20] say give it
[20:22] back oh Hallelujah give it back and he
[20:27] has to do it because we can take God's
[20:30] agent the Holy Spirit go right down on
[20:33] our knees now see this is how we
[20:35] actually amen go on the offense amen
[20:39] it's by going down on our knees and say
[20:42] is thus sayith the Lord he's got to give
[20:44] it up that's all cuz the holy spirit's
[20:46] there to make him do it yes I'm I'm I'm
[20:50] I'm I'm I'm I'm convinced that this is a
[20:52] season where we're going to see amen as
[20:54] we operate on the offense you're going
[20:56] to see the devil giving some things back
[21:00] I'm convinced of
[21:02] that I I I said I'm convinced as we go
[21:07] on go down on our knees and we say we
[21:10] got a right and we going to claim our
[21:12] rights as Sons and Daughters of God
[21:14] you're going to see the devil give it
[21:16] back your your finances going to be
[21:18] restored if you was at a certain level
[21:21] financially if you was at a certain
[21:23] level and you don't watch things start
[21:25] to dwindle you need to tell the devil I
[21:28] ain't accepting that give it
[21:31] back God don't take from me like that no
[21:35] God go God adds God multiplies God don't
[21:39] subtract that's the devil coming against
[21:42] you and you got to Li up and speak your
[21:45] promises God promised to meet every one
[21:48] of my
[21:49] [Applause]
[21:50] needs you said I I I wouldn't I wouldn't
[21:52] be a b I'm going I'mma Be the
[21:56] Linder I'm going be that's going in and
[21:59] coming out I'm not accepting this from
[22:02] the
[22:03] devil make the devil give it back and
[22:07] God got a million ways to give it back
[22:10] to
[22:13] you you don't know what God to do but
[22:16] open up your mouth tell that devil give
[22:19] it back even in your health speak to
[22:22] that Devil he's the Lord that Health all
[22:24] my diseases even the ones the doctor
[22:28] ain't got no two or two God Is A
[22:31] Healer the devil has to give it
[22:36] back
[22:39] hall praise God but brother Brandon when
[22:43] he was saying these things the the
[22:45] testimony that he gave behind it was uh
[22:48] he says you know when when brother um uh
[22:52] I can't think of his name right now but
[22:54] the brother had a his car was stolen at
[22:56] church amen and and uh and when when his
[23:00] car was stolen at church he says that he
[23:03] um the brothers were trying to figure
[23:05] out what to do this man got all his
[23:07] clothes in the car his family is
[23:08] depending on this and and like what what
[23:10] what we going to do say well we going to
[23:12] go down on our knees and we going to
[23:14] pray and uh and they took a scripture
[23:17] and stood on a scripture when you pray
[23:20] always try to use the scripture in your
[23:22] prayer use the promise that God gave you
[23:25] remind him of what he said when you pray
[23:27] come come on church this is how you go
[23:30] on the offense by reminding God what he
[23:33] said oh my finances are ti God but you
[23:38] said you would rebuke to devour for my
[23:41] sake you also said you would open up the
[23:45] windows of heaven and pour me out a
[23:48] blessing where I had room not enough to
[23:52] receive God I'm looking for you to do
[23:54] what you said I can't do this on my own
[23:58] but I believe what you said and I'm

[26:03] knees they went on the offense and they
[26:05] made the devil give they enforced their
[26:07] claim as a Son of God and they got back

[26:30] same story in the restoration of the

[28:10] is he just pointed at devils and they
[28:13] left that same God dwells inside of

[28:36] situation where you really can't say
[28:37] nothing Adam you know at that time
[28:39] because we in public I can't say much to
[28:42] you but there is a certain look
[28:45] Hallelujah that you can give that child

[29:29] don't go Pastor look cuz you'll know
[29:31] what can happen amen you got that same
[29:34] Authority as a Son of God and as a
[29:37] daughter of God to look at that devil
[29:40] point to that
[29:41] devil praise His holy
[29:46] [Music]
[29:47] name and if I open open my mouth you
[29:50] know it's
[29:53] over glory to God that's it brother
[29:57] that's why brother bham tells us this
[30:00] and um you know in the restoration of
[30:02] the Bride tree I'm going going forward
[30:04] here uh with this he says the law of the
[30:08] land is to
[30:10] enforce is by the
[30:13] land amen for the
[30:17] land by the
[30:20] land for the land but the law of the
[30:24] spirit of God is to force Satan to give
[30:28] up that see the law of the spirit of God
[30:32] is to force Satan to give up that which
[30:36] he has
[30:37] unrightfully
[30:41] deceitfully taken from God right they
[30:45] belong to God right and you unrightfully
[30:49] deceitfully these websites that people
[30:52] is getting on
[30:54] [Music]
[30:55] deceit and and people don't even know
[30:57] that they got trapped into a spirit
[31:01] exactly unrightfully deceitfully taken
[31:04] from God Souls of men he took from God
[31:09] Souls of women children sickness of the
[31:12] body he placed upon people where God
[31:15] Made Them In His Image to be like him
[31:18] and the church is given the rightful
[31:21] legal rights by the Bible to take the
[31:23] Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them
[31:28] so everything that you face and
[31:29] everything you see that's outside of the
[31:31] will of God you can enforce upon Satan
[31:34] he got to give it back he's got to give
[31:36] it back
[31:38] Hallelujah I I I I I believe that as uh
[31:42] I was sharing with
[31:44] you this uh thought I was reading from
[31:47] the the sermon proven his I mean
[31:49] listening to the sermon Pro well reading
[31:51] I should say proving his word and
[31:52] brother brandom had made a statement in
[31:54] there and uh I was just one once I saw
[31:57] it I said oh Lord this is going to be
[31:59] our inspiration for the next year you
[32:00] know as we go in and uh I'm I'm going to
[32:04] be hitting this from so many angles but
[32:06] I that's why I was encouraging the
[32:08] brothers the last time say if the Lord
[32:10] would just give you a little inspiration
[32:11] just to hit it you know a little bit too
[32:13] brother Brandon preached this sermon I
[32:14] will restore say the Lord I want to say
[32:15] roughly nine or 10 times and then he uh
[32:18] preached restoration of the Bride tree
[32:20] but uh and then he pick it up in
[32:21] different places and just kind of hit it
[32:23] and uh it's very I think very important
[32:26] it's not you know I I I I I I've been
[32:29] around church for a long time where
[32:31] sometimes a sermon like this is
[32:32] preaching is just getting the people
[32:34] excited that's not what the the the the
[32:37] objective is I will say this if the word
[32:40] can't get a person excited then I don't
[32:42] know what
[32:44] will but this is more than just getting
[32:46] you excited this is actually helping you
[32:48] to find your
[32:50] place cuz often times all we do is just
[32:52] come to church we come to church and we
[32:55] go right back out and face the same old
[32:56] devils and and get defeated all all over
[32:58] again when we going to rise above that
[33:01] and the word is what actually to help
[33:03] help Propel us above our circumstances
[33:07] the word does it right so so so here you
[33:10] know brother Brandon was uh was was was
[33:12] making a statement here and I want to
[33:13] just bring it because this is where we
[33:14] get our inspiration from uh about
[33:16] getting back in Step he says he proves
[33:18] his word in every age he proves his word
[33:21] in every age by the most unusual way he
[33:26] says but he always does it in the same
[33:29] way now now think about that he proves
[33:32] it in every age by the most unusual way
[33:35] but he always does it in the same way
[33:38] now look at this he goes on and says
[33:40] what did he do in the days of Noah impr
[33:43] proving his word what did he do in the
[33:45] days of Noah when he's F when he's
[33:47] fixing to to deliver the remnant he sent
[33:51] them Noah now when he says that he
[33:53] always does it the same way that means
[33:56] when God get ready to do something he
[33:57] always sends a prophet and now now
[34:00] here's the other thing when God a man
[34:03] sends a prophet he also
[34:06] predestines that there will be a people
[34:09] on the Earth that will believe that
[34:12] Prophet yes Hallelujah and he also knows
[34:16] that there's going to be other people on
[34:17] the Earth that's going to reject that
[34:19] Prophet Hallelujah but he never changes
[34:22] the way he does things he always sends a
[34:26] prophet look at this now it says what
[34:29] did he do in the days of Noah my God
[34:32] this is so important to me I mean look
[34:35] look you know we all look we we all we
[34:37] can look at Noah daning man he built
[34:38] this great Ark and uh and and if I had
[34:42] been there I would have been on the ark
[34:45] that's the way we think but I'm going
[34:48] tell you your actions right now when the
[34:51] word comes in your day and the way that
[34:54] you respond to the word in your day it
[34:56] actually tells us what you would have
[34:59] did in Noah's day you realize Noah's
[35:03] message was it was
[35:05] strange it it was it was this was nobody
[35:09] saying these things I I can go from this
[35:11] church to that church I never hear
[35:13] nobody say the stuff that Noah is saying
[35:16] where he even get this from it's going
[35:18] to rain we ain't never seen rain in all
[35:21] our years how how's it going to rain and
[35:24] then somebody say why we need Noah oh
[35:27] oh somebody might might might might put
[35:29] a website out why do we need
[35:34] Noah what's the purpose of having
[35:38] Noah and and when they're doing that
[35:40] they don't realize what they're trying
[35:41] to silence the voice of
[35:43] Noah come on somebody I I'm saying
[35:47] something amen don't allow somebody to
[35:49] silence the voice of the Noah for your
[35:54] day yes sir oh his his name might not be
[35:57] Noah Moses name was not Noah but Moses
[36:01] was necessary to the people of
[36:04] God brother Bam's name is not Noah and
[36:07] his name is not Moses but his ministry
[36:10] was necessary to the people of
[36:14] God oh my God my God it's it's not the
[36:18] man it's the
[36:21] ministry because the ministry is coming
[36:23] from God oh thank you Jesus praise the
[36:27] name of the Lord amen the ministry was
[36:28] sent by God ordained by
[36:31] God I'm trying to get somewhere I'm
[36:34] trying to get somewhere just show
[36:35] scripture I want to show some scriptures
[36:37] here where where we standing at amen but
[36:40] here you know um it it's important that
[36:43] we understand God don't change his
[36:45] pattern right God don't change his way
[36:47] of doing things if he sent a prophet
[36:49] back in Noah's day he would do the same
[36:51] thing today Before
[36:53] Destruction before before amen the world
[36:56] just and right now it is in chaos but
[36:58] before I mean everything is lost God
[37:00] sends a prophet yes Lord and that
[37:03] Prophet is there to pray uh try to get
[37:05] the people back on the word of God I'll
[37:07] look at this now he says what did he do
[37:10] in Noah in the days of Noah when he's
[37:12] fixing to deliver the remnant he sent
[37:14] them Noah the prophet he sent Noah a
[37:18] sign and now notice when he comes to
[37:20] deliver the children of Israel what does
[37:22] he do his same way he s his Prophet
[37:27] Moses is what he's talking about His
[37:30] prophets got the word the signs and
[37:33] wonders of the word promise backs it up
[37:37] that's that's that's it's exactly the
[37:39] truth Israel made her March to the
[37:42] promised land because they believed it
[37:45] they believe what Moses said they
[37:47] believe Moses was sent they made their
[37:49] promise they made their marks to the
[37:50] promised them watch it now he says and
[37:52] in the wilderness
[37:55] Journey oh I that's why I just I I like
[37:58] these little comments uh that the
[38:00] prophet says because we we we're in the
[38:03] same spot we there were people that
[38:05] believe this with everything Hook Line
[38:09] Sinker they knew this message was right
[38:12] they KN they knew there was nothing out
[38:15] there amen that can compare to it we
[38:17] knew where we came from yes I wasn't
[38:19] born in this message I was born in
[38:23] Baptist and then uh through through
[38:25] marriage we got introduced to Pentecost
[38:27] so we got we got a taste of both we was
[38:30] going to a Baptist Church but when
[38:31] Grandma said we had to go with her to
[38:33] clean the church we went to the
[38:34] Pentecostal church and man it was tissue
[38:39] everywhere tissue all over the church I
[38:41] mean what a and we just we didn't have
[38:44] gloves back then y'all don't know y'all
[38:48] don't know nothing about nothing we
[38:50] didn't have no gloves back then and and
[38:52] now grandma say pick it up and we go and
[38:55] pick it up back we we go to the church
[38:57] ain't no piano no organ just one big
[38:59] bass

[39:04] what is that over there lady got I don't
[39:06] even know what to call
[39:08] it a
[39:10] washboard y'all young people don't know
[39:13] nothing about these instruments but they
[39:15] get in there and they start singing some
[39:17] of them songs like brother tro was
[39:18] singing this morning and all you got is
[39:20] a bass drum in the
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:23] [Music]
[39:24] washboard and and why you do that my
[39:27] granddaddy over in the corner over there
[39:28] shouting up something I even remember my
[39:31] granddaddy lost a leg he had a fake leg
[39:35] but he was still over there shouting in
[39:37] the corner with a fake leg and sometime
[39:40] it got in it got in his way so he'd take
[39:42] it
[39:45] off over there shouting on one leg my
[39:50] granddaddy yes sir I mean they knew how
[39:53] to have
[39:55] church yeah praise God but but but you
[39:59] know I mean uh uh when we when we look
[40:01] at all of that uh I mean I thank God for
[40:06] for that I wasn't born in this message
[40:08] so I didn't I didn't know nothing but
[40:09] but but when I got the Revelation
[40:11] understanding what the message was all
[40:14] about when I saw it from the scripture
[40:17] then I realized what God was doing and
[40:20] just like I just said in Noah's day it
[40:22] was a message that they had never heard
[40:24] before they never heard any of these
[40:26] things but yet it was necessary if they
[40:28] wanted protection if they wanted to make
[40:31] it through the rain he just said it's
[40:34] going to rain but he Ain tell them how
[40:35] long it was going to
[40:38] rain 40 days 40 nights of rain and there
[40:41] was I mean a flood so great everybody
[40:44] lost their lives only ones living was
[40:46] the ones that was on the boat it
[40:48] Hallelujah and and in those days I mean
[40:51] even
[40:53] animals animals had sense enough and I I
[40:57] I mean I don't know if if you would have
[40:59] been living that day you would have saw
[41:01] two giraffes coming through your
[41:06] backyard what's this two lions
[41:09] coming two tigers yes sir two
[41:13] cheaters two
[41:15] elephants I think I would have started
[41:17] and and now where are they going oh my
[41:20] yes sir and and I just see him marching
[41:23] two by two and wait a minute what
[41:26] where is all of them going and and next
[41:29] thing you know they walking right up to
[41:30] Noah's boat how did the animals have
[41:33] sense enough Hallelujah to get on the
[41:35] boat yes how did they know this right
[41:39] God gave them Instinct and and
[41:41] inspiration and they knew where to go
[41:44] and they knew exactly what to do they
[41:46] Wen sitting out there reading
[41:50] websites they weren questioning whether
[41:52] Noah was a prophet or not they knew get
[41:55] on the boat somehow they had something
[41:57] inant tell them get on this
[42:01] boat their lives were spared everything
[42:04] that was not on the boat lost its life
[42:07] but look look look look that's not just
[42:08] a historical event God allowed that to
[42:12] happen so we can see the same thing
[42:14] repeats in this day it always
[42:17] repeats all right look at this he says
[42:21] in the wilderness Journey here the
[42:23] children of Israel and come out of Egypt
[42:25] and my how they rejoicing they thank God
[42:28] for all the Miracles that happened uh in
[42:30] in in in in in Egypt and and now they're
[42:33] on the way to the promised land brother
[42:34] brandom said it only took 40 days to get
[42:37] to the promised land but because of
[42:39] their unbelief it actually took them 40
[42:44] years but they was only 40 days away can
[42:47] I ask you a question how close are
[42:49] you to the
[42:51] manifestation of your promise God my
[42:55] Lord and let me ask let me challenge you
[42:57] on something can you not speak
[43:00] doubt for the next 40
[43:06] [Music]
[43:08] days no doubt don't say nothing negative
[43:12] for 40 days amen see you should have
[43:14] wrote that down amen don't don't say
[43:17] nothing I won't say a negative word for
[43:19] 40 days
[43:21] amen
[43:24] amen amen hallelujah
[43:27] in the wilderness
[43:28] Journey it came to pass they disbelieve
[43:32] this Prophet now it happened during the
[43:34] Wilderness while they were waiting right
[43:36] before they got in they they disbelieved
[43:38] this Prophet after seeing the word being
[43:40] so confirmed look at this now and so it
[43:43] was in the wilderness
[43:45] Hallelujah we got to get it and they
[43:48] they walking amen according to the word
[43:51] they um uh now now when you look at
[43:53] scripture you'll see that I think it
[43:54] roughly took about about 10 days about
[43:58] 10 days after they come out of Egypt 10
[44:01] days before they started complaining and
[44:03] and when they started complaining God
[44:04] just got so upset with their complaints
[44:07] and he says look you know I'm going to
[44:08] delay their going in because of all this
[44:10] complaint not only delay their going in
[44:11] but I'm going to actually uh not allow
[44:15] the generation that came out to go into
[44:17] the land I'm going let them die in the
[44:19] wilderness and then take their children
[44:21] into the land right but but but but you
[44:23] can imagine all of them coming out man
[44:26] so happy to be delivered from from from
[44:28] from uh Pharaoh's uh whips and and and
[44:32] all the attachment they so happy to be
[44:33] deliver it but but as they get out in
[44:36] the in the wilderness they start
[44:38] complaining now let me tell you
[44:39] something the complaints didn't always
[44:42] come from the children of
[44:46] Israel the complaints actually begin to
[44:48] come from the people they was hanging
[44:51] [Music]
[44:54] with this is what this is what brother
[44:57] uh ancy was talking about it was the
[45:00] mixed
[45:01] multitude right it was it was it was
[45:04] some Egyptians that came out with the
[45:08] Israelites maybe some from another
[45:10] nation that came out with the Israelites
[45:13] they act like they happen to be

[49:37] bread I mean we had leaks we had
[49:43] garlic
[49:45] lemonade man we had all kind of stuff
[49:47] but but here's the problem they got to
[49:49] thinking about all the stuff they had in
[49:51] and and and and and and to eat but they
[49:53] forgot about all the whips uhhuh
[49:57] oh you forgot you was actually in
[49:59] bondage down there too you know can I
[50:02] just put it way you ain't going to go
[50:03] back to Egypt in
[50:07] Freedom right you ain't going to
[50:09] experience this in Egypt you can't go to
[50:11] Egypt and experience Freedom right no
[50:13] you go to Egypt to go into bondage and
[50:16] if they if they saw you coming they were
[50:18] they would the whips would get greater
[50:21] yes that's it but they forgot about all
[50:23] that they only thinking about the food

[51:02] With God just just serve God and and let
[51:04] me let me let me let me help you
[51:05] understand God got everything under
[51:07] control and he don't need none of our
[51:09] help praise the Lord but but but all the
[51:12] complaining is when they got out of step
[51:14] with the
[51:16] word and can I put it I don't want to
[51:18] just say
[51:19] complaining all the
[51:21] questioning y'all ain't with
[51:24] me well
[51:27] why this and why that and and I've been
[51:30] studying this for two
[51:31] years and I ain't I'm just I mean and
[51:35] but I I I've been studying the message
[51:37] for
[51:38] over 30 years I ain't found nothing
[51:41] wrong
[51:43] yet but I've been studying for two years
[51:45] and I found this and I found that and
[51:47] why this and why that and you know don't
[51:49] don't I mean this bridge and bears they
[51:51] ain't got nothing to do with the
[51:54] word that that that's personal that's
[51:57] personal and if God told him he was
[51:59] going to get a bear and he didn't get
[52:00] the bear because he was disobedient
[52:03] that's between him and God that ain't
[52:05] got nothing to do with me right I'm not
[52:07] going out get no bear God ain't told me
[52:09] I'mma get no bear you ain't not hunting
[52:12] either so what what you worried about a
[52:14] bear
[52:16] for but they just begin to question
[52:18] little things and that that seed that's
[52:21] being sown causes the people to get out
[52:24] of Step
[52:25] but I but but but here's the promise
[52:27] that I
[52:30] will I will
[52:33] restore sayith the Lord so I don't know
[52:36] how questions going to get answered but
[52:39] I do know this brother brandom say God

[52:45] fingers and he will unravel the knots so
[52:49] I'm looking for God to do that this year

[52:55] Majestic fingers maybe through a
[52:58] dream maybe through somebody prophesying

[54:24] kids maybe some maybe the kids and maybe
[54:26] some of the parents but I can just
[54:27] imagine them going through the

[54:35] through the camp are we there yet he
[54:37] told us this 30 something years ago and

[1:01:05] have faced this same cadesh Baria in
[1:01:08] their life and they made a really bad
[1:01:10] decision rather than take God at his
[1:01:13] word and go forward amen they looked at
[1:01:16] every circumstance they looked at every
[1:01:18] situation they looked at every negative
[1:01:20] thing and they believe that negative

[1:16:43] Step what Jesus said and we're going to
[1:16:45] read this in Mark chapter 7 verse
[1:16:48] 5-13 but what happened in Jesus day is
[1:16:52] they through their
[1:16:54] Traditions they made the word of God of
[1:16:58] no
[1:17:00] effect this is what denominations have
[1:17:03] done in this day through their
[1:17:05] Traditions they have made the word of
[1:17:07] God of no
[1:17:12] effect they were out of Step In Jesus
[1:17:14] day and he was certainly doing all he
[1:17:16] can and try to get him back in Step Mark
[1:17:21] 7:5 says didn't the pH sees and scribes
[1:17:23] ask him why walk not thy disciples
[1:17:26] according to the tradition of the elders
[1:17:28] but eat bread with unwashed hands he
[1:17:32] answered and said unto them well hath
[1:17:35] asias the prophet uh uh Isaiah uh
[1:17:39] prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is
[1:17:41] written this people honor me with their

[1:19:12] you know what the same spirit that was
[1:19:14] in the days of
[1:19:16] Jesus is here today I mean look at what
[1:19:20] the scripture say the people honor me
[1:19:22] with their
[1:19:24] lips but your heart is far from
[1:19:27] it and and you know I I tell y'all that
[1:19:30] there's people that's probably listen
[1:19:31] and listen online and say brother Jack
[1:19:33] ain't telling nothing but the truth I'm
[1:19:35] telling the truth but why you keep going
[1:19:36] to that
[1:19:39] church why are you still going to that
[1:19:41] church what do you in they they honor
[1:19:44] with their lips but their hearts are far
[1:19:46] from
[1:19:47] God far from God God want people that's
[1:19:51] going to worship Him how and speak
[1:19:53] truth and in truth amen and that is not
[1:19:57] just a church building or church name
[1:19:59] that is a real place that you can reach
[1:20:02] in God Amen all right let's keep
[1:20:05] reading and and oh here's the other part
[1:20:08] oh Lord this this one now Jesus said
[1:20:10] this Jesus said this he said this people
[1:20:12] honor me with their lips but their heart
[1:20:14] is far from me now watch what Jesus says
[1:20:17] how be
[1:20:20] it oh my now that was a hard one that's
[1:20:24] a hard pill for some folk to swallow in
[1:20:28] vain people are
[1:20:30] worshiping you know Cain's worship was
[1:20:33] in vain but God told him exactly how he
[1:20:36] wanted he just refused to do it the way
[1:20:38] God said it his his worship was in vain
[1:20:40] I don't care how pretty it was it was in
[1:20:44] vain how be it in vain do they worship
[1:20:47] me teaching for doctrines the
[1:20:50] Commandments of men for laying aside the
[1:20:53] Commandment of God and what that means
[1:20:55] you laid aside the word and you're doing
[1:20:58] whatever you want to do but you're
[1:20:59] laying aside the word for laying aside
[1:21:01] the command oh I can I I I I'm I I mean
[1:21:05] you know in order for a woman preacher
[1:21:07] to take the pull pit she got to lay
[1:21:08] aside the
[1:21:12] word she got
[1:21:13] to I mean she she's got to just just
[1:21:16] ignore what Paul said yeah or if she got
[1:21:19] to try
[1:21:20] to explain it in such a way
[1:21:24] that and and like like the one one thing
[1:21:26] that I always hear Paul was a woman
[1:21:29] hater is that
[1:21:32] right I I I I don't actually I don't
[1:21:35] even think I read that in scripture
[1:21:38] where it said Paul was a woman hater
[1:21:40] that that verse is not in there right
[1:21:43] but that's just something that we've
[1:21:44] come up with to try to justify getting
[1:21:47] away from the word that's right
[1:21:51] brother
[1:21:53] Every Woman
[1:21:54] preacher has to put the word to the side
[1:21:58] because the Bible say I suffer not a
[1:21:59] woman to you Ser authority over the man
[1:22:02] that's what Paul wrote and now you're
[1:22:04] going to take that now why did God allow
[1:22:06] him to put it there if he if when you
[1:22:08] call Paul a woman
[1:22:12] hater and God let him put it in the
[1:22:15] scripture you know what you're saying
[1:22:17] about God that he's a woman hater and
[1:22:20] that's not what I get from God
[1:22:24] male and female created he them
[1:22:27] amen all right Church look look this
[1:22:31] Jesus saw people getting out of step and
[1:22:33] this is why he say in vain y'all
[1:22:34] worshiping me y'all doing all these
[1:22:36] things I mean boy I've been crying and
[1:22:38] on the flowing I mean my God just the
[1:22:40] tears flowing every but in vain in vain
[1:22:43] in vain in vain you doing
[1:22:49] this for laying aside the Commandment of
[1:22:51] God ye hold the Trad itions being as the
[1:22:53] washing pots and cups and many other uh
[1:22:56] such things such like things you do and
[1:22:58] he said unto them full well you reject
[1:23:01] the Commandment of God that you may keep
[1:23:02] your own tradition you reject the
[1:23:05] Commandment of God so that you can keep
[1:23:07] your own tradition can I can I also just
[1:23:09] add this people reject this
[1:23:13] message because they know it's
[1:23:16] tight you ain't got no problem with you
[1:23:19] you don't even know brother brandom how
[1:23:20] you going to say you don't believe him
[1:23:21] you don't even know him you a read
[1:23:23] nothing about his life story you don't
[1:23:24] know nothing about brother brandom tell
[1:23:26] me about him just tell me a little bit
[1:23:29] about brother brandom you don't know
[1:23:30] nothing about
[1:23:31] him so it's not that that's not the
[1:23:34] problem it's because of what he preached
[1:23:36] and and and and and it has an effect on
[1:23:38] your life you got to change the way you
[1:23:40] live this message requires you to change
[1:23:43] the way you live let me tell you God's
[1:23:45] people have always been
[1:23:46] different in every age they've been
[1:23:49] different so we might as well be
[1:23:51] different now let me go on let me go on
[1:23:53] it says for will you reject the
[1:23:55] Commandment of God that you may keep
[1:23:57] your own tradition for Moses said honor
[1:24:00] thy father and thy mother and who so
[1:24:01] curseth father or mother let him die the
[1:24:03] death but you say if a man shall say to
[1:24:05] his father or mother it is Corbin that
[1:24:08] is to say a gift by whatsoever thou
[1:24:11] mightest be profited by me he shall be
[1:24:13] free it says and ye suffer him no more
[1:24:17] to do ought for his father or his mother
[1:24:21] making the word of God of none effect
[1:24:24] through your Traditions which you have
[1:24:26] delivered and many such things do ye
[1:24:30] back in Jesus day the church was
[1:24:32] completely getting out of Step their
[1:24:34] Traditions became more important than
[1:24:36] the word of God hallelujah but there was
[1:24:38] a few in that day that accepted what
[1:24:40] Jesus was doing they accepted his
[1:24:42] message and they got right back in step
[1:24:46] and the way we going to get back in Step
[1:24:47] today we're going to have to accept the
[1:24:49] word the revealed word for our day as
[1:24:51] God has given it to us through a prophet
[1:24:53] it brings us back in step now I'm going
[1:24:56] to show you in scripture I can't do it
[1:24:58] today but I'm going to show you in
[1:24:59] scripture how God allowed certain things
[1:25:02] to happen to get the church out of
[1:25:05] Step it allowed it with that great armor
[1:25:07] that he sent amongst him he allowed that
[1:25:09] and it happened right through the church
[1:25:11] ages it happened uh in I mean starting
[1:25:14] in Ephesus all the way through to Le
[1:25:16] theia that happened in church ages but
[1:25:18] there were certain things also happen
[1:25:20] it's right in scripture y'all
[1:25:22] I I'm going just tell you this read
[1:25:24] Revelation 2 you'll see where the church
[1:25:27] went into the depths of Satan but when
[1:25:29] you get to Revelation 3 there's three
[1:25:31] Church ages that that's listed in
[1:25:33] Revelation 3 and that's the uh
[1:25:36] sardian um Philadelphia Philadelphian
[1:25:40] and also the Le Sean age is through
[1:25:43] those three ages even the Bible have it
[1:25:45] separated like that in these chapters
[1:25:47] and in Revelation 2 it starts with the
[1:25:50] first four and it goes to the depths of
[1:25:51] Satan but Revelation 3 Revelation 3
[1:25:55] gives you the last three Church agents
[1:25:57] and it shows how a restoration was
[1:25:59] supposed to
[1:26:00] happen and I'm telling you right now
[1:26:02] we're living in the midst of that
[1:26:04] restoration that's why I could tell you
[1:26:06] a few weeks ago I am the
[1:26:12] restoration not just me you are the
[1:26:15] restoration and remember this is a past
[1:26:18] tense word this is a present tense word
[1:26:22] and this is a future word it's a Living
[1:26:25] Word thank God God bless you
[1:26:30] Church praise the
[1:26:34] Lord let's just pray as the musicians
[1:26:37] would make their way back father we
[1:26:39] thank
[1:26:40] you Lord for the word that has been
[1:26:43] given to
[1:26:45] us we
[1:26:47] uh God we can see uh what you are doing
[1:26:51] in this hour and
[1:26:52] and just thank you that these promises
[1:26:54] apply to every area of our
[1:26:58] life thank you for just Lord how the
[1:27:02] prophet just said we have to get back in
[1:27:04] step and he saw the bride somehow Lord
[1:27:07] get back in the
[1:27:09] Cadence and I believe you're
[1:27:11] calling from the north the South the
[1:27:15] East the
[1:27:16] West you're calling people Lord out of
[1:27:21] confusion
[1:27:22] out of
[1:27:26] deception calling them back to a Truth
[1:27:28] where they could
[1:27:30] stand faithfully and firmly on the word
[1:27:32] of God knowing what you have
[1:27:35] promised and Lord that we're not we're
[1:27:37] not following cunning devis
[1:27:41] fables Lord but we're following every
[1:27:43] promise that you've
[1:27:47] made we uh we just appreciate Lord Jesus
[1:27:50] uh the clarity in scripture I didn't get
[1:27:53] a chance to to to just share it but I I
[1:27:56] will in the future but Lord even just
[1:27:58] the scriptures that we we're reading
[1:28:00] about the
[1:28:02] restoration well just some of the
[1:28:04] comments that um if we were to go to
[1:28:07] Bible commentary and just see what the
[1:28:09] comments of those commentaries were and
[1:28:12] how Lord just seemed like they they
[1:28:13] missed some but they got some but just
[1:28:16] just all over the place but yet a
[1:28:18] prophet gives us
[1:28:20] clear instruction on what has happened
[1:28:23] that's why we can look even in the
[1:28:25] church ages we can see right there in
[1:28:27] the Bible Revelation 2 everything goes
[1:28:30] into chaos but Revelation 3 a
[1:28:33] restoration occurs a Reformation that
[1:28:37] leads to a
[1:28:38] restoration father how grateful we are
[1:28:41] to be a part of
[1:28:44] this Lord that there was um there was
[1:28:49] this there was something laying in Our
[1:28:51] Roots when Satan had eaten everything
[1:28:54] down there was something laying in our
[1:28:56] roots that promise of restoration was
[1:28:59] laying right there and and it has come
[1:29:02] forth Lord we pray that you would help
[1:29:06] us to see Lord all that you're doing in
[1:29:08] this hour we want to get in the ark just
[1:29:11] like the Noah and his family got into
[1:29:13] the ark we want to be in the ark of the
[1:29:15] word today we want to be covered father

[1:29:21] we're following we want to we don't want
[1:29:22] to amen reject us because of
[1:29:25] tradition Jesus you face that when
[1:29:28] you're on Earth the tradition cause the
