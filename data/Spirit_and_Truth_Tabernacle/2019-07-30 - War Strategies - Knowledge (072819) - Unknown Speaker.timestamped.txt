[52:51] that meeting the devii need to mention
[52:55] sister Verna brother Jimmy you all know
[52:58] that they're renewing their vows in
[53:01] September and I believe they gave out
[53:03] invitations to the church and I don't
[53:08] think they got the response yet from
[53:10] everybody they meet if you have an
[53:12] invitation please make sure that you get
[53:14] the response back to them as they're
[53:16] making the arrangements and their plans
[53:17] and man for that so please get that to
[53:20] them as soon as possible
[53:23] also I wanted to just mention word of
[53:28] thanks to everyone that contributed to
[53:32] our back-to-school drive on yesterday
[53:36] and it was a tremendous success praise
[53:41] the Lord praise the Lord
[53:45] just everyone that gave you know just
[53:49] supplies and backpacks and you know
[53:52] paper and you know just whatever you did
[53:54] pens we appreciated it because you know
[53:57] we didn't know exactly I was gonna go I
[54:00] think we had a hundred back tanks and
[54:03] and some other things for the high
[54:05] school students and I believe the
[54:08] numbers were up to like 95 is that right
[54:10] 97 97 backpacks were giving out them
[54:13] yesterday and we were very very pleased
[54:19] a man with the results and we just think
[54:21] sister Tina she just worked tirelessly
[54:23] endlessly just getting everything
[54:26] prepped I'm ready and I'm gentle just
[54:28] playing it all out and just everyone
[54:30] that pitched in to just kind of support
[54:32] it while we were there yesterday
[54:35] there was a lady that was going inside
[54:38] the store over here and now she saw what
[54:42] was going on and and she said look so
[54:44] organized and she happens to be a person
[54:48] that actually has given out in the past
[54:50] I believe 1200 backpacks and one drive
[54:53] and so she said I got a lot of supplies
[54:56] and I'd like to just donate it to y'all
[54:58] and so this morning she brought all the
[55:01] supplies for us amen that we can use it
[55:04] the next drive and we thank God for that
[55:07] praise the Lord
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:11] and then we also got another telephone
[55:12] call from a man of sister Tanya told us
[55:16] that her daughter of sister Candace
[55:18] wanted to give us a hundred backpacks
[55:22] and so we already I mean that happening
[55:25] yesterday after we left so for the next
[55:28] year we were doing a little debrief
[55:30] yesterday I saved 200 bags next year
[55:33] where we got a 113 of the 200 already in
[55:36] one day so so we need about what 67 1 so
[55:45] we have 130 all right so we need 70 we

[59:33] I'm reading from 2nd Peter 1 this is our
[59:37] foundation and our journey and man we've
[59:41] been taking we got a little series
[59:43] that's going at this point in time war
[59:47] strategies a man war strategies and
[59:50] we're using the statue of a perfect man
[59:52] as a foundation for those different
[59:56] strategies and I trust that the Lord
[59:58] just continue to bless our efforts I was
[1:00:02] told by my uncle we had a family reunion
[1:00:05] last weekend my uncle said I'm enjoying
[1:00:07] the series you and Joe let's see here
[1:00:11] he's is a water
[1:00:13] I say what and he lives up in Washington
[1:00:17] DC so he's watching the videos as they
[1:00:20] go up and and enjoying the series and
[1:00:23] say well praise the Lord you just never
[1:00:26] know who's being blessed by what you do
[1:00:28] and and that's that's all of us right so
[1:00:31] when we come we have to be yielded you
[1:00:33] know those who's who's getting strength
[1:00:36] from from what you do a man the song
[1:00:39] that you sing might be the right song
[1:00:41] that went cursed somebody at the time
[1:00:44] that they lead him right so we want to
[1:00:46] come a man and and and just yielding
[1:00:49] ourselves to the Lord and allowing him
[1:00:51] to get all the glory all the honor and
[1:00:53] men here in 2nd Peter 1 I'm starting at
[1:00:56] verse 3 according as his divine power
[1:00:59] have given unto us all things that
[1:01:01] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:01:03] the knowledge of him they have called us
[1:01:06] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[1:01:09] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:01:11] promises that by these we might be
[1:01:15] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:01:18] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:01:20] world through lust and beside this
[1:01:22] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:01:24] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[1:01:28] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:01:30] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:01:33] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:01:35] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[1:01:38] things be in you and abound they make
[1:01:41] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[1:01:43] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:01:45] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[1:01:48] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:01:52] and I've forgotten that he was purged
[1:01:54] from his old sense
[1:01:56] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:01:58] diligence to make your calling and
[1:02:00] election sure but if you do these things
[1:02:03] you shall never fall Amen if you would
[1:02:06] also turn with me to a passage over in
[1:02:10] 1st Kings chapter 21 amen today our
[1:02:15] topic is war strategies knowledge amen
[1:02:19] we'll be focusing on the
[1:02:21] the virtue of knowledge we've talked
[1:02:24] about faith and we've talked about
[1:02:26] virtue amen but today we will spend time
[1:02:29] talking about knowledge it men here in
[1:02:32] 1st Kings 21 verse 17 it says and the
[1:02:38] word of the Lord came to Elijah the
[1:02:42] Tishbite
[1:02:43] saying arise go down to me 1/2 king of
[1:02:47] Israel which is in Samaria behold he is
[1:02:51] in the vineyard of naboth with him he
[1:02:54] has gone down to possess it now I find
[1:02:57] it quite amazing when we read this
[1:03:00] God sent Elijah after they both had died
[1:03:06] right now he could have sent him before
[1:03:11] but he actually chose to send him after
[1:03:15] they both had died all right and you
[1:03:19] know we were we were reading something
[1:03:21] on Wednesday night there and the prophet
[1:03:25] Isaiah had been had been cut in half by
[1:03:28] a wicked King at the time before he
[1:03:31] repented you know he was he was a very
[1:03:34] wicked King Manasseh he I mean they they
[1:03:36] said there's a couple of different
[1:03:37] things but one of them said that Isaiah
[1:03:39] got inside of a tree to hide from the
[1:03:41] king but the fringes of His garment let
[1:03:44] everybody know that he was there so the
[1:03:46] king ordered somebody to come and cut
[1:03:47] the tree in half and they cut the
[1:03:50] prophet in half and you know what
[1:03:52] brother Branham say he was sent here for
[1:03:54] witness that was that was a very purpose
[1:03:57] Isaiah was sitting here for witness God
[1:03:59] could have stopped him from cutting that
[1:04:01] tree but it didn't allow it but he was
[1:04:03] sent here for a witness right and and
[1:04:06] sometimes you might wonder why I'm going
[1:04:07] through that you sit here for a witness
[1:04:09] somebody get strength from the trial
[1:04:11] that you going through right so don't
[1:04:14] complain hey man we got to learn we got
[1:04:17] to learn to count it all joy all right
[1:04:22] Alleluia I'm telling you something when
[1:04:24] we when we I can't always forget the the
[1:04:28] messenger
[1:04:29] who did it but they said the man could
[1:04:32] not remember 15 minutes out of any day
[1:04:36] that he was discouraged he wouldn't he
[1:04:39] wouldn't let discouragement go past 15
[1:04:42] minutes I think brother Caleb give
[1:04:44] people advice like that when he talk to
[1:04:46] him say you can have a bad day but just
[1:04:47] a lot out so much time for your day to
[1:04:51] kind of talk about that that day and say
[1:04:53] like like you got a lunch hour after
[1:04:55] after lunch get back into work brother
[1:04:59] Caleb and tell them they have a lunch
[1:05:00] get back into work so after you finish
[1:05:02] talking about your bad day you screaming
[1:05:03] and kicking and punching the walls and
[1:05:05] all that get back to work no just keep
[1:05:10] holding onto it a lot so much time and
[1:05:14] i'ma take 15 minutes that's it that's it
[1:05:17] that's all you got 15 minutes that's it
[1:05:28] put a smile on your face God can do all
[1:05:36] things a man and here we see him verse
[1:05:40] 18 says arrives go down to meet they
[1:05:42] have king of Israel witches and samarium
[1:05:45] but he is in the vineyard and a boss
[1:05:47] tells him exactly is whether he has gone
[1:05:50] down to possess it and and and thou
[1:05:53] shalt speak unto him saying thus saith
[1:05:55] the LORD hath thou killed and also
[1:05:59] taking possession and thou shalt speak
[1:06:02] and him saying thus saith the Lord in
[1:06:03] the place where the dogs licked the
[1:06:08] blood of nabe off shall dogs lick thy
[1:06:12] blood even vine amen the Lord and a
[1:06:17] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:06:19] let's just have a word of Prayer father
[1:06:21] we're grateful for the privilege and the
[1:06:25] opportunity we have to come and hear
[1:06:30] your word God do you know exactly what
[1:06:33] we stand in need of here today and we
[1:06:35] pray that the Spirit of God would
[1:06:37] encourage us but strengthen us a man
[1:06:40] through
[1:06:41] the word that we hear bless every heart
[1:06:43] bless each one has come through the
[1:06:45] doors those that would even hear this
[1:06:47] sermon online we pray that you bless
[1:06:49] them and God we take every spirit that's
[1:06:52] against your spirit I mean in control of
[1:06:54] the Holy Ghost even right now some jesus
[1:06:57] name we pray amen you can be seated
[1:07:05] praise the Lord so if you let me just
[1:07:09] kind of start us off here by reading a
[1:07:11] couple quotes from statue of a perfect
[1:07:13] man and we will get into this thought
[1:07:16] war strategies and the virtue that we
[1:07:18] are focusing on today is knowledge Amen
[1:07:21] praise the Lord so out of stature of a
[1:07:25] perfect man I'm at paragraph 160 the
[1:07:29] Prophet makes the statement he says and
[1:07:30] then thirdly says then thirdly you add
[1:07:35] knowledge it says now knowledge now that
[1:07:39] don't mean worldly knowledge amen
[1:07:42] knowledge that don't mean worldly
[1:07:45] knowledge because that's foolishness to
[1:07:48] God a man I love this statement because
[1:07:51] that's foolishness to God but knowledge
[1:07:53] a man to judge judge what right from
[1:07:58] wrong all right and that's the type of
[1:08:00] knowledge you want to add now let's to
[1:08:02] be able to judge right from wrong how do
[1:08:04] you judge them if you've got Christian
[1:08:07] knowledge with your virtue and faith you
[1:08:12] judge whether the word is right or wrong
[1:08:16] amen and if you can last out all your
[1:08:19] creeps and all your unbelief everything
[1:08:23] that you claim you have done then you
[1:08:25] have knowledge to believe that God
[1:08:27] cannot lie
[1:08:28] I like that knowledge to believe that
[1:08:31] God cannot lie let every man's work be
[1:08:35] alive but mine be true amen and it says
[1:08:38] now now you're getting knowledge that's
[1:08:41] supreme knowledge glory to God you don't
[1:08:45] have to have four degrees in some
[1:08:47] college or something like that
[1:08:49] have it because all these virtues are
[1:08:51] given to you by God to place upon the
[1:08:55] foundation of your faith that you might
[1:08:57] come to the full stature of a real
[1:08:59] living man of God yes sir
[1:09:01] now that's an important statement to me
[1:09:04] all right
[1:09:04] the Prophet says all these virtues are
[1:09:08] given to you by God
[1:09:10] oh my now I thought we had that's what
[1:09:16] that's what the Bible say add to your
[1:09:18] faith virtue and knowledge and and add
[1:09:21] temperance and have patience and act
[1:09:23] godless all these things but but when
[1:09:25] you're really what we need to realize is
[1:09:27] that when you are born again these
[1:09:30] things automatically add to you it's not
[1:09:33] you doing it it's God that's already
[1:09:35] done the job
[1:09:36] God just needs a surrender vessel
[1:09:40] hallelujah glory to God and I love the
[1:09:43] world the way brother quake ooh Amen put
[1:09:45] it it's not because we always looked at
[1:09:47] it as you got to climb this step you
[1:09:49] gotta climb it and you got to do this
[1:09:50] and we looked at it going upward like
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:53] it's a by God is circular and what I get
[1:09:56] from that is that you know as a
[1:09:57] circulars eternal right he meant it and
[1:10:01] they're different periods of your life
[1:10:03] where you'll see this manifesting
[1:10:05] hallelujah another trial come and then
[1:10:08] you'll see that manifested and then
[1:10:10] another trial come and then you'll see
[1:10:12] that and you know any just tell it keeps
[1:10:14] going
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:46] I'm gonna be a statue of a perfect man
[1:10:49] are you gonna be the statue of a perfect
[1:10:51] woman that's what God has called you to
[1:10:53] how that's why he gave you five for
[1:10:56] ministry to bring you to that place
[1:10:58] fivefold ministry is not just to
[1:11:00] stimulate your intellect huh but
[1:11:05] fivefold ministries try to bring you to
[1:11:06] a place where Christ is on display
[1:11:09] inside of you all right all right glory
[1:11:13] let's keep on going since because all
[1:11:16] these virtues are given to you by God to
[1:11:20] place upon the foundation of your faith
[1:11:22] that you might come to the full stature
[1:11:24] of a real living man of God yes sir
[1:11:28] and it goes on says and and knowledge
[1:11:31] because knowledge of his word you must
[1:11:34] believe it in this way such as you
[1:11:37] should believe today that are accepted
[1:11:40] that the days of miracles has not passed
[1:11:43] knowledge that what God said God is able
[1:11:46] to perform a man what God said God is
[1:11:50] able to perform glory to God glory to
[1:11:53] God and it goes on he says Abraham
[1:11:55] believe that and when he was a hundred
[1:11:58] years oh can you imagine that he was a
[1:12:02] hundred years old he staggered not at
[1:12:05] the promise of God through unbelief at a
[1:12:07] hundred the man is waiting 25 years for
[1:12:10] this promise to be fulfilled and at one
[1:12:12] hundred he's not staggering huh how long
[1:12:16] we've been waiting on the promise right
[1:12:18] amen we get we got it we got it we got
[1:12:20] it
[1:12:21] he wants us to add knowledge at that if
[1:12:24] God said it he's gonna do it not only he
[1:12:27] is a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:12:29] seek Him
[1:12:32] hey man anybody diligently seeking God

[1:15:35] through unbelief
[1:15:36] look how ridiculous that word looked
[1:15:40] here's a man a hundred years old looking
[1:15:42] for a baby to be born into his home by
[1:15:46] woman ninety years old now you can
[1:15:49] imagine everywhere I looked right over

[1:15:52] testimony cuz every time I pass to open
[1:15:54] up a testimony brahim ghetto I want to
[1:15:57] thank God for my baby now this is
[1:16:00] ridiculous Abraham you've been saying
[1:16:02] this for years and nothing that's
[1:16:03] happened and and and you all are way
[1:16:05] past bearing but Abraham had a promise
[1:16:08] from God
[1:16:10] hallelujah and if you got a promise from
[1:16:12] God you can stand against everybody not
[1:16:17] only stand against everybody you can
[1:16:18] stand against any condition any
[1:16:23] circumstance you can stand because you
[1:16:25] got a right for God hallelujah glory
[1:16:30] hallelujah Manny Manny men say here's a
[1:16:34] man a hundred years old looking for a
[1:16:36] baby to be born in his home by one man
[1:16:38] 19 years OC almost 50 years passed Barry
[1:16:41] live with her since she was a young girl
[1:16:43] a teenage and here he is his life stream
[1:16:47] was dead and Sarah swooned was dead and
[1:16:50] all hopes is cold my as far as it was
[1:16:55] hopes a man but yet against hope he
[1:16:59] believed in hope a man because he had
[1:17:03] knowledge that God was able to keep
[1:17:06] everything that he promised all right I
[1:17:09] love that just a couple of statements a
[1:17:11] man I won't read these books but I just
[1:17:14] pulled it out of this section in the in
[1:17:16] the statute of a perfect man brother
[1:17:18] Brandon made a bunch of little
[1:17:19] statements there one of those was all
[1:17:22] these virtues are given to you by God to
[1:17:24] police upon the foundation of your faith
[1:17:25] that you might come to the full stature
[1:17:28] of a real living man of God nothing he
[1:17:30] says you add this knowledge when you can
[1:17:33] see that the scripture is not
[1:17:35] contradictory a man when you can see
[1:17:39] that the scripture is not contradictory
[1:17:41] now this is very important because
[1:17:43] there's many nowadays King seated you
[1:17:47] get into conversations with people in
[1:17:48] the first thing they say is we're not
[1:17:50] we're not men takes understand
[1:17:51] everything that's not correct because
[1:17:55] according to my Bible he's gonna send
[1:17:57] the seventh angel and when he come all
[1:18:01] the mysteries of God would be finished
[1:18:04] which means every every mystery
[1:18:06] everything that you couldn't understand
[1:18:08] everything you thought was contradictory
[1:18:11] amen then the Holy Spirit will bring
[1:18:14] understanding to you but that's after
[1:18:16] you received the Ministry of that
[1:18:18] seventh angel you see say he say
[1:18:21] say when you can see that the Scriptures
[1:18:24] not contradictory that you can say that
[1:18:26] and see that by the revelation of God
[1:18:29] the whole they may sense the whole word
[1:18:33] is wrote in mysteries and only the
[1:18:36] knowledge of God can reveal it so when
[1:18:38] you can get it and say punctuate every
[1:18:41] word of God with an amen
[1:18:42] then add that to your faith now when you
[1:18:44] can punctuated with a name and add that
[1:18:47] to your faith now well they talk about
[1:18:48] eastern out let me go on another a
[1:18:50] statement that he makes it when you can
[1:18:52] see that acts 2:38 does not contradict
[1:18:56] Matthew 28:19 welcome now now what do we
[1:19:00] mean by that Jesus said in Matthew 28:19
[1:19:03] go and baptize in the name of the Father
[1:19:06] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:09] Peter standing there listening to Jesus
[1:19:12] speak these words hallelujah and then 10
[1:19:16] days absent Iza speaks this Peter goes
[1:19:19] into the upper room has a mighty
[1:19:21] experience with God and then the people
[1:19:23] that are surrounding a mentor ouessem at
[1:19:26] that time they understand they saw what
[1:19:28] was happening there and these people
[1:19:29] speaking in tongues in their native
[1:19:31] languages and and all they said begin
[1:19:33] acts what shall we do to be saved and
[1:19:35] Peter says repent and be baptized in the
[1:19:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye
[1:19:42] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:44] the promise is unto you till your
[1:19:46] children those that are fought as many
[1:19:48] as the Lord our God shall come ten days
[1:19:50] after Jesus told him baptized in the
[1:19:53] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:19:54] people pick up their Bibles and they
[1:19:57] will tell you that Peter got it wrong I
[1:20:00] want to tell you that those scriptures
[1:20:02] do not contradict one another but those
[1:20:05] scriptures actually complete each other
[1:20:10] somebody you can get to your virtue
[1:20:16] because the Bible does not contradict
[1:20:19] itself what Matthew 28:19 said because
[1:20:27] Matthew 28:19 was titles name of the
[1:20:31] Father and conjunction where of the Son
[1:20:34] and of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:37] hallelujah and Peter says he understood
[1:20:39] by revelation what the name was the name
[1:20:43] of the Father the name in the New
[1:21:13] Testament it never changed the three
[1:21:15] different gods it was God just changing
[1:21:17] his offices I just love this I'm gonna
[1:21:22] just just just just give me just a
[1:21:23] minute or so but you know you know when
[1:21:26] I got share this with people you know I
[1:21:29] say you know it's like it's like me I in
[1:21:33] this church my mama's here that makes me
[1:21:35] a son right in this church I got
[1:21:38] children here that makes me a father huh
[1:21:42] right it makes me a father I'm a father
[1:21:44] I'm a son amen I'm a human I got a
[1:21:48] brother here I'm a brother hallelujah
[1:21:51] glory to God amen there's their sinks
[1:21:54] that I shepherd here I'm a pastor amen
[1:21:57] also just titles that I the one person
[1:22:02] where
[1:22:04] I'm the one person with all them titles
[1:22:07] and now you want to know how can I
[1:22:09] operate at all them titles easy let my
[1:22:12] mama be standing right here and let my
[1:22:14] daughter be standing right here and I
[1:22:16] can have a conversation with my mama and
[1:22:18] I act like a son standing right next to
[1:22:24] me is my daughter and when she chime in
[1:22:27] then I go to father mood all in the same
[1:22:30] conversation and I'm not talking to
[1:22:35] myself I just understand my role and
[1:22:42] then if somebody else woke up say
[1:22:44] brother Jack brother Jack now I become
[1:22:46] pastor the same guy talking and all the
[1:22:49] conversations just changing offices and
[1:22:53] that's exactly what God did understand
[1:22:59] you can get these days and find out that
[1:23:02] the scripture does not contradict then
[1:23:05] add that to your virtue
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:15] the revelation to the person when you
[1:23:20] can explain it yourself you add that and
[1:23:25] then me tell you something I'm gonna
[1:23:27] tell you how you got the ability to add
[1:23:28] it because God gave you and when it come
[1:23:46] down I'm at it oh my super ant
[1:23:50] oh Jesus come on Church hallelujah I
[1:23:54] love that so so acts 2:38 does not
[1:23:57] contradict Matthew 28:19 but it
[1:24:01] completes it see knowledge he said
[1:24:05] knowledge not worldly don't don't don't
[1:24:07] use worldly knowledge because worldly
[1:24:09] knowledge reasons he says any kind of
[1:24:12] worldly knowledge will reason says see
[1:24:16] but faith has no reasoning God reveals
[1:24:19] to you a certain certain thing going to
[1:24:21] happen every scientists in the world
[1:24:24] could say is contrary it could not
[1:24:26] happen do you believe in it how that's
[1:24:27] what Noah did right when God revealed to
[1:24:29] him that it was gonna rain even though
[1:24:31] people could prove now it has never
[1:24:32] rained never not one time have we have
[1:24:35] that was new language to them rain
[1:24:38] because at that time the earth had
[1:24:40] perfect irrigation and I mean in order
[1:24:44] to water you know the water the trees
[1:24:47] the water the plants they would get
[1:24:49] their water from underneath the earth
[1:24:50] they didn't even need rain it was
[1:24:52] perfect irrigation hallelujah so when no
[1:24:55] one comes along and says it's gonna rain
[1:24:56] now we look at that because we know what
[1:24:58] rain is nowadays but at that time that
[1:25:00] was completely against common syncing
[1:25:03] hallelujah glory to God it caused the
[1:25:06] people to stumble because they never
[1:25:08] seen nothing like this and this man is
[1:25:10] building a boat for people to get in and
[1:25:13] they say they say it's gonna rain come
[1:25:15] on Noah come on I mean be realistic but
[1:25:18] when God has revealed something to you
[1:25:20] you have to stand against everybody
[1:25:23] can I tell you something when God begins
[1:25:26] to reveal this word to you huh you can't
[1:25:30] help but see certain thing I mean there
[1:25:32] was a family recently that I heard about
[1:25:36] neighbor stealers they was they just
[1:25:38] come to the message and I placed our
[1:25:40] hearing some of these truths they were
[1:25:42] saying we can't see why people can't see
[1:25:46] this my dad has said the same thing
[1:25:48] I can't my dad would have argued
[1:25:50] argument after argument why can't you
[1:25:52] see what happened in the garden that it
[1:25:54] was not somebody eating the fruit why
[1:25:57] can't you see that and I'm gonna tell
[1:25:59] you something about this message
[1:26:00] y'all ever seen like a 3d picture they
[1:26:05] used to have these things you go inside
[1:26:07] doctors offices and all over the place
[1:26:08] they have a 3d peach depicting everybody
[1:26:10] just stem they gauge that in the picture
[1:26:12] and they'll tell you now inside the
[1:26:14] picture is this there's a certain object
[1:26:16] in the picture and what you have to do
[1:26:19] is sit there and stare at it and before
[1:26:21] you know it your eyes begin to focus and
[1:26:24] you can see behind you know everything
[1:26:27] that's just on the surface you see
[1:26:29] behind you can see what's in that
[1:26:30] picture and any I never had that
[1:26:33] experience before now I want to taste
[1:26:35] something once you see it
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:21] don't look at it keep listening to the
[1:27:25] tapes cuz you are paying to see glory to
[1:27:37] God the Prophet says not worldly
[1:27:39] knowledge because their reasons but we
[1:27:42] won't we won't say faith does not have
[1:27:44] any reason God reveals to you a certain
[1:27:46] thing that's going to happen and every
[1:27:48] scientist the world can say is contrary
[1:27:50] it could not happen but you believe it
[1:27:51] anyhow Noah believed it and it certainly
[1:27:53] rained just the way no if I prophesied
[1:27:55] that it would it another little
[1:27:58] statement that he made and I like this
[1:28:00] he says you know there's a difference
[1:28:02] and he was used in the scripture let me
[1:28:06] let me let me quote this scripture for
[1:28:08] you before I make this statement usual
[1:28:10] scripture Psalms 1 verse 1 through 3
[1:28:12] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:28:15] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[1:28:19] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:28:22] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[1:28:26] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[1:28:30] doth he meditate day and night that's
[1:28:32] what I think about I just think about
[1:28:34] the Word of God write and demand that's
[1:28:36] like that look at verse 3 and he shall
[1:28:39] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:28:43] the water
[1:28:43] now now the Prophet makes a statement
[1:28:45] here he says
[1:28:47] the difference in being planted all
[1:28:50] right he says being planted and being
[1:28:52] set out he says you know there's a
[1:28:55] difference of being planted and set out
[1:28:57] or stuck out right now now the scripture
[1:29:00] says he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:29:02] the rivers of water now I wanna I want
[1:29:04] to make a couple statements go back to
[1:29:06] that script to pull that back up for me
[1:29:07] that he bringeth forth his fruit in his
[1:29:09] season his leaf also shall not wither so
[1:29:13] when this man is planted by the river
[1:29:16] water amen his fruit will bring forth in
[1:29:19] the season a notice it's not his League
[1:29:21] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[1:29:23] shall prosper I love this if his leaf
[1:29:26] will not wither it means he'll never
[1:29:29] experience winter if its leaf won't
[1:29:36] wither he'll never go through seasons
[1:29:39] you understand I mean because fall is
[1:29:42] one season and winter is another season
[1:29:44] and spring and summer if this man's leaf
[1:29:47] won't wither he will always be blessed
[1:29:52] this is what I was saying now you know
[1:29:54] when we are you know yes we have trials
[1:29:57] but I think it's our attitude in the
[1:29:59] midst of the trial right because if your
[1:30:01] attitude don't shift if you realize that
[1:30:03] no matter what you're going through
[1:30:05] it falls into the category of Romans
[1:30:09] 8:28 you understand what I'm saying
[1:30:13] everything that you're facing your your
[1:30:15] your family issues your job issues how
[1:30:19] your school issues amen whatever it is
[1:30:22] that you're facing it falls into the
[1:30:25] category all you got to do is put it
[1:30:27] over there I'm turning that the Romans
[1:30:30] 8:28 oh this we can't Romans 8:28 Amen
[1:30:34] you got to be like job when they brought
[1:30:36] all that bad news to toe joke we refuse
[1:30:40] to curse God he always worshiped God but
[1:30:43] this happens open please God that
[1:30:45] happened please God that happened pray
[1:30:47] you praise God
[1:30:48] yes I do
[1:30:55] the purpose is working good but you get
[1:31:50] stronger through this I say this way
[1:31:56] Scott you grow in this somebody is in
[1:32:02] the Romans 8:28 bucket
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:09] Chloe Lagarde soon as soon as it come
[1:32:15] your way just take it in take it in
[1:32:20] throat over in the bucket god don't use

[1:32:32] use that somehow tests I'm only gonna
[1:32:34] come up I was in an accident and I lost

[1:32:37] God do you have your life God gonna turn
[1:32:41] it around get ready for a double-double
[1:32:47] put that thing in the Romans 8:28 bucket
[1:32:50] is this is this a thing is this a thing
[1:32:53] we're all things
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:33:01] and not some things all things so throw
[1:33:04] that thing over there see we we we try
[1:33:06] to we try to fix it ourselves don't
[1:33:08] worry about that give it to God and have
[1:33:11] knowledge that God gonna turn that thing
[1:33:13] around I don't know how he do it some
[1:33:15] way amen brother brother lost his car at
[1:33:19] a meeting the man's had a meeting
[1:33:21] worship Him praise to the Lord and goes
[1:33:25] back outside after the meeting in the
[1:33:27] car's gone go he said he went the
[1:33:30] brother branham say brother I don't you
[1:33:32] know we just got the brother and say
[1:33:33] let's pray they prayed and when they
[1:33:35] prayed Amen that the man that was
[1:33:37] driving the car away felt convicted in
[1:33:40] the car and turned around and brought
[1:33:42] the car back you know he only brought it
[1:33:44] back so far cuz he want to get caught
[1:33:46] but yeah he brought the car back look
[1:33:49] I'm telling you your God will make the
[1:33:51] devil bring it back you pray and commit
[1:33:57] that thing to the Lord but he'll bring
[1:33:59] it back they meant you won't lose
[1:34:02] nothing all right
[1:34:04] that so he made this comment you know
[1:34:07] there's a difference in being planning
[1:34:08] and being set out of stuck out right and
[1:34:12] I want to just kind of bring a scripture
[1:34:14] in on that sums 9 to 13 it's a
[1:34:16] difference in being planet than just
[1:34:18] being set out of stuck out now and I
[1:34:21] like to use another statement it's a
[1:34:23] difference in being planet rather than
[1:34:25] being potty
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] it's a difference when you plant it in a
[1:34:32] church or you just pot it at the church
[1:34:36] because when you pot it
[1:34:38] people just ports you anywhere y'all
[1:34:41] understand what I'm saying they can just
[1:34:43] pick you up and take you and put you
[1:34:44] anywhere winds will come and blow you
[1:34:50] all over the place right what about when
[1:34:52] you plant it no no it's gonna be a lot
[1:34:56] of work to get me out of this look at
[1:35:00] look at this and now your desert there
[1:35:01] not let me also tell you this much it's
[1:35:03] a blessing on you when you plant it
[1:35:08] there's a blessing psalm 92 13 there's a
[1:35:12] blessing when you're planted those that
[1:35:15] be planted in the house of the Lord
[1:35:19] shall flourish in the course of our God
[1:35:23] so if you want the blessings to flow you
[1:35:25] need to get planted I want to say it
[1:35:30] again if you want the blessings to flow
[1:35:33] you need to get plenty don't be part of
[1:35:37] get planted and when I say planting I

[1:38:38] praying and fast and seek car till he
[1:38:42] reveal his word to you look at it I want
[1:38:46] to read a little quote here cuz worldly

[1:38:53] virtue knowledge not worldly knowledge

[1:38:57] and some skills not we heard a message
[1:39:00] on that recently about fax you know you
[1:39:02] might have yeah that's a fact but God
[1:39:04] can go beyond your facts that's a fact
[1:39:08] it's a fact that I got this problem but
[1:39:11] yeah that's what the doctor said I got
[1:39:13] that but God can go beyond my facts and
[1:39:16] it can change my facts so I'm not
[1:39:20] limited to facts all right here's a
[1:39:23] little statement that I want to read in
[1:39:26] a sermon deceive Church by the world
[1:39:29] this this little statement says there is
[1:39:32] no need for any man to try to take his
[1:39:35] worldly knowledge and ever please God
[1:39:38] with him no need for you to try to take
[1:39:42] your worldly knowledge and ever please
[1:39:44] God with it look you say it's an
[1:39:45] abomination in the sight of God your
[1:39:48] worldly knowledge it's an abomination in
[1:39:50] the sight of God say you'll never please
[1:39:52] God with the worldly ambitions and
[1:39:54] knowledge because it's enmity to God
[1:39:57] says the scripture he cannot do it now
[1:40:01] it didn't say don't have ambition but if
[1:40:04] you try to use your ambition to please
[1:40:07] God then you're missing it right I mean
[1:40:10] it's it's not it's not the ambition and
[1:40:12] what you can
[1:40:13] chief in this world I'm gonna do this
[1:40:14] and this is how I'm gonna please God no
[1:40:16] that's not the way this works right amen
[1:40:18] he says now now and we will just read a
[1:40:21] quote of Scripture here just to kind of
[1:40:23] back that statement up don't try that
[1:40:25] don't try to please them with worldly
[1:40:26] knowledge amen because it's an enemy to
[1:40:30] God first corinthians 3:19 look at this
[1:40:32] for the wisdom of this world is
[1:40:36] foolishness with God think about that
[1:40:38] right you can't please God with wisdom
[1:40:41] of the world because it's foolishness to
[1:40:43] God for this rhythm he taketh the wise
[1:40:46] in their own craftiness so you can't use
[1:40:49] the wisdom of the world to try to be
[1:40:52] pleasing to God it's never gonna work no
[1:40:55] matter how much you accomplished in this
[1:40:57] world yes you got to live him yes you
[1:40:59] wanna you want to be successful while
[1:41:01] you're here but don't use that the thing
[1:41:03] that you can you can get some special
[1:41:05] place in God because you got things and
[1:41:07] when I was just reading recently in and
[1:41:09] in Ecclesiastes and Solomon saying you
[1:41:12] know he learned something that you know
[1:41:14] he can be wisest I don't know what he
[1:41:17] can be the wisest man on the earth and
[1:41:19] then you can have a fool right next to
[1:41:21] him that don't know nothing he said but
[1:41:23] at the end of both of our lives it's the
[1:41:25] same result so how much you accomplished
[1:41:31] but the bum on the street and next to
[1:41:33] you at the end of your life it's the
[1:41:35] same result both of you go six feet
[1:41:37] under sorry say all that stuff is vanity
[1:41:41] vanity of vanities huh so don't put your
[1:41:45] faith in those things put your faith in
[1:41:48] Christ
[1:41:48] now he'll supply your need and allow you
[1:41:50] to you know to achieve certain things
[1:41:52] here on earth but don't think that
[1:41:53] that's the thing that's gonna please go
[1:41:55] hey man
[1:41:56] amen because I got this certification

[1:42:07] patience and gods and so and so forth do

[1:53:31] to judge whether it's right or whether
[1:53:32] it's wrong we got to go forward now in
[1:53:34] the scripture because I'm drawing a
[1:53:37] menace war strategy from a man the
[1:53:39] scripture in in first and second
[1:53:41] chronicles 18 because this is where G
[1:53:44] hasta that comes on the scene hallelujah
[1:53:47] somebody she hasta that's a man is it's
[1:53:51] been asked by a have to come and go and
[1:53:55] reclaim remark Illya he says you know we
[1:53:58] you know this this land is ours and you
[1:54:01] know and
[1:54:02] and you know they got it they're keeping
[1:54:04] it from us and we ready to go to war and
[1:54:07] we want to go get ramoth-gilead and they
[1:54:09] say will you come go with me
[1:54:11] jehosophat eight habits asking for a man
[1:54:15] of jehosophat's participation in this
[1:54:17] battle stay with me here today
[1:54:19] hallelujah amen so hear hear arch the
[1:54:22] Asura says okay we'll go and you know
[1:54:25] that as as as they're about to go let's
[1:54:27] look at something here in the scripture
[1:54:29] I'll turn with me the second corrupt
[1:54:30] second chronicles 18 let's just look at
[1:54:33] this real quick just to make sure you're
[1:54:35] with me glory glory glory verse 3 second
[1:54:40] chronicles 18 verse 3 and it says an a
[1:54:43] half king of israel said unto joseph at
[1:54:46] king of judah wilt thou go with me
[1:54:49] to ramoth-gilead and he answered him I
[1:54:53] am as thou art and my people ask thy
[1:54:57] people and we will be with thee in the
[1:55:00] war when we got to get a war strategy
[1:55:03] now we're getting ready to go to war but
[1:55:04] we need a war strategy amen and josaphat
[1:55:08] said unto the king of Israel in quite
[1:55:11] night he's already made the agreement
[1:55:13] this is why amen
[1:55:15] before you make an agreement make sure
[1:55:18] you've already prayed about it and you
[1:55:20] got the word
[1:55:21] you got the Word of God on it before you
[1:55:24] make the agreement because if you make
[1:55:26] the agreement before you get God's
[1:55:27] thought on it you're tied to that
[1:55:29] agreement Oh hallelujah Jehoshaphat had
[1:55:34] already made the agreement and then he
[1:55:37] asked him first for and Johnson said him
[1:55:39] that the king of Israel enquire I pray
[1:55:42] thee at the word of the Lord today now
[1:55:45] now I'm looking at this from two
[1:55:46] different angles
[1:55:47] he wants a prophecy but there's another
[1:55:51] thing that the Prophet tells us about
[1:55:52] Joseph at Jehoshaphat knew that a
[1:55:56] prophecy had already been given a mentor
[1:56:01] the heat that the doors was gonna lick
[1:56:03] his blood and what jehosophat wanted to
[1:56:06] know is this the battle
[1:56:10] she had knowledge that that promise was
[1:56:14] out there waiting to be fulfilled and he
[1:56:17] needs to know is this the battle that
[1:56:20] God's gonna bring that to pass because I
[1:56:23] know what the property law just said
[1:56:25] about you knowledge of that he knew that
[1:56:31] something bad was gonna happen so and
[1:56:33] cry out the Lord now I love to come to
[1:56:36] where I'm looking at this not just a
[1:56:38] prophecy but I want you to go back and
[1:56:40] look at what Elijah said is this a time
[1:56:44] jobs or is this a time for that
[1:56:47] it's just is this the season for that
[1:56:49] because I know it's coming so here
[1:56:51] Jehoshaphat verse 5 he caught I mean
[1:56:54] verse 4 he says that therefore the king
[1:56:56] of Israel gathered amen
[1:57:00] the king of Reaser gathered together
[1:57:01] prop a Prophet's four hundred men and
[1:57:04] said unto them shall we go to
[1:57:07] ramoth-gilead to battle shell out shall
[1:57:09] I forbear and they said go up for God
[1:57:12] will deliver it into the Kings hand now
[1:57:15] I need to just kind of stop there we
[1:57:16] need to bring this thing a little closer
[1:57:18] to home you know because we you know
[1:57:20] we'll get to the rest of the story but
[1:57:22] you know you can go to Google you can go
[1:57:26] to other churches you can go to all kind
[1:57:29] of people now tell you something this
[1:57:31] ain't right this dis message that they
[1:57:32] follow anything right now you might have
[1:57:34] one person telling you it is and 400
[1:57:39] telling you it's wrong to judge right
[1:57:46] from wrong right do you have God's
[1:57:54] knowledge where you can judge right from
[1:57:56] wrong because a lot of folk might be
[1:57:58] telling you better get out of it that's
[1:57:59] a cult they alive this is a reveal word
[1:58:04] for the hour
[1:58:06] and I tell you I'm planet I'm planted in
[1:58:09] this I mean I thought I was potted in my
[1:58:12] denominational churches but I found
[1:58:14] something to get planted in let me let
[1:58:19] me just tell you I mean you gotta have
[1:58:21] to kind of look at these things don't
[1:58:23] just you leave it back in Bible history
[1:58:25] look at it today you might be here for
[1:58:28] 500 people telling you it's wrong one
[1:58:31] person saying it's right which one
[1:58:33] you're gonna stand with now cuz here in
[1:58:36] the scripture four hundred men come up
[1:58:38] before the prophet and let me come up
[1:58:40] before the kings and say go up go up go
[1:58:42] up go up God is with you 400 400 now let
[1:58:47] me tell you if you have 400 people
[1:58:48] telling you to do something you probably
[1:58:50] just take off doing it but look at what
[1:58:53] Jehoshaphat does after 400 prophecies
[1:58:57] 400 look at this of next verse he says
[1:59:01] such a high surf I said is there not
[1:59:04] here a prophet of the Lord
[1:59:09] besides that we might inquire of him say
[1:59:14] no no no no I just heard all 400 but
[1:59:16] here's the problem John spent all 400
[1:59:18] 400 men said the exact same thing
[1:59:20] there's got to be a problem with that if
[1:59:22] further other people pronounce and
[1:59:24] blessings over you something wrong
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:28] something wrong if you go to church
[1:59:31] every time they always get a a you know
[1:59:33] every time you go somewhere to preface
[1:59:34] on something good they've never said
[1:59:36] none bad all the same that's in your
[1:59:38] life and ain't no matter said nothing
[1:59:41] bad nobody and ain't nobody said nothing
[1:59:57] they even John Smith said something
[1:59:59] wrong with this 400 of your profits I'm
[2:00:03] good so no don't just take off with any
[2:00:06] prophecy cuz every prophecy is nothing
[2:00:11] gone I'm sorry at least one more
[2:00:25] you know I improvise here but then here
[2:00:28] comes the king saying I'm Emma I gave
[2:00:30] you four hundred I gave you four hundred
[2:00:33] he said I know but is it at least one
[2:00:35] more Oh hallelujah and then he said yes
[2:00:38] one more
[2:00:39] he said yeah he'd say well where is he a
[2:00:42] success name is much higher you can take
[2:00:44] it down his name is Maya
[2:00:57] every time I go to that church he shakes
[2:01:12] out on one of the prophets I said don't
[2:01:13] let the King say say go go go get him
[2:01:15] and go get him anyway
[2:01:16] so here could they go and get Micaiah
[2:01:19] before they go to battle and macaé
[2:01:22] is told he's informed and advised
[2:01:25] therefore he goes they say somebody's
[2:01:28] saying ìlook we just went down there the
[2:01:30] stand before him all four hundred or
[2:01:32] said the same thing when you say the
[2:01:34] same thing we said and you get your meal
[2:01:37] paid you get your bills paid you get
[2:01:41] that car that you've been wanting that
[2:01:42] house that you want you you go you're
[2:01:44] gonna get it if you just go along with
[2:01:46] everybody else say let me take some
[2:01:49] online profits out there they're getting
[2:01:51] their bills paid by the church
[2:01:56] in a day charge you for the prophecy you
[2:01:58] know I get it and come from God God
[2:02:01] don't charge for this hallelujah hear
[2:02:06] hear he say you say I'm only gonna say
[2:02:08] what God telling me to say I don't care
[2:02:10] what money off said I'm gonna say what
[2:02:11] God told me to say so mkhaya comes up
[2:02:15] and Yap say tell us what the word of the
[2:02:19] Lord is we want to go to ramoth-gilead
[2:02:20] and and conquer you know it's gonna be
[2:02:24] with us uh should we forbear so Micaiah
[2:02:26] says go on up the Lord is with you
[2:02:29] well you know what the sad part about
[2:02:32] this is that AI being an unbeliever you
[2:02:35] that that was not thus saith the Lord
[2:02:38] you know why because this man has a
[2:02:40] reputation for speaking the truth and
[2:02:43] this man always comes against me so if
[2:02:46] he cut if he had come against me this
[2:02:47] time something wrong with that so I am
[2:02:49] say I assure you only tell me what that
[2:02:52] says the Lord is it say I saw Israel
[2:02:57] scattered they used a statement it says
[2:03:01] he is real scattered upon the mountains
[2:03:03] as sheep that have no shepherd he say
[2:03:07] didn't I tell you
[2:03:09] Jehoshaphat didn't I tell you that he
[2:03:12] was gonna prophesy evil there it is
[2:03:15] somebody yeah they got mad and upset
[2:03:19] with Micaiah
[2:03:20] you told me to tell you what the Lord
[2:03:22] said I see Israel scatters Sheik now
[2:03:24] this was actually fulfilling what
[2:03:27] Jehoshaphat was looking for he wanted to
[2:03:30] know whether that prophecy that Eli just
[2:03:34] said was about to come to pass
[2:03:36] now Jehoshaphat knew that this was a
[2:03:38] battle but the problem is he had already
[2:03:41] agreed that's why before you agreed
[2:03:46] you got to pray over that thing he had
[2:03:50] already agreed so he couldn't go back on
[2:03:52] his word he had to go on with the battle
[2:03:54] no sir I have said I told you Joseph
[2:03:57] that he was gonna say this four hundred
[2:03:59] to one
[2:04:02] four hundred opinions to one
[2:04:06] which one you gonna stand with here here
[2:04:13] Makai is so convinced he heard a half
[2:04:18] say you know throw this guy in prison
[2:04:21] I'll deal with him when I get back he
[2:04:22] said if you come back this panel I see
[2:04:37] him stand up like sheep now now I want
[2:04:40] you to understand this that was a
[2:04:43] prophecy over Israel not Judah
[2:04:49] Jehoshaphat was king of Judah so good
[2:04:53] Josaphat had a promise that nothing was
[2:04:56] gonna happen to him in this battle even
[2:04:58] though he shouldn't have been there oh
[2:05:03] yeah yeah he had some protection that
[2:05:09] promise that was over him was his
[2:05:10] protection now now now the other thing
[2:05:13] about this that's very good because
[2:05:15] Micaiah as they were trying to deal with
[2:05:18] him you know he doesn't only say I see
[2:05:19] Israel scatter like sheep and he say I'm
[2:05:21] gonna tell you how I saw this Oh glory
[2:05:24] to God brother brother brother whisper
[2:05:26] hit it last week
[2:05:27] he told us that there sometime God had
[2:05:29] to create vessels of Wrath and he said
[2:05:33] the reason that God had to create
[2:05:35] vessels of Wrath because it needs a
[2:05:36] dirty man for a dirty job
[2:05:42] I think God I'm not a vessel of Wrath
[2:05:46] but I'm a vessel of mercy so he needed a
[2:05:52] dirty man for a dirty job then brother
[2:05:54] whisperer took us right to the scripture
[2:05:56] because in this scripture what happened
[2:05:59] is that you know God had a a council
[2:06:02] meeting in heaven GOG I got invited all
[2:06:05] the Angels say now we got a prophecy
[2:06:07] over 1/2 he's saying now how are we
[2:06:10] gonna get this thing
[2:06:11] the dogs are supposed to lick his blood
[2:06:13] because of
[2:06:52] this very capable hale into the meeting
[2:06:56] where God was a symbol but it was
[2:06:59] created for this purpose and the spirit
[2:07:01] come oh my god the spirit come up and
[2:07:04] say the spirit come up say Lord I got an
[2:07:06] idea I want to taste something unclean
[2:07:19] spirits so when you see unclean stuff
[2:07:29] happening your life it's unclean spirit
[2:07:30] that came from hell
[2:07:33] this spirit come up say I got a knife
[2:07:35] they say what job did he say you know
[2:07:37] I'll be Alliance period and I would get
[2:07:39] in the mouth of all his prophets and I
[2:07:42] would cause him to believe a lie not
[2:07:45] only believe a lie but you know what God
[2:07:52] say that's a great idea
[2:07:55] they say you know what you are you
[2:07:58] actually gonna you're gonna accomplish
[2:07:59] the task now this was something that
[2:08:02] surprised God this was a vessel of Wrath
[2:08:04] that was created for this purpose he had
[2:08:07] that type of mindset I do evil things
[2:08:10] God they say these righteous angels will
[2:08:16] never get the job done but you demon I
[2:08:20] was just talking to somebody I think
[2:08:22] wins that's I say you know sometimes you
[2:08:24] can be anointed you can get an anointing
[2:08:26] from from from the enemy they say oh
[2:08:28] don't use the word anointing that's so
[2:08:30] strong no no no no no no no no no no no
[2:08:32] no you can get an anointing from the
[2:08:34] devil yes you can you can get an
[2:08:38] anointed this grip to prove that that
[2:08:40] anointing came from hell it didn't come
[2:08:45] from God it came from the hell here God
[2:08:48] said go ahead yeah you're gonna get this
[2:08:50] thing accomplished and that spirit
[2:08:52] jumped on four hundred and men and calls
[2:08:55] all four hundred to prophesy how you
[2:08:57] know a spirit didn't come from Hell to
[2:09:00] get on the person that wrote the Google
[2:09:02] site that you're looking at
[2:09:06] i'ma tell you how you can know whether
[2:09:08] it came from hell or whether it came
[2:09:11] from God the only way you can tell is
[2:09:14] that you have to be able to examine by
[2:09:17] this if you not reading this you don't
[2:09:21] know if it's right or wrong you got to
[2:09:27] know the scripture for yourself man and
[2:09:32] we're gonna be on John 3:16 even in that
[2:09:37] people looking at it wrong they think
[2:09:39] God sent his son no God became his son
[2:09:45] [Music]
[2:09:49] but the Spirit from Hell comes out I'll
[2:09:51] do this I'm gonna and got into 400
[2:09:54] prophets and cousin believed a lot and
[2:09:56] went went went when my tire revealed
[2:09:58] what had happened nobody else came with
[2:10:01] that type of prophecy nobody said nothin
[2:10:04] like that but but kaya actually revealed
[2:10:06] now you know mike is actually living
[2:10:08] during the days of great prophecy large
[2:10:10] and Elijah he's still living during that
[2:10:12] time God was using another man just
[2:10:14] trying to get something hallelujah glory
[2:10:17] to God buddy here here macaé son see me
[2:10:20] tell them say he say he say he'd say
[2:10:22] this is what happened so when the guys
[2:10:23] got mad he was the head prophet the head
[2:10:28] he he got mad got up and walked not and
[2:10:30] he said not just finished prophecy
[2:10:40] and I promise I'll and it says something
[2:10:43] is shoveling and go up and glory to God
[2:10:46] he heard my tire say this about an
[2:10:48] anointing that came from hell and you
[2:10:51] want to know how we know it came from
[2:10:52] hell because this head prophet walked up
[2:10:56] to Micaiah until you go to a church were
[2:11:06] they ready to fight after they just
[2:11:07] finished preaching something wrong with
[2:11:09] that church they just finished speaking
[2:11:13] in tongues they ready to cursed yeah I
[2:11:15] actually Bible said you bless and curse
[2:11:17] out of the same mouth hello somebody
[2:11:23] encourage them that ought to be a sign
[2:11:26] quick sign get out of here
[2:11:33] unclean spirits think of unclean things
[2:11:38] this plan was inspired an anoint all 400
[2:11:41] prophets to lie this was a vessel wrath
[2:11:44] that was created now I want to just read
[2:11:48] a scripture here this is gonna be out of
[2:11:55] second critical second chronicles 18
[2:11:57] don't pull it up yet just give me verse
[2:11:59] 31 second chronicles 1831 to try to
[2:12:04] bring this to a close this war strategy
[2:12:06] so you have to you got to go back in and
[2:12:09] look at things you know you got to know
[2:12:10] what the Word of God says right and this
[2:12:13] is where this knowledge kind of comes in
[2:12:17] the King here Jehoshaphat knew that
[2:12:20] there was a prophecy that was supposed
[2:12:23] to take place and he's just he's looking
[2:12:25] at this thing he's looking at it and
[2:12:27] said but you know you got to be able to
[2:12:28] judge right from wrong so before he the
[2:12:30] he made an agreement so he had to stay
[2:12:32] with the agreement he had to stay with
[2:12:34] it but before he did that he shouldn't
[2:12:36] he should have consulted God but he knew
[2:12:39] that there was a prophecy that was over
[2:12:40] a half that he was gonna die in the and
[2:12:43] and the dogs were gonna lick lick his
[2:12:45] blood just like they lick name box but
[2:12:46] he knew that
[2:12:47] prophets today that's why he asked for
[2:12:49] these prophet these prophets that come
[2:12:51] forth
[2:12:52] he made the commitment to go he goes out
[2:12:55] to battle the prophecy of Micaiah says
[2:13:01] Israel is scattered but it didn't say
[2:13:04] Jew to us so he has some protection even
[2:13:08] though he shouldn't even be in the
[2:13:09] battle but here Jehoshaphat goes out and
[2:13:11] they come up with a scheme and they tell
[2:13:15] cuz you know I can imagine maybe Joseph
[2:13:17] I said Oh Lord I shouldn't never greet
[2:13:19] to this Oh God Oh ain't have you done
[2:13:23] tricked me again and and I don't gave my
[2:13:25] word and they putting the pressure on
[2:13:26] and you don't gave your word man you
[2:13:27] know you got didn't you kept okay Kings
[2:13:29] word is its bond they putting the
[2:13:32] pressure on him he said oh I shouldn't
[2:13:33] do it
[2:13:34] so eight have come up with a scheme what
[2:13:36] we gonna do when we go to battle you
[2:13:38] gonna dress up in your kingly role and
[2:13:40] I'm gonna just act like a warrior and
[2:13:44] we're gonna go to bali say okay let's
[2:13:46] let's do that problem was the other army
[2:13:50] they strategy was that we only gonna
[2:13:54] attack the king let everybody else along
[2:13:58] guess who's dressed up like a king
[2:14:02] jehoshaphat so everybody turns their
[2:14:06] weapons on the hospital s read 2nd
[2:14:10] chronicles 18 and verse 31 and it came
[2:14:14] to pass when the captains of the
[2:14:18] chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said
[2:14:21] it is the king of Israel therefore they
[2:14:24] can pass about him to fight but the Haas
[2:14:27] effect cried out and the Lord helped him
[2:14:29] and God move them to depart from him oh
[2:14:32] I love that here he was dressed like a
[2:14:36] king and their strategy is go only after
[2:14:40] the king but they think he's the king of
[2:14:42] Israel but now the prophecy is to Israel
[2:14:45] not to Judah even though he dressed like
[2:14:47] a king the only thing he can do is cry
[2:14:49] out and God heard him
[2:14:52] remember Abijah cried
[2:14:54] out and God heard him and I love this
[2:14:57] because here in this scripture
[2:14:59] Jehoshaphat is surrounded and it's
[2:15:07] something about when you're surrounded
[2:15:08] all you gotta learn to do is cry out
[2:15:11] when you surround about this problem and
[2:15:14] surrounded by fat bum learn just cry out
[2:15:20] and your God comes on the scene and I
[2:15:24] can imagine Jehoshaphat but I'm
[2:15:32] surrounded by you I'm sorry that's
[2:15:36] happening you have but I knew this
[2:15:37] prophecy was coming to pass at some
[2:15:39] point in time I'm just glad to get out
[2:15:41] of here with my life because I shouldn't
[2:15:44] have been tied to you in the first place
[2:15:45] my Kyah told us you were gonna pass we
[2:15:49] asked for the word look they have if you
[2:15:52] would have asked for the Word of God
[2:15:53] first you might not have even been in
[2:15:56] this situation he had knowledge that
[2:16:04] what God has spoke was gonna come to
[2:16:06] pass
[2:16:07] she shouldn't have been there but I know
[2:16:10] I thank God that even when we in places
[2:16:13] that we not supposed to be he's right
[2:16:18] there
[2:16:20] he's right that it delivers he's right
[2:16:23] there to set us free and that don't mean
[2:16:27] go out here and get in some situation I
[2:16:29] want to see how God gonna work this side
[2:16:33] hey HAP didn't come back it won't work
[2:16:37] that for you half the prophecy was
[2:16:39] against Israel but Judah was spared
[2:16:41] oh my war strategies knowledge knowledge
[2:16:51] let me just read a closing quote oh this
[2:17:04] Colton quote is actually going into
[2:17:06] another a hab later on in his life after
[2:17:09] a I'm sorry
[2:17:11] Jehoshaphat later in his life acts were
[2:17:14] the same thing just getting ready to go
[2:17:17] to battle and this time I was a half son
[2:17:19] that one to him I think his name was
[2:17:20] John Joe Ram want him to come about he's
[2:17:22] like can we inquire of the Lord because
[2:17:25] what happened they got these three kings
[2:17:27] together had the king of Edom I believe
[2:17:29] king of Israel and king of oh yeah oh my
[2:17:35] I gotta see this they had these three
[2:17:37] kings the king of Judah King of Israel
[2:17:40] and king of Edom and they were getting
[2:17:46] ready to go in the battle and they
[2:17:47] wanted to know which way to go but as
[2:17:48] they were going into battle they start
[2:17:50] looking out for some of the animals and
[2:17:52] realized there was no water anywhere
[2:17:53] around for these animals like look we
[2:17:55] got a we're in trouble here we can't get
[2:17:57] what if ourselves we can't get water for
[2:17:59] the animals so we're gonna be in trouble
[2:18:00] so they're Josaphat again righteous man
[2:18:03] is their prophet anywhere around that we
[2:18:06] can consult they say yeah Elijah's
[2:18:09] around and when Elisha they went the
[2:18:12] Elijah's house deal I should say I
[2:18:13] wouldn't even come out to see y'all if
[2:18:17] Jehoshaphat wasn't here they say that
[2:18:22] before I prophesy I need music
[2:18:26] I need anointed music now now so so for
[2:18:37] this particular service everybody had to
[2:18:39] play and you had to play anoint it right
[2:18:45] it just can be everybody just doing
[2:18:47] whatever and need to be anointed
[2:18:49] otherwise otherwise that create
[2:18:52] frustration amen so I can me I create a
[2:18:58] communication system to keep us all
[2:19:00] anointed and we gotta use it to keep
[2:19:05] everybody anointed right otherwise if it
[2:19:09] becomes not anointed it becomes
[2:19:11] confusion so we got to use what we got
[2:19:16] hello somebody praise the Lord
[2:19:19] but he said he said I came even prophesy
[2:19:22] until I have anointed ministers
[2:19:26] minstrels so here he called the
[2:19:29] minstrels now notice minstrels not
[2:19:32] minstrel they saying about one person
[2:19:34] this everybody hello everybody got to be
[2:19:38] involved so but we all got to be on the
[2:19:41] same note doing everything together
[2:19:44] so here here here he said he said you
[2:19:46] say it's a get middle northern minstrels
[2:19:48] and then our prophesied then I can
[2:19:52] preach then he comes up and they say he
[2:19:57] say okay after Dayton lay down a good
[2:19:59] song and everything then he and you know
[2:20:01] oh my an anointing come down from the
[2:20:04] music and he gets into the spirit and
[2:20:07] just begin to prophesy and he told them
[2:20:09] that they was going to overcome in the
[2:20:10] battle he said but you know Oh Lord
[2:20:14] Jesus
[2:20:14] I want to read this quote I want to read
[2:20:17] this quote get me the hand of the Lord
[2:20:24] came upon him before I read that quote
[2:20:26] just a little statement that the Lord
[2:20:28] gave me that I want to share with you
[2:20:29] when a tab was in battle and he
[2:20:32] disguised himself the Lord told me to
[2:20:35] tell you your costume King stop the
[2:20:38] prophecy
[2:20:42] your custom can't stop it your
[2:20:46] personality changing when you get
[2:20:50] amongst other people can't stop the
[2:20:52] prophecy yo your new behavior it can't
[2:21:00] stop the prophecy God called you to be
[2:21:03] something you're gonna be just that I
[2:21:05] don't care how much of a chameleon you
[2:21:07] become you can't stop God's prophecy
[2:21:14] this is out of the message to handle
[2:21:16] Lord came upon him notice then when
[2:21:20] their supply was cut off they began to
[2:21:22] find out if there wasn't something could
[2:21:25] be done because Jehoshaphat said isn't
[2:21:28] there a prophet of the Lord surely all
[2:21:30] this bunch of church people around here
[2:21:32] there should be a prophet somewhere that
[2:21:34] we can find out what the will of Lord is
[2:21:37] concerned indistinct says now it says
[2:21:42] now they knew the law this is important
[2:21:46] they knew the law they knew the
[2:21:48] commandments they had all the written
[2:21:51] word but they had to have something very
[2:21:54] very for this specific case and brother
[2:21:58] Branham talked about here the product
[2:21:59] here that these two kings these three
[2:22:00] kings are gathered together getting
[2:22:02] ready to go into battle and they've run
[2:22:04] into some trouble right and so now they
[2:22:06] had the law they had the commandments
[2:22:08] they had the written word but they had
[2:22:11] to have something for this specific case
[2:22:15] hallelujah says I hope you're getting
[2:22:17] this something now for this case now we
[2:22:20] got all these churches got all these
[2:22:23] denominations they got the same Bibles
[2:22:25] that we got but we got all kind of
[2:22:26] problems and we need something specific
[2:22:29] for this case if we want to understand
[2:22:33] the Word of God we're gonna need
[2:22:35] something specific for this case and I
[2:22:38] want to tell you what the specific thing
[2:22:39] that God gave me for this case he's
[2:22:41] saying you a prophet the whole I seen
[2:22:45] you Elijah the Prophet before the great
[2:22:50] and terrible day of the Lord and he
[2:22:52] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:22:54] the faith of the fathers God gave you
[2:22:56] something specific for this case that's
[2:23:01] the way in the meat and sometimes say
[2:23:03] well why don't you just pray for the
[2:23:04] people sometimes you notice it means it
[2:23:07] has to be something the whole picture is
[2:23:08] divine healing salvation but sometimes
[2:23:10] there's something in a fellow and a
[2:23:12] fellows way that keeps him from getting
[2:23:14] healed you hear it right here on the
[2:23:17] platform something they done somewhere
[2:23:19] else and something they've got to make
[2:23:20] right they have to do that before the
[2:23:23] blessing of God can come on them
[2:23:24] certainly not you can't do that you'll
[2:23:27] never so before you get all the
[2:23:28] blessings got you got some things you
[2:23:30] need to take care of that's what he's
[2:23:32] telling us Church I tell you with this
[2:23:34] war strategies go back and find out what
[2:23:36] the Word of God say and stay with that
[2:23:38] hold on to it you got the judge whether
[2:23:40] it's right or wrong and the way you
[2:23:41] judge whether it's right or wrong you
[2:23:42] judge it by the word god bless you god
[2:23:46] bless you
[2:23:47] [Applause]

[2:24:36] to the enemy Lord we just trusts as we
[2:24:40] just look at these various characters in
[2:24:43] in Scripture God that we would just be
[2:24:47] able to draw from their experiences and
[2:24:48] be able to apply the things that they
[2:24:51] went through Lord to the things that
[2:24:52] we're going through and we know father
[2:24:53] the same way that you provided and you
[2:24:55] made a way for Lord Jehoshaphat you'll
[2:25:00] make a way for us he looked back at the
[2:25:02] word he knew that something was supposed
[2:25:04] to be happened and he knew it
