[1:59] and fashioned as a man he humbled
[2:02] himself
[2:02] and became obedient unto death

[43:23] amen the lord is so good
[43:27] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[43:31] we want to just speak on a topic
[43:35] called easter the conservation of life
[43:40] amen easter is the conservation
[43:44] of our life and we want to find out
[43:47] we want to read how there's been so many
[43:50] easter eggs in the bible the bible is
[43:52] full of easter
[43:53] of course cavalry is the if we say after
[43:56] cavalry it was the most significant of
[43:58] all the easters
[44:00] but there's there's been more easters
[44:02] amen we want to go to the book of
[44:03] genesis which our prophet said genesis
[44:06] the seed
[44:08] sits chapter or the seed word
[44:11] of the bible amen whatever you see here
[44:14] on earth you can trace it back to
[44:15] genesis
[44:16] whatever is going on or whatever go go
[44:19] on
[44:19] you can find it right in the book of
[44:21] genesis so you want to see how
[44:23] easter started in the book of genesis
[44:26] then if you can the lord will help us we
[44:28] trace it through and see what easter
[44:30] we are going through right now amen
[44:33] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[44:34] take the book of genesis chapter one
[44:36] and let's read from one to five
[44:39] genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to 5.
[44:47] in the beginning god created the heaven
[44:49] and the earth
[44:51] so that is talking about celestia and
[44:52] earthly creation
[44:54] verse 2 and the earth was without form
[44:58] and void and darkness was upon the face
[45:00] of the deep
[45:01] and the spirit of god move upon the face
[45:04] of the waters
[45:05] now let's look at verse two and the
[45:07] earth was without form
[45:09] anything that doesn't go to form is what
[45:11] dead
[45:12] amen it doesn't speak it doesn't
[45:15] manifest any form
[45:16] life form if you put it in a simple term
[45:19] it didn't have any life form
[45:21] so it was dead and darkness was upon the
[45:24] face of the deep
[45:25] where darkness rains death rings
[45:30] but the spirit of the lord moved upon
[45:31] the face of the waters what are the
[45:33] waters
[45:34] the seed of god where's brother troy in
[45:37] the mind of god but are smiling
[45:38] they taught us the seed of god brother
[45:40] choice uh was it yesterday he said we
[45:42] should look
[45:43] beyond what his eyes the five senses
[45:45] will tell us let's go to the sixth sense
[45:48] let's go to the eternal sense that sense
[45:51] of eternity
[45:52] the sense of jesus christ the eyes of
[45:54] the lord
[45:55] and we can see past circumstances amen
[45:58] so god had some waters which is the seed
[46:01] you and i waters represent
[46:02] multitude of people in the scriptures so
[46:05] the god look upon the people that he
[46:07] wanted to plant he look upon you
[46:09] that someday you'll be born right here
[46:11] in west palm beach
[46:12] somewhere in the u.s somewhere in africa
[46:14] wherever you were born
[46:16] south america and be pleased right here
[46:18] amen
[46:19] so the lord was looking up to that
[46:21] yesterday was nothing
[46:22] on the face of the earth and verse three
[46:26] god said let there be light and there
[46:28] was light
[46:29] and god saw the light that it was good
[46:31] and god divided the light
[46:32] from the darkness that was separation
[46:35] verse five and god called it the light
[46:37] day and the darkness called night and
[46:40] the evening and the morning
[46:41] where they first day god bless you you
[46:43] may take your seed
[46:46] so that was the first easter
[46:50] that god had in the bible
[46:54] easter simply means you can break it
[46:57] into pieces
[46:58] death barrier and resurrection
[47:01] constitute easter amen
[47:04] if you go to the greek where they have
[47:06] different words terminologies they call
[47:08] easter
[47:09] spanish people call it pasqua that is
[47:12] death barrier and resurrection
[47:14] and of course we know that easter if you
[47:16] want to move from genesis to
[47:18] the time of jesus his main purpose was
[47:21] to come and celebrate easter
[47:23] working of easter to die to resurrect
[47:26] and to sorry to die to be buried and to
[47:29] resurrect
[47:31] so that he can show that the life that
[47:33] was in him
[47:34] was conserved life cannot be destroyed
[47:38] amen glory to god hallelujah
[47:49] praise god hallelujah now let's go to a
[47:51] science has got the law
[47:53] we want to break certain things down
[47:55] science has got a law
[47:57] which we call the law of conservation of
[47:59] energy
[48:00] and the same law is used in
[48:02] thermodynamics the first law of
[48:04] thermodynamics states that
[48:08] energy cannot be destroyed
[48:11] nor created but it can be transformed
[48:14] from one form to another
[48:17] energy cannot be destroyed nor created
[48:21] but it could be transformed from one
[48:22] form to another if you go to
[48:24] the laws of nature they call it mata
[48:27] cannot be destroyed in other in other
[48:30] words as a human being
[48:31] you can crash this computer you can
[48:34] break
[48:35] ice you can turn water from the liquid
[48:38] form to solid form
[48:39] you can even heat it till it vaporizes
[48:42] goes into the gaseous form
[48:44] but you haven't destroyed it all that
[48:46] you've done is you have transferred or
[48:48] transformed it from one form
[48:50] of life to another form of life amen
[48:53] glory hallelujah
[48:55] and that is what easter is all about
[48:57] changing the life form
[48:58] from one form to another for a perfect
[49:01] expression
[49:02] glory hallelujah and then the second
[49:05] law of uh thermodynamics just alludes to
[49:09] the first one that
[49:10] is all about conservation of uh energy
[49:13] that energy can be transformed they use
[49:15] it from heat energy
[49:17] uh kinetic energy potential energy let's
[49:20] say for example potential energy is
[49:22] energy a body process by virtue of his
[49:25] height
[49:26] so this this mouse has got a potential
[49:29] energy
[49:30] it's static it's not moving but when i
[49:32] drop it it begins to pick motion
[49:35] so it changes from potential to a
[49:37] kinetic energy
[49:39] and then when it drops on the floor it
[49:41] dissipates it could
[49:42] change into different forms of energy
[49:44] mechanical energy
[49:46] it could be harnessed into doing
[49:47] something it could change to different
[49:49] forms of energy
[49:50] it can splash into pieces yes you have
[49:52] not destroyed it
[49:53] it's just changed from one form to
[49:54] another amen
[49:56] so the life form in you nothing can
[49:59] destroy that life in you
[50:02] no death no sickness no coronavirus
[50:06] no nothing can destroy the life of jesus
[50:08] christ in you
[50:10] amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[50:12] blessed be the name of the lord
[50:14] so we want to just establish the basis
[50:16] of how
[50:18] the energy or the life form that brother
[50:21] troy
[50:21] taught us yesterday that was in the mind
[50:24] of christ
[50:25] before the foundation of the world that
[50:26] life is you
[50:28] and that life is just changing from one
[50:30] form to another
[50:31] now before you came on this earth before
[50:34] you were conceived in your mother's womb
[50:35] before you became a life-form in your
[50:37] father's loin
[50:38] you were somewhere amen you want to
[50:41] look at adam and us how the life form is
[50:44] transfer
[50:44] transformed from one form to another now
[50:47] let's look at adam
[50:48] when adam was created adam came in a
[50:51] different form
[50:53] we know adam didn't drink breast milk he
[50:56] didn't drink any formula
[50:57] he didn't come as a baby he didn't come
[50:59] as a toddler
[51:01] he came as a full grown man around let's
[51:04] say 25 to
[51:05] 30 years of age roughly 30 years of age
[51:08] because the first adam and the second
[51:10] adam were just the same thing but
[51:12] different manifestation
[51:13] the first adam the second adam started
[51:15] his ministry at the age of 30 jesus
[51:16] christ
[51:17] so that was where the first adam started
[51:20] amen when he was here on earth so he was
[51:22] a full grown man around 30 years of age
[51:25] now the difference between adam and you
[51:28] is that
[51:29] adam came as a spirit
[51:33] and then he's put the life he's put the
[51:35] existing element
[51:37] but a troy onto his flesh
[51:40] as we are here they are spread around
[51:42] jesus christ is here
[51:44] how many have got the holy ghost what is
[51:47] the holy ghost
[51:48] jesus is a spirit it's a life
[51:52] it's a literal life of almighty yes you
[51:55] can see with his eyes
[51:56] and that life is here but then that life
[51:59] is being templed
[52:00] or tabernacled by your earthly sistine
[52:02] element
[52:03] amen so now adam he came on earth
[52:07] yes he couldn't manifest with the earth
[52:09] he couldn't express himself
[52:11] because the celestia life form is of
[52:14] another form
[52:15] and the earthly life form is of another
[52:18] form
[52:18] now this earthly life cannot go to the
[52:21] celestial dimension
[52:23] it can temple the celestial dimension
[52:26] but all it can do is earthly
[52:28] however the celestial life form can come
[52:30] on the terrestrial life
[52:31] life form but its manifestation will not
[52:34] be seen
[52:34] effectively until it picks cystine
[52:37] element
[52:38] of calcium potassium sulfur cosmic light
[52:42] x-ray whatever you have in your body
[52:44] ion then he can manifest as an earthly
[52:47] being
[52:47] amen so adam was on earth he was the
[52:50] first one the lord asked who go for us
[52:52] who want to start the redemption
[52:54] redemption story
[52:55] adam said lord i will go say how are you
[52:57] going to go i will break
[52:59] the life form from the celestia and then
[53:02] transform it into a territorial life
[53:04] form and the lord said go my son
[53:07] so adam came in that you funny form and
[53:09] because he was
[53:10] the bible said that adam was what god
[53:12] upon the earth what does god do
[53:14] he's got a creative power he's got a
[53:17] spoken word ability
[53:18] he can speak this into creation so adam
[53:21] just spoke
[53:22] just by thought the flesh system element
[53:26] cluttered on his body he became a human
[53:29] being and the bible said then he became
[53:30] a living soul
[53:32] amen he had the nature of the earth he
[53:35] was already a celestial being
[53:37] he was already a theophany he didn't
[53:39] need it eternal life
[53:40] he was a tenor was it yesterday brother
[53:42] troy said that
[53:43] uh the reason why we struggle here
[53:47] because our life is heavenly
[53:49] and we are trying to lead earthly life
[53:51] and i think brother villanueva
[53:53] said the same thing that we were
[53:55] heavenly to begin with
[53:56] and we are trying to work this earthly
[53:58] life which is not our original life
[54:00] so we kind of find problems here and
[54:02] there amen
[54:04] so before we drop here before you became
[54:06] brother troy
[54:07] you wear brother troy somewhere amen
[54:09] before we came brother jack earthly
[54:11] you were able to jack somewhere amen in
[54:14] the eternal dimension
[54:15] which is right here but in a more faster
[54:17] dimension amen
[54:19] so adam called his earth onto his skin
[54:23] onto the celestial body and i don't
[54:25] begin to manifest begin to drink water
[54:27] and the bible said that the lord was
[54:29] pleased because
[54:31] his thoughts and his motive
[54:34] has begun to unveil by his first son
[54:37] adam
[54:39] speaking life into his own body creating
[54:41] his own flesh
[54:42] because adam is god on the earth other
[54:45] means red earth
[54:46] earth that has got blood who's sitting
[54:48] in the body
[54:50] amen we've got a lot of earth here they
[54:52] don't have blood in them
[54:53] by your blood your earth and my earth
[54:55] element
[54:56] has got blood circulating our body so
[54:59] adam is red earth
[55:00] when he spoke element into his body now
[55:03] we came on a different pattern
[55:06] we our party we didn't come with a
[55:08] spirit first
[55:09] we bypass to bypass how many have used
[55:12] bypass on the on i-95
[55:15] if i bypass the speaker that means the
[55:17] speaker should be here for me to bypass
[55:19] it
[55:20] i can't bypass okeechobee when okay it's
[55:22] not here
[55:23] if i buy past okeechobee then i have to
[55:25] okay we should be somewhere here
[55:27] in my periphery in my terrain but
[55:30] instead of going to okeechobee
[55:31] i bypass it and go to military trail or
[55:34] go to i-95
[55:36] so for adam for us to bypass our few
[55:38] funny the theophany has to be there for
[55:40] us to bypass the few funny
[55:42] amen so the three fan is a tenor amen
[55:46] it didn't begin when adam was here you
[55:49] finally didn't begin when you had the
[55:50] holy ghost
[55:51] it's always been here it's always been
[55:53] in you amen
[55:54] but you didn't know so we came as earth
[55:56] first
[55:57] and when we were born in the we were in
[55:59] our father's gym our fathers transferred
[56:01] it to our mothers
[56:02] and they conceived us went through that
[56:04] night nine months of pregnancy
[56:06] with vomiting and nausea and what have
[56:08] you the sisters know it
[56:10] then we drop from the from our mother's
[56:12] room onto the earth
[56:13] now when we were in the womb we didn't
[56:14] have life we were just operating
[56:17] upon the life form of your mother her
[56:20] pulses
[56:21] her nutrients what her view her blood
[56:24] circulation
[56:25] was running through you but then just
[56:28] before you drop
[56:29] the almighty send a spirit around your
[56:32] mother
[56:33] it didn't matter who your mother was she
[56:36] could have been the most wicked woman
[56:38] but that life form made your mother
[56:40] sweet just before you drop
[56:43] now when you drop that life form
[56:45] dropping to you
[56:47] and you became a living soul amen
[56:50] glory hallelujah glory hallelujah to the
[56:53] lord
[56:55] adam was a living soul he came first
[56:57] with a spirit with the original
[56:59] and spoke the earth into creation onto
[57:02] his body
[57:03] now we came with the flesh and then the
[57:06] the spoken with the theophany came to us
[57:09] at the right time at the breath and we
[57:11] didn't know that you funny until the
[57:13] holy ghost baptism
[57:14] quicken your mind to let you know that
[57:16] brother smiley
[57:18] but a quick who sister erica you work
[57:20] before the foundation of the world
[57:22] you are not just an earthly person you
[57:24] are not just an american
[57:26] you are not just a dust but you are
[57:28] eternal person
[57:29] amen you came from elohim you are an
[57:32] elohim
[57:33] elohim is in you and when you live here
[57:35] you go back to elohim
[57:36] because elohim has always been in you
[57:39] amen glory
[57:40] hallelujah amen
[57:43] blessed be the lord
[57:57] so the life form is the same life
[58:00] whether through adam
[58:02] through us in the same life eternal life
[58:06] now the lord jesus christ came also on
[58:07] another pattern
[58:09] glory hallelujah now we have a life adam
[58:12] as we know he came he brought the
[58:13] celestial face on earth
[58:15] then he's put the terrestria onto his
[58:17] body covered the
[58:19] uh the the celestia with this teresia
[58:22] we came with the teresha the 8th man
[58:25] 16th element
[58:26] then the celestia sorry the celestia yes
[58:29] move into us
[58:30] amen now jesus christ came in between
[58:33] the two
[58:34] jesus christ was the original life he
[58:37] was the great eternal
[58:38] he was the el ella elohim he was el
[58:41] shaddai
[58:42] he was the jova rapha he was the
[58:44] omnipotent
[58:45] he was the almighty he was the all in
[58:47] all he was the source of all life
[58:50] he was the i am who i am he was the
[58:52] center of everything
[58:54] he was the divine operating system he
[58:56] was all in all
[58:57] you can use thousand years you can't
[58:59] finish describing him
[59:01] he's more than description we try to
[59:02] describe him amen
[59:04] now he came he picked the two adam
[59:08] and i were following it and came in
[59:10] between because we wanted to breach the
[59:12] two
[59:13] amen so he came with the original just
[59:15] like adam came with the
[59:16] original but then he came as a human
[59:19] being
[59:20] amen so when he came he was born as a
[59:23] human being
[59:24] he drank breast milk he was circumcised
[59:26] on the eighth day
[59:27] he cried like just like any baby christ
[59:29] he might have headaches
[59:31] and fever and whatever cold chills and
[59:33] everything
[59:34] he had to even there was a time that his
[59:36] life was in danger
[59:38] he couldn't help himself as a baby so
[59:40] joseph his foster father and mary
[59:42] had to take him and run away go to egypt
[59:46] that was almighty god in the baby form
[59:50] he couldn't speak for himself he was
[59:52] helpless
[59:53] as perfect human being a perfect baby
[59:57] so that he can feel your infirmity as
[59:59] hebrews said that he is a high priest
[1:00:01] who can be touched by the feeling of
[1:00:03] your infirmity
[1:00:05] he couldn't understand if he has never
[1:00:06] been sick before
[1:00:08] you can understand a sinner if you have
[1:00:10] never been born a sinner before
[1:00:12] but because we are born in sin shaping
[1:00:14] iniquity you can
[1:00:15] you can i mean what you call it you can
[1:00:18] understand somebody going through the
[1:00:19] same thing
[1:00:20] because you have gone through the same
[1:00:21] thing before amen
[1:00:23] so the lord has to become a human being
[1:00:25] be born a baby
[1:00:27] be tried just like you and i tried upon
[1:00:29] the earth
[1:00:30] he went through the wilderness of all
[1:00:31] the trials you can think about
[1:00:33] all the demons religious spirit do you
[1:00:36] know the
[1:00:36] the greatest demon the highest form of
[1:00:38] demonic spirit
[1:00:40] it's not the demon that scared children
[1:00:42] that tell the children that oh
[1:00:45] in the night there's a escape crew some
[1:00:46] no that's not a demon
[1:00:48] it's not a demon that gives cancer no
[1:00:50] that's just a crap
[1:00:52] a craft form it's not a demon that just
[1:00:55] kill somebody no religious demons are
[1:00:57] the highest form of demons
[1:01:00] because they are the closest religion
[1:01:03] they have a form of religion religion
[1:01:06] means a covering
[1:01:07] they come in the form of christ
[1:01:09] yesterday antichrist
[1:01:11] yes it is the devil so in jesus time
[1:01:15] the trial that he faced wasn't trust
[1:01:17] about drinking and smoking and
[1:01:19] fornication and adultery and divorce and
[1:01:21] those trials his trials were the
[1:01:23] religious
[1:01:24] spirit amen who
[1:01:27] wanted to kill him because they could
[1:01:28] see the life they knew he was almighty
[1:01:30] god
[1:01:31] they knew at the back of that of their
[1:01:33] mind they wouldn't say it in public they
[1:01:34] even say his name
[1:01:36] they told them don't say his name we
[1:01:37] don't want to if you hear the name jesus
[1:01:39] you and your family you're going to die
[1:01:42] but
[1:01:43] would regardless of the trust that he
[1:01:44] went through he overcame all of them
[1:01:47] so that he can stand in a place for us
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:52] and make intercession for you when we
[1:01:54] couldn't make intercession for ourselves
[1:01:56] amen so he came in the two to bridge the
[1:02:00] lost
[1:02:01] and they found together to bring us our
[1:02:03] sons and daughters of god
[1:02:05] in a full manifestation amen glory
[1:02:08] hallelujah
[1:02:11] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:02:13] christ
[1:02:15] let's look at easter let's go let's use
[1:02:18] um let's go back to job
[1:02:21] how job went through a form of easter
[1:02:25] glory hallelujah remember easter is
[1:02:28] death
[1:02:28] barrier and resurrection and sometimes
[1:02:31] the lord will allow certain things to
[1:02:33] come to your life
[1:02:34] to bring the attribute to bring you
[1:02:36] understanding
[1:02:37] remember in the bible the lord told was
[1:02:39] it jeremiah wanted the prophet
[1:02:41] to go and lie by his side for how many
[1:02:43] days however long
[1:02:45] he should only sleep by one side and
[1:02:47] then turn on the other side
[1:02:49] he told him to go to the cabin depot's
[1:02:51] house he wasn't a potter
[1:02:54] he didn't want to trade to learn that
[1:02:56] tree to become a potter
[1:02:57] but he had to learn a life form he had
[1:02:59] to learn something so the lord told me
[1:03:01] to go to the potter's house
[1:03:02] and see how the portal weaves the
[1:03:04] earthenware vessels
[1:03:06] there was a sermon like brother troy
[1:03:08] told us yesterday the person that he
[1:03:10] hired to fix his bathroom
[1:03:11] he was watching this man laying the the
[1:03:14] tiles and whatever
[1:03:16] and looking at how it's going to the
[1:03:17] sink to make sure it was the right thing
[1:03:19] the lord was giving him a cement right
[1:03:21] there in the bathroom in his house
[1:03:23] so whatever you go through it might not
[1:03:25] be fun it might not be pleasant
[1:03:27] but the lord has a sermon for you amen
[1:03:30] glory hallelujah
[1:03:31] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:35] so we know the story of job job went
[1:03:37] through easter
[1:03:39] jew was a right the most the perfect man
[1:03:41] most perfect man on earth
[1:03:43] but it appears that children didn't walk
[1:03:45] working job's way
[1:03:47] bajob knew he was a man of god he was a
[1:03:50] man god spoke
[1:03:52] face to face lip to lip eye to eye
[1:03:55] and he was a perfect amanda please god
[1:03:58] but not all the children wanted to walk
[1:03:59] in the way of job so the bible said job
[1:04:01] made
[1:04:02] intercessions for them in those time
[1:04:04] they had to slay lambs
[1:04:05] and sheep and what have you so joe was
[1:04:08] always praying for them and it looks
[1:04:09] like the children live
[1:04:11] life partying if you read what the
[1:04:12] prophet told us let me read something
[1:04:14] from here
[1:04:15] blessed be the name of the lord there's
[1:04:18] nothing out of kata the lord knows
[1:04:20] everything
[1:04:20] amen and he made provision for you
[1:04:23] and all your loved ones regardless of
[1:04:26] what amen
[1:04:27] you cover them let's read something here
[1:04:30] from um
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:32] the message
[1:04:35] i think fellowship
[1:04:44] right let's look at um the message
[1:04:46] fellowship
[1:04:47] okay let me go back give me one second
[1:04:50] blessed be the lord let me read
[1:04:56] okay let me read fellowship by
[1:04:57] redemption first before i go to
[1:04:59] fellowship
[1:05:01] 550403 fellowship by redemption
[1:05:03] paragraph 148
[1:05:06] now god has confidence in job
[1:05:10] he had fellowship with him and he knew
[1:05:12] that job could trust him
[1:05:13] so he said all right satan you go on
[1:05:16] he's at your hands but do not touch do
[1:05:19] not take his life
[1:05:20] you can't do anything else so satan got
[1:05:23] satan good at his office
[1:05:25] i want us to know this satan is good at
[1:05:27] his office if the lord permits him he's
[1:05:29] going to try you to the last call
[1:05:32] so away he goes and he kills all jobs
[1:05:35] children
[1:05:36] he said now i want you to notice a lot
[1:05:37] of things you kind of had a pre-thought
[1:05:39] of that i believe
[1:05:41] do you notice when his children all of
[1:05:42] them got together one day they had a
[1:05:44] great big
[1:05:45] banquet there is where you usually get
[1:05:49] in some trouble going to those big
[1:05:50] parties
[1:05:51] all right so the prophet just broke it
[1:05:53] out brought a banquet then he made it
[1:05:54] more modern language
[1:05:56] they go for partying club clubbing
[1:05:59] go to dance all night with the men and
[1:06:01] the women
[1:06:02] you know drink and what have you
[1:06:04] so-called good times
[1:06:06] that's where death lays the devil
[1:06:09] painted
[1:06:10] as life but it's actually death
[1:06:12] undercover
[1:06:13] remember policemen that record under
[1:06:14] cover cups they can
[1:06:16] come in plenty you wouldn't know
[1:06:18] he's a policeman
[1:06:20] during the insurrection there were some
[1:06:22] of the police people who were avia agent
[1:06:24] who were there
[1:06:25] they were just like that part of the the
[1:06:27] trump is so called
[1:06:29] but they were undercover police taking
[1:06:31] pictures
[1:06:32] they didn't know they were wearing
[1:06:33] clothes they were even wearing
[1:06:35] the same clothing like the people right
[1:06:38] so undercover is something which
[1:06:40] disguises himself
[1:06:42] so the devil is an undercover he comes
[1:06:46] so sweet so lively so pleasant and
[1:06:49] beautiful
[1:06:50] so appealing but behind that action
[1:06:53] is death amen but there's a life
[1:06:57] the life of jesus christ which is more
[1:07:01] far greater than he that is in us is
[1:07:02] greater than he that is in the world so
[1:07:04] job
[1:07:04] knew that his children do not walk in
[1:07:06] his way
[1:07:08] they love to party they don't want to go
[1:07:10] to church
[1:07:11] when job is at the tabernacle praying
[1:07:12] the children are on their way running
[1:07:15] top speed you know doing whatever they
[1:07:16] wanted to eat for it to be modern times
[1:07:18] but then job always made sacrifice for
[1:07:21] them prayed for them
[1:07:23] went on his knees for them and there was
[1:07:25] a time as the professor he knew
[1:07:27] that something could happen to the
[1:07:28] children so he was careful and always
[1:07:30] making intercession
[1:07:31] and we know that we know the story one
[1:07:33] day when the lord permitted
[1:07:34] satan to try job he tried him to the
[1:07:37] fullest as the prophet said satan is
[1:07:39] good at his job
[1:07:40] whatever the devil is doing he's not
[1:07:42] doing on his own the lord permitted him
[1:07:43] to do that
[1:07:45] whatever comes through your to your life
[1:07:47] comes to me
[1:07:48] if the lord doesn't permit it nothing
[1:07:50] can touch touch you
[1:07:52] even jesus when was that uh is if one of
[1:07:55] them
[1:07:56] was the name one of the um they took him
[1:07:58] to the uh
[1:07:59] was the name not pharaoh pilot thank you
[1:08:02] sarika pilot uh hall
[1:08:03] he said i've got a part to release you
[1:08:05] tell me your story he said you don't
[1:08:06] have no power
[1:08:07] unless the holy ghost in me allows you
[1:08:10] you don't have no power over me
[1:08:11] and i said daughter of god nothing
[1:08:14] cancer sickness
[1:08:15] coronavirus nothing has power over you
[1:08:18] unless the spirit in me allows me to die
[1:08:21] through that
[1:08:22] then that's that's the point that's
[1:08:23] where i'm ordained to do it
[1:08:25] beside that nothing can take your life
[1:08:27] you can walk through coronavirus
[1:08:29] canaverals can walk through you you can
[1:08:31] be infected you know even know that you
[1:08:32] are infected and
[1:08:33] being healed amen for he that is in you
[1:08:36] is greater than he does in the world
[1:08:38] amen because you've got a life form
[1:08:40] you've got a mission here on earth
[1:08:42] and nothing can stop that mission until
[1:08:44] you fulfill those missions
[1:08:45] glory hallelujah so when job children
[1:08:48] die
[1:08:49] and you know everything went sour
[1:08:50] everything went south
[1:08:52] for job but the lord the sacrifice that
[1:08:54] he made
[1:08:55] the praise the the
[1:08:58] offerings that job made spoke for job
[1:09:02] and job didn't know easter he knew a
[1:09:04] portion of easter
[1:09:06] he knew two-thirds of easter death
[1:09:09] barrier by the third pool of easter
[1:09:12] job didn't know the third pool was what
[1:09:15] the resurrection
[1:09:16] so job said that oh look a man a man
[1:09:19] dies and the children will be crying
[1:09:20] around him or her
[1:09:22] the man doesn't notice so he didn't know
[1:09:24] about resurrection
[1:09:26] and the lord used his own children to
[1:09:28] teach him about resurrection
[1:09:30] glory hallelujah amen so when his
[1:09:33] children died
[1:09:34] the bible said that the lord restored
[1:09:36] all that he he lost twice
[1:09:39] his sheep he had i think seven thousand
[1:09:41] got fourteen thousand
[1:09:43] seven double double double double double
[1:09:46] double double
[1:09:48] but his children glory hallelujah
[1:09:51] the children were not doubled he
[1:09:53] restored exactly
[1:09:55] what he had to them to him amen
[1:09:59] now let's see the kind of restoration
[1:10:00] that lord gave to job now when the bible
[1:10:02] said
[1:10:03] the lord restored his children it didn't
[1:10:05] mean that the children were if the
[1:10:06] another children were born
[1:10:08] then they would have been different
[1:10:09] children and the bible also didn't teach
[1:10:12] pre uh reincarnation
[1:10:15] let's see who will die and we could come
[1:10:18] back and leave be born again no
[1:10:20] not even jesus christ he was born
[1:10:24] died once he can pick his earthly flesh
[1:10:27] and use it but he's not going to be born
[1:10:29] by mary again no
[1:10:31] right the prophet said we passed through
[1:10:33] this place once
[1:10:35] you wouldn't even like to come twice
[1:10:38] after that you want to be a celestial
[1:10:39] body
[1:10:40] you want to have your spoken word body
[1:10:41] but you don't want to have the blast
[1:10:43] system in you
[1:10:44] you want to use the theophany because
[1:10:45] this place is our inheritance
[1:10:47] when all is said and done this is where
[1:10:50] we're going to be
[1:10:51] amen this is our inheritance right here
[1:10:53] on earth
[1:10:54] amen we have the authority over the
[1:10:57] element of the earth
[1:10:58] the water the earth the fire and the air
[1:11:01] we can speak them into existence i don't
[1:11:04] have to take a jet plane to africa
[1:11:07] you can just speak and you can appear in
[1:11:08] africa
[1:11:10] and speak and appear back here if it
[1:11:12] becomes necessary
[1:11:14] that spirit that authority is already in
[1:11:15] you if it's not necessary the lord will
[1:11:18] give you
[1:11:18] money to buy a ticket to go and preach
[1:11:21] to go to wherever
[1:11:22] you you go to but when it becomes
[1:11:24] necessary that maybe for whatever you
[1:11:26] can
[1:11:27] have a jet plane and the lord wants by
[1:11:28] the job to go and preach in
[1:11:30] australia zimbabwe but i smiley if you
[1:11:33] want to go to london
[1:11:34] you just appear in london and the
[1:11:36] brandon said how did you come here
[1:11:37] really
[1:11:39] you didn't call us to pick you at
[1:11:40] airport how come you are here
[1:11:42] he said i'm a spoken with son of god i'm
[1:11:44] spoken with the daughter of god
[1:11:45] i can speak myself into creation amen
[1:11:49] and this has happened before in the
[1:11:50] bible new testament what's the name
[1:11:53] stephen philip thank you
[1:11:56] when it was necessary philip didn't have
[1:11:58] vehicles on the highway and the lord
[1:12:00] needed him to preach at a certain place
[1:12:02] after baptizing the ethiopian eunuch he
[1:12:04] just by
[1:12:05] by thought he just opened his eyes and
[1:12:07] he's just where he needed to preach
[1:12:09] that power is in you glory hallelujah
[1:12:13] and that is our easter glory so let's
[1:12:16] see the
[1:12:16] restoration that lord gave unto job
[1:12:18] let's go to
[1:12:20] i think fellowship yes fellowship
[1:12:24] 6006 111 b
[1:12:33] paragraph 23 the message fellowship 60
[1:12:35] 60
[1:12:36] 0 6 11 b fellowship 23
[1:12:41] so now god begin to restore back to job
[1:12:45] he restored his stock his animals
[1:12:48] livestock and everything double
[1:12:50] but did you notice about his children
[1:12:52] god restored
[1:12:53] restored back to job's children restored
[1:12:56] back those children
[1:12:57] didn't say he doubled them but he
[1:12:59] restored them to him
[1:13:01] wonder where they were at did you ever
[1:13:04] take a thought
[1:13:05] of that and read the book of job they
[1:13:08] were in glory
[1:13:09] waiting for him because he had offered a
[1:13:12] sacrifice
[1:13:13] under the shed blood and he knowed where
[1:13:16] they were
[1:13:16] waiting for him under the shed blood now
[1:13:19] he never say he gave him back another
[1:13:21] bunch of children
[1:13:22] but he restored a guard job's children
[1:13:25] to him because they were waiting for him
[1:13:27] under the shed blood of the sacrifice
[1:13:30] amen when when the lord took your
[1:13:32] children to glory
[1:13:34] job thought that was the end because the
[1:13:36] children were vagabond kind of
[1:13:38] vagabond disobedient children but they
[1:13:40] had a serial representation
[1:13:42] regardless of their earthly life form
[1:13:45] the skin was what
[1:13:48] he saw but the spirit in them was jacob
[1:13:53] the skin the outward form
[1:13:57] is nothing good to look at
[1:14:01] but the seed is jacob amen
[1:14:05] they have representation before the
[1:14:06] foundation of the world if you don't see
[1:14:08] them here at the altar
[1:14:10] don't be troubled keep making sacrifices
[1:14:13] for them
[1:14:14] if you never see them here sitting here
[1:14:18] aiming brother jack don't be worried
[1:14:21] keep your sacrifice
[1:14:22] keep praying for them keep covering them
[1:14:24] they were before the foundation of the
[1:14:26] world
[1:14:27] amen glory hallelujah amen
[1:14:30] they were before therefore amen
[1:14:34] before they became vagabond they were a
[1:14:36] seed of god
[1:14:38] and nothing can cheat their
[1:14:39] predestination they cannot change their
[1:14:42] predecession
[1:14:44] regardless of how far they are gone they
[1:14:46] can make you sad
[1:14:48] they can make you break down they can
[1:14:50] make you sorrowful it doesn't change
[1:14:52] their predestination
[1:14:53] they have a seat they are too funny is
[1:14:55] before the father above
[1:14:56] amen the skin will be looked like
[1:15:00] jacob sorry esau but the seed
[1:15:03] is jacob it's israel amen glory
[1:15:06] hallelujah to the lord
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:16] so now when the lord opened job's eyes
[1:15:19] in a vision he went into a vision
[1:15:22] he thought the students were gone he
[1:15:24] wasn't going to see them no more
[1:15:26] not in this life or their life to come
[1:15:28] and one day the lord opened job's eyes
[1:15:31] and he saw all his seven children oh my
[1:15:33] goodness
[1:15:34] his beautiful daughters i think seven
[1:15:36] sons and three girls
[1:15:38] jemima kezia karen and whatever
[1:15:42] yes and you scream he said though
[1:15:46] the whims eat my flesh this flesh
[1:15:50] yet in my body in my flesh i shall see
[1:15:53] my maker
[1:15:54] this earthly man the sistine element can
[1:15:57] go down
[1:15:58] but me job the real me i'm working with
[1:16:01] my children
[1:16:02] on the other side and joe came back
[1:16:04] screaming and shouting and yelling
[1:16:05] hallelujah
[1:16:06] to the lord because he saw himself with
[1:16:08] his children
[1:16:09] and his wife and all the loved ones at
[1:16:12] the other side of glory
[1:16:13] amen nothing the law of
[1:16:16] conservation of matter says energy can
[1:16:19] be transformed from one form to another
[1:16:21] but it cannot be destroyed the devil
[1:16:24] cannot destroy
[1:16:25] your children the devil cannot destroy
[1:16:27] your heritage
[1:16:28] the outward look will not change doesn't
[1:16:31] change previous nation
[1:16:32] amen they are sons and daughters of god
[1:16:36] and you speak life to them speak life in
[1:16:38] them
[1:16:39] and like i said if you don't see them
[1:16:40] even sitting on the pew with you
[1:16:42] don't be bothered their names were
[1:16:45] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:16:46] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:16:49] glory hallelujah
[1:16:51] it doesn't matter it could be the 11th
[1:16:53] hour
[1:16:54] the lord will let them know who they are
[1:16:56] amen you could even be the time of
[1:16:58] pardon the
[1:16:59] i mean going on the other side the lord
[1:17:01] revealed himself to them
[1:17:02] and they will know that they are sons
[1:17:03] and daughters of god glory hallelujah to
[1:17:06] the lord
[1:17:07] blessed be the name of the lord and that
[1:17:09] was one of the eastest
[1:17:12] job hadastah when he had resurrection
[1:17:16] uh death barrier and resurrection his
[1:17:19] children died
[1:17:20] they were buried but he saw his children
[1:17:22] at the other side
[1:17:24] in their theophany not as parting
[1:17:25] children they were no longer going for
[1:17:27] party and clubs
[1:17:28] but he saw them as celestia under the
[1:17:30] altar under the lamp of god
[1:17:32] under the bloody altar remember that
[1:17:35] time the lord
[1:17:36] hasn't come down calvary hasn't come in
[1:17:38] yet so they were all waiting for calvary
[1:17:41] to be taken to the celestial dimension
[1:17:42] to uh today heaven itself
[1:17:44] amen now let's look at another
[1:17:48] easter glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:17:51] that was uh let's read john chapter 11
[1:17:55] at the death of lazarus
[1:17:58] martha and mary lost their brother as we
[1:18:00] will call it
[1:18:01] dear brother the only brother who was a
[1:18:04] breadwinner in the family
[1:18:06] died unexpectedly and it was
[1:18:09] chaos confusion and everything seemed to
[1:18:13] be gone
[1:18:14] in the family and they had only one hope
[1:18:16] jesus christ
[1:18:18] they invited him to come and pray for
[1:18:19] him he didn't turn up
[1:18:21] he waited until he died that's when he
[1:18:24] showed up what kind of pastor is this
[1:18:26] a pastor who does not turn to the needs
[1:18:28] of your church members
[1:18:29] when they need you to pray for them but
[1:18:31] we have to be led of the lord
[1:18:33] amen the pastors are not led by men
[1:18:36] they are led by the lord amen
[1:18:40] you might want them to be here at this
[1:18:41] time you might want them to do this
[1:18:44] but they have a master in their heart if
[1:18:46] the jack's master doesn't let him to do
[1:18:48] what you need to do
[1:18:49] you might probably call him ten times he
[1:18:51] said sister i'll be coming since i'm
[1:18:53] praying
[1:18:54] for you but brother jack i need you to
[1:18:55] come and pray for me come to my house
[1:18:58] since i'm praying for you and you might
[1:19:00] not understand why because he has a
[1:19:01] master
[1:19:01] in him who has authorized him to go pray
[1:19:04] for you
[1:19:05] or to pray for you from his house or
[1:19:07] even not to pray for you
[1:19:09] because the master wants your faith to
[1:19:10] come up because the healing is in you
[1:19:13] and the master doesn't want by the job
[1:19:14] to pray for you he wants you to receive
[1:19:17] your healing from within
[1:19:18] out and then come to the tabernacle and
[1:19:20] talk by the jack in the church
[1:19:22] what the lord did for you so sometimes
[1:19:24] the lord can put
[1:19:25] a jack aside and then deal with you
[1:19:27] directly
[1:19:28] and speak to you that the healing
[1:19:30] whatever you need is in you
[1:19:32] and you believe it and speak amen just
[1:19:35] like martha and mary
[1:19:37] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:19:40] let's read uh john chapter 11 verse
[1:19:43] let's just read for the sake of time
[1:19:47] glory hallelujah let's read verse 25 and
[1:19:50] the 26
[1:19:51] and you can read the rest of the story
[1:19:55] let's read from 20 please i think we can
[1:19:58] do that 20.
[1:20:00] john 11 22 26 then martha as soon as she
[1:20:04] heard that jesus was coming went and
[1:20:05] meet
[1:20:06] meet him but mary sat still
[1:20:09] in the house then said martha unto jesus
[1:20:12] lord if thou
[1:20:13] has been here my brother had not died
[1:20:16] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[1:20:19] would ask god god will give it to you
[1:20:22] let's look at martha's face this is so
[1:20:23] interesting i love this this
[1:20:25] i think that jack taught us probably a
[1:20:27] year or two ago
[1:20:28] and so martha had confidence in jesus
[1:20:31] and said lord i know whatever you speak
[1:20:34] the christ in you
[1:20:36] the almighty in you will bring it to the
[1:20:38] past so now she used the word
[1:20:40] now but i know that even now
[1:20:43] whatsoever that will ask god god will
[1:20:46] give it to
[1:20:47] you so 23
[1:20:50] perfect faith jesus said unto her thy
[1:20:53] brother
[1:20:54] shall rise again then sister mata said
[1:20:58] matter said unto him i know that he
[1:21:00] shall rise again
[1:21:01] in the resurrection at the last day so
[1:21:03] now martha wanted her brother
[1:21:05] to be to be resurrected right now but
[1:21:07] now she's pushing the promise
[1:21:09] in the future and many of us do that
[1:21:11] futuristic
[1:21:13] everything is in the future god is not
[1:21:15] doing nothing now
[1:21:17] god did something some years ago but now
[1:21:20] god is not doing nothing
[1:21:22] what kind of god are we serving let me
[1:21:25] use

[1:22:24] years pass

[1:22:26] future but right now no

[1:22:57] the present

[1:25:49] and every night
[1:25:50] and so we don't have to put god in the
[1:25:52] past or in the future
[1:25:54] but we have to stand as now amen
[1:25:58] i am that i am i am he who i am
[1:26:01] i am elohim i am the present day god
[1:26:04] i speak and creation obey me and the
[1:26:07] same christ
[1:26:08] is in you but you have to exercise that
[1:26:10] authority
[1:26:11] you speak whatever thou need whatever
[1:26:14] thou need
[1:26:15] just speak into creation it doesn't
[1:26:17] matter how long it's going to come to
[1:26:18] pass
[1:26:19] it doesn't time is of nothing the
[1:26:21] element will put together
[1:26:23] and create what you need amen glory
[1:26:26] hallelujah to the lord
[1:26:28] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:26:30] christ
[1:26:31] glory hallelujah let me read one
[1:26:40] oh my let me read about you one about
[1:26:41] you one more quotation and i'll be done
[1:26:45] 61080 at the house
[1:26:48] and so did you notice after the spirit
[1:26:49] of god had come upon the prophet
[1:26:51] and everything got all right you see god
[1:26:54] restored back to job what he restored
[1:26:56] back to him
[1:26:57] where he had ten thousand cattle he had
[1:27:00] he gave him
[1:27:01] twenty thousand cattle where he had for
[1:27:03] forty thousand sheep he gave him eight
[1:27:05] eighty thousand sheep
[1:27:06] and he restored everything back to him
[1:27:08] that he ever had
[1:27:09] and you notice and restore his seven
[1:27:12] children he gave job his
[1:27:13] seven children not the no not
[1:27:17] didn't give him seven other children but
[1:27:19] he gave job
[1:27:20] his seven children now what was it his
[1:27:23] house
[1:27:24] thy and thy house because he was
[1:27:26] righteous
[1:27:27] because he was standing on everything
[1:27:28] that god gave him to be righteous or
[1:27:30] give him
[1:27:31] was offered that bent offering and he
[1:27:33] knowed
[1:27:34] that that was god's word and he could
[1:27:36] not feel so did you ever think
[1:27:38] where them children was they was in
[1:27:40] heaven
[1:27:41] waiting for him he is with them today
[1:27:45] and god saved those children they were
[1:27:47] in heaven waiting for him
[1:27:49] if the lord saved job's children under
[1:27:51] the sacrifice of good and booze
[1:27:54] how much more under the sacrifice of the
[1:27:57] resurrected jesus christ
[1:28:00] if the lord gave love mary and martha
[1:28:02] their only brother loves rose back to
[1:28:04] them
[1:28:05] another blood and booze remember when
[1:28:08] jesus was here until
[1:28:09] the sacrifice was offered the testament
[1:28:12] was not in effect yet
[1:28:14] so until calvary the testament was not
[1:28:17] infected but now where's the testament
[1:28:20] it's in full effect now amen
[1:28:24] and whatever you need you are the
[1:28:26] resurrection you are the resurrected
[1:28:29] message jesus christ
[1:28:30] you are the jesus christ on earth right
[1:28:32] now
[1:28:33] don't point people back to jesus christ
[1:28:35] 2000 years ago
[1:28:36] yes that is a reference point i always
[1:28:39] say that
[1:28:40] whoever comes to christ you have to go
[1:28:41] back to calvary first
[1:28:43] because you can't do without cavalry
[1:28:45] it's just like when a baby is born into
[1:28:46] their family
[1:28:47] regardless of what meal the mother has
[1:28:50] to get some milk
[1:28:52] he has to get some formula you might be
[1:28:54] eating all kind of food solid food
[1:28:56] but because there's a newborn baby in
[1:28:57] the family there's a need for milk
[1:29:00] the same thing when a child a son of god
[1:29:01] or a child of god is born into the
[1:29:03] family of god
[1:29:04] that person needs to start drinking milk
[1:29:06] what do you drink your milk
[1:29:07] calvary that's your first easter you
[1:29:10] have to die
[1:29:11] be buried and resurrected you have to be
[1:29:14] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:29:16] christ
[1:29:17] confess your sins and the lord will come
[1:29:19] into you wash you whiter than the snow
[1:29:21] as brother by the trailers then the lord
[1:29:24] will take your tabernacle
[1:29:25] you are no longer the person you used to
[1:29:27] be you are now jesus christ
[1:29:29] walking on earth you are not jesus
[1:29:31] christ all by yourself
[1:29:32] but you are jesus christ amen let me use
[1:29:35] brother jack for example but jagdaf
[1:29:38] says erica is deaf he's she's not deaf
[1:29:40] all by herself
[1:29:42] sister rebecca sarah the adapts is that
[1:29:45] alexander did i get it right yes he's
[1:29:47] got three daughters
[1:29:48] the old dab so sister sarah can boldly
[1:29:51] say that i'm deaf
[1:29:53] you can't say no no darth is brother
[1:29:54] jack dave no says i can't say that i'm
[1:29:56] deaf
[1:29:57] because it's part of the family so
[1:29:59] there's nothing wrong to say i am
[1:30:00] message jesus christ
[1:30:03] glory hallelujah
[1:30:06] but the jack is the pastor who stands
[1:30:07] here to preach sister may never come
[1:30:09] here to preach
[1:30:10] she might come here to sing his
[1:30:12] daughters will come here to sing
[1:30:14] but it doesn't make them less deaf they
[1:30:16] are so deaf amen
[1:30:19] we may not need to die on calvary our
[1:30:21] father did it on calvary
[1:30:23] but it doesn't make us less jesus christ
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:26] we committed a little small spoonful uh
[1:30:30] uh ocean the ingredient that that
[1:30:34] ingredient in the mighty ocean is the
[1:30:35] same ingredient in that spoonful
[1:30:38] if you fetch a spoonful of ocean if you
[1:30:40] go to the ocean and get just got a
[1:30:42] gallon full
[1:30:44] if you go to the lab and test the
[1:30:45] ingredient the amount of calcium
[1:30:48] potassium seaweed salt is the same thing
[1:30:51] in them amen so whatever the big mighty
[1:30:54] ocean can do
[1:30:55] the gallon and the spoonful can do
[1:30:58] whatever the big jesus christ can do
[1:31:01] when jesus christ take your tabernacle
[1:31:03] when he takes your tabernacle when he
[1:31:05] takes my tabernacle you can do the same
[1:31:06] thing that jesus christ can do
[1:31:08] amen so we are the resurrected christ
[1:31:12] we are the easter now i think i preached
[1:31:14] to 2019
[1:31:16] i preached the same on the the easter
[1:31:19] now what is the istana the present day
[1:31:21] easter
[1:31:22] you are the easter i think that was
[1:31:23] april the 20th and today is april the
[1:31:26] 2nd
[1:31:26] we are the resurrected jesus christ
[1:31:28] walking upon the earth
[1:31:30] manifesting our father and when he said
[1:31:32] that we are not telling lies
[1:31:34] go back to the book of acts chapter
[1:31:36] eight time whenever
[1:31:37] let us read it but remember when the
[1:31:39] soul was persecuted the christians
[1:31:41] chapter nine jesus christ appeared to
[1:31:42] him was he jesus christ
[1:31:45] how did he appear to him pill of fire
[1:31:48] and he said so so why are you
[1:31:51] persecuting me
[1:31:53] how can you persecute people of fire
[1:31:56] tell me how can you prescribe persecute
[1:31:59] a person that is dead
[1:32:01] and gone in heaven because the bible
[1:32:03] said he was ascended
[1:32:04] and went to heaven how can you go to
[1:32:07] heaven and persecute the almighty
[1:32:09] so where is heaven he said who are you
[1:32:13] so ask him who are thou
[1:32:15] he said i am jesus whom
[1:32:18] you are persecuting so who was so
[1:32:22] persecuting
[1:32:23] the church so is the church jesus christ
[1:32:29] i will go but i'll come i'll be with you
[1:32:32] emmanuel but i'll be in you

[1:32:49] but you are message jesus christ you are
[1:32:51] jesus christ in flesh
[1:32:53] amen the life that you have is elohim in
[1:32:56] manifestation
[1:32:57] you can be a small tiny a bottle of
[1:33:00] ocean
[1:33:01] you can do the same thing like the
[1:33:02] mighty ocean can do you you have the
[1:33:04] power to speak into creation
[1:33:06] you have the power to change
[1:33:06] circumstances you can transform life
[1:33:09] forms
[1:33:10] what is energy what is the law of
[1:33:12] conservation of energy
[1:33:13] changing one life form from one to
[1:33:16] another
[1:33:17] if something is not working you've got
[1:33:18] the power to speak it and your word
[1:33:21] is as good even better than the angel of
[1:33:23] heaven
[1:33:25] who is who is mightier the angel who
[1:33:28] sing glory glory hallelujah
[1:33:30] who cannot see the lord they cover their
[1:33:31] face cover their feet
[1:33:33] and they said holy holy holy is the lord
[1:33:35] almighty he who was a nation is to come
[1:33:37] and that's all they do
[1:33:38] holy holy is the lord almighty where is
[1:33:41] that angel
[1:33:42] is is it mass no is it another planet
[1:33:46] the angels are in and around you
[1:33:50] if your father will open your eyes to
[1:33:53] see those angels
[1:33:55] oh my sister you'll be walking you pass
[1:33:57] through the roof amen
[1:34:00] if the lord will open your eyes if you
[1:34:02] have give him attention not that he
[1:34:03] doesn't want to open our eyes
[1:34:05] but if we can give him our full

[1:34:23] my brother my sister you can pass
[1:34:25] through the roof there's nothing that
[1:34:27] can stand before you
[1:34:28] and that's what the lord has made us to
[1:34:30] be amen
[1:34:32] that was the chat the alpha church i
[1:34:33] think jack was the t
[1:34:35] uh another is that something pentecost
[1:34:39] he gave a theme of last shakana
[1:34:41] pentecost is that right
[1:34:45] amen so the same shekinah that was in
[1:34:47] pentecost
[1:34:48] uh 2000 years ago the same shakiness in
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:52] and the same thing that they came
[1:34:53] shivering and like drunk people
[1:34:56] and five thousand one twenty thousand
[1:34:58] and upper room got converted
[1:35:00] three thousand people the same spirit is
[1:35:02] in you and i
[1:35:03] yeah and our word is not just your my
[1:35:05] word and your word
[1:35:07] but your word is he who lives in you
[1:35:10] is the word of jesus christ and when you
[1:35:12] speak
[1:35:13] creation obey you and it's time to start
[1:35:16] speaking
[1:35:17] amen it's time to start putting the word
[1:35:19] into action
[1:35:21] more and more just let go and let christ
[1:35:23] take over
[1:35:24] don't worry don't let this guy decide
[1:35:25] for you let this guy decide amen
[1:35:29] don't let the five senses be your
[1:35:31] limitation
[1:35:37] sister mata was looking at the five
[1:35:39] senses and she was willing
[1:35:42] and crying i'm not going to see my
[1:35:44] brother in the last days
[1:35:46] but that sense the sixth sense came in
[1:35:50] when the lord came in he said i am the
[1:35:53] resurrection
[1:35:53] and life i'm alive forevermore
[1:35:57] jesus christ is in you and always know
[1:35:59] that you are not just
[1:36:00] no matter what situation that you come
[1:36:02] across go back to the sixth sense
[1:36:05] don't let the five senses the eyes of
[1:36:07] singing hearing tasting smelling
[1:36:10] touching the feeling decide for you but
[1:36:12] go back into the inner man
[1:36:14] he that is in you like upon you
[1:36:18] complaining and crying and he has to go
[1:36:20] back then the holy spirit in him
[1:36:22] begin to open his eyes that's the small
[1:36:25] voice
[1:36:25] that your children are not dead say but
[1:36:27] lord i don't see them
[1:36:28] i want to have fellowship with them and
[1:36:31] the lord opened his eyes
[1:36:33] in a glorious land and he stands his
[1:36:35] beautiful sons
[1:36:37] in full glory not burning in some hell
[1:36:40] no
[1:36:41] but they are under the right under the
[1:36:42] throne of god not that they are presence
[1:36:44] or the people of fire
[1:36:45] they have changed into the pillar fire
[1:36:47] and when our life is over
[1:36:50] it doesn't matter how we go
[1:36:53] we have a pill of fire in us and that
[1:36:56] pillow fire will cross you
[1:36:57] that's why we have a prophet even told
[1:36:59] us how to die
[1:37:01] death is nothing he said it's like just
[1:37:02] like a flesh of seeking
[1:37:04] it's like you spitting a mighty ocean
[1:37:06] and the ocean will turn into some
[1:37:08] something you can't describe in any
[1:37:10] language and before you could say jack
[1:37:12] you are the other side and you could see
[1:37:15] the people right here
[1:37:16] they might be willing around you but you
[1:37:19] see them your children
[1:37:20] you see your family you see everything
[1:37:24] so nothing should scare a son a daughter
[1:37:27] son and daughter of god
[1:37:28] because you are jesus christ that's what
[1:37:30] jesus christ went to
[1:37:31] was able to go to calvary and die for us
[1:37:34] because his life
[1:37:36] form was not going to end at the grief
[1:37:38] but it was being transformed
[1:37:40] from the human form to the celestial
[1:37:43] form
[1:37:44] in a glorified estate so that he can
[1:37:46] come back
[1:37:48] at the chicano glory shakina pentecost
[1:37:50] and leaving his people
[1:37:52] and that's what he's doing he's here
[1:37:54] living in us
[1:37:55] shall we be on our feet
[1:38:00] glory to our lord
[1:38:07] shall we pray

[1:38:43] of the five senses and let us follow the
[1:38:45] lord father the pill of light

[1:39:45] we thank god for the word tonight
[1:39:49] i i have just
[1:39:52] always uh been impressed
[1:39:55] by just how the lord uses uh
[1:39:59] brother kwaku and uh
[1:40:02] thermodynamics i'm like where where you
[1:40:04] get these tanks from
[1:40:06] but um you know energy cannot be
[1:40:09] destroyed
[1:40:10] it can only be transferred to another
[1:40:12] form
[1:40:14] and uh just tying that into the life of
[1:40:16] christ
[1:40:17] it could not be destroyed even
[1:40:20] even when he left this earth and you
[1:40:23] know maybe satan thought he had won the
[1:40:24] battle
[1:40:25] uh but no no it was got transferred now
[1:40:28] that same life
[1:40:30] that was in christ is now inside of us
[1:40:34] that have the holy ghost is we just need
[1:40:37] to recognize who we are
[1:40:40] right and and i just i this is just um
[1:40:44] even you as a individual can experience
[1:40:47] an easter you can go through your own
[1:40:50] death dime to yourself
[1:40:52] right burial and then resurrection amen
[1:40:56] i just i just appreciated that
[1:40:58] and i for years um
[1:41:02] you know when you look at the the quotes
[1:41:04] on job's children
[1:41:05] and there's different uh thoughts on
[1:41:07] that the way that uh it's been presented
[1:41:09] like job didn't get his
[1:41:11] kids but he got just seven more kids
[1:41:15] but when you really looked at that the
[1:41:16] way brother brother brother uh
[1:41:18] uh quake who brought that tonight we see
[1:41:20] god restored
[1:41:22] job's children right they were just
[1:41:25] waiting for him
[1:41:26] in glory and which was i mean that's
[1:41:28] just a beautiful they experienced a
[1:41:31] easter right job had a chance to
[1:41:34] experience his own easter with his own
[1:41:36] children
[1:41:37] and he did it under under the blood of
[1:41:40] bulls and goats i tell you what i
[1:41:42] i'm encouraged church i'm in i'm talking
[1:41:45] i'm really encouraged brother quick who
[1:41:47] told us tonight even if you don't see
[1:41:49] him here that's okay
[1:41:50] just just pray anyway right pray anyway
[1:41:55] what did he call him she said um uh uh
[1:41:59] where
[1:42:00] where i got this date job's children on
[1:42:02] the outside were esos
[1:42:05] my god but on the inside they were
[1:42:08] jacobs
[1:42:09] and you know and even when you look at
[1:42:11] that you know because
[1:42:12] uh esau looked like the right kind of
[1:42:15] man
[1:42:16] right he looked like the right kind of
[1:42:17] man but the bible said
[1:42:19] uh jacob half i love but esau half i
[1:42:22] hate it
[1:42:23] right and then sometimes our kids do
[1:42:25] things that we hate
[1:42:27] it's the truth anyhow right i mean their
[1:42:30] actions their attitudes this stuff that
[1:42:32] we just hate we don't we're not proud of
[1:42:34] it
[1:42:34] but all right we're gonna just apply the
[1:42:36] blood of jesus
[1:42:38] amen we're gonna apply the blood of
