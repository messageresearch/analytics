so he's a keeper he's a life-sustaining Amen he's our God amen our psalms reads the Lord reigneth let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved the Lord is great in Zion and he is high above all the people let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy the Kings strength also loveth judgment thou thus established equity they our executors judgment and righteousness and Jacob exactly the Lord our God and worship at his footstool for he is holy Moses and Aaron among his priests and Samuel mueng them they call upon his name they called upon the Lord and he answered them he's speaking to them in the cloudy pillar they kept his his testimony and the ordinance that he gave them now answers them Oh Lord our God that was a god that forgave us them though thou took his vengeance on their inventions exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy hill for the Lord our God is holy praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen you all may be seated we're gonna ask brother Josue to come and give a little testimony this morning about the goodness of the Lord praise the Lord [Music] god bless you all this morning I love I love testifying of the goodness of Jesus and and for some reason he provides I said he provides situations for me to testify like the brother said not too long ago he said every test and trial that we put through we look at it as a potential testimony and and that's what has happened to me he keeps on providing things to confirm the confidence that God could have in me and every single one of those things just just brings me closer to God you know I I want to I can't even think about the things that I lost but I could only think about the things that I've gained through this there's so much to say about the accident because I don't have no memory of it I guess from the hit it completely blanked out but I don't have no memory of the accident but I know who was there to protect me he gave me an opportunity to he first of all he spared my life because like I told some other other brothers if you look at the vehicle it looks like somebody died but if you look at the promises of God somebody's alive okay and he spared my life he has gave me an opportunity to be alive to live and keep on serving him which is what I'm going to do and if anything this has strengthened my walk with God because he has proven himself to me over and over and in the Bible he said that he would not leave us nor forsake us I have had the opportunity to share this testimony this testimony is in Puerto Rico it's in Mexico is in Honduras is in Colombia is in it's an United State the whole day if I would have been home I would have probably been busy with the kids doing things but I was in the hospital and I was able to share this testimony to every single person that came into my heart I shared the testimony because the Bible says to do good and to communicate forget na which Indo in those things God is well pleased so he gives us a certain situations and I believe that he does that so we can give him all the glory and show the one thing that I want to say is one of the brothers that I thought in my heart to share with what I am I said I'm gonna call brother Remy I don't know why I I said I'm gonna call brother Remy and I'm gonna share my testimony with him cuz maybe he'll share with somebody else so so there was so many other people that I was sharing with that I thought about him I just want to show you how God cares and I've give many hope testimonies the guys proved to me that he cares for you and I thought about brother Remy and there was so many so many so many people that I shared his testimony with that I completely didn't get to share with him now about 6 or 7 o'clock I get a phone call and it says brother Remy and when I saw that I was like what's brother ramiz calling me brother Remy called me and I never knew that brother Remy was brother Mike's uncle I never knew that and I am very close with brother Mike and actually the day before my accident I took brother Mike with me we were do we spend the whole day together he went to Shu with me and the things that was spoken and the things to happen and the testimony that I can give you of what happened that day the devil was not happy okay he was sitting there and he shared a testimony and brother Remy call me and he called me I said what I forgot to call him but God knew that in my heart I wanted to share the testimony with him so he cares and he show so many so many things before I always go to work with my trailer and God that morning a furrier friend of mine asked me if I can help him because he has so much where he couldn't work the day before because it was raining and I said you know what I just dropped my stuff man I'm kind of come and help you and when I was gonna leave the house I was like you know what I'm just gonna leave my trailer you know cuz God made me do that because he knew that tomorrow I'll go get another truck like my wife told me she said maybe I'm not worrying about that truck there's there's a million f-150s but there's only one horse way so God allowed me to drop my trailer off at the house so whenever this accident happened I can have a testimony and I can still go on with the things that he has built for me to keep on moving I just want to encourage you guys that the Lord is with us there is nothing that we can do but is what God did for us okay so I'm just so happy and so excited and I called the brothers yesterday and I sang a song for them because that I was singing that song in the hospital and the people must have thought that I was crazy but there was just just so you know how what God does there was a lady that came into the Moroz and when she came in she had the scrub and she looked like a sister you know so I was like she must be a sister because they you know it's probably a little uncomfortable to to wear scrub with a skirt probably for for them not for us because I'm uncomfortable with the way I live cuz when God took my stony heart out and he gave me a new heart and he pour his spirit into me what moves me something different so what I'm living I'm super exciting I delight in the ways of the Lord like David said okay so she came in and she said how are you doing I say I am rejoicing in the Lord I am I'm blessed the God spared my life and I am so I just kept talking and she just in the hospital all right so she just stayed and I didn't see her I didn't tell her oh you believe her you know you you I see I didn't tell her that I started talking to her brother and she went from taking my vitals from me to getting up and I started sharing some some things and I don't know what I was saying I don't know what I was talking about I know I got to but she told me she was a Pentecostal right and when I when I started talking to her and I don't know how I got to the to the to the baptism part and I started sharing with her and I told her that this is what Jesus said but this is not what John did okay he Peter I'm sorry this is not what Peter did it wasn't the Bible the the Bible says that the it's really jesus said that he speak spoke in parables okay and the Bible has not understood exactly by what you see but it's understood by revelation so Peter caught the revelation that God said then he said he baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit but Peter baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I told her if you go to take my MRI that they want to do and you go over there he said this MRI is for the father and it's for the son and for the cousin are they gonna give me an MRI they're not this is just what came into my mind and I'm saying I'm saying all these things and I'm like I know where I'm getting this from and when I told my wife that I was talking to her about that she's like really talking about the she don't know this I said I said relax baby I say you got prophetic lens there's something that you know that a lot of people don't know maybe his/her pastor don't know these things and I said you can don't take those things lightly the things that we know are revelations that are for the bride of distress so I started talking to her and telling her and and I showed her and she just stood there she was like I've never heard anything like I said well can we can I show you in the Bible real quick where I got this from because this is not something that I came up with I'm just I'm just repeating what it's in the Bible and I'm showing you there read them for yourself if God speaks to you then take it as that this is not something that came brother branham said that I was listening to message he said he said don't get mad at me about what I'm saying he said what I'm saying I'm not saying anything of from my thoughts I am just repeating what the Bible says if you have a problem go talk to the author okay so I just wanted to share these things because I am so excited and so joyful and so grateful that God allowed me to get into that wreck so making sure I didn't have my seatbelt on I just found out because I have a camera inside of my vehicle and for some reason God did not allow the whole accident to record but he record about about thirty seconds before the accident was recorded and I was just driving and I did not have my see because I a farm you know so that is even greater a greater miracle okay so I just want to tell you that when I think of the goodness of Jesus for me my heart cries out hallelujah and thank God for saving me pretty sure brother brother Sodom could do better than me he has done for me then my soul cries out hallelujah I thank God for saving come on hit me same when I think of the goodness of Jesus when all yet done

that are in the house of the Lord this morning this morning we have also brother Leo and sister Tatiana Blanco a man with us they are guests of brother Josue and for those we called me early this week and said brother Leo wanted to come to church and I said well yes they want to come let them come we're underneath these kovat 19 guidelines so we're kind of meeting separately the congregation is meeting separately another service will start at 12 but but you know we are just just grateful for how the Lord is just doing things even during this season during this time he is he's still moving amen in ways that go beyond our imagination as brother Simba told us and the testimony recently is the God is in the details a man and he's doing the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask a thing and and I'm and I'm just so grateful for that so I just wanted to quickly give you all an update as we we're also forgiving those of you that are online you have the opportunity to give online a man we have two ways that you can give one is through our church website and you would use PayPal for that as through the church web 12 church website or the church app if you go to the church website sww to type in a code org and underneath the home tab you'll see donations and then it gives you instructions for giving through PayPal just make sure when you're given through PayPal because PayPal does charge fees amen forgiving so when you use give to a friend or send to a friend then we don't get any fees for that and the friends email address that you'll use is giving at John four to three or giving at John 4 to 3 3 org if you're using PayPal also the church has established cash app as another form of giving for those that are online and if you have cash app you would just use the cash symbol there and our cash apps is spirit and truth tea spirit and truth tea as you can see there on the bottom of the screen so let's pray over our giving those that are inside the sanctuary you can give and we have a little box there on the table so wooden box that you would just put your offering in as you're leaving today if you put it in before you came that's perfectly fine but that's the way you would give to here today you just put it inside the box that's what they did in the Bible days and so good to see that come back around again now so if you want to give just put it in the box as you're leaving amen on today so let's just pray over our giving at this time and we'll just commit this to the Lord father we thank you you have been a waymaker amen a miracle worker a promise keeper a provider Jehovah Jireh joven Niecy you have been everything and more to us through this season and God we thank you that you have blessed us many of us to still have our jobs the Lord where we're at home is still getting paid thank you God for those that are receive stimulus checks thank you for those that receive unemployment benefits thank you God for just providing in ways that go beyond our expectations we have not lost anything but we've gained all things and Lord we just pray that as we would give that you have blessed our giving we bring our ties we bring our offering into the storehouse as you told us in your word and and God the other part that you said is that if we did it then you would rebuke the Devourer for our Savior and God we have seen you do that where Satan might have come in and one way we saw him go out another way because you rebuke the Devourer it wasn't even us but you did it on our behalf and we thank you God for for manifesting yourself in this way of God so as we bring our tithes now offering me you blessed me you use it for the furtherance of your kingdom on earth it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen praise the Lord just a couple of announcements in a man we have a birthday coming up on Tuesday sister Blanche a man Dickson we wish her a happy birthday a man on Tuesday the fifth certainly wished her a happy birthday also we have for our services we're still just monitoring as they give us you know information we're still monitoring what we're doing here so we're gonna continue forward with our virtual service on Wednesday night you'll just watch I have a periscope or through Facebook we realize that there's been a few challenges with Facebook but we are working on all of those challenges I believe we and I appreciate the brothers brother Quentin and brother praise the Lord brother Simba and you know brother Jerry and they just simply discover a problem we we on top of it trying to get it fixed so I believe the day we got something for you and and I believe everybody be blessed by so just just bear with us if you have any troubles give us some feedback and we'll continue to work on it one of the things that has happened that I want to thank God before it even before y'all notice it one of the things that we noticed the computer that we were trying to push all these streaming services through it just told us we ain't got enough resources I can't do nothing with all this so we got together and and said we got to get a compute and we got to get it now you know for the church and so the brothers looked into some things and you know and and unbeknownst to me decided that they were going to pool their money together and buy the computer for the church you know to get through some of these hurdles so I want to appreciate a man brother brother Quentin brother Jerry and by December 4 just coming up with that solution and hey man and just bless the church so it's on order and we overcoming hurdles we see a problem we stepping over the top of it praise God but I appreciate I appreciate those brothers for that so Wednesday night we'll continue to do our periscope and Facebook a man stream also on Sundays we'll continue to have our 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. service so keep that in mind as well amen those that are not able to come just join us virtually a man through periscope or through Facebook we try to give you two options so if one fails please just go right over to the other option we'll get you in also at this time I just want to take a moment just to give us an update on our we do this at the first Sunday of every month we give you an update on our building fund and God is moving God is moving so really quickly we have a drive going a building front drive we our goal was to try to raise a hundred and five thousand per year and that was the goal we had pledged on the goal people said I'll give $60,000 towards that one hundred and five thousand a man and and on that sixteen thousand spent pledge we have received twelve thousand seven hundred seventy dollars in nine cents a man prays alone glory to God a man and on that twelve thousand seven hundred seventy dollars an ounce set we have received two hundred and sixty five dollars and fifteen cent and interests on that that's positive that's positive and another big thing I love about this is that we used to tell y'all that transfers we would transfer money from my building fund actually pay our bills operating expenses but that transfer is still at zero and not only is it at zero zero we've been able to pay our operating expenses the first weekend of the month for the past few months it wasn't that way last year but every time we write that check I'm like Lord you did it again even in the midst of prove it 19 use that lets me know that amen other things that Jeff's resources but God is our source he proves himself over and over again so Fernet a man that we have this year so far that we've gained in our building fund drive thirteen thousand thirty five dollars in twenty four seven even during this period it still being positive amen we thank God for that praise the Lord a man a man you can turn those lights on there my brother I wanted to just do this special for you all this morning a man and just a little something that that I had in my heart and I think we my daughter and I practiced this some time ago but just the situation every presented itself for for me to do it and but this morning I say I'll do a special if we don't have anybody else I mention that to brother solomon let's say just put me on the list so I'm gonna do a special a man this morning brother brother who swear you did a good job on that think of the goodness of Jesus we got there we got to get my watery brother move move my man but this up this song is a song that my daughter wrote a man my daughter Rebecca here on the piano she wrote this and and and I thank God for it and you know we just want to just encourage you this is a very challenging time a man for many but as God's people we're seeing him move in ways that just go beyond our expectations I also wanted to just mention brother Jimmy has a request for prayer there was a his and his family there was a relative that announced that she had cancer stage 4 cancer and and when she announced it one of her children didn't take it very well and one of her son's I think it's a youngest son and he didn't take it very well Denis went and I believe he he killed himself so we want to pray for this family that God would just give them strength for me and a mother that's already suffering and her body and now she has to deal with you know losing our baby the baby son that is tremendous that's tremendous so we want to just remember that family in prayer let's just pray for them now while we're thinking about it father we just want to present this family today and in prayer this mother that's already sick and God God the doctors have pronounced cancer and look we know that cancers not too hard for you we know that it's Oh God right where she is we send the word of healing to her body as we heard even on last week our cancer has this it's a life got two little eyes trying to destroy the body father we come against it in the name of Jesus because you told us what we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so God we loose the healing virtue of Jesus to flow through her badi she's already going through enough in the loss of a Sun God people are dying without hope they don't realize that they could turn to you God and I just pray that you would use this as an opportunity for someone to recognize how powerful you are and Lord if their souls are not right with you Father the first healing that we'd like to take place it's the healing of the soul so father we execute move by your spirit upon even right now and lord that's brother Jimmy would come in contact and other believers in the family come in contact with his family mothers may you give them the right words to speak God that would bring peace that would bring comfort that would bring healing that would bring hope oh god as our prayer we commit this family into your hands it's in the name of Jesus that we pray amen a man and a man the song is written from ascription Psalms 46 says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling there else alive there is a river the streams where else should make glad the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early he in trouble times you go before you leave the way you come my storms I place my hope in you for Jesus

Corona he was on the other side just waiting for us to come through hey man and you know it's they're still promises in the scripture that must be fulfilled so a man we got a faith and we got a confidence that what God has spoken it will come to pass and there's nothing that can stop it amen from happening praise the Lord praise the Lord [Music] praise the Lord this song that I learned

lifted to you Lord because we we lift our hands in faith Lord to defy the laws of gravity though showing that I'll need is greater and he'll order you know what's behind the raising of the hand Lord you you know the desire and the intent behind us asking Lord the desire put our hearts father and we know that Lord all things are given and created for you and by you Lord you know we just want to be a part of that Lord a part of that creation that's here to do your will and your complete wheel and Lord we just ask father you just give you an every person here Lord their hearts desire Lord according to your will you know I bless this church Lord all those who are hearing those that may be listening father knows that's connected to this ministry Lord God just keep us under your atoning blood Lord and we always say Lord and we don't want it to get common to us but Father forgive us our sins so forgive us our trespasses Lord and even the things that we do Lord that we don't even know Lord that's a stench in your nostrils Lord Lord make us aware of those things father then we could remain blameless in your sight lon know we love you and we give you all the praise in the name of Jesus Christ a church amen amen praise the Lord this um get our Bibles and let's turn to um I want to go to Genesis chapter 17 Genesis chapter 17 and just to say you know I know we do a lot of streaming and different things but the virus hasn't slowed me down any so cameraman get ready [Laughter] God you know Genesis 17 let's just reverse one the Bible says and when Abraham was ninety ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and I will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talk with him a man saying for saying as for me behold my covenant with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations they made us go to ax the knife chapter X chapter 9 let's just pick up in verse 13 then Ananias answered lord I have heard by many of this man now how much evil he have done to the Saints at Jerusalem and here he had authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on that name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake amen what one more verse of scripture Romans the ninth chapter Romans nine it's reverse I 11 Roma's 9/11 the Bible says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth they made a lot of bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know by the grace of God today I wanna useful subject but before I give my subject I kind of want to divert our attention I want to divert the way we've been thinking you know this this is cool in nineteen you know we've been giving so much attention to this I think we forget sometimes we serve a mighty God you know it's oh I got this symptom I got that symptom what what's to do between those previous symptoms then the symptoms now to go let's refocus he made this what's going on a man I think God is trying to let us see that he's still God I believe God is calling those back who may have gone way side so I want to say to you where this restrictions lift up don't be late to church you might not have a spot hallelujah you know and for those of you may have come back in your streaming service don't be like the people of 9/11 you know once everything was over people went back to their same old life no God has allowed this for a reason [Applause] [Music] let's get into my top of the day a man the cost of being positionally placed the cost of being placed we look and we see what's going on with this with this virus and all the stuff and you know and there is a cost there is a call you know some people have lost their lives and you know and loved ones have gotten you know are seeking all these things but what's behind it what could God be doing huh oh yeah you know I'm gonna lose people and we're probably deal with this the next service but I'm one of those people who are not gonna give the devil any credit oh yeah you know if I can Church that there is a cause for you and I to be made perfect and that's what God is doing [Applause] working for you justify the accident sometimes we missed that because we're channeling in on the hurt on the pain and all these things but the cost is what's making us better God didn't tell Abraham yeah you're gonna be the father face huh but he didn't tell him hallelujah your wife is going to be burned for 25 years God didn't tell God didn't tell Sarah that you're gonna feel so bad you're gonna give your husband [Music] he perfected it solo she was gonna give her husband away but that was the cost of being positionally place that was the cost of becoming perfect hold my church look can you imagine how she felt read your Bible how she felt when she heard she said well God I know you said we would have a child she said well I'm barren she's going through all this in her mind she's going through loosing and she's thinking about the cost of how I'm going to fulfill God's Word but it ain't up to us but he still the father you know Church looking I want to read you something real quick I'm gonna try to go quick let's go to things that are to be amen you know in Jack Jack said something yesterday and I almost made that my title I want us to rethink this thing and we'll ride me my brother Quinton and we will sit down fellowship and just talking about

and let's stop giving the devil strength Satan is not the Death Angel you don't control death God does say when the devil sees the blood here I see the blood earlier she's only God who can see his own life Satan don't know who you are huh she studies you and he's curious about it so it seems you do all kind of testing trial and all that stuff and the spirit inside of you no prostitute one day will go by alabaster box no the gene cheese of God who's gonna come to know so he ain't controlling nothing listen but he and things are not to be here it just can't be still you know what cuz I am a germ of life watching germs under microscope it ain't just sitting there saying [Applause] [Applause] [Music] it's a blessing if you lost a loved one listen your purse here was pre-planned I guess you believe that everyone did you know Church that your being here just a myth or a salt everything was all planned by God [Applause] [Music] thank God I was all playing my gosh before everything by God before the foundation of the world every Church olia I had the flu by two weeks ago it was pre-planned by God see sometimes holier remember we have scripture for everything remember the Bible says even when you're bringing forth through here purge you that you bring forth more fruit I had the flu in maybe 15 years but this time I lujah God wants to show me that he's still God I didn't have no coughs I didn't have no runny nose I didn't have any the only thing I had was a fever huh thank God Holly even the flu was a representation because what did the flu cause we do you pray I don't go all right you think the devil playing that you think the devil say imma I'm gonna make him seek so he can call on Jesus I'm gonna make him sick so he can see how that God is still a hill you know church that was just the cost of me how do you be more perfected and I'm here to say huh I'm here to let you know that God's reputation remains the same I remember I was laying in my bed hallelujah and I were burning up and the only thing I can do is say by your stripes I'm here to the hospital isolate me give me some ID thanks for my mama's getting dehydrated cuz some medicine she was taking so she went to the hospital and it's head hey you got this you said no I don't [Applause] [Music] in your mouth Rick doctor came in and he said oh did I tell you to ladies later did they tell you she would like tell me what did you say you got the respect in the hospital but to her she was just another man she said look man I came here for dehydration treat me for my dehydration I ain't got no fob korolev hours she walked out of there without it where'd you lose next service but if you got a sickness that's because you planed it what cake over 19 do to us huh what could the Corolla do to you except you first except by God before the foundation of the world dogs and cats that you may see on a daily brace if they got fries God knows my number he said he had to know every flea that was that would ever be in the earth and how many times it would HIGHLY bat his eyes tight oh my you mean to tell me the free doing like this and God knows how many times the Freegal not one everyone are you worried about I can't Jason I can't smell and wash your hands [Applause] just to show you how great that is what if I whatever our house area is infested with fleas God knows how many times every flea in there infestation will bat his eyes you right here no I'll go do let me tell you what you ought to do bat your eyes that's your window devil stop talking crazy - bachelor [Music] we serve Almighty God but there is a cost to being positionally placed you know if I can like I say gonna be too much longer but Church when we look at what goes on in life sometimes we look at it like lord why me cuz you you're called to be perfect like I said about Abraham he didn't know hallelujah then he was gonna get to a place oh yeah Heatley see see see a lot of times the trial is a blessing because there things in you that you don't know they cause perfection so God let him go through something that he could feel something and that very thing was going to perfect him let me say like just when his life was on the line never again remember he had to go get a lot with 360 late-teen service they had no rifles no guns no Spears they probably had some shovels and some ranks you know some things like that but he went to fight hallelujah he went to fight he stood up he fought hallelujah he depended on his god that wasn't the same Abraham before saying Abraham wasn't willing to fight he won willing hallelujah to be persistently placed because of the costs but once God came on the scene even in church this is even when you lie that don't stop the promise of God the promise of God's Word because if I can stop God's Word you can stop you even when the serpent lied to Eve God still came and made a way of redemption so he allows things so we can see the cost oh yeah and then things that come out of you that's landing in your Christian journey Abraham was the father face and father faith in you my sister God had to go ahead and get that line out of him so you go to the next level Oh coz from there you never lied again oh yeah but you know that spirit was in a seat that spirit was in his lineage hallelujah so he he let his son go through the same thing what did he do he what was it they were afraid of the cost but they were being positionally placed if you get all the way down just for a moment holy mmm sometimes we don't realize what we have to go through to get to where God want us and let me say I just stopped looking at what you going through and something bad no Abraham was being perfected I think was being perfected now let's talk about Jacob God told Abraham that your seed is gonna be like the Stars oh yeah that there are gonna be nations you hallelujah Amen you know Jacob was a part of that promise but Jacob didn't realize the cost of fulfilling his father's promise you just you just have some urges you didn't know what it will come in from for the birthright was coming from but there was gonna be a cost nobody smiles [Applause] can you imagine hallelujah once a man wants Isaac found out earlier that his wife lied to him do you think they just sit there said what praise God we know the Lord is in control this man was a prophet he was the seen by his wife and his son so bad look at the cost Jacob mama helped him to save his brother in his daddy but there was a cost Holy Church most of us amen most of us got siblings you know I know y'all probably had a good time going out there fishing and doing everything you know brother roles are failing your mom you know just having a good time brother amen just having a good time Jacob didn't have that the cost of him being possessed the place made him lose the relationship with his brother made him lose the relationship with his father because his brother wanted to kill him so now he had to run Church they couldn't go he couldn't he couldn't be like us go in the backyard and throw the football with his brother huh the cost of him being position with him his relationship with his brother the cost of him because this is a place that was the cost but didn't stop there now he gets down the Lehman's house hallelujah Amen he see Rachel he's like oh my he goes the laymen said what I gotta do to have her what's the cost he's a seven years give me seven years that's the cost if you give me seven years notice you didn't say you can't have her that means she was already here but he had to work for so he worked seven years hard labor seven years only to get behind the veil and realize he will hear the cost a big position a place was thick of getting a woman that he didn't love but that was the cost of being position the place hallelujah so now he got two eyes more he loved him one he don't oh yeah but then look at the cost of God bringing out that nation now he has the wife who children of the nation Rachel wasn't but it was gone oh yeah bringing for perfection it was God keeping his promise oh yeah and you don't look at Rachel now Rachel's so upset honey that leader bring of kids she gives her husband hands me can you imagine how she felt I can't have no kids so I'm gonna give my wife my husband to my hands means coming forward think about it she didn't wanna give it up watch it watch it was hey guys head baby she like you gotta leave him I know I agreed to it but I changed my mind you got to go now can you imagine babies Rachel right there barren huh and she gives the hands me but what was it it was God positionally placing this word so she she God knew that there was a Levi God knew that there was a Simeon God there were different ones that were not in Rachel Rachel hallelujah kiss her hand me so let's say you wanna play like that I'll give her mine you got babies coming from everywhere but Rachel now look at the cross you got four women look like it's fighting over one man but no is God bringing forth his promise [Applause] now examine some of this about what you're going so can you see God keeping his promise yeah amen because the only two in that nation that were in Rachel were Benjamin and Joseph everybody else came from holy women then Jacob didn't love but you look at a church is like he he's got four women fighting over him but what is it hallelujah it's God positionally placing his word because he told Abraham you'll see gonna be like stars and you gonna look in the scripture where it talks about 144,000 when they come from [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Church it was all holy God positions replacing Jacob Harley yeah it's a place where you have all the kids night down in lame his house and not here to start who years to start their coming-out didn't start chicken leaving and doing all kind of stuff getting speckled cattle and all those to name it got man leave me got mad and she could feel his anger what was it that was the cost of being positioning place now Jacob Holly the place he went to feel safe now you gotta run back honey but on his way back you realize Esau is coming so now he gotta fight this way you gotta fight that way so what did the calls cause him to do fall on his knees the cost of all the things he went through caused him to have a Pannell with God patel means you make God face to face so all of his troubles brought him to a place to weigh so God face to face with God Oh trouble cause wrestle with God what about you what is your trouble causing in your life my god problem you think the devil is causing it remember God said Pharaoh I'm gonna get glorified God hardened his heart let's look at Moses a little bit I'm gonna be too much loan y'all normal bicycles well let's look at the cost Oh Josephine her husband they have a beautiful handsome little boy they named him Moses and his birth you see there's something special about him but the Greek comes out in the land and I think I promised a around two years old I know honey a degree when I kill all the meals now this woman honey you didn't see something special about her son but the cost she's got to give him up to kill him see she's flashing back she's being inspired by deliverance before huh remember delivers before people escape nor his family any arc so when you going through things you ought to be inspired by what was already we were just talking about some of us a couple weeks ago we were supposed to be in London hardly but some of y'all might not know one time they were on their way to London and Keenan Jack grounded a plane by the spoken word I mean arrogant I think it was that - I think oh she can go that trip partly but you know how they did the people say hey oh y'all too late you can't get on the plane hey say what you mean I didn't pay my money I'm deplane right there what you mean so no um y'all can't get in Jackson look here okay I gotta go minister and there gonna be a lot of people upset if y'all don't get me on that plane now you know jack jack is calm but one thing you don't do you the situation is what brings it out he'll hug Erika's gonna get into it we didn't trade our money and we get on this plane I think your mama somebody was already on the plane and you think I'm gonna let my mama go without me oh so you know what hey Jack Tina Tina I mean I keep sayin Tina Erica erica was finna get into it and Jackson honey just just just just just come on come on you see why he's backing up he started to have assault of what happened in times mess he started have assault oh yeah of what another believer did but Church he started back of it and some started to come to his mind how the voice said remember the woman in Memphis Tennessee we're not following a man we're following the voice of God Church and he says remember the woman in Memphis Tennessee so how the plane didn't close the doors they said we can't get your tickets the plane is feeling back up all these things it's all jacking and Erica head was a prayer and Jack you can tell you what the prayer was at another time but it went it's something like just Lord you know we got to go to England and I need that plane to stand still that plane ain't going no way without so you still hungry what you did for the woman in Memphis Tennessee you can do it right here with Bobby and y'all know old tape is already old tape that the Prophet spoke in West Palm Beach several times and just like I said serious Christians hallelujah in Columbia South Carolina was Weybridge deep call to the deep what you saying I've been here I've been there but I've never been to Columbia so I guess God is saving the best for last [Applause] don't mess with me you say we'll save the best for last that was Columbia South Carolina but anyway they prayed the prayer and right after you prayed the prayer huh the stewardess lady kiosk lady gets a phone call well as he prayed the prayer the plane is backing up huh next thing you know the plane is pulling back up next thing you know the dough is opening back up the next thing you know everything the kiosk lady said she couldn't do she started to do she started to get they ceased against to start getting Jesus together she started to open the door and the next thing you don't church honey what was the cost for them being late honey all God wanted to show them is how the bride is still in prison [Applause] why everybody else is on the plane everybody else see them get on the plane and their seats were sterilized [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] then nobody asked but there's a cost for us to become perfect you got to go through things but what you think about this now huh how do you get perfect trial and error the Bible says and Jesus was made perfect by the things he suffered the Lord the Lord Jesus was made perfect by the cost by the things he suffered oh yeah and we think we just gonna skip down the yellow brick road I'm right I'm in the message and don't have no trial the trial is was perfecting you oh yeah the trial is was making you who you are don't mama complain don't cry that's when you lift your hands and say thank you lord thank you lord coz you're working on me turkey you look holy Moses going down the river uglier and you think about how their mama felt Polly giving her child up and she knew that it was something special about him giving him up that's the cost giving him up honey but look how's his his sister gets anointed and she said mommy you want me to follow and see where he goes she says yes child yes child go child so she's going down a little girl going down a river fall in the basket ha yeah and you know the basket had went into territories what she was supposed to be she wasn't supposed to be there but she went looking at the bonus God gave that little girl now look at God the cost of that mother giving her child up she didn't realize how God was positioned replacing everything but look now Moses comes in - hallelujah the area where we're with Pharaoh's daughters right there bathing whatever she is and look at God remember we read everything he's be playing because God is infinite he already knows why her because the baby had to go to somebody who had a desire for a child no the baby gotta somebody who's gonna have compassion because she didn't have no children but she was longing for a baby now here comes this baby down the river honey and she receives it and she says my God has answered my prayer when it was the real God [Applause] [Applause] and then here comes Miriam oh do you want me to get one of the Hebrew mothers to come in and feel this job yes yes the cost of giving him up was her receiving him again so now Moses is nanny is his mama he's been raised by the nanny / mama and Pharaoh's mother Pharaoh's daughter don't even know who she is the woman who gave up you didn't hire to take care of them hey honey hey honey you know that you're something great about you your deliverer every day your deliverer there's something about you your deliverer - one day honey Moses told him down and fight now he didn't know the cost of what it was gonna be to become that deliverer he didn't know that one day huh so much a connection and anger was gonna rise up he was gonna see how these people getting beat honey never identify with them people before but this one day something came over him way he couldn't take it no more goes up to eat chips and pop his neck he didn't realize the cost of becoming a deliverer now oh yeah it gets out that Moses hardly next in line to the throne has killed one of his own for the Hebrew slaves now he has to run for his life but you know that was God's plan because way back there on the backside of the desert God had this special bush sitting there he had the special bush sitting back then at a point in time he was gonna call Moses name so Moses had to leave Egypt hallelujah and get in position he's God calling his name before the foundation of the world but look at all the things he had to give up Church hallelujah he couldn't have a relationship with his brother and his sister couldn't have a relationship with his mom and his daddy amen so no doubt all of us go through things but let's start looking at it for what it is I don't know about y'all but when I go through stuff I'm like saying you ain't you ain't doing nothing you ain't controlling us God got my life and sometimes you need help to get there so I'm in one day I was sitting in church you know going through something I've got all the stuff going in my mind oh I don't know that's why it's good to know your past is okay cuz he'll speak to you without you even asking him a question all right you had no meetin you ain't call him you ain't did nothing hug but his voice is connected to what you going through huh and sometimes god I give him a word just for you huh that's why you can't come here with resentment in your heart you miss your word you might stay home you might as well go listen to Joel Olsteen or somebody cuz Jack can't help you if you got resentment er he can't help you but church you look how do you Amy I was sitting in church one day and I was thinking about something I was going through and it was it was a struggle it was hard for me cuz I'm thinking [Applause] I said praise the Lord who serves over I got in my car holy I start the worship down my god is good [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the finance is a double-double oh I got in that car and I start to worship that means praise him judge me sometimes it's the word that releases you were you so caught up with the cost if you are a child of God your life is pre please stop walking around like the devil does the devil the devil ain't doing nothing God is in control [Music] hallelujah I like what you're saying this you I'm saying only got one way I can get another f-150 and you know what God could be doing he might be setting you up for three [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] something that because guy got something better stop worried about what you lost maybe position replaced I got something better [Applause] Turkey I'm coming down you know is it still you can't bring a 747 straight down that's to come downtown slow sometimes when it's cloudy so we gotta come down a little slow I can't just go straight down cuz somebody might get hurt somebody might be slinging the spirit up in here find yourself shaking don't know what's coming over you but Church I started to think about Paul oh yeah Paul didn't know the cost of being position replaced because Church he persecuted the church he did so much stuff hardly that he had to look back on and say look good idea to the place when God was calling him and eyes the Prophet didn't even want to go pray for him but then God had to step in and say let me tell you who this is when the devil saying you don't belong oh you ain't by God steps in honey and begins to testify over you that's what he did the job how do you the devil was going to afro Gosling have you considered my servant job but look at Paul Paul a night and day in the sea bit by fiber oh yeah oh my church stolen wilt throw the wall in the city all these things why hug that he might bring forth Christ but this is my goal by the grace of God to look at everything I go through just like Paul did in his eyes Paul Paul y'all know Paul was feared he was feared you know his letters and things he wrote hardly Dave play with Paul it's just like Samuel read your Bible with Samuel they say do you come in peace they knew that that prophet had God backing him up they say just one of the sisters told me one of our brother bills daughter Holly told me that earlier that when people begin to talk about her father and they Church back in them days somebody died remember but the prophet of God is in a service and the man is on the balcony and he stands up how do you resist the Providence and in what name do you do this up it'll probably say the name you don't listen about any and drops dead right there we got God you ain't got you ain't got to do nothing don't pick up the weapons don't get no scriptures no clothes no Lester let God fight you back [Applause] [Music] the cost of being positionally placed but it was God perfecting sure she yeah like I say a night and day and seeing will over five times far they strikes on bit by a snake oh yeah in the boat the boat tears up and not in the river floating in the ocean floating all that for the gospel church EDD gets to just to a grouping and get another gotten him you know um Festus he's stand before him and say Paul you've gone mad you're mad I love my people children I'd like to say that what is wrong with her she's mad yeah boy but you know church Harley they looked at Paul 56 ever learning is piling your judgment all you losing it he said no Paul say for this purpose I can't I'm going to wrong I got to go through some stuff but I'm going yeah I might get whipped I might get scarred I might even get thrown in jail but just remember bring me a coke all the stuff he went through why the cost of what he went through why did he have to go through that because in bajalia was the book of Romans so Paul had to go through something so dark and stuff but hey I'm feeling I'm feeling close hey put that last one a life story I'm a close now we think that brother Branham lives such a glorious life that man went through something he went through something I think we realized how many times he tried to commit suicide how many times he got discouraged with the people who wouldn't receive his mess y'all know one of the greatest ones one of the statements he made he said you know what I'm gonna live in the woods he's am tired of this I'm tired of this I'm going to live in the woods and when they want me to pray for somebody I come my den and in the midst of hammering that salt he see two bones and then God begins to talk to him and say if you try what you plan it you're gonna end up like that see that was a cost of being a prophet there was a cough I know brothers hallelujah who've been in his meetings and one brother told me he said you have a big meeting and the Prophet was the speaker and all these denomination people as he's even preaching everybody was blessed he said all the big preachers be walking around talking to each other he said it a prophet being a calling like this just sitting in there was a loneliness behind bringing this word that was the cost the cost of you and I getting this word in this day to become perfect even a revelation I know something I know some of you brothers deeper than me it's alright I'm good I'm good in my in my skin I like being simple I'm good but listen this was when the Prophet told he sees his father-in-law and his mother-in-law and God told him he got to go preach the Pentecostals but now he's going hallelujah uh-uh okay this is where he says he has to go to his mother-in-law and she didn't believe she can see the Pentecostals bunch of crazy people Wow fanatic people you gonna go to spirit truth can't believe a father to me right the man Christ Jesus okay see what I see look this is well I went and I had to tell her mother and that did work so good she said William she said she's your wife you may take her if you want to but said I don't want my daughter drugged out among that bunch of trash mmm trash she call the people of God what God told the property to go get the Holy Ghost trash she was calling God's move I look at the cost the Prophet loved her he said friends I found out this that what she thought was trash is the cream of the crop earlier he said that's right we know that's right and I say that with respect sent out like holy that were all the caring and screaming and carrying on like that said why don't you go on up there and be a pastor then some days he'll they'll bill you parsonage and all that now the story goes on um I'm just I'm gonna just cut it off hallelujah but story goes on from there if you read out a little bit more he said and hope did live too much longer after that that was the daughter of the woman who called God's work trashed so the Prophet it cost him to be position replaced because he loved his wife he loved his in-laws and he didn't want to go so God had to move hope out the way even move sharing roles things that were connected to her had them moving that way to get him in position ain't you glad oh yeah God put him in position now for years he never got over that but he kept preaching for years he had to be Mama and Daddy the bill appalled that was the cost of being position replaced for years hallelujah people thought he was a devil because he was seeing visions that was the cost of being positioned in place Church what about you and I here with the statement how do you feel about being perfected cuz that's what's happening your trials or tribulations hallelujah one time I was preaching about trials and being tested and I took pictures of of Lamborghinis you know the Maybach in and all these big expensive cars you know some of our dream cause I love my job well one of my dream causing the RR carnal yeah you just know I'm just telling the truth you can't carry your dream Kaiser Honda and I got one praise God and I'm grateful because God gave me that car ain't my dream my dream is that are what they call it the Gulf the phantom the dawn read up on if you ain't got no dreams you did you think but that pile of stuff look I already know I'm pretty destinated I'm like no what can I get on this side I know heaven is mine I know I got everything heaven got the offer below what kind of job can I get on this but Church I say I'll let the see that while you're being perfected don't complain because God is up to something he's doing he's doing he's working it that musicians come he's working it for our good hallelujah and don't look at me like the devil dude the devil then you know I think sometimes the devil run to God and say why do people keep lying on me why do I keep on me you know I can't do that hallelujah Church there's this let's go back here but all right real quick I want to read you one more one more cool honest the Sun in your church age if I can find it yeah I just sign in your church age it's kind of long but I think it'll be worth it amen all I got is to a man's Church what I'm preaching is life well I'm showing you how to keep the change in your pocket okay because the cause is really your blessing Oh y'all know we go to Walmart we don't want to spend that money hardly but you're blessed to get that food when you get there you go home and you cook that chicken in them greens and all that stuff I mean like man I spit on this food but when you eat that you ain't thinking about the money dollars you like boy that chicken good hallelujah thank thank you y'all forgive me I believe in enjoy church to enjoy this is real quick the Sun interchange I mean burning turkey now I want to show you that it's important for us to go to things because just like I said the maybach the are are you beam or whatever whatever the avatar all them cars are like all them very expensive cars that we would love to have had to go through a crash test that 500,000 whole yeah Maybank hanneke slam into a wall boom had to be tested so could be found worthy to put life in [Music] be worthy to perfect [Applause] you did was I get perfect they put in leather seats they put in a navigational system come on no way I'm going at all time move in the front in the back sliding off but the reason why I like the R&R because the ins it has a guarantee that it won't break down if it breaks down about your dream car the mind cannot fail my god cannot sail [Applause] nobody [Music] [Applause] [Applause] now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the mists of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he hold back the persecution not near me the chief shepherd oh yeah he does he the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation see no matter what you're going through God ain't trying to stop it he just want to let you know I'm with you I know I know that there's some people see I know that this is happening your findings I know and I'm gonna bless you I am I am NOT unmindful of your sufferings what a stumbling block this is to so many people the sufferings of God to be perfect it's some of us hardly without trial seeing greater than others don't look at it like that because you might not be able to go through what I go through and I might not be able to go through what you go through how many of you brothers are you think you could have a baby not me I'd be the first one to say now not me now thank God for being me I'm good I guarantee you if the homosexual could get a taste of that he'll change his mind I guarantee you he'd get a taste of them birthdays here change his mind did you take quick though I'll make a man guarantee you you want something he ain't ready you wanna be a woman no you don't that's right he'd be happy to have them size 11 feet he says like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they ask in Malachi 1 and 1/3 he said the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel but Malachi I have loved you save the Lord yet we say we're enhanced I loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord yeah I love Jacob and I hated Esau remember the Bible says that he loved Jacob and Esau the brothers not even haven't done any good or evil but that the purpose to election might be fulfilled oh yeah he says the burden of the word when you say he said yeah we say we're hands I loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother says the Lord yeah I love Jacob and I hated Esau and sent his mind latest mountains in his heritage ways for the dangers of the wilderness you'll see they could not figure out God's love say they saw that love meant no suffering and chase yes sir hey man nobody y'all but I know God love me cuz I didn't got will plenty of times you better not do that hallelujah y'all know you spank your child you know daddy imitating hell told you up but I was low y'all know our kids I was when I was little I used to get whippin high desert like my room but now me and my best friends oh yeah all of that made me turn out how I turned out Bible studies I didn't wanna have holy all that made me turn out the way I turned out thank God for the chastisement that was her love and God is the same way hey man let me keep going he said they couldn't figure out God's love they thought that love meeting no suffering they thought that love me hallelujah a baby with parents of care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because God have chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of truth listen to this church God's will what is that God's no like I said the blessings
