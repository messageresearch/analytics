[26:06] friend that's close to him
[26:09] young guy 18 years old
[26:12] and he had heart surgery
[26:15] a while back i guess about two years ago
[26:17] when he went into the hospital
[26:19] wednesday and uh
[26:21] having problems with this with his heart
[26:24] and they sent him home
[26:26] uh well he uh was with my my nephew and
[26:30] they were in the palm bay area
[26:32] he was feeling tired so he went by my
[26:34] brother's house and

[27:09] and she left him
[27:11] and it sort of made him bitter so i had

[42:34] uh i appreciate just appreciate our
[42:37] young sisters
[42:39] [Applause]
[42:42] cause i was just sitting there in the
[42:43] office i was just thinking
[42:45] um
[42:47] they they're they're part of a spirit of
[42:49] truth 2.0
[42:51] and um you know i was thinking
[42:56] when
[42:57] our kids got started and how young they
[43:00] were and you know and just um actually
[43:03] you know it's actually part of my story
[43:05] i started very very young as well
[43:08] i'm not sure was
[43:11] [Music]
[43:22] praise the lord
[43:26] want to get away
[43:29] [Music]
[43:33] that was good that was good classic
[43:35] brother
[43:36] [Music]
[43:38] but when i was young a teenager started
[43:41] in song leading and um
[43:43] and i remember they should say that they
[43:45] could barely see my head above the
[43:47] pulpit
[43:48] uh you know i was so young
[43:51] serving the lord
[43:52] and then uh when our kids came along
[43:54] they got started very young uh serving
[43:56] the lord
[43:58] uh and um and very very very happy with
[44:01] uh what the lord has done in their lives
[44:03] and now i'm seeing this next generation
[44:06] uh come and and starting very young
[44:08] serving the lord
[44:10] uh it means a lot when you get started
[44:12] young
[44:13] it means a lot and uh you know um we
[44:17] have uh
[44:19] sister rachel today will be her last day
[44:21] with us amen she'll be they were making
[44:24] their move to south carolina
[44:27] and we we thank god for the years of
[44:30] service
[44:32] she has
[44:33] provided
[44:35] we trust him that the lord will just
[44:36] continue to use you as you go forward
[44:39] uh
[44:40] and uh you know i'm just i know that we
[44:42] got sister rebecca also a few weeks from
[44:44] now she'll be making the same transition
[44:47] but i'm just looking at god and i want
[44:50] y'all to do me a favor i know it's kind
[44:52] of hard to do this
[44:54] with your mask on i know it's kind of
[44:56] hard to to do this but i want you to
[44:59] just
[45:00] take a deep
[45:02] breath then let it hold out
[45:06] somebody told me something that has
[45:09] blessed me they say the church is a
[45:10] living organism
[45:13] and being a living organism we
[45:15] [Music]
[45:16] uh inhale
[45:19] and then we
[45:21] exhale
[45:22] and then we
[45:24] inhale
[45:26] and then we
[45:27] exhale
[45:29] and and when you're doing that you don't
[45:30] realize every time you do that you are
[45:34] it shows that you're living
[45:35] so inhale you begin to bring people in
[45:38] and bring them up
[45:40] exhale you have to let them go
[45:43] but we're a living
[45:44] organism we still inhale
[45:48] and we exhale
[45:52] god is control of every breath
[45:54] so church i want to tell you to do
[45:56] something
[45:57] breathe
[45:59] just breathe
[45:59] [Music]
[46:02] just breathe
[46:05] [Music]
[46:05] [Applause]
[46:07] just breathe
[46:08] [Music]
[46:10] now we thank the lord so uh i got a
[46:13] couple things that i need to do here
[46:14] today
[46:15] and uh i don't want to keep you standing
[46:18] too long so just turn in your bibles
[46:20] uh with me
[46:22] i'm going to read a scripture
[46:24] and then uh i need to just make a few
[46:27] comments before i actually get into the
[46:29] sermon
[46:30] uh genesis 50.
[46:32] oh musicians thank y'all thank y'all so
[46:34] much appreciate y'all
[46:36] amen i um i was very pleased with just
[46:40] how the saints began to enter into the
[46:41] worship before the song leader
[46:44] came up this morning that sets
[46:45] atmospheres
[46:47] amen this makes it real easy so god
[46:50] bless you all
[46:51] uh here in genesis 15
[46:55] uh verse
[46:56] 19
[46:57] uh it says this and joseph said unto
[47:01] them
[47:03] fear not
[47:05] for
[47:06] uh am i in the place of god
[47:10] but as for you he thought evil against
[47:12] me
[47:14] but god meant it unto good
[47:17] to bring to pass as it is this day to
[47:19] save much people alive
[47:22] uh now therefore fear you not
[47:25] i will nourish you and your little ones
[47:28] and they confident them
[47:30] and speak kindly
[47:32] unto them
[47:33] amen let's have a word of prayer
[47:37] lord jesus
[47:38] we are um
[47:40] grateful for the
[47:43] opportunity to read the word but god we
[47:46] know
[47:47] it takes
[47:48] the holy ghost to bring
[47:51] understanding and quickening to
[47:54] what is read
[47:56] lord help us to apply what we have read
[47:58] here realize that it's not just
[48:01] the story of joseph but it's our stories
[48:04] and so god help us lord and uh to apply
[48:07] this and
[48:08] uh lord as uh just appreciate everything
[48:10] that has happened thus far in the
[48:12] service and god want to take a moment
[48:15] to uh express our appreciation for
[48:19] a precious sister rachel lord as well as
[48:22] brother stephen and god with them making
[48:24] a transition to south carolina we ask
[48:26] that you would go before them that you
[48:28] would bless all that they set their
[48:30] hands to do
[48:32] and as she is served so faithfully here
[48:35] in this church god may you continue to
[48:38] use her for your glory
[48:39] uh as she goes forth there to brother
[48:41] armstrong's assembly uh user god in a
[48:44] very special way may they be both an
[48:46] encouragement and a strength more to
[48:49] that congregation god we just commit
[48:51] them into your hands and lord we just
[48:53] want to ask that you would just continue
[48:56] to take control of this portion of the
[48:57] service and uh we felt your presence and
[49:00] all the rest of it but now god we need
[49:02] you to go forth and i'll just make the
[49:05] word clear to us on today father it's in
[49:07] jesus name we pray amen
[49:11] amen god bless you
[49:13] you can be
[49:14] seated in the presence of the lord
[49:18] this
[49:20] quote that i want to read amen this
[49:23] first quote is really more of a
[49:26] to deal with modern events
[49:28] and um i'm i'm preaching
[49:31] a man a different i'm preaching a sermon
[49:34] that i've been telling you all
[49:36] that i want to preach
[49:38] my title today is hurt people
[49:41] hurt people
[49:43] amen
[49:44] uh but before i get started in that i
[49:47] just needed to bring a modern event you
[49:50] all are very aware of this war that is
[49:53] taking place
[49:54] uh in the ukraine
[49:56] and um this i'm setting up a quote from
[49:59] the angel the lord uh just a statement
[50:02] that the prophet is making here um
[50:05] and there there are a number of things
[50:06] that could be triggering you know this
[50:09] you you hear so much in the news you
[50:10] don't know what to believe and what not
[50:12] to believe and and all of that
[50:15] uh but
[50:16] um you know that there's a a lot
[50:19] happening sanctions and and and and all
[50:21] these things and uh and there's so many
[50:24] prophecies out there about watch russia
[50:26] watch russia watch russia
[50:29] um you know i believe i believe brother
[50:31] branham even said that
[50:32] they might be the ones that set a senate
[50:34] bomb in a hit fourth
[50:37] street in louisville
[50:38] something like that you know real close
[50:40] to jeffersonville uh but you know he
[50:43] also talked about russia using a bomb to
[50:45] hit to strike the vatican
[50:47] uh so you know there's a lot here that
[50:50] we have to be mindful of and the one
[50:54] thing that that i believe is that before
[50:57] i get too bad
[50:59] i i believe that there's a rapture
[51:03] awaiting the church
[51:05] and uh and and my encouragement to you
[51:07] all this morning is like hey uh it might
[51:09] be closer than we think
[51:11] so let's live lives
[51:13] amen a daily
[51:16] that what that god would be pleased with
[51:19] right live lives daily because you just
[51:21] don't know when this thing is going to
[51:23] turn
[51:24] right uh the people there in ukraine had
[51:26] no no idea they would wake up or go to
[51:28] bed one night and bombs just
[51:30] landing all over the place they had no
[51:32] idea that would happen your world can
[51:34] change just like that
[51:36] so you need to be prepared spiritually
[51:40] don't take our coming to church amen uh
[51:42] just as a routine
[51:44] but we're here to get a checkup
[51:47] we're here to we're here to make
[51:49] corrections where we need to make
[51:50] corrections we're here to get
[51:52] instruction from god we're here to amend
[51:54] it here with a spiritual ear
[51:57] amen so that we can be prepared for the
[51:59] hour which we live
[52:00] so i wanted to just read this this quote
[52:03] here uh from uh the prophet out of the
[52:05] angel of the lord uh he says here the
[52:08] word of the little lamb that rose up in
[52:12] revelation 13.
[52:14] uh
[52:15] a lamb too little probably a little horn
[52:18] civil and ecclesiastical power
[52:21] but after is a lamb freedom of religion
[52:24] and so forth but after a while he spake
[52:27] like a beast
[52:28] a man like like the dragon now now now
[52:33] revelation 13 actually types the united
[52:36] states this is where brother branham
[52:38] places the united states so you know
[52:39] they spake like a um
[52:42] uh they first now notice that it came
[52:44] here for freedom of religion
[52:46] they came here for freedom of religion
[52:49] but i want you to know that things are
[52:51] turning really quickly
[52:52] where your religion or your faith is
[52:54] going to be challenged
[52:57] hallelujah amen she says but after a
[53:00] while he spake like a beast
[53:02] like the dragon and exercise all the
[53:04] power the dragon did before him
[53:08] a bitter
[53:09] religious
[53:11] persecution
[53:13] now watch these statements that the
[53:14] prophet is making uh because as as we go
[53:17] deeper in this quote go back to this
[53:19] thought of bitter
[53:21] religious persecution he says we're
[53:23] nearing that time he says you remember
[53:26] church that you're living
[53:28] in the best day
[53:30] my god that you'll ever that you you
[53:33] will ever live in right now until jesus
[53:36] comes he says it shall gradually says
[53:40] not gradually but rapidly
[53:44] my
[53:45] rapidly get worse and worse
[53:48] and when russia goes down there to get
[53:51] that oil look out
[53:53] now uh you gotta understand there's a
[53:56] pipeline that flows through ukraine
[53:58] that has oil going in and and and
[54:01] everything like that so russia
[54:02] understands what's behind all this right
[54:05] so so so we know that there's uh you
[54:07] know there there's there's a political
[54:09] agenda there's a financial agenda and
[54:12] one of one of the main sanctions that
[54:13] has happened is that they come against
[54:15] of the money they won't allow them to
[54:17] trade money right so so they're trying
[54:19] to the economy we got to watch
[54:21] these things this is very very important
[54:24] but but notice what he says here now he
[54:26] says um when russia goes down there to
[54:29] get that oil look out
[54:31] he says that's all she needs that's what
[54:34] the prophet said it would do and we're
[54:36] ready for it then so church get ready to
[54:39] meet christ
[54:41] hallelujah he's sending great revivals
[54:44] and meetings and stirring the full
[54:45] gospel people signs and wonders
[54:47] appearing everywhere great wonders to
[54:50] draw his people together and one day he
[54:51] shall come the deliverer now notice you
[54:54] know before he said
[54:56] amen when russia goes down to get that
[54:59] oil look out before he said it he said a
[55:01] bitter
[55:03] religious
[55:04] persecution
[55:06] you know and i was reading an article
[55:08] this week and you know someone had made
[55:10] a statement
[55:11] a man
[55:12] they just posted it on social media it
[55:15] was a another country i believe i
[55:17] believe was in
[55:19] i know it's one of your uh accomplishers
[55:21] in your i finished i think it's a
[55:23] finished finished person that's in
[55:25] politics and she posted a scripture
[55:28] and um and then i think there was
[55:30] another bishop you know that came in and
[55:32] kind of echoed some sentiments on the
[55:34] scripture and and i think the scripture
[55:36] said something it was it was it was
[55:38] against uh alternative lifestyle
[55:41] and all they did was just post scripture
[55:43] and um you know and from that lady
[55:45] posting that scripture they want to
[55:47] bring her to court and try to try to get
[55:50] her uh sentence for two years
[55:52] for posting a scripture
[55:54] right and uh you know here you know when
[55:56] brother branham say a bit of persecution
[55:59] against religion these are a bitter
[56:01] religious persecution these are things
[56:03] that if this stuff gets passed over
[56:06] there
[56:07] quickly we will start rapidly is what he
[56:10] said we'll start seeing these things
[56:11] come our way and where should we be
[56:13] spiritually
[56:15] amen as we see these things approaching
[56:17] so church that's why i want to encourage
[56:19] you amen don't just take these things
[56:21] lightly a prophet spoke this to us and
[56:24] what we need at this very moment is to
[56:26] draw closer and closer to christ
[56:30] everything else just don't matter amen
[56:33] but we want to get closer and closer to
[56:35] christ there was a song that used to say
[56:37] only what you do for christ will last
[56:40] amen only what you do for him will be
[56:42] counted in the end only what we do for
[56:45] christ
[56:46] will last let's draw closer
[56:50] closer closer closer
[56:52] to the lord
[56:53] just dropping that off and amen i want
[56:56] to just turn our corner here
[57:00] because uh this has been in my heart for
[57:02] some time
[57:04] um
[57:05] and i felt to you know just
[57:07] bring it up and even i was i think i
[57:09] told you before a couple weeks ago that
[57:10] i was going to preach this and then
[57:12] brother brother danny came and started
[57:14] hitting some things even when as he took
[57:16] his his subject last week he took us
[57:18] through luke chapter
[57:20] 4 and showed how when jesus stood up in
[57:22] the temple and says this date of
[57:24] scripture is fulfilled it showed how the
[57:26] people got mad
[57:28] how the people got angry you know with
[57:30] the word the revealed words standing in
[57:32] their presence and we're finding the
[57:34] same thing today people are angry with
[57:36] the revealed word people are mad with
[57:39] the revealed word uh but but what i what
[57:42] i what i've kind of you know come to
[57:43] conclude amen is that a lot of the
[57:46] people that are that are doing this are
[57:48] what i consider
[57:50] hurt people
[57:52] amen glory to god and and and if you
[57:55] just had the opportunity sometimes just
[57:56] to sit and talk with folk amen you'll
[57:59] realize that that they're hurting oh
[58:01] glory to god
[58:03] even you know brother solomon was
[58:04] sharing a little uh testimony about a
[58:06] brother that used to preach the gospel
[58:08] got hurt ministers
[58:10] can be hurt
[58:12] and ministers can be hurt right i mean
[58:14] the people in the congregation can be
[58:16] hurt you know we uh uh uh
[58:19] you go through your neighborhood you go
[58:21] to school you go to work wherever you go
[58:22] you are surrounded by people that are
[58:24] hurting
[58:26] and and the the the difficult part here
[58:29] is that hurt people
[58:30] will actually
[58:32] hurt people
[58:33] amen you don't want to be one of those
[58:35] kind of people and then let me let me
[58:37] let me also just kind of uh uh uh
[58:40] mention this way all of us in here
[58:43] have been hurt by something
[58:45] everybody in here there's not one one
[58:48] person within the sound of my voice that
[58:50] has not been hurt it's what you do with
[58:52] the hurt
[58:55] see that that i mean because all of us
[58:56] get hurt somewhere and life is full of
[58:59] hurts
[59:00] life is full of disappointments right
[59:02] you can't stop life from happening but
[59:05] it's how you respond to her
[59:09] now this definition that i want to use
[59:12] i'm using a lot of um material here from
[59:14] the internet uh the definition of hurt
[59:16] people uh says people who have been hurt
[59:19] or damaged in life sometimes respond
[59:22] by striking out and hurting the people
[59:25] who are around them this is what it
[59:26] means when we say hurt people hurt
[59:29] people people who are who have been hurt
[59:31] or damaged in life sometimes respond by
[59:35] striking out and hurting the people who
[59:37] are around them now i want to another
[59:39] little article that uh that i was um
[59:42] reading because uh you know we all we
[59:45] all we all deal with it uh i've said as
[59:47] brother brother solomon talked about the
[59:48] brother used to preach the gospel and
[59:50] you know and and
[59:51] that's family hurt that he's having that
[59:53] that's family hurt you know his wife
[59:55] this his wife that that's family hurt we
[59:57] all have this type of stuff but it take
[59:59] the grace of god to carry us through
[1:00:00] this right uh this is a article that was
[1:00:03] that i was reading a man on a wife that
[1:00:06] constantly belittled her husband
[1:00:09] amen constantly every time he did
[1:00:11] something she was there to belittle him
[1:00:13] now this don't just happen it's just an
[1:00:14] article i happen to be reading about the
[1:00:16] wife doing that but i know husbands do
[1:00:18] the same thing my the wife tried to do
[1:00:20] this and the husband right there trying
[1:00:22] to belittle her
[1:00:23] amen it's a true thing
[1:00:25] i know we're going to get close to home
[1:00:27] in this sermon
[1:00:28] glory to god we might as well preach it
[1:00:30] anyway
[1:00:31] hey
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:35] hallelujah but but this is what happens
[1:00:38] and and what i'm trying to what i'm
[1:00:39] trying to get you to see when you see
[1:00:41] patterns like that
[1:00:43] amen oftentimes you might not realize
[1:00:45] but there's a hurt on the inside that
[1:00:47] that person has never never overcome
[1:00:50] and this is why they keep acting the way
[1:00:52] that they act
[1:00:53] oh glory to god you know just just
[1:00:56] recently somebody gave me a telephone
[1:00:58] call and and they were just telling me
[1:01:00] how um you know they just couldn't take
[1:01:02] it anymore they ready to to go on with
[1:01:04] their life and get out of the marriage
[1:01:06] and and all these things and i say oh my
[1:01:08] my my and by the time i hear it
[1:01:11] the person already made up their mind
[1:01:14] so i'm sitting there praying you know
[1:01:16] why i'm talking to him like lord give me
[1:01:18] something that i can say but they don't
[1:01:20] make everybody well she won't do this
[1:01:21] and she won't do that and she won't do
[1:01:23] this well now this now when you uh when
[1:01:25] you was living such and such did she do
[1:01:27] those things no she didn't do it didn't
[1:01:29] either i said well wait if she do it
[1:01:31] then she ain't doing that ain't nothing
[1:01:32] change
[1:01:35] ain't nothing really change you know
[1:01:36] just let's just wait before you just
[1:01:38] throw in the towel i say now now what we
[1:01:40] need to do is go back and just honor god
[1:01:42] amen see what god's word say about these
[1:01:45] things and honor god in his word and
[1:01:47] watch god turn that thing around
[1:01:50] hallelujah i say the reason that she
[1:01:52] might not do the things that
[1:01:55] she you know you say she should do like
[1:01:56] you know let me just give an example
[1:01:59] maybe a husband is upset that his wife
[1:02:00] don't cook
[1:02:04] now see if you recorded her the right
[1:02:06] way
[1:02:07] you would have been able to take some of
[1:02:08] her food before you married her
[1:02:15] but you rushed it
[1:02:17] i know i'm talking
[1:02:20] you rushed it and you never did go over
[1:02:22] and get no food
[1:02:26] praise the lord
[1:02:28] right you rushed that thing and now now
[1:02:30] you're not married and now you now you
[1:02:32] now you you in this now
[1:02:34] right but but maybe if you would have
[1:02:36] had a chance to kind of corner and do
[1:02:38] some things you would have found out
[1:02:40] that maybe the reason she don't cook
[1:02:42] is that she might have tried to cook
[1:02:45] but when she tried to cook maybe she
[1:02:47] burnt something the first time and maybe
[1:02:49] something was sad in the house about her
[1:02:52] mama about her daddy that crushed her
[1:02:54] spirit
[1:02:58] it crushed her spirit and now she don't
[1:03:01] want to cook
[1:03:02] but you didn't get it you didn't get a
[1:03:04] chance to actually minister to her
[1:03:06] because what you need to do is find out
[1:03:07] what she can cook good and encourage her
[1:03:10] in that
[1:03:11] baby every time you cook this i just
[1:03:14] enjoy it and sometimes why's you got to
[1:03:18] find an area about your husband that's
[1:03:20] really going to keep echoing that
[1:03:23] come on somebody
[1:03:25] but but because what happened is that
[1:03:27] she got hurt
[1:03:29] in a family and now she takes that into
[1:03:31] her marriage and hurt people
[1:03:38] hurt people begin to hurt people
[1:03:47] we have to be able to dig deeper
[1:03:50] into situations and circumstances
[1:03:53] you know watch why you have to you know
[1:03:55] you got to be spiritual
[1:03:58] because uh sometimes you can just see
[1:04:00] you know and
[1:04:01] and as a husband you got to be able to
[1:04:03] minister to his wife
[1:04:04] in areas that she might be hurting that
[1:04:06] she's never even said anything to
[1:04:08] anybody about
[1:04:10] maybe embarrassed to say something about
[1:04:11] it uh uh wise you got to do the same
[1:04:14] thing with your husband you got to find
[1:04:15] a way to minister to him
[1:04:17] because he maybe he's embarrassed
[1:04:21] glory to god you don't know what what
[1:04:23] has created the psyche in a person
[1:04:27] but hurt people begin to hurt people
[1:04:31] and it becomes an endless cycle
[1:04:35] so this this this article that i was
[1:04:37] reading on this wife who kept i mean
[1:04:40] every time the husband did something she
[1:04:41] was belittling her husband
[1:04:44] i always find a way to put him down
[1:04:46] saying every time i get a promotion on
[1:04:47] the job she got something negative to
[1:04:49] say
[1:04:52] and and and the person was responding
[1:04:54] because he's he sent a a question and
[1:04:56] and i guess this this person was
[1:04:57] responding to this question hurt people
[1:04:59] hurt others
[1:05:01] hurt people tend to interpret words and
[1:05:03] behaviors personally
[1:05:05] and tend to think of themselves as
[1:05:07] victims
[1:05:08] who have been treated unfairly
[1:05:11] hurt people always see themselves
[1:05:14] as victims
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] it's because of this it's because of
[1:05:22] that
[1:05:23] and this happened
[1:05:25] and that happened no no no no at some
[1:05:27] point in time you got to stop being a
[1:05:29] victim
[1:05:30] and you got to be a victor
[1:05:35] i said it earlier i said again everybody
[1:05:37] in here has been hurt
[1:05:39] it's how we respond to it
[1:05:42] you know the prophet saying the right
[1:05:43] mental attitude
[1:05:45] towards any divine promise will bring it
[1:05:47] to pass so often times when you face
[1:05:49] saying anything in life you got to have
[1:05:51] a right attitude
[1:05:54] and i'm going to tell you what a right
[1:05:55] attitude is in the attitude of gratitude
[1:06:03] hurt people hurt others hurt people tend
[1:06:05] to interpret words and behaviors
[1:06:08] personally and tend to think of
[1:06:09] themselves as victims who have been
[1:06:11] treated unfairly
[1:06:13] hurt people tend to mistreat or act
[1:06:15] harshly towards others especially those
[1:06:19] close to them
[1:06:21] because those are the people they feel
[1:06:22] the safest
[1:06:24] and most secure around they have trouble
[1:06:27] tolerating virtually any type of
[1:06:30] emotional injury they have trouble
[1:06:33] tolerating any type of emotional slight
[1:06:35] or insult or or threat without feeling
[1:06:38] the need to forcefully retaliate
[1:06:41] which means that they perpetually
[1:06:44] they are perpetually
[1:06:46] at war with someone most of the time
[1:06:50] hurt people
[1:06:52] hurt people
[1:06:55] sometimes we're hurt by our friends
[1:06:57] sometimes we're hurt by co-workers
[1:07:00] sometimes we're hurt by classmates
[1:07:02] amen it happens in life you just can't
[1:07:05] you can't stop it you know uh uh you
[1:07:07] know i was one of the things as i was
[1:07:09] just kind of pondering on this you know
[1:07:11] there's a lot going on in the world and
[1:07:12] i'm a i'm gonna just be honest i think
[1:07:14] i'm gonna have a two-part series on this
[1:07:16] because i i was putting all my notes
[1:07:18] together i said lord ain't no way i just
[1:07:20] i'm trying to just doctor this up a
[1:07:22] certain way but i'm gonna just have to
[1:07:23] just let it let it fly
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:27] but um one of the things that kind of
[1:07:29] grabbed my attention
[1:07:31] is all the riots
[1:07:34] that that that happened in our in our
[1:07:36] country
[1:07:37] and how you see different people even
[1:07:39] believers
[1:07:40] sad to say this but believers taking
[1:07:43] sides with one or the other
[1:07:45] right and and
[1:07:47] and you know and and i mean i understand
[1:07:49] police brutality uh and not it's not
[1:07:52] right i don't i don't believe that to be
[1:07:54] right but i don't believe it right for
[1:07:55] some of the things that the other guys
[1:07:56] do either
[1:07:57] amen right but but you know we got we
[1:07:59] got um sometimes it's human error
[1:08:05] but but a human error amen will be
[1:08:08] categorized as police brutality
[1:08:10] and as soon as somebody put that on it
[1:08:13] and you just let it be two different
[1:08:14] races
[1:08:16] oh my hear that devil that devil that
[1:08:18] that that was defeated years ago hear
[1:08:20] that devil come right back up again
[1:08:23] and next thing was brought right into
[1:08:25] the church
[1:08:27] and you don't realize that hurt people
[1:08:29] are still hurting people
[1:08:32] the responses are our responses from
[1:08:34] hurt people they see themselves as
[1:08:36] victims all the time
[1:08:42] oh my my mind
[1:08:44] at some point in time you got to stop
[1:08:46] looking at yourself like that
[1:08:48] i'ma tell you a victim always
[1:08:50] responds in a certain way and then they
[1:08:54] justify their actions because they feel
[1:08:56] like they're victims
[1:08:59] no this is a hurt person
[1:09:01] this is a hurt person
[1:09:05] let me uh
[1:09:07] move on there's
[1:09:08] family hurt
[1:09:10] a mother that
[1:09:12] maybe didn't receive love when she was a
[1:09:15] child
[1:09:16] she might have difficulty expressing
[1:09:18] love to her own children
[1:09:21] and then then the kids grew up my mama
[1:09:24] didn't do this by moment but she don't
[1:09:25] understand your mama didn't have the
[1:09:27] tools
[1:09:29] that she needed in order to be what you
[1:09:31] wanted her to be
[1:09:33] and can i tell you go a little further
[1:09:35] you already have in your mind
[1:09:37] what a mama's supposed to be
[1:09:40] you don't create it in your mind what a
[1:09:42] dad is so supposed to be and you're not
[1:09:45] a mama
[1:09:46] nor daddy
[1:09:49] so you don't understand what what goes
[1:09:51] on and the responsibility that goes with
[1:09:54] that and the decisions that have to be
[1:09:55] made sometime
[1:09:57] come on somebody
[1:09:59] right but but you gotta understand that
[1:10:00] look look look uh god is the one that
[1:10:03] chose the family that you would arrive
[1:10:05] here through
[1:10:06] you didn't make the choice
[1:10:08] god made the choice and he put you in an
[1:10:10] environment and yes in that environment
[1:10:12] you were going to experience some hurt
[1:10:16] but it's how you respond
[1:10:22] you can't blame mama
[1:10:24] see sometimes what it is is that god's
[1:10:27] trying to get you to see your mama is
[1:10:28] not your all all-in-all
[1:10:31] and your daddy is not your all-in-all
[1:10:34] but i'll be he said i'll be all that you
[1:10:36] need
[1:10:37] you need a mama i be your mama
[1:10:40] you need a daddy i'll be your daddy you
[1:10:42] need a brother i'll be your brother you
[1:10:44] need a sister i'll be your sister
[1:10:46] whatever you need i can be all that and
[1:10:48] more
[1:10:54] young man who did not have a father
[1:10:56] growing up
[1:10:58] will have a difficult time
[1:11:00] being a father when it becomes his turn
[1:11:05] he didn't have a father he didn't have
[1:11:07] an example he didn't have that and
[1:11:09] oftentimes what we want to say well the
[1:11:10] word of god gives us a you know we we we
[1:11:13] it's very it's very um
[1:11:16] easy to use things like that but if
[1:11:18] you're going to use that you have to
[1:11:19] also turn that that certain that same
[1:11:21] sword back to you
[1:11:24] because when you start complaining about
[1:11:25] this person not doing that next thing
[1:11:27] you're just gonna find some scripture as
[1:11:28] to why you shouldn't be doing what
[1:11:29] you're doing see we gotta we gotta
[1:11:31] understand the scriptures say um
[1:11:33] uh uh uh uh you worried about getting
[1:11:36] amen the moat
[1:11:38] out of somebody else's eye it's just a
[1:11:40] little splinter
[1:11:41] but you got a huge bean
[1:11:44] two by four
[1:11:46] four by four sticking out your eye and
[1:11:48] you ain't doing nothing about it
[1:11:51] hallelujah what we need to do is just
[1:11:53] concentrate on us
[1:11:59] sometimes people are hurt just by life
[1:12:02] untimely or unexpected death of a loved
[1:12:05] one
[1:12:06] sometimes a a a a family losing a child
[1:12:10] amen these are things that hurt and and
[1:12:13] oftentimes uh some people can't recover
[1:12:15] they were serving god and you know and
[1:12:17] then they go through something real
[1:12:19] difficult in life or not now they talk
[1:12:20] about giving up on god and and they say
[1:12:22] well if if if this was the you know uh
[1:12:25] if god loved me he would not allow these
[1:12:27] things to happen to me
[1:12:28] you know i remind i reminded of brother
[1:12:30] brand i'm going through this as a as as
[1:12:33] a as a husband as a father
[1:12:36] i mean in his early age early stage of
[1:12:38] ministry here uh uh a flood comes and
[1:12:42] you know he's just doing everything he
[1:12:43] can to try to help everybody else and
[1:12:45] while he's helping everybody else his
[1:12:47] wife is in the hospital sick and dying
[1:12:50] with his baby now you got to think about
[1:12:52] this you know
[1:12:53] this is before he started out on the
[1:12:55] field he's going through you talk about
[1:12:57] hurt
[1:12:58] oh yeah he was hurt
[1:13:00] i mean in there trying to take care of
[1:13:01] everybody else now my my wife is leaving
[1:13:04] and then within within days his baby is
[1:13:07] gone
[1:13:09] right i mean what what could he do he
[1:13:10] said brother branham said his baby died
[1:13:13] um
[1:13:14] so so bad it was just so hard that her
[1:13:16] eyes crossed while she was dying
[1:13:20] and and from that experience
[1:13:23] from that experience of him seeing amen
[1:13:26] his baby's eyes crossed amen god gave
[1:13:29] him a sensitive nature
[1:13:32] that when he saw other people with cross
[1:13:34] side sometimes the prophet didn't even
[1:13:36] have to pray for him
[1:13:40] the prophet would just look at a person
[1:13:42] with cross eyes
[1:13:44] and their eyes were straightened up he
[1:13:45] had all he had he was able to identify
[1:13:48] with what that person was going through
[1:13:50] based on what he saw his baby go through
[1:13:52] let me tell you something god wanna use
[1:13:54] your hurt
[1:13:56] for his glory
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:04] here
[1:14:06] he lost his baby
[1:14:07] lost his wife all in a matter of days
[1:14:11] and i hear he's trying to take everybody
[1:14:12] but you know during that time
[1:14:14] uh somebody come along and they asked
[1:14:16] him a question they uh
[1:14:17] said brother branham
[1:14:19] did you hold on to god
[1:14:22] while you was going through that you
[1:14:23] know you lost this you lost that did you
[1:14:25] hold on to god why you was going through
[1:14:26] all that brother random you know told
[1:14:29] saying no because she a hurt person
[1:14:31] ready to give up
[1:14:33] i mean and there was many times brother
[1:14:35] branham tried to kill himself
[1:14:37] brother branham fought the spirit of
[1:14:39] suicide
[1:14:43] the prophet did
[1:14:45] hurt people go through things like this
[1:14:48] hallelujah but but i'm so glad that he
[1:14:50] actually told us about these things that
[1:14:52] he was going through as a human being
[1:14:54] but we see how god used that for his
[1:14:56] glory
[1:14:58] so yeah i tried i tried to say did you
[1:15:00] did you hold on to god during those
[1:15:02] times say
[1:15:04] i'll be honest i ain't hold on to him
[1:15:08] hey buddy held on to me
[1:15:11] and and that's that's the good thing
[1:15:13] about it that he's holding on to us
[1:15:17] hey when it don't feel like he's working
[1:15:21] he's working when it don't seem like
[1:15:23] he's working
[1:15:25] he's working
[1:15:34] oh
[1:15:36] jesus there's a statement here when we
[1:15:39] when we're dealing with hurt people
[1:15:42] the statement here
[1:15:44] we're not here to criticize anybody
[1:15:46] because hurt is something that all of us
[1:15:49] have to endure
[1:15:51] in the family
[1:15:53] hurting the church
[1:15:55] and and i won't have i don't think i'm
[1:15:57] gonna have time to get to maybe i will
[1:16:00] maybe i will
[1:16:02] let's let's read a story
[1:16:06] this is hurting the church
[1:16:07] my notes are all over the place
[1:16:11] but um i think it'll be helpful for us
[1:16:14] so let's let's read the story go go with
[1:16:16] me to
[1:16:19] first kings chapter three
[1:16:26] hurt people
[1:16:28] hurt people
[1:16:33] first kings chapter 3.
[1:16:40] i want to start at verse 16.
[1:16:46] now this story amen it's not really
[1:16:49] don't have the word church in it but we
[1:16:50] have to
[1:16:52] um
[1:16:54] type it to the church
[1:16:56] because oftentimes when we see women in
[1:16:58] the bible
[1:16:59] uh women are representing the church
[1:17:02] so
[1:17:04] here
[1:17:05] the bible says then came there
[1:17:07] two women
[1:17:09] that were harlots
[1:17:11] unto the king and stood before him
[1:17:16] and the one woman said oh my lord
[1:17:20] i and this woman
[1:17:22] dwell in one house
[1:17:26] and i was delivered of a child
[1:17:28] with her in the house
[1:17:31] and it came to pass
[1:17:34] the third day after that i was delivered
[1:17:36] that this woman
[1:17:38] was delivered also
[1:17:40] and we were together
[1:17:41] there was no stranger with us in the
[1:17:44] house
[1:17:45] save we too
[1:17:46] in the house so let's get this
[1:17:49] let's let's try to follow this
[1:17:51] these ladies
[1:17:53] were of the same profession
[1:17:56] they had the same job they were
[1:17:58] co-workers
[1:18:00] can i put it that way is that all right
[1:18:03] these ladies are co-workers sometimes
[1:18:04] your co-workers can cause you some
[1:18:10] some hurt
[1:18:11] not only are they co-workers
[1:18:14] what we find in just these few versus
[1:18:16] scriptures these women are roommates
[1:18:22] they're roommates and sometimes you know
[1:18:24] we've had that happen where you know
[1:18:25] you've been hurt by a roommate
[1:18:29] come on somebody
[1:18:30] right but but the bible says that they
[1:18:32] lived in the same house and the other
[1:18:34] thing we found out that both of them
[1:18:35] were pregnant at the same time
[1:18:40] now look at this they're telling a story
[1:18:45] verse 19 it says and and this woman's
[1:18:48] child died
[1:18:49] in the night
[1:18:51] because she overlaid it
[1:18:53] she smothered on child
[1:18:55] says and she and she arose at midnight
[1:18:59] and took my son from beside me
[1:19:02] while my handmaid slept and laid it in
[1:19:05] her bosom
[1:19:06] and laid her dead child
[1:19:08] in my bosom
[1:19:10] now you know this just it's just really
[1:19:12] really something to me because you know
[1:19:14] um
[1:19:15] that only reason that this lady could
[1:19:16] even think to do something like this
[1:19:19] is because maybe at the early stage the
[1:19:23] children looked so much alike
[1:19:26] they had to be a man
[1:19:28] of uh
[1:19:30] you know just just uh i mean they had to
[1:19:32] be so similar it's no way that if these
[1:19:35] was two different colored babies
[1:19:38] that this mama would even think to do
[1:19:40] now i know she ain't gonna go for that
[1:19:45] amen one baby yelling one black and i
[1:19:48] know that ain't gone i know she ain't
[1:19:50] gonna go for that but they both have to
[1:19:52] be of the same ethnic
[1:19:54] you know background
[1:19:57] they all they both got you know oh good
[1:19:59] god almighty
[1:20:01] all right you know my my imagination
[1:20:03] goes goes fast sometimes
[1:20:06] it goes very far
[1:20:08] because they lived in the same house
[1:20:11] they had the same profession
[1:20:13] is it possible
[1:20:23] is it possible
[1:20:25] they got the same daddy
[1:20:33] so
[1:20:36] when when we look at this you know we
[1:20:38] see all these things that they have and
[1:20:40] and and but the problem is is a mother
[1:20:44] knows a child you ain't gonna fool no
[1:20:47] mother
[1:20:48] and you actually ain't gonna fool a
[1:20:49] child either
[1:20:51] because a child knows his mama's voice
[1:20:54] i mean everybody else trying to get that
[1:20:56] cop that child calling me just crying or
[1:20:58] she crying and everybody trying to get a
[1:21:00] child come but all of a sudden mama
[1:21:02] comes around
[1:21:04] and
[1:21:05] just touched the child just look look
[1:21:07] only mama can can minister in certain
[1:21:09] areas that only she can
[1:21:12] nobody else will
[1:21:15] mama knowing a child going through
[1:21:20] mama just started getting on the knees
[1:21:22] and praying something going wrong with
[1:21:23] my child i don't know what it is lord i
[1:21:25] have to wait for my child to call me and
[1:21:27] tell me what's going on
[1:21:29] but i know something is happening but
[1:21:30] let me just start praying right now
[1:21:33] there's a connection between a mother
[1:21:35] and a child because of that umbilical
[1:21:37] cord
[1:21:38] ain't nothing gonna break
[1:21:40] it i say ain't nothing gonna break it
[1:21:44] can i tell you something daddy stop
[1:21:45] trying to break
[1:21:49] can i say it again daddy stop stop
[1:21:51] trying to break that relationship
[1:21:52] between the mother and the child
[1:21:56] don't do that
[1:21:58] there's a connection there and it'll
[1:21:59] always be there
[1:22:07] verse
[1:22:08] 20.
[1:22:10] she rose at midnight and took my son
[1:22:12] from beside me while thine handmaid
[1:22:14] slept
[1:22:15] and laid it in her bosom
[1:22:18] and laid her dead child in my bosom
[1:22:22] and when i rose in the morning to give
[1:22:23] my child suck behold it was dead
[1:22:27] when i had
[1:22:29] considered it in the morning
[1:22:32] before it was not my son which i did
[1:22:34] bear
[1:22:35] at first she upset like my child died
[1:22:37] what happened she just started thinking
[1:22:38] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:22:40] minute
[1:22:42] that ain't my child and you know and
[1:22:44] without living with this lady maybe she
[1:22:46] probably said no
[1:22:47] she sleep wild
[1:22:49] i've seen her sleep
[1:22:51] i i know i don't sleep that way ain't no
[1:22:54] way i would have been able to kill this
[1:22:55] child like this
[1:22:59] let's keep going
[1:23:03] verse 22 says
[1:23:05] and the other woman said nay
[1:23:09] brother living is my son
[1:23:12] and the dead is thy son
[1:23:15] and this said no
[1:23:17] but the dead is that son and the living
[1:23:19] is my son you can imagine what they're
[1:23:21] going through in this household
[1:23:24] now i'm almost
[1:23:25] quite sure that after the judgment amen
[1:23:29] was passed in this case and some of
[1:23:31] y'all already know where it's going but
[1:23:33] after the judgment passed i guarantee
[1:23:35] that lady got her stuff and got out that
[1:23:37] house
[1:23:42] if you do this to me to me with my own
[1:23:45] baby what else would you do
[1:23:47] see hurt people
[1:23:52] hurt people hurt people
[1:23:57] verse 23 uh i'm verse 22 and
[1:24:01] and they said no but the dead is thy son
[1:24:03] and and the limit is my son thus they
[1:24:05] spake before the king then said the king
[1:24:08] the one saith this is my son that liveth
[1:24:12] and thy son is there and the other said
[1:24:14] neighbor thy son is the dead and my sons
[1:24:16] are living and the king said bring me a
[1:24:18] sword
[1:24:20] because see this lady don't mind
[1:24:22] splitting the church
[1:24:25] i heard brother burley say that one time
[1:24:27] when he was reading this story i said
[1:24:28] ain't number the truth you got some
[1:24:30] people that don't care
[1:24:32] about splitting the church
[1:24:36] others will try to keep it together
[1:24:40] but hurt people
[1:24:41] see themselves as the victim look at it
[1:24:44] now
[1:24:45] and the king said
[1:24:47] bring me sword and they brought a sword
[1:24:49] before the king and the king said divide
[1:24:51] the living child in two and give half to
[1:24:53] the one and and half to the other then
[1:24:56] spoke the woman who's the living child
[1:24:58] was unto the king
[1:25:00] for her bowels yearned upon her son she
[1:25:02] said oh my lord give her the living
[1:25:05] child and in no way i slay it but the
[1:25:07] other said let it be
[1:25:09] neither mine nor thine
[1:25:12] but divided
[1:25:14] you see her actions
[1:25:17] actually showed
[1:25:19] who she really was
[1:25:22] and can i put it this way she is a
[1:25:24] murderer
[1:25:26] she murdered her first child
[1:25:29] she's ready to murder the second child
[1:25:31] she'll murder any child
[1:25:33] i'm gonna tell you why because something
[1:25:35] is going on in his latest life she's a
[1:25:36] hurt person
[1:25:39] and hurt people
[1:25:42] tend to
[1:25:44] hurt people
[1:25:51] then the king answered and said give her
[1:25:53] the living child
[1:25:55] and in no way slay it
[1:25:58] she is the mother thereof
[1:26:01] and all israel
[1:26:02] heard of the judgment which the king had
[1:26:04] judged
[1:26:05] and they feared the king for they saw
[1:26:07] that the wisdom of god was in him to do
[1:26:09] judgment
[1:26:10] and you know just just from that that
[1:26:12] story like i said we can if we type it
[1:26:14] to the church you have hurt people in
[1:26:16] the church everybody everybody and it
[1:26:19] hurt it's how you handle how you respond
[1:26:21] to your hurt
[1:26:22] is what really matters most don't be
[1:26:24] like the woman that's willing to split a
[1:26:25] church
[1:26:26] i don't care what i don't care who hurt
[1:26:28] see i want other people to feel my pain
[1:26:33] hurt people
[1:26:35] hurt people
[1:26:38] i don't want people to feel my pain
[1:26:40] i want to feel my joy
[1:26:44] let's go on a little further here

[1:30:10] had a chance to talk about life we had a
[1:30:12] chance to talk about god we had a chance
[1:30:14] to talk about a lot of things i i mean
[1:30:16] you know he
[1:30:17] because of the the life that he lived
[1:30:19] and the sin that he was in his church
[1:30:21] wouldn't even preach his funeral
[1:30:24] but he had a son
[1:30:26] that grew up in a different environment
[1:30:31] that god called to the ministry
[1:30:33] and i said if they won't do it i can do
[1:30:35] it
[1:30:36] and i went back the next week after i
[1:30:37] left the hospital within about about
[1:30:39] about hours within hours after left he
[1:30:41] had gone on
[1:30:43] i'm i'm grateful i had the opportunity
[1:30:44] to see him i mean you know i i can i can
[1:30:48] i'm out here now i might as well just
[1:30:49] say these things
[1:30:51] but i remember when i was younger
[1:30:53] because of the family you know growing
[1:30:54] up in a blended family i wanted to
[1:30:56] change my last name
[1:30:59] i wanted to change my last name i wanted
[1:31:00] to be a burst
[1:31:03] that's what i wanted
[1:31:05] but my daddy
[1:31:07] my i call him daddy you got a brother
[1:31:10] roosevelt burst
[1:31:12] he said no don't change your name
[1:31:17] keep your name and i'ma tell you i
[1:31:20] didn't understand it then
[1:31:22] but when i buried my biological father
[1:31:24] his name is jackie duff and my name is
[1:31:28] jackie duff i realized what my name
[1:31:30] meant
[1:31:33] you see we all have things we go through
[1:31:35] in life that provides
[1:31:37] hurt
[1:31:38] it's how we respond to it
[1:31:45] they made the statement it's easy to
[1:31:47] understand someone else when we walk a
[1:31:49] mile in their moccasins
[1:31:52] as the old saying goes here's a is a
[1:31:54] fact of life hurt people hurt people if
[1:31:57] someone's hurting you
[1:31:59] he's acting this way because he is
[1:32:01] hurting
[1:32:02] hurt people
[1:32:04] hurt others
[1:32:05] and what we need to do is look beyond
[1:32:07] people's faults
[1:32:10] and see their needs
[1:32:13] because that's exactly what our lord and
[1:32:14] savior did for us stop blaming mama stop
[1:32:17] blaming daddy look beyond their faults
[1:32:22] and see their needs
[1:32:25] then we can learn
[1:32:27] to love
[1:32:30] let's go to proverbs 18 and 14.
[1:32:48] this is a
[1:32:52] statement here from solomon
[1:32:55] and um
[1:33:00] i i love it see the spirit of a man
[1:33:03] will sustain his
[1:33:06] infirmity but a wounded spirit
[1:33:11] who can bear
[1:33:13] and you know just some of the commentary
[1:33:16] around this particular uh passage is
[1:33:19] oftentimes when we go through an illness
[1:33:21] in our body or sickness or whatever
[1:33:23] sometimes your body is so depleted
[1:33:26] uh there's just not much you can do but
[1:33:28] what gives you
[1:33:30] a man the strength to actually overcome
[1:33:32] is what's going on inside your spirit
[1:33:36] your spirit man is what's sustaining you
[1:33:39] because the spirit is feeding on the
[1:33:40] word of god and as as it's feeding on
[1:33:43] the word of god and listening to the
[1:33:44] word of god and quoting the word of god
[1:33:46] it's causing your body to come in line
[1:33:48] with the confession of your spirit
[1:33:51] see your spirit is sustaining the
[1:33:53] infirmity
[1:33:55] but but here's the problem a wounded
[1:33:57] spirit
[1:33:59] when you when you allow hurt to get down
[1:34:01] to the spirit level a wounded spirit who
[1:34:06] can bear it
[1:34:09] so you got to watch yourself you know in
[1:34:10] this area you know because that's really
[1:34:13] what satan is after and he'll attack you
[1:34:15] about i mean you think about job joe
[1:34:17] went through so much in his body but he
[1:34:19] kept confessing i know my redeemer
[1:34:21] liveth
[1:34:23] uh and one day i'ma see him in the
[1:34:25] latter day i'ma see i mean he just kept
[1:34:26] confessing that
[1:34:29] and i'm gonna tell you another thing you
[1:34:30] gotta watch who you surround yourself
[1:34:31] with
[1:34:33] when you are going through
[1:34:37] you got to watch the friends that you
[1:34:39] surround yourself with when you are
[1:34:40] going through
[1:34:42] you don't need none of joe's friends
[1:34:45] come on somebody a joke friend's got a
[1:34:47] way of just just oh you did this and you
[1:34:50] did that come on and repent
[1:34:52] and you ain't doing nothing wrong it's
[1:34:54] just god trying his servants
[1:34:57] it's just god trying uh uh his daughter
[1:35:00] it's just god doing that to see what
[1:35:02] your response can be
[1:35:04] you know before the trial came to job
[1:35:06] that god already knew job was going to
[1:35:08] overcome
[1:35:10] and he gave satan a chance to have you
[1:35:12] considered
[1:35:13] my servant joe
[1:35:17] justin upright man i know he won't curse
[1:35:19] me i know he won't he won't turn around
[1:35:21] he won't do nothing
[1:35:22] and we got some modern-day jobs right in
[1:35:25] the room with us
[1:35:27] no matter what they're going through and
[1:35:29] yeah spit yeah my spirit hurt
[1:35:31] my flesh hurt
[1:35:33] everything about me hurt but you know
[1:35:35] what i got i got a a go ahead
[1:35:40] i gotta go ahead
[1:35:42] y'all know what that is what a go-head
[1:35:45] is it's something down on the inside of
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:49] and and and all it all it only got two
[1:35:52] words
[1:35:53] there's something on the inside you got
[1:35:55] two words that he always speaking to you
[1:35:58] he said go ahead
[1:36:00] go ahead
[1:36:02] go hey
[1:36:05] it's good to have a go ahead
[1:36:11] that's what keep me coming to church is
[1:36:14] my go ahead
[1:36:15] when i'm hurt and i'm disappointed i
[1:36:18] still gotta go ahead
[1:36:27] that's what puts a smile on my face when
[1:36:29] i'm frowning on the inside
[1:36:32] because i gotta go ahead
[1:36:35] god put a goal ahead in me
[1:36:39] thank god for it
[1:36:42] spirit of a man will sustain him in his
[1:36:44] infirmity
[1:36:46] but a wounded spirit
[1:36:49] who can bear it
[1:36:51] and and i'm going to tell you a wounded
[1:36:53] spirit who can bear i want to just kind
[1:36:55] of take this from a different angle
[1:36:57] because you know brother branham say
[1:36:58] that we all are
[1:37:01] a man without the holy ghost is nothing
[1:37:03] but an animal
[1:37:07] without the holy ghost
[1:37:09] ain't nothing but an animal
[1:37:10] and i want to there's a little little
[1:37:12] thing that i read here about
[1:37:15] animals
[1:37:16] sick
[1:37:18] injured or unhealthy animals it said
[1:37:20] sick animals
[1:37:23] can be dangerous
[1:37:26] the most dangerous animal you can
[1:37:29] encounter
[1:37:30] in day to day life is an injured
[1:37:33] or a sequin
[1:37:36] it can be very tempting
[1:37:38] i better hear on this now
[1:37:40] it can be very tempting
[1:37:42] to approach the animal to attempt to
[1:37:45] help it
[1:37:50] i mean you think you're doing something
[1:37:51] right by approaching a sick or an
[1:37:54] injured animal
[1:37:55] you got to be careful
[1:37:57] right hey man you you might end up hurt
[1:38:03] by trying to attack a hurt animal or
[1:38:06] help a hurt animal right it says it can
[1:38:08] be very tempting to approach the animal
[1:38:11] to attempt to help it especially if it's
[1:38:13] in pain
[1:38:16] it's very important you resist this
[1:38:18] impulse
[1:38:21] an injured animal may perceive you as a
[1:38:24] threat looking to capitalize on their
[1:38:26] weakened
[1:38:28] state when animals lack other means to
[1:38:32] competently defend themselves they have
[1:38:34] to be far more aggressive than usual
[1:38:39] most people who sustain animal related
[1:38:42] injuries approach the attacking animal
[1:38:44] with good intentions
[1:38:48] remember no no matter how evident their
[1:38:50] behavior may seem
[1:38:52] you do not know what a wild animal is
[1:38:54] thinking
[1:38:56] even experts with years of experience
[1:38:59] routine
[1:39:00] misread
[1:39:02] animal
[1:39:03] signals
[1:39:06] so you got to be careful and see as
[1:39:08] human beings we have the nature of
[1:39:10] animals right we have we have that
[1:39:13] nature and and uh only the holy ghost
[1:39:16] can come and change that
[1:39:18] so oftentimes you might see a hurt
[1:39:19] person what you're trying to do is get
[1:39:20] them try to
[1:39:22] just be careful because you might get
[1:39:23] hurt in the process
[1:39:25] sometimes it's best just to pray and
[1:39:27] i'ma tell you something that i've
[1:39:28] learned to do
[1:39:29] wait yes
[1:39:32] just wait
[1:39:35] wait
[1:39:36] don't be so quick to jump on everything
[1:39:39] wait
[1:39:40] somehow it work out without you saying
[1:39:42] nothing
[1:39:49] you're in a man is what gives you the
[1:39:50] strength to keep pressing forward
[1:39:53] when one is physically hurt it usually
[1:39:55] causes them to retreat
[1:39:57] right so if you if you if you're sick or
[1:39:59] you're hurt it causes you to kind of
[1:40:00] retreat
[1:40:01] you don't want to be around everybody
[1:40:03] especially now we're going with covet we
[1:40:05] actually don't want you around everybody
[1:40:08] right we we would like for you to stay
[1:40:10] home
[1:40:11] amen
[1:40:13] right you got symptoms stay home it's
[1:40:15] okay you you're gonna get over it we
[1:40:16] praying for you gonna come on back out
[1:40:19] but but but when you when you're sick
[1:40:21] retreat
[1:40:25] what happens when people are hurt or
[1:40:27] injured or something like that they
[1:40:28] spend a lot of time in isolation
[1:40:31] and they're trying to work through the
[1:40:32] pain
[1:40:33] that's physically
[1:40:35] guess what happens spiritually
[1:40:38] the same thing happens when one is
[1:40:40] hurting in that spirit they begin to
[1:40:41] retreat
[1:40:42] you won't see them at fellowships
[1:40:48] they're avoiding this they're more than
[1:40:49] that they're hurt in their spirits and
[1:40:51] what happens hurt people
[1:40:53] will hurt people
[1:40:58] give them a little time god will bring
[1:40:59] them through
[1:41:02] let me um just kind of mention something
[1:41:05] here i i'ma i was gonna
[1:41:08] oh lord just
[1:41:13] oh my
[1:41:17] let me just see how i want to do this
[1:41:25] i got
[1:41:26] like i told you i got a lot of little
[1:41:27] things so i was talking about
[1:41:30] family hurt hurt by friends um
[1:41:33] hurt by life untimely deaths and
[1:41:36] one of the big things in family hurt
[1:41:43] is um
[1:41:44] when parents are divorced
[1:41:46] and parents get a divorce
[1:41:48] that's a big family hurt
[1:41:51] um
[1:41:52] and i know you know not everybody get
[1:41:54] married to get divorced
[1:41:57] it's not why we do that
[1:41:59] but things happen in in relationships
[1:42:01] hurt happens in relationships and
[1:42:04] things just happen that that you don't
[1:42:06] have any control over
[1:42:08] but nonetheless when it happens it does
[1:42:11] not
[1:42:13] minimize the impact
[1:42:16] that that that that that is seen in our
[1:42:18] children
[1:42:23] um sometimes infidelity will impact
[1:42:26] relationships now let me just stop and
[1:42:27] just talk a little bit about this
[1:42:29] because in in in in our world
[1:42:32] we we see
[1:42:34] infidelity as insurmountable
[1:42:38] we see it that way but i want to
[1:42:40] understand that it was infidelity
[1:42:42] at the beginning with adam and eve
[1:42:46] and somehow
[1:42:47] adam overcame
[1:42:51] adam overcame it
[1:42:53] now if we would get back to adam type
[1:42:56] thinking
[1:42:57] then we can overcome some of those
[1:42:58] things i ain't gonna say it's gonna be
[1:43:00] easy
[1:43:01] but i can tell you that if adam did it
[1:43:03] we can do it
[1:43:05] even even from a spiritual sense god
[1:43:07] himself forgave israel for their
[1:43:09] infidelity
[1:43:12] and he said in his word i'm married to
[1:43:13] you
[1:43:16] so so we have to get a thought process
[1:43:18] that no we in this thing to to the end
[1:43:21] right so so so uh but i was just kind of
[1:43:24] doing some you know research and things
[1:43:26] like that and and and i i i saw
[1:43:29] uh when infidel infidelity happens in a
[1:43:32] relationship
[1:43:33] husband and wife
[1:43:35] um
[1:43:36] infidelity often leads the other party
[1:43:39] to seeking revenge
[1:43:42] so if if if the husband goes out on the
[1:43:44] wife the wife gonna start seeking
[1:43:46] revenge if the wife goes out and her
[1:43:48] husband the husband gonna start seeking
[1:43:49] revenge
[1:43:50] that's what the devil put in their mind
[1:43:53] right and and what what that is it's a
[1:43:55] desire
[1:43:58] to seek additional hurt
[1:44:00] i'm hurt i'm a victim and i want to see
[1:44:03] you hurt
[1:44:06] and when this occurs it begins to add a
[1:44:09] new strain to the family dynamics
[1:44:13] hallelujah and sometimes the pressure
[1:44:15] gets too great so divorce seems to be
[1:44:20] the only option
[1:44:21] and let me tell you something there's a
[1:44:23] way that seemeth right
[1:44:25] until man but the end thereof are the
[1:44:27] ways of death
[1:44:30] broken families impact
[1:44:33] uh on the children um
[1:44:36] these are some of the
[1:44:37] statistics that show when children are
[1:44:39] raised in a
[1:44:40] a single-parent household one of them
[1:44:42] says children
[1:44:44] who grow up in unstable environments are
[1:44:46] more susceptible to live in unstable
[1:44:48] environments later on in life
[1:44:51] uh children begin to suffer uh
[1:44:54] poorly in their academics in school
[1:44:57] um it also said when parents when
[1:44:59] children have to go through this they
[1:45:00] end up in a financial challenge
[1:45:03] because they don't have the two incomes
[1:45:05] coming to the household anymore
[1:45:07] oh come on somebody and even though
[1:45:09] daddy might be on child support that's
[1:45:11] still not all the money that daddy used
[1:45:13] to bring into the house so mama's still
[1:45:16] trying to make it work
[1:45:17] y'all ain't gonna talk to me today
[1:45:20] and now you blaming mama because she has
[1:45:22] it mama ain't get my man have it all
[1:45:24] like she used to have it when daddy was
[1:45:26] there
[1:45:27] these things create financial challenges
[1:45:29] in a home and now that kid feel like i
[1:45:32] can't get this because
[1:45:35] see it affects them in the psyche
[1:45:40] they also say
[1:45:41] it produces anger and irritability
[1:45:44] irritability in the child
[1:45:47] they have a difficulty adapting to
[1:45:49] changes
[1:45:52] they have difficulty adapting to changes
[1:45:55] the child becomes emotionally sensitive
[1:45:59] another thing that happens is that the
[1:46:01] child sometimes have a
[1:46:03] feeling of guilt as if it was their
[1:46:06] fault
[1:46:07] to cause the marriage
[1:46:08] to dissolve
[1:46:12] and ultimately what the devil's doing is
[1:46:14] striking that that child striking that
[1:46:15] they're trying striking at that child
[1:46:17] to finally where the child gets to the
[1:46:19] point where they lose faith
[1:46:21] in the whole system of marriage
[1:46:24] or even in a family unit
[1:46:27] that's why you have children growing up
[1:46:28] saying
[1:46:30] i don't want no children
[1:46:34] but you got to understand that the
[1:46:36] reason that you have been put together
[1:46:38] is so that god could use you to multiply
[1:46:47] hurt people
[1:46:49] hurt people
[1:46:53] why do people get divorced these are
[1:46:54] some of the reasons that they say people
[1:46:56] get divorced lack of commitment
[1:47:01] they say they argue too much
[1:47:05] so some say they get married i mean get
[1:47:06] divorced because of infidelity or some
[1:47:09] say we married too young we didn't
[1:47:10] realize what we was doing we was that
[1:47:12] young no you knew full well what you was
[1:47:14] doing
[1:47:17] you can't blame that on youth you're
[1:47:19] just some things you didn't do
[1:47:20] right another one is uh
[1:47:23] unrealistic expectations
[1:47:26] that's why that's a that's a killer to
[1:47:28] marriage unrealistic expectations what
[1:47:32] you expect from her and what she expects
[1:47:33] i mean all that type of stuff y'all
[1:47:35] gotta you know one one of the things
[1:47:37] that that that uh
[1:47:38] society when we do uh counseling with
[1:47:40] people uh we always kind of uh tell them
[1:47:43] say look marriage is not 50 50. who told
[1:47:46] you that
[1:47:47] who told you marriage was 50 50.
[1:47:50] marriage is not that marriage is 100
[1:47:54] 100. and mary said look when you can't
[1:47:57] carry your weight i got you
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:02] that's what mary said i i mean that's
[1:48:04] what love i got you when you can't do it
[1:48:06] i got you
[1:48:08] don't worry we're gonna make this we're
[1:48:10] gonna work through this thing together
[1:48:12] but now you need to bring your 50
[1:48:13] percent you ain't coming up you ain't
[1:48:15] doing your part no that that's an
[1:48:17] unrealistic expectation
[1:48:24] another one they say is uh
[1:48:26] lack of equality in the relationship
[1:48:30] y'all ain't gonna talk to me i'm gonna
[1:48:31] say that again
[1:48:34] let's say the reason that marriages
[1:48:36] break down
[1:48:37] is because of a lack of equality
[1:48:39] in a relationship you know what that
[1:48:41] tells me that statement right there say
[1:48:44] they're gonna have a biblical model for
[1:48:45] the marriage
[1:48:48] the husband the husband is the head
[1:48:53] and every marriage ain't gonna have no
[1:48:55] two heads
[1:48:56] if your body got two heads you got a
[1:48:58] freak body
[1:49:03] somebody got to be the head
[1:49:05] so i would just be honest with you sis
[1:49:06] and i'm not saying like i told y'all
[1:49:08] it's going to be some political fight i
[1:49:10] mean
[1:49:12] religious persecution coming it's coming
[1:49:16] it's on the way i might as well say
[1:49:17] these things it's coming anyway i can't
[1:49:20] stop it from coming so i might as well
[1:49:22] say look look i mean this world has kind
[1:49:24] of made sisters think a little different
[1:49:26] about themselves but we got to go back
[1:49:28] to what the bible say
[1:49:32] god called that man to be the head so
[1:49:34] sister i'm gonna tell you
[1:49:36] really most of the time you're gonna be
[1:49:39] the one to submit your idea
[1:49:44] that's why you need to court
[1:49:46] and see how that man thinks
[1:49:50] so you have you have an opportunity to
[1:49:52] submit because what we what we have
[1:49:55] nowadays is what we call a silent head
[1:50:02] just just just underneath behind the
[1:50:04] scenes she controlling everything and
[1:50:06] let me tell you when you're a solid head
[1:50:07] don't think people don't see it
[1:50:10] people can see that
[1:50:12] oh
[1:50:13] a silent head that's trying to control
[1:50:15] everything and just you know kind of
[1:50:18] slightly just move over to just have a
[1:50:20] little can i talk to you to the side
[1:50:22] oh we know what this is we know what
[1:50:23] it's all about we married too
[1:50:28] thank you doing something uh uh you know
[1:50:31] on the slide
[1:50:32] no no we that's the silent head talking
[1:50:36] sometimes you gotta talk with your with
[1:50:38] your mouth
[1:50:40] your eyes
[1:50:42] your body language is saying a lot and
[1:50:44] we just watching how the husband looking
[1:50:46] at oh lord a solid head
[1:50:53] so you got you have to learn that's why
[1:50:55] you're courting to make sure that he's a
[1:50:56] he's a man that can kind of handle
[1:50:58] certain things
[1:51:00] he watches his decision-making and look
[1:51:02] and even you know look i believe my wife
[1:51:04] uh helped me get a lot of blind spots
[1:51:06] she catch a lot of blind spots for me
[1:51:08] and i'd be forging her head i'm gonna do
[1:51:10] this i'm doing this and she said now uh
[1:51:11] watch that oh i ain't see that over
[1:51:13] there
[1:51:17] she's my help mate and i thank god for
[1:51:20] her help
[1:51:25] so there's lack of equality in
[1:51:27] relationship that's because they don't
[1:51:28] have an understanding of what the role
[1:51:29] is of the husband and the what the role
[1:51:31] is of the wife a wife is not a doormat
[1:51:36] a wife is a helpmate
[1:51:39] amen you know in one situation brother
[1:51:41] branham uh was talking giving counsel to
[1:51:43] a couple uh the the man he when he was
[1:51:46] in control of money he just messed up
[1:51:48] the money
[1:51:51] messed it up
[1:51:52] so brother branham gave advice to this
[1:51:54] couple say brother why don't you let
[1:51:55] your wife handle the finances
[1:51:59] now that caused that man to be
[1:52:00] submissive now you want advice from a
[1:52:03] prophet you just got it let your wife
[1:52:05] control the money
[1:52:08] and most men oh no i let not control
[1:52:11] nothing ain't never
[1:52:13] i ain't letting them know nothing but if
[1:52:15] you were to talk to a prophet the
[1:52:16] prophet let your wife you know what some
[1:52:18] of us would be in a better financial
[1:52:20] position right now
[1:52:23] have we heed it just simple advice like
[1:52:25] that
[1:52:28] i told you i i knew i knew i knew lord
[1:52:30] when i stepped out here what this was
[1:52:32] going to be i knew
[1:52:33] i knew i knew i know what i was up
[1:52:35] against lord
[1:52:39] but hurt people
[1:52:41] hurt people
[1:52:43] and the reason you're so controlling
[1:52:44] with the finances because you didn't
[1:52:46] have nothing when you was coming up
[1:52:49] you was hurt
[1:52:51] you didn't have nothing so now you got
[1:52:53] to control everything
[1:52:59] it's your environment that produced the
[1:53:01] psyche that made you the person you are
[1:53:03] now all you got to do is apply biblical
[1:53:05] principles even when it comes to your
[1:53:07] finances you watch god bless it
[1:53:11] husband and wife set financial goals
[1:53:13] together
[1:53:16] this how much money we're trying to save
[1:53:18] oh come on y'all y'all ain't talking to
[1:53:19] me
[1:53:22] i've seen a i've seen a couple the
[1:53:24] husband just working working up
[1:53:26] something just working trying to make
[1:53:27] sure this was taken care of trying to
[1:53:29] make sure and the wife got 10 15 000
[1:53:32] sitting in the bank like no yeah you got
[1:53:33] to get out there and work the man didn't
[1:53:35] have to do that all they need just use
[1:53:37] some of the money she had just sitting
[1:53:38] there just in case
[1:53:40] things don't work out between us i got
[1:53:42] me something to fall back on
[1:53:44] she got an exit strategy
[1:53:46] why she even marriage
[1:53:51] how how can you be committed with an
[1:53:53] exit strategy
[1:53:57] now if we in this together we in this
[1:53:58] together
[1:54:00] but let's set a financial goal like look
[1:54:02] we're only going to spend this much of
[1:54:03] this
[1:54:04] but we're going to keep the rest of it
[1:54:06] over there
[1:54:07] and we cannot go below that we got to
[1:54:09] agree to this
[1:54:13] and so don't be thinking about
[1:54:15] that other money sitting there and no
[1:54:17] don't don't i don't want to hear it
[1:54:21] cause we agreed
[1:54:22] that we weren't gonna touch that money
[1:54:24] that's how you build together
[1:54:28] husband died money sitting in the couch
[1:54:30] wife can't even get to it
[1:54:32] her name not even on the account
[1:54:35] thousands go back thousands go back to
[1:54:38] the government
[1:54:40] your family never enjoy it
[1:54:44] because hurt people
[1:54:48] hurt people hurt people
[1:54:53] a couple other things
[1:54:55] while marriages fail lack of preparation
[1:54:57] for marriage
[1:55:00] they also say domestic violence or abuse
[1:55:03] is something that creates um
[1:55:06] problems in marriage so you know and
[1:55:08] ain't no way that's again that's right
[1:55:09] there in the bible i i i shouldn't have
[1:55:11] to read that but the bible tells a man
[1:55:13] ain't gonna hit his wife if he won't
[1:55:15] hurt himself he won't hurt his wife
[1:55:18] anybody read that in the scripture if he
[1:55:20] won't hurt himself he won't hurt his
[1:55:21] wife
[1:55:23] come on somebody
[1:55:25] amen it's right down the word of god and
[1:55:27] let me tell you something brother that's
[1:55:28] not physically
[1:55:32] don't stop just physically your mouth
[1:55:34] your mouth you wouldn't want nobody
[1:55:36] talking to you like that
[1:55:38] you'd be ready to fight somebody if they
[1:55:39] rose up talking to you like that will
[1:55:41] you stop talking to your wife like that
[1:55:48] amen
[1:55:53] i i i i notice this is deep
[1:55:56] i know this is
[1:56:11] we live in a society
[1:56:14] full of hurt people
[1:56:17] you say anything against what somebody
[1:56:19] believed
[1:56:20] you hurt them if you hurt them
[1:56:23] they put you in the category now
[1:56:26] you've been cancelled
[1:56:31] cancel culture
[1:56:36] so you know i've been i i'm not i'm not
[1:56:38] hip to all this stuff so i had to kind
[1:56:40] of ask what does this mean
[1:56:43] then i went to the the the the
[1:56:45] merriam-webster states that the cancel
[1:56:49] culture in this context means to stop
[1:56:51] giving support
[1:56:54] to a person
[1:56:57] uh it was it's pretty much withdrawn
[1:56:59] support oh god
[1:57:03] that happened in church
[1:57:05] when you let somebody don't like a
[1:57:07] sermon
[1:57:10] oh y'all ain't talking
[1:57:14] y'all ain't talking this morning
[1:57:17] you you've become a part of the council
[1:57:20] culture
[1:57:21] and sometimes they're gonna withdraw
[1:57:22] their support so like the church ain't
[1:57:25] going to live without your support
[1:57:27] it's god that provides god is the source
[1:57:31] you are simply a resource
[1:57:34] in time that is not for the pastor
[1:57:36] tithing is for you to be blessed
[1:57:40] this how to decide the enemies rebuked
[1:57:42] in your household
[1:57:46] that's god's plan
[1:57:48] but but don't you fall for the cancer
[1:57:50] culture
[1:57:55] withdrawn support
[1:57:58] for public figures
[1:57:59] and companies after they have done or
[1:58:01] said something considered objectionable
[1:58:04] or offensive
[1:58:09] the phenomenon has occurred with both
[1:58:11] public figures and private clients
[1:58:15] the term is
[1:58:17] symbolically applied to incidents both
[1:58:19] online and off that range from vigilant
[1:58:22] justice to hostile debate
[1:58:24] to stalking intimidation and harassment
[1:58:28] those who embrace the idea
[1:58:30] of castling
[1:58:32] seek more than
[1:58:35] pat apologies
[1:58:38] now i'm saying sorry
[1:58:40] ain't good enough
[1:58:44] they they seek more than just pat
[1:58:46] apologies attraction when we get part of
[1:58:48] this cancer culture we want a job
[1:58:50] we we want we we don't we we don't want
[1:58:53] you to make any money
[1:58:55] we want you to be out on the streets
[1:58:58] we we we want you to be poor and and now
[1:59:01] start begging this this is what we want
[1:59:05] none of this stuff agree with scripture
[1:59:08] and and and i'm gonna just tell y'all be
[1:59:10] careful how y'all get so associated with
[1:59:12] this i'm i'm i'm gonna finish up right
[1:59:14] here i'm gonna just read a few
[1:59:15] scriptures and i'ma stop right here
[1:59:16] because i got a timer
[1:59:18] i got a timer that's why i say i'll be
[1:59:19] back next week i got more to say
[1:59:23] but it's not scriptural
[1:59:25] can we read a few scriptures
[1:59:35] um
[1:59:37] matthew 6 verse 9-15
[1:59:40] we have a way that we should be
[1:59:41] responding acting in times like this not
[1:59:44] like the world because we're not we're
[1:59:46] we're in the world but we're not of the
[1:59:47] world
[1:59:48] we are christians
[1:59:50] matthew 6 9-15 look at this it says this
[1:59:54] after this manner
[1:59:56] therefore
[1:59:57] pray
[2:00:00] our father
[2:00:02] which art in heaven
[2:00:04] hallowed be thy name
[2:00:07] thy kingdom come
[2:00:09] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[2:00:12] heaven
[2:00:13] give us this day
[2:00:15] our daily bread
[2:00:17] and forgive us
[2:00:19] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[2:00:22] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[2:00:24] us from evil but thine is the kingdom
[2:00:26] and the power and the glory forever amen
[2:00:28] look at this
[2:00:30] for if ye
[2:00:31] forgive men
[2:00:33] their trespasses
[2:00:35] your heavenly father will also forgive
[2:00:38] you say don't cancel them
[2:00:42] forgive them
[2:00:46] but if you forgive not men their
[2:00:47] trespasses neither will your father
[2:00:50] forgive your trespasses
[2:00:53] so as you canceling you're only hurting
[2:00:55] yourself
[2:00:56] because remember hurt people
[2:00:59] hurt people
[2:01:01] matthew 18.
[2:01:06] verse 21 says then peter came to him and
[2:01:09] said lord how oft shall my brother sin
[2:01:11] against me and i forgive him till seven
[2:01:14] times
[2:01:15] jesus said to him i say not unto thee
[2:01:18] until seven times but until 70 times 7.
[2:01:28] first corinthians 13 verse 4 through 6
[2:01:32] oh god
[2:01:36] charity suffers long
[2:01:39] and is kind
[2:01:41] charity in this not
[2:01:44] charity volunteer not itself is not
[2:01:46] puffed up
[2:01:48] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[2:01:50] not our own is not easily
[2:01:54] provoked
[2:01:57] thinketh
[2:01:59] no evil
[2:02:00] rejoice of not in iniquity
[2:02:03] but rejoices
[2:02:05] in truth see we got to move to this
[2:02:06] level
[2:02:08] and the cancer culture does not allow us
[2:02:09] to do that
[2:02:11] can i go back to amen uh just one more
[2:02:15] uh two more scriptures i want to read
[2:02:17] go back here to
[2:02:19] luke 17 verse 1 through 4.
[2:02:23] i told you that we all are hurt from
[2:02:26] something we and if we haven't been hurt
[2:02:28] we're going to be hurt
[2:02:29] but it's how we respond to it look at
[2:02:32] what this is what luke 17 tells us verse
[2:02:35] 1 then said he unto the disciples
[2:02:39] it is impossible
[2:02:42] but that offenses
[2:02:45] will come
[2:02:48] impossible that means ain't nobody here
[2:02:50] going to be without it
[2:02:51] it's how we handle it
[2:02:53] it's impossible that offenses will come
[2:02:56] and and i want you to understand that
[2:02:57] word offenses and that and that that
[2:02:59] that that that context it's a stumbling
[2:03:02] block
[2:03:03] that means all of us can receive
[2:03:05] stumbling blocks or it also means things
[2:03:07] that offend
[2:03:11] it's impossible that but that offenses
[2:03:12] will come but woe unto him through whom
[2:03:15] they come
[2:03:17] if it were better for him that a
[2:03:19] millstone were hanged about his neck and
[2:03:21] he cast into the sea
[2:03:24] praise god that he cast uh that he cast
[2:03:27] into the sea uh then that he should
[2:03:29] offend one of these little ones so just
[2:03:32] let god handle it
[2:03:34] take heed to yourselves if thy brother
[2:03:37] trespass against thee
[2:03:40] rebuke him now y'all got to be careful
[2:03:42] with that one
[2:03:44] because you think you need to just go
[2:03:45] get it straight
[2:03:47] the bible told me to rebuke you
[2:03:52] and if he repent
[2:03:54] forgive him that rebuke in that context
[2:03:56] just means just have a conversation with
[2:03:58] him
[2:03:59] just talk with him straightly charge him
[2:04:01] and be straight with what you're trying
[2:04:03] to say don't be going all around
[2:04:05] just say what you got to say
[2:04:07] and say it calmly
[2:04:11] rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
[2:04:13] so if he repent what you supposed to do
[2:04:16] no no today cancel him even if he repent
[2:04:19] we're going to cancel him
[2:04:22] no forgive him and if he trespass
[2:04:24] against these seven times in a day
[2:04:30] seven times in the day turn again to
[2:04:32] thee saying i repent
[2:04:34] thou shalt forgive him this is what god
[2:04:36] is calling us to
[2:04:42] let me uh line up this last quote from
[2:04:44] this out in the message i know line that
[2:04:46] up for me and and this last scripture
[2:04:48] that i want to read before i read that
[2:04:49] quote
[2:04:52] last script is romans 12 verse 1 through
[2:04:54] 2.
[2:05:00] i beseech you therefore
[2:05:02] brethren
[2:05:04] by the mercies of god
[2:05:07] that you present your body as a living
[2:05:08] sacrifice
[2:05:10] holy
[2:05:12] acceptable unto god which is your
[2:05:14] reasonable service
[2:05:17] and i love this paul gives us the advice
[2:05:19] and be
[2:05:20] not
[2:05:21] conformed
[2:05:23] to this world
[2:05:24] but be transformed
[2:05:27] by the renewing of your mind
[2:05:29] that you may prove what is that good
[2:05:32] and acceptable
[2:05:35] and perfect will of god
[2:05:38] we all hurt people
[2:05:40] but we don't have to go around and
[2:05:43] hurt people
[2:05:45] it's all how we respond
[2:05:48] this last quote i want to leave with you
[2:05:49] today out of i know
[2:05:53] the prophet says this and why
[2:05:56] does god let troubles come
[2:06:00] you're wondering why me you're not the
[2:06:02] victim
[2:06:03] you're the victor
[2:06:05] and why does god let troubles come god
[2:06:07] harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth
[2:06:11] and makes it
[2:06:12] obey him
[2:06:14] and those troubles bring us into a
[2:06:16] closer fellowship with god there had
[2:06:19] been no rainbow until the flood came but
[2:06:21] after noah was pressed into that
[2:06:23] condition that he was in the uh to float
[2:06:25] 40 days and nights in a storm and the
[2:06:27] little ark pitching up and down in the
[2:06:29] water it was after the flood was over
[2:06:31] that he saw the rainbow for its first
[2:06:33] time amen the covenant of hope the
[2:06:35] covenant of promise after he went
[2:06:38] through the tribulation then he saw the
[2:06:39] promise amen after he went through the
[2:06:42] tribulation then he started promise most
[2:06:45] of us don't want to go through nothing
[2:06:47] but after you go through the tribulation
[2:06:48] then you see the promise say that's the
[2:06:50] way you see the promise after you've
[2:06:52] gone through the tribulation i like that
[2:06:54] poem or some must i
[2:06:56] be carried away
[2:06:58] and be carried home to heaven on a
[2:07:00] flower bed of ease while others fought
[2:07:02] to win the prize and sell through bloody
[2:07:04] seas
[2:07:05] we ask
[2:07:06] for confident peace
[2:07:08] god
[2:07:10] gives us the best
[2:07:13] he could give us
[2:07:15] and you won't want to know what god's
[2:07:17] best is for you
[2:07:19] trials
[2:07:20] and tribulations oh glory
[2:07:23] the bet that's better than comfort and
[2:07:27] peace
[2:07:28] our comfort
[2:07:30] is just beyond the river
[2:07:32] god i have an attitude
[2:07:34] of gratitude in the midst of my hurt
[2:07:42] let me see here i'm i'm done for today

[2:14:45] thank you lord there are so many ways
[2:14:47] lord that your men are hurt and
[2:14:49] sometimes lord god your hurt has to be
[2:14:51] exposed
[2:14:53] thank you for giving us a message lord
[2:14:55] god where we all can take inventory of
[2:14:57] our lives father
[2:14:59] we wonder why certain things we do lord
[2:15:01] god and certain things we just keep
[2:15:03] repeating lord is because we haven't had
[2:15:06] the hurt mended in our lives
[2:15:08] we want to lay all these things at your
[2:15:11] feet lord jesus and surrender completely
[2:15:13] to you
[2:15:14] father have your way in the lives of
[2:15:16] your people men the broken heart
[2:15:19] father the different things that we were

[2:15:23] lives father god we have we're still
[2:15:25] fighting about instead of surrendering
[2:15:27] them to you so father we want to commit
[2:15:30] these things to you lord mold us and
[2:15:32] shape us
[2:15:33] in the image of our lord jesus christ
[2:15:35] lord and we know when we ask these
[2:15:37] things lord that's asking for tests and
[2:15:40] trials lord because character is a
