scared and afraid but people need to know that God has it all in control and that every little thing he's mindful of and and they need to realize that you know when trouble surrounds you that you need to be able to look to something not to the government not to the medical science but look to something that's truly truly real because we know that the Bible tells us that heaven and earth will pass away but his word will always remain the same and those the government can can't take this away medical science can't take this away the only thing that can take this away is Jesus Christ [Music] yes God is real I can't [Music] No oh he's reeling my soul yes God is real [Music] me home his love for me it's like you go [Music] for I can't yes that is real or I can't be yes God is real or I can't be

sacrifice if I shut up heaven that there be no rain or if I command the locusts to devour the land or if I see pestilence among my people so God can do that if you want to right it says if my people which are called by running so hover themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land God we'd be healing in the land since now mine eyes shall be open at my ears attempt them to the prayer that is made in this place now have I said I but have I chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually thank God for his word thank God for his promise they meant that he has made us you can be seated just for a few minutes appreciate those songs where the Sun man like that even coronavirus my bow before him he is a mighty God a man's a mighty God just a couple of things this morning we were blessed amen brother quake who's actually going to come at minister for us this morning now we looking forward to that but before he comes I just want to share a couple of things with is the first of the month a man we have our building fund report that I wanted to just give you really quickly here and there was a last month we actually received four thousand two hundred thirty thousand twenty three cent a man towards the building fund last month our objective they've managed to just kind of see our goal was to raise a hundred and five thousand dollars this year we have pledged sixty thousand nine dollars that's was played pledged and so far received a year today is nine thousand eight hundred and ninety two dollars and fourteen cents for that for this first three months nine thousand eight hundred and ninety two thousand fourteen cent and we have actually accumulated interest of two hundred fifty dollars and ninety seven cent which gives us a grand total of ten thousand one hundred fifty one dollars and 11 cents a man so that's what has been raised and we thank God for that and you know I tell you what God has been good in the midst of all of this that we are facing I have seen his mighty hand at work and continue to see his hand at work him we just want to say a word of Prayer I'm just thinking we have some Saints here in our church that are kind of like frontline people as they respond to this and it's just their job to go and and respond and they probably had a number of different things and we want to remember those Saints in prayer now we got a request from sister realized she has a friend of hers that's in New York and the she was responding and end up actually contracting this virus and I believe her whole entire household was actually impacted her children they're impacted as well so we want to take this serious and we want to pray I think her mom is also impacted so we want to pray for them that God would just make a way and just touch through their bodies we've been here tested most people that have been heal from this people that have been God has reversed it and now if he can do it for one he can do it for others a man so we want to do that and I want to thank you all for you know just kind of following some of the protocols that we put in place this is all for everybody's benefit and everybody's protection we don't want to take this lightly and you know just be negligent in some things so I just appreciate you all doing the social the social distancing it and the washing of the hands and sanitizing and all those things we really appreciate that so the Lord blessed you I had an opportunity I got a call from a church that told me that those Christ fellowship they said they were giving out things they had bags of groceries that they want to give out and asked me that I know anybody that that can use it so I I somebody had told me about it particularly the mass I said I remember that need and you know so I tried to you know get some things for them and if you all are running to many things where you have some these just get it to me there are people reaching up to me asking me if you need something please I will try to help out so just let me know and we'll try to do whatever we can but we were able to get some of those groceries and we gave it to some people in a community here next to us and there was a lady that was grateful for what we did and she sent a card here a man with appreciation she says pray that God will continue to bless you all and in all your endeavors in sharing and caring and blessing she says to past it up in a spiritual tabernacle members please accept my sincerest thank you for sharing a food bag from my neighbor and mobile industry the Cypress Lake so she was grateful for what we provided and you know it just just happy that we're able to touch somebody's life they went even during the time like this so we won't just remember her so let's just sub before brother Queen could come let's just have a photo but word of Prayer over some of our frontline Saints a man that are providing care at this time they don't just protect them during this season God would come before your presence believing that you are in control of everything that we see going on it they told us Lord that if your people which are called by your name and will humble themselves and pray seek your face turn from our wicked ways God you said you would hear from heaven and you would heal our land where doctors are not able to do it where nurses look not able to do it God where our government leaders are not able to do it we know our God is more than able to do this so father we want to pray for our frontline fathers those that are here even with our bit scoff ever having a face to put on a day-to-day basis whether it's in the hospital whether it's in people's homes God we pray for your divine protection Lord four-foot for these Saints that you would just be with them their other states Lord here in this area that also work as front-line responders God be with them and protect them protect their families Lord you said that this display would not come not our dwelling that's what you promised and what we just speak your word over each of them and acts that you would just be there their support God and that you would just carefully we also remember this young lady there in New York Lord that has contracted a virus and Lord her family that is going through even at this time God bring healing to that family I trust that you reverse what what the enemy has attacked with all she was doing was her job and God this in advance jumped on her so we've noted this is a demon that comes from hell and all sicknesses of the devil so Lord we just so we rebuke it down the name of Jesus they're probably just free as you told us in your word that what we are on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so we come against it right now in the name of Jesus

EU is rooted and coronavirus a man before the world was formed the Lord put something you are you a being something before you drop into this flesh you a part of elohim amen you are in another civilization where there was no coronavirus where there was no sadness where death is not even under student because it's not a language amen you're happy with your funny you were part of Elohim but then the Lord put you here in this flesh he didn't leave you alone you saw her what you had in you but then it wasn't quicken on to the appointed time Amen we know we lost inheritance in the Garden of Eden but a lot through what you see you restore you and I back to I inherit ants amen but to the spooking wait back to the Garden of Eden not a physical garden not trees and flowers and roses by garden of the Word of God amen yo-you I garden yourself if someone said are the Blessed a man who not who doesn't work in iniquity doesn't work in the world of iniquity but who is gonna be like a tree of life because we a tree you a garden you are a plantain of the Lord just as we plant flowers and trees and vegetables and different things the Lord planted you on this earth for this very purpose amen so there's nothing out of Keita there's nothing beyond your control so brother I'm a human being we have a lot of limitation I don't even know how to go through my grocery I don't want to get in touch with people I don't want to shake hands with people yes I know that the human limitation but behind that within that there's another dimension there's a few funny there's a holy goose that's eternal life he's greater than all the demons which rather than Satan who is greater than all the negatives you can listen to around the world he's the one in you amen did I see you is rather than he does in the world blessed be the name of the Lord so fear is not your promise no your promise is eternal life what is the West in the West is I can't drop down and die physically it's just like taking my garment of me I'm still alive so if even this is taken out of me we could still be walking in the dimension glory hallelujah amen the westin that we draw from this flesh that's what everybody's care about from this is an element by you and I you existed before the foundation of the world you had another life in you that when this one drops there's someone who takes over this is too funny that's it's an alive there's Jesus Christ in you that life has no beginning and there's no end so we are not just ordinary people to be gripped with fear you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you are the one you are the hope for this world amen you are once you give your neighbors who that crisis alive amen so don't let the enemy the news media grip you of course we have to obey every loss or the land you have to take the precautions of and see Co CDC thank you we have to do everything necessary even taking this with just common sense to do that I for example when I go to grocery before this and I like to wash I'm not exactly but something like that a lot to watch everything I can't wash even bottles drinks juices I like to watch them I like to wash my hands so it's practical to do that amen and also to transfer 17 to our aquatic artist do the social distancing but behind addresses Petra type in that amen now this is a play that has caused the whole world to reach into the whole big machines machines powerful men powerful people influence everyone is hiding in his home everyone doesn't want to touch and talk to nobody people doesn't want to touch nobody why it is a home calling time amen the Lord is typing this one it's our home what is your home your home is not here yeah it's the home of this flesh but you have a home with you amen you are the clean feel funny room you have the kingdom of God within you that is the hook going time amen the smoking where the third who is your home amen and that is what the Lord is preparing us for when turn of Israel and Egypt this another Egypt going on sometimes they lost for four scriptures in a very simplified way when you really from history was thinking like oh there was like some mighty something going on but it was a simple form just like this there was an angel of death going around knocking down the firstborn of the Egyptians and there was the appeal of fire they agreed in China if I should put in a human form we stretch behind in front of every door boots of the believers they just go in this way there's no way the angel of that could even venture you could even try because he's the one in charge and all of them could go and plant editing do groceries like we did but you could go to their farm and get their food and animals and come back they are first ones didn't die because he that was within them it was written he that was in the world and now we have another Egyptian freak again caught coronavirus that has put big president little president big woman little woman everybody back to their home why the Lord is telling us that he's the one in control doesn't matter you are Russia you are a China you are the United States you agree Britain everybody is now quiet when Lion King blues piece everyone is quiet in my time my lifetime I've never seen when the Lord has got attention of people like this one globally people everyone knows that is God I don't believe that is God you know there's God you don't have to preach to them the poor now running helter-skelter seeking for refuge because death is close to the doorstep by you and I are the hope or no because we are better than them but you were ordained to be a salvation unto the world amen so let's just say go into the scriptures and just see what the Lord will have for us this morning blessed be the name of the Lord glory hallelujah the Lord he is good amen blessed be the name of the Lord we want to speak on this monitor theme they feel funny the believers absolutes amen they feel funny they believers absolute and what to read our first scripture that has been a protected scripture I think by the Jack give it to us some time ago I don't remember exactly when some 91 he's reading scripture that if you know unbelievers are using it believe in God do you have nothing to do with God they are using some 91 verse 1 and I mean the rule of some 91 but let's read 1 and 2 some 91 verse 1 and 2 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust amen he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty Christ Elohim which you are part of when trauma Elohim don't separate yourself from God O God is way some way and I'm here but a just children way in him Amen his wife was in him Amen because was his wife a lot put it put in another family but his wife was part of him we're before the foundation of the world his daughters a part of him before the foundation of the world that's what he carries genetics declares his name his blood and everything so don't separate yourself that oh I'm different his daughter cannot say that oh I'm different from my dad in human function yes that is a man is a preacher she has a attribute Soraka has a attribute by the apartheid is got the same genetics you have got the same holy goose that was in Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago the same Jesus Christ is living in you amen so he said he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High which is in 1087 dimension before I mean there was heaven you were dwelling in the seven dimension the mind of Elohim you a part of Elohim but you have to express yourself in a shadow form amen I don't know if I can see my shadow I don't see it now your shadow you can see it right oh thank you God bless you LEM come here yes I have a shadow now I have to be there for my shadow to be there without me there wouldn't be any shadow so this shadow is a projection of me when the Sun and the light and darkness divide from the shadow so this flesh is a projection of the feel funny amen so before you drop on this earth to even get to know coronavirus you had the original he that dwelleth in the secret place of the almighty of the moosa' and now you are dwelling under the shadow amen the earth is a shadow can we take a place can we be seated amen everything's I will going through is a shadow it's a playground amen of the reality of the true life form there's only one type of life that is eternal life there's only one form of eternal life that is Jesus Christ amen there's no two types of life there's only one form of life eternal life so what about the privation poverty means is trying to imitate the original but it's not original it just like the virus that before our skin bacteria James coronavirus is not a reject creation of God Guardian creed virus but is a demonic life-form and Israel they trying to manifest lightly with Jesus Christ manifest as a gem of life but they are not able so they bring death and please and disease and harm an infection of a mankind so the only life the truest life is Jesus Christ and that is who you are amen you are no different from Jesus Christ let's Rican a description of got a lot of scriptures blessed be the name of the Lord let's read second Corinthians five one and seven second Corinthians five one and seven and we go from there blessed be the name of the Lord second Corinthians chapter five verse one and seven for we know that if our earthly houses of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a high we have a burden of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens we're seven for we walk by faith not by sight amen for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have we already have a house not that you are going to have but you have it now amen and house not made with hands it's not a house your dad and your mom make it's not this house that we live in no but it's a real house in China in heavens China in the dimension amen decide in Heaven's heavens represent the seas dimension the space we are living in and the church the church is heaven as well so we have this eternal life in us that is the life that is the true you amen so we won't talk about few funny the absolute the believers absolute so let's give a little background about the wealthy funny if you go to the scriptures you never find anywhere slide too funny it's not even in the Bible but then it was injected into Christianity to explain the celestial body the word body so you came from two different weights few and funny few means the Oh God funny means made visible amen whew is invisible Elohim who was way in the heavens and nothing can approach him but any wanted to become visible on to mankind to come into a shadow form as we read in Psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty he wanted to have a salacious second dimensional manifestation so he has to put here to protect himself from that seventh dimensional being into the six dimensional RAM which is recall heaven the believers position not in the future but now amen if you know your position you know that have got Christ in you you've got heaven in you you've got rapture in you you are resurrected already you have got everything that you need is right at you amen you have got a new path you have got eternal life you have got Redemption you are now not going to have it's already I'm a bird by Jack which last last week he said is we are be even beyond faith it's not something I have to struggle I need to struggle to do it I haven't got that fit that I'm struggling no is what it's a clear statement of the Lord you don't have nothing to do with you just accept accepted just like Mary Mary it was prophesied Mary was just working and he behold he met a man is that our highly favored before God okay I cannot take that and feel it praise God Alleluia but any good have a son what have a son how what I talking about I'm just only engage have a son say well how having only a man so how do I have a son is that a son that is not going to be new in man is good by the spoken word of God that's what I'm doing to you and say yeah let it be according to your word so you have to even fight it she ought to just believe it because they declare statement of the Lord you don't have to struggle you don't have to I mean we products which are distension we do all this sin but to be frank with you it is not a deceiving you people can be in the house didn't go nowhere nobody contacted they just got sick who has the best protection that priests chassé chassé of England is your doctor better than doctors that are taking co-princes is your health advice is better than his health advices do you have the best doctors like and the wife of Edward Everett can a Canadian president what's his name - do we have the best health care light reduce wife but he was she was tested positive it doesn't mean they're bad people it doesn't mean to put up a test positive I can test positive I can die but I'm using the word of God to explain something to you to let you know who you are Amen that even in the mists of all the best when the best aid the trans team medical team is that one of the news I was watching said I'll be frank with you I don't even know what is gonna happen tomorrow we're just trying to do so that we can bring down the cliff down if rid of infection and they're free down but I cannot tell you what more is gonna be it's beyond human control is something in the air amen there are four forces for element a lot uses the earth water fire and air that is a natural element but now there's a supernatural aspect of that the air is not just the wind that they're blowing the air type the spirit the fire is the force of cleansing the earth is people water is people so the Lord is using his fire of cleansing there's a spirit in the in the spiritual realm that you cannot see physically but it was strike you just like the Holy Ghost strike you and before realized right in another world so Who am I my goodness I'm seen angels I'm see the supernatural my dreams have changed I'm a new person why because life has tricking you but on that on the on the flip side there's death going around striking people because mankind will not accept his creator mankind will not to connect his creator when Indians when you go to the Indian tribe in the olden days when a child is born they don't train a child for us to speak the training phase to be silent and design around because they had tribe our enemies this tribe want to concatenate because there's water here this I have what you call it grass for animals and stuff like that there's a lot of corn here so tribe won't move from the microphone please please so if we see this attribute he can kill them fight so they trained a child how to design from your heart listen quietly do you hear noise around listen from your heart so India's I wanna preach or naturally speaking spiritual people I think was it John Wesley he came to in his time he came to a United State here Georgie and part of the sudden police and Italy Indian camps he said after he pretty said oh who converted me because he had things from the Indians spirit returned from the Indians who didn't read Bible because they were connected to create to the Great Creator the Griz spirit and that is what God want us to do not just their forms of church but you be connected to him now he's living in you if you have been accepted with the new after accept impressed you have to open your heart unto Him Lord have me all amen but if you have accepted him now you have to open your ears yo spectra is and hear him speak to your voice comforting words to you that be not afraid be not afraid because I'm the one in control is not a demon of coronavirus no it's Jesus Christ come true the spirit of death is just fulfilling a part of the Word of God and when there was a time that I had to die the Lord called who do this for me and a Bible say there was a demon of life is there Lord send me I'll go it wasn't Michael it wasn't gay bro it wasn't well mood but it was a demon he said how I could go Israel be a lying spirit in the false prophet and of course funny prophet they

least amen the list if you are not nothing oh I don't have any position in the church you've got a position you're a prayer warrior amen I'm not entangled I'm not ready Jack I don't have to be preaching and going about preaching no you can your priority but you have to preach here and other places amen so when you pray because the deity of Christ is in you because we've got a few funny Jesus Christ in you when you pray is not even with the ways that I come in is somebody in you bringing their prayers so I've been a pastor preach and pray about things that the a certain time people write a requests but sometimes it can come in pray and preach things that his mental mind doesn't know that maybe somebody's going through this but as Pettis peasants is not added at the end know that oh lord thank you you break into tears you touch my situation because she prayed before she came and the Lord put up on the pastor's hat the preachers had to speak but I've got a daughter she's running through this problem that ever was battling her with fear with sickness she's got a little sore throat and Haitians are running wild and you speak a word that was through your heart knowing that all is well amen because where it had not been amen blessed be the name of the Lord glory hallelujah to the Lord you are Atena amen always put that one in your heart that the dimension is right here heaven is right here so it's the sins are here only there's a little veil and as we keep progressing the gospel the Lord is breaking the veil is becoming more clearer and clearer and clearer so don't depend don't let your life depend upon institutions of mankind what do I mean don't depend upon first times are great jobs are good we do that business are great economics are great just name them shops are great Amazon is awesome we use them everyone just named them iPhones whatever named em vehicles they are great but they are not Atena those systems are man-made and if Corona can shatter them just a little demon a lot of virus can shatter all the system the last time I had a news they would say that 10 million be part of a out of job they are going on they applying for F what benefit 10 million and then Emma's going to skyrocket so and now they want us to to to what you call it to add social distancing and as I was watching the TV not if you have an award from Internet I don't have to be in my house so let me explain it better i watch everything from here i can go to youtube and watch can go to our phone our own SOT I know I don't have time when I was a kid god I don't know why I will be deviating my niche I don't like things that are very peaceful person as my nature that's with a lot made me so I don't like movies that someone in my nature when I was a kid I remember the Musa Allah Oliver Twist something sintra simple she's PA I don't like those what that will run my mind world so I was watching the new CNN or some way and what was I lost my thoughts I was talking about oh people a demo people data on going sucia distance not what I planned for a benefit and now they've got their mask alright but India in touch with each other in front of the benefit office multitude of people look at human institutions we are supposed products which are distancing but now people won't benefit so now they are close to each other I mean just right into each other so what the switch are distancing institutions of man who feel if you put your trust in them in America in whatever nation is going to fail you but not a lot is called everybody home from within you it's not just the house but home go in what 10 in what yourself the lot is not doing away with a micro macro is going to mock my crew is going a man you'd from the he that is in you the fearfully the Holy Ghost in you he's going to work for you he's going to speak footing on your table when your resources are depleted don't run wild don't panic if your job is gone don't panic the Lord has put something he is in you you can put money before your door absently before I woke up one time there's money in front of my door pick it I need a $20.00 applicate I run into money sometimes they just the Lord can do whatever he needs to do for you whatever be they need and that's what God has put us in this before so all that means whenever you believe the message is it wasn't in vain maybe you don't have everything that you are asking for but Allah to give you everything that you need and things that you are asking for it's already in you the lot is bring them out just like a tree keep drinking that water as you drink the water the tree is bringing flowers maybe the trees they don't see the flowers it will see fruit on the tree but you keep watching the plant keep letting sign shall expose it to sunshine the sunshine of the word of the Lord keep listening to the word keep praying keep doing what you're doing to more you see flowers on the tree oh wow I can see flowers now now the fruit are coming you've got see the same thing God put us here maybe you are not Brahma said that I'm not what I'm supposed to be I'm not where I want to be but I'm not where I used to be so I'm actually progressed I'm in the genie maybe no no first we say that I am exactly where I wish I'm here as long as you're a human being you always want to be somewhere more than you you are presently ah which is normal God made us that way but that doesn't take away that God has done something for you amen so what in your steadfastness let it feel funny in you manifest himself we don't know a time will come that women even get this opportunity to meet here and all the ways that you've had from their pockets you read from the message the tips that is going to keep you if a little virus can keep all of us which are the stansson stay at home do this what about if something more more ways than that metallic bomb comes that you can't even do nothing or the economies are shot what one government system one world system is in u.s. economy doesn't work China doesn't hold room takeover robots got all the gold now we are going to do gold papers are not washed rivers are not working so let's do goat all the good in Africa I'm going to put them together and use that one as a currency or chip they put some microchip what I going to do then he that is in you would take over amen so God Allah bless you and don't be afraid stay in your step pray use your prayer book this is a time and then do all that we've been taught to do your social distancing and others and do them wash your hands but don't let be a fear let the Holy Spirit in you have his own way because this he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world blessed be the name of the Lord shall we pray Heavenly Father we thank you for such a time we thank you for your broken words into our hearts Lord God you've added author of eternal life you put yourself in us your dinners for this very hour you said you'd be with
