offended by the truth but you know they family I mean whether we just have the problems a lot of water under the bridge and the special thing I like to just bring out this afternoon or evening I remember about at first started making while way back to the laws because he never left me with me that left him a man and in my heart you know I knew I was where I should have been at where I was supposed to be and I will share testimony but like I would a teacher they stay away from church because I always know when I get caught up and then annoyed Manny goes hence I would be riding a chronic bubbling and yeah sure I came here and I said right after couple sitting right there with sister ways and I see and my brother Justin is reaching Oh y'all know be humble cry because I will cry I will

just truly grateful and I'm going to be real brief we got to preach it but I'm just gonna hear something the globe put on my heart and many of you grab your Bibles and then y'all pray for me and man we're going to take a little scripture from Matthew 11 the eleventh verse revealing you to watch the wizard pull the small distance which really I see them to you among them that are born of a woman they had not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force a man let us turn our scripture to Luke 16:16 move 16 chapter xvi purse not a sane passage of scripture Matthew just wrote there Luke saw it a little bit different and he said it on this rise the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it may the Lord that a blessing to the reading of his word maybe Bob is most gracious Heavenly Father Oh God I come before you right now Lord I ask you to just take control of it I yield this vessel to you O God use it as you will settle my nerves or both that the people may be saying something maybe save to encourage strengthen Lord God let me help building into a key man Oh God Jesus precious name I pray amen we see here that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force and Luke Samuel didn't say the gospel the kingdom of God is preached and every man must press very into a man we all those that have agreed to embark upon its journey a man has taken all the mindset that we're going to leave it for Christ but along the way of Watchmen at times where were demons thrown out floozy alula vigor full of excitement as we delve into something new we start to realize that it's going to be bad that Saint was not going to make it easy for yes sir the kingdom of God is pressed into to be pressed to let us know that there's going to be some resistance a man but my desire is to live in the kingdom of Almighty God for there to be a kingdom a man that have to be a king Christ is that king and the question is is he ruling and reigning in your mother's remember it must be pressed into I like to title this message confronting the opposition a man confronting the opposition we have an opponent amen and we've learned how to plan an evening clip of moment you have to study your opponent yeah it went see where his weaknesses live to see his his habits yeah so that you can be prepared amen in the back and we see that this adversary a man has been saying he in this family long time and with our whole strength under our own abilities with a match for because he's been in a long time but we have a secret weapon that weapon is so secret but we have to be able to yield as him because the hours so not these thoughts and our ladies so we have to give our sales amen we have to relearn how to fight and then we commit we don't know how to fight his back naturally before they send a young man what is called a basic training and that training they strip away everything that he thought so make him look real soldier and then breaking it down a man he has to lose he is the malla soldier they call soldiers in the army Jack we diminish you no longer young you know sergeant all of the commands to do something you say sir yes sir but I'm here to let you know that we are Jesus he's preparing us for amen when the word says to do something we say so yes [Applause] now entering into this position there are things you passed you have to be wanted to let go oh yeah oh man you have to be willing to accept the mind of Christ you have to be and what willing to accept the changes now that God is making in this out amen you have to be able to deny yourself a man we fight the good fight of faith let us turn quickly here you know what I'm sorry we don't like to turn this yet save man first Timothy 6:12 16 they made us turn a man love the Lord and man bear with me I'm going somewhere won't be before you there breathe really come on but I tell you what if the Lord willing and maybe it'll be good warmed up yeah [Music] [Music] 26:12 we fight the good fight of faith a man yes sir lay hold on eternal life once and are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses I give the charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that you keep this commandment without spot unreviewable until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so a man who said we have to press into this kingdom a brain Hebrews 4:11 let us labor therefore let any man shall fall unto the same example a man Philippians 3 for the ps3 a man you know sequel into Philippians Philippians the third chapter finally my brother in rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed does not Grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the conscience we know [Applause] God is with a man the circle side of the first I hope circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews and touching the law of the Farsi to certain zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in their loveliness but what things were gain to me those I kind of lost for Christ they dollars and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I suffered the loss of all things and do count them but they meant for the things that that was seen here the big man he lost he had to give up I have to change my whole mindset to change things done that I'm a man amen for Jesus Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is not the law but that which is through the faith of Jesus Christ the righteousness which is it which is of God by faith then that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and in the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable on today is by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained even were already 4% perfect but I follow after it after it is then I might that I've made backward we write that for which also I'm after him oh Jesus Christ then I cannot myself to have apprehended but this one thing I ever forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth and to low speeds which is all over the block and the prize of the high calling in Christ he was busted and then I missed walked the halls of the hawk home which is in Christ Jesus hey man hey man see this is finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of us was mighty Amen that word finally in some commentaries they say the word would be from the home we're gonna be in a battle from that Amen it's not forgetting the easy listen about the devil he don't sleep right you don't slow down the job when you're taking a break please fly against you it's a battle that must be waged all the time amen he say be strong in low you have to understand that when you get into this valley you can't rely on your own strength you have to rely on the strength of the low anything this fellow in the whole nother thing that know about being strong is when you're training and lifting and work it out it must [Music] [Music] remember with the fridge in the opposition we went high as her ella movie passed by [Music] the preaching and Jesus being a mother being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan that was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days neither eat nothing and when he were Indian Africa he after a hundred and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command these stones that if he made bread jesus answered him and say it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and the devil taking him up into all the kingdoms and showing up show unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil say unto Him all this power idea of thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I would I would give a doubt therefore what worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt not serve and he brought him to Jesus to Jerusalem and set him upon a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast myself down from him for it is written not he tellin him with the words but it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee completely and their hands shall bear thee up lest thou dash thy foot against a stone and jesus answered and said unto Him he said thou shalt not kill the world of that God and when the devil had ended all his temptations he departed from him for a season and Jesus returned in how of the Spirit of the Galilee now he was laid full of the Holy Ghost but after the contention after overcoming he listened power of the Spirit you see he went in and he heard and he went through these bad Satan knew just will attack Jesus a first of all and he didn't and he didn't Jesus what was the rain has he [Applause] what okay you want to have the power in your life you have to leave Costa you have to overcome the temptations press the battery and then begin an ending of the Gentile dispensation this is e 1355 zero one zero not a man now before you can have a victory there has to be a banner and if that's our balance there are no losers so we ought to be thankful for the balance and the tribe it's God giving us an opportunity to have victories Oh [Applause] so the opposition David had confidence and put the Lord had done and being here after the temptations after the ruling experimental trial he left it had any men with us do two things we must listen and put on today's something that we have to do we must lay aside all the scene away today so easily resolved and we must put home the hello goes up anything to go into battle hey John 13:35 says a new commandment I give you love one another as I have loved you so you must love one another and by this everyone will know that you are my disciple that I love I you love one another and this is a commandment a man had remembered up we need an army and when God gives a commandment you say truly certain right amen amen indicating men in power and demonstration Amen so the Lord a man has has given us the victory we must realize that in this goodness goodness goodness in his time we all must go through some it may we all must press persevere amen through to speak our crostini and there's so many people think it's not a babies and then but you have to be tested you have to be tested to control every in power and then in demonstration and then of the Holy Ghost lot of times you think that the gospel is preached and quoted only a man but is preached in demonstration and power of the Holy Spirit amen we are written epistle reading on me so they are not going to love you to these for all sanity's wing [Applause] we accept the challenge even the kingdom of God is with you amen amen and we're in a bag and then the letters BAM then I have another cool good get out of your way amen this time of the people this is the time that God said therefore come to me he shook top sign at one time but they're coming shaking again he wouldn't always shake I'm sorry man but he'd shake everything that who even 12 18 and 26 but did you notice the rest of the scripture when we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved amen remember to keep invisible day you follow everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will be shaken the earth will shake heaven and earth will pass away but the word shall never pass away for upon this rock I'll reveal my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it everything that can be shook will be shaken but it was we receive a kingdom which is the word of God himself and God is in his word he does shake himself o'mine he doesn't shake he doesn't shake himself amen oh my but we received the kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable and they made Paul the right see a man so let us expand and a man I hope then something was said if I could pray something out amen I just realized that a man is Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence in the visor we no longer running from that we're not afraid of signals but we accept about we accept the challenge and we press into it which means that there's going to be some positions there going to be some times when a man you get a little oh you don't want to do with a man but that's just the adversary we have to press a little bride Prince a man through all of the month Omar tomorrow amen and then I'm thinking of a scripture now that I thought I had written now as they consider a medal it how we press through d'marie a man at all of the swamp a man has come up in just a man be blessed by [Music] Oh [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] actually in spiritually so musicians I was sitting there thinking as they were singing we give and have a la fontaine family come down for a concert here career other the rest goes and I'm sit here thank you Lord all of this talent undermines me we need to have us in two words but you know we just I just I just I feel blessed [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you they bring us something that encourages edifies we just pray to follow the tenderness continue to take it deep down in the holy spirit continue to we just appreciate it more than just his efforts to drink just a little to take control of our clocks I'm worried somebody say something every other parts at night we appreciate you follow things there's no tonight Amen let's get our bottles out tonight it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight we appreciate from the jet we were planning on these hot sure you wasn't gonna do anything tonight and no Jack swung by and preach for us after his cousin's wedding and one man tell you what increase the masterpiece that's undergone man one thing I could see bring Jack never cease to amaze and after that we're here by the grace of God 21 would return to appreciate the Saints the way would make for my church trusting God richly bless you for just coming out and being supported we are born in there together Detroit Jack and we kind of we got a toughness about us but we also kind of emotional guy so Gaza my hat's off to you a true and I trusted God just continue to bless the things that he's given you I was just thinking that God doesn't take something from you and not giving something back and even though he took he took his brother Mike and took brother Roosevelt I just look around and see what let us let us read the scripture the night a little slow but we all started the 18th verse did I tell you what I had a wonderful morning and I just trusted me up kind of spill over but I'm different than what I preached this morning a different subject altogether but I preached this at home and I thought this would be a blessing for tonight the 81st Matthew 21 sis now in the morning as he he returned to the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only insanity let no fruit grown be henceforth forever and presently the fig tree with little weight and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away and jesus answered and said unto them verily i said to you if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if he shall said to this mountain be thou removed and be are cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever he accent fret believe you ever see a little of that a blessing - it's going to make a big seed just got a real our subject tonight I say his word I want to use also like this spring so y'all just follow me because we ministers will be differently we kind of think different but as a little context the ministry taking you forward I realized something that we're entering into a new year can I get a witness man and you know I often times and you know and work with people trying to make sure that people understand what's what's happening this is not just church it's not just it's not just coming to a building and gathering together looking good and smelling Google Talk all right but but that's not that's not really what this is all about I don't think that rosette preaches was Hill so I know things that we can do for help but but I believe that we we have a golden there's an abyss er a method if we say it like this to the man sometimes y'all think we doesn't go crazy but we don't pray hi we're trying to bring the church into see look you watch ministry today we we try to put it all in the spirit of it is run I'm alright I will pull up a glass for the reason I do a by the blue sword otherwise think that I'm looking at but I like you I think you know a lot of time you realize that that people aren't really comprehending what you're actually doing and what what true Christian don't is really all about right a lot of times people who think that is just coming to the building and just being a part of a gathering the thing for that nature but really that's not a far cry from what this is really all about truth was alluded to it's about being instructed yeah right is about instructions in and trying to bring you it to and then what God has for you right and to show you how to operate a certain way yeah see in this passage of scripture what we find is we find Jesus totally different from his disciple it was the world a certain way right right the fact that Jesus could speak a word right and and see the demise of the is this individual with Jesus Jesus gave practice but you understand right the fact that I've done this see you the things that you see P do you're gonna do that's right right that's right amen all the information all right I look at things that I think about things all right right right right but this is where [Music] [Applause] he was Jesus when are you guys gonna operate from the place they put this house move all with just knew that but the Drina journey with his disciples we're trying to instruct all right right to instruct I told them deck in the back I said justice because this is two or three message because this important force to see these things take time well I can see but say you know my nose you pick it up right listen it is a question that says now French scientists said less than 300 years ago if a man whenever make a terrific speed up $30,000 gravitation taken from the earth 30 miles an hour well do you think this signs will refer back far being no sir they haven't gone ten hundred miles an hour or something in a rocket 1600 miles an hour still taking him for yeah right I wanna stop with just one we have got to continue to move and we going miss them and we're wondering why we must get in the results in cinemas a constantly going backwards instead of going forward you want the watch ministry see my castle I'm going back doing the first work over right we gotta be a people that's that's moving moving Oh ugly that's what I'm doing trying to take people forward right manifested plot right okay y'all still with Sciences this is right science is constantly progressing what about it see say it has taken man forward muffled grated things with his mind then what and that's the only thing he has is the tree eating from the tree of knowledge right with his intellect when I got married I call this bottle everything was separate right yeah yeah that tux was we needed if you had a cell phone only the rich the dope deals and sales right right hey man but eat from this tree right has taken all right I just kind of say it right further than the ministers taken him with this to think that science being from the tree of knowledge of good and evil has taken foot further and we would diminish peak watch this now feeding from the tree of life oh you know we eat right yes born again children of God right you're eating like the first Adam from the tree alive exactly see you got a new way you got to know what you're doing Sam right anyway what to think that ministers right we should be firm up the room see hey Ben she tripped on the frame of it the biggest was taken up with the spirit which is funny see what this is [Music] [Music] it's from this tree right right the Tree of Life was priced then we will if we eat from we gotta realize something church we're dealing with super neck right we must recognize we're we're natural supernatural beings if that makes sense right right to the flesh he said you know doing the work I can something is greater than what you say I see so we're moving slow Church we're not going back right see do you know do you know what it means to go backwards to go back does it means you go back to Bali did you go back to be natural people not being color you know [Applause] these things don't walk like this it's not enough meaning you know we always look brother Brown trying to show us now what is he said when the brothers see the baptism of the holy ghost right and that's it for see the Baptist but a Holy Ghost oh no way right you're you're not entitled to it you can cry you can scream you can do whatever you want to do you gotta get the person of Christ in you right - too late crazy so anything that they were preaching definitive he says when the grounds were see the Baptist they said this is the Sun that means the high speed it's not it just get started right this is all of it but he said but Herman that's wrong there's no summer to empower keep moving as fast enough possible can see okay watch this Peter say we go backwards no he said we move on right we move on and we will move on it's funny in infinite resources of dog that has never been tapped real powerful statement but also when we hear that's taken if we've been around soul oh right it just automakers plenty more like Oh God right this is funding the resource of God is not meat app yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about right now then we go nothing we spit it all out our on all stuff instead of instead of iterating through and manifesting what Jesus sitting supposed to manifest right glory to God hey man see oh he said it's just a blessing the pilot we know looking back it's never been even think about it never even been revealed offering right it's very just the hit for the church that we read this is literally huh see when God is trying to bring us see if we go back to Adam listen Adam Dominion so you would charge you must son you in charge right right I'm following it all but this little spot your little you know human charges with it right he had to buy new parts [Music] see even even the movie wasn't a common move that move was because that's not trying to show us what what's laying before the church the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not the Sun the hardest thing see we don't want to make members because we will be Church walk around say first of all right to the place and position that they ought to see that's right when according to the book of Acts chapter 2 with the speaker Vegas PD says I hate that one man some great preacher I like to say stand up here preacher we kind of see on the back that make him something so you know right [Applause] [Music] you should testify that you know this morning they have their own business [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you got those things now jesus never w advice that would walk you right into wait seemed like we would get anything from historical spam we reach a historical a historical Jesus historical events we look back to you know we have to look back look God's called you to this that we who are Queenie the supernatural will just take the man where man in his senses is hitman two key senses right natural but your supernatural being right and see if you operate in your senses limit that you'll never be able to feel the word of God right because you will stumble and all the stumbling blocks of the death see we were clean with the supernatural just take a man in his [Music] we're moving forward it takes to move you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but he said and his right you see the tree of knowledge can only climb so far we gotta go beyond that right she says watch this and then it breaks back I'm just wondering I'm kind of wondering what is more people feeling from the tree of knowledge than the Tree of Life to so many people the brick start to break back instead of going forward into this place where there's four Ribbit's - I wonder can I take like this see Oh it'll be all right yes you think about right Hale a bit because if this man is spirit you'll ruin for your moving it to melt right you moving into all things [Music] something's wrong with people of great big back then which see the tree of knowledge - only crime so far it breaks back watch this but the tree from the tree we're going on with with with Internet - this place of maturity we enter in this place where there's no read in that's right I'm gonna believe that you gotta know what tree that you eat right and the Tree of Life will say this right quick it's not a perverted truth right come on it's a tree wait with the original fruits of God Yogi's in love the original word right I'm leaving home to think about and see okay he said right back but the tree of life goes on forever and how that science has taken man father ways [Music] [Applause] we try not to allow [Applause] [Applause] see that the devil is almost like we all kind of church we gonna have a big time tonight Yeah right yeah okay I'm Tim right now I must be Tommy [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] right people catch things that are spiritual small is going on you know turn to third person number a few copies an account I called poly 180 kids down
