[4:06] amen God know exactly what he doing I
[4:10] know the the weather's not favorable but
[4:12] we are trusting the Lord just to keep us
[4:14] amen here I want to read a man of
[4:17] scripture uh Psalm 91 to open the
[4:20] service and anytime we have uh weather
[4:24] like this we always turn to the word of
[4:27] the Lord and we Comfort ourselves in
[4:30] what God has promised us amen he's a God

[4:49] Psalm 91 says this is he that dwelleth
[4:51] in the secret place of the most high
[4:55] shall abide under the shadow of the
[4:57] Almighty I will save the Lord he is my
[5:00] refuge and my Fortress my God and him
[5:03] will I trust
[5:05] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[5:07] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[5:09] and pestilence he shall cover thee with
[5:12] his feathers and under his wings shalt
[5:14] thou trust his truth shall be thy shield
[5:17] and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for
[5:21] the terror by night nor for the arrow
[5:24] that flyeth by day nor for the
[5:28] pestilence that walketh in darkness Norm
[5:30] for the destruction that wasteth at
[5:33] Noonday a thousand
[5:35] shall fall at thy sight and ten thousand
[5:39] at thy right hand but it shall not come

[6:07] refuge even the most high the habitation
[6:10] there shall no evil befall thee neither

[8:18] there were some witch doctors that were
[8:20] causing a storm to come up father where
[8:21] the meetings were and brother random say
[8:23] he told The Interpreter don't interpret
[8:25] this but he began to rebuke that storm
[8:28] and father we we rebuked the storm right
[8:30] now in the name of Jesus glory to God
[8:33] father not just where where we are but
[8:36] wherever the bride of Christ has
[8:37] gathered we rebuked the storm right now
[8:39] in the name of Jesus Lord that we would
[8:42] worship you in spirit and we will
[8:43] worship you in truth father just commit
[8:46] the service into your hands bless the
[8:48] Saints Lord that have made it those that
[8:49] are still on the way give traveling
[8:51] mercies to God those that are joining
[8:53] online bless them where they are God and

[31:44] we're dealing with that they're dealing
[31:46] with next slide
[31:47] and this one

[31:55] on in it
[31:58] um and this this is a video of they're
[32:00] still doing uh going through some

[32:04] um so
[32:07] okay like that
[32:41] okay so that's just that's another

[33:14] um I think let me show some of it but
[33:16] what what was happening here is they
[33:19] lost everything pretty much right and so
[33:22] the families didn't have food didn't
[33:25] have anything and so we were had the
[33:29] opportunity
[33:30] to support the families there
[33:34] um I think it was like 100 would support
[33:36] a family right so what we sent we sent

[41:45] continue their virtual prayer
[41:48] um on Tuesday at 7 30 and they were
[41:50] telling me
[41:51] about
[41:52] um one of the
[41:55] ladies that was prayed for I believe it
[41:57] was a co-worker of sister Virginia's uh
[42:00] she was prayed for God healed her and
[42:04] she came back on this on the sister's
[42:06] prayer line to give thanks you know just
[42:08] give an update and uh ever since that
[42:10] time she gave things she's also been
[42:12] connected uh to the sister's prayer and
[42:16] uh it's just good to see that this is
[42:17] just kind of going uh outside of just
[42:20] where we are and I know sometimes you
[42:22] know uh many have said we can't wait
[42:24] till we can get our own building come
[42:26] back and pray uh in the building I think
[42:28] that's good but let's let's not detract
[42:30] from what's going on here virtually
[42:32] because we're reaching people that we
[42:33] probably would have never met uh reached
[42:36] before you know so we thank God for uh
[42:38] what is happening here through the
[42:40] virtual prayer and and sister started
[42:42] this off years ago and other brothers
[42:45] finally got on board and got behind it
[42:48] um you know and and we're doing ours

[1:04:41] amen let us go over to
[1:04:44] judges a man the sixth chapter will
[1:04:47] start to take a little reading from the
[1:04:49] first verse
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:57] y'all pray for me
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:05] and it reads uh and the children of

[1:05:12] and the Lord delivered them into the
[1:05:16] hand of Midian
[1:05:19] seven years
[1:05:21] and the Hand of Midian prevailed against
[1:05:25] Israel
[1:05:26] and because of the midianites the
[1:05:30] children of Israel made them dens
[1:05:33] which are in the mountains and caves and
[1:05:37] strongholds may the Lord add a blessing
[1:05:40] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:05:42] seated
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:46] this morning
[1:05:50] oh my we want to
[1:05:52] take a title
[1:05:54] a man from the prison house
[1:05:58] to the Palace
[1:06:01] from the prison
[1:06:03] to the Palace amen
[1:06:06] and uh
[1:06:09] we see here
[1:06:11] if we continue right here on the on in
[1:06:14] in second Corinthians
[1:06:16] amen uh
[1:06:19] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:06:23] and verse 10 say therefore I take
[1:06:26] pleasure
[1:06:27] and infirmities
[1:06:29] reproaches in necessities and
[1:06:33] persecutions in distress for Christ's
[1:06:37] sake
[1:06:37] you see we often
[1:06:39] uh discouraged by all of these negative
[1:06:42] things that come about in our lives
[1:06:45] but we think uh that uh for us to be
[1:06:50] victorious amen we have to uh uh uh be
[1:06:55] strong and not have trials
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:59] you see but because
[1:07:01] uh uh of of these things amen the Lord
[1:07:05] is working out his perfect will
[1:07:08] in our lives
[1:07:10] amen so in order to be strong Paul
[1:07:15] teaches us that sometimes
[1:07:17] we have to
[1:07:19] not rely on our human abilities
[1:07:25] we have to rely on God's ability amen
[1:07:30] sometimes as people we begin to rely too
[1:07:33] much on our own ability
[1:07:35] and uh when we do that sometime we miss
[1:07:39] step
[1:07:40] and and and and and and and and we get
[1:07:43] ourselves in God's way here
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:48] so we're going to be taking our text
[1:07:49] this morning amen we're going to be
[1:07:51] typing here uh uh uh and judges we see
[1:07:54] where the the middle uh uh Israel had
[1:07:57] gotten themselves in in quite a pickle
[1:07:59] got themselves in trouble and uh uh uh
[1:08:03] we'll we'll see as we go on into the
[1:08:06] message here how how uh uh the
[1:08:09] midianites had came and and got them in
[1:08:11] bondage
[1:08:13] hey man I want you to pay close
[1:08:15] attention to that word bondage
[1:08:17] amen because bondage amen is a form of
[1:08:21] being in prison
[1:08:24] amen can I preach this morning
[1:08:26] and and and we see that
[1:08:29] um this types A lot of uh of today
[1:08:33] many people are in prison
[1:08:37] amen and uh the sad thing about it is
[1:08:42] they don't know it all right all right
[1:08:45] amen y'all pray for me amen
[1:08:48] so we see hearing judges it says that
[1:08:50] judges 14 the six after the Lord looked
[1:08:53] upon and said
[1:08:55] go in this thy might
[1:08:58] Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of
[1:09:01] the minute night so he's talking to
[1:09:02] Gideon here wow okay
[1:09:06] I have have not I sent thee
[1:09:10] God has sent a prophet to
[1:09:13] that generation
[1:09:15] amen and he sent the prophet to this
[1:09:18] generation because see we will uh uh in
[1:09:21] prison
[1:09:27] amen and and uh we needed to come out of
[1:09:30] bondage amen
[1:09:32] so the 16th uh verse here says and the
[1:09:37] Lord said unto him surely
[1:09:40] I will be with thee and thou shall Smite
[1:09:43] the midianite says one man
[1:09:47] see when the Lord is fighting in your
[1:09:50] state see the midianites had a great
[1:09:52] Army
[1:09:53] they were they they was a a mini number
[1:09:57] but he said that I would fight with you
[1:09:58] and they would be as one
[1:10:01] man all right amen
[1:10:04] so uh
[1:10:08] I want to
[1:10:13] look at the word here
[1:10:16] we we in the scripture there it says
[1:10:19] that uh
[1:10:24] that the power of Christ May rest upon
[1:10:27] them
[1:10:28] therefore I take pleasure
[1:10:31] in infirmities
[1:10:33] uh in the reproaches Necessities
[1:10:36] persecution
[1:10:37] amen and distresses for Christ's sake
[1:10:41] now
[1:10:42] I want to uh if we take a take our time
[1:10:46] here to kind of build up instead of
[1:10:48] platform amen
[1:10:51] we want to take and sort of delve into
[1:10:54] this word just a little bit pleasure
[1:10:59] I'm I'm gonna take this off because I
[1:11:01] feel a little constricted
[1:11:03] I tried to keep it on my wife said you
[1:11:06] keep the coat on
[1:11:08] I tried
[1:11:10] I can't preacher I think thank you bro
[1:11:14] I got to come out the coat
[1:11:17] hope that's okay
[1:11:18] amen but we look at the word Joy
[1:11:23] sometimes we can lose our joy along the
[1:11:26] journey
[1:11:29] amen the Devil comes to
[1:11:33] kill steal
[1:11:35] and destroy
[1:11:37] amen he comes to take our joy
[1:11:42] so the dictionary meaning of the word
[1:11:45] Joy is a Feeling
[1:11:47] of great pleasure
[1:11:50] and happiness
[1:11:52] the emotion
[1:11:55] evoked by well-being success
[1:11:58] or good fortune
[1:12:01] by a prospect of uh uh possessing what
[1:12:06] one desires amen are you with me
[1:12:10] that brings an experience of great
[1:12:13] pleasure
[1:12:16] Joy is an inward emotion of our spirit
[1:12:21] it is a Feeling
[1:12:23] that we all love to experience
[1:12:27] and it's it is actually something that
[1:12:29] God has designed for us
[1:12:33] to have remained in US
[1:12:36] and that this Joy
[1:12:38] might be full amen
[1:12:41] amen amen
[1:12:43] every normal human being on the earth
[1:12:45] desires to be happy
[1:12:48] and have their lives filled with joy
[1:12:51] peace contentment
[1:12:55] and so they're all of their desires
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:01] this is why
[1:13:03] the more pleasure
[1:13:05] no let me back it up miss something very
[1:13:07] important there
[1:13:09] in the human heart
[1:13:12] there is a deep that God placed in the
[1:13:15] human spirit that can only be satisfied
[1:13:18] by another deep only God can truly
[1:13:22] Supply
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:26] so this is why uh uh uh we find that the
[1:13:30] devil amen
[1:13:33] he comes against the joy the true Joy
[1:13:38] and would give you a substitute
[1:13:42] amen that you think is joy
[1:13:46] come on
[1:13:48] he will give you a substitute a man of
[1:13:52] pleasure amen that is not godly pleasure
[1:13:57] but it is a worldly pleasure
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:03] so we see here amen that
[1:14:07] Satan is also handing out pleasure all
[1:14:10] right
[1:14:13] the Bible talks about the pleasure of
[1:14:16] sin
[1:14:18] is death
[1:14:21] see sin
[1:14:22] is pleasurable
[1:14:24] but it has a baggage connected to it
[1:14:28] that is death
[1:14:31] see
[1:14:32] but God didn't just didn't want you to
[1:14:35] be have not pleasure he has provided
[1:14:38] ultimate pleasure but sometimes we get a
[1:14:42] little bit confused on what pleasure
[1:14:44] really is
[1:14:49] Psalm 16 and 11 says Thou shalt show me
[1:14:52] the past of life
[1:14:54] God reveals to you
[1:14:57] that he has your pathway all mapped out
[1:15:01] yeah and if we go on there in 16 Psalm
[1:15:04] 16 11 she says that will show you the
[1:15:07] path of life and in thy presence is the
[1:15:11] fullness of joy
[1:15:13] and at thy right hand there are
[1:15:16] Pleasures forevermore
[1:15:20] amen
[1:15:22] so we see here amen that God desires you
[1:15:26] to have pleasure okay he designed your
[1:15:30] body in such a way amen that you can
[1:15:33] experience pleasure
[1:15:36] all right amen the human body is
[1:15:38] designed in such a way that uh uh at
[1:15:42] experiences of pleasure there are
[1:15:45] certain reactions that happen within
[1:15:48] your body
[1:15:49] all right amen the scientists looked
[1:15:52] into it and they've named these
[1:15:53] different things they are called
[1:15:55] dopamines and pheromones and these kind
[1:15:58] of things go to popping amen and and and
[1:16:01] and when we are in an experience of
[1:16:03] exuberant pleasure
[1:16:07] your body and everything sort of
[1:16:10] responds Amen to the way you feel and
[1:16:13] all I love to feel pleasure
[1:16:16] man when something good happens to us
[1:16:19] amen we can't fight the smile that comes
[1:16:22] upon our faith we can't fight the
[1:16:25] feeling that we feel within our heart
[1:16:27] and all we just so happy
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] Bible says in Revelation the fourth
[1:16:38] chapter 11th verse
[1:16:39] Thou Art Worthy of Lord
[1:16:43] worthy O Lord to receive glory honor and
[1:16:46] Power
[1:16:48] for thou has created all things for what
[1:16:51] for thy pleasure
[1:16:54] that is God himself loves pleasure
[1:16:59] amen so we see in that data that that
[1:17:03] that that that pleasure
[1:17:05] is not an evil thing all right
[1:17:07] even God loves pleasure
[1:17:10] amen all things was created for him
[1:17:14] before his pleasure
[1:17:16] amen but you see that old devil
[1:17:20] he comes and he gives you a false
[1:17:23] pleasure
[1:17:25] a perverted pleasure
[1:17:28] amen and the joy that is connected with
[1:17:32] it is sin
[1:17:37] mine
[1:17:39] sin is the main source of that pleasure
[1:17:44] amen pleasure that is connected to sin
[1:17:48] is a perverted pleasure
[1:17:52] it is perverted from the genuine
[1:17:55] pleasure that the Lord wanted us to have
[1:18:00] amen see he's nothing but a copycat
[1:18:04] he can't create nothing on his own but
[1:18:07] he stood back in the shadows and he
[1:18:10] watched everything that God did there
[1:18:12] had in the Garden of Eden and after God
[1:18:15] did everything he stepped back and said
[1:18:17] it's perfect
[1:18:18] so he said wow now what I can do is I
[1:18:21] can come and pervert what he's done
[1:18:25] that was pure love at that time
[1:18:29] so he come and he pervert love
[1:18:33] he he's a perverter of everything that
[1:18:37] God has done he's just a copycat right
[1:18:39] right
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:47] so God designed us for the right kind of
[1:18:50] pleasure amen
[1:18:52] amen amen
[1:18:52] of the deepest level of joy
[1:18:56] the long lasting pleasure
[1:18:59] lasting satisfaction
[1:19:02] that the world is unable to give
[1:19:05] This Joy I have right the world didn't
[1:19:09] give it to me
[1:19:11] and the world can't take it away
[1:19:14] You by all of your modern forms of
[1:19:16] entertainment and technology is a mere
[1:19:19] substitute
[1:19:22] of the pleasure that God has
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] in thy presence
[1:19:29] is the fullness of joy
[1:19:31] There's No Greater Joy No Greater
[1:19:34] pleasure amen than being in the presence
[1:19:37] of God
[1:19:39] it is the ultimate pleasure
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:48] pleasure that you feel amen if when you
[1:19:51] know the spirit of God is right there
[1:19:57] a few weeks back
[1:19:59] we were here in service
[1:20:02] and right back in that corner
[1:20:05] I can't recall what was going on I don't
[1:20:07] believe it was song service or whatever
[1:20:09] it's going forth but something happened
[1:20:13] I don't know about nobody else but I
[1:20:15] felt the feeling I felt the presence of
[1:20:18] the Lord I believe the sister Verner
[1:20:20] felt it sister Verner felt I said my God
[1:20:24] that he is here there was such a
[1:20:29] atmosphere that was such a move of God
[1:20:33] see you gotta stay sensitive
[1:20:36] I didn't know what to do I just started
[1:20:38] bending and praising God and oh Lord I
[1:20:42] had to fight back tongues
[1:20:45] and as I kind of caught myself I saw
[1:20:48] that whole code over there felt
[1:20:52] in that place
[1:20:57] that's the pleasure that I want to live
[1:21:00] in
[1:21:02] but we see
[1:21:05] Satan
[1:21:06] a lot of times people
[1:21:09] gave themselves in a little bit of
[1:21:10] trouble
[1:21:12] and
[1:21:14] during that time
[1:21:16] amen they go off the straight and narrow
[1:21:20] paths
[1:21:21] they begin Amen to start looking for
[1:21:25] pleasure elsewhere
[1:21:27] they start looking for pleasure amen
[1:21:30] some look for pleasure and drugs
[1:21:34] some searching for pleasure amen and uh
[1:21:37] cigarettes
[1:21:39] which is just a gateway to something
[1:21:41] else that's right right some start
[1:21:44] looking for pleasure in alcohol right
[1:21:48] some look for pleasure right in how they
[1:21:51] look oh my God right
[1:21:54] some look for pleasure in attention
[1:21:59] oh if I can just dress a certain way to
[1:22:02] get
[1:22:03] the boy's attention all right I feel
[1:22:07] good about myself I feel it's hurt oh I
[1:22:10] makes me feel so good
[1:22:13] careful you're slipping down a slippery
[1:22:16] slope now there's no doubt the prophet
[1:22:19] said it's natural for a woman to want to
[1:22:22] feel pretty
[1:22:24] but be careful because the devil can
[1:22:28] work in that
[1:22:29] amen that you can get a spirit on you
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:35] become a tool for the devil that's right
[1:22:38] now sometimes in in these things people
[1:22:42] your devil get you searching for this
[1:22:45] worldly pleasure and he'll set a trap
[1:22:49] for you right you found yourself out
[1:22:52] there and you're doing things and you
[1:22:53] get in trouble with the law
[1:22:56] because you're searching for pleasure
[1:22:59] wow and you get yourself bound up Amen
[1:23:04] in bondage right you get yourself
[1:23:07] Tangled all up right and you find
[1:23:10] yourself
[1:23:11] in the prison house
[1:23:20] even in the prison
[1:23:25] he's still giving you pleasure oh my
[1:23:28] there's a word here that's called uh uh
[1:23:32] what is it uh uh uh uh when you get into
[1:23:35] jail and you don't want to get out you
[1:23:36] become institutionalized
[1:23:39] wow wow you find yourself after you've
[1:23:43] been in prison for quite some time and
[1:23:47] you don't and you're feeling this
[1:23:49] worldly pleasure you don't even know
[1:23:51] what real pleasure is wow
[1:23:53] and you begin to get so dependent upon
[1:23:57] that pleasure you can no longer function
[1:23:59] in society
[1:24:01] wow
[1:24:03] you begin to find pleasure even in
[1:24:07] bondage
[1:24:08] and you begin to oh oh well this is
[1:24:11] that's not even fundamental God is
[1:24:13] trying to free you and want to free you
[1:24:16] from your sin and uh you don't even want
[1:24:19] to leave
[1:24:20] cause you got institutionalized
[1:24:24] now
[1:24:27] did a little research in that
[1:24:30] and it says here
[1:24:32] the social effects
[1:24:35] occur in two stages of the prison life
[1:24:39] a period of confinement
[1:24:42] and re-entry into society
[1:24:45] okay
[1:24:46] confinement and then re-entry into
[1:24:49] society
[1:24:50] all inmates experience prisonization
[1:24:55] this is what this is called it's called
[1:24:57] prisonization
[1:24:59] and they also experience a reduced
[1:25:04] social status
[1:25:05] upon their return to the community
[1:25:09] the result is often a lonely helpless
[1:25:14] life for the former in me
[1:25:17] the main psychological fact of
[1:25:20] imprisonment is self-condemnation
[1:25:24] guilt
[1:25:26] boredom
[1:25:28] result resulting in losses of
[1:25:31] perspective
[1:25:33] and of self-confidence
[1:25:36] after release the prisoners are often
[1:25:39] withdrawn from others they also feel
[1:25:43] hostile towards Society
[1:25:46] and the criminal and and the criminal
[1:25:48] justice system and constantly anxious
[1:25:53] now we know from the message that these
[1:25:55] are just Spirits all right amen that I
[1:25:58] dare to keep you in bondage
[1:26:00] these are spirits from the pits of hell
[1:26:04] amen now imprisonment also multiplies
[1:26:10] their pre-existing financial problems
[1:26:13] there neither the government nor the
[1:26:17] community helps ex-offenders deal with
[1:26:19] their problems inmates often receive
[1:26:22] vocational training in there during
[1:26:25] their confinement but seldom obtain
[1:26:27] employment in the job area following
[1:26:30] their release as a result former inmates
[1:26:34] are highly vulnerable to Future criminal
[1:26:37] involvement
[1:26:38] wow true
[1:26:43] amen amen
[1:26:49] so even one shot
[1:26:53] he still got his claws
[1:26:56] well Johnny your release
[1:27:01] ain't got no job

[1:31:38] Prophet says here not long ago an old
[1:31:41] farmer uh had a cornfield
[1:31:45] and the crow kept coming by and eating
[1:31:50] his corn
[1:31:52] so he set a trap and caught one
[1:31:57] he said I'll fix the rest of them
[1:32:00] he tied the one's foot and and to the
[1:32:05] fence and the poor old crow hobbled and
[1:32:08] jumped and hobbled and jumped and he
[1:32:11] couldn't get away all right
[1:32:13] amen and because he was tied up
[1:32:17] he was starving
[1:32:19] he could only eat an occasional kernel
[1:32:22] of corn that uh fell in his vicinity
[1:32:28] amen he began to starve to them
[1:32:32] he got just over he could hardly fly
[1:32:36] amen and he could hardly jump up and
[1:32:39] down anymore
[1:32:42] one of the ultimate freedoms amen is
[1:32:46] being able to fly
[1:32:47] we sing the song that some glad morning
[1:32:51] when this life is over I'll Fly Away
[1:32:56] the ultimate form of Freedom amen like
[1:32:59] that eagle is to be able to saw a man
[1:33:01] amongst the clouds amen so he wanted to
[1:33:05] be free amen but he had a teaser Amen on
[1:33:10] his foot and he was chained to a certain
[1:33:13] area right amen and all the other crows
[1:33:17] come by and holler Johnny Crow let's go
[1:33:19] amen let's go south it's turning winter
[1:33:23] uh you'll die sitting there right Amen
[1:33:27] in all other crows didn't understand
[1:33:29] what was wrong with old Johnny Crowe why
[1:33:33] don't he come why don't he listen and
[1:33:35] they begin to talk about it what's wrong
[1:33:37] with you why don't you listen but they
[1:33:39] didn't understand he had a talent on her
[1:33:42] that's right let's see what happened
[1:33:43] after a while that tether kept holding
[1:33:46] him down and he got so weak amen that
[1:33:48] one day the farmer came and took the
[1:33:51] tether off right
[1:33:54] I'm sorry let me finish reading my story
[1:33:56] y'all get me ahead of myself I go blame
[1:33:59] that on y'all

[1:34:08] said that poor old crow look at him
[1:34:10] hobbling around
[1:34:12] and he's getting weak so he caught the
[1:34:15] old fella petted him a little bit amen
[1:34:18] and took him off the latch off of his
[1:34:21] foot then turned him loose and said all
[1:34:25] right old boy you can go now
[1:34:28] and he walked away and the old crow just
[1:34:31] kept walking around in the same Circle
[1:34:35] he didn't have confidence on what the
[1:34:38] man said that you can go now amen
[1:34:41] because he had been tethered there for
[1:34:42] so long amen that now it was a mental
[1:34:46] thing amen he couldn't get over the fact
[1:34:49] amen that oh this felt pretty good oh
[1:34:52] I'm familiar with these here in this
[1:34:54] environment so I think I'll just stay

[1:35:09] and found pleasure
[1:35:12] in that little confined area

[1:36:34] so you see
[1:36:36] amen that we're battling
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:40] not just with a physical confinement
[1:36:43] amen but it's a spiritual confinement
[1:36:46] amen it's a spiritual bondage
[1:36:49] amen that we finds ourselves in
[1:36:51] sometimes
[1:36:52] amen and sometimes uh we're battling the
[1:36:55] thoughts of our own mind
[1:36:57] amen let's look here and judges
[1:37:00] and we see the many nights
[1:37:03] found themselves
[1:37:05] I'm sorry Israel found themselves in
[1:37:07] bondage
[1:37:08] amen and God had told Gideon to I want
[1:37:13] you to go have not I sent thee to set
[1:37:16] the people free amen
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:25] the challenge
[1:37:27] to get in
[1:37:28] and coming to the union
[1:37:31] Amen to bring his thoughts into the
[1:37:35] union of God's thoughts see this story
[1:37:37] of Gideon was written for us in this day
[1:37:40] in this end time that would also amen
[1:37:43] see there there there let's look at uh
[1:37:45] real quick here
[1:37:47] uh uh getting ahead of myself
[1:37:50] amen God bless you God bless you let's
[1:37:52] look at the fourth seal the fourth seal
[1:37:56] amen uh get that up and I wanna I wanna
[1:37:59] read something here uh
[1:38:07] amen amen
[1:38:11] we want you to I want to show you here
[1:38:13] where uh
[1:38:16] Gideon
[1:38:17] I'm sorry Israel they were hell bondage
[1:38:22] amen uh uh uh about a million nights and
[1:38:25] there were three powers
[1:38:27] amen there that that that held them
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:46] amen we will get to it at this goal
[1:38:49] and we see here that
[1:38:52] Gideon didn't have confidence
[1:38:55] that he was able to deliver because it
[1:38:58] was a a great Harmony
[1:39:00] amen and and and and and and and here we
[1:39:03] go praise the Lord
[1:39:05] the story of getting
[1:39:07] the end time
[1:39:09] when there were three powers that was
[1:39:12] gathered in against us in this day
[1:39:15] amen three power because see there were
[1:39:17] three uh uh there was the malachites
[1:39:20] there was the Canaanites
[1:39:22] and then they think it was the children
[1:39:24] of the North
[1:39:25] amen and these three powers had come
[1:39:28] together Amen to come against Israel
[1:39:32] amen and they had them in bondage
[1:39:36] they had them encamped
[1:39:39] let's just read it judges
[1:39:49] amen
[1:39:55] amen
[1:40:03] sixth chapter the third verse and so it
[1:40:06] was
[1:40:06] when Israel had sown
[1:40:10] that the midianites came up
[1:40:13] and the amalekites
[1:40:16] and the children of the East
[1:40:19] even came against them
[1:40:22] and they encamped against them and
[1:40:26] destroyed them and destroyed the
[1:40:29] increase of the Earth
[1:40:34] and destroyed the increase of the earth
[1:40:36] to Thou come and to Gaza and left no
[1:40:40] sustenance for Israel see took away
[1:40:44] their ability to nourish themselves amen
[1:40:48] neither sheep nor Ox nor as
[1:40:52] for they came up with their cattle and
[1:40:56] their tents they came up as grasshoppers
[1:41:00] for multitude
[1:41:03] for both they and their camels were
[1:41:06] without number and they entered into the
[1:41:09] land to destroy it
[1:41:11] and Israel was greatly impoverished
[1:41:14] because of the minionites and the
[1:41:17] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:41:19] and and it came to pass when the
[1:41:22] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:41:25] because of the manyanites the Lord set a
[1:41:28] prophet unto the children of Israel
[1:41:32] so we see
[1:41:33] here uh it's just like today
[1:41:37] amen the false fear but the Brand number
[1:41:39] told us that notice the Antichrist
[1:41:42] it is on a Pale Horse
[1:41:45] amen mixed colors a horse is a beast
[1:41:50] that represents a power
[1:41:52] his power is all mixed up why it's
[1:41:56] politics
[1:41:57] it's National powers and its religious
[1:42:02] powers
[1:42:03] it's demon powers it's all kind of
[1:42:07] powers mixed together
[1:42:10] The Pale Horse He was a he's got all
[1:42:14] kinds of powers amen but Jesus come it's
[1:42:18] on a solid horse amen the word amen but
[1:42:23] we see that Pale Horse amen is a mixture
[1:42:26] of the White Horse amen it's a mixture
[1:42:30] of the Black Horse and the red horse see
[1:42:34] we have those same Powers amen that's
[1:42:37] coming against us today amen some people
[1:42:40] uh get tied up and get in bondage Amen
[1:42:44] in the religious powers
[1:42:46] amen that has come to put us in bondage
[1:42:50] in this hour some people get tied up in
[1:42:53] politics amen and some people just
[1:42:55] getting themselves out on The Deep End
[1:42:57] Amen and find themselves in all kind of
[1:43:00] trouble where they got all kind of
[1:43:02] demons oppressions and suppressions and
[1:43:04] all kind of things hanging on them and
[1:43:06] they want to be free amen but they need
[1:43:08] somebody to lead them to Freedom amen
[1:43:12] but even when the person is leading them
[1:43:14] to Freedom amen they they find
[1:43:17] themselves not having confidence that
[1:43:20] they're actually free in their own mind
[1:43:22] amen but the battle is in their own mind
[1:43:26] amen they have to be able to come
[1:43:28] overcome the bondage of their own
[1:43:31] thoughts if they can ever get their
[1:43:33] thoughts Amen in line with God's
[1:43:36] thoughts amen they'll go free amen and
[1:43:39] they'll never look back amen but the
[1:43:42] battle amen is to get their thoughts in
[1:43:44] line with God's thoughts right
[1:43:46] amen but you got these three great
[1:43:48] Powers amen that are constantly making a
[1:43:51] noise amen see the Israel amen was there
[1:43:55] and they heard the noise and then what
[1:43:58] happens is fear set in I mean we have a
[1:44:01] great Army to this side and the great
[1:44:03] Army to that side and a great armor to
[1:44:05] that side but Gideon he told the Lord
[1:44:08] told uh Gideon that I have to you have
[1:44:11] given you to deliver them right right
[1:44:15] amen and we had a prophet in this hour
[1:44:18] amen sent to deliver us amen out of our
[1:44:22] bondage amen are you glad about it
[1:44:25] so we look on here
[1:44:28] amen the story of Gideon
[1:44:30] and Gideon said
[1:44:32] unto if I will save Israel by my own
[1:44:37] hands thou Hast said now look
[1:44:40] look at the doubt amen that that Gideon
[1:44:43] had even though God had told him that
[1:44:46] Gideon's still he still wasn't convinced
[1:44:50] that he would be able to defeat this
[1:44:53] innumerable Army
[1:44:56] as it were only one man as only one man
[1:44:59] because
[1:45:00] he had began amen he had been to the
[1:45:05] school
[1:45:06] now I put this in there he had been to
[1:45:08] school and he knew how to add
[1:45:12] so when he had
[1:45:18] no we can't do this
[1:45:22] see what was it he was looking into
[1:45:25] himself
[1:45:27] he was looking into his own human
[1:45:29] ability amen if saying that or how can I
[1:45:33] do it such a great Army but he really
[1:45:35] got to realize that he had more with him
[1:45:39] amen because God had already told him to
[1:45:42] do
[1:45:45] amen
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:47] so in verse 37 he says here behold I
[1:45:50] will put a fleece
[1:45:51] of wool
[1:45:53] in the floor
[1:45:54] and if to do be on the fleece only
[1:45:58] and it be dry upon the Earth
[1:46:00] besides then shall I know
[1:46:03] that that would save Israel by my hand
[1:46:07] and thou has said
[1:46:09] verse 38 and it was so he rose up early
[1:46:13] in the morning and on to on tomorrow and
[1:46:18] thrust the fleece together and ringed
[1:46:20] out the Dew out of the fleece and uh a
[1:46:24] bowl full of water
[1:46:26] see
[1:46:27] so God had begun he had to build up the
[1:46:30] confidence
[1:46:31] amen of of of of of uh Gideon
[1:46:36] Gideon was in his own self-doubt amen
[1:46:40] before he could go how can I go how can
[1:46:43] I lead this this Army amongst he had to
[1:46:47] build up his own uh uh confidence
[1:46:51] you see so we see that the same
[1:46:54] parallels amen was with our own prophet
[1:46:58] amen he gave Gideon three poles first he
[1:47:02] gave them the angel the the staff of the
[1:47:06] Angel into the bowl
[1:47:08] right and the next he told him he said
[1:47:10] if the fleece amen uh uh uh filled with
[1:47:14] water in the ground around the fleece
[1:47:16] was dry
[1:47:17] amen then after that he came back to him
[1:47:21] again and he said if you uh uh this time
[1:47:24] if the fleece was dry and the ground was
[1:47:27] wet around it see he gave him three
[1:47:30] pools
[1:47:31] Amen to get his confidence up that I am
[1:47:35] with you go and deliver the people
[1:47:38] amen we gotta understand my brothers and
[1:47:40] sisters that is a supernatural Amen to
[1:47:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ is no longer a
[1:47:47] supernatural it's becoming a natural
[1:47:49] [Applause]
[1:47:51] the Supernatural is more natural than
[1:47:54] the supernatural if that makes sense
[1:47:56] and see that's what we're getting to
[1:47:58] we're coming to a place amen where we
[1:48:00] expect the supernatural
[1:48:03] we have to bring our mind thoughts Amen
[1:48:06] in in line with his thoughts amen
[1:48:10] so many times people we write the
[1:48:13] supernatural love to see things but this
[1:48:15] we this is a common occurrence
[1:48:18] this is natural for us this is not
[1:48:21] everyone's jumping and tripping over
[1:48:22] themselves well we praise the Lord
[1:48:24] because this is what he do every day
[1:48:27] that's what they do every day exactly
[1:48:30] so we go on here and we see amen that uh
[1:48:34] get in uh was had to go through these uh
[1:48:38] things to bring his confidence in line
[1:48:40] with God's confidence amen and see these
[1:48:44] the same things that you have to go
[1:48:46] through amen there's things and uh uh
[1:48:49] torments and things in your life amen
[1:48:51] and ask God deliver you from this amen
[1:48:54] and he deliver you from that and he
[1:48:57] answered that prayer and he answers this
[1:48:59] prayer to bring your confidence up amen
[1:49:02] so that you can realize amen that you
[1:49:04] can go free
[1:49:05] amen though what happened sometime amen
[1:49:08] let's get back to the story here you can
[1:49:10] get out of prison and like I said
[1:49:12] there's a rope amen that's connected to
[1:49:14] you
[1:49:17] you want to go free but the the things
[1:49:19] that you've done in your past are always
[1:49:21] hunting all right and you feel like I
[1:49:25] can't go free

[2:03:58] once Gideon amen had a revelation okay
[2:04:02] Lord I can do this amen so he moved out
[2:04:07] amen judges the seventh chapter says he
[2:04:10] moved out then uh zaruba Bell who was
[2:04:13] getting in and all the people were with
[2:04:16] him rose up early in the morning and
[2:04:18] pinched their tents beside and The Well
[2:04:20] of Herod and the host of Minion there on
[2:04:23] the North side by the hill of Mori in
[2:04:26] the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon

[2:04:32] megive uh with me to and me to give the
[2:04:36] million nights into their hands let's
[2:04:38] Israel Vault themselves against me
[2:04:41] saying my own hand has saved thee in
[2:04:44] order for the word amen you have to
[2:04:47] become weak enough amen see that's just
[2:04:51] stick you see it Gideon was looking
[2:04:53] within his own human ability and like I
[2:04:56] said before he could do the math amen
[2:04:58] see he was looking within his own
[2:05:00] ability amen what we have to not look
[2:05:03] within our own ability amen but look at
[2:05:05] the word of God not my own ability but
[2:05:09] what you say Lord
[2:05:10] amen see you're not weak enough yet amen
[2:05:14] you're still looking within yourself you
[2:05:17] still got a little too much strength

[2:05:21] you're still a little a little too
[2:05:23] strong amen I got to get you weak amen
[2:05:27] so you say God delivered me amen we see
[2:05:30] the same thing here we get in the
[2:05:32] beginning and you're too strong you got
[2:05:34] too many people now beginning at the
[2:05:36] beginning of the conflict amen he was
[2:05:39] doubtful because it was so many people
[2:05:41] and you're not adding to my Harmony but
[2:05:43] you're demand finishing it
[2:05:47] amen right you're not weak enough
[2:05:51] so see a lot of time
[2:05:53] amen we have things going through in our
[2:05:55] lives see a lot of times people think
[2:05:57] that uh because you get saved amen all
[2:06:00] of a sudden all of the problems are
[2:06:02] going away no but now we got the weaken
[2:06:05] you we got to start picking things off
[2:06:07] of you amen we got to take the you out
[2:06:10] of you
[2:06:11] and place God in there amen you're not
[2:06:15] weak enough yet
[2:06:16] amen you're still relying on your own
[2:06:18] abilities amen we can't rely on our own
[2:06:21] abilities
[2:06:22] amen so we go on here
[2:06:26] now therefore go and Proclaim in the
[2:06:30] years of the people saying whosoever is
[2:06:33] fearful and Afraid let him turn and
[2:06:35] depart early
[2:06:37] Amen to Mount Gilead and their return of
[2:06:41] people twenty and two thousand remained
[2:06:45] ten thousand people twenty and two
[2:06:48] thousand and there remain ten thousand
[2:06:51] the message uh uh uh uh the gone forth
[2:06:55] amen
[2:06:57] so
[2:06:59] we see that Gideon's Army had become
[2:07:03] smaller uh and smaller amen and the Lord
[2:07:06] said to get in the people are yet too
[2:07:08] many
[2:07:10] again
[2:07:12] the people are yet too many
[2:07:14] in other words you need to be even
[2:07:17] weaker all right
[2:07:19] are you you are still too strong of
[2:07:22] yourself
[2:07:23] you got to die some more right amen is
[2:07:28] still too much you involved right amen
[2:07:31] bring them down into the water and I
[2:07:33] will try them for thee there and it
[2:07:37] shall be that of whom I say unto thee
[2:07:41] this shall go down go with thee and the
[2:07:44] same shall go with thee and of
[2:07:47] whomsoever I say unto thee this shall
[2:07:53] not go with thee the same shall not go
[2:07:57] so he brought down the people unto the
[2:08:00] water
[2:08:01] and the Lord said unto Gideon everyone
[2:08:03] that lapeth up the water with his tongue
[2:08:08] as a dog lapis him shout thou set by
[2:08:13] himself likewise everyone that bows down
[2:08:16] upon his knee to drink
[2:08:19] and the number of them that lap putting
[2:08:22] their uh hand to their mouth there were
[2:08:26] 300 men but all the rest of the people
[2:08:28] bowed down upon their knees to drink the
[2:08:32] water and the Lord said unto Gideon by
[2:08:35] three but the Lord said unto Gideon by
[2:08:38] the 300 men that lapped will I save you
[2:08:42] to deliver the midianites unto thine
[2:08:45] hand and let all the other people go
[2:08:49] every man unto his place so the peoples
[2:08:52] took uh Victors and their hands in their
[2:08:57] hands and their trumpets and set at the
[2:09:01] rest of Israel every man unto his tent
[2:09:04] took and retained those 300 amen and the
[2:09:09] hosts of Midian was beneath him in the
[2:09:12] valley so those 300 men's armed with no
[2:09:16] weapons but only trumpets and vessels
[2:09:18] amen weak weaker they could only they
[2:09:22] they they they they didn't have such
[2:09:25] great weapons and and things of that
[2:09:27] nature I'll see the math just didn't add
[2:09:29] up anymore all right hey man the mouth
[2:09:32] just didn't add up hey man it was much
[2:09:35] like Joseph amen he would weakest Point
[2:09:38] Amen in prison amen didn't know how he
[2:09:41] was going to be lit but he found himself
[2:09:43] Amen in the palace we look at amen uh uh
[2:09:47] uh uh uh Abraham amen the Melchizedek
[2:09:52] came to Abraham and the two angels went
[2:09:55] down to Sodom Amen to deliver a a lot
[2:09:58] Amen in his family amen out of Sodom

[2:10:15] Lot's wife turned in a heart amen she
[2:10:19] didn't actually turn to go back but her
[2:10:21] heart was still back in the what had
[2:10:24] happened she had become
[2:10:25] institutionalized amen and the devil had
[2:10:28] a rope on her so her heart was still
[2:10:31] there amen see you got to turn your back
[2:10:33] on the devil amen you got to create in
[2:10:36] me Lord a clean heart amen and renewal
[2:10:40] rights Spirit wishing me amen amen all
[2:10:44] right
[2:10:45] that's right so we see amen that he uh
[2:10:49] Gideon had to get weaker within himself
[2:10:52] amen he had to uh uh stop relying Amen
[2:10:56] on his own ability Amen to to deliver
[2:10:59] himself out of the bondage that he was
[2:11:02] in amen he had to in order to deliver

[2:11:20] pest house amen into a prison Amen in
[2:11:24] order to deliver us out of our prison
[2:11:27] see we were born in sin shaped in
[2:11:29] iniquity amen we were born into
[2:11:31] prison-like conditions amen but God had
[2:11:35] to come and Deliver us but when he went
[2:11:38] down into prison amen and took the keys
[2:11:41] from Satan Amen on the third day he came
[2:11:44] back amen man he rose with death and
[2:11:48] Hell conquered amen with the keys to
[2:11:50] death hell and the grave Amen to Deliver
[2:11:53] Us from prison amen and told us that we
[2:11:57] didn't have to be prison anymore he said
[2:11:59] I go Amen to prepare a place for you
[2:12:02] that where I am amen you may be also and
[2:12:07] we had a prophet in this hour that came
[2:12:09] and told us that he says In My Father's
[2:12:11] House the word said in my father's house
[2:12:14] there's many mansions if it was not so I

[2:24:05] softly sis
[2:24:07] we thoroughly appreciated the word of
[2:24:10] the Lord on today for my brother Troy
[2:24:13] from prison to the palace and sermons
[2:24:16] just loaded with nutrients
[2:24:20] um and just a wonderful example of when
[2:24:23] a person is leaving prison and how often
[2:24:27] times they are so affected by what
[2:24:30] happened to them and even though they've
[2:24:32] gone through and they've been given
[2:24:35] tools to try to be successful yet there
[2:24:38] are things in society that still stands
[2:24:40] against him and uh you know and when you
[2:24:43] see somebody I recently have watched
[2:24:45] that in a couple gentlemen's life they
[2:24:47] were released in prison and and uh one
[2:24:49] of the things that I saw them do the
[2:24:51] brother troll was talking about you know
[2:24:53] going to halfway house and and when you
[2:24:55] you know just doing everything you can
[2:24:57] getting the counselor that you need and
[2:24:59] one of the things I saw these gentlemen
[2:25:01] do we were we would get together on a
[2:25:03] call every morning at uh about it would
[2:25:06] be eight o'clock hour time but where
[2:25:08] they lived it would be about 6 30 in the
[2:25:10] morning six o'clock their time and they
[2:25:12] would get on that call and just listen
[2:25:13] to the word just listen to the word just
[2:25:15] listen to the word and uh and as they
[2:25:17] did that eventually God began to open up
[2:25:19] doors they got jobs and they got
[2:25:22] Vehicles they got all kind of things in
[2:25:24] order to kind of bring themselves back
[2:25:25] in society but what what started it is
[2:25:28] just staying connected with the word of
[2:25:30] God Amen stand connected to the word of
[2:25:33] God so I I just appreciated that this
[2:25:35] wonderful thought amen this morning from
[2:25:37] prison to the Palace God bless you
[2:25:40] brother Troy amen
[2:25:42] God bless you praise God and and that
[2:25:47] one quote that anytime I hear anybody
[2:25:49] read it uh you know House of Hell give
[2:25:52] way
[2:25:53] to the press to the name uh to the the
[2:25:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I had
[2:25:57] never heard that quote before and I've
[2:25:59] been in this message for years and the
[2:26:01] very first person that preached that
[2:26:03] that uh with that quote where I heard it
[2:26:06] for the first time was Caleb Wesco amen
[2:26:10] and I say House of Hell give way
[2:26:12] to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:26:18] bye I remember he he preached that uh I
[2:26:21] think it was a Friday night or some
[2:26:23] service we had and he brought that quote
[2:26:25] out and that thing it just stuck with me
[2:26:27] and and it's going with me many places
[2:26:29] all over the world that same quote but
[2:26:31] it's just so good to see amen how God
[2:26:34] used that extent that that that example
[2:26:36] in brother Brandon's life to show us
[2:26:37] that we were all in bondage but we
[2:26:39] needed Freedom we needed Freedom thank
[2:26:42] God that he sent us freedom amen praise

[2:27:42] kind of reflecting in this thing and
[2:27:43] saying when we recording we didn't talk

[2:27:51] conversation and um you know we um uh we
[2:27:56] two young people that fell in love and
[2:27:59] got married and raised a family and and
[2:28:01] somewhere along the way God called us to
[2:28:03] all of what we're doing right now and um
[2:28:06] and and and and when God called uh us I
[2:28:09] mean I I just remember the whole process
[2:28:11] and and I was just praying that the Lord
[2:28:13] would just also speak to my wife I knew
[2:28:15] what he was telling me but I had to wait
[2:28:17] on the Lord wait on the Lord for him to
[2:28:19] speak to her and it began to deal with
[2:28:20] her and dreams and and as we begin to
[2:28:23] find out what the meaning of the dreams
[2:28:24] were we realized that this is nothing
[2:28:26] but the hand of Lord and and I and I
[2:28:28] appreciate her because she had to
[2:28:29] surrender as well uh to the perfect will
[2:28:32] of God Amen and then surrendering uh we

[2:32:43] respond to this I need help I need help
[2:32:46] I mean a wife is there to help she's a
[2:32:49] help mate you know to me and and I
[2:32:51] realize uh just you know again over the
[2:32:54] years we wouldn't have been as
[2:32:55] successful if I didn't have her if I
[2:32:57] didn't have it yet most of y'all know me
[2:32:59] and I'm and I'm still this I got this um
[2:33:01] reputation of being tough Duff and y'all
[2:33:04] know I'm a rough guy y'all know I am and
[2:33:07] and with a wife it's kind of helped
[2:33:08] temper some of them things down but if I
[2:33:10] didn't have a wife y'all probably
[2:33:12] wouldn't like me too much amen but I

[2:38:52] blessed us with
[2:38:54] um
[2:38:56] we get calls from everywhere not looking
[2:38:59] for it not praying for it not asking for
[2:39:02] it but uh just different ones that want
[2:39:04] us to come and try to be a blessing you
[2:39:06] know to their their church last week
[2:39:09] when we went to the the um the uh the
[2:39:12] wedding and we stayed over to go to
[2:39:15] church there's
[2:39:17] there's some things that happen that I I
[2:39:21] I have to just wait to share but I know
[2:39:24] that God sends us places for a reason
[2:39:27] and um I mean just my mom was I was
[2:39:29] talking to her yesterday and you know
[2:39:31] one of I tell you the struggles that
[2:39:33] Lord what what what do I take what don't
[2:39:35] I take and you know what what what do I
[2:39:37] do with all of this when I worked I
[2:39:39] could say no to everybody
[2:39:41] I gotta work I can't do that uh but now
[2:39:45] that I work for the Lord my uncle or
[2:39:47] cousin told me he says well yeah yeah
[2:39:49] when God wants you to do something you
[2:39:50] just put it on your schedule I see
[2:39:52] that's it's hard thing for me to
[2:39:54] understand and comprehend but I am
[2:39:56] trying to yield to the perfect will of
[2:39:57] God and I I solicit your prayer church
[2:40:00] that that you would just pray pray for a
[2:40:02] minute uh that God would just help me
[2:40:04] through this but they're they're just I
[2:40:06] just I'm just
[2:40:08] just a guy from Pleasant City and uh
[2:40:12] and I I just I I thank God for all the
[2:40:15] open doors that he's given me while we
[2:40:17] were in um
[2:40:19] um Virginia a few weeks ago for my
[2:40:22] uncles
[2:40:24] um
[2:40:25] inauguration
[2:40:27] they had some food that they were
[2:40:29] serving
[2:40:30] and um and they had people there serving
[2:40:33] food and I was coming through the line
[2:40:35] to get my food
[2:40:37] and uh and I I just uh eggs and sausage
[2:40:42] and bacon or whatever it was and I'm
[2:40:44] just getting my food and I'm gonna go on
[2:40:46] and eat and as I'm coming through the
[2:40:48] line this lady of servant should say
[2:40:50] well um you know
[2:40:51] to start telling me all her life story
[2:40:53] and you know her son served in the
[2:40:56] military and all these things she just
[2:40:58] going on and on and on and then I'm like
[2:41:01] okay well praise the Lord that's good
[2:41:02] and and uh and I guess when I said
[2:41:04] praise Lord she knew I was a Christian
[2:41:05] and she just right there stopped She
[2:41:08] said you know what
[2:41:09] uh I'm touching and agreeing with you
[2:41:12] right now in the name of Jesus that God
[2:41:14] gonna give you everything you desire in
[2:41:16] your art right now in the name of Jesus
[2:41:18] I say okay I agree I touch and agree she
[2:41:21] said she took her hand off them eggs and
[2:41:23] put it in my hand and and said and she
[2:41:26] starts speaking in tongues and I like I
[2:41:28] just came to get breakfast
[2:41:31] but I got a blessing at breakfast
[2:41:34] and she did that to me and all the other
[2:41:37] people come through and I'm like well
[2:41:38] why does she pick me out in the crowd to
[2:41:40] do that God just do things
[2:41:42] we don't understand why he do things but
[2:41:45] I'll tell you one thing I'm not gonna do
[2:41:46] I'm not gonna fight with God I'm gonna
[2:41:49] just yield to the Lord and I'm just let
[2:41:51] him be gone and and one thing that I'm
[2:41:54] that I'm I'm very very uh happy about is
[2:41:57] that God has sent this church hell that
[2:42:00] if uh if if I get a call I know that I
[2:42:03] got Brothers I can I can I can lean on I

[2:42:29] of the Lord

[2:44:53] discussion we didn't know that but we
[2:44:54] yielded Lord and now you've taken the
