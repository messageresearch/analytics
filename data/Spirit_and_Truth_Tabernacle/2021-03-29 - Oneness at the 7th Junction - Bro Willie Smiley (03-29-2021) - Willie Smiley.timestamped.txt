[8:44] let me just give the announcements and
[8:47] i did want to as i'm preparing for that
[8:49] one to say it's good to be back home
[8:52] i've been away for two seconds
[8:55] when he was the lord and uh there used
[8:58] to be a time in
[8:59] ministry where uh i i just i couldn't go
[9:02] away for two sundays i just couldn't do
[9:03] it i
[9:04] had to get back and a lot of modifying
[9:08] plans but
[9:09] this time when things just kind of
[9:11] worked out um
[9:12] the minister's meeting that i went to a
[9:14] couple weeks ago we had a really
[9:15] wonderful time there
[9:17] in uh in south carolina brother uh
[9:19] charles anderson's
[9:21] and um you know we have service day
[9:23] after the minister's meeting then
[9:24] last week it's been a year pretty much
[9:26] in the making
[9:28] that we were trying to get with um
[9:30] literal life
[9:31] church there brother paul lafontaine had
[9:34] invited us
[9:35] and during the covet we just couldn't go
[9:37] so we finally
[9:38] you know rearranged the time that we
[9:41] could go and
[9:42] went last week and they had a wonderful
[9:45] worship
[9:45] they call it a night of worship it was
[9:47] their third um third night of worship
[9:50] and they
[9:51] just invited you know different guests
[9:52] to come and uh myself
[9:54] and sister rebecca were asked to sing
[9:58] and
[9:58] amen and brother michael belch and i
[10:00] believe and
[10:02] not sure who else uh but but we had a
[10:05] wonderful time and just just
[10:06] just worship and i got some ideas
[10:08] floating through my head
[10:10] uh after experiencing something like
[10:12] that and you know i i
[10:14] i'm i'm just thinking about some things
[10:17] so
[10:18] i can't wait for our new church and uh
[10:20] new school and
[10:21] amen and you know just praise god
[10:24] [Applause]
[10:26] i'm i'm looking forward to to
[10:29] doing some things you know you know when
[10:30] we get to the other side there will be
[10:32] no more sermons preached
[10:34] you're going to hear all your sermons on
[10:35] this side and when we get there we're
[10:37] just going to join the worship
[10:40] success song that they're playing right

[10:43] words or song back in my thing we used
[10:45] to listen to it oh man

[13:02] we have two services one is a sunrise
[13:04] service at 7 00 a.m
[13:06] and then sunday at 10 30. and um you'll
[13:09] notice that
[13:09] i don't i don't really announce who's
[13:11] speaking when just come on the
[13:13] expectation
[13:14] that's that's the way i like to do
[13:15] things right just come on expectation
[13:18] you just never know what might happen
[13:20] uh so uh but we're gonna use the gifts
[13:22] that god has given us here in this
[13:24] church as i was saying earlier this
[13:25] time i couldn't take two weeks off but
[13:27] now god is blessed
[13:29] and uh you know and and as i get a
[13:31] little old i ain't gotta put that much
[13:33] wear and tear on my body
[13:35] because we got help we got help amen
[13:38] [Applause]
[13:41] and uh we certainly appreciate brother
[13:43] clicking on last sunday
[13:46] amen appreciate the word of the lord
[13:50] and there was a word of wisdom that he
[13:52] given in his sermon there just you know
[13:54] for parenting and and just just sowing
[13:57] into the children's lives and
[13:58] you know there's a uh um it's talking
[14:01] about how just get with the
[14:03] children individually right you know
[14:05] don't don't bring them together because
[14:06] they're gonna assume that you're talking
[14:08] to the other no
[14:09] you got my undivided attention and i'm
[14:12] giving you this and i tell you
[14:13] uh that was a real good word of wisdom i
[14:15] think if parents would just kind of take
[14:17] that and apply it we'll see a difference
[14:19] uh i was told that you know in the um uh
[14:22] the
[14:23] israeli culture they speak into their
[14:25] kids lives at very young ages
[14:27] you're gonna be a doctor you're gonna be
[14:29] a doctor before they even understand
[14:31] what the word doctor means you're gonna
[14:32] be an engineer you're gonna be
[14:34] you're gonna be a scientist you're gonna
[14:36] they just speak these things over their
[14:37] children
[14:38] and when they come to adulthood they
[14:40] manifest what was spoken over there
[14:43] right so so sometimes give them to the
[14:45] side of the speak positive in their life
[14:47] and just watch what god does with the
[14:49] seeds that you plant
[14:50] because your words are seeds your words
[14:53] are seeds right
[14:54] so i was appreciative of the word of god
[14:56] amen as it came from
[14:58] our brother and amen this i just just
[15:01] thank god for the help that we have
[15:02] around here
[15:03] amen so we're going to be using all
[15:04] these gifts next week and just looking
[15:06] for god just to bless us
[15:07] uh before we get started with those
[15:09] services we're doing something that
[15:11] we've uh never done before this is our
[15:13] first time ever doing it
[15:14] but we are we have invited those that
[15:17] and believe that god has given them a
[15:18] gift in the life
[15:19] amen uh we invite you to come to the
[15:22] service on
[15:23] tuesday night and on tuesday night it
[15:25] would be a service where we terry
[15:26] it just means we wait on the lord uh see
[15:29] brother branham taught us that
[15:31] uh we don't necessarily have to tarry
[15:32] for the holy ghost anymore we don't have
[15:34] to wait for the holy ghost anymore he's
[15:36] here to be given to us anytime we enter
[15:38] in
[15:38] we can get the holy ghost right well he
[15:41] says but uh but but
[15:42] but sometimes when it comes to the gifts
[15:45] just tarry wait on the lord wait for the
[15:47] lord to speak to you
[15:48] he said there's a certain way he would
[15:50] he just kind of laid out things in
[15:52] church order so that's the way we want
[15:53] to do it just the way the prophet said
[15:55] we're not going to try to make nothing
[15:56] happen but just less come and let's wait
[15:58] on the lord and
[15:59] i tell you this uh your gift has to be
[16:03] surrendered to order it has to be
[16:06] surrendered to order
[16:08] right there's a certain way things got
[16:09] to be done the prophet gave us that so
[16:11] now we're surrendering all that gifts to
[16:13] order
[16:13] uh and and and it's all gifts i got some
[16:16] gifts of discernment
[16:17] right i got some gifts of people that
[16:19] speak in tongues i got gifts of
[16:21] interpretation in the church
[16:22] amen i got gifts where people see
[16:25] visions
[16:26] right all these gifts are in the church
[16:27] but what happens it has to kind of pass
[16:29] through a
[16:30] the discernment filter to be proven
[16:32] hallelujah
[16:34] right that's why we surrender that's why
[16:35] we come together we submit ourselves one
[16:37] another
[16:38] and just let the lord speak amen that
[16:40] would keep the church so
[16:42] you know on this on on the right in the
[16:44] right balance
[16:46] because what happens sometimes people
[16:47] get a dream they just take off with a
[16:48] dream no interpretation
[16:50] of the dream at all just go god show me
[16:52] this how you know that was god
[16:54] right exactly how you know that was god
[16:58] right it could have been the devil right
[17:00] amen that's why you got somebody with
[17:01] discernment said no
[17:02] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[17:04] minute hallelujah so it just got to be
[17:06] submitted and we're going to do this
[17:08] amen for the first time
[17:10] on uh on tuesday night so we're looking
[17:12] forward to that and i just trust that
[17:14] as we're entering into this easter
[17:16] season uh that god will just
[17:18] meet us in a very special way amen we're
[17:20] at a junction and we're looking for the
[17:22] supernatural degree
[17:23] to be made manifest in our midst at the
[17:26] junction

[20:28] god bless you amen your precious wife
[20:31] amen good to have you all
[20:33] in service hope today amen so
[20:36] uh we're going to be dedicating a man
[20:40] um
[20:43] brother simba and sister ruth has been
[20:46] blessed
[20:46] with a little one and we're going to
[20:48] dedicate this little one to the lord
[20:51] this morning so i want to read a
[20:53] scripture then i also want to read
[20:55] a quote amen uh on this
[20:58] here in luke chapter 18 verse 15 and
[21:02] they brought unto him
[21:03] also infants that he would touch them
[21:07] but when his disciples saw it they
[21:10] rebuked them amen
[21:14] but jesus called them unto him and said
[21:17] suffer
[21:18] little children to come unto me
[21:22] and forbid them not so don't stop the
[21:24] kids from being dedicated
[21:27] uh for such is the kingdom of god
[21:30] uh verily i say unto you whosoever shall
[21:33] not receive
[21:34] the kingdom of god as a little child
[21:36] shall in no wise
[21:37] enter therein in this quote out of the
[21:41] message
[21:42] paradox uh brother branham just
[21:45] makes a statement here about dedication
[21:47] that i just wanted to
[21:49] read to you all amen this morning
[21:52] and we thank god
[21:55] [Music]
[21:57] that we have the opportunity to dedicate
[21:59] the little ones to jesus
[22:01] uh there's a uh here
[22:04] he says
[22:08] we don't believe in uh
[22:12] baptizing and then inform those little
[22:14] babies
[22:15] because they have no sin so we don't
[22:17] baptize children
[22:19] that's a kind of catholic thing i
[22:20] remember a friend of mine telling me
[22:22] uh you know i don't think that fellow
[22:24] went to church no time but when he had a
[22:26] child he took it to the church to get
[22:27] baptized and
[22:28] according to the catholic tradition once
[22:30] the child's been baptized they could
[22:31] they automatically go into heaven
[22:33] uh that's not according to scripture
[22:36] that's just according to the catholic
[22:37] church teaching but
[22:39] uh in order to go to heaven you got to
[22:41] be born again
[22:42] that's what jesus said you must be born
[22:45] again so
[22:46] uh but uh but we so we don't that we
[22:48] don't baptize little children we only
[22:50] baptize them when they come to the age
[22:51] of accountability they understand
[22:53] uh what sin is all about when they
[22:55] haven't understand that then we'll take
[22:57] them in the water we'll baptize them
[22:59] uh so here he says we don't believe in
[23:01] baptizing any form those little babies
[23:03] because they have no sin they
[23:04] are born in sin shaped and iniquity
[23:07] comes to the world speaking lives but
[23:08] they have nothing
[23:09] to repentance of it says in baptism is
[23:12] unto repentance and remission of sin
[23:14] so the baby has nothing to repent for
[23:16] when jesus died on the cross
[23:18] he cleansed all sin and now when we get
[23:22] old enough to know that we got to repent
[23:25] for what we did
[23:27] then we are and recognize that christ
[23:29] would die for us
[23:30] that little baby can't recognize that
[23:33] that christ died for him but

[35:51] spirit of revelation upon your people
[35:54] father help us the lord move the human
[35:57] part
[35:58] to one side that the gift of god could
[36:01] operate lord
[36:03] be freely uh yielded to you this morning
[36:07] lord we have a few things on our heart
[36:09] lord but
[36:10] it takes you to help us to uh express it
[36:14] i learned it
[36:15] man i don't have much uh in a way of
[36:18] education
[36:20] but i've seen you over the last few
[36:22] years just use the gift lord jesus and
[36:25] uh so we're just trusting in you and
[36:27] when it's all said and done
[36:29] lord god we could leave knowing that
[36:31] lord god you've been in control
[36:33] you said what you desired to be said and
[36:36] we give you praise glory
[36:37] for jesus name
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:46] we're in the service of the living god
[36:48] this morning and y'all y'all pray for me
[36:50] i feel nervous this morning
[36:52] amen i tell you it's a little it's a
[36:55] little bit different for me y'all know
[36:58] uh we've we've had some change we're
[36:59] gonna look at a couple of pages of
[37:00] scriptures genesis chapter one
[37:03] amen uh so y'all just kind of
[37:06] i feel like a guest minister this boy
[37:12] you know you go places sometimes and you
[37:14] preach and you get up and you just kind
[37:16] of feel
[37:17] a little nervous well i feel kind of
[37:19] like a gas i'm not a guest
[37:21] i've preached here many many times
[37:26] over the years and uh i'm a part of
[37:29] the group now but i just i just kind of
[37:32] got a nervous feeling this which is a
[37:34] good thing
[37:35] it's always a good thing to feel nervous
[37:39] amen but uh we just trust that the lord
[37:41] will settle us in the holy spirit
[37:44] uh genesis chapter one uh we want to
[37:47] read um
[37:49] uh from the 26th verse
[37:52] it says and god said let us make man in
[37:55] our image after our
[37:56] likeness and let them have dominion over
[37:59] the fish
[38:00] of the sea and over the fowls of the air
[38:02] and over the cattle and over
[38:05] all the earth and over every creeping
[38:07] thing that creepeth
[38:08] upon the earth so god created man in his
[38:12] own image
[38:13] in the image of god creating him man and
[38:16] female
[38:16] created heat them now let us look in the
[38:20] book of uh
[38:21] saint john chapter 17.
[38:25] what should be seated
[38:33] maybe we'll start at the fourth verse it
[38:36] says uh
[38:38] i have glorified thee on the earth i
[38:40] have finished the work which thou
[38:42] gave it for me to do and now oh father
[38:45] glorify
[38:46] me with with thine own self with the
[38:49] glory which i had with thee before
[38:52] the world was i have manifested thy name
[38:56] unto the men which thou giveth me out of
[38:59] the world
[39:00] thine they were and thou gaveth them me
[39:04] and they have kept thy word now they
[39:07] have known that all things whatsoever
[39:09] thou
[39:09] has given me of thee for i have given
[39:14] unto them the words which thou giveth me
[39:17] and they have received them
[39:21] and have known surely that i came out
[39:24] from thee
[39:25] and they have believed that thou didn't
[39:28] send me
[39:29] i pray for them i pray not for the world
[39:33] but for them which now has given me
[39:36] for they are thine and all mine are
[39:39] thine
[39:40] and thine are mine and i have glorified
[39:44] and i am glorified in them
[39:47] and now i am no more in the world but
[39:50] these are in the world
[39:52] i come to the holy father keep through
[39:55] thy
[39:56] own name uh those
[39:59] whom thou has given me that they may be
[40:02] one as we are one
[40:06] amen may the lord have a blessing to his
[40:08] words you may be seated
[40:11] uh we we like to use as a topic
[40:15] one is at the seventh junction
[40:19] and we know
[40:22] brother jack has been preaching on uh
[40:25] those junctions and i was telling him
[40:28] this morning in the office and i'm not
[40:30] i'm not going to kind of
[40:31] go that direction and maybe uh a few
[40:34] things to just help us to see where we
[40:37] are i appreciate brother keith
[40:40] that's that's my name for brother uh i
[40:43] i'm i'll jack his name up so
[40:45] that's my name for him so he'll know
[40:47] brother keith
[40:49] uh last on last sunday uh
[40:53] we preached you know i i anybody that
[40:56] knows me
[40:57] boy i will jack your name up if i can't
[40:59] pronounce it so
[41:00] i don't want to mess up with brother
[41:02] name
[41:04] but on last sunday he preached a dynamic
[41:07] message
[41:08] and i just thought that it just really
[41:10] it just really
[41:11] dovetailed with what's been on my heart
[41:14] for
[41:15] just a couple of a couple of weeks i'm
[41:18] kind of i got a lot of things that i
[41:20] decided to preach on i've been to
[41:22] ministers meetings and
[41:23] i've been listening to the brothers so
[41:26] uh i got a tablet full of things but uh
[41:28] this is the way we're gonna go this
[41:30] morning
[41:31] uh um the oneness at the seventh
[41:35] junction and like we say brother jackson
[41:37] has been
[41:37] uh preaching on uh the seventh junction
[41:41] so i wanna maybe start out here just for
[41:43] a moment
[41:44] so we will understand um
[41:48] what these things mean now if you know
[41:50] if you know anything about me
[41:52] you know i know a lot of ministers and i
[41:54] like to see people excited
[41:56] but one thing i've learned over the
[41:58] years excitement
[42:00] don't produce a whole lot because we
[42:02] ain't always excited i say this a lot
[42:05] if you know me i'll keep saying this the
[42:07] thing for me is that um
[42:09] when people start gravitating towards
[42:12] the word
[42:13] and the word becomes more real
[42:23] when you see people become more anchored
[42:26] and stabilized in the word of god
[42:28] that means more to me amen
[42:32] than anything we've been around the
[42:34] gospel for a long time i've seen a lot
[42:36] of people scream i've seen a lot of
[42:38] people holler
[42:39] i've seen people run around in church
[42:42] but
[42:43] when i look at things a lot of times it
[42:45] seems like we're more
[42:47] unsettled than we've ever been yeah
[42:51] you know i watch things i'm not saying
[42:53] this to be a small addict like i know it
[42:55] all
[42:56] but i i you know it kind of got a little
[42:59] bit of a gift
[43:01] and you see things and you realize that
[43:03] people aren't catching it
[43:04] yeah right right and and all i want for
[43:07] for a group of people
[43:08] is to get it is to catch it
[43:12] the problem makes a statement he said
[43:14] you're gonna understand
[43:16] right and for me you just want for us to
[43:18] understand
[43:20] because when people start getting
[43:22] understanding
[43:24] it it makes things a lot easy for all of
[43:27] us
[43:28] right right right right for the ministry
[43:32] sometimes you know we we say well that's
[43:34] all the pastor preaching
[43:35] that's not deep but that's right where
[43:38] you are i preach you
[43:40] something way up here and you're not up
[43:42] there right
[43:44] right you you gotta go to a place where
[43:49] uh it's just like a baby that baby that
[43:51] just got dedicated
[43:52] they're not going to get if they're
[43:54] smart parents
[43:56] i'm not going to be trying to feed that
[43:57] baby escape
[43:59] yeah right when he's still on milk
[44:02] or our own milk that was kind of a
[44:05] greedy baby
[44:09] my mother told me say man when i was a
[44:12] little fellow
[44:13] i cried all the time my grandmother said
[44:15] give that baby some cereal
[44:18] say that milk ain't doing it for that
[44:22] amen thank god for syria
[44:25] but but i had to gravitate towards that
[44:29] amen so i want to read us a couple of
[44:31] things to establish to show us where
[44:34] we are at this morning and then i just
[44:36] kind of uh y'all
[44:38] pray for me move us move us as as
[44:41] fast as i possibly can but uh uh we
[44:44] we want us to get he says uh give me a
[44:48] church
[44:48] ready visible to see the signs and to
[44:51] see them
[44:51] the omnipotent god the great power of
[44:54] god
[44:55] moving amongst the people which the
[44:58] rapture will be an easy thing
[45:00] when jesus comes they'll be caught up
[45:02] because
[45:03] they believe in sex aren't you glad you
[45:07] believe in the rapture
[45:09] amen um
[45:13] he says um because they believe in such
[45:16] he says sure we're at the end time
[45:19] right yes let's establish that where we
[45:22] are
[45:22] right we're not in the first age right
[45:26] we we in we're in the end time right
[45:29] right operating up under the eagle
[45:31] anointing this morning right now
[45:33] right we're not in we're not in the
[45:35] middle
[45:36] we're not in luke's age we're not in
[45:38] wesley's age
[45:40] we right we're not even in the
[45:41] pentecostal age
[45:44] come on
[45:52] right glory to god we're not in
[45:55] denomination
[45:56] come on we're not a denomination
[46:00] we're not in the pentecostal age
[46:03] we we thank god for uh uh
[46:07] uh god sending us a prophet amen right
[46:10] to elevate us because they had amen they
[46:13] had signs wonders and
[46:15] miracles and gifts and things of that
[46:17] nature but they still had so many things

[51:28] amen what god has been doing yes sir
[51:32] glory to god something that that goes
[51:34] beyond just
[51:35] and as much as i enjoy you're not going
[51:37] to preach all the prosperity messages
[51:41] right but then you really won't
[51:44] understand what god is doing see
[51:46] the the message is a different focus for
[51:49] us
[51:50] has been a different focus but but let
[51:53] me let me get into this uh he says
[51:55] it's pertaining to the coming of the
[51:57] lord he said lord when i'm gonna speak
[52:00] uh uh uh i want to speak on what is the
[52:03] uh
[52:04] the unforgiving sin and and be sure to
[52:08] try to
[52:08] get folks here tomorrow uh he said
[52:12] that the lord coming is near at hand
[52:15] my subject is the seventh junction so
[52:18] so y'all with me so far yeah man this
[52:21] this is where we're at right
[52:24] and so we we want we want to get started
[52:27] this morning
[52:28] so that we could understand um
[52:32] what what god is doing one of the things
[52:35] we we've learned in studying
[52:37] is that redemption is is to bring back
[52:41] is that right you know uh
[52:45] i might um preached on these lines here
[52:47] before but
[52:48] one thing i've learned sometimes it take
[52:51] preaching the subject a hundred times
[52:52] before folks really even get it
[52:55] now i've been preaching over 27 years
[52:58] maybe
[52:59] and i'm still learning i'm still i'm
[53:01] still growing i'm still
[53:03] being inspired so if i say something
[53:05] that you've heard
[53:06] uh before don't don't don't worry about
[53:09] it
[53:10] right because it'll just everything
[53:13] makes sense you know
[53:14] there's a lot of sermons that have been
[53:17] preached over the last
[53:19] since january um since we've been here
[53:22] and you you've watched the inspiration
[53:24] brother paul
[53:26] right brother king brother troy
[53:29] brother jack and and if you it's
[53:32] something that god is trying to get over
[53:34] to you
[53:36] right god realizes this and i'm gonna
[53:39] say this and i hope this don't hurt to
[53:40] feel it
[53:41] god realize we're scattered all right
[53:43] man
[53:44] all right come on church we're scattered
[53:48] we're scattered in our thinking
[53:51] right come on church we're scattered in
[53:54] our
[53:55] amen but if you go back to the book of
[53:58] ephesians
[53:59] paul wants for amen the people to
[54:03] be established i believe brother jack
[54:07] wants for the church to be established
[54:10] that's why he's setting up these
[54:12] different things the terrorist services
[54:14] and all of these different types of
[54:15] things
[54:16] because the church the gifts are given
[54:19] to the church to keep the church clean
[54:22] right god placed these things in the
[54:25] church god
[54:26] never took these things
[54:30] yeah i'm gonna say this man gifts will
[54:33] cow for church
[54:51] i don't want to get in trouble let me
[54:53] let your brother jack get in trouble for
[54:55] now
[54:56] that's why i'm glad to be here i don't
[54:57] have to worry about getting in trouble
[55:01] right what gifts will tell the
[55:05] if if things is not operated according
[55:09] to scripture
[55:11] you know paul paul told them in the book
[55:14] of corinthians when they were speaking
[55:16] in times and that they was just
[55:17] wow
[55:27] we got to place these things in order he
[55:29] said because if an
[55:30] unalert person come in and see all y'all
[55:42] [Music]
[55:46] crazy he said he called him barbarians
[55:50] right he said ain't got people crazy up
[55:52] in there man
[55:53] me and brother troy oh i'll tell you all
[55:55] the story many many years ago me and
[55:56] brother troy we went to a spot
[55:58] you know we just like to get out and try
[56:00] to witness and stuff this way back in
[56:02] the day
[56:03] and and we just went to a place and i
[56:06] had my hand and brother on
[56:07] i think on the radio so it was close to
[56:09] the church we stopped there one day
[56:11] and man oh man that thing
[56:20] glory to god me and troy looking at each
[56:22] other
[56:23] and they just did things that were so
[56:25] contrary to the person's life
[56:32] [Applause]
[56:43] a propeller there because
[56:46] churches carry spirits people carry
[56:48] spirits
[56:49] that's right yeah glory to god i'm like
[56:52] boy
[56:52] i don't know what that's really about
[56:54] here brother troy
[56:57] yeah okay let me get that out of the way
[57:00] y'all pray for me my time is getting
[57:02] away
[57:03] but but we want for us to be settled
[57:05] right yes
[57:06] amen so uh we we're at the end time
[57:11] and and we we want to show and then i
[57:14] think the only way you can ever do this
[57:16] you've always got to go back to the
[57:18] beginning
[57:20] notice in in the way that the prophet of
[57:22] god taught
[57:23] he he always talk back to pentecost
[57:27] right or or he always look back to
[57:30] genesis
[57:32] and one of the things that even brother
[57:34] jack even i think he even struck this uh
[57:36] wednesday night
[57:38] um to show in christ the mystery of god
[57:41] revealed
[57:42] the three things that that god is doing
[57:45] right right and we just shut shouting
[57:48] and jumping
[57:49] we understand you gotta understand what
[57:52] god is doing right he's trying to reveal
[57:55] himself
[57:56] preeminence and he's trying to get us
[57:58] back
[58:00] see we're going somewhere we're
[58:02] transitioning
[58:03] we're not a people standing still well
[58:05] it just don't seem like
[58:07] nothing going on in the church you lying
[58:10] to me
[58:12] we can't be standing still and going
[58:15] somewhere at the same time
[58:17] either you standing still or you moving
[58:20] now
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:34] the church of the living gods has been
[58:37] always been on the move
[58:40] [Applause]
[58:41] i said church that's it don't never let
[58:44] nobody
[58:45] get in the pool pit say well there ain't
[58:47] nothing going on in the church
[58:50] don't seem like it's you it's your way
[58:53] of thinking
[58:55] versus the way that god does things god
[58:58] don't need your
[58:59] permission to do anything
[59:03] right god does his things according to
[59:06] his work
[59:07] now now let's look at the the book of
[59:10] genesis because what we find in the book
[59:12] of genesis
[59:14] is is god's first and perfect
[59:17] acts and one of the things we know
[59:21] when we look at the book of genesis we
[59:24] see god's thoughts perfect
[59:29] right perfect perfect thoughts expressed
[59:34] a word is a a a a thought expressed
[59:38] right and what god brought amen into
[59:41] existence
[59:42] was perfection
[59:46] when uh brother key was preaching last
[59:48] sunday brock understood on something but
[59:50] i was scared i might fall
[59:55] right he was talking about uh perfect
[59:58] perfect attributes right
[1:00:02] let me get it right i thought i had it
[1:00:04] wrote down
[1:00:05] somewhere a perfect eternal attribute
[1:00:09] perfecting our uh eternal attributes
[1:00:13] right
[1:00:14] yeah those things deal with perfection
[1:00:17] amen those things deal with god
[1:00:20] right see and so what we what we
[1:00:24] what we find in when we look in genesis
[1:00:27] we find something that's eternal
[1:00:31] eternal being we we find
[1:00:34] perfection right we find
[1:00:37] adam as our amateur god
[1:00:41] right this was before the fall come on
[1:00:43] that's right
[1:00:44] right this one's before you you you find
[1:00:48] um um a oneness right harmony
[1:00:52] these things is great to look at is that
[1:00:54] right you say well why are you doing
[1:00:55] this because i
[1:00:56] you gotta understand what god is doing
[1:00:59] in the midst of the
[1:01:00] spirit of true tabernacles
[1:01:04] what what all of brother jack labor is
[1:01:07] all about
[1:01:08] i'm just getting there right quick it's
[1:01:10] trying to produce a oneness
[1:01:12] in the midst of the body
[1:01:14] [Applause]
[1:01:15] right amen and and you
[1:01:19] you gotta because see if we if we're
[1:01:22] working
[1:01:23] with redemption yeah
[1:01:26] right yeah you gotta look back come on
[1:01:29] right come on oh yeah all right you you
[1:01:32] gotta take a look back
[1:01:34] at what was see
[1:01:37] uh uh what was has to be be
[1:01:40] taking place now unless we got to be
[1:01:43] understanding the work of redemption
[1:01:47] all right we're just dealing with good
[1:01:49] messages and
[1:01:50] things of that nature everybody trying
[1:01:52] to out preach everybody to be smart
[1:01:55] that ain't what we're working with we're
[1:01:57] trying
[1:01:58] we're trying to speak amen into the
[1:02:01] heart
[1:02:02] and lives of people where they can
[1:02:04] understand
[1:02:05] what's actually going on what's actually
[1:02:09] being taught
[1:02:11] is that right see glory to his wonderful
[1:02:15] name
[1:02:16] when you you you anytime you start
[1:02:18] talking about
[1:02:19] perfection you got to be able to look
[1:02:21] back
[1:02:22] right how do you go all the way back to
[1:02:25] to the beginning
[1:02:27] right all the way back to genesis is
[1:02:30] there you find amen uh eternal
[1:02:34] and perfect thoughts right is there
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:38] you really begin to understand what god
[1:02:41] what was in
[1:02:42] god's mind fatherhood all of these
[1:02:45] different things i mean we could go back
[1:02:48] brother battle said uh we can go back
[1:02:50] further
[1:02:52] than genesis 1-1 he takes us all the way
[1:02:55] back to what was in his
[1:02:57] mind what was in god's mind
[1:03:00] before one word was ever spoken
[1:03:05] you gotta make it shout out to think
[1:03:08] that i was an eternal thought
[1:03:10] hallelujah
[1:03:14] before
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:20] [Applause]

[1:03:27] acted silly as a young person
[1:03:32] when i was acting silly you know on
[1:03:35] drugs and disobedient
[1:03:37] and and all of that i wouldn't listen to
[1:03:39] my mom lord
[1:03:41] oh glory to god i was in god's
[1:03:44] mind amen i was in
[1:03:47] god when he was on amen calvary
[1:03:52] i was in him
[1:03:55] and brought forth but we ain't going
[1:03:57] there this morning
[1:03:58] all right right come on now yeah
[1:04:01] come on thank god for that right
[1:04:05] but watch the oneness
[1:04:08] and the harmony was broken
[1:04:12] all right that's right all right it was
[1:04:15] broken because
[1:04:17] of disbelief i'm gonna bypass some stuff
[1:04:20] i got
[1:04:20] alright uh uh uh when eve
[1:04:24] disbelieved the word it broke
[1:04:28] the fellowship it broke the oneness
[1:04:32] it broke the the harmony
[1:04:36] i mean it it was it was it started the
[1:04:40] reason why we go through a lot of what
[1:04:41] we go through
[1:04:43] right i guess maybe we can
[1:04:46] we can't even blame it on eve now let's
[1:04:48] take that out
[1:04:50] cause even brother brother say we we
[1:04:52] can't really do it
[1:04:54] right because something has come into
[1:04:57] play
[1:04:58] to alter that right so so
[1:05:01] so when we start trying to look at the
[1:05:04] old man and all this man
[1:05:06] we need to stop now come on now
[1:05:10] why because we got perfect word perfect
[1:05:13] interpretation of the word of god
[1:05:16] so we can't blame eve anymore especially
[1:05:19] since the book has been open
[1:05:23] right and all the mysteries of god has
[1:05:26] been revealed
[1:05:28] then it starts to take away all of our

[1:06:35] excuses
[1:06:38] thinking changed she thought
[1:06:41] could you imagine a person
[1:06:44] in that thinking thinking that their
[1:06:47] thinking supersedes the thinking
[1:06:49] and the thoughts of god
[1:06:52] this is where we're at today there ain't
[1:06:54] no difference that's right
[1:06:57] amen it's not no difference

[1:07:28] in in a
[1:07:29] oneness right hey man

[1:08:26] nobody not speaking i'm preaching to me
[1:08:31] i don't want y'all to think i'm
[1:08:32] preaching at you i've been married now
[1:08:34] 27 years old glory to god
[1:08:39] but could you imagine what it was
[1:08:42] right but i i i i don't want to leave
[1:08:44] you at what it was
[1:08:47] i want to show us what he is doing
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:09:04] he said to be united
[1:09:07] not this was pulling this way and this
[1:09:09] one pulling that way no
[1:09:10] to be united he said now this is
[1:09:14] quite a subject and when i started i had
[1:09:17] i had my my perspective based upon
[1:09:20] what brother jack was preaching but then
[1:09:22] you know i
[1:09:24] like this this subject it just it just
[1:09:26] gets big
[1:09:27] right because even brother better he
[1:09:29] says
[1:09:30] this is quite a subject it deserves a
[1:09:34] lot more attention that i have able to
[1:09:36] give it
[1:09:37] and more than most any person on earth
[1:09:40] could be able to give

[1:27:31] god it's still blood on the mercy
[1:27:34] preachers a lot of times preach
[1:27:36] bloodless mercy
[1:27:39] judgment judgment judgment judgment
[1:27:41] judgment judgment
[1:27:43] condemnation is that right
[1:27:46] instead of preaching the blood

[1:28:38] it's god's stuff we're talking about the
[1:28:40] mind of god yeah
[1:28:42] sometimes you wonder what kind of mind
[1:28:43] folk really have yeah

[1:45:45] he says and watch this
[1:45:49] and i'ma close let the musicians make
[1:45:50] their way up he said and it
[1:45:52] is the only grounds of fellowship that
[1:45:55] god has ever laid down for himself and
[1:45:58] his church
[1:46:00] is the oneness of himself in the people
[1:46:04] right that's the only grounds of
[1:46:06] fellowship
[1:46:07] and the only way that you can have those
[1:46:11] grounds is by a
[1:46:12] union that's why i say apart from that
[1:46:16] forget it
[1:46:18] forget it if none of us get the
[1:46:21] get married to the revealed word forget

[1:46:38] fellowship right the only ground
[1:46:41] the only way that you can have those
[1:46:42] grounds is by a union to be united with
[1:46:44] him forever
[1:46:46] just like when you united with your
[1:46:48] husband the wife to be united
[1:46:50] with her husband it is violent to death
[1:46:53] now then
[1:46:54] when you unite with god it's the same
[1:46:56] thing
[1:46:57] that the church united with christ it's
[1:47:00] unto
[1:47:00] death we part and then if you never sin
[1:47:04] and do anything wrong you'll be
[1:47:06] eternally
[1:47:07] united with god and the only death can
[1:47:10] take you away from god right

[1:58:35] timely and people and
[1:58:37] i just love the way god uses uh his
[1:58:40] different
[1:58:41] gifts uh how he just kind of piggy back
[1:58:43] right off of uh brother
[1:58:45] um kweku's sermon and keep calling
[1:58:47] brother key brother
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:52] but uh brother quake who he uh he
[1:58:56] he blessed us amen last week and just
[1:58:58] kind of talking about those
[1:58:59] attributes got the afterwards you know
[1:59:02] there's
[1:59:03] things that god put inside of you before
[1:59:06] you were even born
[1:59:07] and these were things to bring glory and
[1:59:09] honor back to him
[1:59:10] right and as uh brother brother smiley
[1:59:12] just kind of piggy back right off of
[1:59:14] that thought and just you know it's got
[1:59:15] to be
[1:59:16] oneness if we would just submit
[1:59:17] ourselves to the word it's not
[1:59:18] submitting to brother jack
[1:59:20] but submitting to the word of god if we
[1:59:22] submit ourselves to the lord we're going
[1:59:23] to see god do great things in the midst
[1:59:25] of
[1:59:25] those people i watch god bless
[1:59:29] naturally right you know yesterday i
[1:59:32] dedicated a house amen to one of the
[1:59:34] saints here and i walked inside the
[1:59:36] house and said oh lord
[1:59:37] god you've been good lord
[1:59:41] and uh and i'm looking for some other
[1:59:43] dedication of some other houses
[1:59:46] i know god is already moving already i'm
[1:59:48] also looking for a dedication of
[1:59:50] our house i'm looking for that
[1:59:54] but those are natural things now we want
[1:59:57] to see god do some things spiritually
[2:00:00] and in order for him to do that we have
[2:00:01] to have a oneness
[2:00:03] we have to have a oneness and i just
[2:00:05] love the way brother smiley just
[2:00:06] was led to just kind of take that quote
[2:00:08] took about three paragraphs and just
[2:00:11] laid it out for us i said god you know
[2:00:13] how to speak to us
[2:00:14] he knows exactly how to speak so i
[2:00:16] appreciate the word of the lord
[2:00:18] amen on today god bless you brother
[2:00:21] smiley amen thank you for sharing
[2:00:23] your heart with us blessed be the name
[2:00:26] of the lord
[2:00:28] uh before we leave i just want to just
[2:00:30] quickly mention i need to just have a
[2:00:32] brief meeting with the with the church
[2:00:33] amen after service of just you
[2:00:35] you don't remind just remain seated i
[2:00:38] wanted to speak to you
[2:00:39] about two things real quick and then uh
[2:00:41] we'll
[2:00:42] we'll dismiss you for the day but uh
[2:00:44] just for the sakes of the church the
[2:00:45] visitors are certainly uh be dismissed
[2:00:47] when we said this mission prayer but the
[2:00:48] saints just remind remain
[2:00:50] seated just for a brief second so i can
[2:00:52] just mention two things to you uh
[2:00:54] also want to have prayer brother quentin
[2:00:56] mentioned to me that his neighbor
[2:00:58] uh i believe her name is barbara she's
[2:01:00] on the way to the hospital
[2:01:02] and um she was really trying not to go
[2:01:05] because a husband's in a state where he
[2:01:07] really needs
[2:01:08] her uh and uh but you know just
[2:01:11] a a trial has come amen upon this
[2:01:13] neighbor
[2:01:14] and we want to just remember barbara at
[2:01:16] this time of prayer that god would touch
[2:01:18] her god would touch her husband
[2:01:20] and just just guide them through the
[2:01:21] situation it's not even by accident that
[2:01:23] brother quentin became a neighbor
[2:01:25] of these people amen it's not by
[2:01:27] accident so
[2:01:28] uh it's good that we can take uh these
[2:01:30] things to the lord in prayer on behalf
[2:01:32] of those that
[2:01:33] uh our neighbors to us so we want to
[2:01:35] remember amen barbara in prayer
[2:01:37] let us bow our heads amen and prepare to
[2:01:40] close the service at this time
[2:01:42] and remember barbara and prayer father
[2:01:44] we thank you for
[2:01:45] uh all that you have done here today
[2:01:49] lord we just appreciate all the worship
[2:01:52] we appreciate the word of god that has
[2:01:54] been given to us
[2:01:55] and lord how we are strengthened and
[2:01:56] encouraged
[2:01:58] by what we have heard lord
[2:02:01] you're calling us to oneness when we see
[2:02:03] things in disarray and out of order
[2:02:06] god you don't want to leave it like that
[2:02:08] when you saw adam and eve
[2:02:09] uh kind of fall from the order that was
[2:02:12] in the garden
[2:02:13] a time when there was no heartache no
[2:02:15] pain no headaches no sickness no
[2:02:17] disease no pandemics nothing lord
[2:02:19] everything was so
[2:02:20] peaceful and harmony father that existed
[2:02:22] in the garden if that was the initial
[2:02:25] thought of
[2:02:25] mine god that is the eternal thought of
[2:02:28] your mind and that's exactly what you're
[2:02:30] looking for
[2:02:31] even in our midst so what we pray for
[2:02:33] unity not just in the body but unity in
[2:02:35] the homes
[2:02:36] uh unity husband and wife unity with the
[2:02:40] children
[2:02:40] lord may the spirit of god just bring
[2:02:43] this unity there some things we
[2:02:45] we we try to fix but we can't fix but
[2:02:47] father you have supernatural
[2:02:49] uh uh strength you're able to like the
[2:02:51] prophet say you're able to unravel or
[2:02:53] not so god somehow

[2:03:03] want you to have the preeminence
[2:03:04] in our homes want you to have the
[2:03:05] preeminence in the church of god so
[2:03:07] we're trusting that you would get glory
[2:03:09] that it won't just be a sermon
[2:03:11] but it become a man of manifestation in
[2:03:13] all of our lives
