that you do amen the Lord knows everything that you need you have to see this way sometimes we look at circumstances and we we honing on circumstances instead of honing on Jesus Christ but the Lord wants us to just take our eyes off the circumstance and just focus on him because his eternal life he's the one who put you here he's the one who allowed the circumstances you might say why did he allow the circumstances then that his name will be glorified that something that he planted in you will come out of you the seed the faith their life the love the stability The Joy the Christ in you

the the reason of his existence amen if the Lord can help us catch that Revelation that we are the reason why he existed because without you you cannot show the attributes amen the Lord could have made the stars and the moon and the sun to pray the gospel but he made human beings to preach the gospel he made human beings to leave the gospel he made human means to portray and to manifest his

to the Lord we just have a couple of uh scriptures two scriptures one is from Mark chapter 11 verse 22 to 24. we want to thank the lord we have a visitor with us I think it's sister Mylene Mala God bless sister Mila you welcome the Lord be with you amen amen God bless you so Mark chapter 11 verse 22-24 Mark 11 22-24 and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever was River whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you that what things so ever you desire when he pray believe that you receive them and ye shall receive them let's repeat that 24 therefore I say unto you what things so ever ye desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall receive them amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's see let's go to John 11 22-25 if there's anything on your heart before you pray believe that you will receive them and when you pray in your prayers you've already received them and ye shall receive them amen John 11 22-25 this was a conversation that was going on between Martha and the Lord Jesus Christ when his brother Lazarus passed away he was dead the life went out of him and 22 said but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee then said unto her that Jesus said unto her thy brother shall arise thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day now Martha want her brother to rise and it's before the author of life the one who put a breath into his brother Lazarus and he said your brother shall rise but then the mother is postponing her blessing to put it at the last day in the future but the Lord is so kind and good and beautiful he's the god of I am is the present the God is the one who is who is amen he said Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen we shall take our seat God bless you glory to the Lord I am that I am is here and when you pray believe and when you believe you shall receive amen it doesn't matter what try and take your eyes off the issue and concentrate on Jesus Christ in you amen first of all you have to have him in you it's not enough being in the church it's not enough being in Christendom but then if Christ is not the inside your mind will be scattering all around looking at circumstances but not a cry because you don't have him here but when you have Christ at the center of your life then you have to hone in on the Christ in you he's the center of existence of all things amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so now believe from your heart the supernatural let's go to I want to look at the seed I'm going to look at new birth and I want to hone in on the children for the sake of time and they're sitting arrangement I wish I have all the children with in front of me but God willing someday will have it so I want you the children to just listen to this message is directly from my heart to you from the Lord to you amen the Lord has blessing for you the children you are the future of tomorrow and God is preparing you for something beyond your thinking amen and I don't know if it's a prophecy but I believe maybe between five years and 10 years but the jack is going to have a bunch of preachers here who is going to send some of them out to preach Minister somewhere else amen a lot of young beautiful preachers men and women of God that God is going to use amen the Lord bless you our brother Jerry brother Quentin Jr and the little ones that have got a gift seed in them brother brother Joseph and brother Xander and brother Xavier and many men and young sisters and young Brothers the Lord bless you all sister hadashes sister Abigail sister Shalom and every one of you I don't know all of your names but the Lord knows your name amen Glory Hallelujah the Lord bless you but then we want to see how this seed that the Lord planted before the foundation of the world will come out of you and manifest the way the Lord wants it so let's look at what is a seed I was just looking at the dictionary what is a seed now the seed of a plant looking at from the plant direction we have a lot of seed human beings are seed but we just want to focus on Plants he said the city is a unit a unit of reproduction in flowering plants capable of developing into another such plant so a seed of banana or bring for banana a seed of I have some seed I want to use illustration if you don't mind amen Glory Hallelujah of God what is this avocado or Spanish called awakati now this is a seed and I tried to get a couple of leaves of the same seed some this is where the Green Seed uh sorry Green Leaf and we have the dried leaves here and then we have the fruits the fruit of avocado itself amen let me try and squeeze them here here we go God bless you thank you maybe it's meant to be it's going to be part of the illustration so now he said they said it's a unit of reproduction in plants which is capable of developing into another search plan so if you plant this sea which is what avocado or avocate or pear is going to bring for the same thing amen and you are a seed I may see it the Lord planted you as Christ and you have to comfort as what as Christ but then before you come for this seed you have to go through cycle and bring forth flowers bring forth tree Twigs leaves and then pray for another search fruits sorry seed with fruits on it amen this is the fruit is what we eat of course we can use a seed for medicine and different things but then I want to just focus on the seed now where is the life of this seed coming from there's a life form in this seed and this life form is coming from the sixth dimension when he said this is dimension don't be scared it's just the mind of God is Christ it's another problem another sphere which is right here physically speaking but it's of another dimension that this eyes cannot detect it is meant for the heart to detect that dimension it means for you who has got Christ in you to see Christ in you amen so there's a life that the Lord spoke in Genesis that every seed should bring forth according to its kind the Genesis 1. so that that life before this seed fell on this ground and developed that life existed as an avocado seed or a avocado plant now that life on the other side the sixth Dimension has to reflect here in Earth the first second dimension First Dimension is just the space we're living in second dimension is matter if anything you can touch human body the computer whatever you can touch you can see a second dimension Third Dimension is time the dimension the realm that we are living in fourth dimension is communication science Internet TV computer microphone mobile phone all of them constitute the four dimension the First Dimension is a contrast which is hell Satan Lucifer demons cancer death crying suffering pain they have to come forth as a contrast so that they says that men should be manifested the sixth Dimension is Christ Jesus heaven eternity and peace and joy the word they feel funny the logos eternal life the seventh Dimension is Elohim the mind of Jesus Christ amen now this Dimension God had in mind to express everything was in him but he wanted to bring forth avocado seed as a tree as a fruit knowing that some of his children would love to enjoy these fruits some may use it for even the hair some will use it for boil the seed and their leaves for medicine so before the foundation of the world the lord spoke Let There Be avocado seed avocado tree and there was nothing in existence it was all in him but because it is the spoken word of the Almighty creation has to happen to bring the life the avocados tree that was there translated from the sixth Dimension into the first second and third dimension in Earth to grow in Earth in Florida or wherever it's come from so that you can enjoy this seed amen now there's a lot that governs reproduction the law is the spoken word of God what God spoke into existence is what is going to come to pass amen now let's go back now come to the human life god let's look at the second definition that's which I wrote myself seed Eternal thought of God capable of being transformed into Supernatural person that is a Christian a Christian is not somebody who believe that Jesus Christ died and resurrected that is on the nominal side by the Christian is a seed that has been transformed transferred transplanted from the mind of God and planted on Earth as a child to grow and now to manifest our life so a Christian is the one who has got Christ on the inside of him or her Glory Hallelujah to the Lord in a world we have religion as a Christian that's not what I'm talking about I want to hone on Christian a person with Jesus Christ Living on the inside of him or a person who has been transformed into Christ amen that when you are walking people see Christ in you when you are walking people see almighty God manifesting from your heart Glory Hallelujah the third definition is what I made up reproductive unit of eternal life which is seed reproductive unit of eternal life Sons and Daughters of Elohim as it was in the days of Pentecost Peter wasn't manifested as eternal life when he was cutting people's ears no when was casting people around no the seed was there but they said how they manifested by the day of Pentecost the seed was quickened the seat had to die first number one and then it has to remarry to eternal life amen so now let's look at how this seed it has to go to the ground it does everything about it has to rat everything in it even the gem has to rat but there's the spoken word of God that is spoke before the foundation of the world that governs the life of this seed and when everything is rotted then the life which is the mouth and the mind of Elohim will come out and manifest amen now let's look at how children grow if you get the best scientific machine the best security officer and what's the name I always forget the name Alia put Alia to watch how Alia is growing she's looking at me why did you mention my name Alia is growing if you get the best microscope telescopes the best whoever whatever eyes you have to watch how she's growing you never detect you can change Security offices 24 7 watch them maybe in about five weeks you're gonna see her height is increase she's getting some weight but how it increase you never know amen because it's something the Lord keep to himself amen how you sleep and wake up you know you go to sleep but in the course of your sleep you don't know what happened it's a mystery which belongs to the almighty amen even when you are on your bed the Lord is working on you he's healing you he's transforming you he's changing your character without you physically second dimensionally seeing because that life operate from the sixth Dimension Glory Hallelujah let's go go to the next slide let's look at the seed read a couple of quotations that the prophet talk about the seed we come back to it God The God Who is reaching mess in 1965 0119 paragraph 40 and said we was we were speaking the other night on how the seed Must Die this seed has to die completely I have a kind of dried one here I think I have yes this has begun dying now it has to die and everything around the gym of Life must not only die but rats if it doesn't rot it cannot leave and rat is completely done away with it's finished and until we get into the into the place that our own ideas and our own thinking is completely gone and is rotted away from us then the gem of Life can begin to leave amen 41 now we might I might inject just a little bit of Doctrine here if you don't believe it that's all right it's that's okay I don't believe I do believe I believe that a man when he's born in this life in this world that when you are a little baby born into the world you could not be here without being the full knowledge of God because he's infinite and he knows all things and when that little baby is born into the world there's something in that baby if he is ever going to have life there's a lot of something in there in that child then that he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him amen he's talking about the seed of eternal life it's not a lot of child and sooner or later he or she's going to manifest it 42 now if you've got eternal life tonight if you have eternal life then we always win and I want this one to I want to lock it in in your heart if you got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always win because there's only one form of eternal life we was we always were and the reason we wear because we were part of God Elohim and God is the only thing that is eternal so if you have eternal life then always eternally before you came out of your mother's womb before you were spam in your father's loins you existed as whoever you are not in flesh of Earth but in the celestial Dimension as a human being around the age of 18. amen glory to the Lord amen and that's where your eternal security lives so if you existed in the mind of God the man of God is not a thought of man or an architect who planning his mind have a blueprint on a book to build a house the thought of God is real so if you say Brother Joseph was a Son of God before the foundation of the world brother Keepers that Keepers who are sons and others of God before the foundation of the world they existed as brother Keepers and sister Keepers and Brother Joseph amen but not in human flesh would notice this Blood he was a Celestial body and the blood was the Holy Spirit possitting in him in that dimension but the Lord wanted to form Brother Joseph to manifest Christ in this dimension he wanted to manifest sister Keepers to manifest Jesus Christ in this dimension so he put him in a family mother father and then they got together and brought his life as a baby and that life was with him oblivious of that you see yourself as a little child a daughter playing with dolls and babies and different things but it's a gem of life that was planted in you before the foundation of the world and that gem has to Quicken and before that gym has to Quicken there's another life as a contrast that is also in you and our life that is what you came through your parents through the sex birth and those two lives are contradictory Christ and Antichrist Christ is eternal life Satan is temporal it's a contrast is the opposite is death a sickness is hell it's torment is suffering pain and crying by Christ allow that so that he can bring joy peace love salvation Redemption so that we can look at the two and appreciate this one amen when you've seen death before when people die what do we do we cry we mourn we have pains in our hearts but when a baby is born we have joy the whole family and friends are happy we give gifts because there's life on the other side of the even more glorious side when a son or a daughter of God is Born Into the kingdom of heaven there's Greater Joy in heaven amen because that life is eternal amen the baby no matter how beautiful how gorgeous the baby will grow and die one someday but in life eternal is it tender it doesn't have a beginner doesn't have an end Glory let's go to the next slide the seed has to rot as we Illustrated and bring forth life again the message Paradox 65 one zero zero one one seven products 101 how the seat falls into the ground and it rots and it brings forth life again looks like if it was ever going to bring forth life it would be when it's in it it isn't it is in its perfect shape if life was ever in it then why wouldn't it just come forth put it in the ground the Life Spring forth why does all that is around our life all that is around that gem that no man can find how is it that everything material around the gem has to die so it can bring forth a new life but everything around it must also die and rat before it can bring for their life so it is with an individual as long as there's any human injection human ideas then gas Gem of Life the Holy Spirit cannot work you cannot be healed as long as there's just a fraction somewhere a fraction of doubt in your mind then you're gonna hinder your healing but if it doesn't matter no matter what the daughters have said that your cancer is terminal cancer stage four your family should get your graveyard and use the money to buy your casket and prepare for a nice funeral if you can look Beyond and look at Christ now Lord I have something to do on Earth my brother my sister my friend hasn't finished his or her life but your enemy and my enemy the devil want to terminate is life but Lord I speak life into my brother I speak life into my sister I speak cancer out of existence and I create life in my brother in my uncle in my aunt the Lord will bring them out because the Lord is life amen and creation is in your heart creation is in your mouth you are a daughter of god sister Nelly amen you're a daughter of God my precious sisters amen and when you speak that life you don't have to worry about circumstances you don't have to worry whether the situation is even more worse when you prayed the Lord has already heard your prayer Glory Hallelujah to the Lord about three days ago a family in Colombia sent me a message one sister her mom had cancer when I went there the last time I saw the tumor rather and the tumor was there and it was the Lord by his grace was good to her she was healed but the devil will come back again now the devil was eating the whole arm off the pictures were graphic when she sent it to me and at the same time her grandbaby that was born has some hard disease she was in ICU less than six months another baby's gone back to ICU on critical condition at the same time her husband has lost her job he doesn't have a job and with one sister three crisis looming around her but I love her faith he said hermano brother pray for me and I believe that the Lord is going to use this situation to glorify his name so Friday when I left work I came to home and directly went into prayers and I prayed and sent praise to her and I did the same thing she called me yesterday to pray for her daughter because the daughter is only one with a in the hospital in the ICU and said brother me and my daughter have testified in the hospital the mothers that the Lord is going to bring glory to his name and I know my grandbaby she's called Milagro gabin melako Miracle Gabriela Milagro Gabi he said Milagro Gabi who live amen because the daughter said the chance of living is very very slim but faith is overcomer so this morning no yesterday she sent another message brother he said when you pray for my daughter and my grandbaby the daughters were surprised he said there's a daughter that I ministered to he didn't believe that Lazarus Resurrected but he rather believed that Lazarus was directed into eternal life but not in this life there's no way somebody can die and come back to life and he's the daughter that gave my grandbaby a slim chance to live and she said oh for some reason things have turned around and she has gone so better and she's doing so great the Lord will shut the mouth of the unbeliever if you can start and believe amen life is in you amen I don't know where I got you I think I have 10 102 same thing I think I read okay let's see so it is as long as you have got okay I read it's got to it's got all the human elements all the scientific ideas all the days of Miracle is past so called all that he has not only that but Rod then from there grows the gem of life onto a new life that's the only way it can grow 103. that's the reason we don't get what we ask for we try to take with us so much of our own ideas and some of our own ideas will be some of the ideas that doctors told you you swallow it into your heart and when you swallow the life the death will germinate in you but when you swallow life into you life will germinate into you from you amen Glory Hallelujah what do you want to choose to gem to swallow do you want to swallow death or life you choose to swallow life amen because you are life itself Glory now let's go to bringing from the seed and the plant and come back to human beings amen come out to eternal life sometimes there's a saying that we raise our children in the church they grow and then they go to the world and live that they live live like the devil and then they come back broken why does it has to happen that way why will a son and a daughter that you raised and committed to the Lord Jesus Christ sit in the church as a young child then he or she gets to a certain age he or she decide that no the church is not for him Christ is not for him there's better better life out there go and live like the devil or go and live just as devil and then when he or she is broken turn to pieces now when he want to find Christ what can we do to prevent that let's look at the center of the issue amen so the children this is my message for you some of you want to become pastors Brother Joseph Alexander and uh some of you I remember your dream and I pray for you amen Brother Joseph want to be a pastor if I remember the name of his church is going to be holy ghost Tabernacle is that right but Alexander want to be a pastor and uh but uh Xavier want to be a deacon and he's just a you need to learn a little bit more about a Troy so they already identified their Ministries amen and we have to pray for them amen and our young sisters because the devil is not going to watch them grow just like that the Lord is going to contrast everything they said but the Lord has given us grace and mercy that when they have the Holy Ghost baptism that will be the solution to keep them out of the world to keep them in Christ and to keep Christ in them amen recently brother Jose and I went to minister somewhere Homestead right and they were fellowshipping with in a passenger side with a young man 18 year old is a very nice young man even in the in the house of the Lord he's a song leader something like that very nice young man you could see the Lord is with him so in the conversation I asked him brother are you born again do you have the new birth and begin to search through his mind he said I'm not sure and we're going to search it so I was just watching him he went to his heart he said no brother I don't have the Holy Ghost baptism say you need it that wouldn't make the difference you could be in the church and then everything is going good and a girl from high school or a boyfriend on the street or a neighbor will come and tell you I love you just one word and you begin to process it wow this handsome boy tells me he loves me this handsome lady tells me she loves me I don't remember the last time even my own dad tells me told me he loved me my mom I don't even she doesn't even know about love I don't even know wow and this boy tells you let's go to restaurant you go to the restaurant let's go to movie show you go and watch the movie together instead of praying now you go and watch a movie with with your boyfriend or girlfriend and the devil is moving you step by step you think it's innocent you are still in your innocency nothing has happened you just go watch a movie everything's okay you go to restaurant together all is well you go and watch a basketball you go to town and do things go shopping and now the devil is moving you a little by little little by little he takes you out you go to him and invites you you know to his home you go to his home nothing happened the first day he's been nice with you but then he's moving closer he tried to touch you in a certain way and then one day before you realize your innocency is out he's gone through the window and then you've seen something that oh my then you keep on in that area and he misses your life you can't have your innocency back anymore God can forgive you you'll be redeemed you are a son and daughter of God but this guy has robbed you of your innocency but your parents did everything they could to raise you in church but you chose to jump the fence and go and see out there and a wolf a strong wolf at you up but what can we do to prevent our young Brothers our children being eaten up by wolves in the world and of course there's wolves amen demons tormenting spirit that will torment you if you let them be but if you are in Christ crisis in you they're under your foot under your feet you don't even worry about them amen they fear you you don't fear them if Christ is in you you don't fear demons no when you are working not you but the Christ in you dispel those demons amen and that's why we need Christ on the inside of us not on the outside not only in the pastor not only in the deacons not in my mother but as a son that said it's me it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer it's me it's me it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer not my pastor not my father not my mother it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer it's me it's me it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer so there's a time it's not your father your father has got his experience your pastor has his experience your ministers have the experience but you need your experience glory to the Lord let's go to the next uh slide now let's go to the center of the Holy Ghost baptism you're a human being can I use brother okay who is right but just want to write can I use you amen Brother Joseph he's getting so tall it's going so quick but Joseph is a human being it's made up of three parts three components make Brother Joseph is there flesh predictions Joseph that we see but then on the inside that you don't speak speaking to the microphone God bless you God bless you thank you amen now there's another part of him that is speaking it comes out of the flesh that is a spirit realm move your hand walk a little bit two steps now the movement the steps you see the flesh their foot their feet but they say being the spirit on the inside of Brother Joseph that was making those four steps they've been on the inside of Joseph that was that was the one who said God bless you you may take your cigar bless you now on the oh I'm not done one one minute now there's a third aspect of Brother Joseph that is on the inside of the inside that you don't see a speck of him he's the one who controls the show you see the flesh you see brother Joseph moving you you can sense his spirit because you can hear his voice again God bless you God bless you now there's a being who controls the spirit and the flesh and that being is called the soul God bless you now the soul is the center of every activity let them divert a little bit a bit you know there's a war between Ukraine and Russia that war started in the mind of only one person Vladimir Putin Spirit a dimension from the underworld from hell move in his mind that they wanted to take over Ukraine of course the West is part of it United States Europe uh whatever they are part of it NATO but then a spirit move into his mind and he sent warships around Ukraine the question putting what are you doing he said I'm just going to have military drill military exercise and different presidents leaders try to work with him let's sit down macron Biden all of them talk to him that hey this war is going to affect the whole world let's have a let's have a deal but as a spirit I remember one time after my roommate we said you are tormenting me he said macron was tormenting him with too much talk because he was going to do what he was going to do your talk is not going to change an iota of his mind he was ready to war where did that Spirit come from he came from hell it came from the mind of Satan and injected into only one person and send Ukraine and even his own people Russian mothers are sending their children away because he wanted to recruit 300 1 000 people and people are fleeing not only Ukraine but Russia as well the economy is what is flipped upside down the war started with one person the same thing the Holy Ghost can start in just one mind amen this church started in the mind of one person God injected their mind in brother Jack daf to start a church and out of the one mind we have said in true Tabernacle is that right eternal life started in a man of one person the Lord Jesus Christ out of one mind millions billions and trillions of God's sons and others over the generations were safe it started in a mind of Jesus Christ who gave his life unto mankind amen so now let's see they saw the control tower the soul is the motive or the nature of the spirit there were questions in 1959 June 28th what is the difference between the Body Soul and Spirit also body spread and soul Ram said the body is the flesh that you look at that must rot it was born by sexual desire of father and mother it must rot it's not good and not always not acceptable by God you can't take this flesh the sixth Dimension no matter how much you can beautify this flesh give all the cream do the plastic surgery do face lift and you saw that whatever you tell me all the clothes that you want to wear you can wear sheepskin you can wear leopard skin you can wear elephant skin you can wear nylon you can wear cotton you can wear whatever you want you can wear polyester this body one day is going to drop to the Earth because he came from the earth and he's going to go back to the Earth but there's another body that didn't come from the Earth that came from the sixth dimension that is eternal that has no beginning that has no end that is a theophany Christ in flesh the wet body the logos that has no beginning that when this flesh drops he'll be right walking on and manifesting Through Time and Eternity that is the word body we want to talk about amen now he said this might as well therefore in the new birth in the resurrection subram is linking the new birth to the resurrection when you got a new birth you have Resurrected when Christ comes to you with the resurrection is Jesus Christ when you have him you have already resurrected you are not afraid of death you are not afraid of sickness because you are the resurrected Jesus Christ working on two on two feet amen therefore you are brought forth when you are brought forth again in a new body it will be God's creative power that will speak like he did to Adam and you come forth job said I have a desire he will speak and I'll answer see now the body is what you look at the spirit is what controls you your spirit is what controls you the body is holding the microphone but what really helps the body to hold the microphone is the human Spirit on the inside but then their boss is the soul and that's why we were trying to go to now your soul is the motive of that spirit or the nature of that spirit the soul that's in it that's who shall die you are born in the world with a sinful soul that is the nature of your spirit is sinful you long for the things of the world so that is the soul that God is working on they saw that our fathers and our mother Brothers fought that was to the sixth birth that was a civilization of Lucifer that wasn't from the Eternal man of God that came from the permissive will of God so that God will be a savior but that is not Eternal Mind Of God so it can never come back to the presence of God you can leave 990. Methuselah is it 9 69 somewhere Adam 930 you're still gonna drop this flesh even Jesus Christ if he wasn't crucified at the age of 33 and a half and he lived a natural life he would have grown and died someday because the order that eternity put this flesh is to live up to a certain time and die so that the other side of life will be manifested amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so then the Holy Ghost comes down and baptizes you and changes the nature of that spirit the Holy Ghost is a consuming fire it consumes the old nature the old soul that was the permissive person take like a drunkard someone who drinks and smokes to Tobacco womanizer manager who who does that you got the police will arrest you arrest the flesh for committing a crime but the real criminal is hiding on the inside that is the soul that want to rape children that is the soul that I want to murder innocent people because his nature is to murder the scriptures that the Satan came to what to steal to kill and to destroy and Jesus Christ came to do what came to give life and give it abundantly so any nature will bring forth its kind amen so now is that the nature that is then the Holy Ghost comes down and baptizes you and changes the nature of that Spirit then the nature that is left on you is of heaven then you profess that you are a pilgrim and a stranger then you are born again from above from Heaven you are from above you are a candidate of Heaven you're a new creature in Christ Jesus with the same body The Same Spirit only it's change your body doesn't it's rearranged the atoms are rearranged but Lord doesn't crush the body and create another brother Joseph but then God rearranged their body God cleansed the spirit but the soul is what changes is consumed out of you and the soul of God eternal life is now living in you and your thinking is not like before your thinking is Christ on the inside he talks you from your heart you if you've got the Holy Ghost you can identify God speak on the inside literal voice like somebody speaking I don't want to go into testimonies all of you know better but I keep us know what I'm talking about all of you the experience you know God will say this situation he will rise from the inside and speak to your mind that my daughter my son I'm in control be not afraid you're gonna be healed your sons and your other situation be you'll be okay amen because there's a being that is on the inside and he's the one we are talking about amen and when that be the Eternal person takes over everything changes Glory Hallelujah to the Lord he said that is your you are a nature of the hospital this change from unrighteousness to righteousness that is soul body and spirit let's go to the next one Glory Hallelujah to the Lord still on the soul blessed be the name of the Lord Souls that are in prison Souls that are in prison 63 1 1 10 11. sorry 1 1 10 and paragraph 35. Abraham is still explaining Souls so now this Soul imprisoned this now this Source him now in prison Souls that are now in prison 36 now the soul of a man is not a body of a man their soul is not his flesh this flesh is dust potassium calcium Cosmic light sodium ion and water view that is not what is talking about the soul is another nature now the soul of a man is not the body of a man is the soul see and the soul is something that is the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hit in God through Christ still there by the Holy Spirit what is the Death part the old soul the soul that you came through your mother's birth that Soul has to die they sold that Senate it shall die amen and that scripture was from Ezekiel and Paul used the same scripture in Romans chapter 6 talking about the old husband and the new husband The Old Man and the new man who is the old man it's not an old man walking with a king no he's talking about Satan he came first through the sex birth then the new man is Christ Jesus the pillar of fire that consumes Satan from you and then he takes his Abode and transform your body consume the also cleanse your spirit cleanse your flesh and become a brand new unit working as a Son of God and you see the Angelic beings working with you amen if the Lord make you a sensitive person sometimes when you get by yourself the Lord want to communicate with you just like a husband wants to communicate with a wife sometimes when you get by yourself you see that Dimension as if somebody walking with you who is that working with you is the pillar of fire in you is the Holy Ghost in you is your true brother Solomon amen the true you want to Fellowship want to make himself to known to you and it brings songs in your heart and bring prayers scriptures things of Eternal value he brings love into your heart amen sometimes out of nowhere you begin to sing out of no you're beginning to pray out of nowhere you just go and kneel down and pray why they say being in you that want to communicate with you and that is your true nature by the Holy Ghost baptism glory to the Lord Almighty now this Soul's in prison I don't know where I am but I think is that I think I finished that one isn't it you became okay let's let's go on from here it's not is there anything that begins okay let me start from now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spray diet it was the nature of your spirit die that is to see the nature which is the soul so the new bed is the death to the old soul and life to Christ in you amen why do we sit in church for many years without being born again and then we found out that we're not what we profess to be when you are here when you're under your parents when you are with someone with the Holy Ghost baptism because there's Christ on him her atmosphere his atmosphere will create an atmosphere which will not permit the also to act so as long as you come to church even if you are not born again you have that Dimension around you as long as you stay under your parents who have got the Holy Ghost baptism even if you don't have experience that atmosphere covers you the devil cannot Act but then when you said oh no I don't want to be with my mom I'm 18 years old I want to go and rent my own place and live with my friends will say that's good then you rent a place with your friends maybe your girlfriends your boyfriends and the devil now in you said good good Lord I've got an atmosphere to act go by be go buy beer no no I was raised in China I don't drink beer something in you now begin to test for beer first for whiskey thanks for alcohol test for smoke cigarette was never even been part of your life but they said desire and begin to comes out you know what I'm just yeah I've never smoked before let me see what what is what is it all about you go buy a pack of Marlboro oh uh which ones for more whatever secret they sell out there you buy it and you start smoking all your friends give you one come on you're not a girl be a man you know you're drinking a party the first time you drink that Spirit has what birth into you now it's easy for you to drink you've never dressed improperly before your friends someone told me that selling women when they are starting to wear pants they struggle in their conscience because not part of them they struggle they want to wear their jeans they have to try and beat their conscience before finally they can sleep on their jeans because she was raised where she's used to wearing dresses covering herself but now she want to wear jeans for whatever reason weapons which belongs to men she has to kill a conscience to do that the first time you had sex with someone who's not your wife you have to kill your conscience because you know God didn't create you that way amen he created you to be a holy man and a holy woman amen until he gives your husband and your wife but then you have to beat your own conscience and do what God has nothing for you to do amen but if you can stay under the word of the Lord if you can subject yourself to the Holy Ghost to consume the old person the pillow fight will consume the old man and the purify himself will live in you and the life that will leave is no longer you but it's him that is living in you let men or the handsome men let them bring Lamborghini is that is a Lamborghini one million to give you as a gift to be your boyfriend he said down with your Lamborghini I've got Christ Jesus on the inside I love who I am I don't care about your money I don't care about the Mansion I've got Mansions Above amen I've got riches Untold amen I've got all Their Blessings because Christ is on the inside but if Christ is not on the inside you're gonna succumb to that pressure amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord he said now anything that begin has to end so there's only one way that you have to have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born here on Earth but when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils you became a living Soul then you begin amen now this natural life has a beginning but as eternal life which doesn't didn't begin that life is what is calling you my son my daughter this is not where you belong to you don't belong to fornication no you don't belong to drinking you don't belong to all this agendas of the world but you belong to Jesus Christ amen Glory Hallelujah I think invested same quotation have I I think I've done read this one so that I'm in prison let me go forward and see what I have the soul is the center of the new birth let me go back I don't know if I missed something I don't think I've read this one let's see the nature that was in you okay let's read this one uh yeah that nature that was in You by Nature was of the world that is the nature that you came through sex path you were actually an animal that's exactly right anyone knows that you were mammal how many knows that we are mammal we are warm-blooded animal but that's what we wear by our Earthly creation but you see what made us different from the other mammals that God put a soul upon you upon us now the other mamas don't have to wear clothes no other animals has to wear clothes to hide their shame his shame but us we are only ones that does because we have a soul but see God in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the Earth and brought up all kinds of animals from from the very lowest to the highest and the highest animal came forth was man 38 and then the first man was made he was a spirit man in the image of God which God is a spirit Saint John for now he's a spirit and then I worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth and then and thy word is the truth now we worship Him in truth and in spirit he is a spirit being and so are you amen let's go to the next quote the soul is the center of the of the new birth the same code it's about God the soul is seeing that the soul is what God is working on see if you can only get a nature that Spirit to agree with him then the nature dies in other words the soul dies the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world which is the cosmos the things of the world and the love of God is not in you see and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end 45 so therefore I love this part so much yes that's the way the marriage part comes in all is about death they also die the old nature die the love of the world dies but now there's going to be a wedding ceremony now partnership between a man and a woman to marry so verse 45 said now therefore he has partnership you see and thinking this man Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together because he reflected himself back in that that he became a man when he became Christ Jesus he was God see God was in Christ that's he leaving him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that becomes the Perfection of him amen now through the new birth through their marriage with the King or your imperfection has been stripped away and it became the Perfection of God himself amen remember the The Prostitute at Jericho what is the name rehab rehab with all her imperfections when he was married to a general a captain in the army of Joshua all her prostitution all her imperfections we're done away with we're annihilated and discarded and then she was now partnership joined to a new husband who was of Israel now greater than Joshua is here when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ you're gonna go through a divorce Supernatural divorce not just divorce but consumption amen the fire of God who consumed the old man the old soul the old nature the love of the world all the cases in you and then in Christ Jesus will be married to your flesh and it's a man from above peace of Heaven why do we say holy ghost ghost means spirit holy means is a Holy Spirit holy Christ holy husband and holy husband should have a wife who is Holy and your imperfection he will strip your imperfection from you transform you completely and make you a brand new person how many new creation I'm a brand new man oh things they have passed away I've been born again more than a conqueror and that's who I am all things they have passed away I've been born again you'll be born again you are a new being you are a new creature the old things they have passed away you've been born again and that's your story you've been born again by Christ and if you've not been born again and you desire then young preachers the young sisters if you want to receive your experience right now God is here to give it to you and I want you to be on your heart that I need to be born again amen because without the new birth you might have all the talk but you can't walk the walk the new board is what will work that work for you a lot of people have certain ambitions ambition to serve the Lord and you can love the Lord in your flesh you can love in your spirit but if the old man is there he's going to love he doesn't know what he's talking about she doesn't know when the right time comes he's going to show his ugly head you rare his ugly head from behind and tell you to smoke tell you to go to the world go get a girlfriend why have you been in church you are 16 years and you are still a virgin people Mock You in high school you are 18 20 on your virgin you are 25 you're still a virgin are you crazy go enjoy yourself out there and they will sugarcoat it make it so tantalizing so beautiful and gorgeous and if you don't have something rooted here you think you are full you are a fool why people have got a girlfriend and you are still living with your parents come on go and chill out over there go and have fun his death what the devil cause fun is death God call it death God call his destruction but the devil will call it what fun and life but is what is death it's only hidden it's only sugar coated it's like sometimes when they give sugar coated medicine to children because children don't like the bitter and sour State sour taste so they are sugar a lot of sugar but the medicine is hiding on the inside and they don't taste in their mouth but when it drops into their system they begin to work sometimes you might not see what the devil is doing right now because you don't have that Supernatural eyes to see but when it gets you out there and destroy your life then you realize that you were dealing with a wolf sometimes you might have your boyfriend who is like oh this boyfriend is super when they get you pregnant and you tell your parents who got you pregnant Alex got me pregnant they call her legs his phone is blocked I don't even know you I'm not the one I only met you twice I wasn't the one and now you're going to have to carry a baby when you don't have a husband when you are just a teenager and you already plant yourself in defeat life is going to be a struggling for you but if you take your time you might be a fool to the world but be be a food to the world it doesn't matter but before the Lord you are the wisest woman on the planet you are the wisest young lady on the planet you are the wisest young man on the planet if you commit yourself and live a cheese life to Christ if you as a young man as a young lady make your own vow in your heart that I will not Define my body in the world but I'll leave unto Christ give me who he has for me in certain countries certain young people when they get to like age of 10 12. they make a vow in the church and and the pastors give them certificate that they're not going to defer them defile themselves with women or men drink until they marry but they don't need that certificate even if you we can make but Jack and make a big old certificate for you if you're still going to Define yourself you're gonna do it but you can make your own certificate in your heart that I put your name there I I but the Joseph would live for the Lord all my life I am Xavier all my life hi hi [Music] hello my life all right Hallelujah [Music] amen the Lord bless you and we're gonna be praying for them Glory Hallelujah because tomorrow is going to be their season and we need to we need to equip them what equipment the Holy Ghost baptism is what will equip you Sister Abigail and all of you uh she's watching me she knows it all of you I probably might come there I want all their young people let me read my last quotes the new bed let's go to the law schools and I'm done and all of us are going to make a proclamation unto the Lord and after we pray for you amen now the last word is the new birth is the Life of Christ in you the token that is still set up when a man marries you the man has to presented talking to you a wedding ring so that when the lady is walking she can swing her arms let alone that I'm married I'm married I'm married I'm married and misses are misses don't look at me I misses are married and married that's what they're waiting for the wedding ring is for is that right that's a token so that another man cannot eye you because you're already married and sisters when they marry first they like for everybody to know that they are married they have a way of swinging their arms which is their blessing they want you to know Oh Glory Hallelujah so that if they used to Walk This Way They swing your arm this way uh married uh Mrs Johnson Mrs Morales Mrs Troy brother Troy Bears Mrs Skippers you know that's what the LA the Lord does for us the natural types the spiritual and when you have the Holy Ghost baptism you have the token you walk about bravely and what proudly swinging not just your arms by your heart your body your spirit your soul that I am is Jesus Christ Satan you have no place in my life and whether to the Man Called Jesus Christ the creator of Heaven and Earth he's got all their blessings for me I'm not going to bow down to you I won't control to you I've got Christ on the inside my flesh is married to the holy man of God the holy spirit amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's just and now they took him 6509 or 01 M token 882 paragraph and now how could they be I like the way around paraphrases with a question how could they be a more perfect sacrifice than God himself becoming the atonement himself when God was made flesh in his own creative blood that only way that a life of God can come back 83 because all of us were born by sex and therefore the life that in there is of the world it's all the world is not talking about the moon and the star it's of Satan the cosmos the world order and that life will not stand is the LIE is the thing is the thing that is already judged and condemned you can't Patch It Up there's no way to patch it up there's no way to smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die that's the only requirement there is it's got to die they also the old nature of the spirit has to what die and Christ has World Born Into You and I want the young people to keep this verse in your notebooks that my old man my old woman in me has to die and the only one that can kill it is the Holy Ghost Christ himself and so your prayers should change Lord I need the Holy Ghost baptism Brother Joseph and all of you amen and all of us amen we need to we need to die that Christ can live on in US Glory he said there's only there's no way better he's got to die this that's the only requirement there is is God to die 84 and the substitute a life of Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's talking that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ amen that is what God is waiting on you will you accept this talking amen and I want all the young people amen I want every one of you to declare that you live for the Lord amen sister Linda hi all my life I am Sister Abigail all my life but by faith we cover all the young people even those who are not born those who are in the womb amen there's a supernatural God who does Supernatural things there's nothing that is difficult for the Lord and as young people I want you to keep this day in your heart this message was just for you it's a blessing to everybody else but it's just for you the young people that I begin to ask yourself am I Born Again sister happy girls traditionalinda you begin to ask yourself ask yourself what is the Holy Ghost baptism how can I be born again you begin to talk to your parents talk to your pastor there was a time that Mary and Joseph were with Jesus they went for a feast and when they were returning they were not they thought they assumed because they were people they used to go by carriage and horses and family clients walking around maybe hundreds of people so they assumed that the young Jesus was with them but they went I don't know how many my this journey and the three days they realized that where is Jesus Jesus where's Jesus he wasn't there and after what walk three days journey back to get Jesus and sometimes you can grow in the church going and coming even having positions in the church being a preacher doesn't make you a holy ghost for son I can preach and soul be damned I can preach and still be devoid of the Holy Ghost but you have to come to a realization that one day an old man can die old woman can die a child can die a movie it can die this life that you have just like the life of the avocado came from somewhere this physical avocado the leaf is a representation this avocado has got the green plant green leaf but one day is going to weather and die it might also die when it's Young and when you're done where are you going to what account are you going to give to the Lord everything that you did is going to be recorded when you get a certain age let's say like Alexander Brother Joseph God put a record on you if you're going to tell lies it's rather recorded it's on your conscience and when you die without the Holy Ghost God will show you that video clip that he gave you the chance to give your life to him he sent a preacher to preach to you he sends someone to pass a track to you he gave you a mother who is a Godly mother to teach you the word he gave you a Godly pastor he raised a church for you even the school room but you didn't pay attention but if you this day you can commit your heart to the Lord and as the Lord Lord I don't want to be on my own I don't want to be like the people outside there but I want to give all my heart to you what they see outside that doesn't apply to me gays and lesbianism and what have you that is not my story you made me a boy I'm a boy you made me a girl I'm a girl I'm not going to wake up to me and tell my friend that I'm going to be a girl when I'm a boy that is not what God made you to be but if you give your life to the Lord God will bless you let's go to the last slide amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord the
