Quentin and I went up to South Carolina we were able to tend actually both meetings we're going to brother Fred's on Thursday night and then we went to brother Simmons on Friday night and Saturday morning and it took us a lot longer because of accidents a man to get back home from yesterday but God is good we made it back they memorized Grace and one of the pastors called me this morning to say brother Jack that was real special what you did when I was coming up in fellowship and I wasn't scheduled to preach or anything I just wanted to go up and fellowship and then I just believe that uh you know they've just used that you know for his glory I was I was inspired but the Simmons got a new building a man is what they call it still building and I say oh look at this and I looked at that church I said that week in the week in the weekend we can work with this we can work with this you know so I I was just very very very grateful just just to be able to go when they meant a brother Solomon prayed for the Saints that are there and that'll be coming back we have a few things from our church and also sanctioned by the genius Church that are their distant joined themselves in the presence of the Lord and I'm so so grateful they man for that they would they would pull it on all of them brother Larry jr. made a comment and services that he say say I like to watch the YouTube videos above the church at sphere and truth said man you don't put us young you don't put us out there you see I like to watch the videos there saying this is just she's in the audience today and now she be singing on the videos sisters should reach we want her to come sing all right pull alone and broke you guys this is a reason sister Rachel last night I heard they got sister Tina and I said alright use you know but but it's good you know good just to see saints go and be a blessing to that area but we thank God it meant for all things did they have sister says my you're back with Miss top-secret empty we'd be looking for so so good to have her back a man in the presence of the Lord and and also just a kiss never a man she was in the hospital for a little bit and we went to pray for her and God raised up a broader at that Hospital Center even service a man on a day so god bless your sis praise the Lord we just we just thank God for that I also just want to take time to think that for all the brothers that went out on yesterday to hand out flyers and Okeechobee just to let them know that we would come in next week for our back to school amen outreach and what we you know I believe it was my wife that kind of gave me the idea may be doing the factor still outreach and then if I'm just kind of talking about Troy he gave me the idea you know let's also connect with that prayer for the kids as they going back into school you know and people need prayer our schools are dangerous right and so you know just be able to connect that and try to reach the people in community you know we were gonna go out next week or do that so 10 o'clock in the morning we'll do the outreach and then 6 o'clock in the evening we will be doing a man the service where the Remi will be preaching there we're looking forward to having a wonderful time they met in love or so just keep that in mind and keep it in prayer and then we trust it you'll be able to make over to the service I know to be a real blessing the brothers smiling just to see they meant our faces same and I know it'll be a blessing to him so I'll keep that in mind I wanted to also just take a moment here a man this is first Sunday so I always tried to give you all an update a man of our Building Fund and and I'll do that at this time thank you I'm using same and I'll let y'all be seated appreciate y'all certainly certainly appreciate y'all a man glory to God just this grateful for all that the Lord a man is doing in our myths and and in church I wanna I just I want to say thank you for everybody that is getting behind Amen the building fund to you know to just help us get to where we want to go as a church and and all I can access that we just do the best that we can right just do the best that we can we look and you know this is this is a recently we're at brother West Coast services and brother Daryl made a comment a man in that service and he was talking about Gideon's army and and and what happened with Gideon's army God had to actually stripped the army of their size they were about 30,000 men and even with 30,000 they were getting ready to go up against like hundreds of thousands and even with 30,000 they wouldn't have been big enough to defeat the other army and you know so God say but but just so that y'all don't think that y'all DD I'm actually strip the army down and and I think he got it from 30,000 to about 3,000 or something like that and and then they say not getting and I got one mold test thing they say I want you to have them go to the water and the ones that that kind of do it a certain way right the ones that get water a certain way I want you to put them to one side and then the the others that get it in another way the ones everything lay down on their face and drink the water you say that they prostrating before an idol God you say so put them to the side and then the ones that kind of they cut it you know like this you know they pick it up like that they just kind of get down on me and I don't need knees but just you know kind of like this and the reason they do it like that because they got their eye on the devil put them to the other side right and when you put them put them the ones that that was doing it like that you know like 300 of them he said that's the army that I won't pass them the ones that I want and and and God took the 30,000 member army down to 300 and and so when they went to battle they would have to know that they were not strong enough to defeat hundreds of thousands they would have to know that God did it they had to give glory to God so we're not when I apply that to our pledge and we gonna do what we can do it but but but you know when we kind of done all that we can we know who can do right but but we gotta at least do what we can and notice not in Gideon's battle they did have to show up right they at least had to be there right so there are things that we have to do we have to show up right but but you know we've set budgets we set all these things but we got a god that blows budgets a man and and our faith is gonna be on the line the greater than this so don't so I'm not I'm I mean I with all this to me is good news right oh this is good news but up but and on the other side of that I'm still expecting God to do some great things amen and I miss praise God but uh but I just you know and and I do want to thank everyone I have to say this because last month was our largest month and giving towards the building fund since we do [Applause] and that was a real blessing just last month along there was eight thousand five hundred and forty dollars given to us for building a man a man I'm grateful that that's that's a positive amen if y'all wanna beat last month be Mike but you know but we you know we don't do this with that cook you know Dennis washing the car right there's gonna be a god thing we just did what we could right but God did the rest amen but but uh you know we set a goal just based on our Amen voting and things that nature our goal was to raise a hundred and five thousand Amen this year and you know the the pledge is do I have that right yeah so and the pledges that were given we had little forms that people pledged on the sign on say that this is what I'll give the pledge forms came back at fifty thousand three hundred twenty five the goal was 105 but we got pledged half of that was pledged and and and so far to date we have received twenty three thousand six hundred and fifty six dollars a man enforced sin of what was pledge Amen so let's give God praise for that and we are here at August 1st I mean the first of all because I should say August 5th is a date but uh we're here the first at August and I mentioned to y'all early in a year we have one transfer a four hundred dollars that went from our building fund to our normal offering as an offering is what's used to handle all the expenses here in the church and one month we fell short so we had to transfer money from the building fund to that and that's something that is not good if we're trying to save the money for a greater project we can't be using the money while we're trying to save right so so that was just not good and and I have to thank the church once again because we have not had to do that again this year and even in the summer months when things get slower the church is still responding in a given and what we ask is that at 37 people would undertake $100 a month and giving towards the offering that's not tithing that's your offering offering the Bible says we give tithe again offering and tithing you get 10% of your income to the Lord and God said you can keep 90 percent and what a deal right give tips if the government take more in God all right but but 10% is what God actually for your time and then he says we give our tithes and offerings so offering is whatever a man you want to do from your heart there is no limit on that if you want to give the other night of a sip a man to God and offering he would have no problem he wouldn't know your your bills might have a problem we have but uh but uh but I tell you we just we just asked this sometimes people well how much do I give you know $1 $2 $3 whatever you want to give is from the from your heart that's what your give an offer but based on the expenses of the church you know just what we pay in rent this this this space cost us thirty seven hundred dollars a month so if 37 people gave $100 guess what it's paid for every month praise the Lord it's just that simple rather than having you know one person trying to do it all why don't we all try to pitch in a man so if you can give $100 towards offering that with that would be very very helpful so our net a man since we had that one transfer and even though we received twenty three thousand six hundred and fifty six dollars we have to take the four hundred dollars away because we used it so our net is twenty three thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars and four cent and and we've been we started giving in February so February March April May June July not even a year and we almost halfway there a mess so I want to say praise the Lord for that praise the Lord I was halfway there for the pledges for the pledges for the pledges so a man we're gonna do what we can and we'll let God do the rest so thank you all so much a man I'm so grateful a man for that so my God my God a man I think there was something else that I was supposed announce and when you don't write things down they have to come back later a man but but God is good oh oh yeah two other things I needed to just announce we we are growing as a church a man we're very happy for the growth a man our precious is the jalisa a man is joining us and she's gonna be baptized on tomorrow hey man [Applause] pray for her pray for her you know this any time we start doing what we what the Lord's call us to do that that will gonna be right there in fact you know so just continue to pray for her and also we want to thank the Lord for us sister Liz Sanjay a man she is joining us a man [Applause] [Music] just to talk with just everybody brother Jean and he was just saying well it's a good thing about is that you know even though we you know they don't know no church like to see anybody leave but Sicily has end up in a church and preaching the same thing not other Church of Christ right so that that's that's a blessing that's a blessing and we're just so happy to have a man with us a man here so continue to keep her in prayers well God is a good God and then God is a good guy amen so I want to read a couple scriptures I got a subject here a man that I feel I feel like I can't necessarily get it all out in one day but a man we're gonna do the very best we could and the way I'm built is like I like to try to build up to where we're going but today I might just drop a bomb and then we'll clean it up later if that'd be okay right just just just drop the bomb mess up everything and then they would go back and clean it up all right yeah I just I just I just love the Lord you know while we were there one of the brothers picked up we are at a ministers meeting on yesterday his brother picked up the scriptures they turn your Bible here and when it turned his Bible there I didn't catch it at first he start reading like oh that was a scripture and I want to refer to old Sunday so I'm like that's that's got to be a confirmation but I've tried to work work my way up to it but I'm like no I just drop the bomb and then I click there come back clean it all up a man but I just love the Lord so you all stand with me we're gonna read and we're I'm still kind of in this channel of talking about adoption a man so just bear with me here I've just been noticing that there's a lot of preachers out there that are preaching on this subject now brother Remy when he had his meetings the bet back in June before we went to Israel he wanted the subject of adoption preached in his church and then brother Wescoe when he had the theme manifestation of the sons of God that's also adoption and and I know that you know some other preachers that I know they're kind of talking on these on these lines so I said you know Lord maybe you're trying to say something to us and I want to just kind of get in that vein and and I've trusted you all I bear with me but the the one thing that I remember the Prophet telling us is that the reason a man that this you know this ain't really just kept I mean we really settled in this it's because we don't feed on it enough right so so we need that we need to feed on it we need to feed on it so y'all just bear with me as we as we go along I want to want to read from Romans 8 amen 14 through 19 and also Galatians 4 and then I have some other scriptures that I'd like to try to get to in the sermon if I can but we will we'll let the Lord have his wing a man Romans chapter 8 and this this this subject I know is not for babes in Christ it's not it's really for those that that are established in Christ and however a man we are believing that you will be established a man in Christ and you know we'll just do all we can to help you get there Romans 8 and I'm starting here at verse 14 it says for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear and and and the emphatic it says a slavish spirit you have not received a slavish spirit that mean you're not supposed to be a slave to sin you're supposed to have dominion over sin right this is this is what God wants to do we got to get rid of our excuses right it's no longer God understands God understands that you supposed to be above that right you have not received that didn't come from God you don't you don't have a slavish spirit to see him right so here so you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption or also it says in lymphatic GOG like the spirit of sonship right the spirit of sonship whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs than heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ okay if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together a man for I reckon that the sufferings so so this this adoption certainly a part a part of his Gumby character-building right and so so what happens in your suffering is that your character is being formed so don't run from your your suffering don't run from the trials you have to welcome that Amen because that's what's forming and shaping your character hallelujah a man a man a man now you know as a pastor I know that I got things that people are struggling with a man here that you probably should be struggling with you you should be so much further up the road that you that shouldn't be a problem amen it shouldn't be a problem as a pastor a man people that go to this church people that are members if I can put it that way members my expectation for the sisters that they not wearing pants your member spirit of true tabernacle and pants you mean I ain't them I ain't preached nuttin all these years right see so I mean you know the expectation and see I wouldn't have to preach that if we want to live in that right right I mean the church should be so much further the room right there are certain areas that you know I shouldn't even have to go into because I know that you two already overcome that a man Church right so the sufferings I recommend the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God all right turn with me to galatians 4 a man i want to read from there as well on today and will say we're to pray and i'll let you be seated lord help us God a man a man yes there this is this type of these types of sermons are for those that established in the faith and you know and and and I'm gonna preach us up there right to get us established in the faith but I know I know that we go through things I know that and that we read the something and Sunday school this morning now you know we sometimes dark have just attacked certain things right he cool it but some time he does wait he just sit back he wait and he just don't go after it right away he know it's there but it don't attack it brother branham told us that if we if we learn the fly those principles it would it would make our home life better and our church life better so sometimes we can attack but sometimes you got a week Amen just wait and and so you finally sometimes just waiting in a sermon like this I'm just waiting heavily no don't get me wrong now amen don't get me wrong amen but but I'm trying to bring the church to this level if I can get you there and you're thinking then all that other stuff a fall off amen amen I'm a yo-yo you know sisters brother branham had a vision and there was a lady that come to him with high-heeled shoes on and she was walking and he told her later his sister you not gonna make it to heaven like that he told her say you're not gonna make it to heaven and she just kept walking he said you're not gonna make it like that sis you're not gonna make it and she got so far down the road till she felt off right she fell off she didn't go up she fell off and so you know even in that y'all my wife I know my sister my wife has done teaching she might have to do it again on modesty but sisters we got the street those things up a man you know you know what's too high you're walking funny a man and the Bible say that they would do that now you know you can feel the word one way or the other but but you know I don't don't don't don't get me wrong I see all kind of stuff sometime I don't say nothing but don't think I don't see a man I be I'm trying to follow a certain vein and then I get pulled back down from another dimension alright Galatians 4 I'm done Simon I'm gonna keep elevating but imma just drop a little things off don't think I don't see it a man I see it unless I see makeup I see fingernail polish til I see all that praise God don't think I'm an agreement with that no I'm not no I'm not a man y'all know what holiness is if I have to see they used to preach it so hard we knew a holiness was a man but we we got we overcame some things right we overcame some things but y'all just bear with me y'all bear with me all right now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the of the world when we were children where we were under bondage under the elements of the world but see when we mature we're no longer under bondage to the elements of the world right this is this is this is maturity but this is why this is two people that's already overcome right if you want to keep struggling that's that's to you all right hey man but but but but but but we don't have to struggle anymore we don't have to be bound anymore amen be satisfied who God made you a man so he says but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons that's a critical statement there's a quote that I've been trying to get to the read and I won't get to it today I'll get to it eventually because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father now that's that's critical because the because you are sons we can have these conversations hallelujah right some churches you can't go and preach this subject but because you are sons and daughters of God we can talk about adoption Amen hallelujah wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ let's pray father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that the Holy Spirit would now take these things that we've read and bring clarity and understanding to us God touches that we might receive a from heaven today and Lord elevate us elevators and I thinking elevators and our living elevators God and our approach to you father we pray that you would do that today we take control under the control of the Holy Spirit every spirit that's against the Spirit of God we take it underneath the control all the spirit even right now in Jesus name we pray a man amen god bless you you can be seated amen I was struggling with my title here because I can say I try to deal things up to a certain point but amen we're not going to build up we're just gonna drop the bomb amen our title today is co-equal with Jesus a man co-equal with Jesus let's just kind of start here in this sermon what was the Holy Ghost given for a man what was the Holy Ghost given for now you know we're not when I use that title and I'll have a quote that kind of support where it where I'm coming from but we just read some scriptures one of the things a man you know that the Prophet just kind of shared and and and I'm not going to read all of it right now I'm just gonna set you up with this a man but he made up he made a statement he says it says they said the Pentecost has received the bachelors old egos and that makes them apart fellowship and relationship with God that's born again he says and a son and daughter of God tailed them out of the Bible and they'll believe it all right tell them out of the Bible and they'll believe it right so so when I talk about being co-equal with God once I tell you out of the Bible then you have to believe it if you're a son or daughter of God you got to come to this especially once it's shown to you your identification is found in the Word of God right so so once it's shown to you in the word what God has called you to then you have to believe it and not only do you have to believe it I believe you have to start expressing it Amen I I just I just believe that I was listening to her brother speak I believe it might have been this weekend he talked about how first it started out as a thought in God's mind amen and then that thought a man came down to become a word out of his mouth right but that but not only did it stop there amen it kept unfolding so we had a that became a word that became written and then we had the written word so we had a thought that we had the word now we got the written word but it don't stop there because the Bible said it was supposed to be living in Pistols read by all men so the thought got to come down from god it's got to become a word then it's recorded if it comes the written word but then when you hear it then you become the living words hallelujah and this is what God is trying to bring those two and then we're real leaving this thing every day Oh hallelujah glory to God under expectation for this you know your trials and in which we we hid that this morning persecution and trials are natural normal part of the Christian life a man perfect don't run from persecute don't get discouraged cuz you're going through right and then you oughta your honor you ought to begin to come if you're not going through like brother Quinton say you gotta get to begin the question what's wrong with me I ain't got no chops what I'm told is son Billy Paul you ought to be glad that there was chasing you because that means that you not in the devil's back pocket if he stop chasing you you know there's a problem right so one of the chasing you ought to be giving God glory for every trial for every temptation very distressed because persecution and trials are natural normal part of the Christian life Oh glory to God Amen I like that I like that let me go back to what was the Holy Ghost given forth notice the title what was the Holy Ghost given from that because most people think the Holy Ghost was given just to make them you know speak in tongues but no no it's more to it than that we going we're going well beyond just a tongue speaking and and and and I I even been praying I was praying this morning say Lord released every gift that you put in the Bible released that in the church releasing knowledge I called for knowledge I called for wisdom I called for tongues I called for interpretation of tongues amen I called for the gift of faith I called for the gift of working miracles amen hallelujah every gift that was written in first Corinthians 12 we call for those gifts to come forth in this church hallelujah amen but but but the good thing the other thing about about it is that we also want the life that goes with the gifts oh yeah not just people doing things with no life what we are because gifts come without repentance but we won't repentant people live in a life manifesting the gifts of God oh my god man I'm trying to try to get here this brother shared a testimony during yesterday that blessed me it was saying how the Lord used to deal with him and visions all the time and and why he was dealing with him in visions he said at one time was a young lady that come to church and she she came up for prayer because she wanted to receive the Holy Ghost well while she's coming up for prayer a vision goes forward and the man can see in the vision that this this this girl is having a conversation with a father and the father telling her I don't want you to wear a particular thing I don't want you to dress that way I don't want you to do this and so they had a nice argument about it and after the argument was done the girl snuck it into her suitcase and she came to the meeting and while she coming down to the altar she got the thing going that her daddy told her not to wear so the God God showed it to the preacher and the preacher say sister I would like to pray for you to get the Holy Ghost but I can't pray for you to get the Holy Ghost because you wearing what your daddy told you not to wear and he said she said nobody knew that but God said yeah you said well she said what do I need to do see say you need to go make it right hallelujah before you get in here to receive the Holy Ghost you need to go make it right and that just bless me because there's a lot of folk that need to go make some things right hallelujah amen there's a lot of stuff that we do and we never make the thing right and we and we want to just overlook it and expect God just the blessings that's gonna actually clog things hallelujah there's some there's some husbands that got apologized to their wives there's some wives they got apologized to their husbands there's some children it got apologized to their parents there's some parents that might have to apologize to their children right we got to make some things right get this thing clear so God can get glory in this place when he said that that gif don't work as much as it used to work that's you know and I know why he was saying it but but the Bible said that he these gifts God gives them to the church and and if it's in the Bible we're supposed to believe it all right let me go on let me go on so what was the Holy Ghost giving fun all right he says then when this boy got to a certain age say he was matured all right so he's going back to Galatians 4 were that's what he's really picking up here you know he the boys raised under tutors a man and they're constantly reporting to the Father there they were constantly reporting to the father had a ball was progressing how he was getting along you know they give the boy certain tests and he have to pass those tests and they could see whether it's boys really coming into his own and it's the same thing say the Holy Ghost is our tutor the Holy Ghost is who reports to the Father the things that we're doing right so so when the Holy Ghost is report and what type of things that he have to say about you a man does they have positive things to say about you it doesn't have negative things to say about you so so as becoming a man as we're going through our trials we'll go through our tests it's an opportunity for the Holy Ghost to see how we're going to respond amen we got to mature as brothers and sisters Amen in Christ listen says when this boy got to a certain age say he was matured if that boy was just a renegade no good didn't care for the father's business all he thought about was flirting and running with women a man if that's all the boy thought about was flirting and running with women drinking or gambling horse racing amen that boy would all days be a son but he was never placed in position to have other to have heir to all his father had hallelujah so if you're struggling in areas like that you already know that you're not gonna get this adoption that we're talking about right you've got to overcome something amen hallelujah amen and some of us we create our tribes the decisions that we make are the trials that we create come on somebody the dissent you got the live with your decision right Adam had to live with his decision glory to God and you don't have to live with your decision there I mean you created that based on the situation and then you tell God it's too hard no no no no I want too hard earlier and then when you were doing what you were doing it once you are there so you got to you got you gotta live with what you create and gotta give you grace to endure it ain't no shortcuts to God whatwhat is going on is that your your your characters being formed through the midst today I mean man I know I know I wouldn't have been able to handle what you're going through that's why I didn't make the decisions Oh hallelujah I didn't make those kind of decisions cuz I can't handle that but since you can God allow you to do that and now you got you got paid by the grace of God you'll make it you'll make it through all right amen don't give up on God cuz he he won't give up on you he's able all right come on so so look look he says I if he was a good boy and he was about to father's business and he proved to be the right child then they had a ceremony they took the boy out into the street put a white robe on him and they set him up Oh see I feel like singing again I'm gonna put on my robe tell the story how I made it old why say they put a white rope a man on him they set him up on a scaffold so all the city could see they made a feast and a jubilee and the father then had a ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business oh not answer that's another statement right there now does the son was born into the family nothing could stop that right I mean he was predestinated and he was born into that family nothing stopped that birth there but now through his maturity he's not just adopted a man into the family but he's adopted into the business oh yes amen are we about our father's business [Music] now sometimes we're certainly about our business that's why I was saying that last week see it's okay to have vision because without a vision that people will perish that's one thing they have a vision that's great I'm not speaking against that however there's a higher vision than your personal vision and that's why Paul said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision so doxygen puts you in the father's business all right and make sure about the father's business look at this he goes on to say this he says and then the Sun was co-equal with his father in other words if it than the day the sons name on the chick was just as good as the daddy's I like that now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go for 30 years tested him tried him then he give him three years of heart trial and maybe that's where we are right now three years of hard trial right three years of hard trial and then the end of the heart trial when he's seen that his son was about the father's business not Transfiguration Luke he took Peter James and John three witnesses and went up on top of the mountain and their God performed the laws of adoption they looked up they seen Jesus and his clothes shine as white as the light lightning and and as a cloud overshadowed him and a voice come out of the cloud and said this is my beloved son hear ye him I'll sit down now and have no more to say what he says is law in truth you know this is a pretty important statement because so here the Satan I mean God the God has actually shown them through Mount Transfiguration that he's adopted a son now don't don't get me wrong adoption and placing is not just casting out Devils we're doing that right a man is not just the healing of the see we're already doing those things that that's part of it yes but it just don't stop there I mean the character is involved here right are you really displaying the character of Christ you know when I was um you know after you go to Matthew 17 follow Jesus life at the Transfiguration he was actually prepared for crops but he had the humble himself to death has an adopted son you might have to humble yourself to some serious situations things that you can't change with your power things you can't change and you got to understand that you got to get to a place where you know what is the will of God and what you know maybe it may be Satan might be trying to tempt you to do something you should be doing hallelujah he did the same thing to Jesus when it came to him amen and Matthew for look for when he came to the Mount of temptation experienced Satan was trying to get him to do things that he was supposed to do and the devil is right now trying to get many of us to do things that were not supposed to do we got to yield ourselves to the process what does God trying to take us to remember you know we talked about them that the diamond the diamond is cut and see that when the Dharma's cut that is descent you know you got these four sea - diamond to cut the color the clarity the carats these are things you look for in a diamond but the most important thing in the diamond is to cut right and when the diamond is cut it goes through a man the cut happens with three things it's the brightness the fire and the scintillation right these screens are these three things I need it for the cut the brightness is the internal external reflection of white light from the diamond the fire is the scattering of white light into all the colors of the rainbow I like that then so when you're looking at the fire in the diamond and then you're looking to see if there are seven colors reflected because there are seven colors in the rainbow oh my god of the scintillation is the amount of sparkle of diamond produces and the pattern of light and dark areas caused by reflections within the diamond now now notice this now so these three factors in cutting the diamond the brightness the fire the scintillation those three factors of spread to the fire is supposed to produce seven colors hallelujah and this is what this is what I want you to get because your trial it's forming you and shaping you and molding you and making you reflect seven colors let me put it this way your tribes are forming and making you not just reflect seven colors but it's causing you to reflect seven virtues hallelujah so if you've been cut rights we ought to see faith we oughta see virtue we are see knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and steam it together by love that's what we're looking for amen we're talking about adopted sons this light thing twice hat has got to live and chop the body those seven colors these seven colors are actually b7 purchase that's reflected through the people hallelujah see I've talked to you this not just for you know babes God trying to bring us somewhere God trying to elevate us we're here to take take over the father's business what is his business what is his heavenly vision we gotta tap into that as sons and daughters of God can I go a little further all right now we were so you know this this statement oh yeah the statement that I just read here they're the Mount transfigurations experienced this is my beloved son hear ye him and it said brother Branham said God pretty much said I'll sit down now and have no more to say but what he says is law and truth now you know that happened with Moses you know that happen with Moses where God pretty much said Moses you bring the people to the mountain and and and and and as he put Moses on the journey he expected Moses to handle anything that came up anything and brother branham even tells us that God was going to sit down until he heard moses cry oh my god when God heard Moses cry Lord what shall I do right that's when God responds like what shall I do Moses speak to the people and move forward now if Moses was in a place at that time with God where God wanted to go sit down because he thought he had a I'm a to a son on the earth to handle things what do you think about us all the word that we have received right amen we should be coming to a place where God and I don't worry about certain things no more from us he can just give us the business and know that it's gonna be taken care of hallelujah a man church right so let me let me just count it let me let me take this a little further with you here a man own today oh my god my god I want dropped some things amen yeah let me let me just start with a little quote here out of it is the rising of the Sun now now stay with me amen as I as I read this stay with me it says I said let me straighten a little scripture here for you I think we're off of the phone and it says but but it says but we but we are still here st. John 5:24 jesus said he that hears my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life now look I'd go down the street and just take that literally what what it is without the spiritual understanding not making it say nothing else but just saying what it says see the right word here in the Greek it says in the original sense he that understandeth my words hallelujah go hurry up it says now to prove that's right I go down here and here's a drunk coming along the street and with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking God's name in vain and everything else like that say did you hear what the preacher said did you yeah I heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life just because he heard what the preacher said don't mean he got eternal life see it's not just he that hears my words but is he that understands so brother Brad was bringing some clarity around this right I'm in paragraph 161 he says I said did you yeah I heard it that don't mean it's got eternal are see he that understand with my word and look at this he that is an eagle he that understandeth my words but it's not just a ma'am I just he that heareth but he didn't understand of my word he that is an eagle I like that right now brother branham I want more scripture than that alright my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow since now this is the key statement as in the marriage and divorce case since the other day when the holy spirit had told me that I come said just the way he told me and when he talked about you know there was some some real critical things that he was giving to go through before he preached marriage and divorce he actually he had to wait on the Lord wait on the Lord brother Branham went up into the mountain and as he was up in the mountain praying you know over the over over the southern marriage and divorce people from all over the city saw the pillow fire going up and down the mountain up and down in the area where he was praying the area still there called finger Rock and they think if they saw the pillow fire going up and down the mountain up and down and one brother sitting there pumping gas he say brother Branham is over in that mountain right there so the brother branham comes out the mountain went down to the gas station get gas and and they say he looked at brother MC now brother Branham used over that mountain when you represent no no no no no when they say brother Branham I know you were you were over in that mountain because we saw the pillar of fire going up and down in the mountain so brother yeah I was there now there is a reason I want you to I want you to get this I want you to get this lord help us to bring this out I want you to get this this they say I've imagined before so before I preached there are certain things that he's standing at the end of the marriage of divorce he may have made some come and say the reason that many people are in the condition at the end right now is because they were not taught they weren't taught he said that's why they they end up in the conditions that they end now and because marriage and divorce thing nothing to play with right they say you say many of them are in the conditioning and because they were not taught and as he said he said you say you know he comes down out of that and he says now this is what the Lord told me he say this is for my group only right if you disagree with this that's fine but this is for my church this from my group and say he say you say he say go long stay as you are but teach children never to do anything like this so he gave that word and that gave him the authority has a son of God as an adopted place son of God to speak a word like that oh my god he say the same way Paul was given the authority and the same way Moses was given the authority God gave him the authority now there's something after he said these words there's something that was spoken and I want to read that this isn't this quote it's in some other areas too but look at this it says as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had told me that I come said it just the way he told me says some Minister lady gave me a right sharp little bawling out can you imagine this a woman preacher coming to the Prophet to straighten him up she wrong in the first place wrong double wrong says she said I guess look at her words I guess you take the place of God my brother ever said no ma'am I'm not trying to take the place of God and see when I give it a title like co-equal with Jesus I guess you're trying to take the place of God and I see we got to get this thing right in the middle of the road I told you just drop a bomb and then we'll fix it up later on right you say you say say up he said she said I guess you try to take the pledge guy I said no ma'am she said well you told them their sin is forgiven Oh God you told them you brother branham told the people that their sin was forgiven says you told them their sin is forgiven say it well said only God has power and wishes giver says only God has power to forgive sins right says see another brother brems I see another Pharisee see I say you see that you might know that Jesus told Peter and apostle's after he told him thou art Christ the Son of God he said bless top down see the son of Jonas flesh-and-blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven hath revealed it upon this rock I'll build my church the gates of Hell can't prevail against it and I give unto thee the keys wherever you burn oh my god whatever you bind on earth I'll bonded in heaven whatever you loose on earth so you trying to get the latest II God gave that authority to the church and with that type of authority it makes you co-equal this is why you need character right because with the power without character is satanic that's why we need the character of God this why we need to be cut this far beneath the reflection of those seven virtues in our life this is what we need this because this is elevating us to another place the the the power that's in your words your words can crush your words can bind your words can loose your words can deliver your words can do great things that's why you got to control your words hallelujah you know I find myself doing that sometime there's certain things you go through and you're like man nah I could say this and if I do say it I have to sit there and think if I see it what's the impact that has gotta have on the person will it crush you or will it help them so sometimes I just gotta fight my tongue can it go a little further look at this that's that divine revelation of the Word made flesh listen if it was blessed in the end that day by the Sun the groom is flesh today by the bride notice he didn't even put himself there it was if it was flesh that day by the Sun the groom is flesh today by the bride see whosoever says you were in it so then they are admitted who services you retain to them they are retained now the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest but that's carnal watch it was a spiritual reveal word that did it that's the reason he told them to be baptized in the name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost he knows they knew who he was can we just pick up a couple of scriptures here because this lady you know uses this statement you know you've taken the place of God only oh my god got a man the ability to forgive sins let's go to Luke five and five Oh Luke 5 starting at verse 17 here that's why brother Branham says see another Pharisee this woman preacher coming to him and making that statement this is another fare seat Oh God verse five actually starting at verse yeah verse 17 notice this and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that they were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them and the whole men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a posse so he's paralyzed right and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him now you know the reason they bringing this manatee is because they know if they could just get him into the presence of Jesus things was gonna change hallelujah right it says and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the munch - they went up on the housetop now now now I'm here in Luke 5 we're picking this stuff that they went up there but really brother Branham said what happened is that the paralyzed man suggested to his friends to take him up to the roof right take them up it says they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tilling with his couch into the myths before Jesus I did not skip I'm on first verse 19 is that right yeah verse 19 it says so they let him down on the couch into the mist before Jesus verse 26 and when he saw their faith he said unto Him man thy sins are forgiven thee notice this now notice it they've dropped this man he's paralyzed and and what they do is take the man up to the roof pull all the you know the the pilings off and everything and say just they just interrupted the service drop the man right down into Jesus presence and now they brought the man there for healing but Jesus says that stands not forgiven Oh hallelujah you know this is the thing we got to understand the dual atonement that came with Calvary right we get healing for our bodies we also get forgiveness for our sins and you realize the power and the forgiveness of sins is so great that it makes you a son and a daughter of God that there's nothing to get you when you've been washed in the blood hallelujah Church glory to God let me go on he says man my sins are forgiven thee now he was surrounded by Pharisees Sadducees I'm looking at what happened in verse 21 and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but God alone then look at a question who can forgive sins but God alone now Jesus understood his position Jesus understood his purpose Jesus understood who he was right so that's why he said rather than rather say man you're healed he say your sins are forgiven oh my god and see one day two churches don't recognize we have that same power oh yes we do as adopted son we who's ever since we remit they our men who substance we retain they are retained hallelujah hallelujah look at this let's go on first winter says but when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered saying unto them what reason ye in yourself and your hearts it says whether it's easy to say that sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that you may know they're not not Jesus but I don't already know who I am but that ye may know that ye may know that the Son of man have power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of palsy I say unto thee arise and take up that couch and go into that house look at this verse 25 and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God you know this this power that brother Brett that Jesus just demonstrated it was also shown in brother branham's ministry see the the village to who service stands you permit there a minute who's ever sins you retain their retain and see the whole the Spirit gave brother Bradley said I got a big test for you big trial what what is it and didn't tell him - that just got to test for you I got a test and it says you going around looking just couldn't find what the test was one day he had their preacher while he preaching this young couple on the front row just start making out on the front row no that wasn't appropriate for church but he said he say oh he said please stop deacons come back no please stop and the more they talk to him the worse they got they said please he's just preaching and and then you have to stop as preachers say please stop please you know sorry I'm listening to you they just got worse so then the Holy Spirit told them you see I I give them to you and whatever you say it'll be that way they're in your hands now and he looked and he knew that he could have said right there you filthy spirit from hell both y'all drop dead right now they would have dropped dead but instead of killing the people this is where character because he had the character of God he could actually say uh I forgive you and the Holy Spirit say those are the words that I was looking for notice God put him in a spot to see what he would do about it now he had the authority of the Son of God the white the people out but he said no I forgive you let me tell you something when you can practice forgiveness you set a prisoner free only to realize you were the prisoner when you practice forgiveness you set prisoners free only to realize that you are the one that's in the prison I'll either here let me go a little further see these Pharisees when they saw Jesus forgive this man sinned they knew that no this man only God could do this what Jesus said I am God in the flesh I am God in the flesh now I gotta bring this forward because you got to see that you're co-equal with Jesus amen when brother Branham took it upon himself to pronounce that and I'll even I'll even I'll even show I'll give you a quote on that when he pronounced in marriage and divorce you know tell them to go and sin no more let me just read two quotes on that if y'all don't mind first what I want to read is is actually out of marriage and divorce it's going to be paragraph three eleven and then I'm gonna read for who is this Melchizedek because that's the sermon that he preached right after marriage and divorce okay so let me just give you two to quote side of that denial I'll go a little further and we'll bring it to a close today a man your co-equal hallelujah so here in marriage and divorce he says and in first Corinthians the seventh chapter the 12th and 15th verse in the New Testament of the new testament prophet Paul who meant the same thing in the church and spoke this this is I not the Lord that's right says because of the divorce condition he says it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and God recognized that righteousness and Paul also had a right when he found his church in that condition now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the vindication of his clout and his message that's brought me this far should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more right go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you're married and God brought me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural relation of the opening of the seven seals and this is a question of God's Word let them go on in as they are and sin no more now you have to go listen to the whole sermon of marriage and divorce to understand the context of what he just said there but he made a comment after that statement was made in the following sermon and who is this Melchizedek it makes a comment about that statement that I just read he makes a comment so let's pull up who is monkey who is this Melchizedek and I want to read to you what he says there hallelujah it says this now I just want to comment just a moment on the mornings message there's no doubt I didn't get completely through with it but I think you understand and I'm sure I'm sure you didn't you'll never know what that was for me to do it says now it seems very simple to you so we said we've just got a quote quotes it seems very simple to you right here it says says says that's the first tip of you that you see what you're doing he says you are taking the place of God to pronounce something it's only brother Branham standing there to pronounce this what God gave him in the mountain he says I'm taking the place of God to pronounce it that's a powerful statement I'm taking the place of God this is this right you just you know with this type of power this type of authority you got to know what you're doing that's why you don't give a loaded gun to the little kids they would kill up everything and not even realize what they were doing right so so so you got it you got to understand this type of power has to come - sir - Matt or a man hallelujah I can tell you right now every trial that brother Brandon went through brought him to this place where he could do something like this and every child that you're going through is bringing you to the same place look at it now watch this he says you are taking the place of God to pronounce something and before I would do that it had to come an answer from God hallelujah don't just start speaking just to speak you got that you got that be in control these things that actually controlled by motive and objective it's got to be right all they got to be right when you talk about adoption listen oh boy - God he says and he says you're taking the place of God do something before I would do that it had to come an answer from God and he had to come down and he visibly showed himself and gave the revelation therefore see this is to the church and remember I said this what I said was to the church only and so that you might have confidence and know that was the same God that said to me up there where there was no squirrel speaking and stay there will be and three straight times that happened now if he can buy the same word create something that isn't there how much more will this hold fast at the day of judgment see people were there to see things and now as Paul said in days gone by there's man with him who felt the earth and didn't hear the voice but they seen the pillar of fire brother branham said when he was a dare announcing or pronouncing what God gave him permitting him to say of regarding marriage and divorce he said I was taking the place of God that's a powerful statement I was taking the place of God that lady coming accused him after he made this a you know so you must be taking the place of God you know this co-equal thing goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden because before sin came in Eve was co-equal with Adam they both had the same Authority they both had the same power in spirit form they were co-equal the fall did not happen until she came in the flesh but as spirit because Adam was both feminine and masculine spirit and in that form they were co-equal hallelujah and the Spirit of God is actually trying to bring us all back to this place where we realized brothers and sisters you are co-equal with Jesus your spirit is co-equal now your flesh still got to be subject to the laws of God you understand that right this don't mean that the lies now a man can take authority over the husband she still got to follow the Word of God but when it comes to sickness when it comes to disease when it comes to the devil that white is co-equal and has the same authority whatever she buys will be bound and whatever she loses would be loose man I'll tell you I'm thinking about I'm thinking about this brother I can't think of his name right now but I remember brother branham told him say your brother got these fits epileptic fits and and and and this man you know when he was pretty big guy by six foot four 277 pounds and every time you have a fit say everybody get out of its way everybody get out the house well one day you know brother branham say say your brother next time we have a fit like that he said jump on your brother take his shirt off throw it in the fire and say this I do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well the brother you know he got that he went home and told his wife I got the staff the Lord the Prophet told me that the next time my brother had a epilim epileptic fit take his shirt off throw it in the fire say this I do in the name of Lord Jesus Christ said he'll have no more fits after I do that she said she said okay all right well you know that brother brought winning got his brother say I want you to live with me they were waiting on him to have a fit well this brother got his brother living there but brother Brandon comes and him and the brother want to go hunting when he leaves the epileptic boy back with the wife and the kids huh and while they are huntin we got cell phones back then ain't no call and I said hey I need your home right now she heard what her husband tohe right and when she heard the testimony of what her husband told her soon as her brother-in-law had that epileptic fit rather than rising up and running she had thus saith the Lord she was a little lady about a hundred and twenty 130 pounds she saw him act up she went in jumped on top level took his shirt off this time to in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and her brother mo was he ever see see see did this brings us all everybody back to a place mama and sister is brought back to a place of Christ where we can put that devil on the run and stop running from the devil see there they're still there still you know don't get it twisted cuz after the fall God made the husband the head of the wife and anytime you see a man the wife leading the husband you see a problem because God never established that God can establish then when you see a wife leading a husband you see a problem amen a man tonight let me say it this way - if you ain't if you can't leave yourself as a man you don't need to be trying to leave no woman then let's just lay it out there right hey man you can't you can't leave yourself don't be tryin to leave no woman crazy God you can't expect her to subject us up to you all right Amen it's a number to truly try to do we try to use the word just for our googling the Bible say yeah the Bible also obscene all right amen you know if the wife supposed to be subject to the husband but also the husband who love his wife the way Christ loved the church all right the key to unlocking submission is love okay I'm going on but I'm trying to show that that that co-equal that co-equal place was there at beginning when they were both spirits they would they had that they had that co-equal so when Jesus went to the cross he's bringing this back to the church livvie co-equal but we have to go through the tutor and we got to go through the training we got to go through all of that before we could actually get to this place so don't run from the trial count it all joy God try to shape some things out of you and notice I say diamonds cut other garments can I put it this way I cut you you cut me because we have to cut each other alright but we were gonna be reflecting setting comes seven virtues through the cutting process alright thank you Jesus now god effect in his church the prophecy if I tell you out of the Bible you got to believe it so I'm gonna get it at least one scripture in here so you can believe it let me read this quote God perfectness Church they could look at what he says here oh my god since the Pentecostals has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that makes them a part of part that make them apart fellowship and relationship with God that's born again and a son and daughter of God tell them out of the Bible and they'll believe it now I'm going to stop that quote right there I'm coming back to it I'm going to tell you how to the Bible so you can believe it turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 Philippians chapter 2 okay now let's look at verse five in Philippians chapter 2 now I'm not reading all of this I'm just reading a couple statements because I think we need to levitate on that look at verse 5 let this mind be in you remember I said how Jesus went there amongst him them Pharisees and he said to the man that says be forgiving me and they criticized him and said wait a minute only God can forgive sins jesus knew who he was so there evidently his thinking was at a different level and our thinking as to get to this level because if they let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so the same mind that Jesus had we gonna have to have notice verse 6 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now you were made in His image - you were made in God's image right see what brother branham told say she wasn't gonna come down here and wouldn't got all clogged up with a bunch of stuff we don't realize who we are we were made in the image of God hallelujah and in Jesus recognizing who he was being in the form of God he would say he wasn't just a form of God he was God in the flesh but by understanding who he was that's why he could stand there say your sins be forgiven he knew who he was they said only God could forgive sins I am God that's why I'm forgiven sins hallelujah now let me tell you something you do not get to this place without coming through the blood of Jesus if you try to get that without the blood of Jesus you'll never get there because I know people out there preaching and that they're God's I'm not talk about that nonsense I'm talk about because you realized what the perfect work that the blood did for you it brings you back to this place the same place Adam fell from if you're being brought back to it who being in the form of God thought it not robbery it's not robbery to be equal with God it's not robbery now give me two more coats two more coats so yeah this gonna be a bomb just drop and then we'll clean it up later right wait wait what you saying brother Tech I'm saying Jesus didn't think it was robbery to be equal with God say we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ oh this is this is what God's trying to do a church let me go on i'ma read the finish reading this quote got the fakeness Church I told you he said if I tell him I would bother didn't they'll believe it so I know you believe it because I just told you out of the Bible he says but the thing of it is they forget who they are that's why we got to keep feet on it the thing of it is they forget who they are they think well I don't know oh brother you that's born-again our sons and daughter got cold equal with Jesus Christ that's what the Prophet says co-equal with Jesus Christ I'm a paragraph 819 is that right yeah okay Oh equal with Jesus Christ in his presence oh my that's what makes the devil angry might not understand what he just said you know when you leave here today the devil gonna be waiting on you he is angry that you heard this so he's gonna bring something out of somewhere to try to bring you right back down but you gotta remember you got the power to bind and loose so once you recognize that number the devil I've bound you Satan in the name of Jesus and I'm gonna tell you when you act that way like a son of God you take spirits underneath your control what you're trying to call me a devil no I say that I say I bind you Satan in the name of Jesus well you see as you say my man I ain't say that you saying that about yourself I bind you Satan when Jesus told Peter get thee behind me Satan he when he was just talking to the devil what I'm talking to Peter didn't say get thee behind me Peter I ain't call your name I'm talking to the devil now you're gonna claim to be Satan i'ma just keep fighting but don't let the devil use praise a lot that's the devil hallelujah hallelujah glory to God mine mine mine mine that was worth shouting oh right there well if you say that I say say that makes the devil angry is let the Church of God realize who they are oh you great living Church of the Living God you should you are claimed to have kissed the blessings off off of the rim of the cup sometimes I wonder if God could ever take his gospel and shake you to a place till you realize who you are and the rights that you have the god-given privileges look at this you know I heard one brother say the God doesn't sink I mean God I'm already put Satan and check me he ain't got no more moves well you got him in checkmate no more moves game over you sit there well you you ain't got no more moose a man a man you know you know some people you've played in certain games like checkers or something like that and you know you're just jumping got your king just saw you got the mason-dixon line control they can't come across nothing but when they see them they in trouble like that what they do is they take the game in throw it up in the air like this and you know you don't want to give me the joy with a beaten yeah hallelujah the devil came through the game I will put them all right back in place we got your signal we got you got you right where we wanted you amen game is over glory to God hey man listen he says oh you great oh you're great Church the Living God you have claimed to have Kista the blessings off the rim of the cup sometimes I wonder if God could ever take his gospel shake you to a place to you realize who you are them the rights that you have the god-given privileges Satan don't have one right of nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had at Calvary when Jesus Christ taking the sinners place and died at Calvary Satan has no legal right over over rights over nothing no more hallelujah but everything lays in the hands of the church and the believer that's it that's it Satan lost and then he's nothing but a bluff even death itself which we was taught last night the bee when it loses its stinger it is still a bee but it ain't got no sting he's still a devil but he ain't got no victory honey he is defeated Church just making a lot of noise we dealing with a defeated enemy hallelujah hallelujah he says he says and death has no sting to the believer his fingers go deaf singing around say well as this is the Enduro I can point the carriage to a resurrection hallelujah I'm grateful for this i I just you know brother branham said it right there that born-again sons and daughters of God are co-equal with Jesus Christ let me finish with this last quote out of the word became flesh a man don't think it robbery don't think it robbery God is trying to elevate our thinking you know and and you know how how hard it is to kind of preach something like this when you have to preach over the top of a lot of other stuff but but the reason I have to preach over top because I'm trying to elevate you this is this is something coming down from another dimension to pull you up because when you leave here is Gumby stuff coming from the underworld your Facebook your Instagram uh-huh and you know our Instagram with it when I first got it you know you just follow whoever you want to follow if you like what is posting you can stop following me man sometimes they might actually why you can follow me no more cause of what you posted it's simple what you post in I don't that's on the world stuff underworld here would have a underworld stuff underworld now read between the lines hey man that's that's underworld stuff that you posted hey man true thing at high I don't want to certain things my eyes don't need to see you know you know even joke made a statement he said I made a covenant with my eyes that I would not look upon a mate that's the Bible don't say I refuse to look at a woman right that's what he said right so so you know you thought not now if I ever since I refused that I'm not looking at pornography I don't go to port port photographic sites I don't I don't go to the to the store to buy something for the pornographic I refuse to look at it I made a covenant with my eyes a long time ago I'm not looking at that but what the devil are do is let somebody that's right amongst you get anointed by spirit and not a post and stuff from the underworld you know you post in bikini that's you and your underwear there and the passes PO pastor ya sabes everybody say PO passed and some people I just had to stop following I'm like oh god you know and if somebody got curse words I don't I don't speak that language wait I mean I read so did you see a curse word you ought to just stop reading amen if you want you to move in your house and they got cursing they got sex scenes they got will name some of the other stuff that's just ungodly stuff as soon as you see something like that you ought to shut that move you ought to have something in you that's a note I can't watch this and you know what you'll say to yourself eventually I can't watch nothing that's good we want to know why you can't watch nothing the Bible said tales tell us why anybody no description all the tables that's what I'm saying every table you sit at no matter what table you go to all the tables are full of vomit I don't know how many people will want to sit at the table that's somebody that's just vomited at oh let's just see right let's get a meal none of y'all like that you run out the restaurant but you let the devil keep shoving this stuff from the underworld all when you leave here is something in the underworld pulling you down but I'm coming here trying to pull you up cuz God don't want to living like that hey man all right I hope you can see that I gave you something to pull you up I got to talk about where you're at because you got out like brother Troy shoulders you got gates that need to be closed off amen so let me read this and I'm trying to get out leave leave leave this today when word became flesh look at this when Jesus no wonder when he came off to heal that night looked around that tree for food there was no food on the tree and he said no man Edythe from thee and he went on away in the next day coming back the tree up with her God's mind and that see this if we talk about let this mind be in you that was also in Christ okay God's mind the mind that in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing that word back again see as every word in the Bible is God's thoughts later see form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same up that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass amen see what I mean how powerful could that church could the church be the Bible says let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God and the creation created the world by his first then spoken and the thought expressed became material see what I mean says now if that same spirit I said let there be light and there was light and said let there be trees and there was trees if that same mind that was in Christ being you how much could have stayed let there be no cancer and it would be gone now who would be speaking that it would be God and you speaking it let there be no no more cancer all right let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see it's your thought jesus said verily he said that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily i said if you shall say to this mountain be luke plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you'll have whatever things down say us is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church I'm going on says now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in Word form that word takes our whole and becomes material and church this what I'm looking for the word whole and become material that means God knocking up what you sing amen the word takes hope becomes material I thought expressed oh how God could see if your heart and your mind is so and in filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become its thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place for a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being no matter what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be what kind of people would it be this morning if this brand of tabernacle Emme say if this spirit and truth tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why why when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't it didn't even have no alternative of your own but just to be led by the spirit and they that are the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God then when the human element goes out the Spirit of God feels that vacancy oh that's what we need the human element goes out the Spirit of God fills that vacancy when you enter yourself a man then will be when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps now how are we gonna get there we gotta empty ourselves say brother brother Troy made a statement it says you know when they were all when they were in the upper room the Bible said when they were in upper room they were all in one mind in one Accord in one place one mind one Accord say now being in the upper room actually they were in one place but why would the scriptures say that they were in one place if they were in the upper room is it because the it wasn't just where they were sitting see right now we're in one place we're in spirit and truth tabernacle but some of us our minds are all over the place but when we get into that heavenly atmosphere that room every about to get their church we don't see some great things in this place praying will be different fasting will be different living will be different if we can get everybody to that place I mean if we just if we just some somehow just everybody just took a Saturday and just ain't doing nothing but getting in the word I'm not I'm not I'm not if I got to do it if you got to go to work with understand that but if you can get to a place like you know I ain't gonna do nothing they for just stay in the word i'ma listen to tapes i'ma read my Bible right I'm gonna just stand the word and I'm gonna just get my mind in a place where I can get ready to receive from God the service would be different the service would be if people came to church with that type of approach I guarantee the service would go different hey man hallelujah Church it's hard to get him one of mine it's hard to get him one of court one place that's what it took them 10 days to empty themselves out ten whole days to get empty for us it might take a lot longer but if we get sincere about this thing church I talked about we going to another level God is trying to raise us up overcome the things of the world right we don't that we don't need to no longer be subject to the things of this world we we I mean that damn number the devil trying to pull us down we already we don't come down to fun I come from God down through them channels to get down to this earth this realm right to be tempted and tested that's what I'm here for right but what the devil trying to do is pull me down further and I'm telling the devil no I ain't going there I'm going back where I come from I come from God I'm going back to God amen and if I'm gonna go down I gotta fight to get there let me finish this it tells us this when you empty yourself then we'll we then will be when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus well the steps in his power and his thoughts and his being and is moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become worse and words will become material that's when the church in its power I believe it's on it's on it's on its Road and when the church would be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind's soul away from themselves that they don't see themselves they don't have a man no thoughts but to serve God I love that you don't have any other thoughts but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they refuse it not not the pastor just tell them he's got to stop this you guys when you get to the spot where you are refusing it you know you have made some progress they refuse you turn off your TV right you you you you you shut down that Facebook page you shut down that you know Instagram what you do it on your own they refuse you know Moses had to come to that Moses refused to be called one of the children of Israel Egypt he refused to be identified with them he want to be he want to be identified with the mud daubers he came to that on his own and God used them they refused the things of the world they just move in the spirit living the spirit moving the spirit walking the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church would go forth with power and dignity because deity will be revealed in human beings and I'm so glad that I can sing I'm one of them deity will be revealed to human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind co-equal with Jesus that's who you are I believe it I believe it let's pray Lord Jesus your word is true your word is real your word is all that we have God stains that the Prophet preached back in the 50s and 60s and Lord it was maybe it was so rich that people had no idea what he was saying and it's taken us roughly 50 60 years to even catch up with what he was saying our minds trying to grasp this trying to understand this trying to wrap itself around this it's taking us quite some time he told us that a eagle can go a long time in the chicken coop not recognizing that it's an eagle but this revelation god that's being brought this this the subject of adoption is coming from so many different angles Lord it's you you said today that it's it's to the Eagles the sheep will hear the voice is this is to the Eagles they would catch this and Lord as they catch it they begin to manifest it help us Lord to to have our conversation around these things around these topics Lord that that as we talk about it you would draw nigh let's draw closer to us father we need you we need you now more than ever before we're living amen at a time and we're gonna need the power of God and in a way that we've never have seen it before and these things that we're reading here these seas that we're storing in this church this is what we're expecting God give the people power to overcome the devil all of us are fighting something but give us power to overcome the enemy in our lives that we might not continue to make the same mistakes over and over and over again but give us revelation father we can do things because pastors that do it or because daddy said do it or mama said do it but God if that thing is not a revelation on the inside of us then as soon as we get out of their presence we're gonna go right back to doing what we wanted to do but God I pray to do it strip us of ourselves that you O God would help us to realize how much we need you and that we would find life so satisfying because we're serving you God let that be our testimony you do the things in our heart that only you can do we we lay ourselves before you our hearts are open before you that you got ways show us those areas God that we need to we need to work on we need a character Christ formed in us every test every trial God is chipping and knocking and a man and doing everything in order to bring forth of seven colors the seven virtues that's what you want to reflect in US and through us so we you we yield we yield it's in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus that we pray amen amen praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise amen you all stand to your feet and the singer your course of the diss song amen I want to give my best to you amen brother solemn would you come and just lead us in that amen [Music] to see the murder now I wanna live a life that's real I wanna save all this and man I give you [Music] I give my best I wanna do what you asked me to [Music] [Applause] I would just regular to me for you and more I give you my Oh [Music] I give you more Oh you're deserving you're deserving [Music] you're deserving of more goodies I you're deserving the more you're deserting the more I [Music] my turn you're deserving of more you're deserving of more you deserving the more you deserve in the more you're deserving of more goodies are you deserving the more goodies having the

to spend more I [Music] I give you more [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know there there are many things that brother Jack says it seems to come back to you at the right time you know he he made a statement I guess a few weeks ago maybe even last week yes she was that when people bump into us he bump into the attorney and that's true there were two different things that that happened the day my uncle my uncle passed on my way there I contacted brother Jack I actually text him he called me back in then I sent a message to the brother's name they began to pray and as I was going over there you know after the the meetings that were going through and after that a different preaching that brother Jack has been doing about the manifestation of the sons of God I went over to I was ready to see some things changed I went over there to see my uncle either raised up while I was gonna stand there - I saw the Lord take him away so when I walked into the house you know they had to solve gospel music playing and my family they were sitting out out front and in the room was my my uncle and his wife so I went over to him she gave me a hug I went on I tore my hands on his shoulder and he's lying and I'm looking at him in his eyes rolled back in the back of his head and he's trying to catch his breath that's what he's doing so I put my hands on his shoulder and I begin to pray for them and I knew as a son God God heard my prayers I said Lord my main thing in my main concern for being here I said my uncle comes goes to meet you with one Centon I want nothing between you and him but the blood of Jesus Christ so I'm asking that you forgive them of the sins I began to pray for man I didn't think about what happened to I told my wife so I was praying for the salvation everything he's a Christian everything so I just wanted everything clean while he crossed that River so after that I began to pray for us here and I had my hands on his shoulder I said Lord now I want you to touch his body he did like that so in my mind I was like man why did he do that and I just kept on praying so I told my wife about it and she said do you think he recognized you as a son God knew if you ask God that God would heal me he didn't want to come back I never thought about that then another instance came to my mind a little later and the day when my aunt and her husband came in the room and their daughter and they was standing by the bed I backed up so that they could say goodbye and his wife was standing by them then my aunt she's a woman preacher then my uncle and then so my aunt she began to pray for him and everything and she prayed the Spirit of God is encamped about those that fear so when she finished his wife said Jessie if you see a angel this room because the angels of God are care about those that fear you let us know will you let us know and as he was standing with eyes laying like this rolled back in the back [Music] he fixed his eyes on me and I said Lord he did recognize something he knew that you learned this room and brother branham said when they get ready to cross over they break into the other dimension they see those things and he could recognize the Son of God for standing there so we we have come to a place but we all must recognize that we are sons and daughters of God and when we ask things change things changed they have to because God called us to that position he wants to step back and see his children go for it me being that every every father wants to see his son grow up and be a strong man you want to step back that's my son that's my daughter that's what God wants to see go ahead and pray well dismiss Heavenly Father How Great Thou art father we thank you so much Lord God for what we've been hearing Lord father and we know that it's timely because the coming of the Lord is at hand father we see the world in the position as it was in the days of sorrow but before that time comes Lord that you ought to destroy this world your sons and daughters must all be manifested here upon the earth my father you have bring in messages over and over and over again to wake us up to get us out of that spiritual amnesia that we might recognize who we are knowing you didn't fellows today you once again have come to speak to our hearts wake up it's time for you to recognize who you are it's time for you to take your god-given privileges move for Satan's not your mask he's under your control he belongs under our feet and father we come to that place Lord he can't run our lives our lives a committed to you we are sons and daughters of the king we are royalty Lord you don't go into a royal family and tell them what to do father we commit ourselves to you we commit our minds our hearts our very lives to you use us orgone me that your will may be perfected in us have your way Lord as we prepare to leave this place I ask that you go before us make our way prosperous for the king of the kingdom of God's sake but all Lord God that we come in contact with may they see Jesus may we shine forth that light or that you have placed one there with any job Lord we ask told God that you be without pasture continue to help him and strengthen him Lord god bless your people as we leave this place this in Jesus Christ precious and Holy Name we pray god bless you my brothers and sisters you may have your seat brothers be horrified [Music] my Oh Lord me today my people [Music] if I Hey my people two days yeah you're [Music] peopie [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
