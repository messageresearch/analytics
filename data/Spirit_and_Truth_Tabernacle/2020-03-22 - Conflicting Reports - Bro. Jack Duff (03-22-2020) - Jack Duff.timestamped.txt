[31:03] by amen the recommendations that have
[31:07] been given to us by the CDC just want to
[31:09] encourage you that you do have the

[31:15] church app on your telephone there is a
[31:19] gift button inside the church app which
[31:21] allows you to give online it's done
[31:24] through PayPal so you need to have a
[31:26] PayPal account and the other thing I

[31:30] using PayPal make sure that you send to
[31:35] a friend I have the the email address of
[31:39] pastor at John 4:23

[31:48] quick but uh the the main thing is just
[31:51] make sure you do give send to a friend
[31:55] because if you don't use that particular
[31:56] option
[31:58] then it will paypal will take fees out
[32:01] of it then a man when you're given to
[32:03] the Lord we don't need to give it to
[32:04] PayPal let's give it to the Lord so make
[32:07] sure you choose the option of give to a
[32:09] friend the email address that it's going
[32:11] to go to is pastor and John 4 2 3 . o RG

[32:20] I'm sorry in the church app there is a
[32:22] give option if you are on the church
[32:24] website you have to use the whole button
[32:28] and and then there's a donation there
[32:31] just click on the home button and then
[32:35] donation and you'll be able to see a man
[32:38] wearing again is the first first option
[32:41] there the first item on the menu also
[32:43] there is a banner that passes across
[32:47] from the main page just like six or
[32:49] seven pictures out of shelf and one of
[32:52] the pictures will say something that has
[32:54] a description of Luke 6 giving it shall
[32:57] be given unto you good measure pressed
[32:58] down and shaken together if you click on
[33:00] that that will also take you to the page
[33:02] where you can give a man on the church
[33:05] website so either through the app or you
[33:08] can give a man online at the church
[33:10] website spirit and truth tabernacle org
[33:14] that is a church website WWE and truth
[33:17] Tabernacle dot o-r-g amen god bless you
[33:22] while we are preparing a man for the
[33:27] offering and we'll pray over it shortly
[33:28] this world to give you a couple
[33:30] announcements here we won't be having
[33:33] pinnacle palm service we usually go
[33:36] there do our outreach service but there
[33:39] the the population they
[33:41] residents it may be a little older and
[33:43] which they are in the high-risk category
[33:45] so we don't want to a man be accused of
[33:49] bringing anything on site and creating a
[33:51] problem for some of the residents so we
[33:53] decided to just suspend a man our
[33:58] Pelican palm time and until further
[34:01] notice so just keep that in mind so we
[34:03] won't have it today and we won't be
[34:06] doing that until further notice got away
[34:07] to something sound down a man and also
[34:11] for our Wednesday night service we'll be
[34:14] doing that virtual like like we're doing
[34:16] right now we'll be doing that virtual
[34:18] Wednesday night 7:30 p.m. we'll continue
[34:21] our teaching a man and in the book of
[34:24] Hebrews chapter 13 so you'll be able to
[34:26] get online through periscope and if you
[34:29] have an issue with periscope something's
[34:30] going wrong there please just contact us
[34:32] let us know and we'll do all we can just
[34:34] probably help you get on and then also
[34:37] our Friday night services amen they will
[34:40] be canceled and or suspended until
[34:42] further notice we will watch things
[34:45] settle down we'll get back on our
[34:46] regular schedule
[34:48] now we are certainly trying to adhere to
[34:50] the recommendations that's been given to
[34:52] us by the government and CDC a man so
[34:56] just keep those things in mind and we
[34:59] trust that the Lord will just bring us
[35:00] through I know he will I know he will
[35:03] they told us that this was supposed to
[35:05] last roughly 15 days and and that start
[35:08] an account from last Monday I believe
[35:10] that's when the president mentioned it
[35:11] so it might be this Sunday next Sunday
[35:14] that we'll have to do this but we're
[35:16] trusting that the Lord will just
[35:17] Unleashed and open up a man opportunity
[35:22] for us to come back together again
[35:24] fear is driving a lot of the decisions
[35:26] amen and we just only continue to buy
[35:29] them the spirit of fear that God would
[35:31] just give people peace you know time
[35:33] like this and the only way to got a
[35:34] final peace because they must find Jesus
[35:36] Christ a man named US v Jesus Christ
[35:39] because he is our peace amen so let's
[35:42] pray over this time of giving amen and
[35:46] we'll just admit these things to the
[35:48] Lord father we just thank you for the
[35:53] ability that you've given us to be able
[35:56] to stream the the service today and Lord
[35:59] the states that would use the various
[36:02] forms of technology to
[36:05] bringing their tithes and offering to
[36:08] the house of God we pray Lord that you
[36:11] have blessed them as they give thank you
[36:14] Lord for meeting every need of this
[36:17] church thank you for meeting the needs
[36:19] of your people and God we realize that
[36:22] there are some that may be impacted they
[36:26] may not be able to work because of some
[36:29] of the decisions that have to be made
[36:31] God we're claiming that you are a wave
[36:33] maker that you are a miracle worker and
[36:37] you're lying in the darkness and God
[36:39] somehow someway you will make a way for
[36:42] your people so I pray that you would

[41:54] the video he's awesome at how these
[41:58] Howard almonds sour got blessed be the
[42:03] name of the Lord amen so if we can let's
[42:07] just get our Bibles I want to turn and
[42:11] read up a couple scriptures Amen for
[42:13] today and my heart comes to you a man
[42:19] with a number of things a man that I
[42:24] want to share and I know I won't have
[42:26] the opportunity to share at all so we
[42:29] will a man just get started where we are
[42:32] and just trust that the Lord will they
[42:35] meant direct us even on today we
[42:37] certainly want to do anything we can to
[42:40] encourage the believers and in a time
[42:44] like this we need encouragement but we
[42:47] also need to keep our eyes on Jesus amen
[42:50] there's a lot happening and it's
[42:52] happening so fast
[42:54] we want to keep our eyes on the Lord
[42:56] Jesus as you can see we're streaming the
[42:59] service day and we had plans to have a
[43:02] dual service today but as the
[43:05] information just kind of kept coming we
[43:07] had to make adjustments based on what
[43:10] was given to us and and you know we're
[43:14] trusting that we're doing the right
[43:16] thing by doing it this way and but we're
[43:20] believing that we will come out of this
[43:22] a man I believe that the scripture tells
[43:26] us to forsake not the assembling of
[43:28] ourselves together a man and I don't
[43:31] believe he was talking about online a
[43:33] man I believe he want us to come
[43:35] together half Church praise the Lord a
[43:38] man I believe that's his will and he
[43:40] said we should do that as we see the day
[43:42] drawing closer to Cole's we see Jesus is
[43:45] coming soon we need to be in church or
[43:48] not less a man so we're doing this and
[43:52] honor of the what they were they're
[43:55] recommending and requesting of us but uh
[43:58] Hart is that we'll be able to come
[44:00] together amen in person
[44:02] much sooner than later amen but let's
[44:05] just read a couple scriptures on today
[44:07] Ezekiel chapter 9 amen we want to read
[44:11] from and then also pull from Ephesians
[44:15] 4:30 praise the Lord and man Ezekiel 9
[44:20] makes this music you writes it says he
[44:24] cried also in mine ears with a loud
[44:29] voice and caused them that have charged
[44:31] over the city to draw near even every
[44:36] man with his destroying weapon in his
[44:39] hand and the whole six men came from the
[44:43] way of the higher gate which live toward
[44:47] the north and every man a slaughter
[44:50] weapon in his hand and one man among
[44:53] them was clothed with linen o blessed be
[44:57] the name of the Lord
[45:00] clothed with linen with a writer's
[45:06] inkhorn by his side and they went in and
[45:09] stood beside the brazen altar and the
[45:13] the glory of the Lord the glory of the
[45:17] God of Israel was going up from the
[45:18] cherub whereupon he was to the threshold
[45:23] of the house and he called to the man
[45:25] clothed with linen which had their
[45:27] writers in corn by his side and the Lord
[45:31] said unto him go through the midst of
[45:33] the city through the midst of Jerusalem
[45:36] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[45:40] men that sigh and that cry for all the
[45:42] abominations that be done in the midst
[45:45] thereof and to the others he said in my
[45:48] hearing go he after him through the city
[45:50] and smite let much I spare neither have
[45:55] he
[45:55] pity Amen so when judgment was striking
[45:59] there was no pity and we want to
[46:02] consider God a man as a God of love a
[46:07] man and a God that would never do us any
[46:12] harm and you know and that's I mean
[46:15] that's a beautiful picture but he is a
[46:17] God of judgment as well
[46:19] and I can tell you right now sometimes
[46:22] it's not even God himself doing the
[46:24] judgment himself but man brings the
[46:27] judgment upon himself right the things
[46:30] that man does it brings his own judgment
[46:33] upon him a man hallelujah and we can't
[46:37] be a nation or people that only want to
[46:41] invoke God when we are in trouble right
[46:44] a man God don't want that type of a
[46:46] relationship even a man we don't want
[46:49] that type of relationship with people we
[46:51] don't want people invoking us when
[46:53] they're in trouble
[46:54] amen a true relationship is when there
[46:56] is no trouble we still have in
[46:57] conversation and God wants that type of
[47:00] relationship with his people amen so
[47:02] here verse verse 5 into the others he
[47:05] said in mind here and going after him
[47:07] through the city and smite let not here
[47:09] I spare neither have ye pity slay
[47:13] utterly old and young both maids and
[47:16] little children and women but come not
[47:18] near any man upon the moon is the mark
[47:22] and began at my sanctuary
[47:26] then they begin at the ancient then
[47:29] action man which were before the house a
[47:32] man and he said unto and he said unto
[47:36] them the foul defile the house and fill
[47:40] the courts with the slain going forth
[47:42] and they went forth and slew in the city
[47:45] a man let's also just turn to Ephesians
[47:49] 4
[47:57] praise the Lord Ephesians 4 and 30 and
[48:00] just to just try to share a little
[48:04] something from our heart with you today
[48:06] a man Ephesians 4:30
[48:11] it just says this in grieve not the Holy
[48:14] Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
[48:17] the day of redemption
[48:20] amen grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[48:22] whereby you're still unto the day of
[48:24] redemption let's pray over the word
[48:26] father we thank you for the privilege
[48:30] that we can read the word of God it
[48:35] takes the Holy Spirit to help us
[48:37] understand what we've ran things are
[48:41] written in prophecy in in a simple form
[48:44] and God Lord how we need to understand
[48:48] prophecy in this hour so we pray Lord
[48:52] that you would just break open hearts
[48:54] Lord just some things that you will want
[48:56] us to know as we just share amen today
[49:00] with your believers bless your people
[49:03] right whether you are in Jesus name we
[49:04] pray amen amen
[49:07] all right you can be seated and man just
[49:11] a little we want to just talk on the
[49:14] subject of conflicting reports in man
[49:17] conflicting reports and I'm going to get
[49:22] started
[49:23] a man in this particular thought and I
[49:27] know that I won't get to where I really
[49:30] want to go today but we'll go as far as
[49:33] we can a man and we'll go from there
[49:43] in the wake of copán 19 and all the
[49:46] changes I want to first say that this is
[49:48] his story
[49:50] Amen what we were going through even the
[49:53] way that we're doing services and this
[49:54] is his story I'm glad that we have the
[49:57] ability to be able to see it online it's
[49:59] also recorded there might come a day
[50:01] maybe 25 years now of 30 years not in
[50:05] the Lord the latest coming that people
[50:08] go back and be able to look at these
[50:09] videos and say well how did y'all make
[50:11] it through that it took God amen that
[50:14] bring us through that in a you know we
[50:15] we come to a spot where we were we were
[50:19] told that we couldn't go into church or
[50:22] any gathering they didn't use the word
[50:24] church but they say any other gatherings
[50:26] a man who we knew that that that meant
[50:28] Church right but uh but you know we have
[50:31] these things that they didn't want I
[50:33] mean another started that 250 was 250 we
[50:37] didn't want you to gather didn't drop
[50:38] down to a hundred and some sticks and
[50:40] and then before you know it was down to
[50:42] 50 then the president came out and said
[50:44] 10 amen and when it's that 10 that
[50:46] included every church right because most
[50:49] churches gonna at least have 10 people
[50:51] in it oh my my my
[50:54] now I didn't catch this until I stood in
[50:57] the pulpit a man but you know even
[51:01] Abraham asked that if there be 10 we do
[51:07] not destroy if there were teen
[51:10] hallelujah can God find ten righteous
[51:13] people in this hour Amen that were put
[51:17] to a stop destruction from hitting this
[51:19] earth and I believe God got at least a
[51:22] letti just fine oh I'm so glad I can see
[51:26] them one of them glory to God hallelujah
[51:30] amen so so here you know we were at a
[51:33] point where they want if it's more than
[51:35] 10 they don't want us together and we
[51:37] met as Christians and as believers we
[51:39] are certainly adhering to what they're
[51:42] requesting the man is not a law but it's
[51:45] a request and as Christians a man we do
[51:48] decide I remember brother Branham making
[51:50] a statement he says as a as dumb as an
[51:52] American
[51:53] he says I'm identified with our glory
[51:56] and with her shame I believe sin has
[51:59] brought these things upon us amen but as
[52:02] Americans we are identified with the
[52:04] glory and with the shame so as Americans
[52:06] we have to adhere to the laws of the
[52:09] land we have to render unto Jesus what
[52:11] exceeds us but we also rid them to God
[52:13] what is God so this is why we hear amen
[52:17] and just happiness service them and as
[52:20] you're looking there on the video all
[52:22] you're seeing is me in the pulpit you
[52:23] saw my daughter here Flagler earlier but
[52:25] it's only a few of us here today just
[52:27] just producing this service for you but
[52:30] everybody else is at home we don't know
[52:31] how long it'll be like this with trust
[52:33] it's only gonna be for short time but
[52:35] this is what church had to come to in
[52:37] our generation a man that had to come to
[52:40] an old-line Street praise the Lord Amen
[52:44] but we thank God for the technology we
[52:47] thank God that we have the opportunity
[52:48] do this as we were approaching all these
[52:51] changing things this week information
[52:54] was coming from everywhere
[52:56] Amen you don't know what to believe a
[52:58] man you don't know what to take
[53:00] seriously because information is coming
[53:02] from everywhere and the unfortunate
[53:04] thing is that the information conflicts
[53:07] with other information a man so we're
[53:10] getting conflicting reports hallelujah
[53:13] and I just want to just take a little
[53:15] time and we'll talk a little bit about
[53:16] that today but before we go further one
[53:19] of the things
[53:20] was was troubling my spirit you know as
[53:22] as different churches was making
[53:24] decisions and you know our you know
[53:26] there were some sandwich sitting down
[53:28] they had to because their groups are too
[53:30] great they were well over 200 300 400
[53:33] people so they had to shut down some
[53:35] thousands of people so you know we're it
[53:37] up in this position where we didn't have
[53:39] to close so I say hey let's let's have
[53:40] two services on Sunday that's what we're
[53:42] doing everybody responded thank God for
[53:44] the responses we were ready to do that
[53:46] and and then they dropped it to ten so
[53:49] it's like okay we can't we can't do it
[53:50] the way that we want to do it but
[53:52] actually were processing that I said I'm
[53:54] sending my supper set in history because
[53:58] there's been plagues that have have come
[54:00] upon us in history how did people
[54:02] respond to this how did church leaders
[54:04] respond to these things in history I
[54:07] just had this this this thing about
[54:09] hearted and I really didn't know where
[54:10] to go and get it but I happen to be a
[54:12] part of a minister's chat group and one
[54:15] of the brothers put a quote out of that
[54:16] for Martin Luther they banned it and
[54:19] instead this when Martin Luther was
[54:21] dealing with the bubonic plague he wrote
[54:24] these words he says I shall ask God
[54:27] mercifully to protect us god I want to
[54:30] ask you mercifully to protect us from
[54:33] coronavirus amen I wanna ask you Murph
[54:36] sleeper to protect us he said I shall
[54:39] ask God mercifully to protect us then I
[54:43] shall fumigate hallelujah I like that
[54:47] fumigate this is you know I mean in an
[54:50] hour there would be us washing our hands
[54:52] and doing all the things that we might
[54:54] need to do just to protect ourselves and
[54:56] not just ourselves but to protect others
[54:58] and then he said then I shall do again
[55:01] help purify the air administer medicine
[55:06] Amen this is what a church a messenger
[55:10] spoke he says I shall that minister
[55:13] medicine I don't know
[55:15] and take it hallelujah so if they all
[55:19] the medicine and then he would take it
[55:22] now now I realized we have to be careful
[55:24] with this because there's so much
[55:26] information going that people tell you
[55:28] don't take the vaccine don't do it it's
[55:30] and don't do that a man you can only do
[55:32] what God leads you to do praise the Lord
[55:36] you can only do what God leeches you but
[55:38] but understand that when they give me a
[55:40] vaccine they are actually shooting you
[55:42] with a virus hallelujah when I went to
[55:45] Africa years ago and it made it had to
[55:48] take shots for a man I believe was
[55:51] typhoid fever something like that that I
[55:53] had to take shots for and like they gave
[55:55] me malaria pills but when I took this
[55:57] shot for the top part fever man I got
[56:00] sick it and I did I ever got sick in my
[56:02] life I thought I could go back to work I
[56:04] had to leave work go home lay in the bed
[56:06] because this thing that they shot me
[56:08] with was actually a virus and what it
[56:11] was doing was going into my body and
[56:12] causing my body to respond so that if I
[56:16] got sick when I was in Africa that a man
[56:18] would not have any bearing on me Oh
[56:21] hallelujah
[56:22] so so I understand that that is part of
[56:24] what they do and they give you a vaccine
[56:25] now you be a man of God on how you do
[56:28] things like that
[56:28] a man science has proven that sometimes
[56:32] these vaccines create more problems
[56:34] hallelujah Amen some I mean I think they
[56:36] even showed that some of the kids that
[56:39] are dealing with different symptoms
[56:40] today and Amen it's because of some of
[56:43] the things that they that they injected
[56:45] in their bodies so we got to be careful
[56:47] let the Lord lead you a man in these
[56:49] things hallelujah
[56:50] it meant said it he says I I shall
[56:53] fumigate help purify the air administer
[56:56] medicine and take it I shall avoid
[56:58] places and persons where my presence is
[57:02] not needed that's what that's what the
[57:06] Martin Luther said I shall avoid places
[57:08] and persons where my presence is not
[57:11] needed in order not to become
[57:15] contaminated and thus perchance and
[57:18] bleach and pollute others and so cause
[57:21] death as a result of my negligence so
[57:26] we're trying to do something right hey
[57:28] man listen
[57:29] he says if God should wish to take me he
[57:33] will surely find me and I have done what
[57:36] he has expected of me so and so I am NOT
[57:40] responsible for either my own death or
[57:42] the death of Ellis if my neighbor needs
[57:46] me however he says I shall not avoid
[57:50] place or person so if somebody's
[57:53] standing in the lead I'm come on I was
[57:59] grateful glory to God amen he says I'm
[58:03] coming if my neighbor hasn't me he said
[58:06] I shall not afford place a person
[58:08] I shall go freely as stated above it
[58:13] says see this is such a god-fearing
[58:14] faith because it is neither rash nor
[58:18] foolhardy foolhardy and does not tempt
[58:22] God I say you know when I when I read
[58:26] this I'll need it to hear something like
[58:28] that
[58:29] I don't want we don't want to be foolish
[58:31] in the way that we handle this is this
[58:33] thing yes we may have different feelings
[58:35] and beliefs as to what this could be a
[58:38] man but nonetheless we will out here
[58:41] amen to the recommendations that's been
[58:43] given us as long as we can
[58:45] there's other information that's been
[58:47] kind of flowing and there's more stuff
[58:49] that could be coming and we just got to
[58:51] be prepared we got to be fluent in a
[58:53] time like this but I know God's gonna
[58:55] make a way he gonna see us through Amen
[58:57] I'm not worried about that
[58:59] hallelujah thank God Amen that a
[59:02] messenger hat that type of wisdom on how
[59:05] to handle himself during the bubonic
[59:07] plague amen
[59:09] look at this I want to go for it too
[59:11] amen another quote from God's prophet a
[59:16] man William grant hallelujah amen now
[59:20] let me also just state this there's many
[59:25] of people rising up today with all kind
[59:29] of prophecies that they
[59:31] and they say I put it in my book 20
[59:33] years ago I put it here and I put it
[59:36] there and now it's all coming to pass
[59:38] you know and and III don't doubt that
[59:41] that happened
[59:42] amen I thank God for that I was recently
[59:45] watching something that just it bothered
[59:49] my spirit there's a man he calls himself
[59:53] a master prophet a man a master property
[59:57] the way he gets this title master proper
[1:00:00] because he's prophesized so many times a
[1:00:02] man and things that come to pass so you
[1:00:04] know pretty much they say if you're
[1:00:05] doing stuff that over and over again you
[1:00:07] get good and you become a master of it
[1:00:10] that don't even sound right according to
[1:00:12] the Bible right but there were masked
[1:00:16] the Prophet it's not in Scripture but
[1:00:18] this man was saving this and and while
[1:00:21] he was being interviewed by another man
[1:00:23] another gentleman that claimed that he
[1:00:25] used to be a pastor for 20 years and and
[1:00:28] used to be a pastor for 20 years he
[1:00:30] makes a statement on his on his from his
[1:00:32] broadcast while he's interviewing this
[1:00:34] master prophet and he says he says you
[1:00:38] know I know people have pastors but we
[1:00:40] don't need pastors we need a personal
[1:00:43] profit I said wow he just completely
[1:00:48] eliminated pastors from the church and
[1:00:50] saying everybody gotta have themselves a
[1:00:52] master prophet Oh fine now now now and
[1:00:55] the master prophet never corrected him
[1:00:58] on this just sit there and absorb this
[1:01:00] and I say there's something wrong with
[1:01:02] this spirit I don't care how many
[1:01:04] prophecies come to pass if you can't put
[1:01:07] yourself back in the scripture
[1:01:09] something's wrong with this fear so I
[1:01:11] wonder I wanna I wanna encourage the
[1:01:14] church be careful of all these so-called
[1:01:16] prophets
[1:01:20] that God had shoes for this generation
[1:01:23] and he came according to scripture if
[1:01:28] anything sell myself on what God said
[1:01:32] through his prophet that he said
[1:01:35] according to Malachi chapter 4 according
[1:01:39] to revelation 10 7 amen he fulfilled
[1:01:42] those scriptures so you know I want to
[1:01:44] read some things a man and a man gesture

[1:02:40] something here quickly as our times
[1:02:43] going listen did you know the Bible
[1:02:45] predicts that in the last days that
[1:02:47] there'll be a germ warfare now watch
[1:02:50] this man because the properties saying
[1:02:53] germ warfare and now eat these be
[1:02:56] keenest in 1954 and now for this thing
[1:03:01] to spread throughout the entire world
[1:03:04] Amen not just one country's dealing with
[1:03:06] it but every country I got a text
[1:03:08] yesterday from a friend down and a
[1:03:10] mannequin in Durban South Africa he's
[1:03:12] saying people down there a dime we heard
[1:03:15] from somebody in West Africa people over
[1:03:17] that they're invoking all these changes
[1:03:19] there to keep the people under curfew
[1:03:21] because of the effect of this virus this
[1:03:23] is worldwide the privacy
[1:03:25] they were amen there will be germ
[1:03:27] warfare hallelujah
[1:03:31] germ warfare amen these are disease
[1:03:35] diseases of viruses its germ warfare
[1:03:39] hallelujah glory to God now we and we
[1:03:43] can we can hear everything on a news and
[1:03:45] and how the president is not even
[1:03:47] calling it coronavirus a man he's coming
[1:03:50] in China virus says it came from China
[1:03:53] it started this is what he said now you
[1:03:56] know the Chinese are responding to that
[1:03:57] and the Chinese are said if you gonna
[1:04:00] stop saying that we're gonna withhold
[1:04:01] the medication hallelujah amen it
[1:04:05] becomes germ warfare glory to God now
[1:04:08] the problem is telling these things so
[1:04:10] this is why we're not alarmed this is
[1:04:11] why amen we're not scared
[1:04:13] this is why we're not operating in fear
[1:04:15] amen this is why you know that we have
[1:04:18] up we have a peace and a confidence even
[1:04:19] during this time we know God has already
[1:04:22] spoke to Astra's prophet
[1:04:23] look at this it says there would be a
[1:04:25] German war fair that diseases will break
[1:04:27] out upon the people and will follow on
[1:04:30] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost the Holy Spirit amen so anybody
[1:04:37] that does not have the baptism of Holy
[1:04:39] Spirit and then you are a candidate they
[1:04:42] meant to receive this virus hallelujah
[1:04:46] amen now don't let that alarm you
[1:04:48] because in the days of Moses those that
[1:04:51] did not have the blood apply to the door
[1:04:54] they were candidates but the Death Angel
[1:04:57] strike their house so my best advice to
[1:05:00] you a man is to be fit repent first
[1:05:04] being baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:05:07] Jesus Christ and according to God's Word
[1:05:10] you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost

[1:05:17] his word glory to God listen a man say
[1:05:21] the seasons will break out of other
[1:05:23] people and will bottom everyone without
[1:05:25] the baptism of the Holy Spirit now but
[1:05:28] with the angel or who had charge over
[1:05:31] these plagues was given orders to touch
[1:05:33] no

[1:08:28] Holy Ghost well according to my Bible
[1:08:31] right based on what I did and actually
[1:08:34] it was based on one thing I did
[1:08:44] so put the devil in his place up and
[1:08:47] give them scripture already if you ever
[1:08:50] want to defeat the devil
[1:08:52] you have to give them spiritually yeah
[1:08:54] Oh hallelujah

[1:08:57] little bit more here a man of this you
[1:09:01] says but the angel but but with the
[1:09:04] angel or who had charged over these
[1:09:06] plates was given orders that touched no
[1:09:08] one to whom the mark was Wow
[1:09:10] how much kind of teachers have we got to
[1:09:12] be brethren to get the church in order
[1:09:15] to be in that condition in new he says
[1:09:18] my arms are sore now from where the
[1:09:22] doctors at sponge needles in to try to
[1:09:24] knock you late me from yellow fever so
[1:09:26] forth I told him I didn't need it but
[1:09:28] they would listen to me
[1:09:29] but I'll tell you what God's going to do
[1:09:31] God's got a serum and it's called the
[1:09:34] Holy Ghost and when the serum goes in it
[1:09:37] immaculately you hallelujah in the last
[1:09:41] aches now you know there is a no doubt
[1:09:45] amen a tremendous tremendous amount of
[1:09:48] fear months to people with everything
[1:09:51] that's going on and I just want to just
[1:09:53] drop a few things into your spirit to
[1:09:55] try to encourage you
[1:09:56] amen we're not operating in fear you
[1:09:59] know just because we're here with a
[1:10:01] limited a man amount of people today
[1:10:04] don't mean we're operating fear right
[1:10:07] Amen we are rendering out to see just
[1:10:09] what a ceases a man hallelujah
[1:10:12] so you know the thing of it is is that
[1:10:14] we realize these things must come these
[1:10:16] things must happen but church I'm the
[1:10:19] expectation for a rapture glory to God
[1:10:22] but but I realize Amen that I that I
[1:10:25] there there's some people that I love
[1:10:27] that I want to see make it and I realize
[1:10:30] that this is a time that they must come
[1:10:32] so I begin to get desperate in my prayer
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:36] and Lord more please save this one and
[1:10:38] lord please restore that one and God
[1:10:41] through this so don't let them be lost
[1:10:43] God amen
[1:10:45] we gotta stand in the gap for somebody
[1:10:47] listen this message Amen the junction of
[1:10:52] time the profit makes a statement it
[1:10:54] says but then just before that God
[1:10:57] brought the show down to show who was
[1:11:00] God said there come a time that there
[1:11:04] was a provocation to the land by the
[1:11:06] name of heal our child who was ignoring
[1:11:09] it with the message of God and he
[1:11:12] performed the miraculous and proved that
[1:11:14] omnipotence still was miraculous I
[1:11:17] believe that a man he says the Prophet
[1:11:19] stood out there and closed the heavens
[1:11:22] that it didn't rain in the days of his
[1:11:24] ministry and he brought the rains down
[1:11:26] out of out of the heavens and give the
[1:11:28] earth and angels appeared on the scene
[1:11:30] hallelujah baked him some cornbread that
[1:11:34] kept him 40 days alive while he was out
[1:11:37] there in the wilderness with God
[1:11:39] angels appear in the in time we ought to
[1:11:46] be an expectation for this angels appear
[1:11:50] in the end time now that scripture that
[1:11:54] I've just read I think you're not that
[1:11:55] was angels going to carry that out
[1:11:58] hallelujah amen it was angels that was
[1:12:01] going to carry out God's instructions to
[1:12:03] destroy no matter who they were unless
[1:12:05] they had that shield on they couldn't be
[1:12:07] destroyed
[1:12:08] oh my god amen that still is important
[1:12:11] that seals the for in the days of Joshua
[1:12:15] and the children Israel when they were
[1:12:17] going through Jericho to take the land
[1:12:19] that God gave them Rahab was given a
[1:12:22] promise that if you would just hang this
[1:12:24] token the Scarlet thread out your window
[1:12:27] then everybody that is inside your house
[1:12:30] will be spared from the destruction that
[1:12:33] was about to come hallelujah we don't
[1:12:35] need people and their to be in our
[1:12:38] physical house but we need to know that
[1:12:41] they are in God's house spiritually in
[1:12:44] Christ spiritually if you get in
[1:12:48] shoes bill beats there look at this
[1:12:51] angels appear in the end time all the
[1:12:56] prophets and the signpost points and
[1:12:59] this day that angels will appear
[1:13:01] prophets will arise signs of wonders and
[1:13:04] if God did that for those little
[1:13:06] junctions back there
[1:13:07] what will he do now when all hell turn
[1:13:12] loose and if we don't realize our hell
[1:13:15] has been turned loose I don't know what
[1:13:17] we're looking at we gotta get up ahead
[1:13:21] out of the singing and then all hell has
[1:13:23] been loose at the barbershop
[1:13:37] now every time will show his hand God
[1:14:06] got something greater the devil wanna
[1:14:09] build a fire and put the Hebrew boys
[1:14:12] inside
[1:14:13] fire then God say I'll leave my home in
[1:14:16] heaven and I'll come down myself stand
[1:14:20] in the fire with these boys hallelujah
[1:14:23] God will always outdo the devil praise
[1:14:28] God they say Oh heaven we'll turn loose
[1:14:31] angels appearance signs and wonders on
[1:14:33] the earth the counterfeit arrives and
[1:14:35] God proven which is right and wrong amen
[1:14:39] I'm looking for all of heaven to break
[1:14:41] loose I was in the barber shop this week
[1:14:44] and young man was daring he made a
[1:14:48] statement of it and I was rushing to the
[1:14:50] barbershop I heard they might shut it
[1:14:52] down you know not any sense of business
[1:14:55] isn't going down that's a bad you know I
[1:14:58] don't know how long they go down let me
[1:14:59] go get my hair cut and ya Melanson a
[1:15:02] barber barber shopping we just began to
[1:15:04] talking and you know he was just saying
[1:15:08] you know what I feel like he said this
[1:15:10] is like an attack on three different
[1:15:12] levels it's a political attack it's an
[1:15:15] economic attack it's a religious
[1:15:18] religious impact religious it's coming
[1:15:21] against the religions as well as well I
[1:15:22] submit that's a really good way to look
[1:15:24] at this people can't go to work the
[1:15:26] economy is going to be messed up they
[1:15:29] are already telling us that if you can't
[1:15:32] go to work now you making the rules that
[1:15:36] won't allow me to go to work right but
[1:15:40] if you can't go to work the way that
[1:15:44] they're going to supplement you is by
[1:15:46] you taking out a loan right
[1:15:49] interest-free loan is that really an
[1:15:52] answer I'm gonna go in debt because I
[1:15:56] can't go to work
[1:15:57] that's not something's wrong with this
[1:15:59] picture right so so you know here he say
[1:16:02] he said this is this is a political
[1:16:04] economic religious and you know and and
[1:16:07] I and what church is not being able to
[1:16:09] meet the way that they normally meet we
[1:16:10] know
[1:16:11] has religious impact they won't use the
[1:16:14] word church and then because that begins
[1:16:17] to go give some of the amendments right
[1:16:19] but but they say other gatherings so
[1:16:22] you're including churches and other
[1:16:24] gatherings hallelujah politically we
[1:16:27] know that a man whenever the countries
[1:16:29] in the up war like this and it just so
[1:16:32] happens to be during its it's a it's an
[1:16:34] election year now then we get this an
[1:16:38] election year now and typically when the
[1:16:41] country's in an uproar like this it's
[1:16:44] always easier for us to not implement
[1:16:48] change but the state with the norm
[1:16:51] hallelujah we want to stay with the norm
[1:16:54] we don't want to change presidents we
[1:16:56] don't want to change governors we don't
[1:16:58] want to change it we want to stay with
[1:16:59] the north let them work us out of this
[1:17:02] particular situation I want to tell you
[1:17:04] your government is not just saying yeah
[1:17:06] but Jesus Christ is our Savior
[1:17:10] hallelujah but you gotta walk to his
[1:17:12] political its economic and it's
[1:17:15] religious amen
[1:17:16] now as I was talking to the young man he
[1:17:18] was saying now you know look at this it
[1:17:21] says you know that they're kind of
[1:17:23] modifying the hours of the grocery
[1:17:25] stores and you know at some point time I
[1:17:27] mean we might not be able to buy or sell
[1:17:29] now you're gonna scripture prop up
[1:17:31] prophesied this and they said now I'm a
[1:17:33] father with three little kids what you
[1:17:36] think I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and do
[1:17:38] whatever they need me to do in order to
[1:17:40] get food for my children I say no don't
[1:17:43] take the March whatever you do don't
[1:17:46] take my brother I know it might get
[1:17:49] tough but don't do that
[1:17:51] say were you rejecting Christ you taking
[1:17:53] the mark don't stay with the word of God
[1:17:57] in this hour no matter how
[1:18:00] stay with God's worked oh yes yes yes I
[1:18:03] want to tell you a man that I mean with
[1:18:07] this bit of economic a man impacted and
[1:18:10] there are many I don't want to make
[1:18:12] light of this but I want to encourage
[1:18:14] you in your faith some of us may lose a
[1:18:17] man work we may we may be in a loss of
[1:18:20] work we may not be able to go to work
[1:18:22] bring money to homes and and sometimes
[1:18:25] you need to begin to worry when things
[1:18:27] like that happened but I want to aim at
[1:18:30] if I can't just encourage you a man with
[1:18:33] God's faithful promise and when you're
[1:18:36] praying number taste another brand of
[1:18:38] just said angels will appear in the end
[1:18:41] times a signs and wonders it and I'm

[1:19:10] 3:11 and I was just blessed you know and
[1:19:15] I and I brothers chat yeah I was I told
[1:19:19] him about the service and you know what
[1:19:20] we're gonna have to do for the day and
[1:19:21] one of the brothers but never how're we
[1:19:23] supposed to pay tithes and offering now
[1:19:25] I'm glad people even think about that
[1:19:27] you know there's something that don't
[1:19:29] even consider that but how did we pay
[1:19:31] our tithes and offering I say well amen
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:34] because there is a promise for people
[1:19:37] that do that glory to God
[1:19:39] let's read what God said naw man I'm
[1:19:43] I'm not concerned about what man says
[1:19:45] I'm only concerned about what God says
[1:19:47] what God says is bring ye all the tithes
[1:19:51] into the storehouse that there may be
[1:19:54] there may be meat in mine house and

[1:20:26] a living witness that when I stood on

[1:20:33] when they come to the house of heaven
[1:21:01] bless is where heaven I've never seen I
[1:21:03] believe that our jobs is a resource but
[1:21:07] God is our source
[1:21:10] God will pray of God we heard it asked
[1:21:13] me if God used Ravens to provide room
[1:21:17] service to his prophet then the goddess
[1:21:20] unlimited what he'll do for you not just
[1:21:24] Ravens in the days of Elijah but you

[1:21:30] needed to pay tax you know where they
[1:21:33] found the money they did not go to work
[1:21:37] they did not get an extra job they went

[1:22:20] give you all heard the testimony system
[1:22:21] that couldn't go to church because my
[1:22:22] husband threw the keys into the lake
[1:22:25] didn't it didn't even realize it
[1:22:28] through the kids election see you ain't
[1:22:29] going to church number the lady lady up
[1:22:31] went to the supermarket to cook fish a
[1:22:35] man for dinner one night a man for her
[1:22:39] loving husband bless the name of Jesus
[1:22:43] we're never put up to tough took two
[1:22:46] hour to cook him a meal and when she
[1:22:49] went to splash the fish a man she's
[1:22:52] scale them and then she went to Berlin
[1:22:54] and sure right like what in the world is
[1:22:58] inside this fish and that she cut the
[1:23:01] fish
[1:23:09] nobody else could catch that fish the
[1:23:30] Bible tells us a man I will if I will
[1:23:35] not open you the windows were having a
[1:23:36] pour you out a blessing that there shall
[1:23:38] not be room enough to receive it and I
[1:23:41] will I love this I will this is not you
[1:23:44] doing it this is God doing it for you
[1:23:47] yet I will he's a mighty warrior strong
[1:23:50] in doubt I will rebuke the Devourer for
[1:23:54] your sakes and he shall not destroy the
[1:23:58] fruits of your ground
[1:23:59] neither show your fire can stir fruit
[1:24:01] before the time in the field saith the
[1:24:04] Lord of hosts this is what God says so
[1:24:07] sometimes Amen when Satan is bringing
[1:24:09] all that doubt we don't know how this
[1:24:11] could happen how to happen we know God
[1:24:13] said that he rebuke the Devourer I state
[1:24:15] can I give you another scripture just to
[1:24:17] encourage your heart Philippians 4:19
[1:24:22] these are things that you've read before
[1:24:24] you a menu here quoted all the time but
[1:24:26] I just wanted to take time to read it to
[1:24:28] you today amen this is what the word of
[1:24:31] the Lord says but my god hallelujah amen
[1:24:35] not up not my job hallelujah but my god
[1:24:41] this is what he said in his word but my
[1:24:44] God shall supply some of your needs
[1:24:50] oh oh that's not what the Bible say the
[1:24:52] Bible said all of your needs and what we
[1:24:55] heard last week all means Oh amen
[1:24:59] I need my god shows
[1:25:01] by all your need according to his riches
[1:25:06] and glory that means there if God is not
[1:25:09] limited by what we have here on earth my
[1:25:25] God shall supply all your need according
[1:25:28] to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus
[1:25:32] this is what the Word of God says so we
[1:25:35] stand on this promise a man we believe
[1:25:38] it's worked and we're gonna hold it on
[1:25:41] to that with everything we got
[1:25:42] now let me just go on to a couple other
[1:25:45] things here I'm going to skip down here
[1:25:48] it's conflicting reports conflicting
[1:25:52] reports and I won't give them all to you
[1:25:55] today I'll save something the next time
[1:25:57] we come but you know just last Monday we
[1:26:01] had the president stand gathers no more
[1:26:04] than 10 I mean CDC started at 250 then
[1:26:07] government I mean different governors
[1:26:09] jumped in and start talking to their
[1:26:10] their states in 700 and then you know
[1:26:13] CDC was saying 50 why the president was
[1:26:16] saying 10 and and we just had to come
[1:26:18] accompli you know which one do we go
[1:26:20] with until CDC finally said is exactly
[1:26:23] what the president said and I just felt
[1:26:24] within myself that if everybody's gonna
[1:26:27] be taken seriously they've got to say
[1:26:29] the same they've got to say the same
[1:26:32] thing hallelujah glory to God so so
[1:26:34] whenever said no gathers of people over
[1:26:37] 50 then it dropped to 10 we were just
[1:26:40] getting so many conflicting reports amen
[1:26:44] they told us that this was a virus that
[1:26:46] attacked the elderly a man so so so be
[1:26:50] careful anybody over 60 try to keep them
[1:26:53] out of amen of the public and you know
[1:26:57] out of galleries and things that because
[1:26:58] this is something attacking most people
[1:27:00] over 60 that's what they told us and
[1:27:02] then we start finding out a bunch of
[1:27:04] young people were dying from it right
[1:27:08] you know put everybody in fear you know
[1:27:12] it's a if I could just put it this way
[1:27:14] it's a free prison they don't even have
[1:27:18] to pay for it
[1:27:19] it's a free prison keep you in your
[1:27:21] house locked up won't come out free
[1:27:26] prison system how it'll be all right but
[1:27:29] but but you know they give us our this
[1:27:31] if and they can still fear and I will
[1:27:33] tell you I want to say some of the fears
[1:27:35] because they just don't know most of
[1:27:38] them just don't know they haven't seen
[1:27:39] anything like this and they don't know
[1:27:41] how to prepare for it I was just looking
[1:27:43] at a statement here from the Prophet I
[1:27:45] sent this out amen to you all in our
[1:27:47] letter to the church and I watched this
[1:27:49] what what he says here it says and the
[1:27:52] message then Jesus came it makes a
[1:27:54] statement it said this is and this is
[1:27:57] spoken in 1957 this is the darkest hour
[1:28:01] that this world has ever faced since the
[1:28:04] beginning of time since there has never
[1:28:07] been a time in all the world's history
[1:28:09] that is as that is dark as it is right
[1:28:12] now cancers on the rampage just think
[1:28:15] that I heard a statement the other day
[1:28:17] of this like this that there will be
[1:28:19] more people dying in America this year
[1:28:22] from smoking cigarettes that cause
[1:28:24] cancer that will die this year in
[1:28:28] America then there was killed in the
[1:28:30] four years of a Korean War more people
[1:28:32] with died smoking cigarettes a man then
[1:28:36] the people that died in the Korean War
[1:28:38] mom think about that nice for speaking
[1:28:41] of this 1957 and I can almost assure you
[1:28:44] that still there's more people dying
[1:28:46] today probably smoking cigarettes than
[1:28:48] even being attacked by this virus but
[1:28:50] they won't report it they won't report
[1:28:54] it they only report what they want us to
[1:28:57] know right in that way they can shape
[1:28:59] our minds and create fear right now look
[1:29:03] at what the promises
[1:29:04] it says cancers on the rampage diseases
[1:29:07] are happening and everything's taking
[1:29:10] place where we don't know what to expect
[1:29:12] the doctors don't know what to call the
[1:29:16] diseases now you know I found it very
[1:29:21] very
[1:29:22] strange amen that the Prophet spoke this
[1:29:27] and I'm gonna just keep reading because
[1:29:28] something that something that would just
[1:29:30] went through recently I just want to try
[1:29:31] to bring this in he says I says diseases
[1:29:36] are happening
[1:29:36] everything's taking place but we don't
[1:29:38] know what to expect the doctors don't
[1:29:39] know what the caller diseases so they're
[1:29:41] saying they're viruses the doctors don't
[1:29:45] know what to call the diseases so
[1:29:47] they're saying they're viruses now
[1:29:50] recently we had to you can just pull
[1:29:54] that over just the same you know
[1:29:56] recently we had to take my grandson to
[1:30:00] the to the emergency room his parents a
[1:30:03] man like my son-in-law and my daughter
[1:30:05] they took him to the emergency room we
[1:30:07] you know he had a really terrible fever
[1:30:10] and and I want to say this was just a
[1:30:13] few weeks ago that we had to take him
[1:30:15] and and when they when they went there
[1:30:18] to emergency room we got and they're
[1:30:22] trying to be diagnosed and everything
[1:30:24] and the only thing they could come back
[1:30:26] with for us is to say this is what we
[1:30:28] call a viral illness okay I don't think
[1:30:32] I've ever heard of a viral illness and
[1:30:35] what that was was really just a virus
[1:30:38] that's how they were saying and what the
[1:30:40] Prophet told us that when the doctors
[1:30:42] don't know what they say is virus virus
[1:30:46] and I said well well how did he get this
[1:30:48] oh there's so many ways because he just
[1:30:50] picked up stuff off the ground and put
[1:30:52] it in his mouth it's hard to believe
[1:30:56] some of the stuff that they're telling
[1:30:57] you you wait a minute you mean like when
[1:30:59] he dropped his pacifier and put it in
[1:31:02] his mouth
[1:31:02] so what we're doing is we're caring
[1:31:04] viruses how does this work what's going
[1:31:07] on because I know it's just really hard
[1:31:10] to really wrap your mind around what
[1:31:13] this is but they just used thing viral
[1:31:15] illness so they can tell you you got
[1:31:18] anything and they actually don't know
[1:31:21] right they don't know but they tell you
[1:31:24] you got
[1:31:27] I told something matter said now a few
[1:31:29] weeks ago man I was I had I had flu-like
[1:31:32] so I talked about before coronavirus had
[1:31:37] to take the even say this live because
[1:31:39] somebody that had me quarantine right
[1:31:42] but a few weeks ago I had a fever of a
[1:31:44] hundred or two on top before why
[1:31:46] everything was still in China
[1:31:47] I had a 102 people now you know somebody
[1:31:50] actually say did you go get that check
[1:31:53] out until I said look they didn't have
[1:31:54] no test kids when I had this but the
[1:31:58] Lord brought me through a man the Lord
[1:32:01] the Lord brought me through I took
[1:32:02] vitamin C I did okay I just basic things
[1:32:05] that you do hallelujah and that's what
[1:32:08] brought me through hallelujah do you
[1:32:11] know another conflicting report is that
[1:32:14] they tell you not to take they first
[1:32:16] said take ibuprofen
[1:32:18] then they said don't take it what a why
[1:32:22] why not take because there are many
[1:32:25] people that are saying they took it and
[1:32:27] actually got better from the flu like
[1:32:29] symptoms when they took the ibuprofen
[1:32:31] yeah what is really going on here right
[1:32:35] amen you better be led of God but for me
[1:32:38] I'm going to do the basic things that
[1:32:39] I've always done my you can see amen and
[1:32:42] just the necessary medicines that they
[1:32:45] give us right over I mean you need we
[1:32:47] got to get it from the pharmacist just
[1:32:48] go right there to the store pick it up a
[1:32:50] little bit it's over the cap just buy it
[1:32:52] and take it if you got blue like
[1:32:54] scepters you used to always do that and
[1:32:57] we got better now let me sit under that
[1:32:59] don't work no more huh no I don't
[1:33:02] believe it I use it it worked for me I'm
[1:33:04] talking I've been full Corona but they
[1:33:09] just used things like this a man is just
[1:33:12] a virus this is what they would call it
[1:33:14] and and this why we got to be so careful
[1:33:16] this one we need to know a man that we
[1:33:18] we got week weekend we got a confidence
[1:33:20] that our prayers hurt by our God and
[1:33:23] then he goes over says what is a virus
[1:33:26] what is a virus he says ask the
[1:33:30] doctor asked the doctor if something
[1:33:33] that he doesn't that he don't know
[1:33:35] nothing about
[1:33:36] he just says it's a virus
[1:33:40] hallelujah that's all there is there's
[1:33:43] little ol bugs and demons of flying that
[1:33:47] man never heard of before everything on
[1:33:50] the move everything we're trying to curb
[1:33:53] it with natural things but when we try
[1:33:55] to do this it breaks out something else
[1:33:58] so here's what I want I want you to know
[1:34:00] that this will calm down this will
[1:34:03] actually calm down
[1:34:05] but when it gets calm down something
[1:34:07] else is coming yeah hallelujah and we'll
[1:34:11] go through a whole exercise all over
[1:34:13] again yeah hallelujah amen Lord you got
[1:34:16] now that told me you need to pack up and
[1:34:18] stop powerful three years amen
[1:34:20] look tribulation is coming but I don't
[1:34:22] plan on being you put too much stuff in
[1:34:28] your house and your neighbor see the to
[1:34:30] God you might experience a break-in all
[1:34:33] right all right all right let's go up it
[1:34:36] says we're trying to curve it with
[1:34:41] natural things but when we're trying to
[1:34:42] do this it breaks out something else
[1:34:44] that's right you give a man penicillin
[1:34:46] penicillin for this and it'll set up
[1:34:48] something else you give this you're just
[1:34:50] all out of the way God has a way and we
[1:34:53] might as well get into it the churches
[1:34:56] has failed the Presbyterians failed the
[1:34:58] Methodists failed the Baptist fell in a
[1:35:00] Pentecostal fell the pinhole in his fell
[1:35:02] the Church of God failed we've everyone
[1:35:04] fell that's right what we need to do is
[1:35:07] get back to the Word of God now I wanna
[1:35:10] just bring out just another little
[1:35:12] little statement here and we'll try to
[1:35:15] shift gears and bring this home another
[1:35:17] completeness statement we said that we
[1:35:21] were told that this box now they don't
[1:35:24] know they call it coronavirus and the
[1:35:26] Prophet just told us that when they
[1:35:27] can't explain what it is they just
[1:35:29] called it a virus hey man we just all
[1:35:31] just gulp it you know
[1:35:33] right then but this virus they say was
[1:35:37] caused by people consuming bats this is
[1:35:39] the information that games that it was
[1:35:42] caused by people eating that suit and I
[1:35:45] just I talked really believe it but they
[1:35:47] say it does happen and then they also
[1:35:49] came out and said there's a special Evan
[1:35:51] call a pendulum and the pendulum was the
[1:35:54] cause of this I don't know either
[1:35:57] they first said animals could even get
[1:35:58] it so how did the animal start you know
[1:36:00] peggeleh right so and then then the last
[1:36:04] thing I heard is it's generated because
[1:36:08] of 5g technology I want to read
[1:36:12] something to you as you're hearing these
[1:36:14] things remember God sent us a prophet
[1:36:17] and he told us things 60 70 years ago
[1:36:20] before this even came to pass a man and
[1:36:23] all the others go back and look at this
[1:36:25] man he makes a statement and a message
[1:36:27] in Tison spirits there was there was a
[1:36:34] big article and let me let me also just
[1:36:36] mention this teachers we don't know who
[1:36:38] to believe or what to believe so don't
[1:36:41] get caught up on all that stuff this one
[1:36:43] said that that would say that let's
[1:36:44] rather than sending all these stories
[1:36:47] that are totally unconfirmed just
[1:36:51] somebody coming up with a story
[1:36:52] everybody want to be popular now right
[1:36:54] but these totally unconfirmed stories
[1:36:57] let's just send people the Word of God
[1:36:59] let's encourage each other with
[1:37:01] Scripture let's encourage each other
[1:37:03] with it with something let's thin the
[1:37:05] Word of God rather than sending all the
[1:37:06] nonsense
[1:37:07] hey man what we're gonna go and it is
[1:37:09] not edified its knowledge of information
[1:37:13] but it's not an affiant glory to God now
[1:37:17] look at different props a minute Isis
[1:37:18] fierce it says now we've applied it in a
[1:37:22] healing service always to the healing
[1:37:25] stock cancer tumor Catterick
[1:37:26] tuberculosis all those things are not
[1:37:29] natural things they are supernatural and
[1:37:32] our demons the scripture plainly
[1:37:36] indicates that but that is a demon in
[1:37:39] the body with gross like caps
[1:37:41] life in it and the life of that is a
[1:37:45] demon what we try to do is cast out that
[1:37:48] demon right amen
[1:37:50] says growth of a cataract the spread of
[1:37:53] tuberculosis and other diseases is
[1:37:56] demons that's in a physical form now
[1:37:59] this morning we're going to talk about
[1:38:00] demons in a spiritual form in the soul
[1:38:03] they're in the soul that's the same as
[1:38:05] they are in the body and we're bound to
[1:38:08] admit that we see them in people's
[1:38:09] bodies such as cancers and different
[1:38:12] diseases that's in the human body so
[1:38:14] when you see somebody attacked with one
[1:38:16] of these one of these illnesses and it's
[1:38:20] manifesting on out our part of the body
[1:38:22] you can see it you know that's a demon
[1:38:24] living hallelujah he says just recently
[1:38:28] even cancer has been declared to be a
[1:38:33] fourth dimension disease now I want us
[1:38:38] to watch this that is in another
[1:38:40] dimension sure it's demonology every
[1:38:43] disease is a fourth dimension disease
[1:38:46] the beginning of it now when they came
[1:38:49] out and said that this this could have
[1:38:52] come from this district of rotavirus or
[1:38:54] something that could have come from 5g
[1:38:55] technology I've thought about somebody
[1:38:58] mentioned this coating I've thought
[1:39:00] about that actually no because 5g
[1:39:02] technology is actually operating in the
[1:39:05] fourth dimension your cell phone it's
[1:39:09] operating in the fourth dimension right
[1:39:13] there's a lot of things that operating
[1:39:15] in that fourth dimension and even
[1:39:17] scientists were saying hey this 5g
[1:39:20] technology has the capability of
[1:39:22] producing a virus this is what they were
[1:39:25] seeing they were trying to stop them
[1:39:26] from producing it but yet it's just a
[1:39:29] report that I saw amen but yet they
[1:39:31] report them they did these things it you
[1:39:32] know we don't know if it actually came
[1:39:34] from the five jeep we don't know exactly
[1:39:36] that I can tell you right now your cell
[1:39:38] phone is creating cancer yeah they make
[1:39:41] your cell phone is doing that
[1:39:43] now will people put down their cell
[1:39:45] phone no they're not they know they're
[1:39:48] getting cancer but they still go had a
[1:39:50] thing right up today if it's a truth in
[1:39:53] now this is though
[1:39:54] this is how we live and if you didn't
[1:39:59] have a cell phone would be very
[1:40:00] difficult for you to get along today
[1:40:02] hey man this is just holiday but
[1:40:05] understand that what the property was
[1:40:06] telling us years ago we see it come to
[1:40:09] pass so don't let anything shock you do
[1:40:12] the best you can do the best you can
[1:40:15] don't don't operate in fear a man I mean
[1:40:18] maybe sometimes just pray over your
[1:40:19] phone before you pick it up lord please
[1:40:20] help me God got to use this thing but
[1:40:23] lord please help me and then these
[1:40:25] diseases are coming from that fourth
[1:40:28] dimension all right I want to just saw
[1:40:32] oh my there's so much more so much more
[1:40:38] I won't have time to let me let me skip
[1:40:41] down and read this never read this oh
[1:40:45] Jesus this is our this line up for me
[1:40:49] though to take to take on the whole
[1:40:51] armor of God
[1:40:53] another conflicting report they told us
[1:40:58] that this is something that could last
[1:41:00] 18 months but in China they only do it
[1:41:04] just a few months of this and and I
[1:41:06] understand China is on an economic
[1:41:09] rebound because they've overcome it
[1:41:11] already right now why is it that we got
[1:41:14] to go through 18 months but they only
[1:41:16] went through a few months complete the
[1:41:19] reports we don't know what to believe
[1:41:21] but I will tell you this take on the
[1:41:24] whole armor God now watch this rock star
[1:41:26] before I read this
[1:41:28] I was I told y'all I'm looking for
[1:41:30] miracles in the midst of all this chaos

[1:42:19] expecting the seat to be here
[1:42:23] I got an expectation that all heaven is
[1:42:25] about to break loose
[1:42:27] I've seen all hail now I'm looking for
[1:42:30] all glory to God let's be able to look
[1:42:42] out for I'm looking for God to make a
[1:42:44] way for you if you don't if you can't go

[1:43:05] no killing - there's our stealing all
[1:43:08] right all right all right
[1:43:09] I just want to drop these things into
[1:43:11] your spirit and then I'm gonna try to
[1:43:13] move on out of here take on the whole
[1:43:15] armour of God the Prophet said this now
[1:43:17] this thing that what China being blaming
[1:43:20] China being blame watch this watch this
[1:43:22] gold says there's three curves as I
[1:43:27] leave you this afternoon I'll leave this
[1:43:29] with you remember there's three curtains
[1:43:32] one of them's called the iron curtain
[1:43:33] one of them the bamboo curtain China and
[1:43:37] so forth Easter and then there's a
[1:43:40] purple curtain don't fear the bamboo
[1:43:43] curtain or the iron curtain now the
[1:43:46] bamboo will be China the iron curtain
[1:43:48] would be Russia but the purple curtain
[1:43:52] the purple curtain is wrong I would just
[1:43:57] reach out to quote i'ma Louie
[1:44:00] he says don't fear the bamboo curtain or
[1:44:03] the iron curtain but be careful of that
[1:44:06] purple one better be careful
[1:44:08] the Antichrist shall be so close to the
[1:44:11] sea the very elect
[1:44:12] what is the elected when that light
[1:44:15] shines upon that s o n son s you in
[1:44:19] shines in front of C that's governed by
[1:44:21] poppy life it'll come to life and when
[1:44:23] the s o in of God shines upon that for
[1:44:26] testing and seeing I'm praying even
[1:44:27] right now
[1:44:29] as people are streaming and watching
[1:44:30] this that the SOL is shining upon them
[1:44:32] for this thing to see it'll come to life
[1:44:34] that quick just as soon I don't care
[1:44:38] what state of life it might be a
[1:44:40] prostitute it might be a drunkard or a
[1:44:43] gambler in a shine at that minute as
[1:44:45] soon as it strikes it deceive the elect
[1:44:48] if it was possible now I looked at that
[1:44:52] because everything is trying to this
[1:44:55] China virus the president called amen
[1:44:58] China's not the thing that we need to
[1:45:01] worry about recently it came out in the
[1:45:04] news that Italy has more debts from the
[1:45:08] coronavirus then China did Oh the Pope
[1:45:21] the Pope the Vatican City is it Italy so
[1:45:26] brother branham just told us no don't
[1:45:29] get your Island back the bamboo curtain
[1:45:31] don't put your eye on the Iron Curtain
[1:45:34] but you better be watching the purple
[1:45:37] curtain
[1:45:38] so we better watch what comes from this
[1:45:40] because for me to me just one
[1:45:44] announcement all you gotta say is
[1:45:47] covin 20 October 21 a new strain that's
[1:45:53] not against it and then then all of us
[1:45:55] the whole not just the nation but the
[1:45:58] world goes into a panic everybody shut
[1:46:02] down just like that
[1:46:03] and governments don't know what to do
[1:46:05] they're looking for somebody with an
[1:46:07] answer well they got a man that'll come
[1:46:10] up come forth and be their Savior a
[1:46:12] court in the scripture the Pope will
[1:46:14] come into that place and they were
[1:46:15] easily give it right to just just
[1:46:20] recently before this even happened
[1:46:21] they had a thing a man where all the
[1:46:24] different religions of the world sign a
[1:46:27] document that they would become one they
[1:46:30] become one but they were all followed
[1:46:32] underneath the Catholic Church right so
[1:46:35] so with all these things already in
[1:46:38] we got a lot to look at here hey man
[1:46:41] there's a few that won't follow that we
[1:46:44] had a prophet go to Rome and refused to
[1:46:48] go see the Pope had a open invitation
[1:46:51] but walked out because they say I will
[1:46:54] not bow to kiss a man's ring I will not
[1:47:00] miss it if you want me to call them
[1:47:01] Reverend come on this I'll do that but I
[1:47:03] ain't bad I ain't kiss his ring I ain't
[1:47:05] doing none of that say cancel my
[1:47:08] appointment a prophet did that Oh glory
[1:47:12] to God ain't man hallelujah we didn't
[1:47:16] follow a message where a prophet did
[1:47:17] that we might be called upon to do the
[1:47:19] same thing no we're not gonna do Church
[1:47:21] doors may be shut because we won't go
[1:47:24] into yeah that's okay
[1:47:26] we're stepping on the words the word
[1:47:28] will bring us through let me just uh
[1:47:30] just kind of bring this in I gotta I
[1:47:35] gotta give you this you see I met this
[1:47:39] last quote daughter gonna read is not a
[1:47:41] legacy interchange and let me let me
[1:47:43] just drop this off before we before I go
[1:47:45] in there I just got a few more minutes
[1:47:47] then I'm gonna wine this up the angel
[1:47:51] was in corn riot was totally me zq9 said
[1:47:55] seal up those that sign and crying for
[1:47:59] the combination ascendancy it says now
[1:48:02] first there was instruction to go
[1:48:04] destroy but that ain't corn Rhonda was
[1:48:06] amongst those that were going to
[1:48:08] distress it now before you destroy seal
[1:48:10] up those in a sign and crying for the
[1:48:13] abomination that's in the city and there
[1:48:15] could be no killing in the city until
[1:48:18] there was a ceiling by Almighty God my
[1:48:20] brother Bradley say when was that when
[1:48:24] was that actually fulfilled
[1:48:25] he says when Titus the Roman general
[1:48:28] went into Israel Jesus even props out
[1:48:32] there come a day there'll be no stone
[1:48:34] left upon another one that the psycho
[1:48:35] say look at how beautiful the template
[1:48:37] say that's kind of the day there won't
[1:48:38] be a stone left on top of another you
[1:48:40] say don't know yet caught
[1:48:41] and the temple and things of that nature
[1:48:43] they say he said but they say when Jesus
[1:48:45] spoke that and Titus the Roman general
[1:48:47] came in and actually destroyed Jerusalem
[1:48:51] he said what Ezekiel was prophesied was
[1:48:55] for feel then glory to God he says but
[1:48:59] before that was actually fulfilled God
[1:49:03] did a mighty outpouring of the Holy
[1:49:07] Ghost amen
[1:49:08] into the upper room and when they
[1:49:11] received the Holy Ghost of the upper
[1:49:12] room that was the angel that a corn
[1:49:15] rider going through riding a man and
[1:49:19] building them with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:21] stealing them with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:23] hallelujah he said this was before the
[1:49:26] destruction of Jerusalem they meant
[1:49:28] that's the ceiling angel went for the
[1:49:31] steal with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:32] they received it on the day of Pentecost
[1:49:34] hallelujah
[1:49:35] I am so glad that God put a promise amen
[1:49:39] in his Bible that that that the poor the
[1:49:43] outpour the corner toe is for the last
[1:49:45] days not just a mint pinnacles but we
[1:49:49] should be expected it today
[1:49:51] glory to God when Jerusalem was about to
[1:49:54] be destroyed and I could say this whole
[1:49:56] world is about to be destroyed but
[1:49:59] before the destruction God sends the
[1:50:02] Angels a bring of stealing and greed not
[1:50:05] the Holy Spirit whereby I seal that's
[1:50:11] why we're praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:50:13] that's why we have
[1:50:15] meaning we've already been into this we
[1:50:23] don't kill the silly
[1:50:27] praise God and I'm claiming that fall
[1:50:31] over my lungs no killing - there's a
[1:50:34] ceiling over God glory that cop if it
[1:50:39] happened in Ezekiel 9 a man and God with
[1:50:43] hell things they're all we took to the
[1:50:47] time that Jesus came on the earth and
[1:50:49] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:50:51] there a man on the day of Pentecost
[1:50:54] where I'm the expectation for another
[1:50:56] outpoint another manifestation of
[1:50:58] Almighty God we can see destruction all
[1:51:01] over the land people dying everywhere a
[1:51:03] thousand may fall at my side ten
[1:51:05] thousand on my right side but it shall
[1:51:07] not come down my plane I'm expected all
[1:51:10] heaven to turn loose I'm looking for the
[1:51:13] sealing of God to take place in his
[1:51:15] people brother Branham say that that
[1:51:17] boxcar get seal it seal to his destiny
[1:51:21] shame glory to God glory to God
[1:51:24] father let let let a sealing take place
[1:51:26] in the people a true sealing of the Holy
[1:51:28] Ghost look at this if what they're
[1:51:33] telling us about Italy all these things
[1:51:37] are true we can see just through
[1:51:39] prophetic lens that there's more to this
[1:51:43] than what everybody else is seeing and I
[1:51:47] just want to just read your quotes so
[1:51:49] that you can understand no not not for
[1:51:51] us to operate in fear but we need to
[1:51:54] know where we stand as believers glory
[1:51:57] to God we need to know hysterically you
[1:51:59] didn't go back to some of these same
[1:52:00] messages that I'm I'm giving you you can
[1:52:02] go back and listen to what the prophets
[1:52:04] said Amen go back and read what the
[1:52:06] promises but get yourself prepared for
[1:52:09] this get yourself prepared amen don't
[1:52:12] let it catch you off guard but be
[1:52:14] prepared for what what God is getting
[1:52:16] rid of doing this out I'm under
[1:52:18] expectation
[1:52:19] mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost not
[1:52:23] just for us love hallelujah
[1:52:29] oh I can expect it because the promise
[1:52:33] is up to me and to my children those are
[1:52:38] that are far off as many as the Lord our
[1:52:41] God shall call that's what God said text
[1:52:48] my my son-in-law this morning I said
[1:52:50] what was that virus that they said that
[1:52:56] what was the virus and he text me back
[1:52:59] and told me you know what this virus was
[1:53:03] and he said they call it a viral illness
[1:53:05] you know by repairs I said okay thank
[1:53:07] you sir yeah you know I'm gonna use that
[1:53:09] in my sermon this morning we don't
[1:53:10] without streaming service online the
[1:53:12] anomaly used that in my sermon deploy he
[1:53:14] said Kim what what else pretty repair so
[1:53:18] to say how we get on periscope so we can
[1:53:20] follow the service this morning
[1:53:21] it's good to have my son in service
[1:53:25] today
[1:53:27] add my daughter and my grandson in
[1:53:30] service the day
[1:53:32] praise the Lord God is good if this is
[1:53:38] the case I can easily see how our how
[1:53:42] our nation in the nations of this world
[1:53:46] will fall right underneath what the
[1:53:49] Catholic Church has been want to do all
[1:53:50] along and this prophecy according to
[1:53:52] Scripture that the Pope would rise as
[1:53:55] the Antichrist amen
[1:53:57] break he'll head you'll have the answer
[1:54:00] the Book of Daniel speaks of how he will
[1:54:02] cause a man thinks to prosper mine all
[1:54:07] these things are written in Scripture so
[1:54:08] we gotta watch all this winter when the
[1:54:10] economy's falling apart the Pope can
[1:54:12] come on and cause things to prosper I
[1:54:14] don't know about you but I'm looking
[1:54:16] forward to getting out of here before a
[1:54:17] lot of this stuff goes down so let's
[1:54:19] watch this leave a signature change even
[1:54:24] at the barbershop they're talking
[1:54:25] one-world water
[1:54:26] everybody knows about it they know the
[1:54:29] big words to put big buzz where it's
[1:54:31] been Illinois how it's all gonna come
[1:54:32] about you know when you reject the word
[1:54:35] you actually take on the mark of the
[1:54:36] beast yeah
[1:54:38] when you reject the truth you take on
[1:54:40] the market of Issa amen it's not going
[1:54:42] to be some some some tattoo on your
[1:54:44] forehead or something like that no it's
[1:54:47] just rejecting the Word of God look at
[1:54:50] what the Prophet says it says how
[1:54:51] fitting were the characteristics
[1:54:54] now this last age to represent the age
[1:54:57] in which we now live for example in
[1:55:01] worship one god Zeus who was the chief
[1:55:03] and father the gods this forecast the
[1:55:06] 20th century one Godfather of us all
[1:55:09] religious premise premise that set for
[1:55:13] the brotherhood of man
[1:55:15] and in his even now bringing together
[1:55:17] the process so this religious premise is
[1:55:20] what's bringing together the Protestants
[1:55:22] not told y'all they signed a document
[1:55:24] bringing everybody to get the exist I
[1:55:26] met just recently within the last year
[1:55:28] so says together Protestants Catholics
[1:55:30] Jews Hindus etc all religions of the
[1:55:34] world sign this document o says with the
[1:55:38] intent that a mutual form of worship
[1:55:40] will increase our love look at what the
[1:55:43] prophecy says understanding and care of
[1:55:47] each other
[1:55:48] it says the Catholics and Protestants
[1:55:51] are even now striving for an actual
[1:55:53] actually gaining ground in this union
[1:55:55] with the avowed intent that all others
[1:55:58] will follow this very attitude was seen
[1:56:01] in the United Nations organizations when
[1:56:04] the world leaders refused to recognize
[1:56:06] any one individual concept of spiritual
[1:56:09] worship but recommended putting aside
[1:56:11] all those separate concepts with the
[1:56:14] hopes that all religions become level
[1:56:17] into one for all desire the same goals
[1:56:20] all have the same purposes and all are
[1:56:23] basically right now the Prophet has
[1:56:24] warned us against this remember don't
[1:56:27] get your eye on the bamboo curtain
[1:56:28] don't put your eye a man on the iron
[1:56:31] curtain but you better be watching the
[1:56:35] purple curtain it says notice the main
[1:56:38] latest even the people's rights for
[1:56:40] justice other people's was there ever an
[1:56:43] aged like the 20th century church age
[1:56:46] that has seen all nations rising up and
[1:56:48] demanding equality socially and
[1:56:51] financially this is the age of the
[1:56:54] Communist age of the Communists that we
[1:56:58] when we when we look at quotes like this
[1:57:00] we always think in Russian China is a
[1:57:03] communist
[1:57:04] and we get all of our goods from where
[1:57:10] watch it now
[1:57:12] since says this is the age of the
[1:57:15] Communists were all men are supposedly
[1:57:17] equal though it is only so in theory it
[1:57:22] says this is the age of political
[1:57:24] parties who called themselves man see we
[1:57:33] don't cheapen Christianity so that all
[1:57:36] the person has to do is step up and
[1:57:38] confess out of their mouth and they do
[1:57:41] not change their lifestyle after the
[1:57:43] confession right no you're just gonna
[1:57:46] take more than a confession out of your
[1:57:48] mouth you gonna have to live like Jesus
[1:57:50] amen
[1:57:51] after you confess that he died for your
[1:57:53] sins Amen glory to God listen it says it
[1:57:58] says they caught who called themselves
[1:58:00] Christian Democrats and Christian
[1:58:03] socialists Christian Commonwealth
[1:58:06] Federation etc according to our liberal
[1:58:08] theologians Jesus was a socialist and
[1:58:10] the early church under the guidance of
[1:58:13] the Spirit practice socialism and thus
[1:58:15] we ought to do so today when the
[1:58:18] ancients called Laodicea the metropolis
[1:58:21] it was looking forward to the one-world
[1:58:25] government and this is brother branham's
[1:58:31] going back into history now the latest
[1:58:32] Ian see Frank and all the things that
[1:58:35] they were going through that same spirit
[1:58:37] that was in that city is not a breakfast
[1:58:39] didn't in the end time he says when the
[1:58:42] ancients Carletta see the metropolis it
[1:58:44] was looking for - the one-world
[1:58:46] government that we're now setting up as
[1:58:49] we think of that city being the location
[1:58:52] of a great church council we see
[1:58:54] foreshadowed the echod miracle move
[1:58:56] taken place today when very soon we will
[1:59:01] see all the so-called Christians come
[1:59:04] together
[1:59:06] nd the church and state religion and
[1:59:09] politics are coming together now with a
[1:59:11] with the spread of something like this
[1:59:13] can't you see how easy it is for
[1:59:15] everybody just to come again yeah put us
[1:59:18] down all of our differences we want
[1:59:20] everybody protect it we won't ever let
[1:59:22] us see let's just come together right he
[1:59:24] says that religion and politics are
[1:59:26] coming together the tears are being
[1:59:29] bound the week will soon be ready for
[1:59:33] the garden now he's quoting the
[1:59:35] scripture will read this this is about a
[1:59:37] Matthew 13 and 30 Oh glory to God let
[1:59:43] both grow together until the harvest and
[1:59:47] in the time of the harvest Matthew 13
[1:59:50] and 30 so then the time of the harvest I
[1:59:53] will sneak to the repossessed angels
[1:59:55] that's angels for the RAM Matilda that's
[1:59:57] angels gather you together first the
[2:00:00] tares and bind them in bundles you know
[2:00:04] come together by unfounded bundles to
[2:00:07] burn down destruction but gather the
[2:00:11] wheat into my barn and brother Branham
[2:00:14] is telling us very clearly we're seeing
[2:00:15] the tears being bound together but the
[2:00:20] wheat will soon be ready for the garner
[2:00:22] Church I don't know about you but I'm
[2:00:24] looking forward to getting out of here I
[2:00:26] know that God has sent us a prophet to
[2:00:29] forewarn us and many of these things we
[2:00:31] can see that this is a spiritual thing
[2:00:33] that we're facing and it's going to take
[2:00:36] a man spiritual weapons and or
[2:00:39] overcome their mighty through God
[2:00:45] through the pulling down of strongholds
[2:00:46] and I'm just under expectation I gotta
[2:00:49] read their music you're not before there
[2:00:52] was a killing there had to be a sealing
[2:00:56] a man I'm expecting God to do something
[2:01:00] he's gonna bring somebody in now
[2:01:01] somebody's about to be restored now you
[2:01:04] know what they can't even help
[2:01:06] themselves they want to stay out there
[2:01:08] in the world but they realize no there's
[2:01:09] something more to this and as I read
[2:01:11] that I said on Wednesday night you know
[2:01:14] many people waiting on the prophecy that
[2:01:17] God told brother Billy Paul before you
[2:01:19] become an old man sharks that be
[2:01:21] swimming when you stand there well that
[2:01:23] happened actually
[2:01:24] 70s and 80s there was an earthquake that
[2:01:27] hit Los Angeles and and the main
[2:01:30] building where brother brother Billy
[2:01:31] won't stand in front of a building they
[2:01:33] sent out a memo saying do not go into
