night and um just just really appreciate what the Lord is doing in his in his uh in his life and uh just his ministry and um uh so happy he was able to be with us and they had invited um they knew they'd be here in Florida for a little bit so they invited some other friends to come from um um the Indianapolis area uh and this is uh brother Josh and sister Diane amen that has come from that area to be here with brother Jonathan and Sister Sarah and um they some of you all might remember the name brother hunter from years ago uh out of M Indiana so they come from that church uh so it's good to have them with us and and it and and I don't think it's about happen stands I think it was all orchestrated by God sometimes we don't we don't realize how things are just weaving like this uh they had a their son their oldest son was scheduled to be here in Florida this weekend just to come visit Florida and uh they text him said he was coming to church and the son came to church to be with us so God bless you good to have you precious friend with us amen uh God God just does great things amen so it's so good to have have them I see my cousin back there uh Ashley amen huh huh cuz who else okay yeah they've been coming they've been coming for weeks though they've been coming to Sunday school and everything so yeah I see all them I see them every week amen but good to good to have them praise the Lord amen so um we um we want to just give uh to to today's announcements so tonight I'm sorry um Wednesday night we have service at 7:30 now we have um Brother Willie mcgaan from Alaska is coming to be with us on Wednesday night Amen Brother Willie McGaw so we'll be looking forward to having him uh on on Wednesday and uh don't forget our streaming continues through Twitter and Facebook and then also on our church website John 423 org um we there are two things kind of happening we we have the corporate fast still happening and as I mentioned to you all what corporate means is that everybody get involved uh it is very similar to what happened in the book of uh Esther when Esther was getting ready to go before the king uh she was so afraid because she knew her life was at stake and she uh told her uncle Mori she says please have everybody fast before I go and to see the king and said if I perish I perish but I'm going to go in to see the king Amen on on everybody's behalf so they all went into a corporate fast and that's what we do here we don't make it we don't try to be legalistic about it whatever the Lord leads you to do some are doing technology some are doing fast into a certain time of day some are changing their diets you know whatever the Lord leads you to do that's that's fine but we just ask that everybody be involved in this corporate fast we'll be running through March 9th which is next uh Saturday I believe amen our fast will come to a close then uh so keep that in mind and the other thing that's coming to a close at the end of the fast is that God gave us a mandate 40 days of not saying anything negative I hope y'all been keeping up with what God say if you ain't repent just repent but 40 days of not saying one thing negative praise the Lord cuz that's how Israel got in trouble they just kept complaining saying it delayed their promises we don't want our promises to be delayed by what we say out of our mouth you know what you speak out of your mouth can bring your promises to you or it can delay them from you so be careful what you say Amen but we're going to be going through to next amen next next week uh the the March 9th will be the end of our 40 days of not saying nothing negative now I hope on the 41st day I just hope y'all ain't been saving up all your' negative statements and just go you just canceled out everything don't try to keep control of your tongue praise the Lord so uh but that's that that'll be uh through the through through next week uh also don't forget our Sunday school is um uh happening 9:30 to 10:00 a.m. every Sunday um the youth ages 4 to 12 and then the young adults ages 13 to 20 and everyone is welcome to attend that young adult class amen um we got some wonderful brothers that are that are taking the lead and teaching those classes and when I've been here here thus far has been a blessing so uh we want to want to continue that um sisters uh virtual prayer is this Tuesday at 7:30 amen so don't forget that and again the brothers I apologized last week I I forgot to let everybody in I was just so caught up in what I was doing i' never had a day like Tuesday Amen in all my life I had never had a day like that but I thank God for it but you all forgive me for for missing amen that we had our tape service on Friday night and I just had a wonderful time listening to the word of God I tell you as brother Brandon was was preaching the sermon Mary's belief he start calling out conditions at the end and uh when he got to the end we just start grabbing a hold of if if he can call out that situation I'm dealing with the same thing I'm I'm I'm believing God for my healing too amen but we we thank the Lord for the word it's alive and well amen it's a Living Word uh so uh sisters don't forget your your the the the virtual prayer Tuesday at 7:30 next Sunday 2:00 a.m. in the morning where most of us are sleeping all of us should be sleeping uh 2:00 a.m. in the morning we're going to spring ahead an hour uh and um and with us springing forward an hour that means 2:00 become 3:00 and that mean you want to set your clock before you go to bed that way you're not late

that you thought you weren't going to make it through but somehow some way you ended up on the other side of it amen God will bring us bring you through no matter what it is we thank the Lord amen so um on today the Lord had just kind of placed a little something in my heart uh to do just a little differently and um we like I mentioned we had a actually I in the month of February um I didn't preach one sermon on Sunday because we had um visitors I want to say three Sundays and then I was away for one Sunday uh in South Carolina but nonetheless I have been enjoying uh the services that God has been given brother Simba make reference to it uh this morning that God has really been bringing ministers here to just feed our souls and and we have really really been enjoying oursel but um the the I want to say back in January I was just kind of praying over this and uh the Lord just put in my heart to do a Mishawaka service on the very first Sunday here in March and what some of y'all might say what is a Mishawaka service I'm going to explain it to you all right so when brother brandom uh first came amongst the Pentecostal people uh it I believe it was in mwaka Indiana is where uh he he met them and and he was he got there and he was like Wow never never seen anything like this and and uh when he was there you know uh he said he saw the the old preacher come out and he said um he was criticizing and like why would they let a old man come out there and preach like that all these preachers in here why they got this old man he say the old man uh got to talking about uh where were you and the sons of God shout it for joy and the morning Stars saying together and he said he was all over the horizontal the rainbow and bringing Christ all over the place and they said the man got so stirred up he jumped up and kicked his heels and said y'all ain't got enough room for me to preach up here and the brother Adam said whatever that man got if it make him act like that I need some of that and uh he talked about how you know he was um uh sleeping in his car you know didn't have room money for a hotel but sleeping in his car uh he talked about the sear sucker uh um pants or something like that and how he you know just just uh the way he was living and and he was he was um just at this meeting just enjoying himself amongst the Pentecostals and uh when he got um they they call all the ministers up say introduce yourself you know uh to the congregation all the ministers in the congregation so everybody come up and introduce and brother brandham one of the ministry say William Bram Jeffersonville Indiana and he go sit down and you know that was it well the next day and M walk they uh they said there was a minister that came to the platform last night by the name of William Brandon anybody know where he at cuz we want him to bring the sermon this morning brother Rand say oh my begin to sink down in his seat and um they say well anybody know where he at anybody know William brandom no he would brother Brandon wouldn't say nothing so this one fell looked at brother brand say do you know him yeah I know him well go get him well I can't go get him cuz I'm him he said you him they want you to go up there he said I can't go up there in the t-shirt and I can't go up there dress like this he said no they don't care nothing about that going up there go on up there and preach he's like no no no no no no no I'm not going up there so they say anybody know William R said yeah he is he is got told out so brother R and went up there to to minister and you know he said he took a a text um and uh then he cried he talking about the rich man you know and that that open his uh lifted up his eyes in hell he says and then he cried say there was no mama there and then he cried there was no Daddy there then he cried brother random said then I cried but during that um um service this is kind of where the idea of Mishawaka comes from and I I I was introduced to this when I went to London uh a few years ago at brother whisper church and they would have uh they would give a certain topic and then one Minister would come and read the scripture for the topic and uh he would you know take off and just everybody would kind of take State on that theme on that theme uh so the Lord just kind of you know uh they had about four ministers at that time to do it when I first was introduced to it and when brother whisper said it being from him being from Zimbabwe when he said Mishawaka I thought this was something from Zimbabwe but then then it struck me said oh you y'all done took something from the prophet and I said okay I got you brother brother GW I said okay I like this so today we're going to have actually five ministers to come now don't don't don't be alarmed don't be alarmed because they all limited as to how long they can speak they have a limit on their on their on their speaking and now what I didn't tell them and what they do in Zimbabwe is that if a minister goes over his time the next Minister just bumps him right on off and just keep on preaching but hopefully they all set their timers so that they don't they don't go on time but uh each one will just have a certain amount of time to present their thought and um um I won't tell you what the theme is you already know what our theme is for the year you already know the them so if you know the them for the year then you know what they're going to do a portion of what they're going to do today amen and uh some since some don't know I I'll just say uh the Lord has had us on the theme I will restore saith the Lorden so our first Speaker today will be brother quu amen let's stand our feet and let's welcome Amen brother quu uh to the pull pit he may have a little extra time because he'll open in a word of prayer as well as open the scripture uh so he'll have a little extra time but the others will come Amen in a particular order amen and I did want to say this before I give the pull pit I'm so glad God has blessed our church with all these ministers that we can do something like this on to day I appreciate each one of them amen God bless you brother quu amen he's coming all right praise the Lord amen let's welcome [Music] him shall we pray our Lord we thank you for this our Lord Jesus Christ take prominence Lord father of this meeting and father Lord let your word that you ordained before the foundation of the world for your people today manifest them Lord Jesus that Lord surely we shall be restored and we are restored father whatever Lord the enemy has stolen from us families individuals the church Lord father Ministry in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ even as we hear restoration May each and everyone be restored in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you so we go right ahead and if I can have the slide we're going to read the scriptures we're going to use that is Joel chapter 1:4 and Joel 225 the first one is that which the Palmer worm had left had a locust eaten and that which Locust has left has the cankerworm eating and that which the cankerworm had left had the caterpillar eating amen but thank God for restoration so the second portion is the Lord restoring what this insect to from the church so Joel 2:25 I will restore to you this is personalized to you Hallelujah the years I go over again I restor to you so take it personally I take it personally the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm and the ctip and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you amen the Lord has sent a great Army to you amen GL praise be to the name of the Lord so let's go to the next slide my portion is to talk about Palmer worm now Palmer worm I wanted to find what is the mean of pal poem Pama is actually WR from French word pom which means a pilgrim an insect that migrate somebody that can change it form metamorphosis we can take our seat sorry metamorphosis so in the old French where they used to be real Christian Nation they used to go and pilgrimage to Israel and now when you go to Israel the Holy Land and you come back to France to show that you went to Israel you have to bring a palm leaf so that's why they had the word pomel to prove that you had traveled to the Homeland land and then the Hebrew word for Palama is gazm which means to cut off CU this animal will come if you take it the natural this insect will come to let's say cornfield and they take all the leaves they will chew eat everything that they can chew and as we talk about the natur taking the spiritual whatever the enemy has taken from you so that was it so it's said inser like a caterpillar which wers like a Palmer or a pilgrim which travels like a pilgrim in the bands Joel 24225 It's wingless Locust it migrates in the lover stage let's go to the next slide now before we go to something that was destroyed let's go to what what there should be a beginning there should be something Where's My Water there should be something here right to be removed from its place before it could be restored so let's go to what happened in the alha church the Lord you look at the church like a pyramid form the Lord set the basis he was the rock of the church the roots of the church but the root cannot be destroyed thank God for that the root is the Lord Jesus Christ himself eternity amen the tree the leaves and the flowers and things could be destroyed but the root beneath the Earth could not be destroyed same thing what eternity has declared in the mind of God about you your family the devil can never destroy amen so in the CH the Lord himself laid the foundation then the Lord put uh Paul to set the church as the basis so Church uh Paul was like the alpha age that was around 833 to 8055 and then other Messengers came around then said that the Roman demons came in to take away what God planted what the ministry planted that there's only one God oh Israel the Lord your God is one they chop it off and then they substitute Trinity God in three person which is a lie of the devil so now so this H animals Palmer worm Locus canker worm caterpillar they are from the pit of Hell they are from The Fifth Dimension it's just Satan the Old Devil death hell and grief same insect same Old Devil who translate or who metamorphosize himself from pal to Caterpillar to whatever the same devil who brings about false Doctrine destroying families bring destroying the church is the same old devil but thank God for the restoration amen let's go to the next slide glory to the Lord now here is where I got this uh message from he said listen close there were four four death Messengers kill that tree what was it pal Locust caterpillar and so on four messengers of Roman Devils d kill the tree one took it root back leaves and so on and so forth then said four Messengers killed the tree all by the roots and then if four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree Glory Hallelujah Before Destruction there's Resurrection already for you amen so let's go to yeah so he said by four death Messengers kill the leave I will restore Martin Luther was one of the life Messengers He restored justification to the church amen Wesley was one of the life Messengers he restor sanctification Holiness to the church then Pentecost William S was one of the messengers He restored the gift to the church then William Braham was the fourth Messengers He restored the Lord Jesus Christ himself to the church amen let's go to the next slide Glory Hallelujah so these are the messengers Luther justification Wesley sanctification SE the gift and William Braham Christ and all the messengers came from the hand of Eternity God himself the six Dimension the Jesus Christ himself restoring everything that the devil has stolen from you Glory Hallelujah don't look at church don't look at building but look at you what has the the devil stolen from me what has he stolen from you the Lord is restoring to you this day amen Glory Hallelujah let's go I think that's the last slide let me make sure I want to okay thank God so I'm done so the everything that you need the Lord has given it to you Hallelujah you are restored amen and God has got the 5old Ministry to restore you God bless you amen I I have time oh okay God bless you praise the Lord hallelujah the Lord has restored everything to you Hallelujah the Lord has restored justification don't let the devil tell you that you are not justified you are the Holiness has been restored to you don't look at your symptoms look at what the Lord has done for you and just accept it with all of your heart and you see the fruit of the spirit manifesting in your life the gift of the church N4 Ministry N4 gift that the devil took from the church healing praying speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues word of knowledge and so on and so the Lord has resorted back to the church is part of what the Lord did for us amen sometime when you go to certain Mage Church they don't accept the gift they said the gift is for Pentecostal we are Pentecostal the day of Pentecost is when the church began so we are the original Pentecost amen so whenever there's a day of Pentecost the Lord restores what happened in the first Pentecost amen so the gift the healing is part of the ministry is part of you whatever you are sick of whatever you are suffering from the Lord has God restoration for you amen GL sometime even the medication that we have they do one good here they do many 10 evils in another places because it's what man made but what the Lord has made is perfect amen only we should rise up and by faith receive whatever the Lord has for us Glory Hallelujah to to the Lord if the enemy has taken your family from you taking your son your daughter your husband your wife and they running around the Lord has them restored for you it's already in your heart amen the root is in your heart which is the Holy Ghost baptism that is what you need amen restoration is not complete without the Holy Ghost baptism all right if I restore to justification is Holy is good if I restore to Holy living but the real restoration is the man Jesus Christ in your heart Hallelujah which is Christ in you the hope of glory GL and not just the hope of glory but the real expression of Glory in real time in your skin amen God want to be be in your skin Christ was eternity and Jesus was the flesh but the flesh of Jesus is not here but you are the morning Day Jesus you are the flesh that Christ want to dwell in and bring restoration God bless you and I'll make a way I'm just a PL man I'll let real preachers come and do their thing God bless you amen so I'll call the next preacher Amen brother Mark God bless you [Applause] glory that was a little click quick I thought a little more time to prepare right wow praise the Lord amen let's get started so the Locust so I look the word up what the Locust is is devour every green thing and when they migrate that fly an immense Cloud devour every green thing look in the spiritual sense the Locust like wants to come in your life and devour everything that it can amen and so our Locust is a a grasshopper it's it's like a short horn grasshopper in the same family so let's take it's Tak in Deuteronomy 28:15 and 42 but it shall come to pass if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all the curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee and then verse 42 says all the trees and fruit of thy land shall the Locust consume so we see that God has given a certain commandment if you follow my word right and if you don't follow my word these things will happen to you so the same thing we see I will restore sayth the Lord all these things happen in the church ages because they went away from following the Lord's commandments so the same thing can still happen to us today if we don't follow the Lord's word so we don't want these things to devour our spiritual walk with Christ so we got to be sober and be vigilant so now and in John 10:10 it says the thief cometh not to but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am coming I have life I have it more abundantly so we see what the devil's tactics are is to steal kill and destroy if he can steal the word away from you then you will die spiritually so we got to be we got make sure we're looking this let's go to uh 1957 I will restore now the next great thing come up was the Locust we're going to see what the Locust job is and was one to destroy the unity of the Believers so his the the enemy's job is show the unity amongst the brothers and sisters of Christ takes the unity away from us how can God move in miraculous ways how can God uh give us the things that we desire in our church desire in our spiritual life because if I can't get along with you one another how I'm going to get along in heaven with everybody cuz in heaven is going to be perfect Unity not one ISM not one Schism so we got to take isms and schisms out the Church of God you may like chicken I may like pork but we still got to be able to love one another a a suit a suit coat and a overall should be able to hug one another amen let's keep it going these people with one heart one Accord so we see in the book of Acts they were one heart one Accord they have differences but they still with one heart one Accord right I believe in Romans chapter 8 it says the love of God nothing SE separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus so nothing should separate us not one thing amen so we see the job of the Locust is destroy the unity so the enemy came in and begin to take slowly take the unity away from the Believers and and and the fellowship and all these other things we can talk about let's go and uh I will restore 1957 but the think that old Locust what it done and then another thing that it had back in the Bible times now besides Brotherhood perfect Brotherhood no notice that word perfect Brotherhood amen perfect Unity they had a worship of one true God and it's too bad that we got away from that I think we've gotten so busy in this day and age that we forget to connect with one another and I remember our brother brandom said back in the day man when a brother and sister when sisters would see each other and brothers see they would cry when they had to leave one another that's that perfect unity and if I can have Unity with you how must have Unity with Christ I treat my we got to treat each other the same way we treat Christ cuz if I treat you bad I'm treating Christ bad just simple as that amen amen now now listen close whatever happened in the first place with the insect of the perar wor and just became a caterpillar and the caliper became a locust and whatever it was started in the beginning is still the same thing that's causing the trouble today so think about that we have all these denominations because one person took an idea and and went with this idea another person took this idea and the call all is disunity I looked uh the statistics I think there over 30,000 denominate Christian denominations in the world today and brother Bram said in the 60s was 900 so do the math on that how many more there is so we have all these isms and schisms amongst so-called Christian Believers but they all say we in the word of God but they took one thought and went away with it and it caused Unity amongst the the bride of Christ and God didn't intend for his family to be unify in fact his plan was to get everybody together under the same headship under the same God but they've taken uh what they thought is God and ran with it and and God is a million miles away from that amen no wonder why we can't have healing campaigns the churches are tore up no wonder one will say oh this and that other so disagree no wonder there's such isms Among Us is because we can't bear the real fruits of patience longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness the lifeline has been cut off from the tree and we're never to bring it up through Creeds of some rag or any other substitute it bark it'll take power of almighty God to grow that tree back to condition again and so we see in the message there's disunity we got one person believing this Doctrine one this Doctrine the prophet didn't come for us to be disunified he came to point us back to Christ and if we really follow what the message says we're going to be unified with Christ and we should all be together building one another because if my body goes this way and that way I'm not going to be able to go the way I need to go I got to walk straight just like this not left and right at the same time and the same thing with Christ I need my hand I need my toes I need my arms so we need one another to be a functioning body we want God do all these things in our life personally but are we making sure we're being unified with our brothers and sisters that's what God is looking for if we can just be like a building has to be perfectly built from the foundation up amen let's keep it going so then during the Dark Age they come forth with an organization they come forth a man-made policy the Locust begin to fly then the same devil that broke up Brotherhood is trying to break up the unity of man so the devil's trying to get into our church and he wants to use any and anybody he can to cause this unity and we got to make sure that we can recognize that know your enemy how he works because he used the same tactics he did in the Garden of Eden is using the same tactics today and you got to think about this that the enemy knows your weaknesses and your strengths so don't leave your guard down you got to make don't be make yourself vulnerable that he can come in and and and use something in your life and don't let anything get in the way of your walk with God don't let anything I don't care job I don't care your family I don't care what it is you safeguard that walk cuz if you safeguard that walk you can defeat any and anything the enemy throws at you because you're hid in Christ amen amen so let's go from go to 1962 the restoration of the Bride tree this little fellow died out and became a locust that was the next stage was a locust now what does a locust do a locust eats the leaves that's right a locust takes unto the leaves when with the Paw worm left he left the leaves he eat all the fruit of the tree then what he took in the Locust came to eat what the pal wor left now what did he do what did this pal word do destroy the leaves that's what the leaves for destroying Define fellowship so if he can destroy Divine Fellowship then we can't have the promises of God that we're Desiring because we got to have that perfect fellowship with God but God is looking how how can we uh interact with others if a brother and sister does something to you are you going to hold a grudge CU I know my I know my Bible says that he's not going to forgive your trespasses unless you forgive another person's trespasses so I think I think the key is we don't uh emphasize forgiveness cuz God won't even hear our prayer for not willing to forgive somebody it's like that Parable Jesus talking about that man that uh he owed a certain debt to his Lord and uh the Lord was going to throw him in jail but uh he begged and pleed with them for Grace see we're so easy to ask for Grace but we're not willing to give Grace to somebody else see we want it much as a possible we're not willing to dish it out so we got be willing to dish out Grace to somebody else we're all humans we have mistakes we do all these things we're not perfect I make mistakes but the thing is don't make the same mistake over and over and over again just like it's like we're repentance we we repent to God but we go back through the same thing again how we expect God to to honor or bless and to restore us so we got to make sure we're get back in step of true repentance we got to make sure we're in step of that amen but the Bible said that we're able or uh we we are to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places look at that together oh my what all like well I tell you what this will do it'll make a pair of overalls in a tuxedo suit pair their arms around one another and call each other brothers sure it'll make an old Calico dress put her arms around a silk stained one and say sister how are you this morning praise God that's right it'll uh it will it's joy peace love Faith and the word of longsuffering gentleness patience set down in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus cool off a little see what those leaves would did so we got to get back to the basics get back to how the Church of how God started his church and we see how he started I'm not saying we got to sell everything and you know do that but the thing is get back to the spirit of unity and it's something you got to strive for it's not something that's going to just fall in your platter cuz brother Brandon said this statement he he uh talking about the church in Jeffersonville how he loved the unity and all these things and the gifts were just flowing together but he said be aware that the enemy does not want to see that he said you got to fight to keep the unity so it's each one of us it we all have a job and responsibility to do to keep the unity I don't care what this brother did to this sister did to you make peace with it because if you don't make peace with you going to you're going to hurt and hinder our church from getting blessings so and I believe the prop he preached Unity on a daily basis you got to keep the unity amen so this in closing be careful be sober be vigilant look out for the devil cuz he's going to throw everything he can because he knows his his work is short so he's going to do every and anything to get you off track so stay in the word of God stay in prayer stay in the message of the hour these three things will keep Unity not only in the church but in your family and in your life amen praise God [Applause] amen amen amen God bless you all we'll get right into it uh so the next evolution in this uh brother Brandon referred to as a life stealing beetle one Wicked spirit that came in four purposes and the next uh evolution is is uh the canker worm and so I looked up online the definition of a canker and it said a destruct destructive fungal disease of apple and other trees that results in damage to the bark and it's important to remember the word bark it also says an ulcerous condition or disease of a human or animal and the definition of ulcer is an open sore or an external or internal surface of the body caused by breaking the skin or mucous membrane that fails to heal so this thing is not healing back and healing is the children's bread so that's something that God has always focused back so when he sees something that's not healing back he he there there there's a question there right so and then they had another definition here and um it says a moral blemish this is an ulcer a moral blemish or corrupting influence and the example sentence that they G that they gave here this is from Oxford dictionary is he's a man with an incurable ulcer called gambling so we haven't read the Bible we haven't reached out to the prophet but man itself knows from a spiritual standpoint that uh uh you can be corrupted spiritually you can have spiritual issues uh uh not just focused because a lot of times when we think about uler we tend to just think physical things and a lot of people they talk about problems they talk about oh yeah you know sick in your body I'm feeling like I'm feeling this and this and that sometimes it's spiritual issues the prophet there was a woman that went to the prophet prophet and she had paid the psychiatrist to tell because she was going through some issues and she went down to the prophet and the prophet said hey is your life right she said yeah I'm a Sunday school teacher brother Brown said yeah okay and he kept looking and he says I see you in the car with a blond head boy and she said don't you tell nobody about that see she thought it was a physical problem but the prophet was able to look past that to see a blemish or a corruption he said you got to make that thing right or that devil will stay right there right amen so the prophet said that the cankerworm is the one that gets into the bark and destroys the covering the bark is the covering it's your covering right in the restoration of the uh of the uh brid tree uh paragraph 234 uh the prophet says but the third stage of him was a cankerworm h that's got a bad name to start with the cankerworm what does a cankerworm do it gets into the bark that's the lifeline there yes Sarah gets into the bark and it destroys the covering of the tree the covering what is religion covering that's what the word religion means a covering and I have to admit when in my early stages of a Christian I used to go with this saying that said um I don't believe in religion but relationship and I did I did I did some uh I did a search online and it says that uh there's a phrase that the Evangelical Protestants say which is a denomination that says Christianity isn't a religion it's a relationship and I remember that early on in my early on in my Christian walk there was this guy that had made a video on YouTube that says I hate religion but I love Jesus Christ but you always have to look behind the spirit of things right you can't just look at you can't just look at the physical side of it if the prophet would have just stayed looking at her physical condition he would have never got down to the issue so you have to look at the Spirit behind the behind that thing right so religion is not an evil thing right religion can nether be good or bad wow it can be used for good or bad and in fact you have to have a religion in order to have a relationship with Christ first right Israel Israel so people think denominations is started during the time of the pro no the children of Israel their covering was Moses right Moses was their covering Moses was the word of the day Moses was the representation of Christ for them which is a covering and they want there is one time they said we don't want to hear from you Moses we want to hear from God directly see they thought God was going to come and talk to them as a buddy buddy so now notice that request wasn't bad because God wants to restore us cuz there's no there's no going to be any more preaching and stuff in heaven right uh when Jesus uh descended down to Hell and he preached to the lost souls that doesn't happen to Believers in heaven there'll be no more preaching in heaven right but the israels Israel was looking for a restoration out of season right right they were still living in sin the blood had not been shed in order for them to be able to approach God so when the voice came out of Heaven he said okay y'all want me to talk to you the voice came out of Heaven they thought that they were getting a buddy but God was calling out sin right they lost their covering God was calling out sin and they said okay no no no let Moses talk to us so there's a way that you have to have in order to approach God and have a have a relationship with God right so the prophet referred to religion as Doctrine right Doctrine is the law it's the word so you can't have a relationship with God without Doctrine amen and we're going to prove this scripturally as we turn to Genesis 39-11 we're going to prove you can't have a relationship with God without Doctrine without law and it says here and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat so we see right here that Adam was in a state before that he had a covering that he didn't realize he was right he didn't understand what sin was but when they had made a choice now this covering is off and now God is coming to them and telling them who told you you were naked right I hid you from that there was a covering and I want you to know cuz a lot of times people people would say oh uh you know um I I don't tell lies because I don't want to go to hell or they say uh you know being a Christian is hard you have to understand the covering that God gave them which was the doctrine he made them that way so living the word is natural you're not just trying to follow it just to get to a a specific situation no the word is who you are right that's where you find peace that's where you find Joy that's where you find Love by living the word you're not following the rule book God made Adam with that covering amen right Adam was Adam wasn't trying to put that covering on himself God made him with that covering right yeah right so so even in the even in the garden Adam Eve they both had a covering and what this cover did was it produced a Godly innocence right It produced a Godly innocence and um I want to say I I'll say a testimony right now because um at my job see I don't tell people that I'm a Christian right and it's okay to do it if you tell people you're a Christian that's fine as long as you have a life behind it the prophet said that you can shout and you can jump that's all that's all fine and well but if you ain't got no life behind it it doesn't mean anything so if you come to church if you shout if you don't shout it's fine as long as you're going out and there's a life behind it that people can identify with right so I never said that I was a Christian and this one of my co-workers she asked me well do you drink and I know it always comes down to The Showdown to show who you are so I know those questions come up and she said well do you drink I said no I don't drink I'm a Christian and she said oh wow really and so she said I was wondering because when they curse and stuff I don't curse with them right she was she said oh wow I she said no wonder no wonder the uh um because because of the way I was acting she was like no wonder because of the way that I was acting was it was a it was producing a Godly innocence by submitting to the word now if you would looked at Quinton Jr 10 years ago in college I was cursing up a storm right right I was cursing up a storm but when the man Jesus Christ came on the scene and put a covering on you know what she said she said oh wow that's sweet it produces an innocence not your innocence but a Godly innocence right produces a Godly innocence amen right so this cover this covering which is a h is a is a Doctrine now now what the cankerworm is trying to do he's now trying to replace this he comes to destroy the bark uh and and the prophet says he replaces it with dogmas or Creeds just like Adam he came and destroyed the covering that was on Adam and in Adam all of a sudden now he's putting on fig leaves now I want you to realize that those fig leaves were natural process the covering that God put Adam on he was a spoken word they weren't born by sex it was a spoken word it was a spiritual covering and now Adam is trying to put on a natural covering no wonder God had to reject it right no wonder God had to reject it right and um one of the Creeds uh if you read in the message the restoration of the Bride tree one of the Creeds that um that he talked about that the um that the enemy trying to replace was baptism in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost right now that's a problem that a lot of message Believers especially if you're born in the message you may not have it because uh you weren't born in that denominational time to be transitioned but it's important to understand the significance of why we do this thing right just so if you meet someone on your Trail if someone is in denomination you can explain it to them but so that you also have an understanding of the word for yourself right so now the problem with this Creed right this covering because uh baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is a covering right it's doctrin and it's a covering for us now the problem with this Creed is that it takes away the name right it takes away the name because power lies in the name right not in titles right so you see how dangerous this can this cankerworm can be if he can take away the name of Jesus from a Believer you have no power I don't care how you're living I don't care how much you're going to church you have no power G power has always been in the name first right so praise God right so when Eve was tempted uh what did she do first we're going to turn to Genesis 323 when Eve was tempted right it says uh we'll just read I'll just read from ver one it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast in the field which the Lord had made he said unto the woman yay God ha God said ye shall not eat of any tree now notice what she said and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the tree we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the tree of the fruit which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of neither shall you touch it least you die now that should have setted it right there because that was the word of God and the prophet said when you speak the word of God to the enemy that is finished he's defeat the word will defeat the enemy under any condition any circumstance I don't care what it looks like the word will defeat the enemy right but it didn't do it in this case right it didn't do it in this case right so we have to realize uh then another important thing to realize here is she didn't have a name here it just said woman right because she was taken from Adam her identity was in Adam right right so she didn't have a name her name was with Adam right and that's where a lot of her power was because she was approaching she was approaching the serpent without her husband without a name right Satan's not going to fear nothing like that even though it be word right even though it be word right so um right so we're going to look at the uh uh if we look over at the New Testament there was a uh there was a scripture in the New Testament where they these guys saw Paul casting out these demons and then they tried to go and then cast out demons and the demons testified themselves they said Jesus Christ we know head first name first Paul we know right now you have to realize you say well that's Paul's name no Paul was Saul God changed his name to Paul brother Jesus we know Paul we know but who are you who are you it was a body without a head trying to operate Satan's not afraid of that Satan's not afraid of that right Satan is not afraid of that you have to have a name so that's why when we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's power behind in the name of Jesus Christ we we approach everything in the name of Jesus Christ and when and when we have the word of God when we have the of Jesus Christ first then the demons tremble otherwise they will not and the word literally the Lord the word shows you that the demons weren't afraid of the word without a head right they weren't afraid of the word without a head because you have to understand that people that believe in the father Son and the Holy Ghost it's in the word come on it's not something that's outside of the word right a lot of other doctrines like the Apostles Creed you won't find that in the word um people's you know another another of the dogmas that they tried to replace was uh um uh joining the church by a handshake you don't find none of that in the word but you'll find Father Son and the Holy Ghost in the word but you need a head in order to reveal to you what that means and where the power is first and now you have something right yeah so the canker worm's purpose was to take away the covering and replace it with dogmas and we're going to turn to uh Genesis 35-7 and do do do a little bit do do some more reading just to show you uh this covering and it says for God doth know that the day you eat thereof that then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the tree took of the fruit and thereof and uh gave to her husband with her and he did and he did eat and the eyes of them were uh eyes of them both were opened right and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so God had a covering not just on the eyes he had a covering on the ears a spiritual covering on the eyes and the ears right uh uh um in order for them to withstand the test and as soon as they fail they tried to fix the situation themselves and that's the nature of man when man falls and makes makes a mistake they try to do things themselves so you know sometimes if you if you are um if you were um if you did somebody wrong right or you may have you may have said something wrong to somebody and then it's like okay well I'll just go buy him ice cream just to kind of make things better no that's a covering right you need to go back and tell them hey I'm sorry for doing this thing and then give them the ice cream right you can't patch it up and that's the that's the problem with human beings is when we try to fix the situation we try to patch it up to make ourselves look good and then it just comes off as a self-righteousness because the prophet when the prophet saw that that uh uh that vision of her he said he he said it was way down in her subconscious she had hit it way down in her subconscious to the point where she didn't know that was the issue so man tries to patch things up God comes down and says no no no no no this is the problem and I want you to know that we're speaking about restoration because the lamb that God slayed for Adam and Eve it was a temporary lamb right the Bible says the uh the blood of bull and goats won't satisfy but it was a temporary covering so this restoration that we're looking for God's looking to restore us back spiritually those spiritual eyes that Adam and Eve had that they didn't know that they were naked God is God is uh is recovering that's why when the Bible says when a man sees a a naked woman on the street he'll turn his head amen because there's an innocence there they don't know about that stuff and that's why the world when so when you saying that you're a Christian right and partake upon the things of the world you're looking at naked women or all those kinds of things it shows there's something wrong but they want they want the relationship without religion just like the children of Israel did but God's looking to to restore back our covering right God's looking to store back our covering um uh brother um in the the first fruit that was lost was the uh the uh the fruits of Joy love peace and then we talk about fellowship and now the doctrine has been lost and repaced God wants us to give back our innocence because when we have innocence it that innocence is actually what makes God do things right so I remember one time uh I was just upset at work but then I saw some kid come inside there and I saw them smiling in your Dem meor just changes innocence does something to you no matter how you're feeling and so when you're looking for God for innocence when you're looking for healing when you have the covering of Innocence on on you and you say Lord I'm sick I don't know what to do Lord help me that innocence will cause God to come down on the scene right praise God Amen so we'll take the next person GL to God God bless you all what the cankerworm eaten that which is the Lord will restore what the canor left the caterpillar came and ate and uh Church the caterpillar very interestingly see after the same insect the prophet says it's the same bug but different forms and you see it's started off with the leaf with the fellowship and it started off with the with the doctrine taking that away and then it started off by going to the very bark of the tree and then it goes to take the very uh the the the very covering of what that tree stands for but this caterpillar comes now and and and all that is left after all that's been eaten is just a stump and that's all that's left it goes and takes the very life out of the tree and nothing else is left just the stump you see but but there was something in that stump that God put before the foundation of the Earth can I say Amen somebody before the foundation God placed something in there you see if that insect continue eating it would have to be converted cuz there was a seed on the inside and that seed had a life and that life had a promise and that promise had to come to pass I will restore is that right and what was the original resur restoration see in the in the in the garden of Eve when God created man God said let us make man in our own image is that right and when he made man God had a desire to reproduce himself he put man and he says I will put man and there's something he says interestingly here in Genesis one Genesis uh 2:7 actually it says and the Lord formed God then the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostril the breath of life and he made this man to become a living so and he planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man who he had formed and the Lord God took the man and he put him in the garden he says to dress it and to keep it you see the man was in a position of Dominion in Genesis 1 127 he says that he created man in his own image and he says let them have dominion over all the fish of the sea over the foul of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over all creeping things upon the Earth God had a desire for man to rule for man to recognize his position of authority his position in dominion and the prophet says there was threefold purpose of God res restoring it was God it was Christ being manifested in flesh it was God so that he could have the preeminence in the church and it was to restore back to Ed in condition before before Eve ate that fruit there was a perfect Fellowship in Eden there was a Dominion there in Eden and you see as this caterpillar continues to eat and eat and eat there was a position that was lost the identity of that tree begin to become compromised you see so there you have a tree that has no power a tree that has no Dominion No Authority now the prophet goes on to say here in the message of restoration of the brid tree he says the fourth stage now as a caterpillar he sucks the life that's what he does it goes right down to the pope and goes to sucking caterpillar here he is who we going to call him denomination that's the guy's right name and you see when you denominate the Bible uh the prophet says that you destroy the works of God right there when you start to denominate you form yourself a a form of creed or dogmas that's when Christ has to exit because there is no place for him to have his habitation you see but I can think of it like job right when God had a challenge to the devil and told hey you can go ahead and touch job and he can go ahead and take everything he has take all of his substances all of his possessions but don't you just touch his life you see with that caterpillar that life that he was eating there was somewhere that life came from brother brenon preach the message what is life the life some people might regard life as as as a good time some people regard life as as as as pleasure or or or regard life as how much you have at the bank you see but job had a revelation the life that he had was that he knew who he was he knew what God made him to be as a Son of God you see so when his wife came and said why don't you curse God you see job says um shall we so shall we only enjoy good things you see job had a revelation of what life was and he got to a place he said says I know my redeemer lives you see when he can say I know that was a representation of that seed that was in him that could speak that life is that right praise God now I want to read this quote here the prophet says he says God's going to raise up people who believes in signs and wonders going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the rushing Mighty Wind comes it gives right into it and frolics and dances and glorifies God hallelujah green leaves are clapping hands and having a wonderful time what a Frolic that little undergrowth was having but that big old tree standing there just moaning and groaning same wind look that same wind was making one moan and groan was giving the other one a big time and I happen to think well what's the one what's this one doing and every time that little tree would twist and what would it do it would pull the roots loosen up the grounds that's right so it could grow deeper and get a deeper hold Hallelujah and every time God sends his blessings upon a born again man or woman it only loosens up the roots to grow deeper higher better Freer glorify God but I will restore and I want to say this when God restores church he restores what better is that right when he rest he restores with better you see I remember when Joel when he lost everything he had he had more on his latter end than he did when he started is that right Joseph was in a prison where he was where he God placed him there for a specific specific purpose but when it came time for his restoration there was a pharaoh that placed him in a position of dominion right it placed him in a position so that he was above all the palace there was three Hebrew boys that was in the fire but when they got out the fire there was a a promise waiting for them or rather a promotion waiting for them when they were restored there was a declaration by the king that they would be respected among all nations that who don't ever serve their gods will be cut into pieces is that right when God restores church he restores with better so in this season of restoration I say expect God to give you better expect God to give you more expect God to give you double because God doesn't take away God doesn't subtract God multiplies God adds and God desires for you to be in a position of dominion this morning praise the Lord and the restoration of the brid tree the prophet says all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop no communism Catholic Catholicism nothing else will will ever stop it I will restore said the Lord all the man-made Roman trees will never hang there all the graves will never keep it there all the big denominational Stones laying at the door will never keep it

is you praise the Lord GL amen GL [Applause] GL amen hard to come behind them fellas right the sweating glory to God Amen and since I'm last I turn my time off Amen brother but I want to go back to Joel and pick up a few things in the scripture there all right amen I want to uh go back and look at uh Joel chapter one all right cuz it's important that we pick something up there that I that I want to just kind of bring out Joel 1 says the word of the Lord amen came to Joel right so whose word was it word the word of the Lord this was not Joel right the word of the Lord came to Joel and said that which the palmerworm hath left the Locust have eaten and that which the Locust have left the cankerworm have eaten that which the ker worm has left the caterpillar has eaten and I want you to go on over here in the same chapter there to the 10th verse he said the field is wasted the land is mourneth the corn is wasted the the new wine is dried up wow the oil languish okay and in verse 11 he says be ye ashamed now he's telling them to be ashamed at this point because of the things that are going on and and and and and whatever more then verse 12 he say the vine is dried up amen you see what these brothers were talking about he said what happened in there with these things are beginning all the way down to the stump the vine was dried up and there was no more life going into the tree cuz the vine had dried up right amen so if we go on over here Amen to the second chapter Amen in the 25th verse he say I will who will Who speaking here the Lord not Joel the word of the Lord came to Joel saying I I personal pronoun will restore to you the years that the Locust and has eaten and the CER worm has eaten and the caterpillar has eaten and the Palmer worm and the great Army which I sing among you now listen now and ye shall eat Amen in plenty amen amen ye shall eat in plenty that's one thing first of all you shall eat in plenty and two be satisfied amen and three praise the name of the Lord your God Amen so the restoration amen is first of all we're going to have to restore amen the life all right amen and what happened here we see uh uh Joel if we go on over here to Luke amen Luke [Applause] 24 amen Luke 24 goes on and says uh uh uh the opening and I'm skipping some called of lack of time amen and he took and he eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet that with you and these things must be fulfilled which are written by the laws of Moses and the prophets now let me slow down a little bit cuz I'm getting a little winded here Brothers got me all turned up back there they got me by 20 something years take your time I want to explain what was going on it was Jesus revealing himself Amen to the disciples all right amen and he said then open he their understanding yeah that they might understand the scripture amen that they might understand the scripture and then if we go on down it says and 47 Luke Luke Luke Luke 2447 and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached right brother Quinton said what in his name among the Nations beginning in Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send you the promise of my father what promise I will restore amen he say what go ter in Jerusalem amen until ye been endued with power from on high amen what is it amen the being restored amen now you have to go into the upper room and te there amen when the life begins to hit you you will produce amen again the tree will begin to sprout again now these things happen let's go on over here to acts amen we're talking about a restoration amen these brothers here was talking about the canker worm and the Palmer worm and the caterpillar and the Lo amen but he promised he made us a promise that there will be a restoration amen there will be a restoration why cuz he said in Jeremiah amen the thir chapter therefore with loving kindness I draw amen amen it's nothing you doing you going to be drawn to it amen amen Romans 8:29 and 30 say say for whom he did for no also he also predestinated to be what conform to the image of God Amen it was in you before the foundation of the world Amen that life amen see to be restored to something you had to be fallen from something you can't the word restored amen brings to be redeemed Amen to be brought back Amen to its original condition amen so if he said that I will restore what is he restoring that tree now he talks about the original image now an image amen that image that he saw in his mind way back before the foundation of the world he saw an image amen and it was brought amen into a reality amen and to this Fifth Dimension amen and he said I will restore amen all that the Kink of worm and the Palmer worm and the caterpillar as destroyed glory amen we go over here to acts Peter said they was theread the day of Pentecost I heard a brother mention the day of Pentecost amen but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem but this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as ye suppose seeing it but amen the third hour of the day come on but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel but the prophet Joel got it from the Lord this wasn't Joel's promise brother this was that that was spoken by Joel but it came from the Lord amen he says this is that amen and it shall come to pass in the last days sayith God I will pour out my spirit oh yes upon All Flesh to your sons and your daughters shall prophesy side young men shall see visions and the old men shall dream dreams amen so what we see at this point here amen the tree was was burden

take away all of these things that was established there by Paul amen but I want you to understand something here amen came on down a prophet amen the tree began to put forth his buds again all right these things begin to happen amen through through through through through through uh uhh Luther yeah and Wesley yeah amen the Pentecost right but see the prophet made a comment here he went to go visit the old Infidel uhhuh he went to go visit the old Infidel yeah they wanted to do some squirrel hunting yeah so the man had to his friend with him say stay in the car this fell here is a little strange yeah but he he he went to the man and said can we do some squirrel hunting on your land yeah that's right tell it had to do some squirrel want to do some Square hunt so the man go on and say you done got that bad you got to carry a preacher around with you yeah so brother brandom sitting in the car something made him G said about that time I feel I better get out the car and he walked down in Inspiration just hit it talking to the to the to the fellow you know I don't you know you know you know I'm an Infidel he said I wouldn't be so proud about that that's right that's right and he looked down and he seen the apples on the ground picked up the old apples he said man need some pretty you got here and he says listen now he said if you tell me uhh what intelligence what intelligence to cause the sou to go down into the roots of that tree during the winter see it had to be an intelligence amen that intelligence went down into the roots of that tree to do what to protect the tree Amen to protect the life amen so what happened here amen if we move on down in 1963 I think it was brother Quenton he said it had you can't have a b a headless body right so in 1963 what the head produced itself amen over over over in Arizona what was it it was the intelligence amen coming back Amen to the body all right amen all right so without the intelligence he the first thing that had to be restored amen was the word because see here it said that they shall do what they shall eat amen plenty yes and be satisfied see before then we we were eating plenty but we wasn't satisfied we were eating plenty of dogs we were eating plenty of ceds Amen but that wouldn't satisfy true belever yes brother we needed the intelligence Amen to come back amen and through a prophet amen begin to to to expose the lies of Satan he came back and he preached amen he preached against HH H immoral living yes he preached against modesty he preached old modesty against short pants amen H skirts he preached against makeup he preached against earrings he preached against all these things and the people thought he was just a mad man they begin to say that he had a thing against women no he was trying to call and cut off amen cuz he know a restoration had to happen amen for what was happening you had picked up all of these parasites amen and all of these different things amen that water the tree down we didn't even know what real Christianity was we didn't even know what real Holiness was Amen in the the day of Pentecost amen the gifts came back amen they had a little Holiness amen we saw the dresses get longer amen we saw theh the th coming back to the word of God but they did not have the intelligence yet you cannot have a complete restoration amen without the intelligence why because you'll fall right back into the same things amen I want you to understand that it says here that the in in Luke remember what he said they began to understand all right they begin to understand God had to First amen Jesus first had to prove to them amen that it was him supernaturally amen he came through the wall touch here eat the honey con it was a supernatural Revelation revealing of himself all right amen and did he said go there amen and I'll meet you there he said they would be in at in one place uhhuh and in one Accord amen and I'll meet you there amen and the Holy Ghost came down amen and tongues of fire on each and every one of them what was it amen the life amen into the body again hey M I'll give you a little story here there was a a woman amen she wanted a a a dining room set she asked her husband let's go out and buy this dining room set because I want to be able to entertain and have people over for dinner amen and so uh uh they went out to this store very fine fine store amen and she walked and walked and and picked up the furniture picked out the best one she could find amen but the thing of this is each chair amen was a little bit different each chair had its own characteristic amen but it was but it was made all together different all of the carvings on the one was different all of the carvings on that one was different from the other amen and they brought it home amen and they had a real good time on that table amen they sat at that table amen and they ate the meal oh man that was prepared for them amen they ate plenty and was satisfied amen the children sat at that table and maybe did their homework amen maybe there was many discussions going across that table amen that table served them well but after a while what happened amen they begin to get tired of that old table amen so they took that table and went out and they bought another table maybe a little glass and Brass amen and they said was real pretty amen this look good because it glows and it Glitters amen so they took that old table in them chairs and they moved them to another section maybe set it out in the garage amen and then they ran out of room in the garage and maybe they took the one chair and sat it outside man Sat one on the porch amen it and over the years amen through the wear and tail the screws begin to get a little bit loose amen man the the chair the cushions get worn in amen a little discoloration happened to the chair amen so when trying to prepare this chair amen they come back and they do it with denominational decrees say well I take a little paint and I paint over the blemishes I paint over the scratches right I'll paint over this flaw all right and try to bring this chair back all right amen but that wouldn't do it amen they put it out and the chair was exposed Amen to the elements of the world Amen and it begin to wither and it begin to get destroyed all right amen but one day what happened amen Jesus amen the great Carpenter son amen came back and said I'm going to restore this amen back to its original condition so in order to restore the chairs amen each chair individually Amen to be put positionally in their place the first thing he had to do was take some stripper and he had to put the stripper all over the chair what happened to strip down the old paint amen that covered up the blemishes amen strip it down and after they he got through stripping it with the old chemical amen he came back amen with some 30 grit sandpaper and he had the sand and sand and until smooth finish amen till it was a smooth finish amen then he had to take amen the look get into the grooves get all into the fine grooves see to restore this thing to its original condition you can't just cover up sin amen you got it's got to come out amen you got to buff it out amen you got to go through something amen it might hurt oh what are you doing destroying the chest no I'm bringing it back to his original condition amen so he worked with this chair and he and he varnished it and he stripped it out he sanded down until it was just perfect amen and then he come back amen and he got the original wood grain to show through and he put a seal on and he put a seal on oh this is going to protect the chair amen whereby we are sealed to the day of our Redemption amen it's going to protect you you are a son amen you always been a son amen so now he put it he take the the chair he take the table and he move out the O ISM the old cre the old denomination and he put it back in its place he put it back in his place he put each chair you go here he put this chair over here he put this chair over here why cuz that was his place and ain't nobody can take your place nobody can take your place we put it back in the function put it back in the use and what happened again oh we brought this back it's beautiful now we can sit eat plenty and be satisfied you see one thing about eating when you're hungry nothing else will do amen you ever tried to lay down and rest when you're hungry it just don't work I can't get comfortable I got to go get something to eat cuz see after they ate and was satisfied now you can restall now you can find rest in Jes Jesus am see we had to restore the word and we had a Prophet come Amen to F the cupers amen and he stored it in books and the tapes amen that we can be satisfied eat plenty be satisfied and praise our God amen [Applause] amen I shall restore amen all that the Kink of worm the Palmer worm the Locust and the caterpillar whatever's going on in your life amen I know sometime things hurt amen and some of your worst hurts I'mma tell you something and and I I'll say that but that's it's almost not really true there's some terrible hurts go on in the world but see what the devil does he'll magnify the things in the church oh this person did this oh this person did this it's just being you just being sanded you just being sanded down see in in in the in the in the adoption message the prophet said this right here the first thing I'm talking about the places he said your adoption is your places the first thing you have to do is put out of your mind of falling away all right I'll Never Fall Away even though I get wounded I won't go back I won't go back you got to be like a tree planted by the rivers of running water and I shall not be moved that's the tree we talking about amen your roots will never go away amen you might be wounded you might get a Shak and the winds may blow but your roots will go down deeper it's just God sanding you sanding you to a smooth finish see a little blemish oh I got to sand it some more take away all the old paint take away the elements of the world the things that done stuck to you amen the abuse that the ched done went through amen it was throw around sat outside just wasn't taking good care of but I got you let me send you and bring you back bring you back and put you in the Master's service thank you Jesus amen God bless you all God bless you all praise the Lord I'm not preaching I don't have nothing to say after all this I tell you I think we ate in plenty and I hope you satisfied um thank God for each of our brothers um and and I was looking at my watch I'm like y'all y'all can still keep going a little bit longer but uh each one just kind of came in their own very unique way and just to see how the Holy Ghost just tied these thoughts all together um just um I'm I'm sitting here just blown away by by how God does things and um um there was a a lot being said in a very short amount of time and uh but there was enough being said where I think if you're spiritual you can catch what God is trying to do uh one of the things that you know and I haven't even gotten to this part in my whole series um on uh on restoration but um restoration kind of happens in a natural form and brother brother quu was kind of saying that take this personal I'll restore to you that's personal I restore it to you right all the years that the the the Locust and the cankerworm the Palmer worm the the caterpillar all everything they eat I'll restore to you so there's a natural part to this restoration and then there's also a spiritual part part to the restoration and the reason that we are in a message church is because God made a promise that he would restore all and brother brother Troy walked us right through even the seals right he told us about the four horse riders the the black the the White Horse the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse that was something that happened during the church ages right so all that was taken as this denominations brother Mark said 30,000 I think it's up to 45,000 something like that but all that God said he had to restore that that's why we are in a message church because we're part of the restoration and let me tell you something you couldn't help yourself like brother tro say we was in denominations I know I come from it come from the Baptist Church but we were in there and we were eating but we were not satisfied when they taught us about uh one of the brothers got to talking about um uh what happened in the Garden of Eden when they told us that it was an apple something inside of us say something ain't right about that a apple you sure and they come out with their Sunday school lessons yeah this what it was and in our in our hearts we're like this cannot be right I don't know what this is but when a prophet came and told us what really happened in the Garden of Eden this is that we know that this was the truth praise the Lord like brother and even baptism couldn't get that right but brother brother brother Quinton show let us know if your baptism is in titles you have no power amen and why is it that people um especially when a demon attacking them man they in the name of Jesus why don't you say in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost why you don't use that when when you being attacked by a devil you realize ain't no power in titles but there's power in the name of Jesus and if you can cast out Devils or try to cast out devils in the name of Jesus then you should be able to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I tell you the truth we we we just appreciate the inspiration that God has given the church for the year and you know I was I'm going say this I'm I'm going try to get out of here this this is a this is a warm spot right now but you know restoration brother Quinton told us a few weeks ago that restoration just been something that's been on God's mind even brother Jerry I love the way he brought that uh that uh there was a three-fold purpose that God had he wanted to reveal himself to his people brother brandom says he wanted to reveal himself to his people then he wanted to have the preeminence in his body and then the third thing that God wanted uh was to take us back or restore us back to eating conditions again and um you know this restoration is something like I say very spiritual and you know um just loved all these brothers brother Mark with that Unity my God uh I I I'm I was just blessed but one of the things that uh the Lord put in my heart on a natural standpoint I don't believe that this day happened by chance I don't believe that this service was was was pre-planned by chance God knew every one of us that would be here today and he knew what would be said today and um you know one of the things that the Lord put in my heart restoration being uh just the the mind of God there was a a boy that left home one day and when he left home he he he he he took everything that belonged to him and he got out of his father's house so I I just I don't want this anymore now he had a a good life but somehow the enemy come in and got in that boy's mind and say I'm I'm leaving and he went out on his own and um and while the boy was out on his own some really really bad things began to happen to him uh the Bible says that he got involved in riotous living and when he got involved in riotous living what happened was that um uh and here's the thing it's it's just amazing that the protection the covering that God has over us even when we ain't living right how many of y'all been protected by God and you know somebody should have shot you somebody should have killed you you was in a car accident and you should have died your life went right with God and had you been had you died then you know you would have made it to Heaven amen we don't we the covering the protection that God gives us even when we ain't living right this boy was out there living like that and lost all of his friends and when he lost all of his friends he he lost all his money and it's it's amazing how friends love to hang with as long as you got a little something in your pocket but when you ain't got nothing in your pocket now you ain't got no friends praise the Lord when you get broke when they done spent all and exhausted all your resources now you're broke they don't want nothing to do with you but even in a moment like that God take that little piece of furniture that's sitting out there on the side say I still got use for you that little boy just began to think see I'm out here and I got got a job that I even shouldn't have I done took a job that would be a shame for a Jew to have I'm feeding Pigs we're not even supposed to eat pig don't have nothing to do but I got this job and it's the only job I can find it was on hard times and it got so bad that he he couldn't afford even though he's working ain't that something I'm working but I still I can't pay my bills and not only that I don't even have enough money to buy grocery I'm but I'm working every day and I what what what's going on in my life it's like like like I'm like I'm in a um uh everything I do just it's just been absorbed I'm in a hole I keep falling I can't get up this boy say it's got to be a better life than this and I know where I come from I know where I used to be and see restoration is not replacement see we're not restoration is to bring up the same thing that went down right so so so this boy this boy this boy says uh you know I'm out here and I can't even afford grocery but I used to eat like a king in my daddy's house I used to eat in plenty and I was I was satisfied lord said but things done change for me it says now I'm out here eating pig slop the stuff that they throwing out in the garbage I I'm eating this and trying to get Fe get full of this he said you know what the Bible say he came to himself and and and and and when he came to himself that was a part of the restoration process that was taking place right there when that boy came to himself he said you know what in my daddy's house even the servants live better than the way I live so I'm going get up from here and I'm going back to my daddy's house now I'm I'm I'm going tell you something when you get up to go back to Daddy's house you're swallowing a lot of Pride but see that's why you got to be sanded down God got to take that Pride out your life and when he's standing you down taking that Pride now he can work with you a little bit and and and the way this boy approaches that he wasn't going back uh like like he came you know brother brandom told the story how the how the preacher went to the pull pit and he had his Bible tucked a certain way and you know he walked up there and he said I'mma lay this thing out and I'mma give it to him and and he couldn't get no amens out the congregation and before you know it he uh he he took the Bible and he put his head down he walked on that the pull pit and one of the old Saints it had to be one of the old Saints I don't know why she had to say this and embarrass that man like that but she say if you would a win up the way you came downlu then you would have came down the way you went up that boy when he was on his way back home he said I'm not going back entitled I'm I'm going back and I'm ask dadd I said Daddy even your servants live better in the way I'm living I am embarrassed to say how I've shamed you I'm embarrassed Daddy but your servants live better than the way I'm living out here and Daddy I'm I'm so sorry what I've done to you and Mama but if there's any possibility that I could come back and work for you and just be a servant I'd be so happy daddy yes Lord his daddy looked at that boy and said son I'm happy to have you home but I need you to understand something you didn't leave this house as a servant but you left this house as a son and when we restore you we restore you better all right so servants get this boy a road also bring him a ring of gold he ain't got nothing don't look like nobody don't feel like nobody but when he wear this ring he going to feel like something I'm going restore your confidence I'm going restore your position I'm going restore your place I I'm going restore how you feel about yourself you I'm I'm I'mma restore your mind I'm going to restore everything about you son I'm going restore your clothes I'm going restore your shoes I'm going restore your room that you will staying in son I'm going to restore everything son get give this boy a ring of club and then then kill the Fatt calf Hallelujah the fattest one you can get off get get the Fatt one and bring it here we going to have oursel a meal we going to eat in plenty we're going to be satisfied the boy could never be a servant because he was born a son God restored that boy his brother didn't like it his brother wasn't in a agement with all this but like brother tro said who who said it who said it who said it it was God that said it it was the Lord that said it and since the Lord said it we ain't got nothing to do with what the Lord said he going to do we just thank God for the process I will restore sayeth the Lord the Mishawaka God bless you all Church you appreciate our brothers brother quu brother Mark brother Quinton brother Jerry brother Troy my God my God my God my God my God amen amen amen amen we don't have an altar this is one where you can have an altar call and invite people and everything but I want you to know something the altar is in your heart and if you will receive what God has spoken to you today you don't have to leave here the same way you came you can walk out in the restoration brother brandom told us that when um Old Testament scripture when a slave uh heard the Jubilee trumpet says whatever that slave was doing at that time he didn't have to apologize J to the boss of nothing he could just lay down his tools and say I'm no longer no longer going to be your slave I'm going to walk in the liberty and the freedom that God has given me if you've been enslaved by the devil in any area of your life today is a day that you can go free and brother brandom say the enforcer is here to make the devil what the devil got to do anybody know what the devil got to do the enforcer is here to make the devil give it back you you know what that means know what that tell me I don't have to wrestle with the devil I ain't got to fight with the devil all I got to do is believe what God Said
