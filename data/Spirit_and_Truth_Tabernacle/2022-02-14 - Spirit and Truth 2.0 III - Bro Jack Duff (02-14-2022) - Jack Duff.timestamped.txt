[49:28] economy or here in the united states
[49:30] that we do a lot of things on credit
[49:33] and if you can pay your bills on time
[49:35] you can get what they call good credit
[49:39] right
[49:40] my my wife don't really have a job
[49:45] right now we do have a business and you
[49:47] know i'm talking about just the last two
[49:49] weeks she just start getting a real
[49:51] not even a it's a paycheck i can't call
[49:54] it a real paycheck it's a paycheck but
[49:56] she get paid something to put a little
[49:58] money in her pocket
[50:00] and um but you know it's not about how
[50:03] much money you have
[50:05] if you got good
[50:10] good credit to take you a long way
[50:14] and and she walked in there with what we
[50:16] call good credit
[50:17] they call it excellent credit
[50:20] and when she walked in there with
[50:21] excellent credit and i would i just let
[50:22] them talk to talk talk talk look look i
[50:24] ain't paying this i ain't paying that
[50:25] take this off take that off
[50:28] that
[50:29] okay now we're down to the number
[50:31] now
[50:32] when y'all run credit y'all gonna see
[50:34] this y'all gonna see that
[50:36] and uh they say okay
[50:39] when they ran her credit they saw it was
[50:40] 30 points higher than what i said
[50:44] and then they came back and say um you
[50:47] ain't got to put no money down
[50:49] you ain't got to put no money down
[50:53] so when god do things
[50:56] god do thanks
[50:58] so uh
[51:00] pay your bills
[51:02] on time
[51:11] all right
[51:13] now i can read
[51:16] but thank the lord for blessing her
[51:18] amen with with the cause she's been
[51:20] desiring
[51:21] amen um
[51:23] i am the true vine
[51:26] and my father is the husband man
[51:29] every
[51:30] branch in me that beareth not fruit
[51:35] he taketh away and every
[51:37] branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it
[51:41] that it may bring forth
[51:43] more fruit
[51:47] lord i'm trying to read other thing when
[51:49] you pay your bills on time
[51:57] i might not think about this latest
[52:02] and you have what we call a decent or
[52:04] high
[52:05] credit score
[52:07] the other thing that happens for you is
[52:11] you get a excellent
[52:14] interest rate
[52:17] and when you have a lower interest rate
[52:20] it allows you to be able to afford
[52:23] more car
[52:28] brother waiting is that right
[52:34] he's in finance so
[52:37] uh but but just understand this is the
[52:39] way it works i i've been to the car lot
[52:42] and
[52:42] and i had bad credit
[52:45] and i was just praying
[52:48] that when they ran my credit that i'd be
[52:51] able to leave with the keys in my hand
[52:56] and oftentimes you do leave with keys in
[52:58] your hand but your interest rate is so
[53:00] high
[53:03] that it's it's very hard to pay for the
[53:05] car
[53:06] but if you just pay your bills
[53:09] on time
[53:11] what's the sermon in that
[53:15] pay your bills on time
[53:17] you can go in there with confidence
[53:22] you you approach the call out in a
[53:23] totally different
[53:26] you know
[53:27] you got a different aura
[53:29] when you walk through the door
[53:32] come on somebody
[53:34] well you you just got a different or are
[53:36] you not sitting there like lord please
[53:37] lord please no
[53:39] no no no no god i know this gonna work
[53:41] out i ain't even worried about and they
[53:42] gonna do it the way i say they're gonna
[53:43] do it
[53:46] i i i get up and walk in a minute
[53:50] like i do a dave ramsey so quick
[53:54] you ain't sad you ain't talking my
[53:55] language
[53:57] but when they see you got good credit
[54:00] they don't want you walking
[54:04] so pay your bills on time
[54:07] all right glory glory now i'm going to
[54:10] start over
[54:14] i am the true vine
[54:16] and my father is the husband man
[54:19] every branch in me that beareth not
[54:21] fruity taketh away in
[54:23] every branch that beareth
[54:25] that beareth fruit he purgeth it
[54:30] glory
[54:31] that it may bring forth more fruit
[54:35] now you cling
[54:37] through the word which i have spoken
[54:38] unto you abide in me and i in you as the
[54:41] branch
[54:42] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[54:45] abide in the vine
[54:48] no more can ye accept ye abide in me
[54:53] i am the vine ye are the branches
[54:57] he that abideth in me and i in him
[55:00] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[55:02] without me
[55:04] you can do nothing
[55:08] if a man abide
[55:10] not in me he is cast forth as a branch
[55:13] and is withered and men gather them and
[55:16] cast him into the fire and they are
[55:18] burned if ye
[55:20] abide in me
[55:23] and my words abide in you
[55:28] ye shall ask what ye
[55:30] will
[55:32] and it shall be done
[55:34] unto
[55:36] you
[55:37] amen
[55:39] here in john chapter 4
[55:43] uh verse
[55:46] 23
[55:49] but the hour cometh
[55:52] and now is
[55:54] when
[55:55] the true worshipers shall worship

[1:02:52] not try to skin you the first time you
[1:02:54] come through the door stick around long
[1:02:56] enough
[1:02:57] amen you're gonna hear
[1:02:59] truth why because you're attending
[1:03:05] spirit and truth
[1:03:07] so it's our responsibility to make sure
[1:03:09] that you get truth if you never hear it
[1:03:11] nowhere else you gonna hear it here
[1:03:14] glory to god amen but by here you know
[1:03:16] we understand something uh uh you know
[1:03:19] you made some tough decisions many of
[1:03:21] you all some some oh my goodness my
[1:03:23] goodness my goodness i'm just i'm going
[1:03:25] back in my mind there's so many little
[1:03:27] things amen i remember i remember you
[1:03:30] know when we first started the church
[1:03:31] out
[1:03:32] a man uh oh i was i was saying this a
[1:03:34] sister you know she made a a a a stand
[1:03:38] to follow this truth and stay with this
[1:03:40] word follow this word and got criticized
[1:03:44] for years by family
[1:03:45] friends by just criticized like crazy
[1:03:48] but she stood she
[1:03:49] she stood on what she believed
[1:03:51] and and then years later
[1:03:54] different things began to happen and the
[1:03:56] people start calling her and said would
[1:03:57] you pray for me i i know the prayer
[1:04:00] warriors and i know you are a prayer
[1:04:02] warrior well you said you used to say
[1:04:04] then take all that
[1:04:06] not take that and more
[1:04:08] you want somebody that can get in
[1:04:09] contact with god
[1:04:12] hallelujah right so so so you know um uh
[1:04:16] you know i'm just you know let me just
[1:04:18] read this you know just kind of keep
[1:04:19] moving um but you all chose amen
[1:04:23] there was a some some huge decisions
[1:04:26] that you made in order to be part of
[1:04:28] spirit and truth tabernacle and this
[1:04:30] quote i just want to encourage you with
[1:04:31] because thou has chosen
[1:04:34] glory to god the narrow path the heart
[1:04:37] away thou hast walked in your
[1:04:40] own choosing this ain't nothing that
[1:04:43] brother jack uh uh and i mean encourage
[1:04:46] you or convince you to do this is
[1:04:48] something that you chose to do yourself
[1:04:51] and because thou has walked in your own
[1:04:55] choosing he says thou has picked the
[1:04:58] precise and correct way now notice that
[1:05:01] when you're making a choice you have to
[1:05:03] know is this the way god wants me to go
[1:05:05] or not the way god wants me to go and
[1:05:07] hallelujah god has a way of confirming
[1:05:11] amen that he has you right where he
[1:05:13] needs you at the time that you're there
[1:05:17] can i tell you this morning you in the
[1:05:18] right place
[1:05:20] at the right time
[1:05:22] oh jesus
[1:05:25] amen thou hast picked the precise and
[1:05:27] correct way
[1:05:29] correct decision and it is my way
[1:05:33] glory to god and he says because of this
[1:05:36] momentous decision
[1:05:38] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[1:05:43] my god he says what a glorious decision
[1:05:46] thou hast made that's that's god
[1:05:48] speaking back to you amen on the choice
[1:05:51] that you made what a glorious decision
[1:05:53] thou hast made this in itself
[1:05:57] is that which will make and come to pass
[1:06:00] the tremendous victory
[1:06:03] in the love divine
[1:06:05] i'll tell you what if you have not been
[1:06:07] blessed you will be blessed
[1:06:09] for the decision that you've made to be
[1:06:11] a part of spirit and truth
[1:06:13] 2.0
[1:06:15] i believe that
[1:06:16] i believe that with all my heart
[1:06:19] now i told you we're looking for some
[1:06:20] 20s
[1:06:22] especially when we talk about this 2.0
[1:06:24] so i found another 20
[1:06:26] and mark 16.
[1:06:27] let's read this a man
[1:06:30] uh in mark 16 oh hallelujah
[1:06:33] glory to god
[1:06:35] thank you jesus mark 16 verse 15.
[1:06:38] it says and he said unto them
[1:06:41] go ye into all the world
[1:06:44] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:06:46] my
[1:06:47] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:06:49] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:06:51] be damned
[1:06:52] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:06:54] believe in my name shall they cast out
[1:06:56] devils

[1:07:06] they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:07:08] and they shall recover
[1:07:11] my
[1:07:11] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:07:13] them he was received up into heaven
[1:07:15] and sat on the right hand of god
[1:07:18] and they went forth and preached
[1:07:20] everywhere the lord working with them

[1:11:05] time going to africa i went with brother
[1:11:07] joe underwood senior
[1:11:09] and now to take his son
[1:11:12] through international waters
[1:11:14] would actually be an honor
[1:11:17] it would be an honor for me to be able
[1:11:18] to do that and it's just a testimony
[1:11:21] amen to what god has done for this
[1:11:23] church and fulfilling amen this
[1:11:26] scripture that i just read to to take
[1:11:28] the gospel into all the world preach the
[1:11:30] gospel to every creature right he that
[1:11:32] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:11:34] but he that believeth not shall be

[1:11:38] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:11:39] out devils they shall speak with new

[1:11:45] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:11:46] the sheep they shall recover so then
[1:11:48] after he had spoken unto them he
[1:11:50] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:11:52] right hand of god and then went forth
[1:11:53] and preached and and they went forth and
[1:11:56] preached everywhere the lord working
[1:11:58] with them and confirming the word with
[1:11:59] signs following
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:02] thank you lord that we've had an
[1:12:03] opportunity
[1:12:05] to fulfill the great commission
[1:12:09] let me read here out of the message the
[1:12:10] revelation of jesus christ from the
[1:12:12] church age book
[1:12:14] amen in reference to this scripture
[1:12:16] brother adam said let me show you
[1:12:18] another reason
[1:12:19] why satan hates this book of the
[1:12:22] revelation of jesus christ in the church
[1:12:25] amen he knows that jesus christ is the
[1:12:28] same yesterday and today and forever and
[1:12:32] he changes not
[1:12:34] he knows that a whole lot more than do
[1:12:37] 90 of the theologians he knows that
[1:12:40] since god is immutable in his nature
[1:12:43] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[1:12:47] the satan knows assuredly hallelujah
[1:12:50] that the original church at pentecost
[1:12:53] with the power of god mark 16 in action
[1:12:58] amen is the true church that jesus
[1:13:02] claims as his own all else is false it
[1:13:05] has to be he goes on in the revelation
[1:13:07] of jesus christ he says now remember
[1:13:10] this christ in the true church is a
[1:13:13] continuation of the book of acts but the
[1:13:16] book of revelation shows how that
[1:13:18] antichrist spirit should come into the
[1:13:21] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:13:25] formal and powerless it exposes its
[1:13:28] satan revealing his works attempted
[1:13:31] destruction of god's people and the
[1:13:33] discrediting of god's word i just love
[1:13:36] this statement amen because we have
[1:13:38] through these years we have seen how
[1:13:41] god's people have fallen into lukewarm
[1:13:43] condition condition we have seen how
[1:13:46] amen they try to
[1:13:48] try to destroy this message by
[1:13:51] discrediting certain things
[1:13:53] glory to god discrediting a bridge
[1:13:56] discrediting amen the appearing of seven
[1:13:59] discrediting god's word amen but we have
[1:14:02] stood faithful
[1:14:04] glory to god on the word of god look at
[1:14:07] what he says he says um i attempted
[1:14:09] destruction of god's word uh god's
[1:14:11] people and discredit the screening god's
[1:14:13] word right down to the time he is cast
[1:14:17] into the lake of fire he fights that
[1:14:20] my he cannot stand it he knows that if
[1:14:23] the people get the true revelation of
[1:14:26] the true church and what she is
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:31] what she stands for
[1:14:34] glory to god and that she can
[1:14:37] do the greater works
[1:14:39] she will praise god
[1:14:42] man
[1:14:43] one of my favorite quotes she will be an
[1:14:46] invincible army
[1:14:49] amen
[1:14:51] glory to god i'm speaking that over this
[1:14:53] church we will be an invincible army and
[1:14:57] do you realize what an invincible army
[1:15:00] is it's one that is too powerful to be
[1:15:03] defeated
[1:15:05] glory to god amen too powerful to be
[1:15:09] overcome
[1:15:10] amen an invincible army
[1:15:13] a praying army a whole fire army
[1:15:18] glory to god amen that's who we are she
[1:15:21] will be an invincible army if they get a
[1:15:24] true revelation of the two spirits
[1:15:26] within the framework of the christian
[1:15:28] church and by god's spirit discern and
[1:15:30] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[1:15:33] will be powerless before her he will be
[1:15:36] as definitely thwarted today as when
[1:15:39] christ withstood his every effort to
[1:15:41] gain power with him in the desert yes
[1:15:43] satan hates revelation but we love it
[1:15:46] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:15:47] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:15:50] but we will prevail over them
[1:15:52] oh how i thank god mark 16
[1:15:56] in action
[1:15:57] that that's who we are you know i was uh
[1:16:00] just reflecting and
[1:16:02] so much you know over the years that the
[1:16:03] lord has done uh i i'm i'm i'm thinking

[1:19:42] he had his brother coming to church and
[1:19:44] amen and and had no idea who he was
[1:19:49] glory
[1:19:50] brother shane from south africa

[1:20:33] brother manners ministry of the
[1:20:35] anointing come down and played the piano
[1:20:39] i'm crazy enough to believe that

[1:20:52] piano sitting in the church and nobody
[1:20:55] able to play the piano
[1:20:57] nobody in the church i know how to do
[1:20:59] anything with it it was just when we had
[1:21:01] a guest maybe maybe brother smiley
[1:21:03] brought the church over the top i know
[1:21:04] my sister can play right but we we just
[1:21:07] had it there but nobody we just sung
[1:21:08] acapella

[1:21:15] i got this
[1:21:16] amen god's got it all in control
[1:21:20] glory to god right amen but i need you
[1:21:23] to understand that's that's that's our
[1:21:24] roots
[1:21:25] that's where we come from and then god
[1:21:27] began to add to that
[1:21:31] oh he's a good god
[1:21:33] brother shane say pastor you don't mind
[1:21:35] could i just play around with the piano
[1:21:37] a little bit while you're in here i said
[1:21:38] sure you can do that brother that
[1:21:40] brother got up and he start
[1:21:42] playing around and said that ain't
[1:21:43] playing around that's
[1:21:45] that that that's playing
[1:21:49] and i went to the brother of me that's
[1:21:50] in that brother
[1:21:52] uh
[1:21:54] as long as you're in this church
[1:21:57] because i know you got a job that caused
[1:21:58] you to you know leave and come back and
[1:22:00] leave and come i said but as long as
[1:22:01] you're here when you show up
[1:22:04] your job is to play this piano
[1:22:07] that's what you do you play the piano
[1:22:09] brother and brother shane said okay
[1:22:11] pastor you know i'll gladly do it he and
[1:22:13] once he got started it inspired
[1:22:16] many others
[1:22:18] glory to god he was an inspiration to so
[1:22:20] many started with sister candace and
[1:22:22] amen went to my daughter since
[1:22:24] alexandria sister rachel uh sister
[1:22:26] rebecca i tried to get sister sarah i
[1:22:28] tried
[1:22:30] she can get a few songs down but amen
[1:22:32] but now we we we got uh uh sister dassa
[1:22:35] coming i mean you know it's just it's

[1:22:46] come on
[1:22:47] amen it's a bench that's been created
[1:22:50] god is good
[1:22:55] but you know i thank the lord for this i
[1:22:57] want to just step back
[1:22:59] just give you a little bit more of the
[1:23:01] testimony here but
[1:23:02] the reason that i like to read john 15.
[1:23:06] one of the things about me that you'll
[1:23:07] find amen that uh i'm i'm not a person
[1:23:10] that's just moved with a lot of
[1:23:12] fanaticism
[1:23:14] but what moves me is the word
[1:23:17] right if i can see something in the word
[1:23:19] if god can quicken something to me in
[1:23:21] scripture i know that's the eternal word
[1:23:23] of god i can i can rest my soul
[1:23:27] on the eternal word of god
[1:23:29] and i remember you know
[1:23:31] i just got to give y'all just a little
[1:23:33] testimony i'm trying to i'm going to get
[1:23:35] through all this and if i can but uh but
[1:23:37] years ago i was um
[1:23:40] i was at home and and my my my uh
[1:23:43] thing i used to do in the morning
[1:23:44] because i i didn't watch television
[1:23:47] and i still don't
[1:23:49] amen i didn't watch television and uh so
[1:23:52] but when i was going to work i wanted to
[1:23:55] uh be able to kind of talk sports with
[1:23:57] the guys so i would just get a newspaper
[1:24:00] and i just read what happened in the
[1:24:02] newspaper so i was ready to talk sports
[1:24:04] with the guys i ain't watching no game
[1:24:06] did you see the game no
[1:24:10] and they just never realized i never saw
[1:24:12] the game
[1:24:14] i'm just reading the sports page and
[1:24:16] then one morning i went downstairs and
[1:24:18] and i picked up that sports page and i
[1:24:20] was running back upstairs to read it
[1:24:22] before i left out to go to work and and
[1:24:24] uh and and as i as i was picking up the
[1:24:26] page i'm picking up the paper i heard a
[1:24:29] voice say if you read your bible as
[1:24:32] faith as you read that newspaper you'll
[1:24:34] be much further up the road
[1:24:37] my lord
[1:24:38] now i'm telling what i heard
[1:24:40] and when i heard i say uh
[1:24:42] now i know the devil didn't tell me that
[1:24:46] that was the voice of god speaking
[1:24:48] directly to me if you read your bible as
[1:24:51] faithful as you read that newspaper
[1:24:53] you'll be much further up the road
[1:24:56] a rebuke to me
[1:24:58] i put that newspaper down
[1:25:01] i said okay i'ma start reading my bible
[1:25:03] and on that day i found a bible reading
[1:25:06] plan for a one-year bible reading plan
[1:25:08] and i started reading
[1:25:10] and from that day to this day
[1:25:14] i read through the bible every year
[1:25:17] i do one-year bible reading plans every
[1:25:20] year
[1:25:21] i invite you
[1:25:23] join me on the journey
[1:25:26] because if you read your bible
[1:25:29] as faith as you got on facebook
[1:25:34] instagram
[1:25:36] you would be
[1:25:38] much further up the road
[1:25:49] so i've been doing this for for years
[1:25:51] and
[1:25:52] you know so so i i and i know now why
[1:25:54] god and there's so much that god just
[1:25:56] shows you in that because um
[1:25:59] i can prove the message with the bible
[1:26:02] that's why i believe the message because
[1:26:04] i see it in the bible i've read my
[1:26:06] bible
[1:26:08] that's why you can't get me on a lot of
[1:26:10] nonsense you can't get me with a bridge
[1:26:12] and a bear and all no no i read my bible
[1:26:15] this uh
[1:26:16] bears and bridges not in here
[1:26:19] that ain't what we talking about that's
[1:26:21] something personal for him but i'm
[1:26:23] talking about the message part
[1:26:25] go really god but i read my bible that's
[1:26:26] why you're not just don't pull a lot
[1:26:28] over my oh over me like that and and you
[1:26:30] know i don't know at all i'm still
[1:26:31] reading and learning it and what i find
[1:26:33] is that different seasons in your life
[1:26:35] god will speak different things to you
[1:26:39] it's an eternal word
[1:26:42] i found out something recently that went
[1:26:44] the word even though even though it
[1:26:45] might have manifested itself in one
[1:26:47] generation in time past it's not just a
[1:26:50] historical book it's an eternal word so
[1:26:52] it will it has the tendency to repeat
[1:26:55] itself and it will repeat itself in your
[1:26:58] generation
[1:27:00] oh come on somebody amen just recently
[1:27:04] reading the word of god and moses goes
[1:27:07] down and tell pharaoh

[1:29:49] amen my child is a miracle sometimes
[1:29:52] some of y'all need to go back in your
[1:29:54] mind and think about what god did for
[1:29:55] you even to bring forth that child
[1:29:58] and they're gonna get to this point
[1:30:00] and you're gonna think you think the

[1:30:20] grace that can save us from all our sins
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:26] uh
[1:30:27] and so i'm trying to get my thought back
[1:30:30] and
[1:30:31] but uh but
[1:30:32] you know we just we just thank the lord
[1:30:34] for for for this and
[1:30:36] uh i know i was talking about brother
[1:30:37] shane i talk about
[1:30:38] y'all help me where was i
[1:30:41] the bible i got past that
[1:30:48] read my bible okay
[1:30:50] so i invite you read your bible
[1:30:55] brother random say we get closer to god
[1:30:57] by reading our bible and praying every
[1:30:58] day
[1:31:01] so you know i i so so for years i've
[1:31:04] i've read my bible all the way through
[1:31:06] and i'm i'm on it again this year i
[1:31:08] start january 1st i start reading and i
[1:31:10] encourage you if you say well i can
[1:31:12] start january first start like i did
[1:31:13] start right in the middle of the year
[1:31:15] right where start where the plans start
[1:31:16] and just keep on going keep going
[1:31:19] and and i've done that for i know it's
[1:31:21] over 20 years
[1:31:22] over 20 years and i don't say that in a
[1:31:24] bragging way amen but i i do say that
[1:31:27] that
[1:31:28] god had to
[1:31:29] prepare me for where i'm at right now
[1:31:32] and this is what this is what it this
[1:31:34] this is how he prepared me
[1:31:36] right so um you know one of the times i
[1:31:39] was reading my bible
[1:31:42] and i was reading john 15.
[1:31:45] and when i was reading john 15
[1:31:50] it said there i'm the vine
[1:31:52] my father is a husband husband man and
[1:31:54] every branch of me that beareth not
[1:31:56] fruit
[1:31:57] you take it away
[1:31:59] and every branch that bears fruit
[1:32:02] it purgeth it
[1:32:03] and as i'm reading that
[1:32:05] it's like the the words just rolls up at
[1:32:08] the bible
[1:32:11] what are you saying god
[1:32:13] every branch of me that beareth not
[1:32:15] fruit he taketh away
[1:32:16] and every branch that beareth fruit
[1:32:20] he purgeth it
[1:32:24] god
[1:32:25] so i'm sitting here and i'm going
[1:32:26] through this in my mind and through my
[1:32:28] spirit like lord i
[1:32:30] i know i can't stay where i'm at i got
[1:32:32] to move on i mean there's some things
[1:32:34] that's happened that i know
[1:32:35] uh that it's causing me to step out of
[1:32:38] this environment that i'm in and uh and
[1:32:41] as i was just kind of processing the
[1:32:42] lord just kind of showed him he says no
[1:32:44] it's not because oftentimes people leave
[1:32:46] a church and the first thing they want
[1:32:47] to do is down the church don't you do
[1:32:49] that
[1:32:52] like the church ain't do nothing for you
[1:32:55] don't do that don't get engaged in
[1:32:57] nothing like that
[1:32:58] think about the good things
[1:33:01] satan always wants you to focus on the
[1:33:02] bad things think about the good things
[1:33:06] so so so when you know you get you get
[1:33:08] there and you know and and you start
[1:33:10] going through and you think about
[1:33:10] leaving church and like okay okay and
[1:33:12] and don't don't get me wrong sometimes
[1:33:14] truth just got to be shared
[1:33:16] but but but but you ain't got to say it
[1:33:17] in a way where you're trying to down
[1:33:19] that ministry
[1:33:21] so so you know uh as i'm going through
[1:33:23] like lord this is this is a fruitful
[1:33:24] ministry it's been very uh good to me
[1:33:26] and to my family and it's been this has
[1:33:28] been that
[1:33:29] i mean what's going on but as i start
[1:33:31] reading and just focusing on that he
[1:33:33] says he he um uh uh every branch in me
[1:33:37] that bear not fruit he taketh away
[1:33:40] and every branch that bear through he
[1:33:42] purges it that it may bring forth more
[1:33:45] fruit
[1:33:46] right so so i begin to realize that
[1:33:48] sometimes it has to be cut
[1:33:51] in order to go through an update
[1:33:57] in order for it to bring forth more
[1:33:59] fruit it has to go through a process of
[1:34:01] purging
[1:34:03] right and and the purging process is
[1:34:05] never easy
[1:34:08] hallelujah it's never easy so so as i
[1:34:11] realized what was going on say okay lord
[1:34:13] i i know you're speaking to me through
[1:34:15] this verse you know i'm going through
[1:34:16] this purging process and you know and i
[1:34:19] have to say it like this you know uh
[1:34:21] paul said that uh the the believers in
[1:34:24] this day say you are the seal of my
[1:34:26] apostleship
[1:34:27] but when i look at the saints of spirit
[1:34:29] and truth tabernacle i say you are the
[1:34:31] seal of my pastoral
[1:34:36] this is the fruit
[1:34:37] now i remember many times when i go back
[1:34:39] to my old past and i come with the
[1:34:41] church
[1:34:42] we're bringing the fruit
[1:34:44] this is the fruit of the ministry this
[1:34:46] is not anything that brother jack
[1:34:47] dinner's on but this is the fruit of the
[1:34:49] ministry
[1:34:51] glory to god
[1:34:52] but as i was you know processing this
[1:34:54] and just thinking through it praying
[1:34:56] over it i said lord i know you're
[1:34:58] speaking to me through this and i
[1:34:59] appreciate you you know and just just
[1:35:02] hearing your voice and i'll just i'll
[1:35:03] just wait you know just to get more you
[1:35:05] know from you and and and i remember
[1:35:07] going to a meeting uh
[1:35:10] one of the one of the brother coleman's
[1:35:12] meetings and as i was headed to the
[1:35:13] meeting
[1:35:15] went there and the first service i
[1:35:16] believe we sat down and and brother
[1:35:18] david musgrove from at that time he was
[1:35:20] from oklahoma but now he lives out in
[1:35:22] tucson uh he came and he was the
[1:35:24] medicine he he says okay we're gonna
[1:35:26] preach amen the sermon today and and i
[1:35:29] want you to turn your bibles to john 15.
[1:35:31] i say oh my
[1:35:34] he says i turn your bibles you start
[1:35:36] reading the scripture and i say oh my
[1:35:39] lord as soon as he read the scripture i
[1:35:41] say now this is the same one that god
[1:35:43] just had elevate for me and the brother
[1:35:46] titled his sermon fruit
[1:35:49] much fruit
[1:35:51] more fruit
[1:35:53] i just even from the title i almost
[1:35:55] stopped listening i just start praying
[1:35:57] to me say god i know you speaking to me
[1:36:00] right now
[1:36:01] i know i i know i know you saying
[1:36:03] something to me i don't even know what
[1:36:04] to do i don't know god i know i'm in
[1:36:06] your presence
[1:36:08] then nobody knew what i was going
[1:36:09] through at that moment no tears nothing
[1:36:11] just just hearing from god
[1:36:15] i said lord what do you want me to do
[1:36:17] at that moment i'm sitting there in this
[1:36:19] in the service saying okay god i know
[1:36:21] you just spoke to me through your word
[1:36:23] now what do you want me to do
[1:36:25] that's what he said start the church i
[1:36:27] said god what you want me to title the
[1:36:28] church
[1:36:29] it says spirit and truth tabernacle now
[1:36:32] i knew where that was
[1:36:34] right back in the book of john
[1:36:36] hallelujah so i held on to that for two
[1:36:39] years didn't say anything to anybody not
[1:36:41] even
[1:36:42] my wife
[1:36:44] i waited i waited i waited
[1:36:47] and while i was waiting i want you to
[1:36:48] understand i was very faithful to church
[1:36:50] you know you ain't got to be telling
[1:36:52] everybody what you're doing
[1:36:55] let it just happen
[1:36:57] and you know because i saw i mean
[1:36:59] i'm going way back in my history some of
[1:37:01] this is not even my notes but i saw
[1:37:03] different people transition from our
[1:37:05] church and the way they did it was so
[1:37:07] bad
[1:37:09] some of some some of these are witnesses
[1:37:11] in here the way they did it was so bad
[1:37:13] the way they went to some of the people
[1:37:15] in the church and the way they just
[1:37:16] handled themselves it was so bad i never
[1:37:18] felt even comfortable doing things that
[1:37:19] way i would have conversations with my
[1:37:21] pastor but i'm like no i ain't going to
[1:37:23] do things like that
[1:37:24] and at the very time that i finally
[1:37:26] decided okay i'm going to leave
[1:37:28] this going you know i can't i can't i
[1:37:30] can't do it anymore i left but i i've
[1:37:32] already been having conversations with
[1:37:34] him
[1:37:35] and uh you know and i remember um at the
[1:37:38] time that i decided to leave his his mom
[1:37:42] passed away now that really put a damp
[1:37:44] in me i'm like how i'm gonna leave him
[1:37:45] now his mama just passed
[1:37:49] i'ma serve until
[1:37:52] he gets things kind of situated i stayed
[1:37:54] right there did as much as i could the
[1:37:56] people are a witness
[1:37:59] the people are a witness i was faithful
[1:38:01] i did everything until the day it was
[1:38:03] time for me to go
[1:38:04] amen
[1:38:06] and when i walked out you know i finally
[1:38:07] told you that this gonna be my it's
[1:38:09] gonna be it's gonna be my last sunday
[1:38:10] whatever and uh you know i gave them the
[1:38:12] keys and and whatever that was and i
[1:38:14] said okay i got to move on and and i
[1:38:16] realized because god told me to say look
[1:38:18] you you can't be blessed until you move
[1:38:21] on
[1:38:23] abraham could not get blessed until he
[1:38:25] was able to just leave
[1:38:27] where he was at he couldn't he could
[1:38:29] receive the blessings of god
[1:38:31] trying to stay in earth
[1:38:33] that one the black that were in the
[1:38:34] black that's that was not the place
[1:38:36] where the blessings were for abraham
[1:38:39] now other people living in ur might have
[1:38:41] been blessed but you got to know where
[1:38:43] your blessings are
[1:38:47] and for abraham he had to leave the land
[1:38:49] of earth
[1:38:52] once he left then god could bless him
[1:38:54] now and that's when god said now look
[1:38:55] around look around look at all the stars
[1:38:56] look at this look at that look at
[1:38:58] everything it was just sitting there
[1:38:59] waiting for him so i learned i had to
[1:39:01] leave i had i couldn't have any
[1:39:02] attachments i couldn't be holding on to
[1:39:04] keys of the church and out here doing
[1:39:06] something else
[1:39:07] no no no no let it go completely
[1:39:12] while i was waiting on the lord to
[1:39:15] you know to um
[1:39:18] uh to lead us to our next step and i had
[1:39:20] not shared it with my wife yet what the
[1:39:22] name of the church was you know she was
[1:39:24] on the journey with me and as i'm
[1:39:26] talking about two or three year journey
[1:39:27] we were on and finally god began to deal
[1:39:29] with her in dreams and as he began to
[1:39:31] deal with her we began to get the
[1:39:33] meaning of those dreams and we knew that
[1:39:34] okay this is this is the lord this is
[1:39:36] the lord we know that that we know so
[1:39:38] she began asking what we gonna do i said
[1:39:40] we're gonna start a church what's gonna
[1:39:42] be the name of church i say spirit and
[1:39:43] true tabernacle say how you can be so
[1:39:44] certain about them things so fast i said
[1:39:46] god told me this two years ago and i
[1:39:48] just get into i'm just getting to the
[1:39:50] point to tell you i had to wait for you
[1:39:51] to get to a certain spot the
[1:39:53] cheers okay
[1:39:54] okay
[1:39:55] she knew that it was it was of the lord
[1:39:58] so we went and talked to our pastor amen
[1:40:00] we both went in and talked to our past
[1:40:01] and said this is what's going on and i
[1:40:03] just kind of told him i didn't tell him
[1:40:05] i was starting a church i just told him
[1:40:06] say look
[1:40:07] whatever
[1:40:08] the lord calls me to do
[1:40:11] i believe
[1:40:13] whether anybody else believe or not
[1:40:16] i believe i'm free to do whatever god
[1:40:19] calls me to do
[1:40:22] so i just told him like that
[1:40:24] and uh and then he looked at my wife and
[1:40:25] says now sister erica
[1:40:28] you ready for this
[1:40:31] she and i'm like oh lord what's she
[1:40:33] gonna say
[1:40:36] that's a tough question
[1:40:38] and she responded with one of the best
[1:40:40] answers i'll always remember it
[1:40:42] she says nobody could ever be ready for
[1:40:44] this
[1:40:46] i said that's wise
[1:40:52] nobody could ever be ready for this
[1:40:56] you're taking a step of faith
[1:40:58] and you're just trusting god all the way
[1:41:00] through
[1:41:01] and when you can look back 20 years down
[1:41:03] the road say oh god you did it
[1:41:12] you all know about the history of the
[1:41:13] churches i won't go into all that but
[1:41:15] i'm gonna i'm gonna share a scripture
[1:41:16] here with you i think i got that part of
[1:41:19] testimony let me share a scripture i
[1:41:21] told you we're looking for them 20s
[1:41:23] and this
[1:41:24] scripture
[1:41:25] that i want to share is the seventh of
[1:41:28] those scriptures with twenties
[1:41:30] joshua
[1:41:32] chapter 20.
[1:41:49] the lord also spake unto josh was saying
[1:41:54] speak to the children of israel
[1:41:57] saying a point out for you cities of
[1:42:00] refuge
[1:42:02] wherever i speak unto you
[1:42:05] by the hand of moses
[1:42:07] so what we got what we're going to get
[1:42:09] from here is that god had certain places
[1:42:12] that people could go
[1:42:15] and get refuge
[1:42:18] you just couldn't go to any city
[1:42:21] now i hope you can read between
[1:42:24] the lines
[1:42:26] you just couldn't go to any city you had
[1:42:29] to go to the city that god established
[1:42:32] as a place of refuge
[1:42:34] if you wanted
[1:42:36] refuge
[1:42:38] hallelujah
[1:42:40] now notice this it says uh speak to the
[1:42:43] children of israel saying a point out
[1:42:44] for you cities of refuge whereof i speak
[1:42:47] unto you by the hand of moses that the
[1:42:49] slayer
[1:42:51] that killeth any person unawares and
[1:42:55] unwittingly
[1:42:56] may flee thither and and they shall be
[1:42:59] your refuge from the avenger of blood
[1:43:03] now understand what is being spoken here
[1:43:06] if a person happened to
[1:43:08] uh uh uh commit manslaughter a man uh
[1:43:12] that killed somebody unaware
[1:43:13] unintentionally amen in those days the
[1:43:16] law was set up an eye for an eye and a
[1:43:20] tooth for a tooth so if if you kill
[1:43:22] somebody's brother or sister something
[1:43:24] like that they had the right to come
[1:43:26] after you and kill you because you
[1:43:27] slayed their relative and it just and
[1:43:30] just i mean and it was law that allowed
[1:43:32] them to do that but god provided a place
[1:43:35] that if you did this
[1:43:37] unintentionally amen if you did this
[1:43:40] unwittingly if you did this amen not in
[1:43:43] a way where it was premeditated you had
[1:43:45] a place that you could go to get refuge
[1:43:49] and what that refuge provided you jews
[1:43:51] that you never had to look over your
[1:43:52] shoulder
[1:43:53] you never had to worry about somebody
[1:43:55] coming to take your life you had
[1:43:57] protection
[1:43:59] you had security
[1:44:01] amen you had peace of mind
[1:44:04] glory to god you had everything you need
[1:44:06] when you got to the city of refuge
[1:44:10] glory to god
[1:44:12] i'm telling you spiritually spiritually
[1:44:15] i'm talking about me
[1:44:17] spiritually i found a place of refuge
[1:44:19] not just amen not just in christ
[1:44:22] but god put me a part of a ministry
[1:44:25] where i can have some peace
[1:44:32] oh i got there i got to keep reading
[1:44:35] amen that the slayer that killeth any
[1:44:37] person unawares and unwittingly may flee
[1:44:40] thither
[1:44:41] and they shall be your refuge from the
[1:44:43] adventure of blood and when he that doth
[1:44:45] flee unto one of those cities shall
[1:44:48] stand at the entering of the gate of the
[1:44:50] city and shall declare his cause so when
[1:44:52] you come to the city you got to tell
[1:44:54] them what while you're there

[1:45:03] hey you got to tell them i did it
[1:45:06] i'm guilty but i'm sorry

[1:45:15] city without repenting get that sin
[1:45:17] straight
[1:45:21] glory to god
[1:45:23] he's oh some people just want to just
[1:45:25] hide in the church no you can't do it
[1:45:27] like that get that thing right i told

[1:52:35] of escape and that escape is
[1:52:39] jesus christ
[1:52:41] amen there's a place where you can come
[1:52:44] and let off the sting
[1:52:46] but if you love to sin
[1:52:49] and you don't want god then the enemy is
[1:52:52] going to overtake you somewhere
[1:52:54] you can't come to christ because you
[1:52:56] don't want to and when this man comes to
[1:52:59] christ this place of refuge when a man
[1:53:02] come in the old testament the first
[1:53:04] thing he had to come upon his own free
[1:53:07] will
[1:53:10] i love this you can't come to christ
[1:53:13] with your brother you can't come to
[1:53:15] christ with your sister you got to come
[1:53:17] on your own free will
[1:53:20] it's got to be your own decision that
[1:53:22] i'm going to follow god right since you
[1:53:25] got you got to come upon his own free
[1:53:27] will that's the way you have to come to
[1:53:29] christ
[1:53:30] he says another thing
[1:53:32] you must be satisfied
[1:53:35] whoo hallelujah amen once you get to
[1:53:38] this city of refuge once you get to this
[1:53:41] place in christ you got to be satisfied
[1:53:44] while you are there
[1:53:47] oh i love this you can't hang around
[1:53:50] every day crying
[1:53:53] that's what the prophet said you can't
[1:53:54] be sitting around complaining about this
[1:53:57] complaining about that you need to start
[1:53:59] thanking god for this and thanking god
[1:54:02] for that
[1:54:04] says you can't hang around every day
[1:54:07] crying
[1:54:08] amen amen i like to get out of here i
[1:54:11] like to get out of here they they would
[1:54:13] put you out
[1:54:15] if that's the attitude you got they'll
[1:54:17] put you out he says you must willfully
[1:54:20] want to stay
[1:54:23] once you get to a place of refuge you
[1:54:25] must willfully want to stay it must be
[1:54:28] that you must want to stay in that city
[1:54:31] when you come to christ you can't look
[1:54:32] back to the world
[1:54:34] the bible said he that puts his hand on
[1:54:36] the plow and turns the look back is not
[1:54:38] worthy of the plowing now there's where
[1:54:40] so many so-called christians make their
[1:54:42] mistake so they act like they're going
[1:54:44] to plow but the first little thing comes
[1:54:46] along they blow up about it
[1:54:48] i'm moving on in this amen in this this
[1:54:51] message i'm going down to paragraph 92.
[1:54:54] the man must want to stay in the refuge
[1:54:57] he can't go out there going there
[1:54:59] complaining
[1:55:01] he must want to stay no complaining
[1:55:03] about it outside i love this i love this
[1:55:06] statement outside
[1:55:08] outside he dies
[1:55:10] inside
[1:55:12] he's safe
[1:55:13] i told you there's only certain places
[1:55:15] that god appointed
[1:55:17] the children of israel to go
[1:55:19] history has a strange way of strange way
[1:55:21] of repeating itself
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] outside he dies
[1:55:29] inside
[1:55:30] he lives
[1:55:32] and and and you know it's been you know
[1:55:34] i and i i know this i've known this i
[1:55:37] hear it from so many different sources
[1:55:39] there's many people that have been with
[1:55:41] us on this journey
[1:55:43] been a part of spirit and truth over the
[1:55:44] years complex comes up
[1:55:48] just a little complex something that
[1:55:50] could be worked out
[1:55:52] but they decide that no i'm just going
[1:55:54] to leave i'm not going to be a part of
[1:55:55] it anymore and outside
[1:55:58] they die
[1:56:00] inside
[1:56:02] they live
[1:56:03] let me tell you something right now if
[1:56:05] you are looking for the perfect church
[1:56:09] it won't find i'm gonna tell you why
[1:56:11] i'm gonna tell you why i'm i'm gonna
[1:56:13] tell you why
[1:56:16] as soon as i came in

[1:56:23] it was not perfect anymore as soon as
[1:56:26] you got there
[1:56:27] it stopped being perfect
[1:56:32] so if you're looking for a perfect
[1:56:33] church you ain't gonna find that one
[1:56:36] what you need to understand is that we
[1:56:37] are gonna have to go through some things
[1:56:38] where we just gonna let iron sharpen
[1:56:40] iron and we just learn to work with each
[1:56:43] other
[1:56:44] come on somebody yeah
[1:56:49] we didn't learn to work with each other
[1:56:52] no glory to god i mean them sisters i
[1:56:55] was given a hard time on this program
[1:56:58] i was they was they're scared to call me
[1:57:01] i know it

[1:57:53] leave and i know he'll never leave me i
[1:57:56] know he'll never leave you and the
[1:57:58] pressure gets great if it does then he

[1:59:21] sometimes you know i go out and i preach
[1:59:23] a little place and say oh this ain't
[1:59:24] like this ain't like home
[1:59:27] are you preaching at home you're gonna
[1:59:28] get somebody yelling and screaming back
[1:59:30] at you
[1:59:31] and it doesn't make you want to just
[1:59:33] keep preaching
[1:59:35] sometimes when i go someplace i want to
[1:59:37] just take all y'all with me come on
[1:59:38] y'all i know we'll have some church over
[1:59:40] here
[1:59:41] glory to god but it's nothing nothing
[1:59:43] like spirit and truth tabernacle
[1:59:46] so so so but greater than just this
[1:59:49] church
[1:59:50] christ
[1:59:52] is that city of refuge and when we when
[1:59:55] when when we looked at in scripture
[1:59:57] there were six cities
[1:59:59] that god gave moses to establish as a
[2:00:01] place of refuge six is the number of man
[2:00:04] but seven is completion glory to god so
[2:00:07] the seven city
[2:00:09] would be christ
[2:00:14] you can find peace in him
[2:00:16] if you're looking for peace he's the
[2:00:17] person of peace
[2:00:19] and he provides you the peace that you
[2:00:21] need you don't have to wander anymore
[2:00:23] there's hope for your future
[2:00:28] god can give you your deliverance god
[2:00:29] can give you freedom god can give you a
[2:00:31] god can give you joy like you've never
[2:00:33] experienced before
[2:00:34] i was talking to brother wesker just
[2:00:36] yesterday and he we were just saying
[2:00:37] like you know serving god it pays to
[2:00:39] serve god
[2:00:42] it pays
[2:00:43] if you just commit yourself to the lord
[2:00:45] you'll just see just
[2:00:47] i mean everybody got problems in life i
[2:00:49] ain't gonna say i ain't gonna say you're
[2:00:50] gonna come to jesus and you're gonna
[2:00:51] have no issues no you're gonna have to
[2:00:53] pray through something
[2:00:55] you're gonna have to pray through
[2:00:56] something
[2:00:58] but i can tell you this it's i i rather
[2:01:00] if i'm gonna go through in this life i'd
[2:01:03] rather go through
[2:01:04] with jesus
[2:01:07] then without him
[2:01:10] i encourage you just give god your all
[2:01:13] surrender all
[2:01:15] get into that city of refuge which is

[2:01:24] something else i want to share but i
[2:01:26] have to just let it be
[2:01:27] i used to live a life where i didn't
[2:01:29] know whether i was going to make the
[2:01:30] rapture or not
[2:01:32] i ain't know
[2:01:33] i remember
[2:01:35] one time having a dream and
[2:01:37] and uh and in the dream this train was
[2:01:40] coming and
[2:01:41] you know the train was uh and i felt
[2:01:42] like that train represented the rapture
[2:01:45] and i wasn't on the train
[2:01:47] i was going to church every week but i
[2:01:49] wasn't on that train
[2:01:51] and i said lord jesus i'm going to miss
[2:01:53] it lord i need to i need to i need to
[2:01:54] get my heart right god i need i need to
[2:01:57] i get need to change some things i need

[2:02:07] need this lord
[2:02:08] god you got to change me you got to do

[2:02:11] thing you know a cousin of mine called
[2:02:13] me said jack i had a dream it was a
[2:02:15] train and i saw you on the train i say
[2:02:18] praise god
[2:02:20] amen i had i had i have found some
[2:02:22] refuge
[2:02:24] i got things right with god
[2:02:26] and i knew he was pleased
[2:02:28] with the life that i was living
[2:02:32] want to be pleased with the life that
[2:02:33] you're living that life has got to be
[2:02:34] according to his word
[2:02:36] society has taught us all kinds of
[2:02:38] things and those things that society has
[2:02:39] taught us against the word of god
[2:02:44] we can't live in sin and die and go to
[2:02:46] heaven
[2:02:48] we can't do that and and nowadays
[2:02:50] everybody you talk to that die
[2:02:52] everybody you talk to that die their
[2:02:55] relatives always say well they're in a
[2:02:58] better place are they
[2:03:03] you know hell was created for the devil
[2:03:05] and his angels and then the bible said
[2:03:08] hell hath enlarged its mouth and the
[2:03:10] reason hell got larger because more
[2:03:12] people wanted to go
[2:03:15] and if you live in sin you live in sin
[2:03:17] you're going to die and you're sin
[2:03:20] some of us want to try to take a chance
[2:03:22] that oh maybe right at my death lord
[2:03:24] forgive me you might not get that
[2:03:25] opportunity
[2:03:27] can tell you right now uh if sister
[2:03:29] wayson uh hadn't lived the life that she
[2:03:31] lived i don't think she would have had
[2:03:32] that opportunity it just came upon her
[2:03:34] just like that
[2:03:35] god took a just like that
[2:03:40] just like that
[2:03:41] so so you need to be ready why you got a
[2:03:43] chance why you got an opportunity
[2:03:46] get ready
[2:03:47] i want to invite you to come to the city
[2:03:49] of refuge
[2:03:52] and when you get there
[2:03:54] you got to be satisfied
[2:03:57] you can't be in the city of refuge talk
[2:03:58] about oh i remember the parties i used
[2:04:00] to go to
[2:04:01] i remember the time i used to have i
[2:04:03] used to when i hung on the corner i
[2:04:05] remember no you can't be in the city of
[2:04:07] refuge like you know why because what
[2:04:09] happened
[2:04:10] is if you start thinking that way
[2:04:13] next thing you know
[2:04:14] the enemy will pull you out the city
[2:04:16] refuge and you know what the high priest
[2:04:18] ain't dead yet
[2:04:20] so that avenger has every right
[2:04:23] to come against you and slay you
[2:04:26] you got to get in the city
[2:04:28] stay in the city
[2:04:30] and be satisfied
[2:04:34] in the city
[2:04:36] lord i don't want the things of the
[2:04:38] world i don't want to act like the world
[2:04:40] oh glory to god like they talked about
[2:04:42] sister wasted on yesterday say
[2:04:45] what i think it was the nephew said
[2:04:46] they'd never seen her in a pair of pants
[2:04:49] got other other family members just like
[2:04:51] that and when and she go to the the
[2:04:53] people this is her boss

[2:05:58] that
[2:06:00] on others there is a city you can go to
[2:06:04] you can find peace that you never found
[2:06:06] before

[2:07:20] it don't have to be uh
[2:07:24] some major event
[2:07:27] it's just believing on christ
[2:07:31] bible says here in john 5 24 says verily
[2:07:33] verily i say unto you he that heareth my
[2:07:35] word
[2:07:38] and believeth on him that sent me
[2:07:40] hath everlasting life
[2:07:42] and shall not come into condemnation but

[2:07:51] walk according to your word
[2:07:53] repentance god forgive me of my sin i
[2:07:55] can't ask you for somebody else but i
[2:07:57] can talk about me forgive me of my sin
[2:08:00] and then give me strength to walk
[2:08:01] according to your word and i'm going to
[2:08:03] tell you something when you repent god
[2:08:04] don't hold god don't hold nothing
[2:08:06] against you and since god don't hold
[2:08:08] nothing against you i can't either
[2:08:12] when you repent you repent and you just
[2:08:13] move on we all move on
[2:08:16] but god just want to know want to make
[2:08:17] just
[2:08:18] it's got to be true sincere repentance i
[2:08:21] made it to the city of refuge

[2:08:28] i want to stay right here i'm satisfied
[2:08:31] with jesus
[2:08:32] i'm satisfied
[2:08:35] let's pray
[2:08:41] lord your word has gone forth
[2:08:46] it's not by accident that hearts are
[2:08:47] here to hear what has been spoken even
[2:08:49] those that are online it's not by
[2:08:51] accident you don't make mistakes
[2:08:56] god you know what pleases you
[2:08:59] you've written it in your word
[2:09:01] and all we got to do is follow what has
[2:09:02] been written in the word of god and
[2:09:04] live according to that
[2:09:08] my prayer today father is that you would
[2:09:10] bring
[2:09:12] fruit from the thought
[2:09:15] you god would get the glory and that you
[2:09:17] would get the honor that you would
[2:09:19] set every captive free
[2:09:22] we don't have to we might have come in
[2:09:23] here bound but we don't have to leave
[2:09:24] the same way even now
[2:09:26] in our hearts we could just have a
[2:09:29] conversation with you god i don't want
[2:09:30] to live this way
[2:09:32] ma i'm just thinking of this quote i
[2:09:34] just didn't get a chance to read and
[2:09:37] there's some people lord that just don't
[2:09:39] want to live the way that they're living
[2:09:42] they really don't want to do that god
[2:09:44] that is not brother branham say i feel
[2:09:46] sorry for them because i know that's not
[2:09:48] the way that they want to live
[2:09:52] because there's a place there's there's
[2:09:54] a hope
[2:09:55] uh there's a place of refuge that they
[2:09:57] can go to god that they don't have they
[2:09:59] can let off the pressure
[2:10:01] they can come they can run
[2:10:03] the bible says that the name of the lord
[2:10:05] is a strong tower the righteous run in
[2:10:07] and they are safe
[2:10:10] we can find that safety
[2:10:12] we can find that peace
[2:10:14] we can find everything we need god when
[2:10:16] we come to christ
[2:10:20] father i pray that somebody would find
[2:10:22] their way today lord
[2:10:24] even now that they would just yield
[2:10:25] themselves god to
[2:10:27] your perfect plan
[2:10:28] for their lives
[2:10:30] we give you the glory
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:33] we give you the honor
[2:10:36] we give you the praise
[2:10:38] it's in jesus name
[2:10:40] that we pray
[2:10:42] amen
[2:10:44] amen
[2:10:45] praise the lord
[2:10:46] amen
[2:10:56] let's finally just come and just close
[2:10:57] the saturday man on the day and
[2:11:00] just share a little bit about last
[2:11:02] weekend and just whatever the lord puts
[2:11:04] in your heart

[2:11:17] amen we serve a
[2:11:19] wonderful god
[2:11:20] you know i was just sitting back there
[2:11:22] thinking um
[2:11:24] it's just a blessing to be here
[2:11:28] this boy that is that sounded weak
[2:11:32] i don't know about y'all but it's it's
[2:11:34] you know i've often said this when we
[2:11:37] were in okeechobee that
[2:11:39] if it's any place i'd rather be it would
[2:11:42] be here with brother jack
[2:11:44] uh
[2:11:45] by growing kind of growing up
[2:11:47] spiritually knowing brother jack
[2:11:50] and knowing his nature one thing i know
[2:11:52] he's gonna stay with the word of god
[2:11:54] you know he used to be tough duff
[2:11:58] but uh he he's grown and he's seasoned
[2:12:02] and uh
[2:12:03] i just i just really appreciate them so
[2:12:05] much and stand for the word of god
[2:12:08] uh one thing about it when it when it
[2:12:10] just comes down anything just give me
[2:12:11] the word of god
[2:12:13] if i feel like he's just gonna
[2:12:14] compromise and everything i can't sit up
[2:12:17] under you
[2:12:18] because one thing i i've i've grown to
[2:12:21] realize it's gonna take the word of god
[2:12:23] to change us it's gonna take the word of
[2:12:25] god to rapture us
[2:12:27] and uh this is a place of peace it's the
[2:12:29] place of of growth and and maturity and
[2:12:33] no no matter no matter what we're going
[2:12:36] through i think that that we god has
[2:12:38] given us a word in this season that's
[2:12:41] transforming all of us i'm being changed
[2:12:45] my situation is being changed
[2:12:49] amen in spite of what what things has
[2:12:52] been i see change i see change in my
[2:12:55] home
[2:12:56] i see changes in me
[2:12:58] like like we we said you know we
[2:13:00] preached on last week i'm just saying
[2:13:02] this and get out of the way uh what we
[2:13:03] preached here determination
[2:13:06] and uh and preaching that i you know i
[2:13:08] brought up quite a few things and and uh
[2:13:11] i said you know what
[2:13:12] i have to change
[2:13:14] i can't live in the past
[2:13:16] i got to live in the future i got in and
[2:13:20] then changed sometimes it's not
[2:13:21] something that you talk about
[2:13:24] right right i know i know i know uh they
[2:13:27] they often say that women uh uh live by
[2:13:31] words i'm a man i don't live by words
[2:13:34] you you don't impress me with words not
[2:13:36] so much
[2:13:37] i i'm the type of person i like to see
[2:13:40] action and and i don't like
[2:13:42] just all the time just use words i like
[2:13:45] to show action
[2:13:47] there's got to be action but um
[2:13:49] i'll leave that alone cause i'm feeling
[2:13:51] like jack left a little something up
[2:13:53] here
[2:13:55] but uh uh uh on uh i just continue to
[2:13:58] pray for us uh also
[2:14:01] um we we're starting to get out and i
[2:14:03] supposed to be in arizona this weekend
[2:14:05] but
[2:14:06] god had other plans
[2:14:08] and uh so so we're here and uh we we
[2:14:11] just got uh meetings lined up in the
[2:14:14] future
[2:14:15] a couple of times a month we're trying
[2:14:17] to get out and just exercise the gift of
[2:14:20] god last week we were in sarasota i
[2:14:22] hadn't preached there and oh god i won't
[2:14:25] even say how long
[2:14:27] but uh god knows all things and had a
[2:14:29] wonderful time wonderful wonderful time
[2:14:33] um we preached on the uh
[2:14:35] determination
[2:14:37] and you know god
[2:14:39] the scripture said he confirms his word
[2:14:42] with signs followed and sometimes god
[2:14:44] confirms his word as a minister
[2:14:47] sometimes god allows you to say things
[2:14:49] and you don't even know you're just
[2:14:51] saying it and you just kind of going on
[2:14:53] you like this ain't even in my notes and
[2:14:56] nothing like this but i'm sad anyway
[2:14:58] and uh last weekend
[2:15:01] i just made a couple of just comments i
[2:15:04] can't even
[2:15:05] right now remember what prompted me to
[2:15:08] say it but it just kind of was in line
[2:15:10] of thought
[2:15:11] and uh after we got finished we got
[2:15:13] finished preaching
[2:15:15] um a sister uh
[2:15:17] uh got in the prayer line and she said i
[2:15:20] got
[2:15:21] a a
[2:15:22] praise report and a testimony
[2:15:25] and she said i i want to give god thanks
[2:15:28] she said um
[2:15:29] last night i was talking to my two
[2:15:31] daughters
[2:15:33] and uh
[2:15:34] she said a couple of things that you
[2:15:37] said bert batum
[2:15:39] i said to my daughters last night
[2:15:42] and one of them that i can remember is
[2:15:45] that she i was just talking about like i
[2:15:47] said i don't remember what prompted me
[2:15:49] but i was just talking about sometimes
[2:15:51] you know people can't see the forest for
[2:15:53] the trees because you ain't so
[2:15:56] so close but it's it's the people on the
[2:15:58] outside can just really see
[2:16:01] uh uh the forest and could just really
[2:16:04] see what you're going through and so she
[2:16:06] said uh uh
[2:16:09] i told my daughter the exact same thing
[2:16:12] last night and then it was something
[2:16:14] else she told another daughter and she
[2:16:16] said when you said that
[2:16:19] i looked at you and they looked at me
[2:16:22] and they had to know that that was god
[2:16:24] because i didn't i don't even know the
[2:16:25] sister i don't remember her even going
[2:16:27] to sarasota so so
