[26:45] just kind of ramping up efforts to get
[26:48] everything open regard it's the

[31:11] may you use it for the furthest of your
[31:13] kingdom here on earth it's in Jesus name
[31:17] that we pray amen and amen praise Lord
[31:21] also I didn't want to thank everyone for
[31:23] their contributions towards some of the
[31:25] upgrades that we want to do with our
[31:28] sound
[31:29] the Lord has blessed a man I think we we
[31:32] have purchased there was a list that I
[31:35] saw that brother Quentin wrote and we
[31:38] might have had about seven or eight
[31:39] things on that list that we want to
[31:41] purchase and I want to say
[31:43] seven of the eight have been purchased
[31:46] already and then there is one last thing
[31:51] that we desire to do and and that is one
[31:56] additional microphone that actually is a
[32:00] clip own we got a be a blessed of
[32:03] brother Troy Troy stick it up here like
[32:08] this brother Quentin was sending text
[32:10] last week's like please tell brother
[32:12] Troy to pick up the mic brother you know
[32:17] so we got we got get a clip-on right but
[32:21] but the the type of clip-on mic that we
[32:23] were we had a couple that we about and
[32:25] and we when we bought them they just
[32:30] didn't last long we went the inexpensive
[32:33] route let's just put it at when they
[32:35] just didn't last long so this time we
[32:37] really want to get a good microphone and
[32:39] it will cost us you know that's why I
[32:41] said it's about four thousand dollars
[32:43] for all these things that we're gonna
[32:44] purchase but the the microphones are
[32:47] lasting and it's roughly about eight
[32:49] hundred dollars for this microphone that
[32:50] we're looking to get so that's the last
[32:54] thing that we want to purchase and after
[32:56] that I mean the cameras that we want it
[32:58] they're here we'll just need to install
[33:01] them there's some other things that we
[33:03] had to do that there's some new software
[33:05] that you all might not recognize yet but
[33:07] as we're as you're seeing the words on
[33:09] the screen that's new software because
[33:11] we upgraded the computer and then the
[33:12] software that we were using didn't
[33:15] working him over the upgrades so we had
[33:16] to buy some new software in order to get
[33:18] that get it back to where it was now we
[33:20] can add new songs and things like that
[33:22] so we you know we believe we've
[33:24] accomplished a lot this piano was
[33:26] accomplished and and I looked at all all
[33:29] this checklist something like Lord in
[33:30] the midst of a pandemic
[33:34] my God thank you Jesus so you know III
[33:40] know if God did all that he'll take care
[33:42] of the microphone as well so that that's
[33:44] our desire just to get the microphone
[33:46] and like I said it's about $800 and
[33:48] that's it a man for right now and our
[33:51] plan is to take all this into this new
[33:54] building that God got for us
[33:57] amen praise the Lord let me just give
[34:01] you an update on the building fund drive
[34:02] a man as to where we are and God is good
[34:07] to us God is good
[34:09] last year I'm sorry last month we
[34:13] receive donations of two thousand forty
[34:16] seven dollars a man for the building
[34:18] from donations of two thousand forty
[34:21] seven dollars and with that it has
[34:24] pushed us closer to our goal our goal
[34:26] was one hundred and five thousand
[34:28] dollars per year a man our pledges that
[34:31] came in towards that goal was sixty
[34:34] thousand nine dollars that those were
[34:36] the pledges and then what has been
[34:38] received year-to-date is seventeen
[34:41] thousand one hundred ninety two dollars
[34:43] and nine cent praise the Lord for that
[34:47] thank you Jesus
[34:50] and we also has still been gaining
[34:52] interest not much but we're still
[34:54] getting positive interest and and that's
[34:57] we've accumulated $276 an 8-cent on the
[35:01] interest and which just gives us a net
[35:04] because i I might you know I I just
[35:08] thank God that we haven't had to use all
[35:10] this time that we've been using it's
[35:13] been saving for the building for him we
[35:14] have not had to use one dollar towards
[35:17] amen our normal bills and god bless you
[35:22] and i believe that's because the the
[35:25] saints have a revelation there's three
[35:27] types of giving there's a man tithing
[35:29] that God requires of us he said give us
[35:32] give 10% of our earnings and we do that
[35:34] we don't sell chicken a man we don't
[35:38] wash cars we don't do anything we just
[35:41] pay our tithes and our offering and and
[35:43] those two separate things right so
[35:45] tithing is 10% offering is
[35:47] whatever you want to give to God right
[35:50] and because you have a embrace tithing
[35:52] and offering we have not had to borrow
[35:55] any money from the building fund in
[35:57] order to pay our normal normal bills God
[36:01] has been meeting that need every every
[36:03] every month and the other thing that God
[36:05] did at the beginning of this year I was
[36:07] I used to come and tell you how we we
[36:09] behind a little bit we've about three
[36:11] weeks behind on paying our rent
[36:13] but God has shifted it now we like two
[36:16] weeks ahead roll some lorry
[36:25] now wait knowing us now we walking up
[36:28] with the cheque in our hand and glory to
[36:31] God we'll see you next month God willing
[36:34] hallelujah
[36:35] no no and I'm glad about that I'm glad
[36:38] about that but on the other side with
[36:40] what we pay in rent I know we can afford
[36:42] a mortgage and my my faith is on the
[36:45] line that God is gonna provide for us a
[36:47] man of mortgage so thus far this year a
[36:50] man seventeen thousand four hundred
[36:52] sixty eight dollars and seventeen cents
[36:55] for our building fund and that's again
[36:57] that's for this year you all are aware
[37:00] that we have money from you know
[37:03] 2018-2019 and now in 2020 we voted on a
[37:06] three year plan and we at the end of
[37:09] this year that that's what we voted on
[37:11] so that's where we'll stop and God gonna
[37:14] do the rest
[37:15] amen you just do what you commit it to
[37:17] the Lord to do and then let God do the
[37:19] rest
[37:19] hallelujah amen that to me all this is
[37:23] positive a man hallelujah
[37:27] a man will praise the Lord all right
[37:31] well I that concludes that thank you
[37:33] musicians a man thank you very much we
[37:37] will prepare to go into the word of the
[37:41] Lord on today a man
[37:49] let me let me invite you to stand to
[37:59] your feet we'll just read a couple
[38:00] scriptures praise the Lord this morning
[38:08] thank you Jesus okay all right give me a
[38:18] second here something I want to do a
[38:20] little different today if the Lord would
[38:23] allow Swee are still in our journey a
[38:26] man here in catching the vision and you
[38:36] know I'm just picking up just a pretty
[38:39] much paragraph by paragraph as the angel
[38:42] Lord laid it out and I'm trying to
[38:44] gather inspiration on the on the on the
[38:48] various paragraphs so I thought it was
[38:51] very remarkable there's a quote that
[38:54] I'll read today that I believe connects
[38:59] very well with our American history and
[39:04] being that July 4th was just yesterday
[39:06] and Independence Day and things of that
[39:09] nature made me celebrate their
[39:11] independence and I thought that there
[39:13] was something that was very in the end
[39:17] in the prophecy there's something that
[39:18] just kind of connected and I what I plan
[39:23] to do today is it's just taking the time
[39:25] I just thought I got a number of notes
[39:27] so I won't rush through it a man but if
[39:30] whatever I don't finish I'm gonna preach
[39:33] the second service and finish it up in
[39:35] the second service so just bear with me
[39:37] a man on today and we just trust that
[39:39] the Lord will get all the glory and all
[39:41] the honor Amen from this so let's let's
[39:43] read from first Kings chapter 16
[39:48] Amen first Kings chapter 16 and i'ma
[39:56] start reading at verse 29 Amen on this
[40:03] praise God
[40:15] alright it says it in a thirty an eighth
[40:21] year of ASA king of Judah began a have
[40:28] the son of Omri to reign over Israel and
[40:31] they have the son of Omri reigned over
[40:34] Israel in Samaria 20 and two years and
[40:38] they have the son of Omri did evil in
[40:41] the sight of the Lord above all that
[40:44] were before him and it came to pass as
[40:48] if it had been a light thing for him to
[40:51] walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son
[40:54] that he took to wife Jezebel the
[40:58] daughter of eath bel king of the
[41:01] sidonians and went and served bel and
[41:04] worshipped him and he reared up an altar
[41:08] for belle in the house of bel which he
[41:12] had built in samaria have made a grove
[41:15] and they have dit more to provoke the
[41:18] Lord God of Israel to anger than all the
[41:21] kings of Israel that were before him a
[41:25] man my god what a I can't call it a
[41:31] legacy but what you know what statements
[41:33] are made by about this man amen as a
[41:36] leader so we want to just use that as
[41:39] our basis a man on today and I want to
[41:44] use a title of history is repeating
[41:47] itself a man history is repeating itself
[41:51] let's pray a man over the word of the
[41:53] Lord today father we thank you for your
[41:58] word God we thank you also for a prophet
[42:03] that had the ability to go into
[42:05] Scripture and show us things that we
[42:08] would probably never even look at God we
[42:11] are we're grateful that we could
[42:13] Fellowship around this this truth in
[42:16] this hour and my prayers that you would
[42:19] just give us revelation give us
[42:22] inspiration give us truth O God and for
[42:26] we all know the truth and the truth is
[42:29] is what sets us free so god take
[42:31] complete control over this portion of
[42:34] the service and may you get all the
[42:36] glory and all the honor from our
[42:38] gathering here those that are online
[42:40] speak to them right where they are
[42:42] minister to every heart into every meet
[42:44] god is our prayer it's in jesus name
[42:47] that we pray amen amen god bless you
[43:15] praise the Lord so we want to use a man
[43:18] for our title again history is repeating
[43:22] itself and if you just bear with me a
[43:27] little bit we want to just kind of take
[43:28] our journey through some things here the
[43:32] Prophet told us let's start a man in the
[43:35] sermon the rejected King a man this
[43:40] sermon the rejected King the Prophet
[43:43] makes this statement says there is not a
[43:45] man
[43:46] there is no son of Kish or no one else
[43:51] that can produce no one else can produce
[43:55] that outside of the leadership of the
[43:57] Holy Spirit but we have made schools we
[44:01] have made seminaries made organizations
[44:04] to satisfy and to look like the rest of
[44:09] the world now the Holy Spirit used to be
[44:12] the leader in this nation I liked the
[44:16] Holy Spirit used to be the leader in
[44:21] this nation you you it's impossible for
[44:26] people to still claim that we are a
[44:28] Christian nation amen we're no longer
[44:32] Christian nation with some of the things
[44:34] that we have done some of the laws that
[44:36] we have passed make us non-christian if
[44:40] we were a Christian nation we would
[44:42] still be following the principles of
[44:44] Scripture Christians follow Christ
[44:49] Jesus Christ and if we're not following
[44:52] his teachings we cannot call ourselves a
[44:55] Christian nation
[44:56] amen what what it is is that we're
[44:59] trying we're trying a man stand on what
[45:03] God did for the forefathers and God did
[45:05] some great things for the forefathers
[45:08] but it's a different day now and what I
[45:10] want I want you to understand God don't
[45:12] have grandchildren a man God has sons
[45:15] and daughters hallelujah glory to God so
[45:18] he says he says this that the
[45:22] the Holy Spirit used to be the leader in
[45:25] this nation this nation used to be
[45:29] governed hallelujah
[45:31] went back when they rode up the
[45:33] Declaration of Independence and there
[45:35] was an extra chair sitting there there
[45:38] is not one speck of doubt in my mind but
[45:42] what the Son of God said at the table
[45:46] there
[45:47] hallelujah a man he said sat at a table
[45:50] when this nation was founded upon the
[45:54] principles of freedom of religion
[45:56] hallelujah amen that God God was so a
[46:00] man particular about the u.s. being what
[46:04] it is that he had as he he had a very he
[46:07] had its very presence at the time that
[46:09] they were set out signing the
[46:11] Declaration of Independence I remember
[46:14] someone saying that on the $2 bill if
[46:16] you ever get one of those you can look
[46:18] on the $2 bill there was one man in the
[46:20] room with a hat on his head a man nobody
[46:22] else had a hat on his head and I believe
[46:24] they say I believe that was God Himself
[46:27] standing there trying to make sure that
[46:29] this nation became what it is today
[46:31] Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory
[46:35] glory even scripture speaks about this
[46:38] nation revelation 13 talks about this
[46:41] nation so it was very important for us a
[46:44] man to be established because the word
[46:47] there was promises in scripture that was
[46:49] written about this nation there's a lot
[46:52] of things that have happened in the
[46:53] nation that we're not happy with we're
[46:55] not we don't agree with but yet there
[46:57] were scripture promises that this nation
[46:59] would be a nation
[47:01] all right glory let's look at this he
[47:03] says uh-oh something that what the Son
[47:07] of God said in the table when this
[47:08] nation was founded upon the principles
[47:10] of freedom of religion and freedom to
[47:12] all hallelujah amen and upon the basis
[47:16] of God's eternal world word but we have
[47:19] corrupted that it was established on
[47:22] these things but we have corrupted that
[47:26] politics we have voted man in there on
[47:30] the buying and selling and promises of
[47:34] falsehood
[47:35] and one politician being able to keep
[47:38] his promise yes hallelujah not all of
[47:41] them but but here it says promises are
[47:44] for sir until our nation and our
[47:47] politics and our democracy is so
[47:50] polluted its into woven with communism
[47:54] and all kinds of isms we used to think
[47:58] we were democracy but it's in two woven
[48:00] Amen with communism and all kinds of
[48:03] isms the Prophet said this 1960 look he
[48:07] says in many times we call in two
[48:10] sessions for prayer when leagues of
[48:12] Nations meet in there to have
[48:14] discussions and in one great one great
[48:17] time recently there was not even one
[48:20] time called for prayer how are we ever
[48:23] gonna settle differences without pray we
[48:33] ain't got nothing fix until we get back
[48:36] on our knees and began to pray

[48:47] themselves and pray seek my face and it
[48:53] does not stop their turn praise God turn

[49:01] from heaven they will forgive their sins
[49:05] they will heal the land that's what we
[49:11] were built on hallelujah that's what
[49:14] made America America Jesus we don't have
[49:24] to get back to pride George Washington

[49:43] ever gonna settle differences without
[49:46] prayer how can we ever expect in all the
[49:50] world to ever do anything without the
[49:53] leadership of the Holy Spirit he says

[59:31] meet the ocean hallelujah amen there's
[59:34] some beautiful places in America and as
[59:37] the lady was just driving I mean driving
[59:38] on a train she say inspiration just
[59:41] struck her she just began to pin verse
[59:42] by verse what beautiful America was all
[59:45] about but she never actually found a
[59:48] tune for it she just had a poem that she
[59:50] wrote hallelujah and she published a
[59:53] poem on July 4th Amen I forget which
[59:55] year but was published in this say it
[1:00:00] was the poem was initially published two
[1:00:02] years later in the Congregationalists to
[1:00:04] commemorate the fourth of July and it
[1:00:06] quickly caught the public's fancy mine
[1:00:09] and another lap then the music came by
[1:00:12] it was composed by a man who was a
[1:00:14] church organist and a choir master
[1:00:18] Amen his name was Samuel a ward he was
[1:00:21] part of the Grace Episcopal Church in
[1:00:23] Newark New Jersey the two people never
[1:00:25] even met the lady that wrote the poem
[1:00:27] and the man that wrote the music neither
[1:00:30] one of those these two people met but
[1:00:32] yet their music came together his her
[1:00:36] lyrics and his music came together and
[1:00:38] it created this great patriotic song
[1:00:41] III appreciate moments like that and I
[1:00:44] hear
[1:00:45] I appreciate I appreciate it I
[1:00:47] appreciate it but I want to just say
[1:00:51] history's repeating itself there was a
[1:00:56] prophecy given over the land of America
[1:00:58] in 1787 by this gentleman his name was
[1:01:02] Alex Tyler he was a Scottish history
[1:01:05] professor at the University of Edinburgh
[1:01:07] and at the time of America's birth he
[1:01:11] wrote a warning to America in 1787 he
[1:01:14] says he observed that the average age of
[1:01:16] the world's greatest civilizations was
[1:01:19] about 200 years and during that during
[1:01:22] which they inevitably progress through
[1:01:24] the following sequence and this is where
[1:01:26] we are they start from bondage to faith
[1:01:30] hallelujah amen and when we think about
[1:01:33] some of my forefathers that couldn't
[1:01:35] worship and freedom there in Europe they
[1:01:38] were they came here to America so that
[1:01:41] could worship some of the Quakers and
[1:01:42] things like that they left there where
[1:01:44] they've been persecuted for their style
[1:01:46] of worship
[1:01:47] they came here for freedom of worship a
[1:01:49] man sort of go from bondage to faith but
[1:01:53] then they go from faith to courage when
[1:01:55] they were fighting for this land
[1:01:56] fighting for our independence
[1:01:58] that faith to courage to fight a man and
[1:02:01] from courage didn't they go to Liberty
[1:02:02] Liberty they will liberate it because
[1:02:05] they actually fought right and they're
[1:02:07] from Liberty they go to abundance and
[1:02:08] we've seen that a man here in the land
[1:02:10] of America when they go from abundance
[1:02:12] they then they go to a place of
[1:02:14] complacency and what complacency is it's
[1:02:18] self-satisfaction now I want to just
[1:02:21] read a quote I want to I'll stop it that
[1:02:24] abundance too complacent but I'll come
[1:02:25] back in and read a little bit more hey
[1:02:28] man I want to read a quote from the
[1:02:29] sudden secret going away of the church
[1:02:39] all right the Prophet says this so now
[1:02:42] that's the way the church ought to be
[1:02:44] watching for the coming of the Lord all
[1:02:48] in order already all packed up and ready
[1:02:51] to go as soon as it comes because it'll
[1:02:54] be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:02:56] just try to time
[1:02:59] longer would take your out of twinkle
[1:03:01] that's just how quick the rapture the
[1:03:03] church will take place you know that
[1:03:05] enemy always uses the tactics that the
[1:03:09] Lord uses you know when he's seeing that
[1:03:12] God was going to have a righteous church
[1:03:15] and the things that he was going to do
[1:03:18] the enemy used that same strategy look
[1:03:24] at this he's got a church he's got a
[1:03:28] people that's very religious hallelujah
[1:03:32] and they're just right on the toe as
[1:03:34] religious people because he knows that
[1:03:37] Christ Church is the same way and he
[1:03:40] does it out in military life look at
[1:03:44] what the prophets say he does it out in
[1:03:46] military life he says I was reading an
[1:03:49] article a man some time ago on the
[1:03:52] sudden attack on Pearl Harbor that was
[1:03:54] it no exactly an unknown attack he says
[1:03:58] they had already been warm that the Jets
[1:04:01] were going to do that
[1:04:02] but the sad part was they ignored that
[1:04:06] warning now I'm a just I'm gonna have to
[1:04:10] inject this because with us facing this
[1:04:13] virus I wonder have we been warned and
[1:04:17] if there was something other than other
[1:04:19] things that we could have done to
[1:04:21] prevent what has happened in our nation
[1:04:24] to prevent what has happened amen in the
[1:04:28] in the entire world hallelujah amen the
[1:04:31] numbers in Israel are very low they'd be
[1:04:36] something different praise God a minute
[1:04:40] like I said earlier we we got we got
[1:04:42] leaders that don't even care about the
[1:04:45] data they still pushing amen don't we go
[1:04:49] on a third face third phase is more
[1:04:51] people dying in Phase two than ever time
[1:04:54] and we're going foe it hallelujah amen
[1:04:59] it shows that we're at a particular
[1:05:01] stage oh god I don't want to talk about
[1:05:03] everybody here today but even our
[1:05:05] leaders don't want to wear masks
[1:05:08] amen hallelujah glory see you got access
[1:05:12] for different healthcare than we have
[1:05:14] praise the Lord somebody hallelujah oh
[1:05:19] mama
[1:05:21] we gotta watch these things there's
[1:05:22] spirits in the land a man look at what
[1:05:28] the Prophet says here now he says they
[1:05:30] had already been warned that the chaps
[1:05:32] were going to do that but the sad part
[1:05:34] was they ignored that warning they had
[1:05:37] seen science and the Japanese army
[1:05:39] assembling themselves together and the
[1:05:42] big ships being loaded with ammunition
[1:05:43] and the threat was in the air and they
[1:05:46] were just exactly in line for the
[1:05:48] invasion but they ignored it that's the
[1:05:51] way it is today with with the church the
[1:05:53] church is in line of judgment but they
[1:05:56] are ignoring the coming of the Lord
[1:05:59] you can't blame them now I told you to
[1:06:02] see what happens they go from abundance
[1:06:04] to complacency
[1:06:05] this is self-satisfaction feeling like
[1:06:07] amen that's so great there's nothing can
[1:06:09] happen to him hallelujah that's not a
[1:06:12] Titanic sunk hallelujah right and and I
[1:06:16] want to tell you this nation is headed
[1:06:17] towards judgment
[1:06:19] I'm just letting everybody know that
[1:06:21] right right now Israel when they got
[1:06:23] away from God went to judgment they were
[1:06:27] a blessed nation but they ended up in
[1:06:30] Babylon hallelujah somebody glory to God
[1:06:34] history has a strange way of repeating
[1:06:37] itself alright let's go forward here a
[1:06:40] little bit I want to you know brother
[1:06:43] Brandon made a comment there and amen he
[1:06:46] said how Satan like that mimic what God
[1:06:52] does and what he thought he knew that
[1:06:54] God would have a righteous Church so
[1:06:56] Satan built his own church hallelujah
[1:06:58] Satan build its own church now that that
[1:07:00] statement can be justified when you read
[1:07:03] a revelation chapter 2 in Revelation
[1:07:07] chapter 3 where he speaks to the
[1:07:08] churches there and and and and each age
[1:07:11] each age let's just start with the
[1:07:13] Ephesus age being the first age in at
[1:07:16] the end of age you say he that has an
[1:07:19] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:07:22] unto the churches now think about it
[1:07:26] if I'm oh if he's only writing to one
[1:07:28] Church in Ephesus
[1:07:30] why does the spirit say amen amen we let
[1:07:34] him here let Heda have the name let him
[1:07:35] hear what the spirit say to the churches
[1:07:38] ha-la-lu if he's only write a letter to
[1:07:40] one church remember you have the spirit
[1:07:43] says and he that hath an ear let him
[1:07:45] hear what the Spirit says to the
[1:07:46] churches
[1:07:47] hallelujah I want to make sure you get
[1:07:50] that because in each church age was both
[1:07:53] a false Church and a true church
[1:07:56] Satan was copying what God was doing
[1:08:00] throughout each age Satan was copying so
[1:08:04] here's a problem we get our eyes as
[1:08:07] Americans on the first church and we
[1:08:12] fail to see what God is doing in the
[1:08:14] true church we gotta keep our eyes on
[1:08:19] the church that staying with the word
[1:08:21] now you know why they call themselves a
[1:08:24] Christian nation I'm gonna read it to
[1:08:26] you in a quote and when you hear people
[1:08:29] saying we're Christian nation
[1:08:30] Amen we disagree that and God has
[1:08:33] blessed America it's the truth anyhow
[1:08:42] but you know I'm a little different than
[1:08:44] everybody I don't mind standing a man
[1:08:47] because I know that I've been blessed
[1:08:48] where I'm standing I hope you get what
[1:08:52] I'm saying I don't mind standing because
[1:08:55] I know I've been blessed where I'm
[1:08:56] standing I might not be able to live the
[1:08:59] life that I'm living had I been
[1:09:00] somewhere else
[1:09:02] praise the Lord but this nation afforded
[1:09:05] me the opportunities now yes I have been
[1:09:07] denied some but I choose not to look at
[1:09:10] when I was denied I choose to look at
[1:09:13] what I was given and the opportunities
[1:09:17] that I was given I have taken advantage
[1:09:19] of by the grace of God but when we look
[1:09:25] at this Christian nation I want to put
[1:09:27] it in quotes because it's a so-called
[1:09:29] Christian nation look at this in the
[1:09:33] Thyatira church age paragraph 2 26 - 1
[1:09:36] the Prophet makes this statement
[1:09:39] now why does God call these churches now
[1:09:43] that at the end of at the end of each
[1:09:46] Church agent says the spirit of Lord
[1:09:48] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:09:50] what the Spirit says until the churches
[1:09:52] stay stay with that quote I'm staying
[1:09:53] right there says let him hear he that
[1:09:56] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:09:58] saith unto the churches
[1:09:59] now brother Brandon's bringing some
[1:10:00] clarity on why the holy spirit of why
[1:10:03] God calls them churches look
[1:10:06] why does God call these churches his
[1:10:08] churches even though and I said why does
[1:10:12] God call these churches his churches
[1:10:15] even though they are the fine look say
[1:10:20] the truth of the matter is that they are
[1:10:21] Christians well what a statement this is
[1:10:25] what a prophet said about your America
[1:10:26] they are Christians but they are not
[1:10:32] they are not Christians of the Spirit ma
[1:10:37] they are Christians of the flesh they
[1:10:41] are being bearing the name in vain mark
[1:10:45] seven seven says howbeit in vain do they
[1:10:48] worship Me teaching doctrines the
[1:10:52] commandments of men we've gotten away
[1:10:56] from the commandments of God and now we
[1:10:59] have the commandments of me scroll this
[1:11:08] stuff I want to make a comment right
[1:11:10] there
[1:11:11] I just heard an article this week out in
[1:11:15] California they have banned for people
[1:11:19] to sing in church or chant in church so
[1:11:25] you can't sing or you can't chant in
[1:11:27] church that's a commandment for men it
[1:11:30] man because the Bible says to me sing
[1:11:33] unto the Lord brother Jimmy ready this
[1:11:37] morning zing-zing unto the Lord
[1:11:39] hallelujah the Bible also said clap your
[1:11:42] hands and shop with the voice of triumph
[1:11:46] so I told some brothers even if I have
[1:11:49] to use my master sing I'm gonna sing
[1:11:52] if I have to use my master shelf that
[1:11:56] I'm going to shout because that's a
[1:11:58] commandment from God he created me to
[1:12:01] praise Him
[1:12:02] look I'm not serving a silent card so
[1:12:06] I'm not gonna serve him in silence I
[1:12:08] hope you cope that I'm not serving a
[1:12:12] silent God so I'm not gonna serve him in
[1:12:15] silence I'm gonna give him his blue
[1:12:18] praise with the mass go without imma
[1:12:22] give God glory hallelujah somebody hey
[1:12:27] man we're not we're not we're not
[1:12:28] without we can't go with the
[1:12:30] commandments of me and y'all not even
[1:12:31] basing things on scripture anymore if
[1:12:34] you call yourself protecting the public
[1:12:37] well as you protect them like you forgot
[1:12:40] the words hallelujah if we just get God
[1:12:43] involved start praying over your
[1:12:46] decisions somebody in there that will
[1:12:49] pray and don't make no decision - you
[1:12:51] hear from God all right all right all
[1:12:56] right all right all right look at this
[1:12:59] now he says they are Christians are the
[1:13:03] flesh they're bearing the name in vain
[1:13:05] mark seven seven being in thing do they
[1:13:08] worship me teaching the doctrines
[1:13:10] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:13:12] of men but indeed they are Christians
[1:13:15] for what else could they be
[1:13:18] is the Mohammed and he said Muslim as a
[1:13:21] Muslim that is his religion no matter
[1:13:24] how he lives it because he subscribes in
[1:13:27] theory to what the Quran teaches
[1:13:31] hallelujah in the same way a Christian
[1:13:35] is a Christian as long as he as long as
[1:13:39] he subscribed to the fact that Jesus is
[1:13:43] the Son of God born of a virgin was
[1:13:46] crucified and died and rose again that
[1:13:49] he is the savior of mankind see every
[1:13:53] knee gunbound every tongue confess that
[1:13:55] Jesus is Lord amen
[1:13:57] since in fact in the land of C&H there
[1:14:00] will be those who call themselves
[1:14:03] Christians but they subscribe
[1:14:06] to the fine qualities because they
[1:14:09] subscribe to define qualities of Jesus
[1:14:11] while reserving to themselves the right
[1:14:14] to deny his deity that's where we at
[1:14:18] church that's where we had Christian
[1:14:20] Scientists have done that already as
[1:14:22] well as multitudes who preached social
[1:14:26] gospel see everybody want to hear that
[1:14:28] they don't want the truth they want the
[1:14:30] social gospel he says he is a nominal
[1:14:33] Christian and belongs to the church but
[1:14:36] he is not a true or spiritual believer
[1:14:39] that kind of believer is one who has
[1:14:42] been baptized into the body of Christ
[1:14:44] and it's a member of him but nonetheless
[1:14:46] it is in God's order that the tears grow
[1:14:50] up with the weeks and they are not to be
[1:14:53] uprooted hallelujah that is the command
[1:14:56] of God their day for binding and burning
[1:14:58] is coming but not yet now go on in this
[1:15:01] quote he says so the Spirit is speaking
[1:15:03] to this mixed group on the one hand he
[1:15:06] is praising on the other on the other he
[1:15:09] is rebuking he has told what is right
[1:15:11] with the true believer now he warms what
[1:15:14] the false vine must do if it is to stand
[1:15:17] justified before the Lord so as you read
[1:15:20] in revelation 2 in Revelation 3 and you
[1:15:22] get towards the end of each age and you
[1:15:25] see that that verse of says he that hath
[1:15:27] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:15:29] saith unto the churches
[1:15:30] realize he's talking in the midst of
[1:15:32] each age there is a true group and there
[1:15:35] is a false group the true group is
[1:15:37] identified by the blessings that they
[1:15:39] receive amen the false group is
[1:15:41] identified by the rebuke that it
[1:15:43] receives unless you're reading between
[1:15:45] the lines you'll you'll think it's just
[1:15:47] one church hallelujah glory to God but
[1:15:50] it's actually a false church and a true
[1:15:51] church into woven together and that's
[1:15:55] what we have here in the US we're they
[1:15:57] call themselves Christian because they
[1:15:59] they believe that Jesus was the son of
[1:16:01] God they believe that he was born to a
[1:16:03] virgin they believed that he died and
[1:16:05] rose again they believed all that but
[1:16:07] they're refusing to follow his word
[1:16:09] hallelujah glory to God alright let's go
[1:16:13] on here a little further now this is
[1:16:16] coming from the sermon spoken words
[1:16:18] original see part two
[1:16:19] a man this is a continuation of our
[1:16:24] thoughts a man this is where the angel
[1:16:26] wrote to told the Prophet to write and
[1:16:29] and we're picky picked up his pen he
[1:16:30] wrote and this is another part of the
[1:16:32] thought and I look at this he says God
[1:16:35] has promised be careful God has promised
[1:16:39] Malachi for for this last date and
[1:16:41] Malachi for has not yet been fulfilled
[1:16:43] we read this last week since but it must
[1:16:45] be fulfilled for it is a Dermatology
[1:16:51] prophet Jesus referred to it now before
[1:16:53] I go too far anybody that might read
[1:16:55] that quote and they'll say brother
[1:16:56] Branham said wonderful field so we're
[1:16:58] still looking for a messenger be careful
[1:17:00] all he just did was the same thing John
[1:17:02] the Baptist dude did John the Baptist
[1:17:04] they came and asked him are you the one
[1:17:07] hallelujah and John the Baptist said I'm
[1:17:09] not the one that was a prophet lying
[1:17:12] no he weren't lying he they had him as a
[1:17:15] different one hallelujah genre I'm not
[1:17:19] that one but I am one I'm the voice of
[1:17:22] one crying in the wilderness I look now
[1:17:24] get your scriptures lined up and you
[1:17:26] know where I fit hallelujah get your
[1:17:29] scriptures lined up you'll know where
[1:17:31] brother Branham fits Oh hallelujah glory
[1:17:34] to God look at this it says for it must
[1:17:37] be fulfilled for there's a German tires
[1:17:39] were dove God spoken through Malachi to
[1:17:42] prophet Jesus refer to it it is to be
[1:17:45] just before the coming of Christ the
[1:17:47] second time listen close now all
[1:17:49] scripture that has not been fulfilled
[1:17:52] must be before that time the Bible
[1:17:55] should be finished to be finished the
[1:17:56] Gentile dispensation is to be finished
[1:17:58] with the church age when it's anointed
[1:18:00] messenger arrives
[1:18:01] of course we'll plant the seed of the
[1:18:03] entire Bible plumb from the serpent to
[1:18:05] the messenger in the form of rain then
[1:18:08] he will be rejected by the
[1:18:09] denominational people as his forefather
[1:18:11] John and Elijah as was spoken by our
[1:18:14] Lord now look at this he goes and says
[1:18:17] people as Elijah was the first time to a
[1:18:20] half's time it will happen here in this
[1:18:23] country as this country is a type of
[1:18:27] people look at this he says read or hear
[1:18:30] Jezebel religion now he gave us a
[1:18:33] Oh clue there the profit injects that
[1:18:38] part read or hear Jezebel religion he
[1:18:43] says as this country our forefathers for
[1:18:46] worship the way they wanted to come to
[1:18:51] this country and pushed out the natives
[1:18:53] and took over
[1:18:54] so did Israel take over when they come
[1:18:56] up out of Egypt we act godly men like
[1:18:59] Washington Lincoln they had great godly
[1:19:03] men as David and so forth then they got
[1:19:05] an a hab on the throne with the Jezebel
[1:19:07] behind him to direct him so have we now
[1:19:12] when the probably you so have we that's
[1:19:14] a statement a man that's not something
[1:19:17] that we're looking for in the future
[1:19:18] something that's already occurred hmm I
[1:19:20] want to go to our PowerPoint Amen slide
[1:19:26] there if I can and I'm gonna try to do
[1:19:30] this I wouldn't just do something a
[1:19:31] little different by God's grace here the
[1:19:35] Angels is telling us just as Elijah came
[1:19:38] to the first time in a half's time the
[1:19:42] country was in some trouble
[1:19:44] I mean Israel was in some color some
[1:19:46] trouble and God decided to send the
[1:19:48] Prophet he lives at the time to try to
[1:19:49] get him straight now I want us to just
[1:19:52] kind of look at this just for a little
[1:19:53] bit of a campus
[1:19:54] he says when we compare Israel to the
[1:19:59] u.s. a man this is what we're doing a
[1:20:02] prophet picked us up in and no doubt a
[1:20:05] man I would also say that there probably
[1:20:07] other countries out there that could
[1:20:09] pick up the same thing and see how their
[1:20:12] countries are tied into the scripture
[1:20:13] now I don't know if they can pick up
[1:20:15] revelation 13 the way America can
[1:20:17] hallelujah but they're there other
[1:20:19] similarities how they how they might
[1:20:21] take their country in tune with Israel
[1:20:23] now the Prophet says this the first
[1:20:26] thing here is Israel left Egypt to
[1:20:29] worship in freedom hallelujah now if you
[1:20:32] remember they were coming out of coming
[1:20:35] out of Egypt and and they they did all
[1:20:37] these plagues and everything down in
[1:20:39] Egypt hallelujah glory to God all those
[1:20:42] plagues was going on in Egypt but those
[1:20:44] that were in Goshen never felt a thing
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:47] they fail to follow what the Prophet was
[1:20:49] telling them then they then they was in
[1:20:51] trouble but how if they stayed with what
[1:20:53] the Prophet said they never felt a thing
[1:20:55] in goshen lorry to God hallelujah we
[1:20:57] found ourselves in Goshen again a man
[1:21:00] and I'm claiming it by God's grace I'm
[1:21:04] claiming it for the Bride of Christ amen
[1:21:06] we found ourselves in Goshen we find
[1:21:08] ourselves in the secret place of the
[1:21:11] Most High we find ourselves there glory
[1:21:14] to God that's why the police can't touch
[1:21:15] us even if a symptom came I I want to
[1:21:20] encourage you buying that symptom in the
[1:21:22] name of Jesus don't you accept the
[1:21:25] package that the devil sent unto you
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:28] even if you come in contact with it
[1:21:30] begin to bond that devil in the name of
[1:21:33] Jesus
[1:21:33] now this is not just a pandemic these
[1:21:37] are Penn demonics that's where the
[1:21:40] prophet called ipam demonic these are
[1:21:43] deem is trying to attack the people of
[1:21:45] God so buying those Devils in the name
[1:21:47] of Jesus but here when they were coming
[1:21:50] out of Egypt here our Pharaoh Tom said
[1:21:54] now look I'm gonna give you I'm gonna
[1:21:56] give you three days to go and worship
[1:21:57] your God and come back and said no no we
[1:21:59] not going to worship and come back and
[1:22:01] we're not doing this we're not doing
[1:22:02] that
[1:22:03] we're leaving each we got God got a
[1:22:05] promise that forth so they was leaving
[1:22:07] amen because they wanted this freedom to
[1:22:10] express themselves to God and worship
[1:22:11] they didn't have a temple down in Egypt
[1:22:14] praise God they didn't have a special
[1:22:17] place that they could go a man and just
[1:22:19] freely worship down in Egypt but when
[1:22:21] they got into the promised land these
[1:22:23] things were established for them they
[1:22:25] meant freedom of religion now here a man
[1:22:28] here in the u.s. our forefathers left
[1:22:31] for left left the the the Europe amen in
[1:22:36] order to come here to the US for freedom
[1:22:39] of worship a man they wanted to live in
[1:22:41] freedom they wanted freedom of worship
[1:22:42] but Quakers one of the the Billy didn't
[1:22:44] worship the way God a man I had given
[1:22:47] him the worship these Quakers were a men
[1:22:49] also considered like shakers the Holy
[1:22:51] Spirit was on these people they were
[1:22:53] shaken and just do all kinds of things
[1:22:55] but but yet they wanted this freedom to
[1:22:57] express themselves they were coming out
[1:22:59] from amen
[1:23:00] pressed another Catholic Church they
[1:23:02] were coming out from a man a lot of
[1:23:04] stuff that was happening with a man with
[1:23:05] Catholicism and didn't even and when
[1:23:07] Luther being raised up and standing
[1:23:09] against some of those things I mean they
[1:23:10] were coming out during that time so they
[1:23:12] come with with an expectation that they
[1:23:14] would have this freedom of religion this
[1:23:17] is a comparison hallelujah the angel
[1:23:21] picks up this next statement and it says
[1:23:25] they are they pushed out the needles now
[1:23:31] when children Israel went into the
[1:23:32] promised land
[1:23:33] my they defeated all the natives that
[1:23:36] were there there were other people
[1:23:38] living in the land but because of their
[1:23:41] sin God said we go for I'm gonna bring
[1:23:43] my people in they're gonna have to take
[1:23:45] this thing now you know they took the
[1:23:47] land little by little
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] hallelujah somebody and it's the same
[1:23:54] way to us dear
[1:23:55] when they come in and landed on one
[1:23:57] coast little by little they expanded
[1:24:00] today game the entire United States they
[1:24:03] push today the south they push the
[1:24:05] Indians out they had this thing a man it
[1:24:09] was during the winter months they call
[1:24:10] it the Trail of Tears they had these the
[1:24:13] Indians that were here and wasn't even
[1:24:16] didn't even have the clothes to to take
[1:24:18] this this highway that was made
[1:24:20] direction makes it only only on as they
[1:24:22] took the Trail of Tears to go go west
[1:24:24] leaving these South leanings going west
[1:24:27] many of them died on the journey
[1:24:31] kids kids lost their lives because a man
[1:24:34] they got struck with a plague or they
[1:24:36] just didn't have the clothes to get to
[1:24:37] to get through the winter hallelujah
[1:24:40] amen the same way many are died in
[1:24:42] Israel they had many battles and and and
[1:24:45] and there in Jericho the walls came down
[1:24:47] and God was giving them their promised
[1:24:50] land hallelujah Israel I mean what was
[1:24:54] going on in Israel we see an exact Amen
[1:24:56] a comparison to what was happening in
[1:24:59] the US but you know also when you read
[1:25:02] the scriptures in Joshua there were
[1:25:04] certain people that never left the
[1:25:06] promised land
[1:25:07] the children Israel never got rid of
[1:25:10] them they stayed there hallelujah
[1:25:13] which I thought was a perfect type
[1:25:15] because here even in Florida glory to
[1:25:20] God we had a group of Indians that can
[1:25:24] call themself the Unconquered hallelujah
[1:25:29] we need a group of Christians that will
[1:25:32] call themselves the Unconquered no
[1:25:36] matter who come against them no matter
[1:25:38] what come against them they refuse to be
[1:25:41] conquered up here we know where to take
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:48] we're gonna take them down into the
[1:25:50] swamp man y'all wanna fight come down
[1:25:55] here to the swamps and they took they
[1:25:57] led these generals right down into the
[1:25:59] swamp and when the generals got down
[1:26:01] there and thought he was just fighting
[1:26:03] Indians but they were fighting Crockett
[1:26:05] I mean alligators and they were fighting
[1:26:07] snakes and fighting everything else they
[1:26:09] got their troops and got out of there
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:17] they refused to allow them to come down
[1:26:19] and conquer them
[1:26:20] they got a big ol place down the South
[1:26:24] down in Miami area where they don't
[1:26:26] conquer Indians they celebrate that we
[1:26:28] never got conquered and we still here
[1:26:32] today
[1:26:32] two hundred and something years later we
[1:26:35] still on our land
[1:26:36] generation after generation because
[1:26:39] there are conquered we need Christians
[1:26:42] understand like that generation after
[1:26:45] generation standing for God refused to
[1:26:49] be conquered by the devil that's the
[1:26:53] best freedom you can ever have as
[1:26:55] freedom from Xion glory to God
[1:26:58] hallelujah they were on conquered but
[1:27:01] yet you know that the same thing
[1:27:03] happened they push back the natives in
[1:27:06] Israel they push back the natives win
[1:27:08] Amen our forefathers came here all of
[1:27:11] this but they had to be that way glory
[1:27:13] to God now you know there's so much
[1:27:16] happening in our land today you know we
[1:27:19] can't call certain names we can't do
[1:27:22] this I heard something that you can't
[1:27:24] call it master bedroom anymore
[1:27:28] that's what I heard
[1:27:29] you can't call it the master bedroom
[1:27:31] anymore hallelujah just call it the big
[1:27:33] bedroom or something but don't call it
[1:27:37] master bedroom we we know I understand
[1:27:39] what people trying to do but I think the
[1:27:41] level of sensitivity is a little bit too
[1:27:43] high
[1:27:44] it's a little bit too high a man I'm not
[1:27:47] offended that somebody calling it the
[1:27:49] master bedroom it doesn't bother me like
[1:27:53] it bothers somebody else
[1:27:54] hallelujah but there's a lot of things
[1:27:56] changing a man different sports teams
[1:27:58] have to change their names right because
[1:28:01] people have taken offense level way too
[1:28:03] high glory to God right but by here you
[1:28:08] know these are the the summoner's its
[1:28:10] history amen some of this is its history
[1:28:14] and and I'll tell you like I said
[1:28:17] earlier I'm identified with a glory and
[1:28:19] a shame
[1:28:19] I'm identified with the true Americans
[1:28:22] I'm identified with the Unconquered they
[1:28:26] met when I heard they story I got
[1:28:28] inspired what darling
[1:28:31] y'all did not face the Trail of Tears I
[1:28:34] ain't facing no Trail of Tears either
[1:28:39] I'm gonna be on conker but this is not a
[1:28:42] man some political thing this is I'm
[1:28:45] talking about the devil
[1:28:46] I refuse to be conquered by bedeviled
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:50] glory to God but here you know we see
[1:28:53] these things a man and this other
[1:28:58] statement that the Prophet makes it says
[1:29:04] in Israel God raised up in that nation
[1:29:08] great leaders like David hallelujah
[1:29:13] hallelujah brother branham call them say
[1:29:16] and not only brother Brandon but the
[1:29:17] angel said this says great leaders like
[1:29:20] David etc was raised up and here in this
[1:29:24] nation men like Washington and Lincoln
[1:29:27] were raised up hallelujah now they bring
[1:29:31] out all the dirt on George Washington
[1:29:33] and when they start bringing out the
[1:29:35] dirt on you a man you no longer good
[1:29:38] leader
[1:29:40] let me tell you something everybody
[1:29:41] needs Jesus George Washington needed
[1:29:44] them Abraham Lincoln need them you'd
[1:29:45] need them but you've still a greater
[1:29:50] president and what we're seeing because
[1:29:51] they say I mean in the quote nine
[1:29:53] weather quote said Amen we had godly men
[1:29:57] like Washington and Lincoln they had
[1:30:00] great godly men as David and so forth
[1:30:02] then they got an a HAP on the throne
[1:30:06] with a Jezebel behind them now in order
[1:30:12] to understand what the Prophet said he
[1:30:13] told you go back to Jezebel religion so
[1:30:16] what you're gonna need to do is go
[1:30:17] listening to Jezebel religion and then
[1:30:19] you understand what was in the prophets
[1:30:21] spirit right I mean he was so messed up
[1:30:24] in his spirit when he was trying to
[1:30:26] preach that sermon Jezebel religion he
[1:30:28] told he can might come out at the
[1:30:29] beginning say he say I don't even want
[1:30:31] to stay in a hotel again he says last
[1:30:34] night so much seeing going on in the
[1:30:36] hotel and they called itself Christians
[1:30:38] you say safe stuff that you see all over
[1:30:41] the floor of what they've done that is
[1:30:44] ungodly accident done order sounds and
[1:30:46] stuff you hear in your bedroom I say hey
[1:30:48] I couldn't even sleep say I need to
[1:30:50] bring a tent and sleep out in the
[1:30:51] wilderness didn't come in and preach
[1:30:53] here he said I couldn't even sleep last
[1:30:55] night
[1:30:55] he said I'm not staying in a hotel no
[1:30:57] more now you can't you imagine a prophet
[1:30:59] coming with his dander up like that and
[1:31:01] then preaching Jezebel religion
[1:31:04] hallelujah
[1:31:05] see the devil the devil put the devil
[1:31:08] made him so upset that it caused him to
[1:31:11] preach harder hallelujah I thank God for
[1:31:15] it
[1:31:15] right but he was saying he was saying a
[1:31:17] lot there he was talking about the
[1:31:19] current president that was in a man in
[1:31:21] in an office at that time and he was
[1:31:23] saying say this president is a Catholic
[1:31:26] president and since he's a Catholic
[1:31:28] president that makes us a Catholic
[1:31:30] nation if the leader is Catholic than
[1:31:34] the rest of us are Catholic hallelujah
[1:31:37] that's what he was saying Jezebel
[1:31:40] relates the story said they say some
[1:31:41] coming is it's here right now and I'm
[1:31:45] telling you right now the Catholic
[1:31:46] Church got some real in roots when it
[1:31:49] comes to our politics
[1:31:54] all right me like David raised up a
[1:32:00] great leader like David mighty man like
[1:32:02] Washington and Lincoln were raised up I
[1:32:04] looked at that David overcame Goliath
[1:32:09] David was anointed by God to be king but
[1:32:15] before he became king he went out to
[1:32:17] battle as a warrior before he became
[1:32:24] king he went out to battle as a warrior
[1:32:28] before Washington became president he
[1:32:33] went out to battle as a warrior do you
[1:32:41] realize when David was frightened
[1:32:43] Goliath everybody was in fear this was a
[1:32:47] this was a enemy that was way larger
[1:32:51] than any man in the kingdom of Israel
[1:32:53] and when Washington was fighting the
[1:32:56] British Army his troops was way less
[1:32:59] than what the British Army was bruised
[1:33:01] bringing over here he had no chance at
[1:33:03] all but he went out by faith Oh
[1:33:07] hallelujah Church when I by faith the
[1:33:10] same way Dave went out David's a little
[1:33:13] I've know this guy bigger than I am a
[1:33:15] man he's been a warrior a lot longer
[1:33:18] than I've been

[1:37:36] get hit God was protecting that man at
[1:37:40] that time hallelujah God was protecting
[1:37:43] the first president he wasn't even
[1:37:45] president just like David was not King
[1:37:48] George Washington was not president but
[1:37:51] yet he was fighting in the battle you
[1:37:54] say don't turn guys don't turn everybody
[1:37:57] don't retreat but let's press for say
[1:37:59] one one guy wrote in this book he says
[1:38:01] I've never seen such courage from a man
[1:38:04] he said say something just took over me
[1:38:06] at that time he said look he said if we
[1:38:08] don't win i'ma die trying
[1:38:11] i'ma die trying with a man willing to
[1:38:14] lead like that hallelujah glory to God
[1:38:19] he not leaders like brother branham
[1:38:22] talked about squirt a little water here
[1:38:24] squirt a little water there no here's
[1:38:27] the leader that went to the head
[1:38:29] of the ladder winner axe in his hand
[1:38:32] come on boys this is the way into the
[1:38:35] enemy's camp because of George
[1:38:39] Washington's courage bullet holes in the
[1:38:46] jacket but he never got hit i'ma tell
[1:38:49] you when God has something for you to do
[1:38:51] your purpose your purpose is your
[1:38:58] protection they say bring back me like
[1:39:03] that man either go to the battle may not
[1:39:09] a fight in the battle not just me Aneta
[1:39:11] sing your children the battle come on
[1:39:15] somebody
[1:39:16] we won't men like that men with a
[1:39:18] principle fight for a principle and by
[1:39:23] the time George Washington got to the
[1:39:25] troops they was they was outnumbered but
[1:39:28] yet they had a courage they had a faith
[1:39:32] that if George Washington do this we're
[1:39:33] gonna go we gonna take this army that we
[1:39:35] gonna take this army down they went out
[1:39:37] there and took the army down and and is
[1:39:39] at that point in time the Britons
[1:39:41] surrendered so you know and not not only
[1:39:43] not only that there were other nations
[1:39:46] that were coming to help the British but
[1:39:49] when they heard about what George
[1:39:50] Washington did they turned on the
[1:39:52] British if you look back in Israel's
[1:39:58] history there was other nations that got
[1:40:00] up and left there was one that was
[1:40:01] facing David and they realized how he
[1:40:04] was being routed they got up and left
[1:40:05] the other army ain't no way we're gonna
[1:40:07] do nothing like this when it took off
[1:40:09] running back to the country Louise see
[1:40:11] when God got something for you there's
[1:40:13] nothing that can come against you a man
[1:40:15] see this is this is the beginning of of
[1:40:18] who we were a man as a as a as a nation
[1:40:21] there was one other statement here a man
[1:40:25] I was talking about how Washington stood
[1:40:26] in the midst and bullets curtains men to
[1:40:28] keep fighting in the battle a man his
[1:40:30] courage was contagious glory to God a
[1:40:33] man it's a great man great rate our
[1:40:41] great raised up nation would
[1:40:42] great leaders like David etc I put I put
[1:40:45] Solomon as a great leader because even
[1:40:48] Solomon he you know he fell in in and he
[1:40:51] did some things but there were some
[1:40:52] great things happened underneath a man
[1:40:54] his his time well when he was leading
[1:40:56] glory to God it caused the Queen of
[1:40:59] Sheba to come from the other most parts
[1:41:02] of the earth to see who this guy Solomon
[1:41:05] was he has he has some tremendous wisdom
[1:41:08] he reigned during a time of peace
[1:41:12] Solomon a man and his time was called
[1:41:15] the Golden Age and let me just read a
[1:41:17] quick quote on that a man this is a
[1:41:19] message a greater than Solomon is here
[1:41:22] glory to God they might just have to hit
[1:41:28] escape on that praise the Lord
[1:41:31] amen and I'll come back to it in a
[1:41:34] second but they're here in the greater
[1:41:36] than Solomon is here it says this then
[1:41:40] he come to Solomon in the days of
[1:41:43] Solomon says now give me your undivided
[1:41:45] attention for about 10 minutes in the
[1:41:48] days of Solomon it was a golden age God
[1:41:53] gave a gift to the earth it was a gift
[1:41:56] of discernment Solomon had discernment
[1:41:59] had a discernment
[1:42:00] how many knows that and he could discern
[1:42:03] because it was from God the Word of God
[1:42:06] was with Solomon he could discern well
[1:42:09] all the people rallied around that gift
[1:42:11] oh my and Aunty Minister knows that was
[1:42:14] Israel's Golden Age no wars and they
[1:42:17] built the temple and everything was at
[1:42:19] peace and everything because they
[1:42:21] received the gift that God sent and them
[1:42:23] days they didn't have television thank
[1:42:26] the Lord a man says the only thing they
[1:42:29] had to carry the news was from lip to
[1:42:31] ear and every caravan passing through it
[1:42:34] hear about this great gift they go they
[1:42:36] go over to Solomon's Church and look at
[1:42:39] it then go back and take it to the
[1:42:40] nation till his fame scatter
[1:42:43] everywhere and I will go back to that
[1:42:44] that's light and I'll just mix it all
[1:42:47] the way through till we get to a certain
[1:42:48] point but you know I was saying Sodom
[1:42:50] was a great leader at this time it was a
[1:42:53] golden age and brother bran was
[1:42:55] referring time where
[1:42:57] where he praise the Lord
[1:43:00] all right one more I think all right
[1:43:04] yeah so Solomon says great leader and
[1:43:06] this Queen of Sheba that's coming to a
[1:43:08] man that she heard about this dis famous
[1:43:11] something like you know what in my
[1:43:12] church these things ain't happening
[1:43:14] in my church it's a little dead a little
[1:43:16] dry we don't see the supernatural but
[1:43:18] I'm hearing all this supernatural move
[1:43:20] of the Spirit down there amen and we're
[1:43:22] solid was that she she decided to a man
[1:43:25] to take a journey it would be three
[1:43:27] months on the back of a camel that she
[1:43:30] would have to ride not only a man is she
[1:43:32] riding on on these cameras but she's got
[1:43:35] a great part in she's carrying with her
[1:43:37] and I brother ranch has a very difficult
[1:43:39] time trying to be doing this because as
[1:43:41] a woman that was a that was a difficult
[1:43:43] journey just as a woman but at this time
[1:43:45] they were robbed was a man in the in the
[1:43:47] dancer waiting for caravans like this to
[1:43:50] come and this lady a man if I if I
[1:43:52] recall correctly I believe the woman I
[1:43:54] was carrying a little over a million
[1:43:56] dollars almost by one point seven
[1:43:58] million dollars actually had that she
[1:44:00] was carrying two Solomon hallelujah can
[1:44:02] you imagine a woman coming to church
[1:44:04] with a check for 1.4 million and the
[1:44:08] reason that she wants to get her check
[1:44:10] is because she sees a mighty God unveil
[1:44:16] if when I get there this man does what
[1:44:20] what I've been told of this man can do
[1:44:21] I'm giving everything I got to support
[1:44:23] it she come and Solomon's there and you
[1:44:28] know she heard his wisdom she heard of
[1:44:30] all these things and and one of the
[1:44:32] wisest things that Solomon did was when
[1:44:34] these two women came to him talk about
[1:44:36] our you know we both had babies we were
[1:44:40] sleeping and at night this woman got up
[1:44:44] and she had killed her baby rolled over
[1:44:46] and killed and smothered to death she
[1:44:48] got up and took her baby put it
[1:44:50] underneath me and then took my baby a
[1:44:52] man for her and when I got up in the
[1:44:54] morning I saw that my baby was dead but
[1:44:55] I recognize this ain't my baby and it's
[1:44:59] later say that I killed my baby and she
[1:45:01] she trying to tell me she didn't do this
[1:45:02] we're the only two that was in the house
[1:45:04] King we need you to decide on this
[1:45:06] hallelujah Solomon already pray the axe
[1:45:09] God for wisdom
[1:45:10] amen because God said now I can make you
[1:45:13] rich I can do this I can do that but
[1:45:15] what do you want say just make me make
[1:45:16] me a wise man judge the matters
[1:45:19] of the people he say because you ask for
[1:45:21] the right thing I'm gonna make you
[1:45:23] popular and I'm gonna make you rich plus
[1:45:25] I'm gonna give you wisdom hallelujah if
[1:45:28] you ask God for the right thing you
[1:45:29] might get more actually the right spirit
[1:45:35] and the right attitude you might get
[1:45:36] more you're just watching to see how
[1:45:39] you're gonna respond glory to God soon
[1:45:43] as he acts the very next day he acts
[1:45:44] here comes this case in this woman
[1:45:46] untold his life Solomon say I tell you
[1:45:48] what and everybody looking at King what
[1:45:50] are you gonna do what are you under what
[1:45:51] hang on justice Kings they bring his
[1:45:54] sword
[1:45:55] bring him a sword get the king of swords
[1:45:58] bring me a sword and he got the sword in
[1:46:00] hand hallelujah it says now since we
[1:46:04] don't know who baby it is i'ma just
[1:46:06] split this baby in half and I'm gonna
[1:46:08] give you half and give you half and when
[1:46:10] it when he did that the mother of the
[1:46:13] baby say oh no give it a baby give her
[1:46:16] the baby I don't split the baby in half
[1:46:19] like that King give her the baby she can
[1:46:21] have the BAM
[1:46:22] I'm okay with it and then the other lady
[1:46:23] said no split the baby in half because
[1:46:29] you got some people that don't mind
[1:46:31] split in the church hallelujah while one
[1:46:35] is trying to keep it together you got
[1:46:36] another one trying to split it you got
[1:46:39] to watch those spirits you know who the
[1:46:41] real mother is you know who the real
[1:46:47] pastor is because the past thing trying
[1:46:51] to split the church just pastors trying
[1:46:53] to keep it again but the pastor will try
[1:46:55] to keep sin out of the church split the
[1:46:58] baby she said she said she said she said
[1:47:01] neither one was to have it see and
[1:47:03] Solomon said okay give her to baby we
[1:47:05] know who the mama is now because a mama
[1:47:07] wouldn't want to see her baby died
[1:47:09] Solomon with great wisdom was a great
[1:47:12] leader during that time over here it
[1:47:15] said mighty men like Washington Lincoln
[1:47:17] were raised up
[1:47:21] I put their President Lincoln lost his
[1:47:23] life because he was willing to stand
[1:47:26] against slavery President Lincoln was a
[1:47:29] man that when he looked out he said God
[1:47:32] may man but man may slaves
[1:47:36] hallelujah I want to read this quote
[1:47:40] from the Prophet and we'll close this
[1:47:45] section oh Jesus
[1:47:48] hey man this is not a message hear ye
[1:47:52] him President Lincoln lost his life
[1:47:58] because he did not agree with slavery it
[1:48:02] freed as many as he could and there were
[1:48:06] many that stood against him even at the
[1:48:08] time that he freed especially in Texas
[1:48:10] there was a problem in Texas they didn't
[1:48:12] let the people know that they were free
[1:48:13] hallelujah there's a new holiday that
[1:48:16] they celebrate Juneteenth June 19th
[1:48:19] because there was some blacks that was
[1:48:20] still down in Texas that was still bound
[1:48:23] and didn't realize that they were free
[1:48:25] what a spiritual type because there's
[1:48:28] people not just blacks I'm talk about
[1:48:30] all lives amen but there's many that's
[1:48:33] bound right now and don't realize that
[1:48:35] they're free glory to God God wants you
[1:48:41] to realize that yeah there's a freedom
[1:48:42] there's a there's an independence that
[1:48:44] you can declare from the devil the
[1:48:50] Prophet makes this statement and a
[1:48:51] message here you him
[1:48:52] it says years ago down the south when I
[1:48:56] used to take the colored people and sell
[1:48:58] them for slaves that never was right
[1:49:00] that's what the Prophet said he didn't
[1:49:03] agree with slaver either that never was
[1:49:06] right no sir
[1:49:08] God made man man made slaves they used
[1:49:13] to come and buy a used to come by and
[1:49:15] buy them poor people just like you would
[1:49:16] out here on the used-car lot just get a
[1:49:19] bill of sales and set them there used to
[1:49:21] be brokers that come by CDs see those
[1:49:23] people and they take those great big
[1:49:25] burly men away from their wife and breed
[1:49:27] them to a big a woman or something
[1:49:29] another and bring better bring a better
[1:49:31] set of slaves remember Abraham Lincoln
[1:49:34] when he took off his hat
[1:49:35] and pounded his hands like that said
[1:49:37] that's wrong and someday I'll hit it God
[1:49:41] give us a president like Abraham Lincoln
[1:49:42] again yes when he said that he was right
[1:49:47] it says I remember some time ago here in
[1:49:50] Illinois I was at a museum and I seen an
[1:49:54] old colored man going along there a
[1:49:56] little rim of hair a little rim of hair
[1:49:58] around that around the back of his head
[1:50:00] he was looking through a museum and
[1:50:03] after a while he stopped and he looked
[1:50:04] he stooped back and they began to cry
[1:50:07] and tears running down his face he was
[1:50:10] praying I watched him for a few minutes
[1:50:13] I walked up close to him I said how do
[1:50:15] you do uncle and he said how do you do
[1:50:18] I said I'm a minister I said I would
[1:50:21] just like to know why you were praying
[1:50:24] what excited you he said come here says
[1:50:28] looked in under a little glass and there
[1:50:31] later dress I said it's a dress I don't
[1:50:34] see nothing so upsetting about that
[1:50:37] wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't make a
[1:50:39] wouldn't make a man jump back and say a
[1:50:41] prayer now there's a lot that I could
[1:50:43] say there see brother branham had gone
[1:50:46] through what this man had gone through
[1:50:48] so he couldn't identify well why the man
[1:50:51] was acting the way that he was acting
[1:50:53] praise the Lord
[1:50:54] if you ain't going through what some
[1:50:56] people have gone through then you can't
[1:50:58] identify why they activated they act
[1:51:02] praise the Lord
[1:51:03] but our action should still be Christian
[1:51:08] hallelujah glory to God you know I was
[1:51:12] just sharing this with some friends that
[1:51:14] has asked me about you know just just
[1:51:15] what was this what I said look the first
[1:51:18] thing is you just got to admit certain
[1:51:20] things are wrong you got to admit that
[1:51:22] I'm not saying that the reaction is
[1:51:24] right but the first action was also
[1:51:27] wrong hallelujah don't justify the first
[1:51:30] action a man alleluiah it's like you
[1:51:34] know my child did something to my child
[1:51:36] hit your child now I know I didn't teach
[1:51:38] my child here all right and you bring my
[1:51:40] child your child hit my child okay all
[1:51:43] right okay I'll correct them you want to
[1:51:45] see me correct them I'll correct them
[1:51:46] but first tell me why
[1:51:48] my child hit your child tell me why well
[1:51:52] it's because my child hits your child oh
[1:51:54] is that right Johnny I want you to say
[1:51:59] sorry
[1:51:59] you'd be big enough to say sorry but I'm
[1:52:01] also expecting Mike to apologize all
[1:52:06] right I hope we understand a man we
[1:52:15] teach John apologize but we also teach
[1:52:18] John to defend himself praise the Lord
[1:52:22] all right a man he did turn the other
[1:52:25] cheek he took one too many punches all
[1:52:28] right i'ma leave that alone
[1:52:31] look at this he says look looked in
[1:52:35] under a little glass and there laid a
[1:52:37] dress I said it's a dress I don't see
[1:52:38] nothing so upsetting about that wouldn't
[1:52:40] make a man jump back and say it and say
[1:52:42] a prayer he said but look I still got
[1:52:47] the marks of a slave belt around me he
[1:52:50] said and that's the blood of Abraham
[1:52:52] Lincoln and the blood of Abraham Lincoln
[1:52:55] took that slave belt off of me wouldn't
[1:53:00] it excite you too brother Brown see I
[1:53:04] stood back and I said if the blood of
[1:53:08] Abraham Lincoln would excite a slave
[1:53:12] from taking a belt off of him what are
[1:53:15] the blood of Jesus Christ to do when
[1:53:18] it's pre power before a church that
[1:53:20] claims to be born again what should it
[1:53:24] do see it's greater than just the
[1:53:27] politics amen it's the spiritual part
[1:53:30] that we don't want to miss and and i'ma
[1:53:32] tell you the reason that we're in a
[1:53:33] condition that wins because spiritually
[1:53:35] we left God we forgot about God a man
[1:53:40] and in part two I want to show you some
[1:53:42] things where we left God hallelujah a
[1:53:44] man a man I believe there was a captain
[1:53:51] out on the sea got sick out there on the
[1:53:54] scene who's about to die and and you
[1:53:57] know they just begin to you know start
[1:53:58] talking to him about talking to him
[1:54:00] about Christianity
[1:54:01] you know you you know used to be a
[1:54:03] Christian yeah yeah I used to and I used
[1:54:05] to this so where did you leave God they
[1:54:08] say I think it was probably at the
[1:54:10] cradle say well you better go back to
[1:54:12] the cradle and get them right you better
[1:54:16] go back and get them and what we need to
[1:54:18] do is go back and get gone we left them
[1:54:20] somewhere along the journey we had men
[1:54:22] that pray man that fought with courage
[1:54:24] men that that stood with principle they
[1:54:26] declared certain things wrong and we're
[1:54:28] willing to give their life for it
[1:54:29] Abraham Lincoln gave his life for it
[1:54:31] hallelujah because it was wrong in order
[1:54:35] to be an American I have to be
[1:54:37] identified with a glory and with a shame
[1:54:40] amen I wouldn't I wouldn't trade living
[1:54:42] here I'm living anywhere else in the
[1:54:45] world I thank God to live here but I
[1:54:47] also know this nation is not a Christian
[1:54:50] nation not no more amen let's pray
[1:54:55] father we thank you for the word of the
[1:54:58] Lord that has been given to us Lord God
[1:55:04] and as we just continue forward in this
[1:55:06] journey we're talking about how history
[1:55:08] is repeating itself we can look at in
[1:55:10] history and Israel's day and look at
[1:55:12] history and in the u.s. God is repeating
[1:55:15] itself it's repeating itself but God
[1:55:18] help us Lord Jesus to be able to catch
[1:55:21] spiritually Lord and escape we don't
[1:55:26] have to be caught up in the midst of all
[1:55:27] this this stuff some seen as a wrap this
[1:55:31] men have forgotten God and because they
[1:55:34] forgotten God they're paying the price
[1:55:36] Israel had to pay the price lord I just
[1:55:39] pray that you'd help us Lord Jesus to
[1:55:41] realize that we don't have to be bound
[1:55:43] as sin and shame God it's the enemy that
[1:55:47] would love to keep us in that condition
[1:55:48] and Lord as I just read the story of how
[1:55:51] man was excited it caused him to cry
[1:55:54] when he just saw the the cloth that
[1:55:56] Abraham Lincoln was wearing and the
[1:55:58] blood that was on it it caused him to
[1:56:00] cry because he realized a man gave His
[1:56:02] life that he might go free and God help
[1:56:06] us to realize that you gave your life at
[1:56:08] Calvary's cross that we too might go
[1:56:11] free we don't have to live a man of life
[1:56:14] of
[1:56:15] a halfway Christian would be bound in
