[1:01:49] for service our giving is through cash
[1:01:53] app sale we also do accept it through
[1:01:56] PayPal but again we we mentioned uh
[1:01:59] PayPal does take fees out of it and uh
[1:02:03] oftentimes people having their heart
[1:02:04] that this is what I want to give but
[1:02:06] PayPal will take a portion of that and
[1:02:08] uh so we encourage you if you can go to
[1:02:10] cash app or Zale if you use cash app our
[1:02:13] handle is dollar sign spirit and truth t
[1:02:15] Zell our email is uh giving up
[1:02:18] john423.org those that are in the house
[1:02:21] of the Lord and you want to give we do
[1:02:23] have a box on the very back table you
[1:02:25] can just put your offering in there I
[1:02:27] forgot to say that last week and one of
[1:02:28] the brothers asked me after surgery
[1:02:29] brother y'all ain't take over it well uh
[1:02:33] actually I forgot to tell you that you
[1:02:34] could just give it in the back but but
[1:02:36] through cash app and Zell that's how we
[1:02:38] kind of do offering things change when
[1:02:40] covet came but uh but nonetheless
[1:02:42] actually I like it this way because in
[1:02:44] the Bible what do used to have is in the
[1:02:47] Old Testament they just had a box in the
[1:02:48] back that people would just give in they
[1:02:51] didn't have to stop the service and try
[1:02:52] to and do the offering so I don't like
[1:02:55] breaking anointing that's just me
[1:02:57] anything I can do to not break an
[1:02:59] anointing I'll do it amen I just the
[1:03:03] anointing is what breaks jokes and uh so
[1:03:06] an anointing come I just like to ride
[1:03:08] that anointing amen but this is uh just
[1:03:11] so that you're aware that uh this is uh
[1:03:13] if you hear you can just give him on the
[1:03:15] back also if you want to mail your
[1:03:16] offering certainly feel free to do that

[1:11:32] if he speaks to somebody that's what
[1:11:34] we're here for amen
[1:11:36] Isaiah chapter 60 and we'll just take
[1:11:39] the first three verses and of course
[1:11:40] it's a very familiar passage of
[1:11:42] scripture to the bride of Christ and
[1:11:45] Believers of this message the prophet
[1:11:47] says arise
[1:11:49] Shine for thy light is come
[1:11:53] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:11:57] thee
[1:11:59] amen now here's a side note side note is
[1:12:02] behold Darkness shall cover the Earth
[1:12:07] and gross Darkness the people
[1:12:09] but the Lord now back to the main
[1:12:12] message the Lord shall arise upon thee
[1:12:14] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:12:17] and the Gentiles shall come to thy light
[1:12:20] and Kings to the brightness of thy
[1:12:23] Rising amen what a message of light that
[1:12:26] we have today amen my my title this
[1:12:28] morning is look on the bright side amen
[1:12:30] could we have a word of prayer Heavenly
[1:12:33] Father we just thank you Lord for a
[1:12:35] positive gospel this morning Lord that
[1:12:37] Lord we can look into your word today

[1:12:44] encouragement Lord You've not given us
[1:12:46] the spirit of fear Lord or of worry but
[1:12:49] of a sound mind father for Lord You've
[1:12:52] ushered us into this age of Capstone
[1:12:53] love father and we have a personal

[1:13:06] the abilities of a man Lord for our
[1:13:08] abilities or frail Lord and in
[1:13:09] insufficient but Lord what we're looking
[1:13:12] for today Lord is for your Holy Spirit
[1:13:13] to come amongst us Lord with your
[1:13:15] quickening power Lord may you be the
[1:13:17] speaker of the word I pray father may
[1:13:19] you be The Interpreter Lord may you just
[1:13:22] open it up to every heart Lord in a
[1:13:24] personal way for we believe that you're
[1:13:25] still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:13:27] intents of the Heart Lord father in our
[1:13:29] human Minds Lord we struggle with doubts
[1:13:31] Lord we there are many there are many
[1:13:33] things Lord in the atmosphere of this
[1:13:35] world Lord which are warring with our
[1:13:37] faith Lord I think even as your Prophet
[1:13:39] Lord took the platform on time lord and
[1:13:41] he he spoke of waves of Doubt Lord that
[1:13:44] he would feel coming from the audience
[1:13:45] Lord waves of interference but oh father
[1:13:49] he spoke of wave after wave of Faith
[1:13:52] Lord wave after wave of your glory Lord
[1:13:54] Jesus that's what we're looking for
[1:13:56] father that you come amongst us Lord May
[1:13:58] there be a transmission of Faith Lord
[1:14:00] that could not be hindered Lord by the
[1:14:02] efforts of the enemy but father may we
[1:14:04] just worship you and fellowship with
[1:14:07] your lord word father with wave after
[1:14:09] way of your presence we pray we dedicate
[1:14:12] ourselves to you in the name of Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ amen God bless you as you're
[1:14:16] seated this morning
[1:14:18] amen just look on the bright side and so
[1:14:21] we've read this uh this very familiar
[1:14:24] scripture and of course brother Branham
[1:14:25] uses the scripture as the text of the
[1:14:28] message Shalom amen it's a message that
[1:14:31] was uh specifically to the Bride of
[1:14:33] Jesus Christ it was not to the public
[1:14:35] but it's our personal it's our if you
[1:14:38] will our private message that we receive
[1:14:40] from the Throne of God a message of
[1:14:43] Shalom now now uh to receive this
[1:14:46] message you have to receive it in the
[1:14:47] context of the environment amen because
[1:14:50] this prophecy that's speaking of a light
[1:14:52] that is coming to God's elect amen is
[1:14:55] also speaking of a Darkness that's going
[1:14:57] to be on the in in the earth amen
[1:14:59] there's going to be a Darkness on the
[1:15:01] earth amen but but uh and and and a
[1:15:04] gross or a heavy amen or a thick
[1:15:07] Darkness would be on the hearts of the
[1:15:09] people amen amen and we're we're all
[1:15:12] living in the same world in the same you
[1:15:14] know uh age and environment that we we
[1:15:16] see this Darkness amen this is is a
[1:15:19] fulfilled scripture we it's a dark time
[1:15:21] it's a it's a very very dark time on the
[1:15:24] earth in natural uh you know natural
[1:15:26] ways and in cultural ways and in every
[1:15:29] way it's a dark time to be alive amen
[1:15:31] and not only is it dark in the world but
[1:15:34] there's a heavy Darkness that's on the
[1:15:36] hearts of the people Everyone that you
[1:15:38] work with everyone you rub shoulders
[1:15:40] within this world you you can see the
[1:15:43] weight of it beginning to balish the
[1:15:44] shoulders of the people why because uh
[1:15:47] because there is a darkness that has
[1:15:49] come on the earth the people can't help
[1:15:51] themselves it's a prophetic time it's a
[1:15:54] time a prophetic fulfillment amen the
[1:15:57] message spoke of the darkness amen that
[1:15:59] would come on the people it would weigh
[1:16:01] them down it would keep them discouraged
[1:16:03] it would it would hide their eyes you
[1:16:05] know from the word of God Amen but the
[1:16:07] message is not about Darkness but the
[1:16:10] message came to Herald the light amen
[1:16:12] amen and so many times we're guilty even
[1:16:15] as message Believers of putting our
[1:16:17] emphasis and putting our eyes on all of
[1:16:19] the darkness of this time but that
[1:16:21] darkness is not your message the message
[1:16:23] that came to you came to point your eyes
[1:16:25] and and and and and and straighten out
[1:16:27] your vision so that you could see that
[1:16:29] as dark as this world is as heavy as the
[1:16:33] people are there is a light amen there
[1:16:35] is a present light amen amongst the
[1:16:37] Bride of Jesus Christ we're just laying
[1:16:40] a little Foundation here just bear with
[1:16:41] me but that's the message Shalom amen
[1:16:44] shalom it's a it's a it's a greeting
[1:16:47] amen it's a greeting it's an
[1:16:49] identification it has a it's a there's a
[1:16:52] recipient amen of this greeting amen the
[1:16:55] message to you is shalom shalom we know
[1:16:58] means good morning

[1:17:05] good Sunrise it's a good light amen it's
[1:17:08] a it's a good time it's a to be part of
[1:17:11] this people it's a good people amen and
[1:17:13] that is your identification Shalom is a
[1:17:16] message of identification every message
[1:17:18] brother Brandon preached was a message
[1:17:19] of identification and he's identifying
[1:17:22] you amen not with the darkness that's in
[1:17:25] the world but you are identified with
[1:17:28] the light amen is that right the message
[1:17:30] rising of the sun there is a sunrise
[1:17:33] amen amen and you are identified in that
[1:17:37] son you're identified in the Son of God
[1:17:39] Amen you're identified in the son of man
[1:17:42] so your light has come amen our light
[1:17:45] has come has come past that friends we
[1:17:50] in this time and this place we are
[1:17:54] fellowshipping amen with a light that is
[1:17:57] not coming but he is here he is present
[1:18:00] he is manifested among us we're basking
[1:18:03] in the light of the sun amen amen right
[1:18:06] now right here brother Branham said to
[1:18:08] think that the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:18:10] came on the men that wrote the Bible is
[1:18:12] the same Pillar of Fire here today
[1:18:15] interpreting the Bible amen what a
[1:18:18] comfort he said what identification
[1:18:21] I don't know about you but that's my
[1:18:23] identification amen I'm not identified
[1:18:26] by putting a sign out on the road that
[1:18:28] says you know a message Tabernacle I'm
[1:18:30] not identified by a picture hanging on a
[1:18:32] wall but my identification is the
[1:18:35] present atmosphere of the light of the
[1:18:39] pillar of fire the same one that wrote
[1:18:41] the Bible is in our midst he's
[1:18:43] manifesting himself and that is the
[1:18:46] light that we're walking in what an
[1:18:48] identification I'd rather be identified
[1:18:50] in that than all the Baptist Methodist
[1:18:52] Presbyterian Lutheran all the rest of
[1:18:54] them but identified in that word where
[1:18:57] the Shekinah Glory lays where Revelation
[1:19:00] Lays
[1:19:01] that's what the message is all about
[1:19:02] friends it's a word of identification
[1:19:04] it's not a message about what's
[1:19:06] happening around you but it's a message
[1:19:08] about who you are
[1:19:10] and your identification is Shalom amen
[1:19:13] it's a good word spoken over you it's a
[1:19:16] good it's a good it's a good greeting
[1:19:18] it's good news your future looks bright
[1:19:20] France now every time God sends a
[1:19:22] message it's twofold to the world it's a
[1:19:25] message of judgment but at the same time
[1:19:27] the world is receiving judgment amen
[1:19:30] God's elect are receiving a message of
[1:19:32] Grace your message is not indictment a
[1:19:35] prophet came he put he spoke indictment
[1:19:37] over this world indictment over
[1:19:39] religious systems indictment over
[1:19:41] denominations indictment over politics
[1:19:44] indictment over culture but to you it's
[1:19:47] shalom hallelujah it's God's light
[1:19:50] shining upon you
[1:19:53] identification friends
[1:19:54] we just can't look at it enough amen
[1:19:57] amen we look at this world around us we
[1:19:59] get so discouraged sometimes looking at
[1:20:01] all the negativity amen of this time but
[1:20:04] don't worry about the negativity it's
[1:20:05] prophesied that it would be here it's
[1:20:07] prophesied it would be dark it's
[1:20:09] prophesied that people would be heavy
[1:20:11] but it's also prophesied that there be a
[1:20:13] a chosen elected bride that would
[1:20:16] receive the light of her hour
[1:20:18] now of course we sigh and cry for the
[1:20:20] Abominations
[1:20:21] Amen brother Bram I believe one place
[1:20:23] said that's an Evidence of the Holy
[1:20:25] Ghost evidence of God's seed if we shy
[1:20:27] and we cry to see what's happened to our
[1:20:29] churches to see what's happened to our
[1:20:31] country to see what's happened to our
[1:20:33] world to our you know to to to to to to
[1:20:36] mankind amen
[1:20:38] but sodom's not our identification
[1:20:41] we sigh over Sodom we cry over Sodom but
[1:20:45] we don't belong to it
[1:20:47] it doesn't have a claim on us we're
[1:20:50] called out people
[1:20:51] we've come out amen we've separated
[1:20:53] God's word calls for so total separation
[1:20:56] for unbelief amen and calls for a holy
[1:20:59] life it calls for a separated life amen
[1:21:02] but you know God's word doesn't just
[1:21:04] call for separation God's word offers
[1:21:07] separation when the way to this world's
[1:21:09] getting you down when you're tired of
[1:21:11] all the darkness God's word offers a
[1:21:14] provided way where a child of God can
[1:21:16] get into the light
[1:21:18] forget about the darkness amen it offers
[1:21:21] a separation friends and we have been
[1:21:23] separated from Sodom Sodom is not our
[1:21:26] identification this message did not
[1:21:28] place you under Fire in Brimstone and
[1:21:31] judgment but you've been called out you
[1:21:33] know where you're at you're in Abraham's
[1:21:35] tent
[1:21:36] hey you're not inside them you're not
[1:21:38] you're not part of this thing you're not
[1:21:40] rubbing shoulders with it you're
[1:21:42] separated you're in Abraham's tent amen
[1:21:45] what's happening in Abraham's tent God's
[1:21:47] there in the flesh bodies are changing
[1:21:50] amen a supernatural God has revealed
[1:21:53] himself not to Sodom but he's revealing
[1:21:55] himself to you
[1:21:57] Hallelujah we get so discouraged we get
[1:21:59] looking around like brother Brown said
[1:22:01] about Jonah amen he got he got in such a
[1:22:03] condition everywhere he looked his whale
[1:22:05] Billy everywhere he looked was stinking
[1:22:08] whale Billy that's where we get as
[1:22:10] Christians sometimes where we feel like
[1:22:12] everywhere we look is a bunch of
[1:22:14] stinking failure just a bunch of oh just
[1:22:17] stinking religion misery amen amen
[1:22:21] hypocrisy friends but by the light of
[1:22:24] this message you realize you're not
[1:22:25] looking at whale belly but everywhere
[1:22:27] you look is tent walls cause you're in
[1:22:30] Abraham's tent you got tent Vision amen
[1:22:34] hallelujah you've been shut in with God
[1:22:36] he said I'll meet you in there I won't
[1:22:39] identify you with this layout of seeing
[1:22:41] world but I'll call you out and I'll
[1:22:44] take you to a secret place where there's
[1:22:46] hidden power
[1:22:48] I'll meet you in there
[1:22:51] that's where he wants to bring us where
[1:22:54] the weight of this world don't get us
[1:22:55] down amen he wants to call us out of our
[1:22:57] religion call us out of our churchianity
[1:22:59] and get us to Christ Hallelujah
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:04] brother bran said the one who I've heard
[1:23:07] but now I see he said the one who stayed
[1:23:08] back with Abraham performed a miracle
[1:23:11] told Abraham what stair was doing and
[1:23:12] thinking
[1:23:13] and Jesus who was the one who was in
[1:23:15] that person he said when this world gets
[1:23:18] to a Sodom condition the son of man will
[1:23:19] be revealed again
[1:23:21] and now he said we see that same
[1:23:24] promised word of Luke of Malachi all
[1:23:28] these other promises are made flesh
[1:23:31] they're dwelling amongst us
[1:23:33] and that which we heard with our ears
[1:23:35] now we see him with our eyes
[1:23:39] interpreting his own word we don't need
[1:23:43] any interpretation of man
[1:23:46] we don't need it church we don't need
[1:23:48] any man's idea we come far enough with
[1:23:50] this message what we don't need is
[1:23:52] somebody's idea about it what we don't
[1:23:54] need is some man's Doctrine what we
[1:23:57] don't need is some new teaching what we
[1:23:59] don't need is some new messenger what we
[1:24:00] don't need is some new personality but
[1:24:03] what we need is to have our eyes open
[1:24:05] and realize that this message that we
[1:24:07] heard is becoming flesh and
[1:24:10] materializing right before our very eyes
[1:24:12] Amen to realize whose presence that
[1:24:15] we're in these are not the thoughts of a
[1:24:17] man this is the body word of the son of
[1:24:19] man and that body's not laying in a
[1:24:22] intellectual tomb amen but the anointing
[1:24:24] of God is here amongst the bread of
[1:24:27] Jesus Christ to make the word of God
[1:24:28] live
[1:24:30] right bring the very life of Jesus
[1:24:32] Christ manifested in the flesh again we
[1:24:34] we don't need a new message we need a
[1:24:36] revelation of the message we need a
[1:24:38] revelation of what we've heard I've
[1:24:40] heard but now I see
[1:24:42] amen amen we feel that pressure of this
[1:24:47] age that pressure brother Bram said it's
[1:24:49] supposed to be there that's the light in
[1:24:51] you pressing against the darkness amen
[1:24:54] it's not so much this age it's pressing
[1:24:56] on you but you're pressing on this age
[1:24:58] amen it's not you that you know you walk
[1:25:01] into Walmart and as somebody look at you
[1:25:03] funny because of your modest apparel and
[1:25:05] because of your Christian Holiness you
[1:25:07] never pressed on there amen or then they
[1:25:09] never you your light pressed on them
[1:25:11] there's a pressure that we feel
[1:25:14] it goes both ways friends but what it is
[1:25:16] it means that the light is here the
[1:25:19] light has come
[1:25:20] that's why we're under pressure cause we
[1:25:22] got the light
[1:25:24] amen it'll change our attitude when we
[1:25:26] see what God is doing brother Bram
[1:25:29] didn't brother bran say is it came up to
[1:25:31] that Capstone it would be refined it
[1:25:33] would come down he said it would just
[1:25:34] come down smaller and smaller to the
[1:25:36] point of that Capstone he said it would
[1:25:38] become more in the minority
[1:25:40] smaller in number but greater in power
[1:25:44] smaller a number
[1:25:45] but it's greater in power amen
[1:25:48] hallelujah brother Jack was sharing his
[1:25:50] testimony about the mega church that he
[1:25:52] worked for you know said well why don't
[1:25:54] you just close up and you all come and
[1:25:56] sit under us we'll give you a position
[1:25:58] we'll give you I tell you if they
[1:26:00] recognize whose presence they were in
[1:26:01] they would have shut down and said you
[1:26:03] take this church you take this community
[1:26:05] you take this people why because their
[1:26:08] eyes aren't open friends but we've been
[1:26:10] long enough under this message we ought
[1:26:12] to be able to see what's happening amen
[1:26:14] it's nothing less than Jesus Christ the
[1:26:16] son of man taking flesh not just in a
[1:26:20] Ministry but in men and women and boys
[1:26:22] and girls that are walking in the light
[1:26:25] of this age what does it produce amen
[1:26:28] God In the Flesh that's the light of
[1:26:30] this day walking in it

[1:27:06] him
[1:27:06] all of his comrades all of his
[1:27:08] associates had turned their back on him
[1:27:10] the denominations had cut him off nobody
[1:27:12] wanted to have him preach in his church
[1:27:14] amen he went in the great City of
[1:27:16] Phoenix and not a Perth not a church
[1:27:17] wanted to have him
[1:27:19] and now he's in a house
[1:27:21] in the backside of the desert

[1:27:39] hurt you hear that rejection you feel
[1:27:42] the pain of it sure he felt it friends

[1:27:53] you Shalom he preached you Victory Day
[1:27:56] they wouldn't let it do it in Omega

[1:28:10] the end you know that that that that

[1:28:21] it's all run out looks like you come to
[1:28:23] the Twilight of his ministry friends

[1:28:28] way that's when he steps in amen and he

[1:29:41] but it's light
[1:29:44] it's light and it doesn't matter how
[1:29:46] dark it gets it'll never extinguish
[1:29:48] God's true light
[1:29:51] hey man let it pull away let the shut
[1:29:53] come friends we gotta recognize
[1:29:56] that we're in the day

[1:30:07] it's a brand new morning
[1:30:08] brother Brown said you know it's
[1:30:10] beginning to pull away and and the
[1:30:12] Wheats begin to see

[1:30:15] denominations pulled away neighbors pull
[1:30:17] away family pull away and so-called

[1:30:43] sun is rising over you
[1:30:45] it's your age it's your time it's your
[1:30:48] season this light has come for you
[1:30:51] God didn't send a light in to laodicea
[1:30:54] to make us impressed with what he could
[1:30:55] do through a prophet amen but he sent a
[1:30:58] prophet for a bride you are the Reason
[1:31:00] God sent a prophet you are the one he
[1:31:02] saw dressed in white you're the one who
[1:31:04] looked beyond the veil and you were
[1:31:06] resting on his words
[1:31:07] you're the one he saw take the book
[1:31:09] you're the one that ate it you're the
[1:31:11] one that prophesies you're the final
[1:31:13] voice to the final age you're the light
[1:31:16] you are the evening light
[1:31:19] Larry

[1:31:22] amen Luke spoke about it Malachi
[1:31:25] Jeremiah Joel air all the rest of them
[1:31:26] spoke of this day all I've heard Lord it
[1:31:28] was coming but now I see it with my eye
[1:31:31] that's your identification
[1:31:34] your identifications with the light
[1:31:36] amen now let's lingle there a little bit
[1:31:38] how many know that light in the Bible is
[1:31:40] manifested word
[1:31:42] manifested word when the word is
[1:31:45] manifested it's light
[1:31:47] amen you say oh God said let there be
[1:31:49] light he sure did and if you ever doubt
[1:31:51] it amen just walk outside in the morning
[1:31:53] and watch the rising of the Sun and
[1:31:56] you'll see the manifestation of the word
[1:31:58] and it's light amen so light speaks of
[1:32:02] an experienced word a manifested word a
[1:32:05] living word that's the kind of word that
[1:32:08] I'm interested friends I'm not
[1:32:10] interested in getting around and playing
[1:32:11] Church you know and just having a and
[1:32:14] just falling after a certain tradition
[1:32:16] and joining a group and getting under a
[1:32:18] good pastor and believing God sent a
[1:32:19] prophet and all those kind of things
[1:32:21] friends I'm looking for light I'm
[1:32:23] looking for a manifest head I want this
[1:32:25] thing to be real in my life and in your
[1:32:28] life friends amen that's why I don't
[1:32:30] believe in you know a dry-eyed religion
[1:32:32] I don't believe in in worship without
[1:32:34] passion without friends brother Brianna
[1:32:36] said we have no enthusiasm today because
[1:32:39] it doesn't seem to strike us right
[1:32:42] come on instead of like taking a match
[1:32:43] you know hey you take a match and if
[1:32:45] they don't have that sulfur on it if
[1:32:47] they don't have the right mechanics oh
[1:32:49] strike It Strike It Strike it all you
[1:32:50] want it'll never burn
[1:32:52] it'll never produce light he said there
[1:32:55] will be no light it won't strike but if
[1:32:58] that chemical amen when the genuine true
[1:33:01] Vindication of the scriptures of this
[1:33:03] last day message when you see the
[1:33:05] presence of Jesus Christ just before the
[1:33:08] Sodom condition is fired over with the
[1:33:10] wrath of God you see Jesus return
[1:33:13] amongst his people formed in human flesh
[1:33:16] and do the same thing he done it what I
[1:33:19] did to do he said it ought to strike our
[1:33:21] souls to glory and ought to do something
[1:33:24] to us why it's dropping on that it's
[1:33:27] dropping on that I just love that oh
[1:33:30] it's dropping on that God put a warrant
[1:33:32] over you it's dropping on you amen but
[1:33:35] there's something in you that can
[1:33:37] respond to the word it brings up power
[1:33:40] it brings a light it brings a flame
[1:33:42] Hallelujah
[1:33:43] mechanics and the Dynamics together
[1:33:46] the word is light friends but only when
[1:33:48] it's manifested only if it's manifested
[1:33:51] is it light otherwise you might belong
[1:33:53] to a you know you might sit under the
[1:33:55] evening light you might hear it preached
[1:33:56] you might belong to a good message
[1:33:58] church with a good message pastor and
[1:34:01] not walk in the light be as dark as you
[1:34:03] can be why this word has got to be
[1:34:06] manifested in and to and through you
[1:34:10] that's what I'm interested in Friends
[1:34:12] the word is light but only when it's
[1:34:15] manifested why do we see so much
[1:34:17] organized religion around the message
[1:34:19] why do we see so much denominationalism
[1:34:21] why do we see a Discord among the
[1:34:22] Brethren why do we see formality
[1:34:25] they're not walking into light
[1:34:28] they're not walking in the light
[1:34:30] amen but but they have the word oh
[1:34:33] brother Nathan we got the word
[1:34:35] we're a word church
[1:34:37] it's a word the word the word we don't
[1:34:39] need all that you know jumping and
[1:34:41] shouting
[1:34:42] screaming you all you know clapping on
[1:34:44] the offbeat and all that kind of thing
[1:34:45] that's for the Pentecostals we got the
[1:34:48] word
[1:34:49] brother Brandon said the body you know
[1:34:51] the body word he said yeah that's Christ
[1:34:53] Christ was the word
[1:34:55] but he said Christ means the anointed
[1:34:57] one
[1:34:58] amen and if he's the same yesterday
[1:34:59] today and forever if he's the word then
[1:35:02] the word is the anointing
[1:35:04] I said the word is the anointing you say
[1:35:07] we got the word not if you don't have
[1:35:08] the anointing
[1:35:10] amen not without the holy ghost moving
[1:35:13] through the church
[1:35:14] touching Hearts brooding over the people
[1:35:16] filling our children with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:19] opening blind eyes Healing The Sick
[1:35:22] delivering the bound
[1:35:24] amen the words the anointing it's not a
[1:35:26] theory it's not a Doctrine
[1:35:29] we're not a Reformed Church we're a
[1:35:31] restored Church
[1:35:33] back to the anointing of God brother
[1:35:35] bran said the word is God the anointing
[1:35:38] is a person
[1:35:40] it's a person amen the anointing is not
[1:35:43] emotion amen it's supreme power and
[1:35:46] control but I tell you when supreme
[1:35:48] power drops into church takes control of
[1:35:51] a man takes control of a woman speaks
[1:35:54] the very words he would speak through
[1:35:55] that individual
[1:35:58] oh you'll feel something
[1:36:00] you might get a little emotional why
[1:36:02] amen because this is not just our form
[1:36:05] this is not just our tradition of
[1:36:07] worship it's the presence of Jesus
[1:36:10] Christ the light of God anointing the
[1:36:12] church making this word live that's why
[1:36:16] we got people preach this word to the
[1:36:17] blue in the face and they'll never make
[1:36:19] the rapture
[1:36:21] because when the anointing manifests
[1:36:22] itself they kick it out
[1:36:26] the anointing is a person like song We
[1:36:28] Sing back home the word has a name
[1:36:32] and it's Jesus
[1:36:34] Prince the word has a name
[1:36:37] now if I went out you know to eat

[1:37:31] a presence it has an anointing it's got
[1:37:34] a power it's got a life
[1:37:36] it's got an atmosphere amen quit

[1:37:57] walk in the light you're walking with
[1:37:58] him
[1:38:01] hey man hey man you're not a slightly
[1:38:04] better church with slightly better
[1:38:05] Doctrine you have been restored back to
[1:38:08] the day of Pentecost to the faith of the
[1:38:10] apostolic fathers amen there's no system
[1:38:13] got a hold of you there's no denominator
[1:38:15] it's you and God it's the pillar of fire
[1:38:18] on the inside of you by a personal
[1:38:19] relationship matter of fact you've
[1:38:21] gotten farther back than that but we've
[1:38:23] been restored back to an eating
[1:38:25] condition and an eating condition in
[1:38:27] Eden there are no prophets there are no
[1:38:29] priests there are no preachers there are
[1:38:31] no presbyters there are no pastors
[1:38:34] amen there's no mediator but it's a son
[1:38:37] or a daughter of God walking and talking
[1:38:41] with the creator of the universe this
[1:38:45] word has a name
[1:38:46] [Applause]

[1:39:01] brother Brandon preached about the road
[1:39:02] to Emmaus those two disciples walked
[1:39:05] with him they were walking with Jesus
[1:39:08] they didn't recognize it
[1:39:10] they were walking with I'll use some
[1:39:12] I'll quote him directly I'm I'm
[1:39:14] collapsing it down but I'll use some of
[1:39:16] these very phrases brother Brown used
[1:39:18] there they are
[1:39:19] with the resurrected Messiah
[1:39:23] he was revealing the word
[1:39:25] he was expounding to them the scriptures
[1:39:28] he preached the word
[1:39:31] he read it out of the Bible
[1:39:35] and brother Brown said and they still
[1:39:37] didn't get it
[1:39:40] what did it take
[1:39:42] it takes him coming in
[1:39:44] when I get down to the end of the road
[1:39:45] friends you can walk with Jesus you can
[1:39:48] hear this word preach you can talk about
[1:39:50] this word and it could be the
[1:39:52] resurrected Messiah coming down on
[1:39:54] Sunday morning and anointed your
[1:39:55] god-called pastor to preach the very
[1:39:57] Word of Life over you and expound the
[1:39:59] truth of the scriptures to you but until
[1:40:01] he comes inside and breaks the bread of
[1:40:04] life to you personally by a personal
[1:40:06] presence it's not enough
[1:40:10] it's not enough
[1:40:13] amen the personal presence the
[1:40:15] intellectual mind can never see it and
[1:40:17] we got so much intellectual Faith around
[1:40:19] this message they'll claim this message
[1:40:21] they'll quote this message you get out
[1:40:24] in the parking lot to swap quotes and so
[1:40:26] they'll try to blow your mind to prove
[1:40:28] how spiritual they are and they've never
[1:40:29] even met Jesus
[1:40:31] amen the message didn't come to produce
[1:40:33] that but the message came to introduce
[1:40:35] us to a personal God who is able to
[1:40:38] break the word to you like no teacher
[1:40:40] can break it like no preacher can break
[1:40:43] it only Jesus can make it live only
[1:40:46] Jesus can give it only through Jesus
[1:40:48] does it give you strength friends

[1:43:50] indwelling of the creator of the

[1:43:58] on the day of Pentecost amen oh yeah it

[1:44:33] affect us how could we even be conscious
[1:44:35] of this wicked age
[1:44:37] in his presence
[1:44:39] that's what we need more of
[1:44:41] is his presence his atmosphere
[1:44:43] our pastor has been teaching a little
[1:44:45] bit at home on the on that presence on
[1:44:47] his coming took the three Greek words in
[1:44:49] the Bible for his coming one of them is
[1:44:51] paracia his personal presence I know
[1:44:54] they make doctrines out of that can't
[1:44:55] help it it's in the Bible amen he's here
[1:44:58] he's here it's spiritually he's here
[1:45:01] amongst us amen and then there's another
[1:45:03] word apocalypse which is unveiling and
[1:45:07] unveiling amen and the third one is
[1:45:09] Epiphany which is the brightness or the
[1:45:12] manifestation or the dawning realization
[1:45:15] of his uh that he's here friends he's
[1:45:18] not just here but it's revealed that
[1:45:21] he's here the veil has been torn amen

[1:45:34] the light of a living God Jesus Christ

[1:45:46] comforting the broken heart he is here
[1:45:50] the light friends and it's the light
[1:45:53] it's the Epiphany it's the manifestation
[1:45:55] of his coming that destroys the
[1:45:56] Antichrist
[1:45:58] that's what the Bible said
[1:46:00] amen the brightness of his coming the
[1:46:02] epiphany of his coming the manifestation
[1:46:04] of his presence destroys Antichrist
[1:46:07] because what is Antichrist brother Brown
[1:46:10] said it's church members
[1:46:12] hanging to their Church

[1:46:46] brightness what a shalom

[1:46:52] appearing to us in these meanings for
[1:46:54] one purpose for one purpose he appears
[1:46:56] that is to release our desires that we
[1:46:59] have in him to us he releases our
[1:47:02] desires to us that's why he's here it's
[1:47:05] why he has come but we've got to
[1:47:07] recognize his presence and how you
[1:47:10] recognize his presence is when the
[1:47:13] promised word for this age

[1:56:29] problem with it it doesn't burn it's a
[1:56:31] if it's doesn't burn it's not the
[1:56:33] original light amen it's some Modern
[1:56:35] artificial light it never came off of
[1:56:37] those candlesticks amen it's some
[1:56:39] man-made thing amen it's some system of
[1:56:41] belief but if you could ever get to the
[1:56:43] heart of this message you'll find a
[1:56:45] light that'll be a fire it'll consume
[1:56:48] you it'll take over it'll warm you it'll
[1:56:52] be passion it'll be power it'll be fire
[1:56:55] not some strange fire Amen brother bam
[1:56:58] said you know about that Strange Fire
[1:56:59] Aaron's sons went in there they had
[1:57:01] their idea about it they had their
[1:57:03] opinion well we'll start a message
[1:57:04] church but we'll have our own little
[1:57:05] spin we'll have our own little opinion
[1:57:07] well we can't we gotta we gotta respect
[1:57:10] our background we gotta respect where we
[1:57:12] came from you got to be washed amen you
[1:57:15] got to be clean you got to be have your
[1:57:17] lamp trimmed and clear to receive this
[1:57:19] light
[1:57:20] cause brother man said this fire is the
[1:57:23] fire that God started that's what I want
[1:57:26] burning in me not some man-made idea not
[1:57:29] some intellectual Enlightenment but the
[1:57:31] fire that got started when he poured it
[1:57:34] out on the day of Pentecost
[1:57:36] Hallelujah you try all you want to make
[1:57:39] improvements to this message modernize
[1:57:41] this message make it more comfortable
[1:57:42] make it more suitable
[1:57:44] for the age that we're living in but all
[1:57:46] you'll ever produce is an artificial
[1:57:47] light
[1:57:49] brother man said you know they're
[1:57:50] looking for some great shiny something
[1:57:53] some great shine always looking for
[1:57:55] something shiny and new
[1:57:57] but he said the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:57:58] shine
[1:58:00] it glows
[1:58:02] shine is of the world
[1:58:05] glow is of God
[1:58:07] glow Over Me Lord is my prayer humble me
[1:58:11] down take me mold me and make me Spirit
[1:58:13] of the Living God move fresh on me
[1:58:17] just take me brother Brandon begins to
[1:58:19] as he begins to speak these words he
[1:58:23] says mold me make me make me thine own
[1:58:25] Lord just take me he begins to enter
[1:58:27] into that seeking that not some shiny
[1:58:30] thing but trying to get to the glow
[1:58:31] trying to get to that fire amen and then
[1:58:35] you know he's building that atmosphere
[1:58:37] that's what we need is the atmosphere of
[1:58:39] God
[1:58:41] the atmosphere of God like we feel in
[1:58:43] the building today by his grace
[1:58:45] that atmosphere will come amongst them
[1:58:47] friends do you feel I'm not asking for
[1:58:49] an empty hand now you you witnessed that
[1:58:52] the atmosphere of God is in a building
[1:58:54] today
[1:58:54] how many feel his presence I feel his
[1:58:56] presence today oh friends sweeping
[1:58:59] amongst us
[1:59:01] when it came and brother Bram spoke
[1:59:03] these words he said I'm just as aware
[1:59:04] that the spirit of Christ is moving
[1:59:06] through this building here this morning
[1:59:08] the god that will judge the world is
[1:59:10] right here now
[1:59:12] just as certain he said as I'm standing
[1:59:15] in this pulpit
[1:59:16] are you aware today
[1:59:19] are you aware
[1:59:21] are you walking in the light of this
[1:59:22] message or is it just your church
[1:59:26] friends but have you come to Christ
[1:59:30] oh where there's such an atmosphere
[1:59:34] in this atmosphere all things are
[1:59:36] possible
[1:59:38] Hallelujah you know we might not have
[1:59:40] the neon lights we might not have a mega
[1:59:43] church we might have to meet in a school
[1:59:44] for a little while
[1:59:46] amen but yeah we don't have the flashy
[1:59:48] things but oh we've got the pillar of
[1:59:51] Fire
[1:59:52] we've got it friends and that makes all
[1:59:55] the difference it doesn't matter what
[1:59:57] balaam's got we've got his presence
[2:00:00] we've got the angel of the Lord he's
[2:00:02] here to keep his Covenant
[2:00:06] hallelujah praise God that's what this
[2:00:10] light is that light that fell at
[2:00:12] Pentecost was a burning light it was the
[2:00:14] Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:00:15] Amen brother bran said the pillar of
[2:00:17] fire itself came and busted itself up
[2:00:19] and tabernacled in each one
[2:00:22] Hallelujah tongues of fire how did you
[2:00:25] know they had the Holy Ghost the fire
[2:00:28] come on Friends the word is a lamp but
[2:00:31] to my feet it's a light to my path how
[2:00:33] will we ever navigate the laodicea
[2:00:36] without the Holy Ghost without the light
[2:00:38] of the manifested word Friends the one
[2:00:40] who lead us in all truth rise and shine
[2:00:43] thy light I know you're with me I just
[2:00:45] I know I I believe you understand what
[2:00:47] I'm saying rise and shine your light has
[2:00:51] come the glory of the Lord is risen not
[2:00:54] somewhere else
[2:00:56] it's risen upon thee
[2:00:58] amen people are drawn to the the the
[2:01:01] Gentiles are drawn to the brightness of
[2:01:04] his coming and it's a bride coming
[2:01:06] brother bran said a real Christian
[2:01:08] that's why I think about brother Jack
[2:01:09] when I think about this quote a riff
[2:01:11] when you're a real Christian people love
[2:01:13] to have you say something to them they
[2:01:15] hang on your every word you carry an
[2:01:17] atmosphere they just just to be noticed
[2:01:19] just to speak a word means everything to
[2:01:21] them what is it it's not a man but it's
[2:01:24] the pillar of fire amen just you know
[2:01:28] they might not they might not see the
[2:01:29] light but they feel that glow they feel
[2:01:32] that warmth why because you're caring
[2:01:34] about that fire and the fire thing about
[2:01:36] fire is it makes an atmosphere and in
[2:01:39] that atmosphere friends amen oh that's
[2:01:42] where you want to walk that's Heavenly
[2:01:43] places that's his presence that's the
[2:01:45] word that's light that's that's epiphany
[2:01:50] hey man may I have a few more moments
[2:01:52] Amen brother Graham talk about it
[2:01:54] Pentecost he said he said you know the
[2:01:56] the people there they said Something's
[2:01:58] Happened to Me Something's Happened to
[2:01:59] Me amen oh that's what we need today a
[2:02:02] witness that something's happening
[2:02:03] something's happening we're not sitting
[2:02:06] around in an intellectual form
[2:02:08] something's happening we've had too much
[2:02:10] intellectual faith in the message too
[2:02:13] much formalism too much systematic
[2:02:15] thinking
[2:02:16] too much systematic thinking give me a
[2:02:19] little Grace on this thought I know who
[2:02:20] I am and who I'm speaking to but we look
[2:02:22] at the world today you know and we look
[2:02:24] at our look at our country where that
[2:02:26] it's come amen you know uh where where
[2:02:30] we've come to a place in our country
[2:02:31] when you look at the law when you look
[2:02:33] at the Constitution look at these things
[2:02:35] of course been revised many many times
[2:02:37] but it's come to a place where under
[2:02:39] this constitution there's nothing
[2:02:41] inequal between one man and another
[2:02:43] there's nothing that should favor one
[2:02:46] man at the expense of another but we all
[2:02:48] should be equal brethren
[2:02:50] but you know as well as I do amen that
[2:02:53] uh you know that might be the theory but
[2:02:55] it's not the reality many people are
[2:02:57] living
[2:02:58] why because of the system
[2:03:01] it's not it's not the letter of it
[2:03:03] that's the problem it's the system it's
[2:03:05] what's in the hearts of the people it's
[2:03:08] systematic friends and when it comes to
[2:03:10] religion when it comes to church if you
[2:03:13] want to join a church this is a great
[2:03:14] Church to join you want to sit under a
[2:03:17] pastor that this is a great Pastor to
[2:03:19] sit under but it's the system don't just
[2:03:23] join the system the system puts you in
[2:03:27] bondage it's the system that has
[2:03:29] Injustice
[2:03:31] the system is why somebody can sit and
[2:03:33] hear this message preached Sunday after
[2:03:34] Sunday and be as miserable as they can
[2:03:36] be why because they never got to Christ
[2:03:39] they never got to the atmosphere they
[2:03:42] joined a new system
[2:03:43] God help us Amen to preach it until the
[2:03:48] people cannot miss it
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:51] because to be under the system of
[2:03:54] religion is the worst fate that I could
[2:03:56] imagine for a human being
[2:04:00] it's the system isn't it it's the system
[2:04:03] amen amen but don't look at the system
[2:04:06] friends that
[2:04:07] that's where people go wrong they look
[2:04:08] at all this systematic religion about us
[2:04:10] look at all the Hypocrites in the church
[2:04:12] look at people walking away look at the
[2:04:14] first false Doctrine look at the church
[2:04:16] splits look at the hurts look at all the
[2:04:18] water that's gone under the bridge
[2:04:19] friends why don't you look to Jesus one
[2:04:21] time look to Jesus get in the light and
[2:04:25] walk in it he's there
[2:04:27] I promise you he's there
[2:04:30] the personal presence of Jesus Christ
[2:04:32] accompanying the angel of the Lord
[2:04:33] accompanies this message
[2:04:35] amen but you gotta come out of your
[2:04:38] system to get to this message
[2:04:41] amen amen the Bible says when Moses made
[2:04:44] a place for the Lord he didn't build it
[2:04:46] in the camp he went outside the camp he
[2:04:49] actually had to go quite a ways away to
[2:04:51] build that Tabernacle of the
[2:04:53] congregation
[2:04:54] oh and there were a whole bunch of
[2:04:55] message believers
[2:04:57] in that time every time Moses would go
[2:04:59] out to talk to the Lord everybody got in
[2:05:01] the door of the tent everybody came to
[2:05:03] church
[2:05:04] oh
[2:05:05] Supernatural oh the miraculous oh the
[2:05:10] music oh the preaching oh this is
[2:05:12] glorious
[2:05:14] two of them went into the promised land
[2:05:15] two of them why they might have been in
[2:05:18] the camp but not all Israel's in the
[2:05:20] camp young man young woman if you want
[2:05:22] to get to Jesus you're gonna have to go
[2:05:24] beyond the church
[2:05:26] go beyond the camp go beyond the group
[2:05:29] he's not in the group he's outside
[2:05:32] but Moses made a place the prophet made
[2:05:36] a place where somebody could go and get
[2:05:38] in the atmosphere of the presence of God
[2:05:40] Moses made a place
[2:05:43] Hallelujah you read there in Exodus 33
[2:05:45] about the sit the way that Tabernacle
[2:05:47] was situated that's why this man that's
[2:05:49] why we got trouble amongst our young
[2:05:51] people today because we hear a message
[2:05:52] you know brother bran preaches against
[2:05:54] denominations preach calling the people
[2:05:56] out of denominations but you're already
[2:05:58] in a message Church
[2:06:00] where are you gonna go
[2:06:01] well I'll tell you you're gonna have to
[2:06:03] come out if your parents had to come out
[2:06:05] of Pentecost if your parents had to come
[2:06:07] out of Methodist if your parents had to
[2:06:09] come out of Baptist you're going to have
[2:06:11] to come out of your message Church
[2:06:13] I don't mean leave Spirit truth to
[2:06:15] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle I don't mean
[2:06:17] run away from Brother Duff I mean get
[2:06:19] past the system of religion and get to
[2:06:23] Jesus Christ
[2:06:25] it'll fix every problem in the church if
[2:06:28] we would get rid of our denominational
[2:06:30] traditions
[2:06:32] and believe this thing all the way
[2:06:35] get all the way into Christ all the way
[2:06:38] into this word
[2:06:43] formal's normal I don't want normal
[2:06:46] Christianity
[2:06:48] I don't want formalism I want Jesus
[2:06:51] Christ
[2:06:51] [Applause]
[2:06:53] come out of her my people yes
[2:06:56] don't be partakers of the system
[2:06:59] don't sell this glorious thing out
[2:07:03] to join a church
[2:07:06] Dear God
[2:07:07] open someone's eyes
[2:07:09] hey man what we need brother bam said
[2:07:12] it's like it was on the day of Pentecost
[2:07:14] we need some witnesses that something
[2:07:16] happened to me something happened to me
[2:07:18] something you know I was in the group we
[2:07:20] were all in the group we were in an
[2:07:22] upper room we was having church we had
[2:07:24] singing We had shouting we had preaching
[2:07:27] we paid our tithes amen we read the
[2:07:29] scripture we did all those things amen
[2:07:31] but we waited we waited we didn't settle
[2:07:35] for that Amen brother Brown said after a
[2:07:37] while one of them got up said well you
[2:07:38] know maybe if we just take it by faith
[2:07:40] no they waited
[2:07:41] they waited until the glory fell waited
[2:07:45] for the fire
[2:07:46] waited for the light
[2:07:48] they didn't settle for some intellectual
[2:07:50] understanding
[2:07:52] neither will I what we need brother bran
[2:07:54] said is a sane sensible group of people
[2:07:57] that can walk up and face God
[2:07:59] say Lord don't make me a church member
[2:08:01] make me a witness
[2:08:03] please make me a witness Amen brother
[2:08:06] bran preached about that little Maiden
[2:08:08] Amen in Syria amen and she had a master
[2:08:12] named Naaman and can you imagine that
[2:08:14] guy that guy invaded Israel and
[2:08:17] kidnapped this girl and took her home to
[2:08:20] exploit her exploit her labor and make
[2:08:23] her a servant in his house amen she
[2:08:26] didn't owe that guy anything but she was
[2:08:27] such a witness
[2:08:29] she was such a witness amen until when
[2:08:31] he was stricken with Leprosy where that
[2:08:33] little girl she went to she went to uh
[2:08:35] went to and said you know I wish you
[2:08:37] could get to my country
[2:08:39] because in my country we got a prophet
[2:08:41] and I know if you could get to the
[2:08:43] prophet amen that you could be clean
[2:08:46] I just know if you could just get there
[2:08:48] well what did he do that great
[2:08:50] intellectual man
[2:08:51] he said well you know I'm a deacon in
[2:08:54] the church
[2:08:55] you know I'm not I can't just I'm not
[2:08:57] going to go up to the altar everyone
[2:08:58] will think I'm backslid
[2:09:00] he said ah no no no no no I'll go to the
[2:09:02] king
[2:09:03] I'll go to the king so it went down to
[2:09:05] pastor formalism's church you know it
[2:09:07] goes to the king just like you know all
[2:09:09] just intellectual thinking well I you
[2:09:10] know I that guy's smarter than all the
[2:09:12] rest of them I'll go over to him get his
[2:09:14] take on it goes to the king says you
[2:09:16] know I got this leprosy I'm here so I
[2:09:18] can be healed because I heard that your
[2:09:20] God heals leprosy
[2:09:21] what'd the king do he said whoa now
[2:09:25] oh hold on now
[2:09:27] what are you trying to pull
[2:09:29] yeah we preaching yeah you I know our
[2:09:32] you know we preach about the brass
[2:09:33] serpent all those kind of things we
[2:09:35] preach that here we preach the message
[2:09:37] now you're standing my altar you want to
[2:09:39] be healed of leprosy are you trying to
[2:09:41] embarrass me
[2:09:43] you trying to embarrass me we we're a
[2:09:45] word church
[2:09:47] you know we we don't all that kind of
[2:09:49] we're not sign Seekers
[2:09:51] all right you must be you're looking for
[2:09:52] some Pentecostals we got the word
[2:09:55] days of Miracles has passed
[2:09:57] Hee-Haw
[2:09:59] you know
[2:10:00] isn't that just the way
[2:10:03] but he never should have went to that
[2:10:04] King in the first place he never should
[2:10:06] have took the intellectual approach but
[2:10:08] he should have believed a little girl's
[2:10:10] testimony he should have just took her
[2:10:12] at his word that there's a place where
[2:10:14] he could go where he could be clean amen
[2:10:17] friends there's a lot of people that'll
[2:10:18] pay lip service to a supernatural God
[2:10:20] they'll pay lip service to a message
[2:10:22] they're not they're you know Judas
[2:10:24] didn't mind preaching I and my father
[2:10:25] owondo he'd probably he'd preached the
[2:10:27] third pool till he was blue in the face
[2:10:28] but he couldn't go to Pentecost because
[2:10:31] he could not live in that atmosphere
[2:10:35] that's why brother Braham said and I
[2:10:37] don't have time to go into it but if you
[2:10:38] go into Third Exodus and search for uh
[2:10:40] actions speak louder than words brother
[2:10:41] Brown said that's a lot of churches
[2:10:43] today oh they'll say they believe it
[2:10:45] yeah we believe in the Supernatural oh
[2:10:47] we believe in miracles we believe in all
[2:10:48] oh sure God's A Healer but actions speak
[2:10:51] louder than words
[2:10:53] yeah we believe in the spirit of God
[2:10:55] moving in the people and then the first
[2:10:56] time it breaks out in the church
[2:10:59] we don't want no Wildfire around here
[2:11:03] but what about the pillar of fire
[2:11:05] amen actions speak louder than words
[2:11:08] it's a beautiful quote it's beautiful
[2:11:10] quote why because he said they're more
[2:11:13] they think they're more able with their
[2:11:15] intellectual Minds to set a church in
[2:11:18] order than the Holy Ghost
[2:11:21] so they don't need it any longer but
[2:11:23] when you do you take it right out from
[2:11:25] your framework the lifeline
[2:11:27] the lifeline
[2:11:29] amen we need that anointing friends and
[2:11:32] brother bran said there is a people
[2:11:33] that's elected
[2:11:35] they have their names on the Lamb's Book
[2:11:36] of Life they can't go for it they can't
[2:11:39] stand it he said now maybe a church
[2:11:41] won't speak it right out they won't
[2:11:43] speak now we see the spirit all around
[2:11:44] the message I thank God for your church
[2:11:46] your pastor amen that that will speak it
[2:11:49] and live it amen amen but that but there
[2:11:52] are so many won't they'll they won't
[2:11:53] right out come out and preach against
[2:11:55] the moving of the spirit they won't come
[2:11:57] right out and and and and say that God
[2:11:59] doesn't heal anymore but brother Brown
[2:12:01] said their actions prove it oh France
[2:12:04] Deliver Us from intellectual Faith amen
[2:12:07] but oh over on the bright side amen
[2:12:10] there's a there's a there's an elected
[2:12:12] people that's got their name on the last
[2:12:14] book of life and they can't go for it
[2:12:15] amen they can't stand that France amen
[2:12:18] and the Holy Spirit proves that amongst
[2:12:20] those kind when he gets them gathered
[2:12:22] together he proves that he still heals
[2:12:24] the sick he proves he still raises the
[2:12:26] debt he still speaks with tongues he
[2:12:29] still casts out devil it depends what's
[2:12:31] on inside of a person amen but when
[2:12:34] Christ is on the inside of a person

[2:12:47] brother bran said that little girl you
[2:12:49] know he said the beautiful thing about
[2:12:51] it is probably in her life she'd never
[2:12:54] seen in leprosy healed maybe there
[2:12:56] wasn't one case in her time of leprosy
[2:12:59] ever anyone ever being delivered from
[2:13:02] leprosy she'd never seen it happen amen
[2:13:05] it was ridiculous to the thinking of the
[2:13:07] time she didn't know anything about that
[2:13:09] all she knew was that in her country
[2:13:12] there was an atmosphere where all things
[2:13:15] were possible there was a prophet there
[2:13:18] was a person
[2:13:20] if you could ever get in that presence
[2:13:22] Anything Could Happen
[2:13:24] that's how I feel today I would to God
[2:13:27] that you could live in my country
[2:13:31] would to God everyone could get into
[2:13:33] this atmosphere that we're feeling in
[2:13:34] our midst today
[2:13:36] I just went to God they would do it amen
[2:13:39] don't bulk at it don't be afraid of it
[2:13:41] it's the presence of God and in that
[2:13:44] presence Anything Could Happen
[2:13:46] I would to God you live in my country
[2:13:48] friends I know our country the United

[2:14:05] I wish you come to my country

[2:14:10] intellectual religion
[2:14:12] in our country my country we don't
[2:14:14] settle for a form
[2:14:16] in my country there's a living God with
[2:14:19] a living atmosphere all things are
[2:14:21] possible
[2:14:22] in my country
[2:14:27] privilege you know
[2:14:29] what a privilege to live in this
[2:14:30] atmosphere
[2:14:31] I tell you Church don't ever take for
[2:14:33] granted what you have in your church
[2:14:35] this atmosphere this worship
[2:14:37] this ministry
[2:14:39] you thank God for it brother Bram said
[2:14:42] there are many people today that don't
[2:14:44] know they don't know that Jesus is Alive
[2:14:47] they don't know he still rules and
[2:14:49] Reigns
[2:14:50] they don't know that the blood of
[2:14:52] Calvary is all sufficient
[2:14:55] they don't know that that's real today
[2:14:58] can you imagine
[2:15:00] they don't know
[2:15:02] but blessed are your eyes
[2:15:05] for they see
[2:15:07] he said what we need is some more Little
[2:15:08] Maids to go around
[2:15:10] and testify of these things
[2:15:12] to get into the atmosphere of it
[2:15:16] to get into the atmosphere of it
[2:15:20] and I'll just bring it down on this
[2:15:22] quote
[2:15:24] brother ramp said did not our hearts
[2:15:26] burn within us
[2:15:28] does not it burn now to know that we are
[2:15:31] now
[2:15:32] in the presence
[2:15:33] of the resurrected Jesus Christ
[2:15:37] to whom be glory and praise forevermore
[2:15:41] who is in the express image of the
[2:15:43] almighty Jehovah who sailed down in the
[2:15:46] form of a pillar of Fire
[2:15:48] here he is
[2:15:50] even identified himself before science
[2:15:52] and by his very actions and his very
[2:15:54] prophecy the things that are prophesied
[2:15:56] of him to do in this day
[2:15:58] the things that make him the same
[2:15:59] yesterday and today and forever they
[2:16:01] have been perfectly Vindicated
[2:16:04] perfectly Vindicated
[2:16:07] do you believe he's here
[2:16:09] then brother bran said isn't it enough
[2:16:14] to make our hearts burn within us
[2:16:17] isn't it enough
[2:16:20] and when that struck me in my study
[2:16:23] I thought my God
[2:16:25] how many things and I whoever this is
[2:16:28] for will you receive it today
[2:16:31] how many things
[2:16:32] in my background
[2:16:34] in my past in my life in my church in my
[2:16:38] family how many things would I would
[2:16:40] have had it different
[2:16:42] how many regrets
[2:16:45] how many times have we seen it all go
[2:16:47] wrong how many times have people not
[2:16:48] lived up to the potential how many
[2:16:51] how much Darkness
[2:16:53] is there to look at
[2:16:55] how much darkness is on the hearts of
[2:16:57] the people
[2:16:59] but friends
[2:17:02] isn't it enough
[2:17:06] to be here in his presence
[2:17:09] and realize you're one in a million you
[2:17:11] say oh brother Nathan but the church is
[2:17:13] just down to one two three people
[2:17:17] but it's one in a million
[2:17:21] oh it just fills my heart isn't it
[2:17:23] enough
[2:17:25] isn't it enough
[2:17:27] to have our hearts burning on the inside
[2:17:28] knowing that we're walking in his
[2:17:30] presence
[2:17:31] there's things I would change there's
[2:17:33] things you would change
[2:17:35] not everybody's going to get it all
[2:17:37] right
[2:17:38] but if I've got Jesus
[2:17:42] this personal revealed
[2:17:45] this this this manifested Jesus
[2:17:48] it's enough amen look how we stand today
[2:17:51] amen
[2:17:58] brother Brandon was at a place in his
[2:17:59] life you know maybe we bow our heads for
[2:18:01] a moment
[2:18:02] just meditate on this that was a brother
[2:18:04] man was a man you know our Prophet went
[2:18:06] through hurts felt rejections went
[2:18:09] without things you know
[2:18:11] like when he would go to
[2:18:13] go fellowship with his comrades in the
[2:18:16] ministry you know and look at their
[2:18:17] great fine buildings and
[2:18:20] and campuses and things and here he had
[2:18:22] just a little little side room somewhere
[2:18:24] you know and he felt the pain of that
[2:18:28] he felt the pain of going without this
[2:18:30] Elijah was a man of like passions but oh
[2:18:32] my
[2:18:33] you know the word that God gave him
[2:18:35] applies to you and me
[2:18:37] he said I'll be your portion
[2:18:40] you might not have all the wealth of
[2:18:42] this world
[2:18:44] you might not have everything go the way
[2:18:46] that you would like it might not be
[2:18:47] Prosperity every step you take the way
[2:18:49] the world measures it but I
[2:18:52] I will be reportioned maybe you'd like
[2:18:55] to lift a hand today and something has
