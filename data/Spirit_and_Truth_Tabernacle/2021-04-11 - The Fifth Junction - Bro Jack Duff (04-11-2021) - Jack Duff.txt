who had a situation in school uh where they um he did everything he could to get out of this because he said i did this a year a couple years ago but it was some some class where they have to be in uh online for eight hours a day or something like that and i said brother i've been there i know what that's all about uh when i was in school i had this um weekend class friday saturday and sunday there was no way out of it you know you had to take it if you want to get through you know the uh uh your get your degree so i've been there and i know what that's like it's not easy to have to you know miss church uh you know but god knows and sometimes uh god allows things like that because he has a purpose for it amen so uh we're trusting the lord just to be with our brother amen during this time so praise the lord let's um read a scripture and acts chapter 2 and good to have the morales family the devil attacked a little brother joe and um but they made it through and uh we thank god for that just touching them and allowing them to get back into the service of the lord amen here in acts chapter 2 we're reading at verse 14. uh thank you jesus thank you jesus uh it says but peter standing up with the leaven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye man of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words but these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day now i i tell you what i know we've been reading the scripture and reading the scripture but i would love for this scripture to become a manifestation amen in the midst of god's people amen y'all walk out of here drunk you came sober but you leave drunk that's that's that's i would love to see that happen police have to pull you over on the side of the road why in the world is your car just swerving like this i i don't see no open containers in this car what is going on did you have to give me your testimony and hallelujah glory to god [Laughter] these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it as but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old man shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy praise god and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord has a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray lord jesus um how grateful we are to come and read the scripture and lord we're just trying to enter a channel lord that the the prophet brought when he preached his sermon uh the junction of time and he talked about seven different junctions but lord you allowed the prophet to read this scripture uh as he preached on that on that subject and lord just trying to follow the mind of christ we pray that you would just minister to us and help us lord to see the things that we can't see lord and to experience the things that are written here in scripture we realize that what was written here uh lord in the book of acts is a promise to generations not just to those that were there on the day of pentecost but even to this day it's a promise and father we're we're under expectation for your word to be made manifest uh in this place oh god let us not leave here the same way we came but may the holy spirit take complete control over all that happens from this point forward in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you can be seated praise the lord um so last sunday we preached on the fifth junction but i took it from an angle of easter because as uh brother troy told us all the slope has a has a slope back to calvary uh and uh and we just wanted to focus a man a lot on things pertaining to easter but i had some other things that i wanted to uh just kind of deal with in that fifth junction uh we just uh quickly we know uh there are seven junctions that the prophet talked about the first being noah and the ark uh where the sons of god went after the daughters of man and you know just the judgment that came upon the earth during that time um second junction was moses and children of israel god had a prophet and the miraculous taking place during each junction and moses was the prophet there in the second junction and uh so many miracles moses calling down flies and you know i mean turning ward into blood uh i mean uh the red sea opening up and you name it miracle after miracle happening there at the junction uh abraham and lot uh it was a miracle that lot and his family came out of of um of sodom that's a miracle amen if god has delivered you from some stuff that's a miracle right amen so uh you know god also changing the body of of abraham and sarah that they might bring forth the promised son a lot of things happened during that third junction uh we had uh finished that elijah and the 450 prophets of baal that was the fourth junction and i want to go back and hit something there jesus came at the fifth junction martin luther and john wesley be the sixth junction we'll get there and the second coming of christ will be the seventh junction so we got just a couple more that we want to hit here uh before we finish this series but um i wanted to go back to that fourth junction uh there's a i made comments to it when i preached it and uh but i um i wanted to read a particular quote that went along with some of the comments that i made but let's just read here from first kings 17 1-6 and and i just felt in my spirit that as uh brother solomon was singing this song um let go and let god as soon as i stopped worrying uh how the story end and all that uh i i said oh what a connection to where i want to start at uh this morning it's the holy ghost that's in control amen hallelujah see you sometimes we come we just think of just another song amen but god know exactly what song to place where and he's tr sometimes if you if you if you listen with your spiritual ear god could actually speak a message to you through the song right the song itself will will bring you encouragement and and just remember that the word as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the see you're trying to write your own story but it ain't even your book it ain't even your book you can't write you yo you if it was your book you can write how to end and the story gonna be but this is god's book right so so so as soon as i stop worrying how the story end that's when i let go and i let god and god been fighting with some of us wrestling with some of us trying to get each other let go and let me have this amen and if you don't know already you already the victor you already know overcomer it may not feel like it but you somehow you you go win this thing just thinking to myself you know uh even in in in in sports and things that nature you know a team may um uh they may have really good players and on paper it already say it looked like they won on paper based on the status of the players that they have but they still got to get in the game if you're a basketball team you still got to put the ball in the bucket if you're a football team you still got to score touchdowns right i mean you still got to work for it some kind of way somehow but but that's the same way on paper we know we're already victorious glory to god on paper and scripture says that we're already overcomers but we got to get in the battle anyway hallelujah we got to go through the trials anyway hallelujah oh glory to god don't don't run from the trial run to it glory hallelujah somebody amen amen amen amen but you know what this ch that's all it is is a trial and sometimes it just make it look that much better they go through all that and at the end you score the winning touchdown uh at the end you you you you shoot a three point in the team win it it just makes it all that much more better hallelujah glory or you have to have a big comeback amen seemed like you were down the whole time but you had a big comeback brother somebody's been set up for a comeback hallelujah i say you've been set up for a comeback glory to god [Applause] amen i don't care what it looked like it may look like you defeated you may feel like you defeated but you have been predestinated by almighty god to win hallelujah amen he never lost a battle and he never will [Applause] glory all right all right all right all right amen so here i'm in first king 17 amen and uh starting at verse one this is a tying to the fourth junction but just wanted to read something to you this morning hopefully to be an encouragement uh here the bible says elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor rain these years look at this now but according to my word right and i mean and this man had the authority as a prophet of god to stand out there and say it cannot reign until i say so right and just think about that right because god is the one that controls the ring right now i mean and no matter these these guys could have traveled to other cities and saw rain happening all over the place but because that prophet was living there and that prophet said it will not rain until i say so then it was not gonna rain until he said so right but uh but notice now we we you know and i'm going back and because as i brought this a few weeks ago the the very next sunday y'all remember right the very next sunday the devil was attacking uh brother ernie on on that friday night service attacking him and he was just he was he was he was doing everything he could to preach on sunday morning and i was trying to talk him out of it brother don't you know i i i can do it i did not know brother jack i'm okay brother brother ernie come out here picked up and said the exact coming from from from washington state all the way on the other side of the usa and come and preach the same exact scripture not only that made the same comments hallelujah when you see things like that happen in church that tell you that jesus is in the building the presence of the lord is here we're not just playing church we come to experience christ glory to god so you know uh uh i was just very blessed by you know our brother doing that and and i want to just kind of go back i'm gonna keep reading here in verse two says in the word of the lord came unto him saying uh get the hints and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith amen that is before jordan he says and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there oh i just love the word of god says so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook now now uh just a couple comments and i want to go to this sermon a trumpet gives an uncertain sound that's the quote that i'm going to be reading from but just a couple comments uh comments here the ravens were already commanded by god to bring food before the prophet arrived at the brook right and uh uh the other thing is that we need to understand it was elijah that caused the condition his words i hope we can catch this his words cause his condition i want you to understand amen uh saints of god sometimes it's your words that cause your condition oh hallelujah your words the way that you talk what you speak sometimes we speak hastily right we we we get ahead of ourselves and our words amen caused our condition it was it was elijah's words about it would not be rain that's what caused his condition but i need you to understand even though uh he might not have thought it all the way through sometimes we don't think it all over through we don't realize how that's gonna impact us how that's going to affect us do you realize god doesn't already win ahead of you and god is already preparing a way for you hallelujah god got a place for you to be sustained even when your words have impacted your condition watch this he says so i i was writing this before the condition worsened god had already made a way i love that before the condition worsened god had already made a way now look at this and the trumpet gives an uncertain sound prophet says now he said elijah i want you to get up there in the driest place in the country plum up on the mountain where there ain't no springs now god is sending him somewhere where there's it's almost an impossible situation for him to get anything out of this and and i love the way the prophet is able to kind of take us on the scene here right it says uh up in the driest place in the country plum up on the mountain where there ain't no springs glory but i have one up there for you oh hallelujah amen in order to be to be sustained god only needed to bribe him provide him one brook oh come on somebody amen sometimes god only need to provide you one hallelujah you don't need a whole bunch that's just one oh glory to god one job that'll meet all your needs hey man one house that'll satisfy you god only have to provide you one glory glory glory he says plumb up the mountain where there ain't no springs but i have one up there for you he was fully persuaded he climbed up on the mountain and sat down by the brook cherith now what am i going to do up here now this is elijah talking brother brandon i'm kind of going to see now what am i going to do up here i've already commanded the ravens to feed you look at this now he says now he says now uh this is this is his mindset like i mean he brother brandon's kind of taking us through how we would think about it if we was elijah says now how is them ravens now wait a minute lord that's the way we talk now wait a minute lord i gave you a promise but you said now wait a minute lord right now no no the trumpet sounded that's enough how is it going to happen oh jesus look at this he says up and here uh i says i don't know i don't care oh i want to encourage the church this morning i don't know what you're facing but you might have the same question how is it going to happen that might be a question but take the response that the prophet just gave us i don't know and i don't care praise god just as long as it happens that's all that matters to me i don't know tell the devil i don't know and i don't care how god gonna do it i don't know how you gonna restore my love when i don't know and i don't care i don't know how he gonna heal my body i don't know and i don't care but i just expect him to do it i don't know how he gonna restore this when they restore that win i don't know and i don't care long as they come in praise god i don't know which service is going to be that the holy ghost gone poor i don't know and i don't care how he gonna do it long as he does it i just want to be in the right spot at the right time amen amen look at what he says here glory says i don't know i don't care see it isn't for me to worry about that as soon as i stop [Applause] [Music] as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story ends when i let go and i let god that's when things start happening oh jesus it isn't for me to worry about that's god's business he said he commanded the ravens right and i just i just think this is just so important for us to get it's god's business when god makes a promise it's god's business as to how he manifests his promise right we don't know we don't care and because you know we all got that same uh how's it gonna happen we all got that you know know what i mean no matter what we're going that lord how's this gonna happen how's that gonna happen how about this and how about that and and what about this oh you think you smarter than god you think he ain't got it already worked out and figured out right you just gonna walk into the manifestation of it hallelujah church glory to god god got it already worked out i'm gonna keep reading he says well lord he says well lord would you please break it down to me oh i just you know because this is this is us i'm talking to me right lord break it down show me your your plan ay and then in my mind i'm saying if right do you realize who i'm talking to let me tell you something when god got a plan a there is no other plan there is no plan b there is no plan c it's only a plan a so if he had to bankrupt heaven to bring that promise to pax then that's exactly what he'll do [Applause] glory to god says would you please break it down to me see then you wouldn't you wouldn't be walking by faith if he told you everything and without faith it's impossible to please him right says would you please break it down to me tell me just where what school those ravens went to there to learn to speak hebrew what what do they do they cook on gas stoves or do they have wood fire or how do they do it right it says and where were they what kind of an animal will they kill they're they're just a small bird how they gonna kill a beef for me to bring me a beef sandwich cece that wasn't question right it says god the trumpet of god his voice sounded forth and said i have not elijah i might do it elijah i have i have commanded the ravens to feed you there the ravens know exactly where to go now if you don't show up elijah that's your problem but the ravens know exactly where to go because i have commanded them notice that elijah you don't have to talk to the ravens you don't have to talk to the ravens you ain't got to try to get them to understand what you want look god already know what your likes are he know what you like to eat oh church tell somebody preach with me this morning he already know exactly what you want in the morning he won't he know what you want for breakfast he know what you want for dinner and god has a way to provide exactly what you need and all he said elijah just go there because i have

be me lord amen let me be that somebody that's going to get everything god promised me i'm going to get it [Music] how do i know that because it's already done amen somebody's going to get it somebody will turn it away it's not my business how it comes it's just so it gets there amen god said it would be so and it's so peter said on the day of pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost how is it going to come i don't know the promise is unto you unto your children to them that's afar off as many as the lord our god shall call can i put it this way how are they going to come i don't know and you know what else i don't care i'm not sitting here worrying about all that i'm i'm just looking for god to manifest his promise to me glory hallelujah amen it says now you can explain that away the trumpet that has done sounded and i believe it i obeyed it and got it amen now try to argue me out of it once amen oh i'm not perfect no i just love that scene when god give you a promise you just hold on with everything you got don't let the devil take it from you i don't care what it is that you're facing don't don't don't be uh i can just just just just try to get beyond yourself if i can just say it like that get beyond yourself because you limit yourself god how's this and how's that i need somebody to explain it to me i'm from missouri the show me state no you're not from missouri you're from heaven glory to god and you walk by faith and not by sight you don't know how it's gonna happen i don't know i don't know how god's gonna bless us with the church i don't know and i don't care as long as he does it i don't know how he gonna bless us with a school i don't know and i don't care just as long as he does it amen amen amen sometimes you got to talk back to your mind battles because it be the devil trying to get you to explain it now what about this and what about that and i mean that's the devil's job sometimes sometimes we'd be like uh you know i know i'm supposed to walk by faith if you know it that's it if you know it then don't don't don't add nothing else to that just keep walking by faith when you can't explain it keep walking when you can't feel it keep walking when you ain't heard nothing keep walking you can't see it keep walking by faith confessing the word of god god cannot lie hallelujah to the lamb of god i don't know and i don't care amen amen if i don't get nothing else from the service today i'm taking that one with me i don't know and i don't care how this i don't know and i don't care when it sees secret when you get to the party you don't care then the devil just can't keep bringing questions to you i don't know well what about i don't know i don't know let me also add another part to this i i don't even care all i know but god but god but god god made a promise and he's the one that's going to manifest it hallelujah to the lamb of god all right amen i just love the lord jesus thank you for your word lord thank you for your word all right so here uh i'm picking up on this fifth junction amen brother branham call this one of the main junctions one of the main junctions uh five we know is the number of grace uh uh we we know that we receive grace at the cross through what our lord and savior did uh this was a very very important junction uh there was a statement that was made i won't read it all says just before this this that great junction there come the devil out amongst the preachers and said the days of miracles has passed and there's no such a thing and that and and at that at that same time god sent angels to the earth all right so now i want to just kind of make a couple statements here because we realize that at every junction of time god sends forth his prophets and then also he sends his angels and they come to give a warning amen he sends the prophets and he says angels at the junction during this fifth junction a couple things that make it very important it was it was during this junction that omnipotence was made flesh i want you to get that omnipotence they're all all-powerful almighty god the one that's that that quenched fire in a fiery furnace the one that opened up a red sea hallelujah the one that uh uh uh uh uh that stopped lions from destroying a prophet right i mean uh you just name it the one that turned water into blood all these mighty things that we read about in the old testament it was at this junction that that god became flesh hallelujah amen it was also during this junction that god and satan finally crossed on the earth amen it was during that junction uh it was during this junction that nature met its creator praise god it was during this junction that corruption met its master oh everything changed at this junction so very very important junction now uh brother branham tells us that you know uh there was prophets uh that uh every junction god sends forth prophets and then angels and uh and here you know we know john the baptist was a prophet during that time we realized that he was a prophet but we also know jesus himself was a prophet but now uh what we also realize is that jesus ministry glory to god really didn't take off until john was called off the scene amen it was after john was called off the scene that the ministry of jesus christ really began to elevate jesus only spent about three and a half years in ministry hallelujah right so so so uh uh you know we even even though we got these two major and i don't even want to call them too major we got john being a major prophet but jesus being the prophet of prophets hallelujah the son of man this is this is who we have on the scene now um i want to just kind of pick up because there were several angels that appeared during this time before john was born as his father zechariah was visited by the angel gabriel amen that's found in luke 1 verse 11 through 19 mary was also visited by the angel gabriel that's found in luke 20 uh luke 1 26-37 where she was told with god nothing shall be impossible hallelujah and i believe that uh joseph himself heard from an angel of the lord in a dream to take uh take jesus out of that area and take him down into egypt joseph heard from an angel through a dream glory amen the shepherds when jesus was born they were visited by angels while watching their flocks they heard angels sing him because a king was born gloria amen uh also during that time while jesus was on the earth he went down to a man the pool of bethesda and there was an angel that came down at certain seasons and troubled the water glory you have to recognize seasons you have to recognize opportunities you got to know when to jump in you know sometimes you can come to church and sit there and be quiet if you want to but you better recognize seasons and recognize how to open up your mouth and get god's attention [Music] hallelujah somebody amen but but there was an angel that came at a certain season and troubled the world they had angels visiting during this time glory to god there was an angel that strengthened jesus as he was preparing himself for calvary and also at his resurrection there was an angel amen that went to the women while they were at the tomb to tell him that he was not there but he had risen again they had angels appearing at that junction all right now let's pick up something here uh this is out of a junction of time i'm at paragraph e37 thank you jesus says john came forth claiming the miraculous john was a prophet the bible said jesus said himself there never was a man born on the earth like him till that time and it says hallelujah says why he was a prophet the greatest there was till that time because this was the greatest junction of god ever made with the devil when their paths crossed and there he would strip him and rob him of everything he had hallelujah john was a prophet gabriel was the angel they're appearing at junction time glory to god about 33 years before it happened god started in plenty time to forewarn them that the junction time was at hand the unbelievers waxed worse and downed it and fussed at it and tried to get away with it and finally killed everyone that's saying anything but god moved on into miraculous just the same for he's omnipotent he has to he's god now uh you know we talk about these miracles and let me see i think i want to keep going in here uh um hold on one sec yeah let me keep going the next paragraph says look what's taking place now as we move up into this episode here as we come up we see john coming on the river preaching he's telling about one that was coming that's mightier than he began to preach after a while there appeared nonetheless oh i like that after a while there appeared none less than omnipotent himself glory john introduced omnipotent in the flesh right john oh he comes so meek and so humble didn't look like he could do nothing but when he spoke the power that was in his voice john introduced omnipotent he says he says uh uh after a while there appeared none left and omnipotent himself wrapped up in a little bundle of flesh great jehovah god revealed himself in his son christ jesus the omnipotence was made flesh and dwelt among us walked among us hallelujah as he walked on the sea of galilee one night laying yonder the little boat tossed about he act like he didn't even pay any attention he was tired but it come a junction time glory hallelujah something had to happen and i'm going to tell you some of us are at a spa right now where something has got to happen something has got to change you are at a junction time and when you get to junction what you need is for omnipotent to speak to your condition omnipotent to change your situation you've tried to change it yourself but you failed but now you need omnipotent the all-powerful god to make the difference in your life look at this it says a little boat talks about he act like he didn't pay any attention he was tired but it come a junction time something had to happen put his foot put on the braille of the boat looked up and said peace be still i tell you the very creative heavens and earth laid in that boat and and nature had to obey it when omnipotence speaks when omnipotence speaks miraculous takes place amen and can i just say it a little ahead of time speak omnipotence speak to my situation speak to my circumstance speak to my family speak omnipotence hallelujah we want to hear from omnipotence almighty god himself thank you jesus glory to god i'll i'll leave it there i'm coming back to that quote i come to paragraph e39 in a second oh but look at this now there was miracles that took place and i just want to just just take a little time amen and just kind of talk about some of the miracles uh that took place oh jesus i went through this little list of mine i went on the internet and they uh they listed just you know 39 miracles of jesus now there were so many more the bible actually say that there were so many things done by jesus that the books could not even contain it couldn't even contain it we don't even have everything that was done hallelujah but uh but there there were a number of you know miracles one thing they say his birth was a miracle just being born of a virgin that's a miracle if you believe that jesus was born of a virgin you already believe in miracles don't let the devil tell you that you don't believe in miracles yes you do if you believe jesus was born of a virgin you can believe anything hallelujah right amen he turned the water into wine that was another great miracle he bypassed processes in order to get that water into wine some of y'all need him right now to bypass some processes if he did it with warden to why he can do it in your situation glory amen there's another uh where he healed our nobleman's son they call it the second miracle that was done and and let's just maybe pick this one up uh this is out of john 4 uh verse 43. glory let's just pick up a couple of them let's read about uh omnipotence amen and how he operates john 4 and i'm at verse 43 it says this amen uh now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee i told you we need omnipotence to speak we want him to speak to our situation it's one thing to read about him in the bible but i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever so lord speak to my condition speak to my situation speak to my circumstance right but jesus himself testified that a prophet had no honor in his own country then when he was come into galilee the galileans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feasts for there but they also went unto the feasts so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman this is a a leader you know a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum when he heard that jesus was come out of judea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death this man needed omnipotence to speak glory to god this man needed omnipotence to show up at his house he knew that if he could just get jesus to the house the situation gonna change i don't care how bad it looks with my son if i can get jesus here this thing gonna get fixed and that's the way you got to feel about it if i can get jesus involved this thing gonna get taken care of glory and the way that you get him involved is you stop worrying how the story is let go and let god that's when things gonna start happening church hallelujah he said uh verse here in verse 40 uh uh 48 then said jesus on him except you see signs and oneness you will not believe now he's about to shake this man's faith amen except you see signs of oneness you and i believe the nobleman said unto him sir i ain't got time to try to discuss this with you right now i got a son that's dying sir come down air my child die if you don't come my child gonna die hallelujah he says uh it says jesus jesus heaven him go thy way omnipotence speaking go thy way thy son liveth and the man oh glory to god i love this right here church the man didn't feel nothing the man the man was in galilee his son was in capernaum so there was no way he could face tommy they didn't have that technology back then right he had they had nothing but but here's what the bible said and the man believed the words that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way what that tells me is that when omnipotence spoke this man had enough confidence that if jesus said it then it was all right if jesus spoke it there was no devil that could stop it sometimes that's all you got to just believe what the words say glory just believe what the word of god says look at this look at this look at this i love it i love it says um uh uh uh uh verse verse 51 and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth how did he how did a man start living through the spoken word see speak on their potential your situation can change through a spoken word of god amen he said he says thy son then inquiry of them the hour when he began to amend when did he start getting better and they said to him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him can you imagine walking all that time hallelujah but the good news is that as he's walking he's expecting amen that when he gets there his son gonna be made whole but before he can even get home somebody was already approaching him with the news that it's already done oh glory to god i'm approaching you this morning before you get home i'm trying to let you know it's already done you gotta shake yourself from that carnal thinking how is this gonna happen how is that gonna happen i don't know and i don't care please god as long as god manifests his promise to me that's all that matters just believe the words it's the word that'll change that situation it's the word that'll change that condition just believe the word [Applause] hallelujah says uh verse 52 then inquired hear them the hour when it began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him and maybe somebody gonna have the testimony yesterday right about 12 o'clock noon the anointing struck the words the anointing struck it i just believed it this man this man didn't think they questioned and uh not wait now you didn't come and touch him you didn't do this and you didn't do that no no no no i ain't got to do none of that just go your way your son lives hallelujah hallelujah that man accept it what the word what the omnipotence spoke and he saw changes in his condition all right let me let me finish reading this it says uh so the father knew that it was at that same hour in which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed now there's two parts to that it's one thing for omnipotence to speak come on somebody because he's speaking even right now it's it's one thing for omnipresence to speak but it's another thing for you to believe what has been spoken jesus my my my the father knew that it was at the same hour in which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judea into galilee i love the way that the bible say the second miracle because the first was when he turned water into wine right but this one he never did nothing physically just spoke and it became a miracle there was a couple of miracles that took place there one is that his son was made whole another's that demand belief without feeling nothing without seeing nothing can you imagine walking for a whole day just with the word that's all he had was what jesus said glory to god let me tell you that's what you're doing right now walking with what jesus said and you know what the man did he walked right into his manifestation because he believed he walked right into his manifestation glory to god you're gonna walk right into your manifestation hallelujah just take god at his word yeah that house is on the way that car is on the way that healing is on the way praise god amen that job is on the way whatever you need god's got it i'm telling you it's already done that restoration is on the way [Music] somebody's crafting the email right now getting ready to send it to you somebody's typing up a message right now getting ready to mail it out to you praise god amen hallelujah your business is about to be blessed oh somebody's getting ready to call you right now they're looking at your website they're looking at your information hallelujah somebody's got to believe when omnipotence speaks you got to receive it [Applause] glory glory glory glory glory you've been figured trying to wonder how you gonna pay them taxes god has already made a way he got a fish with money in the mouth that's omnipotence hallelujah one job that god can give you that'll take care of taxes one job one job praise god amen [Applause] you ain't got to miss church to be blessed hallelujah put god first bake me a cake first please cut watch god watch god change things watch god he gonna bless you for your faithfulness our god is not a liar hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] glory to god praise his holy name [Applause] speak omnipotence speak omnipotence speak omnipotence [Applause] oh jesus glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i don't know and i don't care satan i'm not trying to figure it out i'm just going to church just like elijah went to cherith i'm gonna go to church and i know god gonna make a way praise god he has already done it [Applause] oh glory glory [Applause] praise god glory to god oh jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus i can imagine that man was acting just like you were acting right now when that man heard from the lord jesus that man went on his way grinning and thanking god he knew his situation was done he began to worship he began to praise he stayed in the atmosphere glory to god hallelujah do you realize as soon as jesus spoke the word that's why the man asked the question i mean he was excited when they say your son living you're certainly oh praise god glory hallelujah but tell me something wait now what time what time did it happen be specific now about the seventh hour oh you can see that man start shouting that man start jumping praise cut he says the same time that jesus spoke not only that it's the same time that i believe [Applause] glory how we need omnipotence to speak it's not just a god of two miracles we still need miracles today glory to god if you'll speak to that man he'll speak to you he showed that man that he did not have to be there physically for him to receive his promise are you getting that he demonstrated that he did not need to be there physically for the man to receive his promise and he does not have to be here physically today for us to receive our promise if we would just receive the words if we believe the words everything will change glory to god hallelujah my god my god my god glory hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus glory glory glory oh jesus one of the other miracles that our lord jesus did while he was here i mean there's 39 of them i i won't go through all of them but i just some of them that i just went and start reading and just kind of quick into my spirit i said let me just let's bring that out amen one of these is that jesus drove out an evil spirit all right that was one of the miracles drove out of evil spirit now i want to read it in scripture praise god uh i think i want to take it from mark chapter one glory hallelujah speak omnipotence praise the lord mark chapter one and uh reading that verse uh 21. amen it says this this is jesus casting out demons this is something that he did when omnipotence showed up miracles took place miracles took place i want you to watch this the scripture says and and uh they went into capernaum now where was the nobleman's son living capernaum he was he was in galilee but his son was in capernaum amen now now can you imagine uh by by by as soon as jesus would come to capernaum there's already some noise that's been spread abroad because this man's not not everybody can say now we saw your son dying we saw the doctors actually walk out the house with their heads hanging lower saying there's nothing more they could do you know not nothing you know and and now we see you're suddenly just up and doing all kinds of things what what happened i went to jesus i went to jesus and when i when i got to jesus i i actually missed and i asked him that and now he i asked him actually come home with me but i guess he was too busy to come home so he just sent the words that's all he did was send his words he said based on my faith and what he was able to do now my faith was that just come and do it right because i got i got confidence that if you show up sickness gonna leave my boy he says but he couldn't come he just say he say uh you know what your son is living right now and i believed it and i turned and i started walking away coming home and before i even got here my servants met me and told me that he he started living at the same time jesus spoke it the testimony was already spreading through capernaum you can imagine that no no no now if a testimony precedes a person like that you can imagine that the people gonna have an expectation when this man come walking in their city look at this look at this they went into capernaum straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and talked and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth uh thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him now let's just stop there just for a little bit all right notice where the man is hanging out this man is not on the corner we're spirits in them right this man is not in the club we're spirits in them we know they got spirits there this man hangs out in church this man comes to church every sunday come on somebody this man comes to church with his unclean spirit and he sits inside the pews every sunday but one day omnipotence came to church hallelujah and when omnipotence came to church that devil that was inside that man was exposed and when jesus spoke he rebuked the devil said come out of them i want to tell you when omnipotence speaks to miraculous take place jesus didn't wrestle with no devil amen hallelujah amen jesus only spoke to the devil because he had authority to speak to the devil i want you to know you got the same authority parents recognize it's a devil in that child don't wrestle with them don't fight with them speak to that devil why because omnipotence is dwelling inside of you say they lose my child and let them go loose my son and let them go in the name of jesus loose my daughter and let her go in the name of jesus this man hung out in the church i'm looking for omnipotence to speak to conditions i'm looking for omnipresence to change situations we bring unclean devils to the church based on what we we look at what we see on our phone what we see on the internet what we see on tele intel on television huh all this stuff brings unclean spirits into the church and you're wondering why you can't get no victory and i'm gonna tell you another thing some people just like religion this man was very comfortable in his condition going to church just to say he was religious but jesus was not interested in the man being religious i wonder how many times he spoke out in church and nobody had no power to do nothing nobody had they just accepted him oh you got you got excused brother soren so you know he liked that no no we're going to get brother so-and-so delivered and we're not going to wrestle with brother stone stuff hallelujah speak omnipotence glory glory glory verse 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him cried with a loud voice he came out of him now let's try to let's let's look at this now when you speak to the devil they're going to cut up oh yeah and you know what you do just back up you let them let them cut up let them let them cut up that's that night ain't going you ain't gonna hurt me i don't say what i had to say i said leave and let me tell you when they cut up that mean the devil heard you [Music] the devil actually heard you when they start cutting up look i'mma just forewarn y'all this ain't being preached just to be preached people come into this church with unclean spirits and one day omnipotence will meet them and you might see something that you never saw before it's just the devil and i and all we want to see is the devil leave how he leave we don't know and we don't care just leave oh i know this makes the devil feel a little uncomfortable i want to make them feel very very uncomfortable sin ain't gonna hide here brother branham said i want to be a part of a church where sin cannot hide i i ain't crazy sometimes i know that you know why why people be doing certain things we don't for 19 years by the grace of god we've been able to keep the church clean now what people do when they leave church i ain't got nothing to do with that i can't make you go out there and live right but in here we're trying to keep the church clean where the spirit of god can be free to move praise the lord so god has been good to us by that so so sometimes we have to say things in order just to keep sin out and if you don't say it people just sneak this in and sneak that in next thing you know we got babylonian garments hidden in somebody's tent amen gold from the babylonians that we don't took we don't stole it ain't nowhere aki wear garments like that what what fellowship he's going is he going to go to with babylonian garments what fellowship will he go he can't even go anywhere like that oh glory i know i know we in there now we're in there we in there real good right now i i i when the lord showed me this this man was sitting there in church with spirits he come to church with his spirit when you go to a hospital you're looking for them to take care of things you come to church this is a spiritual hospital we should take care of things make the devil feel uncomfortable his religion could not hide his spirit all right i mean because you know we we come to church and this fellow is probably just like us we come we say a man here but when we get home we acting like a devil we ain't acting like no amen there we acting like a devil god ain't even welcome in your house because of your actions i told you at the very beginning of the sermon it was elijah's words the things that he spoke that created his condition right and sometimes in your life it's the things that you are speaking out of your mouth that's creating your condition and you want the thing to change you know how it's going to change when you change you know and i'm telling you god has already made a way he he already know he looks uh he winks at our ignorance right that's what the bible say he winks without even he already know we're gonna mess things up so we got to make a way for us to uh out of the midst of all that and i thank god for him make it away now once he clean it up don't go back and mess it up again hallelujah god getting ready to fix omnipotence is speaking he's getting ready to fix some things he's getting ready to straighten out some things i said it on wednesday night this is why we need not just a feeling of the holy holy ghost but we need refillings of the holy ghost the re the refilling uh it kind of molds us and makes us all over again amen it get it get all that bitterness out oh lord help me to talk about it it take all that hardness out amen it just melts you you need a good snot in the presence of god you you need to just be just just broken in the presence of god we need that because we get so hard so callous we need the spirit of god to kind of melt us a little bit amen glory to god we need to bathe in the holy ghost get some of the dirt of the world off of us something that'll change our thinking something that'll change our actions something that'll change our reactions it's the holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive hey it's all over me and it's keeping me alive brother if we didn't have the holy ghost we would have ran crazy a long time ago but if you want to keep if you want to stay kept you're going to need more holy ghosts no holy ghost glory become near potence lord have mercy let me try to finish here this man this man this man this man verse 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice that came out of him i told you now you're going to see manifestations like that don't get afraid when you see that sometimes you can hear people worshiping and the holy spirit is coming down that you hear this real strange sound sound like they worshipping uh oh they ain't no worship that's a spirit that's a spirit and see some of y'all young people that go out there and get messed up in life you you you you entertain these spirits and then you come to church like this unclean this man this this man he was coming to church with unclean spirits hallelujah unclean spirits the things that make you do some of the stuff you're doing is an unclean spirit that does that right and so so so so you go out there you get all mixed up and you come in here and one day omnipotence is gonna meet you here now now the good thing about this man and his condition the good thing about him the good thing about it is that this man uh actually needed to be set free and jesus was there to set them free i wonder how many other unclean spirits came to church and went home unclean the same way that they came look at this and they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandee even the unclean spirits and they do obey him now what jesus was not wrestling with the man he wasn't fighting with the man he spoke and let the devil just tell the pieces right there now look i don't care what you do it's a couple of things that you can't do you can't take his life right you can't take his life and you can't stay there no more you've been evicted and
