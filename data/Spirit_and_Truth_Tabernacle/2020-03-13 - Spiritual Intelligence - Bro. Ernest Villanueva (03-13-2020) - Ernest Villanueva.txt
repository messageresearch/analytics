gather they have more than 200 or 250 people in the assembly they're asked being asked not to gather you know we take it for granted that we have the opportunity to come and they met in fellowship one with the other and you know we don't know when things may change the Prophet actually told us that there will come a time that they'll put padlocks on the doors and one allow us to be able to come into the house the Lord and you know so we want to take advantage of the moments and a many times that we have to come here to hear the word of God we don't want to just hear the word but we want to be doers of the word of God and man so we're blessed tonight they met we're blessed to be able to come in a man in sit in his presence tonight we have precious brother brother Ernie Villanueva and loved his last name a man is they told me it just means new house brother Ernie at Villa nueva new house and we'll even got for a new house man I do a house of worship man so I just believe that the Lord has sent my precious brother this way for this weekend a man for such a time as this and trust in them we all come under expectation I know he'll minister for tonight and they'll minister for us on Sunday morning amen as long as the church doors remain open we gonna keep having church and you know if we grow to 250 then we ran but that would be a different issue right but they will think off for that but we're worse he's coming to us from a man who lives in Washington a state of Washington goes brother Eddie bisko's Turks they're in my Vancouver and and they used to live here in Florida and they say every time become the Florida this time of year he just started thinking why did I leave Flores a man but we thank God to have him coming our way tonight so let's just stand a man and let's prepare to welcome him just let's welcome my precious brother Ernie tonight as it comes just in his own special way a man walked to sing a course of the song amazing grace Minh a red line [Music] Oh see let's sing it again with all of our hearts amazed and raised see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's reach you tonight and the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I'd like to bring you greetings from my pastor brother ed mystical and from our assembly up in Cloverdale and elected have you be seated just for a moment I'd like to just make a couple of opening comments before we get to the word and it's such a privilege to live in the days that we live in and your pastor was highly recommended to me from brother Jason Watkins and his family and they told me that they couldn't believe that I was coming to Florida and I I had never been to brother Jack's Church so this has all been predestinated and my pastor brother Bisco has asked me to give special greetings he's never met brother jack but one day we're all going to be together and add this great supernatural journey that we're on right now it's just beginning and the wonderful thing about it that throughout all of eternity not for one second will you ever be bored you're not going to say oh well you know here it goes again or I've heard this before I've been here before though God is going to continue to be unfolding his greatness and his majesty throughout all of eternity and I'm so thankful for that I would like to start tonight before I read the word to give just a just a short excitation something that has always thrilled my soul and the story of the rich young ruler and you think about that man in the beginning of his life had a great pet pedigree so to speak rich young and a ruler but the greatest thing that man had was the opportunity to come face-to-face with the Lord Jesus Christ and when he did he asked the question and he asked exactly the right question from the only one who could give him the perfect answer he asked what must I do to inherit eternal life the most important question any man or any woman can ever ask and so Jesus beheld him and he loved him and he saw that money was going to become the god of the rich young ruler and so he told him go and sell everything you have and give it to the poor and come and be my disciple but the rich young ruler he could not wrap his mind around what Jesus was saying because all as he was thinking was I'm going to give up my privilege and my wealth and my pleasure and become a homeless man and so like everybody else the gospel will have one of three effects upon you it will make you mad or glad or sad and for the rich young ruler it made him very sad and he turned and walked away but that was not the end of the rich young ruler because through the eye of a prophet we see him in torment and he is able to see Abraham and Lazarus and he cries out for a couple of drops of water on his tongue but Abraham says no can't do that there's a great gulf fixed you cannot come here and he cannot go there he said in life you had everything he had nothing now he has everything and you have nothing but the rich young ruler was not finished yet because now he said well I have another plan let Lazarus mount a great evangelistic crusade and send him to my family and warn them that they don't come to this wicked place where I am but Abraham said no they have Moses they have the law and the prophets and if one rose from the dead still they would not believe now we can look back in hindsight and we can say how could that rich young ruler have missed the only supernatural opportunity he was ever going to have in his life but then I think of where we are our life and we have a much more up-to-date invitation than the richer ruler had because we have 2,000 years of vindicated ministry and at the end of that 2,000 years we have had Elijah the Prophet come and Jesus himself has done more in the life of his prophet that is even recorded in the entire Bible and we know not everything that Jesus said or done was recorded in the Bible but what was recorded in the Bible just in one meeting that this prophet had Jesus Christ revealed himself more than at any time and we now we have 1200 supernatural miracles that God has given to us in the form of a message every one of them a masterpiece and we're the first generation that has ever had the voice of a prophet on tape that we can listen to you now I want to just just drop this in as a little thought we know that brother Branham was the voice that was going to come the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to solve all the mysteries will be revealed as he had declared to his prophet the servant well 1947 the first message brother Branham ever spoke his faith is the substance the first seven words that brother branham ever spoke he said now we're getting some new gadgets for recording right now I'm sure that brother branham did not know what he was saying did not plan to say that he had no idea the depth in the scope and the magnitude of that voice that was gonna Thunder out from him and how it was going to reach all over the world or how it was going to reach all over the world because tape recorders was a brand new invention that's right it was in fact in those days it was a little wireless recorder and then it went to the casino went to the reel-to-reel then to think it said now that a CD now I was a brother a while ago he's got the whole message on his watch he just looks at his watch speaks to it and the one he tells to watch what message he wants to listen to a brother Jack your IT man you might be able to look into that kind of watching and see where that one comes from but friends this message this is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication this message is the only thing in the world that sounds like it's too good to be true and yet we cannot even begin to plumb the depths of what God has done and brother Branham said I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with what God has done in this generation and then later he says the reason that most people are not impressed is they don't get deep enough into the spirit when you look at the word supernatural brother Branham used that term 1362 times and in the beginning of his ministry especially when he had just been visited by the angel of the Lord who has told him if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before you not even cancer so in the beginning brother Branham he he's so innocent and he's saying now he said now you know that this is this is not he's a it's the supernatural being and he uses that term over and over and he says supernatural life supernatural power super natural resource and he's always pointing to the angel of the Lord and he Anisha this is not me this is not a man you know just before we came to the to the pulpits and I brother Jack prayed a prayer that I always pray and that is that a man would not be seen that only the word only Jesus Christ would be glorified because all we are friend we are just a little speck of dust that God has temporarily quickened all right and allowed us to live on this earth before our next journey and so here we are we have the proof of the most privileged people on the face of the earth to know what we know and see what we see and to hear what we hear and brother Branham said we should be the happiest people on earth and that's my testimony today I am the happiest man you have ever met in your entire life so let's stand and I'd like to invite you to look into we're going to look at this the book of 2nd Peter and we're going to start reading at chapter 1 and verse 1 and before we read let's pray father as we bow our heads tonight close our eyes in this unseen realm around us we know that there are supernatural beings present right in this building tonight and we know they are here to help out in the meetings we pray that you would have your perfect will done pray that you and bless the speaker and the hearer and let divine insight and wisdom strike the hearts of your children myself all so that we may walk in the power of your resurrection we ask this Lord we ask it with with great humility but also with great confidence for we ask it in precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen second Peter chapter 1 and verse 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteous of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Burak grace and peace be multiplied unto you you know anything that that's going to happen in our life we'd like for it to be multiplied anything good and so Peter is asking that grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power not a natural power not a human power and a divine power has given unto us a ll all things that pertain to Thunderer life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall need to be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things his blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall Amen god bless you and you can have your seats I am so thankful for the opportunity that I've had to meet men of God around the world just a little quick testimony I started off as a young boy in the Roman Catholic Church I went nine years to Catholic school seven years as an altar boy and I was as intoxicated with Roman Catholicism as anybody you could have ever met in your life stellen brother Jack and brother Quentin my life as a young boy consisted of praying to Mary because we couldn't pray to Jesus saints angels holy water candles scapula's novenas all that all the the doctrines of the system that the great wanted to instill in this young mind and anybody who ever escapes from that like myself it is a miracle of God and and so then I'd backslidden it's almost an oxymoron to say that you backslide from the highest form of spiritualism there is on planet Earth but that's what brother Branham said the Catholic system was and and I left the blizzard in 1973 and I arrived 24 hours later I arrived in Daytona Beach the week before the Daytona 500 and I didn't know what a Daytona 500 was because we only had demolition derbies and quarter mile er so a hundred thousand people descend on this little town and the next week they here comes the bikers and after that spring break and as a young boy back slid you know with without knowing God I thought I was in heaven and I had no idea the depths of depravity that that is surrounding that whole system and and then in 1978 I had an experience with God in a Baptist Church shortly after that I went to the Assembly of God Church and then I got heavily involved with the Full Gospel businessman then I went to Bible School at Jim Baker's Bible School at PTL and then I went to the United Pentecostal church and then to the message and I can tell you it's like a religious merry-go-round and I would not wish it on anybody but I am so thankful that God allowed me to go there because anytime I meet anybody from any one of those systems I know right where to put my finger right want to take them in the scripture to know where they're wrong some of the systems like Pentecost I can say at one time your church had a standard and and had a standard of holiness so let me ask you a question did they start wrong or they finishing wrong and it's a question you can ask of any of them because they all had a standard at one time so then coming to the message and and coming into the knowledge supernatural knowledge I felt like here I was I thought I knew something about the Bible the I had graduated from Bible School and I found myself right back in pre-kindergarten at the feet of a prophet sitting there and in a supernatural the drama all around me and the romance and the Bible becoming real brother Branham said I'm a technologist and any man who truly understands the Bible will be a typology and I have to confess I graduated from Bible School I did not know what a type was I did not know what a shadow was I knew about Hama Lenox I knew about Herman and I knew I lost thing but I knew nothing about the word and through time of studying this Bible I came to a knowledge that this this message it is supernatural intelligence a believer is a supernatural being with a divine purpose in their life you're not you you're not a human being that's come down to have a spiritual experience you're a supernatural being and you come down to have a human experience and mission and your mandate is to overcome this human experience and brother Brennan talks about a feel that that God you know it is a triune triune being and here we are we we live in a three-room house like an egg you can look at the egg and on the outside is the shell and but by experience we know that there is the egg white and inside of that is the egg yolk so when we break down this human experience the first experience we have is a human experience right now when I was in the business world I studied I studied inspiration I studied motivation long before I ever became a Christian right and and so so what I found out is that the mind is a tool with which we think we think and I studied about attitude I studied about goal-setting interpersonal relationship I studied all time management and then when I came to the message everything began to congeal around me and as a result of traveling and studying human nature in the field of motivation and then in the ministry I I came to a revelation and the revelation was and I trusted this is something you can lock down in your life and share it with everybody that you know and that is the most common form of addictive behavior in all of human nature is a negative attitude I want to repeat that the most common form of addictive behavior is a negative attitude no where does this start I drew a tree because when I came to this conclusion I wanted to see it in the word and I wanted to see it in the message and brother branham loved the word perfect perfect love perfect faith perfect straight by perfect weakness he loved that WordPerfect I loved one time her brother branham he was he was talking about the atmosphere oh my he's all it's just perfect yeah no it's beyond perfect it's sublime and so so I studied that WordPerfect and then I'm studying attitude and so I just sat down in our Road in search of a perfect attitude now we're not going to achieve that in this flesh but that's our goal every day our goal is perfection and so I started looking in in the Bible the Bible said a righteous man is like a tree planted by the rivers of water and everything that man does shall prosper so I started thinking well what about a unrighteous man well unrighteous man they're like a tree planted by a sewer or a septic tank or a cesspool and everything they do will be rotten and perverted and polluted so I had a brother he was an ardent I said I said brother trouble would you draw a tree and in that tree I want you to draw some big roots going into the ground and then draw some fruits going up there and so I started thinking where does a negative attitude the fruits of a negative person where does it start how does it come and the first loop that goes into the life of a negative man or a negative woman is the root of criticism you know I've never seen a statue or a monument erected to a critic but to those that have been criticized many monuments have been erected brother Branham said if you're looking for something to criticize don't worry the devil will show you something and so where does that root of criticism come from in a young person's life unfortunately oftentimes comes from dear old mom and dad because that little child is there in his mind is like a fertile bedding ground and he hears mom and dad complaining about the neighbors and complaining about the boss and complaining about the taxes complaining about everything and griping at each other and then unfortunately some of them they feed on television and they feed there and the actors and the comedians and everybody they learn how to criticize and then they go into school first grade and if they're already the bullies start ganging up somebody maybe they're a little bit shorter or a little bit taller or maybe they're heavier or maybe they're thinner or maybe they have glasses and they become the picking stone everybody begins to pick on this little and people learn to criticize the next route after criticism is is embedded in a person the next route that goes down is the root of pessimism a pessimist always sees the glass as half-empty were the optimist seasoned as half-full so pessimism is a dark room where negativity is developed now some young people you may not know what a dark room was but well we were growing up we didn't have a cellphone that could take pictures we had to buy film and put it in a camera and take the picture and take out the film and bring it over and they would take that film and put it into a dark room and then out come the picture from the negative so pessimism is the dark room where negatives are developed so from criticism to pessimism the next root these are all words they're attributes that goes down into the light and the nature and the character of a person the next route that goes down is the route of skepticism skip I'm skeptical ah what's that guy - I'm gonna go I want to watch that guy skepticism right and then right next to that is cynicism cynical we're living in a cynical world and for some reason you know you may have reason to be skeptical and cynical of anything you see because the world they can take anything they want and they can tie it together seamlessly and make things seem as if they're not make people say or do things they never did but you would never know it because technology has moved up to that point now the last route that goes down into the tree is the route of sarcasm anybody ever knows somebody's sarcastic yeah they wake up in the morning and they have a big ol industrial-sized pencil sharpener and they take their tongue and they sharpen up that tongue and they go out look for somebody they rip into so now you've got the roots now criticism pessimism cynicism skepticism sarcasm negative tree it's arm it's on the way now I know some of you think your brother Ernie this is all in the in the natural world we're gonna get to the supernatural but you know we need to talk about our natural self first I want to speak tonight about supernatural intelligence okay but now that from these roots that go into the tree remember a righteous man or an unrighteous man now the fruits begin to come the first fruit that comes to harvest in a negative person is the fruit of fear fear f.e.a.r false evidence appearing real false education appearing real Oh what most people do forget everything and run but what the bride does face everything and rise we rise to the occasion the Bible said I have not given you a spirit of fear but power love and a sound mind and brother branham said this message came to take the fear off of the people how many times we hear hundreds of times in the Bible fear not fear not let not your heart be troubled God is in control he is in time on time all the time but people are fearful up to date is the message right to this hour right to this minute they used to be there and prophecy would come we see you know but year by year we would see prophecy come into fulfillment then it seemed like it was month by month then it was like week by week that then I was day by day now it's hour by hour you never know what's going to take place from the last time that you looked at your phone and you saw what the news is today the world has entered into a higher state of panic than they were yesterday it's been declared a national emergency no the bride's not in an emergency but the bride should be in desperation not a desperation out of fear but a desperation to know and serve and love God and define His perfect will for our life so here that's the first fruit that comes up out of the tree the next fruit is the fruit of anger we are living today in a Day of Rage road rage air rage boat rage school rage domestic rain every kind of rage you can think about everybody's outraged I am outraged well I'm not raised at the people who are outraged that I am not outraged anger how many people right now are sitting I call it the crowbar motel sitting in jail right now because of one moment of unbridled anger and they pop somebody or they hit somebody do something they play the fool and the next thing you know here they are manslaughter five years and they're sitting in the crowbar motel any any issue with the law but one moment of unbridled anger and there they are anger is one letter short of danger you put the D in front of anger and you have danger and the D is the devil if the devil can anoint your anger you are in danger the Holy Ghost does not like that kind of a spirit right brother Brennan was talking about gossip eases now when you begin to gossip just mark it down the Holy Ghost has just left you he can't stand that kind of a spirit no he hasn't gone far away he's just out just just take this fight look how do you get him to come back just become a lamb again anger now from the fear and the anger the next one is one we all have to battle with procrastination procrastination is the assassination of motivation there was a town right here in Florida and this town they had so many procrastinators in the town that they decided they were going to start a procrastinators Club but then they decided to wait what do we do I'll do it tomorrow later you children when mom tells you okay it's time to wake up oh okay time to clean up your hall can I do it later put things off I like to do it now get it done do it now get it done so go real quickly now fear anger procrastination the next one is anxiety anxiety you know how many people are on anxiety and anti depression and medication today and it has gone so crazy that people they've all got their little service animals you know the one thing and the soldiers come back with PTSD and then you've got students in the college now and I'm uncomfortable because somebody might come and speak in a I don't I don't agree with them and then you know in schools now corporate America if their employees get uncomfortable they have a cry room and they can go to their cry room and they can go there and they can calm themselves down in the cry room listen friends you go to the Air Force nowadays there are more dogs in the airport than its outside the airport and they're in the airport little dogs and they're walking down there and they come up there and smell at you and the people up and it's like their pride they walk around with their prized now they have gone I don't know if you ever saw cruther jack did you see the ones that got their little horse on the plane with them anybody see that anybody yeah they got this little miniature horses and their service animals and the airline's have to let the people on the horse are on the plane with their horse because that's what keeps them calm that's what keeps them from from having a breakdown could you imagine if we ever had to send some of these young men if ever a war broke out could you imagine having to go and fight Hitler or fight Mussolini do you imagine a run for the border north-south it didn't matter as long as they didn't have to go fight they wouldn't get on the boat they wouldn't get on the plane fear anxiety brother branham Center way back in the 50s this is a neurotic age neurotic fearful upset unsure some people they're so panic-stricken they cannot even go out of their Hut their house bound they can't even go out to check the mail fear anger procrastination indecision anxiety and the last fruit is the fruit of depression many people today as a result of all the roots that have gone into their life and all the fruits are being manifested they are in a deep dark dungeon of desperation and depression and despondency and despair and disillusionment and doubt and they are on a slow silent screaming slide into the bowels of ultimate despair now that's the natural man and the reason that God quickened that to me was in search of a perfect attitude because we have the paradigm shift we've gone from being that negative person to be the positive person and the Holy Ghost has done that transformation in our life the message has to produce a transformational attitude in our character in our outlook in our nature in our mindset so now let's talk about the human being on the outside on the shell right here on the shell right here I have five gates my eyes my ears my taste my smell and my touch brother Branham said those that's how we touch the outside world that's how we contact the world around us now not everybody has eyes be thankful for your eyes not everybody has ears but you need to watch friend today you need to watch more than ever before what you allowed to go into your eyes and what you go into your ears because you are just like Eve you have been put here on free moral agency God has put into your hands the power of choice and you decide what you're going to allow what you're going to read what you're going to watch what you're going to see God has trusted you to overcome in this day in the most wicked perverted deceptive age ever and God has put right in my hands right here this is the modern tree of the knowledge of good and evil just like Eve had it right in front of her and he said how could he have ever done what she did how can some people do what they do how can they look at what they look at how can they listen to what they mustn't like your eyes what a tool that God has given to us to be able to read the word to be able to interact with believers we're able to interact with the eyes what a Jew what a treasure I know people who are blind one man in particular he was blinded when he was a young boy by a gun accident and I asked him I said dick what would it be like this was way back in the ad I said what would it be like if medical technology ever advanced to the point where you could see a sore knee I'd love to be able to see I've never seen my wife I've never seen my children I'd love to see the ocean again I'd love to be able to see the blue skies and the moon and the stars I'd love to be able to see the flop and he named off all the things that he would love to be able to see but he said but he said it would be a double-edged sword because now because I don't have my vision God has given me another sense and I can feel I don't judge them by what they look like I don't judge them by what color they are or how big they are how small they are or how old they are young they're I don't judge them I just feel them I can feel if this is a person I want to have as a part of my life he said but if I had my eyes back I would be right back to humanity and I would prejudge people I would judge the book by the outside of the cover and I would never even take time to see what was inside that person so eyes this is a visual age that we're living in Satan he's got all his dad's all his tinsel and he wants to put in front of you television and movies and all that go shopping and you want to see all the things in the store hearing you know today the world is dancing to the beat of Satan's music it used to be at back in the early 1900's it was the days of jazz then it went to Frank Sinatra then it went to the Beatles and brother branham said the Beatles I know I'm dating myself the Beatles came right out of the pit of hell then it went to to jazz and from jazz to rock and then from rock to hip-hop and all the I wonder brother branham said the Beatles came out of the pit of hell what would he say about some of these rap stars today and I know I meet believers say well you know I only listen to Christian rock let me tell you friends there is no such thing as Christian rock now I believe in rock and roll I'm standing on the rock and my name's on the road that's the kind of rock and roll that I believe but these eyes in these ears are not meant to entertain Satan's Kingdom Satan's Eden Jezebel religion the god of this evil age the anointed ones at the end time they want to attract your attention and Satan is a good adversary and brother Brad said in the greatest battle ever fought he's not all in one sentence but here's what he said throughout that book about the devil he said cuddle chaplain welcome slicin maim him take him out kill him don't go after him with the 22 drop the atomic bomb right at the beginning drop the word thus saith the Lord drop it on him right at the beginning when I wake up in the morning friends I know there's got to be two deaths I gotta die and the devil's gonna die first thing in the morning find the yapping dog shut up never PS no authority here greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world he hates the name of Jesus he hates prayer he hates praise he hates a righteous life eyes and ears very precious commodities but very very deceitful in this day that we are living in you know the 1900s that was the first age that they even had moving they know movies in the beginning they didn't even have a song they just had people walking around they're like Charlie Chaplin walking and people enthralled in it huh and then when they added sound to it then when they added color to it now they got all the bells and the whistles television became television right and now Hollywood oh my people they look at the Stars and they worship the stars TV stars movie stars sports stars home on sports um you mean you mean that guy can take that little ball T seven feet tall and do you mean that guy can then put that little orange thing in the basket and he can run down there like you just conquered the whole world and the people millions of friends the same demons that were in the Roman Coliseum the same demons that are in the Greek Olympians are the same demons that are in our athletes all around the world whether it's soccer or cricket or tennis whatever it baseball basketball football same deal but now they got a worldwide stage now they can get in that flesh now they can jump and move whoa I can't believe a man could ever do something like that the demons know their moves that being streamed around the world and people are bowing down eyes and the rock stars and the movie star and all the stars when I was growing up if somebody was a star that was a great thing then they had to be a superstar now they got to be a megastar but they're stars but they're falling stars and the people are worshipping the falling stars they cannot take their eyes off of them what's the world gonna do as of this week with no more basketball no more baseball in Canada up or violet hockey is like a religion up there what are they going to do now they've canceled the Masters and the only one that I know they haven't canceled his NASCAR but they're going to run with no no no in the stands but the cars are still going to go around and around and around and around and people will be enthralled and hope for a crash what we see what we hear watch what goes into your eyes and your ears because once you make the choice to allow something into your eyes or ears it makes an instantaneous journey to your mind and there in your mind is produce a thought and thoughts become words words produce action actions form habits habits produces character and character determines your destiny where does it start by what Eve do she stopped stop for a second she saw and she heard and look at the result of humanity because she stopped just for a moment I know the next two I'm not going to talk much about our tastes and our smell but you know I love to smell good food and I love to taste good food and a lot of times I just eat and eat and eat and eat and I go to the buffet and I get myself in trouble if it smells good we want to smell it if it tastes good we want to taste it and taste it and taste it and taste it and I found myself sometimes digging my grave with my teeth but just like your eyes and your ears they are individual and separate from each other some people are blind but they can hear some people can hear but they're blind and your taste and your smell you know some people they don't have taste buds everything tastes the same because of medication or whatever some people cannot smell and the last one the last one on our outside are our flesh our fifth realm is and we are living in a touchy-feely generation I know people they go to their broke but they go to the store and they want to touch everything and want to go shop and want to feel the fur they want to quit they want to feel the nice comfort and want to feel everything they want to see it and they want to touch it and then in the world oh we want it to end people they want to touch this one and then touch that one and touch this one and touch that one when I was a boy up until the time I was 12 years old my whole life was baseball basketball and football we did not want any girls around get those girls out of here what are they doing around here get him out the next year 13 years old I'm slicking down my hair putting some put some Cologne on there you know and what happened I discovered the girls and the girls December the boys and I'll get into this a little bit later I'll get into my touch experience but I was in the 8th grade and I fell in love little blonde girl over there I mean she was it could not take my eyes off for her and one day I got up enough nerve and I said could I walk you home from school and I sat there yeah I felt like my whole world was gonna end if she said no but she said ok and I walked her home it was like heaven and it was a long way that she lived from where I I didn't care the longer the better and I just I'll I'm gonna get married we're gonna all gonna have baby gonna have kids gonna live happily ever after you know they say life is one full thing after another and puppy love is toufool things chasing each other and that's what I was I was in puppy love everything was going well and then one day I got up enough nerve and I took my hand and I reached out my hand and I took a hold of her hand again thinking my whole world was gonna end if she pulled it away but she didn't and I held her hand oh my it was like sparks going through me her hand oh that that sensation of touch and we walked and we held and we walk and we held I'll get into that the remainder that story a little bit but that's how we are eyes ears taste smell touch we all use them to contact the world around us now you see that is not a holy realm the realm of your physical of your flesh is not a holy realm it's not an eternal realm in fact you are only as safe as the realm that you choose to dwell in and if you choose to live in the physical and that becomes your absolute you will die because one day if we go the way of the grave as soon as we breathe their last breath the skin worms that are inside of us they get quickened and they begin to eat and they begin to eat your tongue and your toes and your nose and your liver and your kidneys until finally we're all gone and then all we are is bone and the bone just fade to dust you know every person that's ever lived no matter how strong or how beautiful or how handsome or how talented they are at the end God wins every time at the end god is the winner right you may see people the world wants to take the young they want to parade them because the world worship youth maybe a man is strong muscle guy handsome hoary a girl is young and she's beautiful the world what they call beautiful but maybe you're like me maybe you know you're getting up and you and you know maybe maybe not so not not so strong anymore or maybe the women you know maybe they have some children and you know if we get all over in years and then the bags start to come and the sags start to come right and we look at ourselves we said I'm not what I used to be well what we got a do friend we have to look at ourselves through the eyes of God and for that young strong handsome man the world beats of path - if they're not saved they have an ugly soul and a woman no matter how beautiful that woman is if she's not a child of God that soul is not pleasing in the eyes of God but no matter how old we are or how wrinkled or baggy we get in the eyes of God we are beautiful the bride of Jesus Christ without spot without blemish without wrinkle so that's the end of the physical for now but now we go into our emotional or our spiritual realm and just like our physical that has our eyes ears taste touch smell our emotional or our spirit we also have five departments our conscience our memory or imagination our reason and our affections so let's start with our conscience I pray tonight that every one of us will have an up-to-date revelation of sanctification and the sea of God's forgetfulness and justification in God's eyes it's just as if you never did it under husband now if Satan can have his way he'll rule in the conscience and he will bring guilt and shame and condemnation and regret and if you allow Satan to rule in that realm of your conscience and he begins to beat you and beat you and beat you and beat you maybe you confess the same sin over and over and over and all and over because Satan is successful to come around and planting all those unholy ideas in your mind I don't want Martin Luther's kind of justification I want Elijah's kind of justification in the eyes of God we never did it in the first place there's two things I found brother Jack that God cannot do number one he cannot fail and number two he cannot find sin that has been confessed sincerely and is under the blood of Jesus Christ God cannot find that sin impossible it is in the sea of god's forgetfulness as far as the East is from the West in God's eyes you never did it in the flesh what a victory that is friends what a treasure God has given us in this day if you can believe it that's one of the greatest victories in this day is to believe what the word has said about you and about the blood of Jesus Christ and we see today many people trampling over the blood of Jesus Christ on a continual basis so your conscience now you either get victory or you're defeated what are the other now next is your memory and again the enemy works overtime wants to bring up all the past like a dredge I used to live on on a river the Providence River and they were trying to reclaim the ground and they used to have these dredges and they would go down into the muck maybe 30 feet deep and they would bring up dirty old mud that hadn't seen the light of day for thirty years and that's what Satan wants to do he wants to go into your mind and he wants to dredge up the sin of your past and he wants to have it he wants to shine it on you and make you believe that God never forgave you God doesn't want you God could never forgive a sinner like you so we either accept the devil's verdict or you can do what what a real believer does and that is they use their memory to remember your future you say well how do you do that how do you remember your future well I've got a book it says the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride so I remember my future at any time the enemy tries to go dredging around in my memory I changed it I changed the page and I find him to the future home of the heavenly bride and bridegroom and God measured it out for it described it in perfection so we'll go quickly now conscience memory next it remember each one separate your conscience and your memory to different Department next one your imagination Satan in this day rules in a man a woman's mind in a fantasy world shows that yeah when I moved to Orlando Walt Disney was drinking the ground for Disney World and Walt Disney he mastered animation they took all these picture and they speeded them up and next week yet cartoons Mickey Mouse and Daffy Duck and down all these cartoon that was animation that was natural animation but God in this day allows you to have supernatural animation and in my mind is a station of creation in my imagination it is my dream machine of excitement and enchantment and ecstasy right here in my imagination you know it used to be that these two have submarines and when the submarine you know about this brother Quentin when I was under the water that captain he say up scope and that periscope would go up above the water and that had 360 degrees he could see everything and he ships up there and he land up there well God allows us to take that station of creation in our imagination and we can go above that and we can look in the work and see what the word has to say about us or Satan has got people bombed they're prisoners they can't live without it they can't live without their music they can't live without television they can't live without video they can't live without their cell phone people say oh my Johnny maybe he's 15 years my Johnny's in bed he's home safe he's okay yeah Johnny he might be surf in the world he might be having friends in Australia and you're he says surf in the world his own I cannot even imagine what kind of trouble I would have get into if I had one of these things when I was 15 years old imagination station of creation in your imagination but it's got to be your choice you have to be able to fine-tune you have to be able to tune in the channels supernatural I think if you had a shortwave radio here real heavy-duty fine tuned you could take that you could tune that dial you could hear hundreds of voices you could tune in all over the world for the ramps had many voices in the world today want your attention they want your eyes they want your ears they want your conscience they want your memory they want your imagination fantasy world Satan's Eden but if you turn the channel to channel supernatural God will show you things a Bible said eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard the mind of man has not even begun to imagine the things that God has for those that love him and a call together for his purpose now the next one that's the realm of reasoning my what a deceptive realm reasoning is people want to figure everything out I got to understand if I don't understand it I'm not gonna believe the rest you can't understand God with our finite mind how are we going to understand the infinite God a God that said let there be no many people say they are worshipping a man of 2,000 years ago that led a good life and he died on the cross and they have a empathy they have a sympathy and that's idea their idea of God hey when Jesus what are you resurrected he went right by and he again he was the one that spoke the whole world into existence that's the God that we serve a God of the supernatural a while ago there was a illustration given Satan was having his convention and his demon come or said what's your greatest weapon you have lust and you have drugs and you have all these alcohol what's your greatest weapon to deceive men yeah those are all my great weapon but I'll show you my greatest weapon and he reached over and he opened up a little case he said see that right there he said that's that's my wedge of doubt and if I can plant this wedge of doubt in a man or a woman's mind of God why people have to reason everything out oh my I've watched so many people I've walked with for 30-plus years and I've watched the enemy goes there and plant that realm of felt in their mind that realm of reasoning in their mind and they reason themselves right out of the greatest treasure that God has ever sent man you know friends watching this and observing this and praying about it what I found when the message comes in brother Jack has seen it many times when the message comes to a man or a woman's life it comes supernaturally and what I have observed when it leaves it leaves just as supernaturally it's gone the man that you thought you knew the man that preached the man you went with the man you travel with that man is not there anymore the revelation is gone God is gone and they become scoffers and muckers why the realm of reasoning Satan come in there and reason them just like you reason Eve out of her position Satan in this day is reasoning hundreds and even thousands out of their position because they said and they looked they were curious Oh what do they say how come what does the Bible say very simply cast down reason cast down memory cast on imagination cast down everything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God now we go down to the last one and we won't be very much longer the last one in our emotional our spiritual realm that is the realm of our affections we all have affections parents have affections for their children children have affections brothers sisters friends neighbor we all we live in our affection we they like somebody or we don't like somebody the affections a rule they rule our life now I want to go back to my little girlfriend a 13 years old Oh everything was fine walking down the street holding hands and then one day she said Ernie I need to talk to you I said yeah Oh what is it she said well she said I don't want to be your girlfriend anymore I said what it was like though if there was if there if there was a ground or hole in the ground I would have crawled right in that ground what yeah you're not gonna be my boyfriend anymore I don't want you to walk me home anymore oh my I was like a dart right to my heart and then she dropped the bomb she said I like somebody else Oh I mean just chop my head off just take me out right now I don't even know how I got home that day but I do know when I got home I went to my bedroom and I set the door and I turned out the lights and I sat and I cried and cried I didn't want to eat I couldn't sleep I didn't want to talk to nobody and I cried I had a first class pity party poor me party wall was me party I it seemed like it was never gonna be the same now as silly as that sounds friends that goes on every day millions of times around the world now maybe it's not a boyfriend/girlfriend it might be a husband wife it might be a child that breaks the parents are it might be parents that break the children's heart it might be an employee employer it might be a friend but the emotional realm when it's broken is just like somebody took a rock and threw that rock into a plate-glass window and it just shattered and it feels like your heart can never ever ever be put back together again the realm of our affections cast down memory cast down cast down affection cast down everything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God set your affections on things that are above I am so wandering and loving and admiring and worshiping God I don't have time to be disappointed I don't have time to be I'm too blessed to be stressed nobody's gonna put me on the treadmill nobody's gonna put me on the stress Express and don't let anybody put you on the stress because your emotions well I feel good today but I don't feel so good what does feelings have to do with anything when you've got a revelation it doesn't matter you know the sonship I was at the beach a while ago I just had the C Daytona Beach and I went there and I saw the same Sun that I saw right way back in 1973 that Sun has risen every day on the just and on the unjust and it says every day and the moon comes up and the stars are out there what doesn't change Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so we set our affections on things above now again physical realm it's not a holy realm it's not an eternal realm and your emotional your spiritual realm it's not an eternal realm and it's not a holy realm and if you set your affections on the spirit the emotions you will die and all Satan's got he doesn't have to get you and all those children he can get you just your eyes or just your ears or he get you with your touch or you get your conscience or your memory or your imagination or your reason or your affections he is a full-time devil and you cannot defeat the full-time devil being a part-time Christian he's a good adversary friends we need to know our enemy study your enemy now we come down just closing on the realm now like the egg you have the shell and the egg one but then the egg yolk a human being we have our physical and then we have our emotional but on the inside of the inside that's our soul and in the soul right now either is ruling the Holy Ghost or Satan is ruling now he's not ruling full-time permanently in some people's life but he is ruling there right now today because it's either the Dove of God or the serpent that is controlling that that spiritual realm the physical realm but it all starts with the soul your soul is the holy of holies that's the God shaped chamber that God wants to rule and God wants to live in for the random calls of the control tower and if the Holy Ghost is ruling in your soul anything that comes up if the devil tries to attack your eyes or your ears or your tape or touch your smell the Holy Ghost can come say not today devil you never devil cast them down if he comes to your conscience or your memory or your imagination you're he puts temptation in front of you turn your head turn our head away why would a person ever settle for some kind of temporary selfish pleasure gratification and lose eternity it's not that they can lose it if they do they never had it in the first place but that's the price that were put before us eternal life God wants everybody to be saved but because of foreknowledge and predestination he knows who will and he knows who won't just like he knew Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated why did he hate he saw before he was ever born because he was a compromise he compromised he sold out his birthright for a mess of pottage and so here we are today in search of that perfect supernatural attitude what kind of a life do we have what kind of roots are going down into our life we know the negative man he's got criticism pessimism cynicism skepticism sarcasm but the statue of the Merman the statue of a perfect man is faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the capstone of love comes in that's her goal friends without perfect love nobody will go in a rapture that must be our goal or magnificent obsession every day I must love Jesus said love your enemies can you let that sink in friend love our enemy we can't even love our brothers and our sister sometimes and we're supposed to love our enemies so if we live in that realm of the soul and the Holy Ghost is in there you're not gonna have fear anger procrastination anxiety and depression you're going to have the fruits of the spirit so it's either a righteous man is coming to harvest or the unrighteous man the positive person or the negative person and again as we spend our feet it's God that puts that choice in front of each one of us every day when we open our eyes we don't say oh god it's morning no we say good morning God some people say oh my luck I don't have I have an opportunity clock I have an electronic rooster and an electronic rooster wakes me up this is the day the Lord hath made I will rejoice and be glad in it it's a decision that you make or a decision that you don't make as we bow our heads and hearts tonight Lord we thank you for each one of my brothers and sisters that has made their way to the house of God tonight thank you for brother Jack and his family and what you're doing here West Palm Beach pray Lord that a great revival would strike the heart of each one of your children that they might recognize who they are they may be able to see themselves through your eyes to see the prize that they are to see that they are the victory over the enemy in this generation give them eyes to see and ears to hear give them a heart that wants to know you and love you and serve you I'm gonna ask it we're gonna sing a song and then ask brother Jack to come but I'm gonna ask you tonight before I even ask my eyes are closed and my hands are both up but I'm gonna ask you tonight if you say Lord I want you I invite you tonight to come and rule in my soul tonight I invite the Holy Ghost in I invite him to take complete authority like the captain on the ocean shore that that boat may go up and down but that boat across every wave and a son or daughter of God we crest every wave because you are the captain in our ship you are the Holy Ghost in our control tower that we may live and reign and rule with you throughout all eternity if that would be your prayer tonight that you want God to take up full-time residence and give all every area of your physical every area of your emotional say father I give it to you live through me I pray we ask this though if those hands were raised tonight father I pray that that you would move upon them right now and through the remainder of the evening and into the weekend father and into the rest of our life facing a Time Lord where the world is an anxiety in the world is unfair the world's and desperation but we are anchored anchored in Christ anchored to the rock of ages' amen do we sing that song Rock of Ages yeah Rock of Ages listen Rock of Ages cleft for me he is the rock he is the rock of Revelation and once a Catholic all we thought that Peter was the rock Peter was the rock the church was built upon and Peter is the first Peter never even went to Rome how did he become the first pope in rome and the priest not supposed to marry why did Jesus pray for Peters mother-in-law there's so many paradoxes in there but we know the rock of Revelation that rock of Revelation it will stabilize you it will hold you it will make you solid it'll make you firm it'll make you fair it'll make you friendly it will create an atmosphere around you draw others to you and raid tonight you would manifest that ability to create creat a clean heart and let the Rock of Ages cleft for you and then father if any race of hand tonight I pray Lord a special anointing upon them as we sing this song amen brother Jack Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hah [Music] to [Music] [Applause] this side which flow I'm saying Oh say from where and make beep you nothing my hand I simply to who lost I agree [Music] to the fortress he'll present world to thee for grace praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand a breeze tonight my heart is just bless a man from the word of the Lord supernatural intelligence precious brother Ernie spoke to us in just going through the negative tree the roots that take down these are things that we don't want to see criticism pessimism skepticism cynicism sarcasm we start seeing things like that manifested our lives we know something's going wrong somewhere the fruits that come from a man a tree of that nature would be a fear anger procrastination anxiety which leaves you to depression [Music] a man that say the devil is a liar and I I won't have any that in my I won't have any that manifested Ana through me no I was I was today reading just a little something that somebody wrote in and it pays just to read the word it pays just to listen to the word you may not realize that but the word washes you the word changes you the word transform you that word makes you a different person a man and as I was reading a man this little statement that somebody had made and they were talking about how Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh because he he just did not like the people of Nineveh and as he didn't want to go he was pretty much you know like sometimes things happen in our life and I and our prayer is God get them they did this to me God get him God do this and that that's that's the wrong attitude right hey man we want to pray God forgive them god save me that's what Jesus did right forgive them for they know not what they do and as I was just reading that thought I sell my thought about the the gentlemen that were used to put me where I am today through their decisions amen and I say Lord you know that man had to make some hard decisions but god I want to pray for their families I'm gonna I want to pray that you bless them I want to pray that you help them whatever they might be going through God be with them make me some hard decisions but God I can look back now and realize that the decisions they make help push me to where you want me to be rather than have a heart of stone if the man have this anger this a man this this anxiety and depression and and all of that no no no God helped me to have love and joy peace they helped me to manifest what you manifested amen God's calling us today supernatural intelligence amen apparatus won't be a word that we just heard tonight let it go in one ear and out the other but I pray to be a manifestation in our lives thank God for the word of the Lord tonight amen let's pray father we're just so appreciative of what we've heard here tonight these are words that could transform our lives and God as we would just sit and meditate on what your Minister has shared with us we will leave here and just maybe go and think about it and process it and talk about it the Lourdes fellowship around it lor let the word just continue to make a difference in our lives if we see the the negative fruit lower from negative roots that are driven down God may we realize that there's we could come to you through repentance Lord and see things reverse we don't want the the nature of that snake on the inside we want the nature of the dove the holy spirit to have its way inside of us father this is how we overcome the lord I just pray that follow me what really really it take to heart of what has been brought to us from heaven tonight thank you for using our precious brother Billy Nueva Lord it is pray to you bless him and return all back to him that he gave to us tonight father as the Saints prepare to leave this place but not your presence go with us keep us floored until we're able to meet here again be glorified and magnify Lord in our lives it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen can we give the Lord another hand of praise blessed be the name of the Lord I love you and then the Lord bless you can be seated we will a man prepared to dismiss you tonight we'll be back on Sunday morning Amen for regular time of Center schools and prayer and man and service brother than Ernie leaves preaching for us again so keep her in prayer that the law will just use him as he comes to speak to our hearts god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
