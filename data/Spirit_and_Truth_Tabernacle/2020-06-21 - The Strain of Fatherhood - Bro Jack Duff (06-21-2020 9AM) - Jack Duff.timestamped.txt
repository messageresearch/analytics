[32:15] in our County as people then going back
[32:17] to work the good thing that we have here

[32:25] someone that works right in the hospital
[32:27] and man director of emergency room and
[32:31] they given us the real numbers they
[32:34] giving us the real numbers things that
[32:35] you might not hear on the news or you
[32:38] might not see on Google but they tell us
[32:40] what's going on I heard that pretty much
[32:43] here
[32:44] a lot of the Bears are full and they
[32:46] have innocent people to other places
[32:48] because I just don't have the room to
[32:50] take care of some of the the cases a man
[32:53] as some of you all may be aware that
[32:55] there was a sister a man who passed a
[32:58] Memphis this past week she was in her
[33:02] 80s and she passed from this virus and
[33:04] and she was living in the room with a
[33:08] granddaughter and now the granddaughter
[33:11] is also in the hospital and I was told
[33:13] that the granddaughter they lost her I
[33:16] mean her heart be stopped early this
[33:18] week but they were able to get it going
[33:20] again and the family just been asking
[33:22] for prayer and I just want to just
[33:24] mention Church this is this is serious
[33:26] you know it's nothing that we should
[33:29] take lightly and and we ought to do
[33:31] everything we can to help prevent one
[33:35] another from catching this or even
[33:37] present prevent yourself from catching
[33:39] it please amen
[33:42] take it seriously please take it
[33:43] seriously so you know we're we thank God
[33:48] that there haven't been any outbreaks
[33:49] but we're praying that we won't have any
[33:50] outbreaks and that's if everybody could
[33:52] just take it seriously we do like I
[33:54] mentioned before we take precaution we
[33:57] lock our cars when we come into the
[33:59] house of the Lord or when we're at home
[34:01] we lock that we lock the doors when we
[34:04] leave home we lock the doors all of
[34:05] those what we call precautionary
[34:07] measures amen that doesn't mean that we
[34:09] have a lack of faith it's just we take
[34:11] precautionary measures because we live
[34:13] in a sinful world and I was just telling
[34:16] some people you know this week this this
[34:19] this whole pandemic is to me is not
[34:21] natural it's not it's not it's for
[34:24] something there's something strange
[34:26] about all it is and it don't seem like
[34:29] it's nature you know involved it seemed
[34:31] like man is involved but because man is
[34:34] involved we have to do what we got to do
[34:36] amen to take care of ourselves so let's
[34:39] just let's just continue to you know
[34:42] lift one another up in prayer and let's
[34:43] do all we can to prevent this from
[34:46] spreading spreading amongst ourselves
[34:48] amen so we'll continue to do our virtual
[34:52] service on Wednesday night amen
[34:54] we'll join us either vive periscope or
[34:57] via Facebook the I am so grateful we
[35:03] mentioned last week about you know some
[35:05] things we want to do we took the camera
[35:08] away for periscope we had a camera that
[35:12] used to sit right here in the middle of
[35:14] church and we actually got both of our
[35:16] streams which is something that I want
[35:18] to do we got both of our streams running
[35:20] from the same source which gives the
[35:21] same look and feel to both periscope and
[35:24] to Facebook but the camera that was
[35:27] taken away I got many people come to
[35:29] them and say I really like that camera
[35:31] right there all right all right we got a
[35:35] project help us buy another cameraman
[35:40] we'll put a camera right back there but
[35:42] we want to do it the right way and I
[35:44] just mentioned to everyone that we you
[35:46] know we just took we knew that it was
[35:49] going to cost us about four thousand
[35:50] dollars to get the things done that we
[35:53] wanted to get done and and I'm an ounce
[35:56] that last week a man and this week I'm
[35:59] happy to announce that half of it has
[36:01] already done half of it is already done
[36:05] a man so you'll be seeing the changes a
[36:10] man as they as they're being implemented
[36:12] some of the things already on order and
[36:14] the changes will be made in the next few
[36:17] weeks so everybody would like to give a
[36:20] little bit you know towards that we
[36:21] certainly appreciate it but we just want
[36:23] to make the experience a man a very very
[36:25] positive experience for all those that
[36:27] are watching online so we'll continue to
[36:31] do that we don't have a Friday night
[36:34] service but I am considering doing a
[36:36] virtual Friday night service ever since
[36:41] I preached the sermon on that the
[36:42] testimonies of kovat 19 different ones
[36:45] been coming giving me all kind of things
[36:47] that God is doing and and how God has
[36:49] done so I was thinking about doing like
[36:51] a virtual type service just inviting to
[36:54] church those that want to come you have
[36:56] to do it from your telephone or from
[36:58] your computer but if you would like to
[37:00] be a part of that and you want to just
[37:01] share a testimony that night please let
[37:03] me know in advance and we'll we'll just
[37:05] kind of create a little program and
[37:08] and have everybody a part of that but
[37:10] I'll let you know when we'll be able to
[37:11] do it but just let me know if you wanna
[37:13] hit brother Jack I want I want to give a
[37:15] testimony on that night so but it would
[37:17] be a virtual service that we're thinking
[37:19] about doing so keep that in mind we'll
[37:21] continue to do our 9:00 a.m. and 12:00
[37:23] p.m. service on Sunday a man until
[37:26] further notice so let's just continue
[37:28] that way and again just quickly
[37:30] announced that we'll be moving to a new
[37:32] platform on the church app so if you can
[37:35] just download the church app a man from
[37:38] your App Store and then find spirit and
[37:40] choose tabernacle and we'll go from
[37:42] there and you'll find it there as far as

[41:13] turn with me to Psalms 103 a man
[41:21] [Music]
[41:29] I'll just start reading here at verse 8
[41:38] says the Lord is merciful and gracious
[41:45] slow to anger plenteous in mercy he will
[41:53] not always chide neither will he keep
[41:55] his anger forever he hath not dealt with
[42:00] us after our sins nor rewarded US
[42:07] according to our iniquities that means
[42:12] the things that you know to do right but
[42:15] you still refused to do it is considered
[42:18] a liquid to a man he hasn't he hasn't
[42:22] rewarded us according to our iniquities
[42:29] scripture says for as the heaven is high
[42:32] above the earth so great is his mercy
[42:36] toward them that fear him I love this as
[42:43] far as the east is from the west so far
[42:49] hath he removed our transgressions from
[42:53] us a man yeah he's worried it to me
[42:57] praise a man at verse 13 says like as a
[43:02] father pitieth his children so the Lord
[43:07] pities them that fear him for he knoweth
[43:12] our frame he remembers that we are dust
[43:17] a man let's just read another passage
[43:23] here from mark 4
[43:30] I pray the Lord just help us a man and
[43:35] our journey today mark 4 and this is
[43:45] verse 35 and mark 4 says in the same day
[43:52] when the even was come said unto them
[43:57] let us pass over unto the other side and
[44:01] when they had sent away the multitude
[44:03] they took him even as he was in the ship
[44:08] and there were also with him other
[44:10] little ships other little ships since he
[44:15] was in the ship other little ships and
[44:18] there rose a great storm of wind and the
[44:23] waves beat into the ship so that it was
[44:26] now full and he was in the hinder part
[44:31] of the ship asleep on a pillow and they
[44:34] awake him and say unto Him master carest
[44:37] thou not that we perish and he arose and
[44:41] rebuked the wind and said and said unto
[44:44] the sea peace be still and the wind
[44:49] ceased and there was a great calm and he
[44:53] said unto them why are ye so fearful how
[44:57] is it that you have no faith and they
[45:01] feared exceedingly and say it one to
[45:04] another what manner of man is this that
[45:09] even the wind and the sea obey Him amen
[45:14] let's pray over the Word of God father
[45:16] we thank you for the ability to read but
[45:20] God we know it takes the Holy Spirit to
[45:22] come and help us to understand what it
[45:24] is that we just read speak to our hearts
[45:28] through your word on this day God be
[45:31] glorified and magnify in this place we
[45:35] trust that you would not only bless
[45:37] those that are gathered but those that
[45:38] are joining a line speak to them father
[45:40] right where they are and courage and
[45:43] strengthen heart so God correct us where
[45:45] we need to be corrected bring
[45:47] deliverance bring healing God feel what
[45:50] the Holy Ghost refilled with the Holy
[45:51] Ghost whatever is needed today God may
[45:54] it be done Lord according to your plan
[45:57] it's in Jesus name that we pray amen
[46:01] amen you can be seated we want to just
[46:10] take a title today on the string of
[46:14] fatherhood a man the strain of
[46:18] fatherhood just bear with me as we just
[46:22] read a little bit you know III want to
[46:25] start with leadership but I you know I'm
[46:27] one that sometimes it's very difficult
[46:32] for me to a man to kind of get a sermon
[46:36] together for daddies you know I I know
[46:40] Mama's man you got to have a mama days
[46:42] for mother day sermon you got to have
[46:44] one but that is a little different a man
[46:46] they don't you know they not like that
[46:48] and and but I felt that would be
[46:50] important for us just to you know try to
[46:52] encourage the fathers a little bit Amen
[46:54] on the day sometime they don't get an
[46:56] encouragement that they need they get a
[46:58] lot of correction people always coming
[47:00] down on them and all those stuff but we
[47:01] want to try to encourage them a man a
[47:04] little bit today we thank God for godly
[47:06] daddies we really really thank God for
[47:09] them and you ought appreciate a godly
[47:13] father say man you might not agree with
[47:15] him all the time but if he's a godly man
[47:18] he's doing the best he can to lead you
[47:20] in the right direction and so you ought
[47:22] to appreciate that but this a man is a
[47:25] sermon leadership the Prophet makes some
[47:27] statements here and we just want to just
[47:30] talk just just take our time and go
[47:32] through the system now the first step
[47:34] you've probably ever taken in your life
[47:37] speaking of leadership said it's
[47:39] probably the hands of some kind o mother
[47:43] a man it says probably the hands of some
[47:45] kind o mother them hands maybe steel
[47:48] tonight out here in some cemetery
[47:50] somewhere but that was the hand that
[47:53] held you to make
[47:55] first step says then after then after he
[48:01] says then after mother taught you how to
[48:04] walk you make a few steps and then fall
[48:07] down and get up and and and and you
[48:10] thought you were doing great things then
[48:13] she turns you over to the school teacher
[48:16] and she began to lead you to an
[48:20] education of how and what you must do
[48:23] and how you must learn and so forth like
[48:25] that then after the school teacher got
[48:28] through with you then you returned back
[48:29] your father got a hold of you a man he
[48:33] says then when your father got a hold of
[48:35] you
[48:35] he taught you perhaps your business a
[48:38] man he says how to be a successful
[48:41] businessman how to do things right your
[48:44] mother taught you how to be a housewife
[48:46] how to cook and so forth like that then
[48:48] after they got through with you then
[48:51] your minister or priests got a hold of
[48:55] you oh my goodness
[48:57] so Mama and Daddy and teaching say
[49:00] didn't you priests get a hold of you now
[49:02] we gonna have to just deal with that in
[49:03] a little bit but I want to keep reading
[49:05] says but who but now who leads you the
[49:10] question that's the question now now
[49:12] we're all are led by something tonight
[49:14] we have to be we're led notice now let's
[49:18] look at this young friend let's talk
[49:20] about the rich young really say what
[49:22] what had influenced him let's look at it
[49:25] this young businessman we could call him
[49:28] because he was a businessman businessman
[49:30] he was a great successful man let's look
[49:33] at his leaders perhaps first perhaps
[49:36] first his mother had taught him as a
[49:38] little boy the things that he should do
[49:41] his father made him such a fine success
[49:46] maybe left him an inheritance because he
[49:49] was a ruler himself perhaps his father
[49:51] was gone
[49:52] so he was a businessman and let's call
[49:54] him day like a Christian Christian
[49:56] businessman or he was a religious
[49:58] businessman I think would be the best
[50:01] quotation he says now this man was
[50:03] religious he was by no means in
[50:07] he had been and had been taught by his
[50:09] mother how to do right how to walk how
[50:12] to dress himself he had been taught by
[50:14] his father a great business and how to
[50:17] be a successful man and his business was
[50:19] successful and father and mother had
[50:22] been raised up in the church and had
[50:25] pointed him in appointing him to the
[50:28] priest and the priest had made him a
[50:30] real religious man I love these
[50:34] statements amen at the prophets making
[50:36] so you know i'ma stop there on that
[50:39] quote you know here mama gets a hold of
[50:41] them daddy
[50:43] Amen mama teaches him just pretty much
[50:45] all the basics of life daddy gets in
[50:47] there and he starts teaching about
[50:48] business and how to be successful but it
[50:50] says both the father and the mother a
[50:54] man I had to get him to a spot where
[50:56] they brought him to the priest and the
[50:58] priest began to teach this boy this rich
[51:01] young ruler he was he was able to tell
[51:03] Jesus that you know what I've been
[51:04] following a man the Word of God from my
[51:07] youth up I mean even the Prophet oh say
[51:10] even the scripture Jesus loved this
[51:12] young man hallelujah and the reason
[51:14] Jesus loved me because this boy's
[51:16] character had been shaped a man by both
[51:19] his father and his mother glory to God
[51:23] in life our children need both a father
[51:28] and a mother
[51:30] Halu they need that the loving care of
[51:33] mama but they need the steady hand of
[51:36] daddy hallelujah amen they need a step
[51:40] they need someone that can force some
[51:42] stuff
[51:43] come on somebody amen we need both of us
[51:47] in our life you can't expect your daddy
[51:49] to be your mama and you can't expect
[51:52] your mama to be your daddy God made them
[51:55] differently for a purpose but this boy
[51:59] man had come into his own space I had an
[52:02] opportunity to meet Jesus his daddy
[52:04] never met Jesus his mama never never met
[52:07] Jesus but he was a product of what they
[52:09] had taught him in the home how they had
[52:12] raised him and when Jesus saw him he
[52:14] loved him he loved him he loved him I
[52:17] want I was just thinking on this
[52:19] other quote kind of comes to me and have
[52:21] not honest I sent thee brother Branham
[52:25] says some because you know you turn your
[52:27] kids over to the priests a man uh this
[52:33] come to my mind and I and I gotta be
[52:35] careful how I say this I you know but
[52:37] there was a it's like it's I don't mean
[52:40] to make the pulpit a place for choke a
[52:42] man but there was a situation over the
[52:47] last couple years a couple of videos
[52:49] kind of surface on social media and
[52:51] there was a preacher man that man when
[52:54] he preached he just he just he pretty
[52:56] much just go off on the congregation he

[53:36] you can trust that you can give them
[53:38] over to a pastor that's not gonna take
[53:41] advantage of them a pastor that's gonna
[53:43] tell them the truth where they hurt them
[53:45] or help them the past is going to tell
[53:48] them the truth and mom and daddy can't

[54:50] because of what you planted in them all
[54:53] right hallelujah glory to God you got to
[54:56] teach them a man yet they need to know
[54:58] the roles of the teacher and how to

[55:50] me have not I sit thee
[55:52] it says sometimes I preach pretty rough
[55:56] I said Lord Jesus sometimes I preach
[56:01] pretty rough because I see somebody

[56:06] supposed to do that look at this he says
[56:09] a real daddy will when he why he shake

[56:42] love him just that much more because
[56:44] he's a
[56:45] father - you see trying to keep you
[56:48] lined up because he's watching over your
[56:51] soul which the Holy Ghost has made him
[56:53] the oversee of the church and you must
[56:55] always watch that see that's what you're

[57:04] down on you just to come down and he's
[57:05] watching over your soul hallelujah

[57:14] the middle of the street a man and cars
[57:17] are coming and and and the board say you
[57:19] know I just want to go out here and play

[58:01] father's doing that when the phone is
[58:03] corrected his child hallelujah amen

[58:11] child

[58:15] ain't got time to explain how you can
[58:18] get hurt by a car but listen to what I'm
[58:20] saying don't do that same thing when the
[58:24] Holy Spirit is speaking through the
[58:25] pastor don't do that I don't want you to
[58:28] miss the rapture I don't want I don't
[58:31] want you to end up in hell praise the

[1:02:30] happy Father's Day I didn't know him
[1:02:33] like that right I didn't know him but
[1:02:35] but but but see that the badge of daddy

[1:02:41] man that actually put food on the table

[1:02:45] me into this world but he did everything

[1:04:20] but you know he got paid but the next
[1:04:22] month I made sure I was ready that I
[1:04:24] didn't have to go back to daddy
[1:04:26] because see if daddy feel like you

[1:04:41] own house praise the Lord somebody
[1:04:45] hallelujah daddy put up to put too much
[1:04:47] out at work all glory to God dad after
[1:04:51] put up with a lot of stuff out at work I
[1:04:53] was I won't even
[1:04:55] I won't I won't read it I was just I'll
[1:04:57] just I'll speak this brother branham
[1:04:59] saying how God would come down in the
[1:05:01] cool of the evening a man that he would
[1:05:04] have fellowship with Adam and Eve you
[1:05:06] know there in the beginning and and I
[1:05:08] was just watching that statement say how
[1:05:10] God would come down in the cool of the
[1:05:12] evening to have fellowship with Adam and
[1:05:14] Eve that that is that's exactly what
[1:05:17] happens in households today right God
[1:05:21] what God was showing a man at the very
[1:05:23] beginning how households would be set up
[1:05:26] to date oh come on somebody he didn't
[1:05:29] come down in the morning but God was
[1:05:32] coming down in the cool of the evening
[1:05:33] this is after that it gets off work
[1:05:36] daddy a little tired and when were out
[1:05:39] from the day and but the kids at home
[1:05:41] waiting on him when he walked through
[1:05:43] the door the kids are ready to jump on
[1:05:45] and pounce on him and you know somehow
[1:05:47] daddy got enough strength to let the
[1:05:50] kids grab him around the leg and jump on
[1:05:53] his back even though he had a hard day's
[1:05:55] work
[1:05:56] daddy got enough strength to sit and
[1:05:58] work with him a man with a home worker
[1:06:00] whatever the meat is if they need to
[1:06:02] talk to him daddy got enough strength to
[1:06:06] work with them kids daddy would do these
[1:06:08] things in the cool of the evening why
[1:06:11] because that's a string a fatherhood God
[1:06:15] God set that strain at the very
[1:06:17] beginning so when daddy does that it's
[1:06:20] just a strain of gene from God that it's
[1:06:23] operating out of that father you see
[1:06:28] daddy is an affectionate term and I
[1:06:33] remember you know I was just you know
[1:06:34] meditating this week and just thinking
[1:06:36] about different times that I had to call
[1:06:38] my daddy you know and you get to you get
[1:06:41] to a stage in life where you feel like
[1:06:43] you don't need them like you used to
[1:06:45] need them you want to prove to them that
[1:06:46] you don't need them there was there was
[1:06:48] times that I would see daddy pay the
[1:06:51] bill we all go out to eat and daddy
[1:06:53] would pull out some money and he paid a
[1:06:55] bill and but by daddy doing that he
[1:06:57] don't know he was saying something to me
[1:07:00] when daddy was paying the bill daddy was
[1:07:02] saying something to me he he didn't even
[1:07:04] have to use words his action said son
[1:07:07] you got to step up one day and you're
[1:07:09] gonna have to pay the bill and I
[1:07:12] couldn't wait to get to the point in my
[1:07:14] life where you know I could take daddy
[1:07:16] out to eat and I could tell there to
[1:07:18] keep you keep your wallet in your pocket
[1:07:20] somebody say man daddy keep your wallet
[1:07:26] in your pocket daddy I got this you know
[1:07:29] bad because he has a relationship with
[1:07:32] you daddy look at saying like are you
[1:07:35] sure you got it because if you ain't got
[1:07:37] it I'm here to take care of some things
[1:07:39] daddy I'm always
[1:07:41] come true and see if your if you if your
[1:07:44] earthly father was like that what do you
[1:07:48] think your heavenly father is if daddy
[1:07:51] wants to provide for you daddy wants to
[1:07:53] pay for your dinner then your heavenly
[1:07:56] father also will supply for you he wants
[1:07:59] to pay for your dinner he wants to put
[1:08:01] clothes on your back he wants to put
[1:08:03] shoes on your feet your heavenly father
[1:08:07] he wants to take care of you whatever
[1:08:11] you need is daddy wants to step up that
[1:08:17] string that's in and amend the water try
[1:08:20] to take care of his family
[1:08:22] that's the strain of fatherhood and that
[1:08:25] comes from Almighty God it's not
[1:08:30] supposed to be in a man and not want to
[1:08:32] take care of his family it's not
[1:08:34] supposed to be in a man I want to run
[1:08:36] from run from it when the window window
[1:08:38] when things get a little tight he want
[1:08:39] to run that's not supposed to be in a
[1:08:41] man that's the devil perverting
[1:08:43] something but but the straining of
[1:08:45] fatherhood say I'm a step up so my daddy
[1:08:47] was just just just just pay the bill he
[1:08:50] was pretty much telling someone that he
[1:08:52] didn't have to say it to me but I knew
[1:08:53] one day I got a stuff and I got to do it
[1:08:55] I got to do it and praise God I did it
[1:09:00] and I still do it
[1:09:03] glory to God but and but I do feel good
[1:09:06] when you when you can say daddy I got it
[1:09:08] because when your kids say that that
[1:09:10] means you don't impart it something you
[1:09:14] don't deposit it something you know what
[1:09:15] and without you ever saying a word they
[1:09:18] got it they got it they understand
[1:09:23] hallelujah somebody glory to God glory
[1:09:27] to God
[1:09:28] hey man I was just you know just
[1:09:30] reflecting Lester you know I remember
[1:09:33] you know cuz a dad is an affectionate
[1:09:35] term and when you going to Daddy to ask
[1:09:39] for anything you got to know that daddy

[1:09:44] became an adult and out on my own there
[1:09:47] wasn't many things I have to go back
[1:09:48] home and ask daddy for but one thing

[1:09:51] house I had to go home

[1:09:57] how to get this $4,500 and and I say I'm

[1:11:14] they gonna figure out a way to get it

[1:12:51] that he don't had a breakdown but Papa
[1:12:53] God you got to have a relationship with
[1:12:56] Jesus Christ that you can approach him
[1:12:59] as Papa taught praise God daddy has a
[1:13:10] very unique role in the family I want to
[1:13:12] read to you some statistics this these
[1:13:18] stats are talking about the impact that
[1:13:20] dad's faith will have on their kids
[1:13:23] church attendance if a father does not
[1:13:32] go to church even if his wife does only
[1:13:39] one child and fifty will become a
[1:13:41] regular worshiper if a father does not
[1:13:45] go to church even if his wife does only
[1:13:48] one child in fifty will become a regular
[1:13:50] worshiper if a father does go regularly
[1:13:57] to church regardless of what the mother
[1:14:01] does the stats say between two thirds
[1:14:04] and three quarters of their children
[1:14:07] will attend church as adults see they
[1:14:12] walk sin daddy if a father at Ann's
[1:14:17] Church irregularly let me he come
[1:14:20] sometime
[1:14:22] between half and two-thirds of their
[1:14:24] kids will attend church with some
[1:14:26] regularity as adults it won't be things
[1:14:31] would echo everyone's wrong even if
[1:14:32] Daddy just goes sometime if a mother
[1:14:36] does not go to church but a father does
[1:14:39] a minimum of 2/3 of their children will
[1:14:41] end up attending church all right
[1:14:43] another one if a father does not go to
[1:14:47] church but the mother does an average of
[1:14:50] 2/3 of their children will not attend
[1:14:54] church here's another one when both
[1:15:00] parents attend Bible study uh-oh now we
[1:15:04] don't win a little further than just
[1:15:05] going to church on Sunday morning praise
[1:15:09] the Lord
[1:15:09] about but when both parents attend Bible
[1:15:13] study amen in addition to the Sunday
[1:15:16] service seventy-two percent of their
[1:15:19] children attend Sunday school when
[1:15:22] they're grown but can you imagine that
[1:15:26] their children will go to Sunday school
[1:15:28] when they adults because they parents
[1:15:31] went to Bible study and church so you
[1:15:36] don't realize your decisions affect
[1:15:38] generations you got to get through what
[1:15:41] you're going through because there's
[1:15:43] effective generations watch this now
[1:15:46] when only the father 10 Sunday School
[1:15:50] 55% of the children will attend when
[1:15:53] they're grown when only the mother
[1:15:56] attend Sunday school 15% of their
[1:16:02] children will attend when they're grown
[1:16:03] now notice when the father does it 55
[1:16:06] percent of the kids go but when the
[1:16:08] mother's only one doing only 15 percent
[1:16:10] goes see them the stats are greater when
[1:16:14] the father's actually involved it's
[1:16:16] another when neither parent attend
[1:16:19] Sunday school only 6 percent of the
[1:16:21] children will attend when they're grown
[1:16:24] 94 percent fall off look at this some
[1:16:28] more it's the most stats if
[1:16:33] tchau is the first person in a household
[1:16:36] to become a Christian there is a 3.5
[1:16:40] percent probability that everybody else
[1:16:43] in the house will follow that child 3.5%
[1:16:47] hallelujah
[1:16:48] if mama is the first to become a
[1:16:52] Christian there is a 17 percent
[1:16:55] probability that everybody else in that
[1:16:58] household will follow but when Daddy
[1:17:04] it's the first to become a Christian
[1:17:10] when Daddy is the first to become a
[1:17:12] Christian
[1:17:13] there is a 93 percent probability
[1:17:20] everybody else in my household come
[1:17:24] follow daddy 93 percent so when daddies
[1:17:31] remain committed great things happen
[1:17:34] even statistics short when daddies
[1:17:38] remain committed committed to God if you
[1:17:44] ever want to leave our heritage if you
[1:17:48] ever want to leave something really
[1:17:50] really important leave them the heritage
[1:17:52] of faith show them that are you going to
[1:17:58] church see I go back to my daddy my
[1:18:00] daddy wasn't a church-going man when we
[1:18:03] came up now you know what when we first
[1:18:06] started yes dad we used to see daddy to
[1:18:08] go to church all the time now we didn't
[1:18:09] know what happened and what caused dad
[1:18:11] and stop going to church we didn't
[1:18:13] realize what happened but I know when
[1:18:16] the ministry started here you know my
[1:18:18] daddy uh my daddy started coming and
[1:18:20] fellowshipping and-and-and and I
[1:18:22] remember him and my mama having a
[1:18:23] conversation and momma say you know you
[1:18:25] need to get out there here you son you
[1:18:26] need to hear you sir and my daddy say I
[1:18:29] already hear him I'm gonna say how you
[1:18:30] hear him you don't go to church how you
[1:18:32] hear you say every time I get in your
[1:18:34] car you got a tape going from the
[1:18:36] service and I'm hearing my son
[1:18:39] hallelujah CCC daddy and Mama could
[1:18:44] vouch to say I probably had two
[1:18:45] preachers
[1:18:46] for sway back then because I remember
[1:18:48] when I was in the house dad would tell
[1:18:49] me say son you talk solely just talk so
[1:18:55] loud sir
[1:18:56] the preachers voice I didn't realize it
[1:18:59] back then right
[1:19:00] but you know you know that that there's
[1:19:02] various times a man that I one specific
[1:19:06] incident that I remember daddy didn't go
[1:19:07] to church much but I remember one time
[1:19:09] you know the family wanted to walk to
[1:19:11] church and me and my brother were way
[1:19:12] too cool to be walking to church not on
[1:19:16] a Sunday the boys gonna see us way too
[1:19:20] cool to be doing something like that so
[1:19:22] uh my daddy took off going to church
[1:19:25] with mama and my daddy gave us a little
[1:19:26] space to say okay y'all then gotta walk
[1:19:28] with us but y'all better be coming
[1:19:30] behind us okay daddy will come behind
[1:19:33] you what we took our post week time
[1:19:35] getting ready before we knew it we won
[1:19:38] we didn't have watches we went watching
[1:19:40] the clock we we just we were gonna come
[1:19:43] but we weren't coming on the way my
[1:19:45] daddy's time was right and before we
[1:19:48] know we was in like we was in the house
[1:19:49] and and we were getting ready and taking
[1:19:52] on supposed to be starting and and they
[1:19:54] had already gone and before we knew it
[1:19:56] the front door swung open and that dose
[1:20:02] when we lay who in the world busting
[1:20:04] themselves like this it was my daddy
[1:20:06] didn't I tell y'all to be right behind
[1:20:09] us
[1:20:09] yes daddy he didn't he didn't amen
[1:20:15] just just that example that he set there
[1:20:19] Amen it calls us I'll help us to realize
[1:20:21] church was important to him especially
[1:20:25] for his children even though he weren't
[1:20:29] going as much but but later on when we
[1:20:31] began to understand things of life we
[1:20:33] knew why daddy wasn't going to church he
[1:20:35] was looking for something real
[1:20:38] my daddy was looking for something real
[1:20:42] and when my daddy found something real
[1:20:45] he remain committed if a father is the
[1:20:57] first one that become a Christian in
[1:20:58] this family and faithfully serves God
[1:21:01] it's a 93 percent chance that everybody
[1:21:07] just in his household will follow every
[1:21:09] child mama everything in the household
[1:21:13] follows because daddy has made this
[1:21:15] commitment I know there we have not
[1:21:18] nowadays a lot of single dads you just
[1:21:20] keep doing what you're supposed to be
[1:21:21] doing God gonna take care of the rest
[1:21:23] even statistics show it God gonna take
[1:21:27] care of the rest
[1:21:32] there's this quote he was the past that
[1:21:43] way the Prophet makes a statement here
[1:21:46] he says could you imagine I had people
[1:21:49] tell me - tell me brother branham I
[1:21:51] would ask God to heal me but I know he's
[1:21:55] busy random in this message he was to
[1:22:00] pass that way says that people come and
[1:22:02] say so but I just know he's too busy I
[1:22:04] know he's busy says my could you imagine
[1:22:08] a little fish about that long out in the
[1:22:14] middle of the of the Atlantic Ocean
[1:22:17] saying I better drink of this water
[1:22:19] sparingly I may run out someday ha ha ha
[1:22:24] that's just as intelligent of thinking
[1:22:27] that you are that you could ever exhaust
[1:22:30] God's goodness to you can you imagine
[1:22:33] you can't exhaust God's goodness to you
[1:22:35] says could you imagine a little mouse
[1:22:38] about that long under the great darkness
[1:22:40] of Egypt saying I just better eat two
[1:22:43] grains a day it may not last through the
[1:22:46] winter oh my you can't he won't just you
[1:22:51] wants you to ask abundant so that your
[1:22:55] Joy's could be fool look at this don't
[1:22:58] be afraid to ask God for anything for he
[1:23:03] is he's willing more willing to give it
[1:23:06] than you ought to receive it if we just
[1:23:09] get that little shadow wipe the way to
[1:23:12] know that he's willing to do it you're
[1:23:14] his children he loves you saying you
[1:23:19] know how you like to minister and do
[1:23:21] good things to your children how much
[1:23:24] that very strain of fatherhood of parent
[1:23:28] to your children comes from God the
[1:23:34] Prophet is stripes I mean I'm talking
[1:23:36] about dollar straight on with this let
[1:23:38] me just finish reading this he says that
[1:23:40] very strain of fatherhood of parent to
[1:23:43] your children comes from God because
[1:23:45] he's the father of us all
[1:23:47] He loves us he wants he wants to do for
[1:23:50] us if he could just get us lined up with
[1:23:52] the blessings and so forth he can trust
[1:23:54] us and say then he said that the heaven
[1:23:57] is open to all of us I was thinking of
[1:23:59] God coming down in the cool of the
[1:24:01] evening right and I was just you know he
[1:24:04] was talked about thinking about thinking
[1:24:05] on God coming down in the cool of the
[1:24:07] evening he would come down and check on
[1:24:08] his children the cool of the evening
[1:24:10] amen and that was a very appropriate
[1:24:12] thing that God was doing because it was
[1:24:14] it was actually telling us what life
[1:24:16] would be like today how fathers would
[1:24:18] come home in the cool of the evening sit
[1:24:20] down with their children hallelujah and
[1:24:23] that that when they're doing that it's a
[1:24:25] strain of fatherhood a gene from God
[1:24:28] that has been expressed through that
[1:24:30] daddy to his family Oh glory to God I
[1:24:34] like that I like that this scripture
[1:24:39] that we read like as a father pitieth
[1:24:40] his children Psalms 103 and 13 like as a
[1:24:45] father pitieth his children so the Lord
[1:24:48] pities them that fear him and that word
[1:24:51] pity means to to love deeply to have
[1:24:55] mercy to be compassionate to have tender
[1:24:59] affection have compassion now you know
[1:25:02] typically when a child is first born
[1:25:05] man the daddy just has a it's a glow
[1:25:10] about him he just he just want to hold
[1:25:13] them he wanna kiss them he want to do
[1:25:15] this he he want to lay them on his chest
[1:25:17] and he want to do all kind of things
[1:25:19] there's a there's a tender affection
[1:25:21] however when the child needs that diaper
[1:25:23] change
[1:25:24] glory daddy that daddy loses somebody
[1:25:33] perfection and the dad is holding a
[1:25:36] child up and taking it right to mama
[1:25:38] something don't smell right they give it
[1:25:43] to mama you know but but you know what
[1:25:44] I'll tell you what if there's ever time
[1:25:47] like you know I recently had my grandson
[1:25:49] and my wife had to go take care of
[1:25:51] something and I had them for you know I
[1:25:52] let I take we had an eight-hour day say
[1:25:55] okay you got seven hours I'll take the
[1:25:57] eighth hour I figured he'd be sleeping
[1:26:01] everything else and I'm good but he was
[1:26:04] awakened and he needs that diaper change
[1:26:06] I'm like okay it's time to own up mama
[1:26:10] I mean grandma here granddaddy here
[1:26:12] granddaddy need to step up and do
[1:26:13] something I could sit there and say yeah
[1:26:15] I'm gonna just wait till your grandma
[1:26:16] get back but no no sometimes daddy you
[1:26:18] got to step up
[1:26:20] praise the Lord amen and that compassion
[1:26:24] just okay it's not and now it's time for
[1:26:26] me to kind of step in and do what I need
[1:26:27] to do here with my with my grandson
[1:26:29] hallelujah
[1:26:30] I was just just meditating you know on
[1:26:34] the scription on these words there's
[1:26:36] times that even my own daughters but
[1:26:39] when they approach me as daddy they can
[1:26:42] get me to milk there was there was a
[1:26:45] time a man not that they look older they
[1:26:47] don't get me that that like that no more
[1:26:49] I don't learn the game but what a my
[1:26:52] daughter she just used daddy we want to
[1:26:55] go shopping and it wasn't dad we just
[1:26:57] want you to drive us cuz I know if I
[1:27:00] Drive them I might actually get end up
[1:27:02] going in the store and if I go in the
[1:27:05] store I'm not gonna shop but I got
[1:27:07] something in my pocket praise the Lord
[1:27:10] better help them while they shop so so
[1:27:14] when they never get there and they know
[1:27:15] because I you know as a daddy
[1:27:18] not that I pity my child but you know
[1:27:19] what I want to be able to come through
[1:27:21] for so you won't that all right I got it
[1:27:24] for you you want that I got it for you
[1:27:26] you want that I got it free then I start
[1:27:28] realizing I'm gonna always be getting
[1:27:30] and I'm gonna have to let them get it
[1:27:31] sometime
[1:27:31] praise the Lord some hallelujah but
[1:27:35] whenever daddy would you do this daddy
[1:27:37] that's a term of affection and I'm gonna
[1:27:42] tell you if that strain is in me to want
[1:27:45] to come through for my daughters
[1:27:47] what do you think Amen it's in God that
[1:27:50] wants to come through for all of his
[1:27:51] children what you see expressed through
[1:27:56] the father hallelujah is what God is
[1:28:00] actually trying to express to you
[1:28:01] himself
[1:28:04] brother Branham used to he made a
[1:28:06] statement say I thought the father
[1:28:08] actually hated me I thought he didn't
[1:28:12] like me he said but I learned he said
[1:28:14] thought Jesus loved him but the father
[1:28:16] just really didn't like me just didn't
[1:28:17] like myself he said but what I learned
[1:28:19] is that Jesus was the very heart of God
[1:28:21] Jesus was the very heart of God let me
[1:28:24] um hallelujah I think I just want to
[1:28:28] read that and then I want to I want to
[1:28:30] go into something here Jesus was a very
[1:28:32] heart of God oh thank you Jesus oh my I
[1:28:38] think I misplaced it but that's okay
[1:28:41] you'll find it if you're looking for it
[1:28:44] Jesus himself was the very heart of God
[1:28:46] I want to circle back now yeah this is
[1:28:50] the identified with Christ identified
[1:28:52] with Christ it's using this as an in a
[1:28:55] prayer and then I want to just kind of
[1:28:56] circle back to our scripture mark 5 mark
[1:28:59] 4 says let us pray now Heavenly Father
[1:29:01] we are grateful to thee for the goodness
[1:29:03] of Jesus Christ who is the sin of love
[1:29:06] and I used to think that you were angry
[1:29:09] with me but Jesus loved me but I find
[1:29:12] out now that Jesus is the very heart of
[1:29:15] God hallelujah so I know that you love
[1:29:18] me and suffer for me and father God I
[1:29:21] pray for this world today and for our
[1:29:23] country
[1:29:24] I pray Lord for forgiveness of my own
[1:29:26] mistakes and for the mistakes of my
[1:29:29] people the people that you give me
[1:29:32] to ship it over now this is brother
[1:29:33] branham's prayer okay and it says and I
[1:29:36] pray that you'll bless them and every
[1:29:38] one of the people that's been in this
[1:29:40] little meeting that's asked questions
[1:29:42] maybe I've said something contrary to
[1:29:44] what they believe Lord I can't explain
[1:29:46] it myself I'm unable will you just let
[1:29:50] them know father that in my heart what I
[1:29:52] mean please I pray you'll do that bless
[1:29:55] them together bless us now as we're
[1:29:57] waiting on your word just a few moments
[1:30:00] before baptismal service help us to
[1:30:02] speak that which is right help us in the
[1:30:04] message in this message to knock my
[1:30:06] throat being a little a little husky I
[1:30:07] pray that you'll help me dear God and
[1:30:09] you'll even heal the sick and afflicted
[1:30:11] that's in the midst of the people for we
[1:30:13] ask it in Jesus name Amen brother
[1:30:15] Branham was staying here in his prayer I
[1:30:17] used to think God was angry with me and
[1:30:20] that Jesus loved me but he found out
[1:30:23] that Jesus was the very heart of God
[1:30:26] Jesus was the very heart of God as I
[1:30:35] meditated on that just a couple of
[1:30:36] things came to me you know when we want
[1:30:38] to look at the heart of God and how he
[1:30:40] feels about us even when we've strayed
[1:30:42] away from him we go back to the story
[1:30:44] that Jesus told of the prodigal son amen
[1:30:48] and as you just look at that story you
[1:30:50] can actually feel the heart of God and
[1:30:51] what a father represents a man daddy did
[1:30:55] not appreciate when the board rose up
[1:30:57] and said you know what I want I want my
[1:30:58] own I want my inheritance and I'm
[1:31:01] leaving house right now dad and never
[1:31:03] really appreciated that but daddy never
[1:31:05] stopped the boy daddy let the boy go on
[1:31:08] and do exactly what he wanted to do what
[1:31:09] he thought he was big and bad enough to
[1:31:11] do daddy let the boy go
[1:31:12] but daddy never stopped praying for his
[1:31:14] son remember those stats now I know if
[1:31:16] I'm raising my kid the right way if I'm
[1:31:19] leading by example there is a 93 percent
[1:31:22] chance that this boy coming back
[1:31:24] hallelujah there's a not I'm gonna tell
[1:31:28] you something I'm gonna take my chance
[1:31:30] on living right if it's a ninety three
[1:31:33] percent chance that my child gonna
[1:31:35] follow my footsteps I'm gonna take my
[1:31:38] chance on living right
[1:31:41] what's I never said I know what I did I
[1:31:44] know what I sold him I bought another
[1:31:46] example that I said I don't know where
[1:31:47] he gonna end up I don't know his story
[1:31:49] but I just have I have a I have a
[1:31:51] feeling that some point time this boy
[1:31:52] won't come back for the RAM said that
[1:31:53] the dad was out there praying all the
[1:31:55] time constantly praying praying for his
[1:31:59] boy lord do something send your angel to
[1:32:01] touch him sin God I mean get his
[1:32:03] attention some kind of way didn't know
[1:32:05] what his boy was doing the boy got bored
[1:32:06] and spinning up all his money got to
[1:32:08] hanging with the wrong people
[1:32:10] amen God got so low that he had to take
[1:32:12] a job that he shouldn't have never had
[1:32:15] hallelujah they're taking care of pigs
[1:32:17] and as a as a as a Jewish person he was
[1:32:21] not supposed to be anywhere near Pig but
[1:32:24] he had to take a job that he he
[1:32:26] shouldn't have had only because of the
[1:32:27] condition that he was in that is still
[1:32:30] praying dad is still praying and one day
[1:32:33] the boy said you know brother branham
[1:32:35] said angel went to the boy as dad it was
[1:32:36] praying that angel once was born and
[1:32:38] just begin to just deal with his mind
[1:32:40] and and in the scripture said he came to
[1:32:41] himself and when the boy beginning to
[1:32:44] come them said I mean he begin to think
[1:32:46] about some stuff he you know it was
[1:32:48] better in my daddy's house and you know
[1:32:50] the servants even live better in my dad
[1:32:53] and what I want you to understand is
[1:32:54] that when this boy was coming back to
[1:32:56] the house daddy's house was still
[1:32:58] functioning amen daddy's house in
[1:33:01] changed because the boy left daddy's
[1:33:03] house was still functioning amen and the
[1:33:06] boy realized that even the servants live
[1:33:08] better in my daddy's house I don't have
[1:33:11] to go back and be a son but let me be a
[1:33:13] servant in daddy's house I'm gonna
[1:33:16] repent when I get back to daddy I'm
[1:33:17] gonna tell him how sorry I am
[1:33:19] it took something for that boy to come
[1:33:21] to that point but he had enough sure if
[1:33:24] it comes down I'm going back home to my
[1:33:26] daddy's house and as soon as I see daddy
[1:33:28] I'm gonna make things right
[1:33:29] come walking down the road and I can see
[1:33:32] daddy may be looking at with some
[1:33:33] binoculars and telling mama Here Come
[1:33:35] your boy how you know that's him because
[1:33:37] of the way he walk I know my boy I know
[1:33:40] my boy the way he walking is he's on his
[1:33:42] way home that you sure that's not that's

[1:33:49] on his son to get back and when he stood
[1:33:51] out there and the board come and say

[1:34:06] and I'm not even worth it because your
[1:34:08] son but daddy if you just let me be a
[1:34:10] servant in your house I'll be happy
[1:34:12] daddy daddy say you were born son and

[1:36:38] blood we're gonna celebrate his return
[1:36:41] cuz he he once was lost but now he's
[1:36:44] found he was dead but now he's alive
[1:36:46] we're gonna celebrate together when you
[1:36:48] want to understand the heart of God when
[1:36:50] it comes to fatherhood it just look at
[1:36:52] that story Jesus was the heart of God we
[1:37:02] read here in Scripture mark 4 they were
[1:37:07] on their way to the other side and Jesus
[1:37:11] giving him commandment to go to the
[1:37:12] other side and that's there on the way
[1:37:14] to the other side I love this because
[1:37:17] the scripture said that it wasn't just
[1:37:21] their ship that was going over but it
[1:37:23] was other little ships that's a question
[1:37:30] for you who you're rolling with let me
[1:37:37] ask another who you rollin wit who is
[1:37:42] your ride or die and see if I'm gonna
[1:37:51] get in some trouble
[1:37:52] I want to get in trouble with Jesus but
[1:37:59] these other little ships and even though
[1:38:03] they they they roll in amen on the Seas
[1:38:05] with with Jesus and he's in only in one
[1:38:08] boat now he's only one boat but because
[1:38:10] Amen they were in the sea at the same
[1:38:13] time jeez
[1:38:15] was in the sea then they had the
[1:38:17] opportunity to receive of the same
[1:38:20] blessing they might not even heard him
[1:38:23] speak to the storm but they felt the
[1:38:25] effects see see that's why it's good to
[1:38:32] just be in church it's good to be
[1:38:34] rolling with the right people you don't
[1:38:36] I mean you may not speak to us tongue
[1:38:38] but you will reap the benefits little
[1:38:46] ships disciples say not the king he'll
[1:38:51] do the other little ships and I mean
[1:38:53] they tryna they tryin to figure out what
[1:38:54] they gonna do too but the disciples got
[1:38:57] Jesus in the bone safe you know hey
[1:38:59] Jesus do you even care that we bout to
[1:39:02] die do you even care Jesus he rises up
[1:39:09] and just walks to the front of the boat
[1:39:10] and puts his foot up there and says
[1:39:12] peace be still and when he speaks to the
[1:39:15] the storm and a man in the waves and you
[1:39:18] know nay they realized not not only did
[1:39:20] the disciples in their boat see this but
[1:39:22] all the other little boats they saw that
[1:39:27] a man something just happened here so
[1:39:29] disciple like you know I'll tell us a
[1:39:31] WETA we don't even know what kind of man
[1:39:32] this is that would speak to the winds
[1:39:34] and the waves and they would obey Him
[1:39:38] who we are we rollin wit but the purpose
[1:39:48] of Jesus going through this great
[1:39:51] exercise if it's because there was a
[1:39:56] father that was in bondage there was a
[1:40:01] father that had lost his mind there was
[1:40:05] a father that was no longer going to
[1:40:08] church anymore there was a father that
[1:40:11] left his home because of pressure
[1:40:15] there's a father that has to come to
[1:40:18] amen the stress of life there was a
[1:40:22] father
[1:40:23] they had forsaken his responsibility
[1:40:26] and the very reason that Jesus would put
[1:40:29] himself in danger it's because he wants
[1:40:32] to get to this one father see there's a
[1:40:39] strain of fatherhood
[1:40:40] I mean God wants to give you his best
[1:40:43] God wants you to have his best God
[1:40:46] doesn't want to see his son and bondage
[1:40:48] like that
[1:40:49] so he would he would hear how Jesus
[1:40:50] leave a revival he have Jesus go through
[1:40:52] a stormy sea he have Jesus go through a
[1:40:54] great waves in order to get to one son
[1:41:01] we pick up this story in mark five let's
[1:41:05] just read it mark five first one they
[1:41:13] came over to the other side of the sea
[1:41:17] into the country of the gadarenes when
[1:41:22] he was come out of the ship immediately
[1:41:25] there met him out of the tombs a man
[1:41:28] with an unclean spirit now the Bible
[1:41:31] just says that this is a man with an
[1:41:33] unclean spirit and there there's so many
[1:41:36] things a man that we could say here the
[1:41:39] way that this man came into this
[1:41:40] condition brother Branham said one night
[1:41:42] he took his first smoke just by yielding
[1:41:48] to take that smoke brother random say
[1:41:52] spirit stepped into him then he went
[1:41:57] home and somebody asked him a question
[1:41:58] and he lied about his experience that
[1:42:01] night and another spirit stepped into
[1:42:05] him and then he did something else and
[1:42:09] maybe he went out another night and this
[1:42:10] time you're gonna take a drink and then
[1:42:15] maybe some what's that on your breath I
[1:42:17] smell sir I do and just just just going
[1:42:24] from from one spirit to the next spirit
[1:42:26] to the next beer to he had two thousand
[1:42:29] demons living on the inside of one man
[1:42:33] three thousand demons living on the
[1:42:34] inside of one man he never thought he'd
[1:42:39] be that way
[1:42:40] he probably a young man that went to
[1:42:41] Sunday school they probably did a lot of
[1:42:44] things right but but when he did the one
[1:42:46] thing wrong he opened himself up to
[1:42:48] other spirits look at this unclean
[1:42:52] spirits unclean the ones that make you
[1:42:54] not put on clothes
[1:42:56] those are unclean spirits huh look at
[1:43:00] this verse 3 says who had his dwelling
[1:43:06] among the tombs and no man could bind
[1:43:09] him no not with chains that means this
[1:43:11] man lived in a graveyard
[1:43:13] he left he had probably had his own
[1:43:15] house left the house moved into a
[1:43:17] graveyard what type of person would buy
[1:43:20] laying in a graveyard
[1:43:22] he didn't own the land he just lived
[1:43:23] amongst dead things and I'm telling
[1:43:26] y'all some of us living amongst dead
[1:43:28] things because that he had been often
[1:43:34] bound with fetters and changed and the
[1:43:40] chains have been plucked asunder by him
[1:43:41] and the land and the fetters broken in
[1:43:44] pieces neither could any man tame him he
[1:43:48] become a wild man and always night and
[1:43:51] day he was in the mountains and in the
[1:43:54] tombs crying cutting himself with stones
[1:43:57] I want to tell you that right there is a
[1:43:59] unclean spirit that has come into the
[1:44:01] land causing our young people to want to
[1:44:04] cut themselves praise the Lord that is
[1:44:07] an unclean spirit that is a demon from
[1:44:09] Hell doing that to our young people and
[1:44:11] one time they're gonna cut the wrong
[1:44:13] vein you're in the wrong place they can
[1:44:15] hit a vein and that's gonna be it the
[1:44:17] devil is trying to kill you you got the
[1:44:21] you get you got to you got to rise up
[1:44:23] and overcome that some kind of way if
[1:44:25] you need to stand altar and pray and
[1:44:26] still in altar and pray but rise up and
[1:44:28] defeat that devil this man was cutting
[1:44:31] himself just like young people today and
[1:44:33] even older people today try to cut
[1:44:35] themselves look at it verse 6 but when
[1:44:42] he saw Jesus afar off he ran and
[1:44:45] worshipped him and I love the way to
[1:44:46] script to read this because even though
[1:44:48] this man was in this condition he didn't
[1:44:50] really want to be in this condition
[1:44:52] this band was actually looking for an
[1:44:54] opportunity to come out of what he was
[1:44:56] in Jesus was his only opportunity so
[1:44:59] when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and
[1:45:02] worshipped him so even the devil's know
[1:45:04] who Jesus is hallelujah glory to God he
[1:45:08] ran and worshipped him and cried with a
[1:45:10] loud voice and said what have I to do
[1:45:13] with thee Jesus thou son of the Most
[1:45:16] High God I adjure thee by God that thou
[1:45:18] torment me not now how the devil gonna
[1:45:21] tell Jesus not the torment them but they
[1:45:24] tormenting this man God I'm living in a
[1:45:28] graveyard
[1:45:29] away from his family this is a father
[1:45:32] it's not just some men but this is a
[1:45:34] father that has left home he's been
[1:45:36] broken down by depression hallelujah
[1:45:39] what we need to learn how to do is
[1:45:40] sometimes get alongside of fathers and
[1:45:42] lift them back up encourage them some
[1:45:45] kind of way you know even as a wife you
[1:45:47] got to learn how to encourage your
[1:45:48] husband speak life over praise the Lord

[1:46:06] don't do that and don't don't be saying
[1:46:08] all kind of negative things about your
[1:46:10] husband to your kids and don't let your
[1:46:12] kids say negative things about your
[1:46:14] husband that is your daddy praise the
[1:46:18] Lord

[1:46:26] hold of your daddy all right

[1:46:32] crowd with a loud voice I said what have

[1:46:36] Most High God
[1:46:36] i adjure thee by god that thou torment
[1:46:38] me not for he said unto him come out of
[1:46:41] the man thou unclean spirit and he axed
[1:46:46] him
[1:46:46] what is that name not a demon having a
[1:46:50] conversation with Jesus any y'all ever
[1:46:52] want to talk to the Lord if a demon can
[1:46:55] have a conversation with him I know you
[1:46:58] can

[1:47:05] asked him what does that mean in the
[1:47:08] answer saying my name is legion for we
[1:47:11] are many you ain't just dealing with no
[1:47:13] one devil here it's a bunch us alright
[1:47:16] it says he besought him much that he

[1:47:20] not a devil has already he already
[1:47:23] received his his his statement come out
[1:47:28] of him
[1:47:29] but now the devil is talking back I was
[1:47:32] like please look at me say say that he
[1:47:35] might not send him away out of the
[1:47:37] country now he said now there was nigh
[1:47:39] unto the mountain a great herd of swine
[1:47:41] feeding and all the devil's besought him
[1:47:45] saying send us unto the swine that we
[1:47:48] may enter into them oh I love the way
[1:47:52] brother jinga bula put this here these
[1:47:54] Devils are praying asking Jesus for
[1:47:57] permission just don't send us to the
[1:48:00] abyss but send us to the swine the devil
[1:48:02] was asking permission had if they
[1:48:04] submitted a prayer request and forthwith
[1:48:14] Jesus gave them leave Devils got the
[1:48:21] prayer answered what you think about the
[1:48:24] children of God so so so I encourage you
[1:48:29] again don't ask for something small
[1:48:32] actually something big that only your
[1:48:36] daddy can handle because there's a
[1:48:41] strain of fatherhood that flows through
[1:48:44] your door through your Papa God where he
[1:48:48] wants to give you the things that you
[1:48:49] you can even imagine that he could give
[1:48:51] you don't actually something small
[1:48:53] actually something great see I only went
[1:48:55] to daddy when I needed daddy now if I
[1:48:59] could pay my my $30 bill I paid my $30
[1:49:01] bit but when he got the 300 I'm like I
[1:49:03] ain't got the 300 see there was a time
[1:49:06] where I used to have to take money out
[1:49:08] my piggy bank and put gas in my car
[1:49:11] guess y'all ain't never had to do
[1:49:14] count my pennies try to walk into the
[1:49:18] gas station when ain't too many people
[1:49:19] there y'all and y'all don't know nothin
[1:49:22] about that how much you want we got to
[1:49:26] count this up
[1:49:27] I want this hallelujah see I didn't want
[1:49:35] it I want my daddy to know that I was
[1:49:36] doing that bad that I had to take
[1:49:38] pennies to get gas now if I had I told
[1:49:40] my daddy he would've gave me money to go
[1:49:42] get the gas but I just didn't want to
[1:49:45] tell him some things I wanted to take on
[1:49:46] myself but sometimes you run into a
[1:49:50] situation where you just need to sit
[1:49:51] down and talk to Daddy
[1:49:53] stop bypassing him sit down and talk to
[1:49:56] him hallelujah he pities you he
[1:50:02] sympathizes with you and often times you
[1:50:05] know you don't you don't really find out
[1:50:07] things about your daddy until you start
[1:50:10] going through some stuff when you start
[1:50:14] dealing with some things in your own
[1:50:15] life now he can tell you about some of
[1:50:17] his experiences
[1:50:18] oh yeah ain't nothing I've been there
[1:50:21] I've done that and yeah that's happened
[1:50:22] a nap you're gonna be all right how you
[1:50:25] pay your ties it's gonna be all right
[1:50:30] you paid your ties I'm gonna tell you
[1:50:33] what God say he got them rebuke they
[1:50:35] devolved for you'll see that's what God
[1:50:38] said so you ain't got none to worry
[1:50:40] about daddy you should've you ain't got
[1:50:43] nothing to worry about never finish
[1:50:47] reading this and all the devil's
[1:50:52] besought him saying send us into the
[1:50:54] swine that we may enter into them
[1:50:57] forthwith Jesus gave them leave and the
[1:50:59] unclean spirits went out and entered
[1:51:02] into swine and the herd ran violently
[1:51:05] down a steep place into the sea they
[1:51:08] were about 2,000 and were choked in the
[1:51:11] sea two thousand demons says and they
[1:51:14] that fed the swine fled and told it in
[1:51:18] the city and in the country and they
[1:51:20] went out to see what it what it was that
[1:51:23] was done and when they come to Jesus
[1:51:26] see him that was possessed with the
[1:51:27] devil and had the legion sitting and
[1:51:30] clothed see this man the unclean spirit
[1:51:33] actually calls him to take clothes off
[1:51:35] and somebody asks a question brother
[1:51:37] Adam where does unclean spirits if you
[1:51:39] see people taking their clothes off
[1:51:40] those unclean spirits have come upon
[1:51:43] them amen we holy we dress holy we look
[1:51:46] holy
[1:51:47] all right look it says uh and they come
[1:51:51] to Jesus and see him that was possessed
[1:51:52] with the devil and had the Legion
[1:51:56] sitting and clothed and in his right
[1:51:57] mind and they were afraid and they that
[1:51:59] saw it told them how it be failed to him
[1:52:02] that was possessed with the devil and
[1:52:04] all also concerning the swine and they
[1:52:07] began to pray him to depart out of their
[1:52:10] coasts they asked Jesus to leave a man
[1:52:15] see these these people actually by being
[1:52:18] in gathering this is where this happened
[1:52:21] these people Ghaderi were also a part of
[1:52:23] the the tribes that did not go all the
[1:52:25] way into the Promised Land
[1:52:27] all right they stayed shorter problems
[1:52:30] then to it let us have our inheritance
[1:52:32] here so you don't stay short of it God
[1:52:34] got something else for you and by them
[1:52:36] stands short they don't even know how to
[1:52:37] respond to the supernatural they asked
[1:52:40] Jesus to leave actually you know I'm
[1:52:46] just I'm gonna just put it this way
[1:52:47] there's some people would prefer to see
[1:52:49] you bound than to see you free
[1:52:55] but Papa God prefers to see you free
[1:53:00] than to see you bow and Papa gotta go
[1:53:04] against what everybody else is thinking
[1:53:06] what everybody else is saying to get one
[1:53:08] captive set free let's finish this verse
[1:53:19] 17 they begin to pray him to depart out
[1:53:22] of their coasts and when he was coming
[1:53:24] to the ship he that had had been
[1:53:27] possessed with the devil prayed him that
[1:53:31] he might be with him so pretty much I
[1:53:32] want to go with you I don't I'm leavin
[1:53:34] the graveyard but I want to go with you

[1:54:10] all men did marvel and brother branham
[1:54:13] just come tells how this man was going

[1:55:28] Jesus did in this man's life now I want
[1:55:31] to tell you that was a strain of
[1:55:32] fatherhood that was being displayed
[1:55:34] through the life of Christ going through
[1:55:36] a stormy sea just to get to one soul
[1:55:41] that's how much he loves us you
[1:55:45] celebrate that one song just like he did
[1:55:48] with the prodigal son he celebrates that
[1:55:49] one soul because one stole is worth ten
[1:55:52] thousand
[1:55:53] world's it's a strain of fatherhood we
[1:55:58] see expressed and I fought this we see
[1:56:03] Express and past us we see expressed and
[1:56:07] God it is a strain of fatherhood
[1:56:13] hallelujah there's a little statement

[1:56:38] and say Oh Papa God I once was lost I
[1:56:41] was once in the muck of sin papa God and
[1:56:46] you saved me why people that's tried to
[1:56:51] express that switch went crazy well that
[1:56:53] man who wrote the last verse of the old
[1:56:55] love of God that was pinned on the
[1:56:57] insane wall of an institution who tried
[1:57:00] to express the love of God how that he
[1:57:02] stopped to save sinners and how that he
[1:57:04] did his love that come down to save you
[1:57:08] and I talked about worship angels don't
[1:57:11] know nothing about it the work the
[1:57:13] worship a angel only knows he stands
[1:57:17] there and and Wanda swings back and
[1:57:20] forth across hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:57:23] oh mercy when it comes to knowing that I
[1:57:25] was lost and now I'm found I was dead

[1:57:33] was saying I was muck I was down on the
[1:57:37] dump see when we realized how he is
