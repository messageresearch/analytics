[25:45] [Applause]
[26:06] hear me okay this song I'm going to sing
[26:11] was written by brother Andrew
[26:15] it's called 40 souls and it's about 40
[26:19] Christians who are about to become
[26:23] martyrs for their faith they were forced
[26:28] to stand out I believe on a frozen pond
[26:31] to freeze to death and one of the
[26:36] Christians became overwhelmed with
[26:40] facing death and retreated he
[26:43] surrendered and denounced his faith and
[26:46] one of the soldiers who was standing
[26:48] there saw the faith of the 39 and was
[26:55] instantly converted and went on to take
[26:59] on the punishment along with the other
[27:01] 39 to become the 40th one who would
[27:03] actually give up his life for his faith
[27:06] so this song is about becoming like that
[27:10] soldier to see the face of others and to
[27:13] enter into that faith and to give my all
[27:16] for what I believe in
[27:18] so that's what this song is about I pray
[27:20] it's a blessing to you I believe the
[27:24] words are in the system I think the song
[27:26] is called forth 40 soldiers

[57:59] hoping that when they do it again that
[58:00] more Saints to be able to come out and
[58:02] enjoy
[58:04] themselves there so just a there were a
[58:09] couple testimonies that were shared
[58:10] there and I'm hoping to get them and
[58:13] bring them back here because I thought
[58:14] they were very significant to some
[58:17] things that we had gone through and and
[58:19] I got a call of this brother to get all
[58:21] the details you know of it but I was I
[58:23] was really blessed by some things that I
[58:25] heard a man while we while we were there
[58:27] and I'll try to make sure I get that and
[58:28] bring it to you a couple things that'll
[58:30] be happening here you all heard the
[58:32] announcements on next week but let's go
[58:36] having the combined meeting for the
[58:39] churches that will be there for the West
[58:41] Coast Church on next next Sunday night
[58:42] so don't forget that I mentioned that I
[58:46] want to do questions and answers
[58:48] a man session and we got some questions
[58:51] that were given to us so on this Friday
[58:53] night this Friday night we will be doing
[58:56] the questions and answers a man on this
[58:58] Friday night so keep that in mind
[59:01] amen also I want to you all heard about
[59:05] brother for the brown a man and his
[59:08] celebration I think I got about five
[59:12] people that have come to me to say that
[59:16] they are going and announcement saying
[59:19] if you are planning to go to let me know
[59:21] so at this time I'm only expecting five
[59:28] right so if y'all going I need to know
[59:35] that don't assume that I know that I
[59:38] don't have that kind of discernment amen
[59:41] so five people so far so if you're going
[59:44] you need to let me know one get word to
[59:47] me quickly X or something just just let
[59:50] me know that that you're going so I can
[59:51] let the church know up there and those
[59:54] that are going a man and those if you
[59:57] can't go but you still want to be a part
[59:59] of it I was getting as a church I don't
[1:00:01] know why this is just going in and out
[1:00:02] on me it might be channel something I
[1:00:06] can't leave I could get this other one
[1:00:07] other mic here um but I was I was just
[1:00:11] thinking to my myself that we would as a
[1:00:16] church
[1:00:18] as a church
[1:00:20] maybe we can now give an offering amen
[1:00:24] towards this they have some expenses
[1:00:26] that are that are coming up
[1:00:29] amen okay I'm taking up the service over
[1:00:32] there and I know I would be I know comfy
[1:00:40] so no va voom capital equal-to Mohammed
[1:00:43] and say I wanna Blodgett senior woman
[1:00:55] cell community that's what about this
[1:01:08] one I won't have that problem I can
[1:01:11] guarantee you that a man yeah well they
[1:01:18] gotta be changed on both sides but
[1:01:20] that's fine and and also I just give
[1:01:22] this one to them as well they can change
[1:01:24] that one as well praise the Lord
[1:01:27] God is good so I was thinking that we as
[1:01:35] a church could maybe give an offering to
[1:01:36] help with some of the expenses amen
[1:01:38] there for what they're going to do for
[1:01:41] the brown there's a number of things not
[1:01:43] just expenses of the meetings but I told
[1:01:48] you all the Lord is blessing them with a
[1:01:50] a brand-new mobile home something
[1:01:53] brother Brown mr. Brown I've never
[1:01:54] experienced brother Brown being 90 years
[1:01:56] old and God wait till he get 92 give him
[1:02:00] a brand-new house what a god right what
[1:02:04] a God and you know so I was thinking
[1:02:07] that maybe we could just give a man
[1:02:09] towards that and what I'll actually to
[1:02:11] do if you want to be a part of that just
[1:02:13] just grab one of the envelopes and just
[1:02:16] you know write on it for brother Browns
[1:02:18] a love offering for brother Brown just
[1:02:20] write on it you can either stick it in
[1:02:22] the box or or just put an offer but I'm
[1:02:25] going to try to give something next week
[1:02:27] you know for them and if you want to be
[1:02:29] a part of that that blessings and just
[1:02:31] something Amen and I'll blow them to
[1:02:33] decide the box and we'll we'll take care
[1:02:35] of it
[1:02:36] also I just want to make mention a
[1:02:38] couple other things here we summertime
[1:02:43] was a rough time fourth you know the
[1:02:45] church but we're grateful that God
[1:02:47] brought us through but as as we're
[1:02:49] moving back into you know this didn't
[1:02:52] the next part of the year I'm still
[1:02:55] asking 37 people to give faithfully a
[1:02:58] hundred dollars a month and offering 37
[1:03:01] people give a hundred dollars a month an
[1:03:03] offering that'll take care the expenses
[1:03:05] here in the church so please continue to
[1:03:07] do that
[1:03:08] a man that'll be a big help also we have
[1:03:12] the Sioux City flyer there for Holy Land
[1:03:15] we're planning on doing that next year

[1:03:21] deposits for that if you desire to go to
[1:03:23] the Holy Land in 2018 there's a deposit
[1:03:26] of 300 dollars that you need to get to

[1:03:45] the cost is everything is there on the
[1:03:48] board for you if you have any questions
[1:03:50] please see me now I'll get that for you
[1:03:54] so we plan on going to Indiana September
[1:03:58] 3rd is the date that we will be there in
[1:04:02] Indiana
[1:04:02] September 1st 2nd and 3rd there's some
[1:04:06] some flying some driving but uh there'll
[1:04:09] be a great portion of the church that
[1:04:10] will be missing
[1:04:11] I think over two thirds of the church is
[1:04:14] going to Indiana so with that in mind
[1:04:17] the Saints that will not be going eh man
[1:04:19] I certainly wish that everybody could go
[1:04:21] I know to be a blessing to you but those
[1:04:23] that will not be going we won't have
[1:04:25] service on that day September 3rd amen
[1:04:28] the first Sunday in September we won't
[1:04:30] have service here at the church because
[1:04:32] most of the church will be gone so I
[1:04:34] want to encourage a man those that are
[1:04:37] that are not going please go to church
[1:04:40] somewhere don't take that as a holiday
[1:04:42] right let go go to church
[1:04:44] whereby the Wesco has service brother
[1:04:46] smiley has service brother gene has
[1:04:48] service and oftentimes you get
[1:04:50] invitations from your family and friends
[1:04:53] you tell them I can't come well guess
[1:04:55] what that would be a perfect thing that
[1:04:57] you can say I can come with you today
[1:04:58] because you know I don't like to miss my
[1:05:01] church but since you know our church is
[1:05:04] not having service I can come with you
[1:05:06] today so please take advantage of that
[1:05:08] on the 3rd September 3rd that's that we
[1:05:11] won't have service here so keep that in
[1:05:13] mind and for those that are going we
[1:05:18] have been given the responsibility of on
[1:05:22] Saturday night they having a singing
[1:05:27] service a worship service and so I was
[1:05:30] told they were maybe y'all kissing about
[1:05:32] a hour and a half of songs y'all think
[1:05:37] y'all got that in y'all so hour and a
[1:05:41] half of songs I've kind of already sent
[1:05:43] out a list a man of the songs that I was
[1:05:46] thinking you know thinking on for for us
[1:05:48] some will be with the choir some would
[1:05:50] just be solos but nonetheless it's
[1:05:53] something for us too to be able to go
[1:05:55] out and just be a blessing to the people
[1:05:58] there a man and not in New Albany so we
[1:06:03] need for those that are going I need to
[1:06:05] do some rehearsals and and I was
[1:06:07] actually hoping that we might be able to
[1:06:09] get one today and one next Sunday after
[1:06:11] service that would be very very helpful
[1:06:14] that way we can you know we can we'll be
[1:06:16] prepared for what we're doing you know
[1:06:18] when we go out there but they say they
[1:06:20] just want to move to the side and they
[1:06:22] just want us to just just take it and
[1:06:24] just sing I say well praise the Lord
[1:06:27] we'll do what the Lord has called us to
[1:06:29] do so so y'all be prepared if y'all can
[1:06:33] stay the day after service please do
[1:06:35] that let's do that today and let's get a
[1:06:36] couple songs together and and and you
[1:06:39] know just stuff let the Lord use that
[1:06:41] alright okay so two other things I need
[1:06:46] to make mention of a man and one of them
[1:06:53] a man
[1:06:55] is that our precious brother wisdom will
[1:07:00] be he's retired from working naturally
[1:07:04] and is also retired from song leading
[1:07:11] and and and he has been serving this
[1:07:17] church for well over ten years
[1:07:20] brother wisdom has been so faithful so
[1:07:23] faithfully he was an answer to prayer
[1:07:25] for me when we just did not have anybody
[1:07:31] and I was you know song leading and
[1:07:33] preaching and doing everything God sent
[1:07:35] brother wisdom and he stepped in he's
[1:07:38] just been you know just a real real
[1:07:41] blessing a man to me and I know to this
[1:07:44] church he's carried us for a number of
[1:07:46] years a number of years ladies alone and
[1:07:53] we were so so happy a man that God has
[1:07:57] used him for this time and and brother
[1:07:59] wisdom I really wanted to do more but I
[1:08:04] got a little something for you that I
[1:08:06] wanted to present to you a man here just
[1:08:10] in front of church and socialism you can
[1:08:13] come with them to receive it so it's the
[1:08:15] wisdom y'all might not know what she was
[1:08:16] in the background helping a man brother
[1:08:18] wisdom with a lot of things and we just
[1:08:23] we just appreciate them can they get a
[1:08:26] standing ovation
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:40] so this is something that I just wanted
[1:08:44] you to have for it for your home it just
[1:08:47] it's a little Eagle here and says
[1:08:50] brother Rodrick wisdom and appreciation
[1:08:53] for your dedicated service in the work
[1:08:55] of the Lord
[1:08:56] this is 2017 from Pastor Jack Duff and
[1:09:00] the Spirit of Truth Tabernacle family a
[1:09:02] man thank you
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:43] [Applause]
[1:09:55] praise the Lord thank you brother need a
[1:09:59] little power but no we thank God and
[1:10:04] just continue to pray for brother wisdom
[1:10:08] as well to thank God for all this
[1:10:10] service and and brother Branham even
[1:10:12] told us a man that like we have deacons
[1:10:16] and things of that nature in church they
[1:10:18] have a term that they serve and an after
[1:10:21] their term is finished and they have
[1:10:23] every right to retire all right so we
[1:10:27] just thank God for the service a man at
[1:10:29] that brother wisdom has given us in the
[1:10:31] way of some leading it
[1:10:32] so you'll see brother Solomon carrying a
[1:10:35] man a heavier load you know we
[1:10:38] appreciate him just kind of stepping in
[1:10:40] and doing that
[1:10:41] praise the Lord but if anybody know me
[1:10:48] have a word that I like to use anybody
[1:10:53] know that where it is replication and
[1:10:57] and that's not just a song that's even
[1:11:00] in preaching right I'm believing God
[1:11:02] either to send gifts or to raise up
[1:11:07] gifts in this church amen so that we
[1:11:12] don't have to call people all the time
[1:11:14] right I mean we got preachers here and
[1:11:18] we need them to step up raise the Optus
[1:11:20] right but uh you know I'm believing God
[1:11:24] for that and I'm believing God for
[1:11:25] helping the song leading area for
[1:11:28] brother Solomon as well but I'm one not
[1:11:30] just I like replication a man in every
[1:11:32] area I was reading a book recently and
[1:11:36] or Roberts life story and he made a
[1:11:38] comment there that that's become of just
[1:11:41] a theme of mine he said success without
[1:11:44] a successor is failure
[1:11:49] success without a successor its failure
[1:11:54] right so you have to plan properly in
[1:11:58] order for the church to go to keep going
[1:12:02] on the church ain't built on a
[1:12:03] one-person right so when that one person
[1:12:06] moves on then you got everybody got the
[1:12:08] kind of step in right that's that's the
[1:12:10] way it's supposed to be and when it you
[1:12:13] know I love the way this happen for
[1:12:14] brother wisdom goes like he didn't just
[1:12:16] leave and what nobody here no everything
[1:12:18] was just right everything right when
[1:12:21] when brother robliz gave us well enough
[1:12:24] time right say I'm gonna be leaving in a
[1:12:27] year I'm remember time when he did that
[1:12:29] people were here to step right into this
[1:12:31] place that's the way God do things right
[1:12:34] so so search I'm on the expectation for
[1:12:37] more preachers a man and more song
[1:12:39] leaders amen we under expectation for a
[1:12:43] man God God donut mighty worked with
[1:12:47] with our musicians we got replication
[1:12:49] going on there and I just meant I'm just
[1:12:51] I'm grateful for that so but I like the
[1:12:53] replication I like seeing a little
[1:12:55] differences you know and things like
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:58] don't don't wait for something drastic
[1:13:00] to happen before you get involved and
[1:13:03] man somebody following now I'll do it no
[1:13:07] no do it before that praise the Lord
[1:13:10] right so Amen we just we just we just we

[1:16:49] right I think that's all I need to
[1:16:51] announce and yeah that's it so let's
[1:16:57] read the word of the Lord
[1:17:08] start with me to mark chapter 11 verse
[1:17:14] 22 and I'll also pick up a scripture
[1:17:17] from Hebrews 11 to on today if we can
[1:17:22] mark chapter 11 starting at verse 22 all
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:38] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[1:17:40] faith in God
[1:17:42] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:17:44] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:17:47] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:17:49] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:17:51] shall believe that those things which he
[1:17:53] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[1:17:56] whatsoever he says therefore I say unto
[1:17:59] you what things soever you desire when
[1:18:01] you pray believe it's a critical word
[1:18:05] there key word when you pray believe
[1:18:09] that ye receive them and ye shall have
[1:18:13] him now that's that's if you believe
[1:18:16] you're gonna get it then you're gonna
[1:18:18] get it but the key thing is not whether
[1:18:20] God don't give it to you the key thing
[1:18:22] is you believe that he's going to give
[1:18:25] it to you amen no matter what it is if
[1:18:28] you would believe it you can get it
[1:18:30] alright so then when you stand praying
[1:18:33] forgive and if you have aught against
[1:18:35] any of that your father also which is in
[1:18:37] heaven may forgive you your trespasses
[1:18:38] but if you do not forgive neither will
[1:18:41] your father which is in heaven forgive
[1:18:42] your trespasses let's start over here to
[1:18:46] Hebrews 11 as well and just pick up a
[1:18:49] couple scriptures and then I'll start
[1:18:52] reading here verse 29 says by faith they
[1:18:58] passed through the Red Sea as by dry
[1:19:01] land which the Egyptians are saying to
[1:19:05] do were drown by faith the walls of
[1:19:08] Jericho fell down after they were
[1:19:10] compassed about seven days by faith the
[1:19:13] harlot Rahab perished not with them that
[1:19:16] believe not when she had received the
[1:19:18] spies with peace
[1:19:20] and what shall I say what shall I more
[1:19:22] say for the time with fail me to tell of
[1:19:24] gideon barak and of samson and of jetha
[1:19:29] and of David also on Samuel and of the
[1:19:32] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:19:34] kingdoms wrote wrought righteousness
[1:19:37] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[1:19:41] lions if I was to put you and this
[1:19:47] scripture today if they were writing
[1:19:50] about you and through faith they made a
[1:19:52] rack right that that's our title rapture
[1:19:57] and face a man quenched the violence of
[1:20:00] fire escaped the edge of the sword out
[1:20:03] of weakness were made strong waxed
[1:20:06] valiant and fight turn to turn to flight
[1:20:11] the armies of the aliens women received
[1:20:15] their dead raised to life again and
[1:20:18] others were tortured not accepting
[1:20:20] deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:20:22] better resurrection a man and others had
[1:20:26] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings a
[1:20:29] moreover bonds and imprisonment they
[1:20:32] were stoned they were sawn asunder were
[1:20:35] tempted were slain with the sword they
[1:20:37] wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:20:39] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[1:20:43] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:20:46] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:20:49] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:20:51] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:20:54] good report through faith received not
[1:20:57] the promise dot haven't provided some
[1:21:00] better things for us that they without
[1:21:03] us should not be made perfect amen the
[1:21:07] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:21:09] his word let's just bow and a quick word
[1:21:11] of Prayer God we're thankful for the
[1:21:14] opportunity to read Scripture but we
[1:21:17] know the Holy Ghost is what makes the
[1:21:20] scripture live to us so father we pray
[1:21:22] that you would make it live as we read
[1:21:25] there in prayer this morning from the
[1:21:28] book of Jael to
[1:21:31] before the Sun was darkened and the moon
[1:21:35] to blood there was an outpouring that
[1:21:39] was promised to the people so God as the
[1:21:43] world is getting ready for this eclipse
[1:21:46] on tomorrow God we're getting ready for
[1:21:48] an outpouring of the Spirit a man before
[1:21:51] the Eclipse so father we ask that you
[1:21:54] would just help us all to move ourselves
[1:21:55] on in a way and that you Lord Jesus
[1:21:57] would just get the glory in the honor
[1:21:59] out of everything that would happen here
[1:22:01] today and Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:22:05] god bless you can be seated amen our
[1:22:10] title thank you our title is rapturing
[1:22:15] faith amen we want to just take that
[1:22:18] title today rapturing faith and if I
[1:22:21] could just read from this message
[1:22:24] spiritual food and due season I happen
[1:22:27] to be listening to this this week and I
[1:22:30] heard this statement from the Prophet
[1:22:33] and it just kind of started me down this
[1:22:36] path a man of rapture and faith so let's
[1:22:38] look at this it says though I know many
[1:22:42] of you are standing again tonight and
[1:22:45] outside met groups that said they
[1:22:48] couldn't get in and they're listening to
[1:22:50] the radio in two different cars and now
[1:22:53] we'll try to make just as quick as we
[1:22:55] can tonight on Sunday night we give over
[1:22:59] to pray for the sick and have a prayer
[1:23:01] have a prayer line as we can get one up
[1:23:04] here but we are dedicating this service
[1:23:06] tonight for prayer for the sick and I
[1:23:08] want I want I want you to get built up
[1:23:11] now and this holy Oracles of God
[1:23:15] interface the faith of this hour is what
[1:23:19] it says it says the faith it's going to
[1:23:23] take more faith than ever was in any age
[1:23:28] for this has to be rapturing faith to be
[1:23:33] taken up amen and I like what he's
[1:23:36] saying here this age that we're living
[1:23:38] in is going to require more faith than
[1:23:40] any other and any any other age that is
[1:23:44] going
[1:23:44] long before us this faith will require
[1:23:47] rapturing feasts hallelujah amen not
[1:23:50] just headache things right not not to
[1:23:55] think faith come on somebody a man not
[1:23:58] not not not not I mean this is faith to
[1:24:01] have your body change right Amen if you
[1:24:04] don't have faith to just get get over a
[1:24:06] headache right I'll get over some of the
[1:24:09] illness or something like that attacking
[1:24:10] your body you're missing and you can
[1:24:13] just you can take that down there the
[1:24:15] thing of it is I absolutely believe that
[1:24:19] everything that comes against you no
[1:24:21] matter what it is everything that comes
[1:24:24] against you is there to challenge your
[1:24:27] faith and as is challenging your faith
[1:24:30] you may not realize it but your faith is
[1:24:33] developing your faith is growing into
[1:24:37] the faith that you need for this owl
[1:24:39] which is raptured thing a man so rather
[1:24:42] than complain about your problems rather
[1:24:45] than sit and get down about about what
[1:24:48] you going through and and you know you
[1:24:50] get certain people in your corner and
[1:24:51] you can have that whiny conversation and
[1:24:54] they'll cry with you amen not everybody
[1:24:56] on cry with you and that some people
[1:24:58] going to tell you just you know you
[1:24:59] happened you got to endure that you're
[1:25:01] gonna have to absorb that because God
[1:25:03] don't give you more than you can bear
[1:25:05] right and you need to understand that
[1:25:07] the reason that you got it because God
[1:25:09] is actually preparing your faith you
[1:25:12] might not realize that but he's
[1:25:13] preparing you whatever the sickness is
[1:25:15] God is preparing your faith and you
[1:25:19] gotta have something to strengthen your
[1:25:21] faith so thick dog I mean I believe it
[1:25:24] was changed a count it all joy and then
[1:25:28] don't don't get sad about it count it
[1:25:30] all joy no matter what you go through
[1:25:32] count it all joy
[1:25:33] I know gotta bring you out brother
[1:25:36] branham say in this hour we don't need
[1:25:38] more faith than we ever ever have it's
[1:25:41] got to be wrapped in faith to take us up
[1:25:43] and in and I was I was just looking at
[1:25:46] something as I was just kind of going
[1:25:48] through this and there's a prayer line
[1:25:49] that the Prophet was having and I he was
[1:25:52] praying for different people and various
[1:25:54] things was going on and man just know it
[1:25:56] was all over the place
[1:25:57] any any acts of question say what about
[1:25:59] up in the balcony there you know it's
[1:26:01] like its face up on this side and it's
[1:26:02] based on that side but what about up in
[1:26:04] the balcony there and then like in
[1:26:06] trying to get the people up there in the
[1:26:08] balcony to get a hold of faith because
[1:26:10] if you have if they have faith in the
[1:26:12] audience they can pull the angel off the
[1:26:14] platform right to their seat and brother
[1:26:16] Randall often times you will see him say
[1:26:18] oh this first of all means you got this
[1:26:20] you got that and the person behind you
[1:26:21] they got this in the person I'm using
[1:26:23] you just see how paints just moving all
[1:26:25] over the audience so I think what about
[1:26:26] in the balcony and it's a I feel one of
[1:26:29] them she don't even realize she's got
[1:26:31] that thing playing say I feel a woman he
[1:26:36] said what about in the back say I see a
[1:26:37] woman in the balcony she don't even
[1:26:39] realize that she's got that big it's a
[1:26:42] hidden face right she don't even confess
[1:26:45] it that that's what he said she don't
[1:26:48] even confess it but she's got thing and
[1:26:51] I feel woman this woman the church is
[1:26:53] the woman that I see and she may not
[1:26:56] realize it but she's already got the
[1:26:59] rapture insane it's already only inside
[1:27:03] of you everything you need for the watch
[1:27:05] is already inside of you
[1:27:08] hallelujah somebody see you know we've
[1:27:12] been we've been taught for years at this
[1:27:14] and add that and add this and add that
[1:27:16] but you know it's not adding brother
[1:27:18] branham say when you truly born again it
[1:27:20] will automatically automatically add to
[1:27:26] you if you're truly fall again you gotta
[1:27:29] work this up this is this is automatic
[1:27:32] it's already in you God places it in you
[1:27:36] you live in a day where people got to
[1:27:38] catch the rapture see back in that day
[1:27:41] they repaired the Lions and they had to
[1:27:42] have a faith to be able to stand there
[1:27:45] from a lions that song that that was
[1:27:49] written here brother and you wrote it
[1:27:50] you all heard it and you know and the
[1:27:53] song is inspired from these forty people
[1:27:57] right here that you know that they said
[1:28:01] look we're gonna throw you in this this
[1:28:02] reason water but Andrews given me some
[1:28:04] more history on that I said Maya I
[1:28:07] didn't get a chance to read it but he
[1:28:08] was giving me some history on his play
[1:28:10] here they here
[1:28:11] to be throwing in some frozen water I
[1:28:13] mean really cold water and they would
[1:28:14] freeze to death for tiem if you don't
[1:28:16] denounce your faith in Christ we're
[1:28:18] gonna put you in this cold water well it
[1:28:21] was 40 of them and the 39th guy he said
[1:28:23] that they had water that was I mean cold
[1:28:26] water or they had some like some BAPS
[1:28:29] that they had created say if you
[1:28:31] denounce the faith in Christ you can go
[1:28:33] get into one these baths that's a little
[1:28:35] blood the waters a little warmer right
[1:28:37] and you'll be able to you'll be able to
[1:28:39] kind of handle that but but if you if
[1:28:41] you if you if you don't announcer faith
[1:28:43] you're going to the cold water well this
[1:28:45] one guy jumped up and say well man I
[1:28:47] ain't going in that cold water man I
[1:28:49] mean I can't be faithful unto death I
[1:28:52] can't be they ain't saying I I thought I
[1:28:54] had some faith I thought I believed this
[1:28:56] thing but not a talk about my life right
[1:29:00] so this man fixing I can't do so he
[1:29:02] jumped up and say no I'm gonna leave it
[1:29:04] I'm going to jump in this in this little
[1:29:06] bath y'all going to cold water but I'm
[1:29:07] jumping in the back for the Andrew told
[1:29:09] me to say that the story goes that when
[1:29:12] the man jumped into the bath the man
[1:29:15] died he went into something that was
[1:29:18] comfortable and he died something
[1:29:22] happened to his heart and he died and
[1:29:24] didn't realize that he died right after
[1:29:26] he's and now Cicely the other ones lived
[1:29:32] hey I mean unless died but they had
[1:29:34] captivate but that's when God has to
[1:29:38] denounce in the face right so you know
[1:29:43] all you know when the soul just saw only
[1:29:45] 39 going in the soldiers say I'm taking
[1:29:48] off all my clothes and I'm jumping in
[1:29:50] with these guys and I'm going to die
[1:29:52] right here I'm confessing that I accept
[1:29:55] Christ as my savior I believe him and
[1:29:57] i'ma die right here for and he says 39
[1:30:00] say can't be third and I got to be 40 I
[1:30:02] got to be the 40th one I soldier got
[1:30:04] converted just like that I want you to
[1:30:07] understand that it took faith it took
[1:30:10] faith for those people to do what they
[1:30:12] did in that day but the same faith that
[1:30:15] kept him is the same faith that God is
[1:30:19] giving you to keep you for action
[1:30:23] it's not a different base it's the same
[1:30:25] thing it's his face glory to God I just
[1:30:29] appreciate I appreciate the Lord now
[1:30:31] let's look at another statement here
[1:30:34] from the Prophet Laurie to God amen oh
[1:30:40] Jesus let me uh I wanted to skip down
[1:30:45] here to have something this yeah here it
[1:30:49] is in Moses and man this message Moses
[1:30:54] Oh glory to God look at this it says now
[1:30:58] the only thing that is for you is to
[1:31:01] stimulate things to stimulate faith of
[1:31:05] the people that they might see God's
[1:31:06] willingness to heal the people now as
[1:31:09] far as it comes to healing it's your
[1:31:11] faith in God
[1:31:13] let me just inject this real quick while
[1:31:17] we were there
[1:31:18] amen and it just blessed my heart while
[1:31:21] I was out there in Tucson I was at a
[1:31:23] ministers meeting and a brother was
[1:31:26] sitting down across from me and he he
[1:31:29] began to share a couple testimonies and
[1:31:32] one of his testimonies that he shared he
[1:31:36] said how he had developed cancer behind
[1:31:41] his eye he had cancer right behind his
[1:31:44] eye young man probably in his 40s and so
[1:31:49] he was there you know and kind of Dilla
[1:31:51] Winston and was growing it was growing
[1:31:52] it was growing and and everybody's kind
[1:31:56] of looking certain about you know what
[1:31:57] he gotta do any like well I really don't
[1:31:59] know what imma do you know I just don't
[1:32:01] know and he didn't really tell too many
[1:32:03] people about what he was going through
[1:32:04] you know but but one night you know I
[1:32:07] mean I think he had finally gone to the
[1:32:10] doctor begin to give him some medication
[1:32:12] he would take to try to help this thing
[1:32:14] shrink and and one night you know he was
[1:32:17] there at the church and and because he
[1:32:19] hadn't told anybody he was just he was
[1:32:21] there and he was the interpreter for the
[1:32:24] sermon that night he was interpreting in
[1:32:26] Spanish and and as you know the brother
[1:32:30] was preaching brother Caleb was actually
[1:32:31] preaching just begin to preach and and
[1:32:33] he was just saying this and stand and
[1:32:35] and then in the middle of the sermon and
[1:32:38] they say just stop to say just start
[1:32:40] saying and right now if you believe it
[1:32:43] God God is healing you of this and God
[1:32:45] is healing you of that and God is
[1:32:47] telling you this and God is doing that
[1:32:48] and the brother is hearing brother Caleb
[1:32:50] and he kept you know repeating
[1:32:52] interpreting what was being saying but
[1:32:54] in the middle of his interpreter
[1:32:56] interpreting he heard a voice say and
[1:32:59] God just healed you of your your cancer
[1:33:03] behind your eye and say you heard a
[1:33:05] voice but he said like I didn't hear
[1:33:06] brother Caleb see that he said but I
[1:33:09] know I just heard a voice say that but I
[1:33:11] didn't hear brother Caleb see that so
[1:33:13] now he's processing all this within
[1:33:15] milliseconds so brother Caleb stopped
[1:33:20] and he looked at the brother saying I
[1:33:22] just heard a voice thank God just healed
[1:33:23] you of the cancer that you had in the
[1:33:30] brother say I heard the same voice a
[1:33:33] cancer gone behind his eye he said I
[1:33:35] just heard the same wolf and you didn't
[1:33:37] say it it was God that said it and there
[1:33:40] was two or three people sitting in the
[1:33:41] audience and as they were in the auditor
[1:33:45] for the whole church got to be on
[1:33:46] another level not just the people in the
[1:33:47] pulpit but even it's even the church two
[1:33:50] or three people the audience say when

[1:35:25] our pain Oh hallelujah Church I told her
[1:35:31] brother I thank you for sharing that
[1:35:33] with me I needed to hear because I know
[1:35:36] my God is a healer hurry up but that was
[1:35:42] a lie above my God is a healer glory to
[1:35:50] God amen so we need testimonies like
[1:35:55] that the stimuli pain see see if we
[1:36:02] can't believe God can bring here and how
[1:36:04] are we gonna leave for a tenth of a body
[1:36:07] all right we need that antibiotic or
[1:36:13] through anything you believe God last
[1:36:16] night brother brother Brent brother
[1:36:17] being preached the wonderful message you
[1:36:20] know he talked about wins and losses
[1:36:22] right and in our Christian walk there
[1:36:25] are some wins and losses amen in some
[1:36:28] wins and losses we all go through things
[1:36:30] like that but it does not negate the
[1:36:31] fact that our God is still God the
[1:36:36] doctor don't lose his license when his
[1:36:38] patient dies and God not gonna lose so
[1:36:41] credibility he still of saying yesterday
[1:36:46] today and forever
[1:36:49] glory to God
[1:36:57] he said another testimony with me
[1:37:02] it's brother had a gun somehow the
[1:37:11] brothers son got ahold of the gun gun
[1:37:15] went off did some damage to this little
[1:37:18] baby's body and it was so bad that the
[1:37:24] doctors came in and say look if we
[1:37:26] operate on him you know what what he we
[1:37:31] don't know how he's going to respond to
[1:37:33] the operation we just really don't give
[1:37:34] much hope to this at all they said if we
[1:37:37] say say the way that the the damage in
[1:37:40] his leg and everything that has happened
[1:37:42] it's just you know y'all can just forget
[1:37:44] about it this he will not have a normal
[1:37:46] life after this so the brothers say you
[1:37:50] were wow you know this is really
[1:37:51] something and his brother had been in a
[1:37:53] backslidden condition and they just
[1:37:56] begin to you know just he just began to
[1:37:58] think and pray on it and and so he's
[1:38:01] like lord I you know we just don't know
[1:38:03] what what what we're gonna do here and I
[1:38:06] don't know how to approach this and god
[1:38:07] we just don't know you know so he said
[1:38:10] he said while he was there praying
[1:38:11] inside the chapel at the hospital say
[1:38:14] the voice of the Lord told him to stand
[1:38:16] up and speak to the situation that's
[1:38:20] what he did he stood up and he said was
[1:38:22] in there by stuff he stood up in you're
[1:38:24] spoken now after he's spoken he began to
[1:38:27] rejoice he began to praise God for what
[1:38:33] he had already spoken
[1:38:37] see that that's what that does fake
[1:38:41] calls things that food I've no they
[1:38:44] already work he began to rejoice and say
[1:38:50] some lady walked into the room and he
[1:38:53] just kept praising God while she was
[1:38:55] dancing say he's who she probably sat by
[1:38:57] whatever he was giving God praise for
[1:39:00] what God just spoke to him now he was
[1:39:01] the only one heard that his family had
[1:39:03] not heard that he was all alone heard it
[1:39:07] but he was operating with what God
[1:39:10] revealed to him because faith is a
[1:39:13] revelation as you begin to operate like
[1:39:22] that and just begin to you know worship
[1:39:24] he walked back into the room to look
[1:39:25] he's a little nephew and he got up to
[1:39:30] the nephew and it looked at the daddy
[1:39:31] daddy saying man they just they don't
[1:39:34] give much hope but he had he had the
[1:39:36] revelation he had the faith on the
[1:39:38] inside that I know what the doctor said
[1:39:41] but I got something here
[1:39:44] so they got up to his look he say he
[1:39:47] said you know the boy weren't able to
[1:39:48] really move he was just really in a bad
[1:39:51] situation so he said you know the debt
[1:39:53] the bullet that done so much damage it
[1:39:55] just just just not not much there so
[1:39:57] here he um yeah he said he got up to the
[1:40:00] board if they did something that he said
[1:40:02] now y'all gonna think I'm crazy for
[1:40:03] doing this he said but I know the little
[1:40:05] boy likes Batman he enjoys watching
[1:40:08] Batman he said so what I did is I went
[1:40:11] to him in my Batman voice and I began to
[1:40:16] ask him say if you can hear me just
[1:40:18] shake your leg and the boy begin to
[1:40:21] shake his leg if you can hear and just
[1:40:24] just do this and do that and the boy
[1:40:25] everything he acts the the boy to do he
[1:40:27] did so after the board did it the boy I
[1:40:32] mean the brothers faith even increased a
[1:40:33] little bit more like I know God spoke to
[1:40:35] me this thing on BR I know what the
[1:40:36] doctor said but it's gonna be all right
[1:40:38] and then he turned to the poverty it's
[1:40:42] gonna be okay God just told me it's
[1:40:44] going to be okay it's gonna be alright
[1:40:45] and he walked or not the room well few
[1:40:48] weeks went by that same boy that the
[1:40:50] doctor said
[1:40:51] wouldn't be this and wouldn't be that
[1:40:53] that boy was up being everything they
[1:40:54] said he wouldn't be and and as a as a
[1:41:03] you know a finalization to the testimony
[1:41:06] they took the board that the daddy took
[1:41:08] the board Bhavana present for the doctor
[1:41:09] that performed just a little mine
[1:41:11] operation on and he took them bottom and
[1:41:13] president and the board ran up to the
[1:41:15] doctor and gave the doctor the president
[1:41:17] say that the doctor just dropped it just
[1:41:19] dropped in and just like I can't believe
[1:41:21] it's they these types of things don't
[1:41:23] happen it was a miracle all because of
[1:41:31] somebody's face I'm talking about things
[1:41:34] that's happening now
[1:41:36] not just reading quotes from 40 years
[1:41:39] ago but things that are happening right
[1:41:41] now
[1:41:42] that's the stimulate thing so the trials
[1:41:46] that you're going through right now
[1:41:48] artists in early fight and you may not
[1:41:52] realize about that pastéis becoming
[1:41:55] watching pain I'm talking to a woman
[1:42:01] she's sitting in the balcony she don't
[1:42:03] realize she already got the faith
[1:42:07] hallelujah because the devil always try
[1:42:11] to put it out so far but it's in you
[1:42:14] right now well that's not the end of it
[1:42:20] that daddy had a gun that his son got
[1:42:27] ahold of daddy got to face some charges
[1:42:30] now daddy was looking at about 10 to 15
[1:42:35] years because of this accident so the
[1:42:40] brother began to praise like like I
[1:42:42] believe in the law he told his brother I
[1:42:45] believe in the law I believe they they
[1:42:47] wrote laws for a purpose and and they
[1:42:49] got things set up and the law is the law
[1:42:51] I believe in I support it but we still
[1:42:55] don't pray they see you know we don't
[1:42:59] want to tell people you did the crime
[1:43:00] you have to do time
[1:43:04] but God can give you some mercy but you
[1:43:08] need to accept what you did so he told
[1:43:14] his brother Smith a I'm just we just
[1:43:15] don't pray we don't know what not going
[1:43:16] to do so the brothers in this
[1:43:18] backslidden state and i think he came to
[1:43:20] church before he went to court and they
[1:43:23] kind of prayed over some things you know
[1:43:25] and and and God just began to do with
[1:43:28] his heart a little bit like we were just
[1:43:28] going to lead us in God's hands so they
[1:43:31] prayed and the brothers prayers like
[1:43:32] lord I believe in the law I believe that
[1:43:34] the things that they put in place that's
[1:43:36] exactly right Lord I accept that it's a
[1:43:39] lord and if you're going to allow my
[1:43:40] brother to go to jail in order to touch
[1:43:42] his heart then God let your will be done
[1:43:44] let your will be done God and he had
[1:43:50] pieces he had peace with that type of
[1:43:54] prayer he say but also God if it's your
[1:43:59] will for him to be touched on the high
[1:44:01] side of the tail then touch him God on
[1:44:06] the ipod of the tail well brother went
[1:44:13] to court judge pass the sentence so
[1:44:18] we're going to give you six months
[1:44:19] probation
[1:44:20] went from a ten year sentence to
[1:44:23] six-month probation and when if you get
[1:44:25] through this probation we gonna drop all
[1:44:27] the charges but but but but the thing
[1:44:36] that I like about it that God began to
[1:44:38] touch this man heart and he actually
[1:44:40] wanted to serve God from what he went
[1:44:42] through I need you to get that one I
[1:44:46] need you to really get that one now
[1:44:49] sometimes folks go through something
[1:44:51] hearts still don't change towards God
[1:44:53] so why would God do something if your
[1:44:56] heart not on things it is not God doing
[1:45:02] something for you it's what God's doing
[1:45:03] to you you gotta have a heart to want to
[1:45:09] tell them you don't do things just to do
[1:45:13] things amen when this brother shared
[1:45:17] this thing with
[1:45:18] me and told me what I said brother I
[1:45:20] needed to hear that had to go all the
[1:45:22] way to Tucson to get it but God knew I
[1:45:25] needed because that would stimulate my
[1:45:28] fame look at this in the message Moses
[1:45:35] now the only thing that is for you is to
[1:45:38] stimulate to stimulate the faith of the
[1:45:40] people that they might see God's
[1:45:42] willingness to heal the people now as
[1:45:46] far as it comes to healing it's your
[1:45:48] faith in God your pastor can anoint you
[1:45:51] with oil at your own church and you have
[1:45:54] faith in God it will bring the same
[1:45:55] results that's right
[1:45:57] Gazza healer no man's a healer God's a
[1:46:00] healer these gifts are only to show what
[1:46:03] God's attitude towards the people to get
[1:46:06] you people back to believe in God
[1:46:10] because if you haven't got faith enough
[1:46:13] to believe for your sick body how are
[1:46:17] you going to have faith enough for the
[1:46:18] rapture

[1:54:09] string but to a mountain o church when
[1:54:16] we get this the devil going to be in
[1:54:19] trouble if Jesus a whosoever say to the
[1:54:22] mountain be thou removed in our
[1:54:24] constituency and shall not doubt in his
[1:54:27] heart
[1:54:29] Amen but shall believe that those things
[1:54:31] which he said shall come to pass
[1:54:33] who shall have whatsoever he saith he
[1:54:39] put it right back on mark 11:23 say
[1:54:43] jesus said that sew sew sew sew sew your
[1:54:45] faith actually has to be able to do
[1:54:47] things like that if you really got it
[1:54:50] now I want you to understand because you
[1:54:53] don't when we look at things like this
[1:54:55] this type of faith is controlled by your
[1:54:59] motives and your objective oh my god
[1:55:04] now there's a lot of folk out there got
[1:55:06] all I mean they do in this case brother
[1:55:08] Branham one time went to the witch
[1:55:09] doctors and they they showed they had
[1:55:11] faith they had a table that they just
[1:55:13] picked up and just had the thing twirls
[1:55:16] all around in the room and challenged
[1:55:18] people to knock the table down nobody in
[1:55:20] the room could bring the table down
[1:55:21] brother Branham got up to leave the room
[1:55:24] and they say hey hey you're preachers
[1:55:25] yeah yeah I'm a preacher's so what you
[1:55:27] think about who say this is of the devil
[1:55:29] say uh why you say that you if you use
[1:55:32] so bad not to take knock it down say I
[1:55:34] ain't bad I can't ain't got no power to
[1:55:36] get it down see what Jesus can bring it
[1:55:38] down so you so bad you see say well I
[1:55:42] tell you what y'all challenging me I'm a
[1:55:43] challenge y'all see motive and objective
[1:55:46] he was leaving he was just gonna get out
[1:55:50] of it he wasn't he wasn't standing up
[1:55:52] trying to say well you know y'all praise
[1:55:54] God I'm a prophet I like none of that
[1:55:56] motive and objective you don't go around
[1:55:59] talk about you the bride they know
[1:56:00] you're the bride
[1:56:01] you got to know when to use it so we're
[1:56:03] not to use it so as they challenge him
[1:56:09] he say say in the name of the high
[1:56:11] Holies tell me if this is right say
[1:56:14] nothing at didn't speak he said in the
[1:56:16] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:56:18] tell me if this is right say nothing
[1:56:21] after meeting speed set in the name of
[1:56:24] the Lord Jesus Christ tell me if this is
[1:56:27] right say the table fell down by itself
[1:56:30] all four legs broke and then which is an
[1:56:32] essay no this ain't right this ain't
[1:56:34] right the power was in the name of the
[1:56:37] Lord Jesus quite but he had faith faith
[1:56:45] to walk into the situation like that and
[1:56:47] knew that God was going to be VP with
[1:56:49] them you know when you when you believe
[1:56:51] that mean you got trust you got
[1:56:54] competence that what God said cannot
[1:56:57] fail
[1:56:58] Oh hallelujah you got confidence in what
[1:57:01] God speaks to you you got confidence in
[1:57:04] in a vision do that positives in the
[1:57:06] tree you got confidence in the Word of
[1:57:09] God if God bet that settles it that's
[1:57:15] where your fake the doctor come to ou
[1:57:19] know if God say I'm a captain I'm a
[1:57:21] captain I'm not looking at one of my
[1:57:23] mistakes not you can't get me to focus
[1:57:25] on a mistake I'll focus it on God's
[1:57:28] promise for me that's a Amen dish we got
[1:57:34] everything else and only look at what
[1:57:36] God says that's what Abraham did
[1:57:39] I'm not even considering how old I am
[1:57:42] I'm not considering that this has ever
[1:57:45] happened before I'm not considering any
[1:57:47] of that God promised me I might have a
[1:57:50] son and I'm gonna have me a son Sarah
[1:57:54] get ready we're gonna have a boy same
[1:57:59] God spoke to the prophet and told him he
[1:58:01] was going to have a Joseph but everybody
[1:58:04] criticizing saying maybe you met
[1:58:05] Josephine when his daughter was born see
[1:58:08] when you got faith you don't let no body
[1:58:12] no matter what happens no matter what
[1:58:15] comes up what comes what goes you don't
[1:58:17] let none of that dictate your faith see
[1:58:21] rapture and faith gonna be the same
[1:58:24] nothing on dictators no this happened
[1:58:26] that happened I still got faith I might
[1:58:30] have some Winslet's of losses
[1:58:31] but like like the brothers say we might
[1:58:33] lose some battles but we're not going to
[1:58:36] lose the war see the private saying he's
[1:58:42] saying say he represents that faith by
[1:58:46] divine gift he represents that faith
[1:58:48] that's why you want to hear what he's
[1:58:50] saying
[1:58:51] so when he's sharing this is the story
[1:58:53] you know with this young lady by how he
[1:58:55] took the string and stops and I don't
[1:58:57] look at me just look at the string
[1:58:58] string with hanging and stop when it
[1:59:01] stops you say now you got to show me
[1:59:03] that in the Bible he took a right to
[1:59:04] Maki Lennon so you see that that that
[1:59:07] that same scripture Mark E Levin
[1:59:10] produced squirrels when brother Branham
[1:59:14] was out there hunting it and God
[1:59:16] actually said now what she's hunting for
[1:59:17] squirrels so how many won't three he
[1:59:20] said do you believe mark 11:23 God asked
[1:59:23] him do you believe that
[1:59:25] so yeah oh I believe it well you know
[1:59:27] we'll go ahead and speak to the squirrel
[1:59:28] I mean say what you want the square and
[1:59:30] as he starts speaking squirrels and
[1:59:31] everything the scores coming from out
[1:59:32] eternity when God was using the property
[1:59:36] shadows things that was to stimulate
[1:59:40] that's not just a good story but that's
[1:59:43] the stimulate something inside of you
[1:59:46] we're in the stimulation should bring it
[1:59:48] to a poem you say that is for me that's
[1:59:54] not just a story from the top of the
[1:59:55] dance for me that that face that that he
[1:59:59] represents that faith that faith produce
[2:00:02] swirls that that faith raised the dead
[2:00:06] that faith a man spoke before the
[2:00:11] doctors hand touches my wife's body
[2:00:13] she'll be healed of that tumor that that
[2:00:17] faith did those type of things he wasn't
[2:00:19] even there to pray for her but he spoke
[2:00:22] the word only and it produced the
[2:00:24] healing you say when he pretty when he
[2:00:27] spoke to he didn't even call to check on
[2:00:29] his way huh he spoken on the inspiration
[2:00:34] and went on and preach the gospel didn't
[2:00:36] even call to check on his life waited I
[2:00:38] mean can you imagine such control
[2:00:43] Witney here today such control that he
[2:00:46] speaks about the holy spirit say rise to
[2:00:49] your feet speak to the condition he
[2:00:51] speaks it into the atmosphere and he
[2:00:54] goes to church and preaches swimming
[2:00:55] like nothing ever happened
[2:00:58] that's confidence
[2:01:00] that's believing you receive when you
[2:01:02] play I'm not calling to see didn't
[2:01:07] happen yet no it's going to happen
[2:01:08] because it's the same job that said let
[2:01:11] there be light when he spoke it had
[2:01:15] happened brother Branham said it might
[2:01:16] have took billions of years but God
[2:01:18] never God never wondered whether light
[2:01:20] was going to come he started working on
[2:01:22] something else so when you speak it
[2:01:23] release into the atmosphere start
[2:01:25] working on something else
[2:01:26] oh that faiths that before the doctors
[2:01:33] hand touches my wife's body should be
[2:01:35] heel of her tumor that faith calmed a
[2:01:41] Colorado storm that fade said that we
[2:01:48] could we had enough power to create
[2:01:50] another world and go live on it that
[2:01:54] faith told us that I'm a redistricting
[2:02:02] go give me faith is the substance that
[2:02:06] faith release certain things to is
[2:02:09] searching and as we begin to fellowship
[2:02:12] around this this is what stimulates and
[2:02:15] brings us to a place where we know that
[2:02:17] we'll be changed in a moment in the
[2:02:19] twinkling of an eye the church has lost
[2:02:22] that faith the church don't even believe
[2:02:25] in a rapture anymore because they lost
[2:02:28] the faith but God God's God's gonna
[2:02:31] profit net profit represented V faith
[2:02:33] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:02:35] and we fighting to keep that face look
[2:02:39] at listen at this story hear this
[2:02:40] testimony faith is the substance says
[2:02:42] all right now you see faith is if
[2:02:46] something now look friends I know that
[2:02:49] all of you are at least know this this
[2:02:51] body is controlled by five senses please
[2:02:54] stay with me on this
[2:02:55] this body is controlled by five senses
[2:02:57] is that right all right it's got five
[2:02:59] senses is everything that controls this
[2:03:02] human body now listen real close and
[2:03:04] give me your attention now the the fence
[2:03:07] five senses is this right see taste
[2:03:09] feels smell here is that right then five
[2:03:12] senses control the entire human body is
[2:03:15] that true see taste feel smell and hear
[2:03:17] now there's none of them that declare
[2:03:21] faith faith is the sixth sense no to
[2:03:27] some people as you want to as mental
[2:03:30] telepathy or whatever you want you want
[2:03:32] a wish to call it many of them call it
[2:03:34] names but to me it's faith my god that's
[2:03:41] why people could go to Beatles concerts
[2:03:43] and get healed it was their faith that
[2:03:45] was doing it faith is powerful y'all
[2:03:48] it's powerful we if we don't use it we
[2:03:52] don't really use it now I'm not saying
[2:03:54] when you leave here go try to move all
[2:03:55] the strings that you see don't go out
[2:03:58] but but but when motive and objective
[2:04:00] the reason brother Bradley move that
[2:04:02] string because he had to prove to that
[2:04:03] girl - even half faith
[2:04:05] that was that was a motive and objective
[2:04:07] behind it oh my like you might find
[2:04:10] yourself in a hospital room one day and
[2:04:12] you might see a string Haman and all of
[2:04:14] a sudden that that did this call to come
[2:04:16] back to your mind and not just a quote
[2:04:18] but the scripture mark 11:23 goes with
[2:04:21] the quote and when that's quickened to
[2:04:23] you King you begin to begin to work with
[2:04:26] something but wait on that oh lord have
[2:04:29] mercy
[2:04:29] Oh God let me let me just hold on there
[2:04:34] hold on for a second while we were there
[2:04:36] and in Tucson for the digs took the
[2:04:40] liberty to preach on me and he he was
[2:04:50] sharing a testimony and see these things
[2:04:52] happen Church and sometimes you forget
[2:04:53] what God do for you and you have to be
[2:04:56] reminded we were on our way to London
[2:05:00] for the first time we got to the airport
[2:05:04] just a little bit too late we got that
[2:05:07] thing 30 minutes before the plane was
[2:05:08] going to go in
[2:05:09] and because we thought it was national
[2:05:11] before it became internationally we were
[2:05:13] going to Detroit before we went to
[2:05:15] London so right well we don't have to be
[2:05:16] hit on three hours ahead of time we got
[2:05:18] there about thirty minutes ahead of time
[2:05:19] I believe mom and sister Brown were
[2:05:21] already on the plane playing with
[2:05:24] loading ups they were we at the gate you
[2:05:25] know we at the front desk trying to get
[2:05:27] our luggage down there so we can go to
[2:05:29] the gate and the latest that no you

[2:05:42] ain't got that kind of money to be
[2:05:43] rebook nothing we got to get on this
[2:05:45] plane so we just begin to just work with
[2:05:50] them and talk to them that ladies didn't
[2:05:52] know y'all and getting on this plane
[2:05:54] they shut everything down shut the
[2:05:57] system down and mom and sister Brown

[2:06:07] set there and and my wife was talking to
[2:06:10] the people and trying to get some things
[2:06:11] and I said you know I just kind of
[2:06:13] pulled back and got quiet before the
[2:06:14] Lord I got quiet before the Lord and I
[2:06:16] got quiet before the Lord I heard the
[2:06:18] voice of the Lord tell me
[2:06:19] see sometimes when you're waiting on God
[2:06:21] you can't be all in disarray yourself
[2:06:25] and you can't be on you don't just just
[2:06:29] so so worked up that you came here the
[2:06:32] spirit of time you got to settle

[2:15:21] remind you then you gotta let it out you
[2:15:23] gotta speak it into the atmosphere so I
[2:15:29] got quiet for Laura I said the same God
[2:15:32] that kept that plane on the ground
[2:15:35] because brother Brandon Matthew pray for
[2:15:37] me went running back to the loot the
[2:15:39] play like I noticed play none left me I
[2:15:41] know it done left me
[2:15:42] they say he got all the way to the
[2:15:44] airport and he her last call for
[2:15:48] Louisville Kentucky God held the plane
[2:15:51] up until the prayer not only was pre
[2:15:54] until the prayer was answered God
[2:16:04] holding some things up until the answer
[2:16:06] comes the Holy Spirit says same God that
[2:16:13] held that plane to Memphis Tennessee can
[2:16:15] do the same thing to you so I say okay
[2:16:16] Lord I'm taking you at your word and I
[2:16:18] spoke out of my mouth
[2:16:19] that's not nothing loud and boisterous
[2:16:21] and I everybody in the airport I'm a son
[2:16:29] of God and I got something to say that's
[2:16:33] that's not that's not how you do it
[2:16:34] that's the wrong motive and the wrong
[2:16:36] objective oh come on y'all I feel like
[2:16:40] I'm preaching anyway I just feel like
[2:16:42] I'm preaching but but it's the same type
[2:16:49] of confidence in prayer that Jesus had
[2:16:52] when they looked at a tree and saw no
[2:16:54] fruit on it and they say no man eat no
[2:16:57] more from you anymore anymore that
[2:16:59] that's it that's it it's the last this
[2:17:01] is it
[2:17:01] and he just spoken in the disciples a
[2:17:03] line he they just didn't pay no
[2:17:05] attention to it like why would he say
[2:17:06] that to a tree the next day they come
[2:17:08] back and saw that tree all shriveled up
[2:17:11] it had died at the roots and I'm telling
[2:17:14] your situation is changing in the roots
[2:17:16] oh my so at you know when they trusted
[2:17:24] Jesus the tree that you spoke to yes
[2:17:26] they look at this they say no if you
[2:17:28] have faith and you would only believe
[2:17:30] you can say to the mountain be thou
[2:17:32] removed I can see dull down the heart
[2:17:33] you can have it it's not for me that's
[2:17:36] for you I did that to stimulate your
[2:17:39] faith Peter was there Peter have a space
[2:17:44] stimulated and when it comes time for
[2:17:46] Jesus to leave the stand and Peter was
[2:17:48] going to church that man was sitting at
[2:17:49] the gate called beautiful Peter Som
[2:17:51] Peter and John walking it and I don't
[2:17:52] know how many times they walk by the
[2:17:54] same man but all of a sudden this dais
[2:17:56] something just rose up me now it was the
[2:18:00] faith of Jesus not only was that faith
[2:18:02] in of Jesus inside Peter and John but
[2:18:04] that same faith jump inside that man and
[2:18:07] calls him to believe the word that man's
[2:18:10] faith did not get him up go back and
[2:18:12] listen to the church age but brother
[2:18:13] Branham said it was Jesus faith in that
[2:18:16] man
[2:18:17] that got that man and I'm telling us
[2:18:19] Jesus faith enough this come take us
[2:18:20] into a rapture feet in John 6 live and
[2:18:26] go have our number such as I have I give
[2:18:29] unto the rise up and walk in the name of
[2:18:31] Jesus for them to say such words they
[2:18:35] had to have something on the inside come
[2:18:39] on church but I heard the Holy Spirit
[2:18:42] say the same God that held that plane
[2:18:44] down
[2:18:44] see that's not just a testing one that's
[2:18:45] full to be way back you know fifty years
[2:18:47] ago the same God that held that plane
[2:18:49] down is the same God is able to hold
[2:18:50] this plane down I released it out of my
[2:18:54] mouth I say the same God that held that
[2:18:56] plane down in Memphis Tennessee the same
[2:18:58] God is going to hold this plane down
[2:19:00] here for me five minutes go by plane
[2:19:04] still there ten minutes go by plane
[2:19:07] still there 20 minutes go by plane still
[2:19:11] there and they start getting telephone
[2:19:13] calls up at the front desk well we can't
[2:19:16] get the plane out we can't get the plane
[2:19:17] out into what y'all can't get the plane
[2:19:19] out so we don't know what's going on we
[2:19:21] can't get it out and then they came up
[2:19:23] with a little plan they didn't want to
[2:19:26] tell the people that they get ready take
[2:19:27] this flight overseas and they got a some
[2:19:31] mechanical issues on the plane they they
[2:19:33] don't want to confess that so what they
[2:19:36] decided to do they decide to announce we
[2:19:41] got some international passengers that
[2:19:43] need to get on this flight and if y'all
[2:19:45] Jeff gives them a little minute we'll
[2:19:46] get them all along and then they called
[2:19:48] my family over to say come on come on
[2:19:50] come on we want to get y'all on the
[2:19:51] place and oh my mother my cousin all
[2:19:53] know y'all even get me oh like that
[2:20:00] my motives and my ejected was right so I
[2:20:03] got to go over here to England I'm
[2:20:05] invited to preach it I'm going over
[2:20:07] there to preach so whatever you got to
[2:20:08] do to get me on that plane I'll take it
[2:20:10] and we got on and and our luggage got
[2:20:13] all mixed up and messed up but we made
[2:20:14] it to England and we come on the plane
[2:20:17] everybody looking but didn't know we had
[2:20:22] two witnesses already sitting in the
[2:20:26] plane that knew what was going on
[2:20:31] God strategically plates everybody and
[2:20:35] when we sat down guess what the planes
[2:20:38] are backing out here is the same God
[2:20:48] [Applause]
[2:20:55] look at this since uh whatever you wish
[2:21:04] to call the faith is the six things not
[2:21:06] known to some people as you want to as
[2:21:08] mental to left telepathy whatever you
[2:21:10] want to whatever you want to wish the
[2:21:12] call that many of them call it names but
[2:21:14] to me it's fact
[2:21:16] and that is in and above all five senses
[2:21:19] of the human body you see what I mean
[2:21:21] faith is the only direct and positive
[2:21:24] sense it's the sixth sense faith is more
[2:21:30] than sight faith is more than feeling
[2:21:37] you do not feel faith you don't taste
[2:21:43] faith you don't smell save but you got
[2:21:50] it it might not realize you have it you
[2:21:53] don't see faith faith is the substance
[2:21:57] of things hoped for the evidence of
[2:22:00] things not seen
[2:22:02] so when you can see it by faith then you
[2:22:05] start operating based on what you see
[2:22:09] here see this Bible now I
[2:22:12] I want that Bible so you remember bream
[2:22:14] say I represent that faith now watch
[2:22:15] what he says here in the statement says
[2:22:17] that I want that Bible now I'm looking
[2:22:19] at it now I want it faith is the
[2:22:21] substance of things hoped for the
[2:22:22] evidence of things I do not see see see
[2:22:25] what I mean here in my pocket I think
[2:22:29] those are key words I think there's an
[2:22:34] old Barlow knife I've carried for years
[2:22:37] now I do not see that nice I do not feel
[2:22:43] that nice
[2:22:44] I do not taste that knife I do not smell
[2:22:50] that knife but I know that knife is in
[2:22:54] there how do you know because I believe
[2:22:58] it's in there now if it's not I believe
[2:23:06] it's in there but if it's not I want you
[2:23:13] to understand this that if it's not in
[2:23:15] there faith not dealing not emotions not
[2:23:22] good thoughts but hey we'll put it in
[2:23:30] there
[2:23:32] [Music]
[2:23:33] if it's not in their faith we'll put it
[2:23:36] in there nobody say that jokes you see
[2:23:41] this is why I felt that's what I say he
[2:23:43] represented that faith I'm sorry I heard
[2:23:47] everything Billy Graham said but I don't
[2:23:49] think he was preaching like this I just
[2:23:51] read all Roberts book he wasn't talking
[2:23:53] like this this is another level of faith
[2:23:56] so you know there's different levels of
[2:23:58] love I got a quote on that you got God's
[2:24:02] love and and then then you got the love
[2:24:05] that a man would have for his wife right
[2:24:07] then you got the love that a man think
[2:24:09] you have for another woman that's not
[2:24:10] his wife is not love it's love and then
[2:24:16] brother branham keep brain say that
[2:24:18] didn't say get so filthy til the man
[2:24:20] start loving another man that's filth
[2:24:25] that's not love
[2:24:26] oh but he just love him no he don't love
[2:24:30] him he don't love him and she don't love
[2:24:36] her not like that that a love that is
[2:24:41] spelt said also a call came off of the
[2:24:46] great degree of God who God is love it
[2:24:51] all flows down from man he said Schaffer
[2:24:55] that there's a spirit of honesty in
[2:24:59] saying they say say say you know you get
[2:25:01] a person that's very honest and man like
[2:25:03] anything God so you can depend on
[2:25:05] because God is honest he don't lie God
[2:25:08] is not a man that he should lie he's
[2:25:10] honest
[2:25:11] so but then that thing just start
[2:25:13] working out you get a man you know he
[2:25:15] try to do the best he can but sometime
[2:25:17] he can't come through and then you get a
[2:25:19] guy brother and so you get a guy you
[2:25:21] know that you got to watch everything
[2:25:23] you do around him they say it just keeps
[2:25:27] getting perverted more and more
[2:25:28] perverted same thing happen with our
[2:25:30] faith what we're reading about and
[2:25:32] script to what Jesus spoke down
[2:25:34] scripture what we're reading about these
[2:25:36] people reach a certain level of faith
[2:25:37] and they were honored by by their faith
[2:25:40] that's why the written in Hebrews
[2:25:42] chapter 11 that was just a Hall of Fame
[2:25:44] and if you were to
[2:25:47] we rewrite the Bible going backwards you
[2:25:50] were being there as a group that had
[2:25:51] phase to catch a rapture you look at
[2:25:57] Abraham you think about how to do how
[2:25:58] can the Bible record this man have faith
[2:26:00] we saw all the stuff that this man did
[2:26:04] but God didn't look at that I said I'm
[2:26:07] looking at Abraham's faith and I'm if
[2:26:10] God did look at Abraham's mistakes he
[2:26:12] won't look at mine you know they used to
[2:26:17] have a saying get your eyes off me
[2:26:19] yelling about anybody remember that
[2:26:21] would get your eyes off me don't look at
[2:26:25] me you better look at God look at this
[2:26:33] if it's not in their faith we'll put it
[2:26:37] in there if it's not there that chokes
[2:26:40] you I know but that's true if you
[2:26:43] believe all things are possible you're
[2:26:44] afraid to take God friends you're scared
[2:26:47] now I might I might have left that knife
[2:26:50] laying on the dresser where I changed
[2:26:53] clothes a while ago but just as sure if
[2:26:55] that knife is on the dresser right now
[2:27:00] if I be leave I wish I could underline
[2:27:07] it give it highlighted on the line to
[2:27:11] give it to you put it on the on the move
[2:27:13] your car if you believe if I believe it
[2:27:17] with all my heart it'll be in my pocket
[2:27:22] I mean I left it on the dresser but I
[2:27:26] need it here faith can pick it up off
[2:27:32] the dresser bring it through the
[2:27:35] different realms like a text message
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:44] something as physical as a knife and
[2:27:47] nobody even see it coming through in the
[2:27:57] pocket and it reaches down and he picks
[2:28:00] it up and there it is and I'm talking
[2:28:02] about this all happens within a
[2:28:03] millisecond they says I've needed in the
[2:28:08] name of Jesus bring me my knife and the
[2:28:12] knife just gets up thank God for my
[2:28:18] knife I'm not talking about a new knife
[2:28:22] I'm not talking about going to college
[2:28:24] Emeril and pine a new tonight I'm talk
[2:28:27] about the knife I've been carrying for
[2:28:29] years faith brings it say does that
[2:28:43] remember sister Tina had a situation
[2:28:47] when she was looking for a jump drive
[2:28:49] she was in school she needed that jump
[2:28:51] drive it had all the date on it don't
[2:28:52] tell her to go buy another jump drive
[2:28:55] the new jump drive don't have the data
[2:28:57] on it that I need my face say I need my
[2:29:01] jump drive Lord I don't know where it's
[2:29:04] at but I need my god you know where it's
[2:29:09] Hannah
[2:29:11] she's just fat Dipper in and just pray
[2:29:14] it had the weight had to wait had to
[2:29:15] wait within a couple of days she said
[2:29:17] she was just sleeping in her room woke
[2:29:19] up and the jump drive was right on top
[2:29:21] of her who put it there
[2:29:26] I believe God got angels that's a hot
[2:29:35] son angel she need to jump drive drop it
[2:29:45] see the motive el objective was right
[2:29:50] one time brother wisdom got into a
[2:29:53] situation he was away from his house
[2:29:54] long way away
[2:29:56] and he needed he knew that that he was
[2:30:01] showing on his and his tank and didn't
[2:30:03] know how he was going to get to the gas
[2:30:04] station he spoke by faith and that car
[2:30:08] kept going to the got to the gas station
[2:30:11] brother let's go one time locked his
[2:30:13] keys in the car is back with Ho triple-a
[2:30:16] and all young people you need tripoli
[2:30:19] when you got gone they say he didn't
[2:30:24] know how he was gonna get in the
[2:30:25] costoday was cold in New York he he
[2:30:27] needed to get his family in that car and
[2:30:29] get that getting that kylief Lord ain't
[2:30:31] mean to lock my keys in his car he
[2:30:34] freaked and as he prayed his faith
[2:30:36] unlocked of the locks on the car and he
[2:30:39] got in church I'm sorry if we would
[2:30:47] believe these things say all this
[2:30:50] happened to stimulate to give us rapture
[2:30:52] but we talk about the changing of a body
[2:30:53] and he came to none else at least claim
[2:30:57] his word over your over your sicknesses
[2:31:00] at least at least do that you can't do
[2:31:03] nothing that's by strikes I'm here by
[2:31:05] strike something I'll feel no better but
[2:31:06] by strikes on here there's two things I
[2:31:09] will never confess that I don't feel
[2:31:11] better even though I'm in pain right now
[2:31:15] ain't gonna confess that but I'm a
[2:31:17] confessed by expects I'm here by straps
[2:31:19] I'm here every day I buy especially even
[2:31:22] if I die
[2:31:23] i'ma die on by his stripes I'm healed
[2:31:26] put that on my green maybe somebody that
[2:31:32] is sick will see my grave marker and
[2:31:35] they'll get healed that's the way we got
[2:31:39] a V search face that just just just not
[2:31:42] moved by no matter what happens I'll
[2:31:44] take my wins and I take my loss
[2:31:46] but I'm not going to be moved because
[2:31:48] this faith is producing faith for the
[2:31:51] rapture don't run from the trial run to
[2:31:54] it be like David take his head off if I
[2:31:59] die let me down the battlefield but I
[2:32:01] ain't like like brother being said last
[2:32:03] night he's looking at David just thought
[2:32:04] man maybe this guy you're not gonna go
[2:32:07] man think is you is what everybody go
[2:32:13] David saw either only ones standing
[2:32:15] saying none of y'all gonna go King God
[2:32:19] done did this for me and Gotham did that
[2:32:20] for me I stay the line I stay the bear
[2:32:22] and I this Goliath is just like one of
[2:32:24] them I take them out give me a chance
[2:32:27] well if you can't like they're you to
[2:32:29] you to this and you to that so if you
[2:32:31] gonna go if you gone gone here's my arm
[2:32:36] and I just I just like to ask the
[2:32:38] question oh why you gonna give David
[2:32:40] army that you didn't even trust yourself
[2:32:45] you didn't even have confidence in your
[2:32:47] own mama if you had confidence in it you
[2:32:50] will put it on it you would get out
[2:32:51] there why you gonna give me something
[2:32:54] you ain't got no confidence in saying I
[2:33:00] got this ain't been proven I've been
[2:33:01] tried I can go to battle like this just
[2:33:03] giving my sling and my rock I'm going
[2:33:06] out hit picked up five smooth stones
[2:33:09] just in case you might need five
[2:33:12] scriptures just give them five smooth
[2:33:14] scriptures that you just quote real
[2:33:15] quick if you get yourself a song to that
[2:33:19] you can sing while you're going through
[2:33:22] captain stone Lee said just in case I'm
[2:33:25] you know I see brother branham say that
[2:33:26] those stones represented FAI th and j
[2:33:31] esus they took the stone he just
[2:33:35] slugging it said brother branham said
[2:33:37] god gavin stone made the stone go a
[2:33:39] thousand miles per second a man came
[2:33:42] through that fast but he threw that rock
[2:33:45] thousand miles per second and the way
[2:33:47] the armour was designed it was only one
[2:33:49] place David could hit and he slung it
[2:33:53] hit that man right down his forehead
[2:33:55] brought the life down and when he told
[2:33:58] saying that the day I'm a feet drill
[2:34:00] files today
[2:34:00] you thought I'd feed my body I'm a feet
[2:34:02] Jill I'm a feet Jill Barta to the farms
[2:34:04] of the air didn't have a sort but went
[2:34:06] and took Goliath's sword that's a bad
[2:34:10] man took the lights forward cut his own
[2:34:15] head off with it and held it up and like
[2:34:19] brother dig see why we liked in Tucson

[2:37:28] that's not just something for us to sit
[2:37:29] around just talk about but these are
[2:37:32] things to be manifested in our own lives

[2:37:38] 50 you know 60 years ago that God was
[2:37:40] doing these things with a a man here on
[2:37:43] earth right here in the United States
[2:37:44] that should stimulate something is that
[2:37:46] God you can do the same thing for me if

[2:38:11] speak and once you're in a position
[2:38:14] spiritually where God can anoint you
[2:38:15] then speak it and watch God do what they
