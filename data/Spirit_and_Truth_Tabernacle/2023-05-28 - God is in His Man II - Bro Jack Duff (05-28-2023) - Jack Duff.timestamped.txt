[58:11] I'm gonna just you know be honest some
[58:13] of those songs have meaning
[58:16] there was something you were singing
[58:19] you know you you you you know it just it
[58:22] just it just you know just not just
[58:24] words that you were just repeating but
[58:26] you had to think about what you were
[58:28] saying
[58:29] praise the Lord
[58:31] amen
[58:33] all right all right
[58:35] all right all right I'm gonna have to
[58:38] excuse the musicians y'all please y'all

[58:44] [Laughter]
[58:47] God is good I'm
[58:49] Road Troyer took us to church this
[58:51] morning I tell you I enjoyed that
[58:53] brother Troy praise the Lord
[58:56] amen we we thank God you know I just
[59:01] like the different
[59:03] um gifts that God has placed in the body
[59:06] and everybody just kind of do something
[59:07] a little different
[59:09] and um you know brother Solomon has his
[59:12] way brother Smiley has his way brother
[59:13] Troy have his way I have my way and but
[59:16] it's all just to edify the body
[59:19] and uh so you just never know what
[59:21] you're gonna get when you come to church
[59:22] that's why it's good just to come to
[59:23] church
[59:24] amen praise the Lord all right I ain't
[59:27] gonna ain't gonna bother y'all too much
[59:29] just get your Bibles and turn with me to
[59:31] look for and I just wanted to uh quickly
[59:34] mention that uh brother Mark we really
[59:36] appreciate the word on uh Friday night
[59:40] for the Youth service just did a an
[59:42] excellent job amen uh with a sermon
[59:47] and we thank him for coming to just be
[59:49] with us for this short amount of time
[59:51] and I text him on yes they say brother

[59:55] and uh while I was while he was
[59:57] ministering brother brother brother uh
[59:59] Paul Jean was here to say I'm gonna tell
[1:00:01] my daddy about brother Mark and we're
[1:00:04] gonna see if we can get him you know to
[1:00:05] come to Boynton I say well praise the
[1:00:08] Lord so you never know what doors God
[1:00:11] will open you just be faithful
[1:00:13] amen and like I told y'all on Friday I
[1:00:16] love it when a man's gift make room for
[1:00:19] itself because that's what the Bible
[1:00:20] says supposed to happen I don't like to
[1:00:23] see people trying to uh get into the
[1:00:25] pulpit
[1:00:26] I don't like that uh uh with people
[1:00:29] running you down calling you and trying
[1:00:31] to get into the pulpit don't do that
[1:00:33] don't do that just wait on the Lord amen
[1:00:37] you you might feel like I got something
[1:00:39] I got some just wait on the Lord just
[1:00:41] wait on the Lord and he'll he'll give

[1:02:28] getting started amen and I pray that
[1:02:31] it'll be strength to Sister Sandra amen
[1:02:35] something that I just heard this morning
[1:02:37] and uh I pray to just be strength let's
[1:02:40] read let's read the scripture amen uh
[1:02:43] Luke chapter four we are returning uh to
[1:02:46] our thought before we left uh we thank
[1:02:50] God for taking us and bringing us back
[1:02:52] home safely uh it's good to be back amen
[1:02:55] uh you missed the Mr Saints uh but but
[1:02:59] we certainly enjoyed our our our trip
[1:03:02] there the crews that the Lord allowed us
[1:03:05] to go with our family we just thank God
[1:03:06] for that a wonderful wonderful time and
[1:03:09] and I'll bring a portion of the cruise
[1:03:12] out today amen uh and y'all just it'll
[1:03:16] be fitting through certain sermons here
[1:03:18] and there so y'all just get ready to
[1:03:20] hear anything I got to share you know
[1:03:22] but we thank the Lord for for all things
[1:03:24] uh Luke chapter 4 verse 16 says and he
[1:03:28] came to Nazareth
[1:03:30] where he had been brought up and as his
[1:03:33] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[1:03:36] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[1:03:38] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:03:40] book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:03:43] um uh and when he had opened the book he
[1:03:46] found the place where it was written the
[1:03:49] spirit of the Lord is upon me and he
[1:03:52] hath anointed me uh to preach the gospel
[1:03:56] to the poor he had sent me to heal
[1:03:59] the Brokenhearted to preach Deliverance
[1:04:02] to the captive and recovering of sight
[1:04:05] to the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:04:08] are bruised and I just love the the way
[1:04:11] that the scripture says the recovering
[1:04:13] of sight uh because when when you see
[1:04:16] that recovering uh to recover something
[1:04:20] you had to lose it
[1:04:22] first and then it's recovered so somehow
[1:04:26] a man the gospel must be preached in
[1:04:29] order for those that used to see
[1:04:31] something
[1:04:32] that have lost their sight spiritually
[1:04:37] they used to believe what you believe
[1:04:39] but they lost their sight spiritually
[1:04:41] but Jesus comes with an anointing
[1:04:45] a man to help people recover their sight
[1:04:49] come on somebody amen the Bible says to
[1:04:53] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:04:54] which is the Year of Jubilee uh and he
[1:04:57] closed the book and gave it again to the
[1:05:00] minister and sat down in the eyes of all
[1:05:02] them that were in the synagogue were
[1:05:04] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[1:05:07] them this day is this scripture
[1:05:10] fulfilled in your ears and all bear him
[1:05:14] witness and wandered at the the gracious
[1:05:17] Words which proceeded out of his mouth
[1:05:18] and he said uh and they said
[1:05:21] is not this Joseph's son and he said
[1:05:26] unto them ye will surely say unto me
[1:05:28] this proverb physician heal thyself
[1:05:30] whatsoever We Have Heard done in
[1:05:33] Capernaum do also here in thy country
[1:05:36] and he said verily I said to you no
[1:05:38] Prophet is accepted in his own country
[1:05:41] but I say unto you of a truth many
[1:05:44] widows were in Israel in the days of
[1:05:46] Elias when thou when the heaven was shut
[1:05:49] up three years and six months when Great
[1:05:52] Famine was throughout all the land but
[1:05:54] unto none of them was Elias sent save
[1:05:57] unto serepto a city of Sinai unto a
[1:06:00] woman that was a that was a widow and
[1:06:03] many lepers were in Israel in a time of
[1:06:05] at least elysius the prophet and none of
[1:06:09] them was cleansed saving Naaman the
[1:06:11] Syrian verse 28 says in all they in the
[1:06:16] synagogue when they heard these words
[1:06:18] were filled with wrath amen they got
[1:06:23] upset at the review real word amen
[1:06:27] praise let's bow in a word of prayer

[1:16:34] God in action
[1:16:36] the Bible says he is the same yesterday
[1:16:39] today and forever and so I don't put a
[1:16:42] question on if he is no
[1:16:45] no that's not even part of my vocabulary
[1:16:47] I know he is the same yesterday today

[1:17:41] Israelites I I know he did it
[1:17:44] praise God and now is my time now it's

[1:18:53] amen amen amen brother Branham even told
[1:18:57] us
[1:18:58] amen that that we have to be a part of a
[1:19:01] church
[1:19:02] where uh the supernatural
[1:19:05] is made known to the people
[1:19:09] something they can get a a hold on they
[1:19:11] can grab it and hold on to it the
[1:19:13] supernatural
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:17] Hallelujah so this young man wanted to
[1:19:20] see God
[1:19:22] and he went to his mom and said mama can
[1:19:25] I can I see God
[1:19:28] mama had no answer for him she's like I
[1:19:30] don't know if you can see God or not she
[1:19:32] said why don't you uh go ask your Sunday
[1:19:34] school teacher they they going through
[1:19:36] the scripture with the acts of Sunday
[1:19:37] school teacher so he went to the Sunday
[1:19:39] school teacher and he asked a question I
[1:19:40] mean can you just see him sitting there
[1:19:42] listening at the lesson
[1:19:44] and they just going through the lesson
[1:19:46] at the end he said I got one question
[1:19:47] can I see God I know you're talking
[1:19:50] about him but can I see him
[1:19:53] and uh and the Sunday school teacher
[1:19:55] said I don't know now you probably need
[1:19:56] to ask the pastor that question
[1:19:58] so the pastor amen the boy finally make
[1:20:01] his way to the past and and maybe the
[1:20:03] pastor talking to this person talking to
[1:20:05] that person like what you want Sonny I
[1:20:07] just got one question Pastor can I see
[1:20:10] God
[1:20:11] you've been preaching about him the
[1:20:13] Sunday school teacher talking about him
[1:20:14] Mama make me come to church to hear
[1:20:17] about them but cannot see him
[1:20:21] the pastor tells the little boy said oh
[1:20:24] no man can see God and live
[1:20:27] a little young fellas say oh okay
[1:20:31] all right uh no man can see God and live
[1:20:34] and say all right okay it didn't satisfy
[1:20:37] the longing that was in his heart
[1:20:39] the Bible I mean the Bible says there's
[1:20:41] a deep calling amen then there has to be
[1:20:44] a deep to respond to that crime
[1:20:46] Hallelujah so this boy still had a deep
[1:20:49] in him amen that that wanted to see that
[1:20:51] that question satisfied so he found
[1:20:53] himself in a boat one day
[1:20:55] amen with an old fisherman and inside
[1:20:59] the boat they come up a storm amen and
[1:21:02] an old fish was kind of getting things
[1:21:04] preparing like we gotta we gotta weather
[1:21:06] this storm we gotta get out of here
[1:21:07] somehow you know and I don't want you I
[1:21:10] pretty much I don't want your blood to
[1:21:11] be on my hands son we gotta we gotta
[1:21:13] figure out how to get out of this
[1:21:14] situation so God let the storm pass over
[1:21:18] glory and I believe the Storm Is Passing
[1:21:20] over for some of y'all
[1:21:21] glory to God Amen the storm passed over
[1:21:25] and a big rainbow came out and an old
[1:21:28] fisherman just began to cry and a little
[1:21:30] boy said now why would he cried that
[1:21:32] rainbow like that he the man knew God's
[1:21:35] promises that was in the rainbow that
[1:21:37] God wasn't going to destroy the Earth
[1:21:38] with water again he knew the promises of
[1:21:41] God that was there so he said The Boy
[1:21:43] The Boy got excited he came from the
[1:21:45] back of the boat to the friend of both
[1:21:47] say I asked my mama I asked the Sunday
[1:21:50] school teacher I asked my pastor and
[1:21:53] nobody got an answer for me how he said
[1:21:55] now I want to ask you the question can I
[1:21:58] see come
[1:22:01] the man looked up say son amen
[1:22:05] everywhere I turn I see God
[1:22:07] I see him in the rainbow
[1:22:10] amen I see him even in the storm
[1:22:16] hey I see him in my storm because he's
[1:22:20] the one that's able to calm the storm
[1:22:23] Hallelujah eyes everywhere I turn I see
[1:22:26] God
[1:22:29] I see him in his people I see him in
[1:22:32] nature I see him in the animals come on
[1:22:35] I see God everywhere I turn
[1:22:39] glory to God I see him in his word I see
[1:22:43] him in his son
[1:22:44] I see him in his man
[1:22:46] I see God
[1:22:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:51] so we talked about this amen God was in
[1:22:55] his people and that creative
[1:22:57] characteristic that was in Moses glory
[1:23:01] to God that was not Moses creating uh
[1:23:04] flies and frogs and lice and all that it
[1:23:07] was a creative characteristic of God
[1:23:09] that was dwelling in Moses
[1:23:11] amen also we uh we we looked at God in
[1:23:15] his universe and brother Brandon made
[1:23:16] the statement God is just like the air
[1:23:18] he feels all the universe
[1:23:22] amen we looked at God in nature and we
[1:23:25] talked about that Tola worm
[1:23:28] amen and how the total worm attaches
[1:23:30] itself to a tree and when that when that
[1:23:34] that that that female worm is going to
[1:23:36] get attached to that tree she has one
[1:23:38] purpose that's to give birth
[1:23:40] and she realizes that once she attaches
[1:23:43] there is no getting her out that tree
[1:23:45] amen and she attaches herself she wants
[1:23:47] to give birth and she realizes once she
[1:23:49] does give birth she will also die
[1:23:52] hey hallelujah amen when Christ was
[1:23:55] attached to a tree attached across amen
[1:23:58] he died but he also gave birth to us
[1:24:02] so we see God in nature
[1:24:05] God is in his word God is in his son God
[1:24:08] is in his man let's pick up this thought
[1:24:10] on God is in his word amen for today if
[1:24:13] we can and we'll go as far as we can and
[1:24:16] let the Lord take it from there
[1:24:19] all right this uh statement
[1:24:22] out of the sermon modern events are made
[1:24:24] clear by prophecy
[1:24:26] uh we we want to look at God in his
[1:24:29] words you you you know I don't know if
[1:24:32] you've ever experienced this yourself
[1:24:34] but there's been times Amen in my life
[1:24:38] that I'm going through a particular
[1:24:39] trial
[1:24:41] amen and as I'm going through the trial
[1:24:43] uh sometimes I just don't know where the
[1:24:46] encouragement Gonna Come
[1:24:47] where the strength Gonna Come and there
[1:24:50] are times that I just pick up my Bible
[1:24:53] and and it's not it's not even a whole
[1:24:55] chapter
[1:24:56] sometimes it's just a phrase in the
[1:24:59] verse
[1:25:01] come on somebody it don't even have to
[1:25:03] be the whole verse but just a phrase in
[1:25:06] the verse
[1:25:07] and I would find inspiration from what
[1:25:11] God wrote in his words the one thing I
[1:25:13] know is that God cannot lie
[1:25:18] and I don't I don't I don't take the
[1:25:20] Bible to say this was only to a
[1:25:22] generation in the past if I'm holding it
[1:25:26] I don't care if it was written to the
[1:25:28] the uh the the Israelites amen I don't
[1:25:31] care who what letter Paul might arrest
[1:25:34] to some City amen if it's written if
[1:25:37] it's written to them it's written to me
[1:25:40] so I I make the word of God personal
[1:25:45] amen if he says I'm the Lord that
[1:25:47] healeth all your diseases he was talking
[1:25:50] to me
[1:25:54] it's his word is real
[1:25:57] sometimes the word just magnifies
[1:26:00] that are scripture that you don't read
[1:26:01] for years and all of a sudden you run
[1:26:03] into it in a certain season of your life
[1:26:05] it just means more to you
[1:26:08] God's in his word
[1:26:11] the prophet says this in the message
[1:26:13] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[1:26:15] it says now the events
[1:26:18] that we see taking place
[1:26:21] it's absolutely showed in the Bible of
[1:26:23] every age
[1:26:25] we think we're all out of Cana
[1:26:28] he says but we're not
[1:26:30] everything's moving just exactly with
[1:26:33] God's word
[1:26:34] now the Bible is a different book
[1:26:38] from any other sacred poop
[1:26:41] my there's no book like the Bible
[1:26:45] because the Bible is God
[1:26:48] oh
[1:26:50] the Bible and you want to know why the
[1:26:53] devil fights you from reading your Bible
[1:26:56] because the Bible is God in word form
[1:27:04] see a word is a thought Express
[1:27:06] God's thinking expressed it his words
[1:27:10] through the prophets and they wrote the
[1:27:13] Bible which is in word form and Jesus
[1:27:17] called it a seed
[1:27:19] and any seed will bring forth of his
[1:27:22] kind if it's in the right condition the
[1:27:25] right atmosphere hallelujah amen this
[1:27:28] book of Prophecy is foretelling future
[1:27:30] events now the book contains the entire
[1:27:34] revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add
[1:27:36] to it or take from it and every
[1:27:38] Revelation must come by it see it must
[1:27:41] be the word
[1:27:43] now you know there's a statement
[1:27:45] regarding the Bible not moving amen from
[1:27:48] here to the next quote going to be Dr
[1:27:50] Moses but before I get there amen
[1:27:53] um the the Bible brother man who says no
[1:27:55] book like it no book like it and uh uh
[1:27:59] the one of the things that you find in
[1:28:00] the Bible is unique because it was
[1:28:02] written by over 40 authors
[1:28:06] amen over a 1500 year span
[1:28:11] think about it which is 40 Generations
[1:28:13] 40 over 40 authors through for 40
[1:28:16] Generations on three continents
[1:28:20] the Bible is constructed over three
[1:28:23] continents
[1:28:24] and these continents it was constructed
[1:28:26] in Africa
[1:28:29] the Bible was constructed in Africa
[1:28:32] Hallelujah because the children of
[1:28:34] Israel was down in Egypt oh come on
[1:28:37] somebody amen and they were down in
[1:28:39] Egypt which is a part of Africa writing
[1:28:42] and Moses was there when the children
[1:28:43] leading him to the promised land right
[1:28:45] it was Africa in Asia as well as Europe
[1:28:49] also it was uh comprised in three
[1:28:52] different languages
[1:28:54] they got the Hebrew
[1:28:56] amen the Arabic as well as the Greek and
[1:29:00] we use the Greek Lexicon because this is
[1:29:03] the origination of the scripture these
[1:29:06] languages amen the Bible has been read
[1:29:09] by more people and published in more
[1:29:11] languages than any other book in history
[1:29:15] another thing over a billion copies of
[1:29:17] the Bible have been published the Bible
[1:29:19] has survived persecution and criticism
[1:29:23] over the centuries
[1:29:25] and I just a reminder of uh brother
[1:29:28] Brandon telling a story
[1:29:30] of how
[1:29:31] um you know in the in the Tabernacle
[1:29:33] they had a flood one time
[1:29:35] and uh and when they had this flood amen
[1:29:38] he had his Bible open on the pulpits
[1:29:41] amen and somehow uh when when the flood
[1:29:44] happened I think the pulpit even raised
[1:29:46] but when it came back down the Bible was
[1:29:48] still open God protected his words
[1:29:51] there's other things in the church that
[1:29:53] was destroyed but not the words
[1:29:55] glory to God the word was protected and
[1:29:57] the word is still protected
[1:30:00] here brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:30:02] in the message is Dr Moses
[1:30:04] he says well
[1:30:06] what do you uh what do you do what do
[1:30:10] you now just about two dozen that's
[1:30:12] never been in one of the campaigns
[1:30:13] before we certainly welcome you our
[1:30:15] beloved friends and and love uh and love
[1:30:18] with the Lord Jesus may his Spirit stir
[1:30:20] you tonight in your emotions greatly to
[1:30:24] love him more and more that's the whole
[1:30:25] thing we want you to love God more and
[1:30:27] more so now this is always fundamentally
[1:30:30] the correct word of God the Bible and
[1:30:34] look at what it says every bit of it is
[1:30:36] inspired
[1:30:38] and it's all God's word and God is in
[1:30:42] his word so if God is in his word then
[1:30:45] if you receive the words you receive God
[1:30:48] if you receive the word you receive God
[1:30:51] what about if you reject the word
[1:30:55] you reject God
[1:30:57] plain and simple amen if you receive the
[1:30:59] word you receive God Amen he says uh now
[1:31:03] that is God's plan God's motive God's
[1:31:06] attitude God's love God's salvation
[1:31:08] everything rests in his printed words
[1:31:12] amen and if those words are just like
[1:31:15] greens or seed that you could pick out
[1:31:18] and swallow every one of them would
[1:31:20] produce just exactly what it says it'll
[1:31:22] do here but by faith we receive them
[1:31:26] go on it says this now someone asked me
[1:31:29] some time ago said brother Brandon
[1:31:32] when those Visions come is that part of
[1:31:36] God
[1:31:37] I said that secondarily God
[1:31:41] the vision is secondarily gone right it
[1:31:45] says uh it says it says it's that
[1:31:47] secondarily God's word if that would say
[1:31:49] something that wasn't according to this
[1:31:51] Bible
[1:31:53] then it would be a it would absolutely
[1:31:55] be wrong this and when it's saying this
[1:32:00] he's doing this
[1:32:02] this is first
[1:32:07] Hallelujah the word of God is first
[1:32:10] I don't care what nobody say the word
[1:32:12] must be first
[1:32:14] not nobody's Vision not nobody's dream
[1:32:18] not nobody's experience it's got to be
[1:32:22] the word first
[1:32:24] if division the dream The Experience
[1:32:26] does not line up with the word then
[1:32:28] discredit it
[1:32:30] because it's an evil spirit that's
[1:32:32] trying to take you away from the word
[1:32:34] brother Branham had to get that brother
[1:32:36] straightened out
[1:32:37] he's he's he's want to run the city I
[1:32:40] mean run the country he got a wife at
[1:32:42] home but he got a woman that's running
[1:32:44] with him that's been divorced multiple
[1:32:45] times but she got a lot of money and uh
[1:32:48] and she want to go from City to City uh
[1:32:50] you know with his brother to meetings
[1:32:51] and and just telling the prophet that
[1:32:52] you know we feel led to do this
[1:32:54] and and uh brother random say well you
[1:32:57] feel led to do that say yeah yeah we
[1:32:58] feel that what you think about it say
[1:33:00] don't ask me what I think
[1:33:01] don't ask me what I think well we just
[1:33:04] want to know you don't agree with this
[1:33:05] and they just kept digging kept thinking
[1:33:07] he said no I don't agree with it it's
[1:33:08] completely off the word of God you got a
[1:33:10] wife at home my brother you need to be
[1:33:12] home with your wife not running the
[1:33:14] country with this woman it don't look
[1:33:16] right
[1:33:19] Hallelujah he says it don't look right
[1:33:21] for you to do something like that you
[1:33:23] bring reproach on the gospel
[1:33:27] you see the word got to be first I don't
[1:33:28] care about nobody's dream nobody's
[1:33:30] Vision amen keep it in the word make
[1:33:33] sure that thing line back up with the
[1:33:34] words all right let's keep going see
[1:33:37] that's secondarily God's word if that if
[1:33:39] that would say something that wasn't
[1:33:41] according to this Bible then it would
[1:33:43] absolutely be wrong this is first and
[1:33:46] now this is God he said I'm I'm the Lord
[1:33:49] that healeth thee all the healing comes
[1:33:51] from God he's the one does the healing
[1:33:54] all the Divine promises come from God
[1:33:55] because it's his word to you and to me
[1:33:59] now let's just look at a scripture here
[1:34:01] when he says all the word of God is
[1:34:03] inspired you know because people will
[1:34:05] tell you that well this man that wrote
[1:34:07] the Bible
[1:34:09] and and and and and the truth of the
[1:34:12] matter is it was man that wrote the
[1:34:15] Bible
[1:34:15] that's that's true
[1:34:17] part true
[1:34:22] this man that wrote it but he was
[1:34:24] inspired by God
[1:34:27] right second Timothy 3 16.
[1:34:30] all scripture
[1:34:32] all scripture
[1:34:34] amen is given by inspiration of God
[1:34:39] Glory I like this and it's profitable
[1:34:42] for Doctrine
[1:34:44] for reproof
[1:34:46] for correction
[1:34:48] for instruction in righteousness
[1:34:51] that is what scripture is used for it's
[1:34:53] a man is is profitable of a Doctrine for
[1:34:57] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:34:58] righteous now just keep the scripture
[1:35:00] there for me amen I I went to the
[1:35:03] scripture in the emphatic diagram and
[1:35:05] also say this it says all scripture
[1:35:08] divinely inspired is indeed profitable
[1:35:12] for teaching
[1:35:14] so amen if we gonna teach something we
[1:35:17] got to teach it from the Bible
[1:35:21] glory to God I thought when I first
[1:35:23] started out the ministry I I mentioned
[1:35:25] to the Lord I just had a talk with the
[1:35:27] Lord I said Lord I've heard a lot of
[1:35:29] preachers preach in my day
[1:35:31] and uh and I didn't agree with
[1:35:33] everything they said I saw a lot of
[1:35:36] people say amen I saw the church that's
[1:35:39] on fire but in my spirit I was not
[1:35:41] agreeing with what they were saying I
[1:35:43] say Lord if I came see it in the
[1:35:45] scripture I can't preach it
[1:35:48] I don't care how many people said amen
[1:35:51] if I cannot base that old scripture then
[1:35:54] I came preaching
[1:35:57] glory to God Amen even to this day I
[1:36:01] hear different Brothers might go into
[1:36:02] the message they pull this out and pull
[1:36:04] it out if I can't see that thing flowing
[1:36:06] in the scripture I ain't saying and I
[1:36:08] ain't repeating it I don't care how many
[1:36:10] people say it
[1:36:12] come on search
[1:36:14] glory to God you you want to be a part
[1:36:16] of a church that is standing on the
[1:36:19] words
[1:36:21] see Heaven and Earth have passed away
[1:36:22] but this word gonna be gonna be
[1:36:24] remaining we want to stand on the word
[1:36:26] not an experience
[1:36:29] come on church not an experience not a
[1:36:32] dream not a not a not an emotion we want
[1:36:34] the words
[1:36:35] all right now amen could the devil give
[1:36:38] you all that just to get you off to work
[1:36:41] all right now
[1:36:43] he says oh he says uh emphatic dialogue
[1:36:46] says all scripture Divine Inspire is
[1:36:48] indeed profitable for teaching
[1:36:51] another other thing the scripture is
[1:36:52] used for amen it stands up a profitable
[1:36:55] Doctrine but for reproof you see that
[1:36:57] there well what what that means the word
[1:36:59] of God is profitable amen for conviction
[1:37:06] let me just put it like this if the word
[1:37:09] don't convict you
[1:37:11] you can't be convicted
[1:37:15] the words should get kind of cut you get
[1:37:18] you know make your toes feel a little
[1:37:20] short sometimes
[1:37:22] pull them in them inside your shoes the
[1:37:24] word should do that to you sometimes
[1:37:26] come on somebody's word is not picking
[1:37:28] on you but it's picking off you
[1:37:32] the word should bring conviction you and
[1:37:34] if you if you if you feel conviction you
[1:37:36] ought to thank God for it that means god
[1:37:38] dealing with you
[1:37:40] when you stop feeling conviction you got
[1:37:42] a big problem on your hands
[1:37:46] the words
[1:37:48] amen it says all scripture divinely
[1:37:50] inspires indeed profitable teaching for
[1:37:53] teaching for conviction for correction
[1:37:56] for that for that discipline which is in
[1:37:59] righteousness
[1:38:01] so I like that for when it says
[1:38:03] profitable for Doctrine is instruction
[1:38:04] or learning
[1:38:06] when it says profitable for reproof or
[1:38:08] convictionist it's instructive
[1:38:10] conviction in the ways of God God wants
[1:38:13] you to live according to his words amen
[1:38:15] profitable for correction means
[1:38:17] chastisement and the Bible says that
[1:38:19] whom the Lord loves
[1:38:22] you chase he chastises
[1:38:26] when it's profitable for instruction
[1:38:27] that means discipline amen and what it
[1:38:30] means is it's the whole training and
[1:38:32] education of the children of God and
[1:38:35] this cultivates your your mind and your
[1:38:38] morals
[1:38:40] the word of God should cultivate your
[1:38:42] mind and your morals
[1:38:45] come on somebody the reason the sisters
[1:38:47] dressed the way they dress is because
[1:38:49] the word of God says so
[1:38:52] the reason the brothers dressed the way
[1:38:54] they dressed it because the word of God
[1:38:55] say so come on not just because brother
[1:38:57] Branham said brother Branham only said
[1:38:59] what the Bible said
[1:39:02] hello somebody
[1:39:04] amen we're following because it's what
[1:39:06] the Bible said
[1:39:09] oh come on
[1:39:10] give me Deuteronomy 22. verse 5.
[1:39:16] see it's in the Bible
[1:39:18] and when we found it in the Bible
[1:39:21] we just live it this is what the Bible
[1:39:23] say the woman shall not wear that
[1:39:27] which was pertaineth unto a man neither
[1:39:30] shall a man put on a woman's garments
[1:39:32] for all that do so are an Abomination
[1:39:35] unto the Lord thy God now most people
[1:39:37] say that was for the Old Testament no no
[1:39:39] no you can't say that because in the Old
[1:39:42] Testament they also had thou shall not
[1:39:43] kill thou shall not steal thou shall not
[1:39:47] bear false witness thou shall not Thou
[1:39:49] shalt not they had all the Ten
[1:39:50] Commandments and that was just not for
[1:39:52] the children of Israel that's for us
[1:39:54] right now
[1:39:56] so from Genesis to revelation we believe
[1:39:59] the word
[1:40:02] let's move on here
[1:40:04] let's move on here I want to just show
[1:40:06] you God is always hiding things in his
[1:40:08] words
[1:40:09] when we read the story of Abraham and
[1:40:12] Isaac God was hiding something
[1:40:15] amen when Moses made the statement the
[1:40:18] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[1:40:19] like unto me God was hiding something
[1:40:24] amen when he came to Isaiah and said a
[1:40:27] virgin shall conceive
[1:40:29] God was hiding something
[1:40:32] but when Jesus was born
[1:40:35] and Jesus began to walk the face of the
[1:40:37] Earth he was the Fulfillment of these
[1:40:40] things that God was hiding
[1:40:43] now I want you to catch this now out of
[1:40:46] the pergament church age I want you to
[1:40:47] catch this because God is in his word
[1:40:49] and and and and when God when God God
[1:40:52] God gave his word God gave prophecies
[1:40:54] and thank God was in that God was in it
[1:40:56] all and when when Christ came and
[1:40:58] manifested that prophecy now God is in a
[1:41:01] man the same God that was in his word is
[1:41:05] the same God that is taking on flesh and
[1:41:07] he's in a man
[1:41:08] don't miss God being in the man
[1:41:11] Glory Hallelujah now I want you to catch
[1:41:14] this because one of my favorite quotes I
[1:41:16] like to read out of purging me a church
[1:41:17] age God is in his words if you ever want
[1:41:21] inspiration if you ever want
[1:41:23] encouragement if you ever want strength
[1:41:25] if you ever want correction go back to
[1:41:27] the word of God
[1:41:29] amen let God take care of it you'll find
[1:41:32] him in his word
[1:41:34] amen but here I love the statement I
[1:41:37] wonder
[1:41:39] if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:41:43] with the word
[1:41:45] are we impressed with the words in our
[1:41:47] midst right it says let me give you a
[1:41:50] thought here how do we pray
[1:41:51] we pray in Jesus name don't we every
[1:41:55] prayer is in the name
[1:41:58] amen or it's in his name or if there
[1:42:00] isn't any answer so now now see I want
[1:42:03] y'all to get that now please get that
[1:42:05] when you pray don't just be using cute
[1:42:08] words
[1:42:09] always put the name of Jesus in your
[1:42:12] prayer
[1:42:13] Amen in the name of your son what is his
[1:42:15] name
[1:42:16] his name is Jesus right so he said if
[1:42:19] you pray in his name then you'll get an
[1:42:21] answer to your prayer but if you don't
[1:42:23] pray in his name you can't expect an
[1:42:25] answer it says yet in in first John 5 14
[1:42:28] we are told this is the confidence that
[1:42:31] we have in him that if we ask anything
[1:42:33] according to his will glory he heareth
[1:42:37] us and if we know that he hear us
[1:42:41] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:42:44] the petition that we desired of him now
[1:42:47] we ask what is the will of God
[1:42:49] it says there is only one way to know
[1:42:52] his will and that is by the word of God
[1:42:56] if you want to know what the will of God
[1:42:58] is read the word of God
[1:43:01] here we go he says uh uh uh uh uh what
[1:43:05] is the will of God there's only one way
[1:43:07] to know his will and that is by the word
[1:43:08] of God Lamentations 337 who is he that
[1:43:12] saith and it comes to pass when the Lord
[1:43:14] commandeth it not there it is if it
[1:43:17] isn't in the word you can't have it
[1:43:20] all right so we can ask unless it's in
[1:43:23] the word and we can't petition or ask
[1:43:25] until it's in his name there it is again
[1:43:28] Jesus the name is the word the will you
[1:43:31] can't separate God in the word they are
[1:43:34] one
[1:43:35] now he goes on and makes this comment
[1:43:37] here because I just love it it says now
[1:43:40] then this word
[1:43:42] right here this words
[1:43:44] Glory uh he has left behind on the
[1:43:47] printed page
[1:43:48] is a part of him when you accept it by
[1:43:52] faith
[1:43:53] all right look at it now he says when
[1:43:55] you accepted by faith into a
[1:43:57] Spirit-filled life he said that his word
[1:44:00] was life John 6 63 B but that is exactly
[1:44:04] what he is John 14 6 I am the way the
[1:44:07] truth and the life Romans 8 9 be if any
[1:44:10] man have not the spirit a man of Christ
[1:44:14] is none of his there it is he is spirit
[1:44:17] and he is life that is exactly what the
[1:44:20] word is that is exactly what Jesus is he
[1:44:23] is the word now here's that statement
[1:44:24] here it is so when a spirit born
[1:44:29] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[1:44:32] word
[1:44:33] into his heart and places it upon his
[1:44:37] lips
[1:44:39] while that is the same as deity speaking
[1:44:47] that's the same as deity speaking
[1:44:49] now you know God come come up here and
[1:44:52] hide himself in and and reveal himself
[1:44:54] in Simplicity you know you know now now
[1:44:57] some of y'all if brother Brandon would
[1:44:59] have been here and said I give you your
[1:45:00] son I give you your daughter I give you
[1:45:03] this I give you that you're like oh
[1:45:04] praise God the promise said well what
[1:45:05] about when somebody else come up and say
[1:45:07] it
[1:45:09] I I heard I heard um uh we was at the
[1:45:12] meetings last year and and uh uh brother
[1:45:15] brother Solomon was was talking to a
[1:45:17] couple sisters about some things that
[1:45:18] they were looking for amen the house
[1:45:20] that they were looking for and these
[1:45:22] sisters heard them just kind of sharing
[1:45:24] they um they they hurt and at the end of
[1:45:26] the conversation themselves to say both
[1:45:28] of them at the same time say we give you
[1:45:31] your house
[1:45:32] nah nah you know what you can sit there
[1:45:34] and say well that's just these two
[1:45:36] sisters no you got to recognize God and
[1:45:38] his people
[1:45:40] and if you could if you could apply with
[1:45:42] faith you can receive what the person is
[1:45:45] saying I give you your healing you can
[1:45:48] receive that right now oh my God my God
[1:45:52] my God
[1:45:53] hey man oftentimes we want to wait to
[1:45:55] feel something you ain't gotta wait to
[1:45:57] feel nothing
[1:45:58] when somebody say I give you the Lord I
[1:46:00] receive it
[1:46:04] I give you that customer Lord I receive
[1:46:08] it
[1:46:09] come on somebody
[1:46:12] amen I give you that job Lord I receive
[1:46:15] it you ain't got to be sitting well I
[1:46:18] just wondered no no is that God is that
[1:46:20] not God you sit there in your down
[1:46:22] you'll never have nothing
[1:46:28] come on when a spirit man
[1:46:32] come on church this is what the problem
[1:46:34] where he says when a spirit born spirit
[1:46:36] filled man
[1:46:38] in faith takes that word into his heart
[1:46:44] and don't leave it there in your heart
[1:46:46] place it upon lips
[1:46:49] which means don't cross Pete
[1:46:52] place it upon his lips why that is the
[1:46:55] same as deity speaking
[1:46:59] and then it don't stop there Every
[1:47:02] Mountain
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:09] I ain't gotta wait to see the mountain
[1:47:11] go brother random see if we leave one
[1:47:13] grain of sand at a time it's still
[1:47:16] moving praise God
[1:47:19] Every Mountain has to go
[1:47:25] the mountain of sickness has to go the
[1:47:28] mountain of disease has to go
[1:47:32] the mountain of unbelief has to go
[1:47:35] I mean every Mountain I don't care what
[1:47:38] it is
[1:47:39] to go
[1:47:42] and you want to know what else he said
[1:47:43] Satan
[1:47:46] cannot
[1:47:47] stand before that man
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:59] what's that statement you made brother
[1:48:01] about uh fighting a defeated enemy
[1:48:05] don't let a defeated enemy defeat you
[1:48:10] that's just ridiculous
[1:48:13] you're gonna get defeated by a defeated
[1:48:15] enemy
[1:48:17] person that's already lost you gonna be
[1:48:20] defeated by that
[1:48:21] not me praise God
[1:48:25] I'ma keep the devil in this place
[1:48:27] anybody know what this place is
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:36] we used to sing that I went
[1:48:44] come on church I took back what he stole
[1:48:48] from me
[1:48:51] oh you better go get it
[1:48:53] hey man it don't belong to the devil God
[1:48:55] gave it to you so you go get it back
[1:48:57] from the Devil
[1:48:59] my I took back what he's told from me
[1:49:03] oh Jesus
[1:49:05] oh my my my my my
[1:49:09] is under my feet Church
[1:49:13] God is in his word
[1:49:17] God is also in his son
[1:49:20] I'm talking about God in his son Jesus
[1:49:24] had to tell him say when you seen me
[1:49:27] you've seen the father they they like
[1:49:29] that shows the father says you know you
[1:49:31] don't get it you don't get it you're
[1:49:33] looking at God
[1:49:35] when you see me you're seeing the father
[1:49:38] right and and hey brother Brandon
[1:49:40] amazing super say the most important
[1:49:42] revelation of godhead in the whole Bible
[1:49:43] is that Jesus is God
[1:49:47] he and the father are one there is one
[1:49:49] God and his name is the Lord Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ you want to know God's name Jesus
[1:49:56] all power was given to Jesus
[1:50:00] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:50:03] is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:50:09] Acts chapter 9 verse four through five
[1:50:14] glory to God look at this it says and he
[1:50:16] fell to the Earth
[1:50:18] and he heard a voice saying unto him
[1:50:20] Saul Saul which is Paul he's talking
[1:50:22] about Saul saw why persecuted thou me
[1:50:26] and he said who are thou Lord Paul
[1:50:29] talking to a pillar fire
[1:50:32] amen this great light that's shining
[1:50:34] Paul shining and Paul not only sunlight
[1:50:37] but there was other people saw the light
[1:50:39] but Paul heard the voice that came from
[1:50:42] the light
[1:50:43] glory to God here's the question there's
[1:50:45] many people that saw the pillar fire in
[1:50:48] brother branham's day but did they hear
[1:50:50] the voice
[1:50:54] because God is in his man
[1:50:56] did they hear the voice that was coming
[1:50:58] from the pillar fire
[1:51:00] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he says
[1:51:03] who are thou Lord and the Lord said
[1:51:07] I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is
[1:51:12] harmony to kick against the pricks
[1:51:15] it was it was it was it was here Paul on
[1:51:18] the road to Damascus amen when he has
[1:51:20] his experience and he recognizes that
[1:51:22] that same pillar fire that led the
[1:51:24] children of Israel out of out of Egypt
[1:51:26] glory to God he was talking to that very
[1:51:29] same pillow fire same pillow fire that
[1:51:31] when God spoke in the beginning let
[1:51:33] there be light and that wasn't so s u in
[1:51:37] light that was s o n light
[1:51:40] and when that son light came forth this
[1:51:43] is the light that Paul was talking to
[1:51:44] and that light took a picture with a
[1:51:47] prophet today
[1:51:48] we know he's the same yesterday today
[1:51:50] and forever
[1:51:52] I'm Jesus whom you persecute look at
[1:51:55] this out of the message
[1:51:57] who is this Melchizedek
[1:52:00] brother random says now we find out that
[1:52:02] this person had no father
[1:52:04] no mother
[1:52:06] no beginning of days or ending of life
[1:52:09] it was God
[1:52:11] in morphe
[1:52:13] now the word comes he says the Greek
[1:52:15] word means change
[1:52:18] is a change was used the Greek word
[1:52:21] means change was used changing himself
[1:52:25] in more faith from one person one person
[1:52:29] the Greek word they're in morphe means
[1:52:31] it was taken from the stage act that one
[1:52:34] person has changed his Mass to make him
[1:52:36] some other character look at it this is
[1:52:39] like in school
[1:52:40] just recently I believe Rebecca just
[1:52:43] before she graduated they had one of
[1:52:45] Shakespeare's plays and one young man
[1:52:48] had to change his clothes several times
[1:52:51] now in the play it's the same young
[1:52:54] fella acting out different parts
[1:52:57] now here's the thing the congregation or
[1:53:00] the audience knew that it was the same
[1:53:01] Young fella
[1:53:03] how could they tell how could they tell
[1:53:05] not by his outfit
[1:53:08] but his voice would give him away
[1:53:11] maybe the height of this young man would
[1:53:13] give away maybe his stature or his bill
[1:53:16] would give away so no matter what part
[1:53:18] he was playing it was still the same
[1:53:20] young man and this is where we got to be
[1:53:22] able to see amen and father Son and Holy
[1:53:24] Ghost is still the same God in the
[1:53:27] office of father in the office of son in
[1:53:30] the office of holy spirit it's the same
[1:53:32] God changing his Mass
[1:53:36] it's not three different gods it's the
[1:53:38] same God
[1:53:40] look at it now
[1:53:42] it says to change his clothes several
[1:53:44] times because he played two or three
[1:53:45] different parts but the same person had
[1:53:48] come out one time he was a villain and
[1:53:50] when you come out the next time he was
[1:53:52] another character and now the Greek word
[1:53:54] and morphe means that he changed his
[1:53:56] mask
[1:53:57] goes on
[1:53:59] Glory Glory Glory he said that's what
[1:54:02] God did it's the same God all the time
[1:54:06] God in the form of the father of the
[1:54:08] spirit the pill of fire the same God was
[1:54:11] made flesh and dwelt Among Us in morphe
[1:54:13] brought out so he could be seen
[1:54:17] amen and now that same God is the Holy
[1:54:20] Ghost father son uh not three Gods three
[1:54:22] opposites three acts of the one God the
[1:54:25] Bible said there is one God not three
[1:54:30] but that's how they says uh they
[1:54:32] couldn't you you can't get that get this
[1:54:34] straightened out and have three Gods you
[1:54:36] would never sell a Jew that I'll tell
[1:54:39] you that one who knows better he knows
[1:54:41] there's only one God this is why a lot
[1:54:44] of people don't follow Christianity
[1:54:45] because they they still bringing out
[1:54:47] three Gods that's amen that's that's
[1:54:49] that's actually polytheistic
[1:54:52] you got to get back to Revelation that
[1:54:54] God is one
[1:54:56] amen God is one it was God in the father
[1:54:59] God and the son God in the in in the
[1:55:02] Holy Ghost is the same God and all those
[1:55:04] three officers now is God dwelling
[1:55:06] inside of you
[1:55:08] glory to God stay with me here he says
[1:55:10] The Great I Am
[1:55:14] I'm sorry I'm going to the message the
[1:55:16] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:55:18] amen
[1:55:19] let me uh yeah this is this is kind of
[1:55:22] where I want to be here
[1:55:24] Revelation Jesus Christ we're just
[1:55:26] talking about I'm hitting the highlights
[1:55:27] on this God is God is in his son the
[1:55:30] greatest Revelation you can ever get is
[1:55:32] that Jesus Christ is God
[1:55:34] Jesus Christ is God not not a set and
[1:55:38] I'm gonna go a little further we don't
[1:55:39] heard the scripture preached us so many
[1:55:41] times that God so loved the world
[1:55:43] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:55:46] whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:55:48] perish but have everlasting life and we
[1:55:50] got signed that sign that showed up at
[1:55:52] football stadiums John 3 16. and people
[1:55:55] have done it without Revelation and
[1:55:56] understanding let me let me try to make
[1:55:59] sure you understand it wasn't just God
[1:56:00] sending his son
[1:56:02] I want you to think about this if you
[1:56:05] had a son
[1:56:07] praise God Amen and
[1:56:09] um uh your son had done nothing wrong
[1:56:12] but maybe you love me so much you say
[1:56:14] you know and you might have set up a
[1:56:16] rule say now brother Jack if you go over
[1:56:18] this line if you go over this line
[1:56:19] you're gonna die brother Jack
[1:56:21] and uh I said okay that's the rule if I
[1:56:23] go over the line and then I go and I
[1:56:25] step across the line
[1:56:27] oh you like well brother Jack I love you
[1:56:28] so much I don't want to see you die
[1:56:30] I'ma bring my son over here he gonna die
[1:56:33] in your place you're gonna call your son
[1:56:34] whatever his name is
[1:56:35] he'll come here come your son he say son
[1:56:38] I'm sorry I don't want to see brother
[1:56:39] Jack die I'm gonna have to send you down
[1:56:41] there yes son if I was your son
[1:56:43] if I was just I'd say wait a minute wait
[1:56:45] a minute wait a minute what was the rule
[1:56:47] if you said brother Jack go cross the
[1:56:49] line he died it brother Jack go across
[1:56:51] the line what brother Jack gone by I
[1:56:54] didn't go across the line so I ain't
[1:56:56] dying for him
[1:56:57] if I was just something that's the way I
[1:56:59] respond I mean God thinks big bigger and
[1:57:02] better than that so it wasn't God giving
[1:57:04] us his son God actually became the son
[1:57:07] so he could die for us
[1:57:11] oh my
[1:57:13] God had to take on flesh in order to die
[1:57:16] for us so he he went from Spirit form
[1:57:19] because God was a spirit and they that
[1:57:22] worship Him must worship him in
[1:57:27] in spirit and in truth
[1:57:29] come on God was a spirit so God had to
[1:57:32] take on flesh and he took on flesh in
[1:57:34] the body of Jesus
[1:57:37] it was the same God all the time
[1:57:39] changing his Mass
[1:57:45] let's pick this up the revelation of
[1:57:47] Jesus Christ brother Brandon make some
[1:57:48] statements here
[1:57:51] says The Great I Am
[1:57:53] the almighty God
[1:57:55] has come as Spirit to fill his true
[1:57:57] church
[1:57:59] he says he has a right to move anywhere
[1:58:01] he wants to
[1:58:03] and upon anybody he wants to
[1:58:06] we don't make any holy men amongst us
[1:58:09] but the whole true Congregation of the
[1:58:11] Lord Is Holy because of the presence of
[1:58:14] the Holy Spirit it is he
[1:58:17] the holy spirit that is Holy not the
[1:58:21] congregation of itself
[1:58:23] it's not you but it's what God has done
[1:58:25] in you and what he is still doing in you
[1:58:27] it says now that is a revelation
[1:58:30] Jesus Christ is God
[1:58:33] the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:58:36] it is the Jesus of the new
[1:58:40] no matter how hard you try you can't
[1:58:42] prove there are three gods
[1:58:46] at least not to me you can't
[1:58:48] it says but it also takes the Revelation
[1:58:50] by the Holy Spirit to make you
[1:58:52] understand the truth that he is one it
[1:58:54] take a it take a revelation for you to
[1:58:57] understand the truth that God is one the
[1:58:59] Lord our God is one Moses said that
[1:59:03] right it said to take a revelation to
[1:59:06] make you understand the truth that he is
[1:59:07] one it takes a revelation to see that
[1:59:09] Jehovah the Old Testament is the Jesus
[1:59:12] of the new
[1:59:13] Satan crept into the church and blinded
[1:59:17] the people to this truth
[1:59:19] and when they were blinded to it it
[1:59:21] wasn't long until the Church of Rome
[1:59:24] stopped baptizing in the name of the
[1:59:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:32] he goes on and makes this statement it
[1:59:34] says I admit
[1:59:37] it takes a revelation from the Holy
[1:59:39] Ghost to see the truth about the godhead
[1:59:42] these days
[1:59:46] when we are in the midst of the
[1:59:47] perverting of so much scripture
[1:59:52] he says but the prevailing
[1:59:55] overcoming Church
[1:59:57] is built on Revelation so we can expect
[2:00:01] God to reveal his truth to us
[2:00:03] it says however
[2:00:05] you actually don't need a revelation on
[2:00:07] water baptism now this is one he said
[2:00:09] you don't even need God to reveal this
[2:00:11] to you man it's not even one to pray
[2:00:14] over
[2:00:15] you know I don't want to uh uh
[2:00:19] uh make it so simple but like you know I
[2:00:21] I you know how some people try to be so
[2:00:23] spiritual they I mean they just they
[2:00:25] just you know the the Lord lead me to do
[2:00:27] this the Lord lead me to the Lord ain't
[2:00:29] LED you to do all that and God ain't
[2:00:30] talking as much as you say he talking
[2:00:32] anyway
[2:00:34] the Lord this the Lord did they put they
[2:00:35] blame everything on the Lord
[2:00:37] the Lord told me to leave this job and
[2:00:39] go to what job
[2:00:41] you still got to work right because the
[2:00:43] Bible also say a man don't work
[2:00:48] right we got to keep it in the word the
[2:00:50] Lord this the Lord the Lord the Lord I
[2:00:52] mean everybody and then they get so
[2:00:54] Spirit today they go to they go to
[2:00:55] Walmart and then they're praying on the
[2:00:58] toothpaste out
[2:00:59] Papa which toothpaste should I buy don't
[2:01:03] do don't don't don't waste prayer like
[2:01:04] that with God don't waste God time get
[2:01:07] the one that's on sale
[2:01:12] don't waste God's time
[2:01:14] praise the Lord amen but you know but
[2:01:17] people try to be so spiritual and when
[2:01:19] it comes to what about baptism you ain't
[2:01:21] even got to be spiritual
[2:01:22] right brother random say you don't even
[2:01:24] you don't even need a revelation on this
[2:01:26] it's just so plain right there in the
[2:01:28] scripture I want to just deal with it
[2:01:30] just for a few minutes
[2:01:31] amen here it says this you don't need a
[2:01:35] revelation on water baptism it is right
[2:01:38] there staring you in the face
[2:01:40] would it be possible
[2:01:42] for one minute for the apostles to be
[2:01:45] led astray from a direct command of the
[2:01:48] Lord to baptize in the name of the
[2:01:51] father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:01:54] and then find them in willful
[2:01:56] disobedience
[2:01:57] now let me just you know just I'm I'm a
[2:02:00] I'm gonna jump in and out of that quote
[2:02:02] let's go to Matthew 28 real quick and
[2:02:05] we'll read what our brother Brandon's
[2:02:07] referring to here
[2:02:08] Matthew 28 verse 18. amen through 20.
[2:02:13] now Jesus is uh risen from the dead and
[2:02:19] here at this moment he is uh telling the
[2:02:21] uh the disciples giving him some
[2:02:23] Commandments here you know he they have
[2:02:25] a they have something that they need to
[2:02:27] do oh my oh my mama
[2:02:29] hallelujah amen he gives them a
[2:02:31] commandment here he says uh
[2:02:34] uh Jesus came and spanking him saying
[2:02:37] all power was given to me in heaven and
[2:02:39] in Earth go ye therefore and teach All
[2:02:42] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[2:02:44] the father and of the son and of the
[2:02:47] Holy Ghost so here Jesus gives them a
[2:02:50] man direct commandment
[2:02:53] Hallelujah baptized in the name of the
[2:02:56] father
[2:02:57] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:00] verse 20 teaching them to observe all
[2:03:02] things whatsoever I commanded you and
[2:03:04] Lord I'm with you always even until the
[2:03:07] end of the world Amen
[2:03:08] Jesus gives him very specific
[2:03:10] instructions but ten days later we find
[2:03:14] the day of Pentecost occurring Acts
[2:03:17] chapter 2 verse 38 through 41.
[2:03:24] Jesus say baptize in the name of the
[2:03:28] father
[2:03:29] and of the Sun and of the Holy Ghost but
[2:03:34] 10 days late on the day of Pentecost
[2:03:36] verse 38 and Acts 2 then Peter said unto
[2:03:40] them repent
[2:03:42] glory and be baptized
[2:03:45] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[2:03:49] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[2:03:52] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:54] for the promises unto you and to your
[2:03:57] children and to all that are forth even
[2:04:00] as men as the Lord Our God shall call
[2:04:03] I like this verse 47 with many other
[2:04:06] words that he testify and exhort saying
[2:04:07] save yourselves from this untoward
[2:04:09] generation then they that gladly
[2:04:11] received his word were baptized and the
[2:04:14] same day they were added unto them about
[2:04:15] three thousand Souls now let's go back
[2:04:18] to the quote brother Brandon was saying
[2:04:19] it's no way that the disciples would
[2:04:21] have got this wrong it's no way Jesus
[2:04:24] telling him baptize the name of Father
[2:04:26] Son and Holy Ghost and then they say
[2:04:28] baptize the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:29] Christ no way he would have got that
[2:04:31] wrong what was being said
[2:04:35] what was being said they caught the
[2:04:38] revelation of what was being said the
[2:04:41] church has confused us over the years
[2:04:43] but said there comes a time where God
[2:04:45] sends the Revelation back where people
[2:04:47] can catch it and understand who is the
[2:04:50] father
[2:04:51] who is the son who is the Holy Ghost the
[2:04:55] name of the Father the name of the son
[2:04:57] the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus
[2:05:00] Christ
[2:05:02] when you see me you've seen the father
[2:05:08] they called the Revelation this is why
[2:05:10] they told everybody to be baptized away
[2:05:11] and when you look in the book of Acts
[2:05:13] everybody was being baptized in the name
[2:05:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ you can't find
[2:05:18] one place in scripture where somebody
[2:05:20] was baptized in the name of Father Son
[2:05:22] and Holy Ghost
[2:05:23] it's not there you got to catch a
[2:05:26] revelation of what Jesus was saying
[2:05:31] look at it
[2:05:32] the prophet says and I and I wanna I
[2:05:35] wanna I'm I'm I'm coming home here I got
[2:05:37] something to show you
[2:05:39] amen I got something to show you
[2:05:42] look at this this quote I want to finish
[2:05:44] it just real quick
[2:05:47] would it be possible for one minute for
[2:05:49] the apostles to be led astray from a
[2:05:51] direct command of the lord lord to
[2:05:52] baptize the name of the father and the
[2:05:54] Son and the Holy Ghost and then find
[2:05:56] them in willful Disobedience they knew
[2:05:59] what the name was
[2:06:01] and there is not one
[2:06:03] place in scripture where they baptize
[2:06:06] any other way than in the name of the
[2:06:08] Lord Jesus Christ common sense
[2:06:10] we'll tell you that the book of Acts is
[2:06:12] the church in action and if they baptize
[2:06:15] that way in the book of Acts
[2:06:17] then that's the way to baptize
[2:06:19] now if you think that is strong
[2:06:21] if you think that is strong
[2:06:24] what do you think it is
[2:06:26] anyone
[2:06:28] who was not baptized
[2:06:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:33] had to be baptized over again
[2:06:36] now I want to say that I want to make
[2:06:37] sure you're not just reading the quote I
[2:06:40] want you to become the quote
[2:06:42] if you have not been baptized in the
[2:06:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you need
[2:06:47] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:06:49] Jesus Christ
[2:06:51] if you've been baptized in the name of
[2:06:53] Father Son and Holy Ghost you need to be
[2:06:55] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:06:57] Jesus Christ
[2:06:58] because there's nobody in the Bible
[2:07:00] that's ever been baptized that way and I
[2:07:02] know the church taking them down every
[2:07:04] week
[2:07:04] in the name of father son or Holy Ghost
[2:07:06] without an understanding that the name
[2:07:09] of the Father the name of the son and
[2:07:12] the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus
[2:07:15] Christ if you want to receive the Holy
[2:07:18] Ghost
[2:07:18] you got to be baptized in the name of
[2:07:20] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:25] you want to go to heaven you got to be
[2:07:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:07:29] Christ and you can't stick or say what
[2:07:31] God understand no God understand that he
[2:07:34] told you the truth
[2:07:35] and now you got to do something with the
[2:07:36] truth that you've heard
[2:07:48] Paul told him that
[2:07:50] to be re-baptized
[2:07:52] and we'll pick it up here in Acts 19.
[2:07:54] I'm just giving you a description then I
[2:07:56] want to show you something I'm coming
[2:07:57] I'm actually closing right now I'm
[2:07:59] closing
[2:08:00] I don't get scared I'm closing I'm
[2:08:03] closing
[2:08:06] I I see I I I got my next part is God is
[2:08:10] in his man but I I had to stop here
[2:08:13] today I wanted to stop right here I want
[2:08:15] to close right and I want to make sure
[2:08:16] it's clear if you have not been baptized
[2:08:19] according to Acts chapter 2 38.
[2:08:22] you need to be baptized that way
[2:08:26] amen
[2:08:28] even in the Bible
[2:08:31] Paul had to tell them that they had to
[2:08:33] be re-baptized here in Acts 19 we found
[2:08:36] out what Paul told him now had you been
[2:08:38] a part of Paul's Church
[2:08:40] would you have listened to what Paul
[2:08:42] said
[2:08:44] let me tell you something
[2:08:46] if you won't get re-baptized today you
[2:08:48] wouldn't have did it back then
[2:08:53] Acts 19 look at it verse 1.
[2:08:56] and it came to pass
[2:09:00] that while Apollos was at Corinth
[2:09:04] Paul
[2:09:05] having passed through the upper Coast
[2:09:07] came to Ephesus
[2:09:10] it means a little something different
[2:09:12] for me today because I just left Ephesus
[2:09:18] and finding certain disciples
[2:09:22] he said unto them
[2:09:24] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:09:26] you believed
[2:09:28] and they said unto him we have not so
[2:09:31] much asked her whether that be any Holy
[2:09:33] Ghost
[2:09:35] and he said to them unto what then were
[2:09:38] you baptized see they was baptized wrong
[2:09:40] that's why they hadn't received the Holy
[2:09:42] Ghost yet right it says he sent them to
[2:09:44] wealth then where are you baptized now
[2:09:45] let me let me also say this now you know
[2:09:48] you can you can actually receive the
[2:09:49] Holy Ghost without being baptized
[2:09:52] hello somebody
[2:09:54] it happened in uh in Acts chapter 10
[2:09:56] Cornelius house right they had the Holy
[2:09:58] Ghost without even being baptized but
[2:10:00] when you do got the Holy Ghost it'll
[2:10:02] take you to the water to get baptized
[2:10:06] come on chirps
[2:10:09] right he say say say this now it says
[2:10:11] until then what were you baptized they
[2:10:13] said unto John's baptism
[2:10:15] then said Paul John barely baptized with
[2:10:18] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[2:10:22] the people that they should believe on
[2:10:23] him which should come after him that is
[2:10:25] on Christ Jesus
[2:10:27] when they heard this
[2:10:29] they heard the words
[2:10:31] they felt the conviction
[2:10:33] the Bible says they were baptized in the
[2:10:35] name of the Lord Jesus they were
[2:10:37] re-baptized now John had a really good
[2:10:40] baptism
[2:10:41] John was a prophet and these people
[2:10:43] heard the word of the prophet he was
[2:10:45] followed but it wasn't enough God had
[2:10:47] went further than John
[2:10:50] John was baptizing unto repentance but
[2:10:53] not as someone that can forgive you for
[2:10:55] your sins not only forgive you but
[2:10:58] cleanse you from it
[2:11:00] and give you give you give you his
[2:11:02] spirit so you don't have to go back into
[2:11:04] that sin no more oh I love this I love
[2:11:07] this
[2:11:08] verse 6 says and when Paul laid his
[2:11:10] hands upon him the Holy Ghost came on
[2:11:12] them
[2:11:13] and they speak with tongues and
[2:11:14] prophesied
[2:11:16] please give me
[2:11:18] amen the slides
[2:11:21] there Amen in that PowerPoint
[2:11:24] I love this because the the Bible says
[2:11:26] that Paul was passing through the coast
[2:11:28] of Ephesus it was in the emphasis that
[2:11:31] they they had a problem
[2:11:33] and they had to be re-baptized
[2:11:36] well this uh picture that you're looking
[2:11:39] at is a a picture of a a baptismal area
[2:11:44] a man in Ephesus
[2:11:46] in this uh this particular building is
[2:11:49] actually a building where they call it
[2:11:51] Saint John's Basilica because it's the
[2:11:53] place where John the Revelator was
[2:11:55] buried
[2:11:57] and these are some of the ruins of uh of
[2:11:59] this building that they have there and
[2:12:02] uh and the way that baptism happens is
[2:12:05] uh you know you start out here you can
[2:12:07] see this wall right here
[2:12:10] and the baptism areas inside but on this
[2:12:12] wall is what they call the preparation
[2:12:14] area
[2:12:15] you had to kind of prepare yourself amen
[2:12:18] before you would go in to be baptized
[2:12:20] they had three areas they had the
[2:12:21] preparation they had the baptism area
[2:12:24] and then they had an area for you to
[2:12:26] pray in
[2:12:27] after he got baptized
[2:12:29] so you know a convert once they heard
[2:12:32] the word let's say Paul would preach to
[2:12:34] them the word and and their their hearts
[2:12:36] would be convicted and these are people
[2:12:38] being re-baptized that you know what I I
[2:12:40] heard the word I want to be baptized in
[2:12:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:45] they would come from the preparation
[2:12:47] area
[2:12:48] then they would go into the baptismal
[2:12:50] area I think the next picture there
[2:12:52] please
[2:12:54] they would come into this baptism there
[2:12:56] go back just a little bit for me
[2:13:00] seeing this baptism area there's
[2:13:02] in the center here steps going down into
[2:13:04] the water
[2:13:06] and steps coming out the water
[2:13:08] then you have these two sides over here
[2:13:10] now now for them they got this holy one
[2:13:12] that's what this little small thing is
[2:13:13] but there's two sides uh the the the the
[2:13:17] guy there his name was Sammy says I want
[2:13:20] um I want I want y'all to come he says I
[2:13:22] want I want it I I think the the uh the
[2:13:25] term that he used was righteous men
[2:13:28] he says I need two righteous men to
[2:13:30] stand here and here two righteous men
[2:13:34] not just anybody
[2:13:36] but they got to be righteous standing
[2:13:37] there in this place so on the next slide
[2:13:40] you'll see that me and my my son-in-law
[2:13:42] have to stand here Amen in this little
[2:13:46] spot as Sam is coming in to be baptized
[2:13:49] and he's just going through the um uh uh
[2:13:53] the procedure with us and he's telling
[2:13:54] us how how this happened say he says now
[2:13:56] what it is that I just need y'all to
[2:13:58] hold my hand
[2:14:00] and it says uh you got to hold my hand
[2:14:02] because I I'm what I'm supposed to do is
[2:14:04] I'm being baptized I gotta walk down
[2:14:06] these steps into the awareness of when I
[2:14:08] walk in I gotta immerse myself just
[2:14:11] everything
[2:14:12] go down in that water
[2:14:14] everything cover everything everything
[2:14:17] like all your sins being covered
[2:14:20] and and and he said he said I just need
[2:14:22] you to hold me as I'm as I'm as I'm as
[2:14:24] I'm walking in he said now now we
[2:14:26] actually didn't actually do the Bachelor
[2:14:28] because nowadays we take people we dump
[2:14:29] them in the water and nothing wrong with
[2:14:31] that nothing wrong but back there in
[2:14:32] this in this time the the one that was
[2:14:35] coming to be baptized they had to be
[2:14:37] fully committed to the process
[2:14:39] so they actually had to walk into the
[2:14:41] water themselves
[2:14:42] and they had to just they had to just I
[2:14:45] mean empty everything out go into that
[2:14:46] water lower their head and be fully
[2:14:48] immersed in the water before they come
[2:14:51] out oh my my my I mean it showed that
[2:14:54] the conviction that they had right uh so
[2:14:57] so here here is they they walk through a
[2:15:00] man uh Sam Sam go to the next the next
[2:15:03] slide Sam told us the purpose
[2:15:06] but but for us holding his hands
[2:15:09] the purpose that we had to hold his
[2:15:12] hands when in that last that last
[2:15:13] picture it says because when I when I go
[2:15:16] and I and I get baptized everything in
[2:15:20] Hallelujah
[2:15:21] see the reason gotta hold my hands is
[2:15:23] because you gotta stop me
[2:15:28] from looking back
[2:15:31] he says because if I look back
[2:15:34] then the baptism didn't take place
[2:15:38] he said he said say so you got to make
[2:15:40] sure that when I when I come in and I
[2:15:42] dip myself that I keep walking out but
[2:15:46] don't let me look back
[2:15:48] hallelujah amen and I just believe amen
[2:15:52] there's been many that have maybe I've
[2:15:54] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:15:55] Jesus Christ but somewhere along the
[2:15:57] road you don't start looking back
[2:16:00] and maybe you're at a point now where
[2:16:02] you need to rededicate your life to God
[2:16:05] do you need to recommit yourself to God
[2:16:07] Don't Look Back look forward
[2:16:12] he says hold my hands righteous men hold
[2:16:15] my hands and don't let me look back
[2:16:18] don't let me turn back don't let me go
[2:16:20] back God has done something in my heart
[2:16:22] I want to go forward from this point
[2:16:24] amen I don't want to go back to where I
[2:16:26] came from
[2:16:28] Hallelujah
[2:16:31] the one that was being baptized
[2:16:34] they had to make a commitment
[2:16:36] then I'm I'm laying it all down in the
[2:16:38] water and this is what baptism really
[2:16:40] represents it's it's it's it's it's it's
[2:16:42] it's it's the old you coming into the
[2:16:45] water
[2:16:46] but it's the new you coming out just as
[2:16:49] Jesus was raised from the dead baptism
[2:16:52] is is symbolic of a resurrection it's
[2:16:56] the old person going into that watery
[2:16:58] grave
[2:17:00] but it's a new creation coming out
[2:17:06] repent
[2:17:08] every one of you
[2:17:10] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:17:13] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[2:17:15] sins
[2:17:16] the Bible say you shall receive the gift
[2:17:19] of the Holy Ghost
[2:17:21] I love this the promise
[2:17:24] is unto you
[2:17:27] and to your children
[2:17:29] see this is this is this is this is
[2:17:31] another another part that I like about
[2:17:33] this mamas and daddies
[2:17:35] if y'all know y'all went through this
[2:17:37] process and you didn't look back
[2:17:40] you're still moving forward there's a
[2:17:42] promise hanging over you
[2:17:45] I know your child is all messed up
[2:17:48] I know your child going through all
[2:17:49] kinds of stuff but when you go through
[2:17:51] this process there's a promise hanging
[2:17:53] over you
[2:17:55] the promises to you
[2:17:58] and your children
[2:18:00] those that are far off as
[2:18:04] merely as the Lord Our God shall call
[2:18:10] when you go through this process no no
[2:18:12] no no no no looking back
[2:18:15] and and see when you leave when you
[2:18:17] leave the baptism area the one thing now
[2:18:19] the next place they take you to is a
[2:18:21] room for prayer and you just sit there
[2:18:24] in that prayer room and I can just
[2:18:25] imagine many people going into this
[2:18:28] church and going into that prayer room
[2:18:30] and that's where God probably met him
[2:18:32] with the Holy Ghost brother Brandon
[2:18:33] would do it this way when when he when
[2:18:35] he baptized people in the name of Lord
[2:18:36] Jesus Christ immediately after they come
[2:18:38] up he have a word of prayer for him
[2:18:39] right there expecting God to fill him
[2:18:41] with the Holy Ghost he says he says when
[2:18:43] you come when you come like this
[2:18:46] determine
[2:18:48] under conviction believing that the word
[2:18:51] of God Is Right that God is in his word
[2:18:53] that it was God that spoke to you
[2:18:55] through his word when you come like that
[2:18:59] it says God is obligated
[2:19:03] God is obligated
[2:19:06] just be with the Holy Ghost
[2:19:09] and let me tell you something you ain't
[2:19:10] gonna be the first one
[2:19:12] to make God a liar
[2:19:17] but you got to make sure that you're
[2:19:19] coming
[2:19:21] fully committed
[2:19:23] not somebody
[2:19:25] encouraging you
[2:19:26] I know you come ready to Lord I'm ready
[2:19:29] to give it all up I'm ready to let it
[2:19:30] all go and I'm ready to walk in this
[2:19:33] newness of life I'm Not Looking Back
[2:19:36] I think brother Jerry told us that on on
[2:19:38] Wednesday nights about Lot's wife how
[2:19:41] she looked back we don't want to be like
[2:19:43] Lot's wife
[2:19:44] I'm Not Looking Back you know what
[2:19:46] caused Lot's wife to look back brother
[2:19:48] Brandon actually told us
[2:19:50] he said her grandkids
[2:19:54] he said her grandkids caused her to look
[2:19:56] back
[2:19:58] now you might ask the question well how
[2:20:00] did she have grandkids a young little
[2:20:02] fella little fella I was at brother
[2:20:04] Nathan Bryant church and I was teaching
[2:20:06] on uh a lot and um little fella said
[2:20:09] well I asked a question well what to me
[2:20:11] why do you think she looked back a
[2:20:13] little little say her grand her
[2:20:14] grandkids I see where'd you get that
[2:20:16] from
[2:20:17] you say you say brother Brandon said
[2:20:20] let's see what
[2:20:22] grandkids let's say when I read my Bible
[2:20:25] it said that Lott had two daughters
[2:20:27] and and the daughters
[2:20:30] um were uh were the ones that came out
[2:20:32] and those daughters was married now they
[2:20:34] was married
[2:20:36] praise God they had husbands but didn't
[2:20:38] have no children
[2:20:40] I don't know what the problem was but
[2:20:43] they they and and them boys
[2:20:46] had a homosexual Spirit but still
[2:20:48] married to his daughters
[2:20:50] all right that's the Bible but when you
[2:20:52] when I I that's all we was taught but
[2:20:55] when you go back and really read the
[2:20:56] scripture in Genesis 19
[2:20:58] actually put me up gym since 1912. pull
[2:21:01] me up there because brother Brandon said
[2:21:03] that they uh that was grandkids but
[2:21:06] where the grandkids come from how would
[2:21:08] a prophet be able to tell us that
[2:21:11] Genesis 19 I believe is verse 12.
[2:21:14] the angel come down there to try to get
[2:21:16] lot out and tell him that don't don't
[2:21:17] look back don't look back when you leave
[2:21:20] here you go Full Speed Ahead don't look
[2:21:22] back
[2:21:24] but look at what the the angel said says
[2:21:26] and the men said in the lot has thou
[2:21:29] hear any
[2:21:31] besides son-in-law
[2:21:40] when I read that one I said that young
[2:21:42] man was right on he said exactly what
[2:21:44] the prophet said and thy Sons
[2:21:47] we heard about the daughters coming out
[2:21:50] but what happened to the sons and their
[2:21:52] families
[2:21:54] don't look back
[2:21:56] don't let your family cause you to look
[2:21:58] back
[2:22:01] hold to the promise word of God that
[2:22:03] said Lord if I'm baptized in the name of
[2:22:05] the Lord Jesus Christ keep that
[2:22:06] scripture there I'm not finished with it
[2:22:08] if I'm baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:22:09] Jesus Christ
[2:22:11] you said the promised unto me and to my
[2:22:13] children those that are for office
[2:22:14] Minister Lord of God means the Lord my
[2:22:17] God to call imma take that seed that God
[2:22:19] gave me
[2:22:22] and I'm gonna just start giving God
[2:22:23] praise for it being manifest in my life
[2:22:26] because God can't lie God is in his word
[2:22:30] the men said in a lot has thou hear any
[2:22:32] besides son-in-law and thy sons and thy
[2:22:34] daughters and whatsoever thy has in the
[2:22:37] city bring them out of this place
[2:22:40] Church Don't Look Back give everything
[2:22:42] you got
[2:22:44] to following God
[2:22:46] and I just I had to pause I want to make
[2:22:48] sure it's clear I don't want us to shout
[2:22:50] over it I want to jump over it if you
[2:22:52] have not been baptized
[2:22:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22:58] make your way to the water quickly
[2:23:04] you don't need a revelation
[2:23:06] to understand that
[2:23:08] you just need to be obedient
[2:23:13] pool is always ready
[2:23:15] for you to be baptized
[2:23:18] here's the way you come
[2:23:20] repent

[2:23:26] the water
[2:23:28] a dry sinner
[2:23:30] and then leave the water a wet sinner
[2:23:34] repent be Godly sorry for all that
[2:23:38] you've done wrong
[2:23:39] repair
[2:23:41] sometimes people get baptized just to
[2:23:43] please the pastor you ain't pleasing me
[2:23:46] you ain't pleasing me you ain't doing
[2:23:47] nothing for me
[2:23:48] you ain't that that is not for me

[2:23:54] you're doing

[2:23:57] even find nobody to baptize and they
[2:24:00] baptized theyself they went down in the
[2:24:02] water theyself I couldn't find nobody to
[2:24:04] baptize me I'm gonna tell you another
[2:24:06] thing about baptism you don't even have
[2:24:08] to wait for the pastor to baptize you
[2:24:10] another believer can
[2:24:16] get another Minister from the church

[2:24:21] own children

[2:24:29] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:24:32] Jesus Christ
[2:24:34] for the remission of your sins you shall
[2:24:36] receive the gift for the Holy Ghost

[2:25:15] fathers we heard here that scripture is
[2:25:18] given by inspiration all scripture
[2:25:24] it's profitable for Doctrine it's
[2:25:26] profitable for reproof for conviction
[2:25:30] it's profitable for for correction
[2:25:33] to instruct Us in righteousness
[2:25:38] now that it has been given
[2:25:41] let it bring forth
[2:25:46] there's any Lord that is within the
[2:25:48] sound of our voice and have not repented
[2:25:52] they have not been baptized in the name
[2:25:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray Lord
[2:25:56] that this would be the day
[2:25:59] that they would come to repentance
[2:26:02] they would come to a decision that I
[2:26:04] want to be baptized the right way even
[2:26:06] if I've been baptized before it was
[2:26:08] wrong I want to I wanted to be done the
[2:26:10] right way like the the people in the
[2:26:12] book of Acts 19 did
[2:26:16] the spirit of conviction hit every heart
[2:26:20] God may we be determined when we leave
[2:26:22] this place that we're not going
[2:26:23] backwards we're not looking back but
[2:26:25] we're going for it
