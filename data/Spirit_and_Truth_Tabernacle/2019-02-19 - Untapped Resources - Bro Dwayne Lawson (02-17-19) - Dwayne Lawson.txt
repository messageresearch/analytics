little bit I got to get the preacher out here and let him preach it sounded like y'all gonna pull on the Word of God tonight is one thing to shout over a good song as I mentioned this morning you see everything that's connected to us has some type of spirit connected to it brother Branham told us that you're either being influenced from one of two worlds either the underworld or the above world it's a spirit associated with everything there's a spirit associated and music there's worship music that makes you want to lift your hands and just cry in the presence of God they're shouting music that was makes you want to move your feet a little bit hallelujah hey man there's rock-and-roll which you shouldn't be listening to that make you wanna bang heads with somebody there's country music that makes you what make you want to kill yourself you shouldn't be listening to it right even there's rap music that makes you want to kill somebody else you shouldn't be listening to it hello somebody listen to things that glorify God but we found out a man that what we should be listening to is the Word of God because the Word of God also has experience this word is spirit and it's life so you listen to the Word of God that's how you're gonna actually get a body change one day by listening to the Word of God so even after these services are over I hope you'll go back and listen to them all over again it'll change your body changing body as I precious brother Dewayne Lawson from ohayo comes to minister the word of the Lord to us on today tonight we want to sing this song in everything give God thanks is he worthy I said is he worthy come on lift your hands to heaven close your eyes and let's sing this song tonight and everything give things [Music] give him thanks thanks [Music] give them thanks [Music] in the good times [Music] praise his name in the bad times do the same [Music] [Applause] [Music] and he did it he did it for me he did it for you I want to say that I have been thoroughly blessed by the songs tonight I truly just left the worship the spiritual worship and when the Holy Spirit comes and picks it up and uses it and takes a different level a man we would love to worship in the anointing and then the Spirit of God and we want to say that we have been very thankful and privileged to be a part of these meetings here in the services that each one of you that's able to come god bless you everything that's been done to make these possible god bless you the pastor's the brothers and it has been a real honor to meet some of you for the first time and that's pretty something to be done or said through the meetings has been a real blessing to you let's just bow our hearts as and we enter the service father we thank you for this wonderful music Lord the musicians and the talents that you have nor did you have endowed them will to use for your glory Lord these these singers and players Lord Lord they're they're so talented surely Lord they didn't found the place in the world that would have exalted their Lord but father they've they've sold it to you they have Lord they have they have brought Lord their gifts to you that you would use them for your role we thank you for them tonight and we thank you for these believers Lord together around the same time word and leave your word father we just ask you tonight God make you release your anointing upon your word and father I pray that the angels of God [Music] reward would take their posts to positions here in this building tonight Lord may you the Lord let down Jacob's Ladder may you send your angels into this room Lord if we read about it in the Bible many times but Lord we know that you remain the same yesterday today and forever and we're asking you that you would bring your strength in this meeting your anointing Lord and father that you would make our words or more than natural men but may you be the voice behind the voice may Lord you speak to the need in the situation's of each arm and we ask you to bless your people father as we enter your word we pray in jesus name a man man if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to turn to the book of Mark the 11th chapter of the one Thank You musicians god bless you richly amen and we want to turn here to mark the 11th chapter tonight we want to read the 22nd verse of market 11 and you know Jesus has just cursed a fig tree in it within 24 hours a miracle had taken place upon it and they were marveling at what had happened to the tree just by the spoken word and jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God now if you do some study and you know that is the faith of God now for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but that he shall believe that the things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto thee you what things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe that you have them or receive them now that's actually in a present tense believe that you have it right now and the scripture said and you shall have them you have to believe it is a present tense before it becomes in your future if you want something tomorrow you've got to believe for it today if you want something to change in your life tomorrow you've got to believe today hey man we ask the Lord to bless his word is you may be seated tonight I want to just talk to you a little bit tonight and if I would take a title for this sermon I want to speak to you on the untapped resources upon untapped resources they've met in other words things that are available that we are not using currently but just because we're not using some of these things does not mean they're not available amen but they're an untapped they meant an untapped resource you know I believe personally that this is the time remember we just went way down there I believe that this is the time of possession they man I believe the season that we are living in is a season that when the Church of God is moving in to their promises I believe that's the moment that we're living in today I believe that that's the season that we are in is the season of possessing manna I know you know the scripture that God promised Abraham that he would have a land amen but in Acts the seventh chapter how many knows the Bible says that Abraham never actually possessed the land amen he was promised the land but he never owned the land amen but but we do know that his children later under the ministry of Joshua amen actually possessed what God promised to Abraham amen and each one of them men that possess things possess them by promise safe man and if you go back and you realize that there's things written to the church of the Corinthians that God would change their bodies in the moment and how that he would make corruptible put on incorruption and mortal would put on immortality and you all know that was promised to a Corinthian church but the Corinthian church never possessed that promise amen his promise that our body should we change in the moment the twinklin line 1st Thessalonians 4 and that promise was made to the Thessalonians by Paul but the Thessalonians never possess that promise amen but yet if we know them that it was spoken for a future civilization or future Church that was coming into the scene just like Mark the eleventh chapter Amen if you say unto this mountain be now move now you can take doubt and explain that away and say that God wasn't actually meaning that he meant but I believe that God made a promise to these this it was just like he made two Corinthians and he made up FS alone Ian's but these promises are coming in to the Church of the Living God today amen now I want you to know God called that those disciples and made promises to them that they never experienced God called amen the Corinthian church and make promises they never experienced he made promises to the Thessalonians they never experienced amen but I want you to know in the season that we're living in God did not call you here to make a promise to you God does not call this gathering of the bride together to make promises to you but rather we are here to fulfill promises even we are not here to write a Bible we are here to fulfill the Bible we are not here to get a Bible promise we are here to fulfill a Bible promise this is the age of the manifesting of the sons of God that it's a season that we have come to even amen you didn't pick the season I didn't pick the season but god but God placed us in the season amen in here we are living in a season that I know when you say that that's going to load all kinds of pressure on the people Amen that we have to perform something we have to do something or we have to heal somebody but I mean let me just say it to you like this amen these are not pressures these are promises that have been made you know a man these are not pressures these are promises they men and I think about the Prophet telling the story one time about Paul Rader when he was so sick and he was in the bed and remember his wife was in the room prayed and he went out into I think I guess he would like it like a coma he went out and while he was out he had a he had a dream and in the dream he was a logger and he was up in the northern country and he was working and his boss man comes to him and told him said Paul you got to go up here and cut this big tree down him and you got to carry that tree back to the camp and and this is your job so the boss told him to do a job when he got up there and he looked at the big tree he thought my I'll cut this tree down and carry and then he got to looking at the tree and the size of it and Sybilla inability but he was under a commission from the boss to get it back to the camp so he found himself under pressure by the commission that he had been given he meant but but but he said that when he got it cut down he said a voice spoke to him and said Paul look right besides you there's a river running there amen and Paul if you just rolled that log over in the river you can ride the log back to camp so what was the pressure became Paul's ride amen he didn't carry the log the log carried him and Jesus Christ has commissioned this church to cast out devils Eamon he is commissioned this church to preach the gospel to do miracles Eamon the manifestations of the word is to be fulfilled in you and if you let it be a pressure on you that you find yourself trying to do something even but we're not trying to do anything but there is promises concerning the Church of the Living God amen and it is I rise tonight amen and we can just let the spirit do it amen amen when I think about this tonight I think of God telling that this is a season now if you study your Bibles you know that there was many promises that had not been fulfilled at the time of Jesus Christ and and to think that the words that had been spoken in Isaiah Malachi and Ezekiel and all the way back in the days of Abraham had laid in the pages of the Bible waiting to Jesus Christ came and when he was borned he fulfilled many prophecies hundreds of prophecies amen but it was in the last moments of his life while he was hanging on the tree that many prophecies came together in that one specific moment Haman amen and all of them begin to fulfill themselves right together it was like a it was like a short quick work where many prophecies were falling together at the same time now now don't look back to yourself this Lord and say well I wish we was living in the days of Jesus amen when God was doing something wonderful Haman I want you to know tonight that God is fulfilling many prophecies in the seasons that we are living in amen and things are happening right now whether you know that or not whether you have anything to do with it or not world governments are moving right now in the College of the prophecies of God to fulfill every word that God wrote is exactly the truth Haman I want you to know tonight that the Bible said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man and you tell me when has there been a time amen since Sodom but homosexuality is the way that it is right now come on church amen the government is right now protecting homosexuality and it's it's wrong for me to sit here and condemn the thing can you imagine that we are living in America amen a country that is a Christian nation amen but the devil has so influenced the political realm but they're calling good evil and evil they're calling it good amen as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man let me ask you is this a time of Sodom I mean is there anything that more matches Sodom and what we're seeing today Amen I say it the way a prophet said it one time he said if God don't destroy this nation he will have to raise Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to it amen because we have come back to a time of Sodom listen friends amen I'm not just railing on something but the homosexuality was promised in the Bible it would be there and it's there and then the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the same day amen you have a sodomite day you also have the days of Noah when the sons of God looked upon the daughters of man hey man have we got that day amen it's right here hey man fulfill the same at the same moment of time hey man the Scriptures tells us that the spiritual wickedness will reach high places it's at that time but that would be a spirit of delusion where men would believe a lie and be damned by the lie belief it's at that time even is that the time the Bible prophesied that it was calling me so the devil has his people in place it's a Roman Church in its place is the Protestant church in its place I begged you to answer to me tonight because the devil has put them in place with the power of his unbelief by his perverted power the devil has got his people in all of their places and they meant you you you if you would just be graceful women tonight amen but I believe that if the devil has a power to put people in his place amen don't you tell me that God don't have the power to put his people in their places the devil has Sodom in that place tonight I know that there's a bride that's in the hand of the magic card and the cogsa prophesy and begin to turn over your life and that's a that's an anointing that rests upon our lives that come from a prophetic word not because we wanted to be here tonight not because we've asked for these kinds of things but there was a word that was spoken over our lives in that word is coming out of the prophecy of the Bible and it's fulfilling the scriptures God has actually claimed your body to fulfill his prophecy in this last day what about Ezekiel the 37th chapter when a valley was full of dry bones and God said today ZQ really spawns live he said I don't know Lord I don't know Lord you know if they'll live he said prophesy prophet amen and the Prophet said hear ye Oh dry bones the word of the Lord now y'all help me out but I'm not a real learned guy amen but I don't think Amen their ears are bones ears are cartilage and if you look at that skeleton have you ever seen one with ears no you have it and then bones didn't have no ears Amen they couldn't might hear the word of the Lord but the word of the Lord was commanded unto them bones and God raised him by pathetic anointing God has commanded a blessing was the Church of the Living God we are your but same on and said son you'll be there moon you'll be there Jupiter you be there subtract the few be here amen rather you be there and you be there that positioning is holding in the Church of the Living God do you see what power is moving you tonight it's the power of God moving you every footstep on the righteous is ordered of the Lord there is an absolute that's greater than you there's a power that is greater than your ability as a power that is above your choice making it is the power of a prophetic word and it claims your life and it claims your heart for this message you didn't ask for this message oh come on you didn't you you didn't come looking for this this came looking for you brother I'm a simple hillbilly grew up on a river I never had a fish was always caught by the fisherman this is Jesus somebody's will perform this something's moving you into this that's a Power greater than you as an anointing greater than you something bigger than you a man what is that something is moving you in the prophecy you know the Bible said the heathens imagine a vain thing the heathens imagine a vain thing and they laugh and say we'll cut the cords asunder son so second chapter but you know what David before he wrote of that song he wrote there's a tree planted by the water that cannot that cannot be moved and the prophet of God said you get it down to the stump but you'll never destroy it because in the root of it it's a predestinated see amen and that seed will come forth the whole tree will have to grow back so the fruit can come home the top of the tree there is a predestinated fruit in the end time amen there's got to be another Eve it's got to be a second one it's gotta be somebody every Dean's Eve and that's the Church of the Living God that'll do what Eve couldn't do this one will stay with a word min-suk brother what can I do I'll tell you what you can do no other churches ever done it nothing in the history of mankind has ever done it there will be a bride stay with understanding we are in heavenly places ever devil under your feet oh yes sir that's what the Bible teaches he has raised up above all principalities and powers is that right and you who he hath quickened or made alive sets with him in that power tonight every spirit under you ever devil under you see this is time for you to take the thing that belongs to you not that you're asking for it came in he chose you hey he told me that's right before even the world be damned he made his choice now the prophet of God said there has to come in Ephesians 2 this there has to come and moving into this Joshua would let the children over but they had to take the land amen they had to take it over six inches at a time a little here but the whole time they were moving in brother I tell you there was a church today that is taking the land of adoption and step by step glory the power of the word the secret is the world and she knows what he wants done with it hey man can you imagine the caterpillar and his argument amen with his insides when he comes to a certain point and he's an earthbound creature and something says climb that tree and he says I'm scared of heights I like my I like my existence down here and he says I'm not going up that tree but in a minute something on the inside is an absolute above his own mind and this God spoke a word concerning that caterpillar god never created caterpillar how many knows that God never created a caterpillar he created a butterfly on the journey created a fellowship under eating right you see you're something greater than you it's annoying and greater than you when that when that word starts preaching and start speaking do you see that little caterpillar after a while something takes over its body not it's mine it was the word spoken from the beginning in every step it takes us a safe lord even in its in its in its better opinion it's not going but it's not safe Lord every step goes right up amen after life finds himself up there in a tree and the absolute was the one that spoke concerning the thing before it was ever on the earth before it was ever there God's Word origin where it would go and hide we'd get there and what would be the outcome and the same God if he thinks that about a caterpillar what does he think about a child of God tonight you know I was preaching I'm in India one night and mentioned that you may have heard it I don't know but I was in India preaching I mentioned this very thing that there's an absolute over our lives and we was in a you know in a little classroom that night it was a well I say a little one that feet three four hundred people and we were we were in there and they had that thing filled up he's about twenty pastors 15 20 whatever it was was sitting over on my right about as far as from here that wall when I went in there that night brother Jackson they had the wall filled up with posters like this amen but they were they were of him and there was about three or four of them on the wall behind me and I said to him can we take them down before I preach the gospel they said no by the way this is a Hindu school and we can use it but we can't change nothing about their gods or nothing we just use it to preach I said well alright then so they filled the building up and I'm preaching away and I'm just young I think it's my first or second trip to India and I'm preaching right away young in my ministry well as I'm preaching that was a woman about half way back in the in a far left like that she just fell out in the floor I didn't know what was happening she just started just squirming around she fell out like that she just moving around the floor like that nothing at first I thought well maybe she was just enjoying the spirit of something but in a minute i I felt the vibration of that thing and it was it was an evil spirit ISM had fell upon the woman and I didn't know what to do the Bible said preach the word be instant in season and and and I said well hey only thing I know is to preach the word I didn't can't preach it like it doesn't even happen whole church is looking at her and his spear lord put his hand on me said pray for that woman I stopped the meeting a man said everybody bow your heads and I made a prayer prayed over the woman when I got done praying for the woman I was I was going to go back to saying what I was saying before she failed and I just went back to preach him but instead of preaching and saying what was in my mind I heard my mouth say if God doesn't raise that woman up right now he's not even God I thought I almost covered my mouth for what have you said amen and I would never say that honest express her crazy saying if I said it ain't meant but I heard it come through me and when I did Amen there was an anointing found now this is from them pastor so this is what they told me the one brother went home with me that even have walked back toward the hotel he said brother Lawson he said when you pronounced the blessing on that woman and said God was gonna raise her he said that was a fog covered you he said we couldn't see you standing in the pulpit anymore like a mist that settled down in that room and now I could see it milky like but I didn't realize it was that powerful I could they was kind of foggy but I thought I was just energized amen but that was their compassion but when that happened all of a sudden that woman stood up off of the ground and she began to scream out and rejoice at the same moment that was a wind coming around and I could hear it blow I know if it's my ears or if it was a wee I didn't know what it was but you could just so physically hear it I didn't make it happen I was just there when it was happening and it come in the room just like that and that lady stood up and the place when in pandemonium I mean people shouting and screaming and hollering over the building amen and I didn't know what was happening but sister first turned to look like this and that wind had taken them posters off of the wall [Applause] [Applause] the power of Jesus to righteousness again you see I tell you friend there's got to be an emphasis to this it's got to be in Ephesians 2 this word the prophet of God said these books has been sealed up for years but the Seventh Seal has opened up now it's open to us a new land it's opened us to a land the prophet of God said there must come and Ephesians 2 this an understanding of the book this is the age were in do you see this is the time when the church is coming in understanding now listen the last days the prophet of God said we are given an understanding now in the adoption the man says it like this I feel at this time then it's good to bring the church to a complete understanding positionally of who they are I think it's time we said for the church to come to complete understanding it's been a partial understanding the whole time but it's time to complete this thing it's time for the church to recognize you won't Bible prophecy I'll give it to you John 14 and 20 in that day you shall know not this not wonder not maybe but you shall know the father is in me and I in you and you and me that's what Jesus predicted in the last days that's why Paul said in Ephesians they meant pray that that God would open the eyes of our understanding Amen that we might be able to see but they stopped arise that vindicated word that the life of every heart and brings light into the vision of the Bride of Christ my to think tonight if we could just know who we are if the church can find out who they are they know what bless them loans to them they know what land belongs to them hey man need to think that it was under Joshua that the anointing came in inspiration and put every one of them in their position the message anointing will place you in the body accordingly to what God has saw you before the world began now if you can see clearly who you are then you'll know that when the troubles come the troubles have nothing to do with who you are and when a slave it after Samuel a prophet a prophet identify him as a king David did not make himself King a prophetic anointing made him King come on church David had oil pulled over David did not choose himself David did not ask to be King David was the last man they wanted to be king amen but God made David come he wouldn't let Samuel anoint nobody else he wouldn't let him prophesy over nobody else Samuel tronic his father wanted it done when God's withheld the blessing until David come really anointed David's well I'll tell you it was just a prophet speaking over a man was it the Bible said the fear of the Lord departed not from him from that day forward it was not an empty ceremony it was a prophetic word setting an order of redemption that one day there would be a bride who would be the eighth child amen in the Church of the Living God and she would be outside the church she wouldn't be in the church profit would have to say we tried seven ages but we couldn't annoyed none of them is that one more that's gotta be a prize somewhere churches churches price rise that's gotta be one it's gotta be a church somewhere this message can be poured out I pulled the Church of the Living God hey that's where we're coming to today that there's a prophetic anointing that's been placed upon the Church of the Living God you didn't ask for it you wasn't able to choose it yourself but God poured it on you brother amen and that is the power that it's working in our beans tonight now the prophet of God said God has had this all the time but he's been holding it he's been holding it think of it God has been holding this anointing he's been holding this great revelation how long's God been holding it now according to scriptures he's been holding it since the days of Adam the prophet of God said why's he been holding it he's been waiting to give his secret and fool he meant to fully so somebody can fully comprehend it he was waiting not only to give an understanding but of people he could give the understanding to now think of this because if you're high I mean is there any house builders in the house tonight any carpenters here Amen can you imagine describing to a three-year-old the pitch of the roof Amen I'm 45 and don't understand it yet can you imagine trying to break down amen how to put the foundation in and run the rebar to a three-year-old Amen you're wasting your breath they can't understand because the level of maturity is not there yet amen and the Church of the Living God Paul said it's not ready for the meat but there would be a sea can come that's right and this is the season of understanding this is a season of God releasing a comprehension upon the church that this is what has been in his mind the whole time the whole time God has had something in his mind a bride now notice this the property of God said of course he separated us and opened this new land to us this land that has been opened to the church is the Word of God is opened it's been opened for us to move into this land was not opened just to talk about it was a land open to go into if you go back in the days of this America when they first landed amen and and the men and women who come from Europe was escaping the presence of European ideas and the religions and they come to America for the basis of freedom of religion but there was a spirit that got upon them but they later in the history books call it manifest destiny and the people who landed on the rock didn't just camp around Plymouth Rock but it wasn't long they started moving towards the Mississippi River and there was something that possessed me to face every kind of hazard every kind of rugged land and rugged life people lost their families they become sick they meant what was they doing trying to reach the west coast amen Wow what was sets them people he mentions they meant but that was inheritance there they they knew the gold they knew the opportunity they knew of the taste of freedom they understood there was something worth the cost that they were paying amen they lost a lot but they gained everything he meant because it was in the west coast that the spirit had already prophesied at the same sign that was in the East was gonna come in the West and that West Coast had to have a place apart you'll know 1906 is where as Susur Street was on the west coast come on the Holy Ghost couldn't have come there amen unless there would have been a city of sadness and somebody knocked out the wilderness and build a city Amen that mr. Seymour can hold a revival on the sues the street and the Holy Ghost could feel every one of them somebody went before you to prepare a place for a season of the fulfillment of Joel the second chapter and that's the second chapter oh come on church you ain't hearing me somebody had to go out there and do that amen and pinnacles had to happen before somebody can open this word before these seals could come open now when those seals come open and I don't believe you already have to get to the first little page of the seals in camp right there I don't believe you ought to read that God sent a prophet and camp right there I personally I don't believe that we ought to just read there's nine spiritual gifts in the church in camp right there amen but I believe there's a land to possess I believe that's a land that's rich with milk and honey there's a land with grapes and abundance and treasures beyond the imagination resources that man hasn't even thought of yet ours that the church st. even realized yes the public of God said they would come a time in the church that limbs would grow out a mint that they wouldn't appear by the spoken word y'all recognize what season we're living in [Applause] Amen do you recognize it won't be a service different than this one it won't be a service different than this one I mean I've seen a woman a man sitting about where you are in a meeting one night and cancer dropped off of a man's body just like that what it was the same atmosphere we're in right now he was in a different service it wasn't a different anointing it wasn't a different speaker it was a different place but it was the same anointing the same word the same way you don't have to go to a special place you don't have to go to a special room somewhere in that little room it's the opening of the word and brings a tabernacle right in the church now these seals have opened up the time for the church to move on amen look we're not laying again the principles and foundations this one's going to perfection you ain't stopping short you're going to perfection the thing that stopped every age is out of the way you don't think them Pentecostals would have did it brother if them seals wouldn't have been over would have been open all do you think them Lutheran's they fasted and prayed for what you got amen but God started you were they stopped come on God started to when they stopped he meant the man that landed on Plymouth Rock did not build Los Angeles remember somebody started where he stopped and somebody else started where he stopped in the Church of the Living God this bride has started where the Pentecostals have stopped amen we are not a Pentecostal we are the first born experts of the Living God we are Christians to lie we are not some Presbyterians and Catholics and Romans we are the sons and daughters of the old magic God under an Avon hemic covenant we are all one in Christ Jesus and you gotta admit this is a special age you have to admit that nobody ever lived in a time like this why because it was in Daniel then you'll still up the book and shut it until when the time of the end out of the time of the end being knowledge shall increase and them that believe their God shall do exploits is that right in the same time of knowledge it's the same time as a great faith that will move in the church now that tells me two trees are gonna bloom at the same time as Jesus said in the days when you see the fig tree Israel putting forth its bud but if you read the book of Luke it said fig tree and all other trees all other trees Billy Graham brought the badness treat of fruit all Roberts brought the crispy church to fruit Amen somebody amen must bring the bride to fruit it's rapture time it's fruit time for the Church of the Living God now back to trees of course if you look at the Tree of Life and the tree of knowledge both of them was in Eden and both of them's in the scripture in the Book of Ezekiel it describes but that Satan was there as a great cherub he's the tree of knowledge which is still here amen but if it's a person that the tree of life is a person Jesus Christ and I say at 53 he said he would be a tree you wouldn't desire for its beauty it won't be a beautiful tree but it'll be a tree of life amen and in its limbs you will find everything that you have need us but being a tree it has grown unto adoption season or should I say fruit season amen and when is that's when the tree shows forth its life it's been a tree the whole time you go out here in the trees or all right right here all the time but a certain season them trees blew and the tree gives our fruit and you know a mint you'll know an orange tree from a pear tree in the time of its fruit it's when those who walking by it can pick and live by the existence of the life of that season my to think that God who always was becomes in a way that people now are picking the fruit to live from that tree now of course there's actually two trees laying there so both of them it's trees of life and tree of knowledge now the thing is the scientific world and men is almost out doing you they are climbing the tree of knowledge at such a rapid expansion until that they have just just in my lifetime brother amen do you know that there was the time I remember no microwave ovens but there's some young people in here has no clue what it means does not have a microwave I remember when there was no Atari most people in here that Atari is an ancient history lesson and they moved on to Xbox and Playstation and now they're probably some I never heard of come on there's people in here that never knew what it was to not have a cell phone I was a traveling preacher that had to stop on the side of the road and couple somebody on the payphone you know what it sounds like to dial a phone oh wait no nothing that I there's people in here that don't know what that is they don't even know we had somebody does that keep remember who it was I better be careful but they didn't even know how to open the cassette tape couldn't figure out how to open the box they didn't know what a cassette tape blahs amen most of them don't even know what CDs are now in the advance Mitch come on now and when my granddaddy died at 53 year old with a massive heart attack heart disease my mother at 70 the other day got a heart got it got a new vowel in her heart took him a couple hours if my granddad would be living now he would have got his heart fixed and lived a long life because medical science has advanced until they can take your heart out and put it in somebody else and make that person live Medical Sciences went beyond amen natural sciences wouldn't be on and then technology has come to the place where you can sit here and talk a video call to somebody on the other side of the world when I was a little kid and then I'd watch George Jetson Zinn on Saturday morning can I be real with y'all okay I was a little boy and brother Jack I climb up on my mom's couch and eat Lucky Charms and my favorite sir and I'd eat Lucky Charms amen and I'd be in my underwear that's all just setting them on to eight or nine year old little boy Connor and I'll be watching George Jetson amen and you know what they do George Jetson they would have a phone call on there and it would be one of those video calls and I laughing took my brother I'm glad we ain't got that telephone cuz I'm said to mind we're eating material if the phone would ring amen and what I thought was a craziest thing that ever was today I was in India the other day and in the middle of the night called my wife and there she was and that was my dog and my kids and they were talking back and forth I tell you Amen civilization and science amen have climbed the tree of knowledge until they're tapping into things that man did not know existed 40 years ago but right now it's a reality it's not somebody say more Sunday we're gonna have these things you can Katherine your pocket brother we got them right now and the little generation don't have to be taught how to use from it that's funny your five-year-old can do more with your phone than you can you know why they don't fear it they don't fear it they're not scared to pick it up and use it [Music] maybe you never heard of the message of the hour but you never heard of a cellphone either but you're using it today and then that's not scared of it will be proficient with it and find the necessities of the Mason part hey do you see Medical Sciences moving there try Amanda tree of knowledge they didn't get on one limb and stay there the whole time they didn't find out about about medical science about hearts and just stay right there but when they went over in the Roddick's of the brain they found out things about the heart amen on that Liam they begin to understand things it was questions and the higher they get things that were great questions forty years ago it's simple answers to great children right now listen the Church of the Living God can learn from this we cannot hear boy Liam a predestination and stay there the rest of our lives amen we're not on the Liam we're on the tree and we got to keep climbing up that tree we got to keep moving up that tree come on church don't tell me that you can't go on this tree you're serving a god that don't have a limit the only limit God's gots the one you put on me here's an unlimited God now the prophet of God said we have untapped resources and which is not limited but unlimited one thing for me to give you a phone say it's not limited it's another thing for me to say to you it's unlimited in other words it's not just that I'm not putting a limit on you there's no limit on it I'm giving your cell phone say look look your unlimited here there's no limit you can use the phone as much as you want hey man that means at some point you're wondering is this gonna cost you money hey man am I gonna run out of gigs and banner I'm saying to you there's no limit to the church no sir they nothing like the God that we serve hey man you see this God who is unlimited it's an unlimited science it's an unlimited God to think that we can go above our senses we can go above our abilities we can buy fly above a sense bound existence because we have untapped resources the resources you ain't you ain't found out about yet exists there it meant to be idea that you're gonna run out it's like a like a little fish in this big ocean but says I better drink sparingly because after a while you'll run out of water it's like a mouse and the Gardiners of Egypt saying I better eat only a few grains because tomorrow they might not be any bat mouse in his lifetime could not eat the grains and Joseph's garnished and the lifetime of fish he cannot drink all the waters in the ocean and you will never find the limits of God in this life I don't care what he's done today he'll do more tomorrow amen and it's not behind you it's in front of you you don't have to climb back down the tree to get it but same God that did it back there I'll do it up here now untapped resources gonna come maybe say it like this I mean y'all got a wall when I seen it passing coming this way down toward the Amen what would I said what would y'all say if I said on the way over here I stopped and wrote a check for everything in that Walmart down there a dinner by my hotel room I bought the story I bought everything in and I paid a price the whole thing is bought and paid for it now what I want y'all to do is go down and get what you want amen anything you can carry out is your personal possession it all belongs to you but it's not yours till you go get it all the TVs is yours all the guns is yours all the cash is yours all it's all yours but you've got to go get it now what if you get down there and somebody was at the door and say look hey man it's the wrong season no no that God just now did it you could have told me that yesterday but not today yesterday that was true I had motives but today no it's not true listen sir this is my season the man invited me to get all I could get now if you've been in Walmart you go in Walmart you you mean half the church in there most of the time I don't know if it's like it here but back where I come from an Arkansas that was a social gathering you go didn't matter when you win it was always there you know and when you first walk in Walmart you know all the all the stationaries there and the comic books and there's the pencils then there's the deodorant and there's the truth paste and all the things all the cheap stuff it's up front yep it's time way all the cheap stuffs away from the door they got the good stuff in the back the computers in the back of that store we're a long ways from the door you know what people do they'll come in and I've seen to her times will get right in the front door and meet somebody with stand right there and talk half a day amen and we never make it they meant but you've got to understand as a church and when a prophet brought us in the front door he brought us in there and said look this is all y'all's this this belongs to you get your possession it's both paid for and gave me the receipt for it but he said but you got to go get it yourself all God can do is buy it you got to go get it you got to get a man now let me ask you a men if they had that they had that big screen Apple computer you've been long and a half and it was up on the top shelf and you knew that baby was yours would you find a way to get it you maybe you can't reach it but you're gonna find to reach it you're gonna get a ladder to get up there and get it amen because it's out of your reach but it belongs to you listen Church there are promises that's in this Bible that you have been at the front door of the word but there's things that belong to you but you gotta keep going in you got a progressive Amen the things you're looking for it's past the front door it's on the other side you know belongs to you everything belongs to you it's already bought and paid for I'll tell you what a prophet said every dipped a blessing that Christ died for is already yours the devil is only trying to bluff you out of possessing it that's right amen I wondered one time where the receipt was but in Isaiah 53 and 5 the Bible said he was wounded for our transgressions you know what that means he meant your transgressions they've been paid for you know that's pretty powerful to me that our transgressions have been people I want you to tell somebody they're paid for he was bruised for our iniquities a mentality the thing that's keeping you from believing you can possess the promise the Bible said he was bruised for our iniquity your iniquity has been paid for I want you to tell somebody gets paid for they know you got iniquity but they might not know it's paid for so tell them it's paid for [Music] [Applause] blessed is the man who God whoa Kelly see pay for bait by the righteous flood of Jesus Christ he paid a debt I could not pay he paid for the chastisement of our peace was upon him pay for the stripes by his stripes we are healed my healing paid for that's right if you believe it tonight the prophet of God said some of these things might be out of your reach but all you need to do is get a ladder and climb up get that's right it belongs to you anyhow it's time to move on it's time for the church to go into the unlimited power that God has give them to you Yemenite I want to shock you have you got some seat belts I want you shocked you just a minute man is omnipotent now that means all-powerful using the same word the Bible tells us that God is whole impotent but God included you in Olympians when he said whatsoever thing you say we can have it if you desire it he gave you all power now listen I don't want to argue the point but let's just make it clear you tell me what weak spot is there in God is there a weak place in God then if any God is in you then all power is in you it's not coming it's in you the Holy Ghost is the power that lives in the church that if the Holy Ghost is in you the same God that created the earth is in you right now then this makes in omnipotence coming to the church amen if an omnipotent is in a believer and an omnipotent God comes and meets the believer to omnipotence our coming together amen and when our nipa tense comes together the miraculous begins to happen to think tonight that miracles are right in front of the church if they can understand perfectly who they are by the blood of Jesus Christ not by your abilities not by what you have done but by the blood and the blood has spoken prophetic words over your life and made you what you are by his doing now he that had begun work is able to perform that which he has begun amen God's have finished your church God didn't start this without finishing it but Malachi 4 is the finisher according to revelation Stan this is a finishing anointing when God will finish the church by tapping the church off with a token of himself now to think of this then this brings a perfect faith to an omnipotent people making them the master of every situation so by the weighing that can't be me that's what's wrong right now that can't be me but you have been a called according to this purpose that God would have a church that is omnipotent in its power to think tonight that there are places that we have not yet went that is available to us there are things that we could have that we have not yet touched but they are resources been bought and paid for through the blood of Jesus Christ see you gotta have faith in what you're doing and if you know what you're doing by revelation you have a circumstance that you can control because you become the master of it now I don't know if you realize this but the Bible isn't finished I know most people think it is but the Bible there's one book in the Bible that's not finished and that is the book of Acts amen if God ever has another church it will be a continuation of the book of Acts because the acts of the Holy Spirit would act in the church all the way until the end of time to think tonight there's a branch a branch of the Lord on this great tree now the origin of the church is masters masters of every circumstance now I know you think you're weak but Jesus come to your weak flesh starve himself in fasting until he brought the flesh in its weakest condition so deity in the weakness of flesh in the weakness of that flesh used the word only to overcome his greatest enemy now you gotta you gotta ask yourself why with the Lord only used the word because listen he withheld power to show you power listen put it to you like this not everybody that was going to stand against the devil would have been the fullness of the godhead bill and bodily so if the fullness of the Godhead dwell in bodily defeated Satan with some great supernatural power then it would have been every one of us looking for that supernatural power to defeat our enemy but Jesus the greatest of all powers reserved power and overcome the devil by saying it is written but it's not what you're overcoming it's how you're overcoming the church is overcoming by the word then when the church is coming into the word it's the greatest anointing they can receive is the word after the Lord my to think as the church is moving forward then they're moving forward in power now now listen I know that we have tongues in the church and we've seen gifts from the church but tongues is not a stopping place it was a starting place gifts what's not a stopping place it was a starting place but the Church of the Living God is moving far beyond just a gift they have received a giver and a translation anointing that will change their body not belittling the gifts they're a part of the body but it was where you started not where you stopped to think that God has given the church tonight untapped resources now to think your doctor is limited but God is not your abilities are limited but God is not do you see that God has given the church something now and you can go over and you can watch the Joshua and Caleb went over in the land they picked the grapes up and they come back amen and we talk about the grapes of the land but at some point we've got to realize that we own the land the grapes come out of us and people talk about the gifts I love the gifts but we own the land that gifts come out up we don't have a cluster of grapes brother we own the vineyards we don't just work in the fields our house is the house on the hill right middle attitude toward every word of God will bring it to pass that's right let's just take a look you gotta check sign it fill it out hey man do you see we are now sons of God listen I I know that you know this but let me tell you if you don't know it you are right now sons not you're going to be sons not much someday we're gonna be sons but the prophet of God said now we are the sons of God listen people saw a runaway Sunday in the Millennium we're gonna have great things we don't need miracles in the Millennium we don't need spoken word powers in the Millennium we're gonna have immortal bodies the devil will be bound a thousand years we won't need something to fight the devil he will be there fighting us but tonight we need the power tonight we need the supernatural tonight we need the grace of God amen what we really need is some preachers to call it present tense what we need is some anointed men and daughters of God to call these promises right now that we some at some point we have to quit putting this in the future and believe that this is ours but this is our promise this is what God gave us listen friends if you could catch the revelation tonight this is a present tense truth now something has to unlock this door Jesus is the doors that write everything on the other side of that door belongs to you if the doors locked faith is the key faith is the key to the door once the doors open it's all yours now the thing about the thing about a key is a key works on the door you know sometimes I'm out of town a lot and sometimes if I got a good friend coming by you know I'll leave a key by the door do you know that key is to that door but it don't really matter if Nathan if Nathan comes by he don't live there but if Nathan comes by I say there's a key under the mat do you know that key will work in his hand he can hand that key to his three-year-old to one and a half now somebody might have to lift her up but if her little hand could get ahold of that key it would work the same for her it does for me to get these promises [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we are everything that God's got for you the door of Jesus Christ if you can't believe it all things are possible somebody's put this in your hand I'm on Church when this word opened up it was a sword of the word the third pool hey will it work absolutely in a prophets hand you bet it will amen but the Prophet gave the sword to the church I read my Bible same as you do revelations of fifth chapter John nobody's worthy nobody can take the book but after the seventh verse of the tenth chapter something happened because the same boy says said you can't have it John after the seventh verse said come and take it John a meant something changed a prophetic word was given to the church but annoying you to take this book don't know tell me hey man do you see said come and take the book out of the hands of the angel don't tell me he was talking about a Bible probably God said we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new book we need a revelation the one we got what was John coming to get the revelation he was receiving the revelation of the word that had been lost but it's restored tonight under the message of the hour listen church if this if this message of the hour can only declare to you that Christ is here listen amen a present in truth Christ is here the prophet of God said my ministry is to declare him he is here the headship is here think about it but the word has brought him here if he is here abundance is here power is here Joe said bet you bet your floors she'll be full of wheat and your vats she'll be full of all don't sound like a famine to me don't sound like a fan sounds like your floors will be full of wheat and your vats will be full of all where's it coming from brother it's Elijah's anointing every time Elijah showed up there was an abundance come on and what's always abundance under that man ever said abundance of all habits abundance of meal it was an abundance of angels that was abundance of the grace of God that was an abundance of rain and the Church of the Living God has heard the sounds of the abundance of rain now now friends if that abundance has been brought to the church I believe tonight then it's time for the church to wake up I think it's time to wake up and realize what you're dealing with two to two lepers were at the gates of see remembers they were at the gates of Syria and they were dying than the gates and there was a famine going on in Syria and it was a great army so if they went in they'd started in if I went that way they'd die from the Army and they sent they're dying in the gates they said there's stagnant dying in the gates but one morning they woke up to Inspiration amen little did they know that over in Samaria the night before Elijah and Elijah had prophesied by this time tomorrow by this time tomorrow there will be abundance of food where there has been a shortage amen and the men woke up the next morning not even knowing the prophecy was there but the inspiration of that prophecy fell upon them as the Sun rose up they said why sit here till we die let us go out what the battle looks like and when they got out there they found that the whole army had moved off in the night and the entire camp belonged to two men they had unlimited resources they had more food than they can eat they had more things and they could carry you gotta come in here we tonight this message will give you something brother this is not just a come and go message you might come in week but you're gonna leave strong let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich don't sit and I don't sit in the same place and worry about what's gonna happen forget what it was let's go home to the promises of God and let the word of the Lord poured through the Church of the Living God this is the generation for it to happen this is the generation for it to take place listen I know sometimes I get to preaching like this he was what's the matter with him what's the matter that guy he preach some promises and how the power of God's feeling the church and all these things does he not see the trouble listen brother I see everything you seen but I choose not to look at it I see everything you see but I'm of another stock I am of the seed of Abraham that said everything that was contrary to the Word of God was alive amen when David had an army before him God didn't let David look at the army he said look at the mulberry tree brother it's time for the church person anointing upon the Church of the Living God that'll change us brother listen I learned a lot from leaders in this country and I don't want to I don't want to scare you remember I I listen to some of the the early the early movement leaders and how they influenced and what they did and you know what they meant something about them man they knew something was ahead of them and they was unstoppably because they caught a little glimpse of the future and I want you to know tonight but there's a bride amen there's a bride that is unstoppable there is a bride on this earth today listen brother if the devil couldn't stop David Wicca life if the Amalekites couldn't stop Moses in the valley if the Red Sea couldn't hold him if they row couldn't hold him if the Jordan couldn't hold Joshua if the walls of Jericho could not hold the children of God out of the promise what makes you fake the devil that's something that can hold this bride out of the promises of God in this thing couldn't stop David and then gonna stop you they couldn't stop Joshua and they ain't gonna stop you couldn't stop Moses and you ain't gonna stop you I want you to know he couldn't stop Rahab and he ain't gonna stop you [Applause] because she's unstoppable do you recognize somebody wrapped a cord around you they were they they threw something around you called prophecy it's an absolute it's a tie post and you're not just holding on to it it's tied to you and God is pulling the cords of prophecy and there ain't nothin there ain't nothin can hold those prophecies from fulfilling themselves when they begin to manifest their an unstoppable presence it's an unstoppable annoy it's called your destiny and there ain't nothing could keep you out of that listen amen hit me hit me hit me like thinking somehow that you could stop the Sun from rising it would be easier to stop the Sun than stop this right [Applause] jesus said heavens and earth can pass away but my word it shall never fail but first last two priests went bail but the second one is rising up there's a bride rising on the scene by the anointing of God Sheen holding herself up but there's an anointing resting on her an unstoppable anointing you know the problem rather you know the real problem is we're letting the devil do it we're letting the devil ride it's like riding your bicycle and then you write it in the sand you're gonna pull the back in the sand you're still riding but you ain't going nowhere you're still riding but it's hard it's like trying to run a race with a man riding on your back you're still running but you ain't running fast you're still running but chain running far and you're doing something Amen with a lot of work it don't have to be that hard you know go Jack Lord showed me something one day I was preaching and just come in my mind that people is actually given the devil a ride people are actually giving the devil a ride you know if you have ever y'all ever play a war with somebody on your back let somebody on your back you play chicken and play war when I was a kid we used to do it is easier than the swimming pool but but we should because it's long fall on the ground you should let people jump on her back but you know if if somebody's on your back it's hard to move around but do you see what happens is we let the devil get on us and then we carrying the church [Music] and sometimes he's a heavy devil and you can't worship because you got your arms wrapped around hold that thing and you can't jump high cause you're way too much but you're carrying that down you carry that thing in the church and you can't hear good you can't shout you can't rejoice we can't enjoy God cuz you're the one can you know I don't know about you but but if you ever get sick of playing that game all you really have to do is stand up it's to stand up I tell you right now you're just stand up and pull your shoulders back and say devil get your own ride home devil get y'all ride home you've rolled before enough oh there's the presence of God resting in the Church of the it's an untapped resource brother that's what we ran tonight let the musicians come it's an untapped resources tonight that's where we're standing it's an untapped resource it's yours it's yours for the taking [Music] [Applause] I'm still here devil I'm still here but I'm still here it's been war but I'm still here it's been a great challenge but I'm still here Satan you're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ glory of God hey the Church of the Living God is rising up 19 you can do all things through Christ many some some harebrained idea I got let's prophesy brother that's not an almanac that's the Bible you are now sons you are more than conquerors you are more than able through Christ we can do all things if you say under this mountain Amen how much greater than if you say to that devil it's enough brother I don't know about you but you can push me far enough and that's enough you can push me far enough but I'm a gentleman but there is a limit push me too far and I'll say that's enough and sometime another you're gonna get a left and you're gonna push back listen brightest pushing back time every time you go to get it the devil pushes you back every time you go to the back you go to the back back up with them expensive computers are now you can't have it because you did this them because that happened and this is situation some time or another you're gonna tell that devil I hate to say it like this but we used to have a say and speak to the hand sometime another you're gonna tell that devil speak to the blood if you've got a problem with me speak to my daddy you got a problem me speak to my big brother the devil ain't scared of me and I know that but he is scared of my big brother I grew up the house was four of us boys my oldest brother was meaning to it was really meaning and that one was really me and I was in seventh grade and I think he was like tenth or eleventh grade and then I went into gym brother Jack I was out there playing basketball man I was who hears 13 I was four foot you come here man I was about this guy's size right here you about four foot ten he's probably he's probably seven year old I was 14 13 and I was about that guy's size right there and it was a guy in that gymnasium as big as you and you know he was a bully he'd take the basketballs and he catch me not looking he told that ball crossed the court and hit me in the head with it man that hurt and I had a temper like a buzz saw but I looked at that guy and I knew he's going to kill me if I jump on him so the next day was in there and again he couldn't that ball hit me in the head and I thought man I want to get him so bad but he's gonna kill me when I do that but I just happened to look up and I see my big brother was in the gym brother I took off running after that guy like I was gonna killing and you know what he did he didn't stay in the fight he took off but I knew he wasn't running for me I knew he knew my big brother was in the house he'll tell you you've got a ride tonight to tell that devil to get out of here Jesus is in the house untappd it's belongs to your church it belongs cheese and I tell the devil to get his own ride home he belongs to get belongs to a man bull Jack come sing us a song tonight I feel like worshiping the Lord I think it's time don't you I think it's time you tell that devil devil it's enough if you're a banker lied to you every time you talk would you bank with him if you're nobody wants a straight arm hope nobody's allowed you know they if your doctor lied to you every time you talk to it would you want him to be your doctor the devil lies to you every time you talk to him why would you listen to him it's enough we're now sons this is our ground belongs to us Wayne was just talking about sometimes you just get enough right if you've been pushed you want to push back and was just kind of thinking on two different occasions one was I believe it's a dream that the Prophet had and how he said there was a man that looked like his father in a dream and he was taking this this three corner stick man which was Trinitarian teaching and he was striking this woman amen in the dream that looked like his mama they say that man had big muscles and it just say say every time he was just kind of hit and hit the woman and and you know every time she drives up to do something he would just rise up and hit him you know and he got to a point he said you know I'm just kind of got tired of seeing this man hit my mama like that right and it says you know I he said I finally got some strength and I looked at the man sitting up next time you hit him you gonna have to deal with me and they say so they said never seemed like his strength got bigger and his muscles got bigger and the man got weaker and so what we got to get to the point they man where we begin to speak back to the devil and the thing that you were running from now you chase it that that's where we go nice easy say he say he said if the devil say boo come on you you got to give the devil a boo back come on somebody give the Lord a hand of praise come on everybody say that [Music] my god I'm surrounded [Music] now this is how I fight my reason apart it is how I fight everybody this is how I fight my I use a word of dumb [Music] around [Music] [Music] we [Music] come on somebody raise it huh [Music] this is how a fight [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my god Dwayne was telling us that when Jesus was in his trial three trials of Matthew or he withheld supernatural power show us true power right when you leave these meetings all you have to do is take what others giving you overcome the enemy they may walk in your authority as a son and as a boarder the comment is that all right we had a chosen generation dauber to show his answer let's

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] some people that don't want those acts to pentecostal shouting babies and all I'm dancing like that listen to you all sing that I can just imagine the fry actually worshiping and praising God on the other side because he told us a story a lot of people thought it was just a story but he was saying something without Saints told us a little story about a boy living in the country and you've never seen some things for people living in the city and one day his mama and his daddy decided to go visit a relative that was in the city when they went to the city a man the boy was in the house it was kind of looking around and seeing a lot of I've never seen him and as mama a team up stairs of course I want to go upstairs and see mommy and daddy and see auntie and uncle along with that and as the boy began to walk up the steps he got all the way to the top and he saw some committee never seen before and as he stood up there at the top of the stairs he he did like this when they did like that the thinking on the opposite side of him did the same thing then he did like this and the thing on the opposite side did the same thing and then he did like this and the thing on the opposite side did the same thing see when when one man says hey man the next man says and when the next man says and the next man says and you got double the power of a man [Applause] [Music] [Music] never live in the country I never seen nothing like this but mama that's me I believe the profit is it's probably smiling because he got some people on nerve that recognized as the word is preached that's me and when we get a revelation of who we are then we can work so we can say Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if you want something tomorrow brother let's go
