sound we find ourselves in the last month of the year and if it had not been the grace of god if it had not not been the grace of god we would not have been here today we can testify that god has been good he's been better than good so we thank him this morning and wherever you are as our brother said create an atmosphere enter into his gates with thanksgiving and enter into his courts with praise because we come to worship the lord we come to give the lord thanks and praise and glory and honor so with all the with all that being said we we thank everyone that is tuning in we pray that the lord uh has already blessed your heart this morning with everything that's been said and now we we come to hear the greater portion of the service that is the breaking forth of his bread to feed on the tree of life so let us just bow in a quick word of prayer father we thank you lord god that you've been gracious to us throughout the year father you've been faithful you've proven yourself to be good and worthy and father we can come here lord and and give thanks to you father to praise you lord because of how good you've been father god we don't need to look at our reality but we just need to look at your word but you've been faithful to every word lord and if that's where we take our stance father then who can be against us for the word lord is who we are you have spoken it father and we believe it and father god i pray that you'll remember every need this morning everybody that's hurting lord every situation that needs comfort and peace father we pray this morning lord that you would be the one to provide that peace father you would be the one to provide that comfort that strength father god that restoration that some of us need this morning lord restoration in our bodies restoration in our families father god we count on you this morning to provide that and oh father god i we pray as we heard the request this morning for our precious brother uh pastor blue lord and his wife father god has gone home and god what a warrior lord that has gone home to receive her reward father she's fought the good fight of faith lord and father we all have that appointment and god we're longing for it father me you bring peace and comfort to the family lord god oh father we honor you this morning lord that you have your way father that god you would be the one to speak you'll be the one to anoint the voice in the hearts that will receive your word lord father we thank you god and we give all the glory into your name in jesus christ we pray amen thank you god bless you everyone i am very excited to be here with you this morning um i can't thank god enough for this year despite of everything the spite of the major trials this world has undergone god has been faithful to his word to his bride and we're so grateful to be here this morning uh we're going to turn into a scripture this morning we're going to start in the book of romans chapter 8. and i just as we turn into that scripture romans chapter 8 verse 12. this is where we begin i just want to remind everyone that uh you know just before um we were faced with such a battle when we had to revert to streaming our services primarily we had such a mighty time in the presence of the lord god did some mighty things here and the enemy didn't like that and and i'm i'm under expectation when we uh when we all can assemble the bible says forsake not the assembling of the saints when we can gather together uh everyone bringing their fire i'm just under expectation uh that we're gonna see a mighty move of god and and even now we can expect that to be taking place so we thank the lord and and may everyone come with their shouting voice may everyone come with their praise so we'll read at the 12th verse of romans so it it starts by saying therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye after the flesh ye if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we might may be also glorified together and i'm also going to turn to another scripture matthew chapter 5 verse 48 a short verse there and it reads be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you may have your seats i trust you are standing for the reading of the lord god bless you so if i could use as a title this morning it would be heirs of his perfection and the scripture says jesus now is speaking to us telling us uh as a commandment be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect right now god requires perfection that's the only thing and only way a believer today is going to be found before god it's by perfection uh but before i go any further i want to go back to romans chapter 8 and i want to read that verse again i want to go back to i want to go back to verse 13 right it says for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live and that word mortify i want to stress on that a little bit because that word mortified means to subdue it means to suppress to control to a punish and is saying if we can mortify the deeds of the body he shall live so whatever you're going through this morning whatever the your body is is is manifesting if you through the spirit mortified the deeds of that body you shall live right and to mortified through the spirit is the possession of man it's the possession of the believer right now if we keep going it says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and i like this here for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear now we're gonna hold on there whatever you're going through this morning for ye have not received a bonded the spirit of bondage again to fear that means there was a time you were in bondage there was a time where your situation had dominion over you there was a time where bondage was had rulership over you but now it's saying ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received a spirit of adoption right and that spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father now sometimes the lord is going to place you in situations for you to cry out to god and if we could just go to the story of samson very quickly sampson was put into a situation that he should have never been a part of but in the midst of it he was put in a place where he had to cry out to god and in judges chapter 16 will turn there very quickly judges chapter 16 we'll start at the um we'll start at the 26th verse now it says and simpson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them now the house was full of man and woman and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that beheld while samson made sport now they were taking pleasure in samson's bondage they were taking a joy and seeing samson in the condition he was in but samson called unto the lord samson made the lord his pursuit and it goes on to say oh lord remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may be at once avenge of the philistines for my two eyes and the story goes on and saying samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood in which it was born born up of the one with his right hand in the other with his left hand and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bound himself with all his might in the house of uh fell upon the lord's and upon the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life and and you see when you're going through something and you can make the lord your pursuit god will allow you to have victory over your trials and when the scripture goes to say you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption god wants you to be elevated god wants you to be higher god wants you to be more than you were yesterday that's the god that we serve and i want to take another example first samuel chapter 30. and i like this here because we see david he left his camp he left his place and he he journeyed elsewhere and he missed while he was gone the enemy came in and devoured his place the enemy came and and and complete the destruction and not only that but the enemy took captive of what david possessed but we'll start at the ver this is first samuel chapter 30. and we'll start at the first verse now it says and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smit and ziklag and burned it with fire and had and had taken the woman captives that there that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way now it goes on and we'll jump to verse um six it says and david was greatly distressed for the people's sake for the speak people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people were grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god and whatever you're going through sometimes you're going to have to encourage yourself in the lord and encouraging yourself in the lord is bowing down on your knees praying to god and god himself will remind you of the things he's already promised now and what david was going through in verse 8 the scripture says in david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after hit this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all and i like this because god already knows the end of your enemies and and not only does he know the end of your enemies but god is also at your finish line and because god is at your finish line god is waiting for you to get there god is waiting for you to get to where he is because the only way you're going gonna get to where god is is by the word through the word right by pursuing and crying of the lord so when you find yourself in a trial in a situation and your body is not coming to the uh your confession inquire of the lord because the lord has already made a way and this thought came to me god typically when you go when you're racing and running a course you're running to the finish line but as a believer you're not running to the finish line you're running back to the finish line because you already made it right and god the finish line represents the seed the seed of god the seed meaning the beginning and the scripture says the sea will reproduce after its own kind and if you are of the seed of god you will whip that seed from the very beginning and we'll jump towards we'll jump to the same chapter and because david inquired of the lord verse 17 it says and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and their escape not a man of them save 400 young man which wrote upon camels and fled and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two daughters and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor anything that had taken to them david recovered all and if you want to make this personal you can put your name there and say brother jack recovered all brother troy recovered all brother simba recovered all sister rachel recovered all right and that's the report that we can expect of god when we pursue him and we're in the choir of the lord and i'm going to continue here and now the scripture says to be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven which which is in heaven is perfect now the prophet says here in the message speak to this mountain now it says i want to now i want to get just for a moment the infallibility of the word see to you first i want you to know that god is infinite he's so perfect that he knew everything that ever would be you believe that he knew that before the world was ever created that we'd be sitting here tonight if he's infinite if he isn't infinite then he isn't god so he is finite he's like we are but infinite there's no way to explain it and whatever god says is perfect he cannot improve it or take it back it's perfect because god is perfect and his words are perfect his promises can never fail now you must have that kind of faith in god when you read the bible to believe his promises the reason why we must have that kind of faith today is because we don't live by trials we live by god's promises and it goes on the prophet goes on to say you must remember he's perfect his words are perfect they can never fail they can never be improved they are perfect to start with now god is perfect which is why god requires perfection and god's perfection is what what is god's perfection how can a man be perfect we are a million miles away from perfect our nature is imperfect and if it's up to us we'll never be able to fulfill that expectation that god wants us to be perfect but there's a reason why god jesus can say to be perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect now if we go to the beginning in genesis chapter one we'll start at the 27th verse it says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him and female created he them and god blessed them and god said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and man's purpose from the beginning was to be the very image of god but because of there was a separation from man and god god was a man when man was created man was in the image of god and what's god what's the image of god the image of god god is is certainly a spirit but the attributes of god is his father is power the attributes of god is redemption restoration and man was in the image and had dominion over everything now dominion means sovereignty over something stewardship supremacy while authority is the power to enforce rules or given orders and that's the position that man was in the beginning however man was given strict commandment to not eat of the tree of good and evil in the genesis chapter 2 verse 8 it says in the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden the tree of knowledge of good and evil also in the garden now the tree there was a tree of life and there was a tree of good and evil and because men ate of the tree they were not supposed to eat from came separation and because of that separation god if man if adam had eaten of the tree of life to begin with there would have never been a fall if if if adam and eve ate to the in a tree of life to begin with the tree of life what is it what's tree of life the spoken word the spoken word was what was the god's intention and plan for the for adam and eve and if we can go on here i want to read a quick quote now this is the message earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saint the prophet says now in that day god guarded the tree to keep them from getting it and now the swords turn right back the other way now running them right into the tree so they will receive life driving people herding them up to the tree of life and that day in the garden of eden the tree of life was salvation the tree of life was eternal life but when they ate of the tree of good and knowledge of evil it came separation it came this distress it came death complete separation from god but god the tree of life had to be the way the tree of life is god's perfection perfected way and through the tree of life is how fellowship can be restored and in the message the spoken word is the original seed the prophet said in jesus this is paragraph 145 he said in jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life to water other seeds that was coming do you see that's not even this fold i have they're going to see it they're they're going to get that word and stay right with it i'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it'll produce it just exactly it'll produce miracles it'll produce the power of god it'll produce and it will not it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed with the seed and that was god's planning that's god's plan even now is to be restored back to the tree of life the tree of life is christ and the only way a believer can come into the tree of life today is by a born-again experience in john 3 jesus goes to speak with nicodemus comes to jesus by night right and the reason nicodemus came to jesus was because he saw the miracles jesus was doing he wanted to understand miracles that was his question no man can do these miracles except god be with him now in this the way that jesus answered nicodemus nicodemus wanted to know about miracles but the only way he would understand what jesus was saying was if he became a miracle right jesus says except a man be born again of water he cannot see the kingdom of god except the man be born of water in the spirit he cannot see or enter into the kingdom of god and now nicodemus had to go through a miracle himself and a believer today through the born-again experience you're going through a miracle yourself because it's the word seed reproducing itself now being born again is a change in your nature your nature is not perfect and when you're born again through the spirit of god the nature of god himself can dwell in you and when his nature is dwelling in you you have the same authority that he has you have the same power that he has right and it's the power of the spoken word now you can be sanctified you can be given power to do such things receive that with the disciples when they went to when they were sanctified they went to go catch demons and do these different things and they came back rejoicing jesus says rejoice not because the the satan demons are subject unto you but rejoice because your your names are written in the lamb's book of life right and in matthew chapter 16 i believe that's luke 22. luke chapter 22 when it's see luke chapter 22 and the lord it's verse 31 and it says and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not and when thou art converted strengthen your brethren right peter had not been converted yet he was manifesting the miracles of god he had not been converted yet he was taking part in what the the things that god was doing right but we thank god because jesus himself prayed for peter and i can tell you today that jesus has already prayed for you whatever situation you're going through it's been prayed for you just need to believe and jesus told peter after when he's thou art converted strengthen your brethren and the important the importance of being born again is only through the word and it can't be mixed with anything else when a believer has accepted the lord jesus christ and you've been promised the baptism of the holy spirit but it has to be through the word now we he we hear many times the dispute about baptism now if a man is baptized in the father the son and the holy spirit he will not receive the baptism of the holy ghost only through the baptism of the lord jesus christ right paul he had an encounter with god and he had by revelation knew that baptism had to be through the lord jesus christ in acts chapter in next chapter 13. i'm going with paul toes tells the disciple in what manner were you baptized and what manner were you baptized because the disciples answered paul and said i was baptized unto john's rep with james brought john's baptism unto repentance but the lord but peter paul said that well you have to be baptized again in the name of the lord jesus christ and only in the name of the lord jesus christ will you receive power by the holy spirit and that power is what man what the believers are needing today to have the spoken word authority now prophet says here in a spoken word is the original see it says all this is paragraph 161 all of god's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again to the place of where ye should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of christ's death bring us right back again to where sons of god and sons of god today is the the time is working towards it everything that's going on is working towards it so the sons of god can manifest what god was and who god is today is to bring us back into the perfection so we can be heirs of what christ possess now i'm going to go to genesis 17 here it says and when abram was 19 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name be any more called abram but thy name shall be called for father abraham thy name shall be called abraham for father of many nations have i made thee and in romans chapter four verse 16 verse 13 will start there it says for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abram abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made none of none of fact but the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all his seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us unto all and that's the heirs of of perfection through faith and our faith today needs to be renewed only in the word because faith only recognizes the word faith only recognizes what god has already done and that's what we're restored to it's that faith right and i had a quote i wanted to read here but i can't find it but we're gonna we're gonna continue now abraham and all that he was going through uh um as god gave him promise and created a had a covenant with him now abraham we we understand that he wasn't a perfect man he was not a perfect man abraham lied about sarah being his wife but god didn't look at abraham at all based on what he did but who he was because god knew abraham was his seed and this is why in romans uh chapter 4 it could say in verse 20 he staggered not at the promised of god through unbelief but was strong through faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and that's what god recognizes and that's what god recognizes in a believer today god recognizes his faith because it's his faith that god has given his believer to believe the word only the believer and i wish to also read hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 for as much then as the children of our partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy the work the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not of him the nature of angels but he took of him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted right so in a situation where a believer goes through trial after trial after trial the reason why god can identify with a believer is because he's been tempted above all measure he's gone through the greatest trial that we can ever imagine and the same way that we can can't imagine his glory is the same way that we can't imagine his suffering but no way a believer can reign with christ today is by suffering with christ right and considering a rejoice a joy to be counted a a a partaker with christ in his sufferings but branham says here in the message god perfecting his church he says brothers and sisters we have it abstract this is paragraph 22 brothers and sisters we have an abstract written d tonight to salvation and divine healing and the devil has no rights trust god in the holy ghost to put him out that's all amen say i feel religious somehow i really do now notice god promised it god's obligated to take care of it and this blood cell where he formed moved into the womb covered himself over with his own creative blood bought brought forth the sun christ jesus the blood cell was broken at calvary the blood run out of his body in order that he could bring back into himself fellowship and i like what it says here the blood cell was broken at calvary and this is just the thought but the reason why the blood cell had to be broken is because it had to be distributed to the believers the blood cell broken at calvary i was able to identify what every brokenness of a believer goes through today and through our brokenness as brother quaku says we can be made a masterpiece because the blood was perfect the life laid in the blood and the blood is that spirit that spirit today that can give the believer the source of life in the restoration to be back to god's perfect fellowship the spoken word was so that it might bring fulfillment of scripture the spoken word is now that it would be fulfilled in you now the prophet says here the law having a shadow the law having a shadow of things not even the real things to come with them sacrifices can never make the believer perfect but a believer once coming into christ and by one spirit baptized into that body he has perfected forever those that are in christ jesus then the things of the world any the worshiper once purged has no more conscience or the right interpretation of that has no more desire of sin for the worshipper once purge has no more desire or conscience of sin he doesn't even want to sin he will do things wrong as soon as he doesn't he will confess his sins right there and say god forgive me i mean i didn't mean to do that you know you know it father god never sees it but he has an advocate he has a confession and makes it makes it right and the god's requirement is perfection and the perfected way a believer can get in christ is it today is through the spirit the spirit is what gives life right the word is a seed but without the spirit the seed has no life the seed won't be able to grow it's like a a a egg as long as the egg is in the is in the nest but without the male the it's only eggs and it won't hatch and i wish to read something here the spoken word is the original seed now program 25 prophet says i believe that it is near the harvest time the seeds have been planted denominations denominational seed of the churches such as the evangel evangelicals evangelicals the the baptist and presbyterian and lutheran and pentecostal seeds has been planted into the pentecostal organization by great men like oral roberts tommy hicks and tommy osborne great men of god see and i believe that the word of god has been planted unadulterated away from any of those organizations that's what's the matter see the seed must have the seed the seed plant must have seed water before it can grow it must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow and it's that's it's the spirit of god the spirit that that rays of jesus from the dead that's the spirit that's going to cause that seed to grow if it dwells in you it shall quicken your mortal bodies and that spirit and the prophet goes on to say in paragraph 295 now what's the matter now she is now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruits oh hum i hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denominations wants more members that's what they're going to get that's what they have gotten the pentecostals wants more pentecostals that's what they're going to get right but the word is going to produce sons and daughters of god that's right that's coming to watch look at that great latter rain supposed to be done how they would run over the wall leap over and how they would be in the army coming just wait a minute the kind of prop you'll get is the kind of seed you put in your field all right now it's planting time and the word being a seed is what the believer needs to plant daily because the harvest is ahead the harvest is before us and when that harvest comes every word we just shredded every word that's been planted will come to pass healing in your body it will come to pass deliverance it will come to pass whatever the situation is through the spoken word it will come to pass we will be put in the position where the spoken word won't just be the original seed but our reality the spoken word will produce on what it's been already at the beginning that's what we need today that's the condition of the believer is to is to know that we have the covenant of the spoken word and it's planting time and as we plant the word will be restored back to the tree of life and i wish to read in revelation chapter 2 verse 7. now it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god which means every believer today will be in overcoming that is not an option or a dispute you will be an overcomer and as you overcome you'll only be able to overcome by the word of god your word as a defense your word as an anchor and you through overcoming what god gives you the right to eat of the tree of life where once the tree of life was guarded by cherubims guarded by angels that now the tree of life is given freely to he that will accept i also wish to turn in revelation chapter 22 verse 14 and it reads it says blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates of the city blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter through the gates of the city now god expects you to keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous as the scripture says and when you turn away from god's commandments that's when separation comes forth that's when bondage happens and when bondage takes place it occurs in your mind and it takes over everything else it starts to eat up like a termite and now bondage is not the place of the believer bondage is not the believer's heritage the believer's heritage is dominion the believer's heritage is power and authority now i wish to read philippians chapter four first eight and this is why it's so important that you stay connected to the tree of life because when you stay connected of the tree of life you're not allowing room for separation because bondage comes in the mind verse first 8 chapter 4 philippians it says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure once over things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there being virtue and if there be any praise think on these things think on these things but the mind of the believer is the battleground for satan and god but god wants to occupy your mind and through the womb with your mind god can dwell in your heart god wants to occupy every speck of your being but it takes the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost is the spirit of god dwelling in you and god will restore you back to the tree of life the tree of life is our source and being that that's our source that's what's going to allow us to live under the conditions of this world uh this world is for moving further away from the word but the believer now is supposed to move closer to god and we read it he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches because he that overcomes has god given the right to eat of the tree of life so i want to tell you the tree of life is christ and if any man is going to find anything today it's only going to be in christ matthew 11 chapter chapter 28 verse 28 i'm sorry matthew 11 verse 28 it says come unto me all ye that labor in our heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light christ is the only thing that can give the believer rest today and if anybody needs that rest you must come god's provided away god provided way is perfection and perfection is the tree of life it's being restored to what god had designed in the beginning the man being in his own image in christ at calvary when he shed his blood he undid everything the enemy did in the beginning and even now if the enemy has done anything to the believer when we look back and can reconnect ourselves to the tree of life it'll undo everything that the enemy is doing god bless you [Applause] let us bound a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you lord god for the tree of life lord god we thank you for the salvation that you've given us for restoring fellowship eternal life and as our brother pointed out lord dominion those are the three things that we lost but father through the spirit god we can oh father be welcomed we can be united again with your lord god and father we realize this is the appointed time where the sons and daughters of god will manifest what you have spoken and father god may we may we continue planting your word lord and our hearts for we know there's a harvest not the harvest lord every spoken word will come to pass lord we thank you god for your grace towards us today for speaking to our hearts and father for driving your word and god my prayer lord is that it has fallen on a good ground that one would know the only way to come to christ is of with the born-again experience you so you told nicodemus father that except a man be born again he will not inherit the kingdom of god father god may you have your preeminence may your word father produce what it spoken lord and father you have given us the assurance that there is no condemnation to those that are in christ jesus heavenly father we thank you god and father may may we think on these things if there be any virtue may we think on these things father we commit every heart before you we commit every situation with every work of bondage father lord god may we all recognize father that we have not been given the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption we thank you this morning lord and may you have your way all throughout this week father it's in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god bless you saints i trust you we're encouraged um we have the greatest time that any believer can live and it's the time that we are living in right now it's we are near the showdown and the showdown is what god has spoken and we have the obligation to believe this word that's what we do we just believe and if you don't know the lord in the pardon of sins well god requires you to be born again except a man be born again he cannot inherit the kingdom of god i invite you this morning to accept of god to accept the the sacrifice that he's paid
