this morning I want to read from 2nd chronicles 7 and we want to continue our thought from a couple weeks ago I mean appreciate brother quick cool last Sunday man praise the Lord just bless my heart that's just just so much that he was shared and went back and listened to the tape was rien spired all over again and my god that was alright thank you brother quickly we appreciate you a man it's so good to see brother Kenny amen god bless you so good to see you today man but we we want a couple weeks ago we started this little thought and I want to just continue forward amen in it and are taking our text from second chronicles chapter 7 starting at verse 14 it says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now and I shall be open in my ears a tenth unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever in my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually a man God at a blessing to the reading of his words you can be seated in the presence of the Lord we started a man on a topic of 5 characteristics of revival a man 5 characteristics of revival and this is part two to that sermon and just a little recap from some of the things that be shared just to kind of make sure we'll go back pick these up and bring them forward we were just revival this term has been used amen I want to say very loosely throughout church history and even today at when I was coming up the the way that we would understand it was Rev I was always so guest preacher coming to town and and you know growing up in the Baptist Church the guest preacher would come and they would you know he would preach and he was saying as happy and you know and after service he'd go to one of the mother's purchase of one of the mothers of the church go to hell house and eat some chicken a man it just if it just so happened to be yo grandma was one of the mothers you'd be invited a man to be there to eat chicken with the preacher Amen praise the Lord and and you know they do that and you think that that's the only time that there was revival but when we come to the revelation of the word we found out it's not necessarily when a preacher comes a town that's not when you haven't revival a man and and and could because the revival doesn't come by the minister the revival actually comes by what the people are doing in their homes and you know when we're seeking the Lord and we're praying and you know we're doing all these things when revival comes it's not necessarily to add new members to the church a man revival comes in order to revive what was already in the church praise the Lord a man sometimes God got the send your revival to remind you where you used to be come on somebody a man and god I have to God I have to kind of reignite a man a little fire that used to be burning inside of you glory to God there was a time where you you didn't want to miss church hallelujah amen but somehow you let them revival fires burn down sometimes somehow you let the embers a man get a little bit too low and and I'm reminded of a story one time of a you know a preacher there was a brother he had kind of stopped coming to church a man and he really didn't want to be bothered too much but too many people and so you know the preacher happened to go out to his house and I was a little warm I mean a little cool that day and so they had the fire burning and the preacher they really didn't say any much a man to up to the man because he didn't really like the talk so you know he walked into the house and you know could I have a seat and sat down and you know yeah and maybe got a little something to drink and they just sat there by the fire and and while they were sitting by the fire there was a little log a man in the fire that began to kind of fizzle out a man you can see it was it was burning hot and then it got it just got you know just fizzling out where it wasn't burning hot anymore and and what the preacher did is he walked up and he and he took the little thing and he pushed it a man into the into the midst of the heat you know where where the fire was really blazing and I all he did was just pushing him before you know it that little thing that was burning out reconnected it rekindled him and the fire got rekindled and when and when the man you know they know the visitor I mean the whole stack that was hosting a preacher saw that he looked at the preacher say I'll be in church on Sunday cuz he realized he was a little long you understand he was a little odd that was once on fire and then he lost his fire somehow he he got disconnected from everything and the only way to get your fire restarted again is get back where get back into where it started out the first place hallelujah somebody a man so so when we talk about you know revival there are some characters characteristics that we would see a man and and and and I want to just you know I kind of lay a couple of things and I mentioned this this quote out of the third seal and and the prophet made a statement said the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it is what he said and it says it will take those seven on them unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it Amen he promised it so you know I was I was telling you how when I grew up they used to preach that particular quote and they always kept revival happening in the future Amen we don't need a revival in the Millennium Amen whinny revival now right and if the Prophet told us that the bride hadn't had a revival yet he said God will send it hallelujah and what we had to do is kind of read between the lines and find out where God had sent it they kept pointing me to just one little quote a man in the fourth church age but I mean in the fourth seal but that wasn't it it was all the seals a man could he say the bride hasn't had a revival yet no manifestation of God to stir her yet we're looking for it we'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again I want to read this quote out of laodicean church age a man if I can just to kind of show you that we are in continuous revival even right now Amen we are in continuous revival and this statement says now this messenger glory of Malachi 4 and revelation 10 Amen this message of Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 is going to do two things amen according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's amen and says - he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation team which are the revelations contained in the seven seals so the prophet has clearly identified weather revelations are contained amen so if you if you want to get in revival you're gonna have to come to the word hallelujah amen if you're not man I'm not I mean you say you're a revival but I'm not if you want to get there you got to come to the word hallelujah because revivals always on the word and any true revival will come because people got back to the word listen to this he says says says I contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so brother Branham has come brother Branham has gone brother Branham revealed these truths to us with fellowship and around this word so no longer are we waiting on revival we are amen it's based on these statements we can clearly say we are in revival hallelujah alright let's go on I made a couple statements where it's revival when it comes even when it came in the days of Jesus only a small minority is gonna know that it's happening only a small minority other thing is when God begins to shake things people don't realize what's even being done when God's movement people have no idea what God is really doing amen hallelujah hallelujah God is shaking his church even right now all right a man we are in revival all right let me go on a little further hallelujah now there are characteristics to this revival let me just read this quote out of a man speak to this mountain and then we will will go forward there this is where we're getting our thoughts from how to speak to this mountain he says this is now where we're trying to place the revival just in the best setting that we can we do not what we call major on divine healing because divine healing is a minor and even though we thank God for divine healing which we have that praise God you know some churches that's they get a miracle and they're so surprised that it happened they don't know how to go further right but miracles should be everyday occurrences here all right and not that we get so relaxed that it happened that we don't give God praise for it but it should be it should just be normal Amen to see miracles that's normal God is in the midst there's a supernatural God that dwells in the midst of his people so he does supernatural things right Amen some miracles should be coming praying all it take is faith and all of you to see a miracle hallelujah amen I mean you know I was mentioned there's so many different things that happen here recently and and you know we've seen cancer heal a man we've we've seen a number of things that happen in this church you know I told you how precious you know sister just testified we had two sisters recently healed of cancer you know and and my dad was healed of cancer right cancer is not to half of God listen when they tell you for stage don't fear you you you're in the full state you know and it's like doc you never even diagnosed the first stage you never even diagnosed the second stage I came the office once and I'm in full stage right what that is that's a scare tactic that's that devil trying to put fear in you hallelujah but if you refuse that package that the devil centum sent into you you will experience the miracle of revival because in revival they're supposed to be healing of the seer right that supposed to happen when revival and when you can say the Saint huh me revive I don't know about you but I remember in vaudeville so I'm expecting my body to be healed hallelujah somebody glory to God a man I mean it's time for us to stop running from the devil start running the devil glory to God he's under my feet Church hey man a man so he goes on he says it's now we're trying to place the revival just in the best setting we can we do not what we call major on divine healing because divine healing is a minor and you cannot major on a minor we know that so the great thing that we're after for any revival is to bring lost souls to Christ all right we want to see lost souls come to Christ and that that could be lost they never know nothing about Jesus or lost because you done Baxley it but we want to see lost souls come to Christ and see see when we have meetings it creates an atmosphere where people want to walk in and get underneath that anointing hallelujah but I'm here to tell you that when the meeting is over the Norton has not gone anywhere that same anointing is still here and whatever you need God's got it if you need deliverance contact if you need showing God's got it if you need peace of mind God's got it whatever you need Todd's got it and we're not waiting for a preacher to come amen we just want to get into the presence of God let the Holy Spirit do what only he can do alright let me go on a little further here he says this is to bring lost souls to Christ first then he says revive the church back into a spiritual condition now this is important I want to hit this today we want to revive the church back into the spiritual condition I want you to think about where you used to be where where where where where you know man where I mean I used to have a prayer life I used to have this you said think about where you used to be in God hallelujah and revival was to take you back to that place oh come on somebody see revive the church back into a spiritual condition to where it should be listen he said close communion with God bring fellowship amongst the churches third in print and fourth pray for the sick that's our aim our try is sinners first fellowship with the churches and a close walk with the church up to God and then pray for the sick so I listed these out a man winning souls to Christ was number one number two was restored the church to his right condition of spiritual conviction condition number three was close communion with God a man for was fellowship amongst other churches and five was praying for the sick and like I mentioned to you before I remember some time ago I was just in a meeting and brother belching that mentioned these five things about that characteristic survivor and I wrote that thing down said man I got it I got to use that one day and I held on to it for probably more than a year but I want to just kind of come and bring this back to the church because I believe we're here right now this is what we're experiencing now we know we've seen lost souls come to Christ we've seen that we've watched we've watched that so that lets us know that we are in revival Amen we know that we've seen healing here in our church hallelujah in it and it's good to be able to talk about what's going on in your church early it is this week one of the brothers was at a at the hospital you know just kind of talking with somebody and any and he ran into this person and they had a pretty serious situation I think of a seven-year-old that was that was suffering from cancer think about that seven years old right suffering from cancer but it was good that the brother has some ammunition he could walk in there and he can say I noticed may seem impossible I've noticed may seem hard yeah your seven-year-old child got got cancer but but but God can heal cancer and you can stand there and tell that parent that and you know I mean they hear what the doctors say but maybe they just need to hear a testimony they meant from somebody else that that can tell you not I heard about it no we experienced it in my church this is what happened at my church God is still healing tense sighs amen it's not to a God can do impossible things God can do incredible things hallelujah in a step there and begin to talk about the things of God with this family and somebody else came up or so you know what I feel the presence of God here and if somebody else is identifying the presence of God through a testimony God didn't give you that for you to keep it God want you to share it because your testimony is gonna send somebody else free praise God hallelujah Church right so when we share things like that he's just sharing in the hospital and somebody said I feel the prim guys well let's pray right here right now amen we don't know what God to do right but I believe God can hear that seven-year-old a man cancers not too hard when you revive you expect things like this you say look you know the reason that this happened in our church cuz we in revival how come I never heard nothing about it it's because it's only a few people know about it glory to God all right let's go on a little further here I wanted to bring in because we got lost souls to Christ and man we got with no prayer for the sick and we sing God heal the sick is not just prayer but God will heal the sick amen we've seen that but we want to talk about this a man today fellowship amongst other churches this is this is another sign of revival and and we know that God has allowed this particular area to experience a man of some unity like we have never seen amongst churches all over the world ain't number the truth right God has given us a such a unit it ain't always been this way so you know and us knowing that it has not always been this way we do everything we can to keep the devil out where he might try to stop the fellowship amen right we do everything to try to keep the devil out there's there's a thing that we do as pastors you know that if you know there's nothing wrong if a person feel late so you know I brother Jack I want to go to this church you know there's nothing wrong I'd rather see hallelujah I rather see Saints leave this church and go to another message Church hallelujah because now when I talk about fellowship a bunch of churches I'm not taught by any church I got some quotes on this I'm not just talk about fellowshipping at any church I'm talk about fellowship at amongst people of like precious faith so if you come and say I want to go to this other mr. Church we're gonna pray with you and maybe we're gonna pray for you and and then I have conversation with the pastor let them know hey the Saints want to come and fellowship at your church no problem they left here under really good conditions amen receive them they are not a problem in the church the these are faithful people these are good people right the deeds the type of conversations that we have hallelujah can some thought be running from stuff oh I know what I'm talking about you all never you all ever read the story of Abner in the Bible huh amen and Abner if I'm not if I'm if I remember correctly Abner was whispers you know he was he has it wasn't Abner wasn't the other guy jo-ann no no no no no it was Abner Abner Abner he was there you know in the scripture not now I'm just kind of calling yourself a memory so y'all just bear with me if I don't have it right I'll get it right Amen but but there David had the kingdom established and this man at first they didn't want to make David the fool king they they they I mean Saul's son I can't think of his name right now but Saul son was the other King and this guy Abner begin to take advantage of some of the Kings wives hello somebody hallelujah the king called them out on this town the king said why you do this I mean you're not suppose this is adultery man you're not supposed to do the Word of God says not to do it right so somebody stood up to me say you're not supposed to do this and he said now who you are Here I am protecting you and I'm getting control of this army I got all this power and authority and you gonna challenge me I'll tell you what I'll do I take your army and I go to David hello somebody right this man was not really interested in fellowship this man should have been interested in repenting right he was trying to run from some problem that he calls oh come on somebody amen so so so when he got over there with David David oh yeah will welcome me right in but Joab say now I know this guy AB name right and Joab deserved a different spirits hello and joy I've said I'm sorry Dave we're gonna have to take this in our old hands and Joep begin to get with this felling Joe al qasas got to die now he shouldn't have did it that way but what Joe thought he was towards protecting David's and he probably was right so sometimes you got to discern the spirit and the way you're discerning is by the pastors communicating hello somebody knowing that things have been done in decency and in order it keeps the fellowship amongst the churches this is why the devil can't get a 1-up over here hey man what up in South Florida because these we handle things the right way it keeps the devil out now let me say something let me say something can I say something every pot let me every plant doesn't grow in the same soil can I say that again every plant doesn't grow in the same soil there are certain trees that grow here in Florida you cannot take them out to the desert in Arizona and expect them to grow and there are certain things that grow in Arizona that will not grow here in Florida certain things in Florida won't grow in Michigan or whether you have to have it planted in the right spot for it to grow but the reason that you plan it oh hello somebody the reason you plant yourself in a church it's so that you can grow I hope you can read between the lines you gotta know what's all you need to be planning here and when you get there when people see fruit they may then got nothing the same but in the midst of we should lose fellowship because that is a characteristic of revival hello somebody first thing I say now okay so it's okay we welcome everybody but now that you're not leaving you don't have nothing your heart against this other church do you because we fellowship all the time sometimes we go over there and sometimes they come over here and I want to make sure that when they come over here you in church are you in revival oh come on somebody and revival is not when your favorite preachers preaching people this morning revival is not only when your favorite preachers preaching revival happens with somebody else's preaching oh alright church but fellowship amongst other sister churches and no church that dominate it should be fellowship everybody should be encouraged to do something I feel good any hi so let me just kind of drop this I want to put this quote in here on this on this fellowship amongst other sister Church because I'm not talking about I'm not talking about fellowship in anywhere let me let me drop a call here for you god of this evil age look at this there is only two classes of people spoke of in the New Testament man we was trying to state it with somebody it's only to look at this only two classes of people spoke of a New Testament the children of God and the children of the devil that's it right you say did you know that you want to put a scripture down for it first John 3:10 as you'll read it it says an institute of God manifest and the children devil whosoever does not do if not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so all the children of God and the children of the devil that's the only two groups it is says if you want a scripture I'm reading it right here got it wrote out all right all right and Ephesians 2:2 they are called the children of disobedience right like Eve with disobedient to God's Word the children of obedience and disobedience have nothing in coming let's go on a little further then how can the Bride of Christ associate in a denomination sorry talk about fellowship and everywhere how can the Bride of Christ associate in a denomination when one is disobedient in the other obedient listen how can how can one be the word and the other one perverted words how can a prostitute and a clean woman walk together in agreement listen they can't do it they have no fellowship at all come out from among them it's of the devil it's the mark of the beast heading right into it now Oh denomination I want to make sure we get that clear you know you talk you talk you talk fellowship why me just about no I can't fellows with people that don't believe what I believe we ought to do that I said now I'm just had the conversation with somebody didn't believe what I believe we could not see eye to eye I don't want to call it an argument but we knew that we were not seeing we were looking at the same scripture seeing two different things and I'm looking at it and I say I say this no you're just making the words so difficult no you missing some things it say this see two can walk together said they've agree so we're not will hallelujah can I I want to say this while I'm here let me finish this quote I'm gonna say something just give me a second give me a second how can he said cut up amongst him and it's of the devil it's the mark of the beast heading right into it now all denominations I don't care who it is God has taken God has taken not a denomination of people for its name a denomination won't receive these truths it will take an individual person that can see God look at its word and believe it and belong to no organization but live for God not for its organization the intellectual wisdom of some Bishop of something that's taught it that's right see that's that's not what we're looking for so we talk about fellowship amongst the church talking about this every church you know I've had I've had plenty of people asked me about wanting to come and fellowship with our church so you know maybe we ought to get our churches together and just have some fellowship we'll talk about that you know we'll talk about that next subject because I'm not releasing that here everybody they can't receive these truths right and and I'm just not gonna put anything before you glory to God I want to make sure you're healthy spiritually so I'm just not putting anything for you before I mean Balaam went when the children Israel got mixed up with Balaam they got in trouble that's not the fellowship that God wanted them to have alright Church so look I mean not that we don't love people but look we are before we actually have a combined service like that we gonna sit down and talk about a few things glory alright not that we don't love people but you know here here to say we're not fellowship with just with everybody we talk about people that believe what we believe and I was just taking myself you know just even in in our plaster these truths that God has given us and we're so we got so many churches that that see us can you imagine in no one's day maybe there were a couple other people building boats and one boat was right next to Noah's pump it looked like it would be safe and maybe somebody that was owned Knorr boat got off Noah's boat to go on the other boat and they were that close to Noah's boat yeah I hope you read between the lines they were that close to nose boat and when destruction came they realized they were in the wrong boat but they had the opportunity to be in the right boat I hope you can read between lemon so when we talk about fellowship in a month churches we not talk about we not talk about denomination we talk about people that believe this same truth that we believe and let me take something we are not one-of-a-kind here if you would open up in fellowship you will see that as a whole bunch of us around here in Palm Beach County Palm Beach Brower day it's a whole bunch of not just there all over the world praise God when you can see brother Quaker coming in and preaching and say my way brother Quaker from from not not our Ghana Ghana right darlin from Ghana how did he can I just you know cities are these are his testimony how he got here all right he was at school supposed to be a man getting something to eat and the thing that he's supposed to get to eat that day they didn't have it so he went to another little spot so let me try this and when he got there he saw a sister and they looked at it saying I she look like us you from Ghana who is us whose ass how do you know us it's like she looked like us and sister yes you go to church yes what church you go to Spirit of Truth Tabernacle and say that's not that's not good I need to go for that back that the Clinton question I'm just trying to open up the door but I need to drive the nail home I don't know if she ready for this but I need to know I can I'm looking at her and she looking look she looked like us but I'm gonna be able to tell real quick if she us real quick one question is she awesome not before before you go one question who is your prophet William Marion Branham what where is your church that's the church that I want to go to so we fellowship we table our fellowship amongst people of like precious faith you can be in a whole nother country and people can tell by the way you dress and you want us glory to God glory to God so so it's not it's not denominational churches that's not what we talk about it a man and and it you know sometimes people get and I'm gonna just be honest folk get hurt in church they do now I'm gonna say two things to that one is people do get hurt in church another is that not all the time is the ministry trying to hurt you not all the time is the ministry trying to hurt you that's not people's intention amen all right so so if you get hurt sometime you might have to take your little plant and plant it somewhere else it's okay as long as you grow you know I say it's okay cuz I was playing it somewhere else before before I start a spirit of truth to have an ankle so I don't have to move churches I've done that right so I think that happens with everybody there's nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with long as you do it in the right spirit God will bless it you understand hey man no don't come here and start talking about the other church oh this don't do that no we trying to keep fellowship you saw in discord man just understand your your your plant got to be in certain soil in order to grow that's it all right can I go on a little further you know there was a time that his brother was talking about this when we talked about fellowship the time his brother made a comment about some ducks and they were in this pan they had ducks on on one side and ducks on the other side and and man they they could suppose see that they were ducks they want to fellowship with one another but because of the walls the division that was among them they couldn't get the fellowship can I tell y'all something it used to be a time there was so much division just right here in this area oh my y'all believe seven fellas y'all don't believe seven thunders how do you know what I believe I believe what the Prophet said but we were dividing over simple things in the message and we were all ducks not only ducks we were we were all in the same family divided in the same family something was wrong with that picture we believe the same message and we divided them same family come on somebody this God did not send her a message to do that right so so here we are divided in the same family came even fellowship we were ducks that wanted to fellowship but because ministers put up walls it's the truth in it hide ministers were the ones that put up walls and in order to be identified with a particular Minister I'm talking to y'all this morning and already identify with a particular Minister you stayed with that wall but you had young cousin your mama your brother your sister you couldn't fellowship with him because of that wall but I thought you wanted to see the wall come down well nobody was gonna knock the wall down so what God had to do is Simpson water and when the water come it began to raise up a little bit and when the water raised the duck were trees and then the water raised a little bit more in the duck WA tree some more and eventually the water got so high that the water overtook the wall and when the water overtook the wall the Ducks could no longer see the wall because they were in fellowship can fellowship again our true revival will produce fellowship I thank God that I've seen walls come down we are under where we're experiencing that we are experiencing it a man the other thing that happens when let me just read this this is out of the message presuming Allah thought here and and and all of this happens church when we mature in God when we mature in God look at this it made the statement says I happen to think kind of put a spiritual a little interpretation to that when I was a young minister every man that made a mistake I want y'all to catch what the prophets saying here every man that made a mistake he was cut out of the picture if you make a mistake that's it you're out that ain't that ain't even christ-like right amen they say every man made a mistake he was out of the picture he couldn't even run in the race that's all if he wasn't a Baptist he just was out of the picture that's all see he just had to see things see the things I saw or the man was altogether wrong and then after I got a little bit older I begin to realize that you know the blanket kind of stretched a little I've seen where he had to and what he had to go through with a lot of toils a pastor of a church and the heartaches that goes with it I realized that this blanket spreads a little over him too you know to kind of keep him from getting cold and now as we come on down to about where I am now I tell you we meet one another so bad we just can't hardly do without one another that's all there is to it and as we see the day is getting evil and things the way they are why I think it's good that we come together fellowship together and I just I just longed to get with the Brethren and talk to them and so forth all the different churches and Brotherhood I love that see is something about it that's real I was just thinking to myself you know there was a statement that the Prophet says when we were working together it will send a revival into every church when working together it'll send a revival into every church and I've been at services where I've heard different testimonies I remember we had a service here we was hosting another church and what the brother Isaacson not was sharing his testimony how he got filled with the Holy Ghost that bless me that seemed a little revival fire sparked through me just to hear him say something like that right I mean when I heard brother Vince testimony over at brother jeans that blessed me when sometimes you just get amongst the Saints you hear different things and it it sets a revival in your church this is what happens see and I want to I want to make it very clear you know because I had this happen a couple of times recently and we went to a service and and and I didn't tell sometime I didn't tell who was preaching so I got the question are you preaching because what you're asking me and or what you're actually telling me not asking me if you're preaching I'll go if you're not preaching I won't go that ain't revival that's not revival and hallelujah revival is not based on brother Jack and last week I was supposed to preach but things you know just got changed a little bit and that someone's like oh man I heard somebody said you got to stop doing my pastor now come on y'all don't do that don't don't say it like that don't be that way right it's okay and when we got there last week we saw why God did what he did won't he do it so you just let God be gone and just keep having revival is that Alright okay let me go on a little bit further that's best uh so revival should bring one of the characteristic of the revival should bring fellowship amongst other sister churches a fourth characteristic I want to talk about here is reviving the church back into a spiritual condition bringing the church back into a spiritual condition many of us can go back and look at various places where we were in God and and we can see man I got away from that spot I want to get back to where I used to be in God right and revival is sent in order to bring you back to that spiritual condition that you were in now look at look at this this statement here at Ephesian Church the Prophet makes a statement says now all right he says now what was the spiritual comment of that church this is a church of ephesus what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love my god see when we were evolving the church bringing it back to a spiritual condition it's because the church got away from its first love it had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of god amen was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost he says in plain English that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit the control of the Spirit this was exactly what took place after Moses led Israel out of Egypt goes on and says this the way of I want you to catch that the way of God was to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and science and god-given wonders so God's Way of leiva's people is through a cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and science and I got given wonders see that's why I say you know look we're not looking for revival month denominations they have rejected the Prophet for this day hallelujah right and if we gonna have revive we got to come back to the vindicated and word that got promised for this hour you've got only have revival underneath the message remember I told you if my people called by my name everybody can have this you have to be called by his name and you have to belong to him how you gonna have revival baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost huh how you gonna have revival like that glory to God amen amen it won't happen Church unless we come back to this word we won't even see revival revival is on the word the revealed word that's been given to us the way of God was to lead by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God elected I like this God elected God ordained and God equip and God sent God sent what God sent me now if it's a woman preacher leading a church you're not in revival because God never called a woman to preach the gospel and let me say this again never not one time in the Bible that God called a woman to preach the gospel now I know nowadays we we just you know sister say I felt the mantle drop which one which mammal dropped on you because dismantle the mantle you talked about is not in God's Word and we need to follow the pattern of what's in the Word of God God never ordained a woman to preach the gospel it's gonna be a god-sent man alright so if you you call yourself having revival and it's a woman preacher that's not revival that's confusion praising that is confusion and God is not in nothing like that hallelujah invite me for what know a man they know that want to bring your church break we're not bringing the church over for that praise the Lord Amen that's why we're not fellowship with anything and everything we want to fell see what people that's fellowship and around the word the true Word of God Genesis to Revelation I mean well I just felt fire that's fine you feel fire but you know you ain't you still in call I'm gonna tell you it ain't but a few churches that's gonna say this today aim but a few ain't but a few most churches gonna go right along with it well you know that was for that time and you have to in you have to you have to give context for the time so you telling me what do what you actually telling me as God is dumb that's what you're telling me that God my God can only think about that know what God wrote was eternal it wasn't just for that tires for that time this time and if it's at IMATS it is gonna be for that too Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever not some time all the time praise the Lord somebody I told you this reviving for everybody it's for if my people which are called by my name praise it praise God any high but we don't use that scripture up something but you better really read what is what it's saying Amen hallelujah all right I'm going on a little further God sent man with the whole camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost move the they rebelled and warned it a set of rules increase go by then they wanted a king then they wanted to be exactly like the world and went into complete apostasy and oblivion that that is exactly how the first church age started it will get worse and worse into the Holy Spirit is completely rejected and God must destroy the people so what we're seeing here is people have gotten away from the word the children of Israel was a clean a clear example they would get away from the word so often especially in the book of Judges they they'd be doing very well for season it done very well they servant got they got got first then their style start allowing themselves to get influenced by some of the other gods of the other nations and they get away from God then they go into bondage amen they they gif they get free from bondage then they go back into plumbers gonna get free from and it was just a cycle just seemed like they can never break it but the only time they would ever come out of a man bondage is when they turn back to God hallelujah and all the time you're gonna come out of spiritual bondage as when you turn back to God let me go on a little further here there's a statement made Oh glory to God in revival I can just imagine sometimes we get a little carried away in our worship but you know Paul said we worship God it's called here see and if you ain't talking about us then we ain't worship yet can I say that again if you ain't talking about us that we ain't start worshipping yet praise the Lord somebody because we supposed to be worshipping God in a way that's called here see and actually what they'll says that you just in your flesh I don't heard that you know sometimes I was singing at different places a brother Jack just singing in his flesh and what you're really saying is that I really like what brother Jack doing I wish I could do that that's what to really say hallelujah somebody but but see the greatest form of I mean flattery is criticism hello somebody so info criticized you must be doing something right I learned a long time ago that folk will not throw rocks they will not throw bottles they will not throw sticks at trees that don't have fruit huh praise the Lord people don't throw rocks and bottles at trees that don't have fruit the only time you're gonna get hit with a rock you're getting hit with a bottle get hit with a stick because your tree must have some fruit and it's fruit that people wrote come on somebody that's why you get hit the way you did hit but that's alright don't worry let him throw a rock let him throw a bottle and let him knock off some fruit because I'm a bear again praise God I know God has a cycle God has a low yes lovely God has an inside my roots and I'm gonna bear again no matter what I go through praise God search you got to know who you are in Christ but I could imagine because because we we might worship a little different you don't even know worship like I can take you to some places for you to see some worship and I'm a teen you only you know when you go to some of the places that I go to and see worship you don't criticize you just get right on me you'll be trying to find get in where you fit in prays alone and when everybody around you doing it then is everybody in a flesh no you in your flesh if you ain't got a step it's help out there for you if you want if you wanna step but don't criticize us because we want to worship I mean some of y'all know when y'all was even in in denomination you had your step the message that come to take your step the message to give you motor step provides message they come to take this from you so if we want to cut a rope we'll cut it wrong when you get good to you this is what we used to do and we did that just on music now I'm doing it on revelation understanding I got understand I know why I shout man when John saw his name he shouted to glory to God you know hallelujah they might have said it something different if then if John was actually from Africa it might be written a little different John saw his name and he let out a dance glory to God a man church but see I want I want to just drop this look because there's something that the Prophet said right here in our city the message message to the resurrection look at this he says this how easy the Jews condemned Jesus when they say when they walked through the Red Sea and the fathers had and on dry land and all these miracles and signs and then still didn't believe that that was their God who was doing the same thing that's the way it is today it's a failing of the church theology and such an educationist took the place of the old-fashioned mourners bench we used to have a mourners bench bench you took that down in the basement we don't use it no more that's the truth all the fire we ever had on the altar a man we put it in the stove what we need today you say well brother Branham I'm afraid you'll get a little fanaticism a little wildfire look at what he said right here in your city I'd rather have a little wildfire then no fire at all so I hope I just set some people free we rather have some wild fire there's no fire at all let the folk dance if they wanna dance let them worship if they wanna worship however they want express themselves to God let the people express themselves I felt like Moses Pharaoh let my people go a man Church alright you've gone we gotta get a little criticism but understand if we didn't get the criticism we must not have been doing something right because we worship God in a way that's called here see amen now you notice let me finish read this I'm gonna say something here sure I would I can put up with a little fanaticism before I could put up with something that's so icy and stiff and starch and what else and ungodly how can God move into a place like that go to a place in the spiritual thermometer registering a hundred below zero somebody say man and everybody stretch their neck and look around and see who said it preacher said you interrupt me it's just one little mama he actually called a mammy his boy got old enough and he moved away from his little church that he was going to and didn't worship in a certain way and he got away from that he went to this little church and he took his momma says mama was dressed so old-fashioned he was just embarrassed to have his mama come to church and mama you know she don't know no better she this church was a a sadiddy' you know type Church they they they didn't say a man they just listened to the preacher preached and nobody say man everybody just sitting there right and it was very cold so preacher got to saying something about Jesus and the mom said Amen and preaches it you had to try to find this place again and then and then he you know he kept it going you know a little bit more and and my Oh glory and that's just old that just preach the brothers could you please you know see right this late in the little fella he was just so embarrassed that my mama is in church saying a man when Mama's in church saying hallelujah oh no Mama we just don't do that just sit here don't see nothing money sit here don't see nothing I mean you know you know we don't feel nothing you shouldn't feel go see mama 1a1 based on Mama's feelings you talking about my lord you just said something that he just did for me right now you probably could hold it in where you went but but me I got to express myself right he'd been too good for me just to sit hold on huh I don't mind sandy man I don't mind cutting the food yeah you know when people go to you know to a a football game a basketball game and somebody in there watch women fell especially in basketball boy he done you know he got him on skates pull back in and you know he hold it up in the air like that you know know that he hold it up y'all do the same thing some of y'all brothers praise God hold it up in the air when it when it goes you talk about all net you're giving high-fives and and if you a fan of the game you wouldn't even shoot but you happy that you're the man on the team shot main and you are giving high hello somebody and ain't nobody telling you out if they told you to sit down after that they wouldn't be fans it might be a fight in the stance hallelujah and and if you if you if you if you a fan of the visiting team and you have the home team state you like rubbing it in a face huh yeah really holding a hand you know high-fiving and chest pumping and all counts oh you do that over a basketball or you do that over a football but you come to the house of God good well if I want the chance papa [Applause] is big too good to me I didn't come here to sit alone brother I come to praise and can I tell you something worship is a action word it's a verb you got to be an action please God I don't know why I shout I don't know why I worship I know why I praise God I'd rather have a little wildfire then no fire at all I rather see brother Simba Jess and if y'all if y'all just watch the video that you saw brother Simba and it cat contagious brother Jeff just ran from out of nowhere he was trying you sitting down watching at least he tried praise God - praise God man if I can't sell I can do something for the Lord praise cop we not sit around gonna watch nobody man y'all better be careful and there's gonna be it's gonna be a mixture of things in here people that worship all counterweights they were Sinead that I mean that everybody known worshiped american-style tea they worship somebody's got some remember brother brother Dan Kwok came here he said when God blessed him with that church he said he let out a nice African dance he said I gave got a good one amen people worshiped out differences I mean and and so certain songs that we have in might invoke certain worship that's just who we are and there was why you don't find somebody you know they're gonna cut a step that's what we do you know kind of finals just lifting our hands that's what we do things brother Diggs just text me and say brother I was watching the video of the servicing and and and I heard sister Michelle say praise is what I do you say brother that just bless me talk about me all you want to I'm gonna still praise imma still worship gonna stop me from praising God I yeah you know I I'm this I'm on the other end I'm not a young person no mo I'm on another I got to start checking some things I you understand what I'm saying I'm not going back the other way I'm going forward God only promised me 70 years I could be 20 years away you understand what I'm saying I started looking at things and you gonna tell me I can't praise him not make you better hold mime you like that is over which and young people if you coming up with people are you just in your flesh and I'd rather you have some little wildfire getting your flesh every once in a while don't don't don't don't don't don't don't be too reserved on God man you want God to give it to you sparingly we're gonna give it to him sparingly give them everything you got oh my god brother Jai it's gonna be fanaticism that's okay we'll take some of it if we get too crazy we know good I don't see some of them dancers get out of hand to praise the Lord young people so you don't people bring dances that I know that came from the club and I'm gonna tell you something when you're dancing you know the Holy Ghost check you if one of your moves ain't right and when you check you guess what you do you don't do that with no more we talk about revival all right this last element of revival is close communion with God close communion with God and I would just remembered a scripture out of Revelation 3 and 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me and this is to the individual because as a church the church has put Christ on the outside he's knocking on his own church door trying to get back in but it's the individual that is allowing Christ to come back in and when it comes back in they're having close communion with one another hallelujah listen there's a statement here that I want to read out of the Queen of Sheba and but before I read that brother Branham made a couple statements he says I'm sorry just a little little thought that I had here I want to inject Moses had to leave Egypt in order to experience the burning bush and when he got to the burning bush he was having close communion with God but in order for him to get into this place of close chameleon there was some stuff that he had to leave and I want to tell you this as we turn from our wicked ways it brings us into close communion with God the Queen of Sheba the Prophet says this then if he sends the thing it's up to the people to receive it or reject it and I'm telling you our God has already sent it so receive it and each one as an individual not because of your church standing but as an individual it doesn't lay with them whether your church accepts it it's whether you accept it salvation is a person work it's a personal faith not a universal Church faith but a personal faith in the Lord Jesus no matter if father don't believe it and mother don't believe it it's what you believe and notice when they did receive it them great signs and wonders in Jubilee broke out but when they rejected it then darkness and gross darkness come to the people and old people of the last day can't just see why gross darkness has fallen on this country the gospel of Christ has been rejected you don't want to believe that but it's a noted fact it's the truth is too bad but it's the truth and I think that if that be the case that each one of us should take inventory of our own experience and our own standards with God and see how we stand in his sight look at this he says not by any tradition not by any mental workup but by that clothes hidden communion not because of our intellectual conception and so I love this as not by mental worship you know you know there there are times where you know we don't come to church every Sunday for somebody to give us the priests music you go to other churches that man we had the funeral other weekend I saw this one fella man he could wait a couple of days just couldn't wait one one guy on the drums he just when you gonna let me go when you gonna let me go and just he just needed me to just see just a couple things and once he got it out he went and sat down somewhere that's not what we talk that's a--that's a mental workup I'm talked about man you this thing been burning in you old oh we can and finally that song it got me pull it right out you right we talked about we talked about instantaneous spontaneous worship hallelujah I'm watching some of y'all man y'all getting into y'all groove I come out here and brother Solomon started that little song at the end and he brought me out and everybody's you know well get ready to do something here you feel that Oh hallelujah it says and I think that is that that be the case though that each one should take inventory of our own experience and all standing with God and see how we stand the sight not buying a tradition not by name in a workout but by by that close hidden communion not because of our intellectual conception of his Creed or of the Creed of the church or even the knowledge that we have with the word but some people knows the word real well but don't know the author Moses note the word real well but that blessed hiding place was it not ridiculous to see Moses standing in a king's court with all the celebrity with the finest of language trained and all the wisdom of the Egyptians and smart but God had to take him out behind the mountain for 40 years God schooling is always right God schools his man and remember as trained as an Egyptian a sheep herder was it was an Obama was an abomination and isn't it strange to see how foolish it would seem in the hearts of men with wisdom with a man with all of his great intelligence with all the great armies from his education step away I like this y'all stay with me on this one step away from his worldly wisdom step away from his great associates and go out behind the desert to become into an abomination to the people that he wants associated with think about that he goes on to make a few more statements about that may I say this with reverence it's tonight that when God calls men many times he has to step out of the political ranks out of the social ranks and walk out into a place if it would be necessary if his associates had to say he's going crazy or he become a Holy Roller but it's that secret place it's that spot oh don't miss it my loyal friends every one of you that's received Christ of all your teachings your fine passes your great affiliations with your churches which is all right don't miss understand me but you are trying to place that before this but that little time that God gets you away from all your associates gets you gets you way back in the corner brings you into a place in a secret place where that the wisdom of the world becomes so insufficient to where all the education that you ever had doesn't mean nothing Internet divine presence till the lust of the eye gets so dim you can't see it anymore until the love of money has completely vanished away from you and when you stand there alone with your over God that's the thing that counts that's the thing that makes you forget all you ever knew he goes on that's what Moses that's where Moses had to get so we talked about communion with God that's where Moses had to give and what a beautiful picture got revealed himself there and a burning bush and Moses know more about God in five minutes in the presence of that burning bush then he learned forty years in Egypt that's the place to be alone with God the next day on his road to deliver Egypt or Israel out of Egypt with his wife setting on a meal with it with a little child under each arm and the long whiskers blowing in a stick in his hand going down the road screaming at the top of the top of his voice or said Moses where you're going I'm going down to Egypt to take over a one-man invasion going against a greater in number that all the world had the chariots and horsemen and spearmen and bowmen of Egypt and one little old wrinkled up eighty year old man with a stick in his hand and the white whiskers blowing going down to Egypt to take over and the thing of it was he did it because he had been alone with God that's where the church needs tonight I want to see today is not some fantastic not some new denomination but beter but but to be alone with God oh all selfishness all malice all fear or unbelief just fades away and God becomes preeminent there it is that's what makes the person different that's what made Moses different that's what makes you different when they went down that time with the vision not with his education he could have called more people together with his education than he could with his gift I want to read that again he could have called more people together with his education than he could with his gift but Israel was ready to receive and they did listen now what did they do they were laying out into the wilderness and led across Jordan to the promised land what a marvelous thing you know Moses had to get along with God and it was only after he left Egypt that he could get to this place we can get along with God I don't know what it is that God might be trying to call you from I don't know what it is that he might be trying to call you I don't know but he wants to have that sweet communion with you sometimes it's a career sometimes a man we put so many things in front of God that we we just don't give him the proper time that he needs right but but revival should produce a man close communion with God that should be one of the characteristics and and I tell you I think as we just all do a personal evaluation a man just a personal inventory God where some of these areas of my life that I can give up where I can I can get close with you and sometimes what God does he start taking some things from you I just learned you know as I read scripture man I was this morning the Lord spoke something to me I was reading about Joseph and I wanted I want to tell you I was looking at Joseph and in prison I mean how do man get from prison he was his daddy's favorite son and here he and just went out one day looking for his brothers and from that day on his life change all he was doing is trying to do it his dad action to go look for his brothers man ended up in in a pit from hit went to part of his house part of his wife total Island the man ends up in prison and I was just thinking about ministering and Joseph was a young man he was 17 years old when he left his daddy's when he not I mean when he left him when his brothers put him in a pit he was 17 years old he was a young man think about the how young he was standing before Pharaoh giving him all this wisdom Joseph but when I thought about Joseph pilla prison the Lord spoke to my spirit he says where you are is right where I want you to be and I want to tell you that today I don't know what you're going through but I want to say where you are is right where God wants you to be in this place so have close communion with you let's pray father we're just moved by your word guard your profit has been bringing us a little thought for us to ponder these five characteristics of revival and how we just see that the various things Oh God we can just from the quote that he gave us for these various things the winning of souls to Christ we've seen that the church restored to his right condition for seeing that close communion with God we're seeing that God but we want to give more fellowship amongst other churches sister churches we're seeing that father we thank you for it prayer for the sick which produces healing for the sick God we're seeing that and we're so grateful for it don't let these things just go over our heads but Lord let us really dysreflexia gave me this morning and reading the life of Joseph and just thinking how he sometimes we look at circumstances in situation we wonder how did we get here how did it happen like this but God you said where we are is right where you want us to be had Joseph not been where he was then it could not be raised to the position that you have for him so help us thought to accept and to walk by faith Lord in these places with you where you've called us to and to know Oh God that you're right there with us you promise never to leave us nor forsake us there's any hearted here God that does not does not know you an apartment of sin a
