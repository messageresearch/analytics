amen the lord praise the lord all right but i tell you what it's been a battle this morning uh but i i feel like anytime we have a battle like that god got something good and stolen and sometimes i think he might give the devil just a sneak peek right this was getting ready to happen see so satan just do everything he can to try to stop it but you know even with a sneak peek he can't stop it because what god got for you is for you blessed be the name of the lord amen he can fight but he won't win amen we thank god for victory um my just there was a scripture that that i was reminded of i'll have to save it for later time let me just do the announcements uh quickly um i i did want to uh just mention that uh we certainly had a wonderful time on last weekend and if there's uh any testimonies that have come forth uh from those services make sure you get those to us and man as soon as possible we want to just encourage the saints not just here but those that were online just encouraging how god moved we know god did something amen here in this place on last week so we are just looking forward to hearing thank you looking forward to hearing what what what uh what the

keep us informed and we'll continue to do everything we can to make your experience better uh as we are also on sundays we were doing the two services nine a.m and 12 p.m but on next sunday amen it's our desire to go back to our 10 30 service and have everybody welcome now praise the lord amen um we we've been away for a long time and uh and i believe uh you know the time is coming for for us to be able to get back together and and god got some things in store i told you guys on the other side of this and um you know i i believe what's on the other side of this is a new church and a new school and uh praise the lord and and my desire is not to go into the new church all us separated and can't enjoy the fellowship god doesn't provide it for us right so we ought to be able to to enjoy but as we as we come back i want to just make mention i want to reiterate the importance of us doing all the precautions amen uh necessary uh we don't want an outbreak we just don't want it god been good to us we haven't had an outbreak but i want to ask everybody please go above and beyond as we're bringing everybody back together we're going to continue to do monitoring amen with the temperatures we're going to continue to do um you know washing our hands and we will certainly be doing everything we can to keep the social distancing so uh some of you all have some favorite seats in here i'm gonna let you know that's gonna have to change amen we got to put families together uh you know and we're trying to do it in a way where we can keep social distancing so uh uh we're gonna use the entire church we use this part we'll use that part we're gonna use everything but uh we're gonna ask everybody please work with us um um somebody gonna be on the front row y'all might not like the front row but somebody gonna be on the front row you know so i'm just just letting us let you know that we got to make these changes in order to be able to accommodate and and our our goal is to try to get our saints amen all situated but we realize any any day visitors could come and the visitors come then you know the the ushers and the deacon they'll be they might have to have you hey would you please move would you do this would you do that and i need everybody just to just to put a smile on your face and act like you at chick-fil-a and say my pleasure praise the lord somebody amen my pleasure yes yes i will gladly move praise the lord we we're not necessarily returning back to normal it's a new normal right we we have to make adjustments to the new normal amen and and we have like i said we've been been been blessed by god we don't take this for granted we know it's been the hand of god that has watched over us through this time uh and as we're doing this again we want to just encourage if you're sick amen it's okay to stay home and stream if you've been around people that's sick it's okay to stay home and stream we just don't want an outbreak amen we don't want an outbreak and and if you're sick also call for prayer amen call for prayer don't just try to fight on your own but let's rebuke that devil amen faith sometimes i don't know people sick to they don't got out the hospital like what don't do that church just just call an actual prayer and you know let us let us do what we can for you amen through this season but starting next sunday next sunday we want to go back to the 10 30 service and um and then um you know we'll be doing all the social distance and all the hand washing we want to encourage you to wear your masks amen when you when you're inside the house we got a specialist we're bringing everybody back together please amen i just encourage you wear your mask i i would hate to hear one person in this church went down on our watch i just wouldn't want that to happen so let's do all we can not only just to protect yourself but protect those that are around you amen and that's what the masks really are for and i know sometimes they're very uncomfortable uh i got a couple masks that i wear and they're just uncomfortable so i know don't wear them in church find one that is comfortable that you can put on and you know you can just wear and just try to try to keep yourself safe and keep everybody else safe around you amen praise the lord amen amen i thank god for this he has been so good to us amen through this time uh last thursday we had our first day of outreach a man where we went and and handed out some food and it was a blessing i think we were able to serve about i don't know how many families but i know about 24-25 boxes of food were given out and that was with people not even knowing what was going on uh we feel like it's certainly gonna grow and and we're gonna have opportunity just to really touch some families here in our area so uh we'll be going back again this week uh the the uh the um the person that's over it uh there we're actually moving it from wednesday's or thursday but they ask us if we just do one wednesday serve amen and we're going to do that this week but then following that it will be on thursdays going forward it'll be a thursdays that will be out there if you desire to be a part of it let us know amen uh we would we would love to have you but i'll tell you you will sweat you might lose a few pounds amen working out there but uh but you know i think you'll also have an opportunity just to help somebody you know to be a help to some some family so uh we look we look forward to that amen let me just talk about our our giving amen and we'll pray over that and then we'll move forward in the service on today um uh other thing i forgot to mention i need to write these things down brother nathan had come and they were real blessing to us and um and so he was uh you know we were saying our goodbyes and god bless you and you know and and thank you for coming and then brother nathan said you know brother jack um we were having labor day meetings already planned it says and the speaker that i had lined up for labor day called me amen to tell me that they couldn't come and he says brother jack would you mind taking the labor day meeting for us uh we really appreciate it i said brother let me let me see what we can do and you know and just go from there let me just uh pray and see what what we can make happen so uh i decided to uh go forward with it and take his uh invitation and go on labor day and uh so i'll be going up and there's a few other saints my family a few other saints they'll be going uh it wasn't anything that's that's planned amen so uh if i'm telling the church because there might be you know opportunity if somebody else wanted to go certainly you can look into it and we'll just try to work with brother nathan on that but uh but just let you know for labor day we'll be going up amen to be with them in service um and just trusting the lord to just just meet us there in a very special way so i thank god for him coming and the way he came to be blessing us so i just feel like yes it's the right thing go back and and do what we can uh for them as well so keep us in prayer amen as we approach that in the next couple weeks praise the lord so our giving amen uh those that are watching online uh there's an opportunity for you to give a man through multiple online sources that is through paypal and through cash app if you choose to use cash app it was just the cash symbol spirit and truth t is our name uh cash symbol spiritual t is where you'll find us there in cash app if you use paypal we ask that you use give

keep the church afloat even during the midst of a pandemic amen god has been good and all of our needs have been met and we thank you for your your giving uh if you desire just to send something to mail say i ain't got the cash app i ain't got paypal but i i got mail you can do that you can send the spiritual tabernacle the address is there at the bottom of the screen amen 3951 heavy hill road suite 109 west palm beach florida three three four one seven you know one of these days is gonna be the last day i'm gonna give that address to this assembly one of these days i'm gonna say we had an update on the address hallelujah so you have to send it to a new address but i'm i'm under expectation that god gonna move on our behalf amen i i think one songwriter says already looking better amen it's already looking better he's already moving on our behalf so i'm i'm i believe that i believe that so let's pray amen over our giving at this time father we thank you for this privilege this opportunity we have to give for the work of the lord we pray that you use it god for the furthest of your kingdom thank you for your people lord jesus that have been faithful in their giving uh acts that you give back to them a hundredfold and lord everything that the devil has tried to take for them it may they uh maybe restore it back to a no god health and wealth and whatever it is god may be restored back to the people and father we just appreciate amen uh how you just continue to prove yourself to be jehovah jireh amen our provider even during the midst of this great pandemic we pray oh god that you continue to lead us and guide us and direct us as we take steps lord to bring the saints back together again and lord we you have watched over the congregation through this time and you're not you have not allowed the enemy amen to get a victory there's been some that have felt symptoms of god but when they've taken tests the test came back negative and we thank you for that oh god and we just pray that you just continue to watch over us that you continue to protect us and lord as we make adjustments to the new normal we're going to continue to walk by faith and not by sight believing that every promise that you've spoken over us will be fulfilled you told us a thousand amen may fall at our side and ten thousand at the right hand but it shall not come not our dwelling because we dwell in the secret place of the most high hallelujah we abide under the shadow of the almighty and father we just pray that you just continue lord to direct us in this great hour that we live bless your people fathers our prayer in jesus name we pray amen amen amen praise the lord all right thank you musicians i really appreciate you all hey man uh i was um we kind of had a little glitch there with the internet and all kind of things when we had a little power outage so uh i didn't get the update that i'm supposed to get here on my uh on my ipad uh so the lord knows all things but we're gonna preach by faith anyway amen and i mean i got some notes but not all the notes that i was supposed to have so god knows god knows all things amen so um i want to use a scripture today amen from matthew 17 now uh also just so that you all are aware i am um going off the path today and man you all know we've been in a journey uh and catch the vision and um you know stepping into that vision but i just felt led in my spirit to kind of go off the path today brother branham say sometime as you're driving down the road you have to go off the path to pick up some folk and then you get back on the path and keep going so amen i believe for today we'll just step off the path just a little bit and uh and maybe next week we may step off the path again for a little bit and but we're going to come back and finish amen our journey and uh catch the vision and step into it i think that was that's our inspiration for 2020 amen we're stepping into a vision glory to god and i'm going to it don't when it's a vision uh brother branham say that's that's that's pretty like perfect and complete when god give give the vision you're going you come into it no matter what is in your way you are coming into that vision i'm gonna just put it this way nothing can stop a vision nothing nothing can stop a vision right so once god gives you that we're coming to it so he gave the prophet a man a visitation by the angel lord and said pick up your pen and write this is for the bride for the church so i believe we as a people are coming into that place amen we're moving into it uh even as we're sitting here we're moving into this place that god had for us amen so uh this this morning i want to read from matthew 17 uh we'll start at verse 14 if you would just stand with me amen as we uh read the word of the lord praise the lord um the bible declares and when they were come to the multitude that came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying um lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic and so vexed for all times he followeth into the fire and off into the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him that's that's that's not a good testimony that they it was brought to some people they had confidence in but these folk couldn't do nothing for right they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you what statements how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me amen and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to jesus department said why could not we cast them out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall ye uh shall say unto this mountain remove hints to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you how be it this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray over the word of god father we are thankful uh for the ability to read scripture but we know the holy spirit that had the scripture to be uh written the same holy spirit that must come and quicken it uh to us that we would understand what it is that we read not only understand but that we would be able to apply it so help us god as we journey through this sermon today and may you just get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise out of the words that shared and god we take every spirit that is against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy spirit even right now in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you can be seated um i will start a man about reading a quote out of spiritual the spiritual food and due season our title amen is is pretty much coming out of this quote uh we're using the title built up in the faith for this hour amen built up in the faith for this hour praise god amen and you know the prophet makes a statement here uh in uh spiritual food and due season amen if you haven't listened to that in a while i'd encourage you to go back and listen to that it says this is it should be um paragraph three amen paragraph three uh in this uh it says this it says i know uh many of you are standing again tonight praise the lord it says and outside uh met groups that said they couldn't get in uh and and they they're listening to their radio in uh uh in the different cars and now we'll try to make justice as quick as we can tonight on sunday night it says we uh it says we go over to pray for the sick have a prayer line as we can get one up there but we are dedicating the service tonight for the prayer for the sick and this is the statement that he makes he says i'm down at paragraph four he says and i want you to get built up now hallelujah uh in the he said this this holy oracles of god and the faith the faith of this hour i want you to be built up now uh in the faith the faith of this hour glory to god it says the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be wrapped in faith amen to be taken up glory to god so we got to take time to build the church up in the faith for this hour amen we're facing things that we never faced before but we need amen we need the faith for this hour in order to overcome the things that we're facing hallelujah church glory to god amen it's going to take a rapture in faith brother branham said in one place if you ain't got faith for to to heal a headache how are you going to have faith to get your body changed come on somebody and then in order to get that kind of faith then that faith must be preached praise his holy name amen i believe the prophet laid certain things out there and as he laid it out there it's up to us to pick it up the holy spirit anoints us to pick it up and preach that back to the people amen and once we hear it because faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of god only glory to god not what cnn is saying amen not what nbc is saying amen not what fox news is saying not what fake news is saying we must hear the word of god in order for our faith to be built up for the hour in which we live all right church amen it says and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you've seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to kill to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be god or not amen i'ma stop there with that particular quote man we're looking for the to build a church up in the faith for this hour all right i'm going to this message ashamed amen ashamed the prophet makes another statement here that i want to just lay as our foundation hallelujah glory to god oh my i know that i had an update god just help me jesus amen amen all right he says this in the message of shame he says so his word has to live out for every generation now i i i want to uh uh uh just look at that amen it says it lived itself in the days of moses because in that day the bible said in hebrews the first chapter god and sundered times and died was manner spake to the fathers by the prophets now now brother branham is taking it back and he's saying the word has to live out in every generation the word has to live out you know uh there was a statement a quote that he says he says um uh uh here come that mandela so god gotta he'll put a a scripture there like he put the scripture for moses that you know a deliverer would come amen after 400 years and bring the people out of bondage so it said here come that man alone to fulfill that moses was that man to fulfill that we can look in scripture and see that god promised amen before the great and terrible day of the lord that he would send elijah the prophet here come brother branham along and fulfills that glory to god we can see amen in scripture where john the baptist was promised to come and here come john the baptist alone to fulfill that but he didn't stop with that statement he says also here come them people alone to live that glory to god amen in order for amen in order for god to sin of moses he had to have somebody on the earth that would believe moses in order for god to sin amen john the baptist he had to have some group of people on the earth that would believe john the baptist in order for god to fulfill malachi 4 revelation 10 god had to have a group of people on the earth that would believe that scripture here come them people alone to live it yes [Music] brother i'm here to live it amen god always amen his word has to live out live itself out for every generation it lived itself in the days of moses because in that day the bible said in hebrews first chapter god and sundered times and doubles manners spake to the fathers by the prophets adam did everything uh i so i just have to watch the time i left my time in the office everything all right y'all just bear with me i'm gonna stay on that time all right uh uh he says um it says uh and those prophets the church got all so twisted up that those prophets those daring messengers of god come without church without denomination without organization without anything defined kings amen kingdoms churches and everything when the priest was brought before they was brought before the priests they wasn't ashamed because they had directly thus saith the lord amen amen he says if you notice the the prophet in one sense of the word in the old testament when he said thus says the lord now watch him he goes right into the phrase oh this is the thing that really struck me he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of god now that's a prophet when a prophet is saying thus says the lord he's going right into the place of taking the place of god hallelujah you notice when he placed out before him thus saith the lord he fell right into god when a prophet not steps out and says that saith the lord that prophet has fallen right into god i want you to stay with me here church glory to god he says and he acted as god then he gave his message which god which was god speaking through him thus saith the lord now see now you know and and and i'm i'm not gonna leave it at a prophet now y'all know me amen i'm gonna give you some other things to help us see amen the faith but inside was not just the prophet but it's also in the bride right amen but but understanding that the same god that was in a prophet that when a prophet is standing out there saying thus saith the lord he has stepped into the place of god amen he's acting on god's behalf hallelujah amen god is pretty much saying whatever that man say is gonna be just like he said oh hallelujah church amen i i i like this i like this so amen let's let's try to build a church up in the faith for this hour now um i want to go with it with another quote out of spiritual food and due season amen and maybe maybe uh we'll catch something over here in scripture amen let me just uh line something up glory to god glory to god amen over here in first kings hallelujah glory glory amen um all right uh let's line up something here in first king 17. let's just let's just read this now uh so this this statement that brother branham was making that a prophet when he stand out there with us saith the lord he's taken the place of god now i want to just show you here in scripture first kings 17 where this actually took place hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen uh this uh is a prediction or a prophecy of a drought oh my my my my my glory it says in elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be do nor rain the these years but according to according to my word now can you see this man that's why brother branham said they were bold when they stood before kings and and whoever whatever government that they had to step they were born when they stood there say look it's not gonna even rain until i call for it right not not pretty much what he's saying y'all ain't no sense of y'all praying for rain ain't no sense of y'all fasting for rain it will not ring jesus until i speak it now god himself is the one that controls the ring so where was god dwelling inside this prophet the prophet had become one with the word and i'm telling you the bride has become one with the word amen oh jesus we built up for the faith for this hour amen amen now you know we we know uh as we we read the story they went through this great famine and three three years three and a half years they went through this famine and and then he had this mighty showdown on mount carmel and uh and after the mighty showdown uh then then god sent the rain after three and a half years it didn't come until elijah prayed for it till elijah asked for it right i mean it's just uh and brother branham said he was typing in spiritual food and do season he's typing elijah amen to us today he said i want to use this as a type for the church today so we got to find ourselves in scripture now let's pick up another quote here spiritual food and due season amen here in uh paragraph 60 we'll hear this time oh yes lord glory glory glory glory amen so it says uh now we see that modern trend of the people uh then all the days have passed there's no such thing as miracles the people are all emotionally worked up listen to that elijah the prophet cry out against them and their theologians notice he spoke as if he was god himself amen he says elijah spoke as if he was god himself now i just like even the angle that brother branham puts on that scripture i mean there's people reading this scripture today preaching from it amen but maybe not catching that angle brother branham say elijah spoke as if he was god himself oh glory hallelujah he says uh uh the dew will not fall from heaven until i called for it amen yes sir the prophet had been so long in the presence of god amen the prophets of the old testament or any time when they live in the presence of god until they become the word hallelujah i'm telling it's not just for prophets we have become the word hallelujah amen their message is the word itself and remember he said thus saith the lord and when those men had those messages from god they become so wrapped up amen that their own thinking it might have been against their thinking they might not have been able to see it right but they will speak in the word of god thus saith the lord hallelujah there will not be any rain till i called for oh what a statement he had been in the presence of god and been vindicated so perfect and remember that also follows amos 3 7 the lord god will do nothing until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets said there's not going to be any rain for amen and and elijah spoke this now i want to just just just just hit that little statement where it says it might even be against their own thinking can you imagine a man when isaiah goes out and prophesies it says a virgin shall conceive amen it's against his own thinking something like this has never happened but but because he's so wrapped up in the word hallelujah because he's so connected to the word and this is this is amen one of our problems amen today can i just say it this way we're we're more connected to social media than we are to the world we're more connected to the news than we are to the words amen oftentimes when i hear people talk i hear him telling me what the news person said i hear him telling me what this person said but i never hear them quote one scripture hallelujah church amen we went to connected to many too many things in this world we got to get ourselves reconnected to the word of god hallelujah quote the word of god speak the word of god become the word of god i'ma tell you i can't trust too many sources amen but i can trust god's word amen this is this ain't fake news right here this this is the real deal i can trust the word of god all right hey man it goes on here in another little statement actually i'll leave that amen out i'll leave that i he made the you know he's saying how this man is taking the place of god you know when when when he's when he's speaking uh he has he's standing there with a with an opportunity amen he's so wrapped up in god and and and just so so so connected that when he step out on the inspiration it's as if god himself was coming out and a man speaking hallelujah glory to god was like god himself was coming through that man now now i i want to be able to show you even in brother branham's ministry that he also had the opportunity to take the place of god now remember um the scriptures say uh that he was gonna send elijah the prophets amen before the great and terrible day of the lord so now now if that that spirit is coming again it will manifest similar things if elijah in the scripture can stand up and say it will not reign until i call for it amen then that same anointing would be able to come upon a man and we see some of these same things manifested in his ministry hallelujah glory to god i was reminded of a a situation that happened in brother manuel's ministry i won't take time to read it but if you ever wanted to go back and and hear him tell the testimony about it it's in the message speak uh to this mountain and he was just telling the story of how the angel lord had warned him it says there's a big trap set for you hey man there's a there's a big trap set for you now now it's one thing for the angel lord to tell you that it's a big trap but amen i guess the other part is why won't you tell me what the trap is hallelujah you tell them it's a big trap and if you know it's a trap tell me what the trap is so i'll be prepared for it but see god wants you to walk by faith and not by sight so he won't explain everything to you amen because he's trying to pull something out of you he would not explain this to the prophet because he was trying to pull something out of the prophet i am only going to let you know there's a big trap set for you saying okay all right lord i don't know what's going on so it's headed to some meetings and as he was going to the meetings amen he thought to himself like he said something's going to happen here and i don't know what it's going to be but something's going to happen it's a big trap for me he didn't know what what to expect and as he was sitting in the meeting preaching the word of god there's two young people a young man and a young one a young woman they just start uh making making love right there in front of everybody brother branham said please stop that you he say what you're doing is pulling all the attention off of me preaching the word and putting it on you say please don't do that and and the young man he said a young man looked at him and just laughed at him it says he kept preaching the young man got worse and worse he said please don't do that young man please he said you know y'all if it's that you know that bad y'all need to go get a room somewhere amen but don't do that in the house of god this is the house of god don't do that hey hey hey hey hey man that's why you know glory to god sometimes you go to churches and people be all hugged up on each other and no that's not the time to do that i'm going to tell you something else when you see that in a family that show that there's no affection at home that i'm going to tell you that i'm gonna just be honest with you it shows that defection does not take place at home the affection only takes place here at the house house of the lord something wrong with that picture it's a truth in it how amen glory to god i come here to worship i come here to praise god amen there's a time and place for everything and this ain't the time this ain't the place all right church glory to god but here that here the young man is all hooked up on this young lady and now they're making out you know in the church and brother man said stop don't do that i say i actually young man don't do that and so he's the young man kept laughing at him so say all of a sudden just got real quiet and brother branham pierced his eyes and some people say when brother branham sometimes would look at you a certain way it's like he can look right through your soul and he looked at the young man and it just just it just got quiet the young man was just sitting there looking at brother in like what's going to happen now and he said brother i'm saying heard a voice say just just uh just just just smite him dead right here he said because say the angels say they're in your hands whatever you say they are in your hands so whatever you say it's going to be just like you said taking the place of god right so so he say uh he said he sat there oh glory to god he said then had to pause for a listen say say just smite him blind smite him dead he had all kind of thoughts flowing through his head he said but before he could say anything before he could let anything at his mouth he said i forgive you jesus let me tell you something this kind of power is controlled by motive and objective hallelujah amen brother branham even told us in in one little spot here let me see if i can i'll just bring this in really quick it says uh character is a victory a man not a gift a man without character can't ring because power apart from character is satanic glory to god but power with character is fit to rule this big trap for the prophet was trying god wanted to see how he was going to respond with that kind of power i want to tell you something god is also watching how you're going to respond with the power that he's giving you here he's stood in the place of god to be able to pronounce death or life over this couple he pronounced life some of us we we're so so so so so uh adamant about having power but we ain't got no character that's why god can't give it to us you would kill everybody as soon as soon as people do something against what you want to do they dead praise the lord in your heart it's the truth anyhow amen amen your actions prove that your actions prove that your character's not lined up with the power that god won't entrust you with all right let me go a little further brother branham also had another spot where he stood in the place of god and i want to read this i want to take time to read this one amen uh uh today uh i think it's important but when he preached a marriage marriage and when he preached a message marriage and divorce he was standing in the place of god just like elijah was standing in the place of god the prophet himself found himself standing in the place of god now look at this look at this who is this melchizedek amen is where uh where we're going and uh and then i'll come back to marriage and divorce but who is this melchizedek he says this says now i just want to comment just a moment on the morning's message the morning's message was married to divorce it says i want to comment amen on this morning's message now now i need you to understand according to marriage and divorce one of the great truths that the prophet brought out amen is that a minister must marry a virgin amen this is one of the great truths that he brought out hallelujah but also amen he took the people back to levitical law and he presented this truth that had been covered in scripture for years but the prophet gave us light on this but he also knew that when he brought this truth to the church he said so many folk gonna be so messed up they're not gonna know what to do so he had to wait on god to get an answer from god as to how he was going to present this to the people so first he gave them levitical law hallelujah but at the end of the sermon he brought some grace and some people fail to hear the grace that's broken hallelujah standing in the place of god watch this now watch this amen says now i just want to comment just a moment on the morning's message there's no doubt i didn't get completely through with it and i see so he left some things even unsaved i didn't get completely through with it but i think you understand you got to catch it spiritually it says and i'm sure you i'm sure you didn't look at that statement i didn't get completely through with it but i think you understand and then and i'm sure you didn't hallelujah so where you find yourself glory it says you'll never know what that was for me to do he says now it seems very simple to you but you see what you're doing you are taking the place of god to pronounce something that is what the prophet's saying say i'm taking the place of god to pronounce something i watch this he says and before i would do that it had to come an answer from god and he had to come down he visibly showed himself and gave the revelation that so therefore see this is to the church this ain't for everybody glory to god this same for everybody hey man if you can't handle it it's not for you but this is for the church glory to god and remember i said these this is what i said was to the church only and so that you might have confidence and no that was the same god that said to me up there there was no squirrel speak and say where they'll be and three straight times it happened now if he can if he can by that same word create something that isn't there how much more will this whole fast at the day of judgment see people were there to see these things and know as paul said in days gone by there was man with him who felt the earth shake and did hear the voice but they seen the pill of fire now let's go let's keep on reading in this statement he says it done me good though after it was over after he preached the marriage of marriage and divorce after it was over it was a tough message and he says but after it was over how can the people get to this place after a tough message like that unless they actually received the grace that was brought in the message you know before this message marriage and divorce was preached brother random say it'll be men he said he had a man on his on his front porch asking the question should i leave or should i stay with her he said brother please don't do nothing until i get back and preach the sermon the man had no idea what to do with this truth hallelujah it's like a little baby with a gun you wouldn't give it to them they don't know how they don't understand they don't understand the power behind all that glory to god so so when this truth came people i mean it just it revolutionized everybody's thinking let me just let me just read the quote let me read the quote look at this he says it dummy good though afterwards over to see husbands and wives that i know is genuine christians hugging one another and weeping he says and listen friends god confirms his word with signs and vindications to prove that it's right the spoken word now remember that light was it the light that was in that cloud that gave the revelation says my little girl was telling me sarah here when i say the school there in arizona was looking up there on a cloudless sky and seeing this cloud mysteriously in that mountain going up and down god had witnesses watching the cloud going up and down the mountain and while the cloud was there was the voice of god coming to the prophet giving him what to say to the people letting him as a prophet represent god amen take the place of god oh i don't even know if i'm gonna finish this today but let me i got i got i got i just want to say i just i gotta say this thing a prophet can stand there and take the place of god amen because he and the word becomes one now you gotta be able to receive that from a prophet watch this now he says uh say this that school there in arizona was looking up there on the cloudless sky seeing this cloud mysteriously in that mountain going up and down with an amber fire burning in it the teacher dismissed the classes and the school and brought them out front said did you ever see anything like that look the way of the way that's there remember that's that same amber light that's on the rock so it's the same god same revelation said tell them to do this it was uh is what i told you this morning so there it is now let me go let me go on it says if it happens to me that my good friend brother roy robertson is listing that listening in at tucson so brother roy roberson was not at church can we put it this way brother roy roberson was streaming he had to catch the revelation of what god was saying through the prophet i'm telling you even on the stream right now somebody has caught the revelation of what god has spoke to as prophet because that prophet was taking the place of god [Applause] all right let me go a little further let me just read the quote amen it says if if it happens to be that my good friend brother roy roberson is listening in at tucson roy you remember the other day the vision you sing when we were out standing upon the mountain you come up to me and that cloud was over the top come walking down you know what he told you and i told you at the house the other day that's it roy don't worry no more son it's over he wasn't there in the church to hear that but he heard it on the stream i can imagine brother roy just shouting all over his house he wasn't even able to see the problem he just had to listen audio i can imagine him shouting because he's probably free from something that had him bothered for years he said it's over when a prophet says it's over man it's over yes it is i ain't gonna have no more mind battles over it i ain't gonna worry about it because the prophet said it was over and that prophet is taking the place of god then what i'm trying to tell you when that prophet is giving you thus saith the lord is just like god himself spoke that to you god says it's over all right i'm going further it says you just don't know what that means it's grace he loves you and you love him humbly serve him and worship him the rest of your days be happy go ahead go ahead and live as you are hallelujah if you're happy now now somebody might take it and say well i ain't happy glory to god i ain't happy so i'm gonna go ahead no no no no no no you better recognize this grace that god has given you and don't make grace a disgrace it says if you're happy continue that way don't never do anything wrong again like that just go ahead it's god's grace now i just couldn't leave you there i had to take time and read this part today if y'all don't mind i want to go back now to marriage and divorce so you understand what he was referring to amen this was coming at the end of the sermon so you know we we listen to the front of the sermon we listen to the beginning sermon we're like oh my i mean it's a this is a tough one especially if you've been married and divorced it's a tough sermon it's a tough sermon and uh but but nonetheless it's truth god had to use the prophet to bring truth back to the people you know if we don't hear truth then our family is going to be all messed up just being honest our families remember god needs some generation to start living according to his word right because the scripture actually said god hate divorce god actually hate it amen it's one thing if there's one thing god hate divorce is one of them hallelujah but you know oh lord i don't know i'm just i'm gonna be all over the place lord i'm gonna just have to do it last last week we had a brother here at the church and i just encourage y'all go listen to his testimony he came here last week i didn't even know what what the brother's testimony was and he was talking about how him and his wife was just going through so much you know in their marriage and how they were on the brink of divorce in the message you know him living outside the house and eventually you know the wife let him come back and live in the basement in the house and you know he just living down there he said just just so much that was going wrong in their marriage he couldn't see it he couldn't understand he didn't realize 99 of the problem of the marriage was him he thought it was his wife but one day god shined the light on him and he could see his error right and once he saw his error then he's able to repent and go make things white write with his wife and make things right with his daughter and he said you know the problem is he says uh we're in the message we talk you know divorce is wrong he said but there are real problems that hit marriage they say and unfortunately there is no church message church that actually helps people with their problems in in marriage he said i had to go to denominational church and get assistance for my marriage i say that's wrong we we ought to be able to minister to the whole person praise the lord right and and my my heart just began to kind of bleed i said lord we got to do better right we got to do things better right here even in our own church we got to be able to minister to hurting couples sometimes people come here and they put on a good show glory to god i just gave you some insight and i hope y'all don't don't don't pick at people y'all see them all hooked up on each other oh you remember what brother jack say they ain't hugging each other don't do that to people what you ought to be doing like you know hey god bless you everything good maybe we should get together for some fellowship we should just get together for some fellowship sometime you been brother steven last week if you just listen to the end of his sermon how he went down individually by individual how we can help one another we ought to we ought to felt conviction on that god i can do better than what i'm doing right now marriages need help people are holding on by thread god don't like divorce but how can we help people help keep people away from divorce amen and and we got to tell our children god hates divorce i don't care what they going through in their marriage god hates divorce it's right in the book of malachi glory to god god hates it so so so tell the children the truth and this is what we got to do share with our children the truth yes brother branham brought the truth of amen a minister should marry a virgin we gotta teach that in the church we gotta say things like that so sisters keep yourself now it don't it don't don't mean that every sister gonna marry a preacher it don't mean that but still keep yourself right hallelujah and as a brother he has to know that before he gets into marriage glory to god it's the truth anyhow amen i've had many conversations with brothers before they got married amen and they would tell you some of the things i had to say to him amen i have to do that because we got to teach our children all right i'm going to read the rest of this quote that's why i i i this might be a part two the lord knows all things look at this this is the marriage and divorce this is where when they say you you didn't understand i was taking a place with god and saying something now brother branham didn't just step up there to take the place of god he had to have a supernatural experience with god before he would even release words like this and he says what happened while they were in the mountain while he was in the mountain praying over the sermon marriage and divorce say the angel lord came into the mountain just going up and down like a pill of fire his daughter in school saw not just her but the kids in her class was out for recess at the time and they could see the angel lord going up and down the mountain the light just going up and down they knew something was going on brother brad would come out the mountain went to a gas station uh brother ronnie was at the gas station brother branham you was just over there praying weren't you he says no brother i went over there he said i could show you the spot where you was at you was over there prancing aw brother and brother brown said he told him that just to kind of throw him off he said he said no brother that now he said brother branham we watched it from right here that there was a supernatural being just going up and down the mountain in that spot in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established the children in school saw it brother ronnie saw brother branham say so after that and after what the angel told him he knew he had the freedom to come out and say this yes he brought us to levitical law but then they took us to grace and some people want to keep you in the law they want to keep you in the law amen but there is some grace hallelujah and i'ma tell you i want grace and let me tell you something you ain't gonna get grace and then not give it hallelujah somebody right i mean you want it all for yourself you can have it but nobody else can know the same grace that covers you covers me too [Music] all right church we gotta understand these things yes there's a truth to this now you know and i'm gonna just go bo boley and say this i've i've talked to particular brothers about this situation privately and i would just tell them say now uh i'm sharing with you what the prophet said about marrying a woman that's a virgin i'm sharing with that this is what the prophet said this is the word of god so now if you choose after we've had this conversation to go out and still get married don't come back talk about you got a calling on your life i say after we've had the conversation i hope you catch it i'm gonna let you read between the lines i'ma let you read between the lines can i read marriage and divorce says friends then i'm closing you can go from this that's when this was being revealed to me he says what i'm gonna tell you right now so don't miss it now i'm speaking to our followers only glory who is following me and this message only not the outside i ain't speaking to them on the outside and he says bear me record of this before god just to this group only man i see there's another thing that we could put we could we can take the whole marriage and divorce sermon and only give it to branham tabernacle if you take the quote literally that's only for branham tabernacle but no i believe i'm identified with the prophet that god sent so i accept it amen look at this it says now we've now we are found in this mess y'all ain't gonna let me preach we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology and let me tell you people still got misinterpreted theology [Applause] he says um hallelujah they say is that right that's why you women married the second time and you men because misinterpreted theology says now i want to show you something that he told me i'm gonna tell you how serious this was i'm just you know just just just just hold on there in um the message uh questions and answers on the holy ghost i'm sorry questions and answers just questions answers conduct order and doctrine um i believe there's a question that somebody asked about uh if a person was divorced would they be able to make the rapture and brother adam would say now you know i don't know i don't know i mean divorce i can't see it i don't know i'm just i'm just not sure i just can't see that and you know he was just kind of going going along those lines and just trying to stay with the word but as he was looking at it i think god eventually began to show him that it's a predestinated that will go and last week brother nathan brought out a statement he say there's only one um unpardonable sin that's blaspheming the holy ghost he says but divorce was not an unpardonable sin hallelujah the grace of god can still cover people in that so so brother branham might he might have answered that question early but now coming on 1965 before he leaves the sin you got to keep following that prophet now because the revelation is progressive come on church amen it progresses glory to god even jesus grew in knowledge the bible said that that means he was progressing and if jesus progressed you're gonna have to progress all right and if it's not for you he already told us this message is only for the church all right now now now now now i believe the grace of god certainly will allow a person that's been divorced to make the rapture i believe that grace is that powerful amen see we just you know i was on the law too i was under law i was under law uh even when it come to dedicating babies that's been born out of wedlock because in the old testament generations couldn't come to church 10 generations didn't even do nothing wrong i would just i just happened to be born in in this family i didn't even make a choice to be born in this family but i'm punished because i'm born in this family but grace has covered that they said what we got to do sometimes as churches amen is be able to kind of get over to the great side we we got the law we can we can pinpoint that thing the laws say this but where is grace and not that i'm trying to exclude the law i got to teach the law but how do we get people into grace watch this now i'm going further look at what the prophet says it says uh because misinterpreted theology i want to show you something that he told me and if god our creator was questioned the question when he was here on earth jesus christ because he had some questions about marriage and divorce that he answered and when his when his delivering prophet came forth moses all right uh moses down in egypt to bring the children out of egypt to put them in the promised land jesus said here that moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was moses found such as let him suffer god permitted moses the prophet sent to the people to grant this writing of divorce meant to them glory he says and in first corinthians the seventh chapter the 12th and 15th verse in the new testament of the new testament prophet paul who met the same thing in the church and spoke this this is i not the lord he's taken the place of god this is i not the lord that's right because of the divorce condition it wasn't so from the beginning but moses was permitted it and god recognized it what moses said god recognized it righteousness and what i'm trying to tell you if god recognized what moses said as righteousness god also gonna recognize what his prophet william marian branham says as righteousness amen oh lord have mercy jesus sometimes you preach things like this and you know everybody want to go free but you still got to have a gift and all kind of other things hey man you just don't get up and just do things if you ain't got no gift what you're doing you're wasting people time find your place in the body and operate in that do it faithfully and the other thing i want to like i said last week my brother stephen don't don't don't don't you know now you get a quote and now you just take off running but what you've been doing before the quote what you doing before the quote how faithful are you before the quote i said that brother was faithful as a sunday school teacher faithful as a song leader he found things that he could do where he was not hindered and he did him faithfully until god called him more now i'm not saying his situation is just i i don't know his situation but i do know this anybody feel like they got a call and you should already see something some faithfulness i can say that you just don't did we not looking for the one-hit wonders overnight overnight yeah it don't work like that you know you know you a quick investment get people jumping and shouting we adam been in church and i haven't seen them kind of testimonies i mean about it god delivered them last week from this and and man i was on drugs and i was this and god set me free and the whole church is oh glory hallelujah three months later he's out developing another testimony and ready to bring it back to the church no we don't want to hear it this time sit there praise god and live something now let your life be your testimony okay uh it wasn't so from beginning but moses permitted it god recognizes righteousness and paul also had a right a right these are these are some some tough words paul had a right now you just mean a lot doesn't mean a lot it should mean a lot to the bride because when brother brandon went to the other side and he um and and he saw you know all these people say and say god bless you my brother god bless you the angels say oh these are your converse they say all these brandon said no no these are your converts it's a converts he says yes they say say well um say they're going to be you know he said you can't see jesus now but one day you'll be taken to the level where you can see him he says paul here he said yeah is his group here yeah he said will paul be judged by the things that he preached and said yeah you're going to be judged by the things you preach he said well i preached the same thing paul preached and you know who said amen the saints millions said we are resting on that now i'm gonna go a little further i'ma just go a little further because i come from god and i'm going back to god i believe i was part of the millions i believe i was right there as part of the millions that said we're resting on that all right let's go can we go further i ain't finished reading the quote i ain't finished reading the quote so let's finish let me find my spot it says paul also had a right when he found his church in that condition now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from god and by the vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far glory should not god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing moses was permitted on the mountain paul permitted on the backside of the desert brother branham happened to be on a mountain in the desert taking the place of god now that really was my that was my title this morning taking the place of god but i said i want to kind of do something else a little different uh i thought i would get to this part a little faster but it just ain't happening amen god know why so uh let's go on he says uh it says uh uh now you believe this to be true and believe it come from god and the vindication of this cloud and this message that's brought me this far should not god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more he says go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again i'm speaking only to my congregation but if you're married and god bore me witness of that on the mountain that i could say this is a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seven seals and this is a question in god's word let them go on in as they are and sin no more that ain't levitical law that's grace let them go on in as they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that is right it wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions as god's servant i won't call myself his prophet but i believe maybe i would have been sent for that i'm laying a ground for him when he does come so under the modern conditions look at this i command a commandment a commandment i mean i'm talking on the level thou shall not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not commit adultery commandments ten of them here's a prophet says i command come on i command you to go to your home with your wife now don't talk about putting away go back to your house with your wife now under modern condition stay the way you are look at it he says if you are happy with her live with her raise your children and admonition of god but god be merciful to you if you do if you ever do that again you teach your children never to do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of gods i tell you what i have taken this seriously we and i know earlier in my ministry we did a lot of talking with the youth talking with the youth talking with the youth and i made sure that they they knew certain things amen and and i'm i'm so grateful to see many of the young ladies that was coming up underneath this church they kept themselves and still keeping themselves amen i appreciate that and i know god will bless them for it i taught the young men in this church too i know i did amen and i'll continue to teach them glory to god amen uh i'm interested in sister we're gonna have a conversation oh yeah we're gonna talk some things i may not come out here and tell everybody but me and that brother and most brothers that had to go through and get married we've had conversations sometimes there's some very unique situations glory to god but most of the time i had that conversation sometimes the conversation been so uh i have to be so real amen that it had i seen it impact some of them they lose their faith that's not that's not that's not for you to lose your faith that's to protect you and i and i was commanded to tell the children not to do it do it a certain way so i've done that amen i won't come every sunday and read this quote i won't read it i will live it praise the lord but i felt it was important because we talked about taking the place of god there was i mean elijah stood there it ain't gonna rain until i called for it now that same annoying to his own brother branham and now he's he's taking the place of god when he's pronouncing marriage and divorce that same anointing glory to god look at this it says you teach your children never to do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of god and now that you are as you are let us go now at the late evening hour that we're living in and press towards the mark of the high calling in christ where all things will be possible until i see you tonight the lord bless you while we pray those were his closing statements to one of the most difficult sermons that was ever preached marriage and divorce but i told you we had the levitical part everybody got that but we also need to see where he brought the grace in at the very end hallelujah and there's people that can walk in that grace all right all right i i i had a question is it only for profits but i can't i don't think i'm gonna be able to get to that amen i think i'm gonna have to bring this back as a part two and um and just kind of carry us a little further in this i i i i i i just believe that we want to build the church up amen in the faith for this hour it's going to take a little bit more than what we have had hey man we got a god got something else for us to walk in now i i i'm going to bring i'm going to answer this question i'm not going to answer it was that only for the prophets for them to stand and take the place of god was that only for the prophets moses had it glory to god amen we saw it in brother branham's ministry uh paul even had it you know but but but what's that only for the prophets i'm just already tell you no no no no no no no i'm just giving you a little sneak peek with a little statement when a spirit born is that enough when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart see he becoming one with the word right and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking and it didn't stop they say every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man so i'm gonna leave it at the prophet there's more quotes in here i gotta go further but god knows what he's saying god knows what he's doing god bless you god bless you [Applause] part two will be coming amen let's pray let's pray father we thank your god for your word thank you for your truth scripture tells us that we will know the truth and the truth will make us free so lord as we just look at just some things here in scripture and look at you lord how you manifested yourself through your prophet we can connect the dots you said i i think you understand but i'm sure you don't lord you know people just wouldn't catch it you knew it but yet lord there would be a small percentage that would walk lord according to the grace that was given and not trying to make grace a disgrace but oh god they would begin to realize amen what what it really means to have mercy what it really means to have grace god they offer that to others lord it's our desire here not to be off the word we want to be on the word we want to we want to walk according to the word of god we want to keep it balanced properly and god we got to have the right balance when it comes to to this message i think sometimes because we've been out of balance we have destroyed many people we've hurt many people along the way and some that just they can't they can't break free from lord these prisons that they're in in their mind because of the way things was presented to them god our prayer is that you would just allow them to see the complete picture yes we see law we got it it's right there in leviticus we see it but under modern conditions the prophet was told to declare something something lord that um we couldn't necessarily say that we find it just like that in scripture but yet he was taking the place of god a supernatural revelation was given to him and god he gave it to us now it's up to us to do with that and take that and use that the proper way help us to have the right motive and the right objective help us check our hearts god that we wouldn't do anything or say anything lord that would bring this grace to you god we thank you for your word thank you for your truth it's in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord uh brother solomon i'll have you come and just close the service out amen today and amen um like i said church we will pick up a man on this uh i got some more that i want to just bring to you so next week amen we'll go into this a little bit a little bit more just to try to show you who you are amen and this the lord bless you the lord keep you amen and we'll see you for the 12 o'clock service amen will you stand to your feet amazing grace how sweet the sound i once was lost but now i'm

truth father as our pastor just said lord we all know the law father the law put us all in jail it showed us that we were sinners lord god there was no way for us to come out lord of the other cell lord that the law had placed us in [Music] father god but you came down and provided grace and father our hearts can only bleed because of the grace given to us lord and we're so grateful for father we come this morning we thank you lord it's all by your grace predestination is by your grace lord father but we want to extend grace lord father grace isn't deserved lord it's something that's given freely lord god and as it was given to us there was a price paid lord that only you could pay for them we freely receive it lord may we also freely give it lord when we see our brothers and sisters struggling lord god father may we not kick them lord but bring them before the throne of grace lord and cry out and intercede for them lord because they are needy people just as we are lord father we can't exhaust your grace and we don't want to frustrate your grace but we always want to provide grace and give grace to those in need father we pray for our pastor this morning lord god as he dove into your word lord and brought forth something lord to free us all from guilt lord and give us an understanding lord god that we must not hammer people lord with the law but if we tell them a truth

in the sanctuary this morning lord help us all to walk in grace lord to walk in the light and look through the eyes of the lord jesus christ those bloody eyes on the cross that can look at a center
