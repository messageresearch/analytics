[36:46] praise some Jesus name we pray amen amen
[36:49] you can be seated
[36:51] I got another scripture that will read
[36:54] in a little bit but just for a little
[36:57] tough topic tonight a man send the word
[37:01] a man sin the word praise the Lord a man
[37:08] we we want to just kind of talk about
[37:10] that I'll just start by reading a man a
[37:15] little quote here from the Prophet
[37:17] either the message the endtime sign seat
[37:21] he's making a comment here and it says
[37:24] when we see God heal a man here a few
[37:29] days ago in our church I give out I was
[37:32] going to preach there on a Sunday last
[37:35] Sunday a week it is now a week from last
[37:36] Sunday says they brought a little girl
[37:39] and they're on a stretcher and they
[37:42] called me in the night
[37:44] on the road and see if the girl cannot
[37:47] live the caster was so bad about 17
[37:51] years old she can't even get there right
[37:54] she's going to die
[37:57] before she gets there it says it was a
[37:59] pitiful case a lovely little child of
[38:02] seventeen years old to prove something
[38:05] to my church I love what the Prophet
[38:07] says here to prove something to my
[38:09] church I never touched the child at all
[38:13] never laid hands on her right never
[38:15] touch the child at all says I never
[38:18] asked as much as touched her I walked in
[38:22] laying on a stretcher of course there
[38:25] was other sick people but I was
[38:26] concerned about the child to catch her
[38:29] spirit when I spoke to her and she
[38:31] seemed like a very fine little girl I
[38:34] see no reason why that child should feel
[38:37] a premature grief and that has to be the
[38:41] devil trying to take her life he goes
[38:45] home since so I'll never touch the child
[38:47] at all went right to the pulpit with the
[38:51] word and stayed right with the word and
[38:55] the word healed her so instantly until
[38:59] she got up and walked away
[39:01] never even prayed for I never even
[39:05] touched them just preach the word and
[39:09] the girl got up and walked away now
[39:11] before she heard the word they were
[39:13] saying that the girl couldn't make it to
[39:15] the service hallelujah so it's the
[39:18] environment that we said right that
[39:20] creates all the problems that people
[39:23] have
[39:23] they maybe they had an environment of
[39:26] doubt but when they got into an
[39:27] atmosphere where the word was being
[39:29] preached and presented the girl called
[39:31] faith in the Word of God and got up and
[39:34] walked out hallelujah he goes home said
[39:37] as he said sorry I said instantly until
[39:40] she got up and walked away is all right
[39:43] now
[39:43] living like anybody else can't find the
[39:46] trace of it anywhere never even touch
[39:49] touch touch touch touch that touched her
[39:52] see the word went for and she believes
[39:55] the word and the word is God's life and
[39:59] God's power was and the word is what
[40:03] does it are we understanding that hey
[40:07] you don't need nobody to touch me the
[40:09] word is gonna do this if God made a
[40:12] promise
[40:13] amen then that promise has got to come
[40:16] to pass
[40:17] hallelujah oh my gotta be careful when I
[40:20] say things like this think man I mean we
[40:23] thank God for the doctor we think God
[40:25] for every profession but if God give me
[40:27] a promise in this world I'm expecting
[40:29] the world to do what needs to be done
[40:33] somebody the word has the power the word
[40:37] has the anointing and imma just i'ma
[40:40] just say this imma get out ahead of
[40:42] myself
[40:43] you know we keep sending the word it's
[40:45] just like sending Jesus himself
[40:47] oh come on somebody
[40:50] Amen I got a little statement brother
[40:53] Graham say he say God and His Word is
[40:55] the self-same being God and His Word is
[41:00] the self-same P and when I heard that I
[41:03] say well the word is a being the word is
[41:07] a person amen in the beginning was the
[41:10] word and the Word was God and the Word
[41:14] was with God and the word became flesh
[41:18] and dwelt among us over you sinan the
[41:22] world you sit in a person the person of
[41:26] the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah in any
[41:30] time Jesus is present things are gonna
[41:33] change
[41:34] situations are gonna
[41:36] it cannot stay the same with the word is
[41:39] present whatever situation you're

[41:56] [Applause]
[42:03] promised so much a man never give you
[42:08] problem give the devil a promise to that
[42:12] situation the line is the power the line
[42:16] is the anointing the word is the
[42:19] difference

[43:06] matter what it is that you're facing if
[43:08] it's a sickness of the box and your body
[43:10] got you sing you are the Lord my God
[43:13] that healeth all my diseases that's what
[43:18] you say and if you said that I know your
[43:21] word can't fail glory hallelujah
[43:25] somebody
[43:26] send the words alright alright alright
[43:30] let me just read a little bit here a man
[43:33] ain't man this is coming out of the
[43:36] message questions and answers on the
[43:38] Holy Ghost glory to God the Prophet
[43:41] makes a statement says now look if I
[43:43] want to go back to Ephesians the first
[43:44] chapter first chapter the pop preacher
[43:46] now the Corinthians each one had a
[43:48] tongue and a song you noticed the other
[43:50] churches didn't have that trouble he
[43:52] never said nothing about it he did he
[43:54] did he ever mentioned tongues anywhere
[43:56] in the Ephesian Church the Roman Church
[43:59] know they had tongues and everything
[44:01] just like the Corinthians did but they
[44:04] had it set in order
[44:06] it says the Corinthians just couldn't
[44:08] get get it in order to see but Paul went
[44:11] down there and set the church in order I
[44:14] believe it's all Robert says God's a
[44:17] good car don't you believe that and you
[44:19] say well what about the Pentecostals
[44:22] with the tongues then brother Brad I
[44:24] think they got the Holy Ghost sure they
[44:26] did all right why look you believe he's
[44:29] a good god Thomas said one time you know
[44:31] Lord all that arrested him believed him
[44:33] said oh we know we know he's real Oh
[44:36] Thomas said no no I don't believe it the
[44:39] only way I believe it I'll have to have
[44:42] some evidence I'll have to stick my
[44:45] fingers in his side and in the prints of
[44:48] the nails in his hand he's a good car
[44:51] now before I go further than that you
[44:53] know oftentimes we want to wait until
[44:56] the thing has happened before we testify
[45:00] right amen what we supposed to do as
[45:03] believers has testified beforehand
[45:06] oh my god right we we bake cakes first
[45:10] before we see miracles believe us that's
[45:16] what we do the Prophet come to town and
[45:19] it may say you bring me a cake first
[45:22] before you do anything else
[45:23] yes this is a family condition if this
[45:29] lady she's already told a prophet that
[45:32] is what I'm gonna do is do this and that
[45:34] and meet my son we're gonna eat this
[45:36] ring on that it's just already total
[45:38] profit and maybe she's thinking that
[45:40] she'll get some sympathy hallelujah and
[45:43] then because that's what we look for
[45:45] sometime
[45:46] God not in the business of giving
[45:47] sympathy right God is in the business of
[45:51] changing your sympathy smile on your
[45:57] face you remember the winner's name she
[46:00] was she was uh she was going through a
[46:02] rough time but we see the apps across
[46:04] the eyes of the world it changed her
[46:07] situation
[46:08] hallelujah it's so so here man
[46:11] maybe this is what a woman is given you
[46:13] know that's it you know we don't do this
[46:14] we go down maybe looking for some simple
[46:16] saying look I'll tell you what you do
[46:17] you make me a cake first and then go
[46:20] feed your son and I guarantee you that's
[46:24] a barrel empty and you my word about you
[46:41] that's what you we sitting word if you
[46:47] abide in me if you do it exactly what
[46:49] God is calling you to do and what
[46:50] excites you to do you can send the word
[46:52] on your behalf
[46:54] Oh hallelujah let's do over here his
[46:57] book the Prophet goes on says I have to
[47:00] stick my fingers in a silent in the
[47:02] prints of the nails in his hands he's a
[47:05] good guy
[47:06] he said come on Thomas here you are says
[47:09] Oh Oh Thomas said now I believe he said
[47:12] yes Thomas after you sing me and fill me
[47:16] and put your hand in my side you believe
[47:20] he says but how much greater is their
[47:24] reward who had never seen and yet
[47:28] believe glory he's a good god he gives
[47:33] you the desire of your heart of course
[47:35] let's just believe him
[47:36] that's the death stroke to Satan oh
[47:40] thank God for that
[47:42] yo yo yo yo your belief your faith is it
[47:46] could give devil of death stroke
[47:48] hallelujah amen that's the desktop to
[47:51] Satan when a man tensed God at His Word
[47:55] brother that'll kill Satan every time
[47:58] anybody interested in and killing the
[48:01] devil
[48:06] let's have a little further careful
[48:10] please God and the way we're gonna do
[48:13] that is by taking God at His Word
[48:17] that's a test talk to the devil when
[48:20] somebody gets set up and say the Bible
[48:22] says the Word of God see I'm not looking
[48:26] at my circumstance I'm not talking about
[48:30] how I feel I'm talking about what the
[48:33] Word of God says glory glory glory he
[48:47] says say that better kills thing every
[48:50] time that's the hardest-hit that thing
[48:53] can get when a man will take God at His
[48:55] Word yes sir
[48:58] says like as I said next and I live I
[49:01] live alone Jesus the other night but
[49:02] every word that proceedeth out of the
[49:05] mouth say man I love that just take God
[49:07] at His Word that will that'll produce
[49:09] that death stroke to the demo hey man
[49:12] let me go on with a couple more here
[49:14] Amen this is out of the message wisdom
[49:16] verses faith a man wisdom verses faith I
[49:20] tell you would probably be dropping
[49:23] nuggets all over the place yes hey man
[49:25] we just sit there and just listen like
[49:27] what did you just see just nuggets all
[49:29] over the place look at this he says now
[49:31] what started he's talked about in the
[49:33] Garden of Eden here it was all Eve had
[49:40] to do is just hold to the word God had
[49:43] give him the word all she had to do is
[49:44] hold to the word but she began to reason
[49:46] with the word and that's where that's
[49:49] where you know you say you say wisdom is
[49:51] really coming from the devil hallelujah
[49:54] amen wisdom really coming from the devil
[49:56] wisdom goes against your faith
[49:58] hallelujah and as he was breaking that
[50:01] down I say uh-huh
[50:02] because you know we will take the wisdom
[50:05] of the doctor
[50:07] they've been in school for so many years
[50:10] and we take the wisdom over the top of
[50:13] the doctor over what the Word of God
[50:16] says we'll take the wisdom of some
[50:19] professional person over what God's
[50:22] mercy and God don't want us to be that
[50:24] way and then we can appreciate them but
[50:27] you know their knowledge only goes so
[50:28] far
[50:29] their wisdom only goes so far but the
[50:32] wisdom of God is unsearchable right and
[50:34] all God wants to do it just take him at
[50:36] his word so I want to tell you tonight
[50:38] send the word whatever problems you got
[50:40] send the word send the word a man a man
[50:46] a man that is the word went to Port st.
[50:49] Lucie it's the word going to Marilee
[50:57] it's a word going to abjure right it's
[51:02] the word going to Portland are you with
[51:06] me here the word go to Haiti
[51:09] [Music]
[51:11] the word of go places where you can't go
[51:15] the world will give into situations that
[51:18] you can't get into
[51:20] come on sucks all you've got to do it's
[51:23] in the world I got so I got I gotta read
[51:29] I got a ring you know my momma taste
[51:32] something about this when you send the
[51:34] word if there's something there
[51:38] inside of them for the word to connect
[51:41] to it's like a hitch in too if you got
[51:46] if you got this hits on the back of your
[51:48] truck that you can tow anything how low
[51:50] you can pull posts you can pull campus
[51:53] but you gotta have something to hit it
[51:55] to before you can pull it and if that's
[51:59] the native seat in the heart of your
[52:02] child when you sit the way I don't care
[52:05] where they go they gonna be toting that
[52:08] water with them wherever they go
[52:11] [Music]
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:14] Jeff's in the Word of God he sent His
[52:18] Word to heal us in answers that's what
[52:23] that's what the Bible said he sent his
[52:26] word to him we might not be able to give
[52:29] in to the situation because when we talk
[52:32] people misunderstand what we're trying
[52:34] to say but if I can send the promised
[52:36] Word of God
[52:38] I gotta we're turning a single rock
[52:41] chefs in the word send the word send the
[52:46] word send the word freeze cogs look at
[52:49] this and whistle versus face the Prophet
[52:51] says now what started it
[52:54] reasoning see faith has no reason you
[52:58] know reason at all you believe he says
[53:02] when you pray for and accept God's Word
[53:06] for healing don't reason with your
[53:08] feelings don't reason with nothing else
[53:11] don't even don't even sit down and have
[53:12] a conversation with your feelings don't
[53:15] even talk to your feelings I mean tell
[53:17] your feelings their life man hey man
[53:20] tell your test results you bang what the
[53:25] word say praise God it may be these
[53:30] numbers got to come back down get back
[53:32] into a normal area I don't know I don't
[53:34] know what I don't know what's doing this
[53:36] but the words am supposed to be healed
[53:39] praise God not gonna accept this
[53:42] hallelujah glory glory glory glory oh
[53:46] Jesus Lori to God you know I was in a
[53:50] little something today a man a little
[53:53] lunch and learn thing and the man made a
[53:57] comment you know he was a pharmacist he
[53:59] was talking about how people get they
[54:00] met at medications on mixed up right and
[54:03] because they got so many medications
[54:05] it's easy to get them mixed up and they
[54:07] say a lot of times what happens is that
[54:09] a doctor if you ever seen a doctor's
[54:12] writing you can't understand that most
[54:14] of the time you saying that if you can't
[54:17] understand it how you think me as the
[54:20] pharmacist understand what he wrote you
[54:24] call your doctor right you can't get in
[54:27] touch with them I call your doctor I
[54:30] can't get in touch with him so what I'm
[54:32] gonna do is take a stance
[54:37] I'm gonna assume if you tell me you got
[54:39] these symptoms this is what you need any
[54:43] say say there's you know sometime they
[54:44] write things up and and you know one
[54:47] person went to the pharmacy just to get
[54:50] cough medicine and she ended up with
[54:52] some other type of medicine because it
[54:53] was just misunderstood things was that
[54:58] if I take this I'm gonna get back right
[55:01] why don't just pick on it it's work
[55:04] because then say better there is a high
[55:07] probability that somebody gonna get
[55:10] something wrong with this medication yes
[55:11] man they said they had a thing they got
[55:15] this thing now that they do they got a
[55:16] test at their door people and they call
[55:19] it the placebo and what they do the
[55:23] placebo they'll tell you say now we're
[55:26] gonna do this test with you you might
[55:28] have genuine medication and you might
[55:32] not now maintain it the placebo looks
[55:36] just like the real medication but there
[55:39] is nothing inside of it that will
[55:42] actually make you better
[55:44] the placebo they find people taking the
[55:47] placebo actually getting better and they
[55:51] trying to figure out how did the person
[55:53] get
[55:56] [Applause]
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:22] the Word of God and watching it bring
[56:26] our bodies and to the police God
[56:29] ordained for to be hallelujah we don't
[56:32] have to take the placebo take the words
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:40] we got a baby they still trying things
[56:42] out we got something that works hey man
[56:45] a man all right let me let me let me let
[56:48] me let me let me all right this is good
[56:50] this is your let me read this let me you
[56:52] say you say y'all don't reason it all
[56:55] and you believe when you pray for and
[56:57] accept God's word for healing don't
[56:58] reason with your feelings don't reason
[57:00] with nothing else there's no reasoning
[57:02] to it God said so in that settles it
[57:07] this oh how I like to stop in a few
[57:10] minutes and rest on that and take a text
[57:13] out of it
[57:13] can't do it and preach these about 40
[57:16] and 50 texts I got ripped down here but
[57:18] reason he said he says when the Lord
[57:20] gives a vision sometimes just to tell
[57:22] you my own little infant ways the Lord
[57:25] gives a vision something is going to
[57:27] happen well I don't care what is
[57:29] contrary to it and remember everything
[57:32] that can be presented contrary Satan
[57:34] will do it amen he'll try the reason you
[57:38] can't do it look at this he say for
[57:40] instance that what I just caught a few
[57:43] moments ago about going now this was
[57:45] kind of off the beaten path just before
[57:47] my mother with and the Lord knew I was
[57:49] going to I was gonna I wasn't going to
[57:53] be able to keep those appointments with
[57:56] those brethren about going hunting and
[57:58] vision and sent me all the way into
[58:00] British Columbia it says and when we got
[58:03] there the guy said I've never see what
[58:08] they're using words like that that
[58:10] that's reasoning let's get ready to
[58:12] settle in when they say I've never seen
[58:16] a silver tip my brother Brandon I'm told
[58:18] my god
[58:19] God got me never total of inches and
[58:20] everything and this man said I know you
[58:22] up in this area but all the years I've
[58:24] been here I've never seen a silver tip
[58:28] I've lived here all my life and the
[58:30] sides we're going plumb up into sheep
[58:33] country on horses there's no silver tips
[58:37] you ain't gonna get enough up there you
[58:40] see see trying to move away reason the
[58:45] guide is telling them these things now
[58:47] the beach and say go but when you get
[58:49] better God say mochila chips up in oh I
[58:52] wanna take some wink God is giving you
[58:54] something that whether it's by vision
[58:56] weathers fine direct inspiration from
[58:58] the Word of God no matter what nobody
[59:00] say you stay with the word of God if God
[59:04] had to create a path then God would
[59:10] created because the bitchin said it was
[59:13] gonna be glory he says he says we got
[59:17] there the guy said I've never seen it
[59:19] says from the beware he says st. said to
[59:21] me you just misunderstood the vision
[59:25] worried the devil some crafty fellow
[59:28] said but I didn't it's gonna be sad the
[59:31] Lord and when the caribou came up we got
[59:34] that which was in a vision as you all
[59:36] know it says did he say the guy said to
[59:39] me very fine brother to be with him now
[59:41] and a few weeks young Christian said
[59:43] brother branham my brother had the
[59:45] absolute epilepsy and you rolled up on
[59:48] that horse that day and told me a
[59:49] certain thing to do my brothers ever
[59:52] epilepsy it was ceased he said when I
[59:54] did exactly what the Holy Spirit told
[59:56] you to tell me say he's never had a
[59:59] spell from that thing now this man
[1:00:02] testifying but look at him saying I said
[1:00:04] now here we are on top of this mountain
[1:00:07] and for three miles right down there
[1:00:09] there's not even a bush four inches high
[1:00:12] nothing but careful knobs a few
[1:00:15] blueberries and they only get 2 or 3
[1:00:17] inches high set caribou blue
[1:00:20] bears plumb to the Timberline and I'm
[1:00:22] out horses where it hits in the
[1:00:24] Timberline and now according to what you
[1:00:26] told me before we come here that's
[1:00:28] somewhere between here and where that
[1:00:31] boy is standing with that checkered
[1:00:33] shirt off you're gonna kill a 9-foot
[1:00:35] Silvertip grizzly bear ain't no weight
[1:00:52] it's gonna happen but God told me and
[1:00:55] since God told me I'm standing on this
[1:00:57] promise word look at me say that I said
[1:01:01] the Lord see it says what was it Satan
[1:01:03] trying to get me to disbelieve that
[1:01:06] since we started down the mountain
[1:01:08] clothes we got he kept saying brother
[1:01:10] Brennan we're only about a mile from it
[1:01:14] now reasoning he says is I said are you
[1:01:18] doubting but are you daddy but he said
[1:01:23] he says not at all
[1:01:24] we got within about a half a mile II
[1:01:26] said we're only a mile now
[1:01:31] I said that's right said just think
[1:01:38] it's how you respond to this pain it's
[1:01:41] how you react to this thing just think
[1:01:44] about it i'ma get my silver tip grizzly

[1:02:22] gonna bring it to pass Laurie glory
[1:02:45] glory ICI successfully says are you down
[1:02:47] buses not long we got within I about a
[1:02:50] half a mile said we're only a half mile
[1:02:53] now I said that's right said just think
[1:02:56] and a half mile casting down reasoning
[1:03:03] we got a cat anytime reason come this
[1:03:06] Casa de don't even talk about I know I'm
[1:03:11] not supposed to say this not if you know
[1:03:13] you're not supposed to say it don't say
[1:03:15] it don't let that come up to mouth don't
[1:03:18] let the devil use your mouth glory to
[1:03:21] God
[1:03:21] casting down reasons he said look we can
[1:03:26] see everything right before us there's
[1:03:27] nothing out there but I said that God
[1:03:30] who gave me the word can't create one
[1:03:33] thing don't reason just believe it don't
[1:03:36] pay attention any attention to reasons
[1:03:39] that has nothing to do with it just
[1:03:41] believe what he said that's all I was
[1:03:43] standing there looked up on the hills
[1:03:45] everywhere just yellow Campbell my mouse
[1:03:48] Sun going down hills beautiful you can
[1:03:50] see any little spot anywhere for three
[1:03:52] miles up the mountain right above me
[1:03:55] when I turned to look about two miles
[1:03:57] ahead of me or mile and a half or two
[1:03:59] miles stood a 9-foot Silvertip grizzly
[1:04:03] how he got there
[1:04:05] I don't know but he was there see and he
[1:04:10] goes on I'm just stopping this sentence

[1:04:16] the
[1:04:21] just tell you they would say no matter
[1:04:22] what the circumstances don't don't
[1:04:29] reason don't reason believe no matter
[1:04:34] what the circumstances don't pay no
[1:04:37] attention to circumstances believe man

[1:04:53] that but the first house that he bought
[1:04:55] I remember you know we just remember our
[1:04:59] passes of standing and an apartment most
[1:05:03] of the years that we know he was in an
[1:05:04] apartment and and you know he had this
[1:05:08] house that he he got and took some of
[1:05:11] the Saints over to see the house and and
[1:05:13] when we got there he was just telling us
[1:05:14] how you know the loan officer saying sir

[1:05:36] working on it and God gonna turn this
[1:05:37] thing around

[1:05:42] to the heart of the king is in God's
[1:05:45] hands
[1:05:46] right and they say in the heart of the
[1:05:48] king can be turned whatever wait got one

[1:07:10] story since when Jesus was entered into
[1:07:13] Capernaum there were there came up to
[1:07:16] him a Centurion beseeching him a man and
[1:07:20] saying Lord my servant lieth at home

[1:07:27] look at this man jesus saith unto him I
[1:07:30] will come and heal him so you know I'm
[1:07:33] gonna take care of see when Jesus gets
[1:07:35] involved things about to change
[1:07:37] yeah I guarantee when Jesus get to your
[1:07:40] house your your servant will no longer
[1:07:43] have that same testimony oh come on
[1:07:46] Church and I'll tell you Jesus is
[1:07:48] getting involved in your situations when
[1:07:50] you send the word it just like sending
[1:07:54] him lowering to God a man the word is of
[1:07:59] the purse
[1:08:00] so when you send the words your sittings
[1:08:02] you actually release in Jesus to do
[1:08:04] something about it don't seems you'll
[1:08:07] doubt don't send your complaints in the
[1:08:10] word Jesus said unto him I will come and
[1:08:15] heal him not know maybe about it I'm
[1:08:18] gonna take care of it I will come and
[1:08:20] heal him go on
[1:08:21] he says the Centurion said lord I am not
[1:08:24] worthy that thou should have come under
[1:08:28] my roof I look at this man look at this
[1:08:30] but Speak the word only not what I said
[1:08:34] send the word only Jesus I got so much
[1:08:39] confidence in you that if your word go
[1:08:42] is just like you come hallelujah
[1:08:47] Speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:08:50] be healed
[1:08:51] those are the six but I am a man under
[1:08:54] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[1:08:57] say to this man go and he goeth and to
[1:09:00] another come and he comes and to my
[1:09:02] servant do this and he doeth it when
[1:09:05] Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to
[1:09:08] them that followed fairly I said to you
[1:09:10] I have not found so great faith no not
[1:09:14] in Israel Jesus was even stumped by this
[1:09:16] man Spain right I mean just think about
[1:09:19] it but the man had confidence that if
[1:09:21] Jesus would speak is just as good as
[1:09:24] Jesus going yes I want to leave that
[1:09:29] with you tonight
[1:09:30] if you found the promise in comfort if
[1:09:33] you just take you
[1:09:34] his work that's just as good as him
[1:09:37] being there himself you already know if
[1:09:40] Jesus showed up in your situation if he
[1:09:42] was your lawyer in the courtroom do you
[1:09:43] already know you weren't gonna lose if
[1:09:47] he was your doctor you know that
[1:09:48] sickness is gone right in a situation
[1:09:51] that Jesus is involved in you already
[1:09:53] know about the chain but it's time for
[1:09:55] us to recognize the power of the word of
[1:09:57] God that we have in our midst
[1:09:59] however the word is having cheese ice
[1:10:08] Nixon heard the voice let's say he is
[1:10:10] here and he is here he is here right now
[1:10:14] his word is rich hallelujah glory let's
[1:10:21] go on he saves all and I stand to you
[1:10:26] that ministers come from the east of
[1:10:28] west and shall sit down with Abraham and
[1:10:30] Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:32] but the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:10:35] cast out into outer darkness there shall
[1:10:37] be weeping and getting gnashing of teeth
[1:10:38] this is the last woman jesus said unto
[1:10:40] the Centurion go thy way and asked our
[1:10:44] house believed so be it done unto thee
[1:10:47] again never touch this distance this
[1:10:50] town never touch this service brother

[1:10:54] never touched him her he's the word
[1:10:58] deity say any surgery was healed in the
[1:11:00] selfsame hour now just look at this
[1:11:05] jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way
[1:11:08] and ask that has believed so be it done
[1:11:14] unto thee Jesus even say a prayer for
[1:11:17] the circles
[1:11:22] why who brought healing it was a man's
[1:11:29] confession in the word and so you say if
[1:11:32] you send your words say if you speak the
[1:11:35] word only I know my servant will be made
[1:11:38] old it was a man's faith in that
[1:11:41] confession that probably healing where's
[1:11:44] your faith in tonight if you got faith
[1:11:49] in what God said in his word it'll bring
[1:11:52] it'll interchange any situation to fix
[1:11:55] them tonight I got I got I got I got I
[1:11:57] got something else to share with you

[1:12:01] unto thee if this servant was healed in
[1:12:03] the stuff same our Jesus never prayed
[1:12:07] for him maybe even you know said it in
[1:12:10] my lane just find not alone according to
[1:12:13] your faith you're gonna find the way you

[1:21:22] a hundred miles of it run out when he
[1:21:24] found it found it that's the way it was
[1:21:26] setting right exactly what was it the
[1:21:29] word went and got him now I can't read
[1:21:37] the rest of this because it's quite
[1:21:38] lengthy but but I do want to share this
[1:21:40] brother branham broke into another
[1:21:42] testimony
[1:21:51] and he's talking about a man let's see
[1:21:53] who was the brother day he was he was uh
[1:21:55] praying for brother
[1:21:58] I believe this brother it might have
[1:21:59] been brother and brother Evans again for
[1:22:01] the Welch Evans I think brother Evans
[1:22:05] was selling cars and he sold the car to
[1:22:10] a man for $400 and somehow the man got
[1:22:15] off the lot without paying brother Evans
[1:22:18] his $400 took off left pretty much stole
[1:22:24] a car and brother Bradley said this man
[1:22:30] was of a different spirit he said so
[1:22:34] this man he said they would they would
[1:22:36] accident man about going to church and
[1:22:38] you know he would make comments about
[1:22:39] well we're not going to church I'm just
[1:22:41] looking for the pretty blondes in the
[1:22:42] church so it showed that he had a
[1:22:44] different spirit at different anointing
[1:22:46] on him and with a different anointing on
[1:22:48] him he said when you sin the word to him
[1:22:51] there was nothing to latch on to there
[1:22:55] was nothing to latch on to this fella
[1:22:57] but the first fella used to be a
[1:22:59] Christian so when you send the work to
[1:23:02] him there was something that to get us
[1:23:03] you know stopped him right in his tracks
[1:23:04] but this other fella there was nothing
[1:23:07] for the word to actually laugh tone to
[1:23:09] he was gonna keep all going with that
[1:23:12] money and never pay it back because
[1:23:14] there was nothing to latch onto he said
[1:23:16] but we sit the word anyway and and and
[1:23:20] and and and and what brother Graham said
[1:23:22] the word kept an eye on this me
[1:23:26] it's out on the court I got to hurry say
[1:23:29] the word just kept an eye on the fellow
[1:23:31] now the word came back some sort of make
[1:23:34] a bring the money back but the word
[1:23:36] nowhere you act the word is watching
[1:23:40] everything you do hallelujah glory to
[1:23:45] God so so so so so this man even though
[1:23:47] he needn't have said word was washed out
[1:23:49] today praying about it and they released
[1:23:51] it sit I mean if you ask anything in my
[1:23:54] name you can have it if you're bothered
[1:23:55] me and my words about you you can have
[1:23:57] what you win right
[1:23:59] they just seal those promises over this
[1:24:01] silly the new name of Jesus just let the
[1:24:03] word watch over I was I was I was moved
[1:24:06] by this because you know the Lord told
[1:24:09] me send me I'll hold some money from
[1:24:12] some people and they done went five
[1:24:15] years without doing it giving you money

[1:24:39] priestess but the Lord put this in my
[1:24:41] spirit you know say say when I heard
[1:24:43] that quote I said okay Lord okay but
[1:24:46] some of y'all been waiting for years I
[1:24:50] mean this may have $400 some of y'all
[1:24:53] might be a lot more than $400 but it's
[1:24:56] time for the devil to release it
[1:24:58] and the way we gonna get it you ain't
[1:25:02] gotta fight with them we sit in the word
[1:25:04] now if there's something there for it to
[1:25:07] latch on to they'll bring it back
[1:25:09] themselves they'll bring it back if it's
[1:25:13] something to latch on but if it's

[1:48:36] situation
[1:48:39] family
[1:48:43] the scripture
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:47] it's actually proverbs 3 verse 19 says
[1:48:51] the law without substance and when the
[1:48:54] first fruits of all thine increase
[1:48:57] always be filled with Queenie presses
[1:49:01] shall burst out
[1:49:04] this is just
[1:49:07] tonight
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:31] of you mate
[1:49:36] so as brother Jack was talking about
[1:49:39] being old money and I was just trying to
[1:49:44] really think how I can apply that to my
[1:49:48] situation
[1:49:50] and I actually remember today I had a
[1:49:54] situation that happened my bank account
[1:49:57] and it was a straight-a situation out it
[1:50:01] was at ours that wasn't supposed to be
[1:50:04] there and when I called the Baines
[1:50:08] take care of it and resolve it they just
[1:50:11] just any ruler knew nothing it was about
[1:50:14] uh
[1:50:16] $200 that uh discharged me for North
[1:50:20] agreed
[1:50:21] and I thought it was very wrong then
[1:50:24] they went as far as me and not make away
[1:50:27] for them reimburse me or refund the
[1:50:30] money so I was a little down so hard all
[1:50:40] day brother Jack say that
[1:50:45] formation because God just gave me a
[1:50:48] piece it would be all right and I know
[1:50:52] that God is gonna sing his word as we
[1:50:56] declare that tonight that people haven't
[1:50:58] changed in their hearts there was some
[1:51:01] way somehow
[1:51:04] and
[1:51:07] by two years ago actually there was a
[1:51:08] gentleman that I I bit my tongue it was
[1:51:12] about $400 and I remember when I lent
[1:51:18] him the money
[1:51:19] I was remaining things that matter
[1:51:22] and I never heard from him I mean we
[1:51:24] speak all the time but he never mentions
[1:51:27] anything about giving the money back and
[1:51:29] and I'm the type I don't like the
[1:51:32] accident island when I land I almost
[1:51:34] just forget about it
[1:51:36] so all the turn went behind every now
[1:51:40] and then it will come back to mine
[1:51:42] like man
[1:51:44] no I gave this such a funny you know if
[1:51:48] he forgot about it I was gonna remind
[1:51:50] him so I believed I believed I will
[1:51:53] remind him we sent word out to him in
[1:51:57] some way somehow the last thing I want
[1:52:01] to say is I've been that little very
[1:52:06] the games in past weeks moments where I
[1:52:11] really have some bad the game
[1:52:15] I've been taking uh I've been taking
[1:52:17] appeal
[1:52:19] when I get any stomachaches it pretty
[1:52:22] much it makes me feel so it makes me
[1:52:25] very fast abated it does all these
[1:52:27] things so I've been tape is feeling
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] I tell these feel so much I kind of felt
[1:52:36] worse laid off the pill and I said you
[1:52:39] know what I'm just not gonna take it
[1:52:41] anymore
[1:52:42] so I started to find different natural
[1:52:44] remedy
[1:52:46] that I was fine you know ways to feel
[1:52:49] better since I always sing we know but
[1:52:54] I've seen a lot of talking
[1:52:57] I really received an
[1:53:00] I like the stomach it was still there
[1:53:05] was still bothering me it was proofing I
[1:53:07] would go away and it will come back and
[1:53:08] go and come back
[1:53:11] but right here who deserves I just felt
