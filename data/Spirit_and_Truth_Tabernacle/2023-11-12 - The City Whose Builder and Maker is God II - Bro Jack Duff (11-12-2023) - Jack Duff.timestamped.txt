[45:56] to just say this to the church that um
[45:58] you know every Thanksgiving we do a
[46:01] turkey drive and what we do is we
[46:04] provide turkeys for every family that
[46:06] comes through that line and uh what the
[46:09] uh sister Tina and sister Erica them did
[46:11] this year they they kind of had people

[46:15] were going to need to purchase and uh we
[46:18] come to find out this year we need to
[46:19] purchase 84
[46:22] turkeys
[46:23] pre-registered 84 people 84 families
[46:26] need turkeys now here's the good
[46:30] news I'm not going to ask y'all for
[46:32] money for the turkeys cuz somebody's
[46:35] already blessed us with the money to buy
[46:37] all those
[46:43] turkeys we thank the Lord for that uh
[46:46] but what we also do is when you know we
[46:49] also during the holiday season we like
[46:51] to give them gift cards uh just to bless
[46:54] a family so I'm going to going to ask
[46:56] you if we already know we had 84 turkeys
[46:58] I don't know how many gift cards we're
[46:59] going to need but we're actually going
[47:00] to try to prepare to buy 100 turkeys for
[47:03] those that didn't pre-registered we want
[47:04] to have a couple extra that we can give
[47:06] away and if uh if we if we can't give
[47:08] those away at Thanksgiving then we'll
[47:10] give them away at Christmas but for
[47:12] Christmas season if you would if you'd
[47:15] be um so kind to just maybe buy a gift
[47:18] card or two that we can give out to
[47:20] those that are in need amen uh here in
[47:24] our city amen so let's see how we can
[47:26] touch them but like I said we needed 84
[47:29] turkeys I'm sure we're going to need
[47:30] just as many gift cards so whatever the
[47:32] Lord put in your heart amen we would

[48:34] the worship appreciate everything that's
[48:37] been done Amen in the name of Jesus uh
[48:40] I'd like to just read a scripture we're
[48:42] going to go back to a thought that we
[48:44] had started working with a few weeks ago
[48:47] uh on the city whose Builder and maker
[48:50] is God Amen and uh we want to uh refresh
[48:55] a few things things and then kind of go
[48:56] forward uh with a little bit more so if
[48:58] you don't mind standing with me as we
[49:01] read God's word I would certainly
[49:04] appreciate it uh Hebrews
[49:07] 11 Hebrews
[49:10] 11 uh starting at verse
[49:13] 8 amen then also I'll read from the book
[49:16] of Revelation verse 20 I mean uh chapter
[49:19] 21 verse 1-8 but here in Hebrews 11:8 it
[49:22] says by faith Abraham when he was called
[49:27] to go out into a place which he should
[49:30] received which which he should after
[49:33] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[49:35] went out not knowing whether he went by
[49:40] faith he sojourned in the land of
[49:42] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[49:46] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[49:49] Heir is with him of the same promise for
[49:52] he looked for a city which ha
[49:56] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[50:01] God amen amen amen yes yes there's so
[50:06] much in the word there uh let us let us
[50:09] turn over here um to uh Revelation
[50:15] 21 amen just verse 1-8
[50:21] here the Bible says and I saw and new
[50:25] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[50:28] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[50:30] away so the one that we are living
[50:33] in right now uh is supposed to pass away
[50:38] now uh we'll get there I'm not there yet
[50:41] but just a a a precursor it's not that
[50:45] it's going to be
[50:47] annihilated it's simply going to be
[50:51] cleansed amen uh and it's very similar
[50:54] to the process of you receiving the Holy
[50:56] Ghost you you as an individual not
[50:59] annihilated but you have been cleansed
[51:03] so that God can dwell inside of you this
[51:05] earth goes through the same process that
[51:07] you go through all right it says I saw a
[51:09] new Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[51:11] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[51:14] away and there was no more sea and I
[51:18] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[51:20] coming down from God out of Heaven
[51:23] prepared as a bride Adorn for her
[51:24] husband now that's a very important
[51:26] scripture to me again I I won't hit it
[51:28] today but uh but this is going I'm going
[51:31] I'm coming there I'm coming there uh is
[51:34] coming down out of Heaven prepared as a
[51:36] bride Adorn for her husband uh and I
[51:39] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[51:43] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[51:46] and he will dwell with them and they
[51:48] shall be his people and God himself
[51:50] shall be with them and be their God and
[51:53] God shall wipe away all all tears from
[51:56] their eyes and there shall be no more
[52:00] death praise God for that neither sorrow
[52:04] praise God for that nor crying praise
[52:07] God for that neither shall there be any
[52:10] more pain praise God for that for the
[52:13] former things are passed away and he
[52:17] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[52:19] make all things new and just uh real
[52:22] simple I can just you know just just
[52:23] make this real real easy this is almost
[52:25] the last chapter in the Bible uh and we
[52:28] just saw something here we passed over
[52:30] real quick but it's there in the
[52:31] scripture said he that sat upon the
[52:34] throne not them come
[52:36] on all right it ain't the father Son and
[52:39] the Holy Ghost because the father Son
[52:41] and the Holy Ghost is the same person
[52:43] which is the Lord Jesus Christ so the
[52:45] Bible says he that sat upon the throne
[52:49] said behold I make all things new and he
[52:52] said unto me right for for these words
[52:55] are true and faithful and he said unto
[52:58] me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[53:01] beginning and the end I will give unto
[53:03] him that is a thirst for of the Fountain
[53:05] of the Water of Life freely he that
[53:08] overcometh shall inherit all things I
[53:11] thank God for that promise and I will be
[53:14] his God and he shall be my son but the
[53:17] fearful and unbelieving and the
[53:20] Abominable and
[53:22] murderers uh and whoremongers and
[53:25] Sorcerers and idolators and all liars
[53:28] shall have their part in the lake which
[53:30] burneth with fire and brimstone which is
[53:33] the second death amen thank God thank
[53:36] God ain't no Liars going to be there
[53:38] ain't no whoremongers going to be there
[53:41] ain't no Sorcerers going to be there
[53:43] ain't no murderers going to be there
[53:45] ain't no idolators going to be there see
[53:48] that that whole Atmos got to be changed
[53:51] now if you want to make it to the other
[53:53] side amen man those that's working
[53:56] abomination in their body they ain't
[53:58] going to be there sir hello I mean and
[54:01] people say God love everybody he do but
[54:03] he don't love the
[54:05] sin so the sin got to be taken care of
[54:09] before we talk about going to heaven
[54:11] let's pray father we thank you for the
[54:13] reading of the word but we take uh we
[54:15] ask that the Holy Spirit would now bring
[54:17] Clarity on the things that we've read
[54:19] and uh we take every Spirit that's
[54:21] against the spirit of God underneath the
[54:22] control of the Holy Ghost even right now
[54:25] and father may you reveal yourself to
[54:27] your people uh as your Prophet told us
[54:30] Lord you have to send down
[54:31] representation may it come down today
[54:34] and may the people recognize who they
[54:35] are in you in Jesus name we pray amen
[54:39] amen God bless you you can be seated
[54:41] amen uh I'm I'm going to take a little
[54:44] journey here at the beginning of this
[54:46] sermon um I want to read a a number of
[54:50] things for you um first of all when we
[54:53] when we read the book of Revelation this
[54:55] is um um this this book has been a book
[55:00] that many have been afraid of however uh
[55:03] most most people can go to Revelation 21
[55:07] and read the scripture that I just read
[55:08] and everybody gets excited about no more
[55:11] crying and no more death and no more
[55:13] sorrow and him wiping tears from eyes
[55:15] that's so uh I mean Mo most people can
[55:17] just read that and understand it no
[55:19] problem at all but it's all the other
[55:21] things that's in the Book of Revelation
[55:22] that kind of scare people sir praise the
[55:25] Lord amen before you get to Revelation
[55:28] 21 and 22 which is the end of the book
[55:31] uh you got to go through all the other
[55:33] chapters and you got to try to have an
[55:35] understanding as what's going on in
[55:36] those chapters but but what I wanted to
[55:38] do just amen today uh just kind of uh
[55:41] help us understand it's a blessing first
[55:44] of all to read the book of Revelation
[55:47] amen it's it's a blessing and and I want
[55:50] to just kind of bring out a couple
[55:51] blessings that we find in the Book of
[55:53] Revelation and then I'll bring out got a
[55:55] couple other uh blessings that we find
[55:56] in the New Testament but I can't read
[55:58] all the blessings today but let me just
[56:00] read some of them over you let's go back
[56:02] to Revelation 1 and3 amen Revelation 1
[56:05] and3 and uh it just tells us something
[56:08] here glory to God uh it says blessed is
[56:12] he that readeth amen and they that hear
[56:16] the words of this prophecy and not only
[56:20] that once they hear it amen and keep
[56:23] those things which are written therein
[56:25] for the time is at hand and I like that
[56:29] because uh there was a time in in in
[56:31] history where the time was not at hand
[56:34] and when you go back to the Book of
[56:35] Daniel there was a time where God told
[56:37] Daniel seal up the things that you have
[56:39] amen you just saw don't don't don't
[56:41] don't don't share anymore about it seal
[56:43] those things up until the end time and
[56:46] we're living in a day Hallelujah where
[56:48] we can declare the time is at hand for
[56:51] us to understand what is written here in
[56:54] this book right amen Revelation that's
[56:57] that's Revelation 1 that's the first
[56:59] chapter in Revelation Revelation 22:7
[57:01] which is the last chapter of the Book of
[57:03] Revelation says
[57:05] behold I come quickly and it says
[57:09] blessed is he that keepeth good God
[57:13] Almighty you can't let this go keepeth
[57:16] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[57:20] yes sir you got to have to keep
[57:22] everything that you that you that that
[57:24] God has tell you about this particular
[57:26] book you going to have to keep that in
[57:28] order to enjoy the blessings amen of
[57:31] this new Heaven and new earth all right
[57:34] Jesus makes a few comments amen about
[57:36] blessings in Matthew Chapter 5 and let's
[57:39] just pick this up glory to God and I'll
[57:41] come back and H hit a few more in
[57:43] Revelation but just go just bear with me
[57:46] this morning uh Matthew 5:1 says and
[57:48] seeing the multitudes he went up into a
[57:52] mountain and when he was set uh his

[1:01:17] in me amen come on Church glory to God
[1:01:22] all right all right I'm I'm picking up
[1:01:23] another one Matthew
[1:01:26] 13 uh verse uh 14-1 17 look at this one
[1:01:31] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:01:35] Isaiah uh uh which saith by hearing ye
[1:01:40] shall hear and shall not understand and
[1:01:44] seeing ye shall see and shall not
[1:01:47] perceive for this people's heart is
[1:01:50] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:01:53] hearing
[1:01:54] and their eyes they have closed lest at
[1:01:57] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:02:00] and hear with their ears and should
[1:02:02] understand with their heart and should
[1:02:03] be converted and I should heal them look
[1:02:06] at this verse but blessed are your eyes
[1:02:11] oh good God
[1:02:13] Almighty blessed are your eyes for they
[1:02:16] see and your ears for they hear for
[1:02:19] verely I say to you that many prophets
[1:02:22] and righteous men have desired to see
[1:02:26] those things which you see I told you
[1:02:28] Daniel was told to close it up seal it
[1:02:30] up he could not see the things that we
[1:02:32] even talking about today publicly
[1:02:35] talking about Daniel had to seal it up
[1:02:37] but the time is at hand for us to
[1:02:40] understand these things amen amen for
[1:02:43] verily I sayto you that that many
[1:02:45] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:02:48] to see those things which you see and
[1:02:49] have not seen them until to hear those
[1:02:51] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:02:53] them you blessed to be able to see
[1:02:56] you're blessed to be able to hear and
[1:02:58] I'm going to tell you that's a double
[1:02:59] blessing cuz naturally if you can see
[1:03:02] and naturally if you can hear that's a
[1:03:04] blessing but to hear spiritually and to
[1:03:07] see spiritually is a greater
[1:03:14] blessing going back to the Book of
[1:03:16] Revelation just catching up catching a
[1:03:18] couple more verses here amen Revelation

[1:09:09] won't let him
[1:09:12] in your pastor won't let him in your
[1:09:15] mama won't let him in but what he
[1:09:18] decided to do is I'm going to come back
[1:09:20] to my house where I've been dwelling all
[1:09:22] this time
[1:09:26] now here's a problem here's a problem
[1:09:28] here's a
[1:09:30] problem come on now I mean let's just
[1:09:32] look at the process Jesus tells us
[1:09:34] what's happening right look at this
[1:09:38] now I will return into my
[1:09:41] house whence I came out not now you
[1:09:44] didn't go out on your own we kicked you
[1:09:48] out and when he
[1:09:50] cometh he findeth that sweat
[1:09:56] Hallelujah and
[1:09:58] garnished see that things are changing
[1:10:01] on the inside it's swept and garnished
[1:10:04] and and now you think this a real
[1:10:06] comfortable spot but you got to
[1:10:08] understand something that happens with
[1:10:09] this devil he realized that he is not
[1:10:12] strong enough to come back by
[1:10:16] himself and to over take you y'all ain't
[1:10:19] talking to me
[1:10:21] yet so in order of this that to to get
[1:10:24] back into the swept out house into the
[1:10:28] garnish house he has to invite some
[1:10:31] friends to his
[1:10:34] address
[1:10:36] Lord and what happens is you're not
[1:10:38] fighting just one devil now you fighting
[1:10:42] eight
[1:10:44] Devils while your house is swept out
[1:10:48] while is godess now you start fighting
[1:10:50] more Devils right but great is he that's
[1:10:53] in you
[1:10:57] you don't worry about the process cuz
[1:11:00] greater is he that is in
[1:11:03] you he that's in the world remember a
[1:11:07] little story amen a man told and I'm
[1:11:10] coming back to the scripture in a second
[1:11:12] but you know this man invited Jesus to
[1:11:14] come to his house and uh you know he's
[1:11:17] like Jesus I I I want you to come in but
[1:11:19] here's your room right here you just
[1:11:21] stay right there and you let me know
[1:11:22] what you need and and I'll come get it
[1:11:24] but you just stay right here in this
[1:11:25] room Jesus said okay all right no
[1:11:27] problem so he uh later on that night the
[1:11:30] devil showed up at the man house
[1:11:33] knocking on the door and came in and my
[1:11:35] it was all kind of tussling tumbling and
[1:11:38] uh lamps breaking all kind of stuff
[1:11:40] going on down there and I mean that man
[1:11:42] was getting wore out by the devil and
[1:11:45] Jesus was
[1:11:47] upstairs so the next morning the man
[1:11:49] come out with bandages and everything
[1:11:50] say Jesus didn't you hear all that rck
[1:11:53] ISS going on down here how come you
[1:11:55] didn't come out and help me he said cuz
[1:11:56] you told me to stay in this
[1:12:00] room if you would have given me
[1:12:04] access to your whole house I could have
[1:12:07] took care of that problem for you and
[1:12:10] what I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:12:11] God needs access to your whole
[1:12:15] house not just part of it God want
[1:12:18] access to the whole thing oh y'all going
[1:12:20] to make me
[1:12:22] preach amen
[1:12:24] even them secret things that you trying
[1:12:26] to keep God out of God W access in them
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:34] areas Lord verse 26 says then goeth
[1:12:39] he and taketh to him seven other Spirits
[1:12:42] more
[1:12:45] wicked so this is a worst problem so
[1:12:49] here's the thing when you get this the
[1:12:50] place all swept out and garnished and
[1:12:52] clean you better make make sure you get
[1:12:53] it filled with
[1:12:56] Christ that way he can't come back in
[1:12:58] there make sure it get filled up with
[1:13:02] Christ look at this more wicked than
[1:13:05] himself and they enter
[1:13:07] in and dwell there and the last state of
[1:13:11] that man is
[1:13:14] worse than the
[1:13:17] first this process is is is Real Jesus
[1:13:20] told us about it and and some of us in
[1:13:22] here are witnesses is that we've seen
[1:13:24] this
[1:13:24] happen so so it's very important that
[1:13:27] you know when when you don't don't play
[1:13:29] with Devils my god when you when you
[1:13:32] finally get rid of one you better keep
[1:13:33] them out of there don't let them back
[1:13:36] in and and the time that he comes back
[1:13:39] is when you got it all cleaned
[1:13:40] up that's when you want to come back all
[1:13:44] right look at this verse 27 and it came
[1:13:46] to pass as he spake these things a
[1:13:49] certain woman of the company lifted up
[1:13:50] her voice said unto him blessed is the
[1:13:53] womb this lady was listening to the word
[1:13:55] as Jesus was preaching say blessed is
[1:13:57] the womb that bear
[1:13:59] thee and the PS which thou has sucked
[1:14:04] but look at what Jesus say but he said
[1:14:06] yeay rather

[1:15:04] the very last chapter in the book of
[1:15:07] Revelation keeping the sayings of the
[1:15:09] prophecy these are very important words
[1:15:11] that we need to take heed to watch this
[1:15:14] in the message I'm par say the prophet
[1:15:16] makes this statement says now what is
[1:15:18] the unpardonable
[1:15:20] sin now you know uh before I go further
[1:15:24] in that quote him and his mother was
[1:15:25] having a conversation one time and his
[1:15:27] mom was tell him you know the
[1:15:28] unpardonable sin is to have an abortion

[1:15:46] sin but it's not
[1:15:49] unpardonable hello fornication is no it
[1:15:52] it is sin but it's not unpardonable and

[1:18:05] now I don't believe it well I'll tell
[1:18:07] you I don't believe it I just don't well
[1:18:10] if you don't that's up to you you don't
[1:18:13] have to have life you don't have life
[1:18:15] that's all because that's the truth
[1:18:17] that's right all right the same thing on
[1:18:20] any other truth that's right to refuse
[1:18:22] to reject to disbelieve the word of God
[1:18:24] it's unpardonable sin you have no more
[1:18:27] right if you come up and say well I
[1:18:29] don't believe he was the Christ then
[1:18:31] you'll never be saved until you repent
[1:18:33] of that and be reconciled to him this is
[1:18:36] the truth of God and is put out to you
[1:18:39] you say oh I don't believe it then you
[1:18:41] are cut off from God until you repent
[1:18:43] and come to the truth is that right now
[1:18:47] here the prophet just made it very very
[1:18:49] clear when we reject
[1:18:51] Christ it's I'm part of a sin and what
[1:18:54] we mean by this rejecting Christ it's um
[1:18:57] uh I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to save
[1:18:59] some things but but you know it it's the
[1:19:01] reveal word for your day right if I can
[1:19:03] just put it that way I mean when when he
[1:19:05] when when Jesus came on the scene and
[1:19:07] I'm and I'm I'm coming I'm coming I'm
[1:19:10] coming I'm coming I'm coming let me let
[1:19:12] me let me hold it just hold let I'm
[1:19:13] going to hold it just for a little bit
[1:19:15] let me go to my next quote but you know
[1:19:18] uh when Jesus was on the scene they
[1:19:19] rejected him in his
[1:19:21] day everybody in receive
[1:19:23] Jesus everybody in everybody want so
[1:19:26] welcoming to want them to come to their
[1:19:28] house some people want them out the
[1:19:30] house out the city everything I mean get
[1:19:32] Jesus a lot of people rejected Jesus and
[1:19:36] let me twe it this way the majority yes
[1:19:38] sir rejected Christ and if they rejected
[1:19:41] him when he was walking on the face of
[1:19:43] this Earth they going to reject him
[1:19:45] again today the
[1:19:47] majority will reject
[1:19:50] him I know y'all see church is full full
[1:19:53] of people but the people ain't receiving
[1:19:58] Christ they not they go I mean they go
[1:20:00] to the altar they do all these things
[1:20:02] but they're not really receiving Christ
[1:20:04] because if you receiving Christ you'll
[1:20:05] come in line with his
[1:20:08] word you're not going to receive Christ
[1:20:11] and then reject his word you're not
[1:20:13] going to do that he is the word that's
[1:20:16] right all right all right don't don't
[1:20:18] get tricked this hour don't get tricked
[1:20:20] now let me read another another uh quick
[1:20:22] quick quick uh quote here out of message
[1:20:25] Shalom and and and I'm I'm I'm going
[1:20:27] forward I'm going to try to turn a

[1:22:29] teaching the ones that were older than
[1:22:31] he and when Jesus was teaching them men
[1:22:33] they were so shocked How could a boy
[1:22:36] this this young be teaching us things
[1:22:38] they should have known there was
[1:22:40] something special about Jesus but yet we

[1:22:49] amen good
[1:22:51] people s sincere
[1:22:53] people went to find Jesus look at this
[1:22:56] Mary like Mary and Joseph they were very
[1:22:58] sincere see thinking he was with them
[1:23:01] when he
[1:23:02] wasn't people in church today think that
[1:23:05] God is with him but he's not Mary and
[1:23:07] Joseph you know when when they was up at
[1:23:10] the feast Jesus the age of 12 they
[1:23:12] thought presuming he was with them but
[1:23:14] he wasn't good people today think the
[1:23:16] same thing they these people that's
[1:23:18] organized in the council churches these
[1:23:21] people in these organizations they think
[1:23:23] they're doing a good
[1:23:25] thing they're presuming he's with
[1:23:27] them when they're not see many people
[1:23:30] think that he was with them when they
[1:23:32] shook his hands when they shook hands
[1:23:35] with the preacher and put their name on
[1:23:36] the book but he wasn't many people
[1:23:38] thought when they were sprinkled
[1:23:40] confirmed baptized in the name of Father
[1:23:42] Son and Holy Ghost thinking he was with
[1:23:44] them they're good
[1:23:45] people Mary and Joseph was good people
[1:23:48] but the fact was he wasn't there don't
[1:23:51] presume
[1:23:54] anything when Mary and Joseph Found
[1:23:56] Jesus there in the temple teaching Mary
[1:23:58] Mary made a statement that just blew her
[1:24:01] testimony out the
[1:24:02] water she
[1:24:05] says uh Jesus me and your father been
[1:24:07] looking for you and Jesus had the stop

[1:24:18] don't you know that I got to be about my
[1:24:21] father's business

[1:24:28] her right in front of everybody H don't
[1:24:31] you know I got to be about my father's
[1:24:32] business said right then she just kind
[1:24:33] of hushed the mouth say no don't say
[1:24:35] nothing no don't say nothing else but
[1:24:36] you might get really
[1:24:41] blasted
[1:24:45] Jesus was not received in his day but
[1:24:48] yet what we find amen and and here's the
[1:24:51] oh I I I missed this right there that
[1:24:53] ver that that paragraph 96 what is
[1:24:58] light I got to I'm I'm putting this in
[1:25:01] here
[1:25:02] because in the new city Jesus is the
[1:25:07] light of the city the Bible says he the
[1:25:10] lamb is the light thereof so Jesus is
[1:25:13] the light of the city what is light
[1:25:17] watch it now the
[1:25:19] Vindicated spoken word of God outside of
[1:25:23] that there is no light amen see you
[1:25:26] can't lighten the Earth with flashlights
[1:25:28] it takes God's word that's made manifest
[1:25:30] that's the sun now now now we we're
[1:25:33] making some progress light is when the
[1:25:35] word has been made manifest right before
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:42] hallu light is when the word has been
[1:25:47] manifest before you when Jesus came on
[1:25:49] the scene he was the light of of the day
[1:25:53] that's right when Moses came on the
[1:25:56] scene Moses was carrying the light for
[1:25:58] the day when Noah came on the scene Noah
[1:26:01] was carrying the light for the day if
[1:26:03] you didn't want to walk in darkness you
[1:26:05] better receive what Noah had to
[1:26:09] say Amen come on somebody when there was
[1:26:13] Darkness all over Egypt but in Goan
[1:26:17] there was no Darkness there was a group
[1:26:19] of people willing to receive what the
[1:26:21] prophet Moses had to
[1:26:24] say God don't change his
[1:26:27] program if he had a prophet back then he
[1:26:29] has a prophet today Hallelujah and we
[1:26:31] got to receive what that Prophet is
[1:26:33] saying in order to walk in the
[1:26:39] light I I asked this question the last
[1:26:42] time I brought this sermon and I'm I'm
[1:26:45] I'mma ask it again and I'mma move
[1:26:48] on if one
[1:26:51] Rejects the light of their
[1:26:54] day how can they expect to live in the
[1:26:59] city where the lamb is the light amen
[1:27:04] right
[1:27:06] amen
[1:27:07] amen this just it's a question that came
[1:27:10] to me if one rejects the light for their
[1:27:13] day how can they expect to live in a
[1:27:14] city where the lamb isite and notice I
[1:27:17] want you to my pay attention to the
[1:27:18] question if one rejects for the light
[1:27:20] for their
[1:27:23] day you're not living in Paul's day
[1:27:27] you're not living in irani's day you're
[1:27:30] not living in Martin's day and Luther's
[1:27:31] day and Columbus Day you're not living
[1:27:33] in that day you living in a different
[1:27:35] day and you reject you need to figure
[1:27:38] out Lord what is the like for my
[1:27:42] day you not living in Noah day you not
[1:27:46] living in Moses day this is your day and
[1:27:49] if you reject the light for your day how
[1:27:52] can expect to live in a city where the
[1:27:53] lamb is the
[1:27:55] light right all right let me we talking
[1:27:58] about a city who's building Mi is
[1:28:00] God now watch this watch
[1:28:04] this I said it before Jesus was the
[1:28:06] light in Genesis
[1:28:08] 1 when he when when when when when the
[1:28:11] Lord said when God said let there be
[1:28:12] light the first light that came out was
[1:28:15] the son of God light s o n it was the
[1:28:18] son of God light it wasn't the sunlight
[1:28:20] s n s in and Moonlight did not come
[1:28:23] until the fourth day read your Bible
[1:28:26] Hallelujah but it was the s o n light
[1:28:29] that came out of God when he said let
[1:28:30] there be light Hallelujah that's the
[1:28:33] same light that Paul saw on the road to
[1:28:36] Damascus there was a great light that
[1:28:39] Paul saw when he got knocked off his
[1:28:40] high horse and and the light spoke back
[1:28:42] to Paul Paul began to ask questions to
[1:28:44] the light who art thou the light the
[1:28:46] light said to
[1:28:49] Paul the light said it not nobody else
[1:28:52] said it but the light spoke back to Paul
[1:28:55] the light said I am
[1:28:58] Jesus so the same light that came out of
[1:29:01] God in Genesis 1 is the same light
[1:29:03] that'll be light in the city when we get
[1:29:05] to the other side and in between getting
[1:29:07] from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 we got
[1:29:10] to walk in the light for our
[1:29:13] day yes
[1:29:14] siren I got to I got to show you
[1:29:16] something I got I'm I'm I'm coming to it
[1:29:18] but but see you got to got to got to got
[1:29:20] to understand that that light is passing
[1:29:22] through the land yeah it's been passing
[1:29:25] since the days of Adam that's right all
[1:29:27] the way I mean that it led the children
[1:29:29] of Israel out of the out of the
[1:29:30] Wilderness they had a pillar of Fire by
[1:29:32] day a pillar Cloud by a pillar Cloud by
[1:29:35] day a pillar Fire by night that was that
[1:29:37] same light leading them the same light
[1:29:41] when God said let there be light come on
[1:29:43] y'all you ain't going to make it without
[1:29:48] light God knew what he was talking about
[1:29:50] when the first thing he he spoken to a
[1:29:52] creation was
[1:29:55] light amen that shows how important it
[1:29:58] is for you to have
[1:30:00] light you can't see nothing without
[1:30:04] light come on somebody you ain't going
[1:30:06] to understand nothing without light and
[1:30:09] once light has been brought to you you
[1:30:11] got to walk in the
[1:30:13] light amen
[1:30:16] amen my my my I told y'all Jesus was the
[1:30:19] light in Genesis 1 I told you Jesus was
[1:30:23] the same light in uh in the middle of
[1:30:25] the Bible in Psalm
[1:30:27] 23 where he's the one that's causing the
[1:30:30] shadow amen the shadow of death the
[1:30:32] reason is a shadow because there's a
[1:30:34] certain amount of light that presents
[1:30:36] the shadow creates the shadow he is that
[1:30:39] light in the shadow of death Hallelujah
[1:30:41] he's also the light in John 8:12 where
[1:30:44] it says then spake Jesus again unto them
[1:30:47] saying I am the light of the world but
[1:30:49] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:30:51] darkness Darkness but shall have the
[1:30:52] light of Life yes Jesus is the light of
[1:30:56] the new city Revelation 21 and 23 says
[1:30:59] and the city had no need of the
[1:31:02] sun nor of the moon to shine in it for
[1:31:07] the glory of God did lighten it when the
[1:31:09] lamb and the lamb is the light thereof
[1:31:14] now I I want to just kind of go back to
[1:31:16] a little diagram that I gave you
[1:31:20] all last last time I'm going to pick
[1:31:22] this up and I got I got a little bit
[1:31:24] more to bring you today so um I read
[1:31:28] your quote out of questions and answers
[1:31:29] on
[1:31:30] Hebrews part three and I presented this
[1:31:34] to you last time I'm going to do it
[1:31:35] again
[1:31:36] today when the thousand years are
[1:31:40] expired on this
[1:31:42] earth and the Devil comes up and the
[1:31:44] second Resurrection comes the
[1:31:46] resurrection of the
[1:31:48] unjust they gather a great Army like the
[1:31:50] Sands of the sea and they come up to
[1:31:52] Compass the camp of the Saints now this
[1:31:54] is revelation uh this uh um uh that's
[1:31:57] been explained Revelation 20 I believe
[1:32:00] uh and when it does god reigns fire and
[1:32:01] brimstone out of heaven and destroys
[1:32:06] them John said I saw a new Heaven and a
[1:32:08] new Earth for the first
[1:32:11] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[1:32:13] away and there was no more sea and I
[1:32:15] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[1:32:17] descending from God out of Heaven
[1:32:18] prepared as a bride adorned for a
[1:32:20] husband there you are questions and
[1:32:22] answers on Hebrews and this next uh
[1:32:24] paragraph here paragraph says
[1:32:28] um there he said the wife the lamb and
[1:32:31] the bride will be there
[1:32:33] forever it says there will be a new
[1:32:37] Earth and this is the thing that gets me
[1:32:39] is the the dimensions that the prophet
[1:32:42] gives he says millions and millions of
[1:32:46] square miles millions and millions of
[1:32:50] square miles
[1:32:52] oh my uh the city the Bible measures out
[1:32:56] the city of
[1:32:58] 15,000 square miles is 15,000 mil long
[1:33:02] 15,000 miles wide now uh I again I
[1:33:05] believe that should be500 miles 1500
[1:33:08] miles and uh but nonetheless we're going
[1:33:11] to do a quick calculation here and
[1:33:13] you're going to see that what Pro what
[1:33:15] the prophet said when he said square
[1:33:16] miles you're going to see how big and
[1:33:20] how how how large this city is I told
[1:33:24] you you might have a bucket list of
[1:33:25] cities that you want to go to and visit
[1:33:27] one day if this city ain't on the top of
[1:33:31] your bucket list you need to get rid of
[1:33:34] your
[1:33:40] list 15,000 miles wide 15,000 miles high
[1:33:43] that's exactly the description in the
[1:33:45] Bible gives us of the city no wonder
[1:33:46] there's no more sea there's no more
[1:33:48] place for it oh there'll be such beauty
[1:33:51] and and in there there's a fountain
[1:33:52] right at the Throne of God that flows
[1:33:54] Before the Throne there's a tree on
[1:33:56] either side of uh of the River of Life
[1:33:58] and in this tree dwells 12 manner fruits
[1:34:01] and yields its fruit every month I want
[1:34:03] to go back to uh the PowerPoint
[1:34:06] presentation that I gave you amen just
[1:34:09] uh uh last time we were teaching just
[1:34:11] want to again just try to I was just
[1:34:13] trying to wrap my mind around how
[1:34:17] large uh this city was and you know and
[1:34:20] as I was just
[1:34:22] I mean even even at even to this point
[1:34:24] as I'm preaching this I still can get my
[1:34:27] head wrapped around how big this city
[1:34:31] is I mean it is it's it's uh when when
[1:34:34] the scripture says eyes have not seen
[1:34:37] right ears have not heard nor has it
[1:34:39] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:34:42] God has prepared for those that love him
[1:34:45] it's I don't care how much I try to
[1:34:47] present this we'll never really touch
[1:34:49] the
[1:34:50] real we'll never get there but here you
[1:34:53] know I I brought out this um uh this
[1:34:56] chart the layers of the earth atmosphere
[1:34:59] uh in the in the PowerPoint that I have
[1:35:01] the city and maker who's God uh the
[1:35:03] second slide there I brought out this
[1:35:06] chart and what I was trying to show you
[1:35:09] let me see if I have uh my
[1:35:13] notes yeah so um there the very bottom
[1:35:17] this is the Earth's atmosphere this is
[1:35:19] what we live in right now the osphere
[1:35:22] amen really goes as high as about seven
[1:35:25] miles and that's as high as planes can
[1:35:27] fly pretty much in 7even mile that seven
[1:35:30] mile radius you get up there in the
[1:35:32] plane you get above the clouds and you
[1:35:33] just be looking like so peaceful like oh
[1:35:35] my this so nice this is just one as high
[1:35:38] as they're only about seven miles high
[1:35:40] that's
[1:35:41] it
[1:35:43] Stratosphere some hot air balloons and
[1:35:45] even some planes get up in there that's
[1:35:46] roughly between 7 to 31 miles high from
[1:35:50] where we are right now the
[1:35:53] mesosphere uh is roughly 31 to 50 miles
[1:35:57] high you can see meteors and everything
[1:35:58] like that and even uh uh uh uh like
[1:36:01] rockets can get up into that Hallelujah
[1:36:04] the mesosphere the
[1:36:07] thermosphere um you know that's roughly
[1:36:10] anywhere from 50 to 440 miles high but
[1:36:14] it's the
[1:36:15] exosphere that's the highest level and
[1:36:18] that's anywhere from roughly um
[1:36:22] uh 440 to
[1:36:24] 6,200 Miles High now brother bradam said
[1:36:28] this city that we're going to well the
[1:36:29] Bible says it the Bible say it's going
[1:36:31] to be500 Miles High so that city is
[1:36:35] going to reach from here up into here
[1:36:38] and y'all will be living somewhere along
[1:36:40] in here and somewhere along in here and
[1:36:43] somewhere along in here I mean now we we
[1:36:45] can't get there a plane can't even take
[1:36:47] us that high we disintegrate but but in
[1:36:50] order for us to live at this level in
[1:36:52] the exosphere it's going to all change
[1:36:53] let me tell you I I don't even have time
[1:36:55] to go but all this going to be blown
[1:36:59] away when we talk about a new Heaven and
[1:37:01] a new Earth all of this is gone sir and
[1:37:04] what gives you the ability to be able to
[1:37:06] live in that atmosphere now because you
[1:37:08] have been
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] changed
[1:37:14] amen it's a change that actually puts
[1:37:17] you in a position where you can live up
[1:37:19] here with no problems at all amen yeah
[1:37:22] gravity won't be holding you down
[1:37:24] anymore Everything Changes

[1:37:34] now brother Brandon made the statement
[1:37:36] there in that quote about it
[1:37:39] being
[1:37:41] millions of square miles and I want to
[1:37:43] go to the next uh the next slide cuz you
[1:37:46] know 1500 miles high 1500 miles wide,
[1:37:50] 1500 miles
[1:37:51] the way we get to these millions because
[1:37:53] I don't I don't I'm not a really good
[1:37:55] math person some math people might be
[1:37:57] but 1500 miles high and wide give you
[1:38:00] 3,000 base height and when you start
[1:38:03] multiplying all this now you get to
[1:38:06] 2.25 which is
[1:38:08] 2,250,000 Miles squared right okay and
[1:38:12] then they say the volume the cubic cubic
[1:38:16] miles 1
[1:38:18] billion 125
[1:38:21] million I can't read the rest of
[1:38:30] it I've never seen a number that
[1:38:34] large I mean it go beyond uh what our
[1:38:37] mind can even imagine right I mean what

[1:43:53] just get me ready for this next slide
[1:43:56] but I'll give you just a little example
[1:43:59] of a lady that heard from her
[1:44:02] representation what God does is he sends
[1:44:05] the word to
[1:44:07] you I'm I'm I'mma say it like this
[1:44:13] today right
[1:44:15] now God is sending down representation
[1:44:25] there was a woman in
[1:44:28] scripture just pull up the little slide
[1:44:30] for me I'mma I'mma give y'all a little
[1:44:32] note from the
[1:44:38] Prophet this is Brother brandom's
[1:44:42] diagram of someone receiving
[1:44:46] representation
[1:44:48] and what he starts out with in the
[1:44:52] diagram is the
[1:44:55] word because in the
[1:44:58] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:45:01] with God and the Word was
[1:45:04] God the word or the low ghost or the
[1:45:07] light or the pillar of fire is what came
[1:45:10] out of God when it said let there be
[1:45:13] light that's right that's what came out
[1:45:16] it was it was the word and and and
[1:45:17] notice here he says now when he got a
[1:45:19] circle there and there no darkness and
[1:45:21] that means it's just full of light yeah
[1:45:24] the word is full of light the word is
[1:45:26] the light the word is is life the word
[1:45:28] is everything we need think brother
[1:45:31] brother brother Solomon saiding
[1:45:32] something about about the word a little
[1:45:33] earlier amen but but but but the word is
[1:45:36] everything the word is pure the word the
[1:45:39] word is amen is it's my God it's it's
[1:45:42] all God perfect God the word is you got
[1:45:45] to be impressed with the
[1:45:48] word the word is
[1:45:52] Jesus but here you know brother Brandon
[1:45:55] puts the word here then he puts the
[1:45:58] Bible there and hold on one second don't
[1:46:00] don't don't do it too much and then he
[1:46:02] he puts w a w and then he puts
[1:46:07] pH so this is actually amen a story that
[1:46:10] where our church name has even come from
[1:46:13] because this
[1:46:15] ww is a
[1:46:19] woman that was at the well now here's
[1:46:23] the problem with this woman at the well
[1:46:24] on the
[1:46:25] outside when you look at her and when I
[1:46:29] look at her this lady just dark she
[1:46:32] can't go to the well when everybody else
[1:46:35] is going to the well she has to go at a
[1:46:37] different time because she can't be
[1:46:38] found with the virgins in the land hello
[1:46:41] anden some of us have been ostracized by
[1:46:44] the sins that we have committed we've
[1:46:47] ostracized ourself by the sins that we
[1:46:49] have committed
[1:46:50] you might as well say Amen but we've
[1:46:53] done things to our own self that put us
[1:46:56] out on the outside and this is why we
[1:46:57] dark all over the
[1:47:01] place
[1:47:04] well
[1:47:06] Jesus in the scripture in John 4 said he
[1:47:09] had
[1:47:10] need to go by Samaria right and and see
[1:47:15] when we read that in the Bible he man we
[1:47:17] think he just wanted to go to Samar no
[1:47:20] no there's more to it than that the
[1:47:22] reason that Jesus had to go by Samaria
[1:47:25] is because there was amen God was
[1:47:28] sending
[1:47:30] down
[1:47:34] representation and when God sends down
[1:47:36] representation it may find you in
[1:47:40] sin yes sir you might have been in a
[1:47:43] ballroom come on somebody you might have
[1:47:46] been like Samson in some lady's house
[1:47:48] that you shouldn't have been in
[1:47:51] hello somebody you might be in a
[1:47:54] relationship that you shouldn't have
[1:47:55] been in But Here Come the word coming
[1:47:58] down sending down your representation in
[1:48:01] the midst of your
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] sin amen Jesus get to this woman at the
[1:48:09] well now she dark everybody knows she
[1:48:11] dark ain't nobody she can't she can't go
[1:48:13] out there with the same lady with the
[1:48:15] ladies when they go out to get water she
[1:48:16] can't do nothing she go out and get her
[1:48:18] water and Jesus said I got need to go by
[1:48:20] some when he get there he tell the
[1:48:21] disciples say now y'all go into the
[1:48:24] village and get some
[1:48:28] viddles and see this see brother brother
[1:48:31] Troy hit it yesterday I mean he he was
[1:48:32] breaking bread he say See Jesus got both
[1:48:35] a
[1:48:36] public and a private
[1:48:38] Ministry so he had to get rid of the
[1:48:41] disciples so he can kind of give a
[1:48:47] little and can I go a little further
[1:48:49] when he is actually getting involved
[1:48:50] when he's bringing you to private
[1:48:52] Ministry this is so he can bring down
[1:48:55] your
[1:48:57] representation
[1:49:02] sir how you know whether you got
[1:49:04] representation or
[1:49:08] not how you actually know whether you
[1:49:10] got representation or not it's based on
[1:49:14] how you respond when it actually comes
[1:49:17] [Applause]
[1:49:19] down amen hallelujah I told you earlier
[1:49:23] everybody was receiving Jesus even the
[1:49:25] ones that looked like they had

[1:49:30] the outside like they had everything
[1:49:32] together they was carrying Bibles they
[1:49:34] was abiding by the law but when the
[1:49:36] manifested word came into their midst
[1:49:39] when the light showed
[1:49:42] up when the light came down to them it
[1:49:45] went
[1:49:47] dark showed that they didn't have
[1:49:49] representation

[1:54:33] have recognized my
[1:54:37] representation God I mean y'all just
[1:54:39] think about where you was when you came
[1:54:41] in contact with this
[1:54:44] word wherever you was that was the
[1:54:48] moment God
[1:54:50] God was sending down
[1:54:53] representation
[1:54:55] hallelujah
[1:54:57] hallelujah that's where you I mean right
[1:55:00] at that moment he was sending down your
[1:55:02] representation and it's how you respond
[1:55:04] to what he sent down shows whether you
[1:55:07] got representation or
[1:55:13] not see the the word let me I I done I
[1:55:17] done left all my my little slides and
[1:55:19] everything y pull me off my slide but
[1:55:21] but the word had to come down and this
[1:55:23] is Jesus having a uh the word which
[1:55:27] which was Jesus at the beginning come
[1:55:29] down Jesus on the earth manifested in
[1:55:32] flesh give me hit next and I think it
[1:55:33] got two scriptures here that that a
[1:55:35] little pull up here that I'll refer to
[1:55:37] yeah the word was made flesh amongst us
[1:55:39] we beheld his glory this is Jesus the
[1:55:42] glories of of of uh uh of the only
[1:55:44] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:55:46] truth now if you also I didn't bring it
[1:55:48] out but if you go back and read John 1
[1:55:49] you'll see that John the Baptist was
[1:55:51] sent to Bear
[1:55:54] witness of the
[1:55:57] light
[1:55:59] yeah even John knew that was a light and
[1:56:01] if John was the first Forerunner at the
[1:56:05] first coming of Christ send to Bear
[1:56:06] witness of the light then at the second
[1:56:09] Forerunner that would come at the second
[1:56:11] coming of Christ it would be another
[1:56:12] prophet he would also have to bear
[1:56:14] witness of the light this is why that
[1:56:16] Forerunner tells John hello tells John
[1:56:21] in the Book of Revelation don't worship
[1:56:27] me worship God I know you'll find a lot
[1:56:31] of people out there that take this
[1:56:32] message and do some crazy things with it
[1:56:35] don't let that be the reason why you sto
[1:56:37] believing the message people did crazy
[1:56:39] things in Jesus
[1:56:40] day that's the TR you're going to always
[1:56:42] have Fanatics doing something that's off
[1:56:44] the word but you know this church ain't
[1:56:46] doing
[1:56:48] that amen
[1:56:50] the word was made flesh dwelt among us
[1:56:51] and we beheld his glory the glor is of
[1:56:53] uh uh of the only begotten of the father
[1:56:55] full of grace and truth John 8:12 then
[1:56:57] spake Jesus again unto them saying I am
[1:57:00] the light of the world he that followeth
[1:57:01] me shall walk shall not walk in darkness
[1:57:03] but shall walk shall have the light of
[1:57:06] Life Jesus is the light this word amen
[1:57:10] that came out of God at the very
[1:57:12] beginning when he said let there be
[1:57:13] light that's in the word form the logos
[1:57:15] form but that took body down here and
[1:57:19] what happens is that all of is is
[1:57:22] passing through the
[1:57:25] Bible even when Jesus came there was
[1:57:27] promises in scripture a virgin had to
[1:57:31] conceive it was promises even from the
[1:57:33] book of Genesis that and the woman's
[1:57:36] seed the woman don't have no
[1:57:39] seed all that was coming through the
[1:57:41] Bible yes sir your
[1:57:45] representation was coming through the
[1:57:48] scripture yes sir and you got to be able
[1:57:50] to recognize him in the
[1:57:54] scripture the scriptures that are
[1:57:56] written for your day amen give me this
[1:58:02] quote that's over here on the right side
[1:58:03] and I hopefully I can read that pergan
[1:58:06] church age now then this word he is Left
[1:58:09] Behind on the printed pages is a part of
[1:58:12] him when you accepted by faith into a
[1:58:14] spirit filled life he said that his word
[1:58:16] was life John 663b but that is exactly
[1:58:20] what he is John 14:6 I am the way the
[1:58:22] truth and the life Romans 89b If any man
[1:58:25] have not the spirit of Christ he is none
[1:58:27] of his there it is he is spirit and he
[1:58:29] is life that is exactly what the word is
[1:58:31] that's exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:58:34] word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:58:36] man in faith takes that
[1:58:42] word into his heart not just leave it in
[1:58:46] his heart it's in my heart
[1:58:49] that Ain where he said to leave it in
[1:58:51] your heart now take it out your heart
[1:58:54] put it somewhere on your
[1:58:57] lips place it is on the lips while that
[1:59:00] is the same
[1:59:05] what you mean this will take me when I'm
[1:59:09] looking like this and make me back to
[1:59:18] this that's the power and the
[1:59:21] transformation of the
[1:59:23] word come on somebody might they might
[1:59:27] have saw you as this and they still
[1:59:28] think you that way but you have come in
[1:59:30] contact with your
[1:59:32] representation Hallelujah when that
[1:59:34] woman came in contact she was no longer
[1:59:36] this woman anymore right amen she was a
[1:59:39] new woman yes sir with a new
[1:59:41] relationship with Christ never to go
[1:59:44] back to find another man
[1:59:46] again satisfied with Jesus
[1:59:49] hallah young people you got to get
[1:59:52] satisfied with
[1:59:54] Jesus old people you got to get
[1:59:58] satisfied with
[2:00:05] Jesus he is the word so when a spirit
[2:00:07] born spirit filled man in faith takes
[2:00:09] that word into his heart places it upon
[2:00:12] us us while that's the same as did is
[2:00:13] speaking Every Mountain has to go and I
[2:00:17] Love This Promise Satan
[2:00:19] cannot stand before that
[2:00:23] man or woman Satan can't
[2:00:27] stand Oh Glory to
[2:00:31] God let me just read one more quote and
[2:00:34] I'm I'm coming home this is out of the
[2:00:36] identified Christ of all
[2:00:39] ages I I'm so glad that he sent down my
[2:00:44] representation see my I'm I'm blessed
[2:00:47] because I can hear hear and
[2:00:51] see that's what Jesus said you blessed
[2:00:54] because you can hear and that was his
[2:00:55] private Ministry the the P the he had
[2:00:57] just gave some Parables and and the uh
[2:00:59] disciples like what were you just saying
[2:01:01] I mean what what was that you just say
[2:01:03] say look let me explain something to
[2:01:04] y'all I say things in Parables to them
[2:01:07] so that the word might be fulfilled that
[2:01:10] they have eyes and can't see and ears
[2:01:12] and can't hear I do it that way
[2:01:13] intentionally I say things intentionally
[2:01:16] so it to go over their head but you when
[2:01:18] I get to you
[2:01:20] privately I begin to break these things
[2:01:23] down can I can I I'm going just you know
[2:01:26] did y'all no this yesterday when brother
[2:01:28] brother Troy preached he a read no
[2:01:31] quotes that was a public
[2:01:33] Ministry but
[2:01:37] [Applause]
[2:01:42] privately let me finish reading
[2:01:45] this identified Christ of all
[2:01:48] ages
[2:01:52] what if I'm speaking here to a
[2:01:54] person that would actually cannot
[2:01:57] receive it you actually cannot receive
[2:01:59] it there's nothing in him to receive it
[2:02:02] see the Pharisees were like that there
[2:02:03] was nothing in them guys to receive this
[2:02:08] actually from my understanding there's
[2:02:09] only one that had something in him like
[2:02:11] man this I don't know what this all
[2:02:12] about but I think there's something here
[2:02:14] his name
[2:02:17] Nicodemus actually cannot receive
[2:02:20] there's nothing in him to receive it the
[2:02:22] Bible said she that lives in pleasure is
[2:02:24] dead while she live while she's alive
[2:02:26] why was it those Pharisees look at Jesus
[2:02:28] all that we know he was a manifested
[2:02:31] word of God we believe that the Bible
[2:02:33] said it was well watch when he done the
[2:02:36] Messiah sign the Pharisees that had a
[2:02:39] little bit of light they was good people
[2:02:41] lived a good Christian Life or a good
[2:02:43] religious life had a a little light
[2:02:46] about them they had organized in a
[2:02:48] priesthood they had a little light but
[2:02:50] down in the bottom of their heart they
[2:02:52] had no Eternal representation in glory
[2:02:56] so when they seen that Supernatural done
[2:02:59] they said this man's be elab a devil and
[2:03:02] what happened look at this what
[2:03:06] happened that put what like they
[2:03:10] had out when they rejected the word for
[2:03:14] their day it actually put the little bit
[2:03:16] of light they had
[2:03:23] out but here was a little ill Fame woman
[2:03:27] a prostitute down in her heart well she
[2:03:30] had a representation of one of God's
[2:03:32] thoughts there she was waited in waited
[2:03:35] in sin but when she seen amen when she
[2:03:39] seen uh uh um uh that happened she said
[2:03:44] sir I believe you're a prophet I know
[2:03:46] when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us
[2:03:48] these things things what did he do he
[2:03:50] cleaned he cleansed her life he was a
[2:03:53] redeemer to her because he I like this
[2:03:56] he was a redeemer to her because
[2:04:00] he could lift her
[2:04:03] up where she come
[2:04:06] from remember the word was coming down
[2:04:09] yeah the word came from God and went
[2:04:11] back to God that's what Jesus said I
[2:04:12] come from God and I'm going back to God
[2:04:15] well the same thing with us we came from
[2:04:17] God and we're going back to God and in
[2:04:19] order for amen him to send down
[2:04:21] representation we had to have something
[2:04:23] on the inside of us that can identify
[2:04:26] right with
[2:04:29] him I don't care how dirty you was I
[2:04:33] don't care how filthy you was once the
[2:04:36] representation came it turned everything
[2:04:43] around he cleansed her life he was
[2:04:46] redeeming her because he he could lift
[2:04:48] her up up where she come from but this
[2:04:51] Pharisee think of religious as he could
[2:04:53] be and Jesus said you are of your father
[2:04:55] the devil and his works you'll do
[2:04:58] religious men belong to fine orders and
[2:05:01] Jesus called them Snakes in the Grass
[2:05:02] and Devils they rejected the light of
[2:05:04] the hour that's exactly what it was when
[2:05:07] they rejected the light of the hour
[2:05:10] their light went
[2:05:13] out so
[2:05:15] how
[2:05:17] how can you
[2:05:20] reject the light for your
[2:05:23] day and expect to live in the
[2:05:27] city where the lamb Israel light and we
[2:05:30] looking for that City whose building
[2:05:32] maker is God and we are on our way
[2:05:35] because we received the light if we can
[2:05:38] walk in the light now we can certainly
[2:05:40] live in the light
[2:05:42] then give me one more verse Psalms 119
[2:05:45] 130 watch this watch this watch this
[2:05:47] watch this
[2:05:55] the Bible
[2:05:59] says the
[2:06:01] entrance sir Psalms 119 and 130 130
[2:06:10] 130 the
[2:06:12] entrance of thy
[2:06:16] words how you going to get like
[2:06:21] yes
[2:06:22] sir sir how you going to walk in light
[2:06:25] how you going to live in light the
[2:06:28] entrance David said
[2:06:31] it the entrance I got to open up my
[2:06:35] heart to receive this word the entrance
[2:06:38] of thy
[2:06:40] words giveth
[2:06:43] light and what else what what what what
[2:06:46] does that light do I mean you know if if
[2:06:48] if I'm walking y'all ain't talking to me
[2:06:50] I'm I'm I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm
[2:06:52] getting out of here when it's dark you
[2:06:55] can't see nothing you don't know what's
[2:06:58] in that room the first thing you looking
[2:07:01] for is just a little bit of
[2:07:03] light because when you get light it just
[2:07:06] kind of get just settles you a little
[2:07:07] bit I can see this I ain't bumping into
[2:07:10] no tables and I ain't doing this and I
[2:07:12] and see when you get a little older see
[2:07:14] now y'all young people y'all can bump
[2:07:15] into the table right now and don't feel
[2:07:17] nothing
[2:07:19] older people just go to sleep and wake
[2:07:21] up with a pain and like I didn't do
[2:07:23] nothing I I did nothing but I got pain
[2:07:27] and I don't want to bump into nothing at
[2:07:29] night I got to have a night light
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] night what y'all talk about no I I can't
[2:07:36] sleep with I need a nightlight you going
[2:07:39] to learn how to sleep with a
[2:07:45] nightlight that's it that's it I ain't
[2:07:48] stuffing my toe I ain't doing it's hard
[2:07:50] for me to
[2:07:52] recover yes I do but but the reason you
[2:07:55] want all of that is because it just kind
[2:07:57] of settles you sett come on now you feel
[2:07:59] a little bit more at ease a little bit
[2:08:01] more peaceful I can I can see where I'm
[2:08:03] going see the entrance of his words
[2:08:05] brings light not only that it giveth
[2:08:12] understanding I told you without light
[2:08:14] you can't do nothing how you going to
[2:08:17] understand the
[2:08:20] uhoh I'm in there now I'm I know you got
[2:08:24] you got people they they read the Bible
[2:08:26] but they don't understand what they
[2:08:30] reading they don't understand what they
[2:08:32] reading yeah they reading it but they
[2:08:33] have no understanding of it cuz the only
[2:08:36] way you're going to get understanding is
[2:08:38] that you first have to
[2:08:41] get amen yes sir you got to get light
[2:08:46] and light com through the manifestation
[2:08:48] of God's promised word for your day am

[2:09:02] Paul light came through brother
[2:09:04] brandom amen the entrance of God's words
