away from you know loving him and serving him time that me and brother smiley got into that accident and our car was turned over i i was coming to a point in my life where i just didn't want to go to church anymore it's just just you know that was it for me but sometimes what god does he allows certain things to happen to just get your attention to to help you to realize that if you're not underneath my covering you're not underneath my protection anything can happen to you and after that accident i i i began to run back to jesus and just give him everything i had as we were listening to uh brother solomon sing that song and you know sometimes the devil be fighting things like that because he knows somebody is going free in the midst of the words of the song and you know that those words i'm tired of pain and i don't like fear right i mean and when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired then you're going to do something about it see that fear is that i might miss the rapture and i might miss going home with the saints and i and i don't want to live life in fear right i want to make sure that my my my my heart is right and my mind is made up they say i want no

anointing on it it's its power is still uh resonate within us when we hear it amen i didn't i didn't you know one thing i didn't know that brother was saying um time we had the accident amen uh he was

things amen i'ma try to say here [Music] with jesus falling in love [Music] which is the best thing oh yes [Applause] my jesus [Music] is [Music] amen amen appreciate the musicians this morning amen appreciate brother solomon getting out of the way and letting the lord uh use it we're going to look at the scripture now in the book this morning i don't know if this mic is going out or it's me amen but to be in the house of the lord this morning it's good to see everybody um i just asked for the church to be in prayer with me for uh some friends of mine um lost another brother it's been it's just been one sibling after another for the last year i think this may be the fourth sibling in that family was ten of them and uh in the last uh you know bo right bo henderson yeah i just passed away every time i hear about one of them um my mind just be blown and uh so remember them in in prayer on joel chapter 2 we might want to read um make sure i got it here the 25th 25th verse it says that the locust has eaten the canker worm and the cali a great army which i sent among uh let's despise for a word of prayer gracious father we just come this morning to yield our vessel uh to you this morning we trusting that you'd help us to say something that's edifying this jesus christ wonderful name amen amen amen [Music] i've gotten used to that cordless mic uh it used to be a time where i used to like these things here but i kind of uh i get a little wild when i get one of these in my hand i start feeling more like an evangelist but uh we'll see how it works out this morning i want to use as a little topic uh this morning knowing your rights and there's a context operating according to the law all right i was i was listening to a tape this week that i hadn't heard in a good long time i thank god for the leadership of the holy spirit and as i was listening boy that thing started just really uh working on me i was like man that's really real powerful thought uh i'm i'm a firm believer in the knowledge and understanding of the scripture right uh i often say this now i hope y'all don't never get tired of my sayings but you know i often say i enjoy the worship and all of those things but for me what we understand about the word of god is going to take us farther than don't get don't get tired don't get dead because anything dead needs to be buried right right but uh our victory comes by the revelation of the word of god is that right amen it you we we i shout because i realize by understanding amen who i am right right that's the reason why i shout i don't know why y'all shout you might shout because your neighbors shout all right your hood's been shot i don't know why y'all shout it's got to be an individual thing right we we come here this morning uh as individual now y'all just pray for him i'm gonna get out trying to get the flesh out the way first uh but but whatever i do on a spiritual note i do it for myself by revelation right because that's how he deals with gentiles as individuals if you're not coming here as an individual to get closer to god something's wrong it's okay to start out that way well you know my mama bringing me to church and praising lord well you ain't got no choice when you when you're young you got to go to church you know but but as you get older you know you start making your own decisions and things of that nature well you're going to be hell responsible i ain't going to go that way this morning that was free right uh uh brother branham preached a message the restoration of the bride tree yeah really really really powerful powerful message and and my hope this morning is is that uh at the end of the show because i i've been thinking brother jack has been preaching some just outstanding messages is that right can y'all all agree man i tell you what i was having myself a fit at home wednesday night i was i was trying to get here but the devil hindered me i felt like paul i was trying to get there but the devil the devil hindered me but thank god for social media where i could stay connected amen you know i i don't know about people all of this you know how folk is they come to church every now and again i ain't built like that never was never will be thank god for that is that right i hope i don't get in trouble now y'all don't stick your dogs on me when i get out of charge god just put that in my mouth that ain't on my nose all right all right come on you know we come we come lord help us let me leave that alone don't you don't you pull on me like that brother troy i got this cordless folk will be putting the head down before i get started girls uh but but by the end of the service um i i just trust that you know we could get stronger and grow stronger in our understanding uh in the faith right one of the things we realize faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of god is that right amen and uh the prophet of god he starts to talk about restoration right right uh uh and he says restoration it means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced but one of the things we we know that because we were born in sin right we we we were separated right come on we we we were separated and we thank god for reconciliation this morning we thank god for uh being restored being brought back to to this place right brother brandon makes a statement in the breach he said you know all that adam lost right now that's that's really powerful that's that's a really powerful thought right but but i think in our understanding right um not in just not we ain't dealing with just head knowledge yeah we talking about what has taken that 18 inch drop what's here right that's what that's what's lacking what's here yeah we might have a lot of information we might can say brother branham said this in the bible said this that don't mean anything if you're not operating in accordance see here's the thing that made the that made this i was i wrote this in in the footnotes here's the thing that made the difference right um um in this the one slave in the rest of the group right his knowledge of who he was right his knowledge of who he was made the difference and how he walked how he he acted his his attitude see they couldn't understand that what what makes him different it was his knowledge come on preach with somebody it's your knowledge that makes the difference in how you walk how you talk is that right well i'm a christian we got our heads hanging down we can't hardly smile come on now we got to realize amen what christ has done for us what what we've been brought into now i'm just kind of building this morning right amen what we've been brought into this family right amen that we've been brought into is that right glory to god amen there's a lot that goes along uh uh with it right this restoration saying you're a christian that's a lot that goes along with this and and i enjoy these things for myself because uh i'm no different than you all now i get anointed when i'm preaching but i ain't always under this kind of anointing [Music] right i'm i'm 16 elements of how many elements we've been made up of i'm just like you and i when i ain't anointed now when i get anointed i feel like i can run through a truth but but you take the anointing off then then i have to operate a certain kind of way because i don't know about you amen uh i i want to uh uh experience all of what the words say i supposed to be experienced and i think that's what brother jack has been bringing to us see experiencing everything amen that the words say we supposed to be experienced see we still can have what we say because he said we can glory to god because he said we can have it then we can have it glory to god glory to god so so we got to understand what goes along with restoration listen we have rights yes right and and i was i was thinking about something as as i was looking at you know the the scriptures and and the the thought that the prophet of god was bringing out um uh a lot of times because we we don't understand our rights we get taken advantage of all right come on now sometimes it's times right you know you you be on social media and and you find people there able to stand up to uh just say the police and things of that nature not in a negative way just by knowing their rights knowing knowing the law right it gives you the advantage it gives you the victory in situations people can't just walk over you and and y'all want to talk to me see when when you know your rights then the devil just don't walk over you when you know who you are you know your rights and you don't walk around and you know in depression and oppression and things of that nature you give that back to the postman that don't belong to me is that right uh uh uh corporations and things of that nature they hire smart people people with knowledge lawyers and and and tax people right so so a lot of times that so that they they could work even sometimes on the edge they want to find all of the loopholes they get smart folk they pay them big money to to show them where the loopholes are in the law right now right see now we ain't trying to find no loopholes but i'm just trying to show us something how how important our knowledge of of our rights and the law is to us right these people pay money because they see the value the value amen in this knowledge and how this knowledge benefits their companies and they make millions and millions and and you can't say you you could say it's illegal but it's not so much illegal because it's in the guidelines all right see you they ain't got to worry about amen the cuts being put on them because they're working within the guidelines of the written law the law of the land right right see it's it's the this the law of the land that gives them the the go ahead to do certain things now when you go outside of that then that's when you go into jail right people go to jail not because they on the edge because they crossed the line all right all right right they crossed they crossed the line and they ain't got nothing to back them up y'all didn't agree with me this morning they crossed the line right that's why they go to jail but as long as they they can get as close to their line as they want to as long as they got some laws and things there to back them up they ain't got to worry about nothing is that right see we we have we have got to keep this this thought in mind right it's so that's why the bible says study to show our self approval unto god one of these days we gon we gonna realize how important it is to study on our own not just wait till we come to church to to listen right to tapes and things of that nature because that there's a wealth of information that's needed for us as individuals right come on now come on come on there's a wealth there's a wealth i've been preaching a long time and i've listened to i probably preached this message and i've listened and some things i know but it's sometimes when things come back around and inspiration strikes it again it just really lifts you up and it just really elevates us is that right yeah yeah oh glory to his wonderful name so so it's knowing your rights knowing your rights you know uh people we have very little knowledge of of our rights just even as american citizens and this is why people do us any kind of way that they want to take they take advantage of us just so many things that we we we lack so many things that they don't even inform us in school you go to college there's so many things that they they keep you away from they don't want you privy of this knowledge right they don't want you to know amen what you entitled to as americans right they want us in just a certain bracket all right come on is that right glory to god yeah you know i was even thinking and uh just over the past how the last holiday um i was kind of chatting it up with sister johnson and some of them because they've coming to a knowledge right that uh we as african-americans hadn't really been privy to nobody when i was coming up talked about amen uh uh stocks and and all that y'all can preach with me yeah yeah that's true we you know all we all we got was with slogans when we we we were young converts right we got a bunch of slogans and a bunch of things that uh uh you know made us shout with no knowledge of but but what i thought we we lacked was just just common knowledge even of life all right because you can't just be so heavily minded that you ain't no earthly good cause you still gotta live here you still gotta function you still gotta eat you still gotta raise your children and see even for me i i tried to raise my children to go even on another level right i remember i remember talking about these things and trying to get folks to study finances and i don't know where this from but i'm gonna preach it anyway right hey man you know working working on the beach i'm gonna get to my subject i guess i'm gonna just go the way you leave me this morning uh uh uh working on the island for three years i said to myself man i ain't never seen so many and they talking about a recession ain't never seen so many mansions built in all my life where these people getting all this money from and and why i ain't got none right what where's the secret what did they keep away from they kept they kept away from me the knowledge of how to get wealth we still scared of that you preach this certain places they be looking at you and they'll tell you about brother branham don't tell me that [Applause] because that man was not poor didn't die poor didn't dress poor had a cow like when he dropped when he died she don't tell you all that they tell you a bunch of other stuff right but i'm gonna i'ma tell y'all i'ma tell y'all these people worth a hundred and some million dollars where they get that from come on preach with me church we we we you know we we gotta we gotta touch on these things because jack brother jack has a vision hallelujah and see it takes finances to go along with division and we need to be able to excel in finance glory but that's just denominational say what you want to say i'm a preacher anyhow all of us can't be be struggling come on we we listen church we we have we have young minds in here i remember when i was younger commercial used to say a mind is a terrible thing to waste it's the truth it's a terrible thing to waste right some of these young people can excel in these things and help elevate us we're getting older i'm getting old demanded i'm woe out construction is beating me down now i used to think i was superman i realize now man kryptonite didn't found me my kryptonite is every every year i have a birthday i got another one coming up in a couple of you know six seven weeks or something like that right come on and and i know at some point i gotta change pace so so these this kind of stuff is important for us we're getting older brother jack following behind me brother troy right glory to god brother calvin brother calvin can't be lifting these couches for the rest of his life he might could drive for a little bit longer but man them couches are killing you i'm telling you right so so i'm saying this because uh uh uh knowledge is important right in in all all aspects right we just don't want it to be one way just so spiritual and so deep and everything is about the word i don't function like that i just don't that the bible said there's a there's a there's a time and a place and a season for everything and every time you get around me i just don't want you trying to quote to me it's the truth anyhow i'm gonna be honest with you i ain't built like that studying that you gotta study but for some people it ain't good i'ma say this and i'm gonna move on how much time i got i could put my glasses on um i remember a brother one time um good brother good brother um he had gotten saved and and uh god was working on him and he was scramming trying to cram so much word to the brother actually lost himself a good man good man police and everything just trying to catch up with brothers had had been around the word of god for years been studying the message for years man and he was just trying to just it's like brother you got to give it a break sometimes you got to be in the natural sometimes you got to laugh you got a wife you got to you know make her happy you got children you got to raise i mean there's other things because god's going to give you what you need when you need it you better believe that it's it's not about catching up it's not about who got the most knowledge and who got the most revelation i you know when i preach i ain't concerned about about and i think i've probably been preaching longer than everybody all the brothers in here but i don't never approach the gospel like that i'm not trying to impress anybody i ain't in no contests with anybody i'm just trying to be a blessing to everybody yield the vessels that god can speak to our hearts and give us something that help us in the natural and the spiritual that's why i like brother jack's balance right it's spiritual and natural because because the laws that god set up when we get into it if i can get off of there is is natural and spiritual right and so if if we've been brought back to this place because we know there was a fall that put us on this side of the chasm right right right amen we we when we came here and we still ain't in our ought to be placed [Music] right that's why that brother branham said there's a groaning there's still a groaning if they ain't groaning in you something's wrong come on glory to god amen as sons of god so we we've been brought back to this place listen church this morning i'm no longer a sinner all right you got to be able to say that well brother smiley i made a mistake i don't care how many mistakes that you have made you gotta say this for yourself i am no longer a man a sinner every young person you got to say that i'm not a sinner i may not be a man what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be [Music] come on somebody cuz every black watch believer gonna make some mistakes brother jack glory to god y'all i know y'all sanctified and holy ghost filled and self-righteous you lying to me make mistakes you do things you say things you act out of source is that right you fuss at your husband you fuss at your wife you oh glory to god that don't mean you ain't no christian though you know we we don't slacked up we don't come to church the way we ought to come on preach with me somebody but we still a christian come on we don't fail from our first love we might will say amen amen amen glory to god glory to god but it's okay yes it is because he said i restore [Music] i i restore the jump i restore the fire i restore the praise is that right he see god only operates according to his word right so so church think about something right what goes along with restoration right we have rights i'm going somewhere i'm taking my time this morning amen see [Music] we gotta understand all that goes along with life and liberty yeah right listen church i'm only trying to benefit from being a christian right i'm not a sinner i don't smoke weed i don't drink you know i know i know some some folk in their christianity they can still drink liquor and wine and praise the lord glory to god i see i'm glad i'm further up the road than that well the bible says you know jesus drunk wine show me show me paul told him to drink a little bit for the stomach's sake right everybody's sick all day every day [Applause] wake up in the morning sick in the evening sick in the midnight hour you sick you just sick sick that's a whole lot he ain't saying drink gallons say get a little bit from the stomach you know you might have a solid stomach well you got a messed up system you need to overhaul glory to god that's right see the the this knowledge right see it it changes the way we view life i view life totally different i might be considered a fanatic in a crank but by the way i just view things from a different standpoint uh uh i i've learned not to be critical anymore but but my views may differ from your views it just depends on where you are and and and because i'm up here i'm not i'll come down here only to fellowship with you but amen in my views i'm not coming down here with you i'm not compromising with you and your your thoughts because i if your thoughts amen is not lining up with the word of god right something's wrong your views and your opinions and your feelings look church i ain't got nothing to do with that i don't operate in feelings and emotions and i operate based upon amen i'm trying to in a lot of areas i may not be but but in a lot of areas i'm only trying to operate based upon the scriptures see even even in the flesh the hardest see this is my enemy right here this is the thing that i struggle with right glory to god this is this is the thing that i wore with not my wife our biggest battle be ourselves and overcoming and that's why these thoughts are so important to us right with my mom no no no no no stop blaming people now that's right you are you are where you are because of you come on now come on well brother smiley well brother jack nope stop that you are where you are in your life because of you your decisions you did that i ain't make folk do that is that right folks try to blame me for a lot of stuff stop it you did that you made the choice right you made the choice you reasoned with the devil how could eve eve couldn't listen it wasn't adam's fault right adam wasn't there if adam was there uh she wouldn't have failed but but she got smaller than her mate and she reasoned and boo caused the trouble come on somebody oh glory to god it's the truth i'm trying to go somewhere see knowledge changes the way that we view life the way we walk the way we talk the way we live right the atmosphere right that that we live in that we create that's in church man on my birthday i'll be 59 years old i refuse to live in an atmosphere right i i ain't saying today i thank god for birthdays my mama just turned 80 years old still i'll be 59 years younger to god and and and and at this stage of life i'm just trying to create a more positive atmosphere right glory to god to live in see i want a bunch of people around me gloom and doom and depression and oppression and things of that nature i thank god this week uh uh my son was home uh for a week uh uh from work and he called me and he said uh dad um uh you got you got anything for me to do you know i could work and i just started this this house i say uh yeah come on man i took him to work a couple of days and it was an opportunity to just fellowship and and talk can let him talk and try to try to share uh uh you know what's what's on his heart try to you know lead him in in the right direction i i just took the opportunity and i said you know i need to do this a little bit more often you know um um just just take the opportunity you know because he's he's i didn't have a daddy come on brother well i take that back i did have a daddy right but he he just didn't give me nothing right he was like the old song papa was a rolling stone when he left me he just left me alone he didn't leave me with no money no identity no wealth of knowledge no nothing right so it's like god is putting me in this position and giving me this knowledge right that i could be able to amen right pour into him right glory to god glory to god just sometimes sometimes you know you take these subtle opportunities to share the wealth of knowledge amen just sow seed just sow the seed just put it out there if you sow the right kind of seed it'll come up huh one thing one thing one thing i know the bible says uh this right train up a child and the way that she go see you you you know i like something brother jack said last week right when his his daughters went on vacay and things of that nature probably when they were younger boy he was probably standing there like boy boy let me tell you something he was in control you could control the situation when they get older forget about it all right when they get older you can only rely upon what you put in there all right right because you can't follow him all right sometimes my son tell me about things that he's done to me in a way it's mind-blowing it's like but then i have to look back and say well i did those things and i did it kind of the same way right glory to god but i i'm glad that i've grown to a place where i could take the opportunity and just be they daddy right not a pastor that probably was hard knowing that i had to go they had to go home with the pastor all right all right sometimes you know even as ministers we got to learn how to put that hat over here and and and be it be the daddy amen see be the daddy i'm preaching i ain't got where i want to go but when it's done it's done today because it's all knowledge right so some sometimes there's things that we you know we we we gotta gravitate towards right we can't just be all cut and dry listen you got to be 17 dealing with the 17. i can't i can't deal with a 23 i have a knowledge because i'm i'm 58 where i can break myself down and think about what type of individual that i was when i was 23 and understand yeah this realm because of this knowledge and understand and try to if it ain't but a little bit by little bit right give them something to elevate them or bring them out of that thing sister lewis used to sing this song little by little we'll win every battle it's it's it's a little bit by a little bit by a little bit by a little bit by a little bit right all of those little bits are mounting up to something so y'all continue to pray for my children you know i just i i i'm i'm just in a place now where you know i don't i don't really preach to them i just laugh with them and joke with them and things of that nature and i let them come to me you know amen because god didn't rescue eve he didn't run to her rescue then and there on the spot and say no eve don't do it he let her go right into it [Music] then she she pulled a husband into it let him go adam don't do it son nope nope let them go right into it when they fail then he came adam where you at buddy adam way yet all right all right i'm sad to say but i'm over here in these budgets what are you doing over there all right do i really gotta tell you do i really gotta say it you you gotta say it [Music] i'm naked i'm you her y'all know what i'm right as youngsters y'all know what it's like trying to explain your situation to your parents oh glory to god can you imagine adam trying to explain being naked to to god like how do i formulate the word well praise the lord huh glory to god but god didn't stop him but let me keep let me keep moving i have not gotten anywhere i got at least about 20 minutes so so knowledge changes the way that that we view life we we walk see because i want to i want to be able to walk victorious i want y'all to see me walking around with my head hung down and po brother smiley and all depressed looking it's like bro what kind of christian is that huh i want to be vibrant upbeat happy victorious it's the shot of the king in the cap or what if the shadow of the king is in the cap then we should be hallelujah some of y'all come through the door praise the lord it's like why is he why is it woo-woo huh come on church glory it changes see this see we couldn't even we could either live depressed defeated lives as sons and daughters of god or we could live lives a life of victory why seeing victory in his mind and you're just defeated as you want to be right it's like it's like why brother jack killing himself and these brothers if if we if we're gonna if we're gonna live lives contrary to what's being preached come on now see there's an atmosphere that's being created in this place things things is happening amen glory to god i don't know about y'all but i feel i feel god all over me this morning i heard brother jack on wednesday night talking about our experience on last last sunday evening i went with brother troy numb and uh brother jack me and brother kwaku uh we went to brother troy's mother house and just to i amazed me she hadn't really been out the house in a year that's that's mind-blowing and uh they shared the testimonies and and and brother jack gave a word right to her right and and man we started praying and now they was like brother i know you had a gift i don't i don't believe i do but i don't you know and it just was instantly man brother quite cool we started praying and it was like something from my gut and i know the word i i know the scripture i've been preaching a little minute now and boy i was trying to hold that thing i was trying to hold it i was kind of holy i was like the next thing you know just from the gut hallelujah man tongues and everything i'm like well praise the lord god okay i tried to hold that back because brother madam said you know you can't hold those things when they when they not things ain't lying but it was something i couldn't hold while i was twisting and turning and well i was like oh jesus i don't know what you're trying to do here but glory i'm i'm willing amen but it was such a it was such a a presence and such a power yeah and just being with brethren that understands uh we supposed to be victorious individuals hallelujah and and walking and operating amen and talking like these things supposed to be happening these this is the children's bread this is our hour this is our time this is our season this is our season to see the miraculous take place this is our time sirs what time it is it's time for the bride of christ to rise up in victory that's what time it is to see god continue to move on the sea folk won't babies can have babies [Music] come on now come on now you know i'm reminded of an old testament scripture the scripture talks about when they cross over into the land of promise it ain't supposed to be no bearingness [Applause] it ain't supposed to if if you if you living amen the right life you've crossed over into the baptism of the holy ghost which is the promised land for the day there shouldn't be no barrenness in this church i don't know about any other church but it shouldn't be none in this church oh glory to god see if and if i could ever get to where i want to go i can show you that right that's the law of god that's the word of god come on brother see we gotta drive that devil [Applause] come on come on we got to dry that down cause i know he want a baby i watched him last week with that little baby in his hand i said lord he gonna be a good daddy just just tell them just tell god how many you want you say brother spider you getting out of hand i supposed to be out of hand that's what the bible said that's what the bible says brother troy come on then the bible said not supposed to be no baroness up in this place i want to see him have a baby i want to see him and rachel had that baby [Applause] glory to god glory to god if sinners can have babies why not righteous people have babies [Applause] brothers and sisters trying to live right now ain't in my notes i ain't have no notes come on i ain't got on my notes yet i've been doing this a little while now who do you say this is [Music] [Applause] oh that's just brother smiley i'ma ask you again who do you say this is huh the presence of the lord is here the presence of the lord is here i can feel him in the atmosphere the presence of the lord is here oh glory to god [Music] [Applause] the bible say wanna put a how many to a flight come on y'all help me y'all bout to read two will put ten thousand we got enough to chase amen devils all day long up in this place [Music] if you let the devil ride he'll want to drive but he ain't driving nothing here we kicking him out in the car [Applause] amen amen it's the knowledge of the word that makes the difference for us [Music] right amen it's the knowledge of the word that makes the difference god i ate up my time come on brother branham he he starts out he he defined uh to restore right he says uh it's a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its original owner where it belongs therefore some way it went out from its rightful owner and can wander around that's that's uh restoration abroad tree um verse 83 yeah um my page here um therefore some some way it went away from his original owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring back to to it who really owns it to bring it back to its natural state i just want to get to a point where it was that the first time to bring it back to its natural condition thank god for that right and in order to do this right he says we have a right to enforce right now listen to this if there is a law right right look at our context we're operating according to the see we got to know how to what right right how we're operating we're sons of god we've nailed that down we we've been brought back i'm no longer a sinner there's therefore now no condemnation right i'm not living under condemnation don't try to put me under condemnation right glory to god let me pull off my glasses right quick young people y'all hear me real good you might be struggling young people struggle adult struggle right if you're a young person this morning and you're struggling i'm here to tell you you don't have to struggle right you don't have to struggle you don't have to live in condemnation you just make things right now and keep it moving huh donny mcclurkin said saint is just a sinner who fell down but he he gets back up again right you see why he said because i want to see a man another generation like we were right yeah amen like we work we're on fire come on let me show some hands that that came up when we came up there y'all go there y'all ghosts praise the lord amen huh amen we were on fire we were on fire we were doing things in the church glory to god running things in the church there's got to be a generation coming on who know who they are and understands they their rights glory to god glory to god at some point amen we got to be able to pass the baton glory to god we can we getting older right somewhere some young man got to come forth who'll go here i am just preach that right glory somebody who can come and find that position right so he says we have see and i thought this is powerful right we have rights see one thing about the devil the devil know he has rights brother brother make that statement he says the devil has a right to stay there as long as unconfessed sin i don't care how much oil you pull on folk the devil like boy i ain't got to go nowhere i ain't leaving you screaming holler all you want i ain't going nowhere as long as it's unconfessed in there oh my god ain't going nowhere y'all gonna get you another bottle of oil two or three i ain't moving but once a person make those things right fellas we gots to go he knows his rights he he know now god can enforce glory to god amen he said we have a right to enforce he said if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration he says if some somebody stole some property and they're holding the property cap captive then you can take see watch this the law we got something that we're basing this on right see we got the law i thought i was reading down like well i'm gonna stand on something i was riding in my car i'm like glory man why do these things make you happy brother smiley because i'm walking in victory i'm trying to walk in all the victory that i possibly can and it's got to be by this understanding amen given to us by god yes sir right amen he said so uh they're holding the property captive right then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces or enforces this person to restore his property back right to his natural owner into its uh libel first to state enforcement he said oh my what a text what and see this this is this is powerful right this this this is this is powerful glory to god yeah he did he probably could have took a lot more than two days on this right amen so then he he says 80 uh verse 88 he says enforced then we have the privilege to enforce upon satan see listen church this is why this is why the thing watch this now the thing that brother jack and these brothers have been preaching to us has been the law the word right because you got to go to satan with something that's right you're going into court and everything and you got a clueless lawyer you're going to jail you're going to jail huh go get your clueless lawyer smart people go get the best that they can fight i i don't care i don't care how uh what they done done huh they gonna get them uh f lee bailey uh uh uh what was that johnny cochran it's worth the money criminals keep good lawyers why they know the law they know how to the loopholes you make one mistake and they got you one mistake out as a lawyer as a police officer even as a ju you made one mistake they said oh i got you now right all i need is reasonable doubt right all i'm trying to do is get him off see the law is important you got to know i'm going amen the law says you know we we live in and i was i was reading this article especially nowadays well squatters people that rent your property right they come in and boy it's hard to get rid of them i remember brother jack brother jack was doing a service for brother uh in okeechobee uh uh the the house that you overseeing in okeechobee sherman brother sherman so brother brother brother jack had called me up and he said riding around i might need you to go so brother jack goes to do a service and when he gets there he realized oh somebody up in here huh a squatter a man the man hadn't got in the house changed the locks on the house and everything else everything else it's actually like man i ain't bothered with this he went call the police police ain't nothing i could do ain't nothing i could do brother jack wasn't the owner he was just trying to do a service brother sherman had to come back to florida and go to court to get the man out why laws laws loopholes you leave your property for a minute people can come somewhere this guy nice house 300 some thousand dollar house living in it they can't get involved he don't went and got papers he don't win and got papers huh papers they can't get him out his his his neighbors want him out you're like man eyes i ain't going nowhere ain't paid now and died for it all he did was we got him some papers why because the house was left alone see and because of the law he can stay there there's nobody amen forcing mouth loophole in the law see come on come on this i'm telling you church this is powerful this is powerful dude like like like uh uh uh brothers you say this ain't skim milk now all right this is real powerful see this these things change our views change the way we look at life changes the way we walk and things of that nature because we have an understanding of the law right yes sir right amen glory to god he says have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god has given us right amen he said for god has a law and his word is a law god in this word made certain claims to the church see therefore we have a right we ain't playing with no devil see i know why i say stuff y'all be looking at me crazy and keep looking at me crazy but i ain't shallow i know i said to that young man what i said we can make certain claims because of the law see it ain't my words is what's been given to us all of us by god that's right amen see we can enforce that glory to god god has a law his word is a law god in this word married certain claims to the church therefore i like this we have a right to enforce these claims upon satan say give it back he has to do it because we can take god's agent the holy spirit go right down on your knees and say thus said lord he's got to say that again not maybe he's got to give it up huh he's got to get you know what church let me tell you something it didn't matter no matter how long it took sarah was gonna have that baby why because his word said to abraham through sarah through through sarah not not through a some slightly doubted way it was going to come and and bring forth for well it's i'm coming huh he said sarah gonna have a baby huh sarah might say you could gonna take one of you know you know my my right concubines or whatever it might be and and and have a baby through her not that ain't what god said see god god operates i like this god operates based upon what he said huh god if if if god said it that me up in here huh if god said it that settles it if god said it that settles it if god said it now if you say it then i don't know about it because we wish you watch it one minute i love you praise the lord the next minute no but if god said it that settles it see god gives us this privileges see glory to god amen he said the the law of the land is to enforce i'm gonna keep moving try to get a few more these before my time is up my time probably up he said but the law of the spirit of god is to enforce satan to give it up that which he has unrightly deceitfully taken from god souls of men he took from god souls of women cheering sicknesses of the body he placed upon people where god made them in his image to be like him and the church is given the the church is given the rightful legal rights by the bible we just packing this thing up under our arms we got legal rights by the bible to take the holy spirit and enforce upon the devil that'll make you pick your head up if you walk in here this morning with your head hung down pick your head up glory to god glory to god amen and force upon him he said now therefore that's the law now the only that uh the the now the one that's here to enforce the law is the holy spirit how about people who don't even believe in the holy spirit would you reject him oh my he says you're rejecting your own peace and mercy when i when i said that i'm like my god my god a couple more and i'ma go i'm just trying to get something over to you watch this see we gotta operate right amen in the lord brother branham he starts talking about uh i'm a bypass let me see okay uh 101. he says now the only way uh he can work is when we we we let him work see you've got to believe it there's a law oh if i ever get to my text i feel like him this morning he said there's a law there's a law given amongst everything now watch he starts to talking about a fish you say why did he bring this out he said because a fish there's a law and a fish right that that you know it could hold his breath and go down we can't operate in that law huh see i can't operate in that law right he said uh a bird right most birds don't have to take off running well i gotta get up to a certain speed and then i'm a flat my way no there's a lot in him when he ready to go huh ain't no running well well i hope i can get there no no no he oper he's operating based upon the law of of of of the animal kingdom the bird king however you want to say it right y'all smart people y'all figured out right he just he operates he said why are you saying that i thought it was a great thought brother brown was trying to teach us something right right amen there's a law given and we gotta operate based upon the law that's been given to us amen and sons of god that's all right come on church come on church because if if if you don't understand these things we're going to be in and out up and down pole me whiles he wows he was well god got for you you're going to get it don't worry about that brother smiley this listen i ain't because you're the only thing i'm concerned about standing god is that right standing guard letting god use me i was i was listening to uh a song got taped this week and it was talking about decreasing that's that's the that's the key the more

life i've been places i've been places that i never thought i'd go brother jay never thought i'd go to europe i've been to england belgium france canada jamaica haiti uh and planning to go in some more places right never thought about it there's friends that i have only been around in a circle in a circle one corner of riviera beach to the next corner and back barely know what miami looked like god took a nobody to all of these places i haven't been all i don't know how many states in the in the united states got friends all over god did that brother brother branham talked about when he was young coming up he said because of his family name he said folk didn't like him say he be walking down the sidewalk they cross over the street that's bad like he was a that's right huh then he got god did something for him and gave him a gift he got now he got to run from them takes him down he got to go to the woods sometimes he said he went to the world not just a hunt just to get away to relax god gave him the finest right the finest of guns to hunt with right glory to god amen the finest of cause the fineness of clothes right god did that right oh glory y'all ready to go [Music] out there for another 30-40 minutes well we're gonna go i i ain't gonna wait yeah i don't believe in that but i just want to get get another two or three things and i i will go you know my mama told me boy you preached too long on sunday maya ain't got there yet hey he says now uh he says now in in the beginning he said to fear religious he said we have a law and the law of life in us he says only thing you have to do he says you you you are made and born and placed here in the body of christ as sons and daughters of god you see you don't have to knuckle down to the devil the devil the devil why are we getting the devil more credit than he uh then we ought to hey man see you don't have to knuckle down to the devil you you got a law right right that's the law of the holy spirit and the only thing you know i have to do is just is to know how to let go and let god do we know how to do that amen get out god's way you keep fighting at it and it won't never work when you let go and let god that's all that's all you got to do see we got to learn that cause we used to getting in the way i think i can do this you can't you couldn't save yourself are you gonna save somebody else you can't how to keep your mouth closed things we can't do right let me let me let me let me get out of that all right he said oh if if if i didn't get this he say if i don't get that that's not it it's it is to know that the law of life is in you and you let go and let god then he then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the holy spirit anything that he's promised any claim that he he's given is yours by uh letting go right he says god sent the earth in a law he says um everything in nature works according to god's law right and that's the thing that that we we're just trying to get uh two more things when we go he said let the musicians make their way he says god god has sent all the of his laws to serve him both natural in spirit 119 working according to his word watch this regardless of the conditions condition god don't look at conditions the way we do god just look at what he he said right amen that's how god wants us to operate i'm learning that well it's like this i don't care what it look like i'm only looking at what the words say amen right amen because what it is now is only temporal anyway you you broke now that's temporal you'll get some money come on come on oh glory he says i love that he said i had a scripture on that he said yes sir god sets all of his laws in motion think of it let it soak in that cause we're coming to a healing uh a healing service in a few minutes god sent all of his laws into motion that it must work according to his own word right that's why you don't take i ain't letting nobody take this from me is that right amen um his word his laws has to work according to his word he commanded the son he commanded the moon he commanded the earth he commanded all nature and and they all fall right into line and all the laws work in harmony with god's spoken word and the law of life that's in us will also bring us to resurrection it's got to it's impossible for not ain't that powerful think about that church see this that's why i say the knowledge of these things it takes all the worry why what what are we worried about god's got it all in control right amen uh this is the last thing he says 120. he said now that's the reason he said the law of life that was in christ when the word was spoke and said i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will he leave his soul in hell there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough devils see there wasn't enough anything to keep christ in the grave amen uh his body began to rot because the law of god would bring the word to pass don't let nobody take this from you you gotta operate based upon the word not your feelings not your emotions because in that we up and down one minute we happy the next minute we said no you cannot operate like that you gotta operate based upon the word right amen he said regardless of how little we are uh 122 in this last thing but jackie uh prepare to come he said regardless of how little we are how low we are how important we are how unholy we are how sick we are how afflicted we are the law of god's spirit by his word makes it obey him right see forces the issue brings the change right it brings that's what brings to change the word it forces the condition give it back let me tell you something uh he said no matter what the condition is the law god's word what's the condition to cope with the word right i like that i'm finna go i'm going to go i'm finna go i'm finna go i'm gonna go i'm gonna say this and i'm finna go right see if you came here this morning oh dow i i wonder what they're gonna think about me i don't think

your rights then operating according to the law just so much was in there and a man and uh it's just about knowing who you are and christ right and um brother smiler is just kind of you know making mentions when we when we have knowledge of who we are changes our our views just the way we think about things you know and i mean you know you you look at um if a man is elected president and men or you know now we have a a woman as vice president and people that get to this high office if they got children them children know who they are you just can't handle them any kind of way can't talk to them any kind of way amen because they know who who they can to right and we got to know that we're kin to god we can't let the devil hand us any kind of way i love that i was just as he was reading that quote on brother ramsey say there's a law and a fish when he's in the water he just swims and now you get him out the water he can't do nothing but when they get in the water you're in trouble right and he just he just swims he just does what he does when he's in the water and he talked about how that bird you know if we want to fly we might have to try to get up on the top of some mountain and take off running and amen and try to glide but you know there's a law in us that pulls us right back you can't stay up there that long hey man you gonna come back down parachute and all come bring you down right it's it's like but it was a law and a bird that he'll need none of that he gonna when it when it's time to fly you know what the bird don't pray about it the bird don't fast about it the fish ain't fasting if it's just i'm in one i'm gonna do what i do when i'm in the water and it just kind of struck me and say a fish swims a bird flies but a son or daughter of god speaks [Music] we don't cry we speak and we ain't got to pray about it we ain't got to fast about it we speak because we have a law inside of us we drive devils back and the holy ghostian force is here to pack up everything we say get back my son give back my daughter in the name of jesus i'm taking it all back [Music] we got to know who we are in christ my god my god [Applause] miracles [Music] miracles hallelujah and i'm just i'm i'm i'll tell you what i'll tell you what i tell you what the lord is the lord is moving i don't think it was just brother smiley speaking and man he's coming and i believe the lord using them to confirm some things there to precious brother stephen and sister rachel and i mean we're joining them and believing god it'll be our miracle i'm gonna tell you now brother smiley i'ma need that scripture that you quoted about no baroness in the new land i'm gonna need that one and because we're to take that we're standing on it right and when you're standing on the word uh you just expect god to do what god does you ain't got to do nothing else to just present the word and present your token with the word and watch god do what he gonna do i'm talking about this is this the junction is hearing so there's miracles that happen at the junction amen no devil can stop it and i don't showed y'all through every every junction all the six how different miracles was happening different miracles and we're gonna get here to the seventh and not have no miracles the devil is a lion and let me tell you something i'm not just talk about the miracles that happened in brother branham's day he's not here anymore i think what he preached us to show us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we're standing on that church and let's expect miracles hallelujah amen miracles miracles miracles glory to god my god bless you brother smiley we we we appreciate that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] y'all be seated just for a moment i just give a couple announcements and and i'll tell you uh that last quote um can you go to paragraph 120 again on that on that quote because there was just some things there and i know brother smile was just kind of feeling man my time but but god was speaking god was speaking and just you know he kind of skipped over this one little thing says uh there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough devils there i'm right in the middle of it there wasn't enough devils there wasn't enough anything to keep christ in that grave until his body began to rot now i like i like that it ain't enough devils to stop you from receiving what god has promised you [Music] ain't enough devils he says this he says um before in the grave till his body began to rot because the law of god would bring the word to pass the law of god will bring the word to pass that's not you even doing it yourself that's you allowing god to do it it says in the law of god by the holy spirit brings [Music] if you're dealing with a money problem and you don't pay your tires don't you hang your head down you lift your head up and you tell that devil i ain't even got to fight i will just quote the word to you because what my god promised me is that he's going to rebuke the devour for my sake [Music] the law of god by the holy spirit brings any promise to pass it says you get it and i just love that little part so you get it regardless of the conditions way with sun weight with daughter sickness in the body huh regardless of the condition the word will bring it to pass church we ain't got no we gotta fight no more we can just rejoice we know this thing is already done it is finished i i was i just thought to myself it's just just so perfect the way that the service just went uh the different songs that was song amen and and um and then you know brother smiley come with a sermon like that just just god i'll tell y'all just a little secret [Music] so y'all we looking for a building and we looking i mean we really looking the lord gave us a realtor recently real to say i want to send some letters to a church in your area to see if they'd be willing to sell i'm just going to send them a letter so you know what pastor they didn't respond to the letter at all they didn't respond they said nothing [Music] said um my plan is to go visit the church meet the pastor so i can try to talk to him on your behalf and they did that today i did that today and i'm just waiting i'm just here waiting but i be hearing words like this i'm like god i just i just believe you put exceeding abundant above all i can ask to thank all right something getting ready to break something getting ready to turn oh something changing church i i i feel jesus i i feel jesus y'all forgive me my phone is ringing and everything and my that would have been something i couldn't answer he's a perfect god that's all i can tell you he's a perfect god god is moving he's a weight maker he's a miracle worker he's a promise keeper he's light in the midst of our darkness amen [Music] thank you jesus um tuesday night we will be here [Music] having our terry service and tuesday night and as i say this is a little different service a man and i want to say that yes brother branham set it up a certain way and we want to follow the way that he set it up and what he said is that people that have gifts they come together at a particular time and just sit and wait on the lord and that's that's what we're there to do just wait on the lord so we um we have this service just set aside for this and and uh and i know how to double fight different people i mean some of y'all the lord has given you a gift but when this service come around the devil fight you and tell you you ain't got no gift the devil is lying and what we found out from the very first terry service that god wanted us to hear is yield god wants us to yield and the more we yield the more he does right and um and and and and you know even though um brother smiley said he he had the gift well i don't believe that anointing just came no one time i thank god dated that reason that way for a reason right because now he gonna be able to kind of help somebody else that would come and say pastor it was just bubbling up in me amen because it was bubbling up i mean i we we heard he was grunting i'm like what's going on with brother smiling back here what are you doing we trying to pray next thing he was getting weak in the knees and everything we we were that we are witnesses we saw god next thing you know he does he just took off in tongues see it's something when we give when the environment is just right god can do things so we come in here on tuesday night a man with with an expectation i'm asking those that are gifted a man gifted with tongs gifted with interpretation uh gifted with um i mean i have uh brothers because brother and i'm saying you gotta have three brothers two or three brothers that will have the gift of discernment discernment that would come and just say okay that was from the lord that was from the lord that was from the lord and uh and and the other thing i will tell you we are babes uh trying to get started walking and you know what a baby does sometimes when it tries to walk it stumbles and it falls but do you punish a baby for stumbling and falling you encourage a baby to get back up and keep walking because eventually one day that baby won't stumble and fall no more hallelujah so i'm gonna be patient with god because he's been patient with me and we just let god just do what god does we don't want critics to come to the service [Music] we don't want critics we want people that want to yield to the lord and just allow god to speak through them so that's going to happen amen on this uh tuesday night 7 30 knows that a man that will be at home just just keep the saints in prayer that god would just speak amen to us and through us amen on that night wednesday night service amen we'll uh will um go through our stream facebook and through twitter don't forget that and uh friday night is our uh first friday night of the month and we always have a tape that we listen to and we do that at home amen so the friday night tape that you'll listen to in your houses will be where has thy strength gone samson where has thy strength gone samson and i look like that's gonna connect very well with the sermon that was just preached here today so uh but uh so just keep those things in mind also uh keep brother smiley and myself uh we'll be traveling on next week going to arkansas so keep us in prayer that god would just bless a man our uh going amen and not coming back uh that god would just use us in a special way i was sitting in my house yesterday and and just kind of getting some things um prepared for um some teaching that i got to do this week and you know as i'm sitting there i got a brother who sent me a he went to the church website and put in a prayer request and it's pretty much saying brother jack would you pray about coming to visit us in alaska i said wow what the brother put a prayer request on my website all right okay this is this i never seen nothing like this before but okay brother i said well we'll pray about it and uh you know so i reached out to him i'm just kind of talking to him told him we'll keep things in prayer and so i'm sitting there then i get a text another brother say brother are you free any time in august to come up to north carolina i said my god uh lord i'm not asking for none of this god what is this say lord i say i just pray brothers that's all i can do is pray then another brother called me about seven o'clock say brother would you come and speak to our men in september i say lord jesus god what is this i said lord give me some wisdom on how to handle this because i'm not looking for none of this but i know god is moving and i know that like i was telling my brother i want to be i want to just be in this wheel that's all i just want to be in god's will whatever whatever that is but uh but y'all just keep us in prayer we you know we're just trying to find you know just the mind of god for a lot of these things and uh and and the the the the thing for the men uh they told me that all of our brothers would be invited now we can't have all the brothers go to a meeting y'all understand what i'm saying it's a it's a meeting for men and sometimes you hear things like that why start thinking it's for the brothers yeah let my husband please send my husband up there to that meeting he might come back with something new so truthy now but uh but but but but uh just you know they told me they're gonna i'll i'll put the announcement there on the board for for the brothers when it comes i'll let you know but uh if it's something like that for the man you know in the in the denomination world they do things like promise keepers and they try to do that for men but this is something where brothers have a message get together and i think they have a limit to 120 brothers that they're going to invite whatever you pay the fee going to cover your food and cover your lodging and all of that but i think it'll be something really really nice if some of the brothers were able to attend uh that's going to be in september but a lot coming up a lot coming up and uh we just want to be ready for what god's going to do next weekend brother jinger boat we'll be here preaching amen for the church and and i just know god gonna move again i know god gonna move again so uh keep the services in prayer our giving is the same as it as it has been those that want to give online you have paypal or a cash app that you use those that are in the house of god we have a wooden box on the table make sure you use the wooden box amen for your giving and those that would like to just mail something in you have the the address to the church amen the temporary address to the church is there on the bottom of the screen praise the lord amen we are pilgrims passing through and we are under expectation for god is getting ready to take us glory glory let's pray father we are appreciative of the service that we've had here today the word that has been brought to us the songs god just feel like a an environment my atmosphere has been set for you to do some miraculous things because you always do miracles at the junction so we're under expectation lord looking for things uh that are beyond even our expectations we're we don't know what'll happen father i believe restoration has begun even uh today i'm expecting somebody to as maybe there's something that's on the stream because they don't feel comfortable coming to the house of god based on where they are god i believe you're going to give them a freedom and a deliverance god that they would be able to come back into the house of the lord and worship you the way that you created them to worship you i believe lord the holy spirit has come here today to help us to understand that we have rights and we can operate according to the law of god we can enforce our claims upon the devil and he has no other option but to release and give back what has been stolen from us if he's taken our health health must be given back if he's taken our children children must be giving back if we've taken our finances finances must be given back whatever it is that satan has stolen it must be given back if he's taken the joy of salvation then that joy has to be given back father we're under expectation for you to do great things we see you're moving in our midst we act your blessings upon our giving we ask your blessings upon our going out as you bless us as we came in and lord you see the the many saints lord that were not present today some lord or on vacation and some doing other things god but just pray your blessings upon those that were not able to be here and that they would go back and look at the tape and be encouraged and strengthened lord by the word that was presented to us today oh god we love you we praise you we see you doing so much in our midst and lord as we just prepare ourselves god for this tuesday night service we ask that

the scripture that's not an emotion that's my new feeling that's on the scripture and it's going to be just as god said it's going to be and now don't let the devil reason make you reason and think that promise only applies to the children of israel going into they promised that no we have a promised land today and every promise that god gave them we standing on right now [Music] oh hallelujah amen [Music] amen i'm gonna just i'm gonna i'm gonna just put this mic down because uh i know you know the devil is something else you know i'm um you got young people living for god and doing right keeping themselves till they get married and then the devil can come and say you can't have a child that devil's a lion [Music] god will reward them for their stand [Music] that's why brother smiley said just tell them how many you want now that's all you need to do just tell them how many you want [Music] just tell them how many won't oh [Music] um that was for me not cause he called my name but this morning i woke up early and i was laying in bed and i came to like a resolve that i would never have kids and i was like i'm okay with that maybe god just wants me to be the cool all right and i'm okay god if you don't want me to have kids i'm fine with that and um and then i was just at peace that everything was gonna be okay so when he said it even though he was speaking to stephen i was like that was god confirming to me that the promise that do you mind if they pull up one more scripture genesis 30 22 was a scripture that god gave me to hold on to and i always quoted in fact when our house was being built we wrote it on the foundation of our house before they laid the towel and god remembered rachel and hearken to her and open her room and last sunday well earlier this year delshna came to me and she asked me why don't you have a baby and i said because i'm waiting on god she said god's going to give you a baby i said i believe it she said thank you and walked away so last sunday she came to me and she put she said let me hear the baby and she put her ear to my stomach i said there's no baby yet but it's coming and she touched my heart and she said keep believing god's gonna give it to you and i said i know and she said before this year and i said i know you told me and she said okay and she walked away and so when he said that it was just confirmation to me from everything i've been holding on to and the the first thing that popped in my mind when you said that was that scripture that i just got to keep holding on to that scripture [Music] [Applause] god bless you sir rachel the rachel has been on my heart for prayers i've been praying for you was it last year or two years mother's day and asked brother jack we were watching mother's day to go and
