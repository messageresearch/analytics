and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed the man and God blessed him and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth this is what made you fathers amen obeying this commandment but that wasn't all he had for us as as children of God and have the fish Over the Sea over the of the air for every living thing that moveth upon

stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the East nor from the West nor from the South but God is judged he puth he putteth down one and sth up another for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup

as it was pointed out I want to just wish everyone a Happy Father's Day all the fathers a Happy Father's Day amen um just really good to be uh back in the house of the Lord amen uh if you have your Bibles turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 8 I'm always humbled by the opportunity to come and just minister to the bride of Christ amen sorry about that we'll have two opening scriptures um Ecclesiastes 8 and then also have your Bibles ready to turn over to First Kings chapter 2 so I don't know what kind of preaching is going to happen this morning all I know I just want to talk about God Amen so it's a it's a thought that I shared with the church back home and after I shared it there was some more that the Lord just kind of opened up to me about and um so it's it's just a simple little thought and brother Braham had made reference to this individual on a couple of occasions but he tied it to his interaction with David but then when I started looking at um this individual in the scripture there's a lot more to it than I didn't realize before maybe you may have but it's just worth repeating these things and uh there's some lessons that at least that I took away from that was a blessing to me so I trust that it's a blessing to you so if you're there in Ecclesiastes say amen amen amen and then we'll read at verse um we'll start at verse one and it says who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that in regard of the oath of God be not Hasty to go out of his sight oh stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him verse four is are kind of like the uh the the Pinnacle of this scripture where the word of a king is there is power amen amen so turn with me to First Kings we use that scripture just to kind of lay a foundation and this is kind of um going to be the theme here so First Kings chapter 2 verse 36 and it's a bit of a reading so just bear with me so 1 Kings 36 1 Kings chapter 2:36 and we'll read through verse 46 and it reads and the King sent and called for shimia and said unto him build thee a house in Jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth go and go not forth hen th any wither for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passes over the brook Kidron Thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head and shimi said unto the king the saying is good and that's by interpretation he said amen to the preaching of the Gospel so he was in agreement with that yes sir and uh as my Lord the King has said where the word of the king is there is power sir so will thy servant do and shimi dwelt in Jerusalem many days and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the Servants of shimi ran away unto akish son of makah King of gath and they told shimi saying Behold thy son servants be in gath and shimi arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to aish to seek his servants and shimi went and brought his servants from gath and it was told Solomon that shimi had gone from Jerusalem to gath and was come again and the King sent and called for shimi and said unto him did I not make thee to swear by the Lord and protested unto thee saying know for certain on the day thou goest out and wst abroad any wither Thou shalt surely die and thou said unto me you said that word the word that I have heard is good you said Amen to that word you agreed to this why then thou Hast not kept the oath of the Lord and the Commandment that I have charged with thee the king said moreover to shimi th knowest all the wicked n which thine heart is privy to that thou did to David my father and I'm trying to restrain myself I'm adding little points here but we'll come back to this therefore the Lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head and King Solomon and King Solomon shall be blessed and the Throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever so the king Comm commanded bah the son of jeida which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon let's bow our hearts gracious Heavenly Father we come before your throne of grace we thank you for this opportunity that afforded unto us and dear Lord it it bestows me with great honor dear Lord that I could just have the opportunity and the privilege to address your bride and father dear Lord I'm reminded of what your Prophet say that the closest thing to Heaven here on Earth is the Pulpit there's just such sacredness that goes behind standing behind this sacred desk dear Lord guard my lips from saying anything contrary to your word and as your people open up their hearts to Lord use me as a vessel that you could Minister Your Truth unto them your word unto them and father may you bring the Lord salvation may you bring healing may you bring Deliverance may you open up our eyes the Lord and I'm reminded also of what you prophesy that any man with any ability of his own can flip back the pages of the Bible but it takes the Lamb of God to come and break bread with us dear Lord you're more than invited in this place you're welcome in this place come and speak to our hungry Hearts we commit all things into your hands in Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated I don't think I'll be long but you know it's like one preacher said that Peter preached about 30 minutes and Paul preached a full night he says I'm somewhere in between so um the Bible you know we open up the scripture with the Bible says where the word of the where the word of the king is there is power there's nothing more preeminent there's nothing more uh powerful than when a king says a word and the thing about it is that when God speaks he doesn't speak with a stutter God's very clear about what he has to say about his word right God didn't stutter when he made a decision about you no sir so when God looked at you he says that's my chosen right and that's an absolute yes sir it was a prophet who told us that this word of God is an absolute men you know they write stories and the right Chronicles and the right editions and there's a third edition and the fourth edition and the fifth edition because man is ever learning right he's ever coming to his senses and he's ever learning something that he didn't know before but when God spoke the thing from the very beginning it's established in the end yes sir so when God saw you from the beginning it's established in the end the in between does not matter to God he's going to work with you in the in between people may cast their judgment on you but it doesn't change God's judgment about you amen because where the word of the king is it is established regardless of your opinions about me your opinions about your brother or your sister whether you think they're going to make it to the Rapture or not whether you think they're going to have a body change or not your opinions does not matter about my salvation God made that decision about me yes sir Hallelujah and so therefore I'm relling upon God's word because where the word of the king is there is power yes sir and so that's the reason why I believe in the in Genesis and the Bible says God said let there be right there was an absolute right there was an assurity when God spoke right let there be and the Bible says and there was it was not where let there maybe be perhaps it may happen and I hope it comes to pass but in that same vein that God was saying let there be and he was speaking the world into existence because the world the Earth was out of the world of the Earth was in chaos yes sir it was in disorder it was in a chaotic State and the Bible says there was darkness that shrouded the Earth and God says Let There Be and the light was already there he didn't call the light for creation the light was already there but there was a darkness that veiled the earth and the Very word that spoke Let There Be remove the shroud of Darkness from the earth and the seed that was already on the inside of the earth brought forth and that is a perfect type of you and I so when God saw you in your sinful State he says Let There Be yes and the dark darkness that shrouded your heart when you were in Wicked sin that Darkness left that Darkness was unveiled in the seed that was already on the inside begin to materialize and produce a child of God amen amen so where the word of the king is there is power Hallelujah and it's upon this idea that we're preaching this gospel this morning so turn with me because we're going to do a bit of reading to 2 Psalms 2 Samuel 2 Samuel you love the Lord amen 2 Samuel chapter 16 2 Samuel chapter 16 everything happens for a reason yes we may not have the answer we may not know why but everything happens for a reason Not Mere chance am and so we're introduced to shimi for the first time in this scripture reading and this is a reading that you are all familiar with whether you've read it or the prophet quoted and I'll read the first two verses and I'll give you a background and when the and when King David came to buam behold F came out a man of the family of the of Saul whose name was shimi now that's important the son of Gara he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at David and at all the Servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left so shimi comes across David now at this point David is on the run right and let me kind of paint a background because you know I often wondered and I'm kind of working on the thought here is a a lesson on a making of a devil and cuz I I I struggled at one time to understand what was it that uh the Bible says in Revelation where the dragon drew a third right of God's uh of God's angels by a third of God's angels and I and I say to myself what sermon could he have possibly preached that could have been convincingly enough to persuade a third of God's angels that that's the man I need to follow come on now and I saw that in the in the interaction with absolum and David right and I'll just give you a little bit of snippet because what happened was that Absalon was H was a was an offspring of David his own son uhuh grew he watched him grew up from when he was just an infant to a grown man and as Absalon grew up and David had other children as well and so Absalon had his eyes fixed towards the throne he wanted to replace the position that his father was in Lord and so let me just pause it real quickly we know the story story of Saul and David and how they were in constant battle actually it was Saul's men that was in constant battle with David's men right and the Bible says that David behaved himself wisely around Saul yes sir that even when Saul had died David didn't say hooray my enemy has died but he was humbled about that and he even cried the humility that he shown but there was Strife between Saul Saul's house and David's house and there were and there was a there were there were Waring factions but God had anointed David and his men David in particular to rise up to become king cuz God not how turned his his attention away from Saul and so at one point Saul's kingdom was a thriving Kingdom he had a a a group of people that was of of royalty they were preeminent they were they were prestigious they had respect right and so wherever they went people say this is of the House of Saul but when Saul no longer served God his kingdom began to crumble right and so God now turned his attention to David and everything that was attached to Saul be to fall apart and so shimi the Bible says he was of the House of Saul and we'll come back to that point and so in the meantime you find Absalon being raised in front of David and now he has his eyes set upon the throne right but he can't just overthrow because he knew that the people's hearts are for David God had established him as a king yes sir Lord God had established him as a king and so when people uh when as people interacted with David Absalon saw that he says I can't just go up there and just take take take take take the seed of power I have to be more cunning than that right I have to be a little bit more discreet in that yes sir so what happened was that as people would go to the gate to offer their petitions to David and they they would bring their petitions to David and David would judge the matter of the people absolon says oh if the people could now come to me instead of going to David that's important because instead of going to David abson says you know what for these people that's in this region rather bringing your concerns to David by the way I'm David's son the people didn't know any different who am I to question the son of a king right right rightow my Lord so rather bringing your matter to David you just bring your judgment to me and all of a sudden at that moment that person becomes an authority figure right so the people brought the matter to Absalon and says I have this issue and I have that issue and Absalon judge the matter and you know what the people's like I like the way you judge when I have another issue I'll come back to you you're just the person I need and so they keep coming back and that's the reason why it's so important you know even as a even as an associate Minister I'm very guarded with how I interact with the people and how they see me versus how they see my pastor because when someone comes to me and talks to me and say BR I got a question for you the first thing I say is did you talk to brother Stacy cuz I don't want to ever be replaced I don't want to be in that position I don't want to be a tool in the hands of the devil right right right amen hallelujah bri can I get your opinion about something that's very dangerous sir come on y'all y'all can get quiet on me I know you got to be guarded because the devil's looking for a vessel to work through yes sir amen that's the truth and the Bible says that Absalon this is what got me Absalon stole the hearts of the people yes sir stole the hearts of the the people didn't willingly give it they stole it because who are the people to question the King's son in the first place and so the people started to bring their matter to Absalon the son instead of bringing it to David and through that he strategically started doing things here and I'm just it's it's the making of a devil but I I I'll get to it some other time but he started doing some things here some things there he started winning 10 people uhhuh uhhuh 15 people 100 people yeah and let me tell you the devil he works he knows how to talk he knows how to work yes yes sir cuz we're the bride that's the reason why I'm so guarded with what I say to you as a bride because I don't want my word to be replaced with what the pastor preaches to you if someone got an issue with my family don't go to my wife to come to me right amen cuz I'm the head of the household I make the decisions I'm responsible for my family and I collaborate with my family right right right amen amen but when somebody's like oh I talk to your wife while like why you talk to me right she's going to come back and talk to me anyhow right brother amen but that's the reason why so important for us to be in our position good so what happened was that as Solomon's influence was building up as as as absolum influence was building up David started to see what was happening and it was being murmured around them that absolum is growing in power and the Bible says that the conspiracy that's what the Bible says the Bible says that the conspiracy was great so people had feelings that you know what I don't know about this anymore because the moment you start saying things you start talking things and a man may come win your heart next thing you know whenever your pastor gets up here and he preaches he's like well that's not the way brother so and so stated it to me that's not the way I heard it when I visited this church that's not the way that's not the way he told it to me we start building these these these unintended barriers and we begin to criticize and we see things differently because someone planted a seed that shouldn't be in the first place am yes amen amen you're not obligated to brother Jean you're obligated to God amen amen amen amen amen and as absolum started to grow in power David's like I don't want any strife I don't want anything to do with my son's you know kind of situation here so he begins to kind of take flight he begins to run because his his kingdom is now being brought into question is beginning to kind of lose its stronghold and so a few of David's loyal men his Mighty Men followed David and went with him but shimi that's where we get here shimi saw David and his men and he sought an opportunity because now David was in a weak State and that's the way the devil treats you it's whenever you've been in a position that where you've been blessed you've been highly favored and you going through trials in your life and now you're down in the dumps and the Devil comes and appears his real ugly head that's right yes sir he want to cast some stones at you you thought you were somebody at one time the devil want to H any sort of insults just to make you feel little than you already feel when you're down in the dumps know what and the reason why is because he's holding a grudge because he remembered how God blessed you back in the day that's the reason why the devil has something against you because he knows how much God loves you yes sir he knows how much God favors you he knows how much God bless you let me tell I don't care how deep in the dumps you are it didn't change David's status he was still King yes amen no matter how deep and sin that you may get and the devil drags you into sin it does not change that seed on the inside God looks at you and still sees that you're a child of God someone may be gunning for your seat they could do all the best to try to get a hold of your seat but what God has given to you is for you nobody no Spirit no devil can take the blessings that God has given unto you Hallelujah I don't care how many Saints get to the other side my seed is reserved amen amen what God has given to you is for you sir you might be in your lowest of lowest point in your life it doesn't change the election it does not change predestination right amen amen hallelujah amen because it's in that moment in this moment where David is weak with his man he's outside he's not sitting on the throne he's not sitting in his big Temple he's not that's when the that's when the Devil comes and start hurling insults he start casting Stones look at you oh my you're not even in church when you're supposed to be in church you're not even praising God that you're supposed to be praising God you're sitting in church is going through the motions oh my casting Stones why because he remembered Jimmy I remembered when he was part of that royalty of Saul where how people realized who he was that he was somebody and that he was somebody of importance because you know he was of that family Saul's family the household and now that's crumbled to nothing it's in shambles it doesn't even exist anymore and now the same Fate has come to David and so shimia says this is my opportunity say what you did to me has come to you yeah let me tell you Saints just because someone's going through a trial doesn't mean that God has abandoned them Hallelujah just because you see someone's beaten up doesn't mean they lost the fight sir sir come on somebody I've never been in a fight where I haven't gotten a black eye but I always say you should take a look at the other guy cuz I'm going to fight every inch of ground that God has given to me exactly right amen we're in this fight all the way to the end yes of course I'm going to have bruises of course I'm going to have wounds but I'm not going to give up because he that has called me is greater Hallelujah and shimi came to him and said look at you your man let me tell you the Bible Jesus said if they hate me they will hate you too right true if everything's hunky dory for you you might want to go back and check your salvation we're in a battle I know I don't have a lot of friends that's right people don't like when whenever they come to me and say well I pray for you they may not like that they may not like my language but I'm built different I'm called for a different purpose yes sir amen oh and so when chimia he wasn't only casting stones at David he was casting stones at David's friends to the left the Bible sis and to the right and let me tell you these AR little these are little Pebbles I'm talking about these are some big chunks of rocks yes sir that that'll probably that had edges on them and if they hit you they're going to hit you pretty bad he had he had anger that was built up for years people hold a grudge just because they see you every day being blessed and they're watching you just waiting for that opportunity for you to slip up and mess up let me tell you but God who has brought me this far is able to bring me the rest of the way Hallelujah yes sir yes sir they may be looking at me but let me tell you I'm going to be in that mountain the same God that's in the Mountaintop is the same God that's in the valley the Bible says y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me sir yes sir thy rod and thy staff sometime God got to give us a good whooping amen you might be looking at a brother sister he might be down in the dump just leave him alone God's giving him a whooping he might have done something that God needs to whoop him on don't cast him out don't tell him he's not a leg don't stop praying for him you continue to pray for him yes Hallelujah yes Lord brother amen my God and thus s when he curs come out come out verse 7 thou bloody man Thou Art Thou man of be he called him the devil my Lord yes sir this was this was anger that was that had been bubbled up for years and was waiting for an opportunity and now here he David is no longer in his throne he's on the run his own son his own flesh and blood came and took over the kingdom and he's looking at and shim season oppos say good for you the Lord listen to this verse eight the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the the house of Saul you know see people are so blinded by their own rage they misunderstand what you're going through thinking that God is veng is avenging them they're so blinded the Bible says wo to them that call evil good and good evil he was so filled with rage he didn't even know what was happening to David the blood of the House of Saul and who St thou H has rained who St it should have been Saul he's telling you it should have been Saul that should have rained but who and he didn't realize that the making of David as a king was God's doing yes sir you never asked to be blessed God blessed you anyhow amen and that's what gets the devil even more upset sir you just be minding your own business you just say Lord I love you Lord I appreciate you and the blessings of God just keeps pouring Lord thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy and the blessings of God keeps pouring and the devil looks at that he says I hate you hall hallelujah let me tell the devil's not here to make friends with you Saints hate is a strong word and I can't find another word much greater than hate if you know just let me know but the devil hates you that's right yes he does yes sir and whose house out there and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalon he's stolen some insults he says star of rain and not only that your son is not rainning in this Kingdom and behold thou are taken in thy Mischief because thou are a bloody man it's come back to you then said abashi verse 9 the son of Zariah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his head next verse the Bible says and the King said what have I to do with thee thy sons of Zariah so let him curse because the Lord has s unto him curse David who shall then say wherefor thou H has done so let me tell you sometimes it's so easy for you to kind of curl up your lips and give somebody a piece of your mind but I know the scripture the Bible says be still and know that I am God you don't need to defend yourself God will defend you yes sir amen I wish I was ready to Stow some Stones back oh I got some Choice words for you too shim you think you're and King David like calm down uhuh let just let don't don't don't it's God doing this you don't need to get worked up don't get worked up because somebody say things to you they look you at a certain way they may not Shake Your Hands they may look at you in a sad eye at work at school they might feel funny about you you don't owe anyone any explanation work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you're not obligated to no man but God himself hallelujah amen good ab I wanted to defend this King he's like you know what let me pick up some St man I'm about to do this is getting crazy yeah yeah and David has com and that's that's the importance of leadership how a husband a father a pastor whomever is a leader how he responds to a situation is how his flock responds to that situation amen yes sir it's so important what you say what you do how you do it when you do it all that I got two little eyes that's watching me constantly day in and day out yeah so David as much as I'm sure he probably wanted to just retaliate against shimi he says look I man put your knife away man relax this is God's doing God told him to do this people going to come to you and look at you and criticize you that's true amen maybe you once had a good position and you lost your job look at this look at this right now you ain't nobody my Lord you might be on the verge of losing your house God's getting ready to Humble you you don't know how you're going to keep your car and make your next car payment your children that was so good is now running out there in the world come on those are real things but it doesn't mean that God has abandoned you it doesn't mean that God has left you it doesn't mean that God stopped working with you because there's a there's a good ending to this story yes sir amen hallelujah amen sir be still and know that I am God yes Lord and David said unto abashi and to all his servants behold my son which cometh forth of my bows seeketh my life he said look I know what happened my son seeketh my life how much more now they now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse me curse him for the the Lord ha bidden him and it may be that the Lord will look upon my Affliction and that the Lord will requite me good of for his cursing this day that the Lord may look upon my Affliction Lord you see I'm not retaliating right I'm an eagle I fly over all the chaos and the and and and all the confusion when people are when people are talking and chittering CH uh chitchatting and making statements you fly over these things yes sir you above those things that's the reason why we're in an age because you were meant to fly over all of the nonsense that comes across your way true brother and we're bombarded every waking moment of every day with things that we are faced with and God has given us a spirit and anointing to rise above those things yes sir and the Bible says in verse 13 and as David and his men went by they mind their own businesses just kept on going David and his man as they went by No Doubt Abisha was still looking at shimia I said man you better be glad that David got me just having his eyes on him but kind of restraining himself and shimi went along on the hillside over against them you might be saying you know what I don't got no time for this I'm going to keep walking and that Devil's still peppering things at you still throwing things you trying to be above it and walking and you he's still hurling insults right that devil test your patience but you know what you keep coming back to church keep going back to that word you keep going back to your knees he said Lord be it unto me according unto Thy word brother yes sir and the Bible says and he kept on as he cursed he went on and threw stones at him and cast dust he was doing everything and the Bible says and the king and all the people that were with him came worry and refreshed themselves so that was what happened with shimi and as the story went along there was so much to this Absalon has cels one that was with uh one that was with uh with David and that was true to David and gave counsel to Absalon and one that just revolted against David and was given counsel to Absalon so David worked to put I forget his name but to put this individual in the presence of Absalon to give him counsel and we keep David up to date and so the other individual and these are some names I can't pronounce but the other individual comes to abson and abson says what should we do he says you know what while your father's in the while your father's uh running let me gather about 10,000 men I believe it was the count and let me go over take him and bring and take his life and absam say well that sounds that sounds all right and so he calls David a counsel and just say hey what do you think about this and he's like no you shouldn't do that and he gave him some counsel based upon how God anointed him and so he rejected the other individual and the other individual was so upset with the fact that his Council was rejected the Bible says he went back to his house put his house in order and hang himself killed himself that's how important it this was for him but that his word was rejected by the by the said King and so as they went into battle now David David's men and absalon's men they went into battle and the Bible says that Absalon and this might be gruesome but it's written in the scripture Absalon was riding a mule and as he was In the Heat of the battle he was riding a mule and he came across a Great Oak a big tree yeah and the Bible and the way I could display it the the the the he came across the Oak and he hit his head on the Oak and maybe there might have been a a vshape and his head got hung on the on the oak so it was just stuck like this and the Bible says the mule kept on running and the Bible says he hung Between Heaven and Earth so there he was just dangling couldn't and so a man stumbled across him and saw him and went back and told joab and joab's like you didn't kill him I would have given you 10 shekles I would have given you a girdle just by virtue of telling him the man has enough wisdom than joab who knew David he says look man even if you were giving me a thousand shekels you heard what David said no man touch my son no man touch my son even when he was on the Run he says no man touched my son yeah and so joab dismisses that and identifies a group of men who goes and kills Absalon Absalon dies in battle it gets back to David there's a there's a lot of you could go back and read it in Samuel it goes back to David and rather than people thinking well you think David's going to Rejoice that's his flesh and blood right right right so David lamented and he cried there was a day of mourning joab had a conversation with David to kind of bring David to himself this is all important to where I'm getting to and in chapter 19:9 now that Absalon is dead his kingdom is not crumbling and in verse n and all the people all the people were at Strife through all 19 ver9 and all the people were at Strife throughout all the tribes of Israel saying The King The King saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines and now he is fled out of the land of AB out of the land of abson absolum whom we anointed over us is dead in battle verse 15 so the king returned so now absalon's Kingdom has fallen and David's Kingdom has been returned now it's back to a restoration yes sir yes let's read verse 16 remember shimi he comes back on the scene again and shimi the son of Gara a benjamite now word gotten out that Absalon is no longer King so can you just imagine shimi he's stand there just like that's good for David now where he's going to run to God dealt with him just like he dealt with me and so word got back shim we got some news come on there which kind of news you got David's back on the throne I'm sorry what' you say yeah the King has returned which king you talking about you haven't heard absalon's there how how did this happen he died in battle David's returning so now shimi his heart's racing and the Bible says and shimia the son of Gab benjamite which was of baram hasted and came down with the man of Juda to meet King David what a different attitude yes sir yes sir the Bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess you don't need to fight your battles the Lord fight your battles for you amen every devil is subjected to your words amen amen the King was returning back to his throne yes sir amen shimi hasted he's like I got to go see King David and the Bible says in in verse 17 and there was a thousand men of benj Benjamin with him and Zeba the servant of the House of Saul and his 15 sons and his 20 servants with him and they went over Jordan before the king and there were a fairy boat to carry over the king's household and to down and to do what he thought good and shimi the son of G fell down before the king as he was come over Jordan you know what so fake it is oh King David I'm so glad to see that you've returned yeah when God blesses you you were down in your dumps and and and and God's restored you you're not one to judge people but not every time somebody says well I'm so happyy for you they mean that that's the truth right right oh I'm so happy you got that car they're just as jealous as you don't know what that's a beautiful house you know the hearts full of anger or you got that promotion well congratulations oh my come on Saints true that's the reason when God bless you cuz let's keep reading and the king and it said unto the king let not the Lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went is out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart let not the king impute in impute judgment iniquity unto me verse 20 for thy servant doth know that I have sinned therefore behold I come the first day I come I am come the first this day I was the first one to come King out of a thousand men I was the first one on my knees I was the first to come for thy servant does know that I have sinned therefore behold I am the come I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet the Lord thy King and listen and abashi here we go again abashi the son of Zera answer say shall not s shimi be put to death for this for this because he cursed the Lord's anointed don't criticize someone who criticized you right good good when you were down in your dumps and people criticized you when you're back to your blessings when God has restored you your blessings you don't need to criticize them your blessings enough this restoration that God has given to you is sufficient enough yes it is brother Hallelujah am amen good preaching hallu be blessed in your new home Hall be blessed in your new car be blessed in your job but don't forget who gave it to you don't forget who blessed you because the same God I could give it to you is the same God that can take it away be blessed with your health be blessed with your Prosperity but remember where you came from remember where you got it amen hallelujah and even in that situation David had to teach abish he says look I know he criticized us when we're down in our low and now that the Kingdom's restored you don't need to criticize him just by virtue of how God has placed you has positioned you is sufficient enough to make him feel bad true brother sometimes you're so blessed people don't even know how to act in front of you that's right you don't need to say anything God fight your B Just Just Smile God bless you Sister God bless you brother God bless y'all just know that you're highly blessed you're highly favored of God they thought that you were down in the battle but God was working with you I'll never leave you nor forsake you [Applause] yes sir thank you Lord Jesus I'll never leave you nor forsake you thank you Lord people may look at your situation says man there's no hope for this sister there's no hope for this brother you stay in prayer you stay committed you come to church every Wednesday you come to church every Sunday you stay in that fight and God will bless you for it amen amen yeah shimia was frightened can you just imagine when the first time he got news Hallelujah when David when Absalon died and David now was coming back to his throne he's like what did I say oh my Lord I talked about his family too oh man this is not good at all this a not good at all I got to figure out like I got to make this right you know I'm going to be the first one to go up this say I'm wrong I'm going to try F seek his [Music] favor and abishai he was want to say something he was want he he he enjoys conflict and they like no you don't need to do that just smile and keep walking and when David kept walking you notice that shimia didn't follow whereas before he was still peppering them wherever they were going when David kept them walk he's like God bless y'all the Lord is good the Lord is good God bless you and she and I B I would probably still looking at him as he was walking by cuz he remember what he said to David right but when God bless you you don't need to explain true amen you don't need to defend that's right just be humble about what God has blessed you and just know that he that works in you we'll finish it yes he will amen and David said verse 22 what I have to do with you ye sons of sirri that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there be uh shall there any man be put to death to the state in Israel for do not I know listen to this for do not I know that I am the this day King over Israel let me read that again for do not I know that I am this day King over Israel he's like what are we trying to explain to shimi who is he that I need to explain who I am right right right that's right don't you know I know that I'm a Child of God I don't need to explain myself to shimi sure he cast on sure he threw things sure he's talked about my family sure he was happy but I don't need no explanation God blesses me I'm just going to walk with a smile because God blesses me and not only that he turns and He blesses shimi he says therefore verse 23 the king said unto shimi thou shal not die and the King swear unto him all right so that was with shimi and shimi he heard what David said he's like you won't die cuz David got bigger things to worry about he knew that shimia was acting on what on on Prophecy God he says God told him to do that so David's like you won't die and shimi he looked at David he's like God bless your soul you're a good man and I knew that from the depth of my heart you were man people would say things just to get out of trouble I knew that from the moment I saw you David I knew there was something special about Chief but you know that's just the way it is you know but God bless you y'all keep going y'all keep going so he thought he was free and so now there was a change in leadership and so David was passing over he was dying and so Solomon was now taking on the rain and so David remembered some of the things as men that were loyal to him and those that didn't do as well and then as he was recounting that he calls um he calls over Solomon and he tells Solomon you know remember uh joab and he done this and remember this person he done this and in verse 8 chapter First Kings chapter 2:8 and behold this is n and behold thou Hast with thee shimi the son of G A benjamite of bam which cursed me with the Grievous curse in the day when I went to meim but he came down to meet me at Jordan and I swear to him by the Lord saying I will not put thee to death with the sword next verse now therefore hold him not Guiltless cuz I didn't buy that repentance that dried eyy confession didn't mean anything he just he was just trying to save his own tail cuz he knew he was wrong God doesn't forget these things that's right that's right for th they wise men because that's the first thing that Solomon prayed for when he stepped into his kingdom he said Lord I pray for wisdom to lead the people and knowest what thou ought to do unto him shimi but his whole head bring thou down to the Grave with blood so then we finally get to SEC First Kings where we just read and the King sent so First Kings chapter 2:36 and the King sent sent and called for shimi and said unto him build the a house in Jerusalem and dwell there cuz can you just imagine shimi he gets a call from Solomon he's like um I need to talk to you shimi is probably wondering like I'm wonder if his dad told him something so shimi shows up and he has a he has a an audience with the King King Solomon and the King said called fima said build thee house in Jerusalem andwell well there and go not forth H any wither talking about the Bible say when Paul says God who is rich in Mercy that is a very powerful statement because shimia should have died should have died and yet God is extending Grace unto him and so Solomon says look go and build yourself a house and he says build that house and he says you stay put in that house in Jerusalem and dwell there you stay in the presence of God if God planted you in this church you stay here the word that is being preached is specifically for you that's right specifically for you it's not for your brother it's not for your sister this word of God that's been preached is for you amen you alone are accountable for the word that you're hearing as long as you stay under that blood yeah then your sins will not call you out cuz we live in a world where people don't mind their business being out there but I know I've made some mistakes and I thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ am amen but if we were to replay some of the things that even as Christians that we struggle with many of us would just kind of just squirm in our seats but the blood of Jesus Christ cover all sins amen amen amen and as long as shimi was in Jerusalem and dwelt there he was fine yes sir and when the king for for Shi the day that you leave and pass over the brook Kidron you know what Kidron means Kidron means it means Darkness turbulence great agitation great evil Valley of decision final judgment the moment you cross Into Darkness the moment you go into turbulence you will be agitated great agitation you will be confronted with great evil that's what Kidron mean go look it up in the Hebrew you stay away from that and you stay under that shed blood of the Lamb you stay under that anointed word but the moment you pass over this Brook you're in total darkness wow no compromise there's no middle ground there's no gray areas Lord and thou shall know certain that thou sh surely die thy blood shall be upon your own head and shimi said unto the king amen amen he dodged the bullet again he's like wooo I thought going to kill me but he's just giving me Grace you got it buddy praise the Lord what you say is nothing but the truth be careful that you don't live higher than what you say Amen to amen are we staying together amen cuz it's easy when we're together in company and we say Amen but does your amen extend to when you're out there in the world rubbing shoulders with the world do they see the same brother that I see in church do they see the same sister that I see in church or do they see somebody completely different amen it's all right it could be quiet but we still going to preach the gospel nonetheless Hallelujah cuz I don't want to just be a Son of God when I'm in this building in the company of sons of God I want to be a Son of God at work I want to be a Son of God at school I want to be a Son of God at the mall I want to be a Son of God in my car no matter where I am I'm a representation of Christ yes sir amen amen amen and so so shimia says the saying is good as my Lord the king said so what thy servant do and shimi dwelt in Jerusalem many days and things seems to be going well right and it came past after three years cuz here's the thing right this is the reason why it's important it came past after 3 years because we tend to forget the word that was originally preached to us we were excited the first time we heard it we said praise the Lord man that sounds really good after three years that Pastor come and preach the same message like well that sounds all right praise the Lord God is good God is good that steam that energy that excitement has DED a little bit maybe it's not as important as it was 3 years ago right the same word that was preached 3 years ago is just as important as it is now yes it is amen if you said amen to it the first time you can say Amen to it again TR amen God does not change his ways that's right am amen so shimi held on to what King Solomon said where the word of the king is there is power as long as you stay under this protected word this Blood you're fine Saints yes sir but the devil used two of his servants yes sir hello that ran away unto akish shimia didn't know anything about it he was just minding his own business like you know what God's good and everything's fine like got my house here somebody came up to shim shim what's going on two of your servants left what that became more of a distraction than the word of God where' they go they went to the kid they went over a kids run where they went over kids run yeah I'm I'm just putting myself in that place he he probably thought about it he's like Kidron would I Solomon did say if I cross over Kidron but like what a like I mean it's I mean I'm not going to stay there I'm just going to go there and just grab them and bring him back I mean that ain't going to be a problem right cuz I mean I went out and I came back like I came back I mean that that shouldn't be an issue right so he's thinking about it and he's all worked up because those are that's his servants so shimi got worded that his servants went into gath so he's thinking about he's like you know what if I go and come back let me tell you where God put you you stay there amen there's no tiptoeing outside and coming back amen God doesn't have like a a believer in the house and out of the house where God puts you that's where you belong let let me let me add another Point too this message this word is for you amen amen and only applies to you other people could be sitting in the same building with you and the word has no effect on them they could leave and come back as they may want to that's true without any sort of consequence but God spoke to you am for you there's a consequence you may look at other people I don't get why brother so so get to go out for a whole month and come back and there's no cons quences but the moment I put my feet out because God's dealing with you amen this might sound harsh but God doesn't beat other people's children that's right that's the truth brother God does not speak other people's children I don't want to be mean but listen to me now some of may have flexibility to go in and out they might be sitting under different leadership you're sitting under a different leadership yes sir amen wow I I mean when I was when I was young and I was in uh not not Walmart cuz we it was Kmart and I was with my dad and some kid acting up and you know just making a making a mess of themselves and I'm thinking to myself you know that child could get away with that they have a different set of parents that's right right that parent let them do what they want to do hello but I had a different set of dad I had a different dad that child would act up and I'm looking at I'm like Oh my goodness some of the things they would say to their parents and meanwhile I'm looking at my dad at the corner of my eyes and he's looking at me I'm like you know what I don't want to get in trouble my dad's looking at me at the corner of his eyes and the only thing I could think of saying you know um and this is the only thing that's coming to my mind uh you know father is such a beautiful day today today like you just didn't want to invite anything like I don't want you to think like I'm that child dad I understand your word for me I understand your expectations you can't do what the world does God has a different expectation for you yes sir amen that's right am just because someone else could get away with it doesn't mean you could get away with [Applause] it and if you see somebody going through a trial you let them alone like I said God could be working with them he could be giving them a good spanking getting back in order amen am this word is for you right not for anyone else it may not mean this Bible may not mean nothing to nobody else some message may not mean for no to nobody else but for you it means everything absolutely and they came to pass at the end of three years the two of the servants ran and shimia arose and saded his ass and went to gath he was so blinded by what he was trying to get he like this was mine yeah he ran away unto a Kish and the son of Micah king of gath and they told shimya saying Behold thy servants be in gath and shimya uh and it was told Solomon and it was told Solomon that shimi had gone from Jerusalem to gath and was come again the Bible is not written just haphazardly God's telling you like even when you came back yeah you should have never left in the first place right you should have never left in the first place this is shim laugh yeah he came back that didn't make a difference my God it's like God looking at you like he did what go get him for me real quickly but let me tell you when God when God deals with us it might be harsh but it it remember what the prophet says he says when when the lamb when when the Sheep is out of order and he's kind of drifting what does he do he breaks his leg now you think that's cruel but the prophet also says that same sheep comes to the shepherd and wants to be caressed and wants to be ner nurtured and be healed and that's what God does he breaks you up sometimes spanks you and just puts you in order so that way you can come back to him cuz the Bible says he will not lose not one not one that the father has given unto me I'm wrapping it up and the King s and called for shimi and said did I not make thee to swear by the Lord and protested unto thee saying no for certain on the day thou goest out and walst abroad where the thou shall surely die and thou sth unto me Thy word that I have heard is good we all said amen to the word that we heard today you said amen to the preaching that you heard last week you heard you say Amen to the preaching that you heard the week before yes sir hold on to that word amen amen if you agree that it's true and you say Amen live for it yes sir if this gospel is worth dying for then this gospel is worth living for yes sir as we stand to our feet the king said M to shimi now listen to this the king now at this point when he first met three years ago when he first met shimi he never said what his he never said what his dad said because that was under the blood he says you stay in Jerusalem but the moment you leave that place then everything will come back to you and so here it is thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to David my father therefore the Lord Lord shall return the wickedness upon thine own head if I could admonish you on anything stay under the protected blood stay under that protected word there's no greater salvation than to be found in the presence of God where the power of the king where the word of the king is there is power amen and so shimi we we just walk through his life in his journey and there he was in Jerusalem but he let something that was of no value of no importance it was not greater than the word that Solomon spoke there's nothing greater than What God Says to you that would cause you to leave this word if you said amen to it and you agreed to it the first time to here you are sting standing now you can say Amen to it again sir sir and if the Lord sh ter for another many years you could still say Amen to the word of God and King Solomon shall be blessed and the Throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever so the king commanded bayah the son of jei which went out and fell upon him that he died Saints the word of God is pure the word of God is Rich Stay True to this word no matter what when God bless you be still and know that he's God when you go through your trials he knows how to restore you we love the Lord amen let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for this word that you've given unto us we thank you for this message of Truth and d a lesson that could be gleaned by the life of shimi and father and by the accounts of David and his men and how they dealt with criticism and Misfortune and things that we deal with each day in our lives but father we are reminded that there's a God that watches over us that guides our thinking guides our ways that keeps us blessed and dear Lord as we just proceed and move forward may
