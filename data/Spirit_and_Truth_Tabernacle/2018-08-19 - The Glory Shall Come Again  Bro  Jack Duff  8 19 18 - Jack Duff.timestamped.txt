[34:44] of stuff and then when I was reading the
[34:45] story I just got so much out of it I was
[34:47] like God still has his hand on me so I
[34:51] just am thankful for that and everything
[34:53] so I just want to sing this just want to
[34:57] sing this song and just hope that it's a
[34:58] blessing to you because it's just my
[35:00] personal testimony and if if if nobody
[35:04] else gets happy I'm getting happy

[1:12:09] administering and and also a meeting and
[1:12:11] Tucson that I'll be ministering at but
[1:12:15] also I just want to let the church know

[1:12:18] Tucson in November in November that gets

[1:12:41] appreciate you all amen god bless you
[1:12:44] and certainly want to thank the Lord for
[1:12:48] all the specials that went forth here
[1:12:51] today certainly enjoyed them amen and
[1:12:58] just appreciate all that God is doing in
[1:13:00] our myths man he is a mighty docked a
[1:13:05] man a mighty God thank God for a Friday
[1:13:08] night my precious brother Thomas did a
[1:13:11] wonderful job here just speak into our
[1:13:13] hearts just so many things that he
[1:13:15] shared just kind of come back confirming
[1:13:17] a lot that we had already been talking
[1:13:19] about and I thought the church was about
[1:13:20] the rapture when he said you're going
[1:13:22] over you know with Christ I say oh you
[1:13:26] don't heard that before but we just we
[1:13:29] just appreciate the Lord Jesus a man and
[1:13:32] I'm just speaking to us we know we and a
[1:13:34] Holy Ghost Church a man we were ever
[1:13:38] Holy Ghost church because when God
[1:13:39] speaks and you know to minister don't
[1:13:41] know nothing
[1:13:41] man coming all the way from Ghana
[1:13:44] you know God is in control a man and
[1:13:48] he's done speaking to his people so we
[1:13:50] just we just thank God for that
[1:13:51] and this morning a man those thought
[1:13:55] that I have in my heart you all just
[1:13:57] turn with me to Romans 8 I know that I
[1:14:00] feel God doing something and then I feel
[1:14:04] I feel God doing something and and I'm
[1:14:08] trusting a man that he'll complete what
[1:14:11] he started a man I'm believing him to do
[1:14:15] that and and a trust at the thought that
[1:14:17] he's given me today would be something
[1:14:20] that will kind of connect with what's
[1:14:22] already been going on in this place a
[1:14:25] man on today so I want to read here from
[1:14:28] Romans 8 a man and I'm starting at verse
[1:14:31] 14 it reads as follows it says for as
[1:14:35] many are led by the Spirit of God they
[1:14:40] are the sons of God for ye have not
[1:14:44] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:14:49] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[1:14:52] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the
[1:14:57] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:14:59] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:15:03] and if children then heirs heirs of God
[1:15:07] and joint-heirs with Christ if so be
[1:15:11] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:15:15] also glorified together and and this is
[1:15:19] desperate best a critical part you know
[1:15:21] we were hearing that on Friday night if
[1:15:23] you're going through a trial
[1:15:24] Amen that's a good thing right because
[1:15:28] God is using that in order to bring
[1:15:30] something greater a man out of it you
[1:15:33] know everything that we read in
[1:15:35] Scripture all the stories that encourage
[1:15:37] us we hear about God opening the Red Sea
[1:15:40] we hear about God shutting the mouths of
[1:15:43] lions right we read about God a quench
[1:15:47] in the fire and a fiery furnace
[1:15:50] and a number of other great things that
[1:15:52] happen in Scripture but you realize amen
[1:15:55] and I think even better Kayla was
[1:15:56] talking about Joseph you realized in
[1:15:59] order for us to read those stories
[1:16:01] somebody had to go through a trial you
[1:16:08] understand that right
[1:16:09] that one three somebody had to go
[1:16:14] through something right and not only
[1:16:18] just don't you didn't have to overcome
[1:16:20] right so so if if you're going through
[1:16:23] something God has given you something so
[1:16:24] you can overcome and unless you overcome
[1:16:28] you can't you know yeah let me say like
[1:16:35] there's no case all right no no
[1:16:40] testimony so if the scripture tells us
[1:16:45] for I I'm sorry if kill drew then heirs
[1:16:49] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[1:16:52] be that we do what suffer with him now
[1:16:59] in the midst of what you're going
[1:17:01] through he left you sometimes we leave
[1:17:05] him but he never leave us so the mister
[1:17:09] whatever you go through it's a say if so
[1:17:11] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:17:16] be also glorified together and this is
[1:17:22] the verse that I'm really drawing
[1:17:23] attention to today if we can for I
[1:17:26] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:17:31] present time are not worthy to be
[1:17:35] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:17:40] revealed in us there's gonna be some
[1:17:43] glory revealed in you a man is gonna be
[1:17:47] some glory but is gonna come through
[1:17:48] some suffering all right let's pray
[1:17:51] thank you God for the ability to read
[1:17:54] the Word of God today and we trust that
[1:17:58] the Holy Spirit will take control over
[1:18:01] with folks I am Lord of a aware that
[1:18:06] your spirit is here your presence is
[1:18:08] here your loyalty is here and when your
[1:18:10] Mountain comes got what we're asking
[1:18:12] that the mountain would destroy not just
[1:18:17] break it destroy destroy the yoke of the
[1:18:23] enemy that might be in the lives of your
[1:18:26] people and if somebody has come in this
[1:18:29] place this morning a man satisfied with
[1:18:33] their condition not looking for their a
[1:18:35] yoke to be destroyed we accent that you
[1:18:37] destroyed anyway and father that you
[1:18:40] would get all the glory that you get all
[1:18:41] the honor and all the praise from
[1:18:43] everything that happens in this place
[1:18:45] thank you for your your presence being
[1:18:47] here it's in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:18:49] amen god bless you can be seated the
[1:19:00] Lord a man I want to just use for our
[1:19:06] title today
[1:19:08] the glory shall come again a man the
[1:19:16] glory shall come again and just the
[1:19:20] title of that magnitude is is really
[1:19:24] prophecy right I love and and we are
[1:19:28] under expectation for God to do some
[1:19:33] things and you know and even even when I
[1:19:35] when I when I when I use the words of
[1:19:37] the glory shall come again you have
[1:19:41] sister verse a old glory now now now now
[1:19:46] now now understand something I we use
[1:19:50] the same word globally but it had to
[1:19:54] differ
[1:19:55] meanings right
[1:19:59] a man is so so so so when we when we
[1:20:02] when we when we when we when we say
[1:20:04] things like oh glory right then we would
[1:20:08] bring an honor in an adoration and
[1:20:12] praise to the king of kings and to the
[1:20:16] lord of lords and i'mma tell you
[1:20:17] something if if God has done anything
[1:20:20] for you then you ought to come to church
[1:20:24] not just to be seen you are to come to
[1:20:28] church to bring God I don't care you got
[1:20:33] it in your pocket in your place the
[1:20:38] chair the house and glory that you can
[1:20:41] bring to God because he's been a to do
[1:20:45] to you do you not to give him food but
[1:20:55] we're going to try to work through this
[1:20:57] amen if we can the day because you know
[1:20:59] when I say the glory shall come again
[1:21:02] I'm actually talking about something
[1:21:03] else
[1:21:04] amen and and and and and in a short a
[1:21:09] man if I could just kind of condense it
[1:21:11] down I'm talking about a man God's glory
[1:21:15] on his people right I'm not just honest
[1:21:19] people but God's glory in his people do
[1:21:22] you know that the life that you choose
[1:21:25] to live everything there's a life that
[1:21:30] can actually bring glory to go right if
[1:21:36] sometimes you go through things are like
[1:21:38] where you choose not to live the way you
[1:21:39] supposed to live and that like actually
[1:21:42] dishonest
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:37] you oh god glory hallelujah
[1:22:42] some of y'all forgot about the accident
[1:22:45] that she was in you forgot that you went

[1:23:51] hands in worship as I bless your Holy
[1:23:56] Name and i'mma tell you when God has
[1:23:58] done it personally for you then you're
[1:24:02] not looking at your neighbors you're not
[1:24:06] concerned by what they think actually
[1:24:10] you might pass them a note when they're
[1:24:13] looking at your money and on the notice
[1:24:16] that you didn't do this you didn't do
[1:24:23] this so sincerely imperious you don't

[1:26:19] plane right we remember
[1:26:22] you know seeing God answer certain
[1:26:24] things when will we be as certain things

[1:26:29] joy we had when we came to church huh
[1:26:33] we remember not what the mr. Church
[1:26:35] suits

[1:26:40] to go to prayer meeting we remember a
[1:26:44] man when we used to go to Sunday School
[1:26:54] heading cost' places we remember that we
[1:26:57] couldn't wait to get back Coleman and
[1:26:59] get our coins together to hell to the
[1:27:02] next meeting that is so good on the
[1:27:04] inside that was pushing us we didn't
[1:27:06] need my body temperatures because we had
[1:27:09] it on the inside we
[1:27:12] the only things when you first receive
[1:27:18] the Holy Ghost and then the piece that
[1:27:22] you had the only things but somehow
[1:27:34] someway something got lost but I'm here
[1:27:40] to prophesy over you the glory shall
[1:27:45] come again and then what I'm saying that
[1:27:49] if you can just take a little journey
[1:27:51] down memory lane for your own self and
[1:27:54] you can remember what your glory days
[1:27:56] was like you know I mean if I could just
[1:27:58] you know go to church or something
[1:28:00] natural so you know I'm getting close
[1:28:03] I'm getting closer I'm getting closer to
[1:28:04] a big number and as I get closer to that
[1:28:09] number with all these birthdays that
[1:28:10] I've got a half a man my mind think a
[1:28:14] man about my former days I when I used
[1:28:18] to play basketball it was my glory days
[1:28:21] hey man I remember I remember the first
[1:28:25] time I dumped the basketball I I say oh
[1:28:27] I feel pretty good amen but now I can
[1:28:30] barely get to the bottom of the nets
[1:28:33] right and they're like them days the
[1:28:36] lesson but every once in a while when my
[1:28:38] mind go to reflecting back and I found a
[1:28:42] little Bowl I get it in my hand come on
[1:28:44] somebody don't don't go look at me like
[1:28:46] I'm strings right but I get a little
[1:28:49] ball overhand him and my mind
[1:28:52] going back to the glory days and I think
[1:28:55] I still got it
[1:29:08] and because they tell you that you get
[1:29:11] you actually believe waving them and
[1:29:16] before that with the ball in your hand
[1:29:18] you know you just bounce it a little bit
[1:29:20] you know water between your leg and read
[1:29:26] about yourself and then you're looking
[1:29:28] for somebody to give you a game and you
[1:29:31] get in there without you Cairo like you
[1:29:33] used to know but I'm so glad we were
[1:29:40] talking about we're gonna talk about
[1:29:43] some nature but they all miss Beatrice I
[1:29:47] don't even remember when you used to be
[1:29:49] Harley the reason somebody else been in
[1:29:52] here today is because the glow has come
[1:29:57] we travel when the babies that you never
[1:30:02] make it back but you stand in here and
[1:30:05] by the custom blow man the Gloria has
[1:30:12] come again they use the second song
[1:30:17] waves of glory flora threatened over my
[1:30:21] soul
[1:30:21] we just want waves of glory waves wave
[1:30:25] after wave after wave of glory
[1:30:27] hallelujah let me read this so if you
[1:30:31] want to get back to the glory days in
[1:30:33] God but the Bible something that the
[1:30:37] Prophet says this repent quickly
[1:30:39] don't don't don't delay if if God is
[1:30:42] speaking to you through this sermon that
[1:30:44] they repent quickly right and he says it
[1:30:49] ever they say don't hesitate
[1:30:51] hallelujah don't hesitate evidently
[1:30:53] Ephesus did hesitate it says for her
[1:30:57] lifespan was not very low the glory of
[1:31:01] God decreased ever so rapidly now now
[1:31:06] now I must stop there because you know
[1:31:08] there was a time in scripture right when
[1:31:11] we see and I'm gonna come back to the
[1:31:12] quote in a second but some of the the
[1:31:13] glory of God that creep decreased ever
[1:31:15] so rapidly but there was a time in
[1:31:17] scripture where the children of Israel
[1:31:19] got themselves in a little trouble all
[1:31:22] kind of stuff was happening in the house
[1:31:25] of God a man we had two leaders in the
[1:31:30] house these were the the preachers
[1:31:31] children hallelujah because you know
[1:31:34] sometimes preacher preacher kids or a
[1:31:37] man those that are close to the preacher
[1:31:40] sometimes take advantage of their status
[1:31:44] huh amen you know they so close and they
[1:31:49] know certain things that they can get
[1:31:50] away with so they take advantage of
[1:31:52] their status and hear an amen in the
[1:31:55] days of Eli his two boys and then we're
[1:31:58] doing things inside the house of God
[1:32:00] they were stealing money from from the
[1:32:02] offering a man and
[1:32:04] and not only that they forget that here
[1:32:06] I came came to him and said that now I
[1:32:08] understand that you land a member some
[1:32:11] of the women of the church how these
[1:32:14] piece my to preach the sons amen they
[1:32:16] they were doing things like this and and
[1:32:19] because of the sin that had had
[1:32:21] happening in inside the church that God
[1:32:23] told you I say you could have done more
[1:32:25] profit I know you talked to him about it
[1:32:26] but maybe you should have sat him down
[1:32:29] because if you're sometimes you don't
[1:32:32] sit people down then they don't
[1:32:33] understand
[1:32:34] amen the implications of what they're
[1:32:36] doing huh you know sometimes so what we
[1:32:40] don't want to embarrass the people that
[1:32:42] no no no we got a rebuke still openly so
[1:32:45] let's continue right so so when things
[1:32:49] get out of hand
[1:32:50] now you're gonna have to sit down huh
[1:32:53] the reason and I'm gonna tell you the
[1:32:55] reason that we gonna ask you to sit down
[1:32:57] because we want to protect the globe
[1:33:02] because you did not protect to do with
[1:33:06] Eli alone disposed to do whatever doing
[1:33:08] the Bombers a counter little battle and
[1:33:11] when they get in the beverage bar to go
[1:33:14] and the Bible say Amen if your bar was
[1:33:16] written there it go Bob with the blowing
[1:33:20] of a
[1:33:21] laughter pardon but there come a time I
[1:33:26] believe was in Davis day that that that
[1:33:29] glory came again and went when that the
[1:33:34] same and that art that was taken a man
[1:33:36] one day David start coming back into the
[1:33:39] cake and when David saw that lonely
[1:33:42] returning day that they came to the
[1:33:45] choice David began to worship
[1:33:49] David David Gaucho's always his won't
[1:33:52] say I can't believe the king because I
[1:33:54] hear dancing the team follows how
[1:33:57] embarrassing that is
[1:33:59] they to say if yesterday he really is
[1:34:11] returning should he left in place I say
[1:34:20] the glorious coming again let's read on
[1:34:26] it's not long until the city was in
[1:34:31] ruins
[1:34:31] its glorious temple became a shapeless
[1:34:34] mass the land became a marsh inhabited
[1:34:37] by waterfowl the population was gone
[1:34:40] except for a few unbelievers in a
[1:34:42] squalid village there was not even one
[1:34:45] Christian left this is talking about the
[1:34:48] city of Ephesus the lamp was ripped from
[1:34:51] its place now it does not mean that she
[1:34:56] could not have repented right it does
[1:35:01] not mean that we cannot repent see but
[1:35:05] when you're done when you're going to
[1:35:07] repent do it quickly
[1:35:08] don't hesitate because the devil don't
[1:35:10] get you the kind of well it wasn't all
[1:35:13] that it no no it was all that and more
[1:35:15] you need to repent right if you want the
[1:35:18] glory to come back you got to repent
[1:35:20] right it says it does not mean that we
[1:35:23] cannot repent we can but it but it must
[1:35:26] be quickly and I like this part it must
[1:35:29] be
[1:35:30] a true heart because some people say
[1:35:33] sorry just because they got called right
[1:35:36] a man but but but if you really really a
[1:35:39] man repetitive of what you've done
[1:35:41] then you've a look at the go get
[1:35:43] involved in the same thing again
[1:35:45] hallelujah what you have not received
[1:35:49] the spirit of bondage again on to fear
[1:35:52] don't go back and get involved in the
[1:35:54] same thing again and God delivered you
[1:35:56] from smoking don't go back to smoke
[1:35:58] again if God deliver you some trinket
[1:36:00] don't go back in from some relationship

[1:36:33] they really want that give it to a
[1:36:35] sister call this sister here I'm done
[1:36:39] alright and number I'm told that I'm
[1:36:45] concentrating on God amen all right we
[1:36:51] want the glory
[1:36:52] so you're seeing can actually disrupt
[1:36:54] the glory hallelujah
[1:36:57] then that's typically what happens
[1:36:58] seeing stops the glory amen let me go a
[1:37:02] little further he says but it must be
[1:37:04] quickly it must be a true heart crying
[1:37:07] to God and self a true heart cry to God
[1:37:10] in sorrow Holly Lewis sometimes people
[1:37:14] are really ain't sorry
[1:37:15] and then I'll true heart proud of God in
[1:37:17] song then God will restore the violent
[1:37:21] scene people get restored and then go
[1:37:23] right back to the same thing Nate laughs
[1:37:24] we don't want to see that number we talk
[1:37:27] about the glory we're coming again
[1:37:29] hallelujah and we don't want to just
[1:37:31] shout for one or two weeks we want to
[1:37:33] take this thing to the rapture hello
[1:37:38] somebody
[1:37:39] oh my god there's a lot I can say there
[1:37:42] hey man we talked about going to the
[1:37:45] ratchet I'm not I'm not
[1:37:47] hey man I'm not moved by emotions I
[1:37:50] understand you know I understand to be
[1:37:53] real because if it's real we gotta worry
[1:37:57] about it no more I understand we ain't
[1:38:01] gotta worry about you limo when that
[1:38:02] thing is real we gotta worry about it no
[1:38:04] more
[1:38:05] hey man Gloria got your actions changed

[1:38:10] changed when it's real hey man the
[1:38:13] things you do change when it's real
[1:38:16] hallelujah amen we want to get a church
[1:38:18] past struggling we want to get a church
[1:38:21] to the level of overcoming all right let
[1:38:26] me go a little further if they say say
[1:38:28] say but it must be quickly say it does
[1:38:33] not mean that we cannot repent we can
[1:38:34] but it must be quickly it must be a true
[1:38:37] heart cry to God and so then and then
[1:38:39] God will restore the glory shall come
[1:38:42] again I saw that and I say Lord Jesus
[1:38:46] well what a blessing you know just to
[1:38:48] just kind of read that and and I just
[1:38:50] began to think about that word glory a
[1:38:52] man because glory has various meanings
[1:38:56] glory is attributed to God for his
[1:38:59] greatness when we come and say old
[1:39:01] Gloria or give God the glory amen weird
[1:39:04] riveting greatness to God right a man we
[1:39:07] were blessing him for his mighty acts
[1:39:09] and man we're blessing him and praising
[1:39:12] him for his his sacrifice on the cross
[1:39:14] but giving us his son Jesus we we bring
[1:39:17] blue we bring honor to God nobody could
[1:39:20] do that but God amen that's why he alone
[1:39:22] deserves the glory right amen but also
[1:39:25] when you're when you use the word glory
[1:39:27] a man is declaring Amen his grandeur a
[1:39:31] man or the excellency of his work a man
[1:39:35] his grandeur or the excellency of God's
[1:39:38] working in our Psalm 19:1
[1:39:41] the Bible says the heavens declare the
[1:39:44] glory of God amen and the firmament
[1:39:48] showeth his handiwork now now you can if
[1:39:51] you just read it
[1:39:52] heavens you find so many things that not
[1:39:54] only only God could create a universe
[1:39:57] like not like the one we live in amen
[1:39:59] how does the Sun stay in place only God
[1:40:03] could do that
[1:40:04] hey Hannes amen you know when you look
[1:40:07] at all we've all watches and all this
[1:40:10] but you know I don't care how good the
[1:40:12] watch is that you burn how much money
[1:40:13] you spend on it if it's that that watch
[1:40:15] will use time and then but when it came
[1:40:18] to the the Sun and the moon we can still
[1:40:21] predict things on this earth because of
[1:40:23] the consistency of our God or he has
[1:40:27] done in the heavens oh yeah
[1:40:30] hey Ben Ben hey if you get a play in
[1:40:33] that same they think they're atheists
[1:40:36] they don't believe that have them
[1:40:37] explain to you how what is this son and
[1:40:40] what is just knew how these things do
[1:40:42] this
[1:40:43] sue the heavens declare the glory of God
[1:40:49] hallelujah and and the firmament showeth
[1:40:52] his handiwork I like this you know but
[1:40:56] but you know we look at something here
[1:40:58] that I just want to just kind of bring
[1:41:00] in if I can the heavens declare score
[1:41:02] but we got we got some other definitions
[1:41:04] that we want to bring in there's a
[1:41:07] statement that people make and and I
[1:41:11] want to be honest with you the prophet
[1:41:13] has made it and I'm let me read it let
[1:41:15] me read it
[1:41:16] let me read I got a watch how I say this
[1:41:17] though because it's gonna it me
[1:41:20] I don't want it to backfire hey man this
[1:41:24] is either greater than Solomon is here
[1:41:25] let me let me go there
[1:41:27] the statement that is me is that God
[1:41:29] won't share his glory with no man we all
[1:41:34] know that's not in the Bible
[1:41:43] and let me give you another one the race
[1:41:46] is not given to the Swift neither is the
[1:41:50] battle to the strong but to him that
[1:41:55] endureth to the end and we've heard that
[1:41:58] in church all our life but that's
[1:42:01] multiple scriptures put together but the
[1:42:05] Bible didn't say that all right can I
[1:42:08] give you another one
[1:42:10] you shape it in sin borne and iniquity
[1:42:15] coming to the world speaking lies that's
[1:42:20] multiple scriptures we're together but
[1:42:23] the Bible doesn't say it the way I just
[1:42:25] said it and sometimes we've taken things
[1:42:29] because we've heard people say it but we
[1:42:32] didn't really get the context of what
[1:42:34] was being said so so when we when we
[1:42:36] hear people saying God and gonna share
[1:42:39] his glory with no man we miss in the
[1:42:42] context of really what's being saying
[1:42:44] can I tell you where that Scripture was
[1:42:47] birthed from isaiah 42:8 that's where
[1:42:51] it's birthed from that when you go back
[1:42:53] to you read Isaiah 42 you'll see it and
[1:42:56] you can pull that up Isaiah 42 today
[1:42:57] when you go back and read that the
[1:42:59] context of I was at 42 it was talking
[1:43:01] about
[1:43:02] Idol gods right and what we understand
[1:43:05] is that even way back in the book of
[1:43:07] Exodus God saying you have no other gods
[1:43:09] before him and sometimes man by himself
[1:43:14] trying to make himself a god now when I
[1:43:20] talk about being co-equal God you can
[1:43:22] only reach that status through the blue
[1:43:25] cheese
[1:43:28] look at this
[1:43:30] I see wouldn't you know when I talk
[1:43:32] about the glory coming again I got to
[1:43:33] give you all this context this is what
[1:43:37] the Bible say I'm the Lord that is my
[1:43:39] name and my glory will I not will I not
[1:43:42] give to another neither my praise to
[1:43:48] graven images so the context is talking
[1:43:53] about the grievant images but it's not
[1:43:55] talking about who you are Oh hallelujah
[1:44:00] is can we read some more out of Isaiah
[1:44:05] amen
[1:44:06] since I'm over there and I'm gonna just
[1:44:10] kind of show you something
[1:44:11] amen because go to Isaiah I think it's
[1:44:13] gonna be our chapter 60 oh yes a man
[1:44:21] hallelujah no he ain't gon share his
[1:44:24] glory with no one and and and and when I
[1:44:27] what he's talking about is idol worship
[1:44:29] and the other things like I said
[1:44:30] sometimes man can lift themselves up and
[1:44:32] they become idols guarding or share his
[1:44:34] glory with that I've know of a situation
[1:44:37] where you know a preacher took the the
[1:44:40] cloud the cloud you know that that came
[1:44:44] down in 1963 and brought and science had
[1:44:47] no idea what the cloud represented so
[1:44:49] brother Branham saying look that cloud
[1:44:51] just turn it to the right and when they
[1:44:53] turn the cloud to the right you know
[1:44:54] they saw the face of Christ so people
[1:44:57] actually start superimposing the cloud
[1:44:58] and putting the face of Christ oh people
[1:45:00] can actually see it it's right when
[1:45:02] brother took the face of Christ out and
[1:45:03] now he didn't do it may allow somebody
[1:45:05] to do it
[1:45:06] he allowed somebody to put his face in
[1:45:08] there and the sons face no god I don't
[1:45:12] share his glory with no man not like
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:14] this is everything we got is because of
[1:45:17] Christ hallelujah church it's all about
[1:45:20] Christ and and and when we talk about
[1:45:22] being co-equal we talk about being
[1:45:23] adopted son we talk about all these
[1:45:24] things all of that happens because of
[1:45:26] the blood no blood none of that's gonna
[1:45:30] happen to you none right
[1:45:32] so don't get don't get that twisted now
[1:45:35] let's look at this and I was there six
[1:45:36] days since we since be there verse one
[1:45:40] a Russ son for that light is come and
[1:45:46] what the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:45:52] who a man risen upon thee for behold the
[1:45:57] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[1:45:59] darkness the people but the Lord shall
[1:46:01] arise upon thee hallelujah and and and
[1:46:07] and his glory shall be seen upon thee oh
[1:46:13] my God my God my God if this is a
[1:46:16] promise from God then we ought to be
[1:46:18] expecting this oh yeah it is blown we
[1:46:22] gonna be seen upon me then I want to
[1:46:25] walk in it I want to live it manna I
[1:46:27] want to worship Him that glory
[1:46:29] I want his grandeur his excellence to be
[1:46:34] seen upon me Oh stay with me here stay
[1:46:39] with me here right so so you know we
[1:46:41] look at we look at a couple things here
[1:46:43] oh my god so you know let me let me I'm
[1:46:47] ready to kind of run into something but
[1:46:49] I gotta slow down and I gotta slow down
[1:46:51] y'all just bear with me here we look at
[1:46:54] this word glory it has multiple multiple
[1:46:57] definitions multiple definitions so so
[1:47:00] when we talk about a man we just read in
[1:47:04] Scripture God's glory is gonna rest on
[1:47:06] his people it's gonna wrestle his people
[1:47:08] now now you don't have to believe it but
[1:47:09] I just read it and when it when he said
[1:47:12] his glory gonna rest upon thee I just
[1:47:14] put my name there his glory gonna rest
[1:47:17] upon jack Duff hallelujah because that's
[1:47:20] really where Isaiah is writing to me
[1:47:21] right and you got to see yourself in the
[1:47:24] scripture right here is glory hallelujah
[1:47:27] I mean when you remember your glory days
[1:47:29] and man his glory is going to rest again
[1:47:33] on you hallelujah
[1:47:37] normal talking about fact let me just
[1:47:39] read another scripture for you glory to
[1:47:41] God say ma'am eight men I got I got a
[1:47:44] lot of them here proper of 17-6 proverbs
[1:47:48] 17 6
[1:47:50] thank you Jesus all right bear with me
[1:47:53] today the glory shall come again Solomon
[1:48:02] has these words of wisdom that he gives
[1:48:06] us in this this particular portion of
[1:48:10] Scripture and it says children's
[1:48:13] children are the crown of old men and
[1:48:19] the glory of children are their fathers
[1:48:26] so that means the children can have some
[1:48:28] glory but notice Solomon say he say the
[1:48:34] glory of the children so so so whatever
[1:48:37] they may whatever you achieve as as a
[1:48:40] child whatever status you make it to the
[1:48:45] glory goes back to your daddy
[1:48:51] the glory always goes back to the data
[1:48:54] and another Lynette amen if a child does
[1:48:58] not make anything of himself you know
[1:49:01] where's the supper the reproach your
[1:49:04] father has a simple reproach because
[1:49:07] it's his responsibility to create an
[1:49:11] atmosphere to create an environment so
[1:49:15] that when the child grows up they can
[1:49:18] shine with glory can we go a little
[1:49:22] further can we just go a little further
[1:49:25] if children's children not a crown of
[1:49:27] old men and the glory of the children
[1:49:30] are their father's then whatever you do
[1:49:36] brings glory to your father
[1:49:42] I was just taking on this on this on
[1:49:47] this passage Scripture because I thought
[1:49:49] about the prodigal son
[1:49:51] and as the prodigal son left his
[1:49:53] father's house and went out and did all
[1:49:55] the stuff that he thought he was big and
[1:49:56] bad enough to do now you know when the
[1:50:00] prodigal son was out there his daddy
[1:50:01] there sent him no text messages hello
[1:50:04] somebody can I just talk to out a little
[1:50:06] bit why he out there doing what he want
[1:50:08] to do say i'ma tell you why his dad in
[1:50:10] Central Texas daddy knew where he had
[1:50:12] deposited Oh y'all are y'all in Whitley
[1:50:14] is that it knew what was in the boy and
[1:50:18] if sometimes what happens is that life
[1:50:21] has to present circumstances life has to
[1:50:26] present situations for what's inside the
[1:50:30] boy to come out the boy right and after
[1:50:34] that boy thought himself in a dire
[1:50:36] situation where he like I mean
[1:50:38] officially walk out where he was ballin
[1:50:41] had a fat wallet right things were thick
[1:50:47] it was soft thick he was bragging about
[1:50:50] a little bit too much that his boys got
[1:50:53] a homeless or his money and some of the
[1:50:55] girls got a hold of some of his money
[1:50:57] but but when he realized that they were
[1:50:59] only taking advantage of them and when
[1:51:02] they left him bunk and did have nothing
[1:51:04] to give him when he was barreling out
[1:51:06] huh
[1:51:07] very fellowship working in a place that
[1:51:10] he as a as a Jew should have never been
[1:51:13] working his
[1:51:18] but it got so bad at one they weren't
[1:51:21] there that he was working there what
[1:51:23] that really bad is that he wanted to eat
[1:51:28] he desired to eat what the peach was
[1:51:31] eaten
[1:51:32] you know things got there but the Bible
[1:51:35] says that he came to himself and see
[1:51:39] what he came to himself the glory what's

[1:54:51] that's your batch everybody ain't gonna
[1:54:56] be happy that the glory came again huh
[1:55:03] so don't don't get upset oh let me just
[1:55:07] leave it so you engage you ain't gave no
[1:55:19] party like that to me and my friends so
[1:55:22] y'all don't need a party like that
[1:55:25] see the jealousy kicked in when the
[1:55:28] glory returned
[1:55:29] oh I hope y'all with me the jealousy
[1:55:34] kicked in when the glory returned and
[1:55:37] I'm gonna tell you something as the
[1:55:38] glory come again you got to watch what
[1:55:42] spirit tries to doesn't want you because
[1:55:45] I'm telling you right now the glory will
[1:55:48] come again and I'm gonna tell you i'ma
[1:55:49] tell you another thing I'm not looking
[1:55:51] for replacement
[1:55:54] I believe God for restoration and I
[1:55:59] don't see the Spirit of Truth have some
[1:56:02] glory case the glory coming again
[1:56:10] hallelujah can I go on a little further
[1:56:14] oh yes yes
[1:56:18] here in John 1:14 we hear the scripture
[1:56:22] says the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:56:25] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:56:28] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:56:32] Father full of grace and truth so when
[1:56:35] we look at Jesus we actually see God's
[1:56:38] glory hallelujah and so if Jesus as a
[1:56:43] son of God was God's glory then you also
[1:56:48] as a son of God and a daughter of God
[1:56:50] you are God's glory children's children
[1:56:54] our crown of old men but the glory the
[1:56:56] children are their father's whatever you
[1:56:57] accomplished becomes God's glory
[1:57:00] understand now if you don't if you don't
[1:57:03] believe that John 17 and 22 see the
[1:57:07] Prophet told me that if I tell y'all in
[1:57:09] Scripture then you got to believe it so
[1:57:13] John 17 and and 22 says this oh my God
[1:57:20] my God my God and the glory which thou
[1:57:23] gave his me I have given them that they
[1:57:30] may be one even as we are one so Jesus
[1:57:33] was God's glory but when Jesus came to
[1:57:36] earth before he left he actually gave
[1:57:37] the glory to us we are also a part of
[1:57:41] God's glory hallelujah we're part of his
[1:57:45] grandeur and even you can go all the way
[1:57:47] back to the beginning because you know
[1:57:49] God did not rest until after he created
[1:57:55] a man in His image that's when God said
[1:57:59] okay I'm reached it this is this is
[1:58:01] perfection right here
[1:58:03] I finally got exactly what I wanted and
[1:58:05] that was God's glory on display come on
[1:58:11] somebody let me go a little further amen
[1:58:14] let me let me also just kind of pull you
[1:58:16] out of some things here you know I was I
[1:58:18] read that script out on some I'm sorry
[1:58:20] Isaiah 60:1 earlier and you know there
[1:58:24] it was saying arise shine for that glory
[1:58:26] that's coming I thought about the song
[1:58:28] that we sing sometime let the glory of
[1:58:30] the Lord rise among us let the praises
[1:58:34] of our King arise among us let it rise
[1:58:37] right let let let let that glory rise on
[1:58:41] us let it be seen inside of us now let
[1:58:45] me let me let me also just kind of drop
[1:58:47] this if I can sisters
[1:59:00] the Bible declares in first corinthians
[1:59:07] chapter 11 and verse 15 if a woman have
[1:59:20] long hair it is a glory to her and see
[1:59:29] this distance it sprays its dignity
[1:59:31] that's what that word means praise
[1:59:33] dignity honor well if a woman has have
[1:59:38] have little air it was a glory to her
[1:59:40] for her hair is given her for a
[1:59:44] cover me
[1:59:44] now now I want you to you know I want
[1:59:46] you to just kind of bear with me Amen as
[1:59:49] we just kind of talked about that just a
[1:59:51] little bit you know because this word
[1:59:52] glory has so many different meanings
[1:59:55] amen
[1:59:56] I was recently visiting there at our
[1:59:59] brother brother Donnie Regan and he was
[2:00:01] talking on that Scripture and he made a
[2:00:02] statement he preached the sermon he just
[2:00:05] went oh he went back preach the sermon
[2:00:07] and they say I'm not going to use quotes
[2:00:09] tonight i'ma just use historical Amen
[2:00:12] statements from from biblical writers
[2:00:15] and things like that what they have to
[2:00:17] say about that scripture and I everybody
[2:00:20] was saying that you know Amen when it
[2:00:22] went a woman don't cut her hair amen and
[2:00:26] that's what the Bible said because it's
[2:00:27] wrong for a woman to cut her hair
[2:00:29] hallelujah clipping is cutting right
[2:00:33] it's wrong for her to cut her ear
[2:00:35] because her hair is her glory and he
[2:00:37] started going back showing how all these
[2:00:39] different Bible expositors everybody was
[2:00:41] saying exact thing they say now the
[2:00:43] prophets say these things that people
[2:00:44] get upset but the babak's positive say
[2:00:47] an exact same thing it's wrong it's
[2:00:51] wrong I want to talk to y'all about
[2:00:53] three women real quick if I can three
[2:00:58] these three women one woman was married
[2:01:02] to a lawyer brother Branham brings us
[2:01:04] out in the message and knoweth it not
[2:01:05] this one woman was married to a lawyer
[2:01:08] but the thing about her she never went
[2:01:10] to church she had a she
[2:01:13] she somehow allowed an old boyfriend to
[2:01:16] visit while her husband was away on
[2:01:18] business she went to some party and and
[2:01:21] all she did was give that old boyfriend
[2:01:23] a hug
[2:01:24] let me y'all go y'all I'm y'all pulled
[2:01:27] me out of my element here
[2:01:28] all she did was just give the old
[2:01:32] boyfriend a hug and when she when she
[2:01:36] hugged him it a little fire on the
[2:01:41] inside of her that she thought had died
[2:01:45] this is my church brothers can hug
[2:01:49] brothers because it's not supposed to
[2:01:51] have them types of things hello
[2:01:56] you ain't supposed to feel that when you
[2:02:00] look at another man and when I will
[2:02:05] assist this hugging another sister she
[2:02:08] supposed to feel that either if you feel
[2:02:11] that I think I love him a man sent it to
[2:02:22] another man something wrong all I did
[2:02:31] was shake his hand and hug them and you
[2:02:33] felt what you know that's a devil you
[2:02:36] know it's a devil don't even entertain
[2:02:39] it that's why that's why is here we we
[2:02:44] brothers shake the brothers or you can
[2:02:46] hug the brother we don't kiss on the
[2:02:47] neck and we don't kiss in the mouth we
[2:02:50] don't do none of that I know the Bible
[2:02:51] say Greek with a holy kiss but that kiss
[2:02:54] that they did in the Bible is actually
[2:02:55] on the neck and understand now
[2:03:06] understand now these people walked on
[2:03:09] dusty roads amen and walked in the Sun
[2:03:12] they didn't they didn't have Afghanistan
[2:03:14] cops so whenever they got to their
[2:03:16] destination and you kissed them a man
[2:03:19] with a holy kiss you had to put them
[2:03:21] lips on the neck with all the sweat and
[2:03:25] dirt hallelujah we people got to know
[2:03:31] what the Bible really mean if we had
[2:03:32] somebody walked through the church one
[2:03:34] time we just greeting officers they just
[2:03:36] pecking pecking pecking like brother no
[2:03:38] no no no no no we don't do that bang
[2:03:40] what the Bible saying but yeah let me
[2:03:46] get my thought back now
[2:03:49] hallelujah these d-street these three
[2:03:51] three three or so so so what she did she
[2:03:54] just hugged him and when she hugged him
[2:03:57] it actually released something on the
[2:03:59] inside of her and even though she was
[2:04:02] married even though she married she just
[2:04:07] began to desire a man that of a man
[2:04:10] again and it all got triggered from a
[2:04:12] hug right so so what what happened here
[2:04:16] is that uh you know a husband will go
[2:04:18] off the business numbers again don't
[2:04:20] forget it now this woman is all is uh is
[2:04:22] a woman that don't go to church right
[2:04:24] like we heard last night I mean on
[2:04:26] Friday night sinners just sin that's
[2:04:31] what they do but but what but what
[2:04:34] really get things going is when a
[2:04:37] Christian does something that they're
[2:04:39] not supposed to do so but I don't say is
[2:04:42] Christians that fan not sinners
[2:04:46] hallelujah because seven says do what
[2:04:49] they do Christians are the one that got
[2:04:52] to repent alright so so so this woman a
[2:04:56] man she's married to a lawyer never go
[2:04:58] to church she allowed this little
[2:05:00] boyfriend back in now he's visiting her
[2:05:02] house and you know and she spent a lot
[2:05:05] of time in the arms of this man and and
[2:05:07] and and her her neighbor is a matched
[2:05:10] her neighbor goes to church the neighbor
[2:05:12] goes to a Methodist Church right
[2:05:14] if you go back and listen to the message
[2:05:15] brother Bram say the Methodists were
[2:05:17] more holy than the Baptist so that's why
[2:05:18] he used Methodist say the Methodist
[2:05:20] Church
[2:05:21] you know this neighbor that goes to
[2:05:23] church goes to the Methodist Church
[2:05:24] she's watching all the activities of
[2:05:26] this lady that don't go to church and
[2:05:27] she tell my husband that woman is a
[2:05:30] public prostitute her husband say yeah
[2:05:34] that's true umbrella Bram say actually
[2:05:36] the lady was worse than a prostitute
[2:05:38] because she's doing things like that and
[2:05:40] she's a merit woman she's worse than a
[2:05:42] prostitute so he goes on that's the
[2:05:45] first one we say the second woman is dis
[2:05:47] Methodist woman now now she she ain't
[2:05:49] got no man coming to the house when her
[2:05:51] husband's away but this lady is a lady
[2:05:53] that likes to wear shorts she likes to
[2:05:56] cut her hair the Prophet also describes
[2:06:00] her she says she wears lipstick and she
[2:06:02] even smokes a little now she don't run
[2:06:08] out on her husband though cuz he's what
[2:06:10] we try to do is justify seeing I'm doing
[2:06:18] this but if you're guilty of least you
[2:06:24] guilty of all oh yeah so so so he
[2:06:28] describes this woman she go to church
[2:06:29] she don't drink but she does wear shorts
[2:06:32] and she cuts her hair and she wears
[2:06:34] lipstick and she even smokes a little
[2:06:36] privacy in God's eyes both of these
[2:06:39] women are prostitutes the problem is the
[2:06:48] Methodist woman
[2:06:52] is ms rule ratchet naked and don't know
[2:07:01] it and then he says this let me read
[2:07:06] this part of it for you this is out of
[2:07:08] the message of north if not this is the
[2:07:10] third woman I remember I'm talking about
[2:07:15] how her hair is her glory that's where
[2:07:18] I'm is what I'm driving here notice this
[2:07:20] in the message in north of knowledge
[2:07:22] says now we'll take the Pentecostal
[2:07:24] woman she don't wear shorts makeup or
[2:07:29] cut her hair but she looks back down at
[2:07:33] the Methodist Methodist woman look at
[2:07:37] that woman do so-and-so say the woman
[2:07:38] don't wear shorts but you say and and
[2:07:40] herself with bobbed hair now y'all
[2:07:44] sisters might have to help me with that
[2:07:46] one cuz they say she didn't cut her hair
[2:07:48] but did he say she had bobbed hair and
[2:07:55] and I just wonder if he was trying to
[2:07:57] get something to us you know cuz
[2:08:01] trimming is still cutting brother
[2:08:03] brother Donnie made this statement he
[2:08:04] says some of the sisters sometimes they
[2:08:08] wear their hair so long you know you
[2:08:13] know everybody just based on your your F
[2:08:17] ethnic origin
[2:08:18] God gives us different types of hair and
[2:08:22] some of the sisters you know some of my
[2:08:23] sisters might have very very long hair
[2:08:25] because of ethnic origin and then you
[2:08:28] get sisters that don't have that long
[2:08:30] hair desire to have that long hair y'all
[2:08:33] gonna get me in some trouble here yeah
[2:08:35] I'm gonna give me a lot of trouble right
[2:08:36] here but uh they say the sister that's
[2:08:40] born with that God has blessed her
[2:08:42] because of her ethnicity she has that
[2:08:44] long hair like that he says uh he says
[2:08:47] now she could have hair all the way down
[2:08:49] her back but if at the bottom he say she
[2:08:55] does not have long hair according to
[2:08:58] Scripture
[2:09:01] and they say he went to Africa and talk
[2:09:05] to some sister to say they were so
[2:09:07] disappointed that they hair was not that
[2:09:08] long he say sister I know your hair is
[2:09:13] not that long the way that you want want
[2:09:15] it to be you know with the other sisters
[2:09:16] say blood sister if you've never taken
[2:09:19] scissors to your hair you might call it
[2:09:22] short but God calls it long hair because
[2:09:31] you'd never put scissors to it God calls
[2:09:35] it long hair see so what happens that we
[2:09:37] get so motivated by what we see in other
[2:09:40] people we got to take this thing back to
[2:09:42] how God sees it so I don't care how
[2:09:44] short it is you never put scissors to it
[2:09:46] God said you got long hair but if you
[2:09:49] cut it trimming it and let me tell you
[2:09:53] it go a little further
[2:09:53] when you do that that is a dishonor to
[2:09:57] your husband and the Prophet actually
[2:09:58] said that your husband had the right to
[2:10:00] divorce you somebody said give me
[2:10:04] scripture on that the Prophet said nice
[2:10:09] day the weather Bible see I'm here to
[2:10:14] answer your question because you got to
[2:10:17] understand what the Bible's saying here
[2:10:19] if the woman have long hair it is a
[2:10:22] glory to her for her hair is given her
[2:10:25] for a covering hallelujah let's go back
[2:10:30] to just a verse before that verse 7 in
[2:10:33] 1st Corinthians 11 and I added the gown
[2:10:36] I'm gonna give you something out of the
[2:10:37] Bible amen let's go to 1st Corinthians
[2:10:39] 11 7 we're talking about this glory see
[2:10:42] some how many did glory to come again
[2:10:45] hello
[2:10:46] you need your glory to come again
[2:10:48] alright here in verse 7 says for for a
[2:10:51] man indeed ought not to cover his head
[2:10:54] for as much as for as much he is the
[2:10:57] image a man is the image and glory of
[2:11:01] God but the woman is the glory of the
[2:11:06] man the woman is the glory of man so so
[2:11:10] so now what happens here according to
[2:11:12] Paul when a woman cuts the hair
[2:11:14] she does honors her husband right so now
[2:11:18] what we got here is that when a woman
[2:11:20] dis honors her husband her husband has
[2:11:22] the right to actually put away now
[2:11:24] brother branham said it this way he can
[2:11:26] put away but he can't get married again
[2:11:28] so don't even come talk about my wife
[2:11:30] could have had I'm ready to divorce
[2:11:33] that's fine but I bet not and I'm saying
[2:11:39] like that I'm putting to your turns I
[2:11:40] bad night see you walking up in here
[2:11:44] with somebody else you will not be
[2:11:47] welcome they may you gotta understand
[2:11:54] the scripture brother Jack where's that
[2:11:56] the Bible
[2:11:57] see see see see see the woman is the
[2:12:00] man's glory can I give you a scripture
[2:12:05] vashti vashti was a hat services glory
[2:12:13] and what hosters did he had a big party
[2:12:16] and they say man I want everybody see
[2:12:19] the beauty of my wife he said what I
[2:12:22] wanna do is I want to invite her into
[2:12:24] the party let everybody get all seated
[2:12:26] and just enjoy myself then I'm gonna
[2:12:29] invite her to the party and was she
[2:12:30] coming like oh look at what that man
[2:12:32] just meant problem is is that when he
[2:12:36] invited her she wouldn't come well
[2:12:43] according to Scripture she dishonored
[2:12:46] him and you know what happened to Vashti
[2:12:49] she got divorced and a new king a new
[2:12:54] queen rose up her name was Esther Esther
[2:12:59] became a hasser is his glory I wrote a
[2:13:02] few things about Esther
[2:13:06] see when we talk about indeed a man for
[2:13:11] indeed I'm not the ought not to cover
[2:13:13] his head for as much as he is the image
[2:13:15] and glory of God but the woman is the
[2:13:16] glory of the man see we must consider
[2:13:18] that we're talking about the church as
[2:13:20] well because the Prophet taught us that
[2:13:21] a woman in Scripture represents the
[2:13:23] church right Vashti was the glory of
[2:13:26] king of Azeris she was his pride and his
[2:13:28] joy she couldn't wait I mean he couldn't
[2:13:31] wait to show the people the beauty of
[2:13:33] his wife
[2:13:33] maybe she walked gracefully maybe she
[2:13:36] dressed in splendor maybe a man she was
[2:13:40] just a magnificent woman to look upon
[2:13:42] but she refused to come at the Kings
[2:13:45] invitation she lacked character let me
[2:13:48] just show you something this open the
[2:13:49] door for Esther and when it opened the
[2:13:52] door for Esther the Bible say that
[2:13:56] Esther didn't require anything more than
[2:13:59] what was appointed before she went to
[2:14:02] the king can I go a little further what
[2:14:05] I want to say is that Esther damned
[2:14:06] require makeup Esther them require
[2:14:09] earrings
[2:14:10] Esther them require high heels Esther
[2:14:14] didn't have to show her cleavage
[2:14:17] Esther them have to walk in there with a
[2:14:19] miniskirt on short her thighs Esther
[2:14:24] didn't have to walk with a split in her
[2:14:26] skirt Esther then even walk with a skirt
[2:14:30] that showed her knees hello
[2:14:34] yes it is so nothing if he gonna want me
[2:14:38] he gonna want me for me this I asked her
[2:14:42] posted Esther looks so different from
[2:14:45] all the other ladies that that's what
[2:14:48] actually drew the Kings attention and
[2:14:51] when it drew the Kings attention because
[2:14:54] she refused all these other things the
[2:14:57] Bible said she obtained favor from the
[2:15:00] king and then she became the new Queen
[2:15:03] then when she reached the status of
[2:15:05] Queen this gave her the opportunity to
[2:15:08] influence her
[2:15:10] people was dressing she was a king's
[2:15:16] glory because the wife is the is the
[2:15:21] husband's glory and if we can look at
[2:15:23] ester being a man a half of his glory
[2:15:27] then we got to look at ourselves as
[2:15:28] being the glory of God can I go in a
[2:15:33] little further I got some scriptures
[2:15:35] here that I want to read to you oh my
[2:15:38] God my God my God my God
[2:15:40] maybe I'll just give me there's a
[2:15:42] statement that brother Branham makes
[2:15:43] that I don't have time to read all this
[2:15:45] but you'll find it and the mighty God
[2:15:46] unveiled before she said since calorie
[2:15:48] because of Calvary since Calvary we are
[2:15:51] invited to share his glory oh I thought
[2:15:56] I thought God don't share his glory with
[2:15:59] no man
[2:16:00] since Calvary simps Calvary we are
[2:16:05] invited to share his glory and as his
[2:16:09] wife we are his glory I want to just
[2:16:14] read a few scriptures for you if I can
[2:16:16] oh my God my God my God
[2:16:21] this is uh this this is why I oh Lord I
[2:16:24] haven't left out some things I got to
[2:16:26] share this moment before I go
[2:16:28] the first time give it Genesis 31 and 1
[2:16:32] because this the first time the word
[2:16:34] glory was actually used in Scripture
[2:16:36] Genesis 31 and 1 and I'll bring it home
[2:16:39] in a second just bear with me I tell you
[2:16:42] I didn't know where to get on and where
[2:16:43] to get off but I'm just riding Jim is is
[2:16:48] 31 and one look at this and he heard the
[2:16:54] words of Leoben Leoben son Sam Jacob
[2:16:58] hath taken away all that was our fathers
[2:17:00] and of that which was our fathers hath
[2:17:03] he gotten all this glory so what with
[2:17:08] this is the first time that we see the
[2:17:10] word glory actually used in Scripture
[2:17:11] and and what has happened here in and
[2:17:14] Jacob situation is that Jacob had a job
[2:17:21] where he went down there to Laban and he
[2:17:24] got
[2:17:24] tricked and all kind of stuff was
[2:17:25] happening but in the midst of all the
[2:17:27] things that was going on
[2:17:28] Jacob still somehow got blessed because
[2:17:32] the hand of the Lord was with him right
[2:17:33] and when Jacob got blessed Jacob had
[2:17:36] accumulated so much amen he accumulated
[2:17:40] so many atoms he accumulated so much
[2:17:42] wealth that that Lathan sons testified
[2:17:46] that man Jacob got glory and what I want
[2:17:51] you to understand is that if you obtain
[2:17:54] some things in life amen and people can
[2:17:58] say their old man you got some for the
[2:17:59] only reason you got that cords because
[2:18:01] of what God did to keep your glory and
[2:18:06] then the other thing I will say that if
[2:18:08] you got some glory then you also ought
[2:18:12] to give some glory when you realize you
[2:18:19] been blessed in spirit of baby he got me
[2:18:23] they changed Jacobs way just ten times
[2:18:27] they did a lot of stuff to try to I
[2:18:29] ain't me to try to keep him down but
[2:18:31] Jacob still obtain glory when you got
[2:18:37] some glory give God the glory look at
[2:18:43] this Jacob glory was his wealth in his
[2:18:45] blessings and he obtained this glory
[2:18:49] through the things he suffered now I'm
[2:18:53] all the way back to my scripture because
[2:18:56] we're not going to get anything you know
[2:18:58] we when we talk about adoption we talk
[2:19:00] about places we talk about things like
[2:19:01] that it's not gonna come a man easy
[2:19:04] you're gonna have to go through some
[2:19:06] suffering in order to be able to get the
[2:19:09] glory and let me tell you he do want to
[2:19:11] share his glory with you can I read a
[2:19:15] couple statements and now I'll close out
[2:19:17] with a quote here but this is let me
[2:19:19] read just a few of the scriptures for
[2:19:22] you here a man I just I was just blessed
[2:19:26] let's go to second Corinthians chapter
[2:19:28] three second Corinthians chapter three
[2:19:32] verse seventeen God wants to share his
[2:19:34] glory with you
[2:19:37] you know when that when that son is
[2:19:39] adopted when he's given a man he's taken
[2:19:44] out there to the platform before the
[2:19:45] public and they they begin to you know
[2:19:47] recognize that his name on the check is
[2:19:49] as good as his father's guess what that
[2:19:50] boy is bringing glory to his daddy now
[2:19:52] amen that's that's what's happening
[2:19:54] he's been displayed he's on display he's
[2:19:56] bringing glory to the father because of
[2:19:58] the son is supposed to bring glory to
[2:20:00] the father listen this this is a second
[2:20:03] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 now the
[2:20:04] Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit
[2:20:09] of the Lord is there is Liberty but we
[2:20:12] all with open face beholding as in a
[2:20:14] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[2:20:18] in the same image see as we behold God's
[2:20:21] glory we've changed into the image of
[2:20:22] his glory listen we've changed in the
[2:20:24] same image from glory to glory even as
[2:20:27] the Spirit of the Lord that's what's
[2:20:30] happened as we come to church we're
[2:20:31] being changed from glory to glory go to
[2:20:34] 1st Peter chapter 4 1st Peter chapter 4
[2:20:38] and I'm a started at 1st 12 hey man look
[2:20:42] at this hallelujah 1st Peter chapter 4
[2:20:46] starting at verse 12 like look at this
[2:20:49] now you go all the way you go and get
[2:20:50] this glory but you got to go through
[2:20:52] some suffering but look at it beloved
[2:20:54] think it not strange concerning the
[2:20:57] fiery trial which is to try you as
[2:20:59] though some strange thing happened unto
[2:21:03] you but rejoice in as much as ye are
[2:21:07] partakers of Christ's sufferings that
[2:21:09] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[2:21:14] be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be
[2:21:18] reproached for the name of Christ happy
[2:21:21] are ye for the spirit of glory and of
[2:21:24] God rested upon you on their part he is
[2:21:28] evil spoken of but on your part he is
[2:21:32] glorified stay right there go to 2nd
[2:21:36] Peter chapter 1
[2:21:42] second Peter chapter one look at this
[2:21:44] verse three and God wants to share his
[2:21:49] glory according as his divine power have
[2:21:53] given unto us all things that pertain
[2:21:56] earth unto life and godliness through
[2:21:59] the knowledge of him that have called us
[2:22:01] to glory and virtue see we've been
[2:22:05] called to this amen whereby are given
[2:22:07] unto us exceeding great and precious
[2:22:10] promises that by these you might be the
[2:22:13] partakers of the divine nature having
[2:22:16] escaped the corruption that is in the
[2:22:18] world through lust and when you started
[2:22:20] looking at all of that you know he
[2:22:21] starts to tell us he said beside this
[2:22:23] giving all diligence to add to your
[2:22:25] faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to
[2:22:27] knowledge temperance to temperance
[2:22:28] patience to patience godliness see this
[2:22:31] is the character Christ that has to be
[2:22:32] developed in every believer and to
[2:22:34] godliness brotherly kindness into other
[2:22:36] counties charity but if these things be
[2:22:37] in you and abound they make you that you
[2:22:39] neither let's just neither be barren nor
[2:22:41] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[2:22:43] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[2:22:45] things is blind and cannot see afar and
[2:22:48] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[2:22:50] his old sense let me tell you something
[2:22:52] if you like these things you're gonna
[2:22:53] lack the glory can I say Amen one other
[2:22:58] thing here
[2:22:59] Haggai talked about it oh my there's a
[2:23:05] scripture that I was gonna I was going
[2:23:06] to read but Jesus actually said Solomon
[2:23:10] and all of his glory
[2:23:11] it's not a rage like the lilies of the
[2:23:14] field and you understand lilies in order
[2:23:17] for them to get glory in order for a
[2:23:24] literally to get glory lily has the
[2:23:27] press this way through some stuff but
[2:23:31] notice Jesus word said Solomon and then
[2:23:33] all of his glory well what is that solid
[2:23:35] and all of his greatness Solomon built
[2:23:37] the first temple but you know that
[2:23:39] temple was destroyed and that's why I
[2:23:41] hey guy comes along a little bit later
[2:23:42] and he says the glory of the latter
[2:23:45] house is gonna be greater than the
[2:23:50] former and can I tell you something when
[2:23:52] you took your trip down
[2:23:54] memory lane what where you used to be I
[2:23:57] want to tell you the Gloria where you're
[2:23:58] going to right now gonna be much greater
[2:24:02] then where you used to be the glory is
[2:24:08] coming again it's going to happen we
[2:24:11] repent quickly the glory is coming again
[2:24:14] but it's gonna be greater than it's ever
[2:24:16] been before
[2:24:19] hey I'm on expectation for us but it's
[2:24:24] after you go through some suffering
[2:24:26] after you go through some suffering this
[2:24:30] morning in church James this is our last
[2:24:31] quote I want to read this he goes right
[2:24:34] back to Romans 8 in which we read the
[2:24:40] Prophet makes this statement why does he
[2:24:45] stand by
[2:24:49] so the reason is in Romans 8:17 three
[2:24:53] times that 117 - 1 1 1 1 1 7 - 1
[2:24:58] smyrnaean church age he says why does he
[2:25:01] stand by the reason is romans 17 8 I
[2:25:07] mean Romans 8:17 through 18 it says that
[2:25:11] if children then heirs heirs of God and
[2:25:16] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[2:25:17] suffer with him that we may be also
[2:25:20] glorified together for I reckon that the
[2:25:23] sufferings of this present time are not
[2:25:25] worthy to be compared with the glory
[2:25:28] which shall be revealed in us God I
[2:25:32] share his glory with his people look at
[2:25:35] this unless we suffer with him we cannot
[2:25:38] reign with him you have to suffer to
[2:25:41] reign the reason for this is that
[2:25:44] character simply has never mate without
[2:25:46] suffering I told y'all at the beginning
[2:25:48] you go back to the Bible you see
[2:25:49] everybody did you read about went
[2:25:51] through something if you're gonna hang
[2:25:55] in the Hall of Fame you got to go
[2:25:57] through the Hall of critics you have to
[2:26:01] suffer terrain the reason for this is
[2:26:03] that character simply is never made
[2:26:06] without suffering character is a victory
[2:26:10] not a gift a man without character can
[2:26:13] train because POW apart from character
[2:26:15] is satanic but power with character is
[2:26:19] fit to rule and since he wants us to
[2:26:22] share I told y'all he wants us to share
[2:26:24] some things since he wants us to share
[2:26:26] even his game on the same basis that he
[2:26:30] overcame and a set down his Father's
[2:26:32] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[2:26:34] with him I love this and the little
[2:26:37] temporary suffering what does that tell
[2:26:40] you trouble don't last always the little
[2:26:46] temporary suffering we go through now is
[2:26:49] not worthy to be compared to the
[2:26:52] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[2:26:55] in us when he comes oh what treasures
[2:26:58] are laid up for those who
[2:27:01] are willing because you got to be
[2:27:03] willing who are willing to enter into
[2:27:05] his kingdom through much tribulation
[2:27:08] I remember brother troll when he first
[2:27:10] started out I said the kingdom of God
[2:27:12] suffers violence and say they say we got
[2:27:15] to confront the opposition right we got
[2:27:20] to confront the opposition you gotta
[2:27:22] have some stuff you go through but it's
[2:27:23] just bringing about God's glory that's
[2:27:26] all it's doing whatever whatever your
[2:27:27] suffering is bring about God's glory and
[2:27:29] I just I just felt you know just in my
[2:27:32] spirit because I really believe that the
[2:27:34] glory that you have experienced once
[2:27:36] before it's coming again I'm gonna tell
[2:27:41] you something it started this morning
[2:27:48] [Applause]
[2:27:53] Moses one time acts God Lord I beseech
[2:27:56] you show me your glory he wanted to see
[2:28:03] God's glory and and and brother Brandon
[2:28:06] made a statement he said I didn't get a
[2:28:08] chance I'm gonna just give you the the
[2:28:10] the the summed up version a man of what
[2:28:14] he said he said what really is God's
[2:28:19] glory they said when you see his healing
[2:28:23] when you see his wonders when you see
[2:28:27] his manifestations you are looking at
[2:28:30] his glory now you might have something
[2:28:33] you're going through right now in your
[2:28:34] body and you wondering why why why is
[2:28:38] that it's the same question that was
[2:28:41] axed to Jesus when they saw a man that
[2:28:45] was born blind you you might say well
[2:28:47] why am I going through this wine me the
[2:28:49] disciples asked Jesus they say why they
[2:28:52] say this man blind say whose sin was it
[2:28:57] his parents or him who sin why was this
[2:29:01] wisest man in his condition and Jesus
[2:29:03] says his mama danced in his dad it in
[2:29:08] sin and also he didn't sin he said but
[2:29:12] the reason that this condition
[2:29:14] exists it's so that everybody else could
[2:29:18] see the glory so the reason your
[2:29:25] condition exists because God wants to
[2:29:28] display his glory don't run from it
[2:29:40] Church run to it
[2:29:41] we saw God's glory when when David went
[2:29:44] to Goliath we saw God's glory right
[2:29:46] every trial we see in Scripture it
[2:29:48] reflected and show how great our God is
[2:29:51] and he wants to do the same in you the
[2:29:53] glory shall come again let's pray father
[2:30:02] just a thought Lord that you brought to
[2:30:05] me because we're just reading in the
[2:30:07] church age but the Lord how we longed to
[2:30:14] Lord just help the people see that you
[2:30:16] you're doing something even right now
[2:30:19] this is a message of prophecy the glory
[2:30:24] will come again no matter no matter what
[2:30:26] it is that we've gone through no matter
[2:30:27] what it is that we're facing the glory
[2:30:29] will come again it's the father in the
[2:30:32] name of Jesus let the people begin to
[2:30:37] experience that don't let it just be
[2:30:38] words that have been spoken but father
[2:30:40] may it be a reality in the life of every
[2:30:43] believer somebody wants to feel you the
[2:30:47] way they used to feel you somebody wants
[2:30:49] to serve you the way to use to sturb you
[2:30:50] somebody wants to live a man closer to
[2:30:53] you the way they used to God father let
[2:30:55] that glory come again and we realize
[2:30:58] that trials and tribulations are
[2:31:00] designed they're designed by your father
[2:31:04] that it might bring glory to you so lord
[2:31:08] don't don't let us run from it let us be
[2:31:09] like David run to it realizing a man
[2:31:13] that is not about we like we're not
[2:31:15] trying to bring glory to ourselves but
[2:31:16] we want to bring glory to you we want to
[2:31:18] exalt you we want to live for your God's
[2:31:21] that is our desire Lord let these words
[2:31:26] be received
[2:31:27] not just in the hint but in the heart of
[2:31:31] men and women today let these words be
[2:31:34] received and God they will see that the
[2:31:38] glory will come again I'm also reminded
[2:31:42] the scriptures say all have sinned and
[2:31:45] we fallen short of your glory that's
[2:31:49] because we were trying to do it in our
[2:31:51] own strength
[2:31:52] the Lord when we recognize that your
[2:31:55] blood washes us and cleanses us O God
[2:31:59] then you present us in your
[2:32:01] righteousness and we can live in that
[2:32:04] God daily we can live in that so what we
[2:32:07] pray we pray that each one father would
[2:32:11] receive what it is that you want them to
[2:32:13] receive today and they would begin to
[2:32:15] walk according to your glory we commit
[2:32:20] the hearers of this word into your
[2:32:23] capable hands
[2:32:24] in Jesus name we pray hey man and a man
[2:32:30] came together Lord a hand of praise
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:35] hallelujah a man a man Moses said I
[2:32:41] beseech thee Lord show me your glory and
[2:32:43] Moses heard those words God heard those
[2:32:46] words from Moses he showed him a man his
[2:32:50] his bat hinder parts he said you
[2:32:53] couldn't see my face and live but i'ma
[2:32:55] show you my head the parson got to show
[2:32:57] himself to Moses Amen Anna in a very
[2:32:59] special way in but when we saw Jesus we
[2:33:02] realized that we could see the face of
[2:33:03] God and live Scott warned us to behold
[2:33:07] his glory God wanted to express his
[2:33:10] glory God wants us to live in his glory
[2:33:13] hallelujah church you are part of that

[2:33:19] that God has for you if you've lost your
[2:33:23] way man I want to encourage you repent
