[42:54] appreciate it God bless you greet you
[42:56] all in the name of the Lord Jesus um as
[42:59] it was pointed out I want to just wish
[43:01] everyone a Happy Father's Day all the
[43:02] fathers a Happy Father's Day amen um
[43:05] just really good to be uh back in the
[43:07] house of the Lord amen uh if you have
[43:09] your Bibles turn with me to Ecclesiastes
[43:12] chapter
[43:14] 8 I'm always humbled by the opportunity
[43:17] to come and just minister to the bride
[43:18] of Christ amen sorry about that we'll
[43:22] have two opening
[43:24] scriptures um Ecclesiastes 8
[43:27] and then also have your Bibles ready to
[43:30] turn over to First Kings chapter
[43:34] 2 so I don't know what kind of preaching
[43:37] is going to happen this morning all I
[43:39] know I just want to talk about
[43:42] God Amen so it's a it's a thought that I
[43:46] shared with the church back home and
[43:50] after I shared it there was some more
[43:51] that the Lord just kind of opened up to
[43:52] me about and um so it's it's just a
[43:57] simple little thought and brother Braham
[43:59] had made reference to this individual on
[44:02] a couple of occasions but he tied it to
[44:05] his interaction with David but then when
[44:08] I started looking at um this individual
[44:12] in the scripture there's a lot more to
[44:13] it than I didn't realize before maybe
[44:15] you may have but it's just worth
[44:16] repeating these things and uh there's
[44:19] some lessons that at least that I took
[44:21] away from that was a blessing to me so I
[44:23] trust that it's a blessing to you so if
[44:25] you're there in Ecclesiastes say amen
[44:28] amen amen and then we'll read at
[44:33] verse um we'll start at verse
[44:38] one and it says who is as the wise man
[44:43] and who knoweth the interpretation of a
[44:46] thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to
[44:50] shine and the boldness of his face shall
[44:53] be
[44:54] changed I counsel thee to keep the
[44:58] king's
[45:00] commandment and that in regard of the
[45:03] oath of
[45:05] God be not Hasty to go out of his
[45:10] sight oh stand not in an evil
[45:14] thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth
[45:18] him verse four is are kind of like the
[45:21] uh the the Pinnacle of this scripture
[45:24] where the word of a king is there is
[45:27] power amen
[45:29] amen so turn with me to First
[45:33] Kings we use that scripture just to kind
[45:36] of lay a foundation and this is kind of
[45:39] um going to be the theme here so First
[45:42] Kings chapter 2 verse 36 and it's a bit
[45:45] of a reading so just bear with me so 1
[45:47] Kings 36 1 Kings chapter 2:36 and we'll
[45:50] read through verse 46 and it reads and
[45:54] the King sent and called for shimia
[45:57] and said unto him build thee a house in
[46:00] Jerusalem and dwell there and go not
[46:02] forth go and go not forth hen th any
[46:07] wither for it shall be that on the day
[46:10] thou goest out and passes over the brook
[46:13] Kidron Thou shalt know for certain that
[46:16] thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be
[46:20] upon thine own
[46:21] head and shimi said unto the king the
[46:24] saying is good and that's by
[46:26] interpretation he said amen to the
[46:28] preaching of the
[46:29] Gospel so he was in agreement with that
[46:31] yes sir and uh as my Lord the King has
[46:36] said where the word of the king is there
[46:37] is power sir so will thy servant do and
[46:40] shimi dwelt in Jerusalem many
[46:43] days and it came to pass at the end of
[46:47] three years that two of the Servants of
[46:49] shimi ran away unto akish son of makah
[46:53] King of gath and they told shimi saying
[46:56] Behold thy son servants be in gath and
[46:58] shimi arose and saddled his ass and went
[47:01] to gath to aish to seek his servants and
[47:04] shimi went and brought his servants from
[47:07] gath and it was told Solomon that shimi
[47:10] had gone from Jerusalem to gath and was
[47:12] come
[47:13] again and the King sent and called for
[47:16] shimi and said unto him did I not make
[47:18] thee to swear by the Lord and protested
[47:21] unto thee saying know for certain on the
[47:24] day thou goest out and wst abroad any
[47:28] wither Thou shalt surely die and thou
[47:31] said unto me you
[47:33] said that word the word that I have
[47:36] heard is good you said Amen to that word
[47:39] you agreed to
[47:42] this why then thou Hast not kept the
[47:46] oath of the
[47:48] Lord and the Commandment that I have
[47:50] charged with
[47:52] thee the king said moreover to shimi th
[47:55] knowest all the wicked n which thine
[47:59] heart is privy
[48:02] to that thou did to David my father and
[48:07] I'm trying to restrain myself I'm adding
[48:08] little points here but we'll come back
[48:09] to this therefore the Lord shall return
[48:13] thy wickedness upon thine own head and
[48:15] King Solomon and King Solomon shall be
[48:18] blessed and the Throne of David shall be
[48:21] established before the Lord forever so
[48:24] the king Comm commanded bah
[48:27] the son of jeida which went out and fell
[48:30] upon him that he died and the kingdom
[48:33] was established in the hand of
[48:36] Solomon let's bow our hearts gracious
[48:38] Heavenly Father we come before your
[48:40] throne of grace we thank you for this
[48:42] opportunity that afforded unto us and
[48:44] dear Lord it it bestows me with great
[48:46] honor dear Lord that I could just have
[48:48] the opportunity and the privilege to
[48:50] address your bride and father dear Lord
[48:53] I'm reminded of what your Prophet say
[48:54] that the closest thing to Heaven here on
[48:56] Earth is the Pulpit there's just such
[48:58] sacredness that goes behind standing
[49:00] behind this sacred desk dear Lord guard
[49:02] my lips from saying anything contrary to
[49:04] your word and as your people open up
[49:07] their hearts to Lord use me as a vessel
[49:08] that you could Minister Your Truth unto
[49:10] them your word unto them and father may
[49:13] you bring the Lord salvation may you
[49:15] bring healing may you bring Deliverance
[49:18] may you open up our eyes the Lord and
[49:20] I'm reminded also of what you prophesy
[49:22] that any man with any ability of his own
[49:23] can flip back the pages of the Bible but
[49:25] it takes the Lamb of God to come and
[49:27] break bread with us dear Lord you're
[49:29] more than invited in this place you're
[49:31] welcome in this place come and speak to
[49:33] our hungry Hearts we commit all things
[49:35] into your hands in Christ's name we pray
[49:37] amen amen you may be seated I don't
[49:40] think I'll be long but you know it's
[49:42] like one preacher said that Peter
[49:44] preached about 30 minutes and Paul
[49:47] preached a full night he says I'm
[49:49] somewhere in
[49:50] between
[49:52] so um the Bible you know we open up the
[49:56] scripture with the Bible says where the
[49:57] word of the where the word of the king
[49:59] is there is
[50:01] power there's nothing more preeminent
[50:05] there's nothing more uh powerful than
[50:09] when a king says a word and the thing
[50:11] about it is that when God speaks he
[50:13] doesn't speak with a
[50:15] stutter God's very clear about what he
[50:17] has to say about his word right God
[50:20] didn't stutter when he made a decision
[50:21] about you no sir so when God looked at
[50:24] you he says that's my chosen right and
[50:26] that's an absolute yes sir it was a
[50:28] prophet who told us that this word of
[50:30] God is an
[50:32] absolute men you know they write stories
[50:35] and the right Chronicles and the right
[50:37] editions and there's a third edition and
[50:39] the fourth edition and the fifth edition
[50:41] because man is ever learning right he's
[50:43] ever coming to his senses and he's ever
[50:46] learning something that he didn't know
[50:47] before but when God spoke the thing from
[50:49] the very beginning it's established in
[50:51] the end yes sir so when God saw you from
[50:54] the beginning it's established in the
[50:55] end the in between does not matter to
[50:58] God he's going to work with you in the
[51:00] in between people may cast their
[51:01] judgment on you but it doesn't change
[51:03] God's judgment about you amen because
[51:06] where the word of the king is it is
[51:08] established regardless of your opinions
[51:11] about me your opinions about your
[51:13] brother or your sister whether you think
[51:15] they're going to make it to the Rapture
[51:16] or not whether you think they're going
[51:18] to have a body change or not your
[51:20] opinions does not matter about my
[51:22] salvation God made that decision about
[51:25] me yes sir Hallelujah and so therefore
[51:28] I'm relling upon God's word because
[51:30] where the word of the king is there is
[51:34] power yes sir and so that's the reason
[51:37] why I believe in the in Genesis and the
[51:39] Bible says God said let there be right
[51:43] there was an absolute right there was an
[51:46] assurity when God spoke right let there
[51:51] be and the Bible says and there was it
[51:55] was not where let there maybe be perhaps
[51:59] it may happen and I hope it comes to
[52:02] pass but in that same vein that God was
[52:05] saying let there be and he was speaking
[52:07] the world into existence because the
[52:10] world the Earth was out of the world of
[52:12] the Earth was in chaos yes sir it was in
[52:16] disorder it was in a chaotic State and
[52:19] the Bible says there was darkness that
[52:20] shrouded the Earth and God says Let
[52:24] There Be and the light was already there
[52:26] he didn't call the light for creation
[52:28] the light was already there but there
[52:30] was a darkness that veiled the earth and
[52:33] the Very word that spoke Let There Be
[52:37] remove the shroud of Darkness from the
[52:39] earth and the seed that was already on
[52:42] the inside of the earth brought forth
[52:45] and that is a perfect type of you and
[52:48] I so when God saw you in your sinful
[52:52] State he says Let There Be yes and the
[52:56] dark darkness that shrouded your heart
[52:58] when you were in Wicked sin that
[53:00] Darkness left that Darkness was unveiled
[53:03] in the seed that was already on the
[53:06] inside begin to materialize and produce
[53:09] a child of God amen amen so where the
[53:13] word of the king is there is power
[53:17] Hallelujah and it's upon this
[53:20] idea that we're preaching this gospel
[53:22] this morning so turn with me because
[53:24] we're going to do a bit of reading to 2
[53:29] Psalms 2 Samuel 2
[53:32] Samuel you love the Lord
[53:36] amen 2
[53:39] Samuel chapter
[53:45] 16 2 Samuel chapter
[53:51] 16 everything happens for a reason yes
[53:55] we may not have the answer we may not
[53:57] know why but everything happens for a
[53:58] reason Not Mere chance am and
[54:02] so we're introduced to shimi for the
[54:07] first time in this scripture reading and
[54:10] this is a reading that you are all
[54:11] familiar with whether you've read it or
[54:13] the prophet
[54:14] quoted and I'll read the first two
[54:16] verses and I'll give you a background
[54:18] and when the and when King David came to
[54:22] buam behold F came out a man of the
[54:25] family of the of Saul whose name was
[54:28] shimi now that's
[54:30] important the son of Gara he came forth
[54:33] and cursed still as he
[54:36] came and he cast stones at David and at
[54:40] all the Servants of King David and all
[54:43] the people and all the mighty men were
[54:46] on his right hand and on his
[54:49] left so shimi comes across
[54:53] David now at this point David is on the
[54:57] run right and let me kind of paint a
[55:00] background because you know I often
[55:02] wondered and I'm kind of working on the
[55:04] thought here is a a lesson on a making
[55:08] of a
[55:09] devil and cuz I I I struggled at one
[55:13] time to understand what was it that uh
[55:17] the Bible says in Revelation where the
[55:19] dragon drew a third right of God's uh of
[55:23] God's angels by a third of God's angels
[55:25] and I and I say to myself what sermon
[55:27] could he have possibly
[55:29] preached that could have been
[55:31] convincingly enough to persuade a third
[55:35] of God's angels that that's the man I
[55:37] need to
[55:38] follow come on now and I saw that in the
[55:43] in the interaction with absolum and
[55:45] David right and I'll just give you a
[55:48] little bit of snippet because what
[55:49] happened was that Absalon was H was a
[55:53] was an offspring of David his own son
[55:58] uhuh grew he watched him grew up from
[56:01] when he was just an infant to a grown
[56:04] man and as Absalon grew up and David had
[56:08] other children as well and so Absalon
[56:12] had his eyes fixed towards the
[56:16] throne he wanted to replace the position
[56:19] that his father was in
[56:22] Lord and so let me just pause it real
[56:24] quickly we know the story story of Saul
[56:28] and David and how they were in constant
[56:31] battle actually it was Saul's men that
[56:33] was in constant battle with David's men
[56:35] right and the Bible says that David
[56:38] behaved himself wisely around Saul yes
[56:41] sir that even when Saul had died David
[56:45] didn't say hooray my enemy has died but
[56:47] he was humbled about that and he even
[56:51] cried the humility that he shown but
[56:54] there was Strife between Saul Saul's
[56:58] house and David's
[56:59] house and there were and there was a
[57:02] there were there were Waring factions
[57:05] but God had anointed David and his men
[57:08] David in particular to rise up to become
[57:11] king cuz God not how turned his his
[57:13] attention away from
[57:15] Saul and so at one point Saul's kingdom
[57:20] was a thriving Kingdom he had a a a
[57:23] group of people that was of of royalty
[57:25] they were preeminent they were they were
[57:28] prestigious they had respect right and
[57:31] so wherever they went people say this is
[57:32] of the House of Saul but when Saul no
[57:35] longer served God his kingdom began to
[57:38] crumble right and so God now turned his
[57:41] attention to David and everything that
[57:43] was attached to Saul be to fall apart
[57:46] and so shimi the Bible says he was of
[57:48] the House of Saul and we'll come back to
[57:51] that point and so in the meantime you
[57:53] find Absalon being raised in front of
[57:56] David and now he has his eyes set upon
[57:58] the throne right but he can't just
[58:01] overthrow because he knew that the
[58:03] people's hearts are for David God had
[58:06] established him as a king yes sir Lord
[58:10] God had established him as a king and so
[58:12] when people uh when as people interacted
[58:15] with David Absalon saw that he says I
[58:17] can't just go up there and just take
[58:19] take take take take the seed of
[58:21] power I have to be more cunning than
[58:24] that right I have to be a little bit
[58:26] more discreet in that yes sir so what
[58:31] happened was that as people would go to
[58:33] the gate to offer their petitions to
[58:36] David and they they would bring their
[58:38] petitions to David and David would judge
[58:40] the matter of the people absolon says oh
[58:44] if the people could now come to me
[58:46] instead of going to
[58:48] David that's
[58:51] important because instead of going to
[58:54] David abson says you know what for these
[58:58] people that's in this
[58:59] region rather bringing your concerns to
[59:02] David by the way I'm David's
[59:08] son the people didn't know any different
[59:12] who am I to question the son of a king
[59:14] right right rightow my Lord so rather
[59:18] bringing your matter to David you just
[59:20] bring your judgment to me and all of a
[59:23] sudden at that moment that person
[59:25] becomes an authority figure
[59:27] right so the people brought the matter
[59:30] to Absalon and says I have this issue
[59:32] and I have that issue and Absalon judge
[59:35] the matter and you know what the
[59:36] people's like I like the way you
[59:39] judge when I have another issue I'll
[59:41] come back to
[59:42] you you're just the person I
[59:46] need and so they keep coming back and
[59:48] that's the reason why it's so important
[59:50] you know even as a even as an associate
[59:53] Minister I'm very guarded with how I
[59:54] interact with the people and how they
[59:56] see me versus how they see my
[1:00:01] pastor because when someone comes to me
[1:00:03] and talks to me and say BR I got a
[1:00:04] question for you the first thing I say
[1:00:05] is did you talk to brother
[1:00:07] Stacy cuz I don't want to ever be
[1:00:09] replaced I don't want to be in that
[1:00:11] position I don't want to be a tool in
[1:00:13] the hands of the devil right right right
[1:00:15] amen hallelujah bri can I get your
[1:00:19] opinion about something that's very
[1:00:22] dangerous sir come on y'all y'all can
[1:00:24] get quiet on me I know
[1:00:27] you got to be guarded because the
[1:00:28] devil's looking for a vessel to work
[1:00:30] through yes sir amen that's the truth
[1:00:34] and the Bible says that Absalon this is
[1:00:37] what got me Absalon stole the hearts of
[1:00:40] the people yes
[1:00:42] sir stole the hearts of the the people
[1:00:45] didn't willingly give it they stole it
[1:00:47] because who are the people to question
[1:00:49] the King's son in the first place
[1:00:56] and so the people started to bring their
[1:00:58] matter to Absalon the
[1:01:01] son instead of bringing it to
[1:01:03] David and through that he strategically
[1:01:06] started doing things here and I'm just
[1:01:08] it's it's the making of a devil but I I
[1:01:10] I'll get to it some other time but he
[1:01:11] started doing some things here some
[1:01:13] things there he started winning 10
[1:01:15] people uhhuh uhhuh 15 people 100 people
[1:01:20] yeah and let me tell you the devil he
[1:01:21] works he knows how to talk he knows how
[1:01:25] to work yes yes
[1:01:28] sir cuz we're the
[1:01:31] bride that's the reason why I'm so
[1:01:32] guarded with what I say to you as a
[1:01:34] bride because I don't want my word to be
[1:01:36] replaced with what the pastor preaches
[1:01:37] to
[1:01:38] you if someone got an issue with my
[1:01:40] family don't go to my wife to come to me
[1:01:43] right amen cuz I'm the head of the
[1:01:44] household I make the decisions I'm
[1:01:46] responsible for my family and I
[1:01:48] collaborate with my family right right
[1:01:51] right amen amen but when somebody's like
[1:01:54] oh I talk to your wife while like why
[1:01:56] you talk to
[1:01:57] me right she's going to come back and
[1:02:00] talk to me anyhow right brother amen but
[1:02:02] that's the reason why so important for
[1:02:04] us to be in our position good so what
[1:02:07] happened was that as Solomon's influence
[1:02:11] was building up as as as absolum
[1:02:15] influence was building up David started
[1:02:18] to see what was happening and it was
[1:02:20] being murmured around them that absolum
[1:02:22] is growing in
[1:02:23] power and the Bible says that the
[1:02:26] conspiracy that's what the Bible says
[1:02:28] the Bible says that the conspiracy was
[1:02:33] great so people had feelings that you
[1:02:35] know what I don't know about this
[1:02:38] anymore because the moment you start
[1:02:40] saying things you start talking things
[1:02:42] and a man may come win your heart next
[1:02:45] thing you know whenever your pastor gets
[1:02:47] up here and he preaches he's like well
[1:02:48] that's not the way brother so and so
[1:02:49] stated it to
[1:02:51] me that's not the way I heard it when I
[1:02:53] visited this church that's not the way
[1:02:56] that's not the way he told it to me we
[1:02:58] start building these these these
[1:02:59] unintended barriers and we begin to
[1:03:02] criticize and we see things differently
[1:03:05] because someone planted a seed that
[1:03:07] shouldn't be in the first place
[1:03:11] am yes amen amen you're not obligated to
[1:03:14] brother Jean you're obligated to God
[1:03:16] amen amen amen amen amen and as absolum
[1:03:21] started to grow in power David's like I
[1:03:24] don't want any strife
[1:03:26] I don't want anything to do with my
[1:03:28] son's you know kind of situation here so
[1:03:31] he begins to kind of take
[1:03:33] flight he begins to run because his his
[1:03:36] kingdom is now being brought into
[1:03:39] question is beginning to kind of lose
[1:03:41] its
[1:03:43] stronghold and so a few of David's loyal
[1:03:46] men his Mighty Men followed
[1:03:49] David and went with him but shimi that's
[1:03:53] where we get here shimi saw David and
[1:03:56] his men and he sought an opportunity
[1:03:59] because now David was in a weak State
[1:04:00] and that's the way the devil treats you
[1:04:02] it's whenever you've been in a position
[1:04:05] that where you've been blessed you've
[1:04:07] been highly favored and you going
[1:04:08] through trials in your life and now
[1:04:10] you're down in the dumps and the Devil
[1:04:12] comes and appears his real ugly head
[1:04:14] that's right yes
[1:04:17] sir he want to cast some stones at you
[1:04:21] you thought you were somebody at one
[1:04:23] time the devil want to H any sort of
[1:04:26] insults just to make you feel little
[1:04:28] than you already feel when you're down
[1:04:30] in the dumps know what and the reason
[1:04:33] why is because he's holding a grudge
[1:04:35] because he remembered how God blessed
[1:04:37] you back in the
[1:04:40] day that's the reason why the devil has
[1:04:42] something against you because he knows
[1:04:44] how much God loves you yes sir he knows
[1:04:46] how much God favors you he knows how
[1:04:48] much God bless you let me tell I don't
[1:04:50] care how deep in the dumps you are it
[1:04:53] didn't change David's status he was
[1:04:55] still King yes amen no matter how deep
[1:05:00] and sin that you may get and the devil
[1:05:03] drags you into sin it does not change
[1:05:05] that seed on the
[1:05:07] inside God looks at you and still sees
[1:05:10] that you're a child of
[1:05:15] God someone may be gunning for your
[1:05:18] seat they could do all the best to try
[1:05:20] to get a hold of your seat but what God
[1:05:22] has given to you is for you nobody no
[1:05:26] Spirit no devil can take the blessings
[1:05:28] that God has given unto you
[1:05:31] Hallelujah I don't care how many Saints
[1:05:34] get to the other side my seed is
[1:05:38] reserved amen amen what God has given to
[1:05:41] you is for
[1:05:43] you
[1:05:46] sir you might be in your lowest of
[1:05:48] lowest point in your life it doesn't
[1:05:50] change the election it does not change
[1:05:53] predestination right amen amen
[1:05:56] hallelujah amen because it's in that
[1:05:59] moment in this moment where David is
[1:06:02] weak with his man he's outside he's not
[1:06:04] sitting on the throne he's not sitting
[1:06:06] in his big Temple he's not that's when
[1:06:08] the that's when the Devil comes and
[1:06:10] start hurling insults he start casting
[1:06:14] Stones look at you oh my you're not even
[1:06:18] in church when you're supposed to be in
[1:06:20] church you're not even praising God that
[1:06:23] you're supposed to be praising God
[1:06:24] you're sitting in church is going
[1:06:26] through the motions oh my casting Stones
[1:06:29] why because he remembered Jimmy I
[1:06:31] remembered when he was part of that
[1:06:33] royalty of Saul where how people
[1:06:35] realized who he was that he was somebody
[1:06:38] and that he was somebody of importance
[1:06:39] because you know he was of that family
[1:06:41] Saul's family the household and now
[1:06:43] that's crumbled to nothing it's in
[1:06:45] shambles it doesn't even exist anymore
[1:06:47] and now the same Fate has come to David
[1:06:50] and so shimia says this is my
[1:06:51] opportunity say what you did to me has
[1:06:54] come to you
[1:06:58] yeah let me tell you Saints just because
[1:07:00] someone's going through a trial doesn't
[1:07:02] mean that God has abandoned
[1:07:04] them Hallelujah just because you see
[1:07:07] someone's beaten up doesn't mean they
[1:07:08] lost the fight sir sir come on somebody
[1:07:11] I've never been in a fight where I
[1:07:12] haven't gotten a black eye but I always
[1:07:14] say you should take a look at the other
[1:07:15] guy cuz I'm going to fight every inch of
[1:07:18] ground that God has given to me exactly
[1:07:21] right amen we're in this fight all the
[1:07:24] way to the end yes of course I'm going
[1:07:26] to have bruises of course I'm going to
[1:07:28] have wounds but I'm not going to give up
[1:07:29] because he that has called me is
[1:07:34] greater
[1:07:38] Hallelujah and shimi came to him and
[1:07:41] said look at you your man let me tell
[1:07:43] you the Bible Jesus said if they hate me
[1:07:46] they will hate you too right true if
[1:07:49] everything's hunky dory for you you
[1:07:50] might want to go back and check your
[1:07:52] salvation we're in a battle I know I
[1:07:55] don't have a lot of friends that's right
[1:07:58] people don't like when whenever they
[1:07:59] come to me and say well I pray for you
[1:08:01] they may not like that they may not like
[1:08:03] my language but I'm built
[1:08:05] different I'm called for a different
[1:08:07] purpose yes
[1:08:09] sir
[1:08:12] amen oh and so when chimia he wasn't
[1:08:15] only casting stones at David he was
[1:08:17] casting stones at David's friends to the
[1:08:19] left the Bible sis and to the right and
[1:08:22] let me tell you these AR little these
[1:08:23] are little Pebbles I'm talking about
[1:08:25] these are some big chunks of rocks yes

[1:08:29] on them and if they hit you they're
[1:08:30] going to hit you pretty bad he had he
[1:08:32] had anger that was built up for
[1:08:36] years people hold a grudge just because
[1:08:38] they see you every day being blessed and
[1:08:41] they're watching you just waiting for
[1:08:42] that opportunity for you to slip up and
[1:08:44] mess up let me tell you but God who has
[1:08:46] brought me this
[1:08:48] far is able to bring me the rest of the
[1:08:51] way Hallelujah yes sir yes sir they may
[1:08:56] be looking at me but let me tell you I'm
[1:08:57] going to be in that mountain the same
[1:08:59] God that's in the Mountaintop is the
[1:09:02] same God that's in the valley the Bible
[1:09:04] says y though I walk through the valley

[1:10:28] rage they misunderstand what you're
[1:10:30] going through thinking that God is veng
[1:10:32] is avenging
[1:10:37] them they're so blinded the Bible says
[1:10:40] wo to them that call evil good and good
[1:10:44] evil he was so filled with rage he
[1:10:46] didn't even know what was happening to
[1:10:50] David the blood of the House of Saul and
[1:10:52] who St thou H has rained who St
[1:10:56] it should have been Saul he's telling
[1:10:57] you it should have been Saul that should
[1:10:58] have rained but who and he didn't
[1:11:01] realize that the making of David as a
[1:11:03] king was God's doing yes sir you never
[1:11:06] asked to be blessed God blessed you
[1:11:08] anyhow amen and that's what gets the
[1:11:11] devil even more upset

[1:11:16] business you just say Lord I love you
[1:11:18] Lord I appreciate you and the blessings

[1:11:31] devil's not here to make friends with
[1:11:32] you

[1:11:37] if you know just let me know but the
[1:11:39] devil hates you that's right yes he does
[1:11:42] yes sir and whose house out there and
[1:11:44] the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into
[1:11:46] the hand of Absalon he's stolen some
[1:11:49] insults he says star of rain and not
[1:11:52] only that your son is not rainning in
[1:11:54] this Kingdom and behold thou are taken
[1:11:56] in thy Mischief because thou are a
[1:11:58] bloody man it's come back to
[1:12:03] you then said abashi verse 9 the son of
[1:12:06] Zariah unto the king why should this
[1:12:09] dead dog curse my Lord the
[1:12:12] king let me go over I pray thee and take
[1:12:15] off his head next verse the Bible says
[1:12:18] and the King said what have I to do with
[1:12:20] thee thy sons of Zariah so let him curse
[1:12:23] because the Lord has s unto him curse
[1:12:26] David who shall then say wherefor thou H
[1:12:28] has done so let me tell you sometimes
[1:12:30] it's so easy for you to kind of curl up
[1:12:32] your lips and give somebody a piece of
[1:12:34] your
[1:12:36] mind but I know the scripture the Bible
[1:12:38] says be still and know that I am God you
[1:12:42] don't need to defend yourself God will
[1:12:44] defend
[1:12:45] you yes sir amen I wish I was ready to
[1:12:50] Stow some Stones back oh I got some
[1:12:52] Choice words for you too shim
[1:12:56] you think you're and King David like
[1:12:58] calm down uhuh let just let don't don't
[1:13:01] don't it's God doing this you don't need
[1:13:03] to get worked up don't get worked up
[1:13:04] because somebody say things to you they
[1:13:07] look you at a certain way they may not
[1:13:08] Shake Your Hands they may look at you in
[1:13:10] a sad eye at work at school they might
[1:13:12] feel funny about you you don't owe
[1:13:14] anyone any
[1:13:16] explanation work out your own salvation
[1:13:19] with fear and trembling you're not
[1:13:21] obligated to no man but God himself
[1:13:25] hallelujah amen
[1:13:29] good ab I wanted to defend this King
[1:13:31] he's like you know what let me pick up
[1:13:32] some St man I'm about to do this is
[1:13:34] getting crazy yeah
[1:13:36] yeah and David has com and that's that's
[1:13:39] the importance of
[1:13:41] leadership how a husband a father a
[1:13:44] pastor whomever is a leader how he
[1:13:46] responds to a situation is how his flock
[1:13:49] responds to that situation amen yes sir
[1:13:52] it's so important what you say what you
[1:13:54] do
[1:13:55] how you do it when you do it all that I
[1:13:58] got two little eyes that's watching me
[1:14:00] constantly day in and day
[1:14:02] out yeah so David as much as I'm sure he
[1:14:06] probably wanted to just retaliate
[1:14:07] against shimi he says look I man put
[1:14:10] your knife away man relax this is God's
[1:14:14] doing God told him to do
[1:14:16] this people going to come to you and
[1:14:18] look at you and criticize
[1:14:20] you that's true amen maybe you once had
[1:14:23] a good position and you lost your job
[1:14:25] look at this look at this right now you
[1:14:28] ain't nobody my Lord you might be on the
[1:14:31] verge of losing your house God's getting
[1:14:33] ready to Humble
[1:14:35] you you don't know how you're going to
[1:14:37] keep your car and make your next car
[1:14:38] payment your children that was so good
[1:14:41] is now running out there in the
[1:14:43] world come on those are real
[1:14:46] things but it doesn't mean that God has
[1:14:48] abandoned you it doesn't mean that God
[1:14:50] has left you it doesn't mean that God
[1:14:52] stopped working with you because there's
[1:14:54] a there's a good ending to this story
[1:14:57] yes sir amen hallelujah amen
[1:15:02] sir be still and know that I am God yes
[1:15:07] Lord and David said unto abashi and to
[1:15:11] all his servants behold my son which
[1:15:13] cometh forth of my bows seeketh my life
[1:15:15] he said look I know what happened my son
[1:15:17] seeketh my life how much more now they
[1:15:20] now may this benjamite do it let him
[1:15:22] alone and let him curse me curse him for
[1:15:24] the the Lord ha bidden
[1:15:26] him and it may be that the Lord will
[1:15:28] look upon my Affliction and that the
[1:15:30] Lord will requite me good of for his
[1:15:33] cursing this day that the Lord may look
[1:15:35] upon my Affliction Lord you see I'm not
[1:15:37] retaliating right I'm an eagle I fly
[1:15:40] over all the chaos and the and and and
[1:15:42] all the confusion when people are when
[1:15:45] people are talking and chittering CH uh
[1:15:48] chitchatting and making statements you
[1:15:50] fly over these things yes sir you above
[1:15:52] those things that's the reason why we're
[1:15:54] in an age because you were meant to fly
[1:15:57] over all of the nonsense that comes
[1:16:00] across your way true brother and we're
[1:16:02] bombarded every waking moment of every
[1:16:05] day with things that we are faced with
[1:16:07] and God has given us a spirit and
[1:16:09] anointing to rise above those
[1:16:12] things yes
[1:16:15] sir and the Bible says in verse 13 and
[1:16:17] as David and his men went
[1:16:21] by they mind their own businesses just
[1:16:23] kept on going David and his man as they
[1:16:25] went by No Doubt Abisha was still
[1:16:27] looking at shimia I said man you better
[1:16:29] be glad that David got me just having
[1:16:31] his eyes on him but kind of restraining
[1:16:33] himself and shimi went along on the
[1:16:36] hillside over against them you might be
[1:16:38] saying you know what I don't got no time
[1:16:39] for this I'm going to keep walking and
[1:16:41] that Devil's still peppering things at
[1:16:42] you still throwing things you trying to
[1:16:44] be above it and walking and you he's
[1:16:46] still hurling insults right that devil
[1:16:50] test your
[1:16:51] patience but you know what you keep
[1:16:53] coming back to church keep going back to
[1:16:55] that word you keep going back to your
[1:16:57] knees he said Lord be it unto me
[1:17:00] according unto Thy
[1:17:02] word brother yes sir and the Bible says
[1:17:05] and he kept on as he cursed he went on
[1:17:07] and threw stones at him and cast dust he
[1:17:09] was doing everything and the Bible says
[1:17:10] and the king and all the people that
[1:17:12] were with him came worry and refreshed
[1:17:19] themselves so that was what happened
[1:17:21] with
[1:17:23] shimi and as the story went
[1:17:28] along there was so much to this Absalon
[1:17:32] has
[1:17:33] cels one that was with uh one that was
[1:17:36] with uh with
[1:17:38] David and that was true to David and
[1:17:40] gave counsel to Absalon and one that
[1:17:44] just revolted against David and was
[1:17:46] given counsel to
[1:17:49] Absalon so David worked to put I forget
[1:17:53] his name but to put this individual in
[1:17:55] the presence of Absalon to give him
[1:17:58] counsel and we keep David up to date and
[1:18:02] so the other individual and these are
[1:18:04] some names I can't pronounce but the
[1:18:06] other individual comes to abson and
[1:18:07] abson says what should we do he says you
[1:18:09] know what while your father's in the
[1:18:10] while your father's uh running let me
[1:18:12] gather about 10,000 men I believe it was
[1:18:15] the count and let me go over take him
[1:18:17] and bring and take his
[1:18:20] life and absam say well that sounds that
[1:18:22] sounds all right and so he calls David a
[1:18:26] counsel and just say hey what do you
[1:18:27] think about this and he's like no you
[1:18:29] shouldn't do that and he gave him some
[1:18:31] counsel based upon how God anointed him
[1:18:35] and so he rejected the other individual
[1:18:36] and the other individual was so upset
[1:18:38] with the fact that his Council was
[1:18:40] rejected the Bible says he went back to
[1:18:41] his house put his house in order and
[1:18:43] hang himself killed himself that's how
[1:18:47] important it this was for him but that
[1:18:49] his word was
[1:18:51] rejected by the by the said King
[1:18:55] and so as they went into battle now
[1:18:58] David David's men and absalon's men they
[1:19:01] went into
[1:19:03] battle and the Bible says that Absalon
[1:19:06] and this might be gruesome but it's
[1:19:07] written in the scripture Absalon was
[1:19:09] riding a mule and as he was In the Heat
[1:19:12] of the battle he was riding a mule and
[1:19:15] he came across a Great Oak a big tree
[1:19:18] yeah and the Bible and the way I could
[1:19:20] display it the the the the he came
[1:19:22] across the Oak and he hit his head on
[1:19:25] the Oak and maybe there might have been
[1:19:27] a a vshape and his head got hung on the
[1:19:31] on the oak so it was just stuck like
[1:19:33] this and the Bible says the mule kept on
[1:19:36] running and the Bible says he hung
[1:19:38] Between Heaven and Earth so there he was
[1:19:40] just dangling couldn't and so a man
[1:19:44] stumbled across him and saw
[1:19:46] him and went back and told joab and
[1:19:50] joab's like you didn't kill him I would
[1:19:52] have given you 10 shekles I would have
[1:19:55] given you a girdle just by virtue of
[1:19:57] telling him the man has enough wisdom
[1:19:58] than joab who knew David he says look
[1:20:01] man even if you were giving me a
[1:20:02] thousand shekels you heard what David
[1:20:04] said no man touch my
[1:20:09] son no man touch my son even when he was
[1:20:13] on the Run he says no man touched my son
[1:20:15] yeah and so joab dismisses that and
[1:20:18] identifies a group of men who goes and
[1:20:21] kills Absalon
[1:20:24] Absalon dies in battle it gets back to
[1:20:28] David there's a there's a lot of you
[1:20:30] could go back and read it in Samuel it
[1:20:32] goes back to David and rather than
[1:20:34] people thinking well you think David's
[1:20:35] going to Rejoice that's his flesh and
[1:20:36] blood right right right so David
[1:20:40] lamented and he
[1:20:45] cried there was a day of
[1:20:49] mourning joab had a conversation with
[1:20:51] David to kind of bring David to
[1:20:53] himself this is all important to where
[1:20:55] I'm getting to and in chapter
[1:20:59] 19:9 now that Absalon is dead his
[1:21:02] kingdom is not
[1:21:04] crumbling and in verse n and all the
[1:21:06] people all the people were at Strife
[1:21:09] through all 19 ver9 and all the people
[1:21:13] were at Strife throughout all the tribes
[1:21:15] of Israel saying The King The King saved
[1:21:18] us out of the hand of our enemies and he
[1:21:20] delivered us out of the hand of the
[1:21:21] Philistines and now he is fled out of
[1:21:23] the land of AB out of the land of abson
[1:21:26] absolum whom we anointed over us is dead
[1:21:30] in
[1:21:31] battle verse 15 so the king
[1:21:37] returned so now absalon's Kingdom has
[1:21:41] fallen and David's Kingdom has been
[1:21:47] returned now it's back to a restoration
[1:21:50] yes sir yes let's read verse
[1:21:53] 16 remember shimi he comes back on the
[1:21:56] scene
[1:21:57] again and shimi the son of Gara a
[1:22:02] benjamite now word gotten out that
[1:22:05] Absalon is no longer King so can you
[1:22:08] just imagine shimi he's stand there just
[1:22:10] like that's good for David now where
[1:22:13] he's going to run to God dealt with him
[1:22:15] just like he dealt with me and so word

[1:22:42] son of Gab benjamite which was of baram
[1:22:45] hasted and came down with the man of
[1:22:48] Juda to meet King David what a different
[1:22:51] attitude yes sir yes sir

[1:27:45] fight and God will bless you for it
[1:27:51] amen
[1:27:52] amen yeah shimia was
[1:27:55] frightened can you just imagine when the
[1:27:57] first time he got news Hallelujah when
[1:27:59] David when Absalon died and David now
[1:28:02] was coming back to his throne he's like
[1:28:03] what did I
[1:28:04] say oh my Lord I talked about his family
[1:28:10] too oh man this is not good at all this
[1:28:13] a not good at all I got to figure out
[1:28:16] like I got to make this right you know
[1:28:17] I'm going to be the first one to go up
[1:28:18] this say I'm
[1:28:22] wrong I'm going to try F seek his
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:26] favor and abishai he was want to say
[1:28:29] something he was want he he he enjoys
[1:28:31] conflict and they like no you don't need
[1:28:33] to do that just smile and keep
[1:28:35] walking and when David kept walking you
[1:28:37] notice that shimia didn't follow whereas
[1:28:39] before he was still peppering them
[1:28:40] wherever they were going when David kept
[1:28:43] them walk he's like God bless y'all the
[1:28:45] Lord is good the Lord is good God bless
[1:28:48] you and she and I B I would probably
[1:28:50] still looking at him as he was walking
[1:28:52] by
[1:28:55] cuz he remember what he said to
[1:28:57] David right but when God bless you you
[1:29:00] don't need to explain true amen you
[1:29:03] don't need to defend that's right just
[1:29:05] be humble about what God has blessed you
[1:29:06] and just know that he that works in
[1:29:09] you we'll finish it yes he will
[1:29:14] amen and David said verse 22 what I have
[1:29:17] to do with you ye sons of sirri that ye
[1:29:20] should this day be adversaries unto me
[1:29:22] shall there be uh shall there any man be
[1:29:25] put to death to the state in Israel for
[1:29:27] do not I know listen to this for do not
[1:29:30] I
[1:29:32] know that I am the this day King over
[1:29:38] Israel let me read that again for do not
[1:29:41] I know that I am this day King over
[1:29:43] Israel he's
[1:29:45] like what are we trying to explain to
[1:29:47] shimi who is he that I need to explain
[1:29:51] who I am right right right that's right
[1:29:53] don't you know I know that I'm a Child
[1:29:55] of
[1:29:56] God I don't need to explain myself to
[1:29:59] shimi sure he cast on sure he threw
[1:30:02] things sure he's talked about my family
[1:30:03] sure he was happy but I don't need no
[1:30:05] explanation God blesses
[1:30:07] me I'm just going to walk with a smile
[1:30:10] because God blesses me and not only that
[1:30:12] he turns and He blesses shimi he says
[1:30:13] therefore verse 23 the king said unto
[1:30:15] shimi thou shal not die and the King
[1:30:18] swear unto
[1:30:22] him all right so that was with
[1:30:25] shimi and
[1:30:27] shimi he heard what David said he's like
[1:30:30] you won't
[1:30:31] die cuz David got bigger things to worry
[1:30:34] about he knew that shimia was acting on
[1:30:37] what on on Prophecy God he says God told
[1:30:40] him to do that so David's like you won't
[1:30:44] die and shimi he looked at David he's
[1:30:47] like God bless your
[1:30:50] soul you're a good man and I knew that
[1:30:52] from the depth of my heart you were
[1:30:55] man people would say things just to get
[1:30:57] out of trouble I knew that from the
[1:30:59] moment I saw you David I knew there was
[1:31:01] something special about Chief but you
[1:31:02] know that's just the way it is you know
[1:31:05] but God bless you y'all keep going y'all
[1:31:06] keep going so he thought he was
[1:31:09] free and so now there was a change in
[1:31:13] leadership and so David was passing over
[1:31:17] he was
[1:31:18] dying and so Solomon was now taking on
[1:31:21] the rain and so David
[1:31:25] remembered some of the things as men
[1:31:27] that were loyal to him and those that
[1:31:29] didn't do as well and then as he was
[1:31:33] recounting that he calls um he calls
[1:31:35] over Solomon and he tells Solomon you
[1:31:38] know remember uh joab and he done this
[1:31:40] and remember this person he done this
[1:31:42] and in verse 8 chapter First Kings
[1:31:44] chapter 2:8 and
[1:31:46] behold this is n and behold thou Hast
[1:31:50] with thee
[1:31:52] shimi the son of G A benjamite of bam
[1:31:55] which cursed me with the Grievous curse
[1:31:57] in the day when I went to meim but he
[1:32:00] came down to meet me at Jordan and I
[1:32:03] swear to him by the Lord saying I will
[1:32:05] not put thee to death with the sword
[1:32:07] next
[1:32:08] verse now therefore hold him not
[1:32:12] Guiltless cuz I didn't buy that
[1:32:14] repentance that dried eyy confession
[1:32:16] didn't mean
[1:32:17] anything he just he was just trying to
[1:32:19] save his own tail cuz he knew he was
[1:32:21] wrong God doesn't forget these things
[1:32:24] that's right that's right for th they
[1:32:27] wise men because that's the first thing
[1:32:28] that Solomon prayed for when he stepped
[1:32:30] into his kingdom he said Lord I pray for
[1:32:32] wisdom to lead the people and knowest
[1:32:34] what thou ought to do unto him shimi but
[1:32:37] his whole head bring thou down to the
[1:32:40] Grave with
[1:32:42] blood so then we finally get
[1:32:44] to SEC First Kings where we just
[1:32:48] read and the King sent so First Kings
[1:32:51] chapter 2:36 and the King sent sent and
[1:32:54] called for shimi and said unto him build
[1:32:57] the a house in Jerusalem and dwell there
[1:32:59] cuz can you just
[1:33:00] imagine shimi he gets a call from
[1:33:04] Solomon he's like um I need to talk to
[1:33:06] you shimi is probably wondering like I'm
[1:33:08] wonder if his dad told him
[1:33:10] something so shimi shows
[1:33:13] up and he has a he has a an audience
[1:33:15] with the King King Solomon and the King
[1:33:18] said called fima said build thee house
[1:33:20] in
[1:33:22] Jerusalem andwell well there and go not
[1:33:26] forth H any
[1:33:28] wither talking about the Bible say when
[1:33:31] Paul says God who is rich in Mercy that
[1:33:34] is a very powerful
[1:33:36] statement because shimia should have
[1:33:38] died should have
[1:33:40] died and yet God is extending Grace unto
[1:33:45] him and so Solomon says look go and
[1:33:48] build yourself a
[1:33:50] house and he says build that house and
[1:33:53] he says you stay put in that house in
[1:33:55] Jerusalem and dwell there you stay in
[1:33:59] the presence of
[1:34:01] God if God planted you in this church
[1:34:04] you stay
[1:34:07] here the word that is being preached is
[1:34:10] specifically for you that's right
[1:34:13] specifically for you it's not for your
[1:34:17] brother it's not for your sister this
[1:34:20] word of God that's been preached is for
[1:34:22] you
[1:34:23] amen you alone are accountable for the
[1:34:26] word that you're
[1:34:29] hearing as long as you stay under that
[1:34:32] blood yeah then your sins will not call
[1:34:36] you
[1:34:40] out cuz we live in a world where people
[1:34:42] don't mind their business being out
[1:34:44] there but I know I've made some mistakes
[1:34:46] and I thank God for the blood of Jesus
[1:34:48] Christ am amen but if we were to replay
[1:34:51] some of the things that even as
[1:34:52] Christians that we struggle with many of
[1:34:55] us would just kind of just squirm in our
[1:34:59] seats but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:02] cover all sins amen amen amen and as
[1:35:05] long as shimi was in Jerusalem and dwelt
[1:35:08] there he was fine yes sir and when the
[1:35:11] king for for Shi the day that you leave
[1:35:14] and pass over the brook Kidron you know
[1:35:16] what Kidron means Kidron means it means
[1:35:19] Darkness turbulence great agitation
[1:35:23] great evil Valley of decision final
[1:35:29] judgment the moment you cross Into
[1:35:32] Darkness the moment you go into
[1:35:34] turbulence you will be agitated great
[1:35:39] agitation you will be confronted with
[1:35:42] great evil that's what Kidron mean go
[1:35:44] look it up in the
[1:35:46] Hebrew you stay away from that and you
[1:35:48] stay under that shed blood of the Lamb
[1:35:51] you stay under that anointed word but
[1:35:54] the moment you pass over this Brook
[1:35:56] you're in total
[1:35:58] darkness wow no compromise there's no
[1:36:02] middle ground there's no gray areas
[1:36:07] Lord and thou shall know certain that
[1:36:09] thou sh surely die thy blood shall be
[1:36:11] upon your own head and shimi said unto
[1:36:14] the king
[1:36:19] amen amen he dodged the bullet again
[1:36:21] he's like wooo I thought going to kill
[1:36:24] me but he's just giving me Grace you got
[1:36:26] it buddy praise the Lord what you say is
[1:36:28] nothing but the truth be careful that
[1:36:30] you don't live higher than what you say
[1:36:31] Amen
[1:36:32] to amen are we staying together amen cuz
[1:36:37] it's easy when we're together in company
[1:36:39] and we say
[1:36:41] Amen but does your amen extend to when
[1:36:43] you're out there in the world rubbing
[1:36:46] shoulders with the world do they see the
[1:36:48] same brother that I see in church do
[1:36:50] they see the same sister that I see in
[1:36:51] church or do they see somebody
[1:36:53] completely different amen it's all right
[1:36:55] it could be quiet but we still going to
[1:36:56] preach the gospel
[1:36:58] nonetheless Hallelujah cuz I don't want
[1:37:00] to just be a Son of God when I'm in this
[1:37:02] building in the company of sons of God I
[1:37:05] want to be a Son of God at work I want
[1:37:07] to be a Son of God at school I want to
[1:37:09] be a Son of God at the mall I want to be
[1:37:11] a Son of God in my car no matter where I
[1:37:13] am I'm a representation of Christ yes
[1:37:15] sir amen amen
[1:37:22] amen and so so shimia says the saying is
[1:37:28] good as my Lord the king said so what
[1:37:31] thy servant do and shimi dwelt in
[1:37:36] Jerusalem many
[1:37:39] days and things seems to be going well
[1:37:43] right and it came past after three years
[1:37:47] cuz here's the thing right this is the
[1:37:48] reason why it's important it came past
[1:37:50] after 3 years because we tend to forget
[1:37:53] the word that was originally preached to
[1:37:56] us we were excited the first time we
[1:37:59] heard it we said praise the Lord man
[1:38:02] that sounds really good after three
[1:38:04] years that Pastor come and preach the
[1:38:05] same message like well that sounds all
[1:38:07] right praise the Lord God is good God is
[1:38:10] good that steam that energy that
[1:38:14] excitement has DED a little
[1:38:17] bit maybe it's not as important as it
[1:38:20] was 3 years ago right the same word that
[1:38:23] was preached 3 years ago is just as
[1:38:26] important as it is now yes it is amen if
[1:38:29] you said amen to it the first time you
[1:38:32] can say Amen to it again TR amen God
[1:38:35] does not change his ways that's right am
[1:38:40] amen so shimi held on to what King
[1:38:44] Solomon
[1:38:46] said where the word of the king is there
[1:38:48] is
[1:38:50] power as long as you stay under this
[1:38:52] protected word this
[1:38:54] Blood you're fine Saints yes
[1:38:58] sir but the devil used two of his
[1:39:01] servants yes sir hello that ran away
[1:39:05] unto
[1:39:07] akish shimia didn't know anything about
[1:39:09] it he was just minding his own business
[1:39:10] like you know what God's good and
[1:39:11] everything's fine like got my house here
[1:39:13] somebody came up to shim shim what's
[1:39:15] going on two of your servants left what
[1:39:18] that became more of a distraction than
[1:39:20] the word of God where' they go they went
[1:39:22] to the kid they went over a kids run
[1:39:25] where they went over kids run
[1:39:29] yeah I'm I'm just putting myself in that
[1:39:32] place he he probably thought about it
[1:39:33] he's like Kidron would I Solomon did say
[1:39:36] if I cross over
[1:39:37] Kidron but like what a like I mean it's
[1:39:40] I mean I'm not going to stay there I'm
[1:39:41] just going to go there and just grab
[1:39:42] them and bring him back I mean that
[1:39:44] ain't going to be a problem right cuz I
[1:39:45] mean I went out and I came back like I
[1:39:48] came back I mean that that shouldn't be
[1:39:50] an issue right so he's thinking about it
[1:39:53] and he's all worked up because those are
[1:39:55] that's his servants so shimi got worded
[1:39:58] that his servants went into gath so he's
[1:40:00] thinking about he's like you know what
[1:40:02] if I go and come back let me tell you
[1:40:03] where God put you you stay there amen
[1:40:06] there's no tiptoeing outside and coming
[1:40:08] back amen God doesn't have like a a
[1:40:10] believer in the house and out of the
[1:40:11] house where God puts you that's where
[1:40:13] you
[1:40:15] belong let let me let me add another
[1:40:18] Point
[1:40:18] too this message this word is for you
[1:40:22] amen amen and only applies to
[1:40:26] you other people could be sitting in the
[1:40:29] same building with you and the word has
[1:40:32] no effect on
[1:40:34] them they could leave and come back as
[1:40:37] they may want to that's true without any
[1:40:40] sort of consequence but God spoke to
[1:40:43] you am for you there's a
[1:40:46] consequence you may look at other people
[1:40:48] I don't get why brother so so get to go
[1:40:50] out for a whole month and come back and
[1:40:52] there's no cons quences but the moment I
[1:40:54] put my feet out because God's dealing
[1:40:56] with
[1:40:57] you amen this might sound harsh but God
[1:41:00] doesn't beat other people's children
[1:41:01] that's right that's the truth
[1:41:04] brother God does not speak other
[1:41:06] people's children I don't want to be
[1:41:08] mean but listen to me now some of may
[1:41:10] have flexibility to go in and out they
[1:41:12] might be sitting under different
[1:41:14] leadership you're sitting under a
[1:41:16] different
[1:41:18] leadership yes sir
[1:41:21] amen wow I I mean
[1:41:24] when I was when I was young and I was in
[1:41:26] uh not not Walmart cuz we it was Kmart
[1:41:29] and I was with my dad and some kid
[1:41:30] acting up and you know just making a
[1:41:32] making a mess of themselves and I'm
[1:41:34] thinking to myself you know that child
[1:41:36] could get away with that they have a
[1:41:38] different set of
[1:41:40] parents that's right right that parent
[1:41:44] let them do what they want to do hello
[1:41:47] but I had a different set of dad I had a
[1:41:49] different dad that child would act up
[1:41:51] and I'm looking at I'm like Oh my
[1:41:52] goodness some of the things they would
[1:41:54] say to their parents and meanwhile I'm
[1:41:56] looking at my dad at the corner of my
[1:41:57] eyes and he's looking at me I'm like you
[1:41:58] know what I don't want to get in
[1:42:02] trouble my dad's looking at me at the
[1:42:04] corner of his eyes and the only thing I
[1:42:05] could think of saying you know um and
[1:42:07] this is the only thing that's coming to
[1:42:08] my mind uh you know father is such a
[1:42:11] beautiful day today
[1:42:13] today like you just didn't want to
[1:42:15] invite anything like I don't want you to
[1:42:17] think like I'm that
[1:42:19] child dad I understand your word for me
[1:42:22] I understand your expectations you can't
[1:42:25] do what the world does God has a
[1:42:27] different expectation for you yes sir
[1:42:30] amen that's right am just because
[1:42:33] someone else could get away with it
[1:42:34] doesn't mean you could get away with
[1:42:36] [Applause]
[1:42:38] it and if you see somebody going through
[1:42:40] a trial you let them alone like I said
[1:42:42] God could be working with them he could
[1:42:43] be giving them a good spanking getting
[1:42:45] back in
[1:42:48] order amen
[1:42:51] am this word is for
[1:42:54] you right not for anyone else it may not
[1:42:57] mean this Bible may not mean nothing to
[1:42:59] nobody else some message may not mean
[1:43:00] for no to nobody else but for you it
[1:43:03] means
[1:43:05] everything absolutely and they came to
[1:43:07] pass at the end of three years the two
[1:43:08] of the servants ran and shimia arose and
[1:43:12] saded his ass and went to gath he was so
[1:43:14] blinded by what he was trying to get he
[1:43:16] like this was mine yeah he ran away unto
[1:43:20] a Kish and the son of Micah king of gath
[1:43:22] and they told shimya saying Behold thy
[1:43:25] servants be in gath and shimya uh and it
[1:43:28] was told
[1:43:32] Solomon and it was told
[1:43:35] Solomon that shimi had gone from
[1:43:39] Jerusalem to
[1:43:41] gath and was come
[1:43:47] again the Bible is not written just
[1:43:50] haphazardly God's telling you like even
[1:43:52] when you came back yeah you should have
[1:43:54] never left in the first
[1:43:55] place
[1:43:58] right you should have never left in the
[1:44:00] first place this is shim laugh yeah he
[1:44:03] came
[1:44:04] back that didn't make a
[1:44:07] difference my God it's like God looking
[1:44:08] at you like he did what go get him for
[1:44:11] me real
[1:44:12] quickly but let me tell you when God
[1:44:14] when God deals with us it might be harsh
[1:44:16] but it it remember what the prophet says
[1:44:18] he says when when the lamb when when the
[1:44:20] Sheep is out of order and he's kind of
[1:44:22] drifting what does he do he breaks his
[1:44:23] leg now you think that's cruel but the
[1:44:26] prophet also says that same sheep comes
[1:44:28] to the shepherd and wants to be caressed
[1:44:30] and wants to be ner nurtured and be
[1:44:32] healed and that's what God does he
[1:44:34] breaks you up sometimes spanks you and
[1:44:36] just puts you in order so that way you
[1:44:38] can come back to him cuz the Bible says
[1:44:41] he will not lose not one not
[1:44:44] one that the father has given unto
[1:44:49] me I'm wrapping it
[1:44:51] up and the King s and called for shimi
[1:44:54] and said did I not make thee to swear by
[1:44:57] the Lord and protested unto thee saying
[1:45:00] no for certain on the day thou goest out
[1:45:04] and walst abroad where the thou shall
[1:45:06] surely die and thou sth unto me Thy word
[1:45:12] that I have heard is
[1:45:15] good we all said amen to the word that
[1:45:17] we heard today you said amen to the
[1:45:20] preaching that you heard last week you
[1:45:22] heard you say Amen to the preaching that
[1:45:24] you heard the week before yes sir hold
[1:45:26] on to that word amen amen if you agree
[1:45:29] that it's true and you say Amen live for
[1:45:31] it yes sir if this gospel is worth dying
[1:45:34] for then this gospel is worth living for
[1:45:37] yes
[1:45:41] sir as we stand to our
[1:45:44] feet the king said M to
[1:45:47] shimi now listen to
[1:45:50] this the king now at this point when he
[1:45:54] first met three years ago when he first
[1:45:56] met shimi he never said what his he
[1:45:59] never said what his dad
[1:46:01] said because that was under the
[1:46:04] blood he says you stay in
[1:46:08] Jerusalem but the moment you leave that
[1:46:10] place then everything will come back to
[1:46:12] you and so here it is thou knowest all
[1:46:14] the wickedness which thine heart is
[1:46:17] privy to that thou didst to David my
[1:46:21] father therefore the Lord Lord shall
[1:46:23] return the wickedness upon thine own
[1:46:29] head if I could admonish you on anything
[1:46:33] stay under the protected
[1:46:37] blood stay under that protected
[1:46:41] word there's no greater salvation than
[1:46:44] to be found in the presence of God where
[1:46:47] the power of the king where the word of
[1:46:49] the king is there is power amen and so
[1:46:53] shimi we we just walk through his life
[1:46:56] in his journey and there he was in
[1:47:00] Jerusalem but he let something that was
[1:47:03] of no value of no importance it was not
[1:47:06] greater than the word that Solomon spoke
[1:47:08] there's nothing greater than What God
[1:47:10] Says to you that would cause you to
[1:47:12] leave this
[1:47:14] word if you said amen to it and you
[1:47:16] agreed to it the first time to here you
[1:47:18] are sting standing now you can say Amen
[1:47:21] to it again sir sir and if the Lord sh
[1:47:24] ter for another many years you could
[1:47:26] still say Amen to the word of
[1:47:30] God and King Solomon shall be blessed
[1:47:34] and the Throne of David shall be
[1:47:36] established before the Lord forever so
[1:47:39] the king commanded bayah the son of jei
[1:47:43] which went out and fell upon him that he
[1:47:48] died
[1:47:51] Saints the word of God is
[1:47:54] pure the word of God is

[1:48:01] what when God bless you be still and

[1:48:43] with
[1:48:44] criticism and

[1:55:47] Satan when he fell God didn't go running
[1:55:50] after him but when you fell God came
[1:55:54] running after you he was so reckless
