her birthday on tomorrow happy birthday sister jessica my god should get younger every year amen we thank god for sister jessica amen one of a kind amen we thank god for um just want to just mention so uh this this wednesday we'll still be doing amen our live stream on periscope and virtual service that we do on wednesday but come the first wednesday of september we are reopening the church for saints that want to come on wednesday nights we're going to still encourage that we do social distancing and and uh you know bring your mask and all those things amen i think that's still important as we we we reopen god has been good to us we have not had any outbreaks a man during this time we've been meeting ever since um the week before easter which would be um palm sunday uh the lord has been allowing us to to meet and uh just um you know actually before we do anything you know it's the according to the um the structure of the church the deacon assists the pastor in all the spiritual matters so uh often i mean every time before we actually do anything i have a conversation with brother troy as our deacon you know we we talk together just to kind of see okay what what's the next step so i appreciate amen having a deacon that i can go to and just kind of talk to and and uh and you know so we we agree on things amen before we actually do things right and uh so this this whole time and just just the direction that we've gone i believe god's been good to us amen in the midst of it and we thank god but we knew that the ultimate thing was not for us to remain divided amen at some point in time we would have to start working our way back together uh this is not going back to an old normal uh there is a new normal that we're all setting amen to this this this pandemic is something that i don't feel is just going to go away overnight amen we're going to be dealing with this for a while uh and i mean they don't really have a solution they don't have a solution i think we're looking for them to come up with one and and everybody you know got all kind of things but a lot of money being made with some of the solutions right and uh and i can't say i'm gonna be the first one to sign up for some things i'm gonna just have to wait i trust the word of god right uh but uh but you know but the thing is we still have to navigate during these times so we will be we'll be coming back amen uh on wednesday nights not this wins but the first wednesday of of the month of september we will start allowing everybody to come back into the house of lord those that can make it on wednesday nights on sundays amen starting next sunday amen we will no longer have a 9 a.m service and a 12 p.m service we will go back to our 10 30 service and everybody is welcome to attend amen the 10 30 service amen the church will be coming back together now uh in the midst of that though as we all come back together i want to stress the importance of all of us using our mass amen it's very important we don't want an outbreak amen so as we bring everybody back together i want to ask that let's all be very diligent about using our mass sometimes the mass a man is not just for you but it's to to to help protect others uh so and i know it's very uncomfortable i'm the first one that would say it's uncomfortable but try to find a mass that is comfortable as we come back i don't i just want us to do everything we can to prevent any outbreaks in our midst we're going to still be washing hands when we enter the sanctuary uh we check temperatures when we empty into the sanctuary and the other thing that'll happen is that uh the um uh the ushers and and brother troy deacon they're gonna make sure that people are sitting together as families amen we'll kind of put family units together we're still trying to keep uh six feet of distances so we'll have to maybe have the families kind of squeeze in so that we can get somebody else maybe on the road behind you a six foot distance apart but we got a little strategy that we're going to try to use to make sure that we keep the six foot distance there might be some people asked to use the front row somebody gonna have to sit on the front row i know that sometimes like oh that's too close to the pulpit but no we're gonna need somebody amen on the front row and and brother troy amen and he'll be working with the ushers they will set up who that is so the first thing i'm gonna ask everyone in this time of transition if the ushers or uh uh ask you to do something typically they're they're you know we've already talked about what we want everybody to do so if they ask you to do something i want you to take the chick-fil-a attitude my pleasure praise the lord they actually do something yes it's my pleasure we need to work through this together amen we need to work through this together so i know some of y'all got your favorite seats we may have to disrupt that for the time being in order to be able to bring everybody back together so please bear with us please work with us amen because uh i think it's going to be a real blessing god is on the other end of this and i think one of the things god got in store for us is a new church a new school and and as we go into that new church i want us all to be able to go together and rejoice together right now well nine o'clock service and twelve no no everybody together all of us been waiting on this time and and god following them did something for us and we're gonna rejoice together we're gonna shout together if we have to shout with a mass we'll shout with a mass praise the lord amen but uh but we we just we just want to try to bring everyone together and we want to do it slowly we want to do it uh in a way that everyone um uh is very comfortable and and so i'm just gonna ask and just reiterate everyone please be sensitive amen uh to what we're trying to do and and just take the my pleasure attitude amen we really appreciate that um outreach we started on um um last last week we we did our first outreach and i think we had about 24 boxes of food that we were able to give out and and this outreach has been shut down for uh quite some time and and uh so people didn't know that was reopened but when they saw us there different ones was coming and calling their friends and family members to come and get food uh but we we realized it's probably gonna grow it's gonna be a lot more people coming and uh you know i was very grateful for those that showed up and anybody else that would like to be involved we certainly welcome you i will tell you you're going to sweat a little bit if you want to lose some weight come on to the outreach amen you're going to lose some weight amen but but it was a real wonderful opportunity we had to just uh just just just share food and as we as we get our cells in ingrained in that community is going to go from natural food to spiritual food amen i believe that i believe that so if you desire to be involved please reach out to me or also sister tina you can reach out to her and we'll make sure that you uh you you you're aware of everything that is going on we uh we agreed uh with this outreach they were doing it on wednesday but we told them say we if we take it over we can't do it on wednesdays we got to do it on thursdays and uh so they asked us if we would just finish out this month on wednesday so last wednesday we tried to do it but it rained so god blocked it we went on thursday and uh so so this week we're supposed to still show up for wednesday and uh and uh if you can show up on this wednesday that'll be great uh uh but this will be the last wednesday to be done from now on it'll be thursdays that we'll be going out amen to do the outreach so keep that in mind praise the lord all right so also just uh in regards to our giving those that are watching online you do have the opportunity to give online uh we have two ways that you can give one

is good praise be to god what it's like what better brother brother but a joke preached this morning kind of maybe my message ties into his message or he starts into my message the lord knows everything amen praise be to god i want us to a friend of mine she was a co-worker in san antonio texas she's a very strong believer in the word of the lord her husband caught kobe 19. and she stood in she was so gallant praying even when the doctors were saying she was going to die she stood in for the husband but this morning 5 am the husband went to be with the lord and this ready happens to be the they have three daughters uh emerald crystal and diamond today happens to be crystal's birthday and that is really tough so i wonder if you know my list i will cover the jack to share with our prayer for the family or to his family god bless you amen yes let's just sparrow in a word of prayer man father we're here in florida this family there god in texas i believe and god a husband has been called home and we realize that you don't make mistakes and the lord is yes it might be related to covet but we know that you have a perfect plan and god is very unfortunate from our standpoint we look at a father being called home on the day of his daughter's birthday lord howe that would certainly um be a challenge to the child as they go through the years but some how some way god bring victory through this situation give encouragement to this family give strength to them lord and we just ask that you would help them lord during this time that you you would turn their mourning into dancing we know heaven uh rejoices when a believer is coming home like that they're absent from the body but present with the lord and god the family we know that they'll feel the effects of this but god we just actually would carry them may this be that time in their life when they look down in the sands and they see one set of footprints but be reminded that this is also a time that you're carrying them and they're still making progress amen so father we just exit you would be with them comfort them strengthen them help them meet every need that they would have lord during this time and help the wife help the daughters lord just be with them god in the only way that you can we commit them into your capable hands fathers in jesus christ's name that we pray amen amen gloria bless you god bless you thank you amen praise be to god this morning we want to talk about from our brokenness into masterpiece amen how the lord tends our brokenness into masterpiece so if you want to title it we can put it transformation from brokenness into masterpiece i mean transforming from brokenness into masterpiece and i have a bunch of scriptures but i would like to read let's read it uh some if you don't mind let's take our bible and then read some 20 22 first there's a couple of scriptures from psalm 22. verse 1 and 2. some 22 verse 1 and 2. david was prophesying but it was actually jesus christ speaking through david amen david was a prophet king and a prophet king and priest he had all the attributes and the lord used david in mighty different way and in psalm 22 verse 1 and 2 they will begin to cry my god my god why has thou forsaken me why are thou so far from helping me and from the worst of my rolling oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou hear us not and in the night season i'm not silent amen shall we be seated father we pray lord add blessing to the reading of your word in jesus christ's name amen so david was talking about crying unto the lord yes and a lot kind of as forsaking him and it was david was typing jesus christ coming to die the son of god the lamp of god coming to die for us in our broken estate and he was crying on the cross as we know that heaven rejected him the earth has had done with him the earth couldn't contain him anymore more and heaven couldn't accept him because he carried your sin and my sin right our burdens was laid upon him and so both heaven and earth rejected him he became a curse for us so that was forsaken psalm 22 was forsaken when he was approaching death forsaken to die when you read psalm 23 psalm 23 is death itself burial and then let's see what where it leads to so we want to read a couple of scriptures from psalm 23 i know it's our favorite song that we all have to read it but then if you read from uh let's start from verse one up to four somewhere psalm 23 verse one 2 4 so the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restore his story he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake verse four is where i want us to take note it's a year though i walk through the valley of shadow of death right i will fear no evil for that with me thyroid and thy staff they comfort me amen so now david was talking about death in the shadow of death death has already taken place buried in in the shadow but then even that in death not evil when the lord died he was in three dimension he was not a dimension to begin with when he died his physical flesh was still on the cross like a dead complete dead man he died like a man but then he was almighty god his soul went to hell the place of rejection his spirit was still in the throne of god ruling the universe amen when he died the devil was happy if i would put in in our modern term there was a party with all the demons finally i've got a word in my hands praise god he doesn't praise god anyway but if the devil praises god you say praise god hallelujah of course the god is dead so i'm the one in charge the whole new universe is under my control and lo and behold the person was there appeared to satan to lucifer to the devil he took the kill of death from him and all the people that is held captive in death their lord releases them or their predecessor sons of god from adam to the last one at the time of jesus who were laying dead who are being kept in captivity by the devil the lord releases them because he is the king of kings and he brought them up from that dimension and the same woman the same god was ruling on the throne of heaven the sixth dimension controlling the universe because the devil came to kill to steal and to destroy but jesus christ came to give life and give it abundantly so if the lord is not in control the devil could have devastated the whole planet but the lord was still in control so even when he died the sea would also come all the way from wherever it came from when you get to the seashore that was a terminating point turning point it would still turn around and go back to where it comes from and the lord can permit certain situation in your life permit the enemy to go all the way so far when you read that point the turning point the lord has put it black sit and stop right amen this is where you can come so far you can go beyond amen because the lord is in control of your life so psalm 23 was talking about death and being buried and let's see psalm 24 that's when resurrection takes place there is joy the third when jesus christ resurrected when there is a third pool in your life your situation when the lord comes out and take over your situation amen so let's read a couple of scriptures from psalm 24. psalm 24 verse 7 let's read up to hopefully the 10th verse psalm 24 verse 7 to 10. he said lift up your heads oh ye gates and bill and be here lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in now the king who died who was forsaken to die psalm 23 he really died and buried then psalm 24 now he's resurrected the first day of the of the week sunday the lord has resurrected that's why we show up in church on sunday because the lord resurrected on on the first day which is sunday so in the under the new testament and under the grace and the love of god sunday is the day that we honor the lord we honor god all the days but sundays especially that we give we commit all our time to the lord amen has not been the term that we live in when it's sunday evenings shops don't don't open that's right it used to be in the united states some years ago probably not too far maybe 70 plus or certain times certain shops were not even open that's right because sunday is a day of what recogni recognizing or reckoning the the resurrection of jesus christ amen so psalm 24 7 to 10. as we read the first verse he said who is this king of glory the lord of the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts is the king of glory salah amen so the lord is the king of glory in every situation amen it doesn't matter how the situation is he'll permit a situation to die you might be seem to be forsaken you might go through death we go through death in different forms death is not just only when a person dies physically but we go through pulse and we die daily right we die from one ministry to another we die from one growth onto another higher stage of growth we die from one experience one to another experience we die from one situation to another situation we die from poverty to riches we die from sin untoward righteousness of god we die from the brokenness into masterpieces of the living christ so death comes in different ways amen glory hallelujah so let's we want to take a couple of maybe about 12 instances where the lord used brokenness to lift people who were broken or situations that were broken onto masterpieces glory hallelujah amen so the lord can lift your brokenness into masterpiece when you are strong when you think you can do something that's when you are nothing when moses thought he was something he was the next pharaoh he had all the powers of egypt put yourself in the situation he had all the power of the united states behind him and that was how powerful moses was he was a doctor in those times they didn't specialize in one area he was a lawyer a doctor he knew the art and craft right the secret of medicine he knows all the all the wisdom of the egyptians because in those times for you to become a pharaoh you have to go to saudi baby school you have to go to harvard or yale or oxford to learn not only law but learn their law medicine pharmacy business languages all of them before you can sit on the throne so moses was smart guys smartest of the smart he was real intelligent and so he figured out that yes i know i'm a deliverer my mom taught me to be a deliverer taught me that i was a deliverer it was put in me but it was here amen it doesn't come here yet so moses went in his power and his might and young man what did he do he killed a person so he just qualified himself he ran away to egypt uh sorry to the desert to uh forgotten the land but he ran away from egypt because he was wanted in egypt and he got himself the lord gave him a wife maybe he didn't know the lord gave it to him but the lord gave him an egyptian sorry ethiopian woman a black person he got married to her he became a shepherd taking care of his father's in-lawship right forgotten about being a deliverer because now he fought himself broken he was out of the way so he was thinking maybe the lord would use aeron he would use joshua he used somebody else to do the job so he was happily comfortable with his wife and raising children and doing what everybody else would do amen that's what we know as human beings to do get your comfortable zone get what you enjoy get your house get your job get your business get your family but the lord has has his own mind amen and the lord in his own time came down in the situation of moses when he was broken when he was 80 years old that's when the lord commanded him that moses go i command you to go and take my people from uh from egypt and send them to the promised land and a lot the most was not lord i think probably i'm not the right person you are talking to you know i've got a criminal record in egypt all right i can't go to egypt when i go there they're going to arrest me i'm wanted man how am i going to go to egypt maybe you can send joshua you can send iran you can send get somebody get caleb get somebody to do the job the lord you know i can't talk you know but the law said you are the one i'm going to send when a man disqualifies you that's when the lord qualifies you when you disqualify yourself that is when god qualifies you hallelujah amen people that see themselves unqualified in the kingdom of god they are the one the lord has qualified them before the foundation of the world people who think they don't even deserve to be in heaven look at the in the when jesus died on their cross there was a man on the cross with jesus who said lord when you get to the kingdom remember me because he did himself he saw himself as a criminal he wasn't worthy of eternal life but from the death of his heart he said lord just remember me you know my situation you don't deserve to die but i deserve i was a criminal i did what i did and i deserve to be crucified but you don't deserve it and that man had eternal life right there amen so when you think you can do it when you think your situation is hopeless that's when the lord comes in scoop you up from the situation and bring you out and glorify his name amen the lord gave us a three great covenants or testament that he used to to to show his attribute to mankind the first testament he showed to the first person he created was the testament of law which is adam adams situation god gave them covenant testament sacrament to keep and that sacrament was if you do this i will do this if you don't do this i won't do this so it's conditional right don't touch the tree which is in the midst of the garden the day you touch it you will die that's right i'll kill you that is what he meant to them because he had the power of death and power of life so if you touch this i'll kill you if you don't touch it you live forever right and one thing about human being is that when you tell a human being not to touch something you get curious and you see it in children if you tell your child that hey this stuff will bring you his heart you can't even explain to the daughter your kids that don't don't go around the stuff you can play here you've got all your toys here have fun here this will bring you it's only for mom and dad to tie the stove to cook your food for you when you are there they won't touch it but when you are in the bedroom when you are there they will now they will sneak in and see what is this go and find out try to because they see that their mom twisting their stove you know plugging so what is that even things that they can't reach they will put us through that and sit up on it stand up on it and try to get what is in the drawer because it's the nature of man to find out what is it that he doesn't want you to touch what is in there that doesn't want you to touch i want to touch it so the lord gave them that covenant that do not touch the tree numbers of the garden right away there was curiosity about this tree right adam and eve was wondering and of course the woman was the first one who tied a tree and brought it to the husband you know the story it was what a sex act that's right amen the tree in the middle of the garden the human being the bible use languages in shadows and in types the tree is not just it's not a physical tree it's not an apple it's not a it's not a mango it's not a purple tree it's not a cocoa tree it's not a mahogany tree it's not a pine tree but the human being is a tree if you read someone right the tree human being is type as a tree right so the tree in the midst of the garden is the sex organ in the midst of the garden and the lord had a time and a and season but man went ahead of himself to do what he did and when he did it brought death onto all mankind that was the law so man proved himself that man cannot live by law so the lord has to come in with god grace because man over the years from uh adam to moses we're gonna go to some scriptures man just can't keep lost that's right if you tell man not to go uh go the speed limit is 60 miles per hour he's going to make 90. boom goddess my god why did they put this uh odometer or the some call it speedometer why did they put their water 220 and i can't even do 90. i can't do hundred i can't do 70. boom i've got a sports car room and it's just flying all over that's right because man cannot keep law it's not in the nature of man to keep law so the lord the lord allowed the lord to rule on earth for man to experience for man to break the laws for man to go over to realize that you know lord we cannot keep your law we need something else and the law says okay i'll give you grace amen because all of our time from adam who was created perfect moses wasn't perfect moses was born through sex but adam and eve were not born like you and i right the lord created adam he wasn't a baby he came around like a 30 year old person with muscles yes does that we add them he came from the theophany right away that's right to the flesh that's right and adam could speak adam could create right adam could do the things because the bible said adam named a creation of god what name did he give him a josue morales no that wasn't the name there's an attribute there's a nature that adam saw in the theophanic dimension right and you could see that i can't put a lion's nature in a lamp it's not gonna work so he has to pull that that dimension pull the nature of lion from the sixth dimension into it into the um the ethylene uh what they call it earthly lion that has been created he said that he couldn't put the nature of a rabbit into into a turtle it's not going to work so adam has to put turtle from the 6th dimension and put that spirit in the turtle on earth rabbit from the 6th dimension to a rabbit on earth because those natures are not the same thing amen glory hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen like i never just said he's an action person i traveled with him to mexico he's just like he's that's his nature he'll make it happen right away that is nature but amanda is a little bit reserved it's a little bit on the reserve side and the lord put compliment put people together to complement each other one is an action it's just going one is a reserve one is somewhere one is even your children mothers and parents you can see from your children some of the children are quiet some of them are action people some of them are this they are different some of them are introvert some are extrovert some are loud some are quiet some are different a lot made people differently for his glory amen so the lord made us that way for the glory of his name blessed be the name of the lord so we were not made to keep lost because in our nature we want to do what is in us so the law hinders you do not do this and it becomes a problem so you have to adjust yourself to it and being a man being a woman you can't do that so we break loss that state god gave it to us so the lord brought the love from adam up to moses they experience it and i'll go through there we take about 12 of them i want to let a little background now the lord brought grace from the when the lord jesus christ came the law of moses was ruling but then jesus christ brought grace there was a woman that was caught in adultery and the law said that this man has to be stoned that is the law that lord didn't come from from it came from the almighty god to moses to the people and that is what they had in their scriptures that's the secret they have like a screw they have it like a parchment that they tend it's not like we are a paper bible it was a parchment that they they tend and read from so the parchment say that hey if you commit adultery and you are caught if you are not caught things i mean you are lacking but if you get caught in the act we need to stone you that is the law of moses right and jesus came and he was changing the law and they didn't understand him this one was caught in adultery and we need to stone we need to stone her and you are saying that richard in stonehenge what are you talking about they've got their stones in their hands they've got to pray when a lion gets its victim it's happy the devil has got his victim they as long as they were not caught they were sinless but this woman has been caught right in there they didn't even allow her to dress up they brought a naked just to make sure that we caught an adultery and jesus began to rise something on the ground wrote her pardon first and wrote their sin the adultery they committed that night begin to write them on the underground and the soil so when you look at your sin oh wow your name and your what you did i leave that soon and went away and this guy would look at this his sin you committed adultery you killed you stood last night you look at him names still last night he left it soon and went away and one after the other all the macho man strong man was turned ready to stone this lady threw the arson away and they went so when jesus finished writing he turned around and everyone was standing where are their accuses where are they those who are the enforcers who enforce the law said all of them are gone he said neither do i what not nor do i free you you are free i do not condemn you go and sin no more praise god hallelujah it's not different from what the jail preached this morning there are things that we did in the flesh things that our fathers did the lord forgive you but teach your children not to do it no more because the lord he has brought another another covenant for greece amen because man couldn't hold the law the law was way beyond what man could contain so the lord has to bring in another covenant a testament a sacrament that is more easy for man to hold amen so in his grace he'll set his woman free blessed be the name of the lord glory hallelujah to the lord amen praise be to god and the lord when you read psalms he said a table i didn't read all of them but he said the lord a table has now prepared for me the lord set a table before david in the presence of his presence of his enemies what table if you put in a natural table what we put on table in home food the lord put food put a uh things that nourishment on the table we go to starting homes there's always something in the basket on the table maybe oranges some fruits banana so even if you come home there's no meal you can just i mean grass one banana and eat as you wait for your meal so table is always to what to symbolize presence of food and the lord put a table in you that table is the celestial body is the word man is the theophany is the holy ghost is the image the seed of god that was in you before the foundation of the world and out of that table emanates life emanates voices voices that steer you around along the right path amen as you go through life you're gonna hear voices when a person begin to grow up a certain age when you get a certain age there will be so many voices talking to you when you get to maybe teenage age let's say 14 12 15 go in voices will be telling you from high school from primary school that do this they even teach you in school certain things that you're not supposed to do they teach you in school even now it's even worse than it used to be they teach you i mean your friends will teach you how to get a boyfriend they even more girls who are virgins when they are in school so you sell a virgin come on what's wrong with you go get yourself a boyfriend so it's a shame unquote to be a virgin it's a shame to keep yourself sacred unto the lord he will be teasing you that what you are virgin come on what's wrong with you you haven't seen a man before you haven't seen a woman before but that is the will of the lord but the world has turned it around that the things that the lord respect the lord large from us it's rather a sin before before men that's why the bible said that the word the things of the world is what is foolishness to god and the things of god is also foolishness to the world and you can't have both of them amen you can have the world and have christ you have to give up one and get the other amen if you want to be with the world enjoy the world and die in sin i mean that's the path you want to choose go that route the consequence is there if you want to give all your heart to the lord then give all your heart to the lord the lord will reward you and bless you amen god bless you rajab for your same one praise be to god so the lord has set a table before us that we can feed from the table is the word of the lord that table is in you even before you heard the first preacher there's something in your voice that speak to you my daughter my son don't listen to this don't go this route this will not help you but a man has doesn't cannot keep the law until the new birth comes in the control tower takes over a man will go over this small voice and break the loss of of himself the loss of himself that the lord has planted in you before the foundation of the world the lord has put certain sensitive sensitivity around every son and every daughter of of god there's something about you that you know it every son of god before even you had the first preacher before your mom taught you the first sunday school lesson there's something in you there's a voice there's the inner man there's eternal connection that even in our sinful estate that inner connection was there that speak to your question when you do this just like a child what is going to tie the fire you know the stove is not allowed to touch it but because that mom is not around it just goes sneaky and it's looking around that is not here do his stuff let him get some coins and go and get candy you go to your drawer get some coins and get i mean go get your candy if the family is large who took my coins no say spanish winners i don't know who took it who took my coin i don't know maybe my brothers maybe my sisters so you push the blame on blame on other people and that's the nature of man but when that the control tower takes place you don't have to leave the law the life in you lives itself in you the holy ghost in you takes over so the lord said that i'm not going to write my loss on tablets on on on on tables anymore i'm not going to write them on stones and parchment but i'm going to write my laws in your very heart because when the loss is in your heart the law himself that the law which is the love of christ the grace of god leaves himself out amen listen we've got about different shade of people around here amen some are black summer hispanic some are different now if what about the lord let's take a scenario the lord said okay i'm going to give you amount of food certain amount of proteins and vitamins and what else minerals and carbohydrates and all the other nutrients to eat to get the color that you want color that you are so if you are black you have to eat this amount of carbohydrates else you're going to turn into white or you're going to turn into a albino right or albino whatever you call it if we are hispanic and you don't eat the right food you turn up being a japanese your eye slit is going to be like a chinese so now do you want how are you going to do that we're going to be changing from one race to another because you end up eating the wrong proportion of nutrients and today you are japanese that is that you are chinese that means that you are hispanic you are white you are indian what are you going to be you don't have to take chat a lot has put that in you so as long as you eat your food you grow yourself you don't have to think about how to grow my hair to be to be to be black or to be blonde or to be yellow the lord has ordained everything for you yours is you eat the food as long as you eat food you're gonna grow your dark skin you're gonna grow your brown skin your white skin whatever as long as you eat the word of the lord you don't have to struggle no more the struggle days to be over the word himself the word is life and the word himself will leave himself out blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen the lord is good let's quickly go to 12 let me finish the background now so the lord through came and established grace and greece went on paul took over when the lord finished the ministry peter preached and paul came over and expanded the grace of god onto through the to the edges he was the first church age and pulled himself from his life just like moses paul was also a partial madra moses is physically killed but paul medraku in the court of law you can call it agent and albertan he didn't really take a stone or take a sword and killed like moses did but then when they were killing stephen he was aiding an albertan because in his mind stephen was what was i disobeying the love of god the law of moses so this man this christian so-called were not obeying the written laws of moses so when they were killing stoning stephen saw was holding the garments you know those times they have like the outer garment like you see that the jacket and the and the shed and so forth so they have a rope the outer garment and the inner garment so the outer garment is kind of thick so they have to he was holding the outer garment of the people that were stoning stephen so that they can really do their job because the altar government made them heavy so paul said that he said i'm not even worthy to be called to be called an apostle right because i what he partook in killing of stephen he persecuted a christian he was actually on his way to persecute christians when the lord the pill of fire met him jesus christ met him amen and he said so so why do you persecute me say who are you he knows that that was a pill of fire but he didn't know the pillar of father that appeared to moses has become jesus christ and he didn't know that the pillar father was in jesus christ has become stephen and the christians that he was persecuting amen so the same pillar of fire that was in jesus of nazareth 200 2 000 plus years is in you if you have the holy ghost so you are the jesuses of the of the modern day amen you are the modern day sins that's why we call you sins we are not catholics amen we are not dead sins but we are living sins because the lord jesus christ is dwelling in your temple manifesting himself amen glory hallelujah so that was where the lord used grace then the lord brought if you look at all these people moses the lord called him to the back side of the desert to give him the testament of law paul the lord called him to arabian desert to give him the testament of greece abraham william abraham the lord called him to arizona sunset mountain to give him the testament of love amen so all these three were typing now that they were tapping but they were bringing their three attributes law grace and love it doesn't mean that when there was lord there was no it doesn't mean that when there was the law there was no grace at all there was no love at all but the dominant attribute was the law it also doesn't mean that when there was greece or like uh but yeah oh i have greece i can do whatever i want i can kick this speaker there's greece i can kick my brother hey but i was three i can punch you in the face the grace of god covers me that's great i can beat my sisters up you can beat your wife that's the grace of god you know you can get yourself seven other women if your wife doesn't know how to cook because i'm under grace i can leave my husband and go get me the next husband if my husband is poor and broke that's the grace of god glory hallelujah that's the grace is that the grace no that's grace 10 disgrace amen that's not the grace of god so it doesn't mean that when there's grace the law of god is not there but the lord has given you the grace that the law can be lived from inside out amen whereas we are struggling now the old person that were attempting you to sin to get to go against the law of god has been killed and anna halletted and christ himself is living himself his law from within out amen that's why the paul said that the life that i live is no longer the soul of tassels but christ in me he's living himself by his grace amen so we can call paul an apostle of grace amen he didn't have any qualification he said things even that he learned under gamaliel he was also a doctor a lawyer a philosopher like moses but he said i counted as what as damn it was a trash i have to throw to the trash can it's a garbage there's nothing i could do with it the lord didn't need any of my education he didn't need any of my intellect he just needed my heart surrender your heart to the lord amen the lord is not looking for anything from you you give him your heart and when you give him your heart everything will fall in place for you glory hallelujah to the lord if you give the lord all the offering all the money you want and you don't give your heart to him it's not a blessing if a man loves his a man buy all the fancy footage for his wife buy him multi-billion houses take her to all the vacations and what else buy ships buy jet flight for their wife and she doesn't love their wife she beat their wife at home she's very cruel and and very wicked to their wife then that is not love if a woman claims she's not a husband and she doesn't even cook for the husband she doesn't reach children for her husband she doesn't respect the husband she just like abuses the husband that is not love that is no love but the life is what things that come from the heart amen the hard face because god doesn't need your money god can rent money from heaven yes we need money god uses our money to do the things of god things of the house but the lord need your heart first when you give him your heart everything will fall in place amen so that is the love of christ glory hallelujah now let's take a 12 instances if time will parameters where the lord shows how he uses our brokenness transform my brokenness your brokenness into his masterpiece let's look at genesis chapter 3 verse 22 to 24. that talks about how the lord uses the broken relationship of man to bring him to a mystery of salvation and grace that mankind has known before so through the broken broken relationship between adam eve and god the lord used that one to show him to show them salvation because they until then they didn't understand what is salvation they were perfect let's so let's read genesis 20 genesis 3 22-24 and the lord god said on said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now let us let's now let's he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and he live for he live forever 23 therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherry beams and flaming sword which turned everywhere to keep the way of the tree of life so man has partaken the partaking he has become partaker of the tree of death and man knows also to take particular tree of life but the lord wants to show man mankind his grace and salvation so he put man out of fellowship man is this fellowship just like a prodigal son when the particular son even disfellowshipped himself from the father's house he returned and the lord showed him grace and he understood what his grace so mankind before until therefore adam didn't know what is salvation because they were perfect adam didn't have to grow from being a baby eve wasn't a baby he was around 16 to 18. adam was around 30. they didn't know what is even son but when they fought him and adam saw that his power was diminishing the power that he heard he could speak he could create those powers were domination the lion could back a team and begin to roll you're going to say there's something wrong this is the first time i could see a lion trying to pounce on a lamp and he could feel from himself that the power the authority is going down and it's going down and it's going down it begins to age we're going to get gray head and say no that's not what i used to be i used to be like just like always 30 but now i look like what am i what do i look like adam was created as a spoken word but then when he conceived with eve if if billy began to swell she was called mrs adam but then she her name was changed to become mother of all if billy was getting bigger i said what's going on here this is strange you have never seen this before my god what is going on here if you begin to feel pace in pregnancy this is weird what is going on here did didn't know what's going on here and things became his belly getting bigger nine months it may be dropped wow i've never seen anything like this before what's going on here and the grace of god was with them the lord was showing them the lord adam was a prophet and the lord was using him to show his wife you know because adam fell on purpose just to save the wife because the bible said that i don't know what he was doing the one was deceived but adam knew that if he doesn't save their wife the lord was going to destroy the wife just like abraham so adam has to forward his wife if someone drowns in a river and you want to bring him up you can't stand at the bank of the river and pull him from under the river if you know how to swim you just have to dive in deep and bring the person out of the river get the water out of him and that's what adam did amen adam said if i fall with my wife the lord will redeem all of us because the wife was part of him and he was part of christ just like the church is part of jesus and jesus christ amen so even through the broken relationship the lord ushered on earth into mankind fellowship of salvation and grace because until then they didn't know what is grace but the lord had more attribute than perfection they were living in perfect perfect estate but the lord has to allow we know what happened therefore to come in and then the devil came in and the lord showed the devil that they are still my children amen there's no way i'm going to let them go it doesn't it doesn't matter how my daughter my son is far gone i'm just going to hold her in my heart i'm just going to pray for my my children and i know my god who delivered me will deliver them amen glory hallelujah let's go to um exodus chapter 32 verse 1 to 8 the broken laws of god god gave his laws to mankind but man couldn't hold the loss of god exodus 32 1-8 i think i'll read just verse seven and eight for the sake of time exodus 32 7-8 and the lord said unto moses go get thee down go go the go get thee down for thy people which thou brought us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they say they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed their own to and said this by the god by thy gas or israel which have brought thee out of the land of egypt now these are the people the lord delivered from egypt when they were under bondage and when moses was sent to go and get the law moses turret in other words moses is delayed just like but a jack preached a couple of sundays ago about when saw probably three sundays ago when uh samuel odin or commander sought to go and wait for the sacrifice saul was history he couldn't wait he was he was just like because of the people the pressure on the people he came into the people's pressure and he went to sacrifice which was not ordained for a king to do the king was a king the priest and the prophet do the sacrifice and so because he went ahead of god i went ahead of samson he was disqualified he was put away from being he wasn't as qualified i was put away from being a king and david took his his mantle took his place so patience is a great virtue and so man couldn't wait moses probably said for this man if you read from verse one he said for this man moses we don't know what has become of him we got to get something in worship yes he brought us from egypt but he's been on the mountain we don't know jessica but the brahmana said the pillar of fire was with him we don't know what's going on geddes and and aaron also cave into their demand to their ear and make made an idol that's right and they they begin to worship idol that's right that was what they broke the laws of god but then even through that god showed his grace unto mankind god so redeemed them from from from their brokenness and brought them together show forgiveness because true grace uh true they disobeyed the law the lord wanted to kill them but moses stood in the gap say lord if you kill them the egyptians will say that you couldn't forfeit what you said you're gonna do yeah you couldn't take them from the egypt to the promised land so the lord i mean obeyed the voice of a man how could god do that because christ was in moses right christ in moses was pleading for the people right of their unbelief and their sin amen so even through the broken things god will bring masterpiece out of that glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's look at numbers how broken covenant will turn into something else glory hallelujah god gave man a covenant to keep and man broke his covenant but through that the lord gave man a more excellent covenant a covenant of unconditional love the first covenant was do this and i'll do this the second covenant is i love you anyways amen glory hallelujah and let's read from numbers chapter 25 verse 1 to 5. numbers 25 let's just read okay and israel aboard in shethem and the people began to commit hodom with the daughters of moab and they called the people onto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gas gas at the idols and israel joined himself to baal poor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and the law said unto moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the son that the fierce anger of the lord may not be turned i will maybe turn away from israel and moses said unto the judges of israel slay everyone everyone has men that were joined to baal power that is worshipping idols god told them not to have o israel the lord our god is one but yes israel were enticed to worship idols under balaam's bidding and the lord did what the lord slay those who worship idols but through that the lord gave them grace unconditional covenant which they don't need to do themselves god has to live in them to do his own bedding amen glory hallelujah let's go to the fourth one broken and contrast spirit we know david was a king of god and david went through a lot of challenges david did a lot of mistakes so many of them serious mistakes he killed he committed adultery he did this he did this but the lord used that circumstances and his rookiness to show him an unconditional life because the first la the first law man couldn't obey law so the law should not show them that i'm not going to even use the law my grace is sufficient for you amen so the grace of god was with david as david would have been wiped out but the grace of god was with him and the lord established the covenant with david made him a king a prophet and a priest amen right glory hallelujah psalm psalm 51 16-19 for thou desired for thou desired not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not invent offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit and a broken and a contrite heart oh god thou not despise so god doesn't look for a sacrifice he doesn't love your material things he loves you amen he loves your heart when our heart is broken when your spirit is broken the lord loves the spirit that is broken when we are praying for somebody and that that whatever the person is going through doesn't touch you you pray just like you are throwing words in the air but if the person that waits or what the person is going through breaks you breaks your heart if your your brother or your sister's heart is broken and if your heart get broken then you can go into that spiritual desperation and pray for your sister for your brother but if it doesn't touch you just oh lord you just i mean rattle something in the atmosphere and it just goes into thin air but when you put yourself in that spirit a broken and a contrite heart that is a son of god as jack was saying in the morning when someone is going through something and you can get it get with that person or get into the spirit and through what is going through and when you pray god cannot stay god has to come in amen and that's the way we should pray one time i heard a sort of a preacher someone from a foreign land called him that pray for us we have we are having rain in our house and so okay i know i'll pray for you said no you don't know what you you don't know what i mean is rain we've got a rainstorm and the roof is gone and rain is literally pouring into our room the preacher said i got up quickly from my bed and begin to pray because the first time when he heard it from the from from the phone he said oh okay but i know i'm going to pray for you he said no no you don't know what i'm talking about i mean water is coming into our room into our house not in the house but the room the bedroom and jump up and pray and that made a difference so when you pray when something touch you when something touch your heart when you can go into your brother's feeling even your enemy's feeling someone who has wronged you someone who has did you evil if you can go into his or her spirit and say lord forgive him lord don't hold it against him amen stepping for him as we heard uh willie abraham did when a young man young man and young woman who were committing an act of sex right in the church and he the holy ghost came literally the angel of the lord said speak whatever you want right you want to sleep them there just speak they will die right away but they said i forgive them amen and that please the lord hallelujah amen i want to have had experience with a young minister there was some situation that a sister has been doing certain things for is go to the peak and the young minister the holy ghost asked him the system was miriam he said he said whatever you want speak so the brother come he said but i don't know what to do i said brother look at the name miriam right you know miriam in the bible what miriam did with his brother moses if you put a case on her or if you pick something negative on her she's your sister you are the same person you're going to pray and remove the case on her so why do you put the case on her forgive her it's an attribute that is coming from my name she doesn't know what he's doing just pray for her the lord will quieten her down and said i'll take your advice so learn to forgive amen don't hold grudges let it go the same lord i gave you grace give grace unto other people because if the lord should bring our sins and our mistakes here we cannot count it one time willie abraham was working and he met a a lady drinking with policemen old police officers yes sir and in his heart he condemned them and the lord condemned him too the lord showed him his sins amen and he repented quickly and he went to the people and he loved them and prayed for them and talked to them and the one repented right on their spot that's right the woman was in shorts and he was condemning her they were drinking and having you know those things so you don't condemn somebody have not been the grace of god you and i would have been worse than probably those people but this is love and it's grace that contains you and i so when you see those point the way they are you go into their situation and pray for them and the lord will make a difference amen glory hallelujah a contrite and a broken spirit the lord loves it let's go a little further to um a broken prophet elijah first kings chapter 19 1-3 glory hallelujah a prophet was broken but the lord used his spirit five times amen first kings one king nineteen one two three for the sake of time when you go you can read the whole story and ahab let me even start from the fourth verse okay verse one and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and and with that how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger on to elijah saying so let the gas that's her idols do to do to me and more also if i make nothing than life your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belonged to judah and left his seven there verse four but he himself went on a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was cake baking on the coast and cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said i rise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and they arose and it eats and went in the strength of that meets 40 days and 40 night unto horrible the mount of the lord amen now this is a great prophet one of the greatest prophets of all time elijah and the lord he did the bidding of the lord when israel became a adult worshipers he threw a challenge to them according to what the lord told him and he killed 400 prophet of jezebel so when jesus jesus heard that hey you've killed my prophet false preachers jesus said look i'm going to make those people the way you kill them tomorrow by this time if your head stays on you then i'm not jezebel a woman chasing a prophet of god sometimes the lord can allow certain situation you might say that i'm a believer why am i going through sickness why am i going through this why is kobe attacking family it doesn't mean kovit cannot attack a believer it doesn't mean a believer cannot die of cancer it doesn't mean if a believer can't dies of cancer then it's a sinner no it doesn't mean if he believer does of cover 19 coronavirus then he's not a saint that's right the lord can take the person's life at the time of this season elijah was a prophet of god but he died of uh boils boss in modern times like tumor that can elijah the prophet but even on his own on his barrier police when a a young man i think the only son of his mother had died and they go to a place and they threw the casket the person resurrected that's right the pillow fire was still restaurant on the largest bones amen and we have seen the pillow fighting william brahms barrier police many times in the form of dive in the form of different animals coming out so if you're a saint you're always a saint amen you don't become a devil because you had a sickness because you you broke because you lost your house you don't become an unbeliever you don't become a sinner because that's what job's friends thought because they felt like job we are human beings we are doing some secret sin there's no way this trials will come on you but god can allow a believer to go to trials so jezebel was chasing after elijah elijah has to flee for his life and he has a lot to take his life away because it was it was too much for him but the lord said that it is not time for me to take you away he sent an angel to bring a big bread big kick where did he get a break from dick tortillas uh uh but i was facing food uh what was the name of what is the name he calls it the puerto rican food i used platinum to cook how do you call it tortonis victor tonys how did how did how did it where did he come from the lord is a creator he doesn't have to have a bakery in heaven you can just speak just by thought and that attribute is in you amen if you get have faith in god certain things you don't have to pray too much just by your heart by your decree because the same god is in you amen and when you speak your word is as good as the lord glory hallelujah as brother jack told us this morning the prophet stood in for us because the prophet stood in the prince of the lord and they became christ and when they speak it wasn't moses it wasn't paul it wasn't really abraham but it was jesus christ and then they become one with them and when they speak they are sons of god and you are a daughter of god amen regardless of what you can speak and situations will change and so we have to learn to speak amen don't let the devil would push you to the corner but you have to have to speak out speak out your voice because your voice is as good as jesus christ speaking amen if jesus christ of 2000 years ago comes here he cannot help you right if he comes here in his body that he was in at the age of 33 and a half or 33 there's nothing he could do for you he can only point you back to what he already did for you that i took your place on calvary at that for you i took i was a sacrifice i took your sins upon me why do you let the devil condemn you of sin you as good guiltless as girls can be you are justified even more than justified you have been forgiven it's not in the book of it's not in my book he'll show you this is white this is how i've made your sins your sins are as black as black could be but your sins are now white your sins were as red as crimson red but my blood has made it washed away and you are very you are my very righteousness amen don't let the devil don't let your mind condemn you amen the lord doesn't remember that it's in the sea of forgetfulness don't go back to that's the end fish amen don't go and fish see your forgetful from from your brother don't go and switch from your own self hallelujah don't go and fish your past it's not your past is the person is the person that was living in the house who did that evil and that person has been evicted and unharlated and there's a new occupant that occupies jesus christ and jesus christ is what is perfect amen glory hallelujah he was just using his attribute to show you what he wanted you to see glory hallelujah let's go to the broken uh broken pictures judges chapter 17 verse 16 to 23. i'll read just two verses 19 and 20 judges 7 16-23 broken pictures and let's see how the lord used brooking pictures in the house of 300 men to win victory over the enemy so gideon and the 300 men that were with him came on to came onto the outside of the camp in the beginning beginning of the middle watch and they had but they had but newly set their watch and they blew their trumpets and breed their pictures that way in their hands and the three com three companies blew their trumpet and break their pictures and held a lamp in their hands in their left hand and their trumpets in their in their right hand hands to blow weather and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon remember this god uses men as well amen god was using gideon so they said the sword of the lord and of gideon right because god glorified himself in his children amen god put his glory in you god put his glory in his pastor god put his glory in his daughters god put his glory in his children because they are him amen so he said that sort of the lord and of gideon gideon was a judge he's actually called a prophet of that time he was delivering israel from from their battles and the lord conf destroyed us if you okay let's go and stood and the 300 blew their trumpets let me see the end of the story i just want to to make the story i don't want to read too long to make the story long the lord killed all the other he made the enemies kill themselves that's right they kind of killed themselves they didn't have to fight a battle and they just chased them and just to their spouse and so forth so sometimes you don't have to fight a battle right you have to be in line with the lord right if the lord has wanted to tell you to take a picture a picture that you hold there pictures like a container something you put water in like a water bottle that's what you hold here but i don't want you to throw it away it's become like an adult break it smash it and let the lord take control and when you let the love come to come true you can use it the thing that the unwed things that you thought it wasn't worthy moses had a road his road was just a rod that used to head his ship but the road could turn into a sneak a serpent the road could change situation the road could turn water into blood one of the first miracles moses did was turn uh blood water into blood the blood of the waters of the egyptians it was a judgment time but when jesus came he went for a wedding he attended a wedding and there was not enough wine in those times they drink wine and so jesus mother mary is i mean foster mother he knew who he was so he said you know do something here and he told people that do whatever he tells you do whatever jesus tells you and he said fill the the the parts with water they fold it and they turn into wine right away and they wonder where this wine came from where did it come from did they know that jesus has begun his miracle what is wine one is a stimulation it's life so moses brought law which was judgment but jesus christ came he didn't turn water into blood but they turned water into what into one is something to consume to bring life to stimulate jesus christ came to give life life and give it abundantly amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord seven broken loose the love use a little piece of broken a loaf of bread two pieces and broke it and gave it bless it and gave to feed five thousand people a broken bread of bread from the hands of a little boy let's read matthew 26 chapter 26 verse 24 to 28. matthew 26 24-28 and i'll jump right ahead and read the 26th verse and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and give it to the disciples that was even their love supper and said take it this is my body and into their cup and give thanks and give it to them drink you of it for this my blood and the new testament which is shared for many for the remission of sin so his bl his life his blood was a testament to wipe away our sin but then we remember the story where jesus used a broken bread just from a little boy and just a couple of fish and fed 5 000 people just present yourself to the lord amen amen who said just show up amen it's not what you have about who you are amen you are a standard verse to the lord just give yourself to the lord and lord himself will work his way out glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord can take broken piece of bread which is not much and then fit five thousand if you surrender yourself that your littleness your brokenness the lord will use your brokenness to create masterpieces out of it amen let's read um mark chapter 2 verse 25 broken roof there was a a family that their loved one was sick and there was a prayer meeting prayer campaign whatever you call it there was multitude of people they didn't have a prayer prayer card like william brahm's meeting you can't go there if you don't have a prayer card there was no way the meeting was here there was multitude so they had to come out they want to bring this this this person before the lord their family was dying and what did they do they climbed the roof took the roof somebody's house you know this is a rented place this is not your house somebody's roof they just jumped nobody was knowing nobody knew they'd got a lot of ladder what what i mean where climbed the top of the roof top of the building to the roof and before they could see anything they dropped this man see a person right before jesus and i was like what in the world is it what's going on here oh lord and jesus looked around and said your faith it's about even overwhelm jesus having seen this this this faith before the lord couldn't turn his eyes away and he what cleanse the person of his sickness that's right and say son go and sin no more go and you are freed move beyond mountain move mountains faith beyond your situation don't let the situ your situation overwhelms you but look at jesus beyond your situation here we are by the grace of god the lord has brought us to this fire over the pandemic just like moses in the act the children of israel were in the act moses and his people ate family and the lord kept them whilst there were a lot of things going around the lord kept moses if the lord has brought you fire you keep you going amen just have faith in god don't be don't don't be afraid glory hallelujah oh glory hallelujah time will permit you to read it broken roof what an amazing grace let's read one more from about three four more left three more left rather luke 7 37 broken alabaster box a woman that was unworthy even to go before the lord doesn't permit her she was nobody but this woman had a box an ointment or a perfume a lavender whatever you spray that she bought out of prostitution it wasn't the job that she prayed for and the lord gave her that job and get that job and came and paid tight no it was nothing of the la of that but out of prostitution she bought that alabaster box of ointments it was very expensive it was like i don't know i don't know the expensive ointment we have we have on the land it was i don't know which one but you you know them right she's pre she brought this bottle and anointed the lord before his barrier before his death barry and resurrection and the people around look at this woman that oh she claims to be a he claims to be a prophet he doesn't even know that this one is a prostitute and this one is wiping his feet with his with her hair but before the lord this one was writing her salvation this man is wiping her sins away this woman is receiving eternal life because he knew she knew what was in jesus but the pharisee who invited jesus christ he didn't know what was in jesus but there was no control that were there they just invited jesus christ to mock him but this woman got salvation out of her brokenness after the broken alabaster oil we are preaching about here today amen so in your brokenness the lord can still use you glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord and if a time will permit you to read verse um look you can read in two places luke 17 37 and matthew 26 6-7 our cut is short and one of the pharisees desired him that he will eat with him and he went into the francis house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment 38 and he stood at his feet behind him weeping begin to wash his feet with tears and he'd wipe them with the hairs of his head and kiss his feet and anointed them with with the ointment and he she received life antenna she didn't go back broken she went back full of joy liberated released from all her uh whatever call it all the prostitution the lord forgiven amen only adultery the lord forgiven so it doesn't matter where how far you've gone it doesn't matter your situation or your family the lord has got a power if only you believe just believe it amen broken sisters the lord did something miracles with two broken sisters mary and martha john chapter 11 26 and i won't read it you know the story the the only brother that they had lazarus was dead the family was devastated probably was the bread winner there was nothing good you know to write home about but they had still had faith maintain their faith in jesus jesus seemingly had disappointed them but men of god work with god that says the lord they walk by the discretion of the lord amen maybe you invite your pastor to come and pray for you and it doesn't come it doesn't mean your pastor doesn't love you he has to he also got a master he has to follow the lead not the master just like jesus almighty god he just doesn't do things anyhow but he said the father the son does not do nothing of himself but what you see that father doeth likewise with the son so jesus doesn't do things because you want him to do it he does it when the leadership of the holy ghost in him tells me to do it you might want your pastor to do something but that might not be the leadership not the time and season he might tarry he might not even do it at all he must oh i invited a jack for this oh i told him to do this for me he's supposed to do this for me but he didn't do it the lord has to lead him to do what he's supposed to do because he's also got their boss so he has to follow the inspection of the boss glory hallelujah so jesus didn't come when they invited him to come and pray for lazarus about how many times they send messengers cell phone text him test brother jack call him tell sister rick i call the children turbo jack i'm sick but that doesn't show up cobra jack email everything so i don't even know this my pastor doesn't love me doesn't care about me i've seen everything i've informed his family everybody he doesn't come in he didn't even come and pray for me but his boss is showing him something much greater than praying for for your situation so at the right time when the person is dead at the west west situation that's when you show up if it were to you and now would you do you might kick him out what are you coming to do when you watch my only brother to die you are coming for his funeral and you claim yourself to be a prophet you claim yourself to be my pastor you waited for my brother to die and you are coming for a full man come and come and celebrate the funeral you might be a witch that's why they call you a bit visible you might probably end draw that conclusion that really we are following a false false prophet moses didn't do this but there's something going on and when he came they were crying they didn't lose faith in christ even they hadn't said lord if i'd been here my brother wouldn't have died and even at this at this hour if you speak we know even now even now the lord can do something and they had faith they went to call his sister mary and they followed the lord people were weeping in mourning and then they went to they said let's go to the cemetery say lord they went and they said their barrier system was different they put them in a stone put a big rock on on it they kind of put them in a in a garment i mean stranded them whatever wound them around with ropes and whatever and they used to have an embalming uh cream and ointment so that the body doesn't smell and the sister said no lord this time four days my brother's nose is caved in i don't want to see my brother in that situation he said but you believe do you believe and now he went to she went to future stamata said i know in the resurrection my brother woe shall future arise when the resurrection is standing before her she is pointing to resurrection somewhere amen when you have christ in you you you're appointed to resurrection somewhere he said i am the resurrection and life if you believe in me and so he the lord raised their faith and then said take the she put them he put them to work they were sisters they said take the stone away because you become partakers of it you're going to be serious so you made them to get involved put your hands on deck let's do it together amen not only the pastor not only the deacons not only the trustees but all of us get on board put your hands on it put your feet in it put your prayers put your finance put whatever in the work of the lord and sister mary and sister mata did it they wrote a stone and now the rest of them it's not their it's not their work to do the rest of them is for the lord to do the lord has to remove their own belief from their heart their futuristic er er er futuristic doctrine bring them to the present tense i am that i am so when they believe that okay he's i am so i can read the stone and he can he can bring my brother out the lord said lazarus come up from the grave and the person did for this rose up and said lucy him that he might go and lazarus came out to live with his brother with his sisters amen the same lord is here amen i've seen him raised dead one once once in mexico the same lord is here he's not dead he can do it for you amen whatever he wants to do you believe it believe the lord don't give up amen if your situation is not that there's somebody dead i've seen a dead person being raised before it's your situation is that that west what can the lord do for you just keep believing and relax your spirit and the lord has already done it for you don't worry about time time is nothing we are human beings we age we celebrate birthday we have timing so time is something so big in our mind but in the in in the concept of god time is nothing it doesn't live in time you want to teach you attribute of patient amen glory hallelujah and you know the story i won't go i will go to read it let's go to the 11th we're getting closer broken nets fishermen broken net and broken ships these people went to fish they didn't catch nothing they fished on the wrong side of the sea all night all day long they came they wouldn't even get a piece of fish to use it for their food for their tacos and for their bread and for whatever but now when the lord came in he said take your net and cast it on this side the lord always wants you to use faith peter was was one of the biggest fishermen and he know everything about seashore about fishing so you know where the fish is where you can get a school of fish they've tried everywhere they couldn't even get one piece of fish so peter said well lord i know we've taught all night maybe 24 24 hours not even a little piece of fish but at that word at that command right i believe i i seek i receive amen and then peter threw his net at the right side and he came with multitude of fish to death the net was breaking they have to call others to come and help them when you get abandoned you give some to others amen don't be me my and myself but eternal life is living for others when the lord has blessed you as we heard this morning the lord has blessed you with grace give grace unto others encourage others people are hurting people are going through difficult times it could be something it could be a word it could be a prayer it could be shalom it could be god bless you it could be a sincere i love you from your heart maybe you're a woman somebody's hurting a family just to go maybe neighbor whoever co-worker to let them know that you love them they are going through something you pray for them from their hearts not from their mind if you speak it from their mind it just goes into the thin air but if it's from the heart the heart is where the lord lives it will make a difference in their life amen because words are life and they are death if it's well spoken it brings life just like we said you've got a power and you want to use the power for evil you can use it for evil if you want to get a power to kill other people all your enemies oh i want this power if anybody offend me i'll just pick hey you die you i slay you you're going to slay other people on the planet no god doesn't give power to you until he gives you character amen glory hallelujah and uh john 2 21 8-13 and the other disciples came in on a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with the fishes and as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish and fish lay there there and bread and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which you have now caught salmon peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes and 150 and three for all there were so many yet was not the broken yes yet was not their net broken jesus said unto them come and dine and now that and none of the disciples did ask him who are thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and take a bread and give it them and fish likewise when you come to jesus table commander there's a song that goes like jesus and city will spread where the saints of god are fed he invited his children people come and dine with his mana he defeat and supplies your every need o t sweet to sup with jesus all the time come and dine the master calleth commandant you may feast our jesus table all the time he who fed their multitude turn their water into wine so if you are hungry come to jesus table amen and the last one about the broken ship acts chapter 27 31 to 40 41. that's the last one paul was a prophet of god and he was going to pray the gospel and then the lord was with him he showed him that it was going to be a disaster there was going to be an incident our accident about a ship but if the people stay on the ship no life will perish so so paul told them to stay on on the ship and let's read it a little bit let's read have some reading let's read from 41 to 44. acts chapter 27 you can read the whole story from 31 to 41 but let's read from 41 to 44 and falling into places where the two seats met they ran the ship aground and their fall apart stuck first and remained unmovable but the hinder part of hinapat was broken with the violence of the world of the whips and the soldiers council was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape but a centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they could swim they could swim should cast themselves into the sea and go to the land and the rest some on board some unbroken pieces of ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to the land a man the ship of christ the old ship of zion may look broken and old but if you stay on that ship the gospel ship when corona came yes we know things were happening but if you stay on the ship the word if i apply the word they're talking onto your family everything will be okay amen things might go higgly piglety things will go here and there but if you stay on the ship focus on christ you land safely amen because the lord he's in control of everything before corona chris jesus is alive he's alive during corona and will be alive after corona he's the one who controls he sent an angel on the earth to allow these things to happen because the universe is for him it's not for the president of russia it's not for putin it's not for trump it's not for any of those politicians the universe is for jesus christ and he's manifesting his world through your word amen aren't you happy and glad that the lord has found you worthy you and why who are not worthy to live in you just think about that thought in closing you think about that the lord has found you worthy that you should become a temple of the living god amen the lord have found you a worthy vessel the lord is merciful to us the lord he so gracious unto you the lord is so merciful unto us the lord has shown his love on to you the lord is so merciful unto you the lord he so grace your son to you the king has shown his love unto you the lord is so merciful unto you amen the lord has shown his love and grace unto you he loves you don't fret your heart don't run here and there be stable stay where god has put you just like a soul in there pulling the people those who stay on the ship there was no there was a shipwreck but they landed safely amen the lord has given you here to eat the bread of life the lord has prayed a table before you you might come in broken you might come in broken pieces you might be a broken ship it might be a broken family but if you stay in the world and eat the weather come from the table of god the lord that the word will take your broken pieces god has given you a doctor bahram said was a doctor you only had a prescription now all persecutions repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you receive the gift of the holy ghost the brother jack is not doing nothing but his aton's a doctor or a pharmacist the lord has given prescription for his children and when he come okay what is your problem my problem is headache okay i'll give you a procedure and i'll give you a leave i'll give you a uh ibuprofen i'll give you a narcotic whatever based on the situation if you need to take a a a high strength they will be given to it and only all that you have to do is to trust the doctor and the pharmacist and take the medication and when you take the medication or the fascination you are immune amen all that you have to do is what the word that comes from it don't doubt it don't don't let the enemy sow doubt into your mind but receive with all your heart and act upon the word and the word will leave himself in you amen when you come what why do you think god didn't send you anywhere in the world by this church there are mega churches here that you could have gone to but somehow the lord led you here does the lord make mistake no absolutely no so the lord has got bread and fish and all kind of dessert for you full square meal that you can eat and your job before all that you have to do is what eat the bread of life and your life will change amen i've seen him change lives we've seen him change life we're all shipwrecked nobody was born perfect all of us were born shipwrecked right because we were born through sex your problem is not because you're a thief because you commit adultery because you you drink you smoke your problem is because you are born wrong the law of your breath was wrong so the lord has to take that breath away and burn it and you'll be born again and when you're born of the lord the loss are written on your heart the laws guide you go here go here move your stop here come back and the lord lead you to life shall we be on our feet glory hallelujah to
