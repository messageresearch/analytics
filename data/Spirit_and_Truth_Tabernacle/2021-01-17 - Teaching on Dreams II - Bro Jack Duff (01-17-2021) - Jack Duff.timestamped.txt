[0:38] continue that
[0:39] tonight we've kind of taken a uh
[0:44] just a detour typically we are teaching
[0:48] uh in the book of ephesians but we just
[0:50] wanted to start the year off with this
[0:52] teaching on dreams and then
[0:54] if the lord would allow if we finish it
[0:56] tonight then we'll get back to our
[0:58] teaching on ephesians but
[1:00] let's just bow in a word of prayer as we
[1:02] start this tonight father we thank you
[1:04] for
[1:05] the privilege and the opportunity we
[1:06] have to come into the house of god
[1:10] lord our prayers that you would minister
[1:12] to our
[1:13] uh needs tonight that you will speak to
[1:15] us the only way that you can
[1:17] we trust oh god that uh you would use
[1:19] this to bring glory and honor to
[1:21] yourself
[1:23] bless the saints that have gathered
[1:24] bless the saints that have joined us
[1:26] online those that are still on the way
[1:27] god
[1:28] give travel and mercies to and just ask
[1:30] that you would be glorified and
[1:31] magnified and all that
[1:32] happens uh in this place tonight it's in
[1:35] jesus name
[1:36] we pray amen amen uh if you all just
[1:40] stand with me we'll turn and read
[1:42] out of the book of acts chapter two
[1:52] okay uh starting here verse
[1:55] 15 tonight
[1:58] and as i mentioned as we started the
[2:00] year off uh
[2:02] just talking about the seven junctions
[2:04] we preached on the first junction
[2:06] uh at the first of the year this
[2:08] scripture is what brother branham used
[2:11] uh when he preached on uh the junction
[2:13] of time
[2:14] here out of acts 2 and i thought it was
[2:17] very appropriate
[2:18] for you know our discussion on dreams as
[2:21] well so here in acts 2 verse 15
[2:23] for these are not drunken as
[2:26] ye suppose seeing it is but the third
[2:30] hour of the day
[2:31] but this is that which was spoken
[2:34] by the prophet joel and it shall come to
[2:38] pass
[2:39] in the last days saith god i will pour
[2:42] out of my spirit upon all flesh
[2:46] and your sons and your daughters shall
[2:48] prophesy
[2:50] and your young men shall see visions
[2:53] and your old men shall dream
[2:56] dreams and all my servants
[3:00] and all my handmaidens i will pour out
[3:03] in
[3:03] those days of my spirit and they shall
[3:06] prophesy
[3:08] uh it says and i will show wonders in
[3:10] heaven
[3:11] above and signs in the earth beneath
[3:12] blood fire and vapor of smoke
[3:15] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[3:17] and the moon into blood before that
[3:19] great and
[3:19] notable day of the lord come and it
[3:22] shall
[3:23] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[3:25] on the name of the lord
[3:26] shall be saved amen the lord had a
[3:29] blessing to the reading
[3:30] of his word you may be seated we will
[3:34] again just continue this teaching i did
[3:36] a part one
[3:38] on this on last week and if you did not
[3:40] get an opportunity to hear that i want
[3:42] to encourage you to go back and just
[3:43] listen to that
[3:44] this is just something to help give
[3:47] guidance
[3:48] to the church as we go forward
[3:51] uh i really believe god uses dreams
[3:54] i believe god just as we read the
[3:57] scripture this is a promise for this day
[4:00] uh but just as we know it's a promise
[4:02] for this day it's also
[4:03] satan it's something that satan can get
[4:06] involved in
[4:07] right and he can create a lot of
[4:11] problems if it's not handled the right
[4:13] way
[4:14] right so our our focus amen and our goal
[4:18] is just to put structure around it uh so
[4:21] that it can be
[4:22] edifying a man not uh not something
[4:25] that's
[4:26] used to destroy but something that's
[4:28] used to edify
[4:29] brother branham made a statement he says
[4:31] gifts are to magnify and i actually i
[4:34] keep forgetting to do that
[4:36] um the other verse i won't read it but
[4:39] i'll just quote it romans 11 29
[4:41] it tells us that uh for gifts and
[4:43] callings are without repentance right so
[4:46] uh gifts are used to magnify uh to
[4:49] assist
[4:49] in the church gifts are not used to rule
[4:52] the church
[4:54] praise the lord they're not used to rule
[4:56] the church
[4:57] what rules the church is the word of god
[5:00] right so
[5:01] uh we want to make sure that we get that
[5:03] we get that right gifts are used to
[5:05] magnify
[5:06] you know to to just help uh strengthen
[5:08] the church but not to dominate and rule
[5:10] the church
[5:11] uh uh brother branham made a statement
[5:13] says the more simpler you become
[5:15] that's a gifted person the more simply
[5:16] you become the greater you'll become
[5:19] before god that's right don't try to
[5:21] lift
[5:21] yourself up when you do you bring
[5:23] yourself down so anytime
[5:25] anytime a person is trying to lift
[5:27] himself up with a gift they
[5:28] actually bring themselves down uh and
[5:31] they don't a lot of times people don't
[5:32] don't don't catch that
[5:34] um you know the first thing we'll say is
[5:36] that nobody
[5:37] is receiving me no it's you're trying to
[5:39] exalt yourself and when you exalt
[5:41] yourself you actually bring yourself
[5:43] down
[5:43] right praise the lord he says when you
[5:45] do you bring yourself down
[5:47] he that exalts himself shall be abased
[5:51] praise god now i want to uh start with
[5:53] this quote out of church order and i
[5:55] want to make this statement
[5:56] we welcome the gifts at spirit and truth
[6:00] tabernacle we welcome them
[6:02] it's according to the bible we welcome
[6:04] and i'm going to read you a quote where
[6:05] brother branham
[6:06] actually uh makes it very clear that
[6:09] they welcomed it at
[6:10] uh at branham tabernacle so here in this
[6:13] message church order
[6:15] it says now may the lord bless you all
[6:18] uh and i trust that this will
[6:22] be carried out to the very best of your
[6:25] knowledge i'm in paragraph
[6:26] 64 in the in the quote church order
[6:29] it says and may the holy spirit watch
[6:32] over each one
[6:33] of you may every officer
[6:36] of the church feel his post of duty
[6:40] knowing this that god is going to hold
[6:42] you responsible
[6:44] for how you held your office in the
[6:46] church
[6:47] each one will have to give an account
[6:50] amen for how they hold their office in
[6:52] the church
[6:53] and it says this into the laity amen to
[6:56] the laity
[6:57] and the dear gifted saints
[7:00] that's in our church praise god those
[7:03] who prophesy
[7:05] or speak with tongues or interpret
[7:09] or have revelations so these are gifted
[7:12] saints that can prophesy
[7:14] speak with tongs interpret and also have
[7:17] revelations it says
[7:18] we are just so happy to have you in the
[7:21] service
[7:22] now this is what the prophets say we're
[7:23] just so happy to have you in the
[7:24] services
[7:25] and we will give you
[7:29] full cooperation glory
[7:32] and everything that the holy spirit
[7:34] shall prove that he has said to you now
[7:36] that's
[7:37] a key statement the holy ghost got to
[7:39] prove it
[7:40] amen we give full cooperation when the
[7:44] holy ghost
[7:45] proves it not just somebody proving it
[7:47] themselves but the holy ghost got to
[7:49] prove it
[7:50] amen so he says we'll get we will give
[7:52] you full cooperation everything
[7:54] that the holy spirit shall prove that he
[7:58] has said to you
[7:59] and we love you praise god
[8:02] we love you and we believe that these
[8:04] gifts
[8:05] are in you and if you have a right
[8:07] opportunity
[8:09] and a scripturally presentation of it
[8:12] that you will make great workers in
[8:15] our midst he says and may the lord bless
[8:18] you all
[8:19] is my sincere prayer amen
[8:22] i heard that quote just a couple of
[8:24] weeks ago brother troy read it and
[8:26] and i just thought it was very fitting
[8:28] for you know what we were talking about
[8:30] here tonight
[8:30] i want i want people to know we welcome
[8:32] the gifts
[8:34] but it's just got to be done the right
[8:36] way amen that's that's all that's all
[8:38] now here in deuteronomy 13 uh verse one
[8:41] through three i read this last week just
[8:42] gonna read this really quickly
[8:44] and um and just just give us some
[8:46] scripture foundation as well as you know
[8:48] as what what the prophet said i believe
[8:50] that as we get these things
[8:52] settled amen in the church then we will
[8:55] be strengthened
[8:56] glory to god so here deuteronomy 13
[8:58] verse 1 says
[9:00] if they arise among you a prophet
[9:03] notice what the bible say or a dreamer
[9:06] of dreams and giveth thee a sign
[9:09] or a wonder so you can be a prophet or a
[9:12] dreamer of dreams
[9:14] and and and i read this last week
[9:16] everybody does not have the
[9:18] the um everybody's not given that
[9:20] ability to be able to dream dreams
[9:22] you know uh sometimes some people have
[9:24] it typically one that dreams dreams is
[9:26] one that
[9:26] sleeps light the one that sleeps um uh
[9:29] heavy
[9:30] they typically don't dream a lot of
[9:31] dreams so everybody everybody uh
[9:34] is not in that category but uh but here
[9:36] we say if they're
[9:37] the scripture says they're if they're
[9:38] arise among your prophet or a dreamer of
[9:41] dreams and giveth thee a sign or wonder
[9:44] and the sign or the wonder comes to pass
[9:48] right so it's it's vindicated uh so it
[9:50] seems
[9:51] where have he spoken that he's saying
[9:53] let us go after other gods
[9:55] which thou has not known and let us
[9:57] serve them he says thou
[9:59] shalt not hearken even if it's
[10:02] vindicated right uh thou shalt
[10:05] not hearken unto the words of that
[10:09] prophet
[10:11] or that dreamer of dreams if they say
[10:14] something it seemed
[10:15] i mean that thing vindicated but it's
[10:17] going against the word
[10:19] hallelujah the the bible tells us
[10:22] moses said don't hearken unto it he says
[10:25] uh
[10:26] he says uh the words of that prophet or
[10:27] that dream of dreams for the lord your
[10:29] god
[10:30] proveth you now that's that's the the
[10:32] the the the beautiful thing i see in the
[10:34] scripture
[10:35] is that god will allow it to come in god
[10:38] would allow it to
[10:39] a man to manifest and look real good but
[10:42] what god is doing is testing you to see
[10:44] whether
[10:44] what you standing with hallelujah are
[10:47] you gonna stand with the word
[10:49] are you gonna stand with a gift amen
[10:52] hallelujah you know uh moses gift got
[10:55] him in trouble
[10:57] oh church moses gift calls him the mr
[11:00] promised land
[11:02] his gift got ahead of the word of god
[11:04] when god told him
[11:05] to uh to speak to the rock he struck it
[11:07] twice he got a manifestation
[11:10] he got water hallelujah but he also did
[11:15] not
[11:15] get the promised land amen so we don't
[11:18] want a gift to get us in trouble with
[11:20] god
[11:21] this thing has got to be kept in line
[11:24] with the word
[11:26] hallelujah thou shall not hearken unto
[11:29] the words of that prophet or
[11:30] or that dream of dreams for the lord
[11:32] your god proveth you to know whether you
[11:34] love
[11:34] uh whether you love your love your god
[11:36] with all your heart
[11:37] and with all your soul now uh i i put
[11:41] these notes here the dream could be
[11:42] perfectly right
[11:44] but if it leads us away from the words
[11:46] the dream was a test
[11:49] to see whether we would whether we hold
[11:51] to the word or not
[11:52] and i'm gonna just be honest with you
[11:53] i'm gonna just be very clear
[11:56] i will always hold to the word
[12:00] always this is gonna be my absolute
[12:03] what the word of god says right so so
[12:06] i'm not i'm
[12:07] i mean we thank god for supernatural
[12:09] things but the word has got to be
[12:11] first amen amen
[12:14] so look at this now i'm going a little
[12:16] further uh and then the reason i'm the
[12:17] reason i'm holding to the words because
[12:19] the bible
[12:20] says heavens and earth will pass away
[12:23] but my words
[12:24] will remain forever that's why i hold to
[12:27] the word
[12:28] all right if we can just get everybody
[12:31] to put the word above the gift
[12:34] then we will be a blessed and
[12:36] spiritually prosperous
[12:38] church as long as we keep the word above
[12:41] the gift
[12:42] and i need you to understand every dream
[12:44] is not of god
[12:46] every dream is not of god hallelujah so
[12:49] you know
[12:50] i i told you all about the man that you
[12:52] know came to
[12:53] you know the prophet was had to have a
[12:54] talk with him he was running around town
[12:56] uh he left his wife and family in
[12:58] another country he over here running
[12:59] around with
[13:00] uh with another woman um and uh the
[13:03] woman had been married multiple times
[13:05] and
[13:05] brother man i'm saying now uh brother do
[13:07] you know who this woman is
[13:08] yeah yeah i know and he had some dream
[13:10] about you know um
[13:12] uh his wife did something to him in the
[13:14] dream and then he forgave him it's like
[13:16] you know just the same way
[13:17] he said somebody the same way god
[13:19] forgave me i can forgive her
[13:20] brother graham said that sounds mighty
[13:22] good brother but that's off the words
[13:25] they say your dream is off to work now
[13:27] i'ma tell you the reason the man was
[13:28] running
[13:29] with that woman is because of a dream
[13:33] oh lord the reason that man was running
[13:36] with that woman
[13:37] is because of a dream even though the
[13:39] dream was off
[13:41] now can i go a little further with that
[13:43] statement the reason some people run
[13:45] because a woman represent a church
[13:47] the reason some people run with a church
[13:50] is because of a dream
[13:51] and sometimes the dream can be off the
[13:53] word yeah
[13:55] hallelujah i got some things to read
[13:57] i'ma just keep reading
[13:58] uh here um gifts god's gifts always
[14:02] found their places look at what the
[14:03] prophet said in this
[14:05] says very strange here
[14:08] how that god in a lesser way
[14:11] god does speak to people through dreams
[14:14] now this is what he say
[14:15] god's gifts are always found in place
[14:17] god does speak to people through dreams
[14:20] i believe it it says but how that god
[14:23] in this case use a secondary
[14:27] my god says now dream if it's
[14:30] interpreted rightly
[14:31] it is the same as a vision if it's a
[14:34] dream
[14:34] and being interpreted god's used it
[14:37] since way back in the old testament and
[14:40] down through
[14:41] age so god uses dreams we know that
[14:43] right
[14:44] it says he says and promise in the last
[14:46] days to use it again
[14:48] amen it says now people can overeat
[14:52] glory and so forth and get nightmares
[14:55] and it's not real spiritual dreams it
[14:59] don't ring up
[15:00] when you read it amen so that means
[15:03] sometimes somebody get a prophet a dream
[15:05] brother random what you think it is and
[15:07] he's saying in his heart this ain't
[15:09] ringing up
[15:10] glory to god this ain't ringing up
[15:12] hallelujah it says it don't ring up when
[15:15] you read it
[15:16] and some of it might seem right but yet
[15:19] there's
[15:19] real spiritual dreams and we know here
[15:22] at the tabernacle that god gives people
[15:24] dreams
[15:25] and they are interpreted and they come
[15:28] to pass
[15:29] and they're real but i want you to catch
[15:31] this statement from the prophet
[15:33] but it's a secondary way of doing it
[15:37] a dream is a secondary way of god
[15:41] actually getting something to us the
[15:44] primary way that god wants to bring
[15:46] things to his people is through his word
[15:49] a vindicated prophet gives us his word
[15:51] that is god's primary way
[15:54] he reveals his secrets to his servants
[15:56] the prophets
[15:58] praise the lord so so it's very
[16:00] important for us to understand that
[16:02] dreams are not supposed to amen dominate
[16:05] or rule or run a church
[16:06] that's that's not that's not the way
[16:08] it's supposed to be and i know you know
[16:09] there's there's uh
[16:11] i know of uh some certain situations
[16:13] where
[16:14] man you could the dreams actually just
[16:16] dominate the church the person gets
[16:17] something
[16:18] uh that they feel like the lord gave and
[16:20] vetted it through nobody
[16:22] vetted it through nobody no no no person
[16:25] with the spirit of discernment
[16:27] heard it they just went right before the
[16:29] church and
[16:30] shut down the whole church with a dream
[16:33] hallelujah things
[16:34] all kind of things begin to change in
[16:36] church because one person stream
[16:38] no that ain't the way we're gonna run
[16:39] things here that's just not gonna be it
[16:41] amen we welcome dreams i i want to make
[16:44] sure it's very clear we welcome just got
[16:45] to come
[16:46] a certain way a certain order and we're
[16:49] trying to establish that order
[16:51] through this teaching now let me go a
[16:53] little further here this is out of the
[16:54] message questions asked questions and
[16:56] answers part two
[16:58] hallelujah i said that that man had the
[17:01] wrong dream
[17:02] about this woman thinking that this
[17:04] woman was
[17:05] um you know was you know he got
[17:08] something from god saying
[17:09] the same way i forgive you you can
[17:10] forgive her brother ram say that sound
[17:12] mighty good brother but it's not in the
[17:15] words
[17:16] it's not in the word and this is thing
[17:18] sometimes sometimes things can sound
[17:20] mighty good but you're trying to see if
[17:21] that thing fit the word now watch this
[17:23] watch this this quote right here this is
[17:25] out of questions and answers
[17:27] says uh brother branham what shall we do
[17:31] there's something that's settled over me
[17:32] that i cannot break through
[17:35] last fall i dreamed i was lost in white
[17:39] sand
[17:41] says it was getting dark i couldn't find
[17:44] my way
[17:45] this dream has stayed with me since last
[17:48] fall
[17:49] now not only did it stay with them now i
[17:51] want you to watch what's happening here
[17:52] in this question it says this dream has
[17:55] stayed with me since last fall
[17:57] now i am as one groping in darkness
[18:02] says my son irvin and wife were included
[18:05] in my dream so
[18:06] this this this lady had a dream she
[18:09] shared it with her son and his wife
[18:10] because they were
[18:11] in the dream glory to god
[18:14] they were in the dream so she decides
[18:17] i'ma share with them and she say i'm
[18:18] groping in darkness
[18:20] now i want you to also understand this
[18:22] lady interpreted her own dream
[18:24] oh lord jesus she interpreted her own
[18:28] dream and uh and when she interpreted
[18:31] by giving the wrong interpretation y'all
[18:34] stay with me here tonight
[18:35] by giving the wrong interpretation it
[18:37] actually impacted her son
[18:39] and impacted the daughter-in-law the
[18:42] wrong interpretation of the dream
[18:45] look at this now it says now they're
[18:46] also in darkness we are in desperation
[18:49] i believe god will show you what is what
[18:51] uh what is in our hearts now
[18:53] uh all right if if we are wrong or
[18:56] sitting in place uh
[18:57] sitting places tell us we want to be
[18:59] right
[19:00] uh messed up over dream for months not
[19:03] just her
[19:04] but her son and the daughter-in-law
[19:07] messed up over this lady's dream and her
[19:09] own interpretation
[19:10] this is why it's important to you know
[19:12] get three
[19:13] uh get three two or three feet with the
[19:15] spirit of discernment to interpret your
[19:17] dream
[19:18] don't try to do it yourself hallelujah
[19:21] glory to god watch this watch it it says
[19:23] i don't know the lady
[19:25] he says but i just i just feel if you
[19:28] hear
[19:28] lady that here is your trouble he says
[19:31] you have
[19:31] let something happen to you that's
[19:35] made you nervous because being in white
[19:38] sands
[19:39] represents purity and righteous
[19:43] the lady's dream is that she was in
[19:45] white sand but her
[19:47] incorrect interpretation made her feel
[19:49] she was lost
[19:52] and not only made her feel she was lost
[19:54] she made her son
[19:55] and the daughter-in-law feel that they
[19:57] were lost as well then realized that the
[19:59] dream had a positive meaning
[20:02] see it take a profit to bring this uh
[20:03] bring this up to uh
[20:05] break break break the uh the
[20:06] understanding he says represents purity
[20:08] and righteous
[20:09] and and you're just letting satan good
[20:12] god almighty
[20:14] you're just letting satan put one over
[20:16] on you
[20:17] how did the devil put one over on him
[20:20] through a dream
[20:25] the devil got one over on this lady
[20:27] through a dream
[20:29] hallelujah that's why i say you got to
[20:31] watch this the devil no
[20:32] the devil can use it just like god can
[20:34] use it amen
[20:36] it says he says you just let him satan
[20:38] put one over on you
[20:40] your dream proved that there's nothing
[20:43] wrong
[20:43] you're only nervous and by doing this
[20:46] and thinking this
[20:47] you're making the rest of your family
[20:50] nervous
[20:51] look at what the prophets say stop doing
[20:54] it claim your god-given rights that mean
[20:58] take a stand on the word
[20:59] right claim your god-given rights your
[21:01] dream proves by the interpretation
[21:04] that you are in white sand everything's
[21:07] all right
[21:07] it's you oh my goodness it's
[21:11] you yourself nervous amen it says
[21:14] you let one member of the family get
[21:15] nervous look at what they say
[21:17] and it goes to the next member and the
[21:20] next member
[21:20] and the first thing you're all fussing
[21:22] and going on glory
[21:24] and one member of the family gets kind
[21:26] of upset about something
[21:27] it upsets the other and the other and
[21:29] the other and the first thing you know
[21:30] the whole family is upset
[21:33] it's satan
[21:37] then if one member of the family
[21:38] rejoices let the rest of them rejoice
[21:40] with it so
[21:41] every one of the family try to do that
[21:43] now he goes on says
[21:44] try each one of your children to help
[21:46] your pop and mama
[21:47] mama papa you try to help the children
[21:50] don't let that gloomy
[21:52] unbelieving spirit get around you
[21:57] you are christians you are born of the
[21:59] spirit of god you're the salt of the
[22:01] earth you have god-given rights and the
[22:02] bible said if there be any praise if
[22:04] there be any virtue
[22:05] think on these things don't think about
[22:07] the wrong thing
[22:08] he says and sister i think that's your
[22:10] trouble sister dear i could
[22:12] i could dwell on that a long time but
[22:14] according to what i promised just 20
[22:16] minutes and i'd like to get just
[22:17] many of these if it ain't put it put it
[22:19] back on the desk
[22:20] and i'll get it again so he interprets
[22:23] this lady's dream
[22:24] tells us that the white sand represented
[22:27] purity and righteousness
[22:28] but because she herself had the wrong
[22:31] interpretation
[22:32] it caused her to have this gloomy spirit
[22:34] and it also brought her abroad it
[22:36] brought her son
[22:37] and the daughter-in-law under that
[22:39] spirit of gloom because she had the
[22:40] wrong interpretation i'll tell you
[22:42] there's some folk that's really messed
[22:44] up today
[22:45] because they had the wrong
[22:46] interpretation of a dream
[22:51] i want to tell you something we're here
[22:52] to try to help people in this hour we
[22:54] don't want to see people
[22:55] hurt in this hour we want to see people
[22:58] helped
[22:58] but the only way we're going to get your
[23:00] help is that we got to bring some type
[23:02] of structure
[23:03] some type of order to it it's got to be
[23:06] that way
[23:07] now now um i can just uh
[23:10] uh plain and tell you i mean just just
[23:13] come out and tell you that
[23:14] brother branham didn't necessarily give
[23:15] a specific way
[23:17] to handle this the bible said that you
[23:19] know back in the old testament they had
[23:21] the urim thumb
[23:22] that they had to go before now who had
[23:23] the urine thummer the priests
[23:26] priests would have the european thunder
[23:27] so basically they had to bring it to
[23:29] the priests amen and they passed through
[23:32] that priest now we don't brother branham
[23:33] say the euro thumbnail today is the word
[23:35] of god
[23:36] amen so when you bring it through the
[23:38] priests
[23:39] not just take off running through the
[23:40] church but bring it to the pastor
[23:42] let me see it and i'm gonna just be
[23:44] honest with you i'm not the only one
[23:45] looking at it
[23:46] it's other folk in this church that's
[23:48] gifted with discernment
[23:50] and as they're looking at i'm assembling
[23:52] a team of people
[23:54] that have the spirit of discernment let
[23:56] them come together pray over that dream
[23:58] that you submit
[23:59] let them pray over that dream and let's
[24:01] see what the lord tell
[24:02] them most people give a dream and they
[24:04] already know what the interpretation is
[24:06] if you already know it why are you
[24:07] submitting it praise the lord
[24:10] right you know but i can tell you this
[24:12] much the reason you want to submit is
[24:13] that you want to make sure your
[24:14] interpretation
[24:16] is right see what god does with people
[24:18] with the gift of discernment
[24:20] now i just want to just mention this i
[24:23] i've been presented with a number of
[24:24] dreams
[24:25] uh i i started working on this topic
[24:28] last year and
[24:28] and i was just kind of waiting on the
[24:30] right time to bring it and i knew
[24:32] that when i brought it it was going to
[24:33] be a very sensitive area this is you
[24:35] know
[24:35] um unless you just praise everybody in
[24:39] their dreams you you you become a
[24:42] a bad guy almost right and unless you
[24:46] just come out and say yeah your dream of
[24:47] the lord yeah you're dreaming of the
[24:48] lord yeah
[24:49] and i can't say that i can't say that
[24:52] i'm reading your quotes from brother
[24:53] branham had people that ran into him
[24:54] with dreams that he couldn't say that
[24:56] that was of god
[24:57] amen and the other thing as a as a
[24:59] pastor trying to
[25:00] uh get the word of god to the people i
[25:03] can't interpret i can't
[25:06] i can't interpret everybody's dream i
[25:08] can't do it right
[25:09] but but i think we can put a structure
[25:11] in place where we can get some of those
[25:12] things addressed
[25:13] now i do want to tell you this as well
[25:16] um some dreams might not get interpreted
[25:20] because god ain't gave nothing to nobody
[25:22] and if god don't give it to nobody you
[25:24] just gotta wait
[25:26] don't try to make nothing out of it
[25:28] hallelujah right
[25:29] but but but you know i i've been called
[25:31] by people not even
[25:33] people in our church you know sometimes
[25:34] people of other churches
[25:36] uh sometimes you know what has happened
[25:38] that you know if i if maybe if i i've
[25:39] walked
[25:40] i've talked to somebody about a dream
[25:41] and maybe the lord showed me something
[25:42] and i will
[25:43] you know i'll share something with them
[25:45] and and it might be right on for that
[25:46] person but then sometimes they share
[25:48] with another person like hey you know
[25:49] talk to brother jack well i get calls
[25:51] from other churches and it's like i
[25:53] appreciate that
[25:55] but uh but i i'm not i'm not for the
[25:57] other churches
[25:59] right i'm here for spirit and truth
[26:00] tabernacle you know if we're
[26:02] fellowshipping around something we just
[26:03] you know just happened to be talking
[26:04] maybe the lord might show something and
[26:06] we'll try to do whatever we can but
[26:08] but here's spirit and truth tabernacle
[26:09] we're just trying to get things
[26:10] established a certain way
[26:12] so that people won't make bad decisions
[26:15] praise god don't won't don't don't let a
[26:17] dream
[26:18] a man over over overtake the word
[26:21] and now you are doing something that you
[26:23] should have never been doing
[26:25] my all right it so i've been presented
[26:27] number dreams lately from various
[26:29] sources
[26:30] some of the people don't even attend our
[26:32] church so i started meditating and
[26:34] praying about how to embrace the gifts
[26:36] uh and also provide an environment that
[26:38] allows the gifts to be effective
[26:41] so what i'm trying to do is create a
[26:43] successful structure
[26:45] amen around of these gifts and um
[26:48] and and the other thing i notice about
[26:50] dreams you know different different ones
[26:52] that i would
[26:52] i would read i would you know uh
[26:54] different people share
[26:55] dreams uh god deals with people
[26:59] uh and dreams on different levels
[27:03] i'ma say that again god deals with
[27:06] people in dreams
[27:08] on different levels just the same way he
[27:11] deals with
[27:12] singers on different levels just the
[27:15] same way he deals with musicians
[27:17] on different levels just the same way he
[27:20] deals with preachers
[27:22] on different levels preachers when they
[27:24] stand up here everybody come from a
[27:25] different angle
[27:27] my god my god some amen like me i like
[27:31] to read a lot of quotes
[27:33] others just preached by inspiration amen
[27:36] but that's the way god
[27:37] built them to be able to present the
[27:38] gospel hallelujah
[27:40] and it's the same way when it come with
[27:41] a dream if you go back and
[27:43] listen to cersei's time brother branham
[27:45] had six dreams
[27:47] and one vision and in them six streams
[27:49] they was coming from
[27:50] from different angles but yet brother
[27:52] branham interpreter said they all mean
[27:53] the same thing
[27:54] glory to god see everybody come from a
[27:57] different angle you got to be able to
[27:58] understand that
[28:00] that's why if you don't understand it
[28:02] and you would judge a dream just like
[28:03] if if it didn't match up the way that
[28:05] you understood it then you just call it
[28:06] wrong
[28:07] it might not be wrong hallelujah you
[28:10] need spiritual people with discernment
[28:12] that can be able to kind of you know uh
[28:15] judge that look at this
[28:16] so i i wrote this down uh
[28:19] services of time was based upon six
[28:21] dreams of one vision each dreamer
[28:23] presented something different but a
[28:25] prophet put it all together
[28:26] now i also want you to know something
[28:28] about a dream if you want it to be
[28:31] um credible
[28:34] if you want to dream to be credible you
[28:37] can't
[28:38] come and tell us you had a dream after
[28:40] something that happened
[28:44] hello church right you can't come after
[28:47] the event that occurred and then you say
[28:50] i had a dream about it
[28:51] if you want to be taken credibly
[28:55] notice before brother branham priest the
[28:57] seals six dreams
[28:58] one vision all that was told before the
[29:01] seals were revealed
[29:03] praise god right the dreams on the
[29:06] vision was told before the event
[29:07] occurred
[29:08] on sunset mountain so the structure here
[29:10] is that it must be told before
[29:12] it occurs and not afterwards
[29:16] if you want it to be credible all right
[29:19] now i want to just kind of i'm taking
[29:21] you know just some some thoughts from
[29:23] the prophet
[29:24] and i'm trying to put it around this
[29:26] amen just uh
[29:27] if i can i'm going to uh go to
[29:30] message questions and answers on the
[29:32] holy ghost and as i
[29:34] as we get this pulled up i just want to
[29:36] say this
[29:37] brother branham established a structure
[29:39] of having gifted people
[29:41] meet an hour before service to share
[29:44] what they heard from the lords
[29:46] in that gathering he says in that
[29:48] gathering
[29:49] there must be three people with the
[29:52] spirit of discernment
[29:54] to confirm whether it is of the lord or
[29:56] not i want you to get that now
[29:58] this is what this what the you know the
[29:59] prophet set up a structure
[30:01] around prophecy and all i'm doing here
[30:04] is taking the structure that he used
[30:05] around prophecy
[30:07] and i'm using the same structure for
[30:08] dreams
[30:11] all right it's going to fit and if we
[30:13] have people that was prophesying a lot
[30:15] we want to use the same structure that
[30:16] the prophet established
[30:18] will see success in the church questions
[30:21] and answers on the holy ghost watch this
[30:23] the prophet says this
[30:24] says now we're going to have a revival
[30:27] and i say amen to that we're going to
[30:30] have a revival
[30:31] now watch this real close now you
[30:33] ministers we're
[30:35] fixing a revival all right or maybe
[30:38] we're just having regular church service
[30:40] the church is on fire it says it should
[30:43] be all the time
[30:44] well maybe we got five or six people
[30:46] that's gifted people
[30:48] one speaks with tongs two or three
[30:51] maybe speaks with uh speaks with tongs
[30:53] four or five
[30:54] with tongues got the gift of tongues
[30:56] speaking in unknown tongues
[30:58] two or three of them can't interpret
[31:00] maybe there's one
[31:01] two or three of them that's got the
[31:02] gifts of wisdom
[31:04] it says all right they all meet those
[31:06] gifted people
[31:08] them gifts are given to you not to play
[31:11] with
[31:12] not to say glory to god i speak with
[31:14] tongues hallelujah
[31:15] you're degrading yourself now that
[31:17] that's that's a very important statement
[31:19] that he makes out of questions and
[31:21] answers on the holy ghost he says
[31:22] you're degrading yourself right when you
[31:25] when you say
[31:26] i got this gift amen uh hallelujah
[31:29] uh glory to god i speak with tongues
[31:32] hallelujah i got when you when you do it
[31:33] that way you actually degrade yourself
[31:36] i want to put it this way when you lift
[31:38] yourself up
[31:40] you actually bring yourself down
[31:44] i'm just saying like that when you lift
[31:47] yourself up you actually bring
[31:51] yourself down
[31:54] hallelujah now i mean the way that a the
[31:57] way the scripture tells that a man's
[32:00] gift will make room for itself
[32:03] that means you never have to do anything
[32:05] to promote yourself
[32:07] you never have to do it people will
[32:09] people will come to you rather than you
[32:10] having to go to the people oh glory to
[32:12] god
[32:13] it's the truth anyhow the truth i mean
[32:16] uh
[32:18] lord knows the lord knows i mean it's
[32:20] just you know uh
[32:21] my my my personal experience is that you
[32:24] know i you don't have to call
[32:26] you know uh and just beg people for you
[32:29] know give me an opportunity you ain't
[32:31] got to do none of that
[32:32] i mean people will call you
[32:35] glory to god people will call you they
[32:38] say no it's a gift in your life brother
[32:40] we want that to go forth
[32:41] do you mind coming to do this people
[32:43] will call you
[32:44] amen hallelujah
[32:48] when you're you're you says uh you're
[32:50] degrading yourself
[32:52] they're given to you to work with and
[32:54] your part in the church
[32:56] should come before the main service
[32:57] starts because the unlearned is going to
[32:59] be among us now he's talking about
[33:01] you know the gift of speaking in tongues
[33:02] and interpreting and all of that but now
[33:04] but we're using this same structure
[33:07] amen even here and when it did when
[33:09] we're dealing with dreams he says
[33:11] then you get off into a room and you sat
[33:13] there you people together

[33:28] amen one gift does not dominate all the
[33:31] other gifts
[33:33] amen i mean if we get it that way
[33:36] then uh you know it goes back to what
[33:38] paul was saying about the body
[33:39] you know we got all these different
[33:40] parts to the body if uh i mean
[33:43] my my head can be the intelligence
[33:47] and it can guide the body but my head
[33:48] can't pick up nothing
[33:50] my head can't can't walk me around and
[33:53] carry me come on praise the lord
[33:55] it can be the intelligence but i still

[34:53] lord what is it

[35:37] you know um uh the gift of prophecy and
[35:40] speaking in tongues
[35:41] this is the way that they're supposed to

[35:47] your knees
[35:48] sit up and just sit there singing songs
[35:50] praying and just waiting on the lord
[35:52] and don't try to make it up now the
[35:54] other thing you say do this before the
[35:56] service do this
[35:58] now that does not mean that people can't
[36:00] have a you know
[36:01] like a few weeks ago we had somebody
[36:03] speak in tongues uh
[36:04] and then interpretation before that was
[36:06] perfectly fine
[36:07] that was pretty it was after the word of
[36:09] god had gone for
[36:11] i mean everything was in order i felt in
[36:14] that situation now
[36:15] you know i'm saying people that that
[36:16] that do this all the time you know you
[36:18] got the gift of tongues you know you got
[36:19] to get the interpretation
[36:20] if you know that come early praise god
[36:23] come early
[36:24] and i find that people that's not able
[36:26] to subject themselves
[36:28] to what the prophet has actually said
[36:30] something wrong with their gift
[36:33] amen something wrong with the gift all
[36:36] right
[36:37] i want you to remember this the prophet
[36:38] said there must be three people with
[36:40] discernment
[36:41] to confirm whether the prophecy was of
[36:44] the lord
[36:45] or not we're using the same approach
[36:47] with dreams
[36:48] and the interpretation of dreams uh
[36:50] we're using people with the spirit of
[36:52] discernment
[36:54] that can confirm uh confirm or at least
[36:57] give us the interpretation of what that
[36:58] dream is
[36:59] praise the lord now here um
[37:02] uh let me just uh just drop this in
[37:06] another little quote just to confirm
[37:08] that what i just said this is how the
[37:09] message influenced
[37:10] uh paragraph 672. uh brother branham
[37:13] says this we found out
[37:15] that this king uzziah was a shepherd boy
[37:17] in the days of isaiah the prophet isaiah
[37:19] was a prophet
[37:20] prophets are born they just not they
[37:24] just not laying their hands on them and
[37:25] making them prophets
[37:27] they are born for ordained of god now
[37:29] i'm gonna i said this last week and i'll
[37:31] say this again right now
[37:32] uh when people don't want to subject
[37:35] their gift to spirits of discernment
[37:38] the first thing they'll do is claim that
[37:41] their profit now they have to be careful
[37:43] when they claim i'm a prophet the reason
[37:46] they have to be careful because we
[37:47] know what a real prophet is
[37:51] praise the lord we know what a real
[37:53] prophet is so that's why they they won't
[37:55] just come out and say
[37:56] i'm a prophet they won't just use the
[37:58] word that they'll say it like this i
[38:00] mean just be honest
[38:02] i gotta gift what gift
[38:07] come on church i got a gift
[38:11] what gift yeah praise the lord if you
[38:14] say you got a gift to play piano we
[38:15] gonna
[38:16] put you behind the piano praise the lord
[38:19] and see whether you really got a gift
[38:22] if you're just up there banging like the
[38:24] the chip the the chimp or whatever the
[38:26] chimpanzee was banging on sunday
[38:28] amen if you banging like that it's not a
[38:30] gift
[38:33] glory to god church right and maybe you
[38:36] just took a few lessons you might be
[38:37] able to
[38:38] you know help that but but don't claim
[38:40] that you got a gift and really can't
[38:41] identify
[38:43] yeah hallelujah amen it's
[38:46] your gift i got a gift to do this i got
[38:48] you know what is the gift
[38:51] well i'm just waiting on the lord to
[38:52] reveal it to you
[38:59] well what if i tell you god didn't
[39:00] reveal nothing to me
[39:03] do you still have a gift right amen
[39:06] church
[39:07] right so so look we're just trying to
[39:09] bring some order
[39:10] right structure we we accept it we
[39:14] we we i believe you got a gift but it's
[39:16] just got to be done the right way
[39:17] and if you really got to give your
[39:19] subject the spirit of the prophets is
[39:20] subject
[39:22] to the prophets so here i i
[39:25] as the prophet and priests of the house
[39:27] i'm just trying to establish
[39:30] how we want to do things so so god can
[39:33] be glorified in our midst amen amen
[39:36] brother random says it's um prophets are
[39:39] born they're just not
[39:40] they're just not laying their hands on
[39:41] them and making them profits they are
[39:43] born for ordained of god gifts and calls
[39:45] are without repentance there is
[39:46] a gift of prophecy in the church
[39:49] and it must be judged
[39:53] by three people before the voice should
[39:56] ever be heard amongst the congregation
[39:58] amen
[40:00] can i say that again the prophet gave
[40:03] some structure
[40:04] it must be judged
[40:08] by three people glory to god now that
[40:11] don't mean you go firing three people
[40:13] that you don't told it to but they
[40:15] judging it how i know they got the
[40:17] spirit of discernment
[40:18] they might just be doing that because
[40:20] they don't want to tell you that you're
[40:21] wrong
[40:23] amen but no no you just submit it and
[40:26] then just wait to see what god said
[40:27] about it
[40:29] now against the prophecy in the church
[40:31] and it must be judged by three people
[40:33] before the voice should ever be heard
[40:35] amongst the congregation
[40:37] but that's just a gift of prophecy but a
[40:40] prophet is absolutely ordained with thus
[40:42] saith the lord
[40:43] from childhood up glory to god
[40:48] amen amen and we already know ain't no
[40:51] other uh
[40:52] messengers coming we already know that
[40:55] right so so when you when you go claim
[40:57] around i'm a prophet i'm a prophet
[40:59] you know you mean you got the spirit of
[41:00] prophecy that's what
[41:02] that's what you're really trying to tell
[41:03] us amen i mean you know
[41:08] some people just want titles right i
[41:11] mean
[41:12] you know and they just want you to call
[41:14] them by the
[41:15] title my god i mean
[41:19] i i i don't see so much you just you
[41:22] know
[41:22] you got to have this time you got to be
[41:24] you know uh
[41:25] made something before the people and
[41:27] that's if you're doing it that way
[41:29] you're doing it
[41:29] you're doing it for the wrong reasons
[41:31] amen
[41:32] i was talking to somebody they felt that
[41:34] there was an apostle
[41:36] is that right you know what an apostle
[41:38] does
[41:39] it's not just in the title that you wear
[41:41] you know what apostle does
[41:43] apostle goes and establishes churches
[41:46] establish one here
[41:47] get it up and running and then leave it
[41:50] and then go on to the next city
[41:52] and not just leave it he leave it uh
[41:54] with a structure
[41:55] right right so a pastor can carry on
[41:58] with the people yeah
[41:59] right it says apostle you just don't
[42:01] claim to claim that you're an apostle
[42:03] you ain't established not one church
[42:05] no you can't do that praise the lord
[42:08] now in denomination you can be whatever
[42:10] you want to be
[42:11] but here we're not just giving out
[42:13] titles
[42:15] glory to god we're not giving out
[42:16] flattery of titles
[42:19] amen all right
[42:22] i'm going on a little further so the the
[42:25] structures
[42:26] submit the dream now i'm not saying
[42:28] every dream cause some dreams just
[42:30] pertaining to you
[42:32] and god just wanna deal with you you
[42:33] ain't gotta like brother trevor came up
[42:35] here and
[42:35] had that dream that you know uh uh and
[42:38] he actually he didn't think it was a
[42:39] dream that came from god so he had to
[42:41] rebuke it
[42:42] he had to rebuke everything that come
[42:44] from god right
[42:45] so so some dreams what i'm saying things
[42:48] that might pertain to the church
[42:50] amen and then maybe it's somebody in the
[42:53] church you know something that might
[42:54] contain
[42:54] just submit it and then can i put it
[42:57] this way submit it and commit it
[43:00] once you submit it just leave it alone
[43:02] amen glory to god
[43:05] hallelujah
[43:10] sometimes we might not get
[43:11] interpretation right away and i want to
[43:12] show i want to just tell you we got to
[43:14] wait on the lord
[43:15] on everything submit it and you can
[43:17] submit it by via text by
[43:19] email whatsapp just just get it to me
[43:22] and then i got uh people that i feel
[43:25] that god has given the spirit of
[43:26] discernment
[43:27] i submit it to them we pray over it
[43:30] together
[43:31] and we just see what the lord says about
[43:32] it right but now there's some dreams
[43:34] that may come
[43:35] and there might not be an interpretation
[43:38] and i'm going to read to you a little
[43:40] testimony from brother branham
[43:41] of what happened in his ministry see
[43:44] look
[43:45] uh in pentecost you know they made vote
[43:48] prophesied
[43:50] i saw it happening at a grocery store
[43:52] i'm just what is this we are here
[43:54] shopping and this lady saw this guy that
[43:56] i guess that coming to church said oh
[43:58] man of god man of god went and stopped
[44:02] shopping for groceries went and grabbed
[44:03] his hand said give me a word give me a
[44:05] word

[44:08] grocery store
[44:09] give me a word just making this man
[44:11] prophesy
[44:13] the spirit was not even annoying uh only
[44:15] anointing him to prophesy
[44:16] he just start coming up with something
[44:18] right there on the spot to satisfy this
[44:20] lady people don't even know how this
[44:23] works you don't just
[44:24] you don't walk up to nobody give me a
[44:26] word give me a word like brother brandon
[44:27] say
[44:28] how many can i just tell dream your
[44:29] dream right now no you might be a
[44:31] dreamer but you got to wait for god to
[44:33] give you a dream
[44:35] praise god amen you might be a somebody
[44:38] that has a spirit of prophecy but you
[44:39] got to wait for god to give you a
[44:41] prophecy
[44:42] amen
[44:45] look at this he says uh in the message
[44:47] influence paragraph 105.
[44:50] was that a little girl come to me the
[44:51] other day she may be said and present
[44:53] now
[44:54] she said brother branham i give you a
[44:56] dream now she was upset
[44:58] with the prophet because she had given
[45:00] him a dream he never gave an
[45:01] interpretation
[45:02] he it says brother branham i give you a
[45:05] dream
[45:06] and in this dream i had a certain thing
[45:08] now can you imagine maybe her going to
[45:10] church and hearing him
[45:11] interpret other people's dreams but
[45:13] never interpreting her dream
[45:15] now she began to take an offense
[45:18] like was the gift given to you for you
[45:21] to take an offense
[45:22] or was the gift given to you for you to
[45:24] help magnify the body
[45:27] right look he says uh i get she said uh
[45:29] brother brandon i get i gave you a dream
[45:31] in this dream i had a certain thing i
[45:33] want you
[45:35] to tell me i sat down now if there's any
[45:40] out in here outside of the pentecost
[45:42] room let me excuse myself to you a
[45:44] moment
[45:45] says she said you never told me my dream
[45:48] i said honey just set down just a minute
[45:52] i said your father and mother are very
[45:55] good friends of mine
[45:56] retired farmers who came from a long
[45:59] ways
[46:00] to sojourn with us
[46:03] oh lord help us and and i want to tell
[46:06] y'all
[46:07] if you want to be credible i'm going to
[46:09] say this again submit the dream
[46:12] beforehand
[46:14] what doesn't happen also recently is
[46:16] that people that already made a decision
[46:19] and then they tell me the dream that
[46:21] that helped them make their decision
[46:24] and when i hear that i mean you you
[46:27] didn't want
[46:28] me involved in it you didn't want me
[46:30] involved in it so so you already
[46:32] made your decision before anybody can
[46:34] tell you that i don't know if that's
[46:36] even
[46:36] accurate or not
[46:40] and i'm never gonna if you got a
[46:41] decision that you want to make i'm gonna
[46:43] always say god bless you
[46:45] i will not try to force you to make some
[46:47] other decision
[46:49] especially you tell me the lord told you
[46:54] all right that's what the lord told you
[46:56] and that's what the lord i got nothing i
[46:57] can say about that
[46:59] i won't fight with you i won't argue
[47:00] with it i'ma just let it prove i
[47:03] whether it was god or not and i'ma tell
[47:06] you if it don't prove out that it was
[47:07] god
[47:08] i will not be holding it over your head
[47:11] amen i'm trying to help us
[47:15] so that people don't end up in a bad
[47:17] situation all right
[47:19] all right i'm going a little further he
[47:21] says uh
[47:22] uh let let me uh uh it says honey just
[47:25] sit down a minute say i said your father
[47:27] and mother
[47:28] are very good friends of mine retired
[47:29] farmers who came from a long way
[47:31] long ways to join with us and i said
[47:33] they believed me as a servant of christ
[47:35] you're just a child about 12 years old
[47:38] i think she goes to school with my becky
[47:40] and i said look
[47:41] you're going to meet a lot of things out
[47:43] here honey in the name of christianity
[47:46] you're going to meet a lot of things in
[47:48] the name of christianity
[47:50] i said when you find a man that's got
[47:52] every
[47:57] i want to read it again when you find a
[47:59] man
[48:00] that's got every interpretation just
[48:02] like this
[48:04] what he's saying what he's saying saying
[48:06] he ain't praying about it
[48:08] he ain't there ain't nothing he just as
[48:11] soon as you said it i got the
[48:12] interpretation you better
[48:13] watch that
[48:17] oh lord i can just see it right now i
[48:20] see it right now
[48:21] here i'm setting up a structure and then
[48:24] i can see somebody say they ain't
[48:25] getting no interpretation yet
[48:28] you went to the pastor didn't get no
[48:30] interpretation yet
[48:32] what was your dream and then they got it
[48:40] all right i'm just giving you what the
[48:42] prophet said says
[48:43] when you find a man that's got every
[48:45] interpretation just like this
[48:49] he says god every he says uh and he
[48:51] doing like that just like that
[48:53] somebody got interpreted he says just
[48:55] like that in the name of the lord i say
[48:57] you
[48:57] better you be careful about that that's
[49:00] contrary
[49:01] to the scripture jesus said there was
[49:05] many lepers in the days of elijah
[49:07] but only one was sent to him one
[49:10] many widows in the days of elisha but
[49:13] only one was he sent to
[49:15] many things that jesus did not do many
[49:17] times
[49:18] he says those gimmicks that's got every
[49:20] answer
[49:22] be careful
[49:25] when somebody stands up and speaks in
[49:27] the name of the lord
[49:28] that must be true it must be exactly the
[49:32] truth
[49:32] you might in your mind be impressed i
[49:34] said now honey i believe i can tell you
[49:36] what i think you your dream is
[49:38] but to tell you in the name of the lord
[49:40] no sir
[49:43] because she knows the things i said have
[49:45] i ever spoke to you in the name of the
[49:47] lord
[49:47] but what had happened i said thousands
[49:49] has come and said this and that
[49:51] i said i cannot tell you what your dream
[49:53] is till i set
[49:54] said it over again and then he tells me
[49:56] when i can then i can say
[49:58] the lord told me until then i don't know
[50:01] i don't want to make my
[50:02] own influence in my own opinion
[50:07] i can't say thus saith the lord because
[50:09] that's me thinking it that's the best of
[50:11] my opinion
[50:12] uh we must be sincere because we got the
[50:15] greatest
[50:16] thing in the world
[50:19] the greatest treasure of heaven
[50:22] is christ among us
[50:25] the greatest treasure of heaven is
[50:28] actually having christ
[50:29] in our midst and that's all we want is
[50:33] christ
[50:34] we don't want to see nobody flesh
[50:37] we just want to see jesus
[50:43] you you always i mean quick quick
[50:45] interpretations there's something wrong
[50:47] with that
[50:48] somebody you go to they go you go to
[50:50] them they always got something to say
[50:51] there's a spirit there there's a spirit
[50:55] there
[50:56] because even the prophet didn't handle
[50:58] himself that way
[51:00] and the prophet just even just gave a
[51:01] scripture
[51:03] jesus didn't have himself that way
[51:04] either glory to god so anytime you see
[51:07] that you know
[51:08] there's something wrong with that spirit
[51:14] all right i want to just say a couple
[51:18] more things here
[51:20] ultimately okay no no no
[51:23] let me finish reading that quote it says
[51:25] we must be sincere
[51:28] because we got the greatest thing in the
[51:29] world the greatest treasure of heaven
[51:31] is christ among us why do we want to
[51:34] substitute
[51:36] some little influence to try to make
[51:38] ourselves somebody big
[51:39] among somebody here and that's what
[51:42] happens when a person
[51:44] is giving interpretations all the time
[51:45] what they're trying to do is make
[51:46] themselves
[51:47] bigger he says why not be humble
[51:50] be a humble servant to christ
[51:54] i want to say this ultimately we want to
[51:56] see how the dream compares with the word
[52:00] everything must run through the filter
[52:03] of the word
[52:05] see the lord established the process for
[52:07] us as we have
[52:09] dreamed uh dreamers interpreters of
[52:11] dreams in our midst
[52:13] and i just feel glad to start slow with
[52:15] this and pray about how to expand it
[52:17] over time so
[52:18] this starting slow is submit your dream
[52:21] via text by email whatsapp
[52:24] send it to me you know and and you know
[52:27] i've had people
[52:28] uh and you know uh you know they'll come
[52:31] right into my office i want to tell you
[52:33] a dream
[52:34] the reason i'm actually not to do it
[52:36] that way is because
[52:38] i am taking the dream to somebody else
[52:41] and if you tell it to me
[52:42] uh i actually may forget some of the
[52:44] parts that you're telling me i got a lot
[52:46] of things
[52:48] in my head a lot going on in my head so
[52:51] just by telling me i just i just want to
[52:52] get some
[52:53] okay type it up
[52:57] write it down submit it so i can get it
[53:00] to others
[53:01] praise the lord that's all i'm actually
[53:03] to do right uh
[53:04] uh uh it just makes it so much easier
[53:07] when we follow the process but
[53:08] you know i don't want people to be
[53:09] offended you know because you know you
[53:12] come to me and brother jack didn't take
[53:13] my dream no
[53:14] no you don't understand i i can't do it
[53:17] like that
[53:18] i can't have the whole church busting to
[53:20] my office with dreams
[53:22] and then i sit there trying to interpret
[53:23] that that ain't gonna work
[53:26] that ain't gonna work that that'd just
[53:27] be a you don't want a church like that
[53:30] and you also don't want to be where you
[53:31] just depending on one man in the church
[53:33] you don't want that's why god gives
[53:35] these other gifts to the church
[53:37] let's use what god has given us so the
[53:39] the process
[53:40] or the structure is when you have it
[53:44] submit it don't don't try to interpret
[53:46] it just by yourself
[53:47] because some people do that and they
[53:49] actually have the wrong interpretation
[53:51] but see what happens you don't interpret
[53:53] it by yourself
[53:55] you got the wrong interpretation and you
[53:56] have already made up your mind before
[53:58] you even talk to me
[54:01] i'm telling the truth you already made
[54:04] up your mind
[54:05] so if you don't made up your mind what
[54:06] can i do because if
[54:08] i actually say well i don't think that's
[54:10] in the word now that's gonna
[54:12] look real bad it's just me against you
[54:14] now i don't want to do it that way
[54:15] and if if you want to be taken credible
[54:19] submit it let's get it amongst these
[54:22] people with the spirit of discernment
[54:23] and let's see what the lord say through
[54:25] them
[54:25] and then we get it back to you now if
[54:27] they don't get anything
[54:30] you just gotta wait on god you can't get
[54:32] upset and say damn gave me nothing ain't
[54:34] got the spirit of discernment
[54:35] no maybe your dream didn't mean nothing
[54:41] amen church that may be the reason they
[54:44] ain't got nothing because it didn't mean
[54:45] nothing
[54:46] now because sometimes we want it to mean
[54:48] something
[54:49] oh glory yeah i mean you've been you you
[54:52] you already have
[54:53] a leading to do something or
[54:56] let me put this away you already have a
[54:58] desire to do a particular thing
[55:00] and you're gonna use the dream as
[55:03] something to
[55:04] uh justify and validate and vindicate
[55:08] what you already wanted to do
[55:10] let's let's try that spirit by putting
[55:12] it underneath
[55:13] the spirit of discernment
[55:16] all right send your dream via text
[55:19] email whatsapp and i'm saying only if
[55:22] it's something that deals with the
[55:23] church or something
[55:25] uh somebody in the church you know if it
[55:26] deals with them you know please please
[55:28] give it to us
[55:29] uh i i we have a couple people that will
[55:31] pray over any dreams of significance
[55:34] to see if the lord gives an
[55:35] interpretation
[55:37] and i said the reason why we got a
[55:38] couple people is because the scripture
[55:40] tells us that out of the mouth of two
[55:42] or three witnesses let every word be
[55:45] established
[55:47] now if they these people with the spirit
[55:49] of discernment
[55:50] come back and that thing is not right
[55:53] you know we got they have to actually
[55:55] pray and get that spirit off of them too
[55:58] if a prophet gives a prophecy and that
[55:59] thing ain't right it don't come to pass
[56:01] you gotta pray to get that spirit off of
[56:03] them
[56:03] if a dreamer gives something and ain't
[56:05] right they gotta pray to get that spirit
[56:07] off because the devil
[56:08] is trying to get in the midst of that
[56:11] amen
[56:14] and i want to say this all also if
[56:16] you're really spiritual
[56:20] because that first thing go through
[56:21] people's mind brother jack said he got
[56:23] two or three people i wonder who the two
[56:24] or three people
[56:26] i'm gonna just i'ma just say this i
[56:27] wrote this down in my notes if you
[56:28] spiritual
[56:30] i'm talking about really spiritual
[56:33] you're not worried about who the people
[56:36] are that's praying over it
[56:40] if you're really spiritual if you
[56:41] colonel that's the way you think
[56:44] but if you're spiritual lord i thank you
[56:47] that we got some type of structure here
[56:49] god that we can
[56:50] we can submit these things and get
[56:51] answers from you god i
[56:53] lord use these gifts that's what
[56:56] spiritual people do carnal people
[56:59] trying to figure out who it is that who
[57:00] who well i want
[57:02] if you want to be there let your gift
[57:04] make room for yourself
[57:06] i told you we starting slow to see how
[57:08] this go
[57:09] and then if it goes well then we'll see
[57:11] how the lord adds to it
[57:13] amen hallelujah
[57:17] i put this if you're spiritual you're
[57:18] not worried about who the people are
[57:20] that are praying over this
[57:21] that actually shows your carnality and
[57:24] demonstrate spiritual
[57:25] immaturity
[57:35] i think i want to read just a couple
[57:36] more um things here this is going to
[57:38] come out of god's gifts always finally
[57:40] places this paragraph 37.
[57:51] i told you god uses dreams as a
[57:55] secondary means to speak to his people
[57:56] his primary way was actually speaking
[57:58] through a
[57:58] prophet revealing the word of god to us
[58:02] and here uh in the message god's gifts
[58:04] always finding places brother branham
[58:06] makes this statement says now the reason
[58:08] it was done then is because there was no
[58:11] prophet in the land at that time so
[58:13] joseph had a dream about taking jesus
[58:16] into egypt
[58:17] joseph's dream fit right back with
[58:19] scripture right
[58:21] but there was no prophet that joseph
[58:23] could take the dream
[58:24] you know to and get an interpretation so
[58:26] god had to give it to him
[58:27] and god had to give him you know just
[58:29] give him make it very plain do this
[58:30] joseph right
[58:32] so it says the reason it was dumb is
[58:33] because there was no
[58:35] in the land of time to interpret the
[58:36] dream see there was no prophet to
[58:39] interpret the dreams like joseph
[58:40] daniel and those prophets of old they
[58:43] hadn't had a prophet for 400 years god
[58:45] used a dream
[58:46] for the welfare of his own child
[58:50] god used his dreams for the welfare of
[58:51] his own child he did he told joseph when
[58:53] he was a just man not
[58:55] willing willingly to make her a public
[58:57] example was minded to put away properly
[58:59] no doubt she told him the visit of
[59:01] gabriel and so forth what he had said
[59:03] but when he saw her to be mother
[59:05] it was too unusual you know it was
[59:07] something very different
[59:08] and you know that's the ma that's what's
[59:10] the matter that god does things unusual
[59:12] and it's so unusual even
[59:14] just man can't see it so in joseph's
[59:17] situation god
[59:18] had to use a dream to actually settle
[59:19] joseph's spirit
[59:21] sometimes things happen in the church
[59:23] and god can use the dream
[59:25] to actually settle people's spirit you
[59:27] know you all
[59:28] when we came before we came to this
[59:30] church
[59:33] i was just really i was debating because
[59:36] i knew that you know
[59:37] the cost of us coming we were getting
[59:40] ready to double amount and rent
[59:41] and we weren't doubling the congregation
[59:43] we had the same amount of people you
[59:46] know getting ready to come in here
[59:47] and we're getting ready to pay double
[59:48] amount of rent so i was very concerned
[59:51] about doing this
[59:52] very concerning i was talking over one
[59:55] of the brothers and
[59:55] and one brother told me he says uh
[59:58] brother jack you're the pastor you don't
[59:59] got to make the decision
[1:00:01] well i i realized that i do understand
[1:00:04] that i said but i'm just looking for
[1:00:05] some type of confirmation and
[1:00:07] also the other thing i'm looking are you
[1:00:08] with me if i make this decision
[1:00:11] that that's what i rather i'm with you
[1:00:14] if you're making that decision i'm
[1:00:15] standing by your side now that means a
[1:00:17] lot more
[1:00:17] than just saying you're the pastor you
[1:00:19] don't got to make the decision yes i i
[1:00:20] realized that
[1:00:24] i was just praying and just waiting and
[1:00:26] i just wasn't gonna make the decision
[1:00:27] just just
[1:00:28] willy-nilly like that you know i just
[1:00:29] lord just help me help me
[1:00:32] and uh brother caleb who has this gift
[1:00:34] of
[1:00:35] you know prophesying he was there
[1:00:37] preaching at the other church
[1:00:38] and he turned to me say brother jack you
[1:00:41] know you lean
[1:00:42] in a certain way on a decision god said
[1:00:44] go forward in that direction he gonna be
[1:00:46] with you
[1:00:46] i just bust out crying i said lord
[1:00:50] that's what i needed to hear
[1:00:51] and and from that i took that word and
[1:00:54] strengthened my faith and i come and
[1:00:56] make the decision
[1:00:57] and i can look back now
[1:01:01] 13 years or more
[1:01:04] i stopped counting i think it's been 13
[1:01:07] years
[1:01:08] god has kept us here not only kept us
[1:01:10] here
[1:01:11] but blessed us in a way uh where we were
[1:01:15] we
[1:01:15] uh we've been able to meet the needs of
[1:01:18] this
[1:01:18] three over three thousand dollar a month
[1:01:21] uh
[1:01:22] rent now some people hear that online
[1:01:24] probably backup yeah
[1:01:27] about 50 people paying almost 4 000 a
[1:01:30] month
[1:01:31] in rent 13 years
[1:01:34] god has met the needs
[1:01:37] 13 years hallelujah
[1:01:41] amen i thank god for you know a word in
[1:01:44] due season
[1:01:45] i thank god that god can use somebody to
[1:01:48] speak just to kind of settle your spirit
[1:01:50] i believe in i believe in those things
[1:01:53] and you want to see it going forth the
[1:01:55] way that god wanted to go forth in the
[1:01:57] church
[1:01:58] praise god god can give somebody dreams
[1:02:00] that the lord just showed me the dream i
[1:02:02] just want to submit this
[1:02:04] dream come to help magnify and edify the
[1:02:07] church
[1:02:08] can i put up can i can i can i put it
[1:02:10] this way as well
[1:02:12] i don't believe god give dreams to come
[1:02:14] divide
[1:02:15] the church
[1:02:18] if you got a dream that's coming to
[1:02:19] divide the church something wrong
[1:02:23] god don't do that god don't god don't
[1:02:26] send it like that to come divide the
[1:02:28] church
[1:02:28] you know and i mean i've heard people
[1:02:31] tell me that there's a black cloud over
[1:02:33] the church
[1:02:34] well black cloud you know that
[1:02:37] and brother branham's ministry you know
[1:02:39] what that meant death
[1:02:41] that's what that's what but now they're
[1:02:42] saying is the black cloud the church
[1:02:43] gonna fall apart
[1:02:44] and it hasn't falled apart i don't know
[1:02:46] when the black cloud left
[1:02:48] i don't even think it came
[1:02:52] but god has been strengthening his
[1:02:53] church and now as we get
[1:02:55] you know we're stepping into the vision
[1:02:58] as we're doing that
[1:02:59] i just want to put some structure around
[1:03:01] this because i i see how the devil is
[1:03:04] also using it
[1:03:05] to bring division gifts are being used
[1:03:09] to bring division
[1:03:11] that's the devil
[1:03:14] that's the devil that's not god
[1:03:17] hey god i i i let me let me let me uh
[1:03:22] i'm gonna share something tonight i'm
[1:03:24] gonna so let me just read this last
[1:03:26] quote i'm gonna just share something
[1:03:29] this is uh this out anointed ones at the
[1:03:32] end time
[1:03:37] i want to show you how deceiving the
[1:03:39] devil is
[1:03:41] one day he was setting in a study talk
[1:03:43] about martin here upcoming mighty angel
[1:03:46] crown on his head golden shoes on on on
[1:03:49] lace around his garments of gold
[1:03:51] said martin do you know me said i am
[1:03:53] your lord and savior i'm the one that
[1:03:55] saved you worship me martin
[1:03:56] but the prophet knowing there was a
[1:03:58] little something strange there he kept
[1:04:00] looking looking at him he said martin
[1:04:03] i'm your savior
[1:04:04] jesus christ worship me don't you know
[1:04:06] me martin
[1:04:07] martin kept looking at him scripture
[1:04:10] running through his mind see that
[1:04:11] he got the filter that thing through the
[1:04:12] scripture
[1:04:15] scripture running through his mind he
[1:04:16] said satan get away from me
[1:04:20] he said you got a crown on your head and
[1:04:22] the word of god says his saints will
[1:04:23] crown him at the end of the age
[1:04:26] wouldn't that have been a pentecost
[1:04:27] debate watch the word
[1:04:29] brother that's where it pays
[1:04:33] and that's what we're doing we're
[1:04:34] watching the word amen
[1:04:36] i'ma say something i don't think i ever
[1:04:38] said this not and i pray that this
[1:04:40] i want to say this but i don't i don't
[1:04:42] want to say it in a way that it hurts
[1:04:44] anybody
[1:04:45] that's that's not my intention you know
[1:04:48] before
[1:04:50] we started spirit and truth tabernacle
[1:04:56] i was going through some things
[1:04:59] spiritually i was in church and even
[1:05:01] though i was in church and not
[1:05:03] necessarily agreeing with everything i
[1:05:04] was going through i stayed
[1:05:05] faithful i stayed committed to the
[1:05:08] church
[1:05:09] even when i didn't agree with everything
[1:05:11] that was going on in the church i was
[1:05:12] still there doing song service
[1:05:15] i never let the people see that there
[1:05:16] was something wrong i just
[1:05:18] whatever there was something wrong i
[1:05:20] tried to take it up with my pastor
[1:05:22] and him alone talked with him alone
[1:05:24] nobody else knew just
[1:05:25] maybe my wife that was it but i kept it
[1:05:27] from the saints
[1:05:29] amen so um
[1:05:33] i remember you know they're they're
[1:05:34] coming time and like i tell you i don't
[1:05:36] dream
[1:05:36] i really don't dream often that's that's
[1:05:38] i'm a hard sleeper
[1:05:40] and uh and when i when i go down that's
[1:05:42] it man somebody can break in my house
[1:05:43] and
[1:05:44] they would the the the the whoever was
[1:05:46] robbing the house they'd have to wake me
[1:05:48] up and tell me what they was doing
[1:05:49] because i'd be sleep i'd be knocked out
[1:05:52] right so um you know i was uh
[1:05:56] there was one one one morning i was
[1:05:58] sleeping
[1:06:00] and i had this dream and then the dream
[1:06:04] i uh i was in church and you know we
[1:06:07] were
[1:06:08] doing what we normally do i was singing
[1:06:10] a song and something happened in the
[1:06:12] dream and
[1:06:13] i just got i just got to the point where
[1:06:15] i was like i just can't take no more of
[1:06:16] this i
[1:06:18] just i'm tired i just can't take no more
[1:06:20] so when it happened
[1:06:22] you know the pastor was in a dream and
[1:06:24] he walked up to me
[1:06:25] and um and and i just i just just handed
[1:06:28] him the mic
[1:06:36] and um so when i did that in the dream
[1:06:40] physically my telephone started ringing
[1:06:43] there at my house my telephone start
[1:06:45] ringing it was actually my pastor
[1:06:47] calling me from another country
[1:06:51] and he woke me up out of the dream and i
[1:06:52] just handed him
[1:06:55] the mic i say lord i don't know what
[1:06:58] that's all about but for
[1:07:00] for me to hand the mic and he the one
[1:07:02] woke me about the dream i just and i
[1:07:04] ain't telling what the dream was all
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:05] not at that time he calling me i'm guess

[1:07:10] just wait on the lord
[1:07:13] i didn't tell him i just kept kept doing
[1:07:15] what i was doing kept doing
[1:07:16] but then there come a time where i had
[1:07:18] to sit down and just talk to him about
[1:07:19] the dream
[1:07:21] and uh when i talked to him about the
[1:07:22] dream i said you know this is what
[1:07:23] happened
[1:07:24] you know and i i don't know what it all
[1:07:26] mean but i'm just just sharing
[1:07:28] with you and we were talking you say i
[1:07:29] pray i pray that ain't that don't happen
[1:07:31] brother i pray
[1:07:32] i don't i don't know i'm just sharing it
[1:07:33] with you well
[1:07:36] things begin to continue to progress a
[1:07:38] certain way and i just got to the point
[1:07:39] where it's like okay that's
[1:07:40] that's that's it for me i have to make
[1:07:43] my decision i have to
[1:07:44] i have to leave and um and i did
[1:07:48] i had no idea that we were gonna be
[1:07:51] starting
[1:07:52] you know the way we're starting uh now i
[1:07:54] didn't i i didn't know what was
[1:07:56] i didn't know what was happening i was
[1:07:57] just i was completely lost
[1:07:59] i was i was at a loss
[1:08:02] but uh when i made my decision
[1:08:06] all of a sudden two other people come to
[1:08:09] me
[1:08:10] one brother come to me say brother jack
[1:08:12] i had a dream
[1:08:13] what was your dream he says in the dream
[1:08:15] we were doing this we was doing that and
[1:08:17] then the voice of spirit
[1:08:18] the voice lord told me that brother
[1:08:20] jackie quit
[1:08:22] say brother jackie quit brother jackie
[1:08:24] quit i said what
[1:08:25] he said he say now i see that since
[1:08:28] you're not coming to the church anymore
[1:08:29] now
[1:08:29] understand what the dream was telling me
[1:08:31] that you quit coming to the church
[1:08:34] so well that was i had and i ain't tell
[1:08:37] him my dream and i
[1:08:38] now see i could have right you know what
[1:08:40] the lord showed me
[1:08:42] i ain't saying nothing to him i just let
[1:08:45] him share with me
[1:08:46] then i found out another sister that was
[1:08:48] coming to the church
[1:08:50] uh she had a dream about me and she said
[1:08:53] i was
[1:08:53] inside the church and all of a sudden i
[1:08:54] got pushed on the outside of the church
[1:08:57] when i got pushed on the outside of the
[1:08:58] church i was pushed down on the ground
[1:09:00] and i and i got
[1:09:02] got up off the ground dust myself off
[1:09:04] and i went trying to force my way back
[1:09:06] into the church and she said she said
[1:09:09] but i just saw you got you got put
[1:09:11] out
[1:09:12] now
[1:09:16] jesus got put out of the church it's the
[1:09:19] word that puts you out i hope you can
[1:09:21] agree between the lines it's the word
[1:09:22] that does that
[1:09:24] so when when when i heard about her
[1:09:26] dream
[1:09:27] and i heard the other brother's dream
[1:09:29] and i had my own dream
[1:09:31] out of the mouth of two or three
[1:09:33] witnesses
[1:09:35] let every word be established
[1:09:40] and there i could i could i could stand
[1:09:42] on something
[1:09:43] i could understand that where i'm at is
[1:09:46] where god wants me to be at but i didn't
[1:09:48] just move because i had my own single
[1:09:50] dream
[1:09:51] and i moved when i got the dream i
[1:09:53] waited
[1:09:54] on the lord i was faithful until god
[1:09:58] said otherwise
[1:10:03] and i've seen god bless that all these
[1:10:06] years
[1:10:06] even now some of y'all i mean i'm going
[1:10:08] what 18 years nine 18 years of ministry
[1:10:11] and i ain't really shared that with
