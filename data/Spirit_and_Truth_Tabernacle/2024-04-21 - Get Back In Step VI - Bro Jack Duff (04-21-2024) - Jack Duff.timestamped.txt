[33:45] for Pakistan um we got a request from a
[33:48] u Pastor
[33:50] s ego Fellowship group and they needed
[33:54] some Bibles right and so it's a lot of
[33:57] um
[33:58] um countries out there not I guess
[34:02] um third world countries you would to
[34:05] say that needs um Bibles so they send in
[34:09] requests and we sent them
[34:11] $175 for some
[34:14] Bibles next
[34:16] slide and we got a request from a
[34:19] Jamaica Pastor who asked help to
[34:21] complete their Church floor they

[36:25] concrete they're pouring the concrete
[36:28] hopefully the other one will
[36:32] play this one's kind
[36:42] of
[36:44] okay next slide
[36:47] um in this one I wanted to um let you
[36:51] hear on the why Vision books right and
[36:56] what's the impact and
[36:58] this is Brother coffee talking hopefully
[37:01] that will
[37:04] play
[37:24] MH no
[37:27] oh my I'm sorry well basically he's he's
[37:33] talking through um the need
[37:37] for um message
[37:40] books um being
[37:43] published
[37:44] because
[37:47] um in countries
[37:50] that
[37:52] um don't have access to message books
[37:58] and as a result of that
[38:02] um message um Vision books was started
[38:07] right because there's a need for for
[38:09] books in remote
[38:12] areas in those remote areas don't have
[38:17] um access to well maybe even electricity
[38:21] or digital means of playing it on your
[38:25] phone or tablets and stuff those kind of
[38:27] things so as a result of that Vision
[38:30] books was created to fulfill that need
[38:34] and also there's needs for um there was
[38:39] a story he was telling about a uh a
[38:42] pastor who had he did have um a phone
[38:48] but he did not have a a Bible actual
[38:51] Bible so he would kind of use his phone
[38:54] um and but just to have a Bible to
[38:58] preach from he did not have it so um as
[39:02] a result of that um he asked us to help
[39:06] him with some Bibles and stuff so we
[39:08] send um 300 a month uh for uh support
[39:13] for vision Vision books and so we
[39:17] contribute to the overall mission of
[39:20] vision books we do um um the we print
[39:24] the books in English and in m multiple
[39:28] different
[39:29] languages um for like for Zimbabwe you
[39:33] would have it you have a Pakistanian
[39:35] language you have India you have
[39:39] AOS um so it's a whole different
[39:44] um
[39:45] um experience when you get actually get
[39:49] the message printed in your own
[39:52] language
[39:54] um they also uh we also do
[39:58] um um pictures like there's a Hoffman
[40:02] head of Christ we send um that picture
[40:05] over as well and we also are a um a
[40:09] repository in terms of um individuals
[40:14] who have a a burden to support other
[40:17] countries and we have those individuals
[40:20] but they don't have the means to print
[40:22] and so in one instance there was u a
[40:25] brother he was printing
[40:27] um I believe it
[40:29] was uh message books or a Bible and it
[40:32] cost them $9 a
[40:35] book but through um Vision books we're
[40:39] able to print the same book for 38 cents
[40:42] a
[40:44] book so we have that c c u capability um
[40:48] and sources to use to uh be able to do
[40:51] that and brother Barry talks about that
[40:54] in this in this
[40:56] video that we can't hear okay so the
[41:00] next the next slide um I don't know if
[41:04] they can play this one this is actually
[41:07] uh um a group of Believers in um Uganda
[41:11] who were receiving their
[41:13] Bibles and they were very
[41:17] elated just a whole I mean we sit and we
[41:20] have Bibles all over and we can go to
[41:23] different stores and but in these
[41:26] countries it the they don't have that
[41:29] right they don't have that um that
[41:30] access so when they get those Bibles and
[41:33] we just send them you know by you know
[41:36] people donate to Vision books and we
[41:38] just able to use those funds to um send
[41:43] Bibles we send a lot of Bibles to
[41:44] Zimbabwe as well um so but this is just
[41:49] one here of people praising the Lord for
[41:52] being able to receive um
[41:56] Bibles I think that's the last right
[42:02] yep praise the

[52:11] grateful for the the the youth
[52:13] Fellowship that happened on yesterday I

[52:21] really nice so happy about that I
[52:24] appreciate the specials this morning
[52:26] from uh sister Abby and sister Shalom
[52:28] praise the Lord God bless you and and uh
[52:31] the wonderful um update that we have on
[52:34] what we're doing in
[52:37] missions um it's just a it's a blessing
[52:40] to be able to kind of
[52:41] see how other people benefit uh from
[52:45] things and just if you're not a part of
[52:48] Missions what what we ask is that you
[52:50] try to give $25 a month towards that
[52:54] right and $25 a month some sometimes
[52:56] supports a whole family to be able to do
[52:58] Mission work and uh so if you wouldn't
[53:01] mind amen and just think about half a
[53:04] tank of gas amen just give it to the
[53:07] Lord and uh let somebody be blessed all
[53:09] over the world with that
[53:11] $25 amen musicians I'm I'm I'm done I'm
[53:14] going let y'all be seated uh I'm going
[53:16] back to Joel uh this morning and um I
[53:20] think I had oh oh um uh brother Troy I I
[53:25] did need to mention you know he was
[53:27] telling a testimony to me on Friday
[53:29] night he was um at work and had a um it
[53:35] was uh almost a a tragic accident uh and
[53:40] so they're still you know he's there
[53:42] this morning just trying to take care of
[53:43] some things but he they had this big big
[53:45] job planned and and he said there was
[53:47] like
[53:48] 13,000 vots or something like that
[53:51] coming through and uh they were going to
[53:53] be shutting it down to be able to make
[53:55] some changes but one of the guys decided
[53:57] he wanted to start a little early on the
[53:59] project before they could actually shut
[54:01] it down and uh brother tro walked into
[54:04] room and saw what he was doing he's like
[54:06] well okay that you can do that you know
[54:09] just to get prepped and ready and
[54:10] brother tro walked out the room and when
[54:13] he walked out the room he heard a a
[54:16] great
[54:17] explosion and uh and he saw the man
[54:20] running out of there you know and he was
[54:23] just just on fire his arms got you know
[54:26] burned and and uh just just a a really
[54:30] bad thing and and had he not walked out
[54:33] uh he would have been inside the room
[54:36] and uh and the other thing he says that
[54:38] there was 13,000 votes coming through
[54:42] here says but they were it's a transform
[54:44] in that room that kind of steps it down
[54:46] to about 480 and this man got hit on the
[54:49] 480 side rather than the 13,000 side
[54:53] because had he got hit on that side he
[54:56] might not be living uh to tell the story
[54:59] and then had the 13,000 side uh blown to
[55:03] then brother Troy would have been
[55:04] affected by that even on the outside and
[55:07] uh so I told Brother Troy I said see the
[55:09] scripture tells us that the angel of the
[55:12] Lord encampeth round about them that
[55:15] fear Him and deliver them from all their
[55:19] troubles and I say that man got
[55:22] protected by your
[55:24] angel Hallelujah
[55:28] that's yeah that that man was protected
[55:31] because you were there had you not been
[55:33] there who knows would have happened but
[55:36] because there was a greater power than
[55:38] 13,000 votes your angel was there to
[55:42] stop that so we thank the Lord for
[55:44] watching over our brother amen and and
[55:47] bringing him through praise the
[55:50] Lord and I don't believe it was his
[55:53] coworker it was a a vendor uh that was
[55:56] doing the work so uh we want to pray for
[55:58] that that gentleman that God would just
[56:00] touch him and bring him uh healing to
[56:02] his body and may he come to realize that
[56:04] it was nothing but the grace of God Amen
[56:08] uh that kept him from that moment praise
[56:11] the Lord so continue to keep brother
[56:13] Troy in prayer uh we'll we'll read here
[56:17] uh Joel 1 and uh verse 4 it
[56:22] says that which the palom orth left hath
[56:25] the low conceit and that which the
[56:27] Locust have left have the cankerworm
[56:29] eaten that which the cankerworm have
[56:31] left have the caterpillar eaten and uh
[56:34] over at Joel
[56:36] 2 praise the Lord uh y'all y'all
[56:39] probably going by the time this year is
[56:41] over y'all going to know the scripture
[56:42] by heart I want you to know it by heart
[56:45] too cuz I was telling some of my
[56:47] brothers there's so many little things
[56:49] in here and we going to take our time
[56:51] and get every one of them out of there
[56:53] every little nugget we can and we're
[56:55] going to polish it up but I I I I am one
[56:58] that believes that it's not just
[57:00] something on the pages of the Bible but
[57:03] we are living it right before our very
[57:06] eyes amen it's being expressed uh right
[57:09] here in our midst so we thank God uh
[57:12] here in in Joel 2 and uh verse uh 23 it
[57:17] says be
[57:18] glad uh then ye children of Zion and
[57:21] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[57:23] given you the former Reign moderately
[57:25] and he will cause to come down for you
[57:26] the rain the former rain and the latter
[57:29] rain in the first month and the floors
[57:31] shall be full of Wheat and the fats
[57:33] shall overflow with wine and oil and I
[57:35] will restore to you the years that the
[57:39] Locust have eaten uh the canker worm and
[57:42] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my
[57:44] great Army which I sent among you and
[57:47] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[57:48] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[57:52] uh that have dealt um wondrously with
[57:55] you my people should never be ashamed
[57:57] and ye shall know that I am in the midst
[57:59] of Israel and that I am the Lord your
[58:01] God and none else and my people shall
[58:03] never be asham amen let's just uh have a
[58:07] brief word of
[58:08] prayer praise the
[58:13] Lord father we are again grateful for
[58:16] the privilege and opportunity we have to
[58:18] open scripture but we know it takes the
[58:20] Holy Ghost to make the word live uh for
[58:24] the time in which we're living so God
[58:26] take control over our thoughts may you
[58:29] present what you want to your people and
[58:32] God we uh just ask that you get all the
[58:34] glory we thank you for watching over
[58:35] brother Troy uh on the job it could have
[58:39] been another way but God you protected
[58:41] him and and showed Lord that you are uh
[58:45] Jehovah nii and um God we just ask that
[58:49] uh the the man that was impacted by this
[58:52] that you would bring healing to his body
[58:53] not just to his body but also to his
[58:55] soul

[59:46] journey this
[59:48] morning and get back and
[59:51] step praise the Lord all right so so
[59:57] um I read the scripture and uh the last
[1:00:03] time we were together I started on a
[1:00:05] little journey that I want to
[1:00:08] continue uh uh
[1:00:11] today praise the Lord and um
[1:00:18] this I want to go forward I read this
[1:00:21] other scripture here in Joel and and you
[1:00:23] know it was a blessing i was um after we
[1:00:27] we kind of shared this we were talking
[1:00:29] about the the the sign in the heaven uh
[1:00:32] that was going to happen with that
[1:00:33] eclipse and uh brother um Frankie had
[1:00:37] sent to me a uh clip after the service
[1:00:41] he said that uh that Eclipse was running
[1:00:45] through uh Seven Cities that had the
[1:00:49] name
[1:00:51] ninova uh and uh you know and and I'm
[1:00:55] like wow that so I you know you have to
[1:00:57] fact check things so I fact checked it
[1:01:00] and and it was right it was seven seven
[1:01:03] different cities um that was you know
[1:01:06] that that that Eclipse was passing
[1:01:07] through that had the name Nineveh and uh
[1:01:11] you know and I don't think those things
[1:01:12] happen by chance or by accident you know
[1:01:15] we know that um um that's the city that
[1:01:19] the prophet Joel was supposed to go to
[1:01:21] uh um not Joel the prophet Jonah was
[1:01:26] supposed to go to Nineveh but he chose
[1:01:28] to try to go to Tarsus uh but
[1:01:30] nonetheless he did make it to Nineveh he
[1:01:34] got there by the mouth of a fish or the
[1:01:37] belly of a whale but he made it to
[1:01:39] Nineveh uh uh just like God uh ordained
[1:01:43] for him to go now I'm going tell you
[1:01:45] something you can either either do it
[1:01:48] your way or you can do it God's way but
[1:01:53] ultimately it's going to get
[1:01:56] done praise the Lord amen you can run
[1:02:00] but you can't hide amen and and and and
[1:02:03] and and and and Jonah learned that
[1:02:06] lesson and uh I believe we got a lot of
[1:02:08] Jonas
[1:02:09] today glory to God Amen trying to get
[1:02:13] the tarses but you better get yourself
[1:02:15] to Nineveh you better catch a boat or a
[1:02:18] plane or else you're going to go through
[1:02:20] the belly of a well but you're going to
[1:02:23] Nineveh amen but we we thank the Lord
[1:02:25] for that but uh but uh I wanted to just
[1:02:28] kind of bring this in we read this
[1:02:29] scripture uh the last time and it shall
[1:02:31] come to pass afterward this is the
[1:02:33] continuation of the Book of Joel uh
[1:02:35] chapter 2 and it shall come to pass
[1:02:36] after that I will pour out my spirit
[1:02:39] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:02:41] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:02:43] shall dream dreams and your young men
[1:02:44] shall see Visions now let me let me just
[1:02:46] uh pause I want you to understand verse
[1:02:49] 28 is a part of the
[1:02:52] restoration Oh Glory to God brother we
[1:02:55] come here on Wednesday night we was not
[1:02:58] expecting that brother to pass through
[1:03:01] but they called me and then we said we
[1:03:03] made a quick decision say let them come
[1:03:05] and my
[1:03:07] God uh what an anointing struck this
[1:03:10] little place here on Wednesday
[1:03:13] night and I left here with an
[1:03:17] expectation that God's word is going to
[1:03:19] be made manifest right here in our midst
[1:03:22] uh but I need to help you to understand
[1:03:24] that before these things can be fully
[1:03:27] released amen there are some things that
[1:03:30] must be
[1:03:31] handled right because all we're doing is
[1:03:34] hindering the the the the presence of
[1:03:35] God and the spirit of God uh when we
[1:03:37] don't handle these little things amen
[1:03:40] but but here's a promise from God it
[1:03:42] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[1:03:46] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:03:49] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:03:53] prophesy amen your old men shall dream
[1:03:56] dreams your young men shall see visions
[1:03:58] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:04:00] handmades in those days will I pour out
[1:04:02] my spirit amen and I will show wonders
[1:04:05] in the heavens and in the earth blood
[1:04:06] and fire and pillars of smoke the sun
[1:04:08] shall be turned into darkness and the
[1:04:10] moon into blood before the great and
[1:04:12] terrible day of the Lord come and it
[1:04:13] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:04:15] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[1:04:16] delivered for in Mount Zion and the
[1:04:18] Jerusalem shall be deliverance and let
[1:04:20] me just add this and in spirit and Truth
[1:04:23] Tabernacle amen shall be Deliverance
[1:04:26] as the Lord have said and in the remnant
[1:04:28] whom the Lord shall call I believe that
[1:04:30] if you got a problem you can't solve
[1:04:33] amen bring it to Jesus cuz he can fix it
[1:04:36] glory to God I believe that so these are
[1:04:38] promises that we have and uh we're
[1:04:40] holding on with everything we have this
[1:04:42] is all part of the restoration now I'm
[1:04:44] going to go real quick at the beginning
[1:04:46] here because this is um uh just
[1:04:49] reminding you some of the things that we
[1:04:51] have talked about so we we talked about
[1:04:53] the four stages of ezekiel's dve bones
[1:04:57] and and also when we're looking at the
[1:04:58] scripture uh of uh our restore sayith
[1:05:02] the Lord the death Messengers were the
[1:05:04] palmerworm amen ate the brotherly love
[1:05:07] and the fruit of the spirit amen the
[1:05:10] Locust ate the leaves of divine
[1:05:14] Fellowship praise God the
[1:05:17] cankerworm uh attacked the the doctrine
[1:05:20] or the religion or the bark of the tree
[1:05:22] the covering of the tree that's what the
[1:05:23] cankerworm attack uh the caterpillar
[1:05:26] goes in and he sucks the very life out
[1:05:29] of the tree it just looks so dead it
[1:05:32] looked defeated it looked like uh
[1:05:34] there's there's nothing on I mean you
[1:05:36] might as well just prepare it for fire
[1:05:38] but brother and sister you need to know
[1:05:40] that inside the roots of the tree amen
[1:05:44] there's a predestinated root and life
[1:05:47] has to come back out through that
[1:05:48] predestinated root praise God hlj Amen
[1:05:53] so in in ezekiel's Dry Bones the four
[1:05:56] stages uh God told him uh told Ezekiel
[1:05:59] he says I will lay senu upon you and
[1:06:01] this senu was the tendons Amen in the
[1:06:05] body this Valley that was full of dry
[1:06:07] bones a hopeless situation this but he
[1:06:09] says I'm going to lay sin you upon these
[1:06:11] dry bones and these are the tendons or
[1:06:14] the natural cords to hold the body
[1:06:18] together and not not also this and to
[1:06:21] form the means of
[1:06:23] feeling you know because what happens in
[1:06:26] churches when the pomor comes in and
[1:06:28] takes the Brotherly Love out amen we
[1:06:31] lose feeling one for the
[1:06:34] other blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:37] but the Holy Ghost has promised amen
[1:06:39] that he's going to restore and that
[1:06:41] feeling one for one for another will
[1:06:44] come back into the church amen I'll lay
[1:06:47] senu upon you amen the next thing he
[1:06:50] does is he brings flesh upon us right
[1:06:54] and uh and that's the soft part of the
[1:06:55] animal body and we need a heart of Flesh
[1:06:58] to be tender-hearted towards God as well
[1:07:01] as when we're tender-hearted towards God
[1:07:02] it makes us tender-hearted one to
[1:07:04] another uh he says I'm going to cover
[1:07:06] you with skin and this is the natural
[1:07:08] covering of our flesh which is the same
[1:07:10] thing the cankerworm took it took the
[1:07:12] bark the natural covering for the tree
[1:07:14] but God said I'm going to cover you with
[1:07:15] skin and give you n natural covering for
[1:07:18] that flesh and the last thing you're
[1:07:19] going to do is put breath in you and
[1:07:21] your breath is your life Hallelujah the
[1:07:25] caterpillar sucked the life out but God
[1:07:27] putting the breath back in put the life
[1:07:30] right back in all right let's go on now
[1:07:33] amen so here when we talk about this
[1:07:35] heart of Flesh that we need amen this is
[1:07:39] what we're really dealing with Ezekiel
[1:07:41] 36 amen uh 24- 28 for I will take you
[1:07:46] from among the Heathen gather you out of
[1:07:49] all countries and will bring you into
[1:07:52] your own land amen then will I sprinkle
[1:07:55] clean water water upon you and ye shall
[1:07:57] be clean amen from all your filthiness
[1:08:01] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[1:08:03] you a new
[1:08:05] heart also will I give you amen and a
[1:08:09] new spirit will I put within you and I
[1:08:12] will take away the Stony heart of your
[1:08:15] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:08:18] Flesh what a promise from almighty God
[1:08:20] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:08:23] cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:08:25] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[1:08:28] ye shall dwell in the land that I gave
[1:08:30] to your fathers and ye shall be my
[1:08:33] people amen and I will be your God so
[1:08:37] this is a promise that we're looking at
[1:08:39] uh in this rest season of restoration
[1:08:42] getting a new heart a new spirit as well
[1:08:44] as the holy spirit in the middle of all
[1:08:46] of that now I read this quote to you
[1:08:49] amen um uh last time we were here but I
[1:08:52] want to just bring it back around again
[1:08:54] cuz when we look look at Ezekiel and the
[1:08:56] scripture that we just read in Ezekiel
[1:08:58] 36 brother brandham tells us now Ezekiel
[1:09:01] was prophesying or
[1:09:03] foretelling what would take place in a
[1:09:06] age to come so this wasn't even for his
[1:09:09] day but this was for our day not in his
[1:09:12] age but a prophet is a Seer and is
[1:09:15] referred to in the Bible as the eagle
[1:09:18] who goes way high in the air and higher
[1:09:20] you go the further you can see now not
[1:09:23] only is Ezekiel prophesying about a age
[1:09:25] to come let me go a little further Joel
[1:09:28] is also prophesying about an age to come
[1:09:32] amen it's something that's supposed to
[1:09:33] happen in our day not just on the day on
[1:09:36] the day of Pentecost it it did happen
[1:09:39] there but it said in the last
[1:09:42] days will I pour out my spirit so this
[1:09:45] is something that still continues until
[1:09:47] this day Hallelujah he says so he says
[1:09:49] so the eagle Soares up much higher than
[1:09:52] than any other bird there's no bird can
[1:09:55] go with the eagle and there's no I like
[1:09:57] the eagle the Hulk hasn't got a chance
[1:10:00] in his sight and the Hulk cannot stand
[1:10:02] the altitude to where the eagle can so
[1:10:05] he would die see he hasn't got the
[1:10:07] makeup that the eagle has now it goes a
[1:10:10] little further it says and God liken the
[1:10:13] prophet to the eagle that would go in
[1:10:15] the makeup of a prophet he's a he he uh
[1:10:19] he is a sear that is in the spirit
[1:10:22] climbs beyond the emotion
[1:10:25] of the church I just love that statement
[1:10:28] he climbs beyond the emotions of the
[1:10:30] church he goes beyond the rhythm of the
[1:10:33] music he goes beyond the Clapping of the
[1:10:36] hands he goes beyond the joy among the
[1:10:39] saints he goes beyond all that God
[1:10:42] brings him up into a real alone alone
[1:10:45] then he opens his eyes and he lets him
[1:10:47] look around and see things that is a
[1:10:49] come then he brings them back down among
[1:10:51] the members of the body to forell them
[1:10:53] of what is in the making and I'm telling
[1:10:55] you what's in the making I'm telling
[1:10:57] there's an outpouring of the spirit of
[1:11:00] God that is in the making for spirit and
[1:11:03] Truth
[1:11:04] Tabernacle I'm talking about a great
[1:11:07] outpouring oh Hallelujah and you want to
[1:11:10] be in church on the day that the
[1:11:12] outpouring happens you don't want to be
[1:11:14] streaming on that day you want to be
[1:11:17] present brother would you would you have
[1:11:19] wanted to stream the day of
[1:11:21] Pentecost not me I want to be in the
[1:11:24] room amen glory to God so I'm telling
[1:11:27] you there's a great outpouring amen
[1:11:29] that's a part of the restoration amen
[1:11:31] that we can look forward to he says so
[1:11:33] God had took the eagle that God had took
[1:11:35] Ezekiel higher to took Ezekiel High far
[1:11:38] up and let him see around about 2600
[1:11:41] years now watch this amen and it says uh
[1:11:46] now the Bible said that he would give us
[1:11:48] a new heart and it would give us a new
[1:11:51] spirit and many people even Pentecostal
[1:11:54] people and F gospel people has been
[1:11:57] deceived in that many times God said
[1:11:59] I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't
[1:12:02] his spirit that is your spirit amen God
[1:12:06] got to give you a new spirit and that's
[1:12:08] not that's not the spirit of God you
[1:12:10] even recognize the change and some other
[1:12:12] people even recognize the change but
[1:12:14] that's still not the Holy Ghost yet amen
[1:12:17] the reason that he got to give you a new
[1:12:18] spirit says he says uh then I put my
[1:12:21] spirit in you I give you a new spirit
[1:12:22] and then I put my spirit in you and many
[1:12:24] times you get the new spirit and you
[1:12:26] think you got the Holy Spirit trusting
[1:12:28] upon emotions and signs and things when
[1:12:31] your life doesn't divy up to that now he
[1:12:33] said that's that's just a little raw but
[1:12:35] remember it's the truth now the reason
[1:12:37] you have to get the new spirit is
[1:12:38] because when his Spirit comes along your
[1:12:40] spirit will agree with his spirit amen
[1:12:44] oh my my my my my my my let me keep
[1:12:47] going here now we we going we going a
[1:12:49] few places uh it says many people that
[1:12:53] spirit that new spirit God has to give
[1:12:55] you a new spirit to get along with his
[1:12:58] Spirit Well some people so
[1:13:03] mean and we stopped there and I'm glad
[1:13:07] this at the beginning of the sermon I
[1:13:08] won't stop here cuz I got more to say
[1:13:11] but I am just going go going to
[1:13:13] highlight this a little bit some people
[1:13:15] so mean they can't even get along with
[1:13:18] themselves let alone with God if he come
[1:13:21] in now now what this mean I I I just did
[1:13:24] a a quick quick uh definition um you
[1:13:27] know look at look at the definition for
[1:13:29] this and and what mean is it's an you're
[1:13:32] unwilling to give or to
[1:13:37] share you're unwilling to give you so
[1:13:41] mean you unwilling to give or to share
[1:13:45] things come on I'm going say that again
[1:13:48] you un willing to give or if they doing
[1:13:51] it I don't want nothing to do with it
[1:13:53] you so mean
[1:13:55] all
[1:13:57] right hello
[1:13:59] somebody I'mma step into your living
[1:14:02] room amen that that that's a mean spirit
[1:14:06] let me just see I think I got something
[1:14:08] on this in a second let me let me just
[1:14:10] see something real quick before I before
[1:14:12] I give it away
[1:14:14] [Laughter]
[1:14:16] uh oh my my my my my my I might have not
[1:14:19] brought it but if I didn't it's okay I
[1:14:22] can I can tell it to you all right but
[1:14:25] uh you know brother Brandon was making a
[1:14:28] statement here that I was I was reading
[1:14:30] you know and I was going to I I don't
[1:14:32] think I inserted but but when we talk
[1:14:34] about
[1:14:35] mean uh and and and let me let me two
[1:14:37] things I'm I'm going say on this it's
[1:14:39] it's it's it's a unwillingness to give
[1:14:42] or share things now and this I'm just
[1:14:45] reading the definition especially
[1:14:51] money unwilling to give or share
[1:14:55] especially money some people mean with
[1:14:58] their
[1:15:00] tithes mean with they offering
[1:15:04] mean praise God and and let me let me
[1:15:07] preach to the young people y'all going
[1:15:10] to let me talk here a little bit God
[1:15:12] done bless you with a
[1:15:13] job huh you're making good money praise
[1:15:17] the Lord but you so mean with your money
[1:15:20] that you can't even offer to pay one
[1:15:22] bill in the house mer
[1:15:25] you just spend your money up like I
[1:15:27] don't know what but you
[1:15:32] mean you're unwilling to give or share
[1:15:34] things especially money we trying to get
[1:15:37] rid of that Spirit see this mean Spirit
[1:15:39] you got to understand um it don't come
[1:15:42] from God no sir anything evil like that
[1:15:45] don't come from God it came from Satan
[1:15:48] right and and and when you recognize
[1:15:50] that you are being anointed by something
[1:15:52] like that you know you're not being
[1:15:53] anointed by the Holy G ghost that's why
[1:15:55] you got to pray to get that thing off of
[1:15:58] you
[1:16:00] amen this me means
[1:16:03] unkind
[1:16:05] spiteful or
[1:16:07] unfair in all your dealings you're
[1:16:10] unkind you're spiteful and you're unfair
[1:16:12] all right we want to get that mean
[1:16:14] Spirit brother random say so so some
[1:16:16] people so mean they can't even get along
[1:16:18] with themselves let Al with God if he
[1:16:21] come in that's right so doubtful and
[1:16:23] there's there's the other one so
[1:16:25] doubtful an up and down God has to give
[1:16:27] you a new spirit give you a new nature
[1:16:30] so you can get along with his Spirit
[1:16:31] when it comes and and notice now he say
[1:16:33] so ding up and down you can't be like
[1:16:36] that as a Christian sir amen and and and
[1:16:38] and sometimes uh things will happen and
[1:16:42] uh and and and we can kind of get into
[1:16:43] this Gloomy mode but you got to choose
[1:16:46] not to go there you got to choose not to
[1:16:49] allow that that cloud of Doom to settle
[1:16:51] on you amen so doubt and up and down God
[1:16:54] has to give you a new spirit give you a
[1:16:55] new nature so you can get along with his
[1:16:57] Spirit when it comes amen I hope you see
[1:17:00] it God gives you a new spirit for
[1:17:01] yourself and then puts his holy spirit
[1:17:04] in there Amen to dwell with you and
[1:17:06] abide with you thank God for that now I
[1:17:10] wanted to
[1:17:12] um just kind of drop this little thought
[1:17:15] in here because I was thinking about
[1:17:17] this being mean and
[1:17:19] everything um I I I put this in I don't
[1:17:23] know why I put it right here but it's
[1:17:24] here so let me read it he say that's
[1:17:26] what the that's what the the uh that's
[1:17:29] what the church needs today is a hidden
[1:17:32] let me just make sure I ain't got
[1:17:33] nothing out of place here because I I
[1:17:34] want I want okay that's all right all
[1:17:37] right it says uh that's what the church
[1:17:38] needs today is a hidden consecrated life
[1:17:40] you can't be didd uh diddle dabbling
[1:17:43] along with the world and impersonating
[1:17:45] and acting like them and hear it with
[1:17:47] Christ because you're trying to Fashion
[1:17:49] After the world you're trying to live
[1:17:51] like the next Church you're trying to
[1:17:52] belong to a better organization we
[1:17:54] better clothes do so and so that's not
[1:17:57] comply with Christianity Christianity is
[1:17:59] a sacrific life hidden life with God
[1:18:03] through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:18:06] amen all right let me just go a little
[1:18:08] further these are quotes that I I had um
[1:18:12] when we were together last and I'm just
[1:18:14] re repeating that but we're going
[1:18:15] further says that's what the real
[1:18:17] Christian Life consist of not of how
[1:18:19] well you can do this or how well you can
[1:18:21] sing that's all right how well you can
[1:18:24] preach that's fine but that isn't it
[1:18:26] it's a hidden life consecrated the veil
[1:18:30] curtains dropped around you and you're
[1:18:31] dead and you're buried and you're hid in
[1:18:34] God through Christ and sealed in there
[1:18:36] by the Holy Ghost amen this is what
[1:18:38] we're looking for as as being real
[1:18:41] Christians I mean the world has no
[1:18:44] nothing to offer us we realize that the
[1:18:46] only thing that we need is more of God
[1:18:50] and when you get hid behind the veil
[1:18:52] with him you ain't thinking about
[1:18:54] nothing that the World got to offer
[1:18:56] amen church we we some of us live like
[1:18:59] we going to stay here forever but
[1:19:01] brother we we getting ready to leave
[1:19:02] here there's a Rapture that awaits us
[1:19:05] praise God a changing of the body that
[1:19:07] awaits us so let's get ourselves
[1:19:08] prepared now let me um let me just
[1:19:12] inject praise God this little statement
[1:19:15] I want to um I I I I I just thank the
[1:19:19] Lord all
[1:19:21] right here we go
[1:19:25] brother Brandon makes the statement the
[1:19:27] holy
[1:19:28] spirit will not misbehave itself in one
[1:19:32] person and behave itself in
[1:19:35] another you can't call yourself having a
[1:19:37] Holy Ghost and you misbehaving with it
[1:19:39] sir right the Holy Ghost don't misbehave
[1:19:42] itself in one person behave itself in
[1:19:43] another see that that new spirit amen a
[1:19:46] new heart new spirit Holy Spirit when
[1:19:48] you get the holy spirit it's going it's
[1:19:50] going to form your life into its
[1:19:53] character yes sir you going to do the
[1:19:55] things that Jesus did you going to walk
[1:19:57] the way Jesus walked you're going to
[1:19:59] talk the way Jesus talk why would you do
[1:20:01] that because you got the same spirit in
[1:20:04] you that Jesus had in him so the holy

[1:33:28] brother random say prophesying is
[1:33:31] good speaking in tongues is right let me
[1:33:35] let me let me let me let me let me y
[1:33:39] y'all y'all heard that freeing statement
[1:33:42] the brother was telling us on on on on
[1:33:44] on uh on Wednesday night how uh often
[1:33:49] times gifts are quenched in the church
[1:33:52] sometime it's quenched through
[1:33:55] preaching I'm going say that again gifts
[1:33:58] in the church can be quenched through
[1:34:00] preaching gifts in the church can also
[1:34:03] be released through preaching sir
[1:34:05] however what we want to preach is how to
[1:34:08] properly align the gifts yes sir because
[1:34:11] this is all part of the restoration
[1:34:13] right but but here speaking in tongues
[1:34:15] is right oh my God now now what happens
[1:34:20] though sometimes a person might have the
[1:34:21] gift of tongues and there are afraid to
[1:34:24] speak in tongues because they don't
[1:34:26] think that there's an interpreter in the
[1:34:27] building to interpret their tongues so
[1:34:30] they'll just stop they won't they won't
[1:34:31] they they they they'll quench the spirit
[1:34:34] but what the brother told us on F on
[1:34:36] Wednesday night it my it was we it was
[1:34:38] just very lifegiving it says when you
[1:34:41] read the scripture in the book of
[1:34:43] Corinthians amen that's right Hallelujah
[1:34:46] Corinthians 14 it says when the spirit
[1:34:48] kind of come upon you and you feel like
[1:34:51] I just and I I saw this happen I saw
[1:34:53] this happen uh in brother Smiley one
[1:34:55] time we were out praying for my Beth and
[1:34:58] brother Smiley was sitting there and you
[1:34:59] know he was he wasn't thinking about
[1:35:01] speaking in no tongues he would just
[1:35:03] sitting there and all of a sudden just
[1:35:04] hit him and
[1:35:05] you I'm like what he up and and he he he
[1:35:09] just couldn't hold it he just let that
[1:35:12] tongue go I say brother ain't nothing
[1:35:14] wrong with that and and often times we
[1:35:16] we have things like that happen in
[1:35:17] church and we just kind of afraid you
[1:35:19] can feel the spirit of God on you right
[1:35:22] come on somebody so so so rather than
[1:35:24] think like well ain't nobody here to
[1:35:26] speak in Tong I mean to interpret the
[1:35:28] tong so I'm not going to say nothing it
[1:35:30] says know what you're supposed to do
[1:35:31] according to scripture if God puts that
[1:35:34] unction in you to speak in tongues what
[1:35:36] you're supposed to do is pray that he
[1:35:39] would give you the interpretation yes
[1:35:40] sir oh my god father if you given me
[1:35:44] this unction to speak in tongues pray
[1:35:46] God God please give me the
[1:35:48] interpretation or give somebody else the
[1:35:51] interpretation now if God don't give
[1:35:53] give interpretation and God don't give
[1:35:55] nobody else to get the interpretation
[1:35:57] don't give you the interpretation or
[1:35:58] give somebody else to get the
[1:35:59] interpretation then you just okay next
[1:36:01] time that come up upon me I'm going just
[1:36:02] keep quiet in this
[1:36:05] service in this service I'mma say that
[1:36:08] again I'mma keep quiet in this service
[1:36:11] now the next service come up that that
[1:36:14] that that unction come again Hallelujah
[1:36:17] on glory to God Amen you pray for an
[1:36:20] interpretation praise God and if you
[1:36:22] don't get that interpretation then okay
[1:36:24] God I'm going just keep quiet I'm not
[1:36:26] going to do this no more Hallelujah cuz
[1:36:29] I don't I don't I don't want to be seen
[1:36:31] in the wrong light I want my gift to be
[1:36:34] subject to the prophets and God I I mean
[1:36:36] this is the gift that you gave me you're
[1:36:38] going to have to manifest a whole part
[1:36:40] of it because it's not just the speaking
[1:36:42] in tongues the interpretation got to
[1:36:43] come too now Lord I'm going to be
[1:36:44] obedient to you but I I need you to show
[1:36:47] up God right
[1:36:50] amen now now I'm going tell you just
[1:36:52] just my own person
[1:36:54] uh issues that I had that God had to
[1:36:56] help me with I was always concerned
[1:36:59] about a person speaking in tongues and
[1:37:02] then also interpreting the same tongue I
[1:37:05] always had a problem with that but the
[1:37:07] Bible actually say that that person
[1:37:09] supposed to pray for an interpretation
[1:37:12] and then on the
[1:37:13] natural that's right on the natural
[1:37:16] brother H way can speak in
[1:37:19] Spanish hello hello and also interpret
[1:37:23] it to
[1:37:25] English I got Saints in here can speak
[1:37:27] in Creole and also tell you what they
[1:37:30] said in English so if it can happen on
[1:37:32] the natural why can't it happen on the
[1:37:36] spiritual amen
[1:37:41] amen prophesying is good speaking in
[1:37:45] tongues is
[1:37:46] Right interpretation is Right shouting
[1:37:51] is right but you can do those things
[1:37:53] without being first fundamentally
[1:37:54] baptized into Christ those are those are
[1:37:58] only fruits not fruits of the spirit
[1:37:59] that's gifts of the Spirit it says like
[1:38:02] what if uh what if I go out here today
[1:38:05] brought down some of the Great Northern
[1:38:07] wine sap apples tied them onto a palm
[1:38:11] tree I I took some apples from somewhere
[1:38:14] else and tie brought them down here to
[1:38:15] Florida and tied them onto a palm tree
[1:38:18] and said now look here what a fine apple
[1:38:20] tree I
[1:38:22] got it's true there's there's a tree and
[1:38:26] apples are hanging on it but it isn't
[1:38:29] the product of the
[1:38:31] tree so we don't want to tie things onto
[1:38:35] the tree we we want this to come from
[1:38:37] the inside to manifest on the outside
[1:38:41] hallu oh we we ain't got to tie love
[1:38:44] onto the tree we ain't got to tie joy
[1:38:47] and Longs suffering onto the tree if if
[1:38:49] you really got the spirit of God
[1:38:50] dwelling inside these are the things
[1:38:52] that come out automatic
[1:38:53] and remember the Holy Ghost won't behave
[1:38:56] itself in one person and then misbehave
[1:38:59] itself in another person amen it's the
[1:39:03] same Holy Ghost it's the same Spirit of
[1:39:05] Jesus Christ all right all right let's
[1:39:09] go on a little
[1:39:12] further there you are through faith you
[1:39:14] can do great things and yet not be born
[1:39:17] again of the spirit of God this is what
[1:39:19] we talking about here we don't want we
[1:39:22] don't want that in the church where we
[1:39:23] got all the manifestation and gifts but
[1:39:25] people so mean after they finish preach

[1:43:20] what sister they was talking about cuz
[1:43:22] she did this all the
[1:43:27] time next night he preached at the exact
[1:43:31] moment that he closes his text cuz she
[1:43:34] knew not to do it while he was preaching
[1:43:35] that was out of line but as soon as she
[1:43:37] closed his
[1:43:47] text and then they just they just
[1:43:49] sitting there looking at her and she
[1:43:51] rise up again to let out Tong no
[1:43:54] interpretations well the third night
[1:43:56] come brother Bram brother brandom
[1:43:59] brother Billy
[1:44:01] daddy that lady
[1:44:04] here okay no
[1:44:08] worries preach his
[1:44:10] sermon he watched again cuz she had the
[1:44:14] same routine you knew what she was
[1:44:15] getting ready to do
[1:44:23] up and she start speaking in tongues
[1:44:26] well this time she got a little a rude
[1:44:29] awakening the other time she thought she
[1:44:32] was being received but she was being
[1:44:33] watched every time now don't come in
[1:44:35] here and get a root
[1:44:37] Awakening we really wanted to be the
[1:44:40] spirit of God we believe in it but we
[1:44:42] also know people can get in their
[1:44:46] flesh so this time she did it the third
[1:44:49] time she did it she heard word the
[1:44:53] prophet say sit
[1:44:55] down from the pull pit yes sir sit
[1:45:00] down she
[1:45:05] say yes I'm talking to you sit
[1:45:11] down she sat down but was on
[1:45:15] fire you want to talk about getting
[1:45:19] mean now here's the other thing about
[1:45:21] her she had other people working with
[1:45:25] her and we found out who her team was
[1:45:29] once she got called out because the team
[1:45:32] got upset yes sir why brother Brandon
[1:45:34] hand it like that oh he grieved the
[1:45:36] spirit he quenched the spirit oh oh no
[1:45:39] he quenched The
[1:45:42] Spirit Well they had to put him back in
[1:45:45] the word her pastor stand up to say cuz
[1:45:47] the pastor's on the team brother Brandon
[1:45:50] the spirit wasn't on you at the time the
[1:45:51] spirit was on her
[1:45:55] Spirit was on her God was finished
[1:45:57] dealing with you now God was dealing
[1:45:59] with her and you shouldn't have quenched
[1:46:00] Spirit say brother you don't I'm
[1:46:02] surprised you say that about that
[1:46:03] because the B I was actually going
[1:46:06] into altar call three times I tried to
[1:46:09] go and talk call she interrupted it
[1:46:10] every time and and you know the Bible
[1:46:12] say the spirit of the
[1:46:15] prophets is subject to the
[1:46:19] prophets so if your if your spirit can't
[1:46:22] get subject to the the word we don't
[1:46:24] want your spirit you need a new heart
[1:46:26] you need a new spirit and you need the
[1:46:28] Holy Spirit sir
[1:46:32] amen I hope I brought a balance on
[1:46:36] that
[1:46:40] hallelu through faith you can do great
[1:46:42] things and yet not be born again in the
[1:46:44] spirit of God be careful there it's a
[1:46:46] danger line Pentecostal people don't
[1:46:48] claim everything you hear of God I hope
[1:46:52] you don't get any angry with me when you
[1:46:54] get angry then you get
[1:46:58] mean brother R say I just love you you
[1:47:01] put a real old father loves his children
[1:47:03] he he sees that they're going to get
[1:47:06] hurt if they don't
[1:47:08] watch he's not a real
[1:47:10] daddy and what he's saying that if I if
[1:47:12] I know that you're G to get hurt you can
[1:47:14] actually get hurt by
[1:47:17] gifts and if we don't keep a balance on
[1:47:20] it you'll get hurt by and like the
[1:47:22] brother said we don't want we don't want
[1:47:23] to where like no gifts at all the gifts
[1:47:25] are supposed to be in every local body
[1:47:26] but it's got to be done according to
[1:47:28] order exactly right oh I I the promise
[1:47:32] told us that you know your your your
[1:47:34] your your uh young men will dream dreams
[1:47:37] and and and see old men see visions and
[1:47:40] upon my handmades I pour out my spirit
[1:47:42] and they will
[1:47:44] prophesy I done seen that happen right
[1:47:46] here in in our church I seen people that
[1:47:49] weren't even living

[1:47:58] somebody else and telling them what you
[1:48:00] know God going to do this and God going
[1:48:01] to do that and they not even living
[1:48:03] right but see that's what happened when
[1:48:05] anointing get brother Bram say anointing
[1:48:07] can get so great even a drunk
[1:48:11] man even a drunk man will feel it he' be
[1:48:15] impacted by

[1:48:56] um we're going to keep
[1:48:58] preaching so maybe God wanted that point
[1:49:01] just to soak
[1:49:03] in so we'll
[1:49:06] uh all right just give me one second I
[1:49:10] got to restart this happened to the
[1:49:12] brother on on uh on Wednesday too but
[1:49:15] the de when the devil the devil know we

[1:49:26] out amen we know how to wait that devil
[1:49:29] out just go me go go to next here and I
[1:49:32] just let me just kind of see here all
[1:49:34] right so be careful don't look at Great
[1:49:36] high things great crowds don't look at
[1:49:40] Great demonstrations or great healings
[1:49:42] or great things like that look up at the
[1:49:44] great savior the Lord Jesus the fruit of
[1:49:47] the spirit is love what is God love and
[1:49:52] look look at this now if you can't love
[1:49:54] your enemy now first of all first of all
[1:49:58] before we go too deep in that let me
[1:50:01] just announce if you did not know this
[1:50:05] already your
[1:50:07] brother and your sister in Christ is not
[1:50:14] your
[1:50:19] enemy if you didn't know this I'm going
[1:50:23] help you
[1:50:24] understand your biggest
[1:50:30] enemy your biggest enemy is you
[1:50:35] right so you got to overcome
[1:50:39] you amen praise the Lord he says if you
[1:50:44] can't love your
[1:50:45] enemy no
[1:50:48] matter what he says about you let me
[1:50:52] just stop and and just just pause on you
[1:50:54] think the reason I don't shake the hand
[1:50:56] because they said this the reason I
[1:50:58] don't do it because they said that no
[1:50:59] matter what they say if you can't love
[1:51:03] them your neighbor no matter what he
[1:51:06] says about you if from your heart not
[1:51:08] with your
[1:51:10] lips my God not with your knowledge that
[1:51:13] you should be doing it as a Christian
[1:51:15] but something in your heart makes you
[1:51:17] love them anyway I told y'all before
[1:51:20] brother brandom had a now everything
[1:51:22] that people did to him and it wasn't
[1:51:24] right but brother brandom had such a way
[1:51:27] that uh people knew you could not tell
[1:51:29] his enemies from his
[1:51:32] friends that's the type of uh
[1:51:34] relationship we want to have with God
[1:51:35] you can't tell my enemies from my
[1:51:39] friends Something in Your Heart Makes
[1:51:41] you love them anyway regardless of
[1:51:43] what you say then it's time to come to
[1:51:47] the altar again you just never quite got
[1:51:50] what you thought you or what what what
[1:51:52] what what really you shouldn't should
[1:51:54] have had amen see you probably you just
[1:51:56] didn't get what you thought or what you
[1:51:58] supposed to get you didn't get it so
[1:51:59] this this love has to come from the
[1:52:02] heart and the only way it can come from
[1:52:04] the heart is that the spirit of God has
[1:52:05] to dwell in you to produce
[1:52:08] this amen Church all right I got some
[1:52:12] things I I I I I got to make sure I say
[1:52:15] so that's why I'm waiting on this
[1:52:16] computer to come right on back amen go
[1:52:19] on to the next slide for me and and uh
[1:52:23] what what slide am I
[1:52:25] own okay yeah this now this is important
[1:52:28] we're talking about the uh the fruits of
[1:52:30] the spirit
[1:52:32] the that that
[1:52:35] old that first insect just started out
[1:52:38] he just took this Brotherly Love from
[1:52:40] the church he took the took the fruit of
[1:52:42] the spirit from the church now uh I want
[1:52:45] to just read this scripture because this
[1:52:47] is what the fruit of the spirit we're
[1:52:48] going to get into what this is all about
[1:52:50] here in a second but before before we
[1:52:52] talk about the fruit of the spirit we
[1:52:53] got to talk about this this works of the
[1:52:56] flesh bear with me oh yes thank you
[1:53:01] Jesus I'm back I'm back I'm back right
[1:53:04] where I want to be I am
[1:53:07] back and I'm cuz I I just have a feeling
[1:53:11] that this going to be one to set
[1:53:12] somebody
[1:53:13] free and that's why that's why that's
[1:53:16] why the devil's Frighteners he a want
[1:53:17] you to hear this
[1:53:21] one oh oh yes God gave me a part of this
[1:53:25] this morning so I had to I got to put
[1:53:27] this in here look at this The Works of
[1:53:30] the flesh which are these
[1:53:33] adultery
[1:53:34] fornication
[1:53:37] uncleanness
[1:53:39] lasciviousness
[1:53:41] idolatry
[1:53:43] witchcraft hatred
[1:53:46] variance
[1:53:48] emulations
[1:53:49] wrath strife
[1:53:54] seditions
[1:53:56] heresies
[1:53:58] envyings
[1:54:00] murders
[1:54:02] drunkenness reings and such like
[1:54:05] anything like that of the which I tell
[1:54:08] you before as I have told also told you
[1:54:10] in time past that they which do such
[1:54:14] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:54:18] God you ain't going to heaven living
[1:54:22] like this
[1:54:23] is you can come to church you can jump
[1:54:26] and Shout in church you can speak in
[1:54:27] tongues in church but if you keep this
[1:54:29] stuff in your life you ain't going to
[1:54:30] heaven
[1:54:32] right and let's just let's just break
[1:54:34] some of this
[1:54:35] down let's break some of this down I'm
[1:54:37] starting with with that word variance in
[1:54:39] verse 20 VAR variance when it says um
[1:54:43] The Works of the flesh are Manifest this
[1:54:45] variance is is it's Strife it's
[1:54:48] contention it's debate if you always
[1:54:51] look in a try to debate something
[1:54:54] something wrong with your
[1:54:58] spirit you know what emulations is is
[1:55:01] jealousy
[1:55:03] hey when you allow the spirit of
[1:55:06] jealousy to come into the church hello
[1:55:09] somebody and you try to outdo everybody
[1:55:12] else all right jealousy and jealousy is
[1:55:15] something that came from from Satan
[1:55:18] because he anointed came with that same
[1:55:20] Spirit that's where we saw he was
[1:55:23] jealous of his brother's
[1:55:25] offering amen can I go a little further
[1:55:29] sometimes we can be jealous of somebody
[1:55:31] else's
[1:55:34] special or the musicians can be jealous
[1:55:36] of somebody
[1:55:38] playing Hallelujah you get all kind of
[1:55:41] spirits on you well I I think I could do
[1:55:43] that better I should have did no you got
[1:55:45] the wrong Spirit on you pray for them
[1:55:47] that they'll be able to do it better
[1:55:49] amen hello Church
[1:55:52] we got to get rid of the works of the
[1:55:54] flesh preachers get jealous of one
[1:55:58] another ah brother Jack should have let
[1:56:00] me preach I would do this and I would do
[1:56:02] no no get rid of that jealous
[1:56:07] Spirit
[1:56:10] emulations you know what wrath is and
[1:56:12] this it's it's it's it's angry anger
[1:56:16] it's Heat and the other other thing they
[1:56:17] said is anger forth with boiling up and
[1:56:21] soon subsiding
[1:56:22] again sometime the devil just get you
[1:56:25] all boiled up on some situation you get
[1:56:27] all the way up here and oh you don't
[1:56:28] know me you don't know
[1:56:34] me I hope I don't get to know you if
[1:56:39] you anger just get them all the way up
[1:56:42] here and then they come all the way back
[1:56:44] down but you want to know why that pot
[1:56:47] stopped boiling again because that thing
[1:56:48] is still there yes sir and until you get
[1:56:51] that out of there you won't be talking
[1:56:53] like that all the time brother I just
[1:56:55] pray for you sister I just pray for
[1:56:57] you and really mean that right but just
[1:57:02] boiling up and simmering down boiling up
[1:57:04] and simmering down and sometimes you
[1:57:06] look for things so you can just Show
[1:57:08] Your
[1:57:10] Colors you look for situations that you
[1:57:12] can just step in and just really just
[1:57:14] show
[1:57:15] yourself Christians don't do
[1:57:20] that you know what s itions is in that
[1:57:23] scripture verse 20
[1:57:25] seditions is division you look for
[1:57:28] things that cause
[1:57:33] division
[1:57:36] now this word variance also mean
[1:57:40] Strife but why would Paul put Strife in
[1:57:44] if they mean the same thing because this
[1:57:47] Strife means something
[1:57:49] different you know what that Strife
[1:57:51] means
[1:57:53] a desire to put yourself
[1:57:58] forward you can't have a desire to put
[1:58:01] yourself for I I I'm going just put this
[1:58:02] like this I learned this a long time ago
[1:58:05] the Bible
[1:58:07] declares a man's
[1:58:10] gift will make room for itself you ain't
[1:58:14] never got to put yourself
[1:58:16] forward let me tell you like this also
[1:58:18] don't put yourself forward but always be
[1:58:20] ready to go
[1:58:25] now I'mma say that
[1:58:26] again Lord
[1:58:30] Jesus don't put yourself forward but
[1:58:33] always be ready to
[1:58:35] go don't sit there well you know you
[1:58:37] know I got to be humble I don't want to
[1:58:38] put myself out there and then somebody
[1:58:41] call you to come
[1:58:52] who else am I pointing
[1:58:53] to get on up here and help us
[1:58:56] out trying to be
[1:59:00] humble no be ready not humble not that's
[1:59:03] not the time to be humble be ready
[1:59:06] that's
[1:59:11] it so there Strife is a desire to put
[1:59:14] oneself forward and and this heresies
[1:59:17] here is dissensions arising from
[1:59:21] diversity of opinions and
[1:59:24] aims so maybe the church going in a
[1:59:26] particular direction but you don't like
[1:59:28] the direction that we
[1:59:31] going can I go a little further I know
[1:59:35] brother Jack showed us a church but I
[1:59:37] don't like that
[1:59:39] church so you're going in a different
[1:59:43] direction hello we trying to we trying
[1:59:46] to all be in one mind and one Accord so
[1:59:48] God can have his way so we got to get
[1:59:50] rid of seditions and hear it CE
[1:59:55] right and then he had to set envying all
[2:00:00] this actually connects right back to
[2:00:01] some of the other words drunkenness and
[2:00:04] ring deal with drinking Christians don't
[2:00:08] drink Christians don't do that praise
[2:00:11] the Lord and if you do that and expect
[2:00:13] to go to heaven you're
[2:00:15] not bottom line but this murderers now
[2:00:19] we know Christians don't kill people
[2:00:23] thou shall not kill but is that what
[2:00:25] Paul is talking
[2:00:28] about I think Paul talking about
[2:00:30] something
[2:00:32] different and you
[2:00:35] people with
[2:00:37] these saw blade
[2:00:40] Tempest you
[2:00:46] mean and you need to be
[2:00:49] delivered you people with these saw
[2:00:52] blade Temple that mean brother brandom
[2:00:53] had people like this in his church yes
[2:00:55] sir yes sir that's
[2:01:00] always can can can I put it this way
[2:01:02] your name always come up in the middle
[2:01:04] of something
[2:01:06] right keep your name out of
[2:01:10] stuff they say it say a good name is
[2:01:12] rather to be had than
[2:01:14] riches keep your name out of stuff avoid
[2:01:18] it
[2:01:19] completely you people Des blade temples
[2:01:22] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[2:01:26] at
[2:01:27] somebody can't put up and things like
[2:01:30] that be
[2:01:32] careful you're guilty if you speak a
[2:01:36] word against your brother that's not
[2:01:39] right like I told you earlier you done
[2:01:41] told a lie on somebody but ain't made
[2:01:43] that thing right go tell people you
[2:01:45] sorry for the lie that you
[2:01:49] told and if somebody come to you and
[2:01:53] apologize you ain't got to go around
[2:01:55] tell everybody you know so and so came
[2:01:57] to me and apologize to me you ain't got
[2:01:59] to go around doing all of that that's
[2:02:02] between you and that person
[2:02:05] right
[2:02:08] amen you're guilty if you speak a word
[2:02:11] against your brother that's not right if
[2:02:15] it's not just you go around and tear
[2:02:18] down it now look at this you don't have
[2:02:22] to stick a knife in a man's back to kill
[2:02:24] him that's
[2:02:27] murder but this what Paul talking about
[2:02:30] cuz you know I told you Paul was a
[2:02:32] bookend messenger and then brother
[2:02:34] Brandon's the other bookend messenger he
[2:02:37] says you can break his
[2:02:39] character and kill
[2:02:43] him a lie can break a man's character
[2:02:46] and people don't want nothing to do with
[2:02:48] the man because of your
[2:02:50] lie now now two people need to overcome
[2:02:53] that the one that told a lie and the one
[2:02:56] that was affected by the lie you
[2:02:58] shouldn't let a lie affect you and your
[2:03:01] behavior and your reactions towards a
[2:03:02] person when it's been proven to be a
[2:03:05] lie you got to drop
[2:03:08] that you can break his character and
[2:03:10] kill him kill his
[2:03:13] influence now I I I should have just
[2:03:16] took the rest of this off cuz all the
[2:03:17] pastors we like to read read the rest of
[2:03:20] it I should have just took that off but
[2:03:22] the rest of us say speak against your
[2:03:24] pastor here say something bad about him
[2:03:29] you just might as well as shot
[2:03:35] him you know there was 42
[2:03:38] children in the Bible that died because
[2:03:41] Bears attacked them and the reason that
[2:03:44] the Bears attacked them is cu and now I
[2:03:47] don't think all these children lived in
[2:03:49] the same house I don't know how many of
[2:03:50] them lived in the house but all the
[2:03:52] houses that they was living in there was
[2:03:55] a group the parents were in the house
[2:03:57] talking about
[2:03:59] Elijah right they were in the house
[2:04:01] talking about the leader talking about
[2:04:02] the pastor they they just had all these
[2:04:04] disagreements with the pastor well you
[2:04:06] know what they come out one day and and
[2:04:08] them kids didn't know no better they was
[2:04:10] products of their
[2:04:12] environment sometimes your children are
[2:04:14] acting based on what you saying in your
[2:04:18] house sir and it's not just the way they
[2:04:20] acting with a pastor it might just be
[2:04:22] with another brother or sister some
[2:04:24] conversations kids don't need to
[2:04:29] hear you don't need to have you don't
[2:04:31] need to share everything about what's
[2:04:33] going on in church leave that between
[2:04:35] Grown Folk kids don't know how to handle
[2:04:38] that information now they done took on a
[2:04:40] spirit amen and now these little kids
[2:04:42] got a spirit they come out and they see
[2:04:44] the prophet go up oh
[2:04:46] Baldhead didn't even call him brother
[2:04:48] elij
[2:04:50] Elisha brother is a brother no old
[2:04:53] ballhead Lord go up old ballhead now
[2:04:55] where did they hear that at they heard
[2:04:57] it at home this is what their parents
[2:04:59] were saying about a
[2:05:01] prophet who you think he
[2:05:04] is old Baldhead
[2:05:11] something I don't know what they saying
[2:05:13] nowadays who who he think he is who he
[2:05:16] think he who she think she is she don't
[2:05:19] know me
[2:05:26] now and I just be wondering what you
[2:05:27] going to
[2:05:28] do who you think you are and see now the
[2:05:32] devil going to push you into the flesh
[2:05:34] you're going to sang and get swung
[2:05:41] on I heard a I heard a brother say
[2:05:44] somebody gonna lay hands and feet on
[2:05:50] you but the devil them push you out
[2:05:52] there because you trying to hold on to
[2:05:54] that old nature you got to die to that
[2:05:57] type of stuff we Believers around
[2:06:04] here speak against your pastor here say
[2:06:06] something bad about him just might as
[2:06:08] well shot him told something that wasn't
[2:06:11] right about him well it'll kill his
[2:06:13] influence with the people and things
[2:06:14] like that and you're guilty of it what
[2:06:17] Jesus said
[2:06:21] i i i there's different ones I can
[2:06:23] appreciate their Spirits you know people
[2:06:26] will come to this church for all kind of
[2:06:28] reasons and and and and typically I will
[2:06:31] always try to sit down and talk to the
[2:06:32] person kind of hey what's going on what
[2:06:34] happened I know you was a part of this
[2:06:35] church and you know what what happened
[2:06:37] and I watched people how they respond to
[2:06:38] questions like
[2:06:40] that sometimes some people can't wait to
[2:06:42] tear down another
[2:06:43] Ministry you got to watch that you know
[2:06:46] in in in in in in the um in the
[2:06:49] Scripture it was uh man I can't think of
[2:06:52] the guy's name but I know David was the
[2:06:54] king and um
[2:06:56] Abner Abner wanted to come and be a part
[2:06:59] he and he come over there he just David
[2:07:01] we GNA do this but abna didn't want to
[2:07:02] be corrected and where he was so he come
[2:07:05] over there to David knowing that he had
[2:07:07] this Spirit on him and then want to be
[2:07:10] corrected he didn't want to be corrected
[2:07:12] over there what what you think G to
[2:07:14] happen here with David he ain't going
[2:07:16] want to be be corrected and David just
[2:07:17] took him in but joab say uhuh uh-uh no
[2:07:20] no no goab shouldn't have did this but
[2:07:23] he got ad taken care taken care
[2:07:26] of people come sometimes in the wrong
[2:07:29] Spirit you want to watch are you trying
[2:07:30] to tear down another Ministry are you
[2:07:32] trying to tear down another Pastor it's
[2:07:34] okay if if we just
[2:07:36] differ but we ain't got to tear each
[2:07:38] other
[2:07:40] down things happen and we going to
[2:07:45] differ told something that wasn't right
[2:07:47] about him well it kills his influence
[2:07:49] with the people and things like that and
[2:07:51] your guilty of it what Jesus
[2:07:56] said murder is killing a person's
[2:08:02] influence we don't want to do that
[2:08:05] anymore brother I'm sorry for what I
[2:08:07] said about you sister I'm sorry for what
[2:08:10] I said about you I was feeling this way
[2:08:12] about you and I really shouldn't have
[2:08:13] been feeling that way but what what was
[2:08:15] it what was it sometime you don't need
[2:08:16] to be ask all them
[2:08:19] questions just accept apology

[2:08:34] that just I'm sorry I don't want nothing
[2:08:37] between us I got to move on that's right
[2:08:41] oh I know this is ain't this ain't
[2:08:42] nothing but the truth I I appreciate it
[2:08:44] I I know that when I preach this the
[2:08:46] first time different ones tell me say
[2:08:48] yeah and Pastor you was telling the
[2:08:49] truth because I had I knew I had had to
[2:08:51] make some things right there and and and
[2:08:54] if you just
[2:08:55] feel just feel like the devil might be
[2:08:57] trying to put something there just call
[2:08:59] and get that thing
[2:09:01] out I appreciate saints that have done
[2:09:05] that I I told you last time I was
[2:09:07] preaching say this even for me there's
[2:09:09] there's certain things that I have to
[2:09:11] intentionally do in order to try to
[2:09:13] rebuild
[2:09:15] Bridges praise the Lord because I know
[2:09:18] the devil tried to tear these things
[2:09:19] apart but I got to do intentional things
[2:09:22] to try to rebuild Bridges and it ain't
[2:09:24] easy when you dying after of yourself
[2:09:27] there some things you just don't want to
[2:09:31] do but I just I want I want the I want
[2:09:34] the passage way to be so clear that the
[2:09:38] Holy Ghost can just flow right through
[2:09:40] here and nothing hindering us God knows
[2:09:44] I want
[2:09:45] that the gifts in the right place and
[2:09:48] man speaking in tongues and and and and
[2:09:50] gifts I mean the gift interpretation
[2:09:52] going forth I mean just oh we want to
[2:09:54] see
[2:09:56] God and now I know some people try to
[2:09:58] use their gifts to control
[2:10:02] churches I know that too now people they
[2:10:06] they dream want to control they dream
[2:10:08] the dreamers want to control the church
[2:10:10] let me tell you something before you get
[2:10:11] started the dream will never control
[2:10:14] this church what's going to control this
[2:10:16] church the word of
[2:10:18] God and if your dream don't line up with
[2:10:21] that word

[2:10:41] that's going to go for it or not then
[2:10:43] you get mean and hot with the pastor he
[2:10:46] won't let my dream go cuz if I don't see
[2:10:48] nothing in it then I got a team of
[2:10:50] people
[2:10:52] that I think are gifted to be able to
[2:10:53] interpret these dreams and I put it
[2:10:56] before them said y'all see anything in
[2:10:58] this we don't see nothing it ain't going
[2:11:01] nowhere true and now I'mma tell you God
[2:11:04] going to allow that to happen to you to
[2:11:06] see if you're willing to subject your
[2:11:10] gift or you want to go somewhere else

[2:11:14] do true can I say something about spirit
[2:11:17] and Truth we going to have some

[2:11:26] order if you get if you get mad and want
[2:11:28] to leave we already know where you at
[2:11:32] saw blade
[2:11:34] temper let's keep on
[2:11:43] going the fruit of the spirit this is
[2:11:45] what's coming back into the
[2:11:49] church boy that that that that that
[2:11:54] old insect took it all out but we we

[2:12:12] brother I got peace with my sister I got
[2:12:15] peace with God it is
[2:12:17] longsuffering and I remember a preacher
[2:12:18] saying one time why does God say long
[2:12:21] long suffering and not shorts
[2:12:24] suffering but he uses the term
[2:12:26] longsuffering as Believers as uh
[2:12:28] Christians with with with the Holy Ghost
[2:12:30] In Our Lives we have longsuffering and
[2:12:32] the question is how
[2:12:35] long is
[2:12:38] long see you don't have an answer to
[2:12:40] that that's why you just got to keep
[2:12:42] bearing with one another until the
[2:12:44] rapture we bear with each
[2:12:48] other longsuffering
[2:12:52] gentleness
[2:12:55] goodness
[2:12:58] Faith
[2:13:01] meekness
[2:13:04] Temperance against such there is no
[2:13:07] law and they that are Christ have
[2:13:10] crucified the flesh with the affections
[2:13:12] and lust that mean you got to take your
[2:13:14] own your own uh your your flesh and
[2:13:18] crucify it not physically but
[2:13:20] spiritually you got to get rid of this
[2:13:22] guy put that guy put that that that
[2:13:24] other nature in a
[2:13:26] grave if we live in the
