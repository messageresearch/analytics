the way Lord I pray you speak to each Heart Lord like you would need to Lord father may you have the preeminence in your house Lord preminent in your body Lord and Lord we pray that you just bring every scripture to life bring each quote to life Lord and let us just go away and just say our hearts not burn within us as we walked and talked with you and almighty God we just say Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen well let's open our Bibles up and we'll go to Hebrews chapter 4 very familiar scripture reading amen who's thankful to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen amen so we'll start with verse one let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it God bless you may the Lord add a reading to his Blessing of his word you may sit down praise the Lord I I want to keep you guys up the whole chapter so so we'll go to verse Two For unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so we see there's a promise left to us of rest yes and everybody in the world is looking for some type of rest amen no matter it can be through alcohol it can be through drugs you name it but what they don't know is the only way you can get this rest is through Christ you got to be in Christ so let's keep going verse three for which that believe do enter into rest so we have to believe that the rest is for us personally because unbelief will take you out of that rest and so as he said as I have sworn in my wrath that they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for we speak in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his Works verse 5 and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore May that some must enter therein they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief so we see the children of Israel they didn't enter into the land of rest because of unbelief even though they said Mighty works of they can say I seen frogs I I've seen all these Miracles but when The Showdown came from them to take God after the word he could they could not enter into to that rest so it behooves us to always make sure that we are taking God at his word don't assume it I don't care how bad the situation may seem you take God at his word am amen let's go to verse 8 now for if Jesus had given them rest then he would not afterward have spoken of another day I look I love verse n right here there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God and I believe we're all the people of God here and there's a rest for you whatever situation you're going through there's a rest right for you verse 10 for he that's entered into his rest he's also ceased from his own works so you're no longer trying to figure it out you're no longer trying to do this way and this way and that way but you're trusting and resting in God knowing that he's going to make a way for your situation yes sir I think a lot of times we worship our situ ation than worshiping God I'm going say one more time A lot of times we worship our situation than worshiping God so it says verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest so we we have to play our part and laboring isn't trying to do all these things but it's surrendering it's yielding and resting and the title of this sermon is yielded and resting and the subject is rested in Christ so when we're yielded we can therefore enter into that Holy rest and think God died on the cross so you could have that Holy rest but a lot of times we don't want to accept that Holy rest because we want to try to figure everything our own way we want to have control in every situation but we have to give God control in every situation of our life stop trying to do it your way amen verse 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul Spear and the joints and the marrow and is a deser of the thoughts and Tents of the heart think about that so it's nothing that you can hide from God Amen you may say profess with your mouth but you're believing but God is going to see if you truly mean it from in here amen verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do I love this verse right here says seeing then we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we're not a high priest which cannot be touched with the the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so a lot of times you know that song I forgot that song uh what a friend we have in Jesus A lot of times we we forfeit this peace that we have because we we can't recognized that that God was once on Earth he had feelings he he had sickness he had pain he had sorrow so he knows what you feel and he can relate to how you're feeling so why not trust in the high priest that we have just pour your heart out to him I don't care how bad the situation is God has a solution for your problem and I think a lot of times we get sometimes get so caught up in our problem that we never think we can ever get out of it this it's like when somebody's addicted to drugs they they feel like there's no way out but there's always a way out God Will Make A Way out with there seem with no way that's the kind of God that we serve verse 16 let us therefore come boldly I I love that it's not talking about some prideful boldness but what it's talking about is you come in boldly knowing that it's his merits it's what he has done to make a way so you can have a solution so you can have peace so you can have rest so you can have victory in the trial see a lot of times we let the devil dis beat us I said this statement before don't let a defeated creature defeat you because when Christ died upon the cross he defeated every work that the enemy's done to you and and you have power through Christ I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me so it's not you but is Christ in you the hope of glory giving you an the overcoming Victory that's right sir amen let's go to numbers 14 amen hallelujah let's go verse 14 we go vers 6-9 amen amen so it says and Joshua the son of N and Caleb the son of je forgive me jeffan which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes so we see that there was 12 Spies that went into the land right and out of the 12 only two of them had a good report right and so imagine the majority just imagine all the majority all all the uh the pressure that Joshua and Caleb had they all these people just going against them saying the same things that they saw but Joshua and Caleb they were of a different Spirit the Bible told us they they saw what God did in Egypt right and they had faith that the same God that did those things in Egypt can do the same thing to the land that he promised them right let's keep going verse 7 and they speak unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is exceedingly a good land if the Lord Delight in us when he will bring us into the land and give it to us a land flowing with milk and honey I love what they said right here verse n Only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defenses departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not so if the Lord has promised you something it's going to come to pass I don't care what the gangers say I don't care all these things say but have faith that if God has spoke to you personally that it's going to come to pass every promise in the book is yours is just waiting for you to have the faith to match it praise God and Allah brother Bram said we have we have faith to get in our car we know it's going to start that's the same type of faith we need with the word of God and let God increase your faith because when God speaks to you you have to exercise it you have to cultivate it don't just leave it here at church but bring it with you the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I think a lot of times we we hear a good word but we don't take it with us to work we don't take it with us to home and we got to take it everywhere we go because God loved you so much he had a personal word for you that day and so you got to take that just take it into your heart praise God hide it in your heart let it be manifested in your life on a daily basis amen amen so we see not everybody's going to agree with you not everybody's going to see the way you see but if God has spoken something to you and it lines up with the word of God then no man can take it away from you and no man can add to you hallelujah amen hallelujah amen let's go to Isaiah 28 and so I think a lot of times we we like brother Smiley was saying we get so caught up in carnality we let emotions just dictate our spiritual walk with God and emotions aren me ar ar aren to dictate your spiritual walk with God faith is to dictate it because emotions you're not always going to feel like you want to pray I I promise you that so when the motivation isn't there discipline must kick in see you look at the word disciples it has the word discipline in it right and so the disciples had to constantly discipline themselves because they didn't have a group of Believers like we do they they literally had to go from place to place to place they even sold everything that they had didn't have a car didn't have nothing but what they had was all they needed was God and so I think a lot of times we get so caught up in the amenities of this world and all these fancy things and we get lazy because the enemy is constantly trying to get our eyes fixated off of Christ and we we're more busy than we were 20 years ago I can say the older I get the more responsibilities I get the more busier I get and so the devil's constantly he the devil tries to get to get you distracted on good be good things it's not going to be some bad thing but it's good things it be family it could be a job be all these things that can come up but if anytime we take our eyes off of Christ and put that before him that becomes an idol in your life I know it's a powerful statement but it's anything that takes you away from Christ is a idol in your life I don't it could be your wife it could be your kids you have to put God in his proper place put go if you put God number one your time will open up I promise you that a lot of times we say oh man I don't have time to pray I I just want to say hi Lord by Lord you ain't going to have a walk with Christ you ain't going to have an intimate walk with Christ just saying Lord and by Lord so the thing is we need to make time for God don't just pencil in your schedule see you make time to go to work you make time to uh to feed your face all these things but why can't we make time for God and then we complain about the situations we're in but we're not willing to do what God told us to do labor into that rest and the word when I say labor you got to surrender you got to fight the good fight of Faith because the enemy knows when you get to that rest he can't touch you but if he can get you not being rested then he has you right where he wants you because he knows that your abilities cannot defeat him but he knows that Christ is the only thing that can defeat him amen go off my notes right so I remember the stat I think brother bam I said it but is God is not obligated to give you any more light until you follow the light he has already given you I'm say it one more time God is not obligated to give you any more light until you follow the light he's already given you so a lot of times we want revelation but are you following the Revelation that God has given you first see you can't have the C before the horse right amen so I LIF the word up resting is ceasing to move or act ceasing to be moved or agitated lying leaning standing depending and relying so you're standing and relying upon the word of God that you know it's going to be manifested in your life at God's appointed time so you got to hold on to that promise no matter how how hard the enemies attack you you got to hold on to that promise because it's better than gold it's a gold standard God would rather bankrupt the all of Heaven than his word to fall void so amen amen so I said Isaiah 28 didn't I so Isaiah 28 and we'll go with verse 12 and then we'll go to verse 10 amen so it says in verse 12 to whom he said this is the rest where withth you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear it so we we see we live in a world where everybody wants a get-rich quick scream or they want to help my problem now scheme that's exactly right and those things aren't going to work that's right so you can say hey I can go to pornography I can go to alcohol I can go all these things but those things only patch up what can only make you cuz it's a it's a hole in your heart and if I get shot a Band-Aid is going to help it I got a disinfect I got to clean it I got to treat it so a lot of times people don't want to let Dr Jesus treat their conditions so if you don't never let Dr Jesus teach a condition then how are you ever going to have a solution to your problem see we're searching all these things oh I need to do this I need to do this what you need to do is get in your knees amen that's what's going to help your situation getting get in the word of God get in the message of the Hour come that's what that's what's going to help your situation stop trying to look on this Google all these things aren't going to help you there may be good ideas but they ain't going to solve the problem amen let's go to verse 10 for precept must be upon precept upon precept line upon line here little and there little so stop trying to be control everything just follow God's words God has given us a blueprint how we need to live our life he's hitting Simplicity he's not hitting a math equation at a square plus b square C square but he's hid in Simplicity we make it we make God sometimes we make God he he he's this far out being but God is right here he's inside of you yes sir why not trust the god that's inside you he LEDs you this far he's going to lead you all the way through if he started a good work in you then he is going to finish it let him finish it sir stop trying to see his hands are tied if you're not having faith in him you mean when Jesus he's walking by this certain city he couldn't do anything because of the unbelief so you had to walk right on by so same thing in our lives if we're not letting God he's knocking the door of your heart right now if you're not letting him in then he can't do anything even though he wants to do something it's like brother Bram said he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want it it's like a pipe that's about to burst that's right but he's not going to give the Holy Ghost this to anybody he's going to give the Holy Ghost who he trusts who we know he puts that spirit and he's going to f fulfill what he's called them to be amen so let's go to uh we go back to Hebrews 4 14-6 so it says Sing then with a great high priest that is pass into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was at all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need I remember this one preacher said this statement he said Jesus was so busy but he still found found time to rest so think about that Jesus every day was busy busy busy busy doing the work of God but he still knew that he had to rest in God so the same thing with us yeah you can be busy but not being productive didn't say Washington said a statement like that so don't be just busy but be busy for the things of God because this life is going to pass away right doesn't matter how much money you put in the 401K it doesn't matter how much money you put this way and that way how many nice things you have I'm not saying we can't have all those things but if if our heart is directed towards getting these nice things getting to retirement what about the work of God he just didn't seal you and fill you with the Holy Ghost so you can do your own thing but he he had works that only he could use you to do in your community see I can't reach I can't reach where brother Jack can't reach and he can't reach where I can't reach so the thing is we got to be Heavenly minded be focused Jesus was Purpose Driven how many believe that that's right he he was about the father's business and he understands you have a job you have kids he understands all these things he's just waiting for you to have that that perfect balance is only through the Lord Lord amen if you're not playing every day don't take days off when God died for you he didn't take days off if God gave you your best his best to you you got to give God your best he's least worthy of that I understand God knows we go through all these difficult situations but don't let those become excuses am a lot of times our excuses sound so good to ourselves that we deceive our own self that we deceive our own self not even knowing that's right amen amen amen I'm read a quote this is from 1950 Ministry explained well he was wounded for our transgressions and by his stripes were healed Jesus Hebrews 3 31 a high priest of our confession now any of you Scholars knows that the word profession is translated as the same profession he's the high priest amen amen now from the church of living God 1951 now if you accept now what he's done for you then now he's the Hebrews 3 31 so think about that you have to accept that first yeah you can read all day and all night but if you don't accept that into your heart it's going to do you no good how many how many Bible scholars read the same word that we're reading and don't have a revelation of who Jesus really is they may know about him right but do they know him cuz you can I can know about somebody but if I never met him personally then I don't know who he is amen so it says he's the high priest of our confession anyone who knows the scripture know that the word written profession but it's the same word TR translated confession now in other words he can't save you by your merits of your prayer he can't save you by the merits of your enthusiasm or your good works he saves you by the merits of what your faith and your confession for you if you confessing before men him will I confess before my father and the Holy Angels and whatever listen close any Redemptive blessing that's written in the word is yours think about that so it's not about how good of a person you can be but it's about having faith knowing that it's nothing that you could have done to obtain your salvation nothing you no works you could have done but he did it for you and your faith has to rest in that and now a lot of times people get that mixed up while I have to do anything I can just relax but no you st when you give your heart to God the devil puts a Target on your back and you got to fight that much harder than I was on the world I didn't have all these problems I just chilled just played video games just did my thing but when I gave my heart to God man it's like the devil was attacking me in every fast and every situation because he knows if you get connected with God going to be a problem in his King he going to tear his kingdom up glory and so think about that if we're rested in Christ we can tear the devil's Kingdom up like ver SM say we can lend a helping hand to somebody because somebody lend God sent somebody lend a helping hand to us why not we try to do the same thing let God use you let God use your vessel use your lips use your mind amen hallelujah amen so I love the this word profession I looked it up I like looking words up says open declaration so it's not something that you hide in a COR but your it's a decoration a public AOW or acknowledgement of one's sentiments or beliefs as a profession of friendships or sincerity a profession of faith and religion and like brother Bram said confession and profession mean the same thing oh our the act of acknowledging profession and I look the word up labor too because in Hebrews uh 4:11 it says we got to labor to enter into that rest and it means to work to till to cultivate so this like a garden if you're planting a garden and you plant the seeds and you order it once a month is it going to grow no no you got to constantly cultivate you got to te it you got to make sure that it's in the right environment right and the same thing with I walk with God are you in the right environment because if a plant is not in the right environment it will not grow to full maturity so if you're not putting yourself in the right environment the the same type the the right kind of friends the uh uh things you're watching on the TV your phone whatever it is social media then you're not going to grow properly so the thing is make sure you're in the right environment so it's so important the people you hang around with I think you are the average of the five friends you spend the most time with so if if you're hang out with people who are dragging you down who aren't who aren't pointing you to Christ who aren't lifting you up high then is it worth it because the Bible tells us not to be unev and yolked right and it's good to like I said it's good to have friends but make sure those friends are help building you and not destroying you a lot of times we can yeah they can be fun to hang around with but are they pointing you closer to Christ or driving you further away to Christ especially the young people we got to make sure who you're hanging around with that's right because you're at a age you're at a ripe age right now where where you're like a sponge you soak these things in and you can get influence a lot more easier than somebody who's older than you right that's why it's so important watch the things you're watching social media YouTube It's a trap they're a blessing but they're a cursing because God can uh because the devil can get right in there and use and turn that blessing into a cursing by by little popup ad that's how he works I remember I remember brother Bram said this statement he said that he may not be able to get you look at a a fully naked woman but he could take just enough clothes off so apply it to any situation he can he can just get a little bit in there and just get just enough for you to take your eyes off of Christ amen thank you brother so so let's is it on I think it's good it's good amen so let's go to uh Luke 13:24 amen I like this song The I'm not going to sing it but the more that I Surrender the lighter my load the more that I release my cares the more you take control so a lot of times we want to hold on to the cares of this life we want to hold on to the problem but the thing is we're missing the rest we can have and we got to let go let go of those problems stop letting them just engulf your life because God God didn't call you for your problems to engulf your life like brother Smiley said we don't have to drown God is saying I'm here that's right but you have to make that decision though God isn't going to force himself he's going to kick the door down but he's waiting for you to realize how much you really need him amen so I said Luke 13:24 I like this word that it uses in this in this rendition in Luke 23:24 says strive to enter in so lot says strive to enter in so notice that you play got to play a part it's not that you just just lay it you just walk in but you got to strive says strive to enter at the Straight Gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able to so that's what we're talking about so many people want this they have a desire but they're not willing to pay the price so you got to pay the price for a Christian walk cuz it's like this you have right side and left side you can choose the pleasures of this world just like Moses had a choice you can choose a pleasure to this world you can choose suffer the reproach of Christ and you could have a live a good life by living a worldly life you can make millions of dollars and have all popularity but at the end of The Journey death and destruction is right there so is it really worth it i' rather be dirt pole like brother Smiley said than to be Filthy Rich and not know God you know is it worth it you know it's not worth it let go to Matthew 7:13 all right amen so it says enter ye at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction Look what Jesus says right here and many there be which going there at so the straight and narrow is only few are going to make it because they're going to be willing to crucify themselves Jesus said you can't even follow me until you first crucify yourself you got to deny yourself daily verse 14 because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it so the Bible's telling me few there be that find it so it's telling me that we really got to just be desperate desperation is going to change the situation just like with Hannah God saw the desperation she had in her heart to have a kid and he looks at the motive of why you're asking for something and when she asked for the child she said Lord I'm going to dedicate it onto you and so that's what really touched the heart of God what you're asking for why are you asking it the prophet said to check your motive because a good motive can turn into a mixed motive so that's why you got to you got to do an inventory check David said search me and try me so you constantly got to check and see what why are you doing what you're doing what's what's your driving force what's your why amen so we see the importance of faith in Hebrews 4:2 For unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit unto them not being mixed with faith them that heard it so he said to state before unbelief takes you out of the rest but belief keeps you in brother John Martin said this statement if you don't exercise faith it will shrink exercise the faith God has given you so we have a a spiritual man in a in uh and a uh carnal man a white dog or a black dog that's right so whatever dog you feed the most is going to come out on top amen faith is a vehicle faith is the vehicle we use to move forward with God think about that without faith you came and please God it's like having a car but having no gas in it it's not going to take you anywhere amen we have to we have to enter into this rest it's not something that just falls into your lap it's not a Christmas gift or a birthday gift but it's something you have to strive for because the devil's going to fight against you tooth and nail he's going to fight even more because he knows his time is short we're coming too close to be lazy Paul said Redeeming the time so our time is precious one of the greatest things you can give God is true sincere time because time with him that's how you build just like a house if you're building a house you don't put time into it it's never going to be built so we're a house God is trying to build us into the house that the blueprint is in here amen see amen let's go to Proverbs 18:10 amen so I know a lot of times we just get so so beat up in this life sometimes and I love what I love it in 1810 what it tells me I don't have to be beat up but I can 1810 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runthe so there's a strong tower that you could not just go to when you need it when when you're all broke down but stay in that Tower see lot lot of times we don't want to stay in the Fortress of God we want to venture out we want to try this or try that but stay in stay in that rest because is it worth being stressed worrying cuz you know stress causes gray hair it it does and it even caus health problems too so God didn't call you to be he didn't die so you had to be stress in his life he didn't amen and let's go to um we'll go to Psalms 18 1-2 so think about this God is your rock he's your Fortress your deliverer your Buckler the Horn of your salvation and a strong tower look at all these benefits that we have a lot of times we don't utilize these benefits we got to utilize the amenities that God has given us because when we use all these amenities then God is going to be God in your life let's go to 18 uh verses one I'll read right here put verse one on the screen for me please amen so it says I will love thee oh Lord my strength I I love what David says right here he doesn't say just strength but he says my it's personal to him so you got to make God personal to yourself you you can't just know about God but you got to know God personally that he is your strength go to verse two please amen says the Lord is what my rock your personal Rock and my Fortress and what my deliverer my God my strength in whom will I trust my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and my high tower come on David knew God personally he could say these things he experienced all those things in his life so God has to constantly be your rock be your Fortress your deliverer because he can deliver you out of any situation the enemy puts you in says no weapon formed against me shall prosper it can't amen amen I love what the prophet says right here why are people so tossed about did you ever meet a person that's been in there he's tasted living on this Mana you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday th Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day things are going right wrong he's always sweet always full of love never talked or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he never has to go to church and they get built up I love that statement right there see a lot of times we go to we go to church and and expect the pastor to make us feel good the pastor to just to preach in a certain situation thing is you don't you you don't go to church to be built up but you go to church to see where you're at with God and you should be feeding on the same word that was preached on Sunday and you should become excited brother BR said we should be the happiest people in this world cuz we know what Jesus Christ did for us we know what it took for him to to give us a way of escape to Deliverance Hallelujah so we should be smiling yes sir I I know I know times are troubl times are rough but we serve a God who who's above all those things above all those things amen amen amen but has to come here is your whole makeup is Christ your attitude see attitude is everything right a attitude can can take you out of a situation or take you back into a situation and the prophet said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass so to God your attitude is important the Bible even tells us do all things through murmurings and disputings so a lot of times we we get so caught up in complaining that it kills our faith when more you complain the more it kills your faith then you start begin to doubt a little seed of Doubt comes in you start complaining and complaining so when that when a complaining Spirit comes kill it right then and there even the Bible tells us in uh 1 John 4:1 uh beloved try the spirits it says try the spirits so brother Bram said the greatest battle of fall is in your mind so you got God trying to talk to you and the devil trying to talk to you and you got to be able to uh to distinct which voice is speaking to you sir because not every thought that comes into your mind is of God I'm say one more time not every thought that comes into your mind is of God so you got to make sure you know who God is just like the prophet say you got to know your enemy know your savior know your God know your rock know your Fortress know your deliverer amen amen so the only labor he tells us to labor into his rest says when you work I rest when you rest I work so we're trying to do all these things and we're getting so wore out and tired huffing and puffing and and sweating and then God isn't doing anything cuz you ain't letting him do anything but he says when you rest he works right see I said to statement earlier he was so busy but he still found time to rest when the pain comes the supply is already there think about that God knew when you got in that fiery trial he already had a supply waiting for you but has to be uh it has to it's a one I'm trying to see what's the word I'm looking for it it'll come back to me amen good uh so think about that statement everything you have need of Lies inside of you think about that waiting to be quickened by the power of the Holy Ghost that's the word I was looking for so a seed has to be deratization that's not that's not a humble Spirit a humble and contrary Spirit no wise will I despise that's what God said amen amen let's go to Hebrews 11 so Hebrews 11: 1-3 and then we'll close with uh Matthew 11 so it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen think about that I got I got another quote from Brother John make sure your faith is not missing the substance I me brother Smiley said that I was like wow God faith comes with Assurance peace and confidence I'm say one more time God faith comes with Assurance peace and confidence yes sir verse Two for the for by the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and let's jump to verse six but without faith but without faith it's impossible to please him so you can't even please God you can go all the soup suppers you want to all these things you give your body to be burned but there's no faith in that knowing who God really is then how can you ever please him how can you ever please God without faith for he that come to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so right off the bat right off the rip you got to come to God knowing who he is he's a prayer answering God he's a mighty God he's a holy God and I don't think we reverence God enough and how you treat others is how you treat God I don't think we reverence the house of God enough either we got to reverence the house of God cuz God is worthy God is all omnipresent he's everywhere so we kind of just put God in a box like he's only here but God is is everywhere he's even inside of you that's right so you can call on a God you can call God any time of the day you can pray to him any time of the hour don't be scared he's right there let's go to Matthew 11:28 I remember I was studying this I was studying this uh this title this little study about rest and I love how when when God just brings it together I was looking at Hebrews 4 and and Matthew 11 I was like Wow Paul was talking about that same rest that Jesus was talking about in Matthew 11 it really just hit home I was like wow I've never never seen like that before so Matthew 11 and we'll go verses 28-30 amen so it says come unto me all ye that labor in are heavy laden and I will give you rest so he's offering this rest to us a hand out he's like his hand is out he's waiting here I have this rest for you are are you willing to to do what it takes and he gives us a formula right here take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find what rest unto your souls see I know vacations are good but when you come back life is right back there right going but if the soul is resting doesn't matter if the boss is yelling at you doesn't matter if if your wife isn't talking to your husband isn't talking to you you're rested right amen says for my yoke is easy and my burden is light so so we got to be resting more God has made a way that we can rest every day doesn't have to be Wednesdays Sundays Mondays Tuesdays but 7 days a week we can be in this rest yes sir let's go to Hebrews 4 one more time and we'll close with this last verse amen it says there remain therefore a rest to the people of God and go verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so let's from this day forward let's let's let's be striving to enter into this rest cu the more you're rested the more you can be focused and we're not rested we're not focused God has a certain specific calling in each one of our lives and it's to be more like him and the more we can get focused and fixated on that the more God can use us in the magnitude that he wants to use us in not not as much as you want but what God wants cuz what you want and what God wants are night and day he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways and so let's trust in God he knows what he's doing it's not his first time around the block he knows what he's doing he said he he he has plans for your life plans to prosper you plans to give you an expected end so he knows what you need spiritually and physically but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added onto you it says not just something but all these things spiritual and physical so seek him with all your heart God Will Supply every need that you have he'll Supply your needs not your geds I'm saying one more time he'll Supply your needs not your geds so amen yes sir Let's us bow our heads in a word of prayer almighty God we just thank you for this Precious Moment Lord thank you for just being God thank you for being so thoughtful and so longsuffering with us Lord father we make so many mistakes on a daily basis I'm so thankful that your blood can cleanse us Lord that you can wash us clean Lord I pray from this day forward Lord we'll no longer try to be in control of every situation of our life but Lord we'll learn to let you have control we'll learn just to lay down and rest in you lay down and surrender Lord in you and oh God May from this day forward may we learn how to do this Lord just teach us Lord Lord I I know the even the the word tells us we don't know how to pray like we ought to pray Lord teach us how to pray teach us how to surrender just teach us how to live a life that you've called us to live and almighty God we just give you the glory and honor and praise and we thank you for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Applause] amen faith has peace conface Assurance peace and confidence thank you brother I'm trying to make sure get my notes um brother um Mark did a wonderful job um and it's it's good to come to church and and um just be strengthened by the word um sister Abby if you would just um bring up the song what a friend we have in Jesus uh for me just put the words there and I'll uh go back to it here in a second um I I I like this statement that brother there's a lot of statements he made but this one regarding uh make sure your faith is not missing substance and the substance that he was saying God's faith uh has Assurance um Peace and confidence um that is just um you know that's just it I don't know I think it's just something that just kind of settles you no matter what you're going through here tonight you got to have assurance and big one is is peace confidence I'm confident that God going to do exactly what he said he going to do I don't know how long it's going to take him but he's still going to do it right and actually what I've learned over the years is the longer it takes the greater the miracle the greater the testimony and another statement that he made there earlier is um uh when he he he said he looked up the word profession and it's an open declaration uh often times uh we have faith and sometimes it's just limited and only people know it is us but sometimes amen when you're confessing Ing and professing something you have to open your mouth yes you got to open it wide and I just thought about you know when he when he said an open profession I thought about the story of John Ryan and um the man had come before the prayer line there with the prophet and um you know brother brandom had told him you know you're healed he was a blind man he says you're healed you're heal and John Ryan left and you know and he's you know he's went a couple days and realized and I'm not seeing yet and uh I'm going to go back to this prayer line and I'm going confront the prophet and it says um I thought you told me that I was healed and brother random say I thought you said that you believed right and uh and and so he he said yeah I do believe he says well he said I tell you what you do you know you just keep going through your day and you just keep saying by his stripes I'm Healed right and that was a profession that was a confession and the man when he would he would sell newspapers blinders I don't know what extra extra Read All About It by his stripes I'm he a conf open profession right and he just kept doing this over and over so finally one day he he done it so many times and people heard him say that he sitting in the barber's chair and the barber said you know you got to stop bringing uh this this you know just disg Grace to uh the kingdom of God because you know you you you say by a Stripes I'm Healed but you you ain't healed you blind he said he says uh Read All About It by his stripes I'm Healed open profession and he took up out the barber chair took off running down the street and the barber running behind him now the same man that told him he was bringing disgrace to the gospel is now a part of the testimony and he chasing the man trying to get him to stop you going to get hit by a car no I'm not I can see the car by his stripes I'm here you got to have a open that's right a open declaration that's what your profession is a open declaration sometimes you got to just tell the doctor I understand what you saying I'm not I I I get it but by his stripes I'm Healed that's my open declaration I believe sister uh Amanda had to do that one time with the doctor and just kind of had an open declaration and God made her body come right in line with what her Declaration was God is a good god brother brother Mark had he he he he he he said we often forfeit our peace and I tell you I don't want to Forfeit mine I I was I was just I was blessed I mean at the beginning of the year we started the year off with our theme yielding to the perfect will of God and here you come and preach yielded and rested as we're coming to the close of the year and I'm like this is just right on time but as he was just singing that and I'm going to give youall a chance to if if anybody has a testimony of praise report and also announcements but before we do that I just want to sing this song just put those words up there for me sister Abby and and I I I'm not going to sing this amen the way that everybody probably know it uh I was as a little boy uh coming up we grew up in the Baptist Church and uh we used to do what they call line the hym amen and this is a hymn that we we sung a little different amen when they would line it and uh so I want to I want to just do it that way amen just for a little bit amen here tonight what fre have [Applause] Jesus all our SS and grief to it is to [Applause] car to God in pray I just heard that when he said that and I had to just line it just one time I I'm not I'm not I'm not going to Forfeit my peace you know what I'm going to tell you I'm going encourage don't let nobody cause you to forfeit your peace he is my peace he is my rock he is my strength he is my Fortress he is my high tower amen that's what he is to me I'm not going to let nobody cause me to Forfeit my peace my God bless you brother Mark we appreciate the word of the Lord on tonight amen amen let me have uh the announcements for tonight and um and and then I'll give you all an opportunity just to share uh um pray rep reports of prayer requests I know this weekend we have um meetings that are coming up um brother Danny is having this meeting there and then also we have um the meeting there in in Port St Lucy with brother Roosevelt um also brother Mario they also call him brother Mario uh uh lamza um but um these two meetings will be happening this weekend

prayer and then uh service at 10:30 and our streaming continues through Twitter uh Facebook and our church website John [Music] 423.15 zel is giving at John 423.15 a testimony or um a u a prayer request that they want to make mention of okay I got two hands so far I got three hands I got four hands all right uh I start in the back back there amen now I think the cameras was so that we can get those that are testifying also on camera is that correct somebody got to move the camera yeah all right amen God bless you Saints um I just have a praise report um on Sunday after after the service I was just overjoyed and I just got home and I was just thinking about the service but what really uh blessed me uh what I'm why I'm here today I was thinking about sister Zelma's testimony and you know I told myself that I am going to you know give a praise report on on Wednesday uh when I have the opportunity but uh it's really a short testimony and uh it's it's not the uh the typical testimony is just really to recognize What the Lord Has Done uh I just want to thank God for his faithfulness uh throughout the year uh I can honestly say God has sustained me and my family uh he has sustained us spiritually he has sustained us financially and physically and our pastor also brought out to uh light uh the scripture I read on the morning to make known his deed among men so I felt it was fitting for me to just share what God has done uh you know uh last year uh went through uh a pretty big uh trial after trial uh but I thank God for his peace and earlier uh in the year or the beginning of the year uh I was in a position where uh my mortgage uh needed to be uh paid in uh uh it was a matter of it was a pretty significant amount um and I was also just beginning a new role in my job uh well my new job actually uh but after prayer and and just trusting in the Lord uh we were caught in in a little uh situation with our mortgage insurance and they decided that they were going to give us what is called Force Place Insurance well to make it short uh for that whole year of last year um they would they were putting us on that Force Place insurance and we had an audit I spoke to my insurance agent and my agent gave me a document she told me to give give it to my mortgage company and so I did and after they did the audit they realized that all the money uh that they were paying on my behalf for the mortgage insurance uh and to point this out the mortgage insurance was uh about triple the amount that I was paying so it's very expensive and after the audit they realized all that money they were paying on my behalf they had to pay me back so uh they sent me a a pretty significant amount of check and that check was sufficient uh more than enough I would say uh to handle our needs uh for our mortgage so I want to thank God for that and just for his faith in us God bless you than you Jesus thank you God bless you church I just want to thank God for the opportunity to go home and visit my aunt and um either even though health is failing and she's uh in dementia she still recognizes and in a home which is the last result that anybody would want to put their mother but she's been well taken care of um also I thank God for the internet cuz y'all had Church up in here with y'all Sunday on the way home and so for God keep and he said keep you from danger seen and unseen we were on the way home Sunday just blinding rain from Montgomery all the way to S St Augustine and um there were cars left and right on the road accidents everywhere and we were in a the far left lane basically stopped in traffic and I looked to the side and there this big 16 wheel truck right on the side of us so he's off the road smoking and everything I said Ashley you realize he just pulled over there keep from hitting us he would have told us up so I thank God that we able to make it home took us probably 12 14 hours to get home but thank you [Applause] Lord sound like that mic went out there on the sister is it is it on I saw another hand uh uh brother Maris yeah um well as pastor know um right before Thanksgiving my grandmother she um she had to go to the emergency room um she had signs and symptoms of a stroke um well as I I was told before it's okay to be hard-headed just be hard-headed about God I can't help who I am but I can change who I do it for um um this year

had to let y'all know just it's okay to be hardhead don't worry about your family God got them it's going to be things the devil going to put in your way it's it's it's a miracle here but he going to put something there to try to try to damp in your light don't worry God got you amen yes sir am God bless you praise the Lord sister Tina God bless you um this morning I was getting ready to go to work and I was just um kind of just mulling around the house and I had planned to get to work early cuz there was something that I needed to do and every time I tried to go out of the house I forgot oh I got to do this and I need to do this before I go out and and as I was looking at the time and I was like okay I really need to get out of here and um as I was getting ready to leave I was like oh yeah the day is garbage day I need to get that out and so I put the garbage out came back um started on my way to work and as I rounded the corner it was like we were going going going then all of a sudden we stopped and there was an accident that had just happened and uh it involved the motorcycle police and the the whole nine yards but I thank God that he protected me um just doing the little things around the house because it had just happened and I just thank God for his grace and just just protecting me from that accident praise the Lord nothing happened by accident I saw two more hands go up in the back back there praise the Lord God bless yall I want to thank the Lord for U protecting Abigail because I seen uh way less things turn out way worse and uh we were at a at a farm uh last weekend and the lady asked Abby had she fell off a horse and and Abby told her no I've been riding for six months and I never fell she said you're going to fall like I guarantee you you're going to fall any writer that hasn't fa is not a writer so she said that so we were at we went to an arena and they were practicing for a competition that they have and yesterday she lost a little bit of control and fell off the horse and the horse like right in front of me stepped completely in her leg like full force and jump back and all she has is a bruise I've seen a horse break somebody's leg with just any any little move to the side and the horse came up and went down on her leg and she only has a bruise that's only by God's grace praise the Lord amen thank God for protecting sister Abby Amen brother Garen God bless you Saints uh first off I just want to say thank you cuz I've been working back at ey glass World these last two days and the favor I've been receiving is overwhelming I mean I went it went everybody shocked that the whatever report they heard prior cuz they were like that's not you and now I've had multiple stores call me within the company th hey we want you to come help us so I thank God for his favor but there's also another part I started I chose to start on Tuesday because I had another interview on Monday for TSA so I did the interview for TSA and I was like I I have a friend of mine that works with IM immigration I was like hey I did the TSA they were like well did you get the email I said well I got the email saying thank you they were like no wait for another email I'm like okay now yesterday while I was at work I received an email stating that I've also been accepted to on board at TSA at Palm Beach International Airport and the the thing about that is I I I I called my friend and spoke to him and then they were like listen let me explain something to you usually the second email you get from TSA is only telling you Thank you for applying and usually most people have to wait at least three to four weeks before you get an offer so for you to get an offer and in Palm Beach county is a miracle in itself cuz they had told me when they originally applied and did TSA they had to work in Fort Lauderdale for 6 months before they could even get in Palm Beach County so the fact that I was able to interview on Monday and already get an offer on Tuesday telling me to report at Palm Beach International Airport they were like oh God has got you cuz that don't happen so I just want to thank God just for opening multiple doors for me I
