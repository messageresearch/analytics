As we turn our attention towards the word of the Lord, we trust that the Holy Spirit would take complete control of our thoughts, both the thoughts that are presented and the thoughts that are received. Uh get glory and honor out of this portion of the service. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We are going to um turn to a book in the Bible uh that's not very familiar for everybody, but we're going to read from it anyway. Hosea Hosea uh chapter 14. I'm going to need just the Lord the monitors for me. Um thank you just a little bit. Hosea uh chapter 14. Um, and I do have this uh on the slide, but I like hearing y'all pages and y'all Bible turned. Amen. But I I I sent a PowerPoint uh for the service. It should be an email and um if she should have the PowerPoint that I sent and everything is there in the PowerPoint. Praise the Lord. Uh let's read from Hosea chapter 14. Um it um says this in verse one. Uh oh Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. uh take with you words and turn to the Lord, say unto him, take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously, so will we render the cows uh of our lips. Asher shall not save us. Uh we will not ride upon horses. Neither will we say uh anymore to the work of our hands. Ye are our gods. Uh for in thee the fatherless find findeth mercy. I will heal their backsliding. Uh, I will love them freely, for my anger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew unto Israel. He shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as Lebanon. Uh they that dwell under his shadow shall return. They shall uh revive as the corn and grow as the vine. The scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found. Uh who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and he shall know them. For the ways of the Lord are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgress transgressors shall fall therein. Amen. The Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word. You can be seated. Praise the Lord. Um, let me just get myself together here. We uh have a title uh for today and uh the title is the restoration of Ephraim. Amen. the restoration of Ephraim. And my inspiration, I was kind of um as I was debating on what what to title this um I I actually started off with the restoration of Ephraim. Then I went to what have I to do anymore with idols and then um I just settled back on the title be restoration of of Ephraim. But the inspiration will be what have I to do anymore with idols? Praise God. Amen. And we pull that right out of the scripture in Hosea 14:8. Uh the scripture says, "Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit f fruit found." Um it's just amazing how the Lord uh just does things. I have uh read through the Bible many a times and uh you know and on the journey this year of reading through the Bible uh once again and uh as I was reading I ran into the scripture and I saw something there that I don't think I've seen um before uh with with Ephraim this being the last chapter of the book of Hosea and uh and Ephraim has separated from the idols The other thing that we found here is that uh we read there in scripture where God said, "I'm going to heal their backsliding." Amen. I'm I'm I I'm going to do this. And and and what I see here, if God is healing the backsliding, then God is blinging bringing a work of restoration uh to Ephraim. Amen. And and as we go through this journey uh here we'll see Ephraim got involved in a lot of uh sinful things uh the book of Hosea speaks a but much of this Ephraim got away from God you know and uh the other thing is that we have to as we navigate this we have to see that this is not just talking about uh Israel or this tribe of Israel the tribe of Ephraim. Uh sometimes we can look at ourselves and be able to see where we have gotten away from God. Hallelujah, somebody. Amen. And and when and if we could just sometimes just take a a inventory, praise God, of where we are in our walk with Christ, how uh we used to be a little closer to him. Amen somebody. Amen. He used to get more of our time, but but uh but somehow we end up backsliding. Amen. But God says, "I will heal your backsliding." Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. I thank God for this promise that he has given us. But let us take our journey. Amen. Uh this morning, the next uh slide uh says, and I and I I was just thinking on this, Brother Quinton made a a statement. I I don't know if it was early this year or last year but we when we started on this journey of I will restore sayeth the Lord uh and then this year this this year being a year of overflow he made a statement says we can see restoration throughout the scriptures. We can see restoration throughout the scriptures and I'm sorry that our our screen is is like this. We might have to we might have to help uh but uh but but you you'll get the gist of it. But we can see restoration uh throughout uh the scriptures. And you know, so when we look at this this scripture, Amen. Today, we're going with and if we get through it all, but we're going to see restoration here in the scripture here. Brother Random says this next uh uh just hit next. uh uh in the sixth seal he says this but when you see scripture dovetelling with scripture making it a constant continuity where they come together the scriptures where this one leaves off here this one this other one over here comes and dovetailes in and draws the whole picture out like putting a crosswork puzzle together like you find the piece that fits in there's nothing else can fit it then you're getting the picture fixed And there's only one can do that. That's the lamb. So, we're looking to him. And as we're looking at this uh uh uh Hosea, we're trying to get Amen. the scriptures doveetailing one with the other. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Because you know what we what we have is um you know and as we as we read just one other scripture in a little bit uh Ephraim got so engulfed in their idols that God said I mean away with Ephraim away with them. But here what we what we're going to see is that even though uh they get to a spot like that, God promises that he's going to heal their backsliding. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So amen. Sometimes people can be in some really bad situations. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. I I mean, they they they've turned to just complete idolatry. But if God has promised that he is going to heal your backsliding, then there's nothing that you can do that'll stop God. &gt;&gt; Amen. From getting glory out of your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your story is for his glory. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. But our our our responsibility is to make sure scripture dovetales with scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us go amen to the next slide here. Uh here we see amen with um with Israel. I I like to call this backsliding Israel. All right. And in Hosea 4 uh verse 16 and 17 it says this, for Israel slideth back as a backsliding heer. That's some strong language, ain't it? &gt;&gt; But it's in your Bible. &gt;&gt; For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heer. Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, I I know sometimes you you see things like that in the Bible and uh it'll jolt you, you know, but but it's in the word, right? It's in the word. And and sometimes God have to use language like that to jolt us, &gt;&gt; right? To get us to kind of think a little bit more, right? But uh but here it says uh for Israel slideth back as a backsliding heer. Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone. Now, let me tell you something. Uh you never want to get to a spot in God &gt;&gt; where God say just leave them alone. &gt;&gt; I don't even want to deal with them anymore. I'm I'm tired of them. You You never want to cross that type of line with God. I I'm tired of they sin and I'm I'm tired of them going back and I'm tired of them up and tired of them down. I'm tired of it &gt;&gt; here. Here the scripture says Ephraim is joined to to idols. Just just let him alone. This you have reached a really bad spot when you're here with God. Hallelujah. It's good to know that you know the scripture didn't stop at Hosea 4. When we get to Hosea 14, we see God going to hear they backsliding. But but you never want to get yourself to a spot where God is just frustrated with you. &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, that happened with the children of Israel one time. I mean, God told God told Moses, he says, "You know what? I'm just so tired of them. I'm tired of they complaining. I I'm tired. I mean, they're not grateful. They they're very ungrateful people. I don't I don't care how much I do for them, they're never satisfied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. But but God say Moses, you know, just just move to the side. I'm going to wipe the whole generation out and I'm going to raise up somebody else to take their place. &gt;&gt; And Moses had to stand in the gap &gt;&gt; for the children of Israel because God was ready to wipe them out. You never want to bring yourself to a spot. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hallelujah. Amen. We we we we we can't we can't uh we can't treat God like a grandfather. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where he just We always want We always want We always want give me this. Give me that. Give me this. Bless me with this. Bless me with that. No, no, no, no, no. You Amen. You going to have to have a re a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; And it's not a oneway relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's going to give to you, what are you giving back? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we go. I I I want to just I I I want to camp here just for a little bit. Ephraim is joined to idols. Idols. Not just one idol. Multiple idols. Now, an idol is an image or representation of a god used as an object of worship. Another definition for idol is a person or thing that is greatly admired, loved or reverent. And they gave some def some examples in um in uh in the dictionary. Uh the de the the example they gave was a soccer idol. &gt;&gt; Now and uh and and if anybody know anything about soccer, I I really that's not a sport that I follow too much. So it it don't hit me the way it might hit a soccer a soccer fan. I I know I know Messi. I I've heard of his name and uh there's a whole bunch of others out there that you know really really good when these guys score goals and they score goals all the time. Uh I mean they become they become idols. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But uh I have to get to something that's a little closer to where I'm at. &gt;&gt; I like basketball &gt;&gt; and I like football. &gt;&gt; And I got to be very careful that I don't allow these things to become idols in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm rushing out of church &gt;&gt; because I got to get home. &gt;&gt; Can I talk to y'all this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm rushing out of church because I got to get I can't fellowship with the saints. &gt;&gt; I got an idol at home. &gt;&gt; It's called a television. &gt;&gt; And and I want to go and see something on that television. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I want to see them catch that ball. And and and you see and and nowadays we got, you know, they they they we we get rid of one idol and then they give us another one. &gt;&gt; And and it's not them. It's the devil that get rid of one idol and then give you another one. I mean, maybe one one one player he has to retire and he can't play anymore, but they got somebody else they raising up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And they keep presenting this person before you. Now, you know, in football, uh, what I got, I mean, they they got they got the the Sanders boys. Everybody got their attention on these boys. Every and even though even though Shu is third string quarterback, everybody know he ain't going to stay there very long. That the devil want to use that guy. &gt;&gt; He got all the boys walking around doing like this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. You're making that man an idol. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And and then they got some coming up in college with NIL deals. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. And and they're the next idol that we'll be following. &gt;&gt; Follow them on Saturday. Following on Sunday, &gt;&gt; and we can't get you to come to church on Saturday and Sunday. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, church. &gt;&gt; But but but but Ephraim was joined to idols, and we don't want to be this way in this hour. This is rapture hour. We don't need to be joined to any idols. Amen. &gt;&gt; The definition said soccer idol, which is sports, sports, sports, sports, basketball. Saint I mean y'all y'all know the devil got us on a cycle. &gt;&gt; Once once football season over, it's time for basketball. &gt;&gt; It's time for baseball. If you hockey fan, it's time for hockey. The devil just got you on a cycle &gt;&gt; and you just locked into the television. You miss prayer meeting because you want to watch television. &gt;&gt; Am I telling the truth? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Here, here here the the I'm giving you just the the the basic def definition from the dictionary.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we talking to anybody? &gt;&gt; Right. You can't even get in their way while they watching the game. Hallelujah. That thing has become their idol. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The other other other uh definition they got is a movie idol. &gt;&gt; And I'm just reading the definition. They say Robert Redford is a movie idol. Now, I don't know all these different actors and everything out there, but I know that there are some actors people love to see them inside of movies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether they got cursing in the movie or not, &gt;&gt; sex scenes in the movie or not, because your favorite actor is in the movie. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Abram is joining God &gt;&gt; to idols. All right. Now, here, you know, we have we have movie celebrities, sports celebrities, music celebrities. Can I talk just a little bit more? &gt;&gt; Y'all don't shut me down just yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but music idols and and and I don't know all the people out there. I don't listen to all their music. I I don't know. But I I do know some of the Christian artists and and I just got to say a lot. Let y'all just let me just unload my spirit. But I got but but but even in the Christian world, &gt;&gt; some of these guys have become our idols, &gt;&gt; right? And and um and what happens here even in the Christian world? Uh uh I mean they they are compromising in every area of of Christianity. I mean they not even Christians no more. &gt;&gt; What's that saying that that you say? I'm a I'm not a Christian artist. I I'm an artist. That's a Christian. What are you trying to tell us? &gt;&gt; I mean, you your the anointing that you got came from the church, &gt;&gt; right? But all of a sudden now you get out on this platform and you become some idol to somebody and you don't want to be identified as a Christian anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we just buying up everything they got. Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; My Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh recently we had a situation here where a young fell went to Sunday Best and he couldn't make it. No. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; when he switched over to was it American &gt;&gt; American Idol, &gt;&gt; all of a sudden he becomes an ex-American Idol. &gt;&gt; And and and and the way he did that, he had to sing secular music in order to win over the secular crowd. And so he sings the secular music, wins over the secular crowd, and then he goes back to the the church to show everybody that he's on top of the world. And when he sings in church, hello somebody. &gt;&gt; I guess some of y'all ain't seen it. &gt;&gt; And if you ain't seen it, don't go look for it. &gt;&gt; But now this boy, when he come to sing in church, he sing with no shirt on. Yeah, &gt;&gt; in the house of God, &gt;&gt; you trying to be a idol to somebody, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, you won't sing here like that, my brother. &gt;&gt; Put some clothes on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; But but but we allow these things and we just be following. I mean, I wouldn't even want to see a man singing in church like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No reverence for God. no respect for God. And then not only that, even the church that every church just trying to get this fell in because he won American Idol. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Ephraim is joined to &gt;&gt; idols. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham makes some statements here and I won't I'm just giving you some some highlights. Says you can make God an idol. You say, you know how you make God an idol is that when you pray and you have it already fixed in your mind how God got to answer your prayer, &gt;&gt; you don't give him the ability to answer the way that he desires to answer it, but you fix it the way that he has to answer the prayer. You make God an idol. &gt;&gt; The brass serpent was given for healing in the Bible to the children of Israel. But but you know, but they got to a spot where, you know, the the thing was if somebody got bit by a snake, turn to the brass serpent and you'll be healed. But they got to a spot people ain't even bit by no snake. They still going to worship the brass serpent. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, watch this now. Because see, idols uhh can be a person. Idols can be a a a sport. Idols can be movie stars. Uh, idols can be anything that's admired or anything like that. You You got to be very very careful. Hallelujah. Can I Can I just make a statement? Just because you got Brother Brandham's a a replica of Brother Brandham's belt buckle, &gt;&gt; it don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible say? These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just because you have replica of things. That don't make you no believer. Everybody walking around with a briefcase ain't a believer. &gt;&gt; Truth, brother. &gt;&gt; All right. I'mma just I mean, because we've sometimes even in the church, we've made Brother Brandham an idol. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'mma just tell it tell it like it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We made the prophet an idol. &gt;&gt; And that's not the way this is supposed to go. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was pointing us to the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm going just say it like this. That's why we don't sing songs here that don't glorify Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us that Jesus is the principal theme of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't sing songs that just glorify the prophet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I know y'all heard them. Don't make me call them out. &gt;&gt; Y'all done heard these songs that only glorify the prophet. You don't hear Jesus nowhere in the psalm. &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the song. But they talk about the prophet. No, we not here worshiping brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; We worship the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, he's not supposed to be an idol. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here here's here's another one. Brother Brandham says uh you know uh and and I want to first the scripture actually say the commandment was not to have another god before the one true and living God. We're not supposed to have any other gods before him. Right? But but sometimes we make idols out of other things. We make gods out of other things. Right? It says uh brother Random says, you know, sometimes you get to church and you get so proud of your church, &gt;&gt; so proud of your pastor, &gt;&gt; you make your pastor an idol. We don't want none of that around here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The these brothers, they have to try to push me to the side. I was here the other night and and I saw him breaking down and I'm like, I can't just let them sit there and break down by the cell. Let me let me let me help out. The brothers say, "No, Brother Jack, I got it. No, brother Jack. I soon as I pick up something, another walk over, Brother Jack, I got it, brother. I now I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; I really appreciate that, but I never want to allow myself to get too high, &gt;&gt; right? that I can't do things that just everybody else can do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even as the pastor, I can clean the bathroom. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; I mean, and my and my my mother-in-law says, "I walk by and see in that little desk and it just it just hurt me. I just want you to I want you to have your own office. One day God going to give me my own office, but right now I sit right there at that little desk and prepare my sermon and come out here and preach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to get too lifted high. &gt;&gt; God God allows things that happen in your life to keep you humble. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So not only do you make your pastor an idol, he say sometimes you can make your church an idol. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Especially when you prosteliting people out of another church. &gt;&gt; Why don't you leave there and come on over here where we at now? Don't talk to them like that. &gt;&gt; Don't proite nobody. Let them be led of the spirit the same way you was led of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; brother. When I I I remember brother Thomas say, "I'm just praying about some things." All right, you keep on praying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you ain't going to hear me calling you on the phone say why don't you come over here. Uh-uh. You going to have to pray about this. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. God has given you options. I'll tell you that much. But pray about which option you should take. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. He said, "Brother Random said, you can make an idol out of an evangelist." &gt;&gt; Who preaching? &gt;&gt; Why you need to know? Because if my favorite preacher &gt;&gt; ain't preaching, &gt;&gt; I won't be there. &gt;&gt; Well, you you got the wrong favorite preacher. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got a favorite preacher as a human being. &gt;&gt; But my favorite preacher is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And he can use anybody to speak to my needs. &gt;&gt; But we're not going to allow evangelists to become our idols. &gt;&gt; True. Oh, hallelujah, somebody. I'm talking about Ephraim join to idols. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give y'all another one that brother Brandham said can be your idol. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, you can make your clothing." &gt;&gt; Yes. True, Lord. &gt;&gt; An idol. &gt;&gt; It's a direct quote. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can make your clothing an idol. And this is what this is what they say. Because you want to be and spam &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; The prophet say you want to be and span &gt;&gt; all the time. Some of us don't wear the same outfit twice &gt;&gt; because we want to be sp and span &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. You can make your clothing &gt;&gt; an idol. That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Especially when you remember you ain't even have nothing in your closet &gt;&gt; and you used to have to wear that same old outfit over and over and over again and you didn't bother you. But then God blesses you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And now you can't be caught in the same outfit twice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, it's getting quiet up in here. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what the prophet said. He say you can make your clothing an idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all about you, ain't it? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; The next on this um slide because here it says, "Israel slideth back as a backslide in heaven. Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. E from his joint to idols. Let him alone hit next for me. Brother Random says, "But on backsliding, remember you backslide every day. There's no way at all for you to keep out of it." All right? But you backslide to the people in the church, not before God. You backslide on Christ, but you don't on God. It says, "Cuz if when when you sin, you're gone. But you're constantly fallen." Constantly fallen. constantly falling. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It says this uh it says Paul had to die every day. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He had to die every day. Repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time. See, and if Paul had to do that, then I'm going to have to I'm going to have to to aren't you. That's right. So Paul said, "I die daily." And guess what? As believers, we have to die daily. True. Lord, I want to die daily. &gt;&gt; Here, this next slot says again, Hosea 14:8, Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." So, Ephraim this question uh what what have I to do anymore with idols? What what what what do I want to do with Lord? I don't want to be associated with these things. I want to be so so so so tied up in Jesus that these the worldly things don't mean nothing to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got to get that way. Few observations here about um uh the book of Hosea. Hosea is located just before Joel in a canical uh uh canonical uh order of scripture. So I I noticed that cuz Joel talks about the restoration. But here Hosea is coming right before the book of Joel in the canonical order of scripture. The other thing we find is Hosea's name actually meant salvation. The name Hosea meant salvation. And uh and and I find it very strange because Hosea was a prophet that was told to marry an unfaithful wife. She was an adulteress. and what would happen in their in their marriage. Now, here God tells the man to marry this woman knowing that this woman is is unfaithful. She's a prostitute. And he goes and he marries her and she she she uh she she she slips out on him once and he finds her and he brings her back to his house and then she slips out on again. He goes back and he finds her and he brings her back to constantly going through this this cycle of restoration with his wife. Now, now, now most men would not want to marry a woman that he knew was going to be unfaithful to him. &gt;&gt; No man would want to do that. But, but you got to understand something about this is when you look at uh what what God is doing in the life of Hosea. Amen. It was symbolic of what was happening with the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only was it happening with the children of Israel, sometimes our lives reflect the same pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is constantly coming to get us out of something that he done delivered us from once before. &gt;&gt; Y'all, I'mma say it again. God is constantly coming to get us out of something that he has already delivered us from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But somehow we find our way right back into these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Didn't God deliver you from makeup? &gt;&gt; Why you back into it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brothers, God deliver you from short pants. What? Oh, you got an excuse cuz you playing basketball. You can play basketball in sweatpants. &gt;&gt; Hello. God deliver you from gossip and you find your way right back into it. &gt;&gt; Hello, church. &gt;&gt; Y'all still here today? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being been I mean delivered from these idols in our life. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here told to marry a a unfaithful wife. She's an adulteress. But also what we see is Israel. Amen. Is Jehovah's adulterous wife. The next uh just hit next. Israel is Jehovah's adulterous wife repudiated, but ultimately to be purified and restored. That's the theological definition. Amen. When you look at the book of uh Hosea, it's it's talking about a a a greater picture here. Not just Hosea and his wife and and but but it's it's this Ephraim, the tribe of Ephraim, how they get just engulfed in idolatry, right? But here, you know, it's it's a it's symbolic of Israel being Jehovah's adulterous wife, repudiated, which means she refused to accept or to be associated with. My God, repudiate, but ultimately to be purified and restored. Ultimately, she's going to be purified and ultimately she is going to be restored. I'm telling you, amen. I don't care what the devil got you in today. Ultimately, you will be restored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go a little further here. I want to on this next slide just bring in a little thought because we're we're going to when we look at um the book of Hosea we have to look at it from both the spiritual and the natural natural types of spiritual. I think we heard that on the tape on Friday night wonderful tape that we listen to on the countdown. Uh but brother Brandham talked about how the natural type the spiritual and when we look at uh how uh Hosea's wife was constantly committing adultery on him or fornication. Amen. Brother Random uses those word interchangeably. He says the church is also committing spiritual fornication and adultery. The church is doing that. Now let's look at something here. Bear with me here. I want to I really want to camp out on this one. What did they do from the Pergamian church age? What did they do? Bailac's teaching come down amongst Israel and they invited all the Israelites up to this big feast, the big blowout. He's talking about Balam. And Bailac, remember uh Bailac had hired Balum to come down and curse Israel, but he couldn't curse him three times. He blessed Israel uh rather than cursed him. And and and and that that's the thing when you know when God has blessed you, can't nobody curse you. &gt;&gt; Can't nobody curse you, right? And and here even even had God had a donkey talking to you know the uh the prophet and letting him know why he didn't go a particular way and and the man after even talking to the donkey should have known to just turn around and go back home. But yet he got this he's he's headstrong. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another thing that he was going for. They were going to give him prestige and they were going to give him money. &gt;&gt; So he he disregarded everything God was all the supernatural things God was doing. He disregarded all that in order to press forth for prestige and for money. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us are running after money and running after prestige. &gt;&gt; You want to become an idol. &gt;&gt; So Balam could not curse him. So what he did was tell Bailac, "Invite them to church. Invite them to a service. And uh and when they get here to the service, there gonna be certain things happening here that's going to cause God to kind of come against them himself. &gt;&gt; My Lord. &gt;&gt; And watch this. Bailak's teaching come down amongst Israel and they invited all the Israelites up to this big feast. That's where you better know where you're going. &gt;&gt; The big blowout they had. Oh, some big party shindig of a thing up there. they had when they got up there. Why these Israelite people began to see these pretty sexy dressed Moabitete women. Now, let me just camp out there for a little bit. You know, when the Israelites Oh, let let me Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Um, you know, uh, it used to be a time that you could identify Pentecostal people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It used to be a time we, you know, Baptist people carried a certain they they carried themselves a certain way. They dress a certain way. Uh, Pentecostal people dress a certain way. Uh, Catholic people kind of dressed a certain way, right? I mean, you can kind of see the difference, especially with the Pentecost people, cuz they only wore dresses and skirts. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about back in the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, you can tell holiness people by the way that they dress. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. And and and I want to tell you that I mean, being a message believer, there is a certain way that we dress as message believers that we do not look like the others. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to look like the others. We're not trying to look like the others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me This quote says that they went amongst the Moabitish women and they were sexy dressed. Sexy dress. I wonder what that looks like. Sexy dress. I can tell you part of what it looked like is a sister with a big old split up her dress. &gt;&gt; And you know, my pastor used to say it like this. You ain't got nothing for sale. &gt;&gt; Take your signs down. &gt;&gt; But when you walk in that split, the way it it the what? Just just notice where they put the split at. Cuz when you walk, a man just looking right up your legs. &gt;&gt; And then when you sit down, you can't even sit down even to fix the dress to come on. Right. &gt;&gt; If it's too If it's too low, &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress. If it's too tight, &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress. If it's low cut, &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, sisters. We don't want to be sexy dress. &gt;&gt; We want to use a different word that end with a Y. It's a four-letter word that end with a Y. &gt;&gt; Holy dress. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And And can I can I go a little further? Because that word holy, h O L Y, can also lead into another word, holy. W H O L L Y. &gt;&gt; Holy dress. &gt;&gt; Not sexy dress. That's not what we looking for here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me Let me go further. I'm We going to get rid of these idols. &gt;&gt; We're going to get rid of these idols. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I went to a funeral yesterday &gt;&gt; and we there just, you know, bringing our support to this pastor who lost his wife. the pastor lost his wife and wife in the church, the wife that's married to the pastor is considered the first lady of the church and we're there, you know, and and I just so much that I'm seeing of how far the church has gotten away from God. &gt;&gt; It used to be a time where you saw the the homosexual men coming and they leading the choir and playing the instruments. I'm talking when I was back in Baptist, there was a we had homosexual musicians, multiple homosexual musicians. One of them got caught in the bathroom somebody with some boys or something like that. Just I mean just it was just always problems like that with with men. But now you see the women kind of coming out too. &gt;&gt; And this one woman I mean my uh the way you dress you telling us what you are. You are the man in a relationship. and and and and you the man in relationship, but you going to come up here and sing and say, "Come on, put your hands together. Come on, everybody. I I I can't clap my hands to this. &gt;&gt; I just and and the church won't say nothing about it. Spirits everywhere." &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. I'm going just say it like this. I was just just meditating on and and I want to say these things. Church has simply become a sound. [Applause] Exactly. I &gt;&gt; if it sound if it sounds good and and and and and there's no sound like the church sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, so so so you get some singers, you get some musicians, you get all this together and they create that church sound and these people feel like they had church, but nobody is condemned about the lifestyle that they're living. &gt;&gt; Church is not just a sound. Church is where our lives are changed by the power of God. How can I sit here and and enjoy this? &gt;&gt; Now, now let me tell you something. As a human being, if I can sit there and I can't enjoy that, I know God don't enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did you get delivered from? How you going to sing about deliverance and sing you going to heaven like that? No. No. You You ain't going to bypass the scripture. All people got to do when you see people coming to church like that, just read the word of God. Read read Romans, read read uh uh Genesis 19. I mean, they talk about homosexuality in the scripture, it is not accepted by God. Just like a adulterous life is not accepted by God. &gt;&gt; You know, somebody living in a life of adultery, they up there preaching and singing, "No, man. Come on, man. That ain't going to work." Amen. &gt;&gt; Something in my spirit just don't agree with it. Amen. But I'm sitting there and ladies were sitting behind me and I heard the ladies say, um, cuz brother Bram say it went the Israelites began to see these pretty sexy dressed Moabitete women, not Israelite women, Moabitete women. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting there and and this will happen when you kind of go into some of these circles. You you'll get amongst the Moabitete women and you'll get inspired by these Moabitete women &gt;&gt; rather than being inspired by the Israelite women. &gt;&gt; Now the Moabitete women, I'm sitting there and and and we had a funeral. Lady uh there was it was a packed funeral. So people moving all over the place and everything. So lady got up and sat with her friends. And as she was getting up to sit with her friends, her friends say, "Hey, before you sit down, take a picture. Take a picture. Take a picture. Take a picture of me." I'm like, "You doing selfies &gt;&gt; at the funeral." But it's not it's not just doing selfies. It's more than that. is how she did the selfies &gt;&gt; in the church &gt;&gt; at a funeral. &gt;&gt; I'mma shock you. I'm going to say something that's going to shock you, but this is what I heard and I'm just telling you what I heard. She said, "Take my picture. Take my picture and make sure you get my butt [Music] &gt;&gt; in the church at a funeral." And then to come to find out it was her own pastor's wife that was dead. &gt;&gt; And all you can say is make sure you get my butt in a selfie picture. &gt;&gt; Sin in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; can I tell y'all something? See y'all young people that want to take these selfies. If that's the spirit that's on you that you want people to see your butt, &gt;&gt; you got a bad a evil spirit on you. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That is not how you take no picture. No, sir. &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing holy about that at all. &gt;&gt; That's That's why we got to be so careful where what what what influences we pick up on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You you I mean, let me tell you something. I mean, uh we talk about celebrities as idols. We talked about uh sports stars as idol, but you know, social media got all kind of idols all over it. influencers influencing you to do the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; You follow this page, you ought to see what they doing. You got to and you better watch it because AI is all intertwined. Soon as you click on one person here, &gt;&gt; next thing you know, they start sending you all these other people because, oh, you like that and you like that. Maybe you're going to like this and maybe you're going to like they just keep flooding you with stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to myself, what in the world is going your pastor's wife &gt;&gt; is here in a casket and all you can think about is taking a selfie picture in the church and ask people to make sure you take a picture of my butt. I sat there and I said, "Lord have mercy." Yeah, &gt;&gt; Ephraim is joining the idols. &gt;&gt; The problem with these, you know, selfies is a is a word that was never even a word until this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and I know there's a scripture there in Timothy that talks about being lovers of themselves. more than lovers of God. Right? And and the problem with most of these self I'm saying most of them are t are taken in a sensual or a sexy way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't get no likes. You just standing there looking plain. &gt;&gt; So you got to do a little something something in order to get some likes. Let me ask you a question. Who's liking your material? [Music] &gt;&gt; If I as the pastor can't like it, &gt;&gt; sometime I see something, &gt;&gt; a saint &gt;&gt; post something like that. &gt;&gt; That's because you're getting your influence from somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me tell you, brother Brandham say it's really it's like you you get you either get an influence from the underworld trying to pull you down &gt;&gt; or you get an influence from the upper world trying to pull you up. &gt;&gt; Powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you want to test to see how how popular you are, how much an idol you are, post a scripture &gt;&gt; and see how many likes you get. Lord, &gt;&gt; y'all going to let me talk to y'all today? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going just make some more comments cuz this what came to me while I was thinking on this. Why do people drag up their past pictures and show them to the world? I'm talking the pictures of you in your makeup, you in your earrings, you in your, you know, I mean, you and your your your your pants, right? You know, brothers in their shorts. Why y'all drag up the old pictures and show them to the world? And you just put the picture out there with no explanation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But then when somebody question say, "Oh, I'm just trying to show people where I came from." Well, tell them where you came from. &gt;&gt; And then show them a picture where how God delivered you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I used to be this way, but this is the way I am now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go a little further. &gt;&gt; Sisters want to look pretty. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us that. Sisters just want to look pretty. I'm going to say amen. I know sisters want to look pretty. Y'all ain't Y'all ain't going to tell me. Y' ain't going to say nothing cuz y'all don't know where I'm going. I I'm I'm going towards your idols. That's what I'm going. Sisters want to look pretty. That's what brother Brandham told us. Sisters, y'all have to always fight that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They fought it in brother Brandham's day. They're going to fight it today. &gt;&gt; Sister, let me just tell you something. When you push the envelope &gt;&gt; with your high heels, &gt;&gt; somebody going to always go further than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're going to use you as the example. As this I saw sister so and so do this, &gt;&gt; so I'm just going to go a little further. You don't want to be that sister that they look at as example &gt;&gt; in a negative way. Right, &gt;&gt; sis. Well, you just want to just do a little bit with my fingers &gt;&gt; and just a little bit with my toes. &gt;&gt; Now, it's not actually painting them, but it's right on the &gt;&gt; right on the edge. &gt;&gt; Guess what? Somebody &gt;&gt; going to take it further &gt;&gt; looking at what you just did, right? I'mma just do a little something here with my eyebrows. &gt;&gt; Somebody &gt;&gt; going to take it further. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What about the hairstyle? &gt;&gt; Somebody going to take it further. And let me tell you something. It's always the younger generation that suffers the most. &gt;&gt; So the older generation got to set a better example &gt;&gt; because the younger generation going to take it further. Way out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you can't stop them. And and and I I just I just I just got a I I got a question. Where does it stop? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What what's the stopping point? &gt;&gt; And I I mean we got quotes for everything. I I remember somebody showed me a quote where they got one quote from Brother Brandon said that if you had a blemish in your face, then just put a little something on your face. Why is it that they grabbed to one quote &gt;&gt; one that say that when he got thousands &gt;&gt; that say don't put on makeup? Mhm. &gt;&gt; See what I'm going to tell you something. When you gravitate to the one quote, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; it shows what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's exactly true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Because you I can give you a thousand others that say he say don't do that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Skint tight weenies. &gt;&gt; Anybody heard them quotes before? &gt;&gt; Anybody heard that? Brother Ram say the lady look like a skin tight weenie dressing in clothes that look like look like skin tight women. Now I thought to myself now and you look at pictures way back way back in them days look like people look like no skin tight we wenies in and that but today &gt;&gt; that form fitted dress &gt;&gt; that ain't the right dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and here's the other thing now. Oh Lord Jesus. Some of us have different bills. &gt;&gt; Right. You might be able to get away with a what they call it, a a A-frame uh skirt. A-ine skirt. A a a person that ain't ain't, you know, they might be able to get away with that. But another person is like, you can't get away with that. But I saw sister sister so and so with the A-ine. You can't wear that. God did not give you a A-line body. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to have to just &gt;&gt; be grateful &gt;&gt; for who God made you &gt;&gt; and find the clothing that fit you &gt;&gt; and make you look good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you go to the A-line, you look like a skin tighten &gt;&gt; weenie. Straight. Straight. &gt;&gt; Straight. &gt;&gt; This the straight. &gt;&gt; Okay. Straight. You can't wear straight. &gt;&gt; You need flare. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you still look good in flare. &gt;&gt; Now, I'mma I'mma just say this cuz I I really feel it it would be very good for my wife to do another modesty class. Now hold on y'all clapping. But here's the problem. Here's the problem. When my wife do that modesty class, &gt;&gt; make sure people are here. &gt;&gt; If you got to go pick them up, &gt;&gt; cuz you know, we don't want to be sexy dressed. &gt;&gt; Modesty is the word that we're looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did I get all my notes here? Let me just make sure. Oh. Oh, yeah. When you just decide just to show a little bit of your chest, &gt;&gt; somebody else going to take it a little further than that. &gt;&gt; And and it's going to be sexy dressed women walking all around the church. That's not what we're looking for here. And brother Random say the Holy Ghost would not have a Holy Ghost fil sister dressed in such a way to cause a holy Holy Ghost fil brother to lust after her. &gt;&gt; That ain't the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's a ghost, &gt;&gt; but not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do I feel like it's April? Because April we do spring cleaning &gt;&gt; and today the Holy Ghost wanted to do a little spring cleaning. &gt;&gt; Ephim Ephraim Ephraim connected to them idols and God said let Ephraim alone. I'm tired of them being connected to these idols. I'm just I'm just tired of it. God don't want it no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to do an inventory. Personal inventory. &gt;&gt; I'm going further. We ain't we ain't where we where we want to be. This this I'm going to tell you this sermon goes a lot deeper, but we got have we got to deal with the surface things first before we can get to the deep things. &gt;&gt; Let me read this quote. What do they do? Bailac's teaching come down amongst Israel and they invited all the Israelites up to this big feast and the big blowout they had. Oh, some big party shindig of a thing up there they had. And when they got up there, why these Israelites people begin to see these pretty sexy dressed women, Moabitete women. And now I I just even when brother uses a term shindig of a thing up there, they had what what he's telling you is that the music that they were playing &gt;&gt; wasn't even appropriate. Right. Right &gt;&gt; now in church nowadays, they done brought the brought uh uh secular music into the church. &gt;&gt; I just watched a little video uh uh um the pastor up there talking about we going to have to make some changes. We got to make some changes. And they had a a track and they would set it up just right for the church. Uh they had a track where when the pastor said we gonna have to make some change with our music. we have to elevate. We have to do this. They had the track that said, "Everybody dance now." And the pastor looked and the pastor took off and start dancing. And the musicians jumped in with the track and start playing the music. And I'm like, "Shindig in the church." &gt;&gt; Not here. &gt;&gt; Not here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If if you got to do that in order to win people, you ain't won nobody &gt;&gt; cuz they life ain't been changed. &gt;&gt; Let me go a little further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm Brother Brandham said these things and sometimes we just read right over the top of them. Let's stop and really process what's being said to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Oh why the Holy Ghost said that. &gt;&gt; What radio station you got on your car? What station are you listening to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't We as believers don't feed on anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We need We need the word. If you want to have a victorious day, you want your business to be blessed, you need to be listening to the word. &gt;&gt; Not some secular radio station. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Secular talk people. You know the ones that just be cursing up and saying anything that go No, no, no. You can't feed your spirit that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello church. &gt;&gt; Some big party shindig of a thing up there they had. And and when they when they got up there while these Israelites people began to see these pretty sexy dressed moabitete women. Yes. Wasn't like their common girls down there. Lord have mercy. Jesus. Can I I'm just here now. Y'all just let me talk to you. &gt;&gt; Um, my brothers, the sisters in the church will never look like them women out there in the world. &gt;&gt; And if you trying to compare a sister in the church with one of I mean them some of them women out Oh Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; They done went through a lot of changes to get the body that they got. That's right. and you just looking and then you just No, look, &gt;&gt; stay with an Israelite woman. &gt;&gt; If you want if you want one to take care of your your kids, you better stay right there. That praise God. &gt;&gt; And and some some fella, Lord have mercy, just heard an article of a pastor that got married. &gt;&gt; Didn't even know. Didn't even know &gt;&gt; he married &gt;&gt; a man. [Music] in the church and he done courted this this man in the church. Man that's dressed like a woman and and and and made up like a woman. He like, "Boy, this a this is a nice nice sister right here." Come to find out when he got married, she wasn't a sister. You run out there and it chasing stuff if you want to. &gt;&gt; You better stay right here with one of these message sisters. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say you can't have it all. &gt;&gt; Say one might have a great figure but not a great face and one might have a great face but not a great figure. I'm telling y'all what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said you can't have it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Anyhow, look, I I I mean, we might as well just let the rubber hit the road because I mean cuz cuz people, you know, this is why we do these selfie things. I mean, after that lady took that picture, then she say, "I don't like it. I look fat." [Applause] I it took everything in me just not to say nothing. You first of all, you shouldn't even be in here taking no pictures like this. I had a funeral and then you going to get upset by not liking the picture. I mean, it should have it should have been like in brother Brandham where the picture didn't even come out. &gt;&gt; You in here doing something like this in the church of the Lord, in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, look y'all. Look, look, look, look, look. &gt;&gt; We We got to get back to, you know, we got to get back to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We We got to get away from this what society is pulling us into. We we we don't want to get to a spot where God say, I mean, you so join your idols, just let them alone. I don't want nothing to do with them. &gt;&gt; Don't get that way with God. &gt;&gt; What God's trying to use is this word to bring you to a place of restoration. Brother Brandon goes on to say this says when they got up there while these Israelite people began to see these pretty sexy dress Moabitete women. Yes. Wasn't like their common girls down there. Oh, they look so pretty. my how how they were made and oh uh how they could show themselves and they fell for it and began to commit adultery and Balam know if God wouldn't curse curse them he'd take them over on this denominational side and cause the anger of God to kill them anyhow let God kill them himself if he could ever get them out of the way of the truth now what happened there in that story is you had a leader uh um uh uh like a a minister son that got with a priest daughter of the of the other nations. So a a minister son of the Israelites and then he gets with a priest daughter of the Moabites and he start he start they he would go get that girl bring her into the tent and and there in the amongst the children of Israel just sinning like crazy in the tent. There was one fell got so upset with what he brought into the tent amongst his own people. Some of us we lose the fear &gt;&gt; of what we bringing into the church. &gt;&gt; Especially when it come to some boy or some girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's best for you not to bring them. If they got if they got a spirit on them, don't bring you don't bring them. What you ought to be able to detect that spirit and say, "I'm going to get you connected to one of the brothers in the church. Let that brother bring it." Oh, I'm out here again. You mean he ain't got no car yet &gt;&gt; and he need you to bring him? &gt;&gt; That should be a red flag right there. Don't let the devil just give you anything. &gt;&gt; But this man brought brought this lady into the tent and and and one of the fellas got so upset, he took a javelin. &gt;&gt; While he was in the act of whatever they doing, he took a javelin and went through both of them. And God said, "I appreciate what he just did." Getting rid of the sin in the camp, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A lot of them died because of getting involved in this feast of Bal Peor. A lot of lot of them died. idol worship. God don't like it, y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People died in scripture because of idol worship. And we got to realize we got many idols right in front of us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we die because of idol worship. This next quote, Brother Brandham says this. It says, uh, "And as soon as you walk out and join church instead of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're dead." Not for you, but on here, I'm I'm letting that soak in. Soak a little while dead. You have a name, said to Luther, here of the Sardis Age. It says the word Sardis means dead. You have a name that you're alive, but you're dead. So you go to church, you got, you know, y'all got the music, y'all got the choir, but you dead as I don't know what the word sardis means dead. You have a name that you're alive, but you're dead. That's what God said. Yes. See, and when they had committed spiritual fornications up there, the church married from the baptism of Holy Ghost to denomination, they become dead. There you are. That's what the Bible said. That's what God said. Speaking to the churches. The next part of this quote, uh, brother Random says, "And God," what did he do? He says, "And now when they did this evil thing," so when they brought when the children of Israel went there to the feast of Bal Peor, he says, "When they did this evil thing and they were in adultery, spiritual adultery, they worshiping an idol God, uh God killed 42,000 of them at one time." It says 42,000 uh for committing adultery. And what is it? And what is it spoke of here in the church? Look at this. The spiritual adultery that you profess to be a Christian and still living like the world. So you know when you commit submit spiritual adultery is when you profess man I Yes, I'm a believer. Yes, I'm a believer. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Now how you living &gt;&gt; after you singing? Right. Right. And if y'all just listen to the tape on on on on on Friday night, the countdown, if you didn't listen to it, I I I would tell you listen to it. Everything lot that we done dealt with, uh, Brother Brandon was telling people, it says, uh, you know, you want to be free, you know, from things that that God that that you've been bound with. He says, you know, you don't want to smoke no more. &gt;&gt; He also said this, you don't want to drink no more. &gt;&gt; He said it on the tape. So, so how believers gonna feel comfortable drinking when drinking is something the prophet say you get delivered from? &gt;&gt; And that's that's just one tape. There's many others that Come on y'all. Look at &gt;&gt; his daddy had a moonshield a a moonshine still. &gt;&gt; The man hated drinking. &gt;&gt; And even the angel said, "Don't you drink or smoke because I have a work for you to do when you get older." If the angel lord telling the prophet that he's also telling us the same thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't God is not pleased with any of that. No sir. &gt;&gt; So how you going to justify that in scripture? &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritual adultery is when you profess to be a Christian and you're still living like the world. I don't want to I I don't want to profess to be a Christian and still live like the world. I if I'm going to if I'm going to profess to be a Christian, I'mma be I'mma be a real Christian. &gt;&gt; And I used to say, me and my brother used to say like this. Look, if we not if I'm not going to serve God, if I'm not going to serve God, I ain't going to play with him. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to play with him. I'm going just go out here and do what I'm going to do, but I ain't going to play with God. If I if I made the choice that I'm not going to serve him, I'm going just go out here and do what I'm I'mma do. But I tell you what, when I decided that I was going to serve God, I stopped doing what I wanted to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. &gt;&gt; And I follow what God wants me to do. &gt;&gt; Spiritual adultery is that you profess to be a Christian and still living like the world. Brother, receive you the Holy Ghost. Receive you the Holy Ghost. Get away from these old creeds and things. They're dead. Recite the Apostles Creed and some kind of creed and say a few prayers. Wrote out of a prayer book or something like that. Jesus never did tell his people to say a prayer. He said, "Pray, pray, pray." All right. Lord knows I I saw that yesterday, too. Somebody invited to pray. But then I wrote that prayer all the way out and had where I'm going to have certain inflections inflections at this point. This point I'm going to make my prayer a sermon because they didn't they didn't ask me to preach. So I'm going to preach in my prayer. sit down. &gt;&gt; I um I'm going to give you just a couple more things here and then I want to I got to I I I got to come back and do part two to this. I had to get the I had to get the foundation out of the way before I can bring the spiritual application here. And um Ephraim Ephraim made a statement, "What shall I do? What shall what have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him, observed him. I'm like a green fur tree. From from me is thy fruit found. On the next slide there, let me just uh help you to see that in this um this prophecy towards Ephraim is not towards an individual, but this prophecy is towards a tribe. It's not a person. It's not this is the entire tribe of Ephraim that has gone through this um just being man sold out to idolatry &gt;&gt; and God was God made a promise to them and and I want to just I want to show you something here that the the the scripture said I have heard him and observed him I am like a green fur tree from me is thy fruit found next for me let's find out who Ephraim is Uh Genesis 41 verse 51 and 52 gives us a little background of who Ephraim is and where this tribe comes from. Ephraim the Bible uh tells us Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. But God said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house. And verse 52 says, "And the name of the second call he Ephraim, for God have caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction." Now look at that. Now Ephraim's original um uh uh his name actually meant to be fruitful. Hallelujah. But unfortunately we find the tribe of Ephraimid is they are in idolatry. But God actually established them to be fruitful. Now when they get restored, this is why when you look at the scripture in Hosea 148:18, uh uh it should be 14:8. I I made a mistake there. Uh Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. For me is thy fruit found." When they come back to a place of restoration, the fruit will begin to bear again. Sometimes you've lost your ability to bear because of some of the stuff that you got in. You know what? You used to have dreams that God would give you. You used to have visions that God would give you. You used to walk in a certain place with God that he just I mean, you had fellowship with him. But somehow you lost that. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. When you can put away them idols, &gt;&gt; you start seeing the fruit of that come back into your life. Let me just stop there for today because this is where we're going to make our turn and we're going to go into this deeper part of Ephraim, you know, and and how God's going to restore him. But I I I'm here to tell you like like Ephraim said, "What have I to do anymore with idols?" Let that be a question that settles and registers in your heart. What are the idols that are in my life and what have I to do anymore with them? &gt;&gt; God, today is my day. I'm going free from these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You done delivered me before and I need to stay delivered. &gt;&gt; Not go back and pick these things up again. I'm telling church, we got to fight with everything we got. We got to fight. &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing to do with idols. &gt;&gt; I'm too close to a rapture. &gt;&gt; I don't need I don't need these idols. I don't need any of that. Look, some of the stuff that uh I get myself involved with, they won't be doing that in heaven. &gt;&gt; They won't be doing it in heaven. &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now, you ain't going to be sitting around watching no football game in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's not going to happen. Soccer game, that ain't going to happen. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. &gt;&gt; Looking for the next concert. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to happen in heaven. &gt;&gt; And I'm not telling you that you can't do some of these things, but keep a balance with all this. Don't let Don't let it over overtake you. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, who the next movie? What's the next movie coming out? Uh-uh. I'm not following it. Cuz every movie they come I mean now they they got the thing now where where they try to give you um cuz all the curse and all that. So now they give you what's this new thing? Um yeah, it's Vid Angel. And they try to block out all the scenes and stuff like that. So you see you don't see nothing. It's still stuff slipped right on through all of that. &gt;&gt; What we need is just a heart where we don't even desire it anymore. God, I don't even want it. I don't even want it. I don't even need it. That that stuff don't need that stuff don't do nothing for me. It is not helping me spiritually. &gt;&gt; I want to put away my idols. I got I I want to give up my idols. I I'm reminded of a story there in in um Genesis 35. Um, Jacob was leaving his father, his his father-in-law, Laban. And as he was leaving Laban, he didn't realize that his wives had stole the father's idols. When he stole those idols, Laban came chasing Jacob down like, you know, y'all done left. You done left with my grandkids. You done did this. And the worst thing you did, you know, stole my idols. He said, well, who got the idols? He said, I ain't got your idols. I'm not taking your idols. He said, "I tell you what, anybody you find with the idols in this camp, you can kill them." Well, his beloved wife was the wife that had the idols. Rachel had these idols. And um and what she did was sit on the idols. And she lied to her dad and said, "Now, you know, it's my time of the month and I can't get up." But she's sitting on top of his idols and he couldn't find them. So, he left Jacob alone. but not knowing that the idols there. So, Jacob, Jacob, after after Laban left, Jacob come to find out that Rachel got the idols and and and and the and the sisters done come up with this plan where they took their daddy's idols. He's like, "Why would y'all do something like that?" And then he told him, "Before we go into the next step," he said, "Put away the strange gods that are in your midst." And you know what the Bible say they did? The strange gods were in their ears and in their hands and they had to put away them strange gods. Young people, that's why the sisters here don't wear earrings because it's a part of idol worship. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham taught us those things. Amen. And I know sometime you say, "What? How can we just not be like the No, no, no, no, no. We can't be like the Moabitete women." &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be like the Israelite women. I'm going tell you, Pentecostal people used to look Pentecostal. Baptist people used to look Baptist. But I'm going to tell y'all something. Message people going to have to look message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say you believe it, live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word, Lord. As the scripture has challenged us, we read there in the book of Hosea, Ephraim was so joined to idols, couldn't uh get himself free. from it. But Lord, you made a a promise that you, oh God, would you would heal the backsliding. We find ourselves in a situation like that today. We need you to heal our backsliding. We backslide every day. Lord, we we need uh a a checkup and inventory, Father. just where we are in our in our walk with you. For Lord, we want to live lives that are pleasing to thee. Sometimes we do things that are pleasing to us. But Father, uh when you went to a cross that wasn't pleasing to you, you went for the purpose of us. So now, Father, when we give up things of this world, Lord, sometimes it's it's not it's not pleasing to us, but it's pleasing to you. So we want to do these things for the for your glory and for your honor. Let the word give us direction. Let the word give us instruction. Let the word, Lord Jesus, just lead us and guide us. Those that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. So Lord, I pray that uh you would help us, Lord, to be able to see ourselves in this that you, Lord Jesus, would would uh Lord, just bring us to a place of of true repentance. Just bring us to a place, oh God, Lord, where we can surrender all things uh to thee. We want to be more like you, oh God. Thank you for the inspiration, Father, of this sermon. And Lord, it's you you bring these things for a purpose because you don't want to see a church get to uh my Lord, like the the the denominational church today. You're you're nowhere even inside the church. The people have a sound just like Israel had a sound. Lord, when uh Moses and Joshua coming out of the mountain, it Moses Joshua thought, man, this is a great sound. There must be something great happening in the camp. Didn't realize the people were down there worshiping an idol god. Lord, this goes beyond a sound. A life must be manifested daily. So Lord, I pray that you would help us, oh God, to receive what the spirit is speaking to us. We lay ourselves on the altar, Father, that you Lord would consume us with your fire. It's in the name of Jesus that we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Let's sing a chorus of this song. I surrender all. Brother Solomon, I'll turn the service over to you and God bless you church. Amen. [Music] Say oh to Jesus I bless you my brother. All to him I freely give. I will ever love and trust him in his presence daily. [Music] I surrender to all. I surrender all to thee might [Music] I surrender all [Music] to Jesus I surrender humbly at his feet. I bow worldly pleasures. All forsaken. Take me Jesus. Take me now. Say I surrender all. [Music] Surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior I surrender all. All to Jesus I surrender. Make me savior, holy thine. Let me feel thy holy spirit truly know that thou are mine. Yeah. [Music] Oh, all to thee my [Music] serving. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. How many appreciates that message? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The Lord speaks things like this because he loves us. &gt;&gt; He don't want us to be wrong. Sometimes Satan will come in and a little thing just creep in your life and then he'll get a stronghold cuz you thought it was something, you know, something just nice, but then it becomes an idol to you. You start putting those things before God, then you start watching your whole family fall apart. Not just your life. It may start your life and then your whole family. And then you'll see things creeping into the church because we let we allow an idol to show up in our lives. When brother Brandon said, a true Christian life is living for others. You're not just living for yourself. The things that you do in your during your quiet time is not just for yourself. God is molding you and shaping you because you're a part of the body to benefit this body. You want to be an asset to the body of Jesus Christ. So when this word is preached, you take it. You go meditate on it. You re-evaluate your life. Get rid of the idols. You don't want no part of it. It may not be sin, but it's an idol. It's something that you putting before God. Sometimes he call us to get quiet, set aside and pray, but the game is on. Go pray. But Lord, the game is on. Then you hush that that voice. Then one of your brothers and sisters get in an accident and you could have been the one God wanted to use to pray to stop the accident from taking place. We're all a part of the body. We got to get rid of the idols. The prophet of God also said you can make your husband or your wife an idol. Your children can be an idol. Whatever you put before God is an idol. Let's get rid of the idols. Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for your love for us. And truly, you put your love on display by taking our pastor, Lord, anointing him and using him and inspiring him to bring such a message at this time, Lord Jesus. Father God, thank you for our pastor, Lord, for yielding to you, Lord. Father, it's all your love being on display. Father, I don't get upset when I hear things like this. I don't get upset with my pastor. I love them even more. I love you even more because it's your grace, Lord, keeping us out of trouble. Father, I need my brothers and sisters and I believe they need me as well. So, I want to live, Lord Jesus, in such a way, Lord, that I can be a blessing to them and they be a blessing to me. Father, continue to use our brother. But I pray that you continue to use my brothers and sisters, Lord. Whether it be an encouraging word or a prayer or or a poem or or a song, Lord Jesus, or the musicians playing, we're all a part of the body and we need one another. This service would not be this service without your presence, but it wouldn't be you a service like it is without our brothers and sisters that believe. So, pro Father, I pray your blessings upon the children of Almighty God be with us as we leave this place. Lord, bring us all back at the appointed time. keep us all safe and out of harm's way. But Lord, this word that has gone forth, Lord, may it get down to the depths of our soul and cause us to have a spring cleaning, cleaning our hearts, cleaning our lives from everything that's not pleasing to you. Father, we pray that you will restore the strength, Lord, to our pastor. Lord God, strengthen him, bless him, bless all that he puts his hands to, not only he, but this entire congregation. We commit all things to you, Father, in the precious and lovely name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brothers. Brothers and sisters, you may have your seats. And our brothers will come and dismiss you at this time. [Music] [Music] Rest in pray. Keep my life clean every day. I want to go with him when he comes back. Come too far and I'm never turning back.
