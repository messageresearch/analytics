given but we do give giving statements from our church uh you know to anyone that does give and if you desire just to have that statement because it is something that you can claim on your tax return

here over the giving and then also over the word as it's coming forth uh but let's prepare our hearts to receive uh our precious brother uh Andrew Glover amen I know the Lord has a word for us uh tonight amen let's pray father we thank you for the opportunity we have to be able to give and we ask that to it use our giving for the furtherance of your kingdom God as uh the uh the little boy brought his uh fish and his loaf of bread and god dude you took what little he had you blessed it uh you break it and then it began to multiply so father uh we're we're blessing father through this this giving and as it just goes into the various areas of ministry father uh may it begin to multiply and father that it would just bring forth fruit for your kingdom uh we asked Lord that you were just also just anoint your servant afresh as he comes Lord to bring the word of God to our hearts and uh Lord may you use them in a special way the Lord is our prayer in Jesus name we ask it amen amen let's enter our feet amen Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me amen as we just welcome brother Andrew Glover uh to the pulpit uh May seeing Grace how sweet the sound that saved arrest like me I want lost oh but now I'm found oh I was blind but now I see sing it again with all your heart uh ah great what was lost but now I'm found oh yes blind but now I see amen how many is that your testimony here this evening amen that you have been saved by the amazing grace of God amen I tell you I believe there's an atmosphere in this building tonight that all things are possible amen I that was just the other day studying a little bit there on the book of Acts in the upper room and we have no record of there being any instruments up there keyboard or drums or guitar but there was an atmosphere amen I believe that's all that the Church of the Living God needs is an atmosphere where Jesus Christ can come in and manifest his presence hey man how many has come here tonight to receive from him amen we've not come to see a man or to hear from a man but Amen to see Jesus Christ glorified amen we want to greet you all this evening in the name of the Lord Jesus we sure counted an honor and privilege to be here with you all once again and I it's been a few days since we've had the privilege to be here and speak to you but we sure do appreciate brother Jack and the invitation the opportunity to come once again and I was trying to calculate my mind today I think it might have been acquired the fire maybe the last time we was here I was driving down the road and saw the old building there and I was trying to think back I think it was maybe 2014 so it's been a few days but it is a real honor to be here with you all again and I was just tearing sharing every brother Troy was walking around he said we are here and then brother Jack was kind of sharing with me a little bit about your building situation and we were just this week or last weekend rather out in Kansas some of you may know Brother Sam Parker he started an assembly there in Bentley Kansas and they started in a community center renting it and they'd want to have a meeting and they had to get permission to have the meat and then they'd go back and all kinds of things and about about six months ago there was an old church there in Bentley had a fellowship hall a parsonage in a building and the people come to him and said look we want to make sure that this building remains a church so would you all be interested in it he said well he said how much are you asking they said well we really hate to ask this but we're just asking a thousand dollars and if that's too much we'll come down just a little bit uh just to make sure you all can keep this building as a church and so I actually preached in a building last week that they got for a thousand dollars and they put a new roof on it before they turned it over to him so amen I believe if God did that in Kansas amen I believe God can do it right here in West Palm Beach amen he remains to be God right he's still Jehovah Jireh amen he he'll meet the need of his children amen I I was actually preaching out there and I told him I said if you back this message God will back you amen and you all been faithful in this community for many years to this message and God will give you the desires of your heart amen we want tonight if you have your Bibles to go to the Book of John and the fifth chapter amen we we believe amen the Lord is here among us tonight amen we want to say God bless you to all the ministers here tonight brother Smiley God bless you sure good to see you again our brother and I sure appreciate brother Smiley and appreciate his ministry and amen we sure appreciate the men of God that are preaching this message and we're glad to have my wife here with me and our little boy Malachi back there uh in case you didn't know you've probably heard him by now so he is here amen but we we sure appreciate them for making the trip with us this weekend and do want to greet you on behalf of our pastor brother Sean Martin the Saints there Faith Tabernacle send their greetings to you this evening and we're just uh really joyed to be here this weekend and fellowship and just before you read the word let's just buy our hearts together and let's invite him to come and open his word Heavenly Father Lord as we step in this building tonight we are very well aware that this is more than just a school room this is more than just a place that has been designated for your children together this evening in Fellowship around your word but Lord this is your provided place that you've given us tonight Lord father to step into the light of your presence and father as we come here tonight we are a needy people Lord we have many needs here I am a firm believer tonight Lord if I was to pass this microphone through the entire congregation Lord and every person would give a need they have and we would calculate those needs and write them down father when the last person had spoken when the last need had been made known I would still be able to say there's not a need in this room but what God can meet and tonight father we invite you in this building may you take control of my thoughts take control of my heart take control of the Direction Lord father may you minister to the needs of your children now Lord I pray a special blessing up on this assembly father Lord as you've done it before I know you can do it again may you give him the desire of their heart may you Lord give them a building father that they can worship you in and Lord I pray that you would just Lord make ways out of no ways father Lord you're still a Creator we stand in a special place tonight not by accident not by chance but father by your provision now Lord may you drive every Spirit out of this building that's unlike the Holy Spirit and Lord May Liberty fall in this field and may may the spirit of Revelation and power of creation may it move throughout this room dear God and may healing take place Deliverance is Father fill with the Holy Ghost Lord forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings and Lord whatever is accomplished during these meetings this weekend we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we do pray and all the Believers says a man and amen The Book of John the fifth chapter the 21st verse Jesus here speaking he says for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father now he that honereth not the son on Earth not the Father which hath sent him verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word but remember said understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but is passed from Death unto life I love the way brother Brandman says that one time he says rub that out if you can amen there's no possible way to rub that out it's a promise to the believer for verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and he that given authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man now he he is the son of man how many believes he is the Son of Man Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now if we could turn to the Book of Revelation the 10th chapter a few readings here tonight Revelation 10 a very very familiar scripture to the Believers in this hour in Revelation 10 and I want to look in the seventh verse I I know we could all probably read this verse by heart but in Revelation 10 and verse 7. the Bible here says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants Amen in the days of the voice so we're speaking of that voice again of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery or the culmination of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now I want to read one verse with you again in Luke 17. back to Luke 17 you all forgive me I got a bit of reputation there at home of having a lot of opening scriptures but I love studying the word underneath a Vindicated Prophet Amen in Luke 17 in verse 30 another scripture we could read by heart but Jesus here says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed remember said Lord Jesus Christ is made manifest in his people when the son of man is revealed we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight to speak to you from these different passages of scripture and if I speak to you tonight on the title I want to title this obey the voice of the son of man obey the voice of the son of man I was just listened the other day to a tape and brother remember says like this and Faith he comes down to the end of the tape and he says now 1956 I'm going to ask you all to be reverent just as reverent as you can you say brother Branham what are you talking about you're stalling I am exactly see I'm waiting for that angel of the Lord to come that's exactly right I don't know none of you and how could not do anything he says I can't it's him he said I can't do it even when he comes unless your faith operates it it's not me I can't see Visions unless it's your faith that does it sure he said God's Will by Divine gift the only thing I do is just keep yielding myself and as I get myself completely yielded to the Holy Spirit then he starts talking see it's no me he is using my voice amen amen it's not me he is using my voice see it's not me it's him that's exactly what the scripture says so what a prophet of God was doing was taking the emphasis off of himself and he was placing it on someone else now he was not placing the Head Upon a bishop or upon a cardinal upon a pulp or Upon A group of men but he was placing the authority back on the one amen that was giving him the authority to operate in the office he was operating them he would say see it's not me it's him he is just using my voice now in John the fifth chapter we read about the voice right Revelation 10 we read about the voice but remember says 1958 he said if you can hear a voice that's speaking to you that's God see because it copes with the scripture if it doesn't then there's some kind of a wrong voice speaking to you amen that's right he said but the right voice will tell you he meant to follow the rules of the Bible so there there is a right voice and there is a wrong voice and the prophet is saying if it's a voice that's coming from the word it's going to tell you to follow the rules of the Bible he said there'll be no sprinkling there'll be no poor and there'll be no falsely he said but come right straight and follow the rules of the Bible now that was not me saying that but that was the seventh angel amen declaring to the church if you're going to receive the blessing you've got to come God's provided way and it's to follow the scriptures of the Bible I I like to say it like this amen seventh thing so amen was not the mighty angel of Revelation 10 1 amen but he was a spokesman amen for the angel of Christ The Covenant Angel then when you begin to realize that there is a spokesman that has come do you realize that a spokesman a true spokesman amen does not send himself he he does not go to school and learn how to say things he does not amen get sent out by a group of men amen but God sends a spokesman the Bible says in Hebrews 12 25 amen see that you refuse not him amen that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth then how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him amen that speaketh from heaven so here is somebody on the earth that is speaking amen but they're not speaking by the inspiration of the earth amen they are speaking by their inspiration of Heaven I love that word speaketh it means to articulate sounds amen it means to declare one's mind amen by speech or by sound amen so before word comes out of the mouth it has been a thought somewhere before a word comes out of the mouth it has been a thought somewhere amen and the only thing that word is doing is declaring amen what was in the mind now let me set you like this we had a Prophet come in this generation and said I'm going to go all the way back to the back part of God's mind amen and reveal to you the Hidden Mysteries and the secrets amen of what God was thinking in the back part of his mind I don't think it's a coincidence amen that we've got 1200 tapes Amen in books that have been recorded amen and it was not recorded the wind in the trees it was not recorded amen the Rocks hopping across the ground amen but there is a voice on those tapes there is a sound almost amen there is a speech on those tapes and that sound amen is not coming from a denomination it is not coming from a system and it's not coming amen from a personality but that voice amen is sounding from the heavens of Heaven amen it is sounding from the throne room of God and there is a sound that has come in this Center Nation it's not the sound of a Kentucky hillbilly it's not the sound of a Preacher amen it's the sound of redemption it's the sound of Freedom it's the sound of Deliverance it's the sound of Correction it's the sound of righteousness it's the sound of Victory I'm on Church we're not here together tonight amen hearing a bunch of sounds without a distinction amen between what is piped and what is harmed amen but we've got a stone amen and it's a trying Stone and it'll try the voice amen and I propose to you tonight any voice that says anything contrary to what this word teaches it's not a right voice it is a wrong voice and we ought to squash it we ought to squash its influence we shouldn't listen to it another second of Our Lives we are not following a wrong voice We are following a right voice amen it's a voice of authority it's a voice of power now amen that word speaketh means to declare my mind declare one's Mind by speech or by sound you all know amen that according to the Bible there are two types of sounds there is a certain sound and then there is an uncertain sound and Paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who shall prepare himself for the battle right amen if the trumpet now he's just identified amen where the sound is coming from it is coming from a trumpet if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for the battle you go to Revelation 1 10 John says amen I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice amen as of a trumpet he has just connected The Voice Amen to the trumpet and a prophet comes along and says trumpet is an announcement see amen Gabriel at the coming of the Lord amen shall sound the Trump of God he said this was God's trumpet blowing in other words he's fixing to announce Amen to Eternal destination of the world Listen friends we are not here tonight they've been preparing for an eighth Church age we are not here tonight God Amen preparing to receive an eighth day messenger amen but the next step for the Church of the Living God Amen is back into eternity where she come from listen you may be playing church but I want to tell you amen play time's over amen the Bell has sounded recessed his sin is it's time to get down to business with God this ain't time to be playing church this ain't time to be just well who's who and who's not and well glory to God can we preach amen who likes who who don't like who that's not what we're here for tonight we got a Rapture to take we got a body change to go into we got a future home to go to we got a marriage supper of the lamb and this trumpet sound in this voice amen is dealing with eternal destination of the world he said a trumpet what is it get ready I'm going to give you the revelation of Jesus Christ when John heard that trumpet he said get ready I'm going to give you the revelation of Jesus Christ now brother Jack why was he giving him that revelation Nation he said to give to the church I will speak to you and what will be the destination of the world Amen is for those who receive and those who reject amen can you say it with me receive or reject amen see you'll either receive what is coming from that voice you will receive what is coming from that trumpet and you will receive it and go to your Eternal destination amen or you will reject it and you'll still go to a destination amen say it's not up to you Amen to determine whether the trumpet is Vindicated or not it's already been Vindicated it's not up to you to determine whether we should preach what a prophet said it's already been Vindicated that we should say what a prophet is saying amen then it's up to us tonight amen to receive the words of lies or to reject the words of Lies but listen friends I believe I'm preaching to a group amen that is not among the thorns and they're not among the rocks amen but they're among the good ground that when the word which is a c eat amen begins to go forth they can receive that word and as they receive that word it's more than a sermon it's more than a special meaning it's more than a shout hallelujah time it is them becoming the word amen listen friends God is Not rapturing books he's not rapturing pictures but he's going to Rapture the word and it's become flesh in the generation you're living I say it's high time Amen to become one with his word until the very pulsation in your heart is pulsating Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday today and forever listen this message ought to get your attention this message ought to change the way we do things and all that change the way we conduct ourselves come on it's a message of change amen and if you receive it it'll be a blessing if you reject it it'll be a curse amen what's it going to do it's going to be a sound but it's not going to be any kind of sound amen it's going to be unarticulate sound so in other words when you hear a prophet there's no longer going to be a question on whether it's right or whether it's wrong can I preach them in it and that there's no longer going to be a question on whether it's right or whether it's wrong do you know why we got questions it's because men has gone beyond what a prophet taught and they Blaze the trails to find new revelation and they cannot back it up in the Bible Well I might as well preach them here and they can't back it up in the Bible they can't back it up in the message amen but because there's some personality attached to that Doctrine people think they all receive it but I propose to you that as the Church of the Living God you are not subject to anything except when a prophet is told you're not subject to how a preacher feels you're not subject to how a church feels you are subject to the word and if you receive the word that word will change you if you receive that word that word will lift you up out of it bold rooms of Life it'll lift you up out of the Town Hallelujah it'll lift you up out of the ash Heats it'll lift you up out of the gutters it'll set you in a place of authority how will you get there you will get there by the word amen I think it's amazing in the Malachi 4 amen God promised to do what he promised to send a prophet to this generation let me say it to you like this a true prophet of God is Not man-made he's not man called he's God sent and God has kept his voice alive amen from Eden remember said from Eden and since Eden amen through the prophets now listen there's always been a battle he meant to silence the voice of God and remember when Abel was killed by Cain right his purpose was Amen to silence the voice of God and to kill the seed of Resurrection that was coming through the lineage amen but watch a prophet say it like this when Cain killed Abel God raised up Seth amen now watch this and when Seth went off the scene amen God raised up another one then I can tell you tonight by Authority amen that the same voice that was speaking in the book of in the Book of Genesis in the Garden of Eden is the same voice that is speaking in this building tonight it's not the voice of Andrew cover it's not the voice of Jack Dove it's not the voice of Willie Smiley it is the voice amen of Jesus Christ the son of God Amen I tell you like this it's very important Amen to believe that God sent him amen that speaketh in the generation that you're living listen it's not enough just to believe God sent him amen but you've got to receive him you've got to receive him who God has sent is that all right you got to receive him who God has sent amen I'll tell you like this the works of God Amen is more than dancing the aisles and then the works of God is more than shouting or two Hills off amen The Works of God is more than speaking in tongues amen but in this generation a prophet identified with the works of God is he said it's believeth on him who God has said listen friends we got people shouting the eyes and can't even shake hands with one another we got people dancing shines and they can't even love one another amen we got people shouting and speaking in tongues and arguing with what a prophet told but in the last days they would be a people who would rise up and they would not be a rebellious people they would be an obedient people and they would believe him who God sent they would receive him who God sent they just wouldn't believe it brother Troy and they wouldn't just receive it but they would obey him who God is sin and that obedience would unlock the supernatural power of almighty God we got to believe him who God sent well the song we got to receive him who God said but we've got to obey him oh we got to obey him you say God sent yeah in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people amen but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God but they organized and again the pure word was lost amen because organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple words they could no longer speak for God but then God sent Wesley are you catching it here God sent Luther God sent Wesley he was the voice with the word in his name and the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles red and known of all men amen for their generation and when the methodists failed God raised up others and so has gone on to the years until in this last day there is again another people well I feel like I'm preaching that people there is another people in the land amen notice who's not above their messenger they're not beside their messenger but they're under their messenger and they will be the time of voice Amen to the final age among Church we're not above the seventh angel we're underneath the seventh angel we're not beside the seventh angel we're underneath that seventh angel and by being underneath him he's messaged not the man the message has become the headship or the leadership to the church what are you saying I'm saying the final voice to the final age amen is going to call a final people let me say you are the final voice to the final age you're the final people well Hallelujah you are the final people that are the written Epistles that are read of all men remember said you got to get that Living Word in you you have to have the Living God in you because the word in here is when God it's made flesh in you he said made Spirit life in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are a living example that's a mouthful when that word goes into your flesh amen and your faith and becomes a life he said then you are a living example you are an Epistle of God rid of all men he said you won't have it like Christ not the fullness amen because it was divided up on the day of Pentecost and then let me let me lay this in here again it is important to receive amen and believe he that speaketh but it's also important to obey him that God has sent and him that you have received now I'm not going to focus so much tonight amen upon he who God is saying that is identified there is no question beyond the side of it now amen that the prophet of Malachi 4 is the angel of Revelation 10 7. amen is the angel of Revelation 18. are you hearing me there's no question that is settled amen now let me go a step further and say Amen there's no question here amen whether you receive that that's the truth or not amen you all sitting right here nodding your heads amen I believe it amen but the question he is amen have you obeyed amen he who God sent in the generation that you're living in because the Bible says in Exodus 23 amen verse 20 behold I send an angel before they notice his angels before thee Amen to keep me in the way and to bring me to the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not amen for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him amen obey his voice amen if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angel shall go before thee and shall bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaan and the highlights and the champion science notice this and I will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their gods Lord serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quiet break down their images and ye shall serve the Lord your God he shall bless thy bread and thy water amen and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee amen but what phrase does he keep saying obey his voice if you will obey his voice amen that he will bless your bread if you will obey his voice he will bless your water if he if you will obey his voice he will remove sickness out of the midst of thee I'll just say it to you like this brother Smiley I believe that obedience is very important I don't believe it's optional I don't believe it's it's a possibility amen my Bible says behold to obey amen is better to than to sacrifice amen and to hearken than the fat of rams said obedience is the best he says one place like this obedience unlocks the supernatural now if you look in Genesis 22 and verse 15 the angel of the Lord amen calling to Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done the thing and it's not withheld thy son thine only son amen that in blessing I will blessing and in multiplying I will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sandwiches upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall the nations of the earth be blessed because he hath obeyed my voice among church amen the blessing upon the Seed of Abraham amen that would be manifested in Samson would be manifested in samgara goes all the way back to Abraham amen as a father being obedient to the voice of God come on now amen you say we were there it's hard to obey imagine being Abraham imagine being Abraham and God tells you take your boy up on the mountain lay him up on the altar amen cut his neck amen lay him out there as a blood sacker come on now and imagine being Isaac walking with Abraham Amen brother jack up the mountain this wasn't the first time that boy went to church he had been to sacrifice many times he had been to worship many times he could look and see the wood he could look and see the stone he could look and see the night amen but down in his heart was a question daddy amen there's the wood there's a knife there's a Rock Amen but where is the sacrifice amen but because Abraham amen was an obedient servant of the almighty God he said Isaac you just don't worry about it our God will provide himself amen of sacrifice and you know what Abraham's obedience done amen Abraham went up on the mountain he showed up to church on Sunday morning he told her I'm preaching to you now he didn't stay home amen he didn't call 50 other people that's all wadded up in their spare it and Argan question he went and did what God called him to do and right there in the Coos moment right there in the crucial hour amen Abraham's obedience unlocked they've been the providing element of Jehovah and out of nowhere a ram appeared and the prophet said it was not a vision he said it was a real Ram he said Abraham cut it and the ram bled and he carried Isaac back home what are you saying I'm saying I'm going to preach her for a second if you'll stay in line if you'll stay in position if you'll obey the voice of the Angel amen God will come down on a Friday night when Praises are going up he'll come down on a Friday night and unlock Supernatural blessings in the middle of West Palm Beach upon a supernatural people who are not just a bunch of church members but they are obedient Sons and Daughters of God oh what a promise amen because of obedience you realize the prophet of God said then prophets went out and preached the word he said they didn't want to go do it he said if they went anyhow he said not to be different but to be obedient he said it was a hard trial it was a hard burden but they were not doing it to be different they were doing it to be obedient he said see he would go out there and he would say the only thing I can say is what God has put in my mouth God had so much complete control of them amen until he was their voice amen he was their action amen I said like this the prophet said the signs of God are always overlooked amen one of God's signs amen is the coming of a prophet one of God's signs that's always overlooked is the coming of a prophet he said see those who are elected to see it does see it amen but the coming of a prophet was the sign that God was ready to speak listen when you've seen a prophet I know today we gotta we got a bunch of I think a brother call him the name bunch of prophet Liars he said they go around Prophet line you know oh write me a check for thirty thousand amen and God will give you 130 000. amen or go outside and touch your mouth box and drink this a bunch of ProFlowers amen I tell you this I tell you how much time should change in the Bible when the prophet showed up at your house it wasn't a shout and Hallelujah time it wasn't to kick his shoes off and Shout the house down amen God was coming to that house he meant to do business through his prophet and I think it's time the church the Living God Amen remember that God has sent us a prophet in this generation and he didn't just come to tickle our ears he didn't just come to give us a better understanding he'd been in the church down the road but he come to unlock the supernatural element that was hidden in the church underneath the five senses underneath the five hour and inner census there was a sixth sense laying there and it was the sense of faith and God sent a Prophet by his word to wake up that sense and to remind you that no matter how dark it is you can still praise God no matter how bad it is you can still praise God God is ready to speak because if God ain't going to speak then the prophet would not be on the earth amen remember unless the God was ready to speak then the prophet would not be on the earth now you all know that brother man preaches several messages called amen the voice of the sign right amen the voice of the sign he said see he wants an audience amen so the sign is given Amen to gather an audience to get their attention Amen to hear the voice see he wants somebody that's going to listen to what he's going to say the sign is an alert to attract the attention of the people amen that the word is getting ready to speak my when you see the sign it's only an alert it's a it's an announcement amen that the voice of the word is getting ready to speak now I said to you like this amen the other day I was somewhere I can't remember where I was brother Jack but somebody had a car out back and they still had a sign on the back of the car said believe the sign now amen I'm not here to preach and getting all that but I'm going to preach here for a second amen because amen that that rent right through here went right through the country amen believed the sign and I brother I was praying one day I was honestly praying I said Lord amen how can these people see what they've seen hear what they've heard been a part of churches they've been a part of and then turn around and go from believing the sign to rejecting the sign and I was praying one day listening to brother random and he stopped and he said it like this he said see see the sign but believe the voice I said oh there we go amen he never emphasized On Believing the sign he emphasized on seeing the sign amen but believing the voice of the sign amen was Forerunner I tell you why you're still here tonight it's not because you saw the sign it's not just because you saw the first and second pull but there was a seed on the inside of you there was a soul in there it wasn't a first pull Soul it wasn't a second pole Soul it was a third pool soul and that Soul was looking for the word and when you Saw the Sign amen behind the sign come the voice and the voice said come out of her my people and be separate saith the Lord come on we're not shouting because we saw the sign we're not dancing because we saw the sign we're shiling because we've heard the voice [Music] we heard the voice it was the Eagle's scream it was a sign Amen to get our attention to hear the pure unadulterated word of God oh they saw the sign but they never believed the voice but there's a bride here in the last days like this he said many will see the sign but only the elected will hear the voice many will see the sign but only elected will hear the voice you say that what is the voice according to the Prophet The Voice is the word so we were not looking for the fishes and Loaves we were not looking for the Miracles we were looking for the word now if you go back to Abraham I can't get away from you for a second the Bible says Abraham heard the voice it said come out from amongst your people Abraham he said the thing of it is amen see but you'll have the same fix come on out and celebrate yourself what is it leave all your conscience and senses behind you like that open up your mind and remember it's me come live with me do you see that's what the message was doing it was an invitation it was calling you out of the household the denomination and was calling you into the household of faith I'm on Church we're not living with TD Jakes we're not living with Oral Roberts we're not living with some man we're living in the tent with the son of man and he's called us out of confusion he's called us out of tradition he said God is calling every Seed of Abraham this morning to that same kind of life amen the battle is on worldwide God wants his children separating themselves from what from seed to face feel smell here imagination conscience memory reason affection everything he said open up their mind and let the word come in and then march with the word that's Divine instruction you've got to open up your mind let the word come in and then you start marching with the word he said that's a real Soldier amen that's a real Soldier how many knows amen one of the first principles Amen to being a soldier is she going to be able to obey in order to be a soldier you've got to be able to obey you've got to be able to take somebody telling you when to get up when to go to bed what you're going to eat what you come on now y'all y'all know brother Daryl were down here they're award told me one time he said when I was in the military he said we had a boy come in there you know he said he was one of them pretty boys he said he'd come in there and the the the whatever Captain there he said sit down it's time for a haircut you know he said well he come in there thinking things are going to be the way he thought they was going to be so we sit down in the chair he said yeah he said if you don't mind take a little bit off here and kind of trim this end up here and straighten in the back he said then on the top just kind of take just a little bit off brother else said yeah that guy that's kind of nodded he said flip the guard off turn the razor on and shaved his head off amen amen say when you become a soldier you've lost your rights to say the way you think things ought to be in other words if you're going to be a successful Soldier you've got to be able to say I'm wrong and the general is Right you've got to be able to say my opinion is not valid but his word is the truth I'm on church I'll tell you why we're in the heat of the battle and there's been some drop off to the left in the right it's because they couldn't say I'm wrong and William Branham is Right amen but there was an elected seed on the earth that was ordained to hear the voice and In the Heat of the battle she married this new anointed word and refused to turn from it but she marched Through The Valleys she marched across the mountains and she's still marching with the word because she's not here for the sign she's here for the word the principle of obedience and then I cannot preach to you for a second amen the principle of obedience was actually established when Jesus amen performed the first miracle you realize that the first miracle he's had a wedding and they run out of wine so what do they do and then they go over to Jesus and say listen oh we got's water Jesus said that's all right bring me the water pitcher full of water now they looked at him like he was crazy brother Smiley they said come on man amen we run out of wine we got plenty of water he said no just bring me the water and it and and Mary spoke up and saith in the servant whatsoever he saith unto you do it I can preach Sarah all night can I whatever he's safe unto you do it brother said that's still good teaching tonight whatever he saith unto you just do it if he tells you to make ready for death you get ready if he tells you you're going to get well you believe it if he tells you that you are healed you are whatever he says you do it this believe it is a sin whatever he says do you do it to disbelieve it is a sin now how many agrees that God sends his instructions to an age Amen to the angel messenger of that age now you agree with that right Paul says in First Corinthians 15 1 more over Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received wherein you stand by which also you're saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain I'm sitting now watch he said watch this verse for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died according for our sins according to the scriptures how many knows he was born according to the scripture he lived according to scripture amen he died according to scripture he was buried according to the scripture he arose brother Solomon on the third day amen according to the scripture see then what it was it was a voice amen that was a scriptural voice that was causing a life to cope with the word amen look at this word delivered it means to give into the hands of another it means to give over into one's power or use I love this one it means to deliver to one something to keep it means to deliver verbally so in other words what Paul was speaking amen had been delivered to him it was not an impression it was not a feeling amen it was a verbal voice that Paul heard amen that he come to the church and delivered it to the church now I can't help but preach here can I amen First Tape we got on record the prophet says we're getting some new gadgets for recording Malachi 4 said we're getting some new gadgets for recording I'll just go this far to say Amen that the reason we got recording devices was to record The Voice amen of the seventh angel in the last days now we might as well preach and we Amen in the last days you were not under a Catholic spirit we're not under a Catholicism spirit I listen I know you ministers here some of you Brothers here been around a lot longer than I have and you fought those battles but brother Brandon said this and brother Brian said that and brother bam said this amen and then you go searching never said nothing like that amen but they say well amen you know what amen it's there and there well can I preach a second I was preached one time and I heard a quote I read the quote and I went I quoted the brother come to me said that's not how it was I said no that's how brother said it was he said no that's not what he meant I said well I'm just going to say what he said he said no he said you didn't hear what he said I said I did hear what he said he said no you didn't hear what he said I said listen there's nothing wrong with my hearing I hear fine are you hearing me I'm no longer debating whether it's writer I heard it for myself I'm on church amen we might as well squash that Catholic devil it's crept its way right in this message where there's only certain men that can tell you a certain Revelation that is a Catholicism devil from the pits of hell you know why they bring the hell God have mercy you know why that devil Creeps in amen because if the Catholic gotta hold the Bible they would see that guy they've been kissing his ring and sending him money every day it's the viker of God he's the son of perdition amen but because they're blinded a blind person is easier to deal with amen but my Bible says in the end time that God would send an i7 to the church we would not be a bunch of blind leading the blind but we would have shot listen we can see for ourselves we can see Malachi 4 we can see the Holy Ghost we can see predestination we don't have to back up and say well brother can you tell me if it's okay to believe it we've heard it delivered verbally by the word oh come on Friends hey man I tell you how strong it is brother I'm coming 1965 and says his Moses gathered them up on the mountain and said this day I received the Commandments he said so say unto you don't you add to or take away from these Commandments and brother Branham stood right there himself and said so say unto you don't you add to or take away from these tapes you say what is on them tapes Brothers said the only thing I can do is deliver the message just like he told me he said now Prince Albert Alberta Saskatchewan Faith 1956 Jesus died God's covenant and raised again that same Spirit was on him it's in the church and promised by God that would be to the end of the world it's up to you to receive it what are you saying I'm saying God's Duty bound ascended it's up to you to receive it whether you want it or not God takes his place he said God pokes his religion down nobody's throat amen the preacher might do it but God does it God does not poke his religion down anybody's throat he said he sent his word and it's up to you to receive it now Paul said I delivered I verbally I verbally turned over into your use what I received from Heaven amen first of all which I also receive look at this word received I love this definition brother Jack it means not to withhold obedience so if you actually receive something then you release your obedience to it oh my the Bible said he that happened here let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches it may be that Millions will hear the words or even read them but how many will paid heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you now that is the work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it amen then you won't get the Revelation you've got to open your mind you're going to open your spirit you've got to receive what's being teached but listen to really receive it you've got to release your obedience to it and your obedience will make you one with the word that you're here listen I think it's time that the colonel mind ought to be out of the church I think it's time for the spiritual mind of the spiritually elected by predestination to have the preeminence in the church like this he said I pray there's no carnal Minds Among Us that there is a spiritual mind Among Us that we can understand what the father is trying to get to us here another place it's all spiritual revealed truth laying right there but it takes the spiritual mind to catch it watch this amen seems Birmingham says that the spiritual mind is becoming numb the spiritual mind he says is becoming numb now you know that only the spiritual mind amen can actually catch the word teachings of the message of the hour like you you all know this right amen three seeds have been sown right there's been a denominational seat sown by Billy Graham there's been a Pentecostal scene rather amen sold by Oral Roberts but according to a prophet oh according to a prophet he said like this he said the seventh angel will sow the entire Bible word seed in the church now listen to you that's a to you that's a settled fact to you you hear it and say Amen but walk in down here at Publix and get the microphone and say there's been three seeds sold amen people look at you like you're crazy they'll say what size jacket do you wear because you're fixing to go to the mental hospital you know why amen because there's a carnal mind there that has received carnal things I'm on church amen 44 a million more and 44 carnality amen popcorn night and movie night and start well glory to God we might as well pray come on Amen the pulpits have been evangelized by Hollywood we don't used to be 20 years ago we at least had some preachers out in the nomination that still look like men and Priests like men but now we got a bunch of perverted sissies skinny Gene wearing preachers sitting by this drinking coffee eating a donut trying to preach the power of God among church we are not here as a hybridized church we are the original word seed of almighty God that has been sown in this generation we didn't come here to bring forth a bunch of hotbed plants we didn't come here to bring forth a bunch of hot bed babies that's got to be petted and pampered we got some rugged Warriors we got some ragged Christians is there any here tonight it'll say all march with a word in spite of every trial in spite of every situation in spite of every dark day I'm a soldier I'm gonna march with a word you know why you can march with a word because you had a spiritual mind Amen to catch the revelation of the word that was coming in the age that you're living in listen it's no doubt the carnal mind amen can catch the scientific advancement to the day right no let me preach here the carnal mind can catch this listen we got kids they can't carry the trash out but they can build computers oh come on now hell glory to God amen amen 25 years old still laying on Mama's couch won't go get their license but they can build websites the carnal mind is catching but come on Church they're catching the scientific advancements of the day and listen it's not changing them for the better it's changing them for the worse they're a wiser generation but they're weaker generation oh God heard somebody say the neighborhood Jack they said pray to God we don't go to war today we'll have a bunch of soldiers got to stop by Starbucks on their way to get on the ship well it's the truth amen we're living in a wise for about a weaker generation come on Friends amen but there's a bride on the earth amen she may be in this scientific day she may be in this scientific world Amen but she's a regular believer I tell you why when y'all was in here singing a minute ago that's the Shekinah glory amen was circling through this building is because you're some rugged Christians brother Solomon you've had every reason not to be here you've had every reason to quit amen things have come upon you that destroyed other people but here you are on a Friday night in the house of God you know why because there was a spiritual mind they've been to catch the word seen that was being sold in the age you was living and that word seed is produced a rugged Christian oh yeah it's a spiritual mind and it's catching what God is doing in the AIDS they're living in what are you saying I'm saying amen before God sends a word he has somebody on the earth prepared to receive that word and Obey that word look at the woman at the whale Bill am I going too long the woman at the whale she goes there to get water and Jesus says brother Smiley I must have needs to go through some area brother member said Jesus Christ did not die Amen to produce a sob story hoping somebody would come along and read it feel sorry for him and Believe on him unto salvation he said but he died with a person in mind he died with names in mind and what were those names those were the names of redemption that was in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world come on church amen when Jesus went by the woman at the well he wasn't hoping she would be there amen before he ever got on the ship before he ever crossed the sea before he ever left the disciples and took that little walk down the spirit into Tabernacle on a Friday night he knew she would be sitting there he knew what she would be wearing come on Church remember I'm sitting proving his word he said what did God do he prepared you to receive him in this age from before the foundation of the world listen she thought it was another day at the whale she just thought it was another Friday night service amen a spirit true Tabernacle but little did she know it was the breaking of a new day it was the dawn of a new chapter in her life the old was going to be washed away and all things were going to become new oh I pray God break out in the church again until we receive the word and we obey that word and we walk with that word and we march with that word regardless of the conditions now the prophet said like this I love the words he uses he said she stood there looking for the manifestation of the word notice the words he used she said we know Messiah cometh and it's going to do what he does and notice what Jesus said I am he that speaks to you I am he that is declaring what's in God's mind about you Hallelujah I am he that is articulating sounds to you I know you've heard Rabbi sounds you've heard the teacher sounds but I am he that's going to speak to you I'm going to declare to you what was in the back part of God's mind and before come on Church before she received the word what did she see she saw the sign she saw the sign of the son of man reveal the secrets of her heart and she said that ain't nothing but the truth but she didn't stop at the sign come on church she didn't stop at the sign amen she said messiah's coming he said I'm he that speaks to you brother what did she do she dropped roll denominational water bucket she dumped she dropped throw bucket and the Bible said she ran out in the city and said come see a man come on church amen five minutes before she met the Messiah she was a prostitute who had five husbands and was living with a sixth husband you don't think this message will bring you from to nobody ain't meant to be in a somebody get underneath the influence of the message of the hour it'll change the way people see you it'll change the way people think about you can I preach are you hearing me five minutes before sister Erica she was an ill-fame woman who the Bible says if she went in the community and there was kids playing in the street and she said little little Johnny get out of the road you might get run over but I said the fathers had told their children because of her condition don't you listen to her you laugh in her face and keep on going but my Bible said after she met the anointed word for her age that she dropped her water bucket and she ran into the City and she sold the men come see a man and the Bible says Men followed her testimony to meet the Messiah what made the difference I'll tell you what made the difference she got under the influence of the anointed word of her age you want a difference in your life get out front of the influence of sports get out some of the influence of society get under the influence of what a prophet said it'll change you forever Hallelujah I'm talking about the message of the hour it's a voice and somebody's going to obey it somebody's going to believe it somebody's going to manifest it oh God hallelujah somebody's gonna obey it how are you just gonna you just gotta realize the only thing the messenger can do is deliver the message it's up to you to obey the messenger now you say obey the messenger obey the parts I want obey the parts that I think are okay according to the Bible I can give you two examples okay I'm not gonna read them to I'm gonna preach them to you okay the book of Exodus the Bible says amen God told Moses amen you kill a lamb and put the blood over the door now that's how it's preached you know why because not many people amen go through the details but if you read Exodus 12 brother Jack there was a lot of instructions there there was a lot of instructions there well I'm just gonna I'm gonna take a minute reading to you they didn't just go dip the blood slinging over the door and going about for business your lamb will be without blemish he will be a male of the first year you'll take him out from the sheep or from the goats you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening they shall take the blood strike it on the two side post and on the upper door of the houses or when they shall eat and they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs shall they eat it eat none of it raw nor saw no with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof these are instructions you shall let nothing of it remain into the morning that which remaineth of it until the morning shall be burnt and thus say eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it's the Lord's Passover in other words he said don't eat and get ready he said get ready as you eat it come on Church they didn't have time to eat it and then get ready as soon as the final 80 year old man took the final bite of the final part of the Lamb they were leaving the land of Egypt well come on Church we're not living in the age or we got a lot of more time to play listen if you're waiting to get ready you'll get left behind you better get ready and be waiting you know what I'm talking about amen tell your kids amen tell your kids tomorrow morning we're leaving here at 10 o'clock amen you know what they'll do sleep till 9 58 jump up amen try to get ready and see the tail lights going down the road and you know what she'll say I told you to be ready at 10 o'clock listen so what you do is you get up and you get ready amen and when you're ready to go it's time to go you ain't got to get ready you're ready to go but I want to tell that devil tonight they are some Believers in the last days who have manifested Matthew 25 and they are ready for the coming of the bridegroom we're not eating this lamb they've been laying around on the couch missing turkey please but we're underneath a burden and it's a burden of truth it's a burden of obedience and we're ready to go at any second what are you saying I'm saying amen hurry in the evidence of obedience was not quoting what Moses said it was applying the blood as Moses said see then what did obedience do it brought the Covenant into effect if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe so how do you obey the messenger then you obey the messenger by taking the message into your heart and allowing it to have access into your life now the prophet God said watch he said see in Genesis 6 he said Noah receive the dimensions from God to build the ark he said in him being a carpenter he went to work and began now go read Genesis and you'll read about we're going to be best friends for this weekend's over it's okay go read Genesis 6 and you'll read about about wood and gopher you'll hear about all right it's okay brother you I knocked a guitar down the other day so amen you'll read about all kinds of instructions right amen and Noah couldn't cut one corner because if he cut one corner the ark would have sunk God give him the dimensions on how to prepare the ark amen for the saving of his household and God said I'll meet you in there now watch this how many we got any Carpenters here tonight we got any Carpenters no any construction workers okay we got real Smiley okay I've yet as my grandfather was the Carpenter I've yet to meet a carpenter who got now maybe I maybe I love you buddy get this set of plans and look at him and say That's How we'll do it I remember my grandfather used to get plans all the time and the first thing he said was we can change this we can change that well amen amen but the plan said it ought to be done this way so what you start doing is cutting corners and when it's all said and done you got an arc falling apart you know why because you cut Corners when Moses received the instructions he did not take them down to the city hall lay him out on the board and say what do you all think about this message can we preach if a woman wears makeup she ought to be called dog meat can we preach it's wrong for a man to marry a man can we preach it's wrong for a woman I'm on Church Moses said Noah didn't take their instructions down and subject the message to popular opinion but they received the message and they deliver the message and the eight Souls that got on the ark obeyed what the message was saying and the children of Israel that left Egypt obeyed what the message was said what are you saying preacher I'm saying there's a bride in the last days that doesn't say I've got a better thought I think it can be done this way if you're going to obey this word word you don't have to change amen from your opinions to the word and obey every instruction what are you saying I'm saying obedience I'm hurrying obedience causes you to surrender your own thoughts you bring every fault into captivity to the what Obedience of Christ Reverend said what do you do you let the thoughts it was in Christ be in you and that's the word 1963 free thinking I do my own thinking you ain't got no thought coming what will you do with Jesus called Christ you ain't no free thinker there is no free thinking let the mind that was in Christ be in you now how many knows amen that oh my help me Lord how many knows amen that the mate of the church is the revealed word said the mate of the church is the revealed word so what God is doing then is he is opening your eyes of understanding and he's enlightening you to your mate to the revealed word of the hour and remember him said like this he said if you're the Seed of Abraham you'll recognize the spirit of Abraham of Christ which come through Abraham by the flesh so then may the Lord grant you tonight that your eyes of understanding will be opened and if you're here tonight as a lukewarm church member I'm not criticizing you my brother I believe you to be a Christian if you've confessed Christ but just in lukewarm State my sister I'm not criticizing you but I'm trying to tell you stop that little old formal way you're living and coming to Christ be anointed and go out and do something for him don't leave your church just make a real church on fire Christian in your church that's what it is and God will take care of the rest of it what are you saying I'm saying amen that this is not a leaf Revival this bride's Revival it's not accepted y'all build fires you know amen take a handful of leaves throw it on the fire it'll burn hot and heavy for about five minutes and then it'll burn down amen so get you some more leaves throw it back home there it'll burn hot and heavy for a few services and then it'll burn down but this bride's Revival is not a leaf Revival it is a long Revival so if you want the fire to burn you quit throwing leaves on it you quit throwing just camp memes and conventions but you lay some logs of the word on the church and let the fire of God's tracking and brother it'll burn when the church is full it'll burn when the church is empty it'll burn when the bank account's full it'll burn when the banker catch it I'm on church this bride is not a bribe that's up one day and down the next amen the voice of Revelation has set her on fire and if you take that voice out of the church it'll become a lukewarm launch it'll come at lukewarm Lodge with a bunch of people arguing and fussing and carrying on Amen but if you get the voice of Revelation and the logs of the word I'm gonna I know people say well amen if you're going to have church today brother Smiley every service you're going to be shouting show me where William Branham tall fat and I'll preach it oh God I'm running out of time and I'm a preacher for a second the message of the hour is the standard of judgment on the condition of life in a church not another church come on church I have no right to come down here from Brother Sean's and judge brother Jack's Church by Brother Sean's and neither do I have a right to go from Brother Jax amen over to brother jeans and judge brother Jeans by Brother Jacks and neither do I have a right to go from Brother jeans amen where are we going next week honey somewhere and judge that church amen by this come on church we got a message and the message is the standard of judgment in the church listen I don't judge a church but how loud they can shout I don't judge a church but how hard they can dance I judge a church by their ability to say Amen to what a prophet is called concerning the word in the angel listen I'll tell you this there'll be people that'll never dance down the aisle but to walk on the streets of gold there'll be people that'll never speak in tongues but they'll sit at the marriage supper of the lamb and the same God that wipes the Shadows tears away will wipe the Believers tears away we're not here to make a bunch of Andrew Glover arts or any other preacherized we're here to preach the message and let the message break out with a spirit of influence until it changes everybody in the church [Music] Hallelujah somebody's broke through and they've come under the influence of the message therefore they're influencing by what they've been influenced by now they say what are you influencing the People by the message am I going too long the message what are you saying I'm saying what a prophet said oh God he said it's plain it was veiled he said but somebody broke through the veil he said they went in there and got the pillar of power got the blessing he said and today Veil to the people it's revealed and made plain to people God the Mighty God veiled in human flesh the word now we find out it was here to the unbeliever but it was revealed to the believer I'm coming down to the close here God reveals himself in three ways right all right first time in the pillar of fire that was called fatherhood same God manifested in Jesus Christ which he built a body made his body thirdly through the death of his body Sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was gone above us God With Us God in us the same God God reveals himself in three sons names son of man the prophet Son of God through the church ages and Son of David in the Millennium but according to Luke 17 30 between the Son of God and the son of David brother Solomon the son of man was to return to the church in the last days to fulfill scripture he said to the church age now he's been Son of God in the Millennium he'll be son of David but between this time we find out by the scripture he is to reveal himself again as the son of man a prophet and it can only be brought to a prophet thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed guilt what is revealed made known a secret a revelation or make known a secret I love this quote it's one of them it's one of them power pack quotes he said the son of man is prophesied to be revealed and what kind of a revelation will it be it'll be the revelation of his living the voice of the son of man I'm closing out will be the revelation of his living after being crucified 1900 years is raised from the dead and is alive with us he will be revealed then what are we living in tonight church we are living in the revealing of the son of man we are living in the time where the Prophet said aren't you happy to be living when the son of man is revealing himself to his church what is he revealing himself in Mercy saving your soul amen giving you of his life then the revelation of his living is his life living through You by The Obedience to the word he's revealing in the age you're living in he's giving you Joy in the Sin of sadness he's given you faith in the state of fear he's giving you healing in the state of sickness he's revealing himself the very same way he did back there what is it it's a son of man revealing the son of man it was the voice it was The Voice he said I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ somebody shout Christ and he is the one you're feeding on and if you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man what is this seventh angel brother Solomon I'll say what he said I'm a mute until he speaks through me he said I'm only his mouthpiece he said I've got to get the law of William Branham out of the way my intellectuals my spirit my knowing whatever and I get all that out of the way he can use my eyes and he can use my lips to glorify himself before his people what he's saying I'm saying the son of man is back in the church I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna tie it right here and if you fail to believe and you fail to obey the voice you will never reap a benefit direct quote I want all you dear people sitting here in the audience there I want you to believe with all your heart now remember that's the only way I could help you but now friends you believe that which you have to to be a Christian you have to believe God and the Father the Son the Holy Ghost in order to be a Christian but believe in that still won't help you in this gift you've got to believe that I've told you the truth not believe me as them but believe that they have sent me for this purpose are you ready for this now you could be a renowned Christian and fail to believe what I've told you to be the truth and you never be able to reap a benefit from it when the angels of the Lord moves down what does it do he said it becomes the voice of God to you can I can I have five minutes I'm sorry I got here too late if I offended you by saying that then you forgive me but I feel that might have been resented but I'm God's voice to you I say that again that time was under inspiration see I felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it it repeated it see who was the it it was the it he the son of man it was Christ speaking through a son of man what are you saying in Luke the fifth chapter the Bible says that the son of man hath power to forgive and to heal there was a man laying with a policy right in a bed and Jesus saw his sins faith and said man thy sins are forgiven me I love Luke 5 24 but that you may know that the son of man hath power upon Earth to forgive sins he's saith unto the sick of the palsy I say unto thee arise take up thy couch and go into thy house what are you saying I'm saying the voice of the son of man separated the man from his condition and caused him to walk into his future by the authority of the word you look in the Bible and see the Miracles that were performed by Jesus and hear Jesus say this rise up and walk take up thy bed and walk what is it it was the same voice that spoke in the Bible was speaking through the seventh angel can I leave you with this tonight is speaking in this building tonight where did oh god brother Smiley where did Congressman up Shaw after 66 years of sitting in a wheelchair he hadn't been going to physical therapy every day where did he receive strength when a voice said get up out of that chair and walk where did the strength come from the same voice the same voice that called him out of the chair was the same voice that released strength into his legs to walk brother Jack where did Georgia Carter after laying in that bed for nine years amen her legs shriveled up she's trailing nothing left of her but a prophet Heard a Voice and he received a word go by the way of Carter's listen amen Georgia Carter didn't just shout cause William Brandon walked in there she didn't just scream because he walked in there but where did the miracle take place when she received and obeyed what he said amen you know what she had to do she had to defy her own Mother's done unbelief she had to defy her own families unbelief amen she said listen if I don't obey this voice I'll lay in this bed the rest of my life but when she heard that voice she said that's the truth and for the first time in nine years she got up out of that bed and she didn't crawl out in the front yard oh come on church but she took off running to the front yard but remember said what did she do he said she went over sat down and started playing the piano brother Jack some just come to this room and I gotta pick it up she didn't just go over there and say what key do I play in how do I hold my hands how do I sit on the stool amen when the voice spoke to her amen for nine years because of a molestation by her uncle amen that gift had been put on pause she was laying in a crippled condition but when the voice of the son of man amen to Ace in a man said Georgia get out of that bed she didn't go stumble across the keys the prophet said she picked up where she left off and I believe there's some people here tonight you've been sitting there crying you've been sitting there tore up you've been sitting there cause somebody offended you and somebody said something about you but the son of man is in this building tonight his voice is speaking if you can hear his voice you can receive his Voice come on spirit and true Tabernacle it's time to pick up where you left off I said it's time to pick up I'm going to preach to you by the word of faith and then you think this is just a pause this ain't a pause you just wait till you get that new building you just wait till you go shouting in there you just wait till God the same God that done it for somebody else does it for you you'll say hey on a Friday night the son of man spoke and said her eyes arise close up that school and walk on into your new building it's a new day the son of man is spoke let us stand our feet it's a new day what are they say it oh God it's a new day if you can hear his voice if you can receive his voice you can obey his voice you'll walk in the blessings of his voice you'll gather under the blessings of his voice I Heard a Voice say go by the way of Carters he said look like a skeleton people would think to look at her standing there I don't know but God's power lifted her up and there she was standing she was standing in the power of the Resurrection Jesus Christ and any person that'll dare to take God to his world will stand you it's a are you ready for this brother Smiley how can they I love this it's a supernatural power that stands you lifts you up take that power off of her and she would have crumbled like a pile of bones no the only time she's ever been in bed since then was to go to bed at night and go to sleep she's playing the piano down there why he said because when God speaks all hell moves when God speaks all hell moves that's everything can stand in his presence he said everything that cannot stand in his presence when the voice of Heaven speaks on the Earth all hell backs up come on you know I'm telling you the truth do you realize what you're under oh my he'll forgive me I'm done but do you all realize what you're under you're under a word of creation power I could take time right now brother Solomon and give you some more examples whatever he says do just do it if he says bring me a picture of water just take it to him if you're Peter out I was listening at Thy word preached in West Palm Beach only over here or not Birmingham said if you're Peter out there fish on the water he said while you're fishing he said you're a fisherman and you know there's no fish in there and he said Here Comes Jesus walking by and says Peter let down my net he said but Lord there's he said but then he remembered Reverend stopped he said then he remembered he said so he let down the net I got thinking about that the one who created the fish he was letting his net Down Under The Power of word creative of cred listen if Jesus listen he could have been out in the desert somewhere and Jesus said let down your net in the dust and there would have been water and there had been fish there because it's the voice of creation come on Spirit true Tabernacle amen you're under that same voice tonight you're under that same power you ain't got to back up and say well I guess this is what you got to settle for you can go somewhere where there is nothing and under the voice of the son of man you can say Let There be this let there be that you can stand before a negative report and say let that go out of existence and let the positive charge of the almighty word of God come into effect what are you saying I'm saying take the supernatural power away from this church and it'll crumble and fall into a crippled condition but if that power is here it's the same power whatever he says do just do it brother Solomon just just do it just bring him the picture of water just just let down the net come on bud Southwick your brother's been having epileptic fits for years it's crazy to the carnal mind but he says next time he has a fit foreign down and grab that shirt take that shirt off throw it in the fire in the name of Jesus Christ Birmingham said they went home said a few days later said his brother broke out well then Fitz said his wife ran in there jerked the shirt off of him took it over the fire said this I do in the name of Jesus Christ I love what verbum said he said I looked at bud before I told him do it and said Do you believe my word will you believe my word he said yes brother Branham he said see that's why it was easier for Bud to believe about that caribou he had already seen the voice of the son of man manifested listen I could preach all night in this atmosphere I'm asking you are you willing to do it whatever he says do just do it just do it just do it little boy can I have your lunch or it's not much but here it is I got to stop I'm getting into Sunday here it is Lord what about a spirit and Truth Tabernacle it's the hour it's the season

prophet but I am under a prophetic Commission preach the message and the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always I may not see him tonight and I may not feel him but it don't mean he's not here but I feel him here your spirit's witness and he's here what are you saying I'm saying whatever he says do tonight do it will you bow your hearts with us tonight will there be one here tonight

building under my control and Lord every Spirit has been brought subject to the Holy Spirit and has been cast out of this building that the spirit of creation could come down in this room and Lord while the words going forth the Believers can begin to speak things out Lord now father I know the world religion Hollywood has evangelized the churches and has made a joke out of the power of
