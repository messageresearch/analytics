[7:17] Appreciate y'all. Thank God for the
[7:18] specials. Amen. this morning, Brother
[7:21] Troy, Sister Sarah.
[7:25] Amen. And and I like the way they open
[7:27] the service there with with Mama's Song.
[7:31] Uh that was they will come. They will
[7:33] come. Yeah, it was really really nice.
[7:37] Amen. Um I want to um just read a
[7:42] scripture. Amen. For today.
[7:46] And um
[7:49] we um being that it's Father's Day, we
[7:52] certainly want to try to say something
[7:54] to be edifying. Amen. To the fathers and
[7:58] the families. Um uh uh I'm going to go
[8:02] to Ephesians 6. Uh but also wanted to
[8:04] say um thank you for everyone that was
[8:07] able to come and support um Sister
[8:12] Vernon yesterday. Amen. and and her
[8:15] family. Uh, Brother Smiley did a
[8:18] wonderful job. Amen. With the word of
[8:22] the Lord.
[8:24] And, uh, it was just all I can say is
[8:26] just right on time. Amen. It's talking
[8:29] about time and appointed time. And um,
[8:33] it was just the perfect sermon for the
[8:35] occasion because um, Sister Vera's
[8:38] sister, the way that she passed, it was
[8:40] so um, I just have to say peaceful.
[8:44] Um, I got a chance to talk with uh,
[8:47] brother Jimmy's oldest son there,
[8:49] Jeremiah, and he was just saying he was
[8:50] at the house knocking uh, and auntie
[8:53] wouldn't come to the door. And he could
[8:55] hear her in there just saying, "Okay,
[8:56] okay." That she was coming to the door.
[8:58] And he just waited and she never came.
[9:01] So he called somebody else and said,
[9:03] "Uh, please come and open the door cuz
[9:04] auntie not coming to open the door." And
[9:06] when they open up the door, auntie was
[9:08] gone just like that. So it was her
[9:12] appointed time. It was a time for her to
[9:15] be born and then it was a time for her
[9:17] to die. All right. But but like brother
[9:20] Smiley said, God and his sovereign grace
[9:22] uses moments like these
[9:25] in order to bring people into the
[9:27] presence of God so they can hear a word
[9:29] from the Lord. And and it just like I
[9:32] say just a wonderful wonderful thought.
[9:34] Amen. And last night he also had to
[9:36] preach at a meeting here. Uh, and we
[9:39] thank God for him being able to take
[9:41] that Amen. on on yesterday. So, we we we
[9:43] just appreciate the Lord. Um, Amen. They
[9:47] they put Brother Smiley on the on the uh
[9:49] program as as brother uh brother Smiley.
[9:54] That's the way we talk. And uh but after
[9:56] he finished preaching, brother say, "No,
[9:59] we going to have to change this. You
[10:00] can't. You not just brother. You
[10:02] reverend
[10:04] minister. You Amen. And I've been
[10:07] preaching for 30 years.
[10:10] They was ready to ordain him, right?
[10:14] He already been ordained.
[10:18] It's just a church world. They seek
[10:20] titles, you know. Amen. But uh but they
[10:23] were very impressed. Amen. So we we just
[10:25] thank God for for all things. Uh a quick
[10:28] scripture, amen, that we'll read here.
[10:30] Uh Ephesians 6 and and 4. Amen.
[10:34] Ephesians 6 and 4. Um the the Bible
[10:39] says, "And ye fathers,
[10:42] uh provoke not your children to wrath,
[10:45] but bring them up in the nurture and
[10:48] admonition of the Lord." Let's pray over
[10:50] the word. Father, we thank you for um
[10:54] the service thus far and all that you
[10:57] have done, God, and in in the midst of
[11:01] uh your people. just a wonderful
[11:03] atmosphere of worship and praise and
[11:05] thanksgiving and uh and now Lord we uh
[11:08] approach the word and ask that you take
[11:10] control over uh our thoughts the
[11:13] thoughts that are being presented and
[11:15] the thoughts that are being received.
[11:17] May your spirit father just come and uh
[11:20] bring strength to our fathers. Uh we we
[11:24] thank you for each and every one of
[11:26] them, Lord. And Lord, just uh what they
[11:29] mean, not only to their families, but
[11:30] what they mean here to the church. We
[11:32] just appreciate each one. And ask, oh
[11:34] God, that your blessings would be upon
[11:37] each one. And and uh that you, God,
[11:39] would just get glory and honor out of
[11:41] every heart and every life. It's in
[11:42] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can
[11:46] be seated.
[11:48] Um,
[11:50] we're reading this scripture
[11:53] and I want to just take for a title uh
[11:56] for this Father's Day. Three
[12:00] freeing words.
[12:02] Amen. Three
[12:04] freeing words.
[12:08] Uh, just bear with me as we work through
[12:11] the
[12:13] um
[12:15] the the sermon. Amen. on today. Just a a
[12:18] couple like an introductory quote here
[12:20] from the sermon leadership
[12:25] and brother Brandham makes a a
[12:27] statement. It says um the first is the
[12:32] mother's kindness
[12:35] uh then the father's word.
[12:39] uh after the mother gives you your first
[12:43] step and and um you know he was talking
[12:46] about you know uh uh in this quote I
[12:50] didn't read I'm not reading the whole
[12:51] thing just for time sake but he was
[12:53] talking about how usually it's it's
[12:55] daddy that's going off to work and um
[12:58] you know providing for the family and uh
[13:03] and and and it's daddy's typically not
[13:06] there to see that child take his first
[13:08] step. Usually, it's a mama that is home
[13:12] uh watching the children and um uh and
[13:16] uh and and she's the one that's
[13:17] watching, you know, she she she hears
[13:19] that child uh speak his first words and
[13:22] then she might see the child take his
[13:24] first step and she can't wait for daddy
[13:26] to come home to be able to u have that
[13:30] child walk to daddy, right? Or or or or
[13:33] or say something to daddy, right? Uh but
[13:36] usually mama's mama's first in in
[13:38] hearing those things but daddy is still
[13:40] a part of the the process right and uh
[13:43] you know so he he was saying here uh
[13:46] after the mother gives you your first
[13:48] step then you look to your daddy all of
[13:52] us and it says uh for wisdom because he
[13:56] is the head of the house and usually not
[14:00] not that he's any smarter but he's just
[14:04] made a leader
[14:05] of his family. Now, that's a important
[14:08] thing to grasp. Amen. From from the
[14:11] prophet. Uh not that he's any smarter.
[14:15] Right.
[14:18] Um you know, cuz daddy might not have
[14:21] the same level of education that mama
[14:24] has. However, God has given daddy
[14:28] something
[14:29] that mama will never have. Praise the
[14:32] Lord. Just like God gave mama something
[14:35] that daddy would never have, God has
[14:36] given certain things to daddy that mama
[14:38] will never have. Right? And when we
[14:42] understand this, it makes the family
[14:44] dynamics a lot better.
[14:48] God put leadership characteristics
[14:51] inside of daddy. And often times, you
[14:54] know, uh in in the household, especially
[14:56] when tough times come, uh you know, u
[14:59] mama won't answers. How we going to do
[15:02] this and how we going to do that and how
[15:04] we going to do that? And daddy just be
[15:05] so calm and uh ain't said nothing like
[15:10] he don't even see the thing happening.
[15:12] He see it. He feel it. But he knows that
[15:16] he can't do nothing until God give him
[15:19] Amen. A direction.
[15:22] He I mean he can't make it up, right?
[15:24] But he depending on God. So often times,
[15:26] mama, you got to just wait because he
[15:28] has a connection with God. He realized
[15:30] his responsibilities.
[15:33] You realize that and without God, I'm
[15:35] going to tell you something like this.
[15:36] Without God, you can't raise your
[15:37] family.
[15:39] Amen. You if you didn't you don't depend
[15:42] on God, ain't no way you going to raise
[15:44] that family. Hallelujah. I mean, and as
[15:47] brother SM was saying yesterday, ain't
[15:48] no book that we can go to you. You read
[15:51] everybody book and you be trying to
[15:53] apply them things that they that the
[15:55] that book said, but it don't work on
[15:56] your children because your kids are
[15:59] different.
[16:01] That they wrote that book for their
[16:03] family and it worked in their family,
[16:05] but it may not work in your family.
[16:07] You're going to have to trust God.
[16:12] Uh oh, you say I wouldn't admit that,
[16:15] Brother Brandham.
[16:16] But but look, if that dove of meekness
[16:19] is gone from you, brother, there's
[16:22] something wrong. Is that there's
[16:24] something wrong when you can't bear with
[16:26] one another. When you can't forgive
[16:29] every person from the depths of your
[16:31] heart, no matter what they've done or
[16:35] what they've said, if you can't forgive
[16:40] them from the depths, Jesus said, "If
[16:43] you don't forgive every man's trespass
[16:46] from your heart, neither does your
[16:48] heavenly father forgive you." Amen. Let
[16:52] me just read. Amen. uh Matthew 6 uh
[16:56] verse 9-16
[16:58] uh as we just bring that that quote a
[17:02] little bit more to life uh he just
[17:05] quoted scripture out of Matthew 6 and uh
[17:09] we'll we'll read that really really
[17:10] quick.
[17:12] Hallelujah.
[17:15] Amen. Three freeing words.
[17:19] Amen. Matthew 6 and let me just grab
[17:23] hold of that and I think uh let's see I
[17:25] want to go verse uh verse 9.
[17:30] All right.
[17:34] It says um
[17:36] after this manner
[17:39] therefore pray ye
[17:41] our father
[17:43] which art in heaven
[17:45] hallowed be thy name
[17:48] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[17:51] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[17:55] day our daily bread.
[17:58] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[18:02] our debtors.
[18:04] And lead us not into temptation,
[18:07] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[18:10] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[18:14] forever. Amen. Now I before we go
[18:18] further, Jesus is teaching his disciples
[18:20] how to pray. Yeah. And and and and you
[18:23] know, this is not a long drawn out
[18:25] prayer, but it has a lot of different
[18:28] elements in this prayer. Uh there is
[18:30] some praise in this prayer. There's some
[18:33] worship in this prayer. There is some
[18:36] submitting to the will of God. Uh in
[18:40] this prayer, there is some forgiveness
[18:45] uh in this prayer. There's certain
[18:47] elements that go along with prayer.
[18:50] Amen. When you're praying, amen, for
[18:52] someone, you're not praying that God
[18:54] would get them.
[18:56] [Music]
[18:58] Get them, Lord. No, that ain't prayer.
[19:01] Right. That is not prayer. I mean,
[19:03] you're you're asking God, God, God, God,
[19:05] God, God, for forgive forgive them.
[19:08] Amen. I mean, I know they hurt me and
[19:10] and Lord, I I I mean, I I I need your
[19:13] forgiveness and I'm asking that you
[19:14] forgive them for what they did for me,
[19:16] did to me, right? Hallelujah. It's three
[19:20] freeing words.
[19:23] It It's all right here in the Lord's
[19:24] prayer. And And notice now the very next
[19:27] thing he says after he tells them uh to
[19:29] pray this way. Hallelujah. The very next
[19:32] thing he says is um uh verse uh 14. For
[19:36] if ye forgive men their trespasses,
[19:41] your heavenly father will also forgive
[19:44] you. And I love this on Father's Day
[19:46] because sometimes fathers have caused
[19:48] their children to be provoked.
[19:51] Amen. They cause anger, amen, toward in
[19:54] in their children's lives. That
[19:55] resentment and thing things that we fail
[19:57] to do cause resentment. Hallelujah.
[20:00] Amen. But I I I I want kids to know
[20:03] sometimes is that, you know, until you
[20:05] become a parent, you don't even
[20:07] understand what parenting is all about.
[20:11] And not that fathers intentionally try
[20:14] to do things to make you resentful, but
[20:16] but we just humans.
[20:19] And can I say we just fallen humans.
[20:22] Hallelujah. And you a fallen human, too.
[20:24] And one day you're going to recognize
[20:26] when you fail to be able to be
[20:28] everything your kids need you to be. And
[20:30] now they blaming you. And then you cause
[20:32] me to I'm resenting you. Well, all I
[20:35] tried to do is put food on the table.
[20:37] Right. Yeah.
[20:39] That's all I tried to do. I tried to put
[20:41] a roof over your head, right? But we
[20:44] live in a society where people want a
[20:46] lot more than just a roof over the head.
[20:48] Now, let me tell you something now. And
[20:50] and I know we we we listen to all this
[20:52] stuff, you know, different people, you
[20:54] know, cuz it's I I I believe that it's
[20:56] it's it's certainly our responsibility
[20:57] to meet emotional needs and and and
[21:00] physical needs and financial needs. I
[21:02] believe that the that is the man's
[21:03] responsibility. Say, but you got to
[21:05] balance all of that. He cannot only
[21:08] focus on the emotional needs.
[21:10] Somebody got to still pay bills.
[21:14] Hello, somebody. And and don't don't get
[21:17] me wrong. I think there's a balance in
[21:18] all this. Yet, I think a father need to
[21:20] be involved in his children's life. But
[21:22] it can't always be emotional needs.
[21:26] If if I'm just there to meet all the
[21:27] emotional needs and and and look, let me
[21:29] tell you something. You're going to get
[21:29] upset with me when we ain't got no where
[21:31] to live.
[21:33] But I'm here to meet your emotions,
[21:34] though. Now I'm I'm here for you. But
[21:37] daddy, when you going to go to work?
[21:41] It's a balance that we always trying to
[21:43] find here in life.
[21:46] Glory to God. Don't don't don't don't
[21:48] lean too far on one side. That's right.
[21:50] And if you ever find yourself leaning
[21:52] too far on one side, I got three freeing
[21:55] words. All right. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[22:00] Let me keep on reading. Yeah.
[22:03] Verse 14 says, "For if you forgive men
[22:06] their trespasses, your heavenly Father
[22:08] will also forgive you. But if you
[22:11] forgive not men their trespasses,
[22:15] neither will your father
[22:17] forgive your trespasses."
[22:20] We need three freeing words cuz you know
[22:23] sometimes we can look back and say,
[22:25] "Man, dad fell. Dad did this. Dad did
[22:28] that." and and and and and you and in in
[22:30] some of our lives, my life, I'm I'mma be
[22:34] the example here. uh in my life my my
[22:37] biological biological father fell
[22:41] and you know I remember um going to you
[22:46] know I mean I'm I'll just be personal
[22:48] here but um when my my um there was a
[22:54] couple things that happened you know in
[22:56] my life because I was I was so um
[23:01] blessed by a stepfather
[23:04] and having him in my life. Uh, I got to
[23:07] a point in my life one time where I
[23:09] actually wanted my name changed
[23:12] and I didn't want to carry the last name
[23:14] Duff anymore. I wanted to carry the name
[23:17] Bur. That's that's how impressed I was
[23:20] by my my my my my stepdad. And I had a
[23:24] conversation and had a talk with my
[23:26] stepdad and and uh told him what I
[23:28] wanted to do. And I and I thought for
[23:29] sure he'd be just so happy for me to
[23:32] take on his name. But my daddy said,
[23:36] "Mm-
[23:38] no, no, don't don't don't do that. Uh,
[23:42] no. Keep keep your name. It it's it it's
[23:44] going to be all right." I said, "Wow,
[23:46] man."
[23:48] Jesus. Wow.
[23:52] But I didn't understand.
[23:55] Yeah. Until my biological father was
[23:59] passing away. and and and what happened
[24:00] in my life. I lost my biological father
[24:04] in November and then lost my stepdad in
[24:08] December in the same year.
[24:11] And um but I remember when my biological
[24:14] father got ill and um and I I was uh
[24:19] asked
[24:20] um they told me about it. They called me
[24:22] and they told me and I was at work and I
[24:25] remember um I got the call and and you
[24:28] know my boss could see my countenance
[24:30] change and uh so my boss uh he's like
[24:33] Jack what's going on? I say um you know
[24:36] my biological father is having heart
[24:39] failure right now and he's in the
[24:40] hospital and they you know um they've
[24:42] revived him a couple times. They just
[24:44] don't think he's going to make it. They
[24:46] said, "Jack, you got to go see him." I
[24:47] say, "Uh nah, not really. I mean, he
[24:51] he was never there for me.
[24:54] He was never there for me. I said, "No,
[24:57] you you got to go see him." I said,
[25:00] "I'll uh I'll look at some flights." So,
[25:02] I went and talked to my my my my dad. I
[25:06] said, "You know, this is what's going
[25:08] on. What you think?" He said, "You need
[25:09] to go see him." My dad was sick at the
[25:10] time. He said, "You need to go see him."
[25:12] I said, "Oh, Lord." So, daddy said it. I
[25:16] feel like, "Okay, I'm I'm I'mma make
[25:17] this happen." And I went up there and I
[25:19] and I got to the hospital and I got a
[25:21] chance to see my my dad, my my
[25:23] biological father and um and you know we
[25:26] had a talk and everything like that and
[25:29] um you know and and you know at that
[25:32] moment you can't talk about all of life
[25:34] cuz he's just he's getting ready to
[25:36] leave, you know. So uh just talked over
[25:38] a few things and we talked about you
[25:40] know being ready for when you leave
[25:42] here, right? And um you know so I had a
[25:45] had a chance just to kind of talk and
[25:47] pray with him. And um and when I left
[25:50] the hospital
[25:52] um my I left and my uncle was coming his
[25:55] brother was coming in and as I as I'm
[25:57] leaving the hospital and going out um
[26:00] you know I I make it back home after I
[26:02] want to say within a week of me getting
[26:05] back home they call and say daddy's
[26:06] gone. So um he was um um he was a part
[26:12] of a church because he wasn't living the
[26:14] way that they wanted him to live. They
[26:16] would they refused to do his funeral. I
[26:17] said that's okay. He he got a son that
[26:20] could actually preach his funeral. So
[26:22] that's that's no problem. Right. So you
[26:24] know we I I went back and and and not
[26:26] only preach but even helped pay for his
[26:29] funeral expenses,
[26:31] right?
[26:32] Because of three three words,
[26:36] right? and uh and I helped pay for his
[26:38] funeral expenses and and I'm sitting
[26:40] there and I'm going through the program
[26:42] and uh and you know I'm I'm I'm I'm just
[26:45] moderating and and handling the program
[26:47] for him and uh and I got I see all these
[26:50] young men they say you know that when
[26:52] they on the program they have uh people
[26:54] that can come up and speak for two
[26:56] minutes please all these guys get up
[26:58] speaking for two minutes and they talk
[26:59] about how this how Jackie Duff uh did
[27:03] this for him and did that for him and
[27:04] did this for him and I'm and I'm sitting
[27:06] there in the pool pit like Jackie Duff
[27:09] did what for who?
[27:13] I'm I'm his blood.
[27:16] I I ain't got that testimony.
[27:19] But in the but I can't I can't take that
[27:21] to the pull pit, right? I I I have to
[27:24] guard what I'm saying here. And uh
[27:26] because I'm sitting there like, man,
[27:28] that I'm glad he did it for somebody,
[27:30] but it didn't happen for me,
[27:33] Jesus.
[27:35] But because of free and words, I didn't
[27:37] have to go there with that. I I could
[27:39] just preach a sermon. And you know, and
[27:41] I'mma tell you, when when my my stepdad
[27:44] told me not to take his name, I realized
[27:46] what my name meant. When I saw my
[27:48] biological father's name on an obituary
[27:52] because now I'm carrying that name.
[27:56] God got purpose for everything. You
[27:59] don't have to be bitter about nothing.
[28:03] And I know fathers can do things to
[28:04] provoke us to wrath, but God has given
[28:07] us three freeing words so we don't have
[28:09] to walk underneath that wrath for the
[28:12] rest of our life. Amen. Let me uh give
[28:16] you a couple definitions. Unforgiveness.
[28:21] The root cause of unforgiveness is often
[28:24] deep-seated sense of hurt.
[28:28] is anger or betrayal leading to a desire
[28:31] for revenge or vindication.
[28:34] Uh and this can stem from various life
[28:36] experiences including past traumas,
[28:40] family dynamics. And so unforgiveness or
[28:43] wrath or uh uh uh provoking child wrath,
[28:46] it can come from family dynamics. Now,
[28:49] now let me give you let me just give you
[28:50] an example. uh in the in the in the
[28:53] household of of uh Jacob, he had 12 sons
[28:57] or Israel, he had 12 sons. You could see
[29:00] that he treated one boy a little
[29:03] different from the others. Joseph was
[29:06] given a rainbow coat, right? And and now
[29:10] he
[29:11] I don't know why he didn't think to
[29:13] provide the other brothers, other sons
[29:15] something,
[29:17] right? But he g he gives Joseph this
[29:19] rainbow coat and it create this anger.
[29:23] It create this resentment.
[29:26] It create these problems in the house.
[29:28] And let me tell you something that one
[29:30] coat cause problems for years.
[29:37] So So daddy, you got to watch the gift
[29:39] that you give your kids. You got to make
[29:41] sure that they all treated equally. Now,
[29:44] now don't don't get me wrong here. I
[29:45] realize you can't try to keep treat a
[29:48] girl the same way you treat a boy.
[29:53] Don't buy her no Tonka truck.
[29:57] Don't do that. And I'm just trying to
[29:59] treat you equally. No. Come on. Be
[30:01] sensitive to what what her needs are.
[30:04] Glory to God. Somebody be but find out
[30:08] what her needs and what her likes are
[30:09] and and try to get her something. Amen.
[30:11] Along those lines. Amen. Hallelujah.
[30:15] Don't buy her jumper cable. Well, maybe
[30:17] she do need them, but a a tool box,
[30:22] right? You don't you don't do things
[30:23] like that.
[30:25] Amen. And when it when it's time to buy
[30:28] cars, praise God. Amen. Here you go out
[30:32] and get one of them a Mercedes and then
[30:34] the other one got a hund a Hyundai.
[30:37] No, you don't do your kids like that.
[30:41] Everybody get Hyundai.
[30:46] And when you ready to buy your car, you
[30:48] go out there and buy your car. Amen. But
[30:51] but but we got we got to we got to
[30:52] realize sometimes you can create you can
[30:55] create bad dynamics in the family with
[30:57] decisions that you make.
[31:00] That's mama and daddy.
[31:03] But it's my f No, no, no, no, no, no,
[31:05] no, no, no. All of them. All of them my
[31:07] favorite. Amen. All of them my favorite.
[31:10] and and and I expect to be all I I
[31:13] expect to be their favorite daddy
[31:17] for all my kids.
[31:20] All right.
[31:22] But unforgiveness stems from deepseated
[31:26] sense of hurt, anger, betrayal leading
[31:29] to desire for revenge or vindication.
[31:31] This can stem from various life's
[31:33] experiences including past traumas,
[31:36] family dynamics, and here's another one.
[31:39] Unfulfilled expectations.
[31:41] That's right. Amen.
[31:44] I was I was reading a poem.
[31:50] um
[31:52] about a lady who uh she wrote this to
[31:55] her dad and and I I read it and I and I
[31:58] said to myself, I'mma I'mma take that
[32:00] save it. I'm I'mma I'mma read that one
[32:03] cuz I think that'll be good for us on
[32:04] Father's Day. And some kind of way I I I
[32:07] didn't save it and and I couldn't get
[32:09] back to it even in my search history.
[32:12] But the um the gist of it was this lady
[32:15] talked about waiting always waiting on
[32:18] her daddy to come through and she say
[32:21] that um we would be home. We knew Friday
[32:25] was coming. We knew that we needed
[32:28] grocery in the house. We knew that we
[32:30] needed the lights on and we needed this
[32:32] and we expecting daddy to come home and
[32:34] bring mama the money so she can pay the
[32:36] bills. But uh when Friday would come,
[32:39] Friday would pass and there was, you
[32:42] know, daddy daddy daddy never showed up.
[32:44] Daddy daddy never called, daddy never
[32:46] said nothing. Now we're dealing with no
[32:48] food in the house. And now we're dealing
[32:51] with no lights on and and and we just I
[32:54] mean the water getting turned off, all
[32:55] kind of things happening because just
[32:57] daddy was not there. He didn't fulfill
[33:01] his expectations, right? He knew mama
[33:04] couldn't go out there and work. She got
[33:05] all the kids at home and and daddy, you
[33:07] was responsible for making these kids.
[33:10] But now now, daddy, when it's time to to
[33:12] to to to bring bring the money home,
[33:15] daddy can't be found,
[33:18] right? And and and so sometimes what
[33:20] happens, amen, with kids when they have
[33:22] to grow up and and I got stat I had some
[33:24] statistics when when kids grow up in a
[33:26] household where where where where where
[33:28] where dad is just not involved and dad
[33:30] is not doing the things that he needs to
[33:32] do, it really it really reres havoc in
[33:34] that kid's life. Yes, it does. It wres
[33:38] havoc, right? I mean many of the kids
[33:40] that they they find uh you know in
[33:43] prison uh that that come from single
[33:44] parent homes is it's I mean you got it's
[33:47] a higher number of children going to
[33:49] prison that because they didn't have a
[33:51] dad in their life. It's they actually
[33:53] say it's a higher number of kids like
[33:55] that with mental issues because they did
[33:58] not have a father in their life. Daddy
[34:01] wasn't home. Daddy wasn't there to to
[34:04] take care of things. They they they they
[34:06] grew up with years and years and years
[34:10] of resentment.
[34:14] This lady just was talking about, you
[34:17] know, how they they she looked for daddy
[34:20] to come and support mama through these
[34:21] hard times, but daddy just never came
[34:24] through. And and and because of the
[34:26] failures of daddy, this lady just held
[34:28] on to a lot of bitterness. And I want to
[34:30] tell you something. Uh when when when I
[34:33] go through sermons like this, I know
[34:34] some of y'all can go in your minds like,
[34:35] "Yeah, I remember my daddy. He failed.
[34:37] My daddy this. My daddy." Yeah. Yeah.
[34:39] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But God has given you
[34:41] three freeing words.
[34:45] God has given you three freeing words.
[34:48] Amen.
[34:49] Here, let me read this from the message.
[34:51] The uncertain sound. Oh. Um yeah, that's
[34:54] fine. The uncertain sound.
[34:58] It says anything that's uncertain is
[35:02] unreliable.
[35:04] Anything that's
[35:07] uncertain
[35:08] is reliable. I mean unreliable.
[35:11] Unreliable. It says so so when uh when
[35:15] days of this time when they're not
[35:17] certain whether Jesus is the same
[35:19] yesterday, today, and forever, leave the
[35:21] thing alone. says, "You can be certain,
[35:23] you can you you you can know it to be
[35:25] that he uh if if he never performs any
[35:28] more miracle on you, but the great
[35:31] miracle forgives your sin, that's the
[35:34] greatest miracle that God ever performed
[35:37] was to forgive a human being it sin."
[35:41] I want to I want to read that again. The
[35:44] greatest miracle that God ever
[35:48] performed, The greatest miracle that God
[35:52] ever performed was to forgive a human
[35:56] being its sin.
[36:00] My God, my God, my God. He says, "Take a
[36:04] man and convert him from the things uh
[36:09] uh from the things look that that's
[36:11] changed his innermost being from the
[36:13] things that he once drank and gambled
[36:16] and done evil and things like that and
[36:18] all of a sudden turns him right back
[36:20] around to love and goes home to his wife
[36:22] and say, "Honey, I'm sorry and I' that
[36:25] I've treated you like that. Pick up his
[36:27] little children and hold them in in the
[36:29] arm. Daddy spent all of his money for
[36:32] whiskey and daddy's done this and the
[36:34] mother's been out all night and left you
[36:36] uh left left you children. I'll never do
[36:39] it again. God forgive me. And how that
[36:42] testimony that's one of the greatest
[36:44] things there is all the alcoholics
[36:46] anonymous and all like that can never
[36:50] change like that can. They can never do
[36:53] for the person. And brother Brandham is
[36:55] saying here, the greatest thing, the
[36:57] greatest miracle that God can perform on
[36:59] a human being is to forgive them of
[37:02] their sins.
[37:08] If if that's the greatest miracle
[37:11] that God can perform on a human being,
[37:13] not no not not remove cancer. Right.
[37:17] Right. No, not not not I mean, you know,
[37:20] uh any other ailment that you might
[37:22] have. No, no, that's not the greatest
[37:24] miracle. It's when God can actually say,
[37:27] "Oh, y'all y'all ready for these three
[37:30] three words?" It's when God can say, "I
[37:33] forgive you."
[37:38] Amen. And if th if those are if those
[37:40] are if that's the the greatest thing
[37:42] that God can give you, then what you
[37:45] think the greatest thing we can give to
[37:46] one another?
[37:49] Amen. Is when you can come to the
[37:51] threeing words and really mean it with
[37:54] all your heart. Amen. I forgive you.
[38:02] Oh, you want to go free?
[38:05] Oh Jesus.
[38:07] Oh my.
[38:09] Do me a favor. Get my book bag from back
[38:12] there. Let's bring it up here. Thank you
[38:15] very much.
[38:21] It's something
[38:23] when we when we can when we can do that.
[38:27] Why you carrying it with two hands?
[38:30] No. No. No. Why you Why you had to carry
[38:33] it with two hands?
[38:37] freaked
[38:41] [Music]
[38:52] you carrying the light version.
[39:08] You okay, brother? Yeah, I'm good.
[39:17] If you notice when brother Joseph
[39:19] brought that book bag up here, he
[39:21] brought it with two hands. And if
[39:23] anybody ever carried my book bag,
[39:27] they realize how heavy my bag is. Now,
[39:31] brother Joseph didn't hold it on his
[39:33] hands too long. If you notice, you know
[39:36] what he did? He put it on his back. But
[39:40] really, this still kind of heavy.
[39:44] And the the way for brother Joseph to
[39:46] get free is to actually just he asked
[39:49] me, "Can I put it on the chair?
[39:55] Yes, brother. You can put it on the
[39:57] chair.
[40:01] Can I tell y'all something? When you
[40:03] say, "I forgive you."
[40:07] It's like getting rid of the book bag.
[40:12] I'm talking about the really heavy book
[40:13] bag. You ain't got to carry that around
[40:16] all your life. You can set the book bag
[40:19] down on the chair. Yes. Hallelujah. And
[40:21] and that's not Joseph's responsibility
[40:24] anymore. He did exactly what I asked him
[40:26] to go get my book bag. But I ain't
[40:28] carrying this book bag the rest of the
[40:30] day. I'm going to sit it right here on
[40:32] the chair. I'm going to get free of this
[40:34] thing. I forgive you are three words
[40:38] that will set you free.
[40:42] Thank you, my brother.
[40:44] God bless you. Let me get my Bible out.
[40:47] Hallelujah.
[40:51] Hallelujah.
[40:56] Thank you, brother Joseph.
[41:01] Brother Brandham was at a a meeting
[41:06] and we heard this in the sermon, the
[41:09] path of life.
[41:13] Um while we were listening to that tape
[41:15] a few weeks ago, this just sprung out to
[41:18] me. He had an experience where
[41:22] um something happened. Let me just let
[41:24] me just make sure I don't miss something
[41:26] here. I want to Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[41:28] Okay. All right. Make sure we
[41:31] where we need to be. Um he had an
[41:35] experience
[41:36] where this uh this this Lutheran dean
[41:42] had sent him a letter and he was saying
[41:44] to him, "Man, what what what what I
[41:48] drove all this all these miles
[41:52] through through a snowstorm to come and
[41:55] hear you preach
[41:57] and um
[41:59] can I just read it? Yes. Give me give me
[42:02] the path of life.
[42:06] But it's it's something about when the
[42:07] way that the way the prophet handled it.
[42:10] Yes. That's that's the thing that I want
[42:12] to kind of bring out is the way he
[42:14] handled it. Not only the way he handled
[42:16] it. I want to try to bring this into
[42:18] family life, right? I want to take this
[42:21] quote and bring it into family life
[42:22] because we we sometimes we don't
[42:24] understand and and sometimes we look uh
[42:27] to get things from people that they
[42:29] don't have.
[42:32] I'm going to say that again. We we look
[42:34] to get things from people they don't
[42:37] have it to give you.
[42:41] Oh my. We we want them to show a certain
[42:44] type of love. But you know what? The
[42:46] reason they can't show that type of love
[42:47] is because they never receive that type
[42:49] of love. And if they don't have that
[42:52] type of love, it's not in them to give
[42:53] it to you. I know you reading books. I
[42:57] know you listening to radio programs. I
[42:59] I I get all that, but that's not what
[43:02] people have in them all the time. And
[43:04] and what it is is is is is you're coming
[43:07] to a spot where you got to realize that
[43:09] since they ain't they ain't got it, I'm
[43:10] not going to hold that against them.
[43:13] Amen. You have to come to three freeing
[43:15] words. Amen. I'm going to tell you, when
[43:18] you get there, you can put your book bag
[43:21] down.
[43:23] Let's look at this. The path of life.
[43:25] The path of life.
[43:27] Recently, I had a meeting with the
[43:28] Lutheran Brethren. I guess you all heard
[43:31] of it at Minneapolis, Minnesota. And oh
[43:34] my, did he ever rake me over the coals
[43:35] in a 22page letter. Can you imagine
[43:38] that? a 22 page of the path of life. In
[43:42] a 22page letter, he said the very idea
[43:48] uh said, "I drove 15 miles last night
[43:52] through a a a blinding snowstorm.
[43:55] Thought I would hear a servant of Christ
[43:57] and what did I hear but a polished up
[43:59] soothsayer."
[44:01] says, "Thought I would hear uh" he says
[44:04] uh and and oh, he said, "The very idea
[44:06] of you, a man with 15 years in the
[44:08] mission fields and say you've been
[44:11] preaching the gospel for 25 years and
[44:13] said here here you here you use the
[44:16] grammar that you use and and the very
[44:18] doctrine that you speak." He said, "You
[44:21] even said so much last night that Satan
[44:23] could not heal." Said, "Shame on you for
[44:25] such a remark." This man is just really
[44:28] giving brother Brandham what for. It
[44:31] says, and I thought a dean of a Lutheran
[44:34] college, 22page letter to to to actually
[44:38] correct the prophet. Look, he says, and
[44:40] he said, write not, he says, he says,
[44:43] uh, right not far from our college here,
[44:45] there's a woman with a familiar spirit.
[44:47] She puts a big apron on and the people
[44:50] comes in and she puts her hand and her
[44:51] hands on them and then she plucks their
[44:54] veins and get a little hair from the
[44:55] from the back of her neck and roll it up
[44:57] and get the blood on there and walk down
[44:59] to the creek behind her and throws it
[45:01] over her head like that into the creek
[45:03] starts walking out with her with her
[45:04] hands and said that people standing up
[45:07] there if she's constrained to look back
[45:10] the disease is on the uh on the blood of
[45:12] the person in her in in in her hair and
[45:14] said then uh when they look back the
[45:17] disease will come back to the person but
[45:18] if not said the person gets well the
[45:21] person's to get well and said about 20%
[45:24] of those get well and then you say the
[45:26] devil can't heal he correcting or trying
[45:30] to correct the prophet look at this says
[45:34] oh he had a good mental approach
[45:38] the brother that's not what we
[45:41] approached not mental we approached the
[45:44] scripture and and often times even and
[45:46] families, we got a good mental approach,
[45:49] but we don't understand that that that
[45:52] that the dynamics are really different
[45:54] in in the economy of God. So, we can't
[45:56] approach things mentally. And and again,
[45:59] this might have worked for this family
[46:00] over here, but it might not work for
[46:02] your family. Oh, hallelujah.
[46:06] Amen. Amen. We we must trust God. It
[46:09] says he says um he says um well, 22 page
[46:12] letter didn't even address me as
[46:14] brother.
[46:16] Look at this now. The man wrote 22
[46:18] pages. Never even said brother Brandham.
[46:20] I don't know what he called him.
[46:23] Brandon. Okay. And that now you know
[46:25] people doing that nowadays, right? They
[46:28] they got total disre disrespect for the
[46:30] servant of God. Now let me tell you
[46:32] another thing in the household,
[46:36] in the house, in the family. Don't you
[46:39] get so disrespectful children that
[46:42] you're calling your parents by their
[46:44] first names. That's right. That's right.
[46:51] No. My daughter just don't walk around
[46:52] and say, "Jack, I'm doing this." No.
[47:00] Amen.
[47:02] No.
[47:04] Try again. And And that that mean try
[47:07] again. Cuz if I hear that come out your
[47:09] mouth again, it's going to be something.
[47:11] Yes, sir. No. Don't. The kids got to be
[47:14] respectful. is dad. It is mom. No, no,
[47:17] no, no, no. You got to be respect. No.
[47:19] Just call him by No. Don't call me by my
[47:21] first name. Not my child. That's right.
[47:24] No. No. No. No. No. We ain't got that.
[47:25] No. It's our relationship ain't on that
[47:27] level.
[47:29] Hello. That's a sign of disrespect from
[47:33] a child when they're calling their
[47:34] parents by their first name.
[47:37] Amen. Even in the church, I don't like
[47:38] to be called by my first name. Put a
[47:40] brother in front of that.
[47:43] That's it. Amen. Amen.
[47:46] Oh, Lord. Amen. Uh-uh. When we when we
[47:51] were we younger, you you know, you you
[47:52] had to talk a certain way. You didn't
[47:54] you didn't talk the adults like that.
[47:58] No. Brother, Mr. Sister.
[48:03] Amen. All right. Now, somebody glory to
[48:07] God. I done had it brother. Just Jack.
[48:09] Jack Jack,
[48:12] just relax here, brother. Just put a
[48:14] brother in front of that, right? And I I
[48:17] don't heard even young people. Woo Lord,
[48:20] you man, you're 30 years younger than
[48:22] me. You don't you don't do that. No. No.
[48:25] You don't know me like that.
[48:28] If my brother said that, that's one
[48:30] thing. I'm talking about, you know,
[48:31] raised up in the same household,
[48:33] brother. That's one thing. But you don't
[48:36] say that. put a brother in front of
[48:38] that.
[48:40] Amen.
[48:42] Amen. And and and if you can't call your
[48:45] your your your your your parents uh uh
[48:49] dad or mom cuz they just been that bad
[48:51] to you, put a brother in front of it.
[49:01] your brother mama a brother daddy sister
[49:04] mama
[49:07] let me come on come let me keep reading
[49:09] he said well 22page letter didn't even
[49:12] address me as brother just said Brandham
[49:14] so I thought well he said are you
[49:16] talking about your years and I was
[49:18] preaching the gospel before you was born
[49:20] and I thought a man that's preached the
[49:22] gospel that long should have respects no
[49:24] matter what he is that's right He should
[49:27] have respects no matter what he is. And
[49:29] as as Christians, we should have respect
[49:31] no matter what. Right? See, we should
[49:34] respect him. So I sat down and addressed
[49:37] him my little scratch and the best I
[49:38] could. He said he got he had the man
[49:41] wrote 22 pages to brother Brandon.
[49:43] Brother Brandham work wrote two pages
[49:45] back to him. He says the best I could
[49:48] two pages to recognize him. I said,
[49:50] "Brother, dear,
[49:55] I sure appreciate the many years that
[49:58] you have spent and all this." I said, "I
[50:01] I appreciate it, a servant of Christ,
[50:04] and I do appreciate the criticism." Now,
[50:07] a man that can't take criticism
[50:10] uh to us to correct us, to make us see
[50:12] our our bad points. I've been um I'm
[50:15] sorry. I think I missed it. So a man a
[50:17] man that can't take criticism, there's
[50:19] something wrong with his experience.
[50:22] Amen. You see, because uh uh God sends
[50:29] criticism
[50:30] to us. Amen. Uh uh to correct us, to
[50:36] make us see our bad points.
[50:39] I've been helped so much by criticism.
[50:44] Yeah. So, so brothers, we got to say
[50:46] amen.
[50:48] When we doing things, I have done things
[50:50] that could have caused some problems.
[50:53] Just Lord, I see my I see where I fail.
[50:57] I I didn't meet all the expectations of
[50:59] my family and I could have done better.
[51:02] All right. All right. Amen. Look, let me
[51:04] tell you something. Even right now,
[51:05] there's things I can still improve on.
[51:08] There's things I can still improve on.
[51:10] And and you got to be open to trying to
[51:12] bring improvement to the family
[51:14] dynamics.
[51:16] Lord, help me Jesus. He says, uh, I've
[51:19] been helped so much by criticism that
[51:21] that that's friendly criticism. Just not
[51:23] get nasty and angry, but just friendly
[51:25] criticism. So I said, I appreciate it,
[51:28] sir.
[51:30] And then I said, there's just one thing
[51:33] I would like to express here. As you
[51:35] were speaking of my grammar, of course,
[51:37] I'm not I have no education. That's
[51:39] true. But I said the thing what
[51:42] surprises me that a ding now I'm a man
[51:45] ain't got no education. I admit that.
[51:48] But I know you got some education
[51:49] because you are a dean
[51:52] of a Lutheran college. What what
[51:54] surprises me is that a dean
[51:59] of a Lutheran college would base his
[52:02] theology
[52:04] upon an experience instead of the word
[52:07] of God.
[52:09] When you talked about the witch that
[52:12] could heal,
[52:14] I said
[52:16] Jesus said if Satan cast out Satan, then
[52:21] his kingdom is divided. So therefore, he
[52:25] cannot heal. Now, now it says, see, he
[52:28] said Jesus said he couldn't heal and you
[52:30] said he could heal. I'm going to believe
[52:33] Jesus. Amen. Amen. Oh my. I just love
[52:36] this wisdom here. See, that's right. It
[52:38] says because he said, "Let every man,"
[52:41] Now he took him to another scripture.
[52:42] "Let every man's word be wrong and his
[52:45] right." I said, "I believe Jesus." And
[52:49] surprising to me that a dean of a
[52:53] Lutheran college would base its theology
[52:57] upon an experience on an emotion instead
[53:00] of the word of God. I said, "A dean or
[53:03] anyone else in a minister should bas his
[53:05] theology upon the word of the Lord." And
[53:07] I said, "I'm certainly in what you call
[53:10] to be a soothsayer."
[53:12] Watch this. He said, "I presume it was
[53:15] discernment that you was talking about
[53:17] discernment." And I said, "Did you know
[53:19] that the Pharisees and Sadducees once
[53:21] made that remark themselves when they
[53:23] seen the same thing done by our Lord
[53:25] called him be elabub?"
[53:27] I said, "Now perhaps?
[53:30] What if I am right? Now Jesus said when
[53:32] the Holy Ghost has come to do the same
[53:34] and to speak a word against it, it would
[53:36] never be forgiven in this world or the
[53:37] world to come. No matter about your 50
[53:40] years of of of been preaching a word
[53:42] against the Holy Spirit. And look at
[53:44] this. He says, "I said
[53:48] I forgive you for that and I know that
[53:51] God will for he's seeing that you didn't
[53:54] understand it." That that that that that
[53:57] right there is a very freeing statement.
[54:02] Sometimes we've we've we've looked for
[54:04] daddy to be this. Daddy cannot be God.
[54:10] He'll never be God. The only one that
[54:12] can provide all what you're looking for
[54:14] is God. Amen. Amen. Right. But but
[54:18] here's the thing. There's certain things
[54:20] and and and like brother Ram said, the
[54:21] reason that you said that, the reason
[54:23] you feel the way you feel is because you
[54:24] didn't understand.
[54:27] Let me tell you something. If you ever
[54:29] had a chance to really go back in a
[54:30] person's life and see what what really
[54:32] made them the way that they was, they
[54:34] they I'm talking about their full
[54:36] dynamic. That's right. And and you'll
[54:38] never be able to get all that. There
[54:40] just certain things that shaped us and
[54:41] mold us and made us the way that we are.
[54:44] I mean like like I'm telling you I was
[54:46] raised by uh by a stepfather. My my
[54:50] biological father was not in my life.
[54:54] Just wasn't there. And I remember there
[54:55] was been many times we had
[54:56] conversations. He would tell me, "Oh
[54:58] yeah, yeah. I'm coming down to see you
[54:59] and I'm coming down to do this and I'm
[55:01] coming." And um
[55:04] he never came. I can tell you
[55:09] from my p my mind, I can only remember
[55:11] one time my daddy came. That's when I
[55:14] got married. And I was shocked that he
[55:17] came because the religion that he was
[55:19] in, they didn't go to other churches.
[55:21] And we was going to have this have this
[55:23] this um uh wedding inside of church. And
[55:26] I'm like, "Uh, you coming to my
[55:28] wedding?" He came came with my little
[55:29] brother, showed up on when they had the
[55:32] bus station downtown. Went down there
[55:33] and picked him up. I was shocked. My
[55:35] daddy is here. He had never come before.
[55:40] He'd never come before.
[55:42] But you know what? Again, I got free in
[55:44] words because I ain't got to hold that
[55:46] over his head. When I when I went to see
[55:49] him in the hospital, like, you know
[55:50] what? It ain't going to really matter.
[55:51] Don't matter. I You know, I all I can
[55:54] say is my life has been blessed.
[55:58] I mean, I I I thank God for Roosevelt
[56:00] Burgers who stepped into my life. My
[56:02] life has been blessed. Lord, right? So,
[56:05] so so so I say I can't what I what I do
[56:07] and I had to tell my my biological
[56:09] father this. I say, you know, I give you
[56:10] respect because you are the man that
[56:13] brought me into this world,
[56:15] but I give Roosevelt Birds respect
[56:17] because he's the man that raised me in
[56:19] this world.
[56:22] I don't have a problem giving both of
[56:23] you respect. I ain't taking sides. I
[56:25] ain't got to. Right. I've been blessed
[56:28] by the best.
[56:33] I I end up with two daddies.
[56:36] How many people can say that?
[56:39] I've been blessed by the best.
[56:43] But just keep them in his place, you
[56:45] know. So I I You're going to get your
[56:46] respect because you brought me into this
[56:48] world and I'm not I'm not harboring any
[56:51] bitterness. Amen. Can I tell y'all
[56:53] something? Let me Let me Let me I think
[56:55] I'm Yeah, I'm about finished with that
[56:56] quote. He says, um, at the end of this
[56:59] quote, he says, "I forgive you for that.
[57:01] I know that God will, for he seemed that
[57:03] you didn't understand it." and I wrote
[57:05] him the nicest letter that I could.
[57:07] Later, I got a letter inviting me to
[57:10] come up. So, when when brother Brandham
[57:12] offered this forgiveness to this man, it
[57:15] actually freed the man to be able to
[57:18] say, "Come on up here and pray for us.
[57:20] We want to receive the same Holy Ghost
[57:21] that you got."
[57:24] After a 22page letter berating,
[57:27] but brother Brandon, what freed him not
[57:29] only freed him, oh my, it freed the
[57:31] ding, too.
[57:33] I forgive you for that, my dear brother.
[57:38] Woo Jesus, that's freeing.
[57:43] Let me tell y'all, let me give y'all
[57:44] something. And I a little article that I
[57:46] was reading
[57:48] about uh forgiveness
[57:52] says in this article they said I I read
[57:55] one report of an astonished patient who
[57:57] was told by his doctor if you don't cut
[58:02] out your resentment
[58:04] I may have to cut out part of your
[58:06] intestinal tract.
[58:10] This is in the article. If you don't cut
[58:12] out part of your resentment,
[58:15] the doctor saying, "I'm going to have to
[58:16] cut out part of your intestinal tract."
[58:21] What this what he's saying here is you
[58:24] trying to figure out why you sick.
[58:27] We done ran tests. We done ran this
[58:30] diagnosis and we done did that. We done
[58:32] put you under all kind of stuff and we
[58:34] ain't found nothing.
[58:36] Well, now if we ain't found nothing
[58:38] physical, it must be something different
[58:41] here going on. And he said, if you don't
[58:43] get rid of your resentment,
[58:45] I'mma I'm the cut out part of your
[58:47] intestinal tract. Watch what he say. He
[58:49] says, fortunately, the man took the
[58:50] doctor's device. He had been nursing a
[58:53] bitter grudge against a former business
[58:55] partner. He want he went to see this man
[58:58] resolve their differences and forgave
[59:00] him. And when he returned to the doctor,
[59:02] his physical condition had cleared up.
[59:09] There was another lady who wrote a book
[59:12] called None of These Diseases. Dr. Si
[59:15] McMillan, I believe, uh reported that a
[59:18] forgiving spirit could save us from
[59:20] ulcerative colitis,
[59:23] toxic goiters.
[59:25] Uh it uh uh a forgiving spirit can save
[59:28] you from high blood pressure,
[59:32] scores of other diseases including
[59:34] ulcers, asthma, arthritis,
[59:37] neur neurodermatitis and heart elements.
[59:42] All possible effects of resentment.
[59:51] Not to forgive is to yield oneself to
[59:55] another's control.
[59:58] If one does not forgive, then one is
[1:00:01] controlled by the other's initiatives
[1:00:03] and is locked into a sequence of act and
[1:00:07] response of outrage and revenge.
[1:00:11] Tit for tat.
[1:00:15] He says escalating always. And typically
[1:00:18] what causes this is because people not
[1:00:20] willing to forgive. He says the the
[1:00:22] present is endlessly overwhelmed and
[1:00:25] devoured by the past.
[1:00:28] The present. We're in the present
[1:00:29] moment. We get into, man, we having a
[1:00:30] great time. We're doing this. We're
[1:00:31] doing that. And all of a sudden,
[1:00:32] something come up from the past and it
[1:00:35] shows that you never forgave that
[1:00:36] person.
[1:00:38] It changes the moment. I'm I'mma keep
[1:00:40] preaching. I'mma keep preaching.
[1:00:43] But to forgive is to be free from the
[1:00:45] past. Let me let me go on a little
[1:00:48] further. It said they said in this
[1:00:49] article further an unforgiving attitude
[1:00:52] is destructive to a personal
[1:00:54] relationship. It goes without saying
[1:00:56] that many close relationships especially
[1:00:58] marriage relationships are destroyed not
[1:01:00] so much by uh what has been done but
[1:01:02] what hasn't been done.
[1:01:06] The forgiving part hasn't been done.
[1:01:10] Right? It says forgiving one another.
[1:01:11] says where wherever I I wherever I fail
[1:01:14] to forgive another a wall of resentment
[1:01:17] builds up between us and eventually we
[1:01:19] become estranged right and but once I
[1:01:22] forgive feelings of love can be restored
[1:01:25] if that is appropriate. They go on and
[1:01:28] say this says however forgiveness needs
[1:01:30] to be genuine and not just a religious
[1:01:32] or sentimental act because it is the
[1:01:34] right thing to do. Right? If our
[1:01:36] forgiveness isn't genuine, resentment
[1:01:39] will poke its ugly head out at the most
[1:01:42] unexpected times. Like when a couple
[1:01:45] gets into an argument, they start
[1:01:47] dragging up events from the past that
[1:01:49] they still feel resentful about.
[1:01:51] Obviously, those things haven't been
[1:01:53] forgiven. Forgiveness may not forget the
[1:01:56] past,
[1:01:58] but it can bury it.
[1:02:00] I like that. Here's another thing that
[1:02:01] Brother Brandham says. It says um you
[1:02:04] know we have the ability to forgive but
[1:02:08] we can't forget.
[1:02:11] Only God can forgive and forget. So so
[1:02:15] with with us not being able to forget. I
[1:02:17] can't forget that my biological father
[1:02:20] was not there. That's the truth. But I
[1:02:24] don't have to be bitter about it.
[1:02:28] I don't have to be bitter about it. And
[1:02:30] I'm I'm glad that I had men in my life
[1:02:33] at the time that he was leaving here. Uh
[1:02:35] I had men in my life, my my boss at the
[1:02:37] time. I mean, even even that boss that
[1:02:40] told me to go fired me. And the way they
[1:02:43] fired me, Lord, I was I I could be very
[1:02:46] very resentful.
[1:02:48] But no, no, no, no, no. I I choose,
[1:02:50] Amen, to be forgiven because I know by
[1:02:52] them firing me, it pushed me to the area
[1:02:55] that God wanted me to be in.
[1:02:58] And God needed men like that to come and
[1:03:00] push me. Otherwise, I would have stayed
[1:03:01] right down that job.
[1:03:05] I remember with all this going on in my
[1:03:07] life with my my my my bi biological
[1:03:10] father, his brother uh did all he could
[1:03:12] to just try to be be there for me and my
[1:03:14] sister and and uh you know, he would try
[1:03:16] to you know, spend time, call us. He
[1:03:18] called me more than my dad did. And any
[1:03:20] promises he made, he he actually kept.
[1:03:23] Uh, and and I remember um when um when I
[1:03:26] when I got there to Alabama to uh um
[1:03:30] just to come see about dad and my my
[1:03:32] uncle was coming and I was going out and
[1:03:34] I missed my uncle by just I want to say
[1:03:36] a couple hours. He was driving down from
[1:03:37] Detroit and I had to fly out of u
[1:03:40] Atlanta so I had to get back to the
[1:03:41] airport and all that. So I missed him
[1:03:43] but he stayed there for the rest of the
[1:03:45] week. when my dad passed, uh, you know,
[1:03:47] he's the one that kind of let me know
[1:03:48] and and he told me what the expenses
[1:03:50] would be and he asked me, you know,
[1:03:52] would I be able to help out with some of
[1:03:53] the expenses? I said, "Yeah, we'll we'll
[1:03:55] do it." So, you know, we we we we we did
[1:03:58] all this and um
[1:04:02] Barrett, my dad, preached his funeral,
[1:04:04] and man, we had a good time. I remember
[1:04:06] that sermon uh talking about the um the
[1:04:09] um 23rd Psalm. I always like preaching
[1:04:12] that. And uh and as we as we preach that
[1:04:15] one lady sitting in the audience, she
[1:04:16] say, "I almost threw my shoe at you the
[1:04:18] way you was preaching."
[1:04:21] Say, "Please don't throw no shoe."
[1:04:27] But um at the end of the day, we were
[1:04:30] sitting at one of our relatives house
[1:04:31] and my uncle was just sitting in the
[1:04:32] car, sitting in the chair in the back
[1:04:34] and um and I went back to say, you know,
[1:04:37] "Bye. I'll see you. Got to head back to
[1:04:39] you know, Florida and everything." and
[1:04:41] and he looked me in my eye and he said
[1:04:44] and he just said these words. He says,
[1:04:46] "Jack,
[1:04:48] you're a good man."
[1:04:51] When my uncle said that to me, I knew he
[1:04:52] was saying a lot more. When he said,
[1:04:55] "You're a good man." He said, "You know
[1:04:56] what? You you didn't have to do what you
[1:04:58] just did. You could have just you could
[1:05:00] have held on to that resentment. You
[1:05:02] could have left me with all the
[1:05:03] responsibility of having to bury my
[1:05:05] brother, but you stepped up and you
[1:05:07] stepped in even though your daddy did
[1:05:09] you the way he did you. And I'm going to
[1:05:11] tell you something. It's not that I'm a
[1:05:12] good man, but because I got a a good
[1:05:15] father.
[1:05:17] Amen. That has changed me and given me
[1:05:20] three freeing words that I can respond
[1:05:23] differently.
[1:05:25] Amen. And and and and when I finish
[1:05:27] praying with my daddy and in and in in
[1:05:28] in the hospital, my expectation that I'm
[1:05:30] going to see him on the other side.
[1:05:32] Amen. And things that we couldn't get
[1:05:34] right on this side, they'll be made
[1:05:36] right over there. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:41] But I it's up to me to to practice the
[1:05:44] three freeing words. Yes. Amen.
[1:05:50] Joseph is a prime example. Let me give
[1:05:52] you two real quick examples. Joseph is a
[1:05:54] prime example of a man that
[1:05:59] um offered forgiveness.
[1:06:01] I want to go to Genesis 50 and verse 15.
[1:06:08] Yeah. I'll just read these two stories
[1:06:10] in from scripture and then I'll I'll
[1:06:12] just bring it to a close. Genesis 50
[1:06:16] verse1 15.
[1:06:21] We got to understand this is u the end
[1:06:24] of Joseph's life. I'm sorry the end of
[1:06:27] his father's life.
[1:06:30] And um
[1:06:32] Joseph has gone through again there's
[1:06:35] family dynamics that that were created
[1:06:38] uh because daddy gave Joseph this this
[1:06:40] this rainbow coat and um caused
[1:06:44] jealousies. It caused caused resentment.
[1:06:46] It caused all kind of stuff. Caused his
[1:06:47] brothers to get so jealous of him that
[1:06:49] they said, "You know what? We're gonna
[1:06:51] get rid of this fell. If we have to kill
[1:06:54] him, we'll kill him. But we we can't
[1:06:55] keep living in a in a condition like
[1:06:57] this at home. Daddy. Daddy don't see
[1:06:59] what he's doing. So, you know, Joseph
[1:07:02] comes out there to see about his
[1:07:03] brothers. Uh, a couple of them want to
[1:07:05] kill. Then the others like, "No, no, no,
[1:07:07] no. Don't do that. No, don't do that.
[1:07:08] Let's just put him in this pit till we
[1:07:10] can figure out what we're going to do."
[1:07:10] They put him in the pit. And others, you
[1:07:12] know, one saying, "I'm going to go back
[1:07:14] and free him from that pit." But before
[1:07:15] we can get back, the others saw some
[1:07:17] some merchant men coming. They said,
[1:07:18] "We'll just sell him off as a slave."
[1:07:20] pick the boy up out the pit pit, sold
[1:07:23] him off as a slave, and then uh come up
[1:07:25] with a lie to tell daddy that he's dead.
[1:07:29] They lying for years about this death.
[1:07:32] Now, uh time goes by, Joseph ends up
[1:07:35] down here, not only uh enslaved, but now
[1:07:38] he um ends up in prison because of a lie
[1:07:41] from Piper's wife. All these bad things
[1:07:45] happening to Joseph because of
[1:07:47] resentment from his brothers.
[1:07:49] But God was in the whole plan.
[1:07:53] And see, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph actually
[1:07:56] understood better that God was in the
[1:07:59] plan. And And let let me tell you
[1:08:00] something. I understand no matter what
[1:08:02] my biological father had not done, I
[1:08:04] understand God had a greater plan.
[1:08:09] Oh my. And when I look at just, you
[1:08:12] know, I I got a I got a I got a younger
[1:08:14] brother right now in prison that was
[1:08:16] raised by my daddy.
[1:08:19] in prison right now. Call me quite
[1:08:21] often, right? In prison. Had I been
[1:08:24] raised in that environment, where would
[1:08:26] I be today?
[1:08:28] So sometime God allows certain things to
[1:08:30] happen in order to get you out of
[1:08:31] environment because he want you
[1:08:32] somewhere else.
[1:08:35] See, and and when you understand that
[1:08:36] God got a greater plan, then you just my
[1:08:40] life is in your hands.
[1:08:42] So, Joseph come to realize this and now
[1:08:45] you know uh even gives Pharaoh this
[1:08:48] dream about a famine and Joseph
[1:08:50] interprets the dream from prison. Had he
[1:08:52] not been in the prison that he was in,
[1:08:54] he would have never come into Pharaoh's
[1:08:55] presence. Had he not been sold into
[1:08:58] Piper's house, he would have never come
[1:09:00] into Pharaoh's presence because the
[1:09:02] being been being Potterer working for
[1:09:03] Pharaoh, Potterer could put Joseph in a
[1:09:06] prison that only people that were close
[1:09:08] to Pharaoh would go to.
[1:09:10] This was God was very very strategic.
[1:09:16] This wasn't just a regular prison. No,
[1:09:18] this was a prison that only potterer's
[1:09:20] pe I mean Pharaoh's people would go to
[1:09:23] people that were close to Pharaoh. So
[1:09:25] that's why the butler was there. That's
[1:09:26] why the baker was there. They didn't
[1:09:28] just go any any prison.
[1:09:32] My God. God God is smart. Yes. So he
[1:09:36] puts Joseph in his place and then and
[1:09:38] and and and he interprets the the dream
[1:09:40] of Pharaoh, you know, when he has the
[1:09:42] opportunity got raised to second in
[1:09:44] power and and while he's there second in
[1:09:46] power, then all of a sudden the famine
[1:09:48] is driving his family back into
[1:09:51] Egypt.
[1:09:53] Daddy comes,
[1:09:56] but daddy dies.
[1:09:59] And um after daddy dies, the brothers
[1:10:02] approach Joseph. Oh Lord, daddy's done
[1:10:05] and we the one that did this and daddy
[1:10:07] was the glue to hold it all together.
[1:10:09] Let me tell you something. Daddy not the
[1:10:10] glue.
[1:10:13] Your heavenly father
[1:10:16] is the glue that holds it all together.
[1:10:20] Watch what happens here in scripture.
[1:10:21] Let me read quickly. Um when Joseph's
[1:10:24] brethren
[1:10:26] thought their father was dead, they
[1:10:27] said, "Joseph will per adventure hate
[1:10:30] us, and would certainly require us all
[1:10:34] the evil which we did unto him."
[1:10:37] And they sent a messenger unto Joseph,
[1:10:40] saying, Thy father did command before he
[1:10:42] died, saying, "So shall you say unto
[1:10:45] Joseph, look, look at this. Daddy said
[1:10:49] forgive.
[1:10:53] Daddy said forgive. Cuz see if Joseph
[1:10:56] does not forgive, oo,
[1:10:59] life gets really, really tough for these
[1:11:00] brothers. But daddy encouraged you to
[1:11:03] forgive. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look,
[1:11:04] look, look, fellas. Y'all lying in the
[1:11:07] first place.
[1:11:09] This is the daddy didn't send that. But
[1:11:12] see, Joseph was at a place where he
[1:11:15] didn't necessarily need daddy to say
[1:11:17] that.
[1:11:19] He'd already heard from a different
[1:11:21] daddy.
[1:11:23] It already changed his heart. And by by
[1:11:26] having his heart changed, look at how he
[1:11:28] responds to this, right? It says um um
[1:11:32] uh uh truly uh uh uh so shall you say
[1:11:35] unto them, Joseph, for Joseph, forgive,
[1:11:38] I pray thee, this trespass of thy
[1:11:40] brethren, and their sin, for they did
[1:11:42] they did unto thee evil. And now we pray
[1:11:45] thee, forgive the trespasses of the
[1:11:47] servants of the God of thy father. And
[1:11:49] Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
[1:11:53] He's crying. Look at this.
[1:11:56] and his brethren also went and fell down
[1:11:59] before his face. They said, "Behold, we
[1:12:01] be thy servants." And Joseph said unto
[1:12:04] them,
[1:12:06] "Fear not,
[1:12:08] for am I in the place of God.
[1:12:13] But as for you,
[1:12:16] ye thought evil against me."
[1:12:23] It's freeing words. That's right. You
[1:12:26] thought evil against me. Look at Look at
[1:12:28] Joseph is a changed man.
[1:12:32] You thought evil against me. But God
[1:12:38] meant it
[1:12:40] unto good to bring to pass as it is this
[1:12:44] day to save much people alive. Jesus.
[1:12:48] And then he goes a little further. He
[1:12:50] said, "Now therefore, fear ye not. Stop
[1:12:52] act stop acting this way. Yeah, I know
[1:12:54] you did this and I know you, but you
[1:12:56] ain't got to be acting funny around me
[1:12:57] no more
[1:12:59] cuz I forgive you. I really I I in my
[1:13:04] heart I forgive you. You don't have to
[1:13:05] worry about these things no more. Don't
[1:13:07] Don't let the devil keep bringing this
[1:13:08] back to your mind.
[1:13:11] Therefore, fear you not. I will nourish
[1:13:14] you. I'm going to feed you
[1:13:18] and your little ones. and he comforted
[1:13:21] them and spake kindly unto them. I'm
[1:13:24] gonna tell you when true forgiveness
[1:13:25] comes, it will it will cause kind words
[1:13:27] to come forth as well as kind actions.
[1:13:32] Three freeing words. I
[1:13:36] forgive
[1:13:39] you. Amen.
[1:13:44] as
[1:13:45] um we processed this Father's Day, I I I
[1:13:48] I I just want to encourage you if you
[1:13:50] got a dad that just wasn't there and he
[1:13:53] did so much. Oh, I I had I had some more
[1:13:56] here, but I'll just mention I think I I
[1:13:58] got one quote that I want to read and I
[1:14:00] I'll close. Uh this quote is coming from
[1:14:02] um
[1:14:05] the great commission. Yeah, let me give
[1:14:07] this one. But if you got a father that
[1:14:09] just wasn't there and he just, you know,
[1:14:11] m maybe you just
[1:14:14] you despise daddy,
[1:14:17] I want to encourage you, use these three
[1:14:20] words to get to a spot where you can
[1:14:22] respect daddy,
[1:14:25] you can love daddy the way God loves
[1:14:27] you. Because if you can't forgive,
[1:14:31] then God can't forgive you.
[1:14:35] The great commission, here's the last
[1:14:36] quote.
[1:14:38] May I drop this
[1:14:41] little thing to you brethren
[1:14:44] as I know
[1:14:46] your different denominations. I think
[1:14:48] I've never talked like never like talked
[1:14:51] like this to a group of people but in
[1:14:53] this locality here and and throughout
[1:14:56] the nation it's become now it's becoming
[1:14:58] now if the devil can keep us separated
[1:15:03] he's got us shooting at one another. So
[1:15:06] he's got an open target anywhere he
[1:15:07] wants to shoot. And and what's the use
[1:15:09] of shooting? We're shooting one another.
[1:15:12] See? See? So he can just sit back and
[1:15:15] relax. That mean the devil don't even
[1:15:16] have to fight if we fighting with each
[1:15:18] other.
[1:15:22] But did you let me just give you if if I
[1:15:24] have found grace in your sight, the
[1:15:26] prophet is saying, if I found grace in
[1:15:28] your sight through God, you take my word
[1:15:30] for this, brother. If you want to be a
[1:15:32] blessing
[1:15:34] and get a blessing
[1:15:37] when a man has done you wrong and he is
[1:15:40] absolutely justly I mean he has done you
[1:15:43] wrong and you know that he's done you
[1:15:45] wrong. He's done some evil. Look at
[1:15:47] this.
[1:15:49] Don't mention that.
[1:15:52] You take him to prayer before God. And
[1:15:56] don't just don't take it in a way of
[1:15:58] just a selfish and say, "Well, I'm
[1:16:00] supposed to do this." But but stand with
[1:16:02] your shoulder to his shoulder and stand
[1:16:05] in the presence of God our father. Uh uh
[1:16:08] the way of prayer should be made in the
[1:16:09] presence of God. Say, "Father, here's my
[1:16:11] brother and he's justly he deserves
[1:16:14] punishment because he's done me evil. I
[1:16:17] don't see why he did it.
[1:16:20] It says, "Then let God
[1:16:24] go to talking to you, not talking to
[1:16:26] him.
[1:16:28] Let God go to talking to you, and you'll
[1:16:31] see maybe
[1:16:33] what that man's been through. The devil
[1:16:37] has twisted him up somewhere and cause
[1:16:39] him to do that. Though he's absolutely
[1:16:42] wrong, before you leave the throne of
[1:16:44] God, you'll be feeling sorry for that
[1:16:46] man because God will reveal to you
[1:16:48] something that show you why the man act
[1:16:51] the way he act because something
[1:16:52] happened in his life to cause him to be
[1:16:54] that way. Right.
[1:16:57] Prayer will allow you to be able to look
[1:16:59] into a deeper realm of things. Yes, sir.
[1:17:03] I'm I'm I mean, when you really take it
[1:17:04] to the Lord in prayer. Yes.
[1:17:08] It says um before you leave the throne
[1:17:10] of God, you'll be feeling sorry for that
[1:17:12] man. You'll be sympathizing with that
[1:17:15] brother. And when you get back down to
[1:17:17] where uh earth again, you'll go over to
[1:17:20] that brother and shake his hand because
[1:17:22] you know what he's been through. You
[1:17:24] can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:17:26] presence of God and condemn anybody. I
[1:17:29] don't believe. No sir. Even if he's a
[1:17:32] rank sinner.
[1:17:35] And what about a brother that made a
[1:17:37] mistake?
[1:17:39] Though I say he's wrong.
[1:17:41] Sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:17:43] not wrong. But if he is wrong, well, if
[1:17:46] he will if we will take him to the
[1:17:48] throne of God, stand there
[1:17:50] shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother,
[1:17:51] knowing he's immortal, and maybe his
[1:17:53] destination
[1:17:56] rests
[1:17:58] upon our attitude towards him.
[1:18:02] And see, when you got unforgiveness in
[1:18:03] your heart, you usually have a really
[1:18:05] bad attitude.
[1:18:08] But somebody's destination
[1:18:11] is resting on your attitude towards
[1:18:13] them. I want you to go beyond the
[1:18:14] fathers. I want you to look just in your
[1:18:17] own life and other people that that that
[1:18:19] maybe have done you wrong. Their
[1:18:21] destinations resting on how you respond
[1:18:23] to them. Forgiveness just it's all over.
[1:18:25] We got to be able to we got to forgive.
[1:18:27] And amen. uh uh uh co-workers,
[1:18:31] classmates,
[1:18:32] uh my God. Family members, church folk,
[1:18:36] members of forgiveness just goes all
[1:18:38] over the place. Oh my.
[1:18:41] Their destination rest upon your
[1:18:43] attitude towards them. And when it comes
[1:18:45] back from the throne of God, we realize
[1:18:47] that we're everyone guilty and we all
[1:18:50] need help from the other.
[1:18:53] And the best way to do
[1:18:56] is pray. And let me tell you something.
[1:18:59] When you pray, the scriptures say
[1:19:02] forgive.
[1:19:04] Brother Brandham actually said that uh
[1:19:06] faith is actually based upon
[1:19:09] forgiveness.
[1:19:11] You can't even have faith if you don't
[1:19:14] have forgiveness.
[1:19:17] God,
[1:19:19] let us let us experience these freeing
[1:19:24] words.
[1:19:26] I forgive
[1:19:29] you.
[1:19:34] Let's pray.
[1:19:38] Father,
[1:19:42] oh God, just a thought here on Father's
[1:19:44] Day,
[1:19:46] you've given us, oh God, just to ponder
[1:19:49] and to
[1:19:51] think about.
[1:19:53] Lord,
[1:19:56] brother Solomon was me mentioning
[1:19:58] earlier how
[1:20:00] um we have sometimes the sick in our
[1:20:03] midst and and and the prophet said there
[1:20:06] should not be one feeble one among us.
[1:20:09] But oh God, maybe the reason that we
[1:20:13] might have these things in here is
[1:20:14] because we haven't come to a place of
[1:20:17] complete forgiveness,
[1:20:20] Lord. A a a releasing
[1:20:23] a dropping of the bag,
[1:20:25] not holding on to these things that
[1:20:27] weigh us down. The scriptures say we got
[1:20:29] to lay aside every sin and every weight
[1:20:31] that so easily besets us. And
[1:20:33] unforgiveness is a weight that could
[1:20:35] easily beset us. Stops people from
[1:20:39] fellowship.
[1:20:41] It stops people from Lord just loving
[1:20:44] their neighbor as themselves. that stops
[1:20:46] us, Lord, from from doing the things
[1:20:47] that uh re that that actually show the
[1:20:51] life of Christ in us. I pray Lord that
[1:20:54] this would just be something that from
[1:20:57] the pull pit to the back door
[1:21:00] God that we would search our hearts,
[1:21:03] search our relationships, and Lord, if
[1:21:06] there's anything that would uh Lord,
[1:21:10] that stick his ugly head out that we
[1:21:12] would try to get those things sorted
[1:21:13] out. Lord, we we we are people believing
[1:21:17] you for a a church and for a school and
[1:21:20] and if there's anything here that would
[1:21:22] be blocking us from receiving the
[1:21:24] blessing that you have for us, God, help
[1:21:26] us to search these things out, that we
[1:21:28] would make these things right,
[1:21:31] our hearts would be changed from the
[1:21:33] inside,
[1:21:35] God, that we bring glory and honor to
[1:21:37] yourself.
[1:21:39] We want to be right, God. We don't want
[1:21:41] to harbor and hold on. Some of us are
[1:21:44] experiencing illness in our body and
[1:21:46] sickness because of unforgiveness.
[1:21:50] Lord Jesus,
[1:21:52] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[1:21:55] your spirit. Thank you for constructive
[1:21:58] criticism. Thank you, God. We can
[1:22:01] receive it. And Lord, we want to be
[1:22:03] better. We really do want to be better.
[1:22:06] So help us, God. Bless these families,
[1:22:08] oh God. And Lord, I just pray that you
[1:22:10] bring a unity in every home. Lord, if
[1:22:13] there's things that the fathers have to
[1:22:14] make right with their families, then
[1:22:16] Lord, just let them make it right. Lord,
[1:22:19] just as Brother Brandon made it, uh,
[1:22:21] just offered forgiveness to that dean
[1:22:23] and how it changed not just that dean's
[1:22:25] life, but Lord, all those that were in
[1:22:26] that college, they he prayed for them to
[1:22:28] receive the Holy Ghost and all of them
[1:22:30] received the Holy Ghost because of of of
[1:22:33] a free comment, a free instatement.
[1:22:36] Help us, Lord, to free not just one
[1:22:39] another, but to free ourselves because
[1:22:44] forgiveness is to set the captive free

[1:27:53] I know there is peace within your

[1:27:59] I speak Jesus.
[1:28:06] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] Amen.
[1:28:13] Amen. Let's bow our hearts.
[1:28:16] Father, we want to speak that great
[1:28:18] name, Lord Jesus.
[1:28:20] Lord, after a message like this that
[1:28:23] we've just heard, Lord Jesus,
[1:28:26] Lord, from your heart to our hearts, you
[1:28:29] want us to forgive.
[1:28:31] Lord, we want to have a forgiving
[1:28:33] spirit, Lord. As Peter asked the Lord,
[1:28:36] how many times shall I forgive my
[1:28:39] brother today? Seven times. And the Lord
[1:28:41] Jesus said,
[1:28:43] seven times 70. 490 times. Lord, that's
[1:28:48] not saying just forgive 490 times, but
[1:28:52] have a forgiving spirit.
[1:28:56] Lord, before someone sins against us,
[1:28:58] Lord, we want to forgive.
[1:29:01] But Lord Jesus, we want to give them an
[1:29:03] opportunity to come, Lord God, and make
[1:29:06] things right.
[1:29:09] So father we pray Lord Jesus as we
[1:29:12] forgive our brothers and our sisters
[1:29:15] Lord we also want to forgive ourselves
[1:29:18] Lord
[1:29:20] many times we wrong ourselves Lord Jesus
[1:29:24] when we think that a brother or sister
[1:29:26] may have something against us and we get
[1:29:28] a complex Lord Jesus and Lord sometimes
[1:29:31] we stay away or try and shy away from
[1:29:34] one another Lord Jesus that's not right
[1:29:36] Lord it's just Satan playing with our
[1:29:39] mind. Lord, it's us shooting at one
[1:29:42] another.
[1:29:43] But Lord, we need to forgive
[1:29:46] knowing that our brother and sister
[1:29:47] would never want to hurt us or harm us.
[1:29:50] It's just Satan, Lord. So, Father, we
[1:29:53] pray almighty God, just be with the
[1:29:56] hearts and minds of your children, Lord.
[1:29:58] We want to bring each one into your
[1:30:00] presence, Lord. Asking, Lord God, as we
[1:30:03] forgive, Lord, not only our enemies,
[1:30:06] Lord, but one another, Father, forgive
[1:30:08] your people,
[1:30:10] Father. We pray for our pastor, Lord
[1:30:12] Jesus.
[1:30:14] Lord, what he's gone through, Lord. The
[1:30:17] message that was brought forth to us is
[1:30:19] because of what he went through in life.
[1:30:22] Lord, he could have been very bitter,
[1:30:24] Lord, and we could have heard a
[1:30:25] different kind of message this morning
[1:30:27] that would have would not have benefited
[1:30:29] us, but it was your grace in his life,
[1:30:32] Lord God, to help him to overcome
[1:30:35] himself.
[1:30:36] And Father, may we all overcome
[1:30:38] ourselves, Lord. Give him strength,
[1:30:41] Lord, to his body. Give him rest to his
[1:30:43] heart and to his mind, Lord Jesus. And
[1:30:46] father, may he continue to press the
[1:30:48] battle and know, Lord, that we believe
[1:30:50] your word and believe what he has
[1:30:52] preached. Father, now may we go be doers
[1:30:55] of this word. Be with the people as we
[1:30:57] leave this place, Almighty God. Go
[1:31:00] before each one, Lord. Make their path
[1:31:02] straight, Lord Jesus, and bless them all
[1:31:05] that they put their hands to. Again,
[1:31:07] Father be with Sister Vera, Lord. Bless
[1:31:10] the family, Lord. May they all be
[1:31:12] encouraged in you. And we thank you Lord
[1:31:15] for brother Willie Lord stepping up Lord
[1:31:17] to be a blessing to the family. Father
[1:31:20] he's always been a blessing to us. Bless
[1:31:22] each one Lord God. We'll be careful to
[1:31:24] give you the praise on and glory for all
[1:31:26] that you accomplish within our lives.
[1:31:28] It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:31:31] Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You
[1:31:33] may have your seats and our brothers to
[1:31:36] come and dismiss you at this time.
[1:31:40] Burn like a fire.
[1:31:50] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[1:31:58] over every heart in every mind.
[1:32:06] I know there is peace within your
[1:32:10] presence.
[1:32:12] Ask Jesus.

[1:32:26] Heat.
[1:32:30] [Music]
